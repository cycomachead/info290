"Overall, a pretty good porter worth getting in the future."

""
""
""
"Great visual and herby aroma. Flavor seemed a little off. Somewhat bitter and it had small after taste of celery seed. It's nicely roasted, somewhat bitter but not over powering. The celery/earthy flavor note is somewhat to strong and not very pleasant."

"Agree with jeffsta1 review.  Very good, easy drinking beer!  Just expected a tad bit more. Would definitely buy again."
""

"An exceptional porter.  I'm impressed."
"The best porter I've tried and one of the best beers I've had. Tried on tap at Twin Peaks in Irving TX and it was so good I had to have another. An exceptional brew."

"Good coffee and chocolate base all the way through the finish. Very good porter."

"Not sure if I keep trying too many beers at once but I didn't like this beer at all and I like porters. Was just blah and uneventful. Kinda bitter and bland."

"Made the mistake of trying this right after a stout which made it seem almost too light.  But the quality was obvious."

"Black Butte Porter was one of three beers that got me into craft beers well over a decade ago.  The wonderful aroma and flavor of coffee and chocolate showed me beer could actually be tasty and enjoyable.  The beer remains a go-to for me to this day.  I couldn't begin to count how many of these I've had over the years, and I'm sure there are plenty more in my future.  Thank you, Deschutes."

"I don't get it and I want to...basic appearance basic smell for a porter..a touch of coffee a touch of chocolate but not to much..taste is not bad but not great kinda watery follows the nose,mild coffee mild chocolate that's it..it's very mild..I don't get the reviews on this beer I wish I did...B- all day for me..maybe I'm wrong...I know it's considered one of the best.."
""
""
"Porters are not my favorite but a local place had this for 2 dollars a pint so i gave it a try.   Excellent beer"

"Dark color. Medium heavy body. Tastes ok."
"Overall : Always a good brew to have, halfway through my six pack and I'll buy one again when I run out. I always recommend it at our store."

"Very smooth, tasty porter, with sweet, caramel-like malt flavors. Definitely among my favorite porters, a classic."

"Bottle dated 06/03/15 poured a deep, dark mahogany color with a one-finger tan head. Medium carbonation.  Very well-balanced porter - hints of cocoa, some coffee, very subtle hops, with an understated chocolate finish.  Nothing predominates; everything seems to work well together.  Creamy-smooth mouthfeel.  A really good porter."
"The standard in NW Porters."
"O:  Lives up to the hype.  So drinkable.  Super balance of everything."
""
""
"O: I've had this one before but never in a setting where I could review it. I remember it being much better. My suspicion is that this keg wasn't all that fresh. I'll definitely revisit this one. For now, it's just ok."
""
""
"One of the best porters I've ever had. Chocolate finish tops off this amazing beer."

"12 oz. bottle from BevMo. Pours a deep brown with a medium brown head. Aromas of chocolate and light coffee with a hint of smoke. Taste is the same. Very nice mouth feel with a clean slightly smokey finish. Super flavorful for the low ABV. Tasty, smooth and drinkable."

"Dark porter rich color. Served on tap in pint glass nice foam on top.  Tasty smooth drinkable choc coffee slight bitterness that did not linger on tongue.  I really like it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability:  Easily drinkable, full of flavor, and I wish I had something meaty to pair with this in flavor.  A solid porter."
""
""
""
"O: it's solid, but not incredible"
""
""
"Overall- An excellent porter, though a few others eclipse this offering by a good amount. Nice contrast of chocolate/smoky flavor. Well put together."

"Fantastic !!!!! Best porter in town"
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"UPDATE: After having a few more over the course of 2 weeks I find this to be almost forgettable.  The flavor just isn't strong enough and the mouthfeel disappears so quickly.  There are a lot of beers I would prefer instead."
""
""
""
"Overall: I am by far a porter guy when it comes to beers, and this one is by far my favorite. It is a roasty, complex porter that balances all the aspects of it perfectly."
""
""
""
"A near perfect basic porter, everything you want here. Great black with auburn highlight. Nice subtle coffee, brown sugar presence. Tastes delicious, sweet molasses, a little coffee, a hint of raisin, toasted pumpernickel. Good smooth body for the low abv. Really good, easy drinking, this would be my go to porter if I didn't live in va."
"V - Good value."
""
"Black, thin tan head. Smells of coffee and molasses. Tastes roasted coffee beans and brown sugar/molasses, Slightly Smokey. Creamy mouthfeel, delicious."

"12 oz. can at Ginny's Little Bighorn on Sun., 12/28/2014 (Chicken Shit Bingo), unknown brewing/packaging dates, poured into plastic cup, drank over 30-45 minutes"
""
"Overall very drinkable - makes me wonder why I buy other porters sometimes!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL:  this is not a style of beer I really appreciate but, this is obviously well made for the style and I have rated it as such, I enjoy Porter as part of a sampler but would never seek it out on it's own, Deschutes is a very good brewer and I would recommend their beers to my friends."
""
""
"My dads favorite brew. Any time he finds this brew in my fridge it's gone !!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Good flavor a bit watery"
""
""
"Good dark color with subtle coffee aromatics. And a burndt oak tinted smell.   Smooth taste but mouth feel fall's short of a great American porter.  Thick rich taste makes up for mouth feel. Drank from snifter on first experience but actually enjoyed more from bottle. In my opinion it did not hold up well from warming process and would suggest drinking this between 34 and 49 degrees. All in all a good porter from the Oregon boys at the Deschutes Brewery."
""
"Black in color with a small, but firm, tan head.  The smell is of highly roasted malt...not quite smokey, but almost burnt.  A touch of malt.  Coffee flavor, mixed with bread crust.  Dry, moderately bitter.  Lingering finish.  Excellent."
"Pretty sure I got a pour from a bad system / dirty line. Tasted oddly sour."
""
""
"Smooth, Medium body, moderate carbonation, hoppy chocolaty finish"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste like a porter but I've had better"
""
"Very tasty. Best American porter I've tried. Bisquitier than some others."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Disappointing porter.  Wonderful dark color but no aroma and very pedestrian taste. Easy drinking but why?  No flavor"
""
""
"Simple, perfect porter. For my tastebuds, many breweries try to do too much with their stouts/porters. Smoke, bourbon, chocolate, coffee are all nice to an extent, but in my opinion, there are too many highly rated beers that simply blow it out on one of those things and get crazy kudos for it. Black Butte, on the other hand, has all of them (well, not bourbon) in perfect balance. Always drinkable, consistent, great."
"Overall – A rather tasty, more modest abv. porter, that has a nice drinking feel and flavor overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a gorgeous, world-class beer. It pours beautifully, the head and carbonation hang on just enough the make sure you know the yeast is happy, but it is the full flavours that are most impressive. It is everything a porter should be - coffee, smoke, chocolate and dark malt, with a nicely hopped finish. Really, it doesn't get much better than this."

"Poured from draft. Appearance is black with a nice, muted head. Aroma of roasted coffee and chocolate! Shocker... Definitely some brightness comes through, also. Taste and mouthfeel are excellent. Taste mirrors the aroma with more complexity. I've read that this has zero flavorings, just malts, hops, yeast and water! Excellent porter."

"Trying to Clare this to the Edmond Fitzgerald. Boy is it tough. Poured a deep dark almost black color in a 16oz glass. Nice lacing head faded quick.  Roasted malt and chocolate notes are well balanced. A little bite but not much. Goes well with the wings I am having. I think I will switch back and forth between this and the Edmond Fitzgerald to compare. It will be a Long night."
"Not much of a Porter drinker but this is a standout. Poured a nice dark color with good lacing. Nice roasted malt and chocolate flavored. I like it better than Edmond FitZgerald  which is my go to Porter if I want one.  No complaints here. Trying to talk hubby into one. He is having the Edmond Fitzgerald."

"A very sold porter that you can drink after a good day rock climbing or mountain biking. But also one you can drink after work or any other time there is a good reason to drink a full bodied porter."

"Pours black, like the name implies, with a creamy tan head and excellent lacing. Aromas of roast, chocolate, coffee, caramel and toffee all leaped from the snifter and into my nostrils leaving me very happy and ready for a sip. To the taste there was chocolate, coffee/espresso, lovely roast, brown sugar and a malty caramel/toffee sweetness. Had a medium body but very drinkable with a clean finish, just excellent execution across the board here. One of my favorite porters, and one I find myself recommending time and time again."

"Dark brown appearance with crimson highlights. Light tan head of two fingers. Smells of  brown sugar, maple syrup, caramel and grainy malt. Tastes flat to me - some caramel malt, minimal roasted malt and an odd cloying aftertaste that seems to get stuck on my palate. Low to medium mouthfeel and low carbonation. I don't get the love for this beer - it doesn't have the roasted malt and coffee flavors that I look for in a good porter. No biggie - glad I have access to both Founders Porter and GL Eddie Fitz."

"O-  I am not a porter person by any means but this is the best porter I have ever had.  I actually enjoyed it."
"Well balanced porter. Dark. Smokey & Roasted coffee flavor, with hint of chocolate. Smooth and creamy, with a hint of bitterness.  Overall very good."

"Sweet caramel malts meet a sweet 'roastiness' like a Panda chewing on some cooked black licorice. Raul felt quite well while sippin' on this bad boy. Smooth, a bit light, but like PETA, Raul wouldn't mind making a monthly donation to this worthy cause."

"My favorite porter. It's pretty close to perfect- when it hasn't travelled across the country, that is. The one I had in Philly was a sad shell of its former self. The ones in Oregon were dreamy, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, holy wow! Though I've had this so many times before, it was only until now I realized how good this really is."

"What a tasty porter!  This one will be one of your favorites in short order.  A little bit chocolaty, a little hint of coffee, nice and dark but smooth and roasted at the same time.  Very well balanced.  Widely available too, which is a bonus."

"O - Aroma is slightly more interesting than the actual flavor but great beer all around.  Reflects the style nicely.  4.25/5"
""
""
""
""
"Very balanced, smooth and drinkable.  No heaviness or imposing flavor.  It is so balanced, some might find that it lacks the distinctive character of other porters.  But, it's tough to play it both ways.  Sometimes the imposing flavor that gives other porters the unique character is exactly what makes those porters less drinkable over the long haul.  The Bros are right, this is a great beer; it's the kind of porter that is a refrigerator staple.  Porters inherently have character, and this one finds a very nice balance all the way around; if you like dark beers, you can drink this one all day, every day, all year long.  It is extremely well-crafted."

"I heard phenomenal things about this beer and knew I needed to try it... so I did. Easily a top three (maybe four) Porter for me... clearly up there with the ""big boys."" The taste is all over (in a VERY GOOD sense) with roast, char, chocolate, coffee, and a tinge of dark fruits. The feel is basically spot-on for the style. Medium sort of body which suits the style and ABV, and then a pretty prickly carbonation as well. An incredibly tasty, easy drinking porter that I wish could be had in Michigan. I like this more than Edmund Fitzgerald, to be honest. A must-try for fans of the style. Only fault I have with this beer is that it doesn't have a lasting head and lacing that I'd ideally like, but that's a super minor fault on a fabulous brew."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1 inch head. Smell is mild, some roasted malts. Taste is also kind of mild, malts, smoke, an bit of coffee. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall, while not a bad beer, and very drinkable, I was expecting more and am left feeling underwhelmed."

"O: Fantastic. A great pick up at 7.99/6, but considering the local options (Founders and Edmund Fitzgerald) are equal if not better, I can't imagine having this one again anytime soon. So unless you live in the Great Lakes, this is the Porter you need to be drinking."

I wish the dry roasty taste would linger a little longer to balance out the sweetness, but this is an excellent brew, and I look forward to drinking the rest of this 6 pack and trying other offerings from Deschutes"

"This porter has a mildly sweet flavor with a very slight hops presence. The hops taste blend with roasted malt and coffee/chocolate undertones taking the taste buds on a wild ride. Also noted is a hint of citrus with the swallow. Im not a huge fan of porters, so I probably would not buy this in a six pack; however, if I was out and this beer was on the menu I would be excited to order. Great complex beer, and great porter with a slightly different angle."

"Poured into a pint glass with the perfect amount of carbonation for a dark brew. A deep dark brown with the smoothness of criminal named Micheal Jackson (circa the 80's not the 90's). The flavor is nutty with a dry creaminess I've never had before. This, my friends, is your favorite beer's favorite beer."

"This is a really good beer. Scents of cherry blossoms, nutmeg, chocolate, vanilla and cinnamon. Pours a thick, black body, which is medium to full. Smokey and lightly dark chocolates come through on the nose. Ridiculously smooth and silky. Definitely session-able, especially for the colder climates. Lightly hopped but good enough to balance the roasted malts. A nice brew and hard to find anything to rival it, in or out of this country."
"Overall: I think this is a really good beer overall. The feel is what does it no favors in my opinion. Again, it's not bad, just kind of not what I was expecting. Otherwise, the smell and taste, the thing that matter the most to me personally, are very good!"

"Overall: A very good, pretty standard stout. Comparing it to Guinness Draught (since everyone has had that, and it is a similar price), I would say Black Butte is a bit thicker, sweeter, and with a better aftertaste."

"Pours pitch black with thick very thick foamy, brown head. The aroma is OK. Roasted coffee mainly with hints of dark chocolate. The taste is superb, though. Roasted coffee with hints of dark chocolate at the beginning. Leaves a mild bitter aftertaste at the end. Very flavorful beer. Would definitely recommend with an after dinner dessert."

"I must confess I was expecting more from this brew based on the brewery's reputation and my own fondness for the style. It's not bad, but it lacks identity, and its fidelity to the style is somewhat suspect considering the lighter body and excessive sweetness. I doubt I could pick out of a lineup of run of the mill ""dark ale"" microbrews."
""
""
""
"This is an old school porter, meaning, it was created many years ago. I am not sure if the recipe has developed or changed over the years, but the beer tastes plain jane compared to many that are out there today. I am sure many years ago this was the cream of the crop. It isn't anymore. However, I can say, it gets my respect for it's quality, timelessness, and age. I would drink this again."

" Smuttynose, Founders, and Great Lakes.. in that order. Not quite robust enough to top those, but it still has a place in my fridge as a stand out porter. I would certainly recommend this offering."

""

""

"Overall: Fantastic porter, wish it was easier to come by."
"Appearance was muddy dark brown with a half finger of head that dissipated rather quickly. The nose was surprisingly non-descript for a beer that receives as much good press as this offering does on a regular basis. There was some roast in the flavor profile, but this offering lacked the body and the roasted punch that I’d expect in a top notch porter."

"O: great balance between malt and hop flavors, slightly sweet with a nice bitter finish, revied from notes taken on 3/6/14"

"O: Won't turn it down if offered but I won't seek it out again."
"Notes: Best by date 8/21/14"
"Real-deal porter intensity with a blackening roast and dark chocolate flavors. Black malt bitterness, minerally tanginess late in the middle, and a chocolate finish. Stays dry all the way through. Drinkability is exceptional. I love chewing through this congealed foam. The body is rich--close to full. Hefty. I'm happy with my Black Butte."

"12oz bottle with a Best By Date of 07/24/14. Pours a very dark brownish black color with very little head. Minimal lacing. The aroma is roasted malts, vanilla, caramel, and earth. The taste is roasted malts, charcoal, chocolate, and hints of vanilla. Earth and roasted malts towards the end. Charcoal and light chocolate at the end. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. Overall, a decent Porter, but nothing to0 special."

""
"Overall, this is a textbook roasted-ashy porter with big, layered flavours and rich texture."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: A great brew, but like I said: the flavor on this one isn't my favorite. It's a bit too charred for me- as if the malts were a tad over done. I liked the beer overall, though."

"Now i passed up a six pack of Lagunitas Sucks to try this and regret it. Upon pouring, it looked great, dark and thick, but weak lacing on the head. My first reaction to smelling it was ""why does this smell like blue moon?"" And then i tasted it, and it TASTED like blue moon. Okay, it tastes better than blue moon, but very similar. So why do they call it a porter when it smells and tastes like a generic wheat ale? Another example of dumbing down a style of beer simply for mass appeal. It's obvious. I was not happy that this beer tasted nothing like a porter, and the feel, even less like a porter. It doesn't stick in your mouth, the now all too common hints of coffee are not executed properly, and it's just common in taste. Had this beer been labeled as a wheat ale, i would give it a higher rating, because i do not respect this beer as a porter and believe that it should not be called one."

"I just moved to Wyoming and found this. I like the taste and mouth feel of this beer. Great with a stake. I like the sweetness and chocolate hints it leaves. little lite chocolate compared to Obsidian. Glad I brought a 6 pack home. It has to be good I caught the dog trying to steal one. He a beer snob."

"Overall - An excellent porter. I know its highly rated, but I would still put Founders Porter and Edmund Fitzgerald ahead of this one."
"I was anxious to get started, so I went with a heavy-handed aggro pour. This set up a pseudo-cascade that eventually settled into three fingers of dense, light-tan head that was steadily offgassing. Color was a deep, dark-brown with ruby highlights at the edges (SRM = 44). Nose had a roasty, dark chocolate quality along with a light smokiness. I always think of my late Pops' affinity for Hershey's Special Dark chocolate when I encounter such beers. I would eschew them in favor of sweeter stuff as a kid, but now I gravitate towards bitter or semi-sweet. Mouthfeel was big and creamy, like a scoop of ice cream on the tongue. The flavor was very chocolaty, but dark and roasty at the same time. Man, no wonder this is so highly rated! American Porters can be all over the map, but this was straight-on porter, not bbl.-aged or with wild adjuncts that meld into the style nicely, but get in the way of the base flavors. I have really enjoyed the flavors in this beer to the point that half of it is already gone and without my realizing it! Finish was semi-dry, with the smokiness really taking the edge off of the sweetness at the beginning. I will now dedicate this review to Mom-Za, who lives in Chico (Butte County), California."

"Not bad and certainly quite drinkable, but I honestly fail to see what the fuss is all about. This strikes me as a fairly good routine porter from a competent microbrewer -- certainly nothing bad, but nothing really work writing home to the folks about either. I still prefer in this market the Anchor Porter, which I think is a world-class beer and quite distinctive."

"This is a very good porter right here. I can understand why it has been acclaimed for so long."
"Overall impression: World class robust porter. A very stout porter to hearken back to the roots of the stylistic deviation. Worth seeking out."
""
""
"An outstanding porter. Almost on par with my favorite porters (Edmund Fitzgerald and Founders Porter), but lacks a little of the malt depth and creamy feel of those. Still, a top-shelf example of the style."
"O - Black Butte is a classic and I'm glad to finally see their stuff making it our way. For me the porter style has changed. Today the black, smoke filled, near 6% or over are the best in the style, but its porter's like Black Butte that are the fathers of the style and there is always a place here for this original."

"Overall: I would say I picked out a good one for my first time having anything from Deschutes, It absolutely met what I was looking for."
""
"O: this is the third bottle of this beer that I have enjoyed. What I find really interesting is although all three were purchased at the same time all three have had a different paste and feel. By a long shot this bottle was the most satisfying. I really enjoyed the flavor of this beer, and I have to say that the way it finished was really enjoyable. As with many porters, I found it got better as it warmed slightly. I can only hope this comes back to my area soon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This may be my new favorite winter beer ever. It is malty without being cloying, robust without being overwhelming, and just tastes damn good. Chocolate, coffee... all those good things are present and the smell and taste are in near perfect alignment. I only gave a few lower than 5 ratings because there mut be something I'm missing... it's just too perfect. I must say, it's wonderful to not be kicked in the tongue with excessive hopping, too. I will buy this often."
""
""

"According to the label this dark brew is one of Deschutes' old standbys, but a fairly new addition to the lineup here in Alberta. Please keep 'em coming guys. Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, a brownish black beer grading toward pitch black with some orange-red highlights. Certainly has that old school classic porter look. Aroma is initially bright and fruity, raisins and a whiff of rummy booze, along with scanty citrus hops. The first sip is less sweet than the aroma would suggest. Has that tangy ""sour"" acidic note that one expects in well-brewed porters, more common in English examples but more than welcome here. Quite dry, flinty, and chalky, with cold strong coffee and charcoal dominant on the palate. Some barley sugar, cacao powder, smoke, and bitter nuts (walnut?) do appear but these facets are low-key. Not particularly fruity. Where this one really stands out is in the mouthfeel. Wickedly creamy and silky smooth, minimally carbonated and coats the mouth a little. This can go down the hatch dangerously quickly despite the rich roasted malts predominating. If you like your porters uber-dark, dry and bitter, but exceptionally smooth, here's your beer."

"o-I liked this a little better than the obsidian"
"Beautiful Color. A deep, dark brown and a nice, thick head when poured in a glass. The smell hits you right away too, a caramelized coffee smell to me. Very bold flavors too. Small sips let you taste the strong coffee and cocoa and it sticks to your tongue in a wonderful way, no weird or funky after-taste. And I also thought it tasted a little malty after I swallowed it, also good. It has a thicker consistency and lacing around the glass. So Yummy!"

"Black in color and nearly impenetrable to light. There's a solid half inch of off white head and some nice Brussels lacing. I smell dark malt,roasted barley,and dark chocolate, mocha, and a hint of smokiness. The flavor matches the aroma perfectly. Dark roasted barley,dark malt,dark chocolate and mocha. Dark,bitter,but with a sweetness the jumps in at the end. The mouth is a silky and creamy."
""
""
""

""
""

"Pours extremely dark brown almost black with some ruby if you hold it up to a very bright light. I pick up vanilla, cherry chocolates, roasted barley, caramel, and a hint of butterscotch in the aroma. Extremely silky in the mouth with bubbly carbonation, near-perfect on the tongue. Roasty with piney hops, perfectly balanced by the sweet but not cloying malts."

"O - This beer has been a large desire of mine to try for some time and it did not disappoint. Just in time to have this before distribution hits my state. This beer is a must have and I can't wait to place it on tap at work."

"Pours out black as night with an off-white, one-finger head with decent retention, Smell is some coffee, maybe a little chocolate, and dark fruits. Taste is some burnt malt and everything else in the nose. Really nicely put together. Mouthfeel is a tad thick which is great. Overall a really nice porter."

Taste is creamy, milky, loads of chocolate with a very soft, balanced, even bitter. Creamy mouthfeel. Everything a porter should be. One of the best beers I've ever had."
"This highly touted brew has a great look as a Porter... slightly translucent with multiple shades of brown and a foamy off-white head. It's got a soft nose of toasted grains and a touch of hops. As the beverage touches my lips and fills my mouth my first impression is how silky smooth the chocolate aspect is, and how it coats nicely and the flavors linger. There's just a little bit of smoke and a crisp, bitter finish. Overall, this is an excellent, well balanced, and archetypal Porter that packs in a lot of flavor with its drink-ability."

"O/D - This is a pretty tasty porter. The mild sourness provides a nice element of flavour and all other components are present and well put together. Nice stuff and very drinkable."
""
""

"Overall - Such a solid beer, this has been a go-to of mine for some time. It's probably ""thee"" dark beer that opened my mind to exploring dark beers. It looks a bit big and scary in the glass, but the taste is lighter and more refreshing than expected...real easy to knock a couple of these back."

"This is a welcoming, rich, and tasty glass of beer. Because of the deep and complex layers of roasted barley flavor, it definitely deserves a slow and thoughtful drinking. i wish I had a fire place right now. I'm fighting strenuously against the urge to just gulp it down. Thick head and heavy lacing seem to tease me, lasting longer than I can."

"A solid American porter that isn’t that American."

"This is a good Porter but not great. The mouthfeel is not what I would expect in a Porter that smells this good. Have only rated a few Porters but after three Seattle Brewery tours I have tasted some good ones and had a guide to help understand the brew. I plan on seeking out some more Porters so I can be better at understanding by taste. Definitely would recommend for others to give it a try."

"Jet black with a rocky long lasting khaki head. Soft nose of espresso, baking chocolate, fruity, citrusy hops. Taste follows nose with a sweet, iced coffee flavor followed by milk chocolate, raisins, figs, ending with a citrus hop bitterness. Soft carbonation with a creamy almost nitro mouthfeel. A coffee lovers beer, totally delicious. No wonder this is Joe Rogans favorite beer."

"Overall - Really easy drinking. Don't want to say, I left disappointed, but given the very high expectations from all the praise, I can't say the beer exceeded my expectations.

"(3.75) D: My expectations may have been a bit too high, however I also do prefer porters that are less fruit focused and lean towards the malty side. This is still very good and I can appreciate it for what it is but just not my style of porter."

"Black Butte Porter was black in color with a thick, frothy, tan head. It had very good retention and lacing. The smell was sweet malt, coffee, and a little chocolate. The taste was sweet malt, chocolate, and hop favors with excellent balance between sweetness and bitterness. The mouthfeel was good with a medium-full body and moderate carbonation. The finish was fairly long with a little bitterness. Overall this is a very good beer and we'll worth trying out."
"An excellent American porter that I look forward to enjoying more regularly than has been possible in the past!"

"I wasn't blown away by Black Butte (I may have set my expectations too high), but it still is an impressive porter, especially for the price.

This porter is great. pours nice rich brown, good tall head. smells of vanilla, chocolate, coffee, I was thinking stout when smelling this beer. taste just right, not as sweet as my nose was making out to be, all the flavors are well balanced. maybe it was because my mind was thinking stout, but it was lighter than expected on my palate. This is and outstanding porter."
"This beer has a bold toasty tone. Milk chocolate wrapped in a cup of coffee. This porter isn't overly sweet like some on the market. This porter has some Stout tones. This porter could be more of a stout. Not much hops, but a nice smokey aftertaste. This porter lives up to the hype for me, this is the best porter that I've had."
""
"Poured into a 16 snifter, best by 1/12/14. Pours a dark mahogany, with a two inch tan head, that leaves webs of lace. Smell french vanilla, light bakers chocolate, coffee, and hints of smoke. Taste is the same, mainly sweet french vanilla, coffee, and chocolate very tasty. Body is on the thin side, ample carbonation, not dry, and goes down very easy. This very good, maybe a little over hyped, but size shouldn't always count."

"Pours a pitch-black in color with a thin beige head that leaves good lacing with each sip. The aroma is of sweet roasted malts and a hint of toffee. Very nice. The taste is pretty much the same. Perfect sweetness but not over done or over powering at all. Nice finish with no bitter aftertaste. Medium/ medium+ bodied with perfect carbonation. Really liked this one and a solid ""9" if not a ""9.5"" for this one. Will drink this again for sure! On tap it was even better!"

"O - For a porter that is often discussed along with Edmund Fitzgerald as the best porter out there, I found this beer lacking. It is a good porter, but it is in no way close to as good as Eddy Fitz. On its own it is a solid beer. It has good flavor with a creamy mouthfeel. It is good but not great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A roasty, complex beer with an excellent balance of flavors. The cream soft mouthfeel is a stand out amazing quality of this beer."
""
""
"Overall: After seeing how high this beer was rated I was shocked. Elements of this beer were great, but in my mind it has a ton of flaws for any porter side beer, let alone one that is rated this high. Founder's porter still is my favorite easy to find porter and I would recommend anyone to check it out way before this one."

"On the brightside, I could see this being more of a summer beer than other porters. While thin, it is also not very filling."

"Very smooth and drinkable beer. Nice sweetness balanced with toast and faint coffee."
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied but I feel that the carbonation is a little too aggressive. The beer lightly coats the tongue."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass, this is a nice dark bodied beer, almost pitch black with mild reddish hues every now and then. Its topped off with a nice thick tan head that simply says,” Go ahead and drink me, I’m easy...but not diseasy!” It’s billowy and very creamy all roped together by a thin lacing. The aroma is nothing short of heaven, its sweet and filled with mild roasted malts and plenty of chocolate smells all highlight by some gentle coffee undertones. Oh yeah, and there’s hint of brown sugar too. Sharp and light at first, it swarms up and thicken as it moves down your throat. Its light to medium bodied, the flavors really kick in as it nears the middle of your tongue, the bitterness fades away and the sweetness become more prevalent. It’s pretty well balanced in my opinion; the bitterness in front, the chocolates and roasted coffee in the middle and mild sweet sugars and malts in the aftertaste. This is a very drinkable porter, I might like it a bit thicker but I have nothing against this fine porter."

"EDIT: This was my full review during a blind taste test."
"Poured from bottle while in California on vacation, as not available in Indiana. I didnt take any notes at the time, but didn't need to. The overwhelming impression is this porter is exceedingly smooth in texture, as silky as I've ever had frankly and has a nice dark chocolate/cherry taste, without being sweet. I've had some amazing porters from Great Lakes, Founders, Bells and Three Floyds, but this one is unique in mouthfeel, pretty special porter."
""
"Consumed on 6/30/13"
""
"O: Black Butte Porter offers excellent, well-rounded flavors with a smooth-as-silk texture. I found myself enjoying each sip more and more, and before I knew it, I was ready to order another! Its low alcohol content and medium body keeps this one relatively light and very, very sessionable! I can't help but consider this one of my favorite brews (of any style) to date. I can definitely see me sessioning with this beauty in the future."
""
""
""
""
"O - Lame porter to my standards, its way too thin tasting and feeling, and there's not enough traditional porter backbone to make me want to have this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle, Boiling Pot, Rockport TX. Pours black with creamy, long lasting off-white head. Aroma is bready, roasted malt, hints of coffee and dark fruit. Taste is roasted caramel malt, some mild chocolate flavor with light coffee notes. Body is medium creamy and smooth, mild carbonation. Finishes with a nice combination of dark roasted malt, choclate and coffee flavor, some mild dark fruity notes and light bitterness. Overall a very good and flavorful brew."
"Overall, excellent rendition of a porter. It's light-to-medium body feel would allow for the consumption of at least more than one in a sitting. Great beer, must try for those who enjoy porter. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A stunner. It is impossible--as you can see--not to compare this bad boy with Deschutes' Obsidian Stout, and while it may not reach those levels, what should be realized is that it does not have those ambitions. Creamy, complex, and perfectly dark, with an out of this world wow factor, this is a world-class porter made by what I'm coming to realize is a world-class brewery. For just over 7 bucks a sixer, it's hard to beat a session of these."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I'm impressed with this beer. The guys over at Deschutes didn't try do do anything overly fancy, but instead stuck to the basics and crafted a darned fine beer. This will be my benchmark for porters until I taste something better."

"I'm beginning to see why this is so highly rated. It's also typically quite cheap where I usually buy beer ($2.79 for this bomber). So, the value is definitely there."
"Beer is medium to medium-light in body with carbonation of medium intensity, resulting in a smooth, foamy beer that is never fizzy feeling. Closes dry, with mild stickiness on the palate and lips."
""
""
"Verdict: A solid porter from Deschutes and certainly a benchmark for the style. While it's not overly complex, Deschutes packed a lot of flavor into a 5.20% beer. Definitely a great example of the style for regular drinking."
"O: another no-brainer: a very compelling porter - light, crisp, bracing, toasty, and roasty - reminded me of an English porter, like Fuller's London Porter, blended with an American porter like Anchor or Founders. Strong coffee-ish finish, drying and extra-roasted. Very nice."
""
""
""

"O: This beer goes down very easy but also has some nice flavors. I would have no problem drinking this beer all night long."

"Black butte porter pours a pitch black color with very small head. The. Aroma have a nice coffee and roasted malty smell. The tast has a bold roasted malt taste with hints of coffee , nice creamy taste. Very nice rich flavor. Overall a very nice full bodied porter."

"This is an excellent porter! I would love to do a side by side with my other favorite porters because this is up there with the best."

"Overall, an incredible porter, rivaled by none in my area. Just like Obsidian Stout and The Abyss, it is about as delicious as their respective styles get. Deschutes may just be the best Stout and Porter producers in the world."
""
""
""
""
"Almost rich and creamy in texture, easy to drink and a beer I'd willingly have again (out of a glass though)."
"A lighter, slightly sweeter and less roasty porter. Silky smooth and it goes down easy. A nice porter that I believe one could session on if that's what you're in to."
"O: Nice porter, overall, if too foamy. Fairly complex aroma; very good flavor. Probably the best of the 4-5 porters I've had this week."
"Overall: very tasty! Love the mouthfeel, and it truly is a beautiful beer. Glad I got to try this one."

""
""
"O) A fine example of a Porter. This wad rich and flavorful. Glad to recommend this brew."
""
""

"Overall this hits a very high mark for porters. The smoothness of this porter prevents an assault of roasted flavor and is one of the qualities about this porter that makes it outstanding IMO."

""
""
"O - Nice looking brew that holds a cap though its entirety. Well rounded, complex aroma. Good maltiness that had some hop flavors that were a little out of place but craftly balanced. Body is right on and is very drinkable. Solid brew, only the one criticism with outlandish."

"I had to excuse myself for a minute there and have a cigarette. Overall, I would recommend her to everyone, but would be totally jealous and want to keep her for my own as she is a world class beauty! Solid and dependable. I have missed my Black Butte-y!"

"O: sadly, I didn't have another one - seems like there was more to discover.... pretty solid recipe and execution.... until next time...."

"Deschutes has really nailed it with the dark beers. Obsidian Stout and Black Butte Porter are my go-to's for darker. Sometimes Anchor Porter or Sierra Nevada."

"O - This is a pleasant, very easy drinking porter. Great balance. Nothing too special, but it would make a really good beer to session and drink with friends/family."
""
"This is a good beer from a consistently good brewing company that I wasn't able to get back east. There are a few bottles from them on our list, including some BA beers and some that are not even ready to drink according to the label. Most beer isn't intended to be consumed fresh. Hey, buy it now… drink it in a year! OK, sign me up. Black Butte Porter is great, and because of this beer, I am going to plan a long weekend to Bend so we can see/drink this stuff at the source. Cheers!"
""
""
"O - An incredibly enjoyable porter, I will definitely drink this again."
"O - Not quite as flavorful, creamy, or hop intense as the Founders Porter. Still a very good porter and"
"I implore you, drink up! Drink slowly though, because this guy sits in your gut and keeps you warm!"

"An above average porter from Deschutes. Even though it is a little watery at the backend of the sip, the flavors that are present are a good representation of the porter family. Good in the bottle but even better on tap (like most really) brew that I would recommend to dark beer lovers that don't want a strong imperial stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The porter from deschutes is decent. The beer poured a nearly opaque back with deep tinges of ruby. The head is ecru and about a half finger thick and is lacing nicely. The scent carries earth and peat. The taste has a very nice earth/peat with touches of caramel and toffee. The mouthfeel is medium in body with smooth carbonation. Overall, this a great easy drinking porter. A great sessional porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of my least favorite of Deschutes' offerings. This porter seems almost subdued. It has a nice creamy dark appearance and hits all the right notes--dark roasted malts, a hint of chocolate. I would have appreciated a little more bitterness to give it a fuller, richer taste. It is slightly too thin. I expect something that feels a little heavier in my mouth when drinking a porter or stout."
""
"Rich, warm, toasty, delicious. Everything you want in a porter. Not sour the way some porters and stouts can be. Bitterness is balanced by toasty rather than sweet malt, great depth of flavour apparent after the initial ""high note"" of the hops."
""
""
""
""
""
"(O)- Overall, it really is a classic for the style. Have had this numerous times, just never got around to reviewing it, but now that this is now available near me its definitely welcomed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this is the perfect session porter, well balanced all around and nearly perfect mouthfeel, awesome chocolate notes."
""
"Overall: great porter. Not quite founders territory, but if I had this locally, It would be a regular. Would love to try this on Nitro. Think this would really step this beer up into a whole new realm."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The nice malt flavor is cut off by the fizzy carbonation and a thin body doesn’t enhance the nice malt flavor either."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a really good balanced porter. One of the best."
""
"O-a complex and intensely roasted, dark porter. Excellence in a glass."
""
""
"Overall, this is a porter I would buy and enjoy again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I really enjoyed this porter. I'm not typically a huge fan of the style, but really liked this one. If you can get Deschutes in your area, you should definitely be able to find this. The price shouldn't set you back either ($8.99 for a 6-pack in my area). Would definitely recommend seeking this one out if you've never tried it."

"Recommended."

"Overall - This is one big, complex beer. English Porters tend to be a little smoother but I really like the taste of this one!"
"O: A straight-forward but well executed porter. Very easy to drink but still substantial."
""
""
"Poured a very dark brown or light black with a one finger, off-white head. Scents of roast malt, chocolate and black coffee. Flavors of rich roast malt, hints of black coffee and rich chocolate notes. Low carbonation and a smooth, creamy mouthfeel make it easy to drink, one of the smoothest drinking experiences I've had. Excellent porter. Well worth trying."

"This is a fantastic porter....damn near stout like but just so good."

""
""
""

""
"A great porter, one of the best ""normal"" porters in the US."
""
""
""
""
""
"What a truly remarkable beer!"
""
"The beer is dark brown with an inch of beige head. Excellent retention with ample lacing. The aroma offers roast, malt, chocolate, toffee, coffee. A hint of smoke and ash with a nice chocolate roast character. Dry finish with some hop bitterness. Malty with light brown sugar and biscuit flavor. Solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I'll admit, I've loved this beer for 12+ years. If I could only ever have 1 beer this would be it. Why? It isn't the ""perfect"" beer imho, I've had others that I feel are superior to the style and others that ""knock my socks"" more, but the perfect balance, smooth drinkability of this brew just makes be love it so. Not to mention that Bend, OR rocks!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-As noted above, this is a great looking porter! Things go slightly downhill from there, but this is still a solid beer. The taste is a nicely balanced mixture of bitter and sweet malts, if a bit under-powered, and the flavors pair nicely with the lighter body. This would be a good session-type porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Everything comes together pretty well overall. A little torn here as I think that yes, this IS a solid American Porter. That said, it's also a little overhyped as I can certainly find many better examples of the style. I kept wanting it to be thicker and more complex. Certainly wouldn't turn it down if offered."
"Overall- I've tasted porters of this quality for much higher prices, this was $3.99 from the grocery store and proves that high price doesn't equate to high taste"
""
"O: Great example of what a porter should be! Delicious beer, one of the best easily. Clean and done right. Not going to get much better than this."
""
""
""
""
"I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who likes darks."
""

"Overall a light and easy drinking porter that shows you don't need to have double digit alcohol numbers to be exceptional."
""
""
"Deschutes Black Butte is easily the best porter I've ever had, and up there as one of the best beers I've ever tasted. Awesome."
"O: I really like this beer. The flavors are right in my wheelhouse. I'd buy this beer often, when I was in the mood for a porter. Super drinkable and super delicious."
""
"Black Butte is bold, brash and unrefined porter in that typical old school, Pacific Northwest sort of way. If you are into that kind of thing, definitely give this beer a try."
"Overall: After drinking this, I'm definitely stoked to drink some of the Black Butte XXIII I received in a trade a few months ago- saving it for when I get a Black Butte XXIV and maybe XXV for a vertical. This staple beer is a nicely complex porter with a creamy mouthfeel that I don't get in most of the local porters in WI. It reminds me of O'so Night Train Porter but ends up being creamier and bringing some more complexity in flavour. Definitely worth the while and if I can choose a representative porter to be a fridge staple, it would probably be this one. (5)"
""
""
"O: I was waiting to be impressed by Deschutes, and this did it. Great flavor, loads of smell and looks fabulous. I dig it."

"O/D-Damn right this is a good drink of ale! This is my second Deschutes experience and both were definitely successful. This Porter sets itself apart from most by its fine flavors, textbook execution and delectable hoppy flavor in concordance with its chocolate and roast base. Would love another one of these."
"O: Very drinkable english style porter with some of the harsher hop flavors that help give depth to the roasted malts."
""
"O- Awesome porter. Sippable and savory. Very homey and cozy. Also, love the label's artwork. "
""
""
"The balance on this is well-crafted. Solid easy drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If I could get this around me I'd drink it all the time. This is a near perfect porter that has a perfect roasty flavor."
""
""
""
"O: This lovely porter is easy to drink in many settings. The roasted malt is the star with the toast and coffee overtones, but it is aided by the just-right blend of hops and carbonation to make a porter that leaves me wanting another."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very dark in apearance. The Smell is a bold blend of Coffee, Malt and a little bit of licorice. The taste is very smooth and creamy, a mixture of the above mentioned. Medium carbonation with a slight feel of the Hops. I would have to conclude this is the best Porter I have had the privaledge to review. Most other Porters I have had, have not blended the whole flavor as well as Deschutes brewery has done. Very excellent Porter."

"I'd prefer a more toasted malt aroma, but hey."

""

""

""
""
""
"It's a robust porter with great flavor."
""
""
"Pours chestnut in color with a frothy beige head that holds excellent retention & leaves chunky lacing on the glass. Aroma - wow chocolate! Not much else though - slight coffee, slight roast. It actually kind of smells like a freshly opened bag of chocolate malt. Tastes are chocolate, but barely roasted, nice balance of sweetness and bitterness, coffee and nut in there too. Mouth-feel is creamy & velvety smooth; nice carbonation. Overall, excellent representation of an American porter! Not a whole lot of complexity, but the chocolate flavor is fantastic. Definitely sessionable!"

" I will drink this beer with a meal, as an after work beer, pretty much whenever. It's got a great smell and a great flavor and it's priced well (In Wyoming, might be a bit more farther away)."
"Pours a couple of shades darker than cola brown topped with a one and half finger cream colored head. Average retention, spotty lacing. Roasted malts, hint of hops, maybe a touch of bakers chocolate and some light general sweetness. A bunch of roasted malt up front, burnt biscuit, some roasted coffee bean notes, and burnt brown sugar. Fantastic mouthfeel, very smooth with some creaminess on the edges moderate carbonation. An absolutely wonderful porter. Exceptionally drinkable and a brew that hits on all cylinders."

"O - Overall an excellent porter and I've finally found a match for my standard for the style Edmund Fitzgerald that I first reviewed back in 2005. Would love to try them both side by side. Can't go wrong either way."
""
"Overall- An excellent American Porter by Deschutes. I enjoyed the roasted malts and bitter cocoa flavours. For me, it is a complex porter that delivers on all fronts. By far, one of the best American Porters I have had in a while. Worth seeking out and glad to have found this in Calgary."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An elite porter. Not quite my gold standard of Founders Porter but this one is in the discussion."
""
""
""
"Overall: While this is not a bad beer by any means (in fact, it is actually quite a good beer), I imagine the annual release of Black Butte is a much better version of this simply from being a bigger beer. All I have to say on that front is, “ISO”. 16.5/20"

"Great stocker for the fridge, I like to have this one on hand because it goes well with red meat and its a high quality easy drinker. A full mark above Fat Tire but just as versatile, good intro beer for noobie craft drinkers. Its creamy, malty and it goes down easy. Doesnt weigh you down. I'd have it rated higher but I don't get any of the chocolate finish claimed on the bottle, its a mild malt and hoppy character. It's pleasant but not surprising. Still a great beer!"

"Wonderful vanilla, just like the aroma, on the palate. Little bits of cocoa help bring that vanilla up to the forefront. Zero roast or coffee on the palate which was unexpected. Light smooth carbonation and a medium-light body make this a smooth beer. It almost feels more boozy than it's moderate 5.2%, but that doesn't make it unenjoyable at all."

"Near jet black, one finger of tan/white head, some lace here as well. Nose is of roasted malt, chocolate, liquorice/anise herbal notes, coffee and a bit of hop as well. Taste is is roasty with a good deal of coffee flavour, chocolate and lightly smokey, liquorice, bitter hop mid palate, some more roast with some smoke and ash in the finish. Medium carbonation, medium body, good all around mouthfeel. A nice easy drinking roasted porter, worthy of repeat visits but still not as good as Founders when it comes to porter."

"Poured this American Porter from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a dark brown color, produced an outstanding tan head, featured excellent retention and some of the best lacing I have ever seen. The aroma contained sweet milk chocolate, roasted malt and some earthy hops. Full bodied, the first thing that hits you before even the taste does, is how smooth and creamy this beer is- A foundation of roasted grain, some chocolate, and coffee flavor to boot. The finish is semi dry with floral hops and alcohol as you swallow. Hands down, the best Porter I have ever tried."

But otherwise, an excellent brew that I'm very glad to have had the chance to sample. And I would drink it again, though hopefully without the strange appearance."

"Though I bought this beer in bottle, I poured it into a chilled/frozen glass that I had in my freezer from earlier in the day. This beer has a great initial taste, a little nutty but very subtle and delicious. This is followed by a SOLID chocolate aftertaste. It is almost like drinking the best cold coffee youve ever had. Simply the best Porter I have ever tasted. If you have the opportunity, buy it. You will surely not regret the purchase of this beer. Thank you Deschtes Brewery."

"Black Butte Porter should have been the official Miles Davis Bitches Brew. Not that shit brewed by that joke of a brewery on the east coast. Of course Sir Mix A Lot would be a 2nd option and a good option at that. Just depends on your mood."

"This might quite possibly be my favorite beer. I have had plenty of porters -- some are much more concentrated and heartier, some are more thin and extracted. This porter is the most balanced darker ale that I have ever tasted. I tried this beer in the bottle and the comparison was non-existent. Anybody who can find a Total Wine with this on the growler station will experience a life-changing brew. This beer is simply perfection."

"On tap at Falling Rock in Denver, CO. Pours black with creamy, long lasting off-white head. Aroma is bready, toasted malt, hints of coffee and dark fruit. Body is medium creamy and smooth. Taste is toasted malt, hints of coffee, chocolate and dark fruit. I expected much more from this brew."

"Black Butte Porter pours almost solid black, with just a few faint ruby highlights shining through. There's maybe two fingers of khaki colored foam capping the beer. Head retention is solid, if unspectacular, and lacing is a bit on the spotty side. The nose is highlighted by roasty dark chocolate. There's also a fairly noticeable coffee aroma present. The flavor is redolent of those same two, with coffee pulling a little closer to chocolate in terms of intensity. There's also a light bitterness, and a gentle, herbal hop finish. The body is a little bit surprising in how relatively dry it is. There's a little bit of sturdiness to support all the malt flavor, but it's very much light and lean for the style. I kind of like it though, makes the beer way more quaffable than porters tend to be. This is aided by the fact that the carbonation is well adjusted to still largely stay out of the way, adding just a little bit of life to the proceedings. There's nothing really fancy about Black Butte Porter, it's just a classic, well executed porter, and a beer I'd love to have available in my area."

"This is the complexity of malts, roasted dark flavors of coffee with cocoa and meaty, smoke-like aromas you crave in a craft Porter. The mouthfeel and finish are like smacking your lips after chomping a slice of creme brulee, leaving you to wonder if you just had some extra buttery toast and biscuits or had a sip of epic dark beer. The hop note of this beer is a perfect touch, only taming the malts somewhat to make it a wonderfully approachable dark beer. Two thumbs up, malt, stout, porter fans should definitely get some, you can thank me later."

"Black Butte is surely one of the best porters out there. Typical deep body with a nice and long-lasting head. Coffee and biscuit notes on the nose. It's got a mild hop character that peeks in every now and then just to add a little something extra. It's not in-your-face, but it's flavorful and balanced."

"O - This is one of the best porters I have had to date. It carries some notes from the Abyss that I loved: namely the soft and subtle characteristics which define perfect balance and completely refrain from being overwhelming. If this were in my local store I would not hesitate to say I would buy this over just about any other (other top porters in my books being the Fullers, Samuel Smith's and Edmond Fitzgerald). Bravo!"

"Dark brown to black in color with reddish hues on the edges of the glass. Poured with a short off-white foam that reduces to a wispy cap that leaves lots of sticky lacings on the glass. Dark roasted malt and dark chocolate aromas up front with fresh roasted coffee aromas underneath. Pleasantly smooth feel from start to finish. Roasted malt flavors layered over bitter hops layered over roasted coffee. Finishes dryly with a lightly burnt/black patent maltiness with hints of dark coffee."
""
"Morey’s Bottom Line: This is a good example of an American Porter to be sure. That being said, some of my personal favorites tend to push the limits by going big on the ABV or heavy on the malts. The cola flavor seemed to be a little dominate for my palate. A good beer, but it didn’t quite live up to my expectations."
""
""
"Overall- I'm not sure about this one. It was well balanced, but a tad weak in a couple aspects. A good beer, just not outstanding."
"Overall: Rich complex dark malts blend together perfectly. Bold, but never approaches harsh. If I didn't pay $5 (rip-off, I know) for the bottle I'd sit down with a 6-pack of this quite often."
"Overall whats not to like. Complex and deep in flavor. Pairs well with a good sharp cheddar."

"O – It’s so big and one toned I’m a little afraid of a stout from them being an imperial stout. It rings like a bell, one big strong note that slowly fades away and nothing else. I think it taste like a stout porter mix."

"Years ago, when I was attempting to come to grips with styles, I was particularly puzzled by the American Porter. Why do some seem like watered down stouts? What makes them different? If I had only encountered beers like this. This is a fantastic porter, and even better than Deschutes' Obsidian Stout in my humble opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I think I expected more with this one based on the rating. While it's not the most exciting beer, it is very very drinkable and well balanced. Maybe that's why it's so highly reviewed... just a solid very drinkable porter."

"O-This is a fine porter. Very balanced and drinkable. One of the best porters, if not the best porter I have had so far. I will buy again."

"Definitely worth a try and comes recommended...Cheers!!!"
""
""
"Somehow I still see this as underrated despite its high scores. For a standard, easy to find porter, I don't know how it gets better than this. This one pours a very dark opaque brown from the bottle, turning completely black as it accumulates in the glass. Great coffee and chocolate aroma, with some beautiful roastiness wafting up from my glass. Flavor is a coffee explosion, earthy, with a beautiful backdrop of roasty bittersweet chocolate. Full body with adequate carbonation--nearly feels like an imperial porter. Finishes clean. Nearly perfect for the style. All others get compared to this."
"O- Deschutes did a good job with this one. Think I'll keep a bomber of this in the fridge at all times."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The Cola flavor dominates with light notes of coffee and chocolate. Very easy drinking and refreshing little Porter."
""
"O: A seriously well-done porter, and one that I would gladly pick up again. Though it isn’t my favorite style, a cask of this would be an exhilarating find – or at least another bottle. Every porter brewer should strive to create something like this."

"Tastes like it smells, only not quite as firm because the back end runs a little thin. It's almost like they tried smoothing out the portery roughness at the beginning, trying to make it more sweet, but I kind of like a little bit of a challenge in my porter's back end. Still, solidly brewed, sessionable, and a nice complement to a meal."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a good example of both a porter and a beer that is better than the sum of its parts. No one thing stands out here but everything melds together well. Each of us agreed that this was second or third in the mix."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is without question, one that I'd look for again. Unfortunately, this is the last of many brews that were Christmas gifts - my wife did her homework on this one. Really an exceptional take on the style."

""
""
"Overall this beer is very smooth, easy on the palate, complex and incredibly enjoyable. I highly suggest that anybody who's a fan of porters, or beer in general, check this one out!"
"O- One hell of a porter to say the least. It's got sweet elements as well as the roasted to balance it out. Enjoy this one, I know I did!"
""
""
""
"I'm having almost zero luck finding a porter I well and truly like. I feel like if you're going to go the sweet route, go the sweet route and give it a little more chocolate-y goodness. Even a bittersweet like dark chocolate. It would compliment the semi-dry finish. But there's not nearly enough of any flavor that makes it stand out, so it just falls flat to me as a dark beer."
""
""
""
""
"O - This beer is awesome. 5%? I could drink this all night! The taste is sublime and the balance is absolutely fantastic! Closing on perfect for a porter!"
""
"Slightly drying with moderate carbonation and a medium-light body."
""
""
""
"O: The flavors are there, but they are far too weak in my opinion.. The mouthfeel is also quite thin. The aroma is pretty good, but the flavor is simply mediocre. Very disappointing after recently reviewing Edmund Fitzgerald, one of my favorite porters."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown with glints of red in the light. Has a creamy light tan head with decent retention. Rich lacing on the glass. Dark roasted malts, sorghum, and dark chocolate aromas. Nice, creamy mouthfeel. Dark chocolate, heavy cream, without the usual coffee acidity one gets from a porter like this one. Nice sweet lactose makes this a pillowy sweet porter. Very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is light, creamy and smooth, with low carbonation, a medium body and a bitter finish. A real nice porter that is sweet, bitter and tasty all at once and really enjoyable as it goes down. I recommend trying this as it went down easy and was very good overall."
""
""
"The aroma and flavor were quite boring. I only smelled a little nutty earthiness, and the taste was similar, with maybe faint notes of chocolate and molasses but overall quite tame and lifeless. I wish it was a little richer. What surprised me the most was its almost watery mouthfeel. This was a big letdown for me. I can’t imagine ever reaching for this one again, but a part of feels I should try it again just in case there was some funny business going on at the restaurant….my friend shared the same thoughts about it."

""
""
"One of the best beers I have had in a long time!!! I knew nothing about it when I purchased it but was pleasantly surprised once it hit my lips. Has a slight hoppiness at the front, with a smokey chocolate flavor on the back end. Full flavor yet very smooth. I have since been turned on to a lot of brews from Deschutes Brewery."
"Medium body, creamy due to the carbonation. Very easy to drink and enjoyable porter."
""
""
"I liked this much-heralded porter alright, but found it less and less appealing as I drank it. It looks great, smells good, but tastes just a bit above average. Would have enjoyed a bit more assertive roastiness and a bit less carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – This is absolutely an A List porter, no question about it. World Class. I need to find a place where I can obtain sixers of it, whether it be in pints or 12-oz. bottles. Once you've had this porter, you will compare all your other porters, before and after, to this one. Highly recommended."
""
""
""

"Light and drinkable. Subtle hints of coffee and chocolate, with a dry feeling that I usually associate with Nut Brown ales. Almost feels like a brown ale, actually."

""
""
"Monstrous! Great porter, definitely try and include in trades to people who like porters."
""
""

"I poured a bottle into a small tulip-shaped glass. It's a dark brown but not cloudy porter with about a half-inch lightest brown well-retained foamy head. I had trouble making out much of a smell (my own bad nose). The taste...mmm. Sweet, fizzy, complex hops,and a clean smooth aftertaste. Chocolate, cherry but light on fruit without phenols. I didn't detect any buttery flavors. Others said lightly chewy which is right on the mark with me. Bottom line: this is a delicious brew. Can I review it again and again?"
"I was very happy with this beer because I have had the BB XXII and expected this to be slightly below. In all seriousness, I enjoyed it more than the special release. Glad I have a few more left to enjoy."

"O - One of Deschutes best beers, very good among porters. I would get this anytime I'm in the mood for a porter."
"On tap at Dante’s in U district. Poured into a pint glass. Appearance is dark, almost black with a finger of light tan head. Ends up with a very pretty lacing. Aroma is smokey and malty, a bit more simple than regular stouts, but still has some things going on. The taste isn’t a surprise from the smell. Slightly bitter. Burnt and crispy. Coffee hits very strong near the end. Palate is a bit less viscous than I would like, but I guess that’s why it’s a porter. Overall, I’m glad they have this at Dante’s. It’s my drink of choice if nothing else looks good. It might not be as full bodied as I would like, but it’s a great drink none the less."
"An outstanding porter, one of my all-time favorites."

"Poured from 12oz bottle into tulip glass. Aroma is heavy chocolate coffee, sweet. Appearance is dark brown almost black with medium tan thick head. Taste is chocolate and coffee forward. Smooth and creamy. Sweet maltiness lingers as does a smooth easy coffee roast. Bit of black licorice. Palate is medium and good carbonation throughout. Overall this was an uninspiring porter for me."

"Pours a dark brown, almost black with reddish highlights. A 1 finger beige foam makes up the head that settles to a thing tight bubbled lace around the glass. A nice buttery coffee bean fills the tip of the nose, scents of sweet milk chocolate, slight caramel and toffee on the finish. Sweet chocolate on the tongue, bitter coffee on the finish, full of wonderful flavors in between, excellent. Medium on the body and feel, creamy, very sweet and bitter. Overall this beer is a winner, would love to be able to have this regularly."
""
""
"A good porter but not my favorite. The flavor seems kinda average with nothing exciting going on. The mouth feel is almost like a flat coca cola. Great airy head with a decent amount of lasting power. Not a beer I would pass up but don't go out of the way looking for it."
""
""
""
"Dark brown color with a small cap of tan head that left some sticky lacing behind. Roasty malts on the nose, notes of coffee and cocoa. Taste follows suit, with dark roasty malts, semi-sweet chocolate, and some coffee bitterness. Smooth and on the heavier side of medium-bodied. Simple formula, but a very good beer all around."
""
""

"O- I love this beer. I am not a big porter guy but this one does the trick. It has a scrumptious milk chocolatey taste and goes down easy compared to other porters I have tried. Very drinkable."
"D: love the flavor on this porter. lots going on, lots of complexity, but also super drinkable as a porter should be. glad i got a family member to bring this back for me!"
"Poured a deep brown with some mahogany highlights, clear body with a dense, yet very light tan head. A couple of fingers of head, leaves a wall of lacing solid retention. Nose has some rich milk chocolate, with a bit of bitterness, a touch of roast, some lactic notes and hops. Taste has a light sourness to start, which opens up into some chocolate, gentle coffee and roast. A bit of caramel and warm dark malt notes, leave a lightly bitter finish. Kinda sweet as well. Low carbonation and medium body, that's a bit cream and balanced. Flavourful and subtle, a very well done porter - something to be revisited several pints over."

"O - This beer really stands out for me. An amazing porter that is so easy to drink. For beer so readily available, this beer is fantastic. I know it doesn't have the sex appeal of limited releases but this is a must try."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall one of my favorite porters. It's my ""go-to"" porter when I'm at the bar. A great beer to use to introduce non-porter/stout drinkers to the type."

"Drink- I like this one alot. I am not always a fan of porters but when they are done right like this and like Samuel Smith. I will keep coming back to this one and Deschutes."

"Pours a black color. 1/4 inch head of an off-tan color. Good retention and great lacing. Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, slight dry hop, citrus hops, hint of chocolate, and a hint of spice/herb. Fits the style of an American Porter. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an low carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, hint of chocolate, hint of roasted malt, hint of dry hop, hint of oatmeal, citrus hops, and a hint of spice/herb. Overall, good aroma, feel, body, and blend."
"Overall this is a classic Northwest beer, one I should revisit more often. I see it as a direct ancestor of the new black IPA style."
"O: About what I was expecting due to the high reviews of this beer. Porters aren't really my style, but I would not mind having another pint."

"This is a truly great Porter that you can get your hands on easily. Classic creamy, chocolate/coffee taste. In this age of massive Imperial Stouts it's nice to kick back with one of these. Recommended to any fan of the style, or to any new BA looking to have a classic Porter. Cheers!"

"Overall- A good porter that relies on a slightly sweeter malt bill and chocolate to make it distinctive. Black Butte is not going to bring the roasted quality to win you over, but it is well made nonetheless."
""
"O- i really enjoyed this beer. and that is because honestly, i am not a fan of coffee so i was hesitant of this. the coffee and yummy roasted malt is blended perfectly in this. the only thing i was dissapointed about was when i was done with my beer :("

"At Capone's Black Friday, This poured out as a deep brown color with some red highlights, the head was very thin and didn't really have much retention or lacing. The smell of the beer was roasted and earthy on the nose. The taste of the beer had some nice roasted flavors with a touch of dark chocolate in the back end of the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was thin and dry. It was very drinkable. Overall this beer was pretty good for a standard porter."

"Pours a deep amber to black in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, notes of sweet chocolate and sweet coffee. In the taste, sweet mellow coffee and a nice roasted maltiness. A small hop like bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a lightly dry to sweet coffee like aftertaste. Big coffee, notes of chocolate, and a nice sweetness."
""
""
""
"Overall, a solid porter from Deschutes, one of the better sessionable porters out there. Nice to be able to get it year round too."

"Had this one on tap at redbones at their recent pacific northwest tap takeover. This beer pours a dark dark brown to almost black color with andecen sized light brown head. The smell is roasty witha hint of hops and no sweetness. The flavor follows suit with a nice roasted malt character and a hint of hop bitterness but low residual sugar. The mouthfeel is light with good carbonation bthe beer is good but lacks the body I would have liked."

"Pours a beautiful, beep brown with caramel-like hints around the edge through the light. Nice beige head and lacing that clings to the glass. Smells rich and complex; earthiness, floral notes, hops, coffee, chocolate malt... very nice. Taste is an absolute flavor bonanza of malted chocolate, fresh ground coffee, faint grassiness, and lively yet subtle hop finish. Slightly viscous on the palate, yet goes down so so easy. This is a unique porter, and the best of the style that I've had."
"definitely the best porter i have ever had, been my go to since i move to colorado in august. pours apparently black, but when held up to the light has a low red glow. nice 1.5 inch head that leaves good lacing on the glass. smells dry like an irish stout, chocolate malts no doubt, but not heavy in the nose. taste is not dry at all, rich and creamy with a finish that is just ever so slightly bitter from the hop additions. mouthfeel is creamy and on the bigger side of medium bodied. i could drink a 6er of this every day for the next 50 years, just complex but understandable, like a magician showing you the secrets. an epic epic porter"
"Overall, I think this beer hits the mark extremely well for the style. I generally tend to like slightly fuller, richer porters, but for a 5.2% a.b.v. porter, this is very well-crafted."
"Overall a darn fine porter. On the sweeter side, so hoppy porter-loers need not apply. Definitely fills the bill for me though."
"O - great porter, good overall flavor."
"I would welcome another one of these any time."
"O: This is one of my favorite Deschutes beers of all time. There isnt much to say, but one of the best beers on the market."
"An excellent take on the style. This is a really good porter. Classic, simple porter characteristics done correctly take the beer a long way."
"Definitely an excellent porter, and highly enjoyable."
"O- This is an amazing beer that is surprisingly drinkable with little to no traces of alcohol. I love this porter and it will continue to be stocked in my refrigerator."
"O- This is the brew that got me into good beer and is still my all time favorite. This is also the beer I most often recommend for people interested in getting a taste of what craft breweries have to offer and rarely have they been disappointed."
"This is a classic American porter and well deserving of the high marks."
"O - a good porter for sure, but it's no Edmund Fitz. Tastes almost like a clone, but still not the same as the original. A good beer, but not exceptional."
"O - A fine beer indeed. Best porter I've had to date."
"Pours a luscious dark black with a pleasing roast aroma. Lots of sharp, roasty notes come through on the taste, balanced by a welcomed sweetness. Nice mouthfeel, good body, great balance across the board. It’s the definition of a porter and as reliable as an old friend."
"Tim"
"O/D- A joy to drink, though this one may have some age on it. Super pleasant in the midst of a nasty wind advisory and chilly temperatures. Would drink another one in rapid succession, great suck cess Deschutes! And thanks, duff27."
"O: This is a classic for me. I go back to this beer ever fall. Love it!"
"Notes: Decent roast, nice complementary flavors and complexity. Very drinkable, especially for a porter that has intense flavors, but that’s partly because its only medium bodied. Hops are present but delicate. It has the potential for something special but only almost there. Really good nonetheless, and for the price it’s a serious value."
"Still, the taste is a bit flat overall. The malty bitterness just hangs on my palate and doesn't do much. I'll have to try a draft of this next time I'm in PDX -- seems like a fresh draft could really bring out a lot of the flavors here. Much lighter mouth-feel than I would have expected/wanted. Thin, almost a little too watery. Still, a very drinkable, solid porter."
"O: Buy it. Wonderful beer and one of my favorites."
"Drinkability is great. One of my favorite session beers to just sit around and drink."
"D-Overall this was a good porter. It felt a little thin for me. I feel like Funky buddah has ruined most of my porter experiences. This is def. a good porter but just missing a little more body and a little more flavor to make this something i will get again."
"Black Butte pours out a deep dark brown with a lightly chocolate colored head on top. The head retention is exceptionally nice and I found a decent amount of lacing on the glass throughout the tasting. The smell of this beer is deeply roasty with a great deal of dark chocolate and some light coffee and alcohol notes in the back. The taste of the beer is similarly chocolatety and is paired with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. There's also a slight amount of hop bitterness on the back on the tongue on the swallow, but it's not an off-putting amount. Overall, this is a great classic porter."
"A really good porter. I will be buying this again and adding it to my favorites."
"O: As always, a great porter. Bottles down in SoCal have been hit and miss as of late, due to freshness, and this beer fades in the bottle after a few months... So, sadly, sometimes a ""on the shelf"" buy results in a lackluster taste. Here on draft, this is fresh, and reminds me how much I like this porter."
"Very, very good porter. One of the better ones I've had, honestly. Full of character, but not too heavy in any one characteristic, so it keeps it interesting and fresh."
"As far as your basic American Porter goes, I think this is about as good as it gets."
"Taste starts out with a bit of a dry cocoa flavor, light dark roasted malt bitterness evens out any sweetness, finishes incredibly dry, carbonation is quite present and very very soft, subtle nuttiness in the aftertaste."
"O: I’ve had this many times and it’s still one of my favorite go-to beers and porters. This is definitely one of the best and slightly underrated beers by Deschutes."
"O: I think the style is greatly represented here, but like all beers there is always room from improvement. This is one of the better porters I have had. I am not necessarily a huge fan of the style but I think theyt did a good job with this one. My regret is that I tryed this in September and not January. I like the style better in the winter myself. First one from Deschutes and won't be my last."
"OVERALL: There is a lot about this beer to be appreciated, in particular, the look and smell are outstanding, but that sweet tart finish really turned me off. It did become less of a factor as I worked through the beer, but it was still there at the end unless I threw the sip down quickly without allowing it to sit on my tongue."
"Overall this is the best standard American Porter on the planet. I have had their reserve/anniversary series amped up porters and I can appreciate how this base recipe was used to inspire those big massive gems. If this was available local to me I would drink it like water and would be a staple in my fridge. I love Deschutes and haven't had a bad drop of beer from them yet."
"I have to admit, I’ve had the Black Butte anniversary beers many times, but skipped over this base. A mistake, obviously. It’s a good’n."
"I give it a overall of 4.5 one of the best Porters I have had in a long time. If I could buy a case in Pa I would be on my way to the distrbuter right now. If you can try it go for it! This is One Really great Porter and one you would want to have around forever!"
"In all, a very good beer that I'll buy again sometime."
"Overall this was an ok porter… not terrific but not bad by any means. Give it a try once if it’s reasonable."
"Poured from a 32 oz. growler into a pint glass. Poured straight down the middle of the glass, beer gives about 3"" of solid head. Pretty much downhill from there. The smell is nearly completely muted. Outside of carbonation and some malt, there's really nothing there. The taste to me is pretty bland. There's not a whole helluva lot going on here. Again, I don't detect too many distinct flavor profiles. Some hints of coffee, toasted malt. The mouthfeel is where this bottoms out. It's highly carbonated, and extremely astringent. There's absolutely no joy behind having this in your mouth. I'm wondering if Black Butte XXIII is anything like this. I hope to hell not."
"great porter, one I would not mind having a six of during a sunday, although im sure the bootles pale in comparison to this tap serving. Butte deserves more chatter in beer circles like Edmund and Founders porter get."
"Will certainly drink again as a fairly low abv sessionable Fall beer. A nice beer to hand out to newbies while watching football this season."
"One of my fav Descheutes brews that is accessible and one of the better Porters out on the market I would have to say."
"This is a nice porter. The roasted and chocolate flavors are nicely balanced. Hops are fairly faint on the palate, but the underlying sweetness is just enough."
"Overall: Respectable porter."
"O: One of the best, if not thy best porter I've had so far. Very enjoyable brew. It's the definition of smooth. Packed with many flavors, this is tasty. Yes I would buy again and recommend."
"O. Awesome beer not much else you could ask for from a porter."
"D: So wonderfully balanced and deep for a porter. This beer just beckons you to drink. Especially delicious as it warms up a bit. Well done and so glad to have this one again after so many years! Overall the best porter I have ever experienced!"
"O-A great porter, possibly the best I've had so far."
"o - great beer, a porter that most will enjoy even if your not a fan of porters"
"Overall I must say that I have been drinking this for six or seven years and have loved it from day one. I always just drink this from the bottle, but poured it for this review. With it being so great out of the bottle it makes it a great beer to take to a get together. No glassware needed and the BMC guys wont touch it. Ha! Ha! win, win. This overall score reflects everything. Taste, Availability, Drinkability and Price."
"Overall: Okay, but not a good value. I expect more from a porter."
"12 ounce bottle, best by 10/03/11. Pours clear dark brown color with a small, fairly dense 1 finger off white head with good retention that reduces to a ring of lacing. A small bit of lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of big caramel, roasted malt, dark fruits, chocolate, and vanilla. Decent aromas with decent strength. Taste of tons of roasted malt, caramel, chocolate, bitter coffee, and some vanilla. Decent amount of bitterness on the finish that lingers with chocolate, coffee, and roasted flavors. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a nice creamy and smooth mouthfeel. A small amount of prickliness from the carbonation, but does not detract from the mouthfeel. Very smooth and easy drinking. No alcohol noticed in the taste or finish as expected. Overall, a very nice porter; my first from Deschutes as well."
"o - maybe it's just the nitro tap, but this was a fantastic beer. thoroughly enjoyable and highly recommended. pairs especially well with the beef brisket sandwich."
"O - OK porter, but I expect a little more. Kinda watery and lacking a big bite. But... Good drinking porter. Smooth, and drinkable. I have had better more robust porters.. but.. this is a good example of old style porters."
"Black Butte Porter is a black bodied brew; when held to the light, the bottom of the glass shines amber, but the rest remains opaque. Topping it off is a medium sized tan head, which populates the glass with a nice sheet of lacing. The nose is a big and bold chocolate and roasted malt scent, maybe just a slight touch of coffee and hop as well. Wow, the taste is very large. Rich malt profile, with a caramel start, quickly supplanted by a chocolate essense and followed by a subtle and refined roasted malt finish. Winds up incorporating some fruit tones, just a touch of coffee, a fair amount of honey, the hops are nice and floral. Nice smooth and creamy, medium bodied mouth."
"Served to me at City Tap House. Pours a dark brown with decent head and nice noticeable carbonation. Smells of mostly roast with some coffee and some chocolate. Tastes much more chocolate upfront with roast complimenting it quite well and a bit of some acrid taste that is nice and subtle. Feels medium bodied, maybe even a little light given its dark complexity. Overall, an excellent beer. I dig the Robust Porters and cannot believe it took me this long to finally try this wonderful brew."
"The mouthfeel is great. It's not too crisp (or too carbonated), and is similar to a stout in that it's a very smooth mouthfeel. It really complements the taste very well."
"mouthfeel - a little gritty. creamy but a bit light at the same time"
"O - A very solid porter, but the thin mouthfeel leaves it a step below the best."
"The smell was good, I mostly get dark chocolate, coffee and roasted malts. Mouth feel was good, medium thickness, a little thinner than a stout. The taste is pretty good, it seemed a little bit more flavorful than I remembered, I get some roasted malts, with a dark chocolate and coffee aftertaste which lingers for a bit, very good. Overall this was pretty fantastic, I ended up having a couple of them."
"O: Really is greatly balanced. flavors are rich yet somehow subtle, easy to drink. my go to dark."
"Pours a dark, near black color, brown highlights against the light with cap of off-white head. Scent is moderately roasted with notes of sweet milk chocolate, some notable earthy and lightly fruity hop notes in the background. Taste well balanced between the sweet and roasty, neither overpowers. Solid notes of milk chocolate and some dark fruit appear before a kiss of earth and a quickly splash of citrus. Medium bodied, a tad thicker than other porters, carbonation in check. A solid traditional porter which does not attempt to be bolder than the style dictates."
"Overall - Nice, easy drinking porter. A little too easy drinking, perhaps, but nice."
"Silky, creamy, and perfectly textured, this mouthfeel can't be beat. This gives Edmund Fitzgerald a run for its money in the ""My Favorite Porter"" race. It leaves slick chocolatey and roasted flavors on my palate. Delicious all around."
"Pours a clear dark brown with a small tan head. Roasted barley, chocolate, and coffee with roasted root vegetables, lettuce, celery, and corn husk aroma. Taste follows aroma well. Smooth in the mouth. Nice roasty toasty brew. Quaffable and well rounded."
"M: So incredibly smooth! It even was delightful going down in 37˚ C weather and the last little warm drops were even delightful."
"Well built porter, and highly drinkable. I'd have this one again."
"Dr: Average ABV, easy drinkability, high quality, and a low price make this beer one any beer fanatic would enjoy."
"UPDATED 9/12: Had another chance. Same verdict: Meh."
"O - Definitely my only ""real"" go-to beer. Always awesome!"
"Overall this is a great porter. Black Butte has a lot of great qualities with none of them overwhelming. The balance and consistency of this beer is amazing. Very smooth and drinkable; it’s difficult to set the glass down."
"overall and outstanding porter wish I could get more of easily"
"O: This is one of the best examples of a porter I've ever had. I would recommend it to everyone wholeheartedly; try it! It gives a pleasant drinking experience through and through. The only fault I could find was the poor head retention, but it excels so much in every other department that it's easy to forget(and this coming from someone who loves a deep head). What sets it apart from the rest is the perfect balance and smoothness that I can't reiterate enough."
"Overall - Overall a very nice porter. The first time I had this I was actually pretty blown away. At the time I had not been much into dark beers at all and it was really a wake up call that there were so many other, different things out there that I might enjoy besides Pale Ales and IPAs, etc. Maybe I'm partial because Black Butte Porter brings back fond memories of good friends and simpler times. Maybe I'm partial to beers from the PNW, my future home. Maybe I'm partial because I love XXI so much. Maybe Black Butte Porter is just a very good example of the style, up there with the likes of Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald. You be the judge."
"Note: This brewer date stamps, this bottle was best by 10/3/11."
"O- A great porter, very tasty and drinkable and a great representative of the style. This is the perfect beer to give to that friend who is scared of dark beers. Another solid offering from Deschutes."
"O: Very drinkable, but I wasn't impressed with the mouth feel of this particular pint."
"O: A solid porter that hits the style marks perfectly. The smoothness and creaminess are a must in Porters for me and this delivers. A cut above most with a decent level of complexity and overall ""it works"" in the flavor profile. I'd definitely drink this if it were available to me, but I wouldn't say it's necessarily worth trading for (which I did, but as an extra might make more sense)."
"Pours very dark brown and smells heavily of roasted malts and molasses. The flavor is heavily dominated by roasted malts, but the beer also offers some complexity with notes of chocolate, molasses, nuts, fruit (prune?) and nice balance of hops in the finish. This is actually a very nice beer; even though it’s dark, it’s fairly light bodied and very drinkable. A very nice example of a well-balanced porter, perhaps slightly on the malted side, but I enjoy that."
"This is a very good porter. Medium dark color and thin dark head with aromas of roasted malts. Flavors of dark chocolate, bittersweet, and full bodied mouthfeel. It also went well with Kobe beef burger with blue cheese we had at the Lake Tahoe Shakespeare Festival."
"A fairly decent beer, though I probably won't seek it out again."
"Overall. Easy drinking porter. Great stuff from a reliable brewery."
"Overall: A solid beer from a solid brewery. I enjoy a good porter every now and then, and enjoyed this one."
"o - overall solid porter, nothing earth shattering, but again, deschutes continues to impress with good beers across the board."
"In another era, dark and roasty beers like this would have been the norm. While it's unfortunate that porters aren't quite as commonplace nowadays, I doubt the beers then were anywhere near as clean and gratifying as the beers we have now. I bet if someone from that period had a taste of Black Butte their head would spin. It's an exceptionally nice porter."
"O: Stunning porter. As far as I'm concerned this is the benchmark for a nice lightweight and smooth porter. This is easy top 3 - I would put it up there with Founder's Porter."
"Pours a thick mocha head with the beer itself being nearly pitch black but with tinges of red. The head quickly fades and minimal lacing is present. The smell is of caramel, chocolate, malt, a touch of hops...smells like sees candy. The taste is sweet with chocolate and carmel predominant with just a kiss of hops. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall a fantastic porter."
"A light, highly-drinkable and well-balanced porter. The combination of light flavour and moderately drying finish keeps you sipping. Not necessarily interesting or complex, just very well made. One of the more drinkable dark beers I've had; a six pack of this would be no problem to finish off in an evening."
"O-wow this went down almost too quickly. this is such an easy drinking porter. i honestly thought it got better as i drank it. i could consume many more."
"O: another solid brew from Deschutes, I don't think that they make BAD beer, awesome stuff!"
"Enormous amounts of chocolate, smoke, and roasted malts. Mild hop bitterness and thick mouthfeel. Very easy to drink for such a thick beer, it is thick but not heavy. This is one of the craft beers that I use to convert both wine and bud drinkers."
"had on tap at the flying saucer htown from notes, Deep brown 1 finger of good head with solid retention, caramel malt dominates the nose with some roasted characters, subtle chocolate brownie, not much of any hops, coffee flavors are present, medium body that is creamy and smooth which goes down easy without much carbonation. good brew definitely get it again and recommend for an easy porter."
"I was expecting more from this beer given its A- overall and A+ by the Bros. I was expecting a porter that was world class. This beer was good, but still fell short of my expectations. There were no stand out qualities that set this beer apart from others I've had. Things I enjoyed were the dry finish and the relatively low abv."
"Black Butte is one of my all time favorite porters. This is one of the beers that converted me to craft beer. I highly recommend it."
"O: Solid brew, but reminds me too much of its stout cousin."
"Serving type: Bottle"
"Ok, my bottle review and this fresh tap review are night and day. Tap version is sooo much better. Before this, Edmund Fitz. from GL was my favorite porter, but I now believe this is a better beer....hoppier to boot. I just can't get over how great this was, awesome. I believe this has now just supplanted Edmund Fitz as the best everyday porter out there. Kudos Deschutes, I am now a huge fan."
"Very nice drinking beer. Well rounded flavors. Beautifully balanced. Very drinkable."
"Overall this is an incredible porter. Ranks up there with my favorites."
"D - Well balanced brew, not too heavy, one could definitely drink a few of these and be very content."
"This is a good shelf beer. Have had it several times. Pours a medium/dark with ruby light that sneaks in from the light at the bottom of the glass. Medium bodied with lights hints of malt and coffee. Well balanced beer. Light/good head that lingers throughout. Have had straight from the bottle as I had no choice. Most times served in a tulip glass."
"O: I'll be drinking this one frequently on the West Coast. Not quite as good as my standbys Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald or Smuttynose Robust Porter, but a very solid beer."
"O- Highly enjoyable, highly drinkable. Between this, Red Chair, Green Lakes, and the others I've sampled, Deschutes' 6pk offerings are some of their best. Would love to be able to buy this locally."
"simply the perfect porter. dethrones founders porter on the top of my list. it's roasty and malty enough, with the great coffee/espresso notes shining through with a great chocolate flavor as well. it's creamy and perfectly delicious. i'm really sad about this one not making it eastbound."
"O- I've seen this many times at the places I frequent when I purchase beer. This tasted average and I felt like I was cheated. Let's just say that it will stay on the shelves when I purchase more beer. "
"O: A nice, solid beer here. Not much to say that hasn't already been said. Easy drinking with a nice flavor profile."
"Tastes are, well, semi-sweetened dark syrups, burnt toasts, crusts, soy, waffles, edgy hops, crispness, lavender, spring rolls, hidden alcohol, bitter finish and some roast on the tippy-top of the tongue. Really good. Available just about everywhere."
"O - Pretty good for the standard porter. Chocolaty and bready with nice hoppy flavors; not too shabby."
"For anyone who lives in Oregon, or the Pacific Northwest, this is a classic brew! This porter pours with a beautiful dark brown ""beer with a spoon"" type of appearance. The taste is robust and wonderfully malty. It starts off with a punch of hops, the middle is malty and thick and finishes with a roasted malt flavor with a hop taste the builds off the end. I've had this off tap and out of the bottle. I prefer it off tap but pouring out of the bottle evokes the same yummy appearance and aromas."
"All 5s across the board."
"OVERALL: Gets a lot of praise in the porter category, but doesn’t stand out in the style. Perfectly average porter. Needs a little more flavor to make it worthwhile. Perhaps another bottle down the road will make me change my mind, but for now, not one I’ll need to seek out. Thanks again guys."
"O: overall, this beer is a good porter nbut it's also a bit of a letdown. Our localngreat lakes Edmund Fitzgerald puts this one to shame IMO."
"D/O- Flagship for the style? I wouldn't argue against it. Highly recommended for any straight porter fan or as a gateway to anyone new to the style. Easy drinking, low ABV, with tons of flavor."
"O: An excellent Porter. Just a superb drinking beer. The beer that put Deschutes Brewery on the map I've heard."
"O- One of the best porters I've had. A classic example of the sum of the beer being greater than one individual part. I was really amazed at how refreshing this brew was and I wish I could have this in my fridge at all times. Let's go Deschutes!"
"Overall: Its good but not the best in the style. No frills which I like, nothing added. I enjoyed it."
"Poured a pitch black with a light brown head that left some lacing. It smells of sweet chocolate and espresso coffee. The taste is quite bitter, like coffee. Hops are detectable, but the flavour is masked by the strong coffee flavour. The mouthfeel is very thick. The aftertaste is mildly astringent. Overall, it's a pleasant beer. Nothing like a nice thick, pitch black, coffee-tasting beer."
"D – Easy drinking porter can easily have more than of these in an evening. I recommend trying it if you like the style"
"Overall- Good solid porter. This one is better than some I have had and not as good as others. You can never go wrong with a Black Butte Porter 4/5"
"Deschuttes Black Butte Porter is a beer that I will always order if I find it on draft. However, it was only briefly available last year during Philly Beer Week here in Philadelphia and since then I've only had it when traveling or from trades. This is a very dark brown beer with a beautiful khaki head that slowly dissipates while leaving lacy draping foam on the sides of the glass as you drink it. The beer smells and tastes roasty but without the astringent burnt flavors. There is a nice grainy, almost nutty malt flavor but there is very little residual sweetness and great balance. A very good example of the style. I would prefer a bit more toasted malt and chocolate but other than that not much more to complain about."
"Appearance is near black with a thin head. BBP smells of nuts, chocolate, coffee. The taste has more chocolate, the coffee is fairly low key, a good amount of roasted malts hits the palate as well. MF is medium with a creamy texture. This is a nice porter that I do not have access to in my home state of CT and was happy to have the opportunity to enjoy it."
"A decent porter. All in all, the variety of malty flavors do work pretty well together. The drawbacks are a little too much of an alcohol bite and a slight lack in hop bitterness."
"O: I am loving drinking this beer. I wish that it was available to me locally. If it were, my fridge would never be without it. Well hopefully one of these days. Anyway, the next time I am somewhere I can get it, I am going to. Excellent!"
"O: One of the best porters I've ever had. Quite drinkable."
"Overall - a fine porter. I may prefer Great Lakes' and Smuttynose's takes on the style, but this is still solid."
"Pours a dark coffee brown with a finger and a half of nice foam. Smell is roasted and chocolate malts with a slight burnt note. Taste is good, clean roasty malt. Solid carbonation on a medium body. Overall, this is a very drinkable porter that would pair excellently with a variety of foods."
"Pours brown with a dark ruby edge with no head when it was delivered to my table. Faint notes of roasted malts and coffee, with a sour smell. Taste was just not good and feel that either there was an issue with glassware or the beer was infexted as it was very lean and watery and had a sour finish. Wouldnt mind trying again but cant do anything outside of considering this beer average and based on reviews that is a shame."
"D&Overall Notes: This and SN's Porter are the two American Style Porters that duke it out for my favorite. Both are world class, and I feel I really don't have to choose, as to me, Black Butte is a bit more of a hybrid porter, with characteristics of an English and American porter. Overall, this an awesome, drinkable porter. The flavors are just right, and while I complained a little about the carbonation above, this beer is by no means watery, and is a sheer joy to drink."
"World class brew here for sure!"
"Overall a very enjoyable and drinkable porter."
"This brew pours a dark cherry cola hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a creamy two finger head and lacing here and there,the smell is very nice with aromas of dark belgian chocolate,bitter milky coffee and fruity hops,it has a rather smooth light bodied well carbonated mouthfeel and has tastes of bitter milky coffee first up followed by some mocha and finished with a slight hoppy fruitiness that is slightly bitter and overall its definately a nice hoppy american porter cheers."
"A solid beer that with 5.2% ABV you could drink a few and not have a problem."
"O: Better than most of the porters I've had to this point. The watered down thing I normally experience is non existant. Roastiness and dryness takes over."
"An extremely delicious porter that packs a lot of flavor in a small package. This is the type of beer that converts people to craft. Well done!"
"O: I have never been much of a porter guy, but if I can find others like this Deschutes Black Butte Porter, I'd certainly try them."
"Overall-A pretty tasty porter, but not quite as good as Edmund Fitz and Founders Porter."
"an excellent porter. and another winner from deschutes. they are starting top push into my group of favorite breweries."
"Overall this is a great porter and one of my all time go to beers. It tastes good, its a great session beer because its so easy to drink and its widely available all over the northwest at reasonable prices. So if you find yourself in the NW drink this you will be happy you did."
"O - Loved this beer and could drink it all night long."
"O - This is a solid porter with a unique flavor. Very enjoyable."
"Overall Drinkability - Love it. One of the best stouts/porters I've had."
"O: This is a really nice, malty beer that could be consumed easily and consistently; just a nice, simple porter"
"Dark, dark brown almost red-ish black color with a white head. The head stuck around for a while. Nice looking, inviting beer. Chocolate, roast and some coffee come through in the nose. Smell develops nicely as this beer warms up. Tastes malty and roasty with that continued coffee flavor balanced with a nice mild hop to keep it in balance. Incredibly easy to drink, very tasty beer that I encourage everyone to try. Wonderful beer, I am going to try to make a point to enjoy this one on tap more often."
"Black with tan head, porter classic. The aroma is subtle and bready, malty wth subtle chocolate notes. Creamy and soft texture, great balance of roasted notes, malt and fruitiness. Very easy drinking and satisfying. Excellent porter."
"O - A very good porter I will absolutely drink again and a great session beer, this beer surpasses my past porter experiences to make my top of the style list 4.5"
"O - The porter is one of my favorite styles of beer and this is an excellent porter from Deschutes. I recommend!"
" The mouthfeel is light and a bit too carbonated. But, it's chalky, which I like because of the earthiness. The finish of Black Butte is amazing because there are no lingering off-flavors. This is a very smooth beer. I will definitely buy this again. Since this beer has some ashy volcanic flavors I think it could actually work as a summer Porter."
"very sessionable and tasty enough to be respected and recommended. very nice porter."
"O- A nice porter with good flavor, but nothing too memorable. Very drinkable at 5.2%"
"D - this is a really solid porter. Lots of rich chocolate makes this a perfect desert beer for chocolate lovers. Big thanks to websherpa for the chance to try this one. Another solid brew from deschutes!"
"Dark Brown with light brown around the edges. Thin Cap. Aroma smells of lactose, cereal grains, and roasted malts. Flavors come through a bit more roasty and with more coarse chocolate with some bright fruits thrown in there also. Drinks almost like a dark pale ale in that it has a balance in there and isn't dead set on the roasted malt side of porters. The carbination keeps things a bit brighter too as does the med-light mouthfeel. Overall impression is of a great Porter that i would keep stocked if it was a local."
"Delicious, very similar to Deschutes' Obsidian Stout, with less hoppiness (and alcohol) than Obsidian."
"OK, I'm drinking this while listening to Aqualung, so it's a little hard to concentrate on the Beer. Good aroma, from what I can smell. My sense of smell is not the greatest. Strong coffee flavor, decent aftertaste. One of my favorite porters, and also one of my favorite beers. Very drinkable any time of the year."
"Pours a semi-transparent dark mahogany - wasn't able to get much of a head, but so far, so good. Smoky aroma has tones of molasses and sweet chocolate. Smoky, chocolaty, slightly sweet taste has hints of malt and molasses. Texture is smooth yet lively and quite fizzy."
"First thing I noticed was the mouth feel, very silky in texture. Some trace of chocholate. Balance hop/malt finnish. Head retention i thought could have been a little better at 60 deg. All n all I would buy the beer again."
"Drinkability: Highly Drinkable. Might pass up a new beer for this one."
"This is actually fairly good for drinkability, but I am sort of let down by this which really knocks my score down. I thought this would have been a lot better after what I smelled on the nose."
"D - Robust porter, expected flavors, strong in all the right places but dynamic and exciting at the same time."
"D: Very enjoyable and well-balanced porter; an excellent example of the style."
"Thanks again to Shir0045 for the last of the trade."
"D-I could sit down and drink a few of these beers without paying much attention to how much I had. This is a wonderful beer, great introduction to a Porter for me."
"Drinkability: All the flavor and aroma builds quick and washes away quickly, leaving you wanting for more."
"D: This is extremely drinkable, even sessionable. At only 5.2% alcohol (with no hint of it whatsoever), I could see myself drinking many a pint of this over the course of the evening. Without being able to purchase this locally, I reserve the right to change this should I find out it's excessively expensive, but as of now, I wish I could get this without having to trade for it."
"D- Interesting. It's not as hoppy as I would expect, but a decently complex flavor that I can take some more of."
"D - this went down so well, I would have have another but there were so many beers on tap to be sampled, but this was probably the best of the bunch"
"D-Very good for the style but heavy and only good for a couple"
"D: I always enjoy a Black Butt, just like they say ""Once you go black you never go back"" to the mainstream beers that is. I won't ever go back. I'd rather pay a bit more for the good stuff. Drink up!"
"D-drinkable. Very nice, but no edmond fitzgerald."
"Pours a very dark reddish brown. A decent amount of off-white head that sticks around for quite a while. Smells very malty and sweet. There is a sweetness to it that perplexes me. Very highly carbonated with lots of great roast on the tongue. Hardly a porter. Almost closer to a brown ale. Very smooth and crisp. Overall very tasty."
"D - A very tasty porter and another winner from Deschutes. I have yet to try anything from these guys that is sub-par. Highly recommended to any fan of porters, and an easily drinkable dark beer."
"Best beforeJune 12, 2011 Bomber pours a dark cola coloured brown into a big glass. Minimal tan head that disapates quickly and probablyserved too cold. Lots of coffee and chocolate malts on the nose. Sweet toffee and mild hop also come through. Brown sugar and cold coffee flavours with light body but plenty of sweetness. Lots of carbonation and quite refreshing. Creamy mouthfeel and slightly sour on the finish. This is very easy to knock back rather quickly."
"Edit: My second time around with this beer really changed my opinion of it. I don't know why I wasn't so impressed with it at first, but as it stands right now, this is one of the best porters I've ever had. I have bumped up my review score from 'B+' to 'A.'"
"12 oz. bottle with clearly-marked freshness date. Brewed with chocolate and crystal malts, hopped to 30 IBUs and kraeusened for conditioning. Pours nearly completely black, clear, with reddish edges and a thin tan head that attempts to lace. Somewhat tame bouquet contributes dark malts, light fruit and perhaps some hops. Tastes of dark chocolate, mild roast, licorice, fruit, and hops that contribute a moderate bitterness. Well-balanced, and it starts light and tingly, dry with a quick finish, but fills out and has a more roasty linger when warmer. Not too bad, but there is a pervasive rubbery note that makes me think ""autolysis."" Other than that, certainly a nice porter, but I must say I prefer their stout."
"Awesome malt profile and very easy drinking. This is one of my go-to porters. Wonderful."
"O - Black Butte Porter is ultimately reminiscent of a charismatic, but vacuous-minded school boy, who at the end of the year hands his report card to his tutor who looks at him with a magnanimous smile and simply writes ""a joy to teach, but could do better""."
"D: High since it's very light and goes down easy. Hm, I dont see why people really dig this beer, it seems pretty average at best to me."
"Taste is a balance of dry bitter dark roasted malt, with some sweetness at the end. Very smooth easy drinking moutfeel.. lower carbonation."
"Much thanks to Justin for this extra! Poured very aggressively for a delayed 2-finger head, reduces to strong 1-finger head, average lacing, color is black. Aroma begins with lightly roasted malts and ends with heavily roasted malts. Taste of enormous dark malts (for a 5.2% ABV), touch of smoke and coffee, finishing with toffee. As the beer descends down the glass, vanilla hits the nose, and possibly some oak, but it could possibly be the excellent malt profile tricking me. Coffee sticks to the palate, but is dwarfed by excess of carbonation. This beer is amazing. I needed it today."
"I am a fan of Deschutes Brewery products. It was time to give the Black Butte Porter a try. The Black Butte Porter flows from the bottle with a deep dark near black color. The head is thin, but lasts around the edges. A highlight is the aroma, which is bountiful with roast malt and coffee, really nice. Time for a sip. Yum! Very nice balance of a mild sweetness and a roast overtone with a long coffee finish. The Black Butte Porter makes for a great dessert beer to be slowly savored."
"Drinkabilty - Low alcohol, smooth, tasty, all you want in a beer to drink 3,4 or 5 of in a sitting. This is a very special beer, unique flavor and a pleasure to drink. Top porter for sure, will have again."
"Notes: I got a lot of earthy kind of flavors out of this porter. A really nice porter that went down quite easy. Nothing special about this, just a tasty porter at a good price. Not a huge chocolate or coffee bomb but a nice balanced porter."
"oh so drinkable, this is one beer i would definatly always have in my fridge if it was available to me. goes down super easy, full of flavor, and doesnt fill you up."
"D: An overall great beer. Will definitely have to buy a few of these if I come across it again."
"D - Easy drinking beer as expected for the style, carbonation is only thing holding it back."
"Man, this is so smooth and easy to drink too, easily sessionable beer for sure. Simply fantastic."
"D: Like I stated above, one of my favorite craft brews. Delicious."
"2 things about this beer. 1. This Beer Is Amazing. 2. This Beer Is Amazing. So many smokey malts for a home-brewer to appreciate. Just a great beer overall. Definitely one that both BA's and casual drinkers will enjoy. Not much of a review to give, just go buy it and see for yourself. Great smell and look to this beer. Some floral hops at the end. This beer is so earthy. Again the malts are just soo amazing. Go buy it. Don't think about it. Buy it."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, dated best by 4-3-11, into a pint glass. Appearance is a really dark brown, close to black. Good ring of lacing and tan colored head. Aromas are an enjoyable, smooth roasted malt and hints of chocolate. Flavors are of bitter chocolate, touch of coffee, with a little bit of hops in the finish. Definately not an ""over the top"" version, which has become more the norm, but a very classic well done porter with all the flavors and the texture you would expect. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, lightly carbonated. This porter is incredibly well done and it's one I wish I could drink more often."
"Pours a half finger head, disappears quickly, kinda disappointing. Color is pitch black. Good lacing throughout the glass. Smell is of roasted malts, maybe a hint of chocolate malts as well. Coffee is also very present in the smell. Mouthfeel is very very smooth, probably the most surprising part about this beer. Very drinkable, nothing offensive with this beer. Taste is a little disappointing as well, all the flavors are there - the roasted malts, the coffee, the hint of chocolate, but it didn't hit me the way I thought it would. Don't get me wrong, it's a great taste, it's just that it tastes a little watered down, not as powerful of a taste as I was expecting. Oh well, still a pretty good beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is right in the middle between light and medium bodied with ample carbonation. Not the smoothest or creamiest that I've had but good nonetheless. It is an extremely drinkable beer that packs a lot of flavor for the moderate ABV. It's been quite some time since I've had it and I'm impressed. I don't keep any ""staple beers"" in my fridge but I think this may become the first. Kudos to Deschutes."
"I like this beer a lot."
"Drinkability is good, the alcohol very well hidden and 1 of these does call for another."
"Medium bodied and extremely smooth. This is my favorite porter to date and wll be difficult to unseat. Deschutes is quickly moving up my list of favorite breweries. Get this if you've never had it."
"Slight chocolate and malt flavoring with a good mild aftertaste. Just the right amount of strength and carbonation to create a very drinkable porter I would gladly purchase again!!"
"D- Was looking forward to this one. I'd try it again, but maybe I'm a bit spoiled by Edmund Fitgerald."
"An excellent, low-abv porter -- powerful, smooth, and easily drinkable.  It's not robust, nor is it exceptionally complex, but it's consistently good and perfectly priced.  I'm lucky to have this beer at my annual disposal."
"Wow, this is very dry but yet so drinkable. Lots of bakers chocolate and roast are front and center here, dry roast, almonds, and toast round out the middle with some coffee notes. In the finish there is brown sugar and had a slightly ashy finish but nothing off putting."
"I really enjoy this beer. it's a great draft from a great brewery. If you see some on the shelf, definitely grab some."
"This is a very flavorful standard porter. I could drink these all day."
"I LOVE THIS PORTER! Amazing beer! I can't wait to try the barrel aged version of this beer Black Butte XXII, someday..."
"Awesome porter! Fits the American Porter style quite well. There may better ones but there are definitely many ones that are worse. Love everything about this beer. Definitely give it a try if you come across it!"
"This seems like a light bodied porter but the flavors meld very well. It's the flavors I look for in a porter but seems a tad light on the overall flavor. Beautiful roasted character with the raspberries. This is a must try porter!"
"Thanks to ZX6Chris for this one as an extra in a trade, good trader we'll have to do business again sometime."
"Really pleasant roast and powdered chocolate malt nose. A bit of a swirl shows up a bit of green hops at the back. Palate is full, smooth and balanced. More of the same chcolate, malt, roast flavours lining up nicely. Bitterness is mild with a medium finish. Really good."
"Lighter end of medium bodied with some nice bitter earthy hops up front that linger throughout balancing out the roasty chocolate malt notes. Slightly yeasty/bready with hints of caramel and hazelnut and a sweet dry chocolaty malt finish. Decently balanced and fairly quaffable."
"D - Drinkability is moderately high. It certainly goes down easy, but the flavors just come and go too quickly. I would've liked to see some more flavor impact, but if I were looking for something to drink a lot of during a game, I could see this as being a candidate."
"This beer pours a rather dark brown color with ruby shadings when held to light, with a finger of beige foam that fades to just barely being on the surface. The smell is not overwhelming, but it does seem to consist mainly of coffee notes and a hint of caramel. There are some generic fruity esters in the background too faint to really pin down. There is a hint of smoke to the coffee and caramel flavorings that really makes this a pretty darn good beer. It has a nice zesty feel to it without being overbearing and I could seriously drink this beer all day long. It's really one of the better porters that exist on the market and I'm so glad that I was sent 2 of these."
"Medium bodied with average carbonation. Smooth with a little bit of a tingle on the tongue from the carbonation. This is an excellent porter and given the excellent taste and moderate ABV, it is very easy to drink."
"D - a very approachable solidly crafted porter. i'm not the biggest fan of this style so for me the drinkability is so-so, but for fans of porters this is a must try."
"Drinkability: One of my all time favorite beers. drinkability is very very high."
"Overall, a very good beer. I tend to enjoy porters, and this is better than most."
"D - Owing to the exceptional taste, ease of drinking, and low ABV, this is undoubtedly a great session beer. A sixer of this was only $6.99 at Safeway and I'm glad I decided to pick this one up. Should be good for Thanksgiving dinner."
"All-in-all it is a fantastic porter for its availability and price. From a price-to-quality perspective this beer probably warrants an A. I can usually pick up a six-pack for six to seven dollars."
"D: Excellent session porter. Nice balance of flavors; would be great paired with grilled/roasted steak or game."
"D: I can't imagine it being more drinkable than it already is. Also, the ABV is low, so you don't have to stumble about all night long."
"Instant favorite"
"This is super drinkable. Not an extreme beer, but very tasty."
"Overall: I liked this one a lot. Like a great porter, it packs a wallop of robust flavor without having to be a huge ABV or imperial beer. One of my new favorites in the style."
"Pours a color that is bordering on black, which I suppose is fitting. The nose is dark chocolate, roasted malt, and coffee--just what I expect from a good porter. Really nice bold scent. The taste scales it back just a bit, but has the same general tenor. Good, slightly-dry feel with a nice body. Another hit from Deschutes."
"This is one of the most drinkable porters I've ever had...I could have easily chugged this one down."
"Overall - Whether you're looking for a first porter or stout to try, or you're just in the mood for something more sessionable than the bigger imperial stouts, this one consistently takes the cake as one of the best session porters in the NW. Even as I've become more into bigger, badder ales these days, this one still has a welcome spot in my fridge for sure."
"Smooth, creamy, almost velvety feel. Very pleasant on the tongue with nice flavor and lower alcohol content. Solid porter for sure."
"More carbonated than I expected, but it works well with this beer. Good drinkability."
"This is excellent beer at an excellent price, you sure can't go wrong with Deschutes."
"Body feels a bit watery and the carbonation is too high."
"D- I could have a few of these any day."
"Thanks to BA bud Cdkrenz for getting me this sampler. This brew poured into a pint glass is a deep cola color with a slight bubbly head that settled to nearly nothing. The aroma was deep and dark like the color. Chocolate, coffee, and burnt malts are present with a light breadiness. The taste was deep as well. Burnt malts are at the top of the flavor profile but there are chocolate and caramel tones. There is a mildly bitter taste balancing this brew. As the brew gets closer to room temp the flavors expand and become more complex. The carbonation was minimal and this brew was a little thin but this is an excellently crafted porter and tasted delicious."
"The mouthfeel is about average for the style and carbonation is about moderate. Drinkability is good, it had some great flavors to it and was pretty well balanced as well. The milk chocolaty and roasted flavors worked very well together and made for a very flavorful and drinkable beer overall."
"D - A very nice porter indeed. I'd drink a fair bit of this."
"Drinkability: All day long."
"i bit heavy to have a ton of these, but and excellent porter for sure very quaffable."
"drinkability - good porter here, likeable beverage"
"Great NW porter. This is by far the favorite porter that everyone buys in the portland area. It is sold in almost every store that sells beer and is one of my favorites. Very smooth for a porter without any ""beer bite"" so it is easy to share with whomever you are drinking with even if they are not a big beer fan. Has somewhat of a vanilla taste to it."
" ~ This a a very good beer. If you have never tried it, should should do yourself a favor. This beer is worth every bit of $5 per 12 ounce bottle based on flavor alone. Seek it out."
"A very good porter."
"D -- Drink up, it's not often to come across a brewery with such technical precision."
"Overall: this is quite an enjoyable brew that makes you want more. There is no question that I will drink more of this beer."
"An excellent beer, and a very good session porter."
"Overall my favorite porter. I've had Edmund Fitzgerald and I still like black butte the best. These guys are the stout/porter kings. Love Dechutes."
"Very tasty brew that is an excellent representation of the style. One of my favorite porters produced. A must try from Deschutes."
"On tap at Old Chicago Westy in a shaker glass. Poured a very dark brown, nearly black color with a creamy head. Smelled of coffee and bitter chocolate. Taste of black coffee and bitter chocolate with a very smooth, drier finish. One of my go-to brews when at my watering hole; goes great with a half shot of Chambord added to make a GREAT raspberry porter. Good job, Deschutes."
"Overall a very good porter. I first tried this in Washington during a businees trip. Buried 2 six packs in my carry on and still find the need to have a six pack or two during the year! Cheers"
"Full-bodied, very tasty. I had a bad porter last week and the comparison really isn't even there. This style of beer is amazing when done appropriately, and Deschutes succeeds."
"D: pretty much the perfect Porter, I love Deschutes."
"D: I will come back to this but today I was not overly impressed. Anchor and others still make a much better daily drinking porter. There is just nothing about this that is that memorable is all."
"drink ability- Deschutes has become my favorite brewery so far I have tried four kinds of beers from them and I have not been disapointed !!!"
"great on a cold winter day, or any day you feel like having a robust dark beer that's not too filling."
"Not quite the wow beer I was expecting, but a deliciously drinkable porter and then some."
"Normally ten bucks a twelve pack, drinks well warm or cold, a beer I can get behind. Gets even tastier with a dash of bourbon..."
"Taste is better than the aroma. Coffee again most notable, but still toasted grains, and a nice hit of caramel that adds a touch of sweetness. Smooth mouthfeel, but a little thin. Nice level of carbonation. Solid, drinkable porter. Well made."
"D - Easy drinker, not too heavy. Fairly smooth and you can't notice any alcohol, which is nice."
"This is a very flavorful beer, one of the best in the porter category."
"Overall a very good porter. In my opinion there should be slightly bolder flavors in the beer. But it is still an excellent and very drinkable smooth porter."
"Sorry to hear about the fate of the XXII. Here is the name of a doctor who will look at it for you. You will receive no bill. He's a good man, Deschutes, and thorough."
"D - Very drinkable, I could certainly enjoy more than one in a sitting."
"Very drinkable and very well done."
"Drinkability = yes! This packs the flavor into a very accessible & smooth little beer. Very impressed."
"My preference is for the bigger bolder beers, I have had Black Butte XXI several times and love the stuff. That being said I can get a glimpse of Black Butte XXI's flavor profile with this beer. Definitely less complex and flavorful but a very good porter that I'll have again."
"D - rather easily drinkable."
"O: Deschutes proves itself to me on a consistent basis. The hype is well justified."
"Drinkability: The first thing I thought about and rated when I took the first sip. The wonderful balance of the flavors make it hard not to want to enjoy another. (btw, it took me two to write this review)"
"D - This was an interesting beer. On one hand it was very good and I would definitely love to drink this one again. On the other hand, it seemed like it was so close to being a great porter but didn't' quite get there. I tasted this side-by-side with an Edmund Fitzgerald Porter and that Edmund was definitely the superior beer."
"12 oz bottle poured into an Allagash tulip. medium tan head with minimal to some lacing. Beer color is a mahogany. You really have to try to take in the smell as it doesnt hit you hard on the nose. There are coffee, toffee chocolate malt notes with a little hop bite. Taste is better than the nose but with similar flavors. While this is an excellent session porter, I cant give it world class marks that you find in more complex offerings. Great beer but far from amazing and but no where near world class. Wonderful value beer and maybe one of the best values out there at $6.99 a six pack."
"D - Low ABV and great mouthfeel. Not too sweet either - well done."
"Notes: This is extremely drinkable. I'd give it a 5 for how easily it goes down, but the fact that it is so thin makes me not want to drink it... so, 4."
"D- This porter was amazing. Deschutes makes good beers and this one is no exception. I wish this company like so many would come to Indiana. A porter that is a easy drinker and a ABV that makes this more than a one and done."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a very dark brown with ruby red highlights. Medium tan head that grips the glass with good lacing. Smell is that of fresh pumpernickel bread. Taste is smooth bread flavors up front, with a smooth coffee flavored middle and a earthy finish, with a hint of citrus fruit. Good mouthfeel, smooth carbonation. Drinkability is very good. An excellent porter that I would get again if it were available in my area."
"Overall, a very nice porter. One of Deschutes better regular offerings in my opinion. This one is pretty drinkable."
"D: one of the beat American porters I've tried. I could definitely knock back a fair few of these in a night"
"A tasty porter with plenty going on. I really like the approach taken here and could see this being a regular if I lived in the US."
"This porter had an exception appearance, very dark brown, almost black, but with a light head. The smell was a very solid nose of vanilla. The vanilla, plus chocolate came through in the taste as well, with a good smooth porter taste. It was very similar, to me, to the Deschutes Obsidian Stout, but of course with a smoother porter taste."
"D - At 5% this is easily one of the most drinkable and best tasting porters on the planet!...done"
"This brew started good, but finished ok. I think this is a good brew to try at least once but not hunt down. I'm very interested in trying the specialty Black Butte's because I imagine this flavor would be intensified and not as watered down."
"Enjoyed this one, although it reminded me that I definitely prefer the bite of a stout over the smoothness of a porter. In any case, this one poured a pitch black like it's supposed to, with nice smooth cool chocolate and roasted malt flavors throughout. Highly drinkable, especially for the style. Another tasty brew from Deschutes."
"Conclusion, I could see myself purchasing a 6-er of this. Not the best porter I've had but a fairly solid one. There was nothing too extravagant, but nothing offensive either - a good introductory porter."
"Drinkability: Dry finish with notes of hop & coffee bitterness as well as burnt caramel. Very well balanced into an inoffensive, solid porter, with good drinkability."
"Pours a very dark brown that shows some ruby red edges when held up to the light. Head was off-white and somewhat minimal. Scent is very appealing with rich chocolate and coffee notes. Some sweet sugary notes as well. The taste is even better than it smells! Very robust coffee and dark chocolate flavors followed by some sweet, sugary malt flavors teamed up with some slight hints of dark fruits. A slight bit of hoppiness, but not much. Very nice tasting Porter...but I didn't expect anything less from Deschutes. The mouthfeel seems just perfect for what a ""non-imperial porter"" should be. Not too light or watery whatsoever. The drinkability is VERY high."
"Poured a very nice dark brown almost black. a nice ruby color is visible when in direct light. head was a creamy, tan, 2 finger head.. Smelled of dark roasted malts followed by hints of coffee & chocolate/toffee. Diving in I got a mouthful of toffee with a burnt sugar/coffee aftertaste. very rich in flavor. Finishes clean with a coffee like bitterness left on the palate. the mouthfeel is smooth & creamy. very solid porter that is easy to drink."
"Its pretty easy to enjoy if you can avoid the finish with exact sipping intervals. Hell, if I was a quick drinker I might not have even noticed it. Its nice an low alcohol, so it wasn't a chore due to alcohol, but some other aspects certainly made me feel like I was 10 all over again."
"Pours a nice brown clear color with red highlights and a small yet bubble tan head that leaves minimal lacing. Really robust roasty aroma of fresh coffee, tootsie rolls and a slight bit of chewing tobacco. Sweet initially followed by bitter malts and slight overcarbonation on the palate. Really easy drinking and smooth. Good transition between the midpalate and the finish. Mouthfeel is silky smooth despite the over carbonation. Nice richness to it makes it a lighter version than many porters. Overall its a goood beer and would be great with spicy foods, but its not my bag. I judged this in terms of other porters."
"D: This is one of the easier porters to drink. It's very simple, but good. A great way to introduce someone to a porter. Wouldn't say it's the best representative of the style, but I could definately throw a few of these back."
"A really good easy drinking porter. A go-to porter for sure."
"Drinkability - A very nice taste, along with a sublte or workable aftertaste. Good beer, worth coming back for."
"Poured into a Delirium snifter, coutesy of jefferz5000. Smell has a lot going on, predominantly milk chocolate, coconut, coffee and dark fruit undertones. Taste is a bit different, you get the chocolate and coffee again but then it goes to a whole new level it adds smoke caramel and vanilla to the mix. Mouthfeel is silky smooth even from the bottle. Tons of these could be drank by me especially in late autumn/early spring."
"D: Quite drinkable, would make a good session beer if you're in the mood for a porter."
"The body is good- nice creamy feel with a medium body. Enough carbonation to help it along too."
"A very enjoyable, balanced new world porter, with tinges of the old country, and all the more agreeable as a dessert accompaniment. Imma gonna have to go up to the counter to find out what that is."
"D - as stated earlier, clean and easy to drink while still providing depth and body. A beautiful balance between high flavor profile and smooth taste. Wow."
"D- Absolutely one of the best beers I've encountered, and I'd be hard pressed to name a better porter. It holds all of its characteristics well as it warms. While the complexity and richness of it does not necessarily lend itself to ""refreshment," it makes for an excellent sipping beer. There are also a multitude of foods one could pair with this beer. Well done!"
"Drinkability: Very enjoyable, but more a sipping beer than thirst quenching."
"Amber brown clear body, some visible carbonation, one finger light tan head, pretty quick dissipation with some lacing. Roasted malts dominate the nose, some caramel sweetness, light citrus hops. Taste mirrors the nose, not overly roasted, nice balance against the sweetness. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light for the style, not sticky, average effervescence. This is one tres drinkable beer, and a big surprise for those who think 'dark' beers are heavy. The PNW's best Porter in my opinion. Worth seeking out on tap."
"Final Notes: A really good beer to pair with barbecue/grilled foods or just by itself, and would be a great beer for someone looking to move to darker beers. Delicious."
"Drinkability is nearly perfect. It is slightly rich and heavy, but in all the right places"
"You would never think this is a low alcohol beer(compared to most dark ones lately!). The beer is not watery at all. The taste is quite satisfying and easy to drink. This is a very nice example of the porters."
"Drinkable? This baby is gone!"
"Mouthfeel is very creamy, but light. This is a great staple, and pairs well with sauerkraut."
"Very high. It's very nice porter, but I wish there's a little more body to it, otherwise it's delicious porter."
"Very drinkable imo. I highly suggest this to any beer lover."
"Bottle poured into a stadard pint glass. Best by date is 10/08/10. Deep dark brown, nearly black, with 3/4 inch of frothy, tan head that dissipates quickly and leaves little to no lacing. Rich, smoky, nutty aroma with hints of coffee and dark chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium/light bodied with spot on carbonation. This is almost like a more flavorful Guinness to me. Only slightly bitter and a somewhat subdued malt give it a taste that is predominately dark chocolate with a smoky malt finish. I wouldn't say that it goes down clean but the body is light enough and the flavors are delicate enough to make this very drinkable."
"D: great tasty porter, lots of chocolate, reminds me a little bit of Edmund Fitzgerald"
"Very nice porter, like this one better than the Highland I had before it, but still doesn't touch the big boys such as Founders and Smuttynose..."
"I'll admit that I was mildly intimidated by this beer before I cracked it open, but once I had my first sip it was wonderful. It has opaque brown appearance to it and the scent contained hints of coffee and chocolate. The taste is a smooth blend of chocolate and coffee (surprise!). It finished a little toasty and warm. Overall, I am not a big fan of Porters, but I truly enjoyed this beer and will probably have it again. Well done Deschutes!"
"Mouthfeel is full and rich with no unpleasant aftertaste. Good carbonation too."
"Skip dessert after dinner and pop one of these open instead."
"D - Very drinkable, and a great example of the style. This is a porter I could drink all night."
"This is becoming one of my new favorite porters. It has everything you could possibly want if your a fan of them."
"Goes great with good sausages and cheese."
"D: Very smooth and drinkable porter. Could easily drink a few of these or would also pair nicely with a chocolate raspberry mousse."
"D- pretty tasty porter, low abv is nice."
"D: A very nice porter. Delicious, light and low carbonation coupled with the low alcohol make this a very drinkable beer. The flavor is strong and that's the only thing keeping this from a 5."
"Poured almost black with a 2-finger head that never completely settled, leaving a 1/2"" mocha colored froth. An oily residue was on the side of the glass but no real lacing. Nose was charred wood and some some faint chocolate. Taste was biscuity, sweet dark chocolate and a touch of coffee. Mouthfeel was thinner than I expected. There was some sticky, oily feel as well. Expectations always play a role in rating and I admit to having been disappointed. I will revisit this again, but for now...it was only ok."
"Drinkability: Not bad, but the flavors didn't come across like I wanted them to, and the body was pretty weak. I'll gladly give another shot though."
"This was the beer that made me enjoy beer when I first started drinking it. I drifted away for years before rediscovering it, and I don't know why I ever stopped! Top-notch."
"Try this beer if you get the chance to."
"Awesome brew! It's a nice easy drinking beer, I could easily drink a handfull of these in one sitting."
"Pours a deep, dark brown color, almost black, with garnet highlights and some nice brown foam. Aromas of chocolate and coffee, with a little roasted malt. More of the same on the palate, with some caramel and nuts and a little hop bitterness. Truly one of the best of the style."
"Two fingers of tan foam, islands of larger bubbles speed up the dissolving, very good stick to the lacing. Pure black color, as if it's an imperial stout or something, you see some bubble beads rising along the glass sides, completely opaque, duh. The nose wisely chooses steady penetration rather than brute force, roasted coffee and bittersweet dark chocolate, blanched nuts, tar and earth, celery root, close to herbaceous at times, very little discernible fruit or citrus scents, maybe a drop of anise. Full-bodied, muscular and layered, more interested in posing fully flexed than displaying any fluid movement. The coffee roast, carob, dark chocolate still going on, maybe maple syrup or corn syrup. Here you get an interesting mineral water aspect which dries things out and focuses the aforementioned flavors, the mouth feel has some turbulence. Red apple, cherry, apricot fruit breaks the surface now and then. Muttered suggestion of orange peel. In the end, this is very craftily put together and while it does not always viscerally please it does continuously draw in your intellect."
"Thanks to BigBry for the bottle."
"overall: not my favorite porter good but not great"
"Gets the porter job done without any noticeable flaws!"
"D - Very drinkable, easily finished the 12oz. Amazing everyday porter, could easily knock a few off in a sitting."
"Drinkablility: Low ABV and good Porter flavors make this a very easy beer to session with. I immediately wanted more after I finished the 22 oz. bottle."
"D - Very nice porter. Has the big bold chocolate malt which I like in a porter. Drier and hoppier than I expected for a very nice surprise. Personally I find this more enjoyable than Edmund Fitzgerald. I would definitely make this a regular in my fridge if I could get it local."
"D: Extremely drinkable. Excellent sessionability. A truly wonderful beer. Man am I glad Deschutes came to MN! Will be going back for more (I did a double-take when I saw the price--$2.99 for 22 oz; it's a steal)."
"d - I thought this was a great porter. It smelled amazing and had a great feel to it, and is very easy to drink at 5.2% ABV. Would love to have again."
"This beer pours a dark brown color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes into nice lacing. The aroma is of graham cracker, cream, faint milk chocolate, and a little roasted malt. It has nice complexity, but is on the fainter side for the style. The taste is larger than the aroma, but still not over the top. It is quite relaxed, and I like that. There is more roasted malt, some bitterness, and hints of chocolate. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation of fine bubbles. Overall, this is a very nice beer. It has strong complexity, and good flavor. If only the aroma were slightly stronger I would be in love with this beer."
"M/D: Medium to light body. Nice and creamy mouthfeel. carbonation is a little on the higher side. Great drinkability. Lots of flavor for being only 5.2% abv. All around a phenomenal porter."
"Drinkabilty: Would welcome this again and again."
"Session, session, session! It's hard to believe this beer sits around five percent alcohol. A top notch porter that drinks splendidly. $2.99 a bomber? I feel like a thief."
"Overall, this is very enjoyable. My first of the style, and I am pleasantly surprised. Great to drink."
"D - A very, very good porter and one I keep going back to. One of the best I have ever tried."
"Exceptionally drinkable."
"Deschutes Black Butte Porter pours a couple of fingers of foam over a deep black brew. The liquid is a little too inky to gauge carbonation, but the nose is pretty typical porter- toasted dark malts and mocha (not that that's a bad thing). Flavor is typical too- dark toast, molasses, mocha, with a little of that charred bread flavor and herbal hops off the back. Mouthfeel is smooth and round, but not heavy, drying out just a bit. Altogether, a very nice easy-drinking porter."
"Wow, drinkablility here is out of this world. This would be a great session beer."
"D- Very drinkable for the style because of the nutty aftertaste. The low ABV also bodes well for the drinkability."
"Drinkable? dude, not a question, this is a dank brew and one of my favorites I need to pick up a case or something, always forget how good it is."
"Light to medium bodied with a lot of carbonation, and easy to drink. This is not a complex beer, but is quite good."
"D - Fresh at the brew pub, it's hard to beat this brew. Definitely worth having more than one if you have the time and place."
"Overall, this is a delicious sessional porter. None of the flavors are overpowering, it's perfectly blended, and no hint of alcohol at all. I could drink quite a few of these."
"SkÅL!"
"D - quite drinkable. A decent porter, but there are better examples of the style."
"Overall, a great porter with an extremely well integrated flavor profile and mouthfeel. Nothing's out of balance. A really good job."
"D- it's not bad, I could drink a few without hesitation. Just not my favorite style."
"D: very, very drinkable - nice roasted malt/earthy taste up front with good hop balance"
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a brown color with a reddish hue, good sized frothy light brown head, lacing throughout. Aroma is caramel, sweet, roasted malt, and dark chocolate. Flavor is sweet and roasted malts, milk chocolate, with an almost rye-like spiciness. Mouthfeel is medium, a little oily, and smooth finish. Good porter, plenty of flavor."
"A good porter in the new world Micro tradition and well made"
"D-A delightful example of porter, making this one quite drinkable and enjoyable."
"Pours a dark brown color with amber edges when held to the light, small white head that's gone quickly leaving little lace. Nice malty, somewhat roasty aroma with some hints of chocolate and a touch of hops. This is an easy drinking, superbly balanced American Porter. Malty, but not too sweet, a nice dose of chocolate with some light caramel, and a tiny underpinning of hops to keep things even-keeled. Medium body, light carbonation makes it a quaffing beer. Will be buying this one often at this price tag. Nice brew."
"poured from a bomber into a goblet the color was black cherry with a fresh beige ring some nice clinging lacing..the smell was fresh toffee and caramel some chocolate and some coffee and toast..the taste was toffee ,chocolate,spice ,licorice and malt balanced with some hops (as it this porter warms) it is well balanced ..the mouth feel is medium for a porter a little on the dry and sweet side but overall a great representation of the style very drinkable/enjoyable..i recommend this one on a style that is not my favorite"
"This is a top of the class porter. Deschutes please make your beer more available in the east. Thanks for a great porter."
"Drinkability: Fantastic Porter in all respects. This is the Porter I have been looking for, as I finally don't care that the SA Holiday Porter does not come in its own six packs."
"D - Really easy drinking and packed full of flavor. If this was available in my area my girlfriend and I would have this in the fridge at all times."
"Overall: I like Black Butte Porter. The appearance is fantastic and by far the beer's best attribute. Obsedian black with fine head! The taste is good, but leaves much to be desired. Needs more barley flavor in my opinion. Smell is average and won't turn heads, but the drinkability is very good. I would recommend Black Butte to friends as the taste is good and the appearance is great. Certainly a beer to try while in Oregon!"
"Pours a nice deep brown. Very light carbonation. great aroma of malt and roasted coffee. Taste follows with hints of chocolate, coffee and roasted malt. A VERY smooth and creamy Porter that makes a easy beer to drink. Probably the best Porter I have had to date. I only wish I could get them here in Mass."
"D-This is one tasty, sessionable, insanely drinkable porter. This would be a regular in my fridge were it distributed to my neck of the woods."
"D: A little too watered down tasting for me, but overall not a bad drinking beer."
"This is a very tasty porter, and it reminds me that porters used to be one of my favorite styles before getting into hoppy beers. Nice roasted flavor without being too heavy. Good stuff."
"Based on the look the taste is a little watery. highly drinkable. Not much carbonation but I like that. It need to warm up a little for full flavor. It has chocolate roasty bit and some sweetness. Balanced. This beer is really good. I find myself being a repeat buyer of this beer."
"Medium to light in body. Beer is smooth, not a lot of carbonation in the mouth. Beer tastes good, some roast comes up late and lingers. Second taste, not a lot of sweetness in the front but its well balanced overall. Drinkability high."
"D= Delicious. Takes over Summits Porter as my new favorite. I love porters and I love the way they fit together without being too heavy and this is a nearly perfect example. Seek this out."
"Everything that constitutes a good porter is here. However, to be a great porter, I feel that this approach doesn't work -- I'll look forward to trying Black Butte XII, and hopefully that'll kick my butt."
"Poured into my brand spankin' new Zatec fluted glass. Finger and a half light tan head. Nose typical of a non-smoked porter. Light Coffee, chocolate, a little spiciness. Tasted like it smelled with the addition of a bit of nuttiness. Mouthfeel was a bit on the carbonated side, and a little light for my preferences. Probably quite a good session beer. Very drinkable."
"a fav local porter of mine, have sampled in bottles and tap at many occasions. Seems to be accepted locally as a'dark' beer by the average beer drinker"
"I'm not a huge fan of porters mostly because I prefer the viscous mouthfeel of big stouts when I'm drinking something dark and roasty. However, this is a great example of the style. I would probably choose GL Eddie Fitz over this given the choice, but that certainly isn't a knock on Black Butte. I've also been told that this beer is much better on tap, so I'll be certain to try it in that format if I ever have the opportunity. This was my first offering from Deschutes and I really enjoyed it. I can't wait to try the Obsidian Stout and Abyss that I have waiting in my cellar (see, closet)."
"Very good on drinkability. One of the best American Porters I've had."
"D: A ridiculously well-crafted beer. I can tell that a lot of time, heart, and consideration was put into this. Every aspect is perfection or close to it. Mouthfeel is just phenomenal and flavor is amazingly complex for a non-imperial porter. This one is worth going out of your way for. Seek it out!!"
"Drinkability: Goes down oh so easy. Not the beer its hyped up to be, but enjoyable."
"Drinkability is stellar. This beer contends with other porters the way a high school dropout contends with a masters for a management job. It delivers beyond comparison. Truly exceptional."
"Very drinkable."
"This porter is one of the most drinkable examples of this style I have come across. Extremely tasty beer."
"D: One of my favorites from Deschutes. I'm not always the biggest fan of their year round beers, but this is always a great choice."
"The first beer I had from Deschutes, and just as delicious as I remember. Really suggest to anyone who enjoys good porter/stout. Nothing crazy but a really good solid beer."
"Mouthfeel-silky with a low to medium carbonation. This one is very pleasing on the palate. Some milder sweet malt flavors. The earthy hops are buried in there somewhere. A froth on the palate reveals some more aggressive hop flavors and they stay to the finish along with some tannin flavors and a bitterness assoociated with the darker roasted malts, slightly burnt-this is good! This one is very true to style. It is smooth, but full of flavor without being robust. Classic!"
"Impression: Yet another Deschutes masterpiece that I can't replenish, as Deschutes doesn't send to NY. Porter lovers need to get this beer any way possible."
"The fairly light body was well carbonated. The feel wasn't too thick but had a nice dry finish. The body may have been a tad lacking, but it was never watery, and it aided the drinkability. Lot's of flavor, lots of bite, VERY easy to drink. Sessionable for sure"
"Another in our lineup of Porter tastings. This is very very similar to the Mayflower Porter. An aggressive pour yielded very little head and there was little to no lacing. The aroma is a bit weak with roasted maltiness and some yeast. The strongest quality of this porter is balance. Its smooth like a quality brown ale but its not producing any depth. thin, thin, thin. Not bitter, not sweet, and not anything to write home about. Perhpas I might have liked it better if not up against some other better options in the tasting."
"Appears a dark cola color with ruby brown highlights when held toward the light. Light khaki tan head with fine evenly spread lacing. The bottles mentions the krausening process there is a fine layer of yeast specks drop into the glass and they sink to the bottom. Aromatics contain dark cocoa and mild coffee with hints of sweet and mildly tart fruits. Flavor is upfront with a cherry plum sweetness that fades ino the background with a mild smokey charred hint of dark roasts. Dark roasts give some dry dark chocolate and coffee roasted qualities to it all, I'm impressed by the all around balance slight herbal hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied pretty dry overall but a complex beer that builds layers with each sip, a nice drying finish. Drinkability was great my bottle was gone way too fast I'm just going to have to make it to the source, I've had a couple opportunities to tmake it out to the PacNW. I'll make there eventually, thanks again Geof for the previews."
"D - This beer is extremely drinkable, I could easily drink 3 or more pints of this delicious brew with some BBQ. This beer was very balanced to me, I would probably have it again but I wouldn't say it's worth seeking out, but it's definitely worth a try. I'm liking this brewery more & more for sure. Cheers!"
"Pours a very deep, dark brown, bordering on black (only the addition of some light reveals the truth) with a minor amount of mocha-colored head that leaves some good lacing behind. The smell is loaded with roasted malts and dark coffees, with a very faint hint of licorice hiding in the brush. The taste follows, with that licorice absent and a nice, smoky woodiness pops up, bringing an extra leyer of complexity to the proceedings. The body is a bit on the heavy side, and the carbonation gives an odd bite at the end, and these, when combined, serve to lessen the overall drinkability here. Still, a very tasty bit o' porter."
"I was very surprised with this beer, I got it from Wal-Mart of all places and for only $6. Well worth the price and the taste was exceptional. A flavor that lasted for a while on the palette and had a great chocolate taste to it. For a porter I could drink a few of these in one sitting, but to really enjoy this beer a good home cooked dinner should be enjoyed with it. By far one of the best porters I have ever had. This company has yet to disappoint me and I look forward to trying most if not all their beers."
"D - goes down rather easily for a Porter, helped (unfortunately) by a thinnish body. the flavors are all there, just not given the chance to really shine. would love to try this on cask or nitro, an additional dimension might be what it takes to propel this to the top."
"Medium body, with moderate carbonation. Overall, a nice example of the style. Well balanced throughout. If anything, the body could be a little heavier and though it teases you with a hint of being creamy it really doesn't follow through in that regard. Even with that, though, certainly a session porter."
"Pours dark brown to black with a tan head. The aroma is chocolate and roasted malt. The flavor is heavily roasted to burnt malt with a lot of dark, bitter chocolate. Medium, creamy mouthfeel and medium carbonation. One of the better robust porters I have tried and one that everyone should try."
"Notes: My all time favorite porter on the market. It's so well balanced and not too syrupy or sweet. Also, as mentioned the best version of this is cask."
"D: a nice, non-heavy porter option"
"D- one of the most sessionable beers around these parts,poured out of the bottle was great but from past experiences it was even better off tap- this is always a great standby when you're not in the mood for oak bourbon barrel quad-hopped madness but still want great flavor"
"Poured out of a bottle into the traditional pint glass. Nice 1 1/4 thick head with lacing that left my pint glass looking as if it had a ribcage!! Aromas of toasted malts and a little hint of dark chocolate. Rich bold flavor surge of hop flavor, good mouthfeel as well nice and smooth. A very drinkable beer, and maintains nice flavor throughout."
"Overall: I love Porters, and was quite disappointed by this one. It seemed fizzy, weak, simple and singular to me. Not a bad beer in any sense, but not exceptional either. If I hadn't read any other reviews I would have gone on and never bothered to try this beer again, but an 'A-' with over 600 reviews is really remarkable, so I am going to revisit it sometime. Until then, I am not impressed."
"D-solid flavors and remarkably smooth. somewhat thinner than I would have prefered."
"Lovely aroma of roasted chocolate and caramel. Pours a beautiful deep ruby, almost black, with a substantial mocha head. Taste is more of the slightly sweet roasted chocolate and perhaps some espresso. Loses points on the palate for being rather light and thin for a porter. Carbonation is fizzy on the tongue where it should be soft and creamy. Overall this is a quality porter that is indeed ""rich and approachable""."
"Carbonation sustains itself, leaving a lively trace of bitterness and roasted flavor on the tongue. It's a full-bodied brew that coats the mouth nicely and leaves you satisfied. I ought to have had this with some pumpkin pie, but flew solo with it and it was plenty satisfying on its own merits. Approved and recommended from this shitbird!"
"Deep, dark brown body that is nearly black. Not much head nor lacing to speak of. Smell has a notable dark-chocolate character that is quite enviable. Well roasted malts provide a solid background of aroma and flavor. Black Butte Porter is not overly sweet and is subtly hopped. The taste of roasted malt is very evenly tempered. Mouthfeel is a bit prickly thanks to enduring carbonation, body is medium-light. BBP is remarkably drinkable for the style. Her only defect is the slightest ""watery"" taste. Nevertheless, a standard setting porter."
"Overall - A great take on an American porter"
"overall a solid beer with good drinkability."
"F: Finish leaves the nice creamy chocolate lingering a bit, and has a nice bitter follow as well. Still slightly sweet. The earthy spicy hop bitterness adds a nice finish. The smoked flavor also seems to stick around the mouth as everything else fades, which is probably why it seems to come out late on the taste itself."
"I had the Black Butte XXI a couple nights ago, and am having this for the first time tonight. I was expected this to be a little closer to the XXI but its really a completely different beer. The XXI is an unbelievable beer, but this is very good, too. Not such an outgoing flavor or character overall, but a good drink. I generally don't drink porters, as I just prefer a more bigger stout. This is a little light to me.. not much depth or flavor, especially considering the expectations from such a great brewery. I have the six pack / and I'll enjoy it, but I'll definitely buy their Obsidian Stout six over this any day."
"Great session beer for porter or stout people. Easy going abv coupled with amazing smooth creaminess and a coffee not I adore and will remember. A good deal too."
"This is simply a great porter. The taste is some what bitter, some what smothe; and it is overall a great beer and a wonderfull example of the style. As far as drinkability is concerned, I can and I have drank these all night long. The taste (which I tend to grade beer on) is complicated but not so in-your-face that you can't finish a couple at a dinner. With 5.2% this beer is a great beer for gatherings when you want, or need, to have a few but do not want to compramise taste and flavor."
"very drinkable porter, classic light mouthfeel while maintaining depth aNd character"
"Poured a nice dark, brown/black with a big toffee colored head. Nose is roasted malt, cocoa, dry. Taste is mostly bitter coffee/chocolate, with more than a tad of smokiness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, dry, charred and pretty good. Drinkability is good."
"Edit: had to bump up the score after tasting a fresher bottle on 9/22/10. Still a special brew for one that is so readily available in the West (and now upper Midwest)."
"This beer is much better served from a nitro tap. The extra texture really fleshes the beer out."
"Delicious roasted malt, never had so much pronounced chocolate malt that doesn't finish heavy at all. These are capable of multiple efforts in a sitting. Very good. There's better porters out there, but not at this price."
"A very enjoyable beer. This beer would be great with a smoked cheese."
"Cheers!"
"D: Very drinkable, this is a really good example of an American Porter."
"D: I liked a lot, a world class american craft beer."
"D: Drinks very easily, tasty, goes down incredibly easy, somewhat filling. ABV makes this one that I would sit with for a long, long time!"
"Notes: It might have been a bit too cold to fully appreciate the brew. Likewise the glassware while acceptable was not ideal."
"For one of there ""standard"" brews, its well above average."
"a textbook looking porter with a broad range of flavor incorporated from both american and british form. near black with an off white head. nose of toasty molasses. palate is plum, grape, intense anise, black licorice, pineapple, earthy molasses, and some coffee and chocolate. no abv. nice and creamy but not particularly dense in nature. you could have two in the summer with pizza it so light but complex."
"M/D: Very drinkable - this is a wonderful and pleasant brew, it would have been hard to improve upon."
"Overall this is a stalwart of the style, smooth, easy to drink, but extremely tasty and full flavored."
"Overall, this beer is definitely amazing. I wish this was available to me regularly because I'd probably regularly drink it. Are you listening, Deschutes? Come to NY!"
"D- This was hard to keep on the coaster - such an easy drinker. Everything is well balanced, its not boozy and its thin bodied."
"Somewhat thin mouthfeel and not too lively - good for drinkability, but takes away from overall complexity. I could enjoy a few of these."
"Drink: Goes down smooth, and has an interesting flavor. Not to mention being at a fairly sessionable abv, this beers is pretty drinkable."
"I need to move out West to get this 24-7. It would clearly be my go-to. I can't believe all of you lucky dogs get to sip this for a modest 8$ at the local grocery store. Cue Napolean Dynamite - ""Lucky""."
"D- Very drinkable. Medium/low ABV, coupled with a flavor that doesn't overpower could make this a good session."
"D - This beer is probably the easiest dark beer I have ever had to drink. It is smooth, lightly carbonated, and the sweet taste makes it a great porter."
"another winner from deschutes...just a step below black butte XXI, but an affordable step down..."
"A lot of brewers don't know what to do with the porter style. I love a good porter but it seems to exist on a continuum between American brown ale and stout; some porters skew too much towards either end of that spectrum. Black Butte is closer to a brown ale than a stout and it doesn't hit the porter bullseye that I so appreciate in great porters such as Boulevard Bully! Porter, Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald, Sierra Nevada Porter and Odell Cutthroat Porter. Which makes it all the more surprising to me that I like Black Butte. I think its the drinkability that puts this over the top for me; its a good beer to drink with a meal and a good beer to drink multiples of by their lonesome."
"Overall this porter is excellent, I prefer a bit bigger porter in general, but this is a very well crafted brew that does exactly what its supposed to do."
"D- I would have enjoyed this beer a little thicker but it was definitely a good session beer."
"Pours darkest of black with brown highlights. Lighter beige head, very roasty and burnt in the nose. Smells a little on the thin side. Taste was close to achieving a higher score but I was looking for a little more power from the malt. Mouthfeel could be thicker, black malt, toasted rye, blackstrap molasses and roasted vanilla bean in the taste. Very tasty and drinkable, a great example of a sessionable American Porter."
"So good! One of the better porters I have had in my time with beer."
"Bottle sample thanks to Adil- Pours deep brown letting in just a bit of light. Has a frothy mocha cap that lasts. The aroma was intense mocha, coffee, dark chocolate, and quite roasty. Tasted of black coffee with dark chocolate, bitter roasty dark malts, a bit slight milk chocolatey sweetness helps round out the bitterness. Solid long lasting finish leaves me wanting more. Quite a treat. Thanks Adil!"
"D - I think it's safe to label this beer as my second favorite Porter behind the Edmund Fitzgerald, a great Porter"
"This is an excellent beer. It tastes wonderful and is everything a porter should be. Actually, it's everything a wonderful beer should be."
"You are quite welcome for this extremely scientific and insightful review. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: What an amazing beer. I could session this. This is now my favorite in the style. This may be the smoothest beer I have had. I love the depth of the taste."
"Extremely smooth mouthfeel with a light crisp and the perfect amount of carbonation. Starts out with a creamy caramel flavor with a dark chocolate finish and some slight mocha in between. This is one of my favorite beers on the planet and could drink it all day long."
"A very solid porter that would be very drinkable... Worthy of its reputation..."
"Something about this porter really stands out for me. Probably my favorite porter out of the one's I've had."
"Easy to drink that doesn't lack in taste.."
"Good, drinkability, I'd recomend a few to anyone."
"Solid drinkable brew that I would recommend to a freind."
"i really enjoy the pronounced roasted and chocolate flavors here. excellent porter. great beer."
"D: A good drinker."
"D-overall this beer is highly drinkable and enjoyable, especially on these colder days, its definitely a beer to be cherished and enjoyed slowly. A very nicely done porter."
"best by 12/04/09"
"I wanted to try this before I tried my special purchase of Black Butte XXI a few weeks ago for a comparo. Maybe I'll put it on the boards. Great job, Deschutes!"
"4.0 D: Good overall, but suffers from the mouthfeel."
"D - Yet another well made beer from Deschutes this is a good easy to drink porter with a good taste worth trying sometime"
"Ok, this comes from one of the most respected breweries in the US, so we expected alot. We both agreed this beer was not overated and it dominated the tasting tonight. Tons of roasted charcoal flavor and very rich flavorful beer. There are good porters and then there are great porters ... this a great one. Grab this ASAP!"
"D- Overall a great porter with a big roasted flavor and high drinkability."
"M&D: the mouthfeel is consistently good, showing only a necessary amount of light fizz to match an equally light body and moderate flavour profile. This ale tastes rather ""conservative"" so far as an American version of Porter ale is concerned, as the weak presence of aromatic hops in aroma and taste is quite apparent. That said, I have no issues with the understated-ness all too common to English Porters; actually, the overall light body & taste and a chewy finish make this a rather drinkable example."
"Another spectacular entry from Deschutes."
"NOTE-Might have been slightly unfresh. Bomber had a 9/30 best by date and I drank this on 9/25"
"I could drink a ton of this, very smooth and easy going down and not at all fatiguing on the palate, not to mention delicious."
"Has all the usual porter flavors (chocolate infused roast malt) but it's just better. The first thing that comes to mind is that this beer tastes clean; especially for a porter. I don't know if that's a result of Cascade water or Deschutes mastery, or a combination of both--it's just real clean. Has an acidic eh which I'm not a fan of."
"Drink ability is good. Session able porter but a bit bland. This is a good beer but just not on the level of the best, ie: Avery New World Porter"
"Drinkability: probably my favorite session dark beer. This stuff is just fantastic over an evening."
"D: Great, it went perfect with my porkchop."
"Into my Duvel tulip, this porter pours a nice, dark, black colour that is topped with an espresso-foam head (which doesn't stick around too long, forming a thin, whispy layer of espresso-like foam) and leaves some decent lacing as it goes down. Smells of milky smooth chocolate, a bit of coffee and I get hints of hot chili as well (If you've ever tried chili chocolate, you know what I mean - delicious and so enticing!). Taste is nice and roasty with the malts showing through. Then, notes of coffee and dark chocolate come through (not overly strong) with a touch of minerality that cleans up the palate. It's on the finish that the chocolate really begins to come through finishing off with a really enjoyable chili-chocolate, spicy tingle and some bitter hops in the background. Mouthfeel is full bodied, quite creamy but with a spicy, tingly finish that really makes it feel clean and surprisingly refreshing. Overall, this is a killer and very sessionable porter that has some nice flavour complexity but doesn't overpower the palate. I could see myself drinking a ton of these - no problem. I'm looking very much forward to trying more beers from this brewery!"
"The mouthfeel is a medium and has a smooth character, but I think is a little thin."
"Drinkability - as I said, this is a classic, but personally I can only drink a few, so too me not the most drinkable beer. But just because i'm a stick in the mud, I can't knock this, it is a great beer, and I would recommend just not my cup of tea."
"Overall - After having Black Butte XXI a few days earlier I couldn't help but be disappointed. I expected less intense flavors, but this beer seemed like a version of the XXI that had been toned down several levels."
"This is a classy, classic American Porter."
"Pours cola brown with some light peeking through revealing red highlights. There's a ""bowl"" of head--clinging to the walls of the rounded glass, while showing hints of the beer beneath in the middle. Smells of rich roasty malts and chocolate--yum! The malts keep it up in the flavor with more roasted goodness, chocolate, and hints of coffee, smoke, cherry, molasses, and some alcohol. Just a little thinner than I would like, but a satisfying beer otherwise. This one goes down easily. Solid."
"I feel like an oregon-blasphemer, but there's something there from the bittering hops that could use an edit. Now that you've read this, drink one...I think you'll see what I mean..."
"Pours a dark brown color with minimal tan head that quickly settles to a thin cap. Light spotty lacing is left on the glass. Wonderful aroma of dark malts, chocolate, coffee, and a little tobacco. The taste is likewise rewarding. The chocolate malt is on full display giving hints of mocha and coffee. A little bitterness is perceived but finishes with just a touch of sweetness. A little ash on the finish as well. Medium body but the carbonation is a little pricky and agressive. An outstanding porter than does not get overly bitter and burnt. No problem drinking a few of these in a session."
"Doesn't feel or taste boozy, didn't interfere with the greasy pizza shop sandwiches I was eating. I'd like to try this with some spicy food and/or barbeque. Uncomplicated, but good."
"Drinkability - Rather high in my opinion. This stuff has a lovely body and is refreshingly different from my other gold standard porter: GLBC Eddie Fitz. It is great to come along a nice American porter that has sessionable alcohol levels while at the sane time presenting a flavor and aroma profile that differs from so many of its brethren. Cheers to Deschutes for their deliciously drinkable porter!"
"Creamy smooth nice tight carbonation pings off the tongue. A wonderfully flavorful porter. Just shows how much flavor can be coaxed out of a beer w/o a high abv."
"D: I would say the lightness of this beer score it some major points on the drinkability. If you're looking to have more than a couple of porters, this isn't a bad choice."
"The drink is light-medium in body with great carbonation and is highly, highly quaffable."
"pours a deep dark black thick creamy liquid with a light brown head that laces and sticks and residues down the side of the glass. smell is all chocolate and spices, caramel, roasty toasty coffee. tastes thick and creamy. feels just thick enough but not too overpowering. drinkability is just great"
"Drinkability: An excellent example of a porter, but with one glaring weakness - the strong flavors found in the taste can be overshadowed by the wateryness of the mouthfeel. But the mouthfeel is the only problem here, and it's not that of a big one."
"I like the XX and XXI so much more than this ""base"" beer that they've doubled. Not a bad beer, just not quite robust for me. Interestingly, this beer shares some of the same ashy notes that are found in some of the larger dark beers from Deschutes including the above mentioned and the Abyss. Kind of a house character. Pours a dark walnut brown with a thick, tam, pancake head. Smells light and roasty, and a touch ashy. The taste is a bit more robust than the smell, with some sweet malt, licorice, light roastiness and an ashy finish. Even for an American Porter this is quite dry, and not very hoppy at all. Solid beer, but I like my Porters either slightly less dry or slightly more robust. I don't mind the ashiness, but I think it works better with a little more body."
"This is one of my favorite ales in Deschutes' very fine year round lineup. A great beer and very affordable in Salem, OR. I can get this for $23.99 a case at Costco. Phenonmenal at this price!"
"The taste is an excellent porter character, very flavourful, balanced, and very smooth. It's toasty yet also lightly fruity, with a hint of sourness, toasted grain and whole wheat bread, rootbeer and anise, hints of chocolate, prunes (but drier and not as sweet as prunes), leaves. It has nice sweet-bitter balance and is highly drinkable, being just sweet enough."
"D - You know, I had one of these from my girlfriend's parent's fridge a day before it was 5 years old. They had this one I rated left so I got it. I can't believe something six years past the best by date is still this good! I really need to get my hands on a fresh bottle to compare! Very tasty and drinkable as crazy."
"D - That lightness does have one advantage, though, and that's high drinkability. That coupled with the low ABV results in a beer that can be sessioned very easily."
"Pours like a typical american porter - head of about half an inch, thick, foamy and tan. Beer itself is an obsidian black, deep as night, very rich looking. Whiffs of black malt on the nose, but not in a harsh way, inviting like a black coffee, if you are into that sort of thing. But this is has more flavor and creaminess packed into it than I would have thought possible for a ""basic"" strength porter. Loads of rich dark malt, hints at chocolate without being overpoweringly so. Tons of flavor, but the richness doesn't come with a harsh bit to it. Super creamy mouthfeel, i just find myself licking my lips after. This is quite simply an awesome beer, and I can't wait for BBXXI."
"D: The alcohol provides that gradual warming effect that we all know and love. This is a brew that should be enjoyed...over and over and over again."
"I'm not generally a huge fan of Porters, but this beer is delicious. I was on a flight of beers that included other porters, but this was the first one I tried. In the glass it looked black and slick. It had a very subtle aroma that may throw you off, because after first drink I was amazed at how complex this beer was. I will have to have again to peg down specific tastes. In general it was malty and felt creamy on the tongue. It was refreshing and strong. It had a very crisp finish. I could have easily skipped the other beers in my flight and just continued with this one."
"D - I started out sipping to enjoy the subtle complexities but quickly changes to gulping as I couldn't get enough of this near perfect porter... Add to that the fact that this comes in at 5.5% ABV, this is a truly sessionable porter... Terrific job by Deschutes, it's only a crying shame that this isn't available more widely than it currently is..."
"Deschutes outdoes themselves with this American Gem!"
"D: Very drinkable, especially for a porter with a flavor profile this big. Absolutely fantastic brew!"
"D: This beer lends itself to drinking no matter the weather."
"D- drinkability is good. easy going down, light enough to drink a lot of them."
"D: Well balanced beer and smooth flavors allow an ease of drinking. One sip invites another."
"Future outlook: Obtained in a trade and not available here...the price is apparantly quite reasonable....too bad. Not as good as their Obsidian Stout that I tried, but still quite solid."
"12oz. bottle received in a trade. I had a couple of these while I was in Portland but never took any notes on them. Poured a pitch black body with a tan head with great sticky lace. Smells of roasted coffee, toffee, maybe some chocolate in there. Taste is excellent, chocolate, coffee, more toffee as in the smell. Very velvety mouthfeel. Great porter."
"D: perfect session porter when drinking with buddys"
"taste is watery, chocolate italian ice, sour malt, and a little weak coffee, ends dry and a little bitter."
"medium body, very smooth, touch of astringency towards end. mild, tingly carbonation for extra body."
"Just an uncomplicated, perfectly balanced, classic robust porter..."
"Go get it, a great porter."
"This beer presents itself to me in a 12 oz bottle with a nice painting of Black Butte mountain with a setting sun and meandering river centered on the label. 5.2 abv is printed near the ""best by"" date. Poured into an imperial pint glass, this porter is a robust cocoa brown color, a shade shy of black, with orange-ruby highlights. Head is moderate, velvety and tan. There's a wonderful dry roasted grain aroma immediately evident on the nose. Inhale deeper and you'll get chocolate powder and some funk.Wonderfully balanced flavors consisting of chocolate, burnt angelfood cake, almonds, fig and cedar in the taste department. Hops provide a nice bittering counterpoint and just the slightest hint of citrus zest. Fantastic mouthfeel and nicely drawn out finish of caramel and chocolatyness and lactic acid. Very drinkable. A very good porter that sets the bar high for the style."
"Very good solid entry into the porter style if you're trying to figure them out. Pretty widely available, and based on that I think it's even better. Everyone should seek this out."
"Tonight, in Florida, this Black Butte Porter still stands out as one of the tastiest porters I can recall."
"Overall impression: Porters don't get much better than this one."
"Drinkability- smooth going down, very enjoyable, regular beer for me"
"An extremely drinkable porter. Not huge on the palate, but it has really pleasant characteristics, which are well integrated, and make for an astoundingly sessionable beer. I could certainly drink this all night. Unfortunately, I only have one bottle."
"Drinkability- Smooth and goes down easy."
"Overall: The mouth feel is creamy and very smooth. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium. This is a very tasty beer from the tap. I am very glad that I got to try."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass. The porter appears a clear dark chestnut color with about two fingers of lingering ecru foam. Nose and flavor are of milk and dark chocolate, slightly nutty, a hint of coffee/mocha, cocoa, sweet caramel, and hints of vanilla. A notch or two better than medium in body and amply carbonated. Tasty stuff. Certainly worth your time if you are a fan of the style."
"This is a great porter, one of the best i have had in fact. I might have to keep a steady supply of this in my fridge."
"Pretty drinkable due to a good flavor, nice balance, light body and dry finish. Pretty good beer."
"D - A very solid porter...my first offering from Deschutes and I want more...it was a little lighter in the body which makes for a decent session beer as it won't fill you up"
"thanks to ScreamForMe for the extra."
"D--A solid brew from Deschutes, but nothing spectacular. Would make for a good session drink but nothing more."
"D: An excellent Porter, one of the best I've had and well deserving all the credit it receives. My second Deschutes and the best by far, I can see why they've earned such a reputation as a solid Micro with great distribution. A recco and a must have if you're into darker brews."
"Verdict: Black Butte is smooth, chocolaty, and tasty as all hell. Well worth seeking out for fans of Porter, Deschutes have brewed up a solid example of the style here."
"Drinkability: A fine example of the style and probably one of the best I have ever had. Impressed by my first beer from Deschutes, too bad it is not available in Ohio."
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Blackish brown color, good clarity, fluffy beige head. Decent lacing. Lots of coffee in the aroma with a little ash and balancing chocolate sweetness. Lightly acidic roasted character with some dark fruits and burnt coffee. Medium-light bodied with a little too much carbonation. Solid beer."
"Overall Impression: The second beer tasted better than the first. An easy beer to drink, full flavored."
"D - This are extremely easy to drink and if I had more time, I would have drank a few more."
"overall a nice offering from deschutes..only my second since we dont get it in NC....would like to try more"
"Not heavy at all with an appropriate level of carbonation. Not the jaw-dropper I'd heard it made out to be, but a thoroughly enjoyable beer nonetheless."
"D: Tasty and well-crafted. A solid session porter if I've ever met one."
"On tap at Wolfgang Puck's in sunny Las Vegas, NV, with a burger and fries. Very dark with zillions of tiny bubbles rising to a shallow tan head. Aroma of vanilla, marshmallows and charcoal; pleasantly roasted and very inviting. The taste was fantastic: not overly toasted or burned, and the body was surprisingly thin for a porter. In fact, it went down quite well on a hot day. The carbonation is quite present, giving this a lighter feel. An instant favorite, and a nice alternative to traditionally denser porters (which I dearly love)."
"Overall this is one of the smoothest Porters I can remember having. Definitely worth a shot."
"Nice sessionable porter. Tasty, nicely proced, nicely made. What else ya want?"
"Pours a reddish brown that is quite clear. Smells of yeast, alcohol and roasted malts. First sip is tasty and rather light bodied with raisins, roasted malts, dark chocolate and coffee leading the way. Not bad at all. I would like to see more body on this one."
"For me, the taste is all about the nutty, roasty sweetness the malts bring to the table. So clean and inviting, I just love their beers. Light bodied for the style, but the flavor and creamy feel of the brew more than make up for it. A fine, fine ale...Im lovin it."
"D: This is a great example of a porter. Its balance is perfect and its tastes are easy to distinguish but it seems so complex. I like this one. Give it a go if you can."
"Drinkability - This beer gets a very mediocre praise from me. Not what I had hoped for at all, and pretty disappointed. If I ever want a porter, i'm going to the gold standard. Anchor is the best porter you can ever pour into your awaiting pint glass."
"This is a very good porter. One of the better American versions I have tried. Recommended."
"will definately buy more of this, one of my new favorites"
"D: A fine example of the style, and highly recommended. Very quaffable, thanks to the extra bit of carbonation."
"Drinkability: A solid, enjoyable porter, low in abv%, and reasonably sessionable. It's not the most groundbreaking porter, and the coffee notes are a little light and tart for my taste (I prefer my porters a little darker on the roast and sweeter in a different way), but it is a very consistent, pleasant brew. The lightness does actually help it work - despite being a porter - on this warm, 71 degree spring day. Recommended."
"HV"
"I saw in the Locators that people were paying $4 per 12 oz for this. I picked this up at Walgreens (yes, the drug store on Speedway and Country Club) for $9.99 for a 12 pack. And it wasn't mishandled. Unbelievable."
"- Very drinkable, and a very good porter sessional. Easily one of the easiest to drink that I have had.. perfect carbonation too."
"D: My first beer from Deschutes, surely not a dissapointment, but it makes me want to rip the wax of the Abyss sitting in my basement. Good looking beer that is not a choir to drink, just not particularly impressed."
"Pours a very dark brown black colored body, with a big frothy tan color head, decent sized bubbles. Roasted coffee aroma, but very light. Some effervescence and clean aromas. An odd kind of fruity scent, not sure what it is. Some smokiness too. Roasted light sweet coffee taste, not too heavy. Some creaminess and a somewhat watery body. Smokey flavor. Satisfying."
"Drinkability - I like Black Butte, but I don't love it. The roastiness is a little overwhelming, but it still sits decently well. I would have loved to have seen a bit more thickness in the body, but its not overly thin. I certainly have no problems drinking a Black Butte, but there's still a couple Porters I prefer."
"D- Excellent drinkability, great taste and low ABV."
"This is smooth yet full, not extremely flavorful, but everything - the visuals, the aromas, and the flavors - balance out well. A good beer to introduce your macro-lager-drinking cousin/buddy to who just isn't ready for the immensely chocolaty/coffee flavors of an Imperial Russian stout or even the smokiness of an Alaskan Brewing Co. smoked porter."
"Overall: Very drinkable, the flavors are smoothly blended together. Not too filling, a great go to porter, if only it was more accessible to me."
"This is not over the top on flavor, but it's good no-less. I can sense the roastiness in the mouth, but it is muted a bit. Some crisp dark chocolate flavor, finishes with a creamy milkiness. Well done. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth. Decent carbonation. Excellent drinkability. This is one of the best porters I've had the pleasure to enjoy. I could have a few of these for sure. Not too heavy, not too thin. Perfect."
"D: One of the best porters available in a 6-pack & is very easily found."
"I am a big fan of this beer. It is often one of my go to beers at get togethers because a sixer can last the night and you won't be groggy the next morning."
"D: An exceptional porter. I like Smuttynose Robust Porter a little better but this is great beer."
"A good craft session Porter that has been in my mix for awhile."
"cheers"
"D: One of my favorite, if not my favorite porter. I could drink this all night, very easily. Great flavors, mild alcohol. Awesome beer. This is the first ""craft"" beer that I ever had. And its still amazing after all the beers I've had. Highly recommended."
"I like SN Porter and Anchor Porter very much, but this one takes the cake. It is amazing and I recommend it heavily."
"D) I don't like porters, but I can drink this and be happy. I can see getting this again, which is really high praise."
"D- Excellent for the style. Could use a bit more hops?"
"Always buy this one in a six pack!"
"full aroma and taste, easy drinking... not much more you can ask for. if i had to drink five beers for the rest of my life, this would be one of them."
"Superbly drinkable."
"A great beer, one of my favorite porters. i love the hop choice in this beer, melds perfectly with the roasty malt. Highly recommend."
"This is a dark, dark brown brew with a light tan head that left a ring of lacing around the glass after each step. A interesting bouquet of raisins, sweetbread and some lingering hops in the background. Medium bodied and smooth on the palate. A light espresso flavor highlights the dark roasted malty nature. A small amount of spice enters the hop flavors toward the end and finishes smooth. This beer is well balanced, drinkable, and very tasty. To me, this beer embodies what porters are all about."
"Poured into bubble pint glass. Poured with about an inch of dark khaki colored head that left solid, sticky lacing. A black beer that is just barely translucent when held up to the light. Deep, rich roasty aromas with just a hint of coffee in the nose. This beer smells Goood! The taste expands upon the aroma, with that hint of coffee being well balanced by the rest of the malt. As you would expect, this is a full bodied, well rounded brew. This beer has the utmost drinkability, one could (and I have) spend hours at your local watering hole enjoying this toasted delight. A very good brew, as with most of Deschutes mainline products, a well made beer for a fair price. This brewery may be the best at matching quality with value."
"D: Very drinkable and very nice. This beer is easy drinking with som great flavors and aromas. Its not the most complex beer, but the flavors are excellent. I really wish this was local because a sixer would be in my fridge as we speak. Solid porter and solid beer."
"Overall, one of the more refreshing dark beers I've had. Absolutely perfect if you're looking for a beer that doesn't sacrifice flavor for complexity for drinkability."
"This stuff is just a classic from Deschutes. Flavorful Porter character packed in an easy drinking body that goes down very smooth and the ABV is right where I like it for the style. I could drink this all night."
"Bottle: Poured a medium clear black color porter with large light brown foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of black chocolate and light dry coffee notes are very pleasant. Taste is a nice mix between some bitter black chocolate notes with some light fry coffee and a subtle roasted malt bitter finish. Body is a bit too thin with some great carbonation. Very well done and something that IU would probably buy again if I had access to it."
"D - Easy to drink - as I drink this I don't feel the higher carbonation for the style is affecting my ability to drink it. ABV is very manageable. Flavors are very in balance and not overly assertive, so that works as well."
"Drinkability: True to it's style and very, very good. Hits the spot in almost any situation. Cork N' Bottle sells sixers of Black Butte for $6 - fucking awesome! Needless to say, we hit up Cork N' Bottle all the time. This is by far the most drinkable porter out there, and maybe the best all-around porter out there."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0901-Mike"
"Drinkability is really great on this one. Nice session beer. Drank 4 of them at the party. But by the 4th one it was a little tiresome. Not enough body to keep it going. But the first 2 were amazing."
"Pours a nice deep black color with a thin lifeless head. Decent belgoan lacing. Aroma of dark roasted malts, a good amount of chocolate and no hops. Taste is much the same as the smell, but maybe a little bit weaker. This is full of roasted malts that give off a great burnt feeling. There is a slight bitterness at the end, but nothing earth shattering. The mouthfeel was thin. Medium carbonation."
"So smooth and tasty that you want to drink more."
"Pours a very dark brown. Smells of roasted malts with a hint of chocolate and coffee. Tastes just as it smells but also has a perfect amount of hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium body with high carbonation, very smooth actually. Drinkability is very high, if only I could get it in Wisconsin on a regular basis. This beer reminds me of Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter."
"Reminded me of Anchor Porter, as you probably have guessed by now, as well as Great Lakes' Edmund Fitzgerald--kind of a cross between the two. One of the drier, though not necessarily more bitter, porters out there. Not really my thing--I'm more into Smuttynose robust porter's roastiness--but absolutey a well-crafted American take on the style. So glad I got the chance to try it."
"Overall, I was slightly disappointed with this offering after reading such high praise. I felt it was a little watery and not as flavorful as I was hoping. Still very drinkable, but not my first choice."
"A very good porter. Dark red brown liquid with good lacing. The nose is sweet and malty with just a touch of hops. The taste is full of sweet but dark chocolate malt with a good hop finish. There are very porter-ish charcoal notes. It's well-balanced and easy to drink. There's a nearly vinous quality to the sweetness. The mouthfeel is creamy and just wonderful for the relatively low alcohol content. This is an absolute must for fans of porters and an excellent beer for everyone else."
"Drinkability is high, I wish I had this one here."
"Pours a very dark almost black color with a frothy tan head. Smells of roasted malts, slightly sweet and a touch of hops. Tastes of strong roasted malts, coffee, chocolate and perfect balance of hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is full bodied and very smooth, this is a great porter I will definitely have this one again."
"Smooth and drinkable, thought I wish it had a bit more body. A very good porter, but not great."
"I could easily have two of these in a sitting."
"This beer pours dark brown with a nice frothy offwhite head that quickly disappears and leaves some nice tan lacing on the glass. Smells of chocolate and roasted malts. Tastes of dark chocolate and is nice and roasty. The taste is a little bitter which I like. The mouthfeel has medium body, slightly creamy and nicely carbinated. Drinkability is high on this one. One hell of an easy drinking porter that could be a staple in my fridge if it were easily available to me. I am enjoying this while visiting my folks in Boise. Also can't beat the price! Gotta love Michigan taxes."
"Poured a dark brown color with a 1-finger, fizzy head that fairly quickly bubbled down to a tan lace across the top. The smell was dominated by smoked malts, and it was strong and rich. I could just picture in my mind the malts being roasted over an open fire. The taste was a delicious balance of the malty and the bitter. The malty: thick chocolate malt flavor, which was as smokey as the smell would leave me to believe. The bitter: there was definitely a bitter hop presence to round off the taste, but there was also notes of coffee grinds and bittersweet chocolate. The taste lingered on long after the sip. While the body was medium, approaching on heavy, and carbonation was plentiful, leaving a sharpness to the aftertaste. The beer was flavorful, but not filling, and I could have easily had another one. A good catch."
"A world-class and enjoyable porter. Would never turn one of these down. Easy drinking too... alcohol well masked."
"At the moment, this is my very favorite beer. Thankfully, it's readily available at the local supermarket, lol. A very nice dark color. The smell is wonderful, and the taste is exceptional. Coffee and Chocolate, mmmm! I usually only drink a few beers a week. This porter is one of the very few beers I could go back for another, and another, and another, and another."
"7/4/7/4/15 (3.7/5)"
"Dark and roasty, but light bodied enough to be a session beer for those of us with cojones. Pours a beautiful, warm brown and carries you away with a well balanced array of coffee and chocolate flavors. My personal favorite (readily available) beer of all time, and very affordable as well!"
"A nice and strong, straightforward, no nonsense porter. It's roasty where it needs to be, the mouthfeel refuses to smooth over for sissies and the flavor profile and complexities of this beer forces you to take notice and pay attention."
"D - I was pleasantly surprised by the drinkability of this porter. I've had many Deschutes beers and they have yet to disappoint. I could have sat there and drank a couple more of these... but alas I had a flight to catch. Till next time!"
"D- i dont like this beer"
"D: Very drinkable. Goes down smoothly and welcomes more. I look forward to having it again."
"Pours a transparent dark brown, with a nice head that dissipates quickly. Smells of coffee and hay. Tastes of chocolate and coffee with a little tartness, giving this porter a different beat from the usual sweet or bitter. The mouthfeel is light, but satisfying."
"(rated May 17, 2007)"
"Pours a deep but translucent mahogany brown color with a rich, frothy tan head and some sticking/notching. Lots of creamy, semi-sweet, roasty toasty chocolate malt, subtle, not overly aromatic but very pleasant indeed. Creamy, rich chocolate malts invade the tongue first, sweet caramel, chalky coffee malts and cakey yeast round everything else out mid to late palate, orange and lemon notes on the finish from the bright hops used as well as an earthy, herbal-like note on the end/aftertaste. This isnt just your average bastardized stout with a porter label slapped on it, this one screams porter from the get go and never lets up. Light in body, crazy drinkable, slightly coating, bright in carbonation, great beer! Highly recommended."
"I find this very drinkable and a perfect end to an evening. Glad I found it out here in the northwest."
"Black appearing pour, when held up to the light it is rather dark brown throughout. Roast malt aromas, with surprisingly piney hop tones. Mouth feel is a bit lively, but mellows a bit to creamy. Flavor is not that overly descript with roast malt and peatiness. Finishes very clean, not much lingering. I was a little dissapointed with this one, possibly because I had the Obsidian stout previous, it seemed a little bit understated. Will have to give it another try, but I found it a bit average, albeit very drikable. Not going to poo poo it completely though, it is worth getting."
"D - This beer is a great example of why I love porters. Great thick coffee and chocolate flavors along with a sessionable alcohol level. A highly recommended porter!!!"
"Pours an excellent dark brown with a tiny head. Light aroma of chocolate. Smooth taste of bitter chocolate and crystal malt. The only complaint I had was that the flavors were very weak. Very light mouthfeel with no carbonation. A good beer, nonetheless."
"The color is a dark dark brown, almost opaque, with half a finger of tan head. Carbonation is just a tad weak. Smell mildly of coffee, chocolate, and malt. Taste is a nice moderate combination of those, plus a strong roasted component. Nice creamy mouthfeel, but like I said, carbonation could be a little more. Drinkable as hell, though--a solid porter that isn't trying to be a stout."
"Pours opaque blacks with a light tan head that stayed for a few moments and disappeared. Decent lacing while drinking. Very faint to the nose. I pick up roasted coffee but very little. This all changes however once it hits your mouth! Roasty coffee with a bitter bite at the end. The beer has a really smooth body which makes this very sessionable. I have tried the Obsidian Stout but it has been awhile, definitely would like to compare the two."
"A sixer of this beer would leave only the desire for more! Definitely a session beer."
"I love this beer. no matter when i get it i am going to smile. if you see this and haven't had it. get it. enjoy it. drink it again."
"Find it! Love it!"
"Overall impression: This is one of my favorite porters. Admittedly, this style isn't one in which I am extremely well-versed. But at 5.2% abv., Black Butte makes for a smooth, easy drinking, well-balanced session porter."
"Pours a very dark black that shows some ruby hues when held to light. Minimal tan head. Nose is a lot of coffee. Just loads of grinds. And the flavor brings it too. There's also a fair amount of vegetal tones. Thick with character, yes. Complexities? Middle of the road. But it matters little. This is an amazing porter."
"D. Good stuff. An enjoyable variety of flavors and aromas."
"D: great beer and just a couple would do. I plan on drinking many more of these. This beer needs to be enjoyed and nursed. Lots of flavors and interesting...great porter!"
"D: This is a smooth and balanced beer."
"All in all an above average brew that goes nice with dessert - can't wait to try the Black Butte XX."
"Can't wait to have another one."
"Pours a dark brown stream, with a small light brown head head, that has decent lacing. Smells smokey and roasted. Taste bittersweet, like smoke, chocolate, roasted malt. A slightly light feeling in the mouth, but very drinkable. Could be a session porter."
"Drinkability: a fine porter, would definitely drink again. Dark and flavorful."
"D - smooth and light tasting with a little clinging to the palate"
"Ultimately there are dozens of porters in the great Northwest that entertain the senses with greater amplitude and zeal than this one, at least as it's served on draught where it's brewed."
"Need to try another fresher one!"
"D- Easy to drink, nice solid porter. Tastes great on this cold night."
"The first time I've had this beer was at the festival and it was the most solid beer there! Sweet and tasty, served VERY cold and it was refreshing. Absolutely would buy this beer again."
"Easily one of the best Porters that I've tried. I think I've finally found something that is basically equal to Anchor, it's just a shame this stuff cannot be had around here. I wish Deschutes had the distribution of Rogue."
"Highly recommend this beer, as I am unfamiliar with the style and it fit me like an old shoe."
"d. Definitely highly drinkable. It's nice to see a relatively low ABV porter on the lighter side of taste and mouth. While I love a good strong porter, sometimes it's a bit excessive. And for when it is, Black Butte seems to be just about the perfect answer. Easily drinkable, and quite sessionable, if you like to session dark beers. A must try. And, as i've discovered, one of the best gateway porters for a non-porter/stout drinker. And that's always a good thing."
"Mouthfeel is thin and wet. Not an overpowering beer and pretty drinkable for a porter."
"Served from a bottle into a pint glass."
"I typically don't like standard porters, but this one was notable."
"Drinkability is very good for a porter. I could easily see having a few of these and not get bored from it."
"D Highly drinkable porter for big beer, big smell and big taste."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, but has a bit of bite taking away from the enjoyment slightly."
"Drinkability is moderate. Decent flavors, easy to session. Just seems pretty average to me. I can't believe this has such high ratings."
"Overall: not bad, give it a shot"
"Drinkability is great! The low ABV makes multiple enjoyment without major buzz!!"
"Not the most complex porter but it's really good. Tastes good and it's very sessionable."
"Pours a dark brown with ruby highlights but almost no head whatsoever. Aroma is of roasted malts and some chocolate. Taste follows the nose maybe adds some bread to the party. Creamy oily mouth with a lingering roast bitterness in the end. Decent brew, I could definitely see myself drink this is if were available in my area."
"Note: 5.2% per bottle."
"D-A couple would do."
"This is a very top class porter. highly recommended!"
"Definately impressed with this beer, and by the brewer. Another good sipping brew to enjoy with the friends or after dinner."
"Great dark malty flavor. Hits of coffee and figs. Very easy drinking porter. I could drink this all day long. Great session beer."
"pours stright up black with crimson edges. nice lacing. has a decent brown-tinted head. the nose is roasted malts, chocolate, vanilla bean, toffee. the taste is roasted malts, smoky, kinda cigar-ish flavor, vanilla bean, subtle spiced hops, medium body yet a very thin taste. low carbo, sweet start to a dry finish."
"Black Butte is pleasing, drinkable, and well-made. I'm having a hard time faulting it. Just wish I could get more! Recommended."
"A very well-balanced porter. Almost reaches stout category, but stops in time to stay in the style. Very drinkable. Another great beer from a great brewery!"
"Between the moderate abv, remarkable taste, and overall satisfaction, this is one of the most balanced drinkable beers I can recall having."
"This is one hell of a porter. Easy drinking and chalked full of classic porter flavors Bring on the cool so I can really enjoy brews like this."
"Deep black with a very thin head. Nice sweet aroma. Some chocolate and some sweet malt on the nose. Taste has some chocolate and some roasted malt flavor. Pretty full flavor, yet not overwhelmingly full bodied. Slick mouthfeel with a bit of a zing at the end of each sip. Good quality porter."
"D: Highly drinkable, I will without a doubt be having this beer again. I expect this will be a stand-by in the fridge."
"D: very nice, full flavored porter. nice roasted malts bring this one over the top. great representation of style."
"Mouthfeel is flat but full. Easy drinking. Nothing outstanding about it, but a pretty good beer!"
"D - I'm not a huge porter guy, but I love this beer and could easily see kicking a few pack on a cold night around a fire. A highly drinkable and possibly addictive porter with Big smell, Big Flavor, Big creamy mouthfeel, only $6.50 a six. What else can you ask for?"
"I think this one is special."
"Served in a standard pint glass. Poured an opaque dark brown, almost black, with maroon highlights around the edges. One inch, dense off-white head with excellent retention. Scent of malt with a roasted coffee character. Taste consistent with nose with a hint of dark chocolate and dry hopping detectable towards the finish. Mouthfeel is similar to a schwarzbier, but somewhat light-bodied for the style. Drinkability was quite good. Low abv and subdued flavors make this an easy drinking session porter. Solid representation of the style; however, somewhat lacking in flavor."
"Well attentuated, smooth and tasty. Not overly amazing, but right within style. Good job."
"Tastes like a rich robust brown. Strong caramel, chocolate, and motable sour from black patent. Blackberry (from Northern Brewer hops?), red berries, and dark fruits. Wet overall, but dries in the end due to dark grain edge and fine carbonation that forms readily on the papillae. Anise, nutmeg, scorched caramel & nuts. Big flavors upon the swallow, but little aftertaste leaves me wanting. Just vaporizes from the mouth. Md body, but some dextrinous character gives the appearance of more. Strong carbonation needed swirling to release to a pleasant level. Decent drinkability."
"Overall, I love this one. I usually could only try it during my trips to Colorado but now I'll be able to enjoy year end. With the low ABV, this is a definite session beer for me. Good to enjoy on a scorching Texas summer day. Part of regular rotation for sure."
"Another solid offering from Deschutes. Pours jet black with off-white head. It looks great though I though the head retention was somewhat poor, maybe that was my fault. Smell is of chocolate syrup, some earthiness (as in a bit of wood) and a bit of grassy hops. Taste is great a nice balance of chocolate, malt, some hops and bit of coffee (very small bit). Mouthfeel I found to be somewhat thin. Perhaps I was thinking more stout-ish but it seemed a little watery. Overall highly drinkable. Good taste, low alcohol, a good session beer. Best served at warmer temps."
"Poured a dark brown with light brown head. Very dark, no light through it. The aroma is a nice balance of chocolate and hops. Excellent taste, like the aroma I picked up a lot of chocolate with a hint of hops. A little bitterness. Good texture. A little on the heavy side, and the taste begins to wain after to many. One or two in a session is good."
"The body is moderate but the astringency helps give it a rounder feel. Good carbonation. Overall a pretty good porter."
"D - This is a killer porter! I like the smoke and charcoal notes, and it's assertive, but not so much so that it would overwhelm me after a few bottles. I believe that this is one of the most drinkable, although not one of the best, porters that I've ever had."
"I'm glad I got to try it."
"Drinkability: Despite mouth feel, bottle disappeared with remarkable haste. If anything, it reminded me to drink a tad slower, and enjoy the burnt flavour."
"Taste and mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy with flavors of cola, dark chocolate, coffee and biscuit. Medium-bodied. Dry in the finish and moderately bitter, but remarkably smooth on the whole. A very sessionable dark beer."
"dark cola brown with a nice tan head of foam. Decent lacing provides rings around the world. Aromas of dark roasted malts, and in the back a slight hoppiness coupled with hints of coffee and chocolate. Taste is the same, nice dark roasted malts, slight hop, a bit of bread, coffee, etc. Mouthfeel is medium for a porter. Drinkability is good. Solid."
"This is a very good Porter. I'm glad it's finally come to Texas."
"What can I say that hasn't been said, this is a kick ass beer for sure. Simply a classic that still has the ability to impress even the biggest geek. I love this beer. Highly recommended."
"D - excellent, quite possibly the best porter I'll ever have."
"Dark mahogany color with a nice tan head. Some roasty malts and caramel in the nose. The taste has a big malt profile as well. Quite sweet with a little roastiness. The medium body goes down well. This is a good porter, just a little one dimmensional in my book. A decent drinker though."
"Notes: Overall a very nice tasting and drinkable porter."
"Nice medium light mouthfeel, it finishes semi bitter with just a touch of tartness. Very very good Porter and very drinkable. I fell ""in love"" with this one the first time I tried it years ago. Cerainly, one of the better American Porters I've tried."
"Serving type: multiple bottles:)"
"M/D: Very light body actually to light for my taste in a porter but it is grainy and does have a decent feel. The drinkability is amazing it really makes you want to sip and savor and enjoy everything about the beer. I highly recommend this one. Another great beer from Deschutes Brewing."
"d: Thanks to JohnGalt1 for this stellar porter. I wish it was a local offering."
"That would be cheating though. Porter is a beer style which I thought had all but disappeared but I'm very glad to see a resurgence, and this is one of the finest examples you're likely to experience. A top class brew by any stretch of the imagination. Dark beers such as this aren't to everyone's taste and there's nothing big or clever or better about being a dark beer fan compared to those who prefer lighter brews. But I must admit... those of of us who prefer the darker beers have more fun ;-)"
"M/D - Medium to full bodied and very drinkable. Just the right amount of carbonation."
"D: A sessionable porter if there ever was one. A great example of the style. A must have if you like porters."
"Nice. A very tasty Porter."
"Whoa this is an easy to drink beer. The smooth slick liquid has a lower carbonation that enhances the dark malt flavors. This is a very well brewed beer that has a good balance of typical porter flavors. Not the most complex porter but one that is very magically delicious."
"D - Good brew that is definately work trying. Lower ABV makes it a good brew to enjoy several of. Wish the bartender wasn't trying to do me any favors. I'll say something next round."
"Deschutes continues to impress me. This is a very nice porter. It's not world class by any means. But, if you're looking for a relatively light, easy drinking porter, this is certainly a worthy candidate. The nose could stand to be strengthened a little. But, other than that, this is a very fine beer. Certainly worth checking out."
"Overall, an excellent porter especially for those first getting into porters (due to it's easy drinking characteristics)."
"It's a good porter that I would go back to if given the chance."
"D: Wow, this is one easy drinking porter. Very glad to have gotten some."
"Very sessionable-drinks lighter than it looks and feels"
"Overall, a delicious porter. Porter is my favorite style, and this is one of the finer porters I've had. Balanced, easy to drink, and great flavor. My hat's off to Deschutes Brewery..."
"The mouthfeel is nothing short of wonderful. I got a chance to try this American Porter at the Seattle Airport as I was leaving and I couldn't have ended my stay on any other note."
"Pours a nice head that falls leaving behind a thin layer that doesn't break and a great lacing the leaves a wall of foam over parts of the glass. Smell is chocolately with a little roastiness. Taste is slightly chocolatey with a nice light roasty flavor. Body is medium bodied with some good smooth carbonation that doesn't bite (cause I poured hard to get good head). I enjoyed this beer very much and think it's very drinkable, I got 3 in this trade and I want tto drink some more already."
"This beer is very drinkable, and easy to enjoy."
"drinkability maybe goes down because i do believe this is a beer for porter/stout fans and you'll be sorry if you chose to bing drink with this beer. I recommend this beer to anybody who likes porters"
"I understand that the hopping of American porters varies widely, and this one is on the heavily-hopped end of the scale. For this reason, I probably won't have it again."
"also the bottles should start showing up around october or so 2008."
"MF/D: Smooth and excellently drinkable, I had three of these before I knew what hit me. I'm a big fan, so much so that the next day I went out and scooped up a sixer - which isn't quite as good as on draught, but still excellent."
"mouthfeel and drinkability: smooth and a solid no-nonsense porter. a goto beer."
"Really tasty, though subtle, too. It's an easy drinking porter, making it very sessionable. Definitely let this one warm up as it really comes alive after 10 minutes or so out of the fridge."
"D - Exceptional. This is a fantastic porter. Easily the best I have had in the ""mild"" porter category. Drinking a six pack of this is a fantastic way to spend an evening."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. Dark with a very small head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is coffee at first, but then an almost equal amount of chocolate kicks in. Taste is extremely similar with the coffee edging out the chocolate slightly. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, and there is perhaps a little too much carbonation. Overall this is a very easy drinking, delicious beer."
"Great porter, one of the best. Simple but done nearly perfect."
"Dark ruby brown/almost black colored pour with a nice tan head. Smell was mild but nice and of dark roast malt. Taste was dark and roasty bordering burnt. Mouthfeel was a bit too light, but was nicely carbonated. Could stand to be a touch thicker, and bolder, but still a nice roasty taste and a decent easy drinking porter"
"This is an easy to drink, well balanced porter that I will try again."
"A fine beer that I'm thrilled I got a chance to try. I can't put it in the upper eschelon of robust porters but it's something I'd definitely order if I saw it out anyplace."
"I saw this on sale for 12.99/12 today and thought what the hell? Nice black color with a light tan head. It smells roasty, malty and slightly meaty. The flavor is roasty and robust. I was really surprised at how strong the flavor actually was, nice. The drinkability is awesome, I killed one in about fifteen minutes (not normal for me). Deschutes is doing great things with their beers and I will be buying the Double Black Butte when it hits Colorado this summer."
"creamy and smooth coffee and rich malt. Very drinkable, not strong and certainly the Black Butte Porter is not delegated to deserts and limited food pairings. A really good session beer."
"d: Goes down easy thanks to good balance and a lighter body. Not too filling, I would drink another if I had one. A solid brew."
"Poured a black but not opaque body with a minimal white head. Smell was very light with mild roast ash and some chocolate. Taste was a little underwhelming. That ash flavor tasted more like burnt coffee when drunk. Hops were not pronounced as to be expected with the style. The mouth feel was thin and watery. There was a certain acidic flavor to this one as it went down reminiscent of coffee at work that had sat out too long. This beer is very well crafted in that there is a good overall balance of flavor, a light crisp quality, and it lets some of the key flavors shine forward-I just wasn't a huge fan of those flavors."
"Excellent session beer. Excellent porter. One of the best I've had. I forgot who sent me this beer, but please send me more."
"The drinkabilty was worldclass. This is a great American standard up there with Anchor Steam porter. Great dry finish that leaves you thirsty for more!"
"Really smooth beer."
"D - Very drinkable. This is one of my go to beers. At 5.5% ABV they go down nice and easy."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is a very good beer to sit back and relax with for a long time. It’s one that you can drink several of but is more of a sipper than a pounder, despite not having a very high ABV."
"the color is second to none, a black frost of brew."
"D: I could drink this all night if I had the constitution for it. Definitely worth the price of admission. Too bad I don't live in Oregon. I bet it's wonderful on tap."
"Exceptional beer. Why is this still not available locally?!? One day it shall show up and there shall be immediate and great rejoicing throughout the land."
"Along with Anchor, the best American porter I've tried thus far."
"D: wow, very tasty but also low abv, so I could enjoy several in an evening, great"
"Poured out a very nice dark tan color, foamy haead, lots of head residue around the top of the glass. smells very good,coffee, chocolate, malts, mocha, smokiness coming through. mmm, malty savory on the palate, actually quite a light mouthfeel, very easy drinkability. the sweetness really plays against the slight tartness on the finish. actually enjoy this more than sierra nevadas porter, not quite so hoppy. loved this bier!"
"Pours a dark mahogany and slight ruby accents with with a bubbly two finger tan head that left moderate lacing on the walls of my glass. Good toasted malt and roasted grain dominate the nose. The taste matches the nose quite well. Very strong on the roasted malt and hop flavor with coffee and bitter chocolate making their way onto the back of your palate. It has a very dry finish that is slightly sweet at the end. The mouthfeel is the winner on this beer for me. Silky smooth texture that borders almost creamy. This is a great drinking porter that is just overall a great beer."
"IMHO, this is a staple American porter... Deschutes has a fanastic lineup of beers, and this is one of the best."
"the first thing I have noticed about this beer is the smell of aspagras in the nose. the appearance is nice, a good lacey head light brown in color, and a nice ebony body. I also taste the aspagras from the middle through out the finish, and it's not at all a bad thing, actually it complements the rest of the standard porter tastes. the mouth-feel is smooth and easy, like a good porter should be, and it drinks easy, as you'd expect with a mouth-feel like it has. a good brew"
"M/D: Full bodied, but on the lighter side of full, with decent carbonation. Drinkability is good as I could probably have a couple of these, no problem. Only thing that takes away from the brew is the taste, but I feel like it may be more due to my taste rather than quality of the beer."
"D: Very drinkable. Tasty and absolutely perfect after 14 hours of snow removal."
"D - A good session porter! Very balanced and smooth. I'll go out to buy more!"
"D - Well balanced and very drinkable, but maybe a touch too heavy to be a session porter. Still, this is an excellent example of the style and a good choice anytime."
"Very impressive Porter. The beer begins with a nice, medium viscocity with a lighlty tanned head that has terrific staying power. Aromas of roasted malts, toasty sweetness, and bittersweet chocolate, and a hint of citrus hops. Flavors closely mimic the aromas with emphasis on the roasted malts and a backup hint of orange rinds. Very clean textured with a crisp, fairly clean finish. This beer has enough character and power to substantiate the best of the Porter style, with basically no off flavors at all. Pure and simple."
"Overall: I measure all my porters against what I feel is the greatest in the world Jack The Quaffer which is brewed locally by Tampa Bay Brewing Company. This is a good porter but does not stack up to that one. It is lacking in flavor and taste in comparison. All of that being said though I enjoyed this beer. It was a nice drinking porter."
"You like your porters roasty? This is your beer. I mean this is damn near a stout, but some milder brown and chocolate malts seem to pull it back in the direction of a porter. It also doesn't seem to has the rough bitterness that can come with a big stout, instead, this porter is very drinkable and a good candidate for a session. All in all, a winner."
"This is one of my favorate Porter's. This beer pours nicely, but comes up short in appearance due to a head that falls fairly fast. I do like the legs that are left in the glass and the ever so slight amber hue. This beer's aroma is great and blends nice with the flavor of nuts, chocolate, coffee and caramel. I recomend this beer to anyone seeking a great tasting brown porter."
"The thinness of this porter creates a rather weak flavor profile. This makes it a drinkable beer, but unfortunately not very memorable. I doubt I'll ever feel the urge to pick this up again."
"Appearance is not very viscous, with decent head formation that is somewhere between the industrial looking head you'd find on a BMC beer and the head of tiny bubbles you'd expect from a beer with secondary fermentation (appropriate, I'd say for a craft beer not secondarily fermented). Aroma is not overpowering, but is roasty. Flavor is quite good. Decently roasty, lots of dry-roasted coffee flavor, with just a touch of sourness as it warmed a bit. Mouthfeel was smooth with a hint of chalky mouthfeel. Quite good and definitely recommended."
"i am happy this is a brew i can get locally, it will be a staple in my house this winter."
"Overall- Quite good. A touch sweet but a good dessert beer regardless."
"D: Excellent brew. I'm already sorry I ran out. I'm even sorrier I let my brother-in-law have the last bottle."
"Pours nearly black with a controllable tan head that will grow about as big as your pour is aggressive. Web-like lacing washes over the inside of the glass as the foam slowly sinks. The aroma is so familiar to me that I really just know it as Black Butte Porter. I could identify it 10 out of 10 times in a blind tasting much like most of the Deschutes offerings. This is the first time I've actually sat and attempted to consciously dissect its bouquet, though. Roasted malts manifest themselves as hints of chocolate, cashews and chocolate covered raisins. There is also a noticeable hop presence and faint alcohol as well. The taste is much like the aroma. Chocolatey, nutty and a bit hoppy. Oh, and there's definite coffee with 2 sugars character in here as well. The alcohol is almost imperceptible. The mouthfeel is soft and a bit watery if you've been drinking a lot of double stouts lately like I have. Not a lot of carbonation with this one. This is an excellent porter though, whose representation of the style is generally what I measure all others up against. Next time you hear somebody blindly state that they don't like dark beers, hand them one of these. Or a Speedway. haha. I totally just lol'd. LOL!"
"The Black Butte is one of the first micros I had back in the early 90's. It pours a dark barely see though pint with a small foam head that leaves it's artwork on the side of the glass. The smell is roasted maltiness with a hint of chocolate. I taste a smoky flavor to the beer. The mouthfeel is awesome with the porter enveloping your palate with chewy body. This has to be one of my favorite porters."
"This one was a very dark brown with chestnut, nearly purple, highlights. A short tan cap formed after the pour and showed good head retention and formed a bit of fine lacing. The dominant aroma at first was a burnt nuttiness. This was followed by malted milk, semi-sweet chocolate, and a hint of licorice. Mild bitterness throughout, this beer was quite malty, with dry cocoa and chocolate notes, a bit of licorice, and a kiss of grassy hops at the finish. Medium to full bodied and very smooth due to lowish carbonation. Solid malt texture. Very nice! Great balance with just enough complexity to stay interesting, but not messy at all. Quite enjoyable."
"D: I really liked this beer, it is very well made and easy to drink, making it a great session porter, out of the tap or out of the bottle, I should buy this more often than I usually do, another good beer from Deschutes."
"Comment: Overall a decent porter. It is a solid beer in a line of fine beers from an excellent NW brewery."
"Recommended"
"Good porter."
"First few sips didn't excite, but it got better and better. A good example of the style."
"This beer has been solid to me since the first time I tried it. Not until it was readily available to me when farther West did I realize how great it truly was. Pours a deep brown with that consistently creamy head that leaves chunks of lacing down the glass. Smell is fairly subtle but inviting. Chocolate, light roast, some grain, faint green hops lying underneath. Taste is excellent. Not necessarily bursting with flavor but extremely smooth and satisfying. Again, nice balance of chocolate, crystal malt and roast flavors up front, meshing with light grain flavor again. Hops provide the smallest nibble in the finish but not to a noticeably bitter or dry degree, just letting their presence be known. Mouthfeel is creamy, with carbonation suitable for the style. If I could choose any Porter as my staple, it would more than likely be this one. Complex enough and definitely one of the more easily approachable Porters out there in my book. Drinkable? No question."
"Pours a rich, deep dark black, with a creamy 2 inch brown head that slowly dies down to leave bubbles all along the top. Smell is malty, and a tiny bit of hops. Taste is sweet malty, with some cocoa and a slim smoky taste that is present in every other sip. Smooth in the carbonation creating a rich body to the back end of this beer."
"Drinkability- A fairly low ABV and subtle flavors make this a highly drinkable beer. Doesnt have the overbearing, brash flavors that some of the bigger stouts and porters have that make them fairly hard to enjoy more than a couple. This is a terrific beer that I enjoy very very much."
"Pours deep dark opaque brown with a little ruby when held to a strong light. Nice chocolate milk head that dies down and laces. Smells a mild sweet malt with toasted nuts and a hint of hops. Tastes of malt, mild coffee and a slight bitterness of hops. Mouth feel is smoooth. Zero alcohol. Almost a brown ale smooth with lively carbonation. This is an awesome session beer, especially for a porter."
"Overall a very fine beer here. A good quality well rounded session porter. I would definatly buy this again."
"On tap at Anna Banana's in Honolulu. Pint of dark brownness, good carbonation, thin opaque tan head; not much retention, no lacing. Smell was faint, but inviting. Sweet and roasted malts --roasted coffee, dried fruit, light brown sugar, slight chocolate. Nice. Nicely balanced, if a bit on the sweet side -- a lot of fruit and nut comes through -- a delicious porter. Mouthfeel is a bit watery for the style, but that helps it go down easy. A tasty porter for the summer, but I'd want something a little hardier if I were a doorman on a cold, damp London evening."
"Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: if in the right mood this is dangerously drinkable...very good beer!"
"I'm normally not into Porters, but this one may change that. The dark color may scare off some, but once the aroma of coffee and vanilla hits the nose, and the smooth, malty taste hits the lips, any fear will be displaced. Can't wait to get back to the Northwest to enjoy this one again."
"Very drinkable. I could kill a sixer of this without even knowing it. It went really well with the oysters, too."
"Drinkability: I think it must be the roasty, black malt flavors that push the BJCP to classify this beer as a Robust Porter. However, in other regards, it's a lot lighter and smoother on the palate than other Robust Porters I've tried. It actually reminds me of a tasty Schwartzbeer I had recently. My overall impression is that it is heavy on the roasted flavors, a little light on the chocolate notes that I usually prefer in a porter, yet I'd still recommend it to friends. And better yet, I'd still seek it out. Porter is one of my favorite styles, so it'd be interesting to line this up against Great Lakes' Edmund Fitzgerald, Bell's Porter, and Sierra Nevada's Porter to see where in that line it fits."
"Pours dark brown to ""light balck"" into my glass. Sitting in it is an adventure unexplored. In the nose, there's some fruit, sweetness, and some smokiness. The flavor is not to be undone with its touch of chocolate, its own hickory smoke, and a long, appealing roasted finish on the tongue. This one went down the hatch very easy, which was a bit surprising for me."
"D- lucky for me this is a local brewery and it's available all over up in the NW i could add this one to the fridge."
"A good solid porter from Deschutes that would be a common occurance in my fridge if it was available in this neck of the woods."
"D - A great example of an american porter- a malty, roasty, dark chocolate flavored beer with flavor to spare. Sweet and mellow, subtle but not dull. Easy to get caught up in the moment and the experience of a Black Butte."
"Major malts present in the flavor, while dark chocolate, bitter coffee, and a doughy note are also entertained. It's quite tasty, if not a bit unbalanced on the malty side. Mouthfeel is the low point of this beer, it's a bit flat and watery, with not much of a kick, bitter or otherwise. Overall, though, this beer is a good one for its style and a beer I'll be looking for again."
"I have been drinking this beer for a while, and will continue. What a great porter! I consider myself a lucky guy in that this is my wife's favorite beer. I certainly don't mind keeping this around in the fridge. It's not a summer afternoon thirst quencher, but it hits the spot more often than not."
"Pours a very dark brown color with one finger off white head. Aroma is big on chocolate with some roasty malts, carmel and coffee. Taste follows nose with a roasty bittersweet chocolate flavor. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin and watery side but it's okay. Fine porter."
"Drinkability - This was a pleasure to drink."
"Drinkability- One of the top american porters out there. This is one of my regulars that I finally got around to rating. Another superb job from Deschutes."
"drinkability is good. this one is quite nice and i enjoyed it."
"D: Excellent beer, rich chocolate, very filling, a great desert beer"
"D: An excellent porter! Very well balanced with a big roasted malt presence. I wish I had this readily available in my area as this would be a regular in my refrigerator."
"Drinkability: this is one of the most drinkable porters I've had. It's not too heavy like others...you'll likely find yourself downing this about as fast as you would a Pale Ale...seriously."
"D: I am very impressed with this porter, it has a bit of a sour/tart edge that a good porter needs and the thick body never lets down."
"A nice and enjoyable porter. Affordable too. Not my favorite, but I'll probably get this again."
"This is an all around great tasting beer from start to finish. It pours out almost a black in color with a caramel color head. When you first take a drink it has a malt taste with a nice chocolate finish. The hops are just right not too much. It sometimes reminds me of eating an ice cream sandwich. The IBUs: 30 and the alcohol by Vol.5.2%. Its a wonderful beer you can drink all day. I like to think its the perfect breakfast or camping beer. I drink this beer everyday."
"A pretty good porter. I'd have more."
"Bottle. Pours dark brownish-black with hints of red. Initially a thick cream-colored head, which disappears quickly. Some lacing. The smell is bland and mainly just of alcohol with some malt, but not strong. Initially it's bubbly and bitter with a strong alcohol taste, but the aftertaste and late-palate taste is strongly of roasted malts with just a hint of chocolate. Less of a body and taste than the Obsidian stout, to be sure, but similar in appearance and mouthfeel."
"Best By 5/31/07. Murky dark chestnut with cola brown highlights and a crater-pocked sand-khaki head. Sturdily sour black patent malt aroma with earthy hops and mineral twang grabbing honorable mention. Immediately sourish, but then a startlingly ash-like roasted flavor kicks in, rounding off into a plum-like sweet/sour finish. The burnt earthiness mentioned above returns during the aftertaste to dry out the palate for a spell. Soured malts haunt the burps. Leafy-earthy hop notes. Superb lacing, clumpy webby and all. Full and satisfying mouthfeel; smooth, creamy, and substantial. Not the most outstanding porter to have crossed my lips, but certainly a worthy candidate for repeat consumption."
"Drinkability: a wonderful example of a world-class porter, passes the two-pint test easily. A BJCP exemplar of the style, with good reason. One of my favorite robust porters, and unfortunately one that is very difficult to obtain in NJ. I savor every one I manage to obtain."
"D- drinkable, though probably better warmer, good sessionable brew, tops for porters, but i'd prefer a stout"
"This is a benchmark for porters."
"D - Another winner from Deschutes. I have enjoyed all their beers I have tried and this one would be an everyday drinker if it were available to me."
"App. - 3, Smell - 3, Taste - 3.5 Mouthfeel - 3, Drinkability - 3.5"
"Poured into a pint glass, the Black Butte is a deep, dark, cola like garnet color with a big tan head that quickly faded to a small collar leaving slight lace. The aroma is very faint, sweet and malty. The flavor is similarly scant, sweet and toasted malt, coffee, and very slight finish of bittering hops. The mouthfeel was very thin and watery. In as much as this Porter was incredibly inoffensive and light bodied, it could be considered to be highly drinkable...however, there was nothing about Black Butte that made me want to have more then one."
"Overall, I wasn't really that impressed. It's not a bad beer - it just couldn't keep me interested. I will give this another try from the tap sometime and see if I like it better that way."
"D: An excellent porter that's well balanced. Easy drinking brew here. Definitely a colder month session brew. Recommended for sure."
"I like this brew. Very good."
"It's not a thick tasting porter but still has a good creamy feel to it. Goes well with falafel, fruit, and feta."
"This isnt a terrible beer, but it is rather humdrum. The mouthfeel also is fairly weak. I bought a sixer of this, probably will not be purchasing again."
"Pours a dark black color with a creamy tan head that leaves a good amount of lacing around the glass. The aroma is dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, and a hint of coffee and hops. The taste is extremely smooth and slightly sweet but the dark roasted maltiness is what steals the show. Overall, this is definitely a top-tier porter that is highly drinkable. I wish this brew was distributed down here because it would surely be a staple in my fridge."
"Dark and black in appearance with a slight beige head. Sweet smells of malt and hops. Sweet and rich in taste with a nutty and roasted finish. Truely enjoy this beer. It is well done, incredibly balanced, and overly drinkable. I do prefer the porters. But, too often, it's hard to find one that's not overdone. You know, strong in the roasting, strong overt tastes, et al.A good balanced porter is a great thing. I've found three so far. Edmund Fitzgearald, Cutthroat, and now Black Butte."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a few rough edges around the mouth. The beer has a somewhat stinging carbonation. If the carbonation was a bit less this would rate higher. This is still a dam fine beer and I would have it again any chance I get."
"While this isn't a great porter, it has it good qualities. And the main one being this is very drinkable. It's light enough that you could drink a few of these in a session. But other than that, this is just a bit above average... I prefer others."
"Another highly enjoyable beer from Deschutes. Thanks to my brother for picking this up."
"Drinkability: Very quaffable, and probably a good stepping stone for those a little apprehensive to darker beers or unfamiliar with porters. Still, there are some mineral aromas and flavors in this beer, perhaps from the mountain water Deschutes uses, that I found distracting and not appropriate for the style."
"[Thanks to msubulldog25 for another Northwest treat!]"
"Pretty much full bodied and rich. I could drink a bunch of these  damn the waistline!"
"This is a great porter here. A perfect brew to sit down and relax with while you enjoy those fall/winter evenings. The heartiness of the toasted malts and coffee/chocolate flavors really go well with cold weather conditions in my opinion. Definitely a recommended brew here, and possibly a new session porter for me."
"A delicious porter all-around with good drinkability. I could slug a few of these down with little effort."
"D- It is a really watery taste. Easy to drink but do you really want to drink a lot of it? I wouldn't."
"D - amazing. such a surpise. this beer is fantastic!"
"A good Porter. Nice to find this one locally."
"Drinkability: Judging by the depletion of the sixer I purchased a few hours ago, I'd say it's pretty drinkable. The 5 feels insufficient."
"Simply a great porter!"
"Drinkability- This certainly is an approachable and delicious porter. It has good character and manages to go down nice and easy at the same time. 4's all around"
"[ serving type: bottle ]"
"I absoloutly loved this porter, very understated flavors concitering some of the big beers of the style that around but nonetheless very enjoyable. The beer had a nice dark brown color with a good creamy brown head. The smell was great with scents of burnt grain and sweet malt. The flavors were great with a slight acidic snap in the beginning and then the flavors of roasted malts and coffee mixed in. Add to that the nice dry finnish and you have a wonderfully drinkable brew."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice smooth carbonation. A very good porter that I'm glad I picked up while in Spokane, WA."
"Hearty choco flavor with a hint of piney hops on the finish. About as bitter as fine dark chocolate. Medium bodied with enough carbonation to make it drinkable. Hearty, filling, tasty, and worth a few."
"Thanks, malthead, for the opportunity and, younger35, for the second chance"
"I'd love for someone to reccomend a superb porter.. though i find it hard to trust peers that have an affinity for beers such as this."
"Overall, a great beer. The bad pour at the restuarant may have even negatively affected this brew. I will have to try again from the bottle."
"Pours a one finger light tan head that fades to a ring leaving traces of lace. Deep mahogany color. Light carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Roasted coffee nose. Starts with a bitter chocolate/roasted coffee flavor, very smooth, bakers chocolate finish. $1.30 for a 12oz bottle from Liquid Solutions Tigard, Or."
"mouthfeel and drinkability: smooth and a solid no-nonsense porter. a goto beer."
"Mouthfeel is on the thin side, but appropriate for the style and not without some heft. Fairly lively carbonation (which is a bit distracting to me), could be down-played by decanting into another vessel. A solid and widely available session Porter."
"Thanks to Zorro for the opportunity to try this beer."
"Excellent after-dinner beer."
"This beer poured from the tap a dark brown with nice ruby highlights. Not much retention from the tan colored head. The aroma is dark caramel, mild grapefruit and a nice roasted barley. Flavor is dark caramel up front, a bit of roast malt with a mild hop finish. Remarkably sweet as I first drink it. The roasted barley really tones it down on the finish. Slick and oily, nice drinkability"
"Very tasty Porter that's easy to recommend, if you like this style, you'll be pleased with this one"
"D - Very drinkable. A very tasty brew from Deschutes. Deschutes is becoming a favorite of mine lately. Highly recommeded."
"Outstanding porter from Deschutes. Glad I was able to wrest this bottle from my parents after they took a trip to the PNW."
"Gold - Brown Porter Category - 1996 GABF"
"Overall, I wasn't exactly thrilled with this, but still a very nice little porter."
"Drinkability: exceptional is the only way to describe this. I wish I could get this on the east coast. A fresh pint on tap doesn't get much better than this."
"Pours to an opaque black, with a thick tan head, and medium lacing throughout drink. Aroma of nuts, chocaolate and toffee. Taste at early glass mostly of chocolate and malt, but alcohol starts slipping into the taste at mid-bottle. Nice, smooth finish. Very good porter."
"I can't say enough about this beer. I drink the hell out of it when I'm out west. It is absolutely oustanding. It is, in my humble opinion, one of the top five porters that I've ever tried. I hope to get to visit the brewery someday just so I can laud praise on the purveyors of such a heavenly elixir. If it were available locally I might be an out and out sot. As it stands I'm just a sot. If you ever have the chance to sample, purchase or come into contact with this beer please do so, you will be very glad you did."
"D: A well-crafted, well-balanced beer. Not heavy, very drinkable. Easy to have more than one. Good for all seasons, too."
"Very dark head with excellent retention, a very inviting appearance. Chocolate aroma is apparent but not overwhelming, just right. Hoppiest porter I've ever smelled, very good. A very well balanced beer, chocolatey yet it doesn't hide the hops. Even better on tap. Heavy, nearly syrup-like feel. Could use slightly more carbonation, feels a little flat. I enjoy this beer more every time I drink one, definitely the best porter out there. Highly recommend!"
"This is a real good example of a great beer offered for a reasonable price. When I lived in Juneau, Alaska I used to buy this beer for about 11.99 a 12 pack. I would have easily paid about fifteen to eighteen dollars a 12 pack. My favorite time to drink this beer would be after a hard day of work on a night when I really didn't want to get wasted but still have a few beers to kick back and relax with. The Black Butte Porter doesn't have the initial acidic taste that most porters have. It's very smooth and filling, but doesn't have the side effects that a lot of the lousy porters I've had in this country. If you live in the Northwest then you should consider yourself lucky to be able to ingest in this great and affordable beer."
"A nice porter. Pours deep mahogany with a well-proportioned tan head. The aroma isnt that strong, but is roasty with some chocolate and caramel notes. A flavor of toasted nuts, is very well balanced by some semi-sweet chocolate and light earthy hops. The finish reminds one of mocha coffee emitting a charred oak aftertaste. This is pretty tasty."
"Slightly less impressive as you get towards the bottom of the glass, not sure why, the flavor seemed to fade somewhat."
"Pours with a medium-dark brown, cola colored body and thin rim of tan head. Smells mellow, a bit sweet, very Maris Otter-ish. Body is a bit thin, but it's full-tasting; a caramel sweetness comes through along with a slight toasty bite. Prominent fizziness combines with the thin body to give it a nice clean palate; bitterness is not too prominent. One bottle doesn't put you on your ass, but it's not exactly a session beer either."
"Poured a thick, creamy, dark chestnut colored head that held forever. Opaque cola colored beer has a ruby hue around the bottom edges where streams of tiny bubbles release. Looking good so far. Roasted and charred malts in the aroma with a bit of soft marshmallow thrown in. The dark malts continue into the flavor with a bit cocoa thrown in. There are some hops in there that I can't put my finger on. I want to say it's a mint flavor, but that doens't make much sense. Maybe pine? Anyway, time to move on. It's a moderately dry beer that still manages to be rich in flavor. This is the 5th beer in the 6 pack, and I must say I'm becoming even more enamored. I was expecting a decent, but fairly bland beer. Boy was I wrong. Amazingly solid and addictive. Too bad I can't get it in NY:-("
"Wow, this is good. One of the better porters I've sampled. Perfect balance of sweet and bitter with a creamy smooth mouthfeel. A great after dinner brew. Deschutes cranks out some very good beer, and I feel this is their best offering."
"Overall impression: Nicely balanced porter. This one is a good combination of sweet flavors and roasted, without being overpowering in either direction."
"One of the finest porters I've had to date. In my opinion its a top 5 porter, not quite Samuel Smiths but then again who is."
"With a name like Black Butte Porter you would think it would give you a connotation of something very robust and hearty. It was lacking in this respect, however a very good rendition of an American Porter. Poured to a very opaque brown with ample head and lacing. Roasted chocolate malts were quite apparent to the nose. Quite thin, almost watery. Needs a tad more kick in the taste department. Other BA's have mentioned that this beer would be an acceptable alternative to coffee after a meal. I concur 100%. It has that wind down appeal to it."
"I think this beer would make a great session beer. It is low in alcohol, so that is not going to be a problem. Also, it tastes great. I will definately have this again."
"A wonderfully flavorful American Porter. Really pleasant and drinkable."
"D: Very drinkable, but a little Co2 & malt heft was needed to push this up the charts"
"D: Overall this is a very drinkable porter. Probably not my favorite beer from Deschutes but a very nice beer nevertheless."
"Incredibly drinkable porter. I could enjoy one of these anytime."
"This is one hell of an easy drinking porter to say the least. Mild yet flavorful this is probably one of the few porters I would recommend to lure a hard core macro-brew drinker in to the world of craft beer. Porter isn't my favorite style but this is one hell of a tasty and enjoyable beer."
"Overall: A fantastic surprise to get such a great brew when I least expected it; it really was a great way to end the night, a very tasty and immensely flavorful yet smooth and quaffable offering. So much so that the 1 pint turned into 3 and a missed last Bus. Very drinkable and well worth the walk home!!"
"Overall, a wonderful beer that I have had many times and will certainly have again. A beer that you can sit around and drink slowly...a beer to be enjoyed comfortably, not rushed."
"Served on tap it arrived with a tan head nearly two fingers thick, decent retention. Color is a very dark black. Strong notes of coffee, licorice, and raspberry/cherry fruit from the aroma. Tastes like dry toasted coffee initially, then again mixed with a sweet flavor of dark/berry fruit, and perhaps licorice. Finish is not very bitter. Alcohol is not strong. Fairly thick feeling on the palate, carbonation is right for a porter. A sweeter tasting porter then some, I found it very drinkable and could have a few of these."
"This is a very drinkable beer, full-bodied and mildly carbonated, with good taste and aroma. Its not a great porter, but certainly adequate, and reasonably priced in grocery store 6-packs."
"Overall, a decent porter. Not the best beer from Deschutes but a nice session beer."
"Pretty decent, but with so many exceptional porters available, why bother?"
"This is an interesting porter; It's got a bit more bite than most, kind of jerking your taste buds around; It's got a lot of character, but the unfortunate part is that I've been having a very hard time deciding if I like its character or not. Half the flavors are tasty, the other half are astringent and tangy."
"Sweet chocoloate and malt aroma. Dark brown with amber highlights and a bubblly, thumb thick head. Roasty fore which transitions quickly to smooth chocolate and mild creamed coffee notes and finishes with a hint of molasses and maple syrup. Very tasty and full flavor wise."
"Pours a thick, deep ruby brown with a fluffy tan head which fades away to a thin lace. It comes back pretty easily with a swirl, though. The smell is of strong malt and a little yeast with very little in the way of hops, just the way a porter should smell. The taste is really strong roasted coffee/chocolate. A tiny bit of fruitiness and lots of malt flavor. Very true to the style. Some bitterness on the back end, but not too much. Creamy mouthfeel, no carbonation burn, very nice. I'd have it with a nice steak or on special occasions. Would definitely get this one again."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin but is good enough to cause the beer to linger on the tongue long enough to allow the tastes to become noticable. Drinkability is good. This one is easy to put down, but could be a bit stronger in the flavor department. A nice, simple porter."
"Slàinte!"
"Drinkability - As I mentioned before I am not a big fan of Porters so I do not find this terribly drinkable."
"Surprising drinkability for style. Hops add an unexpected dimension to Black Butte, providing a really pleasant fresh fruity bittersweet character that weds happily with the dark roasty maltiness. Very easy to enjoy, and smooth on the palate."
"a very solid porter from the good looking deep ruby body to the subtle yet mouth watering malty nose. its balanced and does everything right, sweet and chocolatey, a slight hop bite that gives you that nice refreshing character and it isnt filling. a good session porter. smooth in the mouth, its pretty good stuff."
"Overall I think this is a good example of the modern american porter and a great drink."
"This was one great beer. The flavor is classic porter."
"This is a well done porter, but sadly is not one I can get easily."
"When poured, it was a very dark brown, almost black, in color, with very little foam, tan foam. The smell of roasted malts fill my nose with a pleasant aroma. The flavor was of roasted malts and a hint of simi-sweet chocolate on the palate. This is a well balance ale, mixing malts and chocolate that was not bitter or over sweet."
"Thanks to waldowin for the sample. Pretty standard looking porter. Deep, dark brown. Aroma is quite evident right off the bat-nice roasted and chocolate notes though low in abundance. Good malt flavor. Roasted malt dominates with a fair hint of chocolate,slight coffeish flavor. Lingering bittersweet cocoa. Ok body-could stand to kick it up just slightly to be a tad fuller. Overall a very nice porter. Wish there was a more consistant one like this available locally. Worth trying for sure."
"Brain: A highly recommended brew, especially if you like Porter. Definitely makes me come back for more and resent any friends who have sipped some while I wasn't looking. This could easily be a session beer for me."
"Drinkability - I think this is slightly above average for drinkability. This is a good beer, but the least interesting of the several excellent offerings the Deschutes Brewery has."
"Pours a deep brown with ruby highlights thru out with a thin off white head that disapears into nothing quite fast,I noticed a few chunks swirling around in there as well.Aroma is nutty and unsweetened chocolate mainly not over the top sweet by any means,has a nice smooth mouthfeel this glides down very easily to say the least.Flavors start out somewhat sweet bitter chocolate and caramel with an underlying roasted coffee presence but finish very earthy and dry like an unroasted raw peanut flavor.A very solid beer this one is a classic in the northwest and I can see why,very solid."
"Intensely smooth and rich taste. Anise and licorice and alcohol aroma. Black as molasses and some of its taste. Excellent with my meal. Toast, well balanced, without being very sweet nor coffee nor overly bitter. Well carbonated. Bit of sourness mid-sip."
"overall: not a bad porter at all. definitely a session porter with a lotta potential. i have to thank waldowin for hookin' me up with this one. a very good try, but may leave you yearning for a little bit more."
"This is my session porter. It's not so heavy as to wipe me out after a bottle, and it's reliably brewed by the folks at Deschutes. If you are looking for a big porter to function as a dessert after a sumptuous meal, this isn't it, but it will make a decent porter to sit in front of the tv with while you watch a game."
"I've heard quite a bit about this beer from Oregonians so figured I'd have to try it out. It begins by pouring a dark brown--almost black--color with a slim tannish head. Smells of roasty malt and chocolate/mocha with a slight hop present. In all it is a nice and deep whiff. The taste has a nice deep flavor. Strong malt, followed by a chocolate aftertaste. It is very deep and bold and followed up by a bit of a bite in the aftertaste. In the mouth, this beer is full, deep and rich. The flavor lingers in a way that makes it memorable beyond each quaff. Although I am not a huge fan of porters, and 1-2 of these will suffice, it is overall a very good representation of the style. Smooth and well balanced."
"OVERALL COMMENTS: Certainly brewed to style, and of the highest quality, if maybe a little lacking in the WOW category. If you showed up at my door with a 6er, I think Id let you in."
"Mildly flavored, this would be a good brew to introduce someone to the porter and stout styles."
"Let this one warm up as the real treasures arise when the temp goes out of the icebox. Opaque black with a purty head this is a nice roasty nose. The porter is not really thick or huge but rather for the alcohol it taste just right. Hints of caramel and coffee mix with the smooth finish. A good session porter."
"Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is much lighter and smoother than expected. Still the cloying aftertatse typical of the style but an agreeable one. Call this porter light if you must but a very nice dark beer that won't scare off your Corona-swilling buddies."
"Overall this is a very good porter. Nothing about it really WOWed me, but it is truly very solid. The appearance suffers slightly because the head didn't stick around as long as most porters. It's quite drinkable, but the burnt flavour would eventually have me craving something lighter to cleanse my palate. Whether you are a fan of porters or not, this is one you should definitely try."
"Oh Porter"
"Tasted on 27th May 2005, best by just in date. Note change of label from one shown in these pages. Poured nice matt dark chocolate colour with a nice tan head. Smell was very good, a terrific sensation of burnt coffee beans and dark chocolate. Savoured this aroma for a while. Head started to settle, but a swirl of the glass brought a decent covering back. Taste was almost as good as the smell, and unusually the smells smelled were then confirmed in the tasting. Nice buttery mouthfeel that lingered. Very nice porter, not sure about being a session beer."
"A good beer, but kind of an annoying one because it is bordering on being great, leaving something to be desired. I've focused more on the weaknesses of the beer but do be aware of the scores I gave it, it is still recommended. One of the better porters I have had. I've just been spoiled by the Obsidian."
"Pours a deep, very dark ruby/brown with a smallish tan head that doesn't last very long. Appealing nose of rich roasted malt, chocolate, brown sugar, and a slight earthy characteristic. Palate is redolent of toasted malt up front, with a touch of bitter hops mid-palate before finishing with a subtly sweet lingering taste of caramel malt. Sturdy body is good for the style, although a little foam develops in the back of the mouth. One of the few dark beers that I'll stick with for a whole session - I could drink this all day. Too bad I only have my one six-pack brought back from Oregon, so I have to ration wisely."
"The mouthfeel was creamy but the taste isn't really anything great. It taste like it was headed in the right direction but it has a bitterness that seems odd...sort of like a bad pot of coffee. It isn't terrible but out of all the beers from deschutes, I definately would leave this one on the shelf."
"Drinkability and Overall: Dissapointing!! I loved their Obsidian Stout, but this one just wasn't for me. It just tasted incredibly bland and boring."
"This is what a great porter should be. Pours night-black, with very little head. Smell is of roasted coffee, chocolate, molasses, and raisins. A little carbonated for my liking, but no alcoholic aftertaste. Oh, so smooth! One of the only porters I've found that can be consumed in multiples..."
"While this brew is plenty chewy, the mouthfeel is a touch watery and thin...seemingly the only drawback to this black gold. Great paired with smoky sausage or BBQ."
"Very easy to drink and at 5.2%( on the bottle) it would make a very nice session brew."
"This is a very good beer, all the way around."
"Pours black, which makes sense, given the geological formation it's named after. Smells of malt, with a dash of chocolate sweetness. Tastes of roasted malt, coffee. Smooth, with just a little robust muscle to make it interesting. One to remember when the need for a good porter hits."
"Picked this up in Oregon last weekend, freshness date on bottle of 02/10/05. Poured dark black with 1/2"" of head. Head disappeared after 5 minutes during this tasting. Left dots of lacing down the side of my tulip glass. Tasted of roasted malt with a slight chocolate presence. Taste of beer was the same from the time i drank it until I was left with an empty palate. Would definately drink this one all night long. Definately a Butte above the rest."
"Medium to light bodied, not as thick as you might expect from a porter. However, to me this yields a more drinkable porter which can be a virtue to some."
"Medium-full bodied, great drinkability."
"Not to thick in the mouthfeel but just enough to be a good finish to a tasting session."
"This one starts out with a great aroma of dark roasted grains (chocolate and coffee) with a bit of a lactic note, but it doesn't bother me. The color is good: not too dark (like the porter I just homebrewed); dark brown and ruby. The complexity of the malt flavors, bits of chocolate, rich caramel make for a very tasty porter. The hops are in the background with this one, they play a supporting role, making this beer nice and balanced. The body is perfect, not too thin, or too full. There is slight tart character that really makes this porter enjoyable. Too many ales are I try these days are too clean tasting. It's nice to get a little yeast flavor once in awhile, and this beer delivers."
"Poured a clear, dark burgundy almost black, brew with a inch and a half thick off white head that subsided to a thin film. The aroma is a beautiful balance of sharp black malts that give a burnt coffee impression. The flavor is clean and american in style but the brew pushes the boundaries with a barely perceptible hop bitterness that is immediatly overtaken by the black malt dryness. A smooth carmel malt sweetness balances the astrigency of the black malt but the dominating flavor is the black malt which is there on the inital taste and lingers on the tongue in the finish. I believe this to be an excellent example of a porter and it is one which helped me to formulate my personal definition of the porter style. The mouthfeel is light and smooth due to very little carbonic bite from the bottle conditioning. An excellent session beer this porter has a very enjoyable flavor that would be easy to drink pint after pint."
"Mouthfeel: This is a very smooth beer, but the body lacks the weight that I look for in a porter. The flavor is very good and might be better enjoyed in a fuller bodied beer. On the other hand, a more slender body won't fill you up as quickly, so this may increase the drinkability for some."
"A deep ruby brown with giant, pillowy head and lots of lace; a very attractive beer. Big sweet malts are the name of the game, with flavors and aromas of caramel, burnt bread, molasses, brown sugar, pumpernickel, gingerbread, and a minty herbal hopness. The finish is decisive and warming. While the beer lacks the roastiness of some porters, it's got a lot of malt flavor in it, and should satisfy those who love amber or old ales. The hops are pretty mild, providing a slight mint quality that offsets the chocolatey malts. While the mouthfeel can at times seem soft and pillowy, like the head, at other times it reveals a certain wateryness. This aids drinkability though. Black Butte remains a beer for all occasions, for good weather or bad. I prefer this store-bought in a bottle as opposed to draft at a bar, but that may be because I can control certain things: temperature, amount of head, etc."
"Taste smoked peat; cast iron skillet lickin good; burnt biscuits over a fire; some old staw. Nice porter brings to mind an image of an old-fashioned road side tavern filled with porters unloading horses, eating bad tavern food, and drinking decent beer. Lots of quaffable qualities to this beer."
"Deep dark brown body, smallish diminishing dark beige head. Hops are quite subdued in this one. Very malty aroma. Notes of vanilla, roasted barley. Coffee-chocolate flavors. Finish is light, roasty and sweet (lips sticking together after a minute or 2) Its certainly well focused on malt, but remains a bit chocolatey sweet ultimately. Fairly mild from beginning to the end which is a nice change of pace at times rather than hop bombs, but its character suffers and just leaves the impression of a straightforward well made porter. Light to medium bodied, medium carbonation. Not quite as great as expected, but of course highly drinkable etc."
"Very dark brown with a noisy khaki head that dissipates quickly. The aroma has strong notes of anise and chocolate with just a touch of smoke. The flavor is nicely roasty and slightly smokey (this would go great with grilled steaks or burgers). The body is a bit thin and soda bubbly, but not enough to be irritating."
"Not a flat bitter porter as I would hae expected. This was a zesty porter with good carbonation on my tongue. Great mellow, malty aroma and tastes like milk chocolate."
"I'm certain to look for this porter again - it was very rewarding and a perfect example of the style. One of the things that really impressed me was that Deschutes didn't try to ""stout it up"" like many porters. You can clearly taste the ""old ale"" origins and I'd even suggest that this is closer in character to a brown ale than it is to a stout. Excellent on its own, this would also be a great choice for a tasting party to show the evolution of the styles."
"Black Butte Porter is a fine effort. It isn't what I'd call a big porter, which I generally prefer, but it's a classic, delicious, well-crafted, drinkable one. I'd love to have access to the entire lineup from this excellent PacNW brewery."
"The beer pours a dark brown/black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice roasted malt scent to it , boasting of crystal malts. It is sweet and creamy smelling. The taste is good. It has a smooth dark brown feel with hints of crystal and chocolate malts. It goes down easy and finishes dry, yet sweet. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine porter. It has good flavor and suprisingly good mouthfeel; a good drinker."
"Great looking finger of biege head on pour. Black liquid with ruby highlights, bairly visable. head lasts quite well. Roasty malt in the nose with a sweetish backdrop. Smells good. Flavor is good and roasty dark but kind of sweet in the end. kind of light in the end, also. Needs more hops? Mouthfeel is full and creamy and drinkalbility is good but suffers from bad balance in the flavor."
"The aroma and taste are malty and hoppy, as well. This one is not as thick as some porters I have tried and this is one reason why I liked it so much. The thick ones are better in cold weather, but this one went well in the summer air. Finished strong, but smooth."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" mocha head, which laced well as the drinking experience transpired. Aroma is full of deep, dark malts, and the brew is a barely translucent brown. Taste is strong in the grain bill, but a nice balance of darks and medium, with caramel apparent along with the coffee and chocolate malts. A nice change from some of the over poweringly dark malted porters, I like it. Mouthfeel is excellent, and so is the drinkability. These OR/WA brews from this trade just keep giving the love..."
"Overall, I thought this was an excellent porter. It kind of reminded me of Great Divide's Hibernation Ale."
"The flavor is great, but the texture is only so-so. It tasted thin to me, with a little bit of carbonation dancing on the tongue. All in all, tasty and quite drinkable."
"Looks like a dark cola with nice carbonation, but a minimal head (I think I poured it too damn gently). Roasted malt aroma with a wonderful touch of chocolate. I must say, the flavoring is delicious - more roasted malt, a bit of tasty coffee, light chocolate, & a hint of smoke. There is also a nice spicy hop flavor in the mix. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but overall a well-crafted, surprisingly easy drinking treat. Many thanks to skyhand for the chance to taste!"
"Thanks go out Skyhand for hooking me up with this great brew."
"I like it. Very malty with roasted grains, coffee, smokiness, molasses, slightly sweet, moderately bitter, very balanced. A solid porter."
"Notes: Very thin and watery and just disappointing because the right flavors are there, but in weak fashion. One tongue down on this one. Cheers!"
"Zum wohl!"
"12oz Bottle 5/28/04 Poured clear the color of Coca-Cola with not much of a head. Interesting aroma, chocolate, vanilla, tobacco and roasted malt. Mouthfeel is medium to thin with average carbonation. Flavor has alot of chocolate in it giving it a YooHoo chocolate sweetness. Nice flavor. Wet finish. Overall very drinkable. Nothing complex, could drink a few of these."
"The taste has a nice smoky flavor that I think would be difficult to tire of. Very subtle. I can almost wrap my tongue around the smoky hops. I was camping and this was all that the small convenience store in the local logging town had in stock that caught my eye. Glad it did because it was great while sitting around the campfire. Unfortunately, because I was camping I could not pour it out of the bottle because I had no glass with me."
"Very creamy and easy to drink. I could see this as a very good session type beer."
"This is a good, and surprisingly affordable, porter; it represents the style well. I would have liked more body and less bitterness. Otherwise, good stuff."
"The Black Butte Porter pours a dark, coffee like black with a root beer float cream head. The smell is that of rich chocolate mocha. The taste is very good. Taste has a rich cocoa bean type flavor. Tastes great in the mouth as chocolate sensations penetrate the tongue. Only big problem is drinking alot of these doesn't seem possible, very dark and thick. I couldn't drink more that 2 of these. Great after a meal."
"This beer pours a dark brown with a beige head. Smell is of chocolate and caramel malt. Taste is malty with a chocolate hints and a gentle bitterness. Mouthfeel is average, could have used a bit more body. Drinkability is very good for the style. I would like to see a bit more aroma hops in this beer but overall it is good."
"The head on this one is medium-sized, tan, dense, bubbly. Foamy. It leaves thick, sticky lacing. The beer itself is a dark, brown/black color. Holding it to the light shows dark red highlights. The nose is quite light, showing some chocolate. The beer starts off sweet and milky, with some tobacco hoppiness. A fruity, tangy middle leads to a tangy, bitter finish. It's hoppy, and a little smoky. It's a very good, fairly light-tasting, hoppy porter. Quite delicious."
"Medium bodied with a rich and creamy mouthfeel. Great drinkability."
"The highlight of a recent business trip to the Bay Area was the long overdue opportunity to try my first Deschutes beer. Fortunately, it was Black Butte Porter on-tap. I ordered it in a big 20 oz glass and was wishing for more when it was gone. It poured wit a big creamy head. It's dark brown with a hint of garnet when held to the light. The smell has hints of roasted malt but chocolate sweetness is more noticeable. Chocolate flavors also dominate, with some nice roasty notes backing them. The mouthfeel is nice, but the drinkability is a real plus. If you're looking for a ""session porter," look no further."
"Dark and earthy with a small tan head and average lacing. Smells sweet and tangy with the slightest sulfur note way deep down. The taste is top notch, with PNW-style hoppy bitterness up front followed by a bittersweet chocolate and slight mollases finish. Chewy and substantial mouthfeel with mild carbonation. Drinkability is just fine here, though I usually pick something lighter for long sessions. Very, very good Porter."
"Pours very dark -- almost opaque, with a small tan head. Sweet malty aroma with a hint of -- I don't know, maybe coffee or caramel? Big, rich flavor that is not at all bitter, but instead very smooth with a strong roasted taste. Full mouthfeel and a pleasant sweet aftertaste. Very easy to drink -- you could have a few of these without overpowering your palate."
"Poured out of the bottle into a pint glass. A fine low light-tan head formed, leaving behind a fine blanketing lacing. The aromas were soft consisting of dry malts, hops, and perhaps some toffee. The taste was big, with prominent hops, coffee-toffee malts, roastiness, and a whole grain undertone. The porter flavors fall off leaving a very pleasant lingering hop flavor in the mouth. These are well developed and delicious flavors. The body was medium and smooth, as one would expect with a non-imperial style dark brew. This was a very drinkable and tasty porter, leaving me wanting another. Well done Deschutes! A Pacific Northwest staple."
"Really good."
"Thanks to Gusler for the re-acquaintance."
"Black Butte Porter is a real tasty offering from Deschutes. Has a great taste, good feel and the 5.5% ABV won't knock you on your can, limiting you to just one. This brew has sparked my interest in other beers by Deschutes, especially their Obsidian Stout."
"A great porter that could use a bit more body. The flavor linguires and makes you desire another sip.."
"Not your prototypical porter color, a beauteous blackberry color as it set in my Papago Monk Club Goblet, the head Bunyanesque in size, creamy in texture, the color a light tan and as the head ever so slowly dissipated, a thick and glutinous sheet of lace formed to meld with the goblet. Lots of malt and a fine hint of toasted grain in the crisp and fresh nose, a treat for this old schnozzle, start sweet, the top middling in its feel. Finish is benignly carbonated, the hops pleasing in their spiciness, dry aftertaste, and a real nice porter that is not overpowering, just plain Good Drinking!"
"I didnt find as much complexity in this beer the second time around. And now, after having reviewed 50 or so Porters on the site this one seemed a bit thin and watery for my tastes. I changed some of the scores accordingly and, overall, this one lost 0.3 on its overall score."
"Another very good beer from Bend. Pours a dark cola amber with a dense tan head. Aromas aren't too big, but I can pick out coffee, bittersweet roasted malts, and dark chocolate powder. Taste starts with semi-sweet chocolate malts, followed abruptly by dry, bitter roastiness. Finish is bitter with traces of alcohol. This is a medium bodied beer with a creamy feel."
"This beer is not as dark as I prefer a porter, kind of amber, but still very nice brownish head. I'd also prefer a richer tasting beer. This beer is a little thin on mouthfeel and on dark malt flavor. Definately get some chocolate or black patent malt, but more chocolate would help me define it as a real porter."
"slight bitter finish"
"This pours with a nice thick brown head. Smells of roasted malt, coffee, and some dark toffee perhaps. Very smooth tasting with a roast, chocolate malty thickness to it. Tastes lightly sweet with maybe a hint of hoppiness in the flavor. A very clear dark brown color when it is held up to the light, otherwise it is a deep brown, almost black color. A slight bit of acidity from both the carbonation and the dark malts is evident. This beer is definitely predominantly a chocolaty smooth one though."
"Too bad Deschutes has a small distribution area in the West. This is a beer to spread the gospel about."
"Dark black color, medium head. Roasted malt aroma, chocolate. A medium to lighter bodied porter. Roasted malts are mild and slightly sweet. Mild hops. Good balance, smooth taste, milder flavor, a touch watery, but still a nice porter. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and sweet. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."

"Overall Impression: Black Butte was the first Deschutes beer I tried (about two years ago when I visited OR from LA). Since I was living in the Southwest, I was not able to try any more. However, now that I'm in the NW, I'm trying the entire compendium. BBP is a great example of a robust porter: nicely balanced, slightly sweet, great color. Deschutes is a great brewery (though, from what I've heard through the grapevine, the quality may start going down hill) with a solid line of beers. Well worth a try... or many tries."
"Overall, a good porter."
"Big thanks to weefisheads for the bottles."
"Very slightly cloudy, jet-black forming a yellow tan head with OK retention and lacing. Aroma is rich with dark molasses, roasted nuts, vanilla, fruity and spicy hops, espresso, and unfortunately, acetone. Mouthfeel is slick with medium-thin body and an amazingly clean finish, making it exceptionally easy to drink. Taste begins with burnt, black patent malts with a healthy dose of chocolate malt, followed by a very nicely balanced bitterness, alot of smooth dark tones, and vanilla. It is hard to describe but it ultimately satisfying. Alcohol is moderately perceptable, but is clean and not conspicious."
"Originally sampled on 21 August 2002. I enjoyed this while visiting Deschutes' brewpub in Bend. This pours black, w/ a great nose of coffee and chocolate. The flavor is crisp & chocolatey; it's kind of smooth. This is a nicely done example of a porter, in my opinion."
"Tasteslike it was old and possibly infected . Black Butte is known as a good porter but you would'nt now it from this sample i hope to try this again and have a better experience!"
"My first sample of this wonderful porter was at the Mountain Brewer's Beer Fest in Idaho Falls on June 7th. Out of the 80 beers available, this was definitely in the top 3 of the day. Living in Arizona does not allow me to sample the more obscure (to me) brewery's offerings. Sampled more the next day and was just as impressed as the previous day. Not an outstanding appearance but to smell the roasted malt was wonderful! Not being a huge fan of porter's, this one has definitely shifted me to explore this universe more in the future. This is definitely the best porter I have had!!"
"Pretty nearly black in color, with a very thin dark tan top. Aroma is sweet almost entirely sweet malt, with maybe just a hint of cherry-like fruitiness. This beer is silky smooth in the mouth, with a subtle roastiness that pervades from start to finish. I again detect just a slight hint of cherry mid-palate, which compliments nicely the chocolatey malt flavors. Hops are very mild, and just a hint of smokiness makes itself known in the finish. Nice body and some nice complexity here, though one should be aware that this porter is on the sweet side for the style."
"Not the best porter but very very nice and drinkable to boot!"
"Wow, this was horrible on tap at our local Applebee's. I have had it in bottle and was much better. What happened? Usually bottle is not as good as tap. This beer tasted bland and I could not tell if there was any hops in it at all. Hmmm, bad batch? Too old? Too new? Didn't taste green just really bland."
"Dramatically better on tap."
"With all that I have heard about this beer I expected it to be the second coming of porters but I was a little let down. This beer is very dark, even when held up to the light. My sample had a thin tannish head and aromas of roasted barley were very faint. The roasted flavors were not the typical coffeish roasted flavors that I am used to in a porter and it dominated over the chocolate flavors. The flavors were prodominately up front and lost its zest as you swallowed. Mouthfeel was a bit thin and the finish was kind of watery but I bet this lends to being a great session beer. I would like to try the bottle version before I pass too much judgement of this beer."
"I highly recommend this beer."
"The bottled version is definitely a lot creamier than the tap version.  All flavors are more subdued as well making it rank a little lower in my book.  Sweetness is a little more noticeable as the chocolate and burnt flavors are not masking it as much. Still a fantastic brew and well worth picking up."
"End review."
"Dense, creamy tan head above a dark ruby brown/mahogany colored body. The head holds fairly well. The aroma shows some fruity notes as well as the anticipated espresso and bitter chocolate. Good mouthfeel... medium bodied, not quite chewy, not quite creamy... honey-like? The flavor is full, expressing slightly sweet dark chocolate with a roasty edge up front, followed by some dark fruit, molasses, and even smoke.  Well balanced - not overdone with hop bitterness. Finishes with a light, almost smokey note from the roasted barley. An excellent example of robust porter - distinctive, complex and drinkable."
"I hate to sound like the malt liqour reviewers but this beer simply kicks ass!!!  Maybe my favorite porter of all time...coal black with a nice tan lace...great aroma of cocoa, toffee and some slight butterscotch...extremely creamy, slick mouthfeel...medium bodied...some spicy hops on the nose and they also play a very minor part of the taste...a sweeter porter taste-wise and right up my alley... a dandy!!"
"I tried this beer on a recommendation of a friend...all I can say is THANK U Joni.  I normally prefer IPA's but this has to rank in my top 5 beers.  Unfortunatley I cannot get this beer here in the south.  But my friends from Oregon have found a clone recipe, lets hope its even close to the real thing if so I am in heavan."
"I'm almost embarrased to post this review since all you advocates think this is pretty top notch, plus my  buddy J.P. says this is the best porter he's had.   I will give it another shot, but as of now the taste does not agree with me. it's hard to explain because I do like porter.   I guess I prefer the more subtle notes of Anchors porter.   Still it's not a toss that's for sure.    I promise to try it again... Soon!   I have tried it again and you advocates are right.  This is a great porter.  I find it very refreshing and drinkable"
"This porter is fantastic.  Black color with a nice heavy body and sweet flavor from the specialty malts make this one of the most well-rounded northwest style porters around.  This is definitely one of my top two in this style."
"Notes: Oh baby! There are good porters and then there are great porters ... this one goes down as a great one, no doubt!"
"Almost black, but some light does get through.  Sweet toffee, molasses and raisons on the nose.  Great aroma.  Nice taste. Burnt malt, expresso, roasty bitterness, chocolate and slight smokiness noted.  Medium body.  Great looking porter.  Great smelling porter.  Great tasting porter.  I would put this in the elite class of porters that I have tried.  (Glad they had one bottle left of this at the Coffee Grounds when I passed through Eau Claire a month ago.)"
"Phenomenal porter!  Medium-heavy bodied, very rich and complex.  Coffee, chocolate, smokey woodey notes.  Less hoppy than Sierra Nevada's rendering.  However, I have to say, this is the superior.  Do yourself a favor and give this baby 15 minutes out of the fridge to warm."
"It makes me proud to be an Oregonian. With it's appropriate ritch maltyness and a more agressive hoping than most porters makes this one one of the best around. If you are missing hte great hop presence then you may not be getting it fresh enough. For a real treat make it out to Bend Oregon and try one at the brewery. For us Oregonians Black Butte is usualy the first dark beer we had ever tried. Around here it is every where. Even is the taverns you can find a tap of it beside the bud and millr"
