"This really fell off. The nose is weak, tastes infected. I guess I waited too long unfortunately as the honey is off putting."

"2012 date.  Poured fairly flat and although a tad thin, this is absolutely World-Class offering in its style / category.  Perfect for a winter day!"

"Bottle from 10/2013. An absolutely beautiful beer. Restrained coffee notes on this bottle but a very pleasant coconut aroma and flavor typical of a bourbon barrel aged beer.  Better than Black Note, on par with BCS. Rich, but slightly drier than BCS."

"Overall: this is my second of Hill Farmstead's barrel aged stouts/porters and I must say it is their most impressive category to me. This beer has a lot of complexity and the balance works out extremely well with a sweet start and a lingering bitter finish. The creamy but thick mouthfeel is tough to beat."

"There was some coffee, not so much bourbon because the whole IP was so balanced and tasty and drinkable. One of the best porters I have had. Thanks Tomtom for the hookup.Thick mouthfeel."

"O: I feel like this could have been a sample of a beer pulled of the tank, and I would have said, ""Wow, that's going to be a really good beer when it's finished."" Unfortunately, this was what made it into this bottle. I'd love to give it another chance, and if so I will update these scores. But the total lack of carbonation killed the mouthfeel, and didn't let the flavors come through as they should have. I guess this may have been a bad bottle? But I'm very disappointed."

"Overall: A 10!! What did Travis Tritt sing about trashy women? This is that beer. A little dirty but in a respectful way. You feel guilty drinking it because it's above you. Like catching a 10 when you should only get a 4 or 5."

"O- A great BA porter, but nothing that made me inch closer to me bowing to HF, which a few BA friends are nudging me to do."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really well balanced porter with a delicious, sweet profile. Really nice, creamy body and a great finish. One of the best porters I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
"Sweet, too much so. Everything else is solid, but I has diabeetus."
"As one would expect, Hill Farmstead can make a great imperial porter. This has some remarkable chocolate notes, with some equally remarkable honey notes. The coffee is pretty nice, but overall it's a bit too sweet. This may improve substantially over time."

"Overall: You all are going to think that I am crazy, but i like regular Everett better that Birth of Tragedy. This even shocked me as I came to this conclusion... Great complexity and balance are found in this brew. i wish that a more roasty coffee was used in this beer, I think that would have made this beer even better. Its another great Hills Farmstead beer."

"One of the best barrel aged beers I've had. Just a shocking amalgamation of flavors that dance wonderfully together."

"Overall, this beer is extraordinary. It's balanced with sweetness and roastedness. It's complex. It's utterly delicious and skillfully crafted."

"The beer is near black with an inch of dense, beige foam atop the beer. Looks thick and a bit viscous. Fabulous aroma. Honey emerges more than coffee. Grandiose and lovely honey presence in both the scent and flavor. Beautiful blend of flavors here. Roast and honey marry up to form a slightly sweet, chocolaty beer with just enough bittering hops to balance it all out. Silky smooth on the palate. Long lasting aftertaste. Bourbon character is subtle. This beer is all about balance. If any one ingredient stands out, it is certainly the honey. Yet another fabulous brew from Hill Farmstead."
""
""
""
""

"O: Great base beer that turns fantastic after the barrel treatment. Would definitely seek out again."
""
"O-solid brew, complex flavor, balanced; though a bit sweet for my preference."
""
""
""
"Delicious BA imperial porter. I definitely like this one over Twilight of the Idols, especially for a cold, windy and snowy night like this one. Both are phenomenal beers, but this is another case where the bourbon barrels transform an excellent base beer into an even better, more complex and more enjoyable beer. The smell is still remniscent of Twilight though. Highly recommended!"
"O- Overall this is just a delightful barrel aged porter! I enjoyed every minute of drinking it!"
""
""
""
""
""
"For my first HF offering, I'm definitely a bit impressed on how good and well balanced this was. It probably was my favorite one at the tasting, mainly in part with it being able to impart so many of the malty roasted qualities, dark fruit notes, and oak flavors that I enjoy in the style, all while being more lighter bodied and refreshing to drink. World class stuff if I ever drank some - I will make sure that I do what I can to find more beers from Shaun Hill and his gang in the future."

"This is really well crafted, but lacks a little punch and complexity for a large-ish BA stout/porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – I really enjoyed this. Another example from Hill Farmstead of a well integrated beer that is complex yet immensely enjoyable and easy to drink. The only thing holding this back is how lightly it is carbonated. I’d like to try a new release sometime to experience it properly carbonated."
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic aroma and flavors, but lacking in the body/mouthfeel department, unfortunately."

"Overal, this brew floored me. Its pretty amazing. The mouthfeel is legit. Amazing creamy, silky and velvety smooth. Pretty sticky too. Nice roasted malt notes fill the palette but play second fiddle to awesome honey and bourbon sweetness with some cocoa to boast."
""
""
""
""
"Batch 2 (flat batch). pour us jet black with no head even with a vigorous pour. The nose is very nice, rich chocolate cake with a strong bourbon note and lightly scorched barrel. Taste has all the chocolate cake, dry chocolate through the finish, faint bourbon much less than the nose, virtually no carb with a burnt finish and a medium silky body."
""
""
""
""
""
"For me, this is actually up there with some of the best porters I've had and is almost like vanilla bean dark lord 'light', excellent beer."

"O: A very good beer, the flavor profile was fantastic - the blend of dark fruit and chocolate was great. The flavors imparted by the barrels blended in very nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer has lots of complex flavors in the taste and the nose, but it falls short because of how flat it is. Also, it has such a lack of barrel character. I was expecting more of a bourbon/vanilla taste and it just isn't there. Honestly I like Everett so much better than this. I've read that batch 1 blows away batch 2, so I'm not going to try to hunt down another bottle or vintage. The complexity is there, but it is a bit of a letdown in my book. I'm glad I got to try this, but I'd recommend going after other beers if this is a whale for you."
""
"This is one of the best tasting beers I have had the pleasure to drink. As previous posts have mentioned, my only issue with it is that it lacks any form of carbonation. Just felt like it was missing something. Otherwise, a fantastic beer. I would do it again...and again..."
""
""
"O: Apparently the carbonation isn't allowed to leave VT. This beer truly has the potential for greatness, but it should be properly carbonated. And it's not. There is nothing there leaving a sweet, chocolatey liquid to swirl around the mouth."

"Twilight of the Idols was much better. Everett rocks. This batch of beer was a failure."

"Dark brown, flat appearing beer. Smells decadent: vanilla, oak, nougat, more vanilla, bits of graham, some cocoa, a hint of dark fruits. A really nice nose. Flavor follows suite - really fine dark chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, oak, bits of minced licorice, some leather. The flavor is really nice also. Mouthfeel: this is where the beer falls apart. While full bodied with a silky feel, not even a swish through the teeth makes this bubbly, slightly wet. A real treat - with carbonation this would be hard to beat, honestly."
""
"a really interesting beer, courtesy of one of denvers great beer men, lucky me. It pours a really dense black, midnight or darker, with essentially no carbonation, a motor oil viscosity, and just a thin film of mocha bubbles around the rim of my glass. the nose on this is heavy bourbon, oaky and charcoaly, with spice notes of cinnamon and clove, a very intense roast, and a summery sweetness amidst all the black thick stuff. the flavor, just like the nose, is bourbon first. I also get really strong cinnamon from this, although I don't think that its an ingredient. I do pick up the honey through the bitter dark malt, and its sweetness is welcomed to lighten things up a little. this is a teeth coating brew, sticky and about as thick as any ive encountered in terms of body. I really wish it had a little more carbonation. not a ton, but enough to get it moving a little bit, but I understand that a barrel can reduce that quite a bit. more would aid its drinkability, but I don't think its trying to be a session beer of course. I love the aftertaste on this, with the bourbon, vanilla, and warming alcohol. this is a beer of impressive quality and depth, not one to be consumed frequently, but one to treasure and share. hill farmstead never ceases to impress me, and although this is amazing, its a level below some of their hoppy and farmy stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a beer that definitely should be consumed at 50 degrees or higher. At lower temps, the coffee aspect was a bit off putting and seemed like it tried to rush the delicious brownie taste out of your mouth. This beer drinks like BBPt5's little brother."
""
""
"The taste of this is fantastic. The bourbon is spot on, great sweetness from the honey but the lack of carbonation kills this. So thin. Tastes like a stout more than a porter but with a little restraint on the malt. Great overall but just needs some carbonation and body."
"Thanks to jh1982 for bringing this one to March Madness 2013. No thanks to David Hurley at the El Dorado Casino (a normally really cool place supportive of craft beer). Don't tell us we can have a bottle share, and then renege on your word two days later. Sorry our money is not welcome at your casino I guess."
""
""
"Good beer, nothing that blew me away though- felt a little disjointed. I actually wound up enjoying the base beer (Twilight of the Idols) more, the spices here were a little too smothered by bourbon and sweetness."
""
"Perfect mouthfeel. Perfect is good right?"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, nice beer. Hard to drink, but that's okay, right?"
""
"O~ definitely a treat! i usually like this style to be a bit thicker. come to think of it bourbon aged Fear And Trembling would be absolutely ridiculous! i would totally drink it again, its one hell of a dessert beer!"

"500ml courtesy of Ineedabeerhere (thanks Joe). Served in a tulip. Pours one shade shy of black and completely opaque. No head on this one, just a mocha-colored cluster of bubbles around the shoulders. What an incredible nose on this beer - Dark, roasted malts as well as red wine notes, followed by bourbon and traces of ethanol at the back. Taste follows nose with the barrel qualities being less intense, thus allowing some honey and perhaps coconut to come out. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body (perhaps a little thin) and virtually still; there's also a little bit of acidity. Overall, a complex and interesting beer. I'd even venture to say the best BA version of an American Porter out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - So it isn't as magical as I had hoped, but it's still damn good. Remarkably good, but the bar that Hill Farmstead has set for itself makes me feel the slightest disappointment when the beer isn't perfection."

"In short: imagine if Deschutes brewed The Abyss with an Eclipse-like base - rich, delicate and nuanced, but sweet. Highly recommended."

"8.7/10"
"O- very good beer. Nose implies a very bourbon forward beer, but the flavors meld very well together."
""
""
"O- I never get tired of this beer. I could drink it all day"
""
""
""
"O: Amazing beer. My one problem with it is that it is not a porter. It's a stout."
""
""
""
"O-An amazing beer. Some carbonation, might make it one of the best."
"I will say, of all the stouts/porters/whatever you want to call it, only KBS can stand up next to bot, and I will say kbs is slightly better in my opinion. Everyone other stout bot wins no question !"
"Wonderfully drinkable. Excellent."
"Wow, what a roller coaster. I guess they got it right in the two most important categories, but the mouthfeel is a bummer. This is a really, really good beer that could be great with just a little carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Absolutely delicious. I like Twilight of the Idols, but I like this even more. If they would beef up the gravity a bit I bet this would be able to hold onto the barrel a little better and get a better mouthfeel. Still, I'm just nitpicking here. A great beer."
""
""
"This brewery simply has the most elegant and well proportioned beers, I have not had better stouts and porters anywhere. This one even in a bottle delivers essential expectations on what an American Porter needs to be. I love the way the deep undertones of malt and sugar linger, plus gorgeous smaller bubbles."
""
""
""
""
"This beer would rate much higher if it just had a touch more carbonation. The flavor and aroma are there, but a bit of effervescence would really enliven this one."
""
""
""
"All this is why it's such a shame that the carbonation isn't there. It's a well-known fact about this beer and despite my respect for what HF does it's not really something I can look past. 500 ml of flat beer, no matter how good it tastes, gets tedious over time."

"2012 bottle. Black, very black...and flat....very flat. Essentially very little to no carbonation. No lacing, some kind of ring around the glass. Disappointing. Vanilla, oak, bourbon, booze, chocolate....honey. Real nice, very aromatic even for a flat beer. Honey up front, vanilla and bourbon barrelesque flavors, a fair bit of chocolate. Very woody beer. Oily, fatty, rich and thick...but flat. A little cloying, just a little. As tasty as this beer is, and man it does taste good, it is sullied by the lack of prickly bubbles of CO2 escaping from this liquid elixer. I get it though, it is hard to bottle condition a barrel aged beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"I loved, loved, loved the first batch of this beer, but this one is not nearly as good, imo. Last year's bottles had a nice level of carbonation for the style. Having read other reviews of low carbonation, I can't help but wonder if this was a widespread issue."
"M: Full bodied. Carbonation would really help. It's basically flat. Docking a couple points because of it."
""
"O- A very nice and challenging beer. It has a lot of great things going for it and I cant wait to try again in the future."
"Pours an opaque, still and ominous motor oil black with a trace mocha head that quickly dissipates. Aroma has a strong bourbon presence, blending with chocolate, molasses, vanilla, roast coffee, raisin, plum and cocoa (basically everything wonderful). Syrupy, oily thick body with gentle carbonation, little alcohol presence or cloying sweetness. Flavor of a robust porter, roast and chocolate malt, layered with molasses, burnt sugar, vanilla, bourbon. I've had good to great experiences with this (in bottle and draft) and this was one of the great ones."
""

"Birth of Tragedy pours completely black, with caramel colored foam topping it that struggles to reach a finger in height. Head retention is decent, and lacing is somewhat spotty. The nose is very chocolaty, with vanilla is a strong secondary aroma. Honey and bourbon are both barely appreciable. The flavor profile is a bit more nuanced. It opens with a rich chocolate maltiness. Slightly woody bourbon notes come next, before a brief slightly fruity honey presence (which I'm shocked manages to come through) bridges to a subtle coffee finish. Meanwhile, a vanilla sweetness lingers throughout. The body, noticeably lightened by the honey, isn't too full. That's especially good given that the beer is essentially flat. The mouthfeel is still a little bit syrupy though.I absolutely love the barrel character Hill Farmstead got into Birth of Tragedy, if they tightened up the carbonation it would probably be pushing towards my top 10 beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"After drinking Twilight of Idols, this came as quite a pleasant surprise. For one, the carbonation was spot on. Others said that there was *no* carbonation, but that works extremely well for this fudgy, creamy, chocolaty beer. Roast but with notes of honey?! Very nice. Coffee in the finish completed it for me. Very glad to have had it and will drink it again anytime."
"O - An extremely decadent and tasty desert beer that's a bit too flat. I really liked this one, but its not as great as Everett or even Twilight."
""
"treatment and despite the lack of carbonation this is one enjoyable drinking experience. The flavors are all in perfect balance and perfectly complement each other."
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: A really delicious barrel aged porter from Hill Farmstead. It is certainly on the lower end of the carbonation spectrum, but it is by no means flat or still. A little bit more carbonation would definitely help prop up the flavors and help with the body, but it’s still quite creamy and the balance of flavors is tremendous."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: If this beer had very slightly more carbonation, it would be in a league of it's own as far as I'm concerned. As it stands the aromas and flavors are such that it is still one of my very favorites regardless of the carbonation issues."
""
"Overall: A really great beer that I just wish had some carb. It's too flat for me."
"O: I think the 2012 vintage is a bit less carbonated than the 2011 vintage, but I really feel like the flavor profile is fuller and more complex than last year's, which I didn't think was possible. Easily the best porter I've ever had. I truly love this beer. Shaun is known for his IPA's and Saisons, but his barrel aged dark beers are exceptional."
""
"Overall this is a treat. Glad I have a few bottles in the cellar to see what some additional time and blending will do. Very rich and complex - extremely sweet. The bottle was consumed while playing some trivia games while it snowed outside - perfect atmosphere for this one IMO."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a solid black color with about forty bubbles eventually making their way to the surface. Yup this one is flat. Smells of chocolate brownie batter, coconut, light bourbon, coffee, a bit of oak tannin and some sugary sweetness to tie this all together. The flavor is sweet and chocolatey with a bit of coconut, caramel, roast, warming alcohol, tannin, and earthy hop to provide some balance. This tastes like an alcoholic mounds bar really. Medium to thick body with a non existent level of carbonation and a sweet syrupy sugary mouthfeel. This honestly smells wonderful, tastes good, but the lack of bubbles messes with the mouthfeel a bit leaving a syrupy feel to it. I'd love to try this with bubbles."
"O- This was a very good barrel-aged porter but nothing overly mind-blowing. There was plenty of sweet bourbon and a nice sweet molasses taste that balanced well, but I was expecting a little bit more coffee and chocolate to come out. Overall this is very good, but I think there are a few barrel-aged porters out there that are slightly better. Definitely don't drink this cold, it dulls the flavors and makes it taste a little bit watery. I would love to see what a little bit of age in the bottle does to this beer."
"O: I don't like bourbon so my opinion is skewed but there isn't much porter to this beer not well balanced first hfs beer I didn't love and for that matter I have been less impressed withe their darker beers (accepting Everett) especially in comparison to their hoppy beers and saisons but ill blame it on the style this time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Having now dabbled more extensively in the HF portfolio, I'm left with mixed feelings. So far I have enjoyed their hoppy offerings more than their stouts and porters. I would think long and hard before trading away what this beer might command. Please don't sit on this beer any longer if you've got it."
"Pretty sure this one is past its prime at this point. However, that doesn't mean its not good. Flavor is decidedly a bit one-dimensional but its still everything you could want from a barrel-aged porter. Warming and delicious. I'd love to revisit this fresh if its ever made again."
""
"Reviewed blind as part of Blind BIF 7. This stuff pours a straight obsidian topped by a half-finger at best of sienna foam. The nose comprises rich cocoa, dark fruits, and molasses. I didn't really get any barrel character at this point, interestingly.. The taste brings in more of the same, with a seeming fudge component coming in up front. Again, no real barrel character comes through to me, but it doesn't detract from the rest of the experience. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly chewy feel. Overall, a very nice, rich porter. I was a little disappointed to not really get any barrel out of this thing, but it's still pretty damn good. (I initially thought this was a smooth stout, and I will continue to say that it does come close to that kind of experience.)"

"One of the best porters, if not the best, id ever had. Get this brew ASAP!"
""
""
"O- Birth of Tragedy was an absolute highlight for us. This is without a doubt the best porter I have ever had. The melody of flavors coming from the 2011 keg made for an amazing experience"
"On tap at the Harvest festival. Pitch black with small mocha bubbles as foam. Rich chocolate, coffee aroma with some strong bourbon vanilla notes. Some spices too. Very sweet but the roastiness from the coffee makes it more dry and drinkable. Low carbonation. This is a decadent beer, a sipper for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest to lighter level of carbonation. It is a boozy sipper that is unique. Big alcohol impact and minor barrel influence. I am glad to have tried this but wouldnt go through the trouble to have it again."
"O: This really is a fantastic porter; I'm not really surprised, given the brewery's other hits. I would caution against aging this one; despite the small heat, one thing that impressed me about the beer was how balanced all the flavors are. Aging it might temper the booze, but at the expense of that balance, causing the symphony of flavors to lose its rhythm."
"Cost: $15 for a 500 ml bottle."
""
""
"I really liked the richness and balance of flavors here but unlike some other recent Hill Farmstead offerings that I’ve had, this doesn’t quite mask its alcohol quite as well as you as I would have liked. It doesn’t doesn’t bring any stinging heat to the profiles or anything like that but does slow the drinkability up a bit. This is still a really nice beer though. Thanks again for sharing it Adam!"
""
"500mL thanks to oteyj. Pours near ink, very black SRM generating a surprisingly fizzy, reddish tan head settling to a thin cappuccino froth. Sticky, webby tan lace. Nose is interesting. Sharp vanilla bean and ancho/guajillo chili pepper dark chocolate sprinkled with turbinado sugar. Wow. Soft bourbon spice. Subtle yet fantastic nose- must allow it to decant a little bit. Morphs to melted dark chocolate bar. Taste....wow. Very silky, soft, almost like drinking super dark chocolate milkshake. Wild palate. Hilariously soft- almost impossibly soft. Muted bourbon spice, buttery dark chocolate ganache, true French truffles melting. In the finish is mild barrel character. Palate is 6/5. I can see all those people at Dark Lord Day pooping in Port-A-Potties and reeking of BO waiting for 8 hours to try a beer that they think will taste like Hill Farmstead Birth of Tragedy, but sadly is Dark Lord. A 3.8 level imperial stout at best that trembles in the presence of this behemoth, which is devastating not only in aesthetics and taste but also in subtlety and softness. What a magical experience. I will say one thing: DO NOT AGE!! You will be wildly disappointed. This baby is good to go. 12/10/2011 9/4/8/5/18=4.4"

"What could have been. These are some of the most outstanding flavors I've ever had in a porter, but the mouthfeel just makes this a good not great beer for me. That said, it's still pretty impressive that I completely hate one aspect of this and it's still a solid beer. If you like extremely low carbonation levels then you'll love this one as the flavors are great, but if you don't you'll end up just a bit disappointed."

"Overall: Easily a standout in its style, but moreover a standout for me against anything I've drank. We tried this against Black Note, King Henry, and BA Blackout and this one was a consensus winner. I will seek out another bottle of this so more people in my circle can wonder at this marvel."

"O - The 11% has really smooth out, but there's still a bunch of sweetness from the barrel. I really like how the barrels have worked with Twilight, but I think the coffee and spices are long-gone as this point. Maybe some of the light roast I picked up is coffee, but I can't be too sure. A really great brew and something I liked more then Damon...good stuff."
"Pours black without much of a head. As the description states, honey, coffee, and vanilla. Starts off chocolate that fades to some bourbon and heat. All of these flavors meld together really well and make a nice porter. Ends dry. Really good bourbon barrel aged porter. I am looking forward to trying more from this brewery."
"Reviewed from notes, shared with alalvarez75 before Birth of Tragedy hit the hype machine!"

" It was fairly nice, but I really noticed the acrid nature of it, which detracted from the experience."

"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style and slick. Carbonation is very low, but I like low carbonation in these type of beers. Overall it had some very good and unique flavors to it. The bold, bitter coffee really worked well with sweeter honey and vanilla flavors. Really good beer overall."
"Now if they'd only drop the hipster beer names...."

"Beer is medium to thin in body, not hot at all AT ALL on the palate, the nose is deceiving. This is a relatively easy drinking beer. The back palate falls away quickly and finishes a little thin but not dry. The forward is all sweetness and fudge, chocolate, oak and liquor. Not detectable alcohol on the beer. I love it. I'd have it again. Increase the carbonation in future bottles of this beer to increase the quality, otherwise don't change a thing."
"Palate: Lots of bittersweet chocolate up front. The barrel has integrated pretty nicely with the base beer, lending caramel, vanilla and oak flavors that don't overwhelm the malt. Coffee is present but somewhat subdued. Alcohol is at a noticeable but mellow and pleasant level. Sweet and rich with a big chewy body. Fantastic stuff."
"A very smooth and tasty blend. It’s thick, but I could drink it all night. Hill Farmstead knows what it’s doing."

"Overall: A really excellent beer from one of the biggest ""up and coming"" breweries out there. A definite treat, as it is on the sweeter side. Dry this out a smidge - either by adding less honey or letting it attenuate a little longer - and you'd have a true world-class brew here. As it stands, it's merely excellent, a whole greater than the sum of its parts, and surprisingly easy to put away at 11.0%."

"O: This beer would kill if it had a few bubbles. Flavors were rich and well integrated. A roasted bal-aged porter all around. The flatness saddens me, and I knocked the score because of it. Thanks again, SneezyAchew."
"O- Yep. Easily my favorite porter of all time, although it walks a fine line between a porter and a stout. One of the best of last year. Period."
""

"Overall - Good beer. I would drink this more often if it was readily available to me, alas it is not. Didn't realize till just now that this is classified as a porter. That seems to make it more interesting for some reason."
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy tan head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. No lacing on this one. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, vanilla, wood, and bourbon. Taste is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, vanilla, bourbon, and a woody flavor on the aftertaste. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a medium body. Overall, this is a very good barrel aged porter that is quite tasty and drinkable."

"Overall: I would have liked this beer to be a tad thicker. I enjoyed the flavors that the wood added. I would have another."
"o - Overall a really nice porter. I think I pretty much liked this just as much as Everett, but for different reasons, as this one focuses more on bourbon. Would like to get a bottle of this."

"OVERALL: This was a really tasty treat. The nose on this thing is out of this world, with plenty of bold aromas and a fantastic balance between the base beer and adjuncts on the one hand, and the barrel on the other. The taste is also fantastic, but the barrel pushes the balance just a touch off center. In the end, this is a phenomenal brew and is another chapter in the brilliant imperial porters that Hill Farmstead seems to be brewing up. I would more than love to have this again at some point. Thanks again jbeatty. Whole-heartedly recommended."

"This poured out as a really nice looking black color with a brown head on top. The smell of the beer was sweet with lots of wooden aromas to it. The taste of the beer had some interesting transitions to it, the beer was sweet up front with some nice bourbon vanilla flavors that got a little funky in the aftertaste. The honey didn't really come through too well but the coffee notes were a good bittering agent here. The mouthfeel was of a typical porter but it was on the fence with a stout. Overall I liked it quite a bit. I would enjoy this one again."

"O - I love this beer. It presses the barrier between a Porter and a RIS. The barrel seems to be there just complementing and guiding along the base flavors. Very well crafted. I can't imagine a Porter getting any better."

"Pours a very dark brown/nearly black with very little head and almost no lacing. Smell is very coffee and chocolate with very little bourbon or oak, but still pretty nice. Taste is excellent, a great mix of bourbon, oak, coffee and chocolate, the coffee stands out the most but doesn't take over the flavor, very smooth and incredibly easy to drink for such a big. Mouthfeel is a little thin for the style and it's a bit low on the carbonation, but it doesn't really bring down the experience of drinking the beer. Overall, this is an outstanding tasting beer, the only detractors are the mouthfeel and appearance, but pretty great overall."

"Pours pretty much black in color with a very small khaki head. Intense roasted malt and bourbon aromas. Lots of vanilla notes to it. There's a bit of the honey coming through as well as the coffee. I don't get much spice, though. A nice bit of chocolate in the back ground. The flavor is a touch boozy at first, but otherwise quite nice. Excellent vanilla and bourbon notes with some roast, coffee, and dark chocolate. Really smooth and well done. Medium to full bodied with a low, smooth mouthfeel."
""
"Overall: beer of the night and the best beer I've had in a while, everything is just hung together in perfect harmony. So glad I have another bottle, but now I know it's going to have to be a very special occasion to bring this out again."

"O: An interesting effort, but a bit too ambitious."

"This beer pours a nice brownish black color with minimal head. the smell is heavy upfront with bourbon followed by a hint of coffee. the flavor follows through(though it is a little muted in comparisson to the tap version) with one of the smoothest least burning bourbon flavors I have ever had in a beer, It is truly amazing how well the bourbon melds into this beer, the coffee is a nice little side note in the flavor, the bourbon is followed by sweet rich and chocolatey notes. the mouthfeel is full, but not syrupy full. carbonations is low to low medium, which compliments the beer nicely. overall i would say this beer is better on tap but still excellent out of the bottle"
"Good stuff but the lack of carbonation always takes away from these strong barrel aged beers for me. Love the oak and whiskey use but the spices combine in a strange way to me."
"D - I liked this beer quite a bit, but I think I prefer the base beer more, as I like the interesting mix of adjuncts and malt flavors and some of that is masked by the barrel-aging. Still, this is a high-quality and well-crafted beer that is well worth seeking out - but did anyone expect anything less from Hill Farmstead?"

"Great beer. It’s just that simple."

"Overall just great, great malts (which I already knew as Twilight was great), great dark flavors, bourbon, oak, vanilla, and barrel additions just add even more awesomeness to it.So great."

"Birth Of Tragedy is a very sweet, rich and intensely flavored beer. Aside from the disappointing mouthfeel, this was definitely the most impressive porter I have ever tried."
""
"Taste is chocolate and roasty, sweet lots of oaky vanilla with a bit of a hot finish. Overall its really creamy and delicious. I don't quite taste it as an imperial twilight but its still very good."

"Overall: I've never had Twilight of the Idols, but Birth of Tragedy is a fine beer."
"O - A wierd smell, but the taste is just so nice. My wife was fighting me over this one. Thanks so much Shawn for this one."
"Pours black with a good tan-mocha head and nice retention. Lacing on the glass. The nose brings forward very smooth bourbon with a bit of roast and chocolate. Some coffee there as well. Flavor integrates bourbon and chocolate quite well. Nicely done, but nothing to really bring it over the top. Mouthfeel is ultra smooth without any trace of alcohol. Fantastic barrel usage, but lacking the final oomph to really make it world class. Still, a great beer."
"Thanks Robert! Pours black with a medium, sticky mocha foam head. Nose is roasted malt, lightly charred, with a strange sweet liquor that's pretty interesting, blackberry like. Light coffee and bourbon, vanilla. Pretty tight and integrated with that weird spirit edge. Mouth is pretty thin, opens with dry cocoa powder, light char, unfolding into vanilla, this very unique fruity liquor quality, and a long finish with alcohol and vanilla. Soft up front with a sharp dark fruit quality as it lingers. Very unique brew here, the barrel treatment is awesome."
"Cheers!"

"O - What an amazing beer. I could drink barrels of this stuff. So deep in flavor and well balanced. Will definitely be drinking again. If I can ever get a hold of more."

"O-Every aspect of this beer is harmonious. Wouldn't change a thing about it. I don't even know that aging would do anything for it, as it is drinking perfectly now. Another winner from Hill Farmstead."

"Plenty of barrel in this with good coffee, vanilla, and baker's chocolate. Reminds me of KBS with no oatmeal. Would recommend."
"It is a good beer when judged on its own merits, but it is not one I would ever want again."

"D: This is incredibly drinkable, I am trying to tame myself from powering through the entire 500ml bottle with little success. It is thin, hot, and sweet, oh wait here's a patently obvious female entendre. Nope, keeping it classy here. It is totally drinkable and I wish it came in sick sixers or at least tall boys to take up to the lake. PSYCHE. This beer is meant for hearths and post skiing discussions, luge comparisons and other highbrow Vermontean prose."
""
"Overall this beer is complex, well balanced and extremely flavorful. It's refreshing to find a beer like this that isn't a complete bourbon bomb. Recommended!"
"Overall this one is pretty rock solid. Would really love better carbonation here. Maybe just a sub par bottle, but let's face it. Even a sub par bottle is pretty damn good."
"Another top notch beer by Hill Farmstead. I'm hoping my other bottle at least pours a bit prettier."
"O - Overall this is one of the best beers I've ever had, easily the best porter by a landslide. This sure is a rare one and wish I could have bought more than 4 bottles. For those who didnt go and only have reviews/numbers to go off of, this really is THAT good. Be prepared to spend big if you missed this one!"
""
"O I cant take it, this is so good. Taste is perfectly balanced and so easy to drink. I wish I grabbed more of this. Thank you Shaun."
"Overall, a really outstanding barrel aged porter and just a terrific overall beer. Really complex and balanced. The coffee is outstanding and this definitely is drinking great fresh. Pop this open if you have it and enjoy."
