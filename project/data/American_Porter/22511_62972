In the nose, roasty malts and coffee, vanilla beans, some caramel and milk chocolate sweetness. Taste was nicely balanced. On the sweeter end: milk chocolate, vanilla, marshmallow; on the roastier end: dark malts, cocoa, coffee, toasted grains. I didn't really get any cinnamon, either because I wasn't searching for it, or because it had faded (not sure of the date on this keg). Smooth mouthfeel, medium-full body, moderate to low carbonation. Easily drinkable and extremely tasty.","Rifugium","Mar 30, 2014"
4.23,-2.8,4.5,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,"O: Overall an excellent beer; the nose and taste are very enticing and complex (though maybe a touch off). The subtle treatments and additions to this beer at the various stages of brewing (coffee, cinnamon, vanilla beans) all work very well together making a beer greater than the sum of its parts.","mtomlins","Mar 29, 2014"

Not my favorite offering from Hill Farmstead but honestly I don't have a single complaint about this. Very nice job.","ThreeLions","Feb 18, 2014"
4.71,8.3,5,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,"Tested from a 500ml bottle. Color is a rich dark black with a creamy brownish white head. Smell is of smoked coffee with heavy hints of toffee and lighter notes of dark chocolate malt. Mouthfeel is slightly syrupy with a nice hop finish. Tastes of vanilla, dark roast coffee, and a rich European milk/dark chocolate finish. Heavy cream and smoke are noticed at the back of the Tongue. Overall one of my favorites of this style. Really good thing I don't live closer to Hill Farmstead as I would be broke.","Hab11","Beers"

Taste is similar in comparison to the nose. Same aspects, coffee is light with the roast slightly stronger. Very rich chocolate and vanilla, light peppery tang to it. Balanced sweetness subtly behind showing a deep malt presence. Body is lighter, carb is assertive with a juicy texture and semi dry finish.","jbaker67","Feb 13, 2014"

My guess is that it isn't as well carbonated as it was on draft. I'm going to conclude here that I certainly prefer this beer on draft, so if you've had it out of the bottle and thought it was good but not great, I encourage you to try it out on draft on your next visit to Vermont.","Stevedore","Jan 02, 2014"

Complex nose with hints of roasty coffee, cinnamon, vanilla, caramel, and a bit of mocha. The taste follows suit with lots of dark roasty coffee up front along with hints of cinnamon, vanilla, sweet cream, milk chocolate, and some subtle black pepper. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, extremely creamy, and smooth as silk. Overall, this is a really nice Porter with a unique holiday twist.

Perhaps a little more bitterness at the finish would make this perfect, but it is a really tasty and enjoyable treat as it is. Another great porter/stout from Hill Farmstead.

A friend from Vermont gifted me about 6 different offering from Hill Farmstead and this is the first one I tried. The aroma matched the flavor.

One of the best things about it is that all the ingredients–the vanilla beans, coffee, and cinnamon–seem to mix well together; it's not one of those beers that seems to use additives as a crutch. It also doesn't have that fake spiciness thing going on that some winter beers have (you know who you are). This is a subtle, complex, and very tasty dark ale that really brings the roast.

As for the vanilla, not picking that up so much, but none the less the aroma is inviting and complex. Roasty, now I get the vanilla it comes on subtley but is perfect in its restraint. Cinnamon, I really never expected to be enjoying cinnamon as an ingrediant in a beer but it is so complementary to the flavors in this porter. The finish is lingering with the cinnamon, coffee and latte like charecter really hanging around, a little to long actually. Thick and rich somewhat milk shake like, its a good thing.

Head retention is just average, and there's a little bit of lacing left stuck around the glass. The nose is nice, dominated by milk chocolate with a strong spicy cinnamon presence. The flavor profile takes things to the next level though, starting with a creamy chocolate open. Cinnamon comes in for a short time in the mid palate, before coffee and more chocolate close things off. The finish is like the liquid equivalent of snacking on chocolate covered coffee beans. The mouthfeel is also top notch, very full and creamy for a 7.5% beer, with a subtle and understated carbonation. I'd be shocked if there weren't a healthy dose of oats in the grain bill, because the body is just that silky smooth. Twilight of the Idols was the first non hoppy beer I've had from Hill Farmtead, and it left me just as impressed with them as I was by their outstanding IPAs.","axeman9182","Mar 28, 2012"

4.3,-1.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall: Another standout beer from Hill Farmstead. I think I like Everett better, but this is a very nice porter itself. Don't let the vanilla/spiced/winter angle scare you away - I'm not a huge ""winter warmer"" or sweet/vanilla fan but these additions are minimal and only add nice complexity in this beer.","cbeer88","Dec 03, 2011"

4.27,-1.8,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Pours a rich chocolate black with a quickly dissipating mocha head. Dots of lacing and wet legs line the glass. Aroma starts with mild smoke, bread and burnt malt, and turns mildly sweet with molasses, milk chocolate, vanilla bean and light cream. Flavor has a bready and coffee base, more roasted malt and a baker's chocolate finish that isn't particularly sweet. Vanilla and molasses subtly blend in and out of the body without ever being cloying. Biggest knock on this is the slightly thin body and watery finish. Nowhere as robust as Everett and too thin for the style and ABV for my taste. Regardless, an excellent, unique porter but I'll just stick to Everett.","yourefragile","Dec 01, 2011"
4,-8,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer pours a really dark brown color. There is a small finger of light tan head on top of it. The head sticks around for a bit, and it leaves behind a few specs of lace behind as it recedes. The nose is roasty and there are aromas of coffee, chocolate, and a bit of dark fruit. There is also a bit of vanilla and molasses that comes out. The taste starts off with a strong roasted malt presence. There are some good flavors of milk chocolate and coffee that stand out. Also, there are flavors of vanilla, dark fruit, molasses, and a bit of cinnamon. The finish leaves some lingering roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate behind on the palate. This has a medium body and good carbonation. It goes down easy and has a rich velvety feel to it. There a good amount of roasted malt bitterness here, as well a nice dose of sweetness. It coats the mouth nicely and really lets you taste all of it. The roasted bitterness and sweetness sticks to the palate and lingers for a bit. This has good drinkability. It is a really tasty beer, and I could easily have a few glasses of it in an evening. Overall, I think this is a good beer and a good example of the style. This is a solid beer, and I recommend trying it out. I would buy it again.","JizackFH","Beers"

The flavor is more roasty when cold, but as the beer warms you get wonderful notes of vanilla and chocolate with a good residual sweetness. The mouthfeel is full with low carbonation. I did sit on the full growled for a few days without opening. I wonder if it would have been more carbed if I had drank it fresh. Overall this beer is awesome, it really is one o the best porters I have had.","rowingbrewer","Nov 27, 2011"

I've read that this was brewed with cinnamon and vanilla, but I couldn't pick out those flavors above all the dark malt. The mouthfeel is dry, medium-light in body, perhaps a touch thin for the 7.5% ABV. An enjoyable beer, easy to drink, but not particularly special.","largadeer","Jan 05, 2011"

4.3,-1.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"On tap, served into a tulip. Pitch black with a one finger tan head that settles to a cap, very creamy with amazing lacing. Smell is bourbon and raw vanilla beans, spiced cinnamon, coffee beans, dark roasty malts, spicy hops. Taste is very sweet malts and some roasted malt bitterness, vanilla, slightly hoppy, a hint of coffee and some cinnamon (a later batch I had was heavy on the cinnamon, i prefer this version). Medium/heavy body with a light carbonation. This beer drinks and feels more like a spiced stout then a porter, but an excellent Christmas beer either way. One of the most drinkable spiced beers I have ever had. Sadly, TSA smashed the growler I was attempting to bring back so I wont get to have any more of this for a while.","nkersten","Dec 05, 2010"
