"Pulled from the cellar after two years."
"Insanely delicious. Just the right amount of sweetness. Perfect body. Smooth. Hides alcohol well. Superb."
""
"The aftertaste is strong with some more burn, but just a little. You don't need to do any shots if you are drinking this monster. Recommended for a taste or a treat."

"Great choice for beer review #200"

"O:  a pretty good beer."

"Bottled 2 19 14.  Thick mouthfeel in a good way.  Booziness mellowed with age.  Lots of dark chocolatey fruit."

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of the style, I've had a few Imperial Porters and I've found the thing that sets it apart from an imperial stout is mainly more of a dark fruit presence and this beer for sure had that which made it fall right inline with the style in my opinion.  This beer has ok drinkability, it's a little smooth, a little boozy, a little warming, not too crisp, sticky, a little filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, but I think one would be my limit, anymore than that and I think the sweetness and booze would start to wear on me.  What I like the most about this beer was how balanced the taste was, no aspect got too overpowering.  What I like the least about this beer was how well the booze was hidden, I think it could have been hidden just a little batter.  I would buy this beer again and I would love to throw a couple in the cellar to see how it ages.  I would recommend this beer, especially if you like big and strong dark beers.  All in all I was happy with this beer, it turned it pretty much how I expected and in the end I enjoyed sipping on it.  This is one of the better Evil Twin beers I've had and it's also one of the better Imperial Porters I've had.  Good job guys this this was a tasty beer, keep up the hard work."

"Starts off with balanced coffee and dark chocolate favors with strong molasses backbone. As it warms, more nuanced flavors appear, light vanilla, nutmeg (?), ever so subtle red wine. Then as it continues to warm, coffee and molasses dominate. Abv well hidden. A sipper for sure. Having two of these back to back might be challenging, not due to the abv but to the intensity of the flavors."
""
"Tastes like a plum soaked in coffee and alcohol then dipped in chocolate then rolled in brown sugar and spices."
""
"I love everything about this beer except the alcohol taste. The beer tastes great except for the alcohol taste. It looks great. You smell it and it tastes great. As soon as that alcohol taste bites you it is not that great."
""
""
""
"Thick, Dark, and viscous!  The nose on this is something I could sit and inhale all day!  Coffee, anise, and caramel?  The taste is similar, but a little less intense, though the finish is lingering and slightly peppery.  Even better as it warms.  Nice!"
""
"Overall: The brew is delicious, Evil Twin has porters and stouts on lock. This brew is another gem added to the library. borderline stout."
""
"Overall - A pretty complex tasting beer.  The charred/smokey notes come through during the aftertaste and chocolate/coffee at first.. but in the middle there is a lactose/odd peaty flavour that comes through that I can't decide if I like or hate.  Either way, this is an interesting beer that is worth a try."
""
""
""
"Drinkability – A very nice porter.  Another winner from Evil Twin."
""
""
"O: Not that interesting and too hot. This needs to be cellared before being release."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Complexity, a lot of flavors underneath, but for me unpleasantly overwhelming winey taste of alcohol on top of everything. If you cannot balance a high abv brew with other flavors, you should not release the beer. If that does not bother you, you will probably love it."
""
""
""
""
"This is a winner from Evil Twin. They know their dark beers, and this is no exception. Although this is an ""Imperial Porter", there's no doubt that you'll feel like you're drinking an Imperial Stout. Well done. Recommended."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 5/21/2014. Pours dense pitch black color with a small dense dark brown head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, fudge, toast, molasses, raisin, prune, licorice, dark bread, light smoke/char, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt and moderate dark fruit notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, fudge, toast, molasses, raisin, prune, licorice, dark bread, light smoke/char, and roasted earthiness. Moderate amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, molasses, raisin, prune, licorice, dark bread, light smoke/char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts and moderate dark fruit flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, moderately slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial porter. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts and moderate dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Like other “Imperial” Evil Twin beers, this was a slow sipper that was nice to take down in a controlled manner, allowing it to warm and bring out more flavor and aromas that helped hide the booze yet let the alcohol provide enough zing and buzz to add to the overall experience. Another quality Evil Twin beer that I really enjoyed and would recommend."
"Very good overall. Great complexity and well balanced."

"I'm fairly new to reviewing brews. I have, however, been drinking craft brews and seeking the best beer I can find for many years. I picked up a 4 pack of Lil B yesterday and I couldn't wait to get home and try it. The reviews I've read about Evil Twin Brewing are phenomenal and they are really on the cutting edge with the stuff they're putting out. Let me tell you, this beer does not disappoint. I've never given a beer a ""5" rating because I always want to leave room for improvement. This is the closest thing to a perfect beer I have come across in my travels. Outstanding by any means. I didn't want the one I drank to end. Do yourself a favor and give this one a try. It will not disappoint."

"This is outstanding.  I am starting to appreciate mouth feel and smell now.  I used to be a taste only matters guy.  I get it now.  This feel and tastes great.  At 11.5% ABV you don't know it.  If you are debating that $15 tag for a 4 pack you have to trust me.  Get this.  This is in my top 10 and possibly top 5.  I am also pretty sure that this is the top rated beer among Evil Twins readily available brews."

"11/28/12 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Part of a flight of some serious stuff. Porter? Stout? Somebody help me out! Thinkin' raisins, prunes, figs & chocolate without hardly any sugars. Not bitter, mind, but redolent none the less. Not exactly refreshing but not unpleasant either. In a word 'serious'. Welcome to the club."

"Poured black as night with a little foamy head. Smells malty, chocolate and fruity. Almost like a cross between a stout and porter. Kind of like when two attractive people pop out a few good looking kids. All the best from both gene pools. Dark and smooth going down. Coffee up front on the taste. The alcohol takes second to hit you in the taste. Super great beer. Can't believe it is 11.5%."
"O:  I really, REALLY like this beer.  I'd love to see what a good barrel (or some vanilla beans) would do to it.  Might try to pick some up to stick in the cellar and see what some time does to that warmth.  Maybe a little smoothing would make it perfect....  We'll see.  Highly recommended."

"O: a huge, flavorful. Full bodied imperial porter.  Well brewed, really nice.  I've had a few imperial porters that were over-the-top, but this one is very nice.  Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  great big Porter.  Thick, smoothe, and black, with a big body.......like Mel B.  Will buy again."
""
""
"D:  An Imperial Porter no doubt with some real intense roast flavors.  This drinks better than most imperial stouts and delivers more depth of flavor than any other Porter I have had to date.  The balance is done so well with a great ratio of the malt sweetness to lighter feel.  Evil Twin sure can make some killer dark ales."

"O: This was such a good beer. For being 11.5%, I was floored at the lack of hotness it had. Only after it had warmed for a while did I get any kind of burn. I highly recommend trying this one, I hope I can score some more of this soon."
"Great beer."

"12 oz. bottle poured into a mug. Very dark brown grading into black, with a light dappling of mocha brown head. Aroma is decidedly roasted, black coffee and light smoke with some sweeter toffee and raisin overtones, even a hint of orchard fruit and tangy English hops. Palate is equal parts roast and sweet, dark chocolate and day old black coffee, brittle toffee, rum-soaked raisins, brown bread, a hint of caraway, and a rather pleasing floral alcohol warmth. Low carbonation and quite viscous, heavy ... Finishes bitter and a tad medicinal, vague hop echoes and that same astringent taste that lingers for a while after your morning coffee. Minimal ash. This is hearty fare indeed, well-crafted and smooth sailing despite the potent flavors involved. I get why this brew is used as the base for things like Imperial Biscotti Break and the like. I think it stands up very well in an unadulterated form."

"I enjoy it -- it's the dark fruitiest dark beer I've ever had, which I didn't see coming. At the same price, I'd much prefer ET's I Love You With My Stout, as its roastiness, tobacco qualities, and deeper depth of flavor, but this is still an outstanding beer. To give you an idea of how phenomenal Evil Twin's dark brews are, this is my lowest scored one, and I'd consider it to be a disappointment. Another tasty sipper from Evil Twin."

"O: This is a really nicely done BIG porter. Likely blurring the lines between porter and stout, or maybe crossing it entirely, but very tasty. A good offering from Evil Twin for sure."
"Pours a five-finger, thick brown head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Black color, no highlights. Medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Nose is chocolate and molasses and flavor is smooth chocolate and molasses malt. Higher ABV is hidden. Decent Imp porter. $4.99 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, MA. Bottled Feb 19, 2014."
""
""
""
""

"Pours dark mahogany with slight light caramel colored head. Nose is honey, sweet chocolate and sugar. Tangy at the finish. Mostly silken chocolate.. Smoke.. Booze burn and dark cherry. Mouthfeel is thick and heavy. Overall a big beer.. This porter is uniquely smooth and strong"
"O-A decadent, unique beer with aggressive flavors. Very pleased with a single 12 oz. bottle of this. A big, sweet, boozy, hedonistic offering."
""
""
""
"Good beer, has some real nice quad-dy notes to but definitely brings roast too. It's sweet though. Needs to be paired with a food that can offset its rather potent sweetness, but an enjoyable imperial stout (or porter or whatever)/quad hybrid."

"I had heard great things about this beer and; while it is good, I was somewhat dissappointed. This porter pours a deep black with a short lived tan head that leaves beautiful lacing. The aroma is typical coffee, chocolate, vanilla, licorice, and booze. But there is something off about the smell. I can't put my finger on it but it seems forced and artificial. The flavor carries the same notes both good and bad. It is very nice and much more imperial stout than porter, but that fake off note still is present plus a slightly metallic aftertaste in finish. This is good but just not quite as good as I had heard or as I wanted it to be."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good imperial version of a porter. Very much like a solid imperial stout with a good dark taste of chocolate, coffee, and some smoke."
""
""
""
""
""
"A very good beer.  It's not going to breach the upper echelons of the style, but there is definitely a bunch going on.  It's mildly sweet, a bit tart, but has a good over balance with the bittering side of the beer."

"O: One of the best porters I've ever tried. Find it and be wowed. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"the beer is near black with over an inch of foamy beige head. The aroma brings coca, bitter chocolates, coffee, dark roast. Taste is solid. I'm a fan. Big robust beer and well balanced. Full bodied and palate coating, yet easy drinking. We had no problem finishing the bottle. Very tasty."

""

"Solid brownish black with a fizzy head that settles to a ring of foam. Sweet chocolates smell with a hint of smoke and roast and molasses. The flavor is rich chocolate, sweet, lightly roasty and bitter. The chocolate and cocoa linger well into the aftertaste. Drinks like it is 7% abv. Smooth feel. Wonderful beer here. Would definitely get this again."

"A massive porter that has some very good flavors. Would definitely buy again."

"This is an absolutely fantastic stout - err, imperial porter. Yeah. Anyway, it's potent and strong, thick and creamy, and exceptionally well-balanced. It's not incredibly creative - there's nothing"
""
""
""
"This is a big beer in just about every way. On the palate it starts out with fruitier notes of cooked cherries, raisins, and plums. On the mid palate roasted undertones of coffee and and bittersweet molasses push forward and covering up the present alcohol. The balance of this beer really shines through in the smoothness in which this beer finishes."

"O - This was very good. Drinks more like a stout than a porter. Very drinkable for being 11.5%."

"Really dark black color, brown head with good retention. In the nose coffe, chocolate, roastness, dark druits as plums and raisins, caramel/toffe really complex aroma. In the taste the complexity is equal, coffe, dark chocolate, plums, raisins and caramel/toffe. The mouthfeel is really good, high and smooth body. Wonderfull brew!"
""
"on tap at hops and pie, this is a dark one. inky black and showing a pretty sturdy and lasting half inch of mocha colored head. the nose on this is a great combination of earthy bitterness and dark malty sweetness, almost like a milk stout with a lot of body and that detectable and intentional residual sugar element. moderately bitter in taste though, warming alcohol too, and a grain density usually reserved for colossal imperial stouts. there is a delicacy to this despite its size, and the blackness of the grain comes through not as bitter as expected. some bakers chocolate gives it a little character, and i get a hint of vanilla smoke before the finish. creamy texture while still being well carbonated, and palate coating as anything. drinks slowly, which is fine, because it really opens up with temperature. this is a dynamite beer, like so many evil twin brews, it holds my attention endlessly."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not sure what makes this a porter, but very good. Cheers."
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, smoke, cocoa, vanilla, oatmeal raisin cookie dough, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa, char, soy sauce, and metallic flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer with a solid set of aromas, but the taste is way too hard to stomach with the metallic and other off flavors."

"Because of the higher alcohol content, and having already drunk another beer earlier, I was only able to finish half of the bottle. I still have a bottle left, but I may have to separate it into 2 servings to share."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A huge beer at 11.5% abv. Its power is obvious with all the vinous qualities, but it drinks very gently. Evil Twin makes some gargantuan beers, but what's more impressive is their ability to keep these beers drinkable despite their brawn."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I had high hopes for this imperial porter, but in the end was left a little wanting. The most off-putting was the little bit of wet dog taste; if not for that, I probably would have rated it at least half a point higher in both taste and overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Moutfheel is pretty much perfect. It's a soft full bodied beer. Great carbonation level that was sweet, rich, bold, with a nice dry bitter finish at the end. Good all around beer, great drinkability level. Can hang with the best dark beers out there. Nice job."
""
""
""
"A big, sweet interpretation of a porter. Tastes like dark chocolate covered cherries with a bit of spice on the finish that gives you a little tingle- cayenne like. Definitely a bit sweet, but in a liqueur sort of way. This would be nice in front of a roaring fire after a nice winter meal, or perhaps as a post-priandal beverage with the missus? In any case it does remind me of a box of chocolates. Not an every day drink, but one with a well-done very particular taste. Very smooth and silky as well. Interesting."
"O- Dark fruit is showcased in this brew and its a nice change from a typical porter. It's definitely a sipper, but not overpowering"
""
""
""
""
"Taste:  super roasty  espresso blast.  followed by syrupy highly caramelized sugars and dark fruit reduction -  fig,  prune.   Dark chocolate covered waffle cone.  Earthy hopping and mild alcohol balance the sweet.  Full bodied,  creamy carbonation cuts through.  Decadent,  incredibly delicious. 3/13  bottling."

"A hell of an imperial porter, with strong RIS or DIPA tendencies. The somewhat sour fruit does drag this kicking and screaming squarely back into porter territory, only to be bedeviled by the subtle smoke and burgeoning booze. Complex, sexy, and quite compelling. Watch out if this one suggests going back home to its place."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep dark cola brown with a thinner beige head atop that doesn't last long,aromas of dark fruit and brown sugar really jump out at ya,sweet alcohol and a faint nuttiness there as well.Dark fruit and a whiskey-like flavor up front with minimal roast and more molasses and brown sugar sweetness in the end,it's all of 11.5% here.It's big and pretty sweet but I like it,sweet but not overly so it's a great sipper."
""
""
""
""
"This is alright, but over-priced & over-rated to me, won't buy again unless the price point is MUCH better. Worth a try, but not if you want value. Seems like this could stand about 6 more months of aging, Never quite turns the corner for me"
""
""
""
""
"O - Very burnt and bitter. I am not a fan."
"A very well-done imperial dark ale. Big and robust all-around: appearance, aroma, and flavor. It's well-rounded, deep and complex. The malts and hops do a good job of keeping the high ABV under control taste-wise. Need a big'n? Try this one..."

"O-This is a fantastic beer, albeit one that drinks like meal. The mixture of fruit flavors (like cherry and blueberry), on the one hand, and choco/vanilla/caramel flavors, on the other hand, is really well-done. The mouthfeel also pairs incredibly well with the flavors and makes for a milk-shake-like experience. Alcohol is well-concealed, and the brew sips beautifully. If you don't like big, sweet beers, stay away, but that is OK, because it will leave more for me."
"o - Overall I thought this was a very good, strong porter. It's no where near the Aun Mas Cafe Jesus and Imperial Biscotti Break beers, but another good big porter/stout. Lots of roasted notes and chocolate, worth checking out."

"12oz bottle ~$3.50. Super dark black, huge head at first which was dark brown. Aroma is sweet, dark, hints of cookie dough, smells rich. Flavor was super rich dark chocolate, sugar, no hint of alcohol at all. This could just as easily been labeled as an imperial stout, not sure what the difference here is but this was quality. In fact, I think this was better than the imperial biscotti break. Good stuff."
""
""
"11.5 pct ABV is completely masked in this exceptionally smooth, creamy and a touch thin drinkable porter."
""
""
""

"The beer pours like dark roast coffee, oozing between a deep brown and a black coloring. It pours with a tiny head of miniscule, dark khaki bubbles (as is expected at this ABV), which quickly slicks into a scrim ring along the glass. The beer leaves a super slick, thin curtain of lacing when it washes over the glass, along with a small set of legs to suggest its alcohol content. In body, the beer is too dark to penetrate, but as it pours it does not seem to be the thickest thing to ever come out of a bottle… On the nose, the beer smells richly fruity with dark plum, raisin, and chocolate notes. Brown sugar and dates also appear on the nose, along with the ghost of fusel alcohol. The smell is richly fruity both in malt and yeast character, blending with slight nutty smells. Roast coffee is also present, but it is sitting beside a very pungent raisin/date/plum dipped in brown sugar and chocolate. On the tongue, the beer tastes richly sweet at first, almost cloying with definite alcohol notes, but this perfectly melds into a dry, lightly bitter roast as the beer finishes. There is a light, tart pop at the back of the finish, which adds a level of complexity that I did not expect from this beer. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet plums dipped in a light chocolate. Faint raisins and brown sugar dance on the tongue after the initial flavor, but they are buoyed along by cloying, sweet alcohol that takes a little away from the beer. Luckily, this alcohol is very brief, and is bludgeoned aside by beautiful, dry, French roast coffee. A touch of vanilla and cinnamon, also, bring light spice to the tongue, perhaps from the alcohol, just as the coffee flavor moves in. The finish is light, but long and gives hints of praline, pecans and milk chocolate. In the mouth, this beer feels silky smooth and on the heavy side of medium in body. Carbonation is smooth and velvety, blanketing the tongue in oozing goodness. The mouth is left roasted dry and slightly sticky. Overall, this is a beautifully complex and rich porter. Its thinner mouthfeel and silkiness definitely lend it to the porter style, and not to the thick and chewy stouts, but it works beautifully. This beer is not revolutionary, nor is it even that weird in today’s beer world, but it is well crafted and richly nuanced. I think it could do with a little aging to smooth out the cloying alcohol in the middle of the sip, but I still think it’s great to drink now."

"Poured a blackish body with one finger tan head and minimal lace on top of an aroma consisting mostly of roasted and coffee notes, but also some breadiness, dark chocolate, toffee and some dark fruits. Thick, chewey, hearty, all words that could describe this fuller-bodied beer passing over my tongue, and the taste is similiar to the nose. A roasted, coffee-esque dryness is in the beer along with dark chocolate, caramel, toffee, possible figs or dark fruits and has a sticky finish (ABV is muted in the finish). An enjoyable sipper but for some reason this beer felt slightly offbalance."

"This is an enjoyable imperial porter. It compares favorably to many top tier imperial stouts, doing nothing to clarify that vague line between porters and stouts (if there ever was one to begin with). I'm glad this came in a 4 pack because I get to enjoy it 4 times over the coming several months. Another big dark beer from Evil Twin that deserves your money."
"D - Somewhat disappointing compared to Imperial Biscotti Break and other variants. Seems messy and unfocused. I'd be interesting in revisiting this in a small serving on-tap small serving, but drinking a full 12oz bottle would be a challenge for me."
""
""
""
""
"Starts out really well, ends up not so much for me. For the price this will probably be the last Evil Twin brew I try in a bottle. Will only seek out on draft where I can get half pours."
"Overall –A rather nice brew overall. It has a sweeter roasted aroma with the taste matching up in the front, but more toward the end it dries out rather nicely creating a nicely roasted flavor to linger on the tongue. A rather nice slow sipper."

"Pours a black color. 1/3 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of strong roasted malt, sweet malt, alcohol, hops, slight oatmeal, and a hint of sugar. Fits the style of an American Porter. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, alcohol, slight sweet malt, hops, hint of pale malt, hint of yeast, hint of pine, and slight citrus. Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, and blend."

"Drinkability: I mean this is a nice porter or Imperial porter I should say, however, as far as flavor goes, I'd much rather go for Founder's Porter. Such a better beer. The price point on this one two isn't justified by the flavor. Its good, but not that good. Somewhere around $13 a 4-pack, I'd rather go for Founder's at $10 a 6er. This is a good beer, don't get me wrong but I feel I'm left wanting more. Glad I've tried it, but I would rather drink something else, and come back to something else."

"a thick black sludgy pour with a finger of very dark brown head.. this looks ridiculously dark. smells of dark chocolate, molasses, coffee, licorice, brown sugar. this is a very sweet beer, lots of sugary sweet malt, milk chocolate AND dark chocolate notes, tobacco, licorice.. a very nice tasting blend of dark roasted grains combine to make this roasty, yet sweet beer. full body with low carbonation and a nice creamy mouthfeel. this beer is pretty much a meal on its own. very nice and heavy, but so flavorful that the abv is hidden behind the sweetness of it. another wonderful beer from evil twin!"
""
"Smoothness is the focus in this brew's feel, though a crisp bite hits up front. A full body coats the tongue but slides off a little in the finish (a good thing), where just a bit of dryness comes through and a little more crispness comes back out on the roof of the mouth particularly."

"overall a very good imp stout that fans of the style should definitely try if they see it available."

"O: A big time porter... Lack of big finish and maybe a touch of roast help it remain just under stout territory. Definitely nicer and more drinkable as it warms. A big brew at 11.5%"

"Overall, for an imperial porter this is really nice. Borderline imperial stout, but restrains the roasted malts and emphasized the English yeast character well throughout."
"O. It is so flavorful and complex. I really like this, but if you have more than one or two you will be staggering, no doubt."

"Pours black. Quite black. Tiny bit of brown at the edges but this beer is dark. A nice brown head puffed up at first, but it faded after a couple minutes, leaving behind some scummy-looking lacing. The aroma is sweet caramel and cocoa and a lightly acidic roast edge. There's also a healthy dose of vanilla, dates and a touch of soy, which probably grows as the beer ages. Taste is sweet with lots of toasty malt flavors. Vanilla stands out. The sweetness starts out with light caramel and gets darker and darker. Big chocolate fading into coffee and roast at the end. Toffee, sherry, molasses, mild smoke. It's a little bland upfront, but malt complexity comes out as the beer progresses. Letting the beer warm up helps a lot, too. The aftertaste is chocolate, sherry, Bailey's, smoke and roasted coffee. The mouthfeel is thick and smooth. This beer isn't quite as refined as the Jesus series, but it's a dead solid imperial porter with a great mouthfeel and lots of good flavor for a pretty cheap price. Evil Twin is ridiculously good at making imperial porters/stouts."

"Full bodied, barely carbonated (nice). Amazingly rich and incredibly smooth, beyond smooth. Delicious squared. But let it warm up first!"

"O - One of my new favorite porters. Damn good tasting, and actually somehwta refreshing. Creamier than most porters, yet remained very drinkable.. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"O – I know that styles don’t quite matter, especially when you’re talking stouts vs. porters, but the only thing that is like a porter about this one is the slightly thinner mouthfeel. This smells, tastes, and feels like an imperial stout. It certainly has the ABV for it. It smells very nice and tastes good, but drinkability suffers with the high ABV and strong throat-warmth. I’ve heard that this is the base beer for (Imperial) Biscotti Break and I’ll tell you, I much prefer this. It is not cloying at all and has more roasted character. Nice beer from Evil Twin."

"O- There are some nice hints of malt with some complexity but they are very faint and only come through when it is really warm in the last 3 oz."
""
""

"Poured out as a deep black color with a mocha creamy head on top. The head settles a bit and leaves a moderate to light lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer is roasted and earthy, it's almost musty and charred. The taste of the beer is slightly sweet with a good amount of roast in there as well, more earthy robust flavors with a burnt bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel was dry, a little high in carbonation but heavy as well. Overall this beer was decent, not something I'd spend a lot of money on though."
""
"Says a ""Porter"" but it tastes like a Russian Imperial Stout. Classic, great flavors and smells. I would buy and drink it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer, like other high gravity heavily roasted offerings from Evil Twin, is so elusively tasty you really don't notice the ABV until it's too late. Definitely worth whatever exorbitant amount of money I paid for it."

"O: A very good big porter/stout. I don't know the price in bottles, but this is certainly a good effort."
"My least favourite aspect of this brew is mainly just that I feel compelled to listen to The Based God while drinking it, and, while I respect that he's doing his thing and trying to stay pure yadda yadda yadda... I don't find him to be a very good rapper. His songs just don't do anything for me. The beer is substantially better than the rapper."

"22 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with a quarter inch tan head that didn't stay around for too long. Not much lacing at all. Aroma is very nice, the brew smells like roasted malt, dark fruit, vanilla, bittersweet chocolate, and a bit of coffee and licorice. The brew tastes mostly sweet, like dark fruit, vanilla, milk chocolate/chocolate syrup, molasses, roasted/charred malt, and some coffee. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's smooth and syrupy with low carbonation. I think it's a good brew overall. If you like sweet tasting beers, then you should enjoy this one. $12.49 a bomber."

"Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours pitch black with no initial signs of carbonation, but just after the pour a thin film of light tan covered the glass and dissipated to a ring around the glass. Nice complex aroma of sweet toasted malt, vanilla, chocolate, dark dried fruit. Flavor follows with toasted malt, vanilla, licorice, chocolate and dark dried fruit, rather sweet. The ABV is completely undetectable, which is amazing. Heavy bodied and decent mouth feel, but I couldn't help but think how superb this would have been with some active carbonation. Guess you can't have everything, this is still an excellent complex imperial porter. I've enjoyed the whole Biscotti Break family and hope to see more."

"Even though this beer is classified as an imperial porter, it drinks much bigger. Lil' B is the base beer for Imperial Biscotti Break, but I liked this so much better (and I happen to be a huge fan of espresso, vanilla and almonds, which are added to Lil' B to create Biscotti Break). With its smooth, sweet, indulgent richness and over the top mouthfeel, it brought back memories of earlier Dark Lord vintages."

"Pours just like used motor oil-thick and viscous right out of the bottle. Jet black with a very slight tan head on top. Deep raisen, dark dried fruit aroma. Chocolate and espresso notes. Mild oak and port. Slightly treacle like and a faint caramel sweetness. Big and bold dark roast flavors. Deep espresso and bakers chocolate. Sticky toffee sweetness to it as well. Velvety smooth mouthfeel. Lip smackingly sweet finish. No sense of being so high in abv. WOW! My first offering from these folks and I am just blown away. Just a huge wonderful beer all in. Has desert island beer written all over it."

"Overall: I thought this one was quite good. The balance of flavors was very nice. The mouthfeel could have been a bit less thick. I might have another depending on the price point."
""

"The mouthfeel is extremely thick. Many imperial stouts don't achieve the fullness and silkiness that Lil' B does. Overall, this is a very good imperial stout. Forget this porter business. It's a big ol' stout."

""

"Looks like one would expect. Notes of chocolate and dark fruit in the aroma. Taste has a little more of a charred malt taste along with chocolate, figs and a little raisin. Feel medium-heavy with little carbonation. All in all, it's got some taste, but I can't help comparing it to this year's Black Butte XXIV and favoring that one. This isn't quite as good and costs more. However, this one isn't a one-and-done brew, so there's that."
"M: Full bodied. Very silky."

"O - It was a pretty good imp porter (eventhough it felt like a stout), ABV really comes trough. Could have used a tad more carbonation for me and maybe a few more hops.."

"Poured from tap into oversized snifter at Avenue Pub NOLA. Pours an oily black color with thin tan head. Crazy good roasted sweet malts, booze, dark fruit aromas. Taste is so smooth boozey dark fruit, chocolatey bourbon vanilla, slight coffee as well. This is just so crazy good and it gets better as it warms...wow. Slightly bitter mouthfeel, which I dig, nonetheless a spectacular amazing brew. Go have one now!"
""
"O: I'm kinda dissapointed here, especially after seeing the reviews this beer has gotten so far.... This is the second time I've tried it, once on tap and once out of the bottle and neither time was I overly impressed, I am not a huge fan of dark fruit and. Deffinatly do not expect to find them in my porter wether it be imperial or not, I felt this could have been good with much more coffee and roastyness. But overall this is just an average brew to me,"
"Delicious, straight-forward, stouty goodness."
"O: Wow, unexpectedly good. Especially for my first Evil Twin beer. One of the best imperial porters I've ever had, if not THE best. Strong fruitiness and milder roasted malt (though there is still plenty at 11.5% ABV) keeps this firmly in porter territory and doesn't cross over into imperial stout-dom. Wonderfully fruity, smooth and creamy. Balanced flavor. An expertly crafted brew in my opinion."
""
""
""
"O: Alcohol is extremely well hidden in this beer as you can detect none of the 11.5% ABV at all. Enjoyable but definitely a beer you need to take your time drinking, so drink it slow and enjoy."
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink considering its strength because the alcohol is very well hidden from the palate and it isn’t that full in body. It’s also not nearly as sweet compared to other beers in the style."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, this is a really good beer.  Honestly, my expectations were through the roof, as my last couple of Evil Twin beers were just spectacular.  Ive heard this is the ""base beer"" to Imperial Biscotti.  Im not exactly sure what that means, and dont know if its true or not.  There are definitely similarities, but there are differences as well.  It doesnt live up to IBB, but then again most nothing does as thats one of my favorite beers, but this one is very good in its own right.  My limited experience with Imperial/Baltic Porters has me rating them as if they were IS's, which may not be fair.  Either way, certainly an enjoyable beer, that I recommend and gladly would drink again.  I wont be running to the store to buy up the rest of the supply like I did for Imperial Biscotti though.  "
"O- This beer got bitches on deck. Seriously, this is a damn fine Paris Hilton style beer. The price is a bit steep, but I'm glad I picked this up, it's really delicious. Very drinkable for such a big beer as well, alcohol is nicely hidden. Master-chef cook chef cook swag swag swag."
"With its extended finish of milk chocolate, vanilla, and fruit, the beer continues to reward the palate with the same satisfaction as fine brandy or cognac, in place of after dinner dessert. With beers like Lil' B, Evil Twin continues to remind me why it's alright to pay such exorbitant prices for their beers- they are simply worth it."
"The best porter I’ve ever tasted, hands down. I’m not usually a big fan of Baltic style porters, only because I find them to be too sweet, but this Imperial version is deceptively complex. At first, I thought it was a bit flabby in texture, and totally straightforward in flavor. However, as I continued to sip this voluptuous monster, flavors other than chocolate, toffee, and vanilla began to emerge...leather, tobacco, plum, kumquat, raisin, sandalwood, smoke, Cabernet, and bourbon began to poke out their heads, seemingly out of nowhere. The richness continued to build, but the sweetness never became overbearing, and leveled out at just the right point. This may be the best Evil Twin I’ve tasted, which is even more surprising when one takes note of the fact that it’s a contract brew executed by Westbrook Brewing Co of Mount Pleasant, S.C. I’d never heard of them, but I’ll definitely be looking for any future nationally distributed beers of theirs."
"This is a truly wonderful beer deserving of more recognition."

"Because MSquared2 told me to tick Evil Twin brews this night… Served from bottle into a Mikkeller Teku (semi-proper!). Poured pitch black with a one finger brown head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, bread, milk chocolate, sweet alcohol, vanilla, and very subtle coffee. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, bread, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, vanilla, sweet alcohol, and coffee. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was fairly great brew. Where did this one come from!? Wow… Everything going on in this one was nothing short of fantastic and made it quite easy to drink despite the ABV going on here. The flavors and aromas going on here are nothing short of excellent as they are all on-point. This is definitely a really well done brew. If you have not had the pleasure of enjoying this one, you need to make it happen. Nicely done guys!"
