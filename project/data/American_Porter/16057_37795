In spite of the darkness, it is highly drinkable any time of the year thanks to the high carbonation and the refreshing, different coconut flavors.

For the price of a 4 pack here in Hawaii I think it's not worth it.  It's a decent porter in my opinion, but that's about it. It's still a quality beer it doesn't taste cheap.

4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and a pretty good example of the style, it's not a traditional American Porter, but the coconut shows up just enough to compliment the Porter base and not overpower it, it's an American Porter first and a Coconut beer second. This beer had great drinkability, if I was in the mood for a Porter I could see myself drinking few of these, it was smooth, not filling, and the flavors did a nice job at holding my attention. What I liked the most about this beer was the Porter base, it was a very well done Porter with lots of great roasted and chocolate like flavors. What I liked the least about this beer was the lighter coconut flavor, I think the Porter base was strong enough to hold up more Coconut flavors without being overpowered by them, but it didn't hurt this beer as much as I expected. If this beer was available to me I would for sure buy It, I would like to try a can that I know is fresh to see if the coconut is a little more pronounced and I would recommend this to anyone who likes American Porters, even if you aren't the biggest fan of Coconut I think you could still find this beer enjoyable. All in all I enjoyed this beer, it may have not been as coconut forward as I expected but the Porter base was awesome and I'm not sure how more coconut would affect this beer, I have had a couple coconut beers that tasted like Malibu Rum and Sun tan lotion and I wouldn't want that to happen to this beer. This was my first beer from Maui Brewing Company and it made for a good first impression, Maui isn't available in Michigan, but I would for sure like to try more of their beers, nice work guys, Thanks a lot Ben for giving my a chance to try this beer","StoutHunter","Aug 31, 2013"

Coconut comes through almost barely and in the form of a ""burnt"" coconut taste. really have to look for it which might be a good thing since i hated kona's coco brown. Goes down nice and easy though for such having so many robust and roasty flavors. A little messy at parts with the coconut flavor adding close to nothing but as a porter not bad. A little pricey but that might have to due with how far it had to travel to get to me.","jtierney89","Jun 20, 2013"

Love Maui Brewing Company's other beer though so I wouldn't talk anybody out of experimenting.","sh00ky","May 24, 2013"

The beer was a dark malty color when poured into a snifter. There was about a half inch, off-white head which seemed a little unusual for a porter. The fluffy head made the aroma leap into my nose a little easier, sending notes of malt and flakes of coconut into a scent detector. The initial taste was a dark malty thrust with the coconut hints far in the background. Also present was a hint of nuttiness and something flowery that I could not identify. The thicker texture of the mouthfeel allowed the porter to coat the tongue and lending staying power to taste. For a porter, this is a nice drinker. Like most people, I did not buy this as a porter. The unique coconut spin on a porter is what will draw the attention of drinkers. In this respect, I found the beer disappointing because the coconut was not potent enough overwhelm my palate.","JohnnyHopps","Sep 30, 2012"

You're brewers for crying out loud. If I wanted a porter that tasted like an island themed air freshener, I'd buy a wine cooler. This beer has performed a deed known to be nearly impossible, to hint at a flavoring, and have it compliment the beer without dominated it. Here's looking at you, Hell or High Watermelon. CoCoNut Porter is a great beer because it is first and foremost, a great porter. The coconut in it is just a silver lining that makes me like the taste of the beer more, as all beer flavoring should do.","corylew","Nov 25, 2011"

Let the can warm some out of the fridge then poured a giant, foamy, frothy, fluffy, sudsy tan head that quickly settled to some islands, a ring, and a little lace. Color is almost opaque black brown; in the narrowest part of the glass it was clear. Aroma is malt, roast, cocoa, coffee, and a bit of coconut. Flavor's much like nose with malt, roast, sweet, and carbonic tang on top, other stuff later. Body and carbonation are smack on. Finish is like flavor with certain flavor lasting longer than others, but in a satisfying way. I could have a few more of these.","drpimento","Nov 11, 2011"

4.07,2.5,3,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Coconut porter is one of the more interesting beers I've heard of before; excited to try this one. Pours deep, deep brown, basically black out of the can. Thick, bubbly, light brown head tops the beer and dissipates quickly. A very smooth and mellow aroma - chocolate, almond, coconut notes. Lightly roasty with some caramel going on as well. The flavor is malty up front, a bit more roasted malt, some caramel sweetness, and some dark chocolate. A deeper, more coffee-like, nutty malt flavor lingers on the tongue after drinking. Huge depth of flavor here, good complexity; a very smooth and mellow, balanced beer.","goldbot","Sep 11, 2011"

3.86,-2.8,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours an amber and brown streaked black with a fingers worth of dark tan head. A sticky tan lacing streaks down the length of the glass. The nose is dominated by rich chocolate malts, with some roasted notes as well as some vanilla and faint coconut. The coconut comes through much more in the flavor, though it still plays second fiddle to the chocolate. The coconut flavor mixed with the chocolate instantly reminded me of an Almond Joy candy bar, more smooth and rich than citrus flavored like you'd expect from a pina colada or sweeter drink. Coffee and toasted nut notes hang around as well. A really good amount of flavor without anything becoming overwhelming. It has a smooth, creamy mouthfeel and medium body with a sweet, lingering finish. A very enjoyable beer that I hope I cross paths with again!","charliedvrs","Aug 31, 2011"

3.89,-2,3,4,4,3.5,4,"Dark brown in color with slight tan head. Good carbonation. Smells of dark chocolate and roasted barley. The labeling description on this is on the money with ""toasted coconut"". At first sip you know can taste the dance between chocolate, toasted coconuts, dark coffee and roasted malts. The porter genetics appear to win the struggle over the coconut flavors, though. Would love to see the porter flavors toned down just a bit, but great nonetheless. Medium in the mouth. Worth seeking and trying.","polisanl","Aug 28, 2011"

The nose is nearly non-existent. I sniffed this glass for 30 seconds trying to find something, and I couldn't. I moved on to pinpointing the taste aspects, and eventually got some hints of earthy alcohol, but that was about it. The taste is absent of any coconut whatseover. I don't know where that comes from, but I couldn't find it. That being said, there's a nice taste of cocoa, small vanilla notes, and some nuttiness.

The taste is of roasted malts, coffee, a little dark chocolate, some smokiness and a hint of sweetness perhaps from the coconut. There is some hoppy and roasted malt bitterness at the end.

4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Good all across the board. Doesn't really stand out in any way, but it's very solid. One of the better porters I've had, but a step below the top ones in complexity, and lacking that special something.","zeledonia","Jul 20, 2011"
3.65,-8.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O: This is undeniably a tasty, coconut porter. That being said, there's a reasonably long road to perfection for this. More complexity, work on the aftertaste, a creamier body, and I think you'd have an amazing coconut porter here. As it is though, while still preferable to the majority of porters I've tried and probably the best coconut taste of any year-round beer I've had, it's just a better-than-average porter with occassionally exceptional good flavor.","Klym","Jul 18, 2011"

Mild milk chocolate, light brown sugar. It wasn't until half-way through the beer, and after it warmed a bit, that I was able to parse-out the coconut. At that point, my impression was a bit of Mounds candy bar. Bottom line - candy counter in a can.","Brent","Jul 18, 2011"

I never thought that I would spend almost a half year on this god forsaken island but here I am, carving my exploits into another coconut tree using coconut shards to commemorate this day. Milk in milk out. It seems coconuts are the only vexing produce available and I long for variety. A crate washed up on shore and I prayed for provisions or a flare gun, lamentably, only a driftwood case of Coppertone presented itself. The smell was too much to bear. I fear that I am going mad sustaining only on a diet of coconuts. There is a pun available somewhere but my rancid coconut breath can hardly utter such trifles. I long to hold my beloved and drink a pina colada with her as soon as I escape; someday.","SubpoenaDeuces","Jul 05, 2011"

This is an excellent all weather dark beer, and would be great with a steak dinner or even as a desert brew. As it warms, the robustness gets even deeper and the buttery texture gets even smoother. When I go to Maui in a few months, this could very well be a go to brew for me!","ChrisCage","Jun 26, 2011"
3.8,-4.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Big thanks to Matty D. Martin for the share. Out of a 4-pack, two seemed borderline infected, and two are pretty good. This review is for a good can. The brew pours a coffee-brown hue, visibly thinner, and is capped with a tan froth that recedes quickly. The nose offers some roastiness and some small coffee hints. I don't get coconut aromatically. The flavor actually reveals a bit coconut, just a hint. It is not very sweet, more of a straight-up porter, offering notes of roast, coffee grounds, and herbal hoppiness. As it airs out, the coconut is more pronounced. The feel is relatively thin. Overall, pretty nice, but not outstanding; I wish this beer was good as it theoretically sounds.","ktrillionaire","Jun 26, 2011"

The aroma is roasty with a touch of coconut and chocolate. Taste is similar, and is quite light with a bit of sweetness and a bit more coconut than the aroma. Very nice.

There is coconut, roasted malts, some coffee. Upon sipping this interesting beer, I taste some dark coffee, roasted malts and yes, some coconut, but nothing overpowering or too aggressive. MF leans towards full bodied, with a velvet texture. This one was fun to try, would be nice if some of this made it out closer to Connecticut.","mltobin","Jun 21, 2011"

This beer pours a Coca Cola like dark, dark brown with a thick and frothy beige colored head. The aromas consist of vanilla, chocolate, lightly roasted malts, and a milk stout like sweetness. It smells like no other porter I've had. The flavors are of sweet and bitter chocolate, vanilla, slight coffee, and again a milk stout like sweetness. It has really good flavor the flavors are perfectly proportionate. It is a little light in body but I've noticed that porters and stouts are generally lighter from a can.

3.95,-0.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Atmosphere is good. Dark intimidating appearance, and a nice frothy head (especially for a can). Nose is not complex, but heavily toasted malt, coffee, and dark chocolate.

3.78,-4.8,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"The coconut gets pushed aside flavor-wise, as heftier notes of dark roasted malt grains, coffee, and chocolate coat the tongue. A hint of sweetness lingers in the finish with more roast and some earthy hops. The mouthfeel walks the line between a thick, stout-like porter and that of the more traditional English counterparts. Not a bad beer by any means, but a tad gimmicky when all is said and done. Many better porters are out there to choose from...","wagenvolks","May 13, 2011"
3.58,-9.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"O: Maui Brewing's CoCoNut Porter was a nice way to start the night. It wasn't quite what I had expected and a bit of a letdown from the coconut department.

Lots of tanned heading shows up as well. More roasted notes than I would have expected here, with some bitter dark chocolate, and just a tiny hint of the coconut. Ahh there is the coconut, but it is still fairly subdued in a good way. Lots of coffee comes through too. Mouthfeel is about medium, with great drinkability.

Initial taste is sweet vanilla, going into a bit of coffee. Strong coconut on the finish as well as a decent bitterness. Light bodied. Very smooth. Medium-low carbonation. Enjoyable beer.

3.66,-7.8,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured from a can into a pint glass, the beer is a nice, dark black, which is slightly translucent, and has highlights of amber-brown when held up to the light. The beer starts out with a thick, fluffy pillow of tan head that settles and disappears as the beer has time to sit. It has strong aromas of chocolate and sweet malt, with some very slight hints of vanilla, too. On tasting, the beer has initial flavors of coffee and chocolate riding a light, sharp carbonated body. The coconut is very light and complementary in flavors, and once again vanilla slips itself into the picture. The coffee flavor does well to provide some bitterness to balance all of the sweet flavors. The body also does well to balance, as it is fairly light bodied for a porter, which helps to keep the beer overpowering. Despite the taste and flavors, the beer has a slightly bitter aftertaste, with both chocolate and coffee lingering around in your mouth. The beer is smooth, and very easy to drink. Good porter for when it's not cold out but you still want to drink a porter.","GarthDanielson","Feb 07, 2011"

Sweet creamy scents pull through as well. Mouthfeel is oh so creamy and smooth. This is like velvet. Flavor is a mix of mild cocoa and sourness. Not sure if that's the coconut that is sour, but there is a definite sour presence. I thought this could be like a liquid ""Mounds"" candybar, but not so much. This is more chocolatey IMO. Not bad though. I like it. Recommend.","Onenote81","Oct 26, 2010"

The aroma is most similar to the coffee and chocolate that you would expect from a porter but this, surprise, has a coconut aroma along with some roasted characters and caramel. The taste is actually rather nice. I'm gonna be honest I really don't like coconut as a flavor, but it works really well here. The flavors of coffee and chocolate are there but the nice toasted coconut are pleasant with all of it. There is a slight bitterness in the mouthfeel that isn't really helping as far as I'm concerned, but it is a good carbonation and consistency to help it go down really smooth. It's a very drinkable beer and a pleasant surprise for something I had my reservations about.","Vdubb86","Oct 14, 2010"
4.42,11.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Shared with some friends before racking our homebrew into its secondary fermenter. It pours a matte black-brown, highlighted in ruby, topped by a bit more than half of a finger of light tan foam. The nose comprises dark chocolate, light roasted malts, coconut milk, and a dash of creamy caramel. The taste follows this winning formula, though the chocolate seems to have been calmed down to a milk level and the coconut itself is now present in toasted form. The body is a light medium, with a light carbonation and an airy feel. Overall, a kinda surprisingly good brew (I'm not generally a fan o' coconut, but its presence here is quite welcome), one I wish was more widely available (or, at least, more available to me).","TMoney2591","Oct 14, 2010"
3.8,-4.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a dark cola brown with a dense, foamy head. The aroma is rather mild, with notes of light coffee, a hint of chocolate, and toasted malt. The flavor is largely driven by the robust nuttiness, but it is also quite sweet and has a subtle kiss of the toasted coconut underneath. The texture is smooth and almost creamy, but a bit too thin to support the hearty porter flavors. Overall, it is mild, smooth, and quite pleasant, but it is a bit too thin and a bit too sweet for my liking. The use of coconut is different and interesting, though, and although it could be considered a bit gimmicky for a brewery from Maui, I thought it was a nice touch that made me want to search for this beer.","devilben02","Oct 14, 2010"

Appears almost pitch black when held toward the light the body has dark brown edges, light tan head foms thick and dwindles quickly...even speckled lacing lines the sides of my pint. Aroma has dark chocolate, creamy tones it a hint of toasted coconut even a touch of kona coffee. Flavor is roasty with fresh coffee, dark chocolate, and toasted coconut very interesting flavorful dark beer probably the best I've had in or out of a can. Awesome porter, really nice blend of flavors colliding, mouthfeel is creamy but ballsy with a good bit of acidity going on with mild natural carbonation. Medium to fuller bodied porter wih coffee grounds lying on the palate. Drinkability overall is joyous when of the hyped beers out there that really really lives up to it. Awesome original take on a classic style this one is just a great base porter that the toasted coconut works well with the whole picture.","WVbeergeek","Oct 11, 2010"

Nose is a bit of roasted coconut and some roasted malt. Hints of something semi-astringent and acrid. Taste is quite off. Tastes nearly of stomach acid and is incredibly harsh. Nothing wrong with the can as it was split with a few others who thoroughly enjoyed it. I don't know if it was roasted coconut taken to the extreme or something else, but I could barely swallow the first sip and the second one I couldn't handle. Trying to stay unbiased, the mouthfeel was a bit light, but there wasn't a big issue with it.

Aroma is very mild, dominated by a light coconut sweetness and very little else. Flavor starts with a mild roasty malt flavor, pretty much a non-descript porter and the finish is complemented with a smooth coconut sweetness. Body is a little thin for the style with medium carbonation. This is very balanced and smooth, and the coconut adds a unique dimension to it, but it's lacking in the body and any depth of flavor like some other american porters.

There's a fair amount of chocolate in the nose, sweetness as well, I don't know if that's the coconut I'm getting. Taste is consistent with the smell; coconut is definitely detectable towards the finish. The body isn't too full but the maltiness leaves a semi-dry finish.

Smell is great, semi-sweet chocolate, mild coffee, cream and a touch of black pepper. Taste is equally as impressive. A little slow to come alive in the mouth but once things get started it snowballs from there. Nice bitter/sweet chocolate notes, again a mild amount of coffee grounds, perhaps some vanilla. Good velvety mouthfeel. Dangerously sessionable.","timbro81","Mar 07, 2010"

3.95,-0.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a black-brown, ruby highlight edges and a couple fingers of frothy cocoa colored head that slowly dissolves and leaves a nice thick ring around the glass. The aroma is roasted malt, bitter chocolate and a some toasted coconut. The flavor is dark chocolate, roasted malt and finishes sweet with a little more of the toasted coconut. Its medium bodied with a light amount of carbonation. Nice porter, I like that the coconut is slight which creates a nice complexity to the roasted and chocolate.","DiabolikDUB","Jan 26, 2010"

Nose is also very appetizing with some soft coconut, roasted malt, and a whiff of hop character in the background. On the palate the flavors are a little subdued, with a thin, watery body, and not as much roasty flavors or coconut that the nose suggested I would find. Easy drinking though, but not the beer I expected based on the nose.","yemenmocha","Jan 24, 2010"

4.12,3.8,4,4.5,4,4,4,"D= A very drinkable beer that in my opinion is a B+ porter that gets elevated by its unique coconut aroma. I wish the coconut was stronger in the flavor area, but still a great beer.","spointon","Jan 21, 2010"
3.8,-4.3,4,4,4,3,3.5,"This one pours near black with ruby highlights and a tan head. The aroma is sweet and malty - the coconut is present but not overwhelming, as are other scents of lactose, raisins, cola, and a hint of milk chocolate. The taste that follows is very similar - all chocolate, cola, and coconut with no hop presence. I really appreciate the natural, and not overly done, coconut taste. The carbonation is a bit low - and with such a sweet tasting beer, makes the mouthfeel a bit cloying and coating. Overall though, a unique porter worth seeking out.","DousedInStout","Jan 20, 2010"

Rich aromas of milk chocolate, subtle smoke, roasted coconut shavings, subtle espresso, roasted malts....damn...this beer smells rich, robust, sweet, full, & awesome! This beer is really only 5,70% abv?!? All of the aromas turn into flavors on the palate with an emphasized roast & chocolate character, sweet/syrpuy texture, & long finish. Although this is definitely a dessert beer, this is one that I'm completely enjoying, one that I highly recommend, & one that I'll absolutely buy in the future! A must try in my opinion!","BevMoAndrew","Jan 16, 2010"

4.18,5.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"The palate opens with a combination of dark chocolate and coconut, fairly well balanced, much along the lines of what you'd expect a coconut truffle to taste like minus the richness. Mildly cola-like, I get a little bitterness towards the finish that could be hop-based (it's a little fruity). Mild medium-roast coffee bitterness is present as well. The finish is long with mild chocolate bitterness and some coconut flavor.

Close to black but it's more a very, very dark brown color, minimal difference around the rims. Coconut oil, coffee beans and dark chocolate make a succinct statement in the nose, in no way overpowering, firm maltiness with a pinch of flowers and baking spices. Medium-bodied, fresh and fluid mouth feel combines with a spring water lightness to keep the drinkability high. The bittersweet chocolate and coffee more pronounced than the coconut, the latter toastier here than in the nose. Gentle notes of peat moss or forest scrub to it. Strong carbonation for overall weight, weakens the finish. Not as sweet as you suspect it could have been, very appreciated.","farrago","May 25, 2009"

I have to bring up that aroma again because it is just that good. It truly is amazing and I almost gave it a 5 but lack of diversity kept me from doing so. Still its amazing. It all works and would be better with a slight thicker feel. Just seems it would match the flavors and aroma a bit more. The feel as it is just seems a bit out of place.

In general, porter's are usually a bit too roasty for me so this hits the spot, at least for the style. I could do without the metallic taste. Beer just isn't as good out of a can.

I'm giving it a lower score because I had virtually no head or retention. This was my 3rd and final can, but each one the head, which was a nice mocha color, decipated so quickly and left nothing behind at all. Smell was nice and complex. Some dark chocolate, coffee, caramel, cream, and a bit of coconut...almost like a mounds bar in a glass. Taste was about the same. If I had a better palate I probably could point out 12 unique flavors. The coconut wasnt really present so much. It was virtually undetectable when the beer was a colder, but it came out (subtley) as it warmed. A creamy, dark chocolate, dark caramel, and the slightest touch of bitterness all blend together wonderfully. Mouthfeel was much heavier than expected. While I didnt mind it there is a very oily sensation left behind that seemed to be too much for me. Overall a very good Porter and easily drinkable beer. While the coconut wasnt there as much as I thought, the slight presence was nice and a little different.","bunnyhustle","Jan 02, 2009"

Very nice aroma of with thick roasted malts and chocolate and cocoa. Vanilla too and toasted nuts. the first thing I notice is the light body this porter has. It's light to light-medium on the viscosity meter. Too low in my opinion. Carbonation is appropriate. The toasted coconut is apparent on the buds.

There is not as prevalent a flavor of coconut, but there is subtle hints (which in my opinion is better). I was not expecting much from this brew, but was very impressed.

Oh well, a reason to go visit!","WJVII","Mar 24, 2008"

4.32,8.8,4,4.5,4,5,4.5,"HUGE thanks to fordest for this one. I was lucky to find somebody with one, and he came through big with his final one for me! Black pour, with a nicely lasting attractive brown head. Smell is a delicious sweet roasty creaminess at first reminding me of a good oatmeal stout. As it opens I think I can detect a tiny hint of coconut in the nose, and it comes off just a hint plasticy for a while, but not offensively so. Taste...Exceptionally smooth, creamy, slightly sweet and roasted with a noticeable, and perfectly highlighted toasted coconut flake flavor in the finish. Very nice! Full bodied, slightly thick, flavorful, and all around a very enjoyable beer that I wish I could get more readily... Just what I hoped it'd be, and easily one of my favorites. Worth getting if you have the chance!","JDV","Feb 24, 2008"
4.25,7.1,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"This beer has a dark brown almost opaque appearance that pours with a small tan head. The aroma of the beer is a mix of chocolate and coffee as well as a few slight tart characteristics. The mouth feel is enjoyable with a smooth finish that complements the chocolate and malt tastes of this fine porter. The drink-ability was another plus of this beer that I hope to stumble upon on many more occasions.","StonePhil","Feb 04, 2008"
4.6,15.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours a nice dark color out of the can and into the glass. There is a pleasantly large, slightly off white, foamy head, which lasts. The smell is a nice mixture of coffee, with slight hints of coconut. A very enjoyable taste, coffee, with a coconut finish. A very nice beer that I would certainly drink again and recommend. Enjoy!","BadBadger","Jan 29, 2008"
4.32,8.8,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a thin black with a one finger light khaki colored head that quickly dies down to a small layer of bubbles. Stickiness is minimal at best. Smell is a perfect combination of coconut and chocolate malt. Smokey barley with a carmelized sweetness in the nose as well. A mild earthy hop aroma makes its presence known. Charred wood flavor up front followed by an artificial coconut milk. Barley and cocoa powder make up the aftertaste. Milky medium bodied texture in the mouth, fits quite well. Soft carbonation coats throughout. There have only been a few porters that I have enjoyed, this one definitely fits in to that category. So glad I had the opportunity to try this one. Thanks again wetherel!","BeerTruth","Jan 27, 2008"
3.57,-10.1,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Drinkability- Cut down the carbonation and mix the flavors a bit better and you have a winning beer. As is, just ok. Would have again though if in Hawaii as there really isn't much choice.","GClarkage","Jan 19, 2008"
4.69,18.1,3.5,4.5,5,4,5,"Delicate, yet complex. Truly phenomenal. Add some caramelly oxidation from time in my cellar and this beer would be a masterpiece.","mentor","Nov 30, 2007"

3.97,0,3.5,4,4.5,3,3.5,"Poured from an attractively decorated can into a standard pint glass. A thinnish coffee-cream tan head laced the glass for the duration. Very dark brown to black in color, with only a small blood-red orb appearing through the darkness when held up to the Hawaiian sun. Aromas of intense toasted coconut, and milk and dark chocolates. Flavors of leathery hops hit the palate first, followed by mounds of toasted as well as burnt coconut, baker's chocolate, coffee with cream, and hints of black licorice, ending on a slight sour cherry note. What a great concept for a porter. Well done!","jletts","Nov 25, 2007"

4.08,2.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"My parents brought me a six pack of Maui Brewing's beers from a recent trip. The beer pours a deep mostly opaque black with a nice brownish head. The aroma is tons of rich sweet chocolate, a damp hoppiness and plenty of coconut. The flavor is very similar, starting off with sweet chocolate, caramel and roasted malts, then drifting into the coconut flavor that lingers in the aftertaste. As I drink the beer the coconut flavor seems to fade a bit in intensity. There is a nice light astringency that goes well with the dark malty flavor.","ericj551","Oct 22, 2007"
3.88,-2.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours black but if you inspect it it's actually a coca cola clear brown liquid.. The head is a medium tan bubbly thing that isn't too impressive. The smell is roasty first and foremost. I can also detect a sweetness, not really sugary but more like a cream sweetness. The taste is pretty roasty. At first you don't get much other than the roast but there is also a sweetness in there to balance it. The coconut that comes through is mostly in the aftertaste, and it's pretty mild. As it warms up the beer becomes really smooth and less roasty. Drinking this beer doesn't really make me think of coconuts, so I wouldn't say that flavor is overpowering. It's just a nice sweeter porter, but less of the chocolate sweet of maybe a Black Butte and more of a dairy sweet.","MiScusi","Oct 20, 2007"
4.17,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Thick and creamy decadent mouthfeel. The coconut melds so perfectly with the porter it's a match made in heavan. Chewy coconut flavors with chocolate undertones and a hint of blackberry. More dark grains just make this a wonderful experience and an easy drinking masterpiece.","mcallister","Oct 16, 2007"

4.42,11.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I only got a 4 ounce taster of this at the stone 11th anniversary festival so I will do my best. It poured from a can with a dark chocolate color standard of any porter. The cocunut really came through the roasted dark malt in the smell which was a huge plus. It tasted very roasty and nutty and the cocunut was not over powering but just right. It was medium on the mouthfeel, not an extremely viscous porter which was nice on the hot day. Extremely drinkable even for those who may not be in to porters. I definitely want to get my hands on some of this beer.","epearson","Sep 12, 2007"

3.55,-10.6,3.5,3.5,4,3,3,"On another note, Maui Brewing Co. is pioneering what they call the ""Micro-Canning Revolution," denouncing previously held myths about canning premium beer. The revolutionary packaging method would be a total hit in the coastal areas of the US, especially San Diego. There is a growing majority of premium-beer connoisseurs who would like to have a canned option to enjoy beachside or poolside during the summer. I hope more breweries follow this trend in the future. I NEED better beer to drink at the beach!","domtronzero","Aug 17, 2007"
4.2,5.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I quite enjoyed this. A unique porter, and one that worked surprisingly well. Highly recommended for at least a try. I suppose the body could be slightly stronger for me to really love this beer, but it's also about par for the style.","rallison","Jul 25, 2007"
