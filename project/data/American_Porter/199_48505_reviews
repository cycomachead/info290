"Smells like a prairie Bomb. It tastes pretty damn good. Smooth like a porter but the burn of an imperial stout with a hint of vanilla. Only issue is that the carbonation is low"

"Strong alcohol after taste beer"
""
"S: vanilla, coffee, cocoa. F: strong vanilla, cocoa nibs, coffee. F: medium heavy, but not syrupy. Light sweetness to start, pleasant bitter finish with vanilla as the strongest flavor. Could drink this as a house beer."

"Great color and pours a nice head from the tap. Tastes very bitter and not smooth at all."
""
"A bit to harsh and burnt in the coffee flavor for me, couldn't really detect any vanilla."

"So much coffee and vanilla I find that no beers can stand up to this mighty example. Will ruin your taste buds though to other coffee stouts, it will spoil you silly (my only complaint)."
""
""
""
"Taste is chocolate and coffee following nose. Smooth and clean taste lingering coffee bitterness, chocolate flavors are smooth and sweet. Well balanced. A truly lovely experience."

"O: A great porter that highlights both coffee and vanilla. All components go very well together (roast, coffee, vanilla, dark chocolate) and really make this a nice treat. Alcohol goes completely under the radar, which is impressive for 10%. Definitely worth picking some up if you're a fan of either coffee or vanilla beers"
""
""
""
"If you like a porter with a bit of a spicy bite and a ton of balance, pick this sucker up and enjoy it!"
""
"On tap at the Salty Pig.  This was such a big tasting bomb of a porter - amazing stuff.  Enjoyed it while I listened to my buddy John talked about his match.com dates as of late.  Made me wonder why someone doesn't order a 12 pack of these for a 1st date.  6 each of these bad guys, and everyone will be in love.  Anyways.....great beer.  Wonder why Beer Advocate doesn't offer a dating website on the side.  This could not fail..."
"Overall: It's an excellent porter. I didn't get any vanilla presence in this beer at all which was disappointing, but ignoring the lack of vanilla still makes it a great coffee porter. I would recommend it and I would pick it up again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-i knew this was going to be a good brew based on reputation and I wasn't disappointed. Seek it out!"
"Weak, this was not but when you're celebrating a ""victory at sea", weak won't cut it. The bread in this beer's head was repeated in the aftertaste as hints of pumpernickel could be found after the liquid went down, owing to the strength of this beer's body and subtle spice. Porters don't come around like this that often so if you can find it, get it. It's not for the faint of heart but there's enough out there that is and who are you kidding - you know you want to find something this well-crafted and savor every last drop of it. On par with the Sculpin IPA's, Ballast Point has a winner here that deserves the lofty rating it has received here on Beeradvocate."
""
"Not a big stout or porter drinker.. Lots of flavors going on and as it got warmer(took me awhile to drink it) it got easier to drink.. Definitely try it agian."
"Overall: A pretty delicious brew - the coffee is really well integrated with the beer and adds an earthiness to the otherwise sweet malty body. Hops is just enough to balance in the finish. Great balance and nice presentation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I feel this beer is somewhat overrated. It's all coffee, all the time. It doesn't have any balance. It completely drowns out the more interesting notes, and doesn't even really taste like beer. A small taste might be enjoyable from time to time, but that's it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had better Examples of this style"
""
""
""
""
"Now that it comes in 6 packs, that's a game changer."
"Overall- very very well balanced. Taste more coffee than you smell. Nice warming alcohol on the finish. A must try porter"
""
""
""
"Big coffee taste and then finishes with vanilla to take the edge off the bitterness of the coffee. Great coffee stout, right there with FBS."
""
"A big beer that is easy to drink (assuming you like coffee, which, let's face it, if you ordered this one up knowing you didn't like coffee you might not be the smartest person  in the world).  It's smell is intoxicating and its notes of coffee and vanilla are strong but not overpowering.  You'll never forget this is a beer at its base, but it's one that is unique in its genre."
""
""
""
"This is definitely one of my favorite beers of all time. In my opinion, it's the best example of an Imperial Vanilla Porter I've ever had. It balances all the elements just right, so it's never too roasty, too sweet, or too bitter, but rather is all things at once. A delicious, interesting beer that any dark beer fan should love"
""
""
""
""
"So first of all, this beer looks amazing. The fact that it isn't a stout is shocking because, well it looks like a stout. Smells great too, but once again when I get to the tasting a vanilla porter has let me down. A big chocolatey porter with coffee and a hint of vanilla sounds incredible but the end result is merely good, not great. It didn't leave me with the same feeling of meh that the Breckenridge variety does, but it also isn't anything I'll find myself craving any time soon."
""
""
""
"O: This is an absolutely beautiful beer. The flavors are so well-balanced and are highlighted by a decadent mouthfeel that keeps you salivating for more. The coffee notes aren't overwhelming, but provide an essential bitterness that cuts through the vanilla and malty sweetness. An absolute must-have if you find yourself in Ballast Point's  distribution area."
""
"Overall: Big Wow factor, big flavor, heady alcohol, brute strength meets complexity with vanilla, coffee, malt, hops, and alcohol all taking turns crushing it. Big yum, seek, buy, ... more."
""
""
""
""
"This is obviously really good. But, like too many porters, Baltic-strength or not, it suffers from one-and-done syndrome -- as in, first-sip awesomeness, but then a steep, steep dropoff in quality in every subsequent sip."
""
"For a highly available imperial porter, this is a great option if you're in the distro range. Definitely would buy again. Prefer over FBS."
""
"Lovely monster. Appearance is a large tan, slow to settle, thick head with lots of lace and and opaque black brown color. Aroma is coffee, vanilla, roast malt, leather, black earth, dank forest, cement. Flavor's similar to nose, fairly dry, just enough tang and bitter to balance and then a hint of sweet in the finish. Body is just right. Long finish. Nary a hint of strength."
""
""
"Very excellent smell/feel...I may have let it warm to far...still very solid"
"Coffee flavor is strong; vanilla less so. That's a porter for you. (I guess the vanilla takes the edge off the coffee a bit.)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a black with a thick brown head. Immediately smell the coffee and chocolate. The taste is coffee initially with a smooth finish. I could only have about one of these a night but enjoy every single second of it. Really glad I bought it before they sold out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"enjoyed the coffee notes, bitterness balanced, faint vanilla...average viscosity...might buy again but not obsessively"
""
""
""
""
""
"maybe i was tricked about this beer due to the fan hype, and notoriety.  The first sip was virtually off-putting. I must admin it got better from there. They claim it has ""just the right amount of sweetness"". Thats my major problem with it. Its a malt pit. Not cool. Love porters. Love imperials. Not this one."
""
""
""
""
"Flavours include more vanilla and a fair bit of sweet malt. A fair whack of coffee too."
"Lots of dark chocolate & cacao riding the wave of toasted coffee, but evened out by the semi-sweet vanilla bean.  Finishes pretty bitter, but in a good way.  Velvety smooth and creamy feel.  Reminiscent of Founder's Breakfast Stout, whuch is to say an excellent coffee brew."
""
""
""
"The Navy Goat Loves Victory at Sea!!  This is a 100 in my book !!"
""
""
"one of the best coffee porters I have had! its very smooth and balanced! the vanilla note at the very end is kinda perfect! wonderful beer!"
""
""
""
""
"Very good flavor but very strong, a bit more than I expected even with its alcohol content"
""
""
""
"Overall:  A fantastic beer.  A peer of Founders Breakfast Stout, and the best thing called a ""porter"" that I've ever had."
""
""
"Burnt flavor on nose and taste. I did not detect much vanilla or coffee notes. Not a fan"
""
""
"Overall excellent,  disappointed I didn't purchase more when I had the chance."
""
"This one was really good and the nose was really nice. I got nice notes of vanilla and chocolate, but I think this is best when aged. It didn't see very balanced today with the bitterness on the backend. I have a few more to age a little longer, and I think it will be spectacular with more time."
""
""
""
""
"The body is an incredibly dark brown, nearly black, with a nice light brown head that has good retention and leaves nice tight sticky lacing. The aroma is rich with coffee and just a hint of the vanilla adding some counterbalance. The taste is a little dialed back from the aroma but with the same characteristics. The body is nicely weighted on the palate with a nice full smooth finish."
"Overall - Had many times before, always a lovely beer.  I wish the taste was as pronounced as the nose, the more nuanced flavors are covered a bit by the bitterness, but still, a great beer.  4.5 paws."
""
""
""
""
"Absolutely amazing! Can't ask for a better beer."
"Poured a dark color like a stout but with a brown hue to it. While pouring I got a heavy aroma of spices. The initial taste had the same spices but then mellowed out with a burnt coffee taste and a hint of vanilla to finish it off. It also has a nice bitter aftertaste and a feel of dryness. After a few minutes of drinking this beer, the aftertaste might be a bit more than I'd like but overall a damn good beer."
""
""
"Picked up a growler.  This is tasty. Creamy, chocolaty, with  a nice finish of vanilla. Goes down real smooth. Alcohol is well hidden. Just screams dessert to me. May have to pick up a German chocolate cake or some vanilla bean ice cream. Definitely would buy a case of the sixers if they ever came to town."
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle poured in a snifter.  10% very subtle, and smooth.  Lingering coffee aftertaste.  A unique beer, very enjoyable.  Glad I finally got to try it."
""
""
"Beautiful dark mocha head sits on black. Fantastic coffee note. Flavor-wise, this is smooth, flavorful, and robust. Creme brulee undertone.The coffee note is not acidic and the body is creamy and full. Sweet but not cloying. Amazing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sign me up for a case in the not too distant future. This may well be my breakfast stout substitute."
"Absolutely delicious! A beer where the whole (overall rating) is greater than the sum of it's parts."
""
"Aggressive malty intro, sweet caramely finish."
"Overall: Breakfast Stout lovers, this could be the competition. While not an oatmeal stout, this beer has numerous comparisons to Breakfast Stout, with the addition of vanilla. Although I'm not a vanilla lover, this Porter was delightfully balanced in flavor. Ballast Point is becoming my go-to for stouts/porters. Grab some before the season is over!"
""
""
""
""
"Unbelievably amount of flavor. The vanilla really stands out and the coffee compliments is perfectly. This beer could easily stand toe-to-toe with Founder's Breakfast Stout."
""
"Literally the best beer I have tasted yet. Mind is blown. Everyone needs to try it."
"Needs more vanilla mixed with the coffee"
""

"Poured into snifter from 22 oz. bottle. Very impressive head and lacing. Body of this imperial porter stands up against, and is even more robust than, some imperial stouts. Vanilla is the first taste, with the coffee bitterness detectable on the way down. I'm not too crazy about vanilla porters/stouts, but this is objectively a high quality beer, and if you like vanilla, you'll  no doubt like this."

"Pours nice, super dark with a small tan head. Smell for me is overwhelmingly coffee, a tad sweetish. Taste: coffee coffee coffee. I love coffee, roast at home and drink every day, but that is all I taste in this beer. I would have loved more dark malt taste, for a balance. But perhaps that is why this is classified as a porter rather than a stout. Mouthfeel is great, nice carb, a bit on the thin side but not in a bad way. Overall, I can see why people like this beer but just not my cup of joe for the reasons stated."
""
""
"Great beer! HUDGE coffee, chocolate, vanilla notes! And for 10% abv very smooth!"
"Overall, this is a great beer, and it damn near lives up to the expectations I had for it.  I will definitely not miss an opportunity to buy it again in the future!"
""
"Cheers to Ballast Point for moving this from the 22 oz. format to six-packs. Hopefully more breweries will follow suit!"
""
"Great for the price (or almost twice the price) at 2.72/ bottle."
"I could get all technical with my rating. There is a fine line between porters and stouts. This is one of them. All I can say is this beer is absolutely fantastic."
""
""
"Not bad. Coffee and vanilla notes present. Mor vanilla than coffee. Wouldn't turn down a free one."
""
"Kind of disappointed with this one. It was good but not as incredible as I was lead to believe. Extremely boozy taste. Covered up all the other flavors for me. Judging by the aroma I was expecting to love this stuff. Smells heavenly and looks dynamite. Maybe it was something I had eaten before that had paired wrong, but I really tasted too much alcohol. I will try it again some day and maybe have a different opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
"Phenomenal porter. A tad on the toasty side but the coffee and vanilla really really shine in this one, especially in the aftertaste. Perfect for a snow day!"
"Way too ash/roasty for me.  No sweetness at all.  Just ashy and bitter finish.  Ok, but not my style preference for a big porter/stout.  I really don't understand the high ratings for this one at all."
""
""
"Amazing. Tastes a bit like chocolate milk."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Absolutely delicious beer. It is very flavorful and tastes exactly as advertised. One definitely doesn't have to look for the coffee and vanilla. Both are huge in the nose AND the taste. If this was a limited bottle, people would line up for it."
""
""
"This is a bit rough for me.....very strong on the coffee and I really do not get a lot of vanilla.  The look is very nice...dark, ecru head that is lacing.  Scent and taste are dominated by coffee.  The mouthfeel is not as creamy or full as I would prefer.  Overall its decent....but no where near the best porter I have had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"amazing beer.  BP never disappoints but this may be their best."
"This might be my favorite non barrel aged porter/stout. So effin good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle.  Dark in color, close to black, with dark tan head.  Vanilla was lead aroma followed by some coffee, but coffee was the more dominant taste.  The vanilla showed up more in taste as the beer warmed, but this is first and foremost a coffee porter, with a slight manageable bitterness.  Smooth, some creaminess, closer to medium than thin.  Started this at 48 degrees, maybe we should have started warmer given the alcohol content?  A good beer, but honestly, my expectations were higher based on BA and RB ratings.  Given the flavor profile, I think I'd rather have a stout.  If I want a big alcohol porter, I'd go with something along the line of Black Butte XXV."
""
""
""
"O: This packs a punch! 10 ABV is no joke and this brew hides it well. Great coffee and vanilla flavors. One of my new favorite Porters."
""
"Wow!  This is my first time drinking this and it blows every other porter I've had out of the water!  It looks like a stout and has an unbelievably rich taste.  The coffee and vanilla really compliment each other in this one.  I will definitely have to try this one again.  Poured from a 22oz. bomber into a tulip glass."
""
""
"Probably one of the best all around porters I have ever had!"
""
"awesome brew"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Hints of vanilla and coffee, nice roasted taste"
""
"4.12/5: A vanilla lover's delight"
""
"Vanilla, mocha and chocolate it's roasted malty goodness in a cup."
""
"Hello!  TRIA Rittenhouse has this on tap. Great pour with 1/2 inch head in the tall stem tulip glass. Quick swirl and the head reappears. Close your eyes and remember when your Grandma put an extra drop or two of vanilla in whatever she was baking. That is this porter. I love you, Grandma."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a fantastic ""Imperial Porter."" Thick and deliciously syrupy, this has the flavour of a stout. The chocolate and vanilla seems like they may be too sweet at the beginning of each sip, but are so wonderfully balanced by coffee and roasted malt acidity/salinity that you would have a hard time pinning this beer at 10% ABV."
""
"The coffee was very strong and front and center without being overpowering. The vanilla added a nice sweet compliment as sometimes coffee beers will taste like nothing but coffee. The booze was noticeable but smooth. I look forward to drinking this again."
""
""
""
""
""
"All fun aside...this is one of the best out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very nice porter, the aromas are fantastic but had me overly ecstatic for the beer. Great coffee flavors despite not getting too much vanilla. Overall a very good coffee porter."
""
""
""
""
"Delicious! If you love stouts you will thoroughly enjoy this one. Drink this at a warmer temp, a guy told me 55 degrees so I just let it sit for 45 minutes (after refrigeration). It has a delicious taste, smooth on the pallet, and had a feel that warms the soul; close your eyes next sip if you don't believe me. Can't find a flaw in the taste, color, nor feel. Great beer, new personal favorite!"
"STRONG coffee flavor. Really well done in my opinion"
""
""
"2015 - Pours a very dark brown to black color with a huge three finger tannish head.  There is quite a bit of lacing.  The aroma is huge, coffee, roasted malts, bitter chocolate, vanilla, nutty, creamy, cinnamon, nutmeg.  The taste up front is creamy vanilla, coffee, toffee, bitter chocolate, roasted malts, bitter dry on the back end."
""
"The dark guys like it dark"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer! Pours dark with a tan head. Smells like roasted coffee with a little bit of sweetness. This beer has all of the great taste of coffee without too much bitterness. You can taste that it has been roasted well. Coffee is up front but you can catch the vanilla too. Well balanced. Not overly watered down like lots of porters. Damn good beer."
""
""
""
"What a great beer.  As good as any porter I've had.  A nice hint of vanilla with a rich coffee flavor. Highly recommend for anyone who likes porters or stouts."
""
"O: BP Victory at Sea Coffee Vanilla IMperial Porter is a stellar beer that I think has a few small fixes that could turn this into a very top-tier beer. I am very glad to have had the chance to try it, and do not overlook this beer -- it is special and still has potential."
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown with ruby edges.  Both roasted malt and roasted coffee notes can be found in the nose.  Roasted malts are present in the flavor but they take a back seat to the almost burnt coffee flavor that is center stage.  I’m not really getting any vanilla at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well made I'm just not a fan of this flavor and I love porters. This one is just like drinking a cup of coffee but it has a beer taste to it"
""
""
"Overall: Just an outstanding brew, really like the coffee and vanilla combination."
"Overall:  I could swear this beer is bourbon barrel aged, but according to the description, it is the infused vanilla beans that give that impression.  Big and bold, sweet and tasty.  Very good!"
""
"Good beer but not impressed with the coffee"
""
"Rich creamy heavy coffee coco flavor."
""
"Pretty intense for a porter, this sets the bar a bit higher since the roasted elements and burnt coffee are just so strong that this brew commands respect and forces you to throttle back and drink it slower. Extremely enjoyable overall this is worthy of all the praise and a beer I will certainly seek out again. Any coffee beer fan out there should hunt down a bottle of this, it’s that good."

"2011 or ’12 vintage bomber pulled from the Seal Beach Beachwood BBQ cellar. Thanks to Vito for knowing this was in stock when talking trade. Poured into a tulip. Appearance is deep opaque black with a tall tan head that eaves some patches of lace. We debated which aromas/flavors might have faded in aging and were pleasantly surprised immediately after we started. Aroma is coffee-powered with roast malt, some cocoa, and vanilla (which we though may have faded most, but was still holding its own). No astringency or strong booziness to indicate the 10% abv. Taste is off the charts, like a delicately carbonated vanilla frappuccino. Full bodied, creamy, thick, and filling texture, soft carbonation, a touch of heat and bitterness underlie a sweet finish."

"I waited to try this for awhile and I was not disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a solid beer. Definitely a go to dessert beer with strong notes of coffee and vanilla. It finishes to good."
""
""
""
"Love the bitter coffee, vanilla, and tar tastes and smells. You can't tell the alcohol at first, but it does warm up and start to kick in later. With just a tad more sweetness, it would be phenomenal. Delicious anyway."
""
""
""
""
""
"Dangerously smooth and drinkable at 10%."
""
""
""
""

"Pours a thick black color. Excellent tan head reducing to very good lacing. Perfect tan ring around the edge. Carbonation hard to see. The body is near solid black even when held up to light. Smells of vanilla ice cream shake, African coffee, caramel, and chocolate. On the nose, very sweet. Lots of sugars. Strong vanilla bean ice cream taste. Some chocolate and minor bitters. Overwhelming vanilla dilutes barley and biscuit notes inhibiting the overall flavor profile. This continues mid-palate where there is a bit more heavy cream coffee, but not enough to overwhelm the sweetness. I would like to see more porter notes. Maybe some bitter cocoa or malt. More balance to the coffee and less half & half. Instead the back palate and after taste are all vanilla milkshake with some coffee ice cream. It's almost sickening to the stomach. No real alcohol notes, but that's just because everything is overwhelmed by vanilla. I really think if they dialed back the vanilla the flavor profile would be extremely good, but as it is-- I cannot get beyond all that sweetness. It is just too much and really kills what could be an otherwise excellent porter if they'd let the rest of the flavors come through. I tried it cold. I drank it slightly chilled. I tried it near room temp. No difference. No change. Disappointing. 3.5 out of 5."

"O: I'm kicking myself for waiting so long to try this one, I'm hooked after my first bottle."
"Overall:  I feel very fortunate to try a single bottle of this much sought-after brew.  I like it.  Now, I can cross it off my list.  Calling me a ticker?  Fine, I’ll walk the plank."
"Will revisit."

"Glad to have Ballast Point here in the Badger State. Enjoyed this brew at cellar temp. Served in a FFF Teku glass. A dark brown color with a mocha head that settles quickly to a collar. The aroma is a huge blast of fresh ground coffee. It was reminiscent of Big Bad Baptist. If you enjoy coffee, you will love this beer. The flavor is also very coffee forward. A wonderful blend of bitterness, with a kiss of of vanilla bean and caramel sweetness. The 10% ABV is amazingly well hidden. The mouthfeel is that of an easy drinking medium bodied brew. Slightly dry coffee ground finish. Overall, this is a world class Porter. I'd gladly recommend this brew."
""
""
""

"Dark brown with a diminishing tan head and heavy lace. Big aromas of coffee and dark roasted malt. Light sweet start leading to coffee/espresso. Mild vanilla and hint of oak. Light lactose in the finish. Linger is fairly dry with a hint of bitterness.  If you like strong coffee you should really like this one. Fairly smooth and a bit sticky at times."
""
"Pours a dark jet black with a mocha head that leaves a nice amount of lacing on the glass.  Smells like a strong coffee with a hint of vanilla.  Tastes like a strong coffee with a bit more vanilla.  Mouthfeel is a bitter coffee taste, but not over the top. Alcohol is well hidden. I'll get more of this."

"Pours a rich looking dark brown with a massive creamy light brown head that spilled over. (My bad. I poured a little too fast) Thick foamy lacing persists. Great complex aroma of dark sugars, roasted malts, coffee, caramel, raisins and nut cake. Taste of sweet roasted malts with a slightly dry bitter sweet and slight alcohol finish. As the bottle indicates, other strong flavors are coffee and vanilla extract. Feel is full bodied, hearty and robust. Minimal carbonation helps keep the flavors intact and makes this a great brew to warm you in the winter and/or drink with dessert. A thoroughly enjoyable brew and one of my favorite examples of porter!"

"O  So good! The flavors mesh perfectly. You want a coffee stout/porter? This is it. You want a smooth sweet stout/porter? Yep. You want a big rich, high ABV impeccably crafted brew? This it. Top notch brew by Ballast Point!"
"I'm picky as hell so take the above advice with a grain of salt. I enjoyed this beer. A lot. Just being brutally honest with this review. The only reason it will not be a repeat buy is the cost at $15 for a sixer. It was truly one of the best porters I've ever had. I just wish the flaws mentioned were worked on."

"Amazing deep coffee flavor. One of the best stouts I've had."
""
"This will not surprise you, it's exactly what it says on the label, ""porter with coffee and vanilla"". But it's incredibly rich and balanced, one element compensating the other. So it seems that Ballast Point don't make just great IPAs, but also one of the best porters out there. Especially considering it's quite easy to get."

"Overall / Drinkability:  An imperial porter indeed!  I've had Russian Imperial Stouts that were not this strong in flavor and aroma before.  Probably if I had not seen that this was listed as a porter I would not have guessed it was that style.  All that aside, the depth and strength of the coffee and vanilla are just right - very strong to stick out, but not so strong as to be overpowering.  Rich, but not cloying.  Dangerously drinkable as the alcohol is well hidden, and yet I can feel this creeping up on me after half the glass, so I know better to not have another 12oz bottle, but I really wish I ""had to finish a bomber because I can't recap it"" sort of problem right now.  Well done and I can see why so many people rate this so high.  I would bet this beer would go well with a wide range of desserts, but it does work well as an after-dinner sipping beer as if it was its own dessert."
"Overall, a very nice coffee porter with nice chocolate and vanilla notes."

"EDIT: Hmmm, way heavier on the coffee the second time. Not as impressed. I am going to try cellaring it to mellow the coffee and bring up the vanilla."
""
"Very glad this is now packaged in 6 packs of 12 oz. bottles for $15 ( I was eyeballing the $10  bomber for 2 years). The ratings seem a bit hyped, but I must admit, Ballast Point certainly has created a good tasting Imperial Porter whatever shortcomings it may have. Victory At Sea is a terrific Winter warmer, and I definitely recommend trying it."
""
""
""
""
"Smell is great. Up-front aspects are perfect but maybe lacks sublime savory -ness on the warm side. Great beer I'm not worthy to judge. Ballast Point has gone from overrated/priced   to best brewery going all the sudden for me here in VA."
"Inspired and lovely beer, the vanilla, while ever present, was in a supporting role and I thought the overall composition reflected well, too create a porter that was neither cloying nor overtly alcoholic, great tact indeed to combine the many flavours at play into such a robust, aggressive and also balanced brew. I did find I was slightly more blown away by the aroma though, but this is a seriously impressive beer."

"This one gives you everything you want in a coffee porter. Not too thick, not too sweet, nice hoppy coffee bitterness."
"I've been looking for this for a while now, and finally tried it. Surpassed expectations. Maybe my second favorite porter behind Everett."
"Overall:  This is another awesome porter, and now I see why it is in such high regard.  I love the creamy mouthfeel as well as the great balance between the vanilla/caramel-like sweetness and the roasted coffee bitterness.  Absolutely delicious!  I’m definitely having my West Coast contacts get me a few more bottles next year!"

"Not my favorite flavor profile, but it's a decent beer. Smooth mouthfeel and rich, but more bitter in the finish than I'd prefer."
"22oz bottle pour. Phenomenal - from the first sniff to the last sip. Big notes of roasted chocolate and huge swathes of vanilla pervade the nose and the taste. Beautiful tan foam head on the pour, with a medium body and mouthfeel. This is stellar. The coffee notes are not acrid at all - but provide a good dose of body and kick to this imperial porter. Booze is hidden at 10% - goes down almost too well here. This is a beer I have had my eye on for a while and it was worth the wait."
""
"Black in appearance. Frothy white head.  Smells like a beer ashtray,  didn't care for that.  Tastes is full and very good.  Vanilla notes and a nice roasted coffee backbone. Texture like a silk pie."

"Beautiful opaque black pour with a rich fluffy dark tan head that holds up well.  Coffee, milk chocolate and little else on the nose.  The flavor brings milk chocolate covered roast coffee beans to mind.  Just a hint of alcohol on the finish.  Mouth feel is chewy.  Great beer."

"A dark crimson pour with generous head and visible carbonation. Huge vanilla smell, together with coffee, chocolate, cocoa and caramel. The taste is quite complex and perfectly balanced, with vanilla up front, followed by coffee, alcohol spiciness and malt sweetness blended together with a soft bitterness. The soft carbonation makes for a very nice mouth-feel. Medium-dry finish with a strong vanilla feel that lasts on the palate. One of the best porters around, and I am quite picky about my porters."

""
"Overall, this is an amazing beer.  I may be making a mistake by drinking this bomber by myself, but nobody else here wants any, and I'm sure as hell not going to waste it!"
""

"Looks gorgeous in the glass, jet black with nice head. Smells like you just walked into a coffee shop. Tastes like a wonderful cup of coffee with a hint of creamy vanilla. Overall just a wonderful beer!"
"O-I'm not sure that I totally enjoyed the flavor profile of this beer, but it is incredibly well-made and unique. The layers of flavors are impressive and I would never believe that it was 10-point-whatever ABV by tasting it. The look and feel also score quite high."
"That is what I call an awesome porter. Goes really well with cookies. Love the vanilla flavor. My favorite porter. Its better than great lakes than Edmund Fitz, Founders porter, Deschutes black butte, and stone smoked porter."
"Had this fresh in the beginning of December, and burnt coffee is extremely dominant in both the smell and taste; amazing if that's your thing.  Hints of vanilla and subtle chocolate  as well.  The nose of coffee is just so dominant it's hard to get past.  I plan on aging 2 or 3 and will revisit this review once aged a year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've had this fairly fresh and I've aged it to about 9 months to tone down the coffee.  Fresh, it's a really above average porter that is very coffee forward.  This review is more for the one that was about 9 months old where I thought it was incredibly complex and the coffee didn't dominate everything so much (for me).  With a bit of age on it, it became one of best porter/stouts I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
"Well balanced overall, but a little heavy on the coffee in aroma and taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am a sucker for big, roasty, bold, dark beers and this one hits every damn one of those characteristics, and with full force. I am an avid coffee lover, and the strong coffee and hints of vanilla just add to the deliciousness and complexity of this brew. If I had a couple, I'd definitely try one of these with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream plopped into the glass. Would make for a perfect beer float. I honestly can't find anything that is wrong with this one (and I honestly tried to find something) so that is the reason I gave this a 5."

""
""
""
"A deep, rich, and fully satisfying porter, chock-full of dark grain goodness and sweet malt sugar and vanilla character. A must-try example of an imperial styled porter..."
""
""
"A delicious coffee-vanilla bomb that hides 10% dangerously well. Only drawback, if you even want to call it that, is a fairly thin mouth feel, but if it was any thicker, they'd call it a stout and charge twice the price, so I'm okay with it."

"Was lucky enough to visit Ballast Point tasting room in Little Italy and had this along with 2 BA versions, all excellent beers.  Liked it enough to include in my SD beers to be shipped home package, definitely recommend trying."
""
"Had first out of 22oz bomber; most recently on draft. I'm not generally a big porter fan, but this one was good - and even better on draft. Poured black with finger of creamy head. Scent was pronounced coffee and vanilla with chocolate, and taste was same with an interesting, smoky finish. I would compare to a chocolate-covered coffee bean. Delicious. Bottled version finished a lot dryer than I would have preferred, but draft version was smooth and pleasant."

"Thick murky coffee beer with a fatty porter body and ice cream, vallina hints."
""
""
"Definitely a lot of coffee, but not so much vanilla. Plus it will knock you on your but too."
""
"CHEERS!"
""
"Pours dark as a starless night with an excellent massive head. Lacing and retention are also excellent. Nice nose of sweet dark chocolate over coffee with strong vanilla notes. Medium body with a slick texture that has creamy aspects, but is not quite there. Above average carbonation with effervescence present from the middle on. The flavor profile is simply a masterpiece - intense, complex and balanced. It begins with a rush of sweet dark chocolate that highlights the vanilla aspects but also has a distinctive caramel presence. As the sweetness fades, coffee becomes evident and the vanilla becomes more note like and the caramel is most noted. The middle is the only detection of roast I encountered, and it is buttressed by hop flavor (rind like) and bitterness. A combination of alcohol, hops and coffee yield a nice puckering effect. The finish is quite smooth and lingers with an abundance of all the previous flavors. It is the most complex finish I’ve had the privilege to experience. The finish is where the 10% alcohol becomes evident as a very slight nice burn at the back of the throat. This one is World Class, the best porter I’ve ever had and it’s rating is second to only FBS. IMHO, this is the best porter in the world."
""
""
""
"O: One of my old favorites that I guess I don't enjoy as much as I used to. First few sips are great, as I really savored the rich coffee-forward aroma and the hint of vanilla that emerged. But after awhile the vanilla aroma and flavors disappear into a solid, but pretty standard, roasty-chocolatey-coffee porter."
""
"Overall: Love this beer, it's high up there on my list, it has everything I love about a beer, big coffee, roasted, chocolate flavors, a very nice sweetness from the vanilla, it adds just a touch of vanilla, great blend, and its big on the ABV 10%, and it's available in a six-pack. While I prefer a stout over a porter, this beer is so big and flavorful that the preference is erased. You love coffee, roasted, flavors in your beer, a must try!"

"Pours a pitch black worth a two and a half finger head. Smells like espresso and a little vanilla, but mostly coffee. The flavor is fantastic. Very thick mouthfeel. And the vanilla is boomin'. One of my favorite porters."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I'm not a huge fan of porters - I prefer stouts - but this one tastes great.  Probably helps that I really like coffee.  And the vanilla lends a little sweetness that rounds off the bitterness of the coffee (or the porter for that matter).  I really like this beer and look forward to getting my hands on another bomber."

"Had it on tap at The Fridge, Lancaster PA. Top note is full of vanilla and coffee aromas. Full bodied and creamy with moderate carbonation. Goes down smoothly with a relatively significant bitterness at the end, but not so much as to detract from the overall enjoyable drinking experience. Not a Black Note Stout but a fine alternative. A desert beer to be slowly savored alone or in the company of close friends."
""
""
""
"A beautiful looking black with a frothy gray head. Smell is a mixture of coffee, roasted malt, and a bit of chocolate. Taste is similar but not overwhelming with the coffee and chocolate. I don't really taste the vanilla. Mouthfeel is big for a porter. This is a really good beer, nicely understated with the coffee. But it's not quite the amazing beer the ratings here suggest it is."
""
""
""
""
""
"Everything about this is excellent, its the best porter on the market. The fact that its really more of a stout helps it. Such massive Chocolate, Vanilla and Coffee... It finishes extremely smooth and drinkable smooth at 10.5. One of my all time fave beers ever, top 10 for sure~"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  3.7.  It's very good, but I wanted to enjoy it more.  I enjoy the slight chocolate, vanilla and coffee flavors, but it comes off a little too harsh and the bitterness lingers too long in a not so pleasant way."
""
""
"01/24/13 On tap...just barely. At Rattle N Hum, NYC. Caught the last 1/2 pint. Simply marvelous. Words would damage the image. If you find it...do it. There will be no regrets."
""
""
"Wow, it was quite impressive, despite the hype and mystique, the beer lives up to most of its reputation. This beer really needs to warm up and time to unfold. Much like the sails of a clipper ship, you can't expect to unfurl the sail instantly. The beer in its first hour or so wasn't as impressive as the initial damp roasted coffee with vanilla extract, however once it came up to just below room temp, there wasn't any stopping to it. I would seek it out."
""
"Woah, this is a huge beer. Bitter, lots of coffee. Thick and heavy. The vanilla flavor seems lost at sea. Tasty in small amounts, but hard to finish a pint."
""
""
""
""
"Very strong coffe notes up front followed by a smooth vanilla aftertaste"
""

"O-Giving this a 4.  I ordered 10 of these online and paid a premium to ship.  Big disappointment considering the high rating.  I love coffee stouts/porters, and wake n bake is probably my favorite.  Other reviewers that I am normally on the same page with have this beer ranked almost a point higher than myself.  The coffee bitterness/astringency overwhelmed all other notes that might be in this beer...but I guess i'll never know because they are overshadowed.  Did I get a bad batch?"
"Really nice nose, but the praise really ends there for me. High bitterness for the style. Clashes with what would otherwise be a great coffee component. As it is, it unfortunately gets muddled a bit. The vanilla is pretty tough to find but is there. As always, the flavors came together a bit more as it warmed...but in the end, the high level of bitterness brought the taste and overall scores down. Certainly not a bad brew by any means, but there are better versions of this recipe out there."

"Very nice aroma and pours well. The vanilla and coffee aren't hidden at all in this beer they are the two primary stars. I was hesitant to buy this at first as I thought it might be over powered by these two favors but it was a ""just right"" blend of the two. This beer is as black as the night and was very pleasing. The label indicates its 10% ABV and quite frankly it doesn't taste that strong at all so this beer can definitely sneak up on you after a couple. Well balanced beer with great flavor, consistency, and the right amount of complexity, this is a sensory overload as it will please your sense of smell, sight and taste. I'll definitely drink this beer again."

"Good God Almighty, ths is one good brew!  I'd held Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald, Fuller's and Founder's Porter to bethe standard bearers for the Porter style, but no more.  A great complexities of smells and flavors, coffee, mild chocolate, vanilla, malt, and more coffee.  The alchohol does have a bit of a burn, but at 10% it probably should.  This a killer!"

"This brew poured beautiful black body nice khaki head. This brew smells wonderful. Deep caramel caught me off guard. Big roasted notes with vanilla. Taste to me is a little tainted. Although it's nice roasted malts and coffee. There is a huge alcoholic bitterness in mid palate. Finishes bitter with vanilla in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel makes it dangerous. Very light and tight carbonation. This brew is worthy."

"Poured a black body with two finger tan head that dies slow with no lace. Aroma ranges from coffee, vanilla, espresso, milk/lactic qualities, hints of milk chocolate. For a heavy beer the alcohol is hidden and the beer is rather light and smooth. More sweet than dry as the roasted coffee notes are easily noticed but the beer seems to slightly dominated by milk/vanilla sweetness. An enjoyable beer on its own or as dessert."

If you want to totally geek out, enjoy this while watching a 'Pirates' movie."

"Final Thoughts: I love it when a beer blows past my expectations like this. I've never been a huge fan of porters and an imperial version of any style I'm not fond of is usually a bad bet for my palate. However, Ballast Point Victory at Sea imperial porter is off the charts. Although it walks a fine line between porter and stout, the flavor speaks for itself. If you're a stout fan or even a hop head (like myself) who enjoys full flavored beers, definitely pick this one up if you're in the mood for a robust brew. Would I drink it again? Yes, I will be seeking out a nitro-tap version..."

"The taste is great. Frequently the vanilla stouts will be a bit dialed-back, but that's not the case here. This is a stouty stout, with lots of flavors vying for your attention. It all comes together really well."

"Poured from 650 ml bomber into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted on 10/14/2013."
""
""
"O - I will judge all other imperial porters by this beer it has great complexity and a rich taste. Perfect with vanilla ice cream or dessert by itself. The aftertaste lingers with a slight stickiness that is not unpleasant."

"Pours a nearly opaque very dark brown with two finger thick fluffy medium brown head, settles to a half inch that stays, with rings down the glass for a few inches. Smell: big espresso with roast, caramel and earth; vanilla, dark chocolate. Taste: vanilla pop upfront, then high cocoa chocolate atop dark brown sugar and buttered toasted brown bread, thins out into earthy espresso with prune note and more chocolate, earthy hopping and re-emergence of the vanilla. Medium-light bodied, creamy feel, sticky finish. Delicious."

"As a stout/porter fanatic, I must say, this beer is by far the best I've had the pleasure to try. Immediate notes of deep roasted java. But not too deep, not the point where it was overpowering. The perfect amount where I could taste and understand every point in the taste-curve. Every taste bud: hit. Every node: washed. Then came the undertones. A very subtly bitter espresso hint. Just enough spice for interest, but not enough to distract from the oily textures that engulfed my pallata. While this review may be a bit overly-wordy and pretentious, I really must admit that this beer is one-of-a-kind. I'm interested in tasting the coffee that they use. It must be brewed perfectly. Really, really, REALLY delicious."

"Wow - I'm sort of vacillating on this one, in the vein of one Stephen Colbert - is this a great vanilla coffee imperial porter, or the greatest vanilla coffee imperial porter? Hard to say, as I've not yet had them all, but up to now, this one might fall into the latter's singular camp, what with the well integrated bitter coffee (not usually my favourite thing), pleasant vanilla-prodded creaminess, and yes, nearly masked big ABV. Get your hands on this particular Victory (at all Costs)!"

"a little dead in the mouth with some booze popping up every so often, almost to much coffee and I love my coffee, its still great beer but I wouldn't place it in the top 100 in the world where it sits today"

"Head lingers at first then trails off as it's sipped. Smells like a typical coffee beer. Very pronounced Coffee at first hitting the palate then smooth vanilla for the finish. The finish was surprising, in fact. Smooth would be a good way to describe it again."

"Nearly black with a finger and a half of tan head that retains well. The nose is ground coffee, vanilla, roasted malt, dark cherries, and booze. Tasting it, I'm hit with chocolate with a generous addition of vanilla, then I get roasted coffee beans that add bitterness. This is diminished somewhat by a sweet malt characteristic and a taste of caramel on the finish. Medium mouthfeel. It's slow going because the whole thing is quite heavy and the alcohol is evident. A big, flavorful porter."

"Poured from a bomber into a wide mouth pint glass. Black body with a hint of light brown at the edges and a 1.4 inch white/brown head. The nose was true to its name with heavy coffee and vanilla scents, and a bit of tart fruitiness, maybe cranberry. Taste was very complex, with a blast of coffee up front, followed by a soft caramel, vanilla flavor and fruit that fades into a bit of bitterness. This is a substantial beer that coats the mouth and leaves behind a lingering flavor,. It really drinks more like a stout than a traditional porter. Overall, I would say that this is a very strong beer, definitely one of my favorites."

"22oz bottle served in pint glass. Oh, *Imperial* porter? Oh my. Beer pours pitch black with a massive pillowy brown head on top. Big coffee aroma dominates everything else. A hint of caramel sweetness -- I guess I could believe vanilla in there. Flavor starts out coffee forward, with a caramelly, oaky (vanilla) sweetness up front, which progressively works its way back across the palate and ends up respectably bitter. There's not zero hops in here, but the real aftertaste is the earthy bitterness of black coffee, which leaves its residue on the lips. I think the vanilla provides caramel and oak flavors, neither of which are president, but the result is pretty complex, without bringing the harshness of oak, nor the sticky sweetness of adjunct sugars."

"This isn't the best porter I've had, and it's not the best application of coffee. But it is very good. It's fairly easy to find, so I'd say it's definitely worth a try."
"Sweet and burnt. It hits on all the promised flavors, but it's just not all there. So very heavy on the vanilla and chocolate. A dessert beer yes."

"Ballast Point does a fantastic job with this beer by delicately balancing the acidic, bitter tones of fresh coffee with the sweet notes of chocolate malt and vanilla, while still adhering to the structure of an ""Imperial"" Porter. This beer has garnered a cult-like following over the years and it is well deserved. Highly recommended."
"Beer is medium-heavy to heavy in body, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a smooth, creamy mouthfeel with a bit of light foaminess in the background. This is good for the beer, as at 10% ABV it needs to be a slow, sipping beverage. Closes dry, with moderate stickiness clinging to the palate."

"O - The best coffee imperial porter I have ever had. For those from GA, its the Wake N Bake X 2."
""
"It succeeds in being a coffee flavored beer; unfortunately I could get the same effect cheaply by dumping some alcohol into a cup of stale coffee"
""
""
"Overall: I'd let it age and hope that the coffee dies down and let's other flavors come through."
"Like the depths that your enemies at sea will experiance, Victory At Sea pours as opaque a black as one beer can pour. Thin dark tan head. Extra thin web-like lacing that lasts long after the last sip has been taken. Aromas of dark chocolate, toffee, and expresso. Yeah, I taste vanilla, on the tail end of the dark chocolate...a bitter-sweet afterburn. The kick of expresso and dare I say hops maybe...is that what the 60 IBUs is all about? They don't call this one Imperial for nuthin.' Excellent brew, one to celebrate the Victory at Sea!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a dark dark deep sea depth blackish color with a whiteish brown thick head. Smells like coffee, chocolate and vanilla. Mouthfeel is creamy, sweet, lots of malts and coffee upfront. Lots of vanilla, pretty sweet for a stout. High ABV is covered by the vanilla and chocolate. This is a heavy brew. Very dark and thick with lots of sweet notes on the palate. For my personal taste this is a little too sweet, too much vanilla coming through, but I can certaintly appreciate it for what it is and enjoy on occasion. A truly unique beer that should be sipped, good to end a session with."
"O: very very good brew by Ballast Point. Love the flavors of this. The only thing that is disappointing, but not even a big deal, is that boozy kick in the back end. This beer is awesome and worth the money. (EDIT: just had it on tap, and it blew my mind even further- more of a burnt marshmallow taste and a lot more cinnamon and nutmeg mixed in with that wonderful vanilla. Simply amazing. Also, none of that booziness mentioned above.)"
"O- the vanilla meshes almost perfectly to an already solid base coffee porter. Drinkability is on point, solid beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Disappointing. Severely. Even without all the hype it gets, picking up a bottle from a good brewery that says ""Coffee Vanilla Imperial Porter"" you would expect something different. This tastes like you brewed a batch of beer replacing the water purely with coffee, and not a coffee with the kind of notes I prefer. If this didn't say vanilla on the label, I would have no idea it was there. And, you have to really know what you're looking for to tell that it is based on a porter. Now, maybe I had it too fresh? Maybe a little age will tone the coffee down? But still, where's the vanilla? I know its there, but it is so over powered by the coffee. I haven't had a ton of coffee beers, but what I have had is a bit more balance, a bit more toned down, and a bit more enjoyable. At $10 a bottle, I'm not going to try to figure out if I got a bad bottle. Still, this isn't a drain pour, but I can think of plenty of 4 pack or 6 pack beers I would rather have."
"O: Far more impressive than I anticipated. The vanilla is a touch strong but the rest is near perfect for the style. I'd love to try this again after some aging."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: If you see this, but it. It is worth every penny even if you don't normally like an imperial porter. Buy this beer, not sure if the newest version is exactly the same but I will review that one soon."
""
""
"O – Still have almost all the most highly-rated dark, potent and mythic-status beers ahead of me (Abyss, Marshall Zhukov, Dark Lord, Abraxas, BCBCS, Parabola, Darkness, Founder’s, etc.) but this offering only intensifies the excitement tenfold. As I sample more of the finest offerings perhaps this will downgrade but you can only go off what you know. The nose is so wonderfully balanced. The taste follows suit. I’d have sworn this was at 8%; that it’s actually one of the more boozy beers I have had (at 10%) takes me clean by surprise. Want to give it more than a 4.5 but my second sampling leaves me seeking a sweeter finish. Can conceive a creamier and more intensely flavoured beer but this is still glorious. I want that second bottle."
""
""
""
"Good beer but I'm not as high on it as others.  The vanilla tastes a bit fake and syrupy and the beer is a tad too sweet for my liking.  That being said, it does a remarkable job of hiding its 10% and there is just enough coffee to balance out the vanilla.  I'm not complaining, good beer to be drinking on a cold winters day in Vermont."
"Overall, a great offering from Ballast Point, and even though I've had a limited number of brews from them, this one is a clear favorite of mine. I have one more bottle that I will likely be opening sooner than later, to see just how much difference that best by date really makes."

"Beautiful deep brown pour, with a tall, three finger thick, brown head. The smell of coffee and vanilla hit he nose from an arms length, and bringing the glass closer revealed chocolate and caramel. The taste was full of dark coffee followed by some rich vanilla and sweet chocolate, and a surprising high amount of hops. The finish was very grainy and hops and coffee lingered long. The mouthfeel was silky, and satisfyingly thick. This is a fantastic beer."
"O-A beer that should not be passed up. The coffee in this beer makes it exceptional and although I wish it had a thicker body, I'd be hard pressed to insult this beer."

"Overall an outstanding Porter. Without a doubt one of the best uses of coffee in beer I've tasted. This beer just works."
""
""
""
"It isn't -perfect- but it's damn near close. It pours dark as the winter night and is perfect for cold, frost, ""polar vortex"" kind of days when you just want to cozy up with a good brew and forget about your troubles for a couple of hours. Oh, and the 10% ABV doesn't hurt, either. It WILL get on top of you pretty fast if you aren't seasoned so be wary of that. But, overall, a wonderful brew - definitely a favorite for me - and one I will seek out and gladly pay ten bucks for in the future!"
""
""
""
""
"O- This was a pretty good beer. Super sweet beginning; super bitter finish. Not what I was expecting, but still nicely complex. The big bitterness on the finish was just too much for my tastes."

""
"I can see why this is a ``Beer of Fame''. It's a tasty, incredibly well-balanced porter that is a near perfect example of the style description and therefore I must rate it very highly. Still, I think I prefer Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald and its slight, woody sweetness to this. I like to taste a little more malt and a little less roastiness. It's a personal preference, nothing more (darn sweet tooth). This is a terrific beer and I think it's a better example of the style than EF, but if I could only have one porter, I'd still take EF."
""
"O - I think this should be a stout, color taste depth and weight of this beer is astounding. Not a beginners beer. Looking forward to next years plus the 2 I have cellared."

"WARNING: Early in my beer drinking days, Ballast was recommended to me and I shunned it because I didn't like their labeling. Don't let this bottle fool you!

"O-I want to retry this soon. A renowned beer for good reasons. One that needs to be sat with for a bit, to pluck out more flavors than just coffee, vanilla and chocolate. Probably a few better porters out there, but this has to be top ten easily on, Earth, maybe, not just the states."
""
""
""
""

"A truly fantastic beer. Dark and full-bodied, with plentiful hints of coffee and sweet vanilla. Velvet and smooth on the tongue, with light carbonation. A wonderful brew for after dinner. Almost no flavor of alcohol, which is admirable in a 10% beer."
""
"I first tried this beer at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival - it was my favorite beer of the festival. Excited to have found this in my bottle shop."
"Overall - Despite me not giving a 5 besides this category, the sum of all parts is indeed the best of all worlds as Leibniz would say. This beer is great and has a lot going on with it. I am really loving the style and I find it to be slightly lighter in body than Founders Breakfast Stout."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is rich, gritty, nice. This is really a nice beer."
""
"This is the art of brewing. Complex and intriguing. Poured dark, very dark, into a 16 oz. glass. Head full and bye.. lying as near the wind as possible yet moving forward. The sails on this porter never stall. Coffee smashes into the bow, yet crafted in a way the chocolate and vanilla survive the flavor waves which pound the senses. Do I smell coffee, vanilla, dark chocolate. If you have a chance to drink this brew….stop and smell, the aroma is as much as the taste. This is truly a victory at sea, pour full from a growler.

"O: This is an excellent beer. I personally don't like vanilla in beers, but with the coffee it balances it out. At 10% ABV, the alcohol is masked pretty well, so it will sneak up on you. For the flavors and ABV in this beer, it's worth the price."

"Deep brown black pour kicking up a creamy mocha colored foam that levels off to a thinnish but persistent cap. Lacing coats the edge of the glass. This smells fantastic. A bold, dark and quality French roasted coffee is the prominent feature, interwoven with subtle vanilla, roasted caramel, toasted grain. Taste..dark roasted coffee. Nice French roast coffee bitterness plays well with roasted and toasted malts, lightly charred toffee and the vanilla. This may be lightly sweet, but the bitterness of the coffee and hop are very dominant. Body is medium, this of course being an impy porter in weight but carrying imperial stout ABV and flavor so one may expect a more weighty body. Finish is a long lingering coffee bitterness with very subtle hints of vanilla and toffee. If you enjoy high quality coffee and delicious beer you must give this a try."

"22 oz bottle. Pours a pitch black with a frothy brown head, good lacing. Aroma is roasted malts, coffee, vanilla, and chocolate. Flavor is the same with a bit of hoppy bitterness to match. Mouthfeel is full, syrupy and proper carbonation. This is a wonderful beer, my favorite right now."

""
""
""
"Everything about this beer made me recoil at first, but with every subsequent sip I fell more and more under its spell. Sweet, desserty, and quite amazingly balanced, with its most intense notes intricately counterbalanced. This is a far, far better beer than I initially gave it credit for."
""

"O: If you're looking for a quality porter with a boatload of flavor depth, this is your choice. Wouldn't call it a ""dessert beer"" necessarily, but a much easier drink post-dinner."

"Another beer I never thought I'd see locally so glad I was proven wrong and it pours a black coffee short black hue with a creamy two finger head and lacing everywhere,the smell is strong and I mean strong vanilla mixed with strong expresso and also massive hints of milk chocolate,the feel is full bodied with moderate carbonation and has tastes of strong vanilla,strong dark coffee,ripe berries and finished with a milk chocolate bittersweetness and overall it's nice but a little too sweet for sessionability and I feel the vanilla dominates a little too much cheers."
""

"Overall: Great beer. This would be above average even before the addition of the coffee, chocolate, and vanilla, but they really bring it over the top. Excellent."
"o: Excellent, the most balanced coffee stout/porter I've had, very subtle vanilla taste with nice scent, which is very rare. I will pick this up anytime I have extra dough lying around, would love to see in 12 oz bottles."

"Aroma: distinct coffee bean, chocolate, cocoa powder, vanilla and brownie. Smells fantastic, literally like a chocolate vanilla cake. Appearance: black as night with a really nice lacing against the glass. Taste: sweet coffee, frappucino, cocoa powder, chalky chocolate, faint vanilla and constant cocoa. Overall, really really nice, sweet flavors with impressive complexity."
"O- Yea... I'd say beside a local porter I've had which is dear to my heart.. this is by far the best porter I've had... bottom line.... I can't say anything else...you don't have to like it... but if you don't try this your dumb..."

"O - This was everything I hoped it would be and then some. The best porter I've had hands down, and it beats a lot of my favorite stouts. The roasted coffee, bold vanilla, and chocolate complement each other perfectly. Amazing job, Ballast Point."
""
""
""
"This is one of the best beers I've ever had. It should be in top10 in my opinion. Super delicious porter. You can taste the vanilla, coffee, but everything is super balanced, does not overpower each other. Alcohol is barely there, it's a great tasting beer and easy to drink for the ABV"

"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a Duvel tulip glass. Bottle enjoy by date of December 2013. Poured deep brown with a thick fluffy brown head. Big nose of vanilla. Coffee aromas after agitation. Sweet taste with good vanilla flavor. Bitter finish. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel. No alcohol burn whatsoever. Overall I really enjoyed this beer and will revisit. Would be a good one to lay down to see how it ages."
"Pours a nice black with a small mocha head that fades fairly quickly. Smell is vanilla, coffee, mocha and a little carmel. Taste is coffee and vanilla with some mocha and carmel. Nice bitter finish. A little light bodied with medium amount of carbonation. Overall a great porter especially if you like coffee and vanilla."

"22oz (Enjoy by: 11/07/13) into tumbler"

"Perhaps this is an old bottle; no date is visible anywhere. If the vanilla has faded, that might explain why I was less impressed with this than the average BA review. But it is definitely a very flavorful brew."

"*Warming does indeed reveal some subtle dark fruit that was close to invisible at cooler temperatures."
""
""
""
"Taste is big coffee espresso notes up front followed by bitter dark chocolate and rounded by some sweet vanilla notes. There is also some bitter burnt malt flavor to keep the sweetness at bay as dark fruits (rum, fig, and raisin) come through. Big flavor from a big beer - definitely a slow sipper."
""
""
""
""
"Nose is amazing- pure vanilla extract and coffee, taste is amazing and finishes with a fantastic roastiness, mouthfeel is all vanilla and is not overly sweet and in fact carries a heavy roast and bitterness. This beer is truly a classic example of the adjunct game and if it were limited release would command all the hype in the world. Fantastic beer which I'd drink anytime."
"MF – Medium bodied, slightly sharp, thinner than expected based on the richness of taste. Some silky smoothness if you get a gulp of foam."

"O- A good porter that really pushes the envelope of a stout. It really shattered the common perspective on how porters are just wimpy stouts. Although this porter is great, the bitterness is a little overwhelming and i feel like it covers up the unique sweeter qualities of this beer. It is definitely a heavier beer ideal for those cold winter nights."
"Overall, it's a lovely brew, but perhaps one that was always going to be lovely. The flavours are pronounced and are quite well balanced. It's drinkable and very tasty. Something perhaps stops me from gushing wholeheartedly about it, but there's no doubt that it's a very fine brew."

"Thick and black out of the bottle like crude oil. The top of it is capped with a small head, tan in color. I get lots of sweet coffee on the nose, then vanilla and lots of chocolate malt. I love the combination of these smells. On the palate theses same three prominent flavors emerge in the same pattern. First the coffee - strong and bitter on the front, like a good espresso. Then the vanilla makes a quick presence but disappears as the bitter roasted malts kick in at the end. It finished moderately sweet with a mouthfeel that could be bit thicker, but doesn't disappoint. I wish there was more vanilla in it as the coffee comes on a little bit too strong, but overall it's quite enjoyable."

"Big, thick, rich and robust, this is a full-bodied beer. It definitely breaks from tradition to follow the path of Americanization. It's deep, not just big for the sake of being big. Carbonation is enough to keep it lively while maintaining the character, crispness is light and works similarly. It has a nice creaminess to it from beginning to end."

"Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours pitch black with a thin medium brown head that dissipates to a thin film and thick ring around the glass with light lacing. Aroma dominated by roasted coffee and vanilla with a bit of alcohol, reminiscent of a coffee liqueur, light toasted malt. Flavor of espresso coffee, vanilla, toasted malt, light oak; finishes with charred, rich coffee and long lasting hop bitterness with a hint of chili pepper hotness. Medium bodied with some creaminess. A very nice, complex porter, rich enough to pass as a stout. Flavors a very complex and rather unusual for a porter, with the ambigous nature of the final pepperiness and bitterness especially interesting. A hyped beer that lives up to its reputation."
"Ballast Point has outdone themselves on this one. A mind-bogglingly good Imperial Porter that has pronounced vanilla flavor. One of the smoothest imperial porters you are likely to find. A definite coffee and vanilla taste and a wonderful aroma. This beer is incredibly smooth for 10% abv. Search it out, in bottle, on tap, anywhere this is simply put the finest porter I've ever tasted."
""
""
""
""

"Wow this is a big tasting brew, like the nose but enhanced and ongoing with a dank coffee effect. Pleasant coffee-grinds type of burn, also a licorice aspect for me here (but without resembling strong anise or anything approaching that). Not as sweet as I thought it'd be, but not dry-finishing either. A lively dark beer indeed, not as thick-bodied in appearance as I expected either, although a bit sticky in the mouth. As this sipper warms...roasted coffee, chocolate, cherry-anise, all encapsulated by vanilla. Excellent."

"wow! this one floored me, and its been awhile since a beer has blown me away! on tap at bangers and lace in Chicago. it pours a molten black color, hints of brown, but entirely impenetrable to light. there is an obvious weight to this, and a half inch of mocha colored head on top that slowly fades out. the nose is intensely vanilla, sweet and fresh above the deep dark abyssal malts, which are raw chocolate, burnt coffee, and very bitter aromatically. the coffee to me is more pronounced in the flavor than the nose, and the vanilla is strong on both fronts. this doesn't need to be barrel aged, its got all the complexity one could ever imagine already. I taste everything from whole wheat chex cereal to velvety milk chocolate, bakers cocoa, and vanilla frosting. it remains fairly unsweet, given its ingredients are so desserty. huge body, but intimidating. sips like silk, and the alcohol content is barely noticeable. easily one of the best beers ive had in a long time, and ballast point has now impressed me three times out of three, hard. this is a beer not to be missed, and I hope to be lucky enough to encounter it again. like nothing else around, and a real masterpiece."

"O- Was not expecting this amount of vanilla and coffee in this beer. While it says ""vanilla coffee porter"" on the label, I was still pleasantly surprised with the flavor. As advertised and very tasty."
"22oz 2009 ed from 7/2010. Pours a beautiful deep brown to black with a healthy, dense, rocky, deep brown head that has excellent retention and lace. Booziness is gone. Still very cedar, wood resin heavy, relatively dry, a bit spicy, excellent rich coffee character and raw cacao. Much more refined with 6+ months sitting in the bottle. So definitely hold onto your bottles for a little bit once they are released because this beer definitely gains from it. 8/4/7/4/14=3.7"

"Atmosphere is great. Dark and intimidating, accentuated by a nice head, and some persistent lacing. Nose is bold roasted coffee and oak with dark chocolate and a little vanilla for balance. Charred malt flavor. Prominent is coffee and wood, some bitter dark chocolate and black licorice, and a slight sweet tease. Thick, hearty and robust. Overall, this is a great quaff."

"A wonderful beer- hits all the right notes without overdoing it. Luscious and balanced, it really satisfies the sweet tooth without being too sweet. It's the nice vanilla richness that does it for me. The coffee flavor is wonderful. Obviously high quality coffee is used, and the fact that it's cold brewed undoubtedly helps create its smooth, clean flavor. Nicely balanced overall , with the coffee taking the lead, followed by a long slightly sweet vanilla note, some roastiness and a bitter finish. A nice package."

"O: Easily my favorite Ballast Point beer. I've had Sculpin numerous times, and I enjoy it, but I really don't understand the hype behind it. Victory at Sea on the other hand...A W E S O M E. Seek this beer out. I've always been skeptical of the ""Imperial Porter"" style, but this beer clearly defines it. Not as heavy and robust as an Imperial Stout...almost hard to describe, but if you want to know what an Impy Porter is just drink this and you'll know. Thank you Ballast Point."

"Great beer here, no doubt about it. I have been excited to try this beer for a long time and am glad to try it finally."
"Best Porter around. I have not had any of the variants but this one is amazing. Chocolate, vanilla, and not bland like a lot of the other porters can be. It is like the Breckenridge Vanilla Porter with a lot more flavor and balls. I am very excited to see it in Illinois and can't wait to drink my case of it. Mouth feel is very rich as well but not to big like a bourbon county wear you can only have a little."

"Pours jet black with a finger of khaki foam that's started receding. No visible carbonation, alright lacing- pretty run of the mill. Smells of dark roast coffee, cherry, fig, vanilla, caramel, some hops, alcohol, toasted malts, chocolate, and a mass of other dark fruity esters. Some definite complexity, not the most but stands out. Taste follows the nose, strong up front coffee and vanilla, a slight hop profile, toasted malt, cherry and other fruits, creme, caramel, and a touch of alcohol. Feel is full bodied and thick. Very creamy and rich, goes down easily. Overall this stuff is pretty good, despite not having much taste for coffee, which by far dominates the taste. Well crafted, must try if you're big on coffee"
"The beer pours a jet black with 1/2 an inch of a creamy tan head that laces and dissipates into a thin chocolate covering. the nose is chocolatey with bits of vanilla sweetness. the taste is rich & full bodied, malty & roasty with great chocolate sweetness. Initially it's very sweet and slightly warming, but finishes with a heavy burnt roasty and bitterness. this is a really tasty beer, great price and availability in wny, drinks more like a stout though"

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, best before 12/10/2013. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big vanilla, cream, milk chocolate, caramel, toffee, coffee, light roasted malt, and dark bread. Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of dark malt and sweet vanilla notes. Taste of milk chocolate, vanilla, cream, roasted malt, caramel, coffee, light char, toast, floral, and light pine. Lingering notes of vanilla, milk chocolate, cream, roasted malt, caramel, coffee, light char, toast, dark bread, floral, and light pine on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance and complexity of roasted and sweet creamy vanilla malty flavor; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic imperial vanilla porter! Great balance and complexity of roasted and sweet malty flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on for 10%. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O - A hearty brew, but not sure this is a porter. This one seems like a coffee stout more or less."
""
"Pours pitch black, like an imperial stout, with a respectable thick khaki foam head, with a hint of brown. Smells like a bourbon barrel painted with vanilla extract. Hints of coconut, vanilla, bourbon, roasted chocolate, french coffee. Tastes damn near like the perfect porter, smooth chocolate, bitter dark coffee, vanilla and bourbon, and just the slightest hint of coconut. This flavor can stand up to many BA imperial stouts out there. Amazing. Mouthfeel is thick and velvety, relative to a foreign stout but the sweetness could ave you believing you were drinking an imperial stout. An all around beautifully brewed beer that touches on a wide range of flavors that many beer geeks go nuts for. A must-have brew in the craft community."
""
"There is a slight brownish-cream colored head on the jet black beer. The scent changes from coffee to vanilla with each smell. The coffee taste is light, but the vanilla shines. The flavor hides the alcohol well. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light but certainly not watery. This beer offers everything you want in a porter, then takes it to another level with the additional flavors. Highly recommend."

"O: The coffee is very, very strong with this one, though it goes well with the beer. The beer remains fairly dry, though the vanilla sweetness is a nice touch. A bit acidic. A good coffee porter."

"O - A well crafted big porter that once again blurs the porterstout lines. For vanilla beer lovers this is a must try. Easily my favorite from Ballast Point and that includes Sculpin."
"O: an excellent imperial porter, would recommend to anyone with the opportunity to try. it would be comparable to other imperial porters of this caliber without the addition of vanilla but i think the vanilla is what sets it apart."

"My first Victory! Pours a dark brown, almost black. The vanilla aroma on this beer is right up front, with a dark roasted cappuccino notes close behind. The flavor and mouthfeel of this beer is insane! Rich coffee with a sweet vanilla backbone, light hint of caramel, the hops are definitely present on the tongue as well, a really great porter! I can't say enough good things about this stuff! the alcohol is really well hidden and I am getting no bad aftertaste to boot. Overall a supremely tasty brew from Ballast Point, a bit pricey for a bomber, but I am not disappointed at all!"

"On tap at The Ginger Man. Pours a pitch black color with a thin layer of light brown head. Some lacing. Smells great. The aroma is sweet coffee and vanilla with some smokey roasted malts and chocolate. The taste is a nice boozey mix of the coffee and sweet vanilla. Dark chocolate and roasted malts. More of the coffee and vanilla comes out at the end along with a nice warming alcohol presence. There's a lot going on here but it all blends well together. Slick mouthfeel. Overall, fantastic Imperial Porter that I need to have again."
""
""
""
""
"For all the praise I give it, I'd probably still just drink it just as a ""Dessert Beer"" due to its 10% ABV. Regardless, it's definitely worth tracking down while you can."

"Impressive beer right here. Second time having it. It has enough qualities that remind me of a porter, but stout lovers would obviously love this beer. Well crafted beer. Recommended."
""
""
""

"Black body, lofty mocha head. Great retention and lacing. Beautiful vanilla, brown sugar and medium-dark coffee roast on the nose. A creamy quality to this as well. Heavy roast and dark chocolate on the palate, a creamy vanilla quality contributes a moderate amount of balance. Carbonation a tad high to begin with, but this is easily remedied. Medium full feel. Delicious, might have wet dreams thinking about this on nitro or hand pump."

"Taste-Black patent malt, roasted coffee, vanilla ice cream, tobacco, black coffee/charred meat finish. Well-balanced, full of character, and very flavorfull. Highly recommended."

"With the possible exception of Marshall Zhukov this is the best non barrel aged stout I've ever had.  Huge coffee and vanilla.  The only thing missing is toffee notes."

"I had been holding off on this beer, as porters are usually a bit light and thin for my tastes. Big mistake. This is, by far, the best porter I've ever had. The coffee is definitely the predominant flavor/aroma, but the subtle hints of vanilla perfectly compliment the beer. And, it has a thicker mouthfeel than I was expecting from a porter. This is a phenomenal example of the style, and simply a wonderful overall beer."

"Hell yes. Victory at Sea gives the roasty bitterness lovers more of what they crave. Such a roasted, charred, and bitter stout with lovely little sweetness interruptions to keep things interesting. Very pleasantly surprised by this one - great way to end the night."
""

""
""
""

"Very very dark in appearance with a smooth brown head. A nice coffee smell with much less of a coffee taste, which is my favorite kind of coffee beer. In fact, you are immediately shocked at how smooth an imperial porter can be before you're overwhelmed by perfectly sweet vanilla. I had this along with Flying Dog Barrel-Aged Gonzo Porter and this was definitely the winner, although the Double Gonzo was the second-best imperial porter I've had. A lot of carbonation that makes the thickness of the beer stand out, with the sweetness balancing the thickness nicely. As the beer warmed up I really began to notice the hops, more so than any other porter I've had. As I finished all I could think of was the brilliant hoppiness."

"O: This is probably second only to everett in terms of porters for me this is smooth with tons of strong coffee and vanilla flavor exactly what I want from a porter especially an imperial one I highly recommend this beer"
""
""
""
""
"This is a great imperial porter and great coffee beer in general. I've had this a few times and I actually think I prefer it after a year or two once the coffee has faded to let the vanilla through a little more. All in all, it's a worthy brew at any age."

"Pours darkdark brown to blak with a very small mocha colored head. Earthy peppery coffe on the nose, some roast with a tad of vanilla and molasses. Biye up front that soothes into lots of chocolate on the palate. Second sip is a bit more earthy coffee. Don’t get a lot of vanilla, but it lingers in the aftertaste just a hint. Pretty prickly carbonation, but not too much. Medium mouthfeel but very drinkable (one of the lighter imperial porters i have had). Very nice beer."
"Overall, this is a coffee bomb. A very good beer, but I find the coffee to be a little overpowering. Between the alcohol and heavy flavor profile, sipping is a must for this beer. Not as good as I had hoped, but still a very good beer."

"O- great porter. Coffee and vanilla really make this beer and drinks very well for a 10% beer."

"The texture is almost perfect. It's thick with low carbonation."

"Overall: Helluva porter. Very boozy, full of robust flavors and it's definitely something to sip and enjoy for a period of time. It's my first BP beer and certainly won't be my last."
"Pours black with a minimal khaki head. Smells heavy on coffee and roasted malts. Vanilla and booze in the background. Tastes sweet up front, some hops to balance, and lots of coffee. Vanilla isn’t as heavy in the flavor as I’d hope it was going to be, but it’s there. A little bitter in the aftertaste, where most of the vanilla is. Thick, mouth coating. Good stuff."

"To my surprise poured into a pint glass on tap at new world brewing in Tampa. Not on the same level as wide awake it's morning but still an impressive imperial porter. Think an imperial Breckenridge vanilla porter. Looking forward to more from ballast point now that they're distributing in florida"

"What a great beer by Ballast Point. Poured from a bottle into a DC Brau snifter. Black pour with a thick mocha head that recedes quickly. Good lacing on the glass as this ine goes down. Strong coffee smell, something I'm growing to absolutely love. 10% masked very well on this one. Once again, what a great beer, so very thankful Ballast Point finally made its presence in Texas. Will buy this one over and over again despite the $9.99 price tag per 22"
""
"Sourcing: Purchased at Spec's in Austin, Texas for $9.99 plus tax."
""
"O: Very impressed by this beer! It's an excellent pairing with cold temperatures. The beer's flavors and richness became more pronounced as the beer reached room temperature."
""
""
"D: wow, this is a lot of beer. big time porter flavors combine with even more chocolate. throw coffee and vanilla into the mix and you have a very tasty, very complex brew. im sure if you let the heat chill for another 4 months this could get even better. very tasty and if you are a fan of coffee stouts, porters, get your paws on this thing."
""
""
"Opaque brown appearance with a reddish-to-coffee tint around the edge. Nice lacing. Coffee and vanilla aromas leap out of the glass. This initially smells like something to pour over vanilla ice cream; there is no residual aroma of malt, just the coffee and vanilla. Mouth feel is exceptional because it combines a nice viscosity with some carbonation and a finishing bite. This is not a flabby vanilla porter. The flavors are initially of vanilla, but that sweetness is balanced by bitter coffee and roasted malt. The 10 % abv is well concealed."
""
""
"O: The vanilla and coffee combine with the toasted backbone of this Imperial Porter resulting in a flavorful and wonderful brew. The flavor combination works and adds some variety to the Imperial Stout dominated market."
"O: Great beer. Get it if you can. The roasted malt, coffee, and vanilla mix well together."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The balance of this brew is amazing. Other than maybe the initial coffee notes, nothing is ever overpowering. Hop bitterness, smokey malts, and vanilla all come to together to invite sip after delicious sip."
""
"Ha! I'd rate this very high as an Imperial Stout. American Porter, you say? Fuhgeddaboudit!!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very flavorful and easy drinking imperial porter. The coffee, vanilla and chocolate is bold and in your face."

"Overall I am floored, this is a seriously good beer. Very well refined the recipe is extremely balanced but still provides a boatload of flavor. Highly recommended to anyone."

"Overall, an extremely well done coffee vanilla porter. For once the vanilla is not overdone and is perfectly integrated. A sipper for sure but perfect for the cold winter months and one to savor over the course of an evening."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tremendous stuff. Nicely balanced and tasty."
""
""
""
"Overall- This one is extremely well done. The only beer I think that has a better use of vanilla is the Stone Smoked Vanilla Porter. The coffee plays seamlessly with the hops, mouthfeel is spot on alcohol is subtle but present. Of all the coffee stouts/porters I have had this week I would say that 1st is Black's Dawn , and tied for second is Victory at Sea and Lagunitas Cappuccino Stout. With Victory at sea maybe edging Lag out just a bit. A tasty Bev indeed"

"Pours very dark brown, night shade with a one finger tan head, small-carbed head. Nose is of freshly roasted coffee beans. Not much vanilla on the nose. Taste a bit smoky/roasted getting much more of the fresh coffee note that Ballast has added. Vanilla beans show up on the back end of the drink, staying for a while and almost becoming gourmand. Mouthfeel is creamy and enjoyable. It is a bit heavy but is a nice after dinner, dessert beer in the winter. This is more reminiscent if a stout than an imperial porter. Definately a fun change of pace as far as normal smoky porters/stouts go. Pick one up and give it a try. Very much enjoyed by a true hop-head who normally doesn't deviate from IPA land."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a 2012 bottle into a snifter to share with my girlfriend. Right away the nose is amazing. The vanilla and coffee are very forward and delicious smelling. Pour is fairly dark, not quite opaque like a stout. A finger or two worth of head. Leaves a nice lacing. Taste is, obviously, the best part of this beer. It follows the nose well. Everything is blended perfectly. The 10% alcohol is completely masked. I wish this beer wasn't a four hour drive from me. I should have gotten more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Again, this is the best porter I've ever had. I feel so lucky to have discovered Ballast Point recently. Between this and Sculpin, I've added two heavy hitters to my regular rotation that I wish I'd had sooner and look forward to having much more of."
"I don't know if this is year round.. the website doesn't show it, so I'm guessing it is seasonal.. I would love to see this year round...it's a great beer."
""
""
""
"O - Delicious. The flavor is bold, balanced, and complex. Dangerously drinkable at 10% ABV."
""
""
""
"Pours very dark - mostly black with a decent head. Head lingers a bit and some lacing. Smell is clearly vanilla and darker malts - prefect mix like chocolate and vanilla ice cream. Taste is sweet with coffee flavors coming through along with a sweetner like toffee or other brown sugar like sweetner. From front to back this is an enjoyable brew."
""
""
"Overall, this is a great beer that is very easy to drink and it has a lot of flavor and would be great as a desert beer."
""
""
"Oh my god. Thats all I have to say about this world class beer.... Aroma full of roasted coffee and vanilla, nice lacing, great creamy mouthfeel, with a robust dark heavy stout flavor, notes of vanilla bean and coffee, HEAVY roast flavor... soooo good. I hope to find this in my local TEXAS beer haberdasher for times to come. Maybe my new favorite."
"Has a big creamy silky smooth mouthfeel."

"AMAZING; GET THIS TREAT!"

"Excellent beer, nice to finally review it."
""
""

"O: This was pretty good, but I'm not sure it quite stands out among its peers. I expected more vanilla, but what was there was overshadowed by the coffee."
"O: This is just a fantastic beer from Ballast Point and the more I try their beers, the more I start to love this brewery."
""
"Pretty good, has a very unique flavor. Coffee very subtle with vanilla having a big role. Aroma was pretty lacking, surprisingly."

"Overall: I wouldn't get it regularly, but I'd buy it again. If you like the genre, try it out."

""
"Overall - It's good, but it feels a little unbalanced. Almost too much vanilla to the point of masking other good flavors."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - It's a pretty stellar beer. I don't know about the whole ""porter"" thing. It drinks like a thin stout, but the flavors are great."
""
"O- Very pleased with this one. Glad I tried fresh, but definitely going to throw one in the cellar for a year or so, just to see what happens. The coffee will certainly fade, but thinking the vanilla will dominate, rather than compliment. Odds are that a year in the cellar will completely change this one - although I could argue that there needs to be no changes. I really like it."
""
""
""
""
"O- big and bold complex flavors give this Porter depth ... this Porter leads in the pack of flavor and uniqueness on the craft movement ... now I see why this is so sought after and respected .... this is special .... savor every sip"
""
""
"D - A tasty beverage. I've not had it fresh, but it's definitely still highly drinkable. I'd definitely have it again."
"Pour black with a frothy light brown head. The smell smacks you with a ton of vanilla and a burnt coffe smell. The taste is pretty much the same as the smell. Very nice notes of vanilla and coffee throughout the taste. Pretty smooth with maybe a bit high cardonation and even more importantly there is that burnt coffee taste that tends to burn out the tongue. Overall, it is a great beer with some minor flaws that is always worth having on hand."
"22 ounce bottle, stamp says enjoy by 11/26/13. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch tan head that sticked around for a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like coffee, vanilla, roasted malt, and bittersweet chocolate. The taste is pretty much just like the aroma, it tastes like coffee, roasted and burnt/charred malt, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, and a bit of caramel. It starts off bitter, and then the sweet flavors catch up to balance things out. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit creamy and has moderate carbonation. The 10% ABV is well hidden. I have to say this is a pretty good overall brew. As soon as I heard Ballast Point was coming to Ohio, this was the beer from them that I was wanting to try the most, and it hasn't disappointed! $8.99 a bomber, I know I'll be buying this again."

""

"O- it's not bad by any means, but I just feel a little disappointed overall. Maybe I had my expectations set a little high"
""
""
""
""
"Overall it is at best OK. Too bad they didn't balance out the patent malt better."
"Overall: This is a porter to judge all porters by. Absolutely delicious and extremely well balanced. Neither the coffee or vanilla are overpowering, but they both add terrific aspects to this beer. I highly recommend this beer to everyone."

"This beer is great! Look is dark brown with nice lacing. Smell is of sugar cookie , milk chocolate, and vanilla. Taste is of milk chocolate, vanilla, and wow! I want this on nitro! Feel is velvet and creme! Awesome. Ballast point rocks! Can'!!!t wait to try more of there beers!"
""
""
""
""
"Would pair well with sweets."
"O: Fantastic beer. Loving every sip and a must try for any stout/coffee fan."
"Somewhat astringent and coffee-forward at first taste, giving way to a rich, bittersweet mocha. A noticeable infusion of vanilla complements the flavor excellently. A bit of a fusel alcohol note on the finish is only a slight negative. I'm compelled to take sip after sip until the bomber is finished. Mouthfeel is silky and as rich as a porter can get without getting into stout territory. Carbonation is soft and not all that abundant but still has good longevity. This is an elite beer that has few rivals as a after-dinner treat."
"O: A very nice beer that could be dessert. It goes down good which could be dangerous because this beer should be sipped. It gets better as it warms. It leaves me warm."
""
""
"O- She's a sipper! Be warned, fresh out of the fridge, the booze is almost overwhelming. Allow it to get close to room temp, once there the booze subsides and this brew becomes almost dangerously drinkable. It's amazingly creamy, making every sip a joy. It's boozy liquid dark chocolate, with a supporting cast of dark roasted coffee and vanilla beans. Sip responsibly, this thing is dangerous, i've never really been a fan of imperial stouts/porters. Frankly, i feel you can have a more enjoyable experience with a lower abv brew of the same style. This one has me second guessing."
"Wow, tastes as if a delicious big ol black beer had a baby with an amazingly rich coffee. Bitter black chocolate on the tip of the tongue with a sweet creamy vanilla twang . Huge coffee flavor along the mid palate. Finishes with burnt sugar and underlying hop bitterness, much like a straight black coffee. Almost no detectable alcohol. Quite a brew. Could easily work as a breakfast brew with it's sweet vanilla start and bitter coffee finish. Loving it. Hope it doesnt give me the jitters though, coffee burns often do :-("
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a real treat. Would make a great dessert beer. Share it with a friend and sip it slow."
""
""
""
"O: Pretty awesome Imperial Coffee Porter and one of the best I've had. If you like that roasted coffee flavor and your Imperial porters on the bitter side, you'll love this. I've heard they last years batch was a bit sweet. This year's is fairly bitter when fresh. I'd prefer a little bit more sweetness in it so I'm going to grab a bottle to age for a year and re-visit. Delicious brew, I'd get this if you can."
"Overall very good. Try it of you can."
""
""
""
""
"Beer pours a thick black with a thin tan head - looks kinda imposingly dark. Smell is all roast and coffee, smells like it's going to be heavy on the roast. Fortunately the taste isn't nearly as roast-heavy as the smell would indicate. There's certainly a good amount of roast and coffee here, but it's balanced out nicely by a little bit of sweetness and vanilla. It manages to keep from being too sweet or too roasty - honestly the flavor is more of a 4.25 than a 4.5, but I'm balancing it out by giving it a 4 overall. Mouthfeel is full-bodied, but with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a really tasty beer that I'm excited to have access to regularly now that Ballast Point is distributing to DC. It's extremely drinkable despite the higher ABV."
"Taste and mouthfeel are what set this apart. The feel in your mouth is velvety smooth, and the taste is a fantastic mix of vanilla, coffee, and malt. This is now the Porter that I will gauge others by. At 10% ABV I couldn't detect any hotness, or boozyness which is fantastic. This beer is a must buy for me from now on."
""
""
""
"Overall: I've had this beer several times, and it is undoubtedly my favorite Porter. I couldn't pass down the opportunity to try it from the cask. This was a real treasure to try out."
"O- A tasty coffee beer, but a little boozy. Vanilla adds a nice touch to the beer. Good, but not sure if I would pick it up again. Gets better as it warms."
""
" This is a huge beer with tons of flavor and character. If you love dark and heavy, this beer is for you"
""
""
""
"D: This is a big beer. I will finish the bottle, but I will never seek this out again."
"O: A nice heavy imperial porter with some big coffee notes and just enough vanilla to smooth it out. Tasty with a really nice mouthfeel that helps it go down easily despite the 10% ABV. I'm normally not a fan of coffee beers but this is one of the best."
"Good lord Mary Joseph, this one strikes the knickers like a lacy momma ready to pounce on a unborn tadpole. I am dripping with amazement. Ballast Point's best effort to date. Something tells me I might OD on greatness. But seriously this beer hits home for me. A Porter born to sail the night, without fear, without wavering from the very foundation of why I love the west coast set. Its like surfing in a sea of mocha foam born from the depths of a dark sea, married to the sky. I can't imagine a darker sailor to share the night with. It like two passionate mates are meeting in my mouth to shag!"
""
""
"M: mostly the same as before, but a bit lighter than I remember and the alcohol is nowhere to be found. It has a more roasted malt character as well. (4.0)"

"Overall: If you are a coffee drinker this would be up your alley. A big beer that is one that is best shared."

"O- This was a very nice porter. A very nice vanilla coffee flavor that is very well balanced and hides the 10% abv very well. I'm pretty sure chase2634 told me this was an '10 however I'm not sure if that's definitely true due to the date. If it is true I'm very impressed by how well the vanilla and coffee held up. I definitely recommend trying this beer out."

"O - Delicious beer. This is the second time I have had this beer. I had one of these several months ago and it has taken me some time to find it again. Definitely worth the wait. Excellent balance of flavors. This would make an excellent float with vanilla ice cream."

"Roasted coffee and dark chocolate bitterness up front. Luscious caramel and milk chocolate sweetness fill in the palate. Notes of vanilla, licorice, oak, whiskey, and tobacco add to the deep, rich, malty mix. Woody, oaky, herbal, tannic, roasted bitterness helps balance the malty goodness. Full-bodied, thick, chewy feel. An utterly terrific beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Would like the sweetness to be a little bit more in check, but other than that this is an amazing beer. Not sure if a 32oz growler is the best way to enjoy it, would have liked a smaller bottle, but alas, Davey Jones only had a 32oz bottle."
"Definitely worth a try and comes highly recommended."
"Shared a bomber of this with a friend. Pours a rich, dark black. Smells of roastiness and coffee. Taste is full bodied, great mouthfeel. The vanilla adds a great taste and complexity to this overall delicious tasting brew. Smooth and well hidden alcohol, this was a fantastic beer with the sips going down way too quickly and easily. Highly recommended, this brewery has yet to let me down in the least bit."
"This is one of my favorite porters. Complex and flavorful, I thought this was surely barrel aged at first. Adding chocolate and vanilla is a delicate process, which is why I like BA beers more. All this is to say that the flavors blend well together and are not overbearing. The ABV is very deceiving, too. You notice it when you stand up, not when you drink it."
"O - Thick profile, almost more stout than porter, but still delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- So often does a coffee stout/porter overpower you with burnt bitter roasted malt, this does not. This is a world class brew. This profiles the coffee and vanilla without killing you with roast. This is my favorite coffee stout/porter thus far. I will look for this always."
"O: I haven't had too many porters (or imperial porters for that matter), but this thing is delicious. The burnt qualities are paired perfectly with the vanilla for an overall outstanding porter. Top of my list for sure."
""
""
""
""
"Heavy, carbonation is welcomed as a porter and not a stout making it easier to handle."
"O- certainly a sipper, but a delicious sipper at that. Really like the dominating coffee presence, so if that is your thing, this should tickle your fancy."
""
""
""
""
"D - Thick and sweet, there is a lot going on here. The vanilla works well with the dark sugar and coffee flavors though it becomes a bit excessive in the finish. The finish is a bit too sweet for my taste and that, combined with the vanilla, puts it in the same category as Southern Tier's sweet stouts; it is a dessert beer and works well for one glass, but finishing a full bottle is a bit of a challenge."
""
""
"Overall a decent beer, but there wasn't as much going on as I'd like. There was no freshness date on the bottle, so maybe it was old? Would like to try it again knowing it was fresh to see if the vanilla was more prominent."

"Mouthfeel hit the nail on the head again. Full flavored, but only on the heavier end of medium bodied. Perfect carbonation level, and a great balance of bitter and sweet from the coffee and vanilla. Absolutely no detection of the alcohol, I would have never guessed 10% on this bad boy. Great drinkability here too. Worth sharing, but one person could easily polish it off in a night. Great value too, totally worth the purchase."
"The body is full and smooth with soft carbonation. A little bit of a lingering finish would I attribute to the coffee. Overall this one is real solid. Would love to end up with more of these guys anytime."
"This is very delicious. Want moar!"
""
""
""
""
""
"D - I can't really forgive the taste and mouthfeel here. Huge disappointment. Bottle variation? I don't know that I'd revisit, but the hype on this one suggests I need to try it again."
""
"O - Definitely a world class imperial porter here. Very complex with all the notes. Just a tad bit hot on the alcohol. This one could benefit to be put away for a year or so and would certainly smooth out even more with age."
"O: I was not as floored by this beer as some others - the beer started off with sweet vanilla flavors, and then dried into roasted espresso notes - a well-crafted beer for sure"

"The awaited review of VaS. Finally able to locate 2 bombers and have been waiting to crack this for quite some time. Poured from bomber into DFH snifter. Beautiful motor oil black pour with a bit of light making it through. Nice 2 finger mocca head, with excellent retention and great lacing throughout. Smell was spectacular. Vanilla with chocolate and coffee. Some burnt fruits notes and dark malts. Complex and inviting. Couldn't stop smelling it! Taste followed the nose with huge coffee on the front that fades to subtle bitter and vanilla finish. A great blend that is almost perfect. Hides the 10% well, but a definite sipper. Feel is very strong. Full bodied and great carbonation. Creamy and smooth. Overall- One of the best beers I have ever had. A great blend of coffee, dark fruits, hops and a touch of vanilla. Smell is outstanding and mouthfeel is spectacular. Top notch effort from Ballast Point. In my top 10 for sure-"

"Drinkability – Very nice; just a slightly bitter bite to an otherwise exceptional porter."

"I'd get this again ... and again ..."
"Overall - this beer is right up there for me, one of the best I've had !!!"
"I picked this up in a bottle shop in PA, and I'm glad I did. It was a nice sipper to finish off the weekend, but the heavy vanilla kept it from being great in my opinion."
""
""
"Have to travel to get this one but well worth the trip. One of the best, if not the best, porter's I've had."
""
"Drinkable, yes. Amazing, no. I think it would be a whole lot better with 1/2 the vanilla. It's unbalanced, with the vanilla enjoying the only spotlight, rather than sharing the stage with the rest of the cast. All that said, it's pretty tasty, and I'm liking it more as the bottle gets more empty."
"O - What a porter! In everyday life, this could be a stout!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was an excellent treat. Perfect after dinner beer for sure. I'm very happy I got to try this beer and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
""
""

"O: Pretty unique for a coffee porter, but maybe just a little too boozy and unsubtle."
""
""
""

"This pours the darkest brown imaginable with a three finger espresso shaded crown that is simply beautiful. The head fades fairly quickly with minimal lacing. The nose is just fucking brilliant. It's all the coffee and vanilla it claims to be, with a nice rich roastiness and lush, sweet vanilla galore. The taste reinforces the nose. This is no fraud. What you smell is what you get. The coffee is perfect. It has a nice roastiness to it, but doesn't come across as burnt. The vanilla is subtle but present, making this a near perfect experience on the palate. The mouthfeel is glorious. Typically porters are entirely too thin and carbonated for my liking. This is thick, lush, and rich on the tongue with an aftertaste that isn't acrid like many coffee beers. Overall, this is a world championship caliber beer. I want. Lots."
""
""
""
"from this with the vanilla playing a larger role. But still flavorful and well produced."
"Pours a black color with a nice one finger mocha head on it. Nose is freshly pressed coffee with loads of vanilla. Taste is similar. Lots of coffee and chocolates dominate the front and back. A lot of vanilla is in th middle. Pretty solid, really enjoys the taste profile on this. Solid mouthfeel taboot. Really good vanilla coffee porter here. Loved it and will seek out again."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a massive coffee porter that somehow holds onto enough balance. The coffee is huge but palatable and not cloying at all. There is not any lingering old coffee finish like a lot of coffee porters/stouts. A real treat, great dessert/breakfast stout. Glad I have another bottle."
""
"O - Excellent imperial porter. Huge coffee presence with nice cocoa and vanilla. Bitterness comes close to being too much, but doesn't cross that line. Very enjoyable."
"I'm really enjoying this. Not a beer you can easily find in the area. But I'd def. seek out again. One of my favorite porters now."
""
""
"One of my go-to American porters."
""
""
"O-damn that is one tasty beverage, I wish I would have popped this one sooner, so I would have known how delicious it is. Founders Porter has some competition. Look out!"

""
"O: Overall, a very good beer. Complex and delicious flavor profile, awesome aroma, and a good smooth mouthfeel. Very well done and a beer I highly recommend."
""
"O: The alcohol is very well-hidden, but I'm missing the sweetness that usually comes from the alcohol and malt because of the coffee's dominance. If you love coffee, this is nice, but I think it causes a bit of an unbalance between the porter elements and the flavors from the beans."
"Overall this is about exactly what I was expecting/hoping for, and it's now one of my favorite porters."
""
"O - Bitter chocolate and lots of coffee and vanilla. Not quite what I was hoping for."

""
""
"a very enjoyable beer, my only compliants are it could use a touch more body and a little more coffee character. i understand its an imperial porter, but the line between impy porter and impy stout is a little blurred IMO. still a stand up beer as is, but not something i would trade for again. definatly glad i got a chance to try it and id definatly drink again if readily available."
""
"Poured oily black with a small tannish head that receded quite a bit and left little to no lacing. Aroma of roasted dark malts, vanilla, chocolate, coffee. The aroma carried over well in to the taste, with practically all the same elements in a good balance; flavors came out more as the beer was allowed to get closer to room temperature. On the fuller side of medium-bodied, smooth, lower carbonation, and a bit of alcohol warmth that really didn't affect the flavor. Very good overall."
"22 oz bomber pours an opaque black with slow forming fantastic looking cascading tannish head. Aroma is as advertised - coffee and vanilla, dark roast malt, a little bacon, and a hint of the 10% alcohol. The taste is the same - smokey coffee and vanilla with great hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is a bit harsh (really my only quibble with this wonderful brew) but creamy and dry finish. Great beer, the vanilla and coffee flavors fit in well with the traditional (but extra strong) porter flavors. Would easily put this up with some of the better imperial stouts."
""
""
""
""
"O- A really nice beer, it's very drinkable, the 10% ABV doesn't make itself felt at all, definitely try this if you like real roasted beers."
""
""
"Verdict: Masterful porter from Ballast Point. The flavor profile is wonderfully complex with a fantastic aroma, perfect for a meal or for desert that can be quaffed or sipped."
""
"Overall the palate is quite good, with just a slight minor flaw. But it drinks so well, great brew."
"O- While the coffee was quite upfront and robust, I didn't get too much vanilla in the taste. The heavy roast presence got a bit too overwhelming, but certainly a nice offering from Ballast Point and one I would like to try fresh."
"This is a damn fine porter. Full, well-realized flavor without being overly bold. One of the best I have had. Seek this out."
""
"O: A truly fantastic beer. Most highly recommended! I would (and will) drink again. Balanced and excellent with significant vanilla/coffee notes -- it lives up to its self-styled genre of a 'Coffee Vanilla Imperial Porter.'"
""
"Overall - This is a great beer. I'll certainly be on the lookout for other Ballast Point offerings in the near future."
"Overall; a damn good beer all around, the vanilla and coffee work exceptionally well together!! I'll definitely track this one down again, absolutely worth the effort to obtain!"
"O - Overall This is an awesome beer. Vanilla really jumps out of this beer. Great flowing of coffee, chocolate, and vanilla. Waited so long to try this and it was SO worth it!"
""
""
""
"This is an excellent beer. As advertised it is full of great coffee and vanilla flavor and aroma. There is a nice balance between some bitter roast and almost sugary sweetness. Everything pulls together nicely and makes for a great beer."

""
""
""
"Mostly full-bodied with a light effervescence. Slightly drying finish. Warming throughout. Very nice brew."
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is full bodied like you'd guess from a beer of this nature. The acrid notes perk up here and seem to wash off a layer of enamel from your teeth and leaves you with a chocolate bile aftertaste. Not my favorite finish but not so bad to make me rate it below a 4. So even with that negative this is still a bad ass brew."
"O: ABV and flavor profile of an imperial stout with the easy drinking of a porter. My goodness is this stuff good. Get it if you can, I'm very happy that I have another bottle of this to look forward to."
""
""
""
"IMHO. A perfect Imperial Porter!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I was very excited to try this one. It did live up to expectations but I do wish that the coffee and vanilla elements (in particular the coffee) were just a little bit more pronounced. I would definitely drink this again though. Recommended."
""
""
"Pitch black color with a small head on top. Nice speckled lacing on the glass all the way down. Smells like a delicious coffee latte. Rich vanilla and chocolate mixed with a huge helping of espresso roast. Sweetened coffee and chocolate syrup flavor carries over to the flavor...huge, smooth, and somehow not over the top in terms of sweetness. I am struck with the intense urge to eat a glazed doughnut. Vanilla bean works with everything, but never screams to be heard. Not a hint of booziness to be found. Big, thick, and full. Certainly a dessert beer, though it could work just as well as a breakfast beer. Delicious..."
""
""
""
""
"D-Overall this beer was a very solid Coffer porter but to call it a Vanilla coffee porter it was a let down.. Yes i got a lot of vanilla in the nose but the beer has virtually no vanilla taste which i would of loved to have. I feel like the vanilla flavor would of made this a memorable beer. I will have to revisit this beer through since i had a year old bottle the vanilla may of faded."
""
"O - I could drink this every day no problem. The flavors are spot on and the alcohol is all but undetectable. I am glad I picked up a few of these to last the the rest of the year."
"The perfect coffee porter. Let me elaborate: I had this on my wants for long time, almost a personal whale if you will. I spied a bottle at Whole Foods in NYC (Tribeca) and my eyes popp'd from my head. I purchased the bottle and opened it for my friend's 30th birthday. It was amazing. The coffee and vanilla were decadent and rich with a delicacy that can't be beat."

"O - I really enjoyed this porter and it really had a lot of nice flavors to it. The vanilla and cocoa flavors give it sweetness and the coffee kinda balances that out so it's not too sweet. Was sad when my bomber was empty."
""
"overall - a great beer. I guess called a porter because it's a bit thinner in body than most imperial stouts."

"O: Very good. I have been waiting to try this for awhile and I definitely wasn't disappointed. Its aroma leads you to believe there will be a lot of rich vanilla, but the opposite is true. You actually end up getting some nice subtle vanilla with lots of rich dark chocolate. I was very impressed, this was definitely a great beer."
""
"overall this was a nice little treat that i am glad was shared with me. the roasted element to this was a highlight for me. it was powerful but didn't steal the show, and the vanilla was good touch."
"Poured from a bomber into a tumbler pint, the beer is a near black, with a thick, densely packed, tight bubbled, frothy tan head that sits a solid half an inch on the surface of this brew. Aromas are subtle and very well blended, with hints of day old coffee, vanilla, dark chocolate, and some earthy notes. Flavors are rich and bold, with a blast of bitter dark chocolate and subtle coffee backbone blasting away on the front of the tongue, and quickly covering the palate. Highlights of vanilla and woody characteristics abound, with an earthy overtone throughout, and some boozey profiles as well. The beer's flavors ride a creamy and light body that leaves a great many rings around the glass as you drink. The aftertaste is a bit of the booze, a touch of the vanilla, and a hint of the chocolate and coffee blend, giving highlights of everything that just danced across the palate. The finish is rather quick, with only a slight bitter linger at the very end. The alcohol and bitterness do a good job cleaning everything up and helping the beer to avoid the cloying or overpowering realm of flavor profiles. This is a heavy hitter, and definitely a sipper for the evening. Delicious beer."

Lately brews have been falling short in expectations. It's good to see this exceed it and surprise me in how complex and wonderful a brew could be. "
"O- A nice treat for the winter season. I like the dry complexity of this brew. The high level of tannins from the coffee and roasted malt work beautifully with the vanilla. I imagine the barrel-aged version of this beer would be ridiculous."

"This was a decent beer, but was somewhat of a disappointment in the taste, after such an amazing smell. In the end the beer was good but I wish the flavor had more of a coffee punch."
"As much as I enjoyed it, I could not have more than one of these in an evening. Took me the better part of an hour to finish it, and had me not even wanting another beer afterwards, it's flavors were that strong. Would be a fantastic dessert beer. Would be interested to try the barrel aged/oaked versions to see if they bring a little more depth and complexity."
""
"This is an interesting beer to say the least. Pours a dark black with light tan head. The smell is outstanding. Lots of bitter coffee and vanilla extract and some dark chocolate. Taste is out of this world delicious. Starts with big sweet vanilla and sweetened iced coffee and finishes with bitter unsweetened coffee and vanilla extract alcohol. This is one balanced beer. Bold flavors but everything gets a fair shake. Mouthfeel is slightly thin when compared to similar beers. This gives founders breakfast stout a run for its money. Hope you all can get your hands on some."
""

"Overall, I am very impressed with this brew. This has a great balance among the various flavors. I don't consider my palate to be well trained, so it's a nice surprise to be able to pick out the primary flavors intended by the brewer. This is what makes this porter a big winner. If this sounds good to you, then I highly recommend. I'm very happy to have received this in a trade."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. The 10% abv is felt with both flavor and warmth but it blends nicely with the character displayed throughout.

"O- Really tasty stuff. I don't see a bottling date on this one, but I'm guessing it is relatively fresh considering the alcohol heat and sharp coffee flavor. This would probably age well enough, but I'm not sure that anyone should want to considering how nice the flavors come together fresh."
"O- I would definitely like to try this beer fresh considering some of the flavors and aromas were muted. However, seeing as I only got one, I wanted to wait for the right time to drink it. I just finished my first semester of graduate school so I thought it was appropriate. It's a good porter and among the best I have had. I say try it if you can."

"Somewhat murky brown in color. Small tan head on top. Very, very pleasant aroma of rich coffee and faint vanilla. Great, great flavor-actually tastes like a porter before the rich coffee comes thru. Nice balance of vanilla against the coffee. Dark chocolate hints as well. Some hop bitterness and flavor. Pleasant roasted grain flavors. Nice body-not overly full or syrupy. LOVE this-going to be a permanent want for me. I love the way it comes thru as an actual porter, not some amped up, big, bad ass flavored something. A lot of flavor-well balanced and true to style for me. Yummo!!!"

"Always look forward to this beer."
"Overall: This is truly a perfect imperial porter."
"M - Medium body, light carbonation."
"Victory at Sea arrives in a pint glass. The beer is pitch black with a finger of tan head. The foam recedes leaving wisps of beige bubbles atop the beer and sticky lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma of fresh ground coffee beans wafts up from the glass. A closer whiff reveals hints of roasted malt, but the coffee overpowers it for the most part. Flavors of coffee and a huge vanilla presence dominate the palate. Sweet, roasted malt is detectable in the background, but the emphasis clearly is on the coffee and vanilla. The finish is semi-sweet wih a lingering aftertaste of... Yep.... Coffee and vanilla. VaS is full bodied, especially for a porter, with a nice, medium level of carbonation. The 10% ABV is quite well hidden by the exquisite melding of coffee vanilla and roasted malt flavors. Overall, a very tasty offering from Ballast Point. Reminiscent of a drink one might order at Starbuck's, but with bubbles and a bit of a kick to it . I enjoy this one every time I have it. Recommended."
"Overall I'd climb over your mother to get this beer. This beer has been sitting in my fridge for maybe 2 years? Absolutely incredible beer. It was a stretch not to give it full 5s."
"This is a very tasty beer that hides it's 10% abv well. The bottle I opened has been in my refrigerator for a year and it aged very well."
"D-Pretty drinkable for 10%, that being said, there is an alcohol presence to this one that isn't entirely unwelcome."
"It pours a dark, dark, dark brown in color, medium in body, with a light beige lacing around my snifter. The aromas are an array of soft chocolates, toffee, lightly roasted malts, vanilla, coffee with cream, with a subtle sweetness. Surprisingly there is no bitterness on the nose at all. The flavors consist of sweet milk chocolate, lightly creamed coffee, dark chocolate, light vanilla bean, chocolate milk, and it finishes with a slight coffee bitterness. It's really smooth and moderately rich. It's sweet but not too sweet. Overall it's a very, very nice beer and a hell of a porter. The alcohol isn't overly present and it's a fine beer to sip on. This is another well made beer from Ballast point and worth your while."
"Appearance is dark black with a short tan head. The nose of this imperial porter contains chocolate, vanilla and coffee. Vanilla really came out more than I expected in the aroma. For the taste, a fair amount of roasted malts are present, coffee and vanilla. Mouthfeel on this offering from Victory leans towards full with a velvet texture. If you have had some of Ballast Point`s ipas but not this one, you need to check it out, solid quality."
"In the cellar for almost a year but couldn't take him staring back at me each time I passed him over for another. Pours a beautiful black ale with a brown fluffy head. Stays for awhile and then turns to a thin layer. Great vanilla in the smell. Simply awesome with a background of milk chocolate and Hershey's syrup. I could smell this all day. It's that good. Nice roasty flavor with some bitter chocolate, espresso hints and some smokiness on the swallow. Not getting much vanilla in the taste but the coffee charachter really comes out as it warms. I thought the mouthfeel was a little too carbonated for my liking but that was only a slight ""problem"" with this amazing brew. Overall I am a forever fan of this brew and look forward to his release again. And the 10% must be a misprint. Much too easy to consume and sharing may be difficult. Great job!"
"Overall worth every bit of the hype. I saw on the Ballast Point website that they must have done some one-off casks of barrel-aged and rum-aged Victory at Sea. Guys, bottle the stuff. It must have been amazing!"
"O: I can't think of a much better combo then coffee, vanilla, and stout. This brew pulls it off nicely, would love to try it fresh."
"O: Love this beer. Could drink it every day."
"EDIT: Have returned to this beer a few times and gotten much fresher bottles; this one is really delicious when the vanilla and coffee are bright and vivid."
"I remember loving the first bottle of Victory at Sea I tasted - a friend had brought one back to Boston from San Francisco back in February, and I can still recall both smelling and tasting caramel in this beer. This was just average, and I'm not sure that age is to blame given the fact that the coffee was so strong. A let down for me."
"A vibrant, delicious, balanced, big, big stout. Lots of vanilla, coffee, and roast battle it out big time--good thing they're all delicious."
"O: BPVASCVIP was one of the first beers for which I traded and that I loved. I'm sure this beer has lost a step or two after a couple years in my cellar, but it wasn't bad by any means. Recommended, but consume it within 18 months of bottling. "
"O- Really impressed with this beer, huge coffee presence that goes down very smooth. This is a very tasty easy drinking brew, really impressed."
"Overall this is just such a foreign experience from beginning to end. It's hard to explain because other breweries have used these types of ingredients in their beers, but nothing quite tastes like this one. The vanilla and coffee are at the forefront, but in a very nice balance, especially when aged for a little bit. I don't know how a company that can make such fantastic IPAs can also score such a success with a malt-dominant beer, but they do. Hats off to Ballast Point."
"O - This is my favorite porter by far. I wish Ballast Point released it more often."
"O- The second best porter I've had behind Black Butte XXI. Amazing depth of flavors made possible by the contrasting vanilla/chocolate/coffee."
"Fantastic. I've bought, traded for, eventually traded and extra'd each one of these that has crossed my path...absolutely wonderful to have finally cracked one for myself!"
"O-few beers do i want to savor as much as i wanted to savor this. i found myself so excited every time i went to take a sip....10% ??? i think not...it drinks more like 5%...this beer is just about everything you could ever want in your porter. i can't wait to find this again some day."
"Victory at Sea pours a solid black, with a tan head that comes up to between two and three fingers in height. There's a decent amount of lacing left behind, and the foam takes its time in inching down the side of the glass. The nose is almost perfectly balanced. There's some sweet milk chocolate that's neck and neck with strong coffee in terms of flavors standing out. I think a lot of porters and stouts sometimes overdo it on roasty grain notes, but this beer is notable for it's pretty much complete lack of any. I actually wish there was a little bit of roast to give the nose more of an edge, but that's really nitpicking. That superior balance isn't found in the flavor, for the most part. Coffee jumps out and dominates any chocolaty notes on my palate. As the beer finishes approaching room temperature, the coffee and vanilla bean influences finally begin to even out again, but it's a bit too late to make this a truly great beer. The carbonation is appropriately subdued, but I expect a rich and full body from a 10% porter, and this one just doesn't deliver on that front. Victory at Sea is a very good beer, and one that I would gladly come back to, but it's just a step below true greatness."
"Overall: This is without a doubt the best Ballast Point beer that I have had! This is the only bottle of this beer that I have; looks like I will be trading to get more! Everything is really nice in this porter; great balance without any ingredients overpowering the other and I still has a bite. Which shows me this beers is still a bad ass!"
"This beer poured out as a thick black looking brew. I was pretty surprised because I would have said this was a stout just by looking at it. The smell of the beer was roasted with a few faint notes of vanilla. The taste of the beer was full of coffee flavors with a subtle aftertaste of vanilla dryness. The mouthfeel is lighter than I thought it'd be judging by the look of the beer. Overall though, I think this beer is quite good. I would drink this one again if I happen to stumble upon it."
"Overall, this beer is a great after dinner sipper. I can see myself drinking this by the fireplace around the holidays. Wish it was cheaper but understand why it isn't what with Ballast Point using coffee from a reputable local cafe and real vanilla. Seek it out if you haven't had it and hold on to a few when u need a break from the loved ones in the winter."
"Overall, this must be the 7th or 8th one I have had this year. I cracked it because there have been some posts saying that the flavors are fading. I have to say they have a bit, but not to the point that I had to drink it before it turned into Black Butte. I can't wait for the next release to compare this to what I remember, and I might even age one for a year or more."
"I think Ballast Point should be commended for the awesome name and artwork. A real contrast to their year-round offerings. They should replace the fish motif with more pirate themes."
"O: I'm becoming more and more a fan of brews with heavy coffee flavorings and this might be one of favorites. It's not as balanced as others I've had, but it's still a wonderfully crafted brew and I would LOVE to try this on draft."
"The nose is sweet and malty. Chocolate, molasses, and vanilla stand out the most here. A bit of coffee lingers behind the rich cocoa and vanilla beans. It smells like a damn fine dessert, waiting for me to devour. Roasty beast for sure. The taste is much the same as the nose but a bit stronger. The chocolate stands out the most and is followed by vanilla and a bit of coffee that wasnt so easily discovered in the nose. A nice mixture of the flavors that play off each other quite nicely. The mouthfeel is full-bodied and beastly to say the least. A nice smooth oily liquid feels great on my palate and I cant put down my glass. Overall, this is a great brew here that creates pretty good balance throughout and has a bad-ass flavor profile. Boom!"
"Ballast Point is as constant as the North Star when it comes to putting out well-crafted, full-character, premier beers but this is not only arguably their greatest offering, but perhaps one of the best America has to offer up as well. Few beers this dark, this big and this rich could be this agreeably delicious and easily enjoyed. I'd swim across the sea if that's what it took to get another bottle. A special thanks to Ultraman9000 for this one!"
"O-A solid beer, but when Vanilla is in the title, I would like to see a tad bit more for my tastes. Still a great beer that I'm glad was included in the trade."
"O - Ballast Point really found a nice mix here, with flavors that tend to dominate. None of the flavors are overpowering another (maybe the coffee is on the heavier side), instead they really compliment each other. I don't mean to geek out too hard, but it's as if there are four stages to V@S: coffee, chocolate, vanilla, cocoa (and hops). Each flavor stands on it's own, but is an experience all together. If you couldn't tell, I have a pretty massive hard on for this beer. Though I'll say I do prefer the first batch with some age on it."
"Editor's note: I have never used so many exclamation points in a single beer review...!"
"smooth and sexy with a nice warming at the end"
"O - This is one of the best tasting beers that I've had in a while now the coffee and vanilla flavors blend perfectly the mouthfeel is wonderful I'm not going to have any problem finishing this bomber while to me its no longer a porter and more of a double stout I'll let that slide and say this is one of those must try beers"
"The flavor itself is a little confused, and I'm really not sold on it. Still, it's enjoyable as it goes, and it's a well-crafted beer. I think the flaws I find in the mouthfeel might be pretty subjective, me-oriented preference things as well. All this apologist stuff said, I still won't be very tempted to buy this again, which is a clear indicator that the overall score needs to drop a bit."
"Delicious, avoids the sometimes too-acidic flavor of some coffee porters and remains smooth and mellow. The smoked notes are a nice touch. Hides its abv pretty well though there may be a hint of warmth at the end. All in all, a really enjoyable brew."
"O - Great porter. I say great PR/marketing by the Ballast Point team not to call this a RIS because as a RIS this beer would be just ok. Don't you love the BJCP categories??"
"This is a superb beer, and I wish it was more readily available up here."
"O: This is a fantastic porter. Very complex with a lot going on but it is quite balanced. There is just a tad hint of alcohol but it is no means hot. Definitely a beer you must try if you enjoy imperial porters."
"Tastes are, well, here ya go: vanilla extract (from the bottlem of course), darkly-roasted coffee beans, dark and white chocolates, dust, musty hops, roasted barley, green tea, real boozy goodness, marmalade, inverted sugars, saffron, some funk and spice."
"D/O- Overall this was a pleasure to try. For fans of huge vanilla/chocolate flavors. Over the top...but in a good way. Would seek out again. Thanks to the guy who traded me for this at Dark Lord Day!"
"This is an excellent beer. I thoroughly recommend it for anybody."
"In the end, this is a nice treat but not a beer to enjoy is quantity. Vanilla is tricky to pull off and when overdone tastes too metallic and, at times, fake. This beer plays with that line and borders on cloying after a few ounces. A great share with a group, but not an ever day drinker for this guy."
"Overall - This is a very good beer. Of course, I feel like I'm on a roll with big flavorful beers that I'm reviewing. Maybe I've got a thing for vanilla or coffee flavored beers, I don't know. What I do know is this: If you think coffee or vanilla (or both) sound interesting in a beer, DO NOT hesitate to pick this one up if you see it. I doubt it will disappoint."
"O - An excellent porter. Very smooth and easy to drink despite the 10% ABV. I would buy this fairly often if Ballast Point decided to send it the KS or MO."
"O: Really glad I got a bottle of this. Really good beer that I would love to get another one of. Definitely worth a try if you like coffee flavor brews."
"O: A solid coffee porter offering from Ballast Point and SoCal. This tasting review was for a bottle I picked up in San Francisco during beer week. Too bad this beer is not distributed to VA. Definitely a porter worth trying, if you have the chance."
"Poured from bomber into a tulip glass. Pours black with a minimal khaki crown that shows little retention throughout the session. Aroma picks up loads of coffee and vanilla over a nicely roasted malt. Some chocolate makes an appearance but it’s more of a supporting role. Dry coffee and roasted malts flavors kick in along with some chocolate, leading the way to a bitter finish of roasted malts, coffee and vanilla. Medium to Thick bodied, good carbonation throughout and creamy! Great bold flavors!"
"Overall this is one hell of a porter. Perfect balance of coffee and vanilla, and a total lack of ETOH burn is just awesome. This beer is awesome, go get it."
"O: Overall this is a very enjoyable beer and has aged very nicely a really well made craft beer."
"Overall it's extremely well done. It's very rich, but nicely put together, rather than just a straight up malt bomb."
"I guess this boils down to whether you like coffee and ice cream in your beer. Maybe for dessert with a piece of angel food cake."
"Tasty beer with a great integration of ingredients that match well."
"Overall: For a porter, this is superb. If it were an Imperial Stout (which, at 10%, it kind of should), then it might not be so great. Drinkable, smooth, balanced, never boozy. Not terribly interesting but very pleasant. The fake vanilla aroma/taste bothers me a little, but it doesn't hurt this overall good brew. Would love to try on tap and/or cask."
"O: Dangerously drinkable and delicious! Nicely balanced flavors. Hands down, the best porter I’ve ever had."
"Pours a dark, dark black with a 3/4"" tan head. Smells of dark roast coffee and a little bit of sweet vanilla. Taste is heavy on the bitter coffee with a bit of smooth vanilla, round sweetness, and just a smooth, smooth enveloping finish. The coffee may be the best I've ever had in a beer - most coffee in beers have an oxidized metalic taste like it's been on the warmer in the break room too long. Not here, this is smooth velvety coffee and a round long, though quite bitter flavor, but with a little bit of a fizzy carbonation that accentuates the bitterness on the very back of the outside of the tongue and a little round vanilla/chocolate smoothness. The carbonation and medium, slightly viscous feel is perfect for the beer. This is the best porter?!?! I've ever had. I don't know if I'd really call it a porter due to the heavier mouthfeel and coffee - it's kinda stoutlike. Whatever it is it's a supreem beer and one that I'll be seeking more of."
"This is a drinkable imperial porter. Expect an intense coffee character and an ABV that wields quite a punch. I really enjoyed it."
"Did not quite live up to my expectations. Just too much booziness."
"O: This is a delicious coffee beer but boy is it boozy--it gets better with time obviously but the alcohol makes its presence known and distracts slightly from the overall quality of the brew"
"Pours a pitch black with a 2 inch chocolate milk colored head that lasts. Good rings of lace on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of bitter cocoa powder, coffee grounds after the coffee has been brewed, and raw vanilla beans. I keep sniffing this beer over and over - it smells so damn good. Taste is of dark chocolate syrup, bitter coffee, vanilla extract, and an earthy mineral taste. Only slight bitterness on the palate after each sip. Absolutely amazing. Beer is thick and creamy in the mouth. A bit of alcohol warming in the throat. Overall, this is a very tasty hard to find beer. There is a distinct smell and taste of Hershey's chocolate syrup in this beer that makes me very happy. I am glad I found a bottle to enjoy. Highly recommended if you can get your hands on one."
"Extremely recommended. Enjoy."
"(22oz bottle). Pours thick and black with a nice caramel colored head. Aroma of darkly roasted coffee beans. Burnt coffee flavor with vanilla undercurrent that gets sweeter as it warms. I'm really enjoying this more as it warms because it balances out the heavy roast flavor."
"A superb brew overall. I'm texting my friend in SD right now to pick up a few bottles next time he's out."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a thick dark brown foamy head with good retention and some very nice lacing. Aroma of aromatic coffee and light astringent note is more dominant at first then anticipated. Taste is also a nice mix between some dry roasted malt with dominant notes of aromatic coffee and with a dry finish. Body is quite full with a thick body and a creamy texture with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very well brewed with loads of complexity while still sustaining a good drinkability factor."
"This puppy lives up to the hype. The flavor is the star here and it lives up to it's name. I will have to hold on to my other bottle for a while, but I may not be able to. Awesome brew!"
"Overall a really unique and tasty flavor profile, with a biting dryness and just enough bitterness. An excellent porter. Will have to trade for more."
"D: Wow, is there really 10%abv in this, with the heavenly dark coffee roast you wont even notice. Robust, hearty this is a big drink full of substance and flavor that will dare you to have more then one."
"Pours a pitch black with a medium brownish tan head that goes down slowly. Scent is very nice with a good amount of vanilla and coffee. Some roasty aromas with a bit of chocolate. Taste is WOW! They weren't kidding when they put VANILLA in the name of this beer. I get vanilla right up front that lingers throughout the whole taste. Nice blend of coffee and chocolate with the vanilla, along with a hint of dark licorice. The alcohol is well hidden, but it pops up to say hi sometimes. Mouthfeel is smooth and thick, but not syrupy. Drinkability is high. Outstanding porter! Bravo Ballast Point!"
"O: Overall this is one heck of a beer and definitely one worth seeking out. I'm not a huge coffee drinker but I can appreciate it when a brew like this integrates it so well. The vanilla adds a wonderful balance. Recommended."
"Thanks again- this one was the highlight of my night last night."
"Very enjoyable may pick up another some time in the future."
"The mouthfeel is very creamy with a pretty high level of carbonation for the style. 10% alcohol? No way. I don't taste a hint of the alcohol here. This is dangerously drinkable. This is seriously a good brew. I saw the tag of ""imperial porter"" and shrugged it out, but I can surely see the difference between this and an imperial stout. Highly recommended, especially if you love coffee beers like I do. This is seriously good."
"D - Really amazing, wish I could have had more but the keg kicked. Worth the wait!"
"D - This beer is quite a bit of work to finish an entire bomber. I would not be able to have another. Tasty, just the vanilla was a bit much at time."
"A stud of a perfectly balanced bittersweet brew that I find finishes off way to quick no matter how you cut it."
"Drinkabilty: For a 10.00% abv this is drinkable, but not to the point of having another one. Very good American Porter by a respectable brewing team. Ballast Point always tends to put out quality brews and for that, I salute you, Captain."
"Pours a ridiculous black. Tan almost coffee colored head. Smell is a full on coffee punch to the nostrils. If there is vanilla it gives way. Incredibly inviting. What a smooth robust coffee flavor. This brew is incredible. It envelops your tongue. Damn. I really dig this beer. The roasty coffee is superb. The carbonation is perfect. A beer I felt good sharing. Everyone enjoyed its splendor."
"M/D: Medium bodied with light carbonation, but sort of heavy. Extremely enjoyable, a nice after dinner sipper, or would go great with most desserts. I was really happy (and surprised) that there wasn't as much coffee in this one, but it works for me."
"D-no way I would have guessed this to be a 10% beer. Wow."
"Overall: This beer fresh is a little bit hot, it's got a lot going on. It'd like to get another and age it a year or two, I feel like that would calm everything down and hopefully bring out that vanilla a little more."
"I poured this rather vigorously into my Smuttynose snifter, and the head has the staying power, and the aromas are lofting strongly around the area. vanilla is by far the strongest airborne scent, even more so then the coffee. digging your nose into it just screams vanilla. The flavors are more balanced then the aromas and meld very very nicely. Chocolate is introduced here to support the coffee and vanilla. For some reason im getting some oaky notes and there is also alcohol notes too. Overall i have to say this is a very impressive Coffee beer, and this is a harshly graded class for me. mouthfeel is creamy and semi-dense, just a joy to drink all around."
"Drinkability - One of the best in the style. The coffee presence is excellent. Not overdone nor a fake over-processed taste. My only down ticks is the medium body and the finishing alcohol burn. I would love to taste the BA version to see how it rounds out the corners of this beer. Well done."
"This beer pours a gorgeous dark black chocolate color with a tan foam residing on the surface. The aromatics are rather pleasant they remind of all of the smells listed in the name of this beer. Coffee, check. Vanilla, check. Imperial Porter...well that translates to dark chocolate for me, so we're good. I wanted to rate this beer higher than I did. The first couple of sips were heavenly nectar, but the sips after that were acidic and astringent to my palate. I must say that the mouthfeel when warmed up to nearly room temperature was solid, but at suggested temps was merely good. This beer was pretty darn tasty and easy to drink to boot. I would crack open my other bomber of it, but at 10% that would spell disaster. I really enjoyed drinking this beer."
"A sipper for sure - you can easily split a bomber thanks to the potency. An immense beer, but arguably over-done."
"I got myself a growler of Ballast Point Victory at Sea Imperial Porter. I poured the beer from the growler into a pint glass. It poured a dark dark brownish maybe black and has a very nice tan head. The smell is of roasted coffee, toffee, maybe caramel and a little vanilla. Lots of sweet smells. When I got that first mouthful you got the taste of the roasted coffee and some malts and is rounded off with that vanilla and a bit of alcohol at the end. Its hard to hide 10% but it really isn't overpowering. There is about an average carbonation, and it has a medium to thick body beer. This beer is a great beer to have with something sweet or after dinner. It has all those sweet flavors of coffee and vanilla and toffee."
"This is my goto beer right now. I've drank like 6 of these in the past couple weeks. Great beer!"
"This beer never lets me down. I cherish when its here and miss it when its gone."
"When poured great head retention two finger light tan head, but the dark color of the beer looks great underneath the fluffy tan head. Great lacing in this beer. Chocolate roast definitely in the nose with slight hint of vanilla. Now the taste of this porter is somewhat average. There is a decent amount of hotness in the taste and the alcohol is not hidden as well as I would like. As it warms the alcohol taste definitely decreases a little. Mouthfeel is full bodied and nice and creamy smooth. Drinkability is decent the hotness of the alcohol makes it less drinkable, but for 10% abv, works pretty well."
"Light to medium body, smooth small bubble carbonation that's pretty common for a porter. For a 10% abv beer, the alcohol is very well hidden by smooth and balanced flavors."
"D - extremely drinkable for 10%! Im actually kinda glad I have this bomber to myself, so I can have 2 glasses."
"That's espresso bean flavor comes strong, before the beer fully touches your lips, then it's mostly sweet and gentle roasted notes with a roasted strong finish that lingers in your mouth. Definitely a few things going on, yet nothing is hidden. This beer has sweet notes to it, but not the kind that make this beer too sweet. This beer provides a lot of balance for what it has to offer. Yes, it's that good."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a thick oil like black color with a nice 3 finger chocolate head. There is a strong aroma of burnt malts, coffee and caramel. The flavor is more mild than expected and not until a few sips do you notice the subtle but delicious vanilla that matches perfectly with the chocolate flavor. The coffee that is advertised is not very noticeable. This had a smooth milky body and was good but not the best we had that night. Strong brew and definitely recommend."
"T: Lots and lots of coffee and roasted malt with a little vanilla sweetness that smooths things out. Bitter coffee finish. This is such an incredible beer. I saved one and can't wait to try it in a year."
" ~ This makes for a perfect desert beer. I mentioned above that this is probably the best porter I've ever had and I truely believe that. You must get your hands on a bottle or two of this big time porter."
"D- Ive only had 12 ounces of the bomber and Im feeling the effects. No barriers in drinking this beer except for the alcohol. Not to sweet and it only gets easier to drink the more I drink."
"Wonderful beer."
"The mouth is full and creamy. Alcohol definitely smooths this one out. The coffee comes through in the flavor with a punch. Nice dark roasted bitterness to start things off. But the vanilla commands a presence as well. Plenty of creamy sweetness to balance this one out well. Sweet finish with a melding of alcohol, vanilla, and milk chocolate. I've had this one on my wants for quite some time, so I'm glad to finally knock this one off. Excellent Porter."
"I hald this for a little while but the urge got to me to much last night.Poured into an imperial nonic a deep dark chocolate brown with a thin dark beige head that didnt last long,a great mix of heavy coffee roast and vanilla imparted sweetness,a bit of sweet alcohol and dark fruit shows thru as it warmed.Roasty and sweetish upfront with the dark roast coffee flavors prevelent,a vanilla/carmel flavor lends some hefty sweetness,there is a drying earthy almost resiny note in the finish that is drying just enough.A great beer it is a one and done though because the alcohol is potent and can give off some big sweetness,a rich well made beer."
"mouthfeel is a tough thin, but this is a porter so i find that fairly acceptable. overall this is way too drinkable. not overly boozy and deceptively smooth,"
"Updated: 4/4.25/4.25/4/4"
"This beer poured out syruppy with a slight head. Very dark color almost midnight in darkness. Strong vanilla creme aroma. Almost smells like I'm getting ready to drink a cream soda. However, once you take a sip of this beer you know immediately that you're not drinking a cream soda. A strong chocolate flavor with hints of vanilla and coffee. An excellent beer that I could drink over and over again."
"D - Without Question. This is executed with care and precision. Delicious!"
"Mouthfeel is phenomenally creamy and full, and backs up the coffee very well, preventing it from tasting watered down in any way. Drinkability is great, as the finish is neutral but leaves you with a bit of everything, and nothing is offensively strong. After a while the coffee begins to build up on the palate, but really this is just nitpicking. Abv is 10% but could have been 0% for all I knew. For 9.99/22oz of this, I may have to stock up on this in the next couple of days."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Absolutely perfect to sip any time of the year at night. The label art on this is one of the coolest I have ever seen. Absolutely delicious to sip. I am overwhelmed with flavors in every sip I take. A sweet and delicious harmony in your mouth."
"D: Extremely enjoyable, I could have several glasses of this in a row. It does taste a bit like dessert, so I'm not sure if it is an everytime beer... but this is certainly one I can't wait to have a glass of again."
"Overall, this is one hell of a porter. Ballast Point has taken a style (one of my favorites) that not to many brewers spend enough time on, and blew it out of the water. Seek this one out. You wont be disappointed."
"D: I would drink this a lot if were available to me. However, it is only available to me every once in a while in my area..."
"Cheers!"
"I had it both on draft and out of the bottle and they both tasted identical (from my experience)."
"A guest taster at Camp Larsen thought the vanilla was a bit over-stated, and personally, I don't think they really need it. There is already a lot going on with this brew, and if anything, the extract lends a syrupy note to an otherwise beautiful finish. I would love to cellar one of these babies and see what it becomes in a year or so--but it's so tasty now, I seriously don't think that's going to happen."
"Overall this fresh bottle of Imperial Porter was good but no where as good as the cellared version, so I definitely recommend this beer 100% but not fresh, buy it and hide it from yourself for at least a year, you will be rewarded if you do."
"d - A bit filling for me. A bomber of this seems like a bit much to drink, but I'm up for the challenge."
"It's a full-bodied beer, certainly potent, but not terribly sweet or syrupy given the 10% ABV. It could be argued that the coffee and vanilla are overbearing, but it really does work - in small quantities at least."
"M D- Nice creamy, velvety coating with minimal but lively carbonation. Yummy indeed. After my first I had to order another."
"Pours jet black, with a chocolate brown head. In the aroma, a light roast, chocolate and vanilla hints. In the taste, quite roasty, dry chocolate, and a dry coffee note. A small bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry coffee aftertaste. Faint nose, not much vanilla, hides the alcohol, but just about average."
"D: Very drinkable and very delicious. Doesn't drink like a 10% beer at all. One of the better coffee beers I've had."
"Drinkability: This is definitely a worthy offering -- great scents and flavors and a super creamy mouthfeel; ABV and weight do slow it down a bit, but this one is pretty tough to come around in these parts so ABV be damned, drink it while you can."
"Taste is equally complex, with coffee up front and followed by a bit of cherry and alcohol. Vanilla is less evident here as coffee and chocolate lead the way and continue through the finish, yet every sip is enjoyable and elicits a rather enjoyable reflex. Feel might be construed as a bit thin at times but this is well an illusion. A rather profound brew.. I offer a rare recommendation for this seaborne chaos.."
" This would get a 5 but I'm not even halfway through my second glass and I'm wobbely. I wish I could drink four or five with no consequenses though."
"D: Great beer. I love it and will continue to buy it if I see it, also I'm curious to see how it ages and if the vanilla and coffee fade away."
"Pours, a dark, oily black color with about a 2-finger white head. The smell was sweet of roasted coffee and vanilla oak. It was sweet with a roasting bitter finish. It started silky smooth and then finished bitter, Felt more like a stout than a porter. Drank pretty easily for a 10% ABV beer. An excellent beer from Ballast Point"
"Well, at least I can say I have tried it. I have another one of these that someone might want to trade for. I don't know, maybe as it gets older it will get better but this is definitely not for me."
"D: A bit of a sipper. Could go for another but it's definately a bit boozy."
"D - Drinkable, yes. Very drinkable? no. Fantastic brew, but this here's a sipper, even for the style."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Just a bit under full bodied and very smooth on the palate. Very nice. Overall I just don't find this beer overly drinkable due to how the coffee flavor fits in with the profile of this beer. Other components of the review are going to help carry the score on this beer for me, but I definitely feel like it's overrated."
"Poured stout black into my tulip glass with a dark khaki head with a thin lacing. The smell is amazing, up front loads of coffee, chocolate roasted malts, and a subtle vanilla. Can't stop inhaling it to the point some almost went up my nose. I'd like to chop it up and take one Steve-o style but my better judgement got the best of me this time. It's a sneaky beer in my eyes it tastes exactly how it smells and in that order. It's a silky smooth texture with great after taste with a slight hint of alcohol (but barely). Definitely not sludge like a stout but delightful feel for a porter. This is an awesome beer and only wish they would they would release one with real vanilla bean and not just flavoring and set it in bourbon barrels for a few months. Then it would be the perfect imperial porter in my eyes. I might have marked it a bit high on the points but I attribute that to the skeleton parrot on the label ;)"
"D: at 10% one bottle is good, and reasonably priced, high quality have paid twice this much for beer not at good."
"This is a nice version of an Imperial Porter, very flavorful, and quite drinkable. The alcohol is slightly warming, but is matched by the great flavors."
"The drink on this brew was great. It had great roasted flavors, along with some good bitterness. It balances out this brew very well. Great brew by Ballast Point."
"D - A very impressive beer. Delicious from start to finish and dangerously drinkable."
"D - Nice and creamy, but the roasty/bitterness really cuts down a bit; especially since its a 22 oz. bottle. But it's really a great and well balanced beer."
"d- This beer is an overall stunner. I really really really am impressed and happy to see that I have about four more of these in my cellar. The vanilla in this beer is making me want to try more beers that have vanilla because i feel it is such a great ingredient with this style."
"you must drink the whole beer to get the best experience out of it. It wont be hard to do, with Victory At Sea Coffee Vanilla Imperial Porter!"
"Good thing I like vanilla because this beer is all about the vanilla. Labeled at an imperial vanilla porter, the label doesn't lie. It's been a while since I had a porter since I'm a stout guy but I figured I'd give it a try since Ballast Point makes great beers. Pours a pitch black with light lacing. Smells heavily of vanilla and I think I smell some alcohol which is expectant with this beer weighing in at 10% first sip I get more vanilla and some burn from the alcohol which doesn't over power. Very nice beer, I can see why it's on the top 100 and why it was sold out of most places that I went to."
"D & overall: So far, best porter I've had. my favorite was Smuttynose Robust porter but this has taken over. High drinkability since alcohol is completely hidden. I think I will buy more to age. thinking that some of the edges will mellow and it may bring out the vanilla."
"Drinkability: All of that roast, coffee and booze cuts down on the drinkability, but, given those qualities, it's pretty easy to drink. The soft feel helps a lot."
"Recommended in any variant though, great seasonal."
"D: Very much a sipper--goes down bitter with a fairly strong alcohol burn. Not something I would want to drink multiples of."
"The mouthfeel is great, creamy like a milkshake made of coffee and chocolate, not precisely cappuccino but very close to it. The drinkability is solid, it's a sipping beer but the nonexistent alcohol esters make it hard to believe this isn't an iced coffee."
"D: Fairly drinkable considering the 10% abv (I had no idea... wow!); a lot of flavor going on (especially the sweetness) might wear out the ol' taste buds."
"Quite the impressive beer. Flavors are very well integrated and smooth. Remarkably easy to drink for a 10% beer. Alcohol is well hidden. Drinking several servings may not be the best idea though it would be remarkably easy to accomplish. Well done Ballast Point!"
"Overall, I finmd the balance of sweetness of the vanilla and coffee bitterness a bit of a disppointment. Not a bad beer, but I don't think it lives up to the hype."
"Here I was thinking Ballast Point's only great beer was the Sculpin. Foolish, this one is amazing too. Christ, I may like this better than Sculpin."
"D: Excellent, very flavorful, good depth, lots of character."
"Drinkability - Unbelievably so. For the ABV, I can't get over how easy this beer drinks. So glad I have multiples of this. An amazing beer."
"Drink- An outstanding porter. So flavorful, rich and robust and very drinkable. ""See my post about your glass and saying damn"""
"D-One that I look forward to every year. If you can find it, grab it! And cellar it."
"Thick black with a nice creamy mocha colored head with good retention. Mocha and chocolate aroma with a hint of vanilla. Flavor is very similar to the aroma with more vanilla. Dark chocolate with rich roasted coffee flavors and strong vanilla. The flavor just sits in the mouth and lingers for awhile. I love it. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of heavy and coats the mouth. As drinkable as a 10% beer can be."
"D - Drinkability is high. Especially following Infinium, this beer is just fantastic. The smell, taste, and mouthfeel are incredible and I could easily drink a bomber of this and come back for more. Only downside to this beer is the relatively weak appearance, but the rest more than make up for it. One of my favorites."
"Victory at Sea has its strong points (aroma and flavor profile on the font end) as well as its shortcomings (finish and mouthfeel). This is a very good imperial porter (which is incorrectly categorized as an ""American porter"" here on BeerAdvocate) but there are a number of coffee infused beers out there which are better."
"D: I didn't want to put this down. Really, really good. I want another one already."
"The CPJ"
"Verdict: Good, albeit not fantastic, and unique. Worth trying if you see it but probably too crazy for most folks to enjoy.."
"given the abv, the style, and the unique flavors, this one is crazy drinkable. not quite as much vanilla as I'd hoped, or remember from past version, but I won't hold it much against this brew. It's stellar, and I personally would take one of these to an abyss, darklord, or the like any day of the week. I know it's a different ball game, but still... this one really impresses."
"D - Wow, abv is hidden extremely well, with only a hint coming through as it warms. This is such a smooth easy drinker, I only wish the vanilla was a bit more prominent."
"Impression: Another Stellar beer from BP. Thank you to them. Get this if you see it, it's a must try."
"Drinkability: this is a slow sipping beer, but the flavors keeps it interesting throughout. Definitely worth seeking out."
"this is a tough call, I think some people will love this beer if it hits their flavour profile, it has character in spades, they just didn't all line up for me. definitely worth checking out if you dig big/interesting porters."
"D - I paid 13 for this bomber, and it was worth every penny. Smooth, creamy, chocolate, coffee with subtle hints of vanilla. Possibly my new favorite Porter."
"D - this is a sipper, but I do like it quite a bit, so drinking it isn't bad at all."
"Pours pitch black with a good amount of head. Smells strongly of coffee with a bit of vanilla. A bit of vanilla as well... Tastes strongly of coffee and vanilla with a fairly thin background. Clean and smooth and a very light. Vry drinkable especially for 10%..."
"Black pour with brown highlights and a small loose white head. The aroma has loads of vanilla and coffee with some faint dark fruit. Thew flavor is smooth milk chocolate, vanilla, candied figs, smoke, wood and lots of alcohol. Thinnish body, oily, soft carbonation and some alcohol warming."
"D - One of the smoothest beers not just Porters I have ever had...I will be getting a few more bottles of this tomorrow."
"Drink this one warm from the start to get the full flavor profile."
"This beer does everything well. black with a resilient tan head. Lacing all up and down the glass. Aromas of chocolate and coffee. Vanilla comes into play with the flavor along with the coffee and chocolate notes. Terrific mouthfeel, rich and full bodied. Alcohol is well hidden. Very drinkable, complex flavors. Worth the price tag. I will definitely pick this up whenever possible."
"Split a bomber with a friend and was satisfied with my half."
"Fuller medium body, mild carbonation, a little creamy and smooth. Really nice drinking, and some age helped mellow out the alcohol although some of the coffee and vanilla flavors faded."
"This beer is big and has a fairly heavy feel to it, but that does not take away from its drinkability, could have had a second if it weren't so damn strong"
"5.0 D: This one drinks well from start to finish. Flavor is great as is the mouthfeel and this doens't seem like it's 10%. Good beer overall and easily the best I've had from BP. Sculpin doesn't even come close."
"D - High ABV but still pretty damn drinkable."
"Drinkabilty - This 22oz was enough. This was very strong and high on flavor. Was fun to drink, alot going on. Wasnt expecting it to be so strong and sweet. Its really good,I want to age one and i need to drink another one cause it was good, and next time i will expect the flavors more."
"Beautifully black with a strong dark head. Sweet lacing. Awesome looking beer. Very roasty nose with cocoa/vanilla highlights. Smells like an ice cream cake. Coffee is there as well.  Roooast in the taste. Vanilla is awesome and the coffee is right their with it. Feel is bulky, just what I was hoping for. Creamy and delicious. Very drinkable beer. Great flavors. Haven't had this in a year and judging from my buddy's notes it's a good thing we revisited it. "
"Pours amazingly with a pitch black body and a nice two finger dark tan coffee colored head that has great retention. Insanely thick lacing is left on my entire pint glass as I drink this one down. Smell is a bit weak on this one, in strength and complexity. Smells of lots of malts, cocoa and some vanilla. I pick up a pinch of alcohol too. The malt profile of this beer is gigantic. Taste is basically a strong version of the smell, like many beers. Lots of cocoa and some vanilla among the huge malts. There is just nothing too amazing sticking out on this one. Mouthfeel is moderate bodied and pretty oily with low carbonation and some good warming. Drinkability is alright, the taste is good, the price is not too bad for such a big beer, not sure if I would get this one again, probably on tap."
"D: Opening the bottle is made worthwhile just by the smell of this over-rated beer. While flavors generally match the intensity of the smells, the sharpness of early acidity is off-putting and difficult to ignore. Definitely a sipper--it's sensory qualities tower over other bottled imperial porters, such as Flying Dog's Gonzo."
"great beer. I love the thick viscous mouthfeel and the drinkability."
"Overall I love this beer. Like I said, one of my all time favorites and without a doubt my favorite porter. That being said, it very often doesn't feel like a porter. I will drink this beer again, and again, and again..."
"Drinkability is superb. I wish this beer was a sandwich garnish, a steak sauce, a pancake syrup, or a pie filling. This flavor profile is awesome. Merry Christmas to me."
"A very tasty, sweet libation for slow sipping."
"D: Very tasty, goes down dangerously easy, slightly filling, strong but disguised kick, very good representation of style, this is a very flavorful porter that is worth drinking for a long time if you're in the mood for the style."
"Drinkability is great with this beer. It looks great, smells and tastes very good and goes down easy. If you love coffee, you'll love this beer, because fresh, it tastes almost like an iced coffee. You'll just need to be careful, because unlike an iced coffee, this porter carries a very well-hidden 10% ABV that can be very dangerous. On the whole, a great beer to crack open with a few friends."
"A great beer overall but personally not my favorite. Worth trying for sure though."
"Dinkability: I would have this bad boy again however I am not a big fan of coffee drinks, I have to be in the mood for them. But I would reach for this one... Nice balance of flavors- some coffee brews are too intense."
"Really good beer. Did not slay me, but definitely worth efforting to try. One of those beers you wish you had gotten more of..."
"Went out of my way to order this one to Georgia and I'm glad I did. Another well done offering by the folks at Ballast Point."
"D-- Well balanced. Sometimes coffee, sometimes vanilla and sometimes carmel. No taste able alcohol to this. Was a bit light in spots but very, very good, Easily could have had a second bomber of it and been happy and not had an issue with it. Very happy to have had one of the beers I have been wanting for a while. Did not disappoint one bit."
"D: Even though its 10% ABV, its very easy to drink and I could drink many glasses. I would recommend this to everyone."
"This is a very robust and flavorful porter. The body and high abv limit the drinkability but if you are looking to try a damn tasty porter (stout), try this one."
"Mouthfeel is full with a creamy amount of carbonation."
"Cheers..."
"An excellent limited release from Ballast Point! Strong, for sure, but really great tasting!"
"D: I love the flavor of this beer, and never mind the ABV I cannot wait until my next sip let alone my next glass. I probably couldn't drink this beer all night as the ABV would hit me hard, but the flavor is phenomenal and will keep me coming back for more."
"D--I am really happy to get my hands on this, and look forward to more of it in an upcoming trade. Definitely an excellent brew, highly recommended..."
"Mouthfeel felt silky all the way through with low amounts of carbonation. Medium in body and weight. Drinkability is incredible on this beer. One bomber was definitely not enough for us three. Very flavorful and smooth-drinking. The 10% ABV isn't found in the taste at all, but it'll keep you at bay in the long run. Another damn delicious gem from BP."
"Cheers!"
"D: Although huge abv, easy to drink. My favorite porter so far. The flavors go together so well. I am going to have a hard time aging a couple of these because I'm always going to want one. So good."
"great stuff!"
"All in all one of the better Porters I've had recently, and nice complex beer all around. For the price, this one is a great buy"
"Drinkability: A fine drinking porter perfect for a cold night like tonight. My one gripe is that I should have opened this one up sooner. I'd like to try it fresher and see if the coffee comes through more. Still, I'm enjoying it and I would recommend it to anybody."
"D - Hides the alcohol superbly and the coffee & vanilla taste does not wear, always leaving me wanting more"
"Over the top and highly worthy of seeking out."
"smooth, velvety moutfeel... medium bodied, though a bit lighter than most similar-styled beers; appropriate carbonation. 10% ABV makes its high drinkability rather dangerous."
"I received this beer late 2009, so am guessing that it has dried out a bit from what it started as. But as far as I can tell, time hasn't hurt it much as the coffee and vanilla are still very evident. This is a great beer and I'll definitely jump at the chance to grab it should I come across it in the future."
"Note: Chugging this beer midway through an epic tasting can lead to immediate and irreversible intoxication (even if your friend grills you chicken in the middle of the night) and palate wrecking, causing the imbiber to not be able to differentiate Kate the Great from Alpha Kong. Seriously."
"Good coffee flavor with hint of vanilla and nuts. Short lived tan head. Dark brown in color. You can taste the hops, but they are not overpowering. The alcohol flavor is there, but not overwhelming. Very good porter, but it would probably improve with age."
"Not a bad beer, great coffee quality, rich and creamy."
"Taste is rich and sweet, the coffee bitterness is quite strong and present, a bit astringent and harsh. The vanilla isn't very apparent but I think it's toning down the bitterness of the coffee a bit. It's pretty good but a bit harsh for drinking a lot of."
"Mediated carbonation levels with a nice mouthfeel that is not too thick but definitely not thin. All in all, a very drinkable coffee Vanilla Porter."
"Although I drink this slow and savor the flavor, I could drink this all night, it's just an amazing beer - something I'll make sure to buy every time Ballast Point releases it."
"D-Wow. The vanill and coffee flavors are HUGE in this. I can't wait to take another sip. I find my self chugging the glass!"
"D - coffee has died down a bit here but the slack is taken up by a more pronounced vanilla and toasted nutty sweetness. hides is 10% ABV dangerously well, with nary a spat of alcohol taste or burn present."
"Drinkability: Probably a neck and neck tie for my favorite beer from Ballast Point (Sculpin being the other). I've had this beer on tap and out of the bottle and it is really really good. Definitely one I order whenever I see it."
"Drinkability -- Quite good. Passed my expectations, nearly made it to my hopes. Rich, roasty, great balance, good feel. The flavor opens up considerably as it warms. Must get more."
"The taste is also big on coffee. Starts like an espresso, then finishes with some caramel, mocha, and vanilla. In the mouth it's a little bit less creamy than I'm accustomed to with an imperial, but nothing terrible. It's definitely drinkable, although the alcohol is definitely present as it warms. Happy Halloween!"
"Ohhhh, this is way smoother than it should be. Vanilla and coconut-infused chocolate malt flavor. Smooth yet robust. One of those ""wow"" beers, no doubt about it. This review has officially been cut short due to the extreme enjoyment I get from every single sip. Amazing beer."
"Before I knew it the 22oz was dust. Very drinkable."
"the only thing i wish this beer had was a slightly thicker mouthfeel. other then that this is one of my favorite beers made in SD!"
"Ultimately, this doesn't quite do it for me. Pretty good beer, but it taste like a candy whipped up in a big factory with robots vs. a confection whipped up by hand in the back of a local shop. Close for me."
"very nice."
"OVERALL: Good, enjoyable beer. A nice nose and some very nice flavors, though it's still a little boozier than I'd hoped. The heat makes it a bit of a slower drinker actually, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. Very glad I got to try this brew, and would gladly have another if given the opportunity. Thanks again craytonic."
"D: Excellent beer overall. Perfect with dessert or even for dessert. Would be interested in trying this one fresh."
"D: The coffee, chocolate, and vanilla kept me coming back for more, but the 10% finally reared it's head by the very end of the bottle. Excellent coffee porter to share with a friend!"
"D - Well at that price is truly was great to try it. Maybe it's just me but like Creme Brulee, I can't seem to focus on the extreme vanilla that everyone says is in there. A very drinkable coffee porter but would kind of work better at a lower ABV since it comes off kind of cloying."
"D: The 10% was very well hidden. This is one heck of an amazing porter."
"Good stuff, but hard to finish a lot. Would make for an excellent desert drink, but only at about 8-10oz at a time. Would still like to know what the hell was in that beer, but it didn't seem to diminish the flavor."
"Overall, it is exactly as advertised; nothing out of kilter and no surprises. Very impressive execution."
"Bitter, dry finish, carbonated yet smooth again, a little boozy, but great great beer."
"Damn fine monster beer here. Could really be considered a dessert beer with a slightly cloying sweetness on the long finish and very tannic from the coffee and acidic as well. Rich vanilla and bitter cocoa, dark chocolate, espresso, more vanilla, black berry, plum and a good amount of earthy hops and hop bitterness. Finish is long. Mouth spudders slightly hence the sweet tannic end. Otherwise a very worthy beer."
"Drinkability: A solid beer, with a great array of flavors and aromas, even if the process notes were a little off. I could see this paring fantastically well with German chocolate cake or some other such rich dessert, and though the alcohol was present both in the feel and in the taste, I think it was on the whole well-tempered, all things considered. Recommended."
"Does the skeleton really indicate a victory? Anyway... It pours an opaque black brown topped by over a finger of very light tan foam. The nose comprises coffee, chocolate syrup, molasses, roasted malts, vanilla ice cream, and some sprinkles o' cinnamon. The taste follows the chocolate path to enlightenment, accompanied by some light coffee, roasted malts, maple syrup, brown sugar, and a nice subtle burst o' vanilla bean. Damn, this be some tasty shit! The body is a solid medium, with a light carbonation and a silky feel, baby. Believe the hype, people, this shit tastes damn good! Get some!"
"D - Wow, a truly unique Porter calling anything other than Imperial would be wrong -it has so many attributes, though. The masterful use of the spices improves the overall beer rather than detract from it which is why it gets the '5' it really never lingers in one flavor realm too long, it is a progressively subtle yet intense and balanced experience. The 10% is not apparent until after you've downed a snifter - so deceptive and yet so luxurious."
"On cask into tulip."
"Pours black with a brown head, no surprises there. The smell is roasted coffee (the cheap stuff though, folgers maybe), chocolate and some vanilla. I was pretty taken aback by the flavor, I expected roasted coffee to dominate but this is an absolute vanilla bomb. Coffee, chocolate and a nuttiness are all underlying flavors as well. Everything combines to make a beer that reminds me more of a mocha vanilla milk shake than a porter. Creamy mouthfeel, very sweet but not to the point that drinkability suffers. Definitely some delicious stuff."
"Pours black with lots of dark brown and red creepin from the edges towards the middle. This keg is a year old now so the coffee has somewhat dropped out but is still present. The vanilla on the otherhand has really developed nicely. It smells exacty like fresh vanilla beans. Not exract. Fresh beans. The taste is the same but with a nice roast character from the malt. Great mouthfeel. The bitterness and carbonation go well the smoothness. Awesome beer."
"Poured a dark chocolate brown with a half finger of brown head that left good sticky lacing on the glass. Roasted malts, coffee, and vanilla dominate the nose which also had chocolate slight nutty, and a little sweet lacto notes. Like the nose the roasted malts seem to pop more but the chocolate is a bit stonger on taste that had vanilla and coffee accents. There is was also a little underlying booze and nutty flavors. The beer was medium body with a good amount of carbonation that had a sweet roasty creamy finish. Overall it drank very good and was even better when paired with chocolate brownies. I will definitely try to get more of this tasty brew."
"D - Really easy to drink. Awesome coffee beer. Probably the best coffee flavored beer I've had. I really enjoyed this one and will grab it again if I ever see it."
"Always enjoy this beer, and out of the cask is no exception, the alcohol has a way of sneaking up on you in this, no real warming in the mouth, but my chest and stomach start feeling it a few sips in."
"D: This was excellent. The flavors were well integrated and the beer very drinkable. I will definitely hunt this out again and wish I could score some of the special blends of this solid beer."
"D - A world class offering in draft form... Still a very formidable offering in bottle form... The vanilla and balance are MIA... Also the mouthfeel suffers from increased fizziness..."
"Drinks: like dessert. Victory at sea is a treat that, while not terribly complex, is utterly drinkable. I foresee the flavors mingling even better with time; I look forward to revisiting an aged bottle in a year or so."
"Quite tasty, indeed."
"D - This porter is 10% so watch out...but you can not taste any alcohol...great coffee flavor with hints of cream...make sure you like coffee before having this one"
"Drinkability: Normally, I am not a big fan of vanilla but this beer is so unique, with so many other elements going on, that the vanilla, though dominant, really is additive"
"M/D nice carbonation, very smooth and creamy, very drinkable, but I couldnt have more than a bomber as it is a bit heavy. But split between 2 people it was perfect."
"A very drinkable but assertive Imperial porter!"
"I really loved this beer. If I had ready access to it, I'd buy a case. A truly GREAT job by Ballast Point."
"D - A bit heavy, so it's not like it's a session beer, but pretty good for the style. Didn't have a problem getting through the bomber of this."
"drinkability is insane. such rich strong aroma and flavors masked behind that 10% alcohol. totally worth the mula."
"D-At ten percent ABV and being as sweet as it is one bomber is more than enough with this beer. I would certainly drink it again if given the chance but for the price there are better beers for the style."
"d - A pretty good porter. Smells amazing with lots going on, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the bitterness in the taste; it was a bit too much. I didn't get any vanilla from the taste which I would have liked, and also thought the high carbonation hurt it a bit. None the less, it is still a very good porter worth checking out. Would have again."
"D - Very close to being a drain pour; instead I corked it and drank it the next day, when it was finally enjoyable."
"Thanks to MASPuros for this one. 22oz. bottle served in a snifter. Poured a deep brown with a finger of tan head. Coffee, chocolate malt along with a bit of hops in the aroma. Lots of chocolate in the flavor. Rich and smooth, medium to full bodied. Some piney hops in the middle. Vanilla in the finish. Finish lingers fairly long. Also some drying from the hops in the finish. Solid beer, but the coffee stout/porter thing just doesn't do it for me."
"Beer poured black with a bubbly tan head. Nose is good, heavy roasted coffee dominates. Taste is roasted malts, coffee, slightly sweet from the underlying vanilla. There is a nice smooth hop finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very smooth. Overall drinkability is good. Initial sips were hot. I would love to try this beer with a year of aging! Glad to have had the opportunity to try!"
"Pours almost black with a huge head which settled quickly. Good lacing remained throughout. The nose was milkshake - chocolate and vanilla, caramel, with a noticeable roasted malt and coffee. The mouthfeel was creamy and a perfect thickness for a porter. Taste was carmel, coffee, vanilla. The finish contained some bitterness, smoke and a mild and pleasant alcohol warming. i would not be able to sip at this all night but will definitely seek it out again - an excellent porter."
"D: This is a beer that definitely needs to be sipped given the high alcohol content."
"D: I can drink this beer all night and not get tired of the complexity and versatility of the flavor. At 10%, it can sneak up on you if you aren't keeping tabs on your tab."
"The bottle depicts a skeleton clutching the helm of a seemingly sunken ship... Yet the name is in stark contrast-- ""Victory at Sea."" I think this is best visual description of ""Stairway to Heaven"" I've ever seen. You can't always get what you want, and sometimes you don't always want what you get... And just sometimes, well, sometimes, you just might get what you need. I need another one of these!"
"My only other review was also a coffee beer (stout), which I hated. I have since tried other coffee beers and some have been so-so, but this one was really very drinkable. Really delicious. Again, it's 10% ABV, so watch out!"
"D: This one falls into the dangerous category. May be hard for some to stomach more than one of these, but I'm a fan of huge dark beers. Very drinkable and glad I had the opportunity to taste this on tap."
"D- this is big so big I think I can only enjoy one right now. Man is this great."
"D: Drinkability is good, not too much of an alcohol presence, but maybe a little too creamy to drink too much of it."
"Probably not meant to be. Not a huge coffee fan. Sometimes I find a coffee beer that does it for me (Speedway Stout comes to mind). This is not one of them. I was hoping the vanilla would balance things out, but it didn't seem to come through."
"D - I was a bit worried about this one after I bought it as I'm not a coffee drinker. But this beer is about a lot more than coffee and the coffee it does have works well. This is a very good beer."
"D- Low. I'm very 'meh' on this beer. For the price, I can't see myself buying this again."
"D- Not incredibly drinkable, at least for me. Bitterness that comes with coffee definitely slows my ability to drink, it's also a very heavy beer. The alcohol also impedes speed. However, this is still a great beer worth the try."
"That's right, on freakin' tap, here in PA, into one of those effete snifer glasses..smelled like a dark roasted coffee, deep brown color, no head by the time the bartender got it to me, which took about 20 seconds after he poured it. Very rich, thick, tasted like chocolate with only a hint of vanilla. A little boozy, but a nice balance overall. At 10% ABV, thought this was more like an imperial stout, but not complaining. The wife even thought it was good, which says a lot..."
"D - Drinkability is good. It's pretty big for a porter, even an imperial. The 10% makes it go down slow. That's not a bad thing for this beer though. Tons of flavor makes you wnat to sip and savor every bit. Might be tough to dink 22 ounces so splitting this works will for me. I could have used a touch more vanilla but that is a very minor issue in the grand scheme of things."
"D: Tasty beer. Not much is to be said of the Vanilla. Not sure Id want to drink more than a 22oz bottle in 1 sitting."
"Ballast Point generally brews good beer. Occasionally they brew something special. Victory at Sea falls somewhere in between the two. It's damn good, but isn't quite special. Frankly, a bigger body might be all it needs to get there. Without question, it's damn solid all-around and is well worth your attention. Easy recommendation."
"D- The smell and taste aren't the greatest, but it was still relatively easy to drink this beer. I'll probably be splitting my other bomber however. Thanks again Dan!"
"D - This was a solid beer. I will definitely be looking to score more."
"I have to say ballast point is on the fing ball. They have yet to show me a product I did not enjoy. Keep up the good work and thanks for bring it to philly."
"Wow, outstanding. Hits you quick with a slight kick/bitter hop...very creamy semi-thick mouthfeel and follows with tons of sweetness. Carbonation is strong, but no where near noticable to distract from the huge flavor of this beer! Again, booze is well hidden. Lot's of coffee and vanilla flavors mixing great together. The aftertaste is also outstanding. A few minutes after each mouthful, there's a great vanilla aroma still attacking the nostrils and coffee penetrating the taste buds. What a great tasting beer! Again though, this is a porter!? haha."
"Very drinkable, the alcohol is sneaky. About halfway through you realize that it's 10%."
"Very tasty and I wish I had access to this without having to trade for it. This along with Terrapin Wake N Bake are the best coffee beers I've ever had."
"I got this in a BIF, thanks Dunt. I poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a snifter. It pours a deep, jet black, no highlights. The head is wa sticky, little white thing that sticks around for a while. It smells like a Frapacino infused beer, which is not a bad thing. Bitter coffee hits up front and is mellowed by the very obvious vanilla. The roasted coffee follows you to the lingering finish. This brew is creamy and smooooth. The carbonation is on tap and the alcohol is hidden. This drinks like a much smaller beer. Highly recomended."
"There is a strong coffee flavor and bitterness in the back palate. The front palate detects a mild sweetness. The beer is smooth, no carbonation on the palate. Beer is lighter in body than expected overall. The bitterness lingers but there is no aftertaste, just a flavor that holds on. Overall, pretty enjoyable and a good porter for sure."
"Man, I love this beer. While not too overly complex, it's just so RICH with flavor, with it feeling like you just had an after dinner dessert AND coffee in your glass. Just really fantastic stuff that will get you buzzed in more ways than one."
"CHEERS!!"
"Mouthfeel is spot of for a porter. Smooth and silky with the flavor of a stout. This is for sure the biggest porter I have ever drank."
"D: Excellent beer, although it's a sipper. For it's intense flavor and high ABV, it's very easy to drink. It does not need age, as it is showing brilliantly right now."
"Overall, I was a little offset by the heat, as I have had this both from the bottle and from the cask and both consist of heaven on earth in deliciousness without the booziness. However, this is still a masterpiece of an imperial porter, and remains among my top five favorite beers of all time."
"A must try well done !!!"
"I am not going to do my usual full review on this one. The brew looked great when I poured it. Very dark brew with a lasting full dark foam. The smell seemed a little off bit wasn't something rusting could place. The taste was the kicker. It actually took me back. It reminded me of a cheese that had been sitting out a a party for a bit too long. I really didn't get any coffee flavor at all. I truly hope that this was just an off bottle. It tasted nothing pike I expected. I actually did not finish it, I dumped it. Maybe in tje future I will try another bottle and re-review it. This was NOT a good bottle to grab though."
"Comment: Nice brew, and might have made a great candidate to spend some time in oak."
"All in all... A great porter! Highly recommended!"
"Very drinkable; dangerously so. Bittersweet aftertaste and mix of flavors that mesh very well make this a very palate enticing beer."
"D: Very drinkable as none of the robust flavors tire the palate, but the 10* ABV can creep up on you..."
"On tap beside the Sculpin IPA, I guess Bocktown just had a tasting for Ballast Point. A newcomer to the beer scene in the Burgh. This one pour black as night no ruby highlights seen when held toward the light. Mocha brown head fine speckled lacing forms as it dwindles. Aroma offered up strong coffee dark roasted malts dark chocolate hints of soft vanilla and mild caramel tones, and a bit of booziness is detectable as well. Flavor was a big roasted porter a bit of dark fruit plums soaked in alcohol with nice rounded vanilla and caramel sweetness. Very much a dessert beer, balanced with herbal hops and dark roasted coffee bitterness. The alcohol level didn't offend the palate or get in the way of drinkability. Full bodied slight alcohol burn, carbonated moderately finishes velvet smooth. Drinkability is way too easy for a 10 percent brew, I enjoyed this and I'm sure they're still pulling this one get there while it lasts great world class brew out of San Diego, wow SoCal is spoiled."
"Good drinkability. There's a lot going on here that keeps you coming back for more, but the coffee starts to interfere a bit with the other flavors about half way through. Still the alcohol is very well hidden, and it's a very drinkable brew."
"Overall, Ballast Point doesn't disappoint. Excellent brew I wish I had regular access too. Thanks Kevin for the chance to try this!"
"D: Incredibly drinkable for this big of a beer. Very delicious, would love to have this one again!"
"Drinkability- Uggghhh... Not bad I suppose. I really love the concept of this beer and I think they are on the right path but something about this just isn't drinkable. The vanilla can get to be a bit much and there is a underlying sweetness that isn't necessarily cloying, but it's a bit much. Also, 10% for this beer is entirely too much. You can taste and feel every bit of it. A fun beer that I'm glad to have been able to try a couple times but make sure you have a friend around because a full bomber is too much."
"My ratings say it all.. Obviously, others didn't like this one as much as I have, but I really don't care about that... At this point in time, at this moment, this was the perfect beer to me.. I couldn't ask for anything more out of a beer than what this one provided... I will definitely be getting this one again and again... It's terrific.."
"One thing I will say for Victory at Sea is that it hides that 10% ABV really well, no alcohol flavor or even warming pops up, and I would not have guessed that this bad boy was this strong. Overall, however, this beer just did not work work for me. Ballast Point is great, and everyone else seems to love this one, but I thought it was a bit over-done."
"A great drinking beer. As it warms, the 10% ABV starts to come out stronger so it becomes a great sipping beer!"
"Overall a superb Impy porter that deserves the hype. Another award winner for Ballast Point. Well done."
"At 10% one of these is great for a very effective nightcap, but I would not want to waste the experience by having any more than two in one night, before moving on to other choices."
"Overall this a great take on the Imperial Coffee Porter and another solid offering from Ballast Point. Thanks again Esther! Recommended."
"Drinkability requires some respect for this sipper. It wasn't hot with alcohol at all. Overall, this beer is just great."
"NOTE: Zach and Jorge both found this beer to be over-the-top and thought it would be much better if it were toned down a bit. Reminiscent of ST Creme Brulee."
"F: Finishes a little bitter, with lots of creamy richness and milk chocolate lingering. The vanilla never seems to go away either. Coffee and oak also linger a bit, with some dark malts. The bitterness of both stout like quality and hints of hops seem to build more and more as I drink more. Overall it delivers just as it promises too, lots of vanilla, coffee, chocolate, roast, creamy goodness, and just overall luscious deliciousness, and hides the abv well with all that."
"I was fairly excited to try this but I'll cut to the chase and say I found this a little too sweet, rich and artificial tasting so I was happy this was being shared. Pours a dark, sludgy near black chocolate with a tan head which barely moves and covers the inside of the glass in sheets. Aroma is actually very pleasant, with little vanilla presence. Primarily a roasted malt, typical porter aroma with a pleasant punch of coffee beans. Unlike the aroma, the flavor begins with a potent vanilla sweetness. Body is very creamy and smooth, low carbonation and chewy finish. The vanilla slowly blends into a strong roast coffee flavor which lingers into a slightly bitter, hoppy burnt finish. Not much porter presence here, or alcohol presence. Not a bad beer, certainly unique, but too sweet and artificial for me to rate this much higher."
"Thick dark molasses and motor oil black body with a leather brown rocky head. The nose is very coffee malted with a hint of vanilla. The palate is very rich with a nice blend, in this order, coffee, vanilla, maple syrup, molasses, oak and another kind of creaminess i can't quite pick up on. There's no detection of alcohol whatsoever. Rich thick full-bodied mouth feel with the desirability to devour more."
"D- this beer is absolutely delicious, I really enjoy all of Ballast Point's offerings that I have had so far. This beer follows suit and is absolutely huge! I love the big coffee flavors and the vanilla is very light but mixes in well with the roasted malts."
"overall- as i said, a great brew, but a bit too much coffee for me. i believe Sea Monster is much better, however, sea monster is a different style, so not a fair comparison."
"Pours a deep rich brown, almost black. Minimal ring of brown head, leaving some lacing. Smell is of medium roast malts with hints of coffee, vanilla, dark fruit and an underlying sweetness. Vanilla scent improves as it warms. Taste is of fresh roasted coffee with a creamy, milky sweetness backed by a nice presence of vanilla. Hints of fruit, chocolate and oak present. As the drink warms, the taste takes on a somewhat vanilla extract type taste, which is one of my few knocks. Nice full body for a porter, encroaching on stout territory with its creamyness and smoothness. Excellent beer which changes drastically as is approaches room temperature. To experience is, I recomended serving below recommended temp and tasting as it warms up."
"A very stellar beer. I had a growler of this from Charleston Beer Exchange in Charleston, SC, but I much prefer the bottled version; typically, it is the opposite for me. Very easy to drink and full bodied with a coffee bite. Simply fantastic!"
"D- This is 10%???? Really??? I thought I was drinking atwater vanilla java porter until the finish. This is a well rounded balanced coffee porter with ABV nearly undetectable."
"Mouthfeel is on the thicker side with moderate to low carbonation. I really enjoyed drinking this one and would definitely buy it again. The vanilla sweetness really helped balance out the bitter coffee and roast flavor making this one stand out from other coffee stouts."
"The aftertaste is the chink in this beer's armor. Otherwise, a good creation by Ballast Point, with the possibility of being wonderful."
"This has got to be one of my favorite beers. Very tasty. It has an awesome head that stays the whole time and is super creamy and leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. It smells of wonderful roasted malty sweet goodness. You can smell the coffee a little bit. Taste is very intense. Lots of flavors going on such as slot of roast and good light vanilla flavor with a smooth coffee roast to it. Mouthfeel is great with great carbonation. Overall it is a sipper because of how intense it is but with a year or more of age on this I can see this beer being even better. Very good"
"ABV is apparent, but never a bother. Definitely a sipper. Very nice beer."
"A very hearty and warming brew. It goes down very quick and very flavorful. This is an excellent beer and I would love to have it again."
"Overall, a very solid beer. I really enjoyed this porter. A big beer and none of the 10% abv showed. Very drinkable for how big it is."
"Great drinkability, as the booze is masked by the preponderance of quality flavors. It comes off as fairly sweet overall, however, which hurts the drink score for me personally. I wouldn't mind if the mouthfeel were thinned a bit by a heavier hand of hops. No matter - this is a solid brew all around."
"song: my brother esau - 10/3/87"
"This is just a silky smooth beer and drinks easily and quickly. I really enjoyed this beer and glad I was able to get a bottle."
"Pours an opaque darkness with a loose full finger tan head that fades quickly, leaving spotty patterns of Belgian lacing. The smell is really nice rich aggressive moderately roasted malt and high quality coffee...as it warms I sense a barrel aged vanilla sweetness. Full flavored, the high quality java notes are the bomb, second only to GI Coffee Stout that I recently had. The toasted malt and classy roast coffee lingers nicely in the after taste like i wish every cup of coffee would. Light-medium body from a lighter carbonation creamy smooth is a classic example of the style...I still really prefer the texture of a stout. This one is going down WAY TOO EASY...no way would I have guessed that this was even half the 10% ABV!! This one is drinking CRAZY!! Perfect accompaniment to the playoffs. Cheers!"
"Glugs into a half liter mug, jet black with a crisply defined line of mocha foam on top. The foam is sticky and leaves tan concentric rings around the edges. As it warms up, the aroma is very chocolate/vanilla like a milkshake. The flavor is also heavy on these notes, seeming like a melted kahlua milkshake on first impression. Some char and bitter coffee elements. Fairly dry and bitter dark chocolate aftertaste. Pretty beefy, one to sip for sure. Luckily there's no hint of 10% in here."
"I'm a little disappointed overall, the taste is too sweet, the vanilla is more prominent than I'd like, and the coffee is too bitter. The bottle states this is an artisinal masterpiece but I disagree. Their IPA's are solid though."
"Lovely opaque black with khaki brown head. Nose is luxurious with layers of vanilla, chocolate ice cream, and a smoky/roasty quality. On the palate the vanilla is really in your face with a smooth roasty character that brings the malt forward, and an espresso/coffee like quality towards the finish and aftertaste."
"Pours a very dark brown color with medium tan head and pretty good lace. Smells of coffee, vanilla, and some creamy malts. Taste is more balanced with flavors of coffee, vanilla, chocolate, and somewhat espresso. Nice creamy mouthfeel with low carbonation. I was very suprised with how big this was and how good it was as well. Excellent beer from Ballast Point Brewing Company"
"Would I buy more of it? - absolutely positively."
"Pours dark brown with a khaki head. The aroma is a mix of strong black coffee with hints of chocolate. The flavor is black coffee with vanilla and some chocolate. The coffee and vanilla merge together very well to make a very good beer. The mouthfeel is very creamy and the carbonation is low."
"Bottle from Boston trip. This is big coffee, and definately flavoured vanilla. The coffee is good, I am not a coffee drinker or fan, but it was done well for what it is. So yes, big in flavour. Above average mouthfeel. Big coffee aroma. Still most quaffable.Black with retaining off-white head."
"Overall, this is pretty good but if they toned down the coffee a bit it could be world class."
"D-One of the most amazing beers out there. I am amazed time and time again how great this beer is after each highly enjoyable encounter with it. Without question, one of my most favorite of brews on the planet!"
"D - One of the best porters ever. Period. Not much more to say about this stellar offering from Ballast Point. If I had to pick between this and Sculpin as the only Ballast Point beer I'd drink for the rest of my life, I'd have a very difficult time choosing. This beer is simply phenomenal."
"M&D - the sweetness lends a decent smoothness, its an easily drinkable beer, hides a double digit ABV as well, nice brew"
"Pours as black and mysterious as the bottom of the sea with a small tan head that sticks around, leaves decent lacing. Not picking up much coffee in the smell, but great scents of vanilla and caramel, and later on some chocolate. Unfortunately the taste is a little lackluster. Mostly a decent coffee taste, a little sweetness, but not much vanilla. A little roasty. But the thing that really kills the taste is the alcohol, it's there up front with every sip, 10% is too high for a porter in my opinion. A little vanilla and caramel is detectable in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is fine for the style. It would be alot better if the alcohol was more hidden. I've had plenty of 10% beers and coffee beers that do it well."
"And of course, the flavours... who could forget? Oatmeal with cream, the same chocolate and perhaps some carob, some black bread toast, lightly burnt, can't ask for much more in this world, anyway... and the faint lingering of the alcohol, the whiskey we sing our songs to every night, raise your flagons, ye dogs! Raise 'em high! We have won another Victory at Sea, me gents!Never Surrender, and take everything! Hahaha! Here's to another Victory at Sea!"
"D: The ABV is well hidden, the sweetness is well balaned, and it goes down smooth - it's certainly not sessionable like a berliner weisse, but I could definitely put a couple bottles of this down without even blinking."
"Overall, this beer is awesome. Lots of chocolate, caramel, vanilla and a good addition of coffee beans. This is probably more of a dessert beer, but a very good one. More than surpassed my expectations. If you can find this, I highly recommend you pick it up. I'm already wishing I had another to drink this week and another two to cellar."
"For an imperial porter, it's excellent."
"Drinkability: Bitter / accidic element of the coffee and roast limits drinkability unless you are big on those elements."
"Firm and rich mouthfeel, slightly tangy, crisp and tingly. Very flavorful and rich, with high drinkability for such a bold beer."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is dangerously high with this one. Overall, I really dig coffee forward beers, and this one might be the best I have ever had. I loved this beer from the moment I opened it. As far as American Porters go, I have yet to find one better. Outstading! Must try! Skal."
"D- Very robust and delicious. The alcohol isnt too noticeable, not with the in your face coffee characteristics of this beer."
"Gotta re-rate with a super freshie bottle someday...I'll buy another bottle if I'm ever in a shop that has some, but I won't be mail ordering or trading for more. Kind of a dissapointment after expecting something world class."
"Overall, this is perfection for a porter and a coffee beer. 5's all around and wishing I had gotten more than one. Time to re-order. I could drink this anytime and anywhere. Highest recommendation and definitely worthy of the hype. Rotation: not avail here in TX so had shipped by Milt. Will get more immediately!"
"Cheers!"
"D: An excellent example of an American Porter. Exceedingly drinkable."
"D - Kinda boozy but i could drink a few cause it tastes so good"
"D- Wow. 10% thats crazy drinkable for that. I would have never known. I bought 4 of these in Illinois and am glad I did."
"All in all, this is a porter that is on the stout borderline, which most good porters are anyways. This is a great brew if you're looking for a good blend of flavor, hoppiness, and smooth drinkability. Awesome brew!"
"D: Very, very drinkable. Quite complex and added yet another tally to the number of amazing vanilla-infused beers that I've had."
"A great brew. Works well as a dessert beer. A true treat worth finding. Coffee lovers will enjoy this one twice as much."
"Very much a stout in most characteristics."
"Pour is black, wet, with a gentle, brown head. Aroma is chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and caramelized sugar, bringing to mind a pastry. Taste is vanilla with a kiss of sweetness. Coffee on the finish rounds it out. Lingering coffee bitterness. More vanilla on the exhale. Feel is thinner than a normal stout but has a stickiness to it; coats the mouth with a bitter, burnt aftertaste. Where is the 10% alcohol hiding?"
"ive really been looking forward to this beer and glad i got to try it...i will pick up a couple more bottle to see how it progresses...a winner in my book"
"D: I think i could have this one everyday and a bomber would go down way to easy"
"Taste of sweet, creamy vanilla, rich chocolate, fresh bitter coffee, burnt wood and a touch of fruity hops. Very tasty, and balanced similarly as the scent. The brewers at Ballast Point can balance the hell out of some strong beer."
"22oz bottle. Black with a medium tan head that leaves moderate foam and a touch of lace. Not inky though with some mahogany around the edges, which I guess is an argument for it being a porter (whatever that means). The aroma is great, with lots of coffee and maybe even more vanilla; almost like a mocha with a shot of vanilla syrup. I'm having Starbucks flashbacks, and I like it. Plenty of milk chocolate as well, and the vanilla aids in the impression of an immense sweetness. Did I already mention the vanilla? I got more coffee at first, but the vanilla is really coming out over time. Forty-five minutes in the glass, and this begins to resemble vanilla extract. I love that stuff. The flavor is sweet, but not thick or sticky (wait, that's a mouthfeel). Coffee, poser dark chocolate, and lots of vanilla. Fresh coffee, which is always a nice touch. Just enough bitterness to balance the sweet, and no astringency or discomfort. Medium-full body with carbonation that falls somewhere between medium and low. Just a hint of alcohol warmth in the finish, but very integrated and smooth for a ten percent beer. Leans more heavily on the coffee, and especially the vanilla, than I was expecting, but this is fantastic stuff. A true dessert drink, (or morning depending on how you roll, and I do have a slight caffein buzz) but one that is not overly sweet or thick. I could drink a fair bit of this, with alcohol being a welcome limiting factor before any abrasive flavor characteristics. Ballast Point just nailed in on this one: full of flavor, yet balanced and super drinkable. The vanilla is almost silly at times, but I love the stuff and it really works with the rest of the beer."
"Medium to full body is well carbonated. Tasty stuff, should age well."
"drinkability: nice"
"Subsequent batches haven't seemed all that world class, but always very good. But they keep selling out very quickly, so they must be doing something right."
"D: This is a dangerously drinkable beer. I didn't really detect any alcohol and it's just such a solid beer that you can't help but keeping going back to it."
"A very well balanced porter, solid all the way through."
"D- This is a rich beer, no doubt. But with the decadent flavors and sublime mouthfeel, probability of gluttony is high!"
"D: Hell yes. I had two glasses of this and I'm tempted to go back for more before the keg kicks. This is a good one. The price point is the only thing keeping me away from drinking myself silly on it."
"d - definitely a sipper and not overly drinkable, the coffee bitterness is fairly hard on the palate, that said, the flavors are interesting and I'd have no problem polishing off a few snifters or a bomber"
"Overall: This beer is great. So complex and good. One of the best I can remember. Ever."
"D: Possibly the best porter I have ever had. Highly recommended."
"Overall, really glad to have finally tried this beer. I'm not too big into coffee beers, but this was an exception. Definitely recommended!"
"D- The sweetness combined with full body and high abv makes this a beer that is not extremely drinkable, but it is definitely good. Overall, a great beer and I had no problem finishing a bomber of. I really liked how it evolved and some of the flavors that came out as it warmed (true of most/all beers, but especially true of this one.)"
"D - Rather high in alcohol at 10% and the alcohol is noticeable in the nose, but not as much in the flavor. Somewhere in the middle of a sipper and a moderately drinkable beer overall. For what it is, it is pretty smooth. A bomber is plenty in one sesson though."
"Overall- A great replacement for coffee at 9am."
"D - Very good. Not sure I'd get a growler fill, but this is amazing as a 22 to sample with friends. Think beer dinner here. Very unique due to the massive coffee flavours, but also finishes sweet enough to get the ladies into it as well. If you are lucky enough to find a bottle of this BUY 2. Also the best label around :)"
"Drinkability: The flavors are bold and the abv is in double digits, but it's delicious tasting with a rewarding mouthfeel."
"D- If this was not so high in alcohol I would of had a bunch more. If the bottles were not so damn hard to come by I would have alot of them in my cellar as I type this. One of the best [porter's that i've ever had and quite a feat for Ballast Point to come up with this recipe. Hey guys, brew some more and send it to the east, we need more for the winter."
"Overall, this is yet another winner from Ballast point. These guys are slowly but surely becoming my favorite San Diego brewers. Their IPAs get all the love and trading attention, but i encourage everyone to branch out and try some of their other offerings, as they are all quite solid, and this one is no exception. For a beer that it would be easy to make a mess of, they have made a gem out of it. Great brew."
"When all is said and done, if you like coffee you'll like this one. I would have preferred a lot less coffee and a lot more of the caramel and vanilla which are supposedly in there. You've heard of hop bombs? This one's a coffee bomb."
"Ha d a bottle of this last summer. The colour was dark brown with no head. The aroma had plenty o' coffee and Madagascar vanilla tones. On the palate, there was a big coffee hit on the front of my palate, then some vanillin after (perhaps the coffee made the vanilla seem more like vanillin??), toffee and caramel helped round off the long finish."
"Chewy silky malt dominated full body with a huge roasted coffee bean presence. Lots of silky chocolate malt and some subtle mellow vanilla notes but the flavor is a bit overpowered by the very intensely strong deep roasted coffee, espresso bean. Hints of oatmeal, toffee, very burnt toast and licorice with a nice dry bitter hop character in the finish. I can't overemphasize how much of a strong burnt/roasted coffee presence there is. It's a bit too harsh for me and extremely bitter, taking away from the silky chocolate and vanilla notes that I liked so much. Alcohol heat mid-palate that becomes stronger at the end of the swallow and produces some warmth in the finish. Pretty complex but a bit one dimensional for me. Recommended for fans of roasted coffee and big coffee beers."
"I'm not really a porter guy from the ones I've had in the past, but this one is just a great beer and I would love to get my hands on some more."
"O: I would order this again, oh wait I bought two bombers! That means I get another tomorrow night! Another solid beer from Ballast Point Brewing Company!"
"M/D - Full bodied and very creamy. Lively carbonation carries the beer through your mouth. Very easy drinking. One of the better coffee beers I have had in a long time and the vanilla provides a very nice sweet match."
"Everything is here for a great porter. Brownish black color with a thin tan head. Almost looks like an imperial stout after it sat in my glass for awhile. Strong vanilla notes in the nose, mixed with a bitter roast and soft chocolate. Taste is a bitter coffee at first with a little coco, but a little past halfway through, the vanilla consumes everything all the way to the finish. A real pleasure to sip on, and is a great addition to their big beer bottle series."
"Solid complex beer."
"I would never guess this to be such a high abv as the alcohol is expertly hidden. My new favorite dessert beer."
"D: I would love to get another bottle of this and enjoy it over an hour or two"
"Drinkability - thanks to amietaj1 for a bottle of this, traded at DLD09. A smooth sipper worth trying fresh and aged if you can get a few bottles."
"D - Very high for an imperial porter at 10% ABV. Overall this is an amazing beer."
"Pours dark as night with no light shining through. Very minimal mocha head. Smells of roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate, a little bit of caramel. Very little vanilla in the smell. The taste is more delicious roasted malt and coffee. A hint of dark fruits as well. The notes of vanilla are very subtle. Will let this one warm up for a bit to let more flavors come out. Mouthfeel is very full-bodied and creamy, with just the right amount of carbonation. Very drinkable, alcohol very well hidden. The only reason it'll take me a bit to drink this one is because I want to let it warm up."
"Pours a dark black color with a 1 finger foamy tan head. The nose on this beer is amazing. Coffee, chocolate, vanilla all stand out and smell wonderful. The flavor does not disappoint, and matches the aroma. This is a smooth, creamy, almost silky beer. The alcohol is a bit high, but this beer is still fantastic, and very drinkable. I picked this up at Friar Tuck Beverage in Springfield, Illinois, during the summer, and am glad I had the chance to try this."
"Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Thick, but not too thick. There's a slight alcoholic burn that makes this a sipper, but very drinkable."
"come and get your YOOHOO!"
"D: Another whopper that doesn't reveal its strength until it is too late. A nice pairing that doesn't skimp on the coffee or the vanilla."
"Conclusion: Not QUITE as much depth as I'd like, but otherwise pretty damn good...we paired this with a chocolate angelfood cake spiced with a touch of cayenne and it was quite nice...as far as big coffee beers go, this is far superior to Jahva IMO and is a bit better than Redhook's as well."
"Carbonation is dialed in just right, with the complexity level in this brew it might be a wee smidge heavy on the mouthbubbles, but personally I'd rather have more carbonation than less. Outstanding drinkability, this is an incredible beer. I hope to age my remaining bottles another 3-6 months and see what happens to this beer with even more time."
"Pours a very nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy tan head, with some very nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, lots of coffee/chocolate/toffee, sweet vanilla. The taste is sweet, malty, nice touch of vanilla, and lots of coffee/chocolate/toffee. Medium body, the ABV is hidden pretty well with this brew. Very drinkable, this one is very tasty. Thanks Bill."
"I'm really happy I finally tried this beer, but I don't think I could drink more than a pint or two. The sweet vanilla really gets to me."
"This was another winner from Ballast Point. I would love to try the BA version of this one. Well worth seeking out if you can still find it."
"Victory At Sea Coffee Vanilla Imperial Porter is my second favorite Ballast Point offering, behind the outrageously delicious hop bomb known as Sculpin IPA. I will do whatever it takes to acquire additional bombers. When I do, they won't be taken away from me by angels or by demons, heaven or hell. Highly recommended."
"Thanks kmurray8621!"
"Drinkability: I knock it slightly as I couldn't imagine drinking much more than I did of it as far as a pint goes, it's simply a little too filling. On the enjoyability, however, fantastic, and well worth seeking out. Looking forward to having this in the future aged in the bottle as well and see how it matures."
"Overall this was a very good Imperial Porter. I have to say I didn't get a whole lot of coffee flavors out of this, but the beer did just fine without them. Worth a shot."
"Would definitely buy again and very much recommend."
"I have had this beer twice now. Purchased my first growler at the Charleston Beer Exchange several months ago and immediately decided that it was the best beer I'd ever had. A second growler purchased roughly a week ago reaffirmed my first impression. This is a high gravity porter with a complex flavor. The nose is heavy on the vanilla with a strong presence of alcohol. The taste is pure coffee initially, it's only after your tongue is coated that the vanilla kicks in. Deep, dark black with a khaki head, wonderful aroma, excellent taste, velvety mouthfeel. As far as drinkability goes, this beer is as rich as it is delicious and should be enjoyed slowly and sparingly."
"Drinkability: I enjoyed this one. It's about as smooth as a man with a pencil-thin mustache. The listed ABV% was never an issue at all."
"Pours a deep and opaque black, some ruby red highlights, thick tan head forms, drops down to a thin ring around the glass, some lacing sticks, and great retention. Smell is real nice, vanilla and chocolate, caramel, burnt sugar, dark fruit, milk, lactose sweetness, honey/nougat, touch of coffee roast, really rich. Taste is similar, very nice, vanilla up front, toffee, lactose sweetness, burnt brown sugar, chocolate and some coffee roast, dark fruit/raisins, very malty, nougat finish, touch more roast in the back. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, low to medium carbonation, some warmth going down but ABV is well hidden. Awesome beer, reminds me of an imperial version of Aphrodisiaque from DDC. Thanks guys!"
"22oz. Poured near-black with a light brown head that left decent lacing on the glass. Aromas were of bold coffee, roasted grains, vanilla, chocolate, and maybe some oak. Mouth-feel was medium bodied. Tastes were bold up-front coffee and roasted malts with notes of dark chocolate and vanilla. Also some hints of fruity esters - maybe some ripe dark fruits, although fairly faint. Alcohol was present, but balanced well with the flavors. Finished sweet with a lingering of sweet cocoa and espresso. Basically, this was a good interpretation of going with something different and thinking outside of the box. Worth the try if you can find it."
"drinkability is great. excellent balance. the alcohol feels a bit warm at first, but it mellows out as it warms. nice depth and complexity. love the coffee and vanilla, really complimenting the base beer. vanilla is often overdone, but this one is just right to me. great stuff."
"Drinkability: Imperial Porter? You know it! Filled with coffee? You bet your ass it is! Vanilla? Sure, I'll give them that one. Delicious? Yep! This beer is a must have for all of you coffee drinkers or the type of people who enjoy a delicious craft beer. I wish I had bought more than one bottle of this great beer. Well, live and learn."
"D: After letting it warm just a bit more, it was much easier to drink because the alcohol edge seemed to mellow. For a 10% big flavored beer like this, it still disappears faster than you would expect."
"medium body, ever so slightly thin, with syrupy smoothness at first, then lots of acidity and some astringent texture. moderate carbonation gives tingle upfront, then back off to help give body."
"Drinkability? I'm not going to kid anyone and say I could drink this all night long but hell, it *is* damn drinkable for the strength of this monster and I think the collaberation between the vanilla and coffee works oh so well. A real treat to drink and one I'd look forward to trying again. Wonderful brew!"
"D: Something about porters make me struggle... but this one was rather remarkable..."
"I like this beer. I really did. It's really all over the place though, and I feel like I can find much more cohesive restrained examples of the style that drink much better. Worth trying for sure."
"Drinkability is ok. This is definitely an ""extreme"" beer, in that all the flavor notes are really huge and kind of battle it out for dominance instead of syncing up and trying to work with each other. A hair less vanilla and a bit less on the bitterness scale and this one would work quite a bit better. As it is now, it's a nice beer, but it really takes no prisoners."
"Mouthfeel is viscuous, heavy, chewy, with mild bitterness found in the swallow."
"The taste is really nice and very robust. Huge roasted malts, primarily chocolate. A nice vanilla accent really plays a nice supporting role. Fairly creamy for a porter, which is a little bit discerning. Very sweet, some licorice flavors prevail on the end of this beer. Again, the roasted malts are absolutely phenomenal, but the sweetness is really bugging me out a little bit and is taking away from my appreciation. I'm very glad I got to try this beer, but don't know how regularly I could drink it."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy and smooth but with big alcohol puffs too. This is a bold brew and a bit too sweet for me, but it's a good bomber to share with a friend or two as drinking the whole thing to yourself would be a bit too much. Thanks to emerge for this one."
"This is a good brew not to spectacular I had better in this hybrid style. It is worth the try and I would not turn it down that is for sure. I killed the bomber with no problem with brunch myself so drinkability is fine"
"D: Good, I rather enjoyed it."
"This beer pours a deep brown, almost black with a 3/4 inch of brown head which recedes very quickly. Not much lacing to speak of with this one. Nose is of strong coffee, perhaps the strongest scent of coffee in a beer that I've come across, deep roasted malts, slight chocolate, caramel, and notes of vanilla are present. Taste starts of with a big coffee pop that slides in to roasted malts and chocolate, finish is more sweet with caramel, toffee and vanilla, as the beer warmed it got a bit boozy in the taste as well. Mouthfeel is full bodied, not much carbonation, creamy body with a dry finish. This is a decent beer - watch out for the abv kick, it'll catch up with you!"
"Poured a deep, deep brown with a tannish head. Nose is sweet, lots of vanilla and chocolate but the coffee plays a backseat and it worked well. Taste is vanilla, cocoa, roasted malt, chewy, a tad nutty with coffee in the background. Mouthfeel is creamy and rich in the mouth. Tasty, well balanced, the ABV is well hidden and this is a great brew in every area. Ballast Point is becoming one of my fav breweries for great beers like this."
"Lots of powdered chocolate in the flavor. Sweet and bitter from the malt. Rich body with a relatively low level of carbonation. Almost chewy. The aftertaste is complicated: Notable hop bitterness with some dark chocolate malt and sweet milky flavor. Deceptively high in alcohol."
"Drinks very easy for the style & ABV, not the best coffee beer I've ever had, but probably top 3. Worth seeking out, nice brunch beer!"
"Wow - this is a great example of both the style and the imperial nature of a big beer. It's strong enough to show all its colors but not so over-the-top that it hits like a sledgehammer. Having said that, it's a big pour and I will probably savor it over a couple of hours in a self-preservation move, 'cause this horse kicks wicked hard (Edit: I changed my mind. Warm this up and it drinks wayyy too quickly for its weight class.). Very well-constructed effort from the crew that brought us Sculpin."
"This beer has a nice balance to it, between the vanilla notes and sweetness up front and the roasted, biting notes towards the finish, but it can seem a little simplistic at times. The vanilla really helps this beer shine; the roast malt and coffee notes would be too aggressive, too acrid and too bitter without the vanilla. This is definitely a nice after dinner sipping brew and I find that I am quite enjoying it."
"Review #900! 22oz bottle into a Duvel snifter pours a nearly opaque black with a nice lasting frothy light tan head that leaves great lacing on the glass. Aroma is fresh ground coffee up-front with plenty of brown malts, cocoa and a hint of vanilla. The taste is a nice blend of fresh coffee and brown malts and chocolate, quite intriguing as many coffee porter's don't tend to pull the balance off like most coffee stouts, this one is certainly an exception! The beer is medium bodied with the 10% ABV very well hidden. This is a truly special beer, I'm very glad to have Ballast Point available in this area and look forward to trying more of their beers!"
"D: Amazingly drinkable for a beer this big. Very nice all around."
"D: Solid beer but more like a stout than a porter."
"This is no standard Am. Porter. It's intense and interesting. Maybe a little overpowering but very good."
"Pours a rich thick black with a heavy brown head. The aroma is sweet, lots of vanilla and chocolate. As for the coffee I feel like it is somewhat missing, just slightly there. I feel the same way about the taste. The chocolate and coffee were fighting it out and the chocolate is winning. They just weren't working together like they should. Very creamy and rich in the mouth. Good flavors and complex but I don't think it completely worked. I had to pass my glass onto someone else it just was too sweet for me, maybe would have been better after a meal."
"Man, oh man! This beer claims to be robust and it delivers. The immense coffee and chocolate flavors make me almost forget that I'm drinking a beer. My only real knock against this brew is that the thick body took away from the drinkability, ever so slightly. All in all though, if you like sweet beers, get this if you can find it!"
"Picked up a bomber at Abe's Cold Beer in Bethlehem, PA. Poured pitch black in my glass with a tan head. Right away in the aroma I'm hit by what becomes the most striking feature of this beer - fresh ground coffee beans. This beer doesn't smell or taste of brewed coffee, instead it's like you've just roasted beans into a coffee machine. Frankly I think this is actually more complex and pleasing. The vanilla quickly joins the coffee to smooth the flavor out and there's a touch of chocolate malt in the background. Man, if you like coffee beers, this one's for you. I'd have liked a little more depth of flavor, but it was fairly drinkable for the strength and a tasty after-dinner treat."
"Ballast Point makes some incredible beer and Victory at Sea is no slouch either. The coffee, roast and vanilla make for a luscious libation. I'd love another couple bottles. Thanks for the hook up Heath!"
"overall this beer is world class sorry KBS, breakfast stout, and peche mortel but this beer owns you A++"
"Drinking the 2010 winter release, I can say that my review is the same, but I have to dial down my scores a bit to reflect how I feel about this beer."
"Medium body, good amount of carbonation. Alcohol very well hidden. Very nice here."
"D--Easy to put away the bomber, extremely drinkable for an ""imperial"" anything. Solid beer overall, not my favorite porter by any means but it is so well rounded that I can't help but give it a very high score."
"It is now fall and I'm enjoying this fine beverage that I set aside. I still get a hint of chocolate and caramel in there, but the main difference over the past year has been that the coffee has faded. In addition to that, the vanilla flavor has really become prominent. It still tastes phenominal and I still love this beer! Cheers!"
"Pours black with a tan head. Nose is tight vanilla and coffee. But mostly coffee. Flavor is sweet coffee tones. Almost like you added that faux creamer to your coffee. A bit too sweet IMO, but it does still work quite nicely. Feel has a biting carbonation on the mouth and the liquid is thicker on the body. Overall a good stout. Robust and ripe with character. Though I feel the vanilla is coming on just a bit too much. It'll be interesting to see how this reacts as it warms up."
"This is a very good porter with some very bold flavors and aromas, dominated by the coffee but with the vanilla reallyl coming through in the taste. Great beer."
"Purchased a bomber at Bauer for $9.99. Poured into a stemmed crystal glass. Dark brown color, bordering on black. Large leather brown head. Significant lacing. Thick body, not a lot of carbonation noticed. Smell was a wonderful combo of coffee and chocolate. Taste was a knock out. Borderline perfect. Had that chocolate and roasted barley flavor of a nice porter, but the addition of the high end coffee was killer. Then, the vanilla was just enough in the background to lend a bit of flavor, but didn't overwhelm at all. A great compliment to the intended flavor profile. Outstanding flavor. Mouthfeel was stout-like, very heavy and hearty. Much more than a porter. Not a beer to session with, but a beautiful beer to have with dessert or have as a sweet treat by itself. A bit more expensive than what I spend normally on a bomber, but well worth it. Puts Ballast Point up there with the big boys in my mind."
"Without a doubt this is the best vanilla porter I have had to date. The vanilla is present, but is secondary to the rich smokey flavor of an intense porter. Big, but balanced sweetness and coffee bitterness. Alcohol comes on a little hot and boozy, but for me that adds to character. This is one to try."
"This is a must try for anyone."
"Wow. This is everything that I wanted the Southern Tier Creme Brulee to be. Pours very dark brown in color with a nice half inch of tan head. Smell is wonderful. Perfect amount of vanilla, working with the roasted coffee notes. Smells decadent. Taste follows up with the nose. Perfectly balanced vanilla and roasted coffee beans. A wonderful porter underneath supporting these flavors. I would like the mouthfeel a tad thicker, but I'm not going to complain about this one at all. Don't think I could drink an entire bomber of this, but it's damn tasty. Very good beer."
"Taste is the same as the smell but better. Lots of vanilla to back up the coffee. Sweet as hell in a great way, dense and rich and creamy. Smooth, almost like an oatmeal stout; I'm still amazed this is a porter. A damn fine beer soon to be added to my wants list."
"We've started to get the regular Ballast Point line in Illinois, but I'm anxiously awaiting the day that we can get the special limited releases (Sculpin, Sea Monster, etc.)."
"Pours a solid black with a thinnish mocha head that sticks around for a bit. Smells of coffee right off, layers of vanilla, milk chocolate, and roasted grain hidden in there as well. Taste is like a half and half milkshake. Lots of milk chocolate and vanilla mix up front followed by some coffee and a lingering roasted coffee and chocolate finish. Full bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and light carbonation. Great Porter, maybe a bit on the sweet side, but certainly very tasty. Call it a desert porter."
"Overall this was a very unique beer, that falls squarely into the dessert category. I was very happy, and very suprised with how big this was and how good it was as well. A winner here for sure!"
"Very drinkable big porter, love the great vanilla and coffee balance. I think this is the first really good vanilla flavored beer I have come across, of course with ballast points quality this is of no surprise."
"Poured a dark black color with a small sized off white head. Aromas of coffee, vanilla, chocolate, and some nuttiness. Tastes of vanilla/vanill beans, chocolate, coffee, and some roastiness. Alcohol content overall well hidden. Body was thick and oily."
"I'm gonna buy more."
"Highly recommended. Great on its own, great barrel aged, etc."
"I loved this beer. I am going to pick up a couple of more bottles to enjoy it before it is gone."
"22 oz. Nearly black pour, cream colored head with a small amount of bubbly lacing. Aromas roast malt, hints of woody vanilla. Tastes similarly with much more assertive vanilla, coffee and some caramel. A little bourbon like booziness, but not bad at all. Definetely a sipper right now. Close to creamy mouthfeel. I bet this will age very nicely. Been very impressed with Ballast Point, this one did not disappoint."
"Pours out a pitch black color, barely letting any light through, maybe some highlights of dark brown. The head is huge, 2-3cm, brown with tight, dense bubbles that continue popping from the top of the head, lslowly leaving a little ring of bubbles around the edge which leaves some lacing on the glass. The smell is primarily coffee, with some vanilla notes. There's also some very strong dry, fruity esters coming to my nose, nice but not quite as robust as I expected. Wow, the tastes comes through in so many ways. Upfront I notice the coffee, not bitter, but full of flavor, also quite a bit of chocolate underneath the coffee. The vanilla shines through with a bit of a the esters, reminds me of dark plums, a little tart and dry with the taste of the flesh as well. I can sense some caramel sweetness underneath the dryness, and they seem to compete, making this one very interesting. I can't really detect the alcohol, but it slowly warms, making the experience better. Really a great tasting beer. The beer is pretty full, but it oscillates between a kind of slick estery feel and a thick syrupy feel, and I'm really not sure how I feel about the dryness once I get quite a way through this. The carbonation is spot on for the style, I'm a fan. The alcohol will slow you down, but the whole drink is enjoyable, and I'd recommend buying it if you see it. I'm kind of torn, I really love the flavors, but something about the dryness kept me from being in love with it."
"Great stuff!"
"Overall: I absolutely loved this beer and was probably my favorite of the night. This is a can't miss beer that every beer lover should try. Cheers!"
"Got this one by mail order and couldn't wait to try it. This is the 10% version, part of the Robust series. It pours a dark dark brown, almost black, with two fingers of light brown lumpy head. Plenty of tan lacing. Smells strongly of coffee, roasted malt, a touch of smoke, and a touch of vanilla. Tastes pretty much as it smells: coffee, roasted malt, a touch of smoke, and a hint of vanilla. A bit more smoke than vanilla, actually, but that's not a criticism. This is a damn tasty porter with a lot of complexity going on. Carbonation was just a touch low for my tastes, but it was silky smooth and that's not a bad thing, either. Really, there's nothing to complain about and lots to praise with this beer. A real keeper."
"Edit - 2/8/10 - Got to have this again, yum."
"D: Easily drinkable, has some bitterness that lingers a bit as an aftertaste, but overall, very drinkable. Almost dangerously so."
"Low carbonation at first and a bit syrupy in the finish."
"Thanks again to stevemcqueenjr for sharing this rare treat. The label on this bottle is awesome (a skeleton at the helm). 22oz. bottle served in my Gouden Carolus chalice. Poured one shade shy of black. No head, just a few bubbles and a thin, bubbly band wound around the bowl of the glass. Reddish-brown highlights were revealed at the base when held up to the light. Nose is roasted coffee/espresso upfront with a hint of vanilla in the back. Taste is char, roast and coffee followed by some vanilla and toffee/butterscotch. Some bitterness lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and lightly effervescent. Nice complexity with a slightly burnt quality. This is a really nice offering from Ballast Point, but there's just a little too much char and bitterness in the mix that impacts the drinkability."
"Looks like there are two entries for the same beer. The other one has the word Vanilla in the name, though they're the same beer. That's too bad."
"D: Definitely a night cap type of beer here, a bomber is plenty and probably best shared. Could be a nice dessert beer, perhaps with something to help match its cloying coffee and vanilla. Interesting porter worth checking out."
"Nice creamy mouthfeel. One 22 oz'er will be enough for a while. I am going to let this age for a year ... or two ... and let the coffee mellow a bit."
"i seriously could drink this all night, it goes down uber smooth! this is really a fantastic beer! i keep having to remind myself this is a porter too, i keep expecting that big stout finish, but i'm very happy with this!"
"D - I could drink this all night assuming I had a nice meal before. Not something you want to do on an empty stomach."
"Big thanks to Scott for the opportunity. Label on the cap of the growler states 10% abv. Pours black with a nice large creamy tan head that slowly recedes. Aroma is a nice roastiness, very earthy and slightly nutty, a bit of chocolate sweetness, and a tangy porter acidity. Taste follows with a nice coffee and cream flavor, earthy roasted malts, some cola and root beer like sweetness and a touch of vanilla, just a hint of alcohol in the drying hoppy finish as well. Mouthfeel improves greatly as the beer warms, becomes much more creamy which suits the flavor well. Body is medium in weight, some pepperiness and a drying finish. A very good beer, really hard to believe the 10 or 12% as it is very well hidden/balanced. The flavor and mouthfeel were also considerably better nearer to room temp. Earthiness was nice and any sweetness was subtle which helped the drinkability. Thanks Scott!"
"Overall: This one of the best coffee porters I've ever had. I would compare this porter to abyss is a stout."
"Pours black with brown edges, and a short, bubbly tan head. Spotty lacing. Fresh-brewed strong coffee aroma with roasted (and slightly burnt) chocolate malt. Some vanilla and cream as well. Big coffee taste. Strong and black, wtih the malt taking just a little off the edge. Creamy middle, with the vanilla and some caramel poking through, giving it a melted milkshake taste. Reverts to a bitter coffee finish. The mouthfeel is deceiving. Its appropriate for the style, but the taste makes you want something a little thicker."
"On tap at the brewery during RBSG 08. Darkest brown with a creamy cocoa head that leaves a bunch of lacing. Nice roasty nose with milk chocolate and vanilla. Intense iced coffee with a roasty bitterness, some earthy herbal hops, chocolate sweetness. Excellent beer."
"Did not like it as much as the syrah barrel version I tasted at the anniversary party but it was still very good, one of the better coffee porters out there mainly because of its balance in flavor, would definitely drink more in the future, certainly recommended"
"D- I imagine this warming up the soul by a fireplace, while it snowing outside. Luckily I live in San Diego, so I can drink this one on a 70 degree ""winter"" day. I love this beer. My favorite coffee porter by far."
"D: Meh. Delicious, but not too much due to the strength of the alcohol."
"On tap at Stone Bistro, served in an 8oz snifter. Poured a pitch black with a thick tan sticky head. The aroma was the most coffee I've ever smelled in a beer and that is compared to Kona Pipeline Porter and Founders Breakfast Stout. It's just a pure roasted coffee aroma. The taste is the same, cold rich coffee and a dark malt backing which is overshadowed by the coffee."
