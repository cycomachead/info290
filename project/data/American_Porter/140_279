Great to purchase as part of a variety pack and to keep in the fridge for that random weeknight when you want a good porter to complement dinner.

A good introduction for those new to beers with well-roasted malts since the bittersweetness and roastiness is definitely present and actually the primary feature of the beer, but does not overwhelm the palate. I'm more of a stout guy than a porter guy, but I definitely enjoyed this one and need to study this style a little more!","enjambed","Nov 14, 2014"

Sometimes I like it when a beer gets me thinking it is going to be one way with the aroma, and then changes lanes (Either good or bad). This drinks smooth and I could drink this pretty much all day. I like Robust and Roasted brews. But with all the other Porters out there this one is solid yet not adventurous. This brew is worthy.","Shroud0fdoom","Aug 19, 2014"

Decent amount of lacing is seen. The aroma is of roasted malts, coffee with a hint of hazelnut as well. Very nice. The taste has more going on with the roasted malt coming through with a hint of caramel and toffee and hazelnut coffee even. Pretty smooth to drink with no bitter or harsh aftertaste.

Down to the last third now and lacing is very nice, retaining all the way from the top of the glass down to the liquid itself. An earthy, malty smell. Mouthfeel is very smooth, similar to a brown ale, some smokey flavors coming through on the taste as well as some chocolate and coffee.

3.9,0.3,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 2/20/2013. Pours lightly cloudy reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, chocolate, toast, brown bread, toffee, floral, roast, light coffee, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt notes with moderate earthy hops; and good strength. Taste of caramel, chocolate, toast, toffee, brown bread, roasted malt, light coffee, floral, and herbal earthiness. Fair amount of earthy hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, chocolate, toast, toffee, brown bread, roast, and hop earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of dark/roasted malt with moderate earthy hops; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice porter style. All around nice balance of malt and hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 19, 2013"

3.75,-3.6,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Foamy whitish brownish head. Smells a bit hoppy and cocoa. Taste is a tad bitter and maybe even thin. I expected more a of Guinness mouth feel to the porter. Basically, I was standing in Publix looking at the beers and desperate for something, anything different and since I like Sierra Nevada, I thought I would give their porter a try. It's not a bad pour and I would buy it again but probably in the winter. It's a bit too heavy for the summer heat. I paired it up with an organic summer sausage and it complemented the porky fattiness of the sausage well.","RHWeir","Jul 11, 2013"
3.72,-4.4,4,3.25,4,3.5,3.75,"Color: A translucent dark brown with a vaguely off-white bubbly head. Seems to be some carbonation, however the retention and lacing is not so good. The aroma is a bit off - some kind of vegetal astringency is present. Otherwise some milk chocolate and a faint hint of flowers. The taste, however is somewhat soft, with a pleasing brown sugar, caramel, oak, and molasses flavor. Lots of grains and even a very light citrus hop profile. The beer has a very light, sessionable body and the finish has a lasting fade to it. Good balance. Not a bad purchase if you're looking for a low ABV Porter.","Neorebel","Jul 08, 2013"

4.08,4.9,4.25,4.25,4,4,4," The taste begins with roasted malt flavor like coffee with nuttiness and dry dark roasted character with mild sweetness in the middle augmenting with subtle fruity taste from the yeast which has a slight spice from the hops which adds a peppery complexity w/ nice chocolate accents in the dark malt profile with a mild woody element in the back. This is a classic porter as advertised -very delicious and drinkable -I love how balanced it is yet still presents a nice amount of hops with dark malt the star. One of the better west coast examples of the style.","Slatetank","May 16, 2013"

This has the potential to be an amazing beer but it needs a little tinkering. There is an extremely strong chocolatey taste to it, so much so that it almost overpowers the other flavors. As a chocolate lover, this still makes for a delicious beer, but a little less chocolate would allow the hops and malts to come through more powerfully. The chocolate itself is a little too chalky and sweet. If the brewers replaced it with a more subdued and silky dark chocolate, this porter would be perfect.","JesseMurdock","Apr 14, 2013"

3.65,-6.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Taste is a really smooth, faint hit of dark chocolate up front that slides back into a finish that reveals much more of a hop presence than the aroma would indicate. In the middle of the whole thing is a bit of bite that black coffee has, but it integrates well with the aforementioned initial dark chocolate note and the finishing earthy hops. Carbonation is pretty damn high; at times this almost feels like the unquestionably amazing Pale Ale. I won't say that this is a bad thing, per se, but it's definitely a bit much for a porter. Nevertheless, the body is a medium-light hybrid, and it goes down really smoothly without falling prey to one-dimensionality.","Tomhet","Jan 04, 2013"

The mouthfeel is lighter than expected, a medium/light body, the thick head adds to the body but when that is gone the body seems ligther. A little bit heavier and this would be spot on.

If I want a hop dominant beer, I'll grab an IPA or strong ale... why you'd do this to a porter is beyond me. As a beer it's good. As a porter, it fails. This is closer to a CDA than anything.","TheSixthRing","May 25, 2012"

I've tried the Anchor Porter as well and while that one was good, SN's porter brought more to the table in terms of what I expected a good porter to taste like. I'm used to Keystone and Bud Light, so this is shaping up to be a very interesting brew exploration experience for me to say the least.","12stepCornelius","May 01, 2012"

3.31,-14.9,4.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Overall I thought this was an OK beer and it was a slightly above average American Porter. It had most of those good porter flavors but it wasn't as robust as some of my favorites and the hops were a little heavy for a Porter. This beer had OK drinkability, I could probably go for another one but after that I would be ready to move on to something different. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance, it was a very good looking Porter. What I liked least about this beer was that the malts weren't robust enough to overpower the hops and the high amount of carbonation needed to be toned down a little. I might buy this beer again, but in the wide world of Porters this one doesn't stick out that much, but it was well priced. If you love Porters this is worth a try but I don't think that this beer will knock your socks off. To me this beer falls in the middle when it comes to American Porters, there was nothing too out of place, but to me the flavors didn't come together as well as they do in some of the better Porters. I am glad I finally tried this beer, but it's not that memorable of a Porter.","StoutHunter","Jan 17, 2012"

3.78,-2.8,4,3.5,4,3,4,"A somewhat thin, highly carbonated porter. But, the flavor is excellent overall. Not as dark and opaque as many porters. This has a semi-transparent brown/ruby color. Lots of bubbles dissipate the head rather quickly. Smells of coffee, semi-sweet dark chocolate, cocoa, rich toasty malt and slight hops. Mouthfeel is a bit slight, but it packs good flavor. Spiky, coarse carbonation. Raisiny chocolate, powdery cocoa with a dry hops finish and lingering malt presence. Some coppery flavors appear in the aftertaste department, but the malty richness makes this beer rewarding overall. I'd like to try this on tap, but I have never seen it except in bottles. A very good beer. Sierra never really falters in my experience.","MNJR","Jan 17, 2012"

This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty solid porter that is easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","Dec 09, 2011"

4.33,11.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Some of these rolled into the liquor store at Mairiano's grocery store, so I tried these again. Pours out a dark brown color, very rich mahogany but not black. Beer has a nice sticky brown head. The smell is rich chocolate malt, with some dark toffee. No detectible hops in the nose but all roasty malt. The taste is more roasty malts, and lots of chocolate malts. Not as hoppy as I would expect from a SN brew, would think there would be a bigger Cascade presence but that's okay...I actually feel this is a more authentic interpretation of the style. The taste brings more sweet chocolate malts too; probably because there is no big bitter hop aftertaste. Anyway, the mouthfeel is full and rich. Overall this is a somewhat unique offering from SN in that the chocolate malts really shine through. Although I look forward to trying their other darker beers again, i.e Tumbler, and their hoppier Stout.","Star80","Aug 17, 2011"

I prefer Anchors porter when it comes to APs, but I have to take this one seriously, its too good to look over. I gave it a 3.5 on A&S, I felt the nose and look were not that impressive, I've seen that bubbly brown too much which is kind of rude considering this has a "True Porter Color," also the nose was very unimpressive.

4.22,8.5,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Poured a deep brown, nearly black, with strong deep reddish hue. Started with a strong off-white head that leaves ample wet lacings and reduces to a full cap throughout. Sweet chocolate and toasted malt aromas. Medium bodied with rich carbonation in the middle that push the hop flavors through. Taste mirrors the aroma in the beginning, sweet chocolate and toasted malt that lead to a light coffee flavor. Once the hint of coffee hits the carbonation rolls though, pulling the citrus flavors forward. A slightly dry finish. Does Sierra Nevada make a beer that isn't dangerously drinkable?","IronLover","Feb 01, 2011"
4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"D - Very pleasant example of an American porter, which would work well on its own or as a session beer.","Wattsox","Jan 29, 2011"
3.95,1.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"A pretty good, if simple, porter. Pours deep dark brown with red highlights and a quickly dissipating head. Cocoa aroma. Cocoa, malty and burnt sugar flavors with a hint of orange. Somewhat over-carbonated. Crisp clean finish. No particular outstanding characteristics, but overall a good offering. Would drink it again, but not necessarily chase after it.","CountJustinian","Jan 18, 2011"
3.71,-4.6,4,3,4,3.5,4,"Sierra Nevada Porter pours a full black, with plentiful ruby highlights coming through when the beer is backlit. The bone colored head rises to three fingers in height, but doesn't hold up for very long. Several nice looking rings of lacing are left clinging to the side of the glass. The nose is fairly straightforward, lots of coffee and roasted malts. The beer could stand to be a little more aromatic though. There's a bit more to this beer though, as a hint of dark chocolate joins coffee in the intro. The dry roasted malt middle begins to come across as unpleasantly astringent to me. It's joined by a small but noticeable hop bitterness that leads into a very nice subtle orange-citrus close. The boy is somewhat light for the style, a reflection of just how dry it is. Given that, I think it's just a little overcarbonated for a relatively malt driven beer, the end result being the hops maybe elevated to too prominent a place (moreso in the bitterness fueling any sense of acridity mid palate). Overall Sierra Nevada Porter is a solid offering, but not my favorite American porter.","axeman9182","Jan 14, 2011"

4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Brilliant ruby edges painted on the nearly black beer; lacing is nothing less than superb. Chocolate, toasted bread and earthy hop in the aroma. Tight, crisp package. Dry malt palate for the most part; roasty, with mocha and over-toasted bread. Hops are there to balance, and that is what they do--of course, there is some flavor in tow with hints of earth, wood and citrus rind. Roasty malt finish; a note of alcohol makes its mark as well. This is definitely a go-to Porter.","BeerAdvocate","Jan 10, 2011"

4.14,6.4,5,3.5,4,4,5,"Pours a deep translucent brown with a very compact, good-looking, fluffy egg-white head. Head retention is very strong; lacing is full and gorgeous. Smell is malty; chocolate-covered cherries, or raisins, and something mildly astringent in the background. Body is medium, a little lighter than some other porters I've had, and the journey across the palate is very smooth. Starts with a mild nettling, then blends over into a slick, easy-going charred chocolate middle, and a mild, but drying finish. A sort of burnt-cola aftertaste. It doesn't strike me as terribly complex, but everything here is very well balanced and this is extremely drinkable.","bfflo","Jan 09, 2011"

This is a very easy drinking porter with an even blend of hop bitterness and roast. Both qualities offset malt and chocolate sweetness well. I believe Sierra Nevada intended for nice quaffer here, and that's what they got. The vegetal aroma may not be detectable to some.

The nose is composed of roasted, toasted malts, caramel, puffed rice, and a tiny bit o' funk. Bootsy would be proud, but only a li'l bit. Oh well. The roasted malt aspects come through on the tongue as well, along with some walnut, toffee, and a very slight stripe of floral bitterness. It all makes for some very tasty porter-y goodness.

A lot of roasted malt flavor in the taste, but with pleasing amounts of piney hop bitterness mixing in.

It's a nice, dark brown with some translucence around the edges; pours with a rocky, tan head (what is about the awesome head with SN beers?). Aroma is of roasted malts, with a touch of coffee and caramel - there's also a little earthiness from the hops. Taste is burned caramel up front with some slight roastiness, followed by a pleasant, low-key citrus hop bite. Mouthfeel is a shade under medium-bodied. A good porter, that I could enjoy a few of. Its almost like a little brother to Sierra's Stout (which I guess would be true to style) - a little less roasty / more sweet, with a lighter body.","jpro","Apr 08, 2010"
2.93,-24.7,4.5,1.5,3,4,3.5,"The feel is pretty spot on for a single porter. While the liquid looks semi thin and watery, the feel is lucious smooth medium, that goes down with ease. Just enough roast to stick it to the tastebuds, but not overly done. The carbonation is on the light side and it works for this particular porter's size and body. I don't think i'll go for this one again, the smell was yucky the taste was bearable, while the feel was the best part. Much more exciting porters out there in the market.","BARFLYB","Apr 04, 2010"

A little lacking in the flavor profile, but fairly easy drinking; just not what I usually look for in a porter.","Jwale73","Jan 13, 2010"

The taste is big and bold for such a low abv, roasted barley malt, supreme blend coffee, milk chocolate wafers and finished with a nice bitter punch from the big hop presence.

4.18,7.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Poured it into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass. This beer pours dark brown with dark red/amber highlights on the edges when held to the light. Dark and deep enough that you can't see through it clearly. This beer produces a huge tan colored head that only takes a few minutes to go away, but produces some pretty generous lacing and stick to the glass. The smell is very good. The hops are present, but I'd say that roasted malts and coffee flavors come out first followed by the hops. The taste goes in a bit of a different order in my opinion. It's really important that this beer touches every part of your tongue, because there's a lot of flavor in this beer. For some reason, no matter what I tasted a quick taste of the hops, but it was immediately followed by the roasted malts and coffee flavor. The second portion is smooth and sweet from the caramelized roasted malts. You can taste roasted coffee beans as well right behind the malts. The bitter finish comes from the hops, not too strong, but certainly noticeable, citrus if I'm not mistaken. This is I'd say a medium bodied beer. This is a very drinkable beer, putting the fact that it's a porter aside, very drinkable. Great brew from Sierra Nevada.","AndyAvalanche","Nov 19, 2009"

Pours a rich dark brown, with a tan head and lacing visible even inside of the bottle. The smell was the highest point here, full of roasted malts and bitter chocolate, and even tones of burnt hops with a slight tinge to it. The flavor was an intense mix of roasted malts, coffee and chocolate notes, with a slightly smoky bitter and rich coffee-like aftertaste. Warming, moderate body with just the right amount of carbonation, and it goes down extremely well, making for an excellent beer that can be enjoyed in all seasons, whether grilling in the summer or in front of a fireplace at the holidays.

Mouth is light and a bit creamy if you get some of the head. Its extremely sessionable.. though it could serve to have a slightly more robust flavor, the light presence of flavor lends itself to a very high drinkability.

A straight tan head sits on top of a coal black brew with no light shining through. Head recedes at a quickened pac. A few thing lines of lace are left. Aroma is subtle with sweet malts rising first, then some faint roasted nuts and maybe a splash of honey and pine. I'm going to stop there as not to try and seek something that is not there. All in all, its not as bold as expected. Let's move on. Tastes sweet and malty up front with a nice little hit of hops following up quickly. Some black coffee and a hint of pine finish it up. Carbonation is big, and keeps everything lighter than usual on the palate. Mouth-feel lies somewhere between medium and heavy, but it goes down pretty easy.

Had a slight bitter aftertaste that also hung around awhile. When pouring it almost looked thick. Felt good ih the mouth. I thought the carbonation was right. I would buy again.

The aroma is of dark roasted sweet malts, a bit nutty and perhaps even some chocolate but nothing real intense. Mouthfeel is slightly thin for most porters, but it is not out of line. The flavor is good but it doesn't grab my attention. Roasted malts and that's about it. The finish is a bit weak which coincides with the mouthfeel.

At the very end the hops become dominating but before they develop into a bitterness they fade out leaving you with the urge to have another party on your palate. I simply couldn't stop sipping it.

The head is modest, tawny but not overly dark, with tons of lacing. This beer is modestly carbonated, medium bodied, and very smooth and creamy. This beer is exceptionally smooth and creamy, rather. The taste is a very well balanced blend of caramel malts, molasses hints, toasted grains, roasted coffee, and a citrusy tang in the hops. There isn't much bitterness to these hops and some of the tang dissipates nicely as the beer settles. This is too sweet to be a British Porter, but it is representative of the style and very worth seeking out. The mouthfeel is creamy and just right. There is no lasting bitterness yet there is a slight metallic hint in the aftertaste which I'm going to knock a half point off the drinkability factor.

The smell is a little lighter than a usual porter, not so heavy on the chocolate and coffee aromas, but pretty balanced between hops and the roasted odors. The taste is very balanced and enjoyable. Hints of chocolate and coffee without being too present, and not very heavy on hops and alcohol like a chocolate stout. Very balanced, not too much of anything, but a nice combination of its ingredients. Overall light and drinkable. I'd prefer this over a high-alcohol content chocolate stout.

Caramel and chocolate and lots of roastiness in the smell. There are some hops there, but they are low, low down. Floral hoppiness comes through in the taste, nicely, on the finish. They then roll out in the aftertaste. The rest of the taste is a thickening of the caramel/chocolate/roasted smell. Flavor of a deep (full city) roast of coffee without the acidity. Medium body with a low-medium apparent carbonation. An earlier reviewer suggested it was oily, but for me it comes off soft. Again, it's comparable to a full city roast coffee with bitterness o hops adding a nice balance. I actually prefer this to the most recent Am Porter I've reviewed.

Off white head lasted about 90 seconds until subsiding to a khaki coloured frost over the liquid's surface. Smell is unsweetened bakers chocolate and used coffee grounds. A bit earthy, as well. Bitter hops noticeable, but this is nearly all malt. Mostly dry throughout, this is full of dry, roasted cereal profiles. Mouthfeel is exactly where it needs to be for the style. A very drinkable porter. Nice.","SilentSabre","Jul 20, 2007"
4.2,8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Sierra Nevada Porter pours a deep, dark, virtually jet black color with a light tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Chocolate and coffe notes dominate the aroma.

First aroma to hit is a lime citrus sweetness and tang from the fresh domestic hops. Underlying cocoa, Dark chocolate and banana bread aromas along with a mellow roast coffee. Taste is the roast malt and cocoa flavors to start leading to a medium long finish highlighted by the lime accented hops. A very well balanced flavor profile. Easy to drink and not too heavy this dark delicious brew is actually quite refreshing. Would love to try it with BBQ.","mshallah","Jul 11, 2007"

Roasted malts again, with hints of chocolate and even lesser noticeable coffee. Also a little hop kick hidden in there. Mouthfeel is lighter than I'd prefer but still good.

The aromas are roasted grains that give it such a great smell as it seems to act as the backbone for the entire brew. Mixed in with that great smell seem to be an excellent accompanists of caramel, some coffee like aroma and a somewhat (but in no way over powering) pungent hop scent. The taste is as good as the scent; it seems to start on the sweet side with roasted and chocolate malts coming out quite quickly with some notes of coffee mixed in. The end seems to have a break in the type of bitterness, at first I think it was due to the roasted grains but the finish is more of a citric hop. The feel is very smooth and creamy. Over all this is simply an excellent rendition of a Porter. I am glad that we have this readily available as it seems that most breweries today seem to be going to an extreme even with this type of a brew, not to say that is a bad thing but a lot of times you just want a classic.","Stimack","Apr 21, 2007"

The aromas are roasty to start, blended with some chocolate, but there is some oxidation in the background that give it a sort of musty aroma. Its very light bodied which also translates to the flavor of the beer. What flavors there are, are coming through, but they seem a little lackluster for this beer.The roast, chocolate and slight alcohol come thorough, and leave your mouth with a semi roasted after taste. It starts wirth sharp carbonation, and stays sharp in the middle. It dries out in the end really well, and leaves that roasty taste very nicely on your palette. Overall, Its a nice session porter.

The head is slow to fall, but the lacing is sudsy and slick. The body is an extraordinarily deep garnet when backlit. The nose is dominated by roast, although it seems soft and caramelly. A little citrusy hop presence seems there also. The taste is actually fairly mild - just a bit of roastiness, balanced by some definite hoppy bitterness. Pretty spicy, but not much depth. The mouth is medium, and the beer manages to be very smooth. The spiciness really makes this beer difficult to drink.

Traditional porters should get most of thier bitterness from the hops and not the malts.

By all means this has all the ingredients to be too bitter, but it comes off as light and creamy with a good amount of warmth from the alcohol. Thankfully this does not push the sweet (Ballroom Blitz) envelope to counteract the hops/coffee.

It's a little more course going down, as opposed to silky, but that really brings out the flavor of the dark roasted malts. The hops are what really make this beer for me though.

The aroma is of chocolate, roasted malt, and more chocolate. The taste is a perfect balance between roasted malt and chocolate. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation.

3.88,-0.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours deep brown/black with red-ruby highlights. Tan head fills the glass with dense, soapy bubbles, then slowly pops down to create spotty lacing. Roasted barley, black patent and molasses nose, not particularly aromatic. Sweet roasted flavor, lots of blackstrap molasses, caramel and subtle coffee. Slightly drying aftertaste, mild american hops will create a suitable balance. Medium body and low carbonation- smooth and sweet overall. Sweetness carries into the finish, but not overly residual. Acceptable session porter.","PBRstreetgang","Feb 11, 2006"

4.08,4.9,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"The flavor was that of strong toasted malt, with some coffee hintsin the background.

Smells sweetly of chocolate, coffee with cream, heavy malt overtones, slight hop aroma present as well. Tastes fairly hoppy, exceptionally well balanced with a blend of dark roasted coffee, tingles on the tongue some. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, not unlike a stout although a lighter bodied brew. Very drinkable, well done, this is my first American Porter, and is fairly similar to a Baltic Porter, although much lighter and fizzier.","danielocean03","Jan 15, 2006"

Complex aromas of roasty malts, coffee, chocolate, vanilla (subtle), and spicy hops. Nice roasted coffee flavor, with chocolate and vanilla notes. Toasted grains and a hop bite at the finish. Medium-bodied, smooth mouthfeel, almost silky. Nostril-stinging hop burps. Great drinkability. Easily a session porter if there ever was one.","orfeu","Jan 14, 2006"

Taken to the nose , light scents of fruity hops and chocolate seem the most present. Taste begins with semisweet chocolate and turns to pleasant bitter hops , deep-roasted barley, and a trace of caramel flavor. Very nice. Medium carbonation in the mouth. The Goldings and Willamette hops , along with its 4 malts , make this a very tasty and drinkable porter. I will definatly be drinking more of these.","Byeast","Jan 08, 2006"

Once in the glass, however, the head was frothy tan and clung to the side of the glass like a true champ. This beer is very dark, light can't even be seen through the corners like you can even with a stout. The taste is very well rounded and there is no lingering of any one taste but a great balance of flavor throughout. This is the best balance of bitter and sweet that I think I have dranken to date. Have enjoyed many Sierra Nevada ales and stumbled across this porter. Hopefully the source will continue to stock, this is a new one on my list of favorites.","mooseisloose","Jan 07, 2006"
4.1,5.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"So I picked me up a sixer of this. Exactly what I needed. Dark, dark brown, thin but persistent head, tastes of caramel, cocoa, coffee gorunds, and anise, with a tingly but tame hop bitterness. Reminiscent of another stellar but overlooked porter from Anchor (thought this is not quite as roasty) Could drink the whole sixer in one sitting, I do believe. I gotta drink more beers like this, yo.","bultrey","Jan 03, 2006"
4.08,4.9,4,3.5,4,4,5,"Poured a very dark brown color (almost black) with a small head of tan colored foam that dissipated into small rings around the mug. It had a faint aroma of dark chocolate, roasted malt and at sometimes, just a hint of caramel. The smell was good, but I think it needed to be just a little bit stronger. The flavor was that of strong roasted malt, dark chocolate, and some coffee notes in the background. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with a strong roasted aftertaste. Very refreshing! Overall a cheap excellent porter that would make an excellent session Porter. This was my very first Sierra Nevada product and I'm going to make sure I try more of their beers in the future.

Smells like mild chocolate with some faint fruit flavors. Taste is somewhat smoky with a mild hop presence that compliments the roasted character. It stays rather sweet throughout, but does leave the palate with a light sour taste towards the end. For a somehwhat heavy porter, drinkability is top notch, I could drink these all night. I have had quite a few of the Sierra Nevada beers, and this one does not disapoint. It is simply a good beer to have around when theres a lack of selection at a packy near you.

The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, a squeak thinner than I had expected. Nice, smooth character. The drinkability is great, I could drink it all day and all night.

Pours a tan half-finger head over a dark liquid that is deep mohoganey held to the light and is almost crystal clear). Smells rich and chocolatey with some mild vienna malt character. Coffee roast is very faint and may simply be an effect created by the strong chocolate. Tastes sweet and chocolatey. Has a faint roughness on the tongue perhaps from the hops perhaps from roasted grains. Hop flavor can easily be tasted, but is well in balance with the sweet and chocolate. Medium thin mouthfeel with mild carbonation that fluffs nicely in the mouth. After the swallow, the flavors begin to subdue until chocolate re-emerges. Could use a twist of dark fruit near the end fill the gap between chocolate in the taste and chocolate in the aftertaste. Incredible lacing on the glass and the final gulp still has a thin layer of head. If I recall, this was just $5 per 6-pack...quite a deal for beer of such a high quality.","mentor","Feb 06, 2005"

I guess I was a little dissapointed in the taste, not that it tasted bad, I just didn't seem very interesting. A little smokey and well balanced, but I couldn't get excited about it.

Although this is a more malty beer than the widely available Pale Ale it is still very clear that you're drinking a Sierra just by the taste. I don't know they do it, but they definately have a signature taste. Nice malty body, and very well balanced with the citrusy hops. There's definately some flavor in there, chocolate, yeastiness, but this is a pretty mellow porter. None of that over powering "coffee" taste. Great smooth mouthfeel with a bitter kick to it.

There's a bitersweet aftertaste that lingers on after swallowing - the bitterness the last to leave your mouth. The mouthfeel is just right. Not too heavy, but definitely not light. The combination of flavor and body make me want to enjoy this beer in substantially sized sips.

The taste, in my opinion, is that of the quintessential porter. Very smooth and easy to drink, the malty taste slides over your tongue. Softly sweet with slight hints of chocolate in the background. The aftertaste has a coffee element to it, overridden by the soft malt. This beer is close to a perfect example of the style. That said, it is not very complex. A straight-up porter. I'd say the edge goes to Anchor's Porter, due to its complexity, but this is still a wonderful session porter to be drunk in the company of good friends.

The finish is clean and crisp and the smoothness invites another sip. This one is so full and satisfying I salivate heavily after each sip!? It's great - one of my standby favorites.","BrewMan82","Mar 27, 2004"

Taste also had the same coffe characteristics with mellow cocoa and roasted flavors, finishing with a very balanced, slight hop bitterness and a nutty aftertaste.

The hoppiness seems to be perfect too but i thought Sierra Nevada was notorious for super hoppy beers while this one was toned down. Nevertheless i detected a lot of noble hops with their mild floral flavors balancing the strong malt background.

4.13,6.2,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Dark brown, served with a moderate tan head that showed excellent retention. Fruity malt aroma with a decent dose of hops. Roasted notes in the taste are well balanced with some nice chocolate. Decent bitterness on the finish helps balance out the flavor profile and begs you to take another sip. There is a moderate level of sweetness that is revealed as you continue to drink this beer, but again it is all about balanced flavors. The mouthfeel is solid, as it caresses the tongue like fine silk. There is a nice roasted malt aftertatse theat lingers, but doesn't opress. A very dinkable and enjoyable beer from Sierra Nevada.","aaronh","Apr 06, 2003"

Roasted malt flavor dominates the front. The hop bitterness makes no secret of itself in the finish, which take some getting used to and leans toward the dry side. Depending on your preference for hops, I can see where this might be a porter that you would either like or dislike. Overall not bad.","Winter","Apr 06, 2003"

The aroma is of roasted malts and chocolate, with maybe a little bit of hops making its way in there. The taste is similiar to the aroma with roasted malt jumping out at the start. Unsweetened chocolate comes next, and what would a SN beer be without the hops. They are not real prevalent but don't go unnoticed either. Makes for a good balance. The mouthfeel is medium to full with a nice smooth finish. I could quaff many of these in one sitting. Another good solid brew from SN.","Bruiser81","Mar 10, 2003"

Aroma, though weak, has notes of light coffee, semisweet chocolate, vanilla, a fruity fermentation, mild hops and roasted grains. Mouthfeel is bright and spritzy, exploding upon the tongue (over-carbonated for a porter, IMO) with a light to medium body. Taste starts out with stale coffee, some crisp, fruity hops, toffee, a roasted middle redolent with roasted barley, and finishing in a thin, coffee/round hop bitterness with some distant huskiness and smoke. Forms a skin on the back of the tongue. Not a great porter, but a good porter in many aspects. Lacks complexity and character in my book...despite this, it's an easy beer to drink, though not one I would really feel the urge to drink much of.","Mitchster","Mar 01, 2003"

The smell is not very strong with coffee being the most noticeable aroma, backed by roasted malt and a hint of chocolate. In addition to the coffee, roasted malt, and chocolate, fruit sweetness is just barely detectable in the taste. A nice hop kick rounds things out well.

That is different, with the first taste on the tongue the hops come to the forefront of the flavor followed by a crashing mass of sweetness surrounded by the nice smooth almost burnt dark and choclate roasts entwined with a nice alcoholic finish to create quite the innovative porter.","WVbeergeek","Jan 17, 2003"
3.93,1,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"A hoppy, spritzy porter from a brewery that can do no wrong. (Fortunately, one of many.) Their stout is fantastic and this porter almost as good. Dark dark brown with huge fluffy head, grassy aroma with slight mustiness. Big coffee element, smaller chocolate flavor, roastiness and breadiness all pushed aside by very grassy hops that do not bitter the beer so much as give it a green juicy twang. A dry finish with slight reverberations of dark roasty malts. My tongue is deceived and can't grasp the full hoppiness, but the back of my throat definitely senses it. Not a ton of coffee, just grassy enough to make this a very green vegetable-like beer. Spritziness detracts slightly from the style but reminds you of SN's worthwhile bottle-conditioning strategy, and keeps this beer very much alive. I would rank this just under Anchor for West Coast porters (that I have been fortunate enough to try).","Thrasher","Jan 14, 2003"
3.45,-11.3,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"This beer poured a dark brown with a slight reddish tinge. It appeared to be not as thick as other porters, and tasting later on proved this to be true. A darker than average tan head grew and stayed for quite a while. Tasting proved the earlier assumption of a lager consistency and also was slightly on the bitter side. The smell was one of dark roasting with a hint of coffee lurking in the background. It was smooth in the mouth, went down easily tempting you to take the next drink. This is a beer I look forward to drinking again and would, and will, gladly serve to my family and friends.","Kunsan90","Jan 03, 2003"

4.46,14.7,4.5,3.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Looked forward to this after sampling their stout. And I wasn't disappointed. Very dark brown in color, with a finger-thick creamy, slightly dark tan head. Great lace -- when you're done drinking you can go back and measure the size of your sips from its spacing down the glass. Coffee-like aroma to which my nose became accustomed rather fast, making it hard to smell much at all 1/4 of the way down the glass. The flavor is terrific, and it's all about the bitter. Starts off with a nice hop flavor, which gives way to a deep malty body and a wonderful finish composed of the combination of bitterness from the hops and grains. Aftertaste is slightly burnt-tasting. Much like their stout in its flavor profile, with a creamy body that's a bit less heavy, and a taste which is slightly less grainy/barley like. Very nice winter beer.","mzwolinski","Nov 30, 2002"

Nice roasted grains, caramel, slightly hop floral nose, sweet and quite sniffable. Front is malt sweet, top is moderate in mouth feel, the finish is strikingly hopped, and slenderly acidic, pleasantly dry aftertaste.

The body is medium with a very fine and gentle carbonation that gives it an impressive smoothness in the mouth. The flavor starts lightly sharp with some roasted notes, followed by some bittersweet chocolate and grainy sweetness as it crosses the palate. It finishes with a lingering, acridic/burnt roasted note and some minimal earthy hop flavor that becomes somewhat astringent. Solidly bitter, but still well balanced.","NeroFiddled","Oct 13, 2002"

Aroma of roasted grain first, then malty sweetness and some hop aroma.  An odd balance of fruity hop and roasted grain on the palate.  Surprisingly, alcohol warms and is noticeable in the mouthfeel, even though this brew is only 5.6% ABV.  Smooth, dry, "roasted" finish.  I was surprised by the hop character in this one, just a bit more than I would expect from a porter.

The flavor has coffee and chocolate notes as well as the notorious cascade hops that Sierra Nevada uses...and I'm not sure it fits in with a porter's typical flavor.

Sharp, burnt toast black patent notes hit the nose at first, but as my senses adjust there is a pleasant, slightly earthy and floral Willamette hop nose accompanied by just a hint of caramel malt.  The borderline astringent sharp black patent bitterness is followed by an overly mellow and subdued chocolate malt flavor.  Hop bitterness is definitely above the norm for a porter, and the beer finishes with an equal mix of roasted grain and hop bitterness. This is certainly an interesting porter, but the roasted grain flavors and high hop rate aren't quite balanced by the relatively thin body and one dimensional maltiness. As a porter, it's a bit skewed in balance, but as a creation in itself it's quite drinkable.","marc77","Apr 01, 2002"
