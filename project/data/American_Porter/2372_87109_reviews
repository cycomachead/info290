"Dark and opaque with a fleeting cream colored head that yielded great lacing and just a little fizz about the top. Nose is immediately chocolate that fades into a more malty design. Taste is similar to the nose as it hits quick with chocolate but slowly fades to a more bitter offering that loses most of the sweetness but never really loses the chocolate. Like bitter dark chocolate. Not too much peanut butter, if any at all that I can detect. Finishes quite bitter but oddly, unlike the travels of the taste, it finishes with a cloying sweetness. Thin, slightly crisp.  Taste is not bad at all, but lacks a little depth in the body."

"Personally, I feel that Duclaw's Sweet Baby Jesus is so much better than this. Look- opaque, slight dark tan rim. Smell- somewhat weak, bitter chocolate. Taste- bitter dark chocolate, don't get a ton of peanut butter here. It all tastes a little fake. Very malt forward. Little to no sweetness. Feel- not as creamy as I would have liked. My advice, go with Sweet Baby Jesus for a superior chocolate peanut butter stout."

"the nose is dominated by peanut butter with a bit of roasted maltiness.  taste is much lighter on the peanut butter than the nose - a nice subtle blend. subtle notes of chocolate and roasted malt as well"

"Winter Haven Beer Crawl - Red Geranium"
""
""
"Pours out dark brown, almost black, with a thin frothed off-white head.  Smells of Reese's peanut butter cups, peanut butter M&Ms and Butterfinger.  Tastes more beer-like than the smell lead me to believe.  Nice lightly toasted and roasted malt base highlighted by big nuttiness and complimentary chocolate.  I get some tahini as well.  Medium body with subdued carbonation.  This is a perfect beer for someone who loves chocolate and peanut butter.  Delicious."
""
"Personally I think this is one of the best peanut butter beers on the market (although it actually uses a peanut extract). There's enough PB that you get it clearly in the nose, and clearly in the flavor, but then it becomes just another component (nutty) as the chocolatey malt steps forward. So perhaps it's too sweet for some, and I could agree with that if it was a standard porter, or maybe even just a ""chocolate porter", but as a ""chocolate peanut butter porter"" you kind of have to expect that it's a little sweet. And yet it's not quite a full-on dessert beer - you can drink one of these and not find it cloying. So I guess it's one of those beers that you either like or don't like because you can't really argue that it's not to style. If you found a defect, that would be one thing, but as it's currently designated, as long as it roughly fits into the ""porter"" guidelines... ""all's fair in love and war""."
"Really just smells like vomit, and has a bit of that flavor, too. I can't get into these PB beers, but this one takes the cake as just plain gross."
""
"Solid sweetness.  Had as a dessert beer.  12 oz bottle poured into a stemmed glass.  Enjoy by date of 4-22-15.  Chocolate-y with some peanut butter in the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Definitely one of the better chocolate/peanut butter porters/stouts that I have tried, I have had a couple of other beers similar in style but this is one of the more successful - a nice combination of flavors without a lot of associated sweetness. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this one."
""
"Is anybody else seeing loads of what appears to be peanut butter sediment floating in this? I may have to re-rate."
""
"I ordered this bottled last night and when I poured it there was zero head and the lacing was non-existent. Anyone else have this experience or can I blame the bar for poor storage?"
""
"Pitch black in glass with about a finger of rich tan head. Peanut butter dominates the nose with a hint of chocolate. A complex and balanced flavor profile with rich malt and chocolate notes. Peanut butter lingers in the background nicely. Medium bodied and not overly sweet. This beer exceeded my expectations and is an interesting twist on the porter style."
""
"Great tasting brew with a great smell!"
""
"The peanut butter comes through, big time"
""
"Terrapin Liquid Bliss ""Peanut Butter Porter"". Pours such a clear deep brown that it appears tar black, producing barely 2 fingers of light mocha, somewhat lasting, frothy head that leaves thin streaks & webs of lace. Nose is dark roasted malt, chocolate milk, peanut butter, caramel, vanilla, butter, heavily creamed coffee & a hint of smoke. Taste is dark, deeply roasted malts, peanut butter cookies dipped in dark chocolate, Nestle' Quik & heavily creamed coffee with butter in the finish. It has an overall flavor reminiscent of a bite of fudge ripple ice cream in a deeply bready cone. Aftertaste is burnt coffee & peanuts in a lightly bitter note & a hint of smoke. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied, low-moderate carbonation, slick, oily & a little chewy."
"how uncommon is this? a peanut butter porter! although i have seen many attempts, this might be the only one i would drink again, its delicious. man it must be hard to use that ingredient in a beer, not just because of its texture, but because of its fat content, not water soluble right? so how do you do it? its awesome. i also like that its subtle, i mean, this is a rich roasty porter before its a peanut butter beer, and i love that aspect. the peanut butter is almost faint in the nose, and a little more forward in the flavor, but still nowhere near over the top. it adds a fitting nuttiness that works with both the grains and the yeast, and there is a bitter roast to this that cuts any sweetness that might be present from the peanut butter. what i think i like the most, in addition to all the layers going on with the flavor, is the texture. its silky smooth, not greasy or oily or sticky or sweet or any of the feels i usually think about with peanut butter, so thats awesome, and i score it highly there not because i love the way it feels necessarily, its not that different from other good porters, but because it is none of those feels that would be out of place in a beer. fun fun beer, i could even have a few of them. so keen to try the banana edition."

"The porter aspect is missing like mouthfeel and maltiness that is common to many porters."
""

"Overall: It was a decent beer but I wouldn't call it liquid bliss. If you're really into peanut butter I think you'd enjoy this beer. It has a good peanut flavor. If you are a chocolate lover I think you would be disappointed. The porter (just the beer) is average at best."
""
""
""
"I really like this porter. I never thought that Chocholate and Peanut Butter would be good flavors for a porter but I am wrong. The only thing that I've had a issue is that when pouring it doesn't have much of a head on it.  A little bit more of a head could add to it. But overall its really good and I love it as a go to Winter beer."

"Awesome unexpected porter. Easily drinkable has everything you expect with notes of peanut butter in nose and taste. Subtle enough not to overpower and just enough hop bitterness to complement all that flavor."

"Flavor is initially decent, but gets real thin fast, watery and bitter."
""
"Totally yummy beer. Complex, delicious."
"Smell is excellent.  Unfortunately the taste and feel don't follow."
""
""
"Slightly sweet darker ale with a wine like texture and quickly disappearing head.  I appreciate a beer like this that doesn't over emphasize the flavors they're trying to get across on the label."
"While the beer's finish with its stout stature firmly intact, its obvious cocoa, coffee and cream ensures such. However, the medium-full beer keeps such velvety touch and that peanut secondary character to allow the finish of peanut butter cup lingering long after the bulk of taste closes."
"The smell is fabulous. Nicely peanut butter goodness.  I've had a few peanut butter stouts that didn't work for me at all.  This one more that works but is incredibly balanced and flavorful.  Nice chocolate, coffee, hop and peanut butter that is blended for a great mixture of flavor.  Not nearly as ashy as the Wake and Bake.  Sweet yet crisp finish.  Body is a little light and I almost wish this brew was bigger, thicker and sweeter, but for how it is currently made, I think its still outstanding as/is.  Enjoyed this one tremendously and highly recommend over many other more ""faddish"" titled peanut butter stouts out there (looking at you S.B.J)."
""
"I had really high hopes for this beer and maybe that is why I was disappointed. The peanut flavor was pretty overpowering at first and definitely took some palate calibration to get used to. It didn't finish very cleanly and had the peanut flavor lingering too long in my opinion. Still an all around good beer, so don't get me wrong. Just not my favorite, but something worth trying for yourself for sure."
""
""
"Overall:  This is a great porter!  It has great flavors of peanuts, chocolate and roasted malt, balanced beautifully with some slightly bitter notes of dark-chocolate, coffee and hops.  Recommended to fans of DuClaw Brewing Company’s Sweet Baby Jesus Chocolate Peanut Butter Porter, as it is just as good."
""

"Out of the bottle or On draft it doesn't matter, this beer is great not too heavy, not over the top in anyway its well balanced and Its even better used in a CAR BOMB!! despite the seemed ""Lower Rating"" for how great this beer is."

"Smooth, but needs more flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, mouth feel was too thin, did not detect hardly any peanuts in the taste or smell.  Would be nice to see a double version of this to boost up the body and try and impart more peanut flavor."
"Watery body with very little chocolate or peanut butter flavor to speak of."
""
"Poured a dark brown, near black; seemed cloudy. Two finger head that subsided somewhat quickly. Tasted of toasted grain and roasted peanut shells, nose was distinct peanut butter and some bittersweet chocolate and cold coffee. Pretty good beer, but I feel I wouldn't session this porter at all. Wouldn't most porters, but this is a pretty unique experience meant to be had once in a while. Woul recommend!"
""
"OVERALL:  Very tasty peanut butter ale.  A niche beer, and definitely not for everyone, but certainly good for what it is."
""
""
"Gimmicky, sure—but quite successfully so.  Soft, airy mouthfeel, good dark-burn bitter porter notes, mild sweetness, and a potent Reese's aroma that luckily gives way to a more moderated, much cleaner peanut-butter-cup quality at the beer's heart.  All of that is washed away nicely by mellow hop bittering and dry malt tones.  If you're going gimmick, points are deserved for executing it with reasonable aplomb—and I'd say Liquid Bliss is deserving of such points, even if candied-up dark beers aren't in my personal wheelhouse."

"Enjoyed this at Cafe Craft in North Charleston, SC. Split the last remaining bottle in the joint with a friend. Poured in to a pint glass with a near black appearance and a thin coating of tan foam. Visible bursts of carbonation in the glass, like a cola. Obvious aroma of earthy whole peanuts, dirty shell and all. A little milk chocolate in the nose creates a nutty buddy appeal. Ok, now for the first sip... Roasted peanuts in the front with a tangy bitterness in the back. Mildly sweet chocolate undercurrent pulls it together. The aftertaste is like a freshly chewed mouthful of dry roasted peanuts with a lingering bitter dark chocolate wafer. The mouthfeel is a little thin, partially masked by aggressive carbonation. Overall, Terrapin has succeeded in creating a remarkable likeness to Little Debbie Nutty Bars. Perhaps not as sweet, but in the context of a beer it's tremendous. This one is lacking the silky, creamy texture or richness of my favorite porters but for what it is, it's great nonetheless. Hopefully they reign in the carbonation a little and add some depth to the body. If so, this could become a favorite of mine. That said, I'm a sucker for chocolate and peanut butter. Thank you to my own nutty buddy that let me split his beer."
"Great taste. I could tate a chocolate peanut butter flavor instantly. Nice colors and smell. Draft style. Law old live to try from bottle."
"Peanut butter not very present. Chocolate tastes artificial for sure"
""
"Love at first taste. Puts ""Sweet Baby Jesus"" into second place by a long way!"
"The cover on my bottle is a little different  but it seems like I agree with majority..pretty good"
""
""
"smell the peanut and the chocolate.  light caramel taste, peanut in the middle and cocoa nib aftertaste. overall a solid porter that is very light on the caramel, peanut, and chocolate."
""
"Overall not a bad porter, but it lacks the richness of flavor exhibited by the top-shelf American porters. Perhaps the peanut butter tends to dominate the flavor a bit and would best be restricted to imperial examples which have an abundance of malt to compensate for it. This was my first peanut butter beer and I can definitely see the promise."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle.  Dark chocolate brown with a full finger of tan head.  Lingers nicely.   Little lacing. Smells of chocolate, coffee with just a hint of peanut butter.  Light not heavy in the mouth.  Low abv. Tastes of coffee and chocolate with a hint of peanut butter.  Very subtle and understated.  Roasted malts.  Finished light and clean. Pleasantly surprised.  Very drinkable."

"BBD 3/11/15.  Pours almost black with a normal head, below normal lacing and retention.  Very nice nose of peanuts and chocolate, much like a Reeses Cup.  Light medium body (barely) with a somewhat smooth texture.   Above normal carbonation with effervescence from the middle on.  The flavor profile is a let down from the nose. It begins with a stale peanut flavor that fades into a light bitterness.  As the bitterness fades in the middle, a light dark chocolate bitterness comes forth.  The finish is a lingering slightly sweet flavor of roast and stale peanuts."
""
"pours a dark opaque brownish black with a tan head.  Smells of roasty malts, chocolate, and slight peanut butter.  Taste was roasty and toasty malts, chocolate powder, and no peanut butter to be found.  I found this very disappointing.  Feel was medium to heavy.  Overall I found myself wanting more peanut butter while drinking, and there was none to be found."

" The taste is pretty accurate to the description of a chocolate peanut butter combo with toasted grain and peanut flavor and slight hint of herbal hops in the background with mildly creamy taste of yeast and nutty flavor continuing with subtle cocoa into the dry finish with mild alcohol in the taste. The flavor has a decent overall effect but nothing astounding taste-wise a pretty decent and drinkable porter with peanut butter cup flavor and it is not rich or sweet basically a quality dark ale."
""
""
"A nice and medium porter, has a faint chocolate and peanut butter taste. It's good, but perhaps the taste is a bit faint and 'small' for me. Although, it is very pleasant to drink. Defiantly worth a grab... However, I wouldn't likely go too far out of my way to find it~"
"My first shot at this, as I've wanted to taste it.  On the nose sweet chocolate, toffee and peanuts.  Malt balance and chocolate flavors stick out the most, very subtle hop in the back and more peanut/peanut butter in the nose than in the flavor.  Overall, very tasty.  I don't think I could drink 6 in a row, but a good dessert beer for sure.  Well done"

"On the whole not too bad but this is not one I would seek out again"
""
""
"Pours a typical black porter color with teeny head. Head disappears quickly, I mean disappears too! Nose is of definite chocolate, dark fruit and hint of peanuts. Tastes like carbonated nutella, or releases beer. Incredible"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty standard porter, the peanut butter is very noticeable in the nose and somewhat in the taste. I'd drink this again, but it didn't blow me away."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Looks ordinary; dark brown in color with a foamy cream colored head. Aroma was nice. I actually get some of the peanut butter aromas. There is also some slight chocolate. Flavor profile lacked what punch the aroma provided. Mildly reminiscent of the flavors on the label, but all in all, lackluster and poor. Chalky and thin on the body. Not the best beer from Terrapin. In fact, I opened a Founders Breakfast Stout and mixed about half of it with the remaining Terrapin beer to make it enjoyable."

"Light black to dark brown in color with a murky complexion that does not let light through.  A fingernail of khaki colored head rests on top.  Brussels lacing.  The aroma is as advertised on the bottle with the peanut butter dominating and the chocolate more of a background note.  The taste is a mélange of chocolate, dark malt and peanut butter.  There's a bitterness that lingers in the fade to even out the sweetness.  The mouth is thick and creamy."

"The beer pours a fairly bubbly head that is a creamy dark tan color that is a bit black like chocolate milk. The beer itself is a very dark brown with a pretty slick surface. The smell is a mixture of peanut butter and dark chocolate that is very pleasing to the nose. The sweet dark chocolate is dominated by the peanut butter but it is still pretty good. The taste, however, is a little bit disappointing. The taste is only a mere shadow of the smell. The peanut butter is much weaker and barely there while the dark chocolate does not seem to exist. Rather, the taste has a somewhat unpleasant taste that resembles watered down peanut butter. The mouthfeel is a bit watery and not very pleasant and barely any carbonation. Overall, this Terrapin is like every other Terrapin I've had; the beer has a promising smell but disappoints in the tastes and mouthfeel."
""
""
""
"Overall, a really awesome beer!  I really like this one but I must admit, I am a sucker for chocolate and peanut butter so when I seen this, I was excited to give it a try.  This one has become my new favorite desert beer and I can see myself enjoying this pretty often."
"Ok porter, though the peanut butter/chocolate flavoring has an artificial, chemical taste to it."
""
"Pours dark brown, almost black with nice caramel head and moderate carbonation. Nice peanut butter aroma with a nice roastiness as well.  Taste is a real nice mix of cocoa and peanut butter with a nice balance of sweet and bitter flavors which helps balance.  Not as thin as many choc pb porters which is something I enjoyed about this one.  I still find myself wanting more peanut butter flavor from it, but overall it's pretty solid and worthy of a pickup."
"Overall:  A very pleasant surprise.  Pretty much picked this up because it was fresh and felt like giving something different a try.  I had my doubts about the peanut butter-ness of it, but it was creatively done and the chocolate was well done, too.  Don't imagine I'd pick up a sixer of it, but I can definitely seeing buying a single or two again."

"Roasted and chocolate malts dominate the aroma, with hints of coffee and a peanut butter finish. Toasted malt is evident throughout. Flavor is more chocolatey upfront, with a touch of toasted malt hitting mid palate, and light roast bitterness carrying into the finish, where peanut butter closes out the experience. I'm a sucker for dessert beers, and this is a nice representation without being sweet. There's even a saline flavor that lingers. If this had a touch of sweetness... There's also an acrid and metallic flavor that emerges."
"Overall:  again, an interesting beer, and certainly drinkable in its way.  But this particular nutty combination is not for me."

"A great flavored Porter. Color os extremely dark and head is nice and foamy off-white. Aroma is of malt and a cocoa-coffee blend. Taste is amazing with hints of toasted chocolate, penut butter, sweet malt, etc. The balance is great, as is the carbonation. The peanut butter flavor is just enough to add to the flavor without overpowering. Awesome !!"
""
""
"The peanut butter smell is quite pronounced, and it's not a particularly good quality peanut butter smell. The taste is a bit more subtle, and the chocolate adds balance. I may need to try another to adequately judge, but I'm a bit disappointed. Overall, not an undrinkable porter by any stretch...but I'll probably give a couple away to friends."

"O: not a bad take on a porter, the chocolate peanut butter twist is pleasant and not overstated"
""

""
""
"Pours from the bottle with a near black color that glows with a chestnut brown halo around the edges, but there is only a minimal head formed. The aroma is like an Easter basket, with recognizable notes of chocolate and peanuts that are gimmicky but enjoyable. The chocolate and peanut butter come through clearly in the flavor as well, but not in an artificial way. Rather, the nutty, sweet, and cocoa characteristics are similar to those found in other porters, but they are just amplified in this beer. The mouthfeel is thankfully lighter than expected, as this would have been hard to take down if it was thick and syrupy. Overall, I don't know that I could drink much of this, but the novelty of it is fun."

"Not too overly impressed, even though this brew came highly advised. If you are not a fan of hazelnut... I advise you to make another choice because all I can taste is hazelnut. The only redeeming quality is that there is no lingering taste of any kind. I hate hazelnut... so for me, this was a waste, and at that... a six-pack waste. I will say though, it's not bad enough where I cannot drink the rest."

"Well this is confusing new to this weird rating system. Guess reviewing days are over :( Looks like a porter. Smells like it should I would say stale peanut butter cups with a dash of earthy hops. Taste is the same, porter like with added resse's cups. Brew is pretty much like it says it is, just a little too weird for me to want to have again."

"I have said it before, but one of the things that I really dig about these dark-colored beers is the way that the pseudo-cascade is truly obvious when I employ a heavy-handed pour. Once it settled, it produced two-plus fingers of dense, deep-tan/light-brown head with excellent retention. I am going to call the color an Opaque Black (SRM = 44) because with settling, I am unable to get any light penetration. Nose smelled like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup in my glass! It reminds me of my late Pops, who loved them and Tastykake Peanut Butter TandyTakes, white cakes with a top layer of peanut butter and fully enrobed in chocolate. Mouthfeel was medium, but I felt as though it should be fuller. Taste was spot-on chocolate and peanut butter. Wow! It was a bit sweet for my hophead palate, which is why I do not make it a regular thing at the Spring House Taproom, but it was truth in advertising. Finish was sweet, but not cloying, which would be a definite possibility with this admixture. I can take one at a time, but I am going back to something else after this."
"Pitch black nice mocha tan head, forms evenly across the sides of my chalice, Big peanut butter nose, dark roasted malt provides chocolate, this is good stuff...dessert in a beer.  Flavor brings more peanut butter notes with dark chocolate better than Sweet Baby Jesus, roasted malt and the peanut butter flavor mesh so well this is a treat.  Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied not something I could drink in number but it's oh so tasty on the palate.  Overall the type of dark beer I wanna get to know again and again, great stuff from Athens, GA!!!"
"O - a good beer, but it seems to fall a little short of what might have been intended."
"O: A pretty solid porter that I would buy and drink again.  I really do like the Terrapin beers, especially the Moo Hoo and Wake “N” Bake. They are by far my two favorites from this brewery.  With that said, I would have enjoyed this more with an additional peanut butter flavor. The chocolate was dominant and the peanut butter really just took a back seat."

"Pour is dark brown, almost black, with a tight tan head. Nose is heavy peanut butter with a touch of roast and a hint of milk chocolate. Not much malt presence but really a strong peanut butter flavor. Taste is heavy peanut butter like the nose but a stronger roast, a bit acidic and acrid, messier malt and a faint chocolate. Thick up front, body thins out in back, prickly and messier carbonation."
"Best by December 6, 2014."

"O: Definitely one of the better chocolate/peanut butter porters/stouts that I have tried, I have had a couple of other beers similar in style but this is one of the more successful - a nice combination of flavors without a lot of associated sweetness. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this one."

"The peanut butter aroma is overwhelming, making this otherwise mediocre porter barely drinkable. Way below Terrapin’s standards."

"Overall, not a fan. I'm not sure what segment of beer drinkers this is geared toward (I'm guessing those who do not actualy like beer). Still, I get curious, but this one will be the last one. Tick."
"T: Not as blissful as I would have expected but enjoyable. Bittersweet chocolate, roast character from peanuts. Cola like mid. Peanut butter resides on palate. Tastes as what you would expect. I wonder what artificial flavorings they used. Would be nice with some Asian cuisine I think."

"The taste is also like a malty Reese's Cup with a mildly bitter finish. Oh well, 1800+ BA reviews. I can't like them all."

"While not terribly strong, there was more than enough booze here which I felt once I polished this off. This wasn't bad but wasn't even closer to being Terrapin's best offering in their current lineup. This felt too artificial and like the Horny Goat, was only worth a go once. It would be wiser to get a Porter that was more filling and roast some s'mores while enjoying it. This will suffice alright for the warmer months but would not be my first choice if I had the heat on right now."

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark brown-to-black coloring with a thin, sparse, light tan head. Steady flow of carbonation throughout the body, too. Aromas of fresh baked chocolate brownies, peanut bitter rich and sweet, roasted notes, and a subtle sugary highlight. Flavors are subtle roasted chocolate, bittersweet, with a peanut butter backbone that is richly sweet. Nice balance, with a hint of roasted coffee. Mid-bodied, slightly dry, and smooth in mouth. The aftertaste is a solid blend of chocolate and peanut butter, again both sweet and slightly dry. The finish is smooth, dry, and with a solid linger. Decent brew for the flavor profile, and fits the style well."
"3.76/5.00"
""
""
"O-the peanut butter was light and the roasted taste was heavy, and it had some interesting smell and flavor"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smell is just like opening a jar of peanut butter. Pours a dark brown with very little head that is tan in color. Taste starts off with a very strong flavor of dark chocolate and only hints of peanut butter on the finish. However, as the beer warms, the peanut butter taste truly begins to shine. I recommend drinking this beer only slightly cooler than room temperature."

"Overall: Better than anticipated! Admittedly, while I don't have any particular beef with p-butter, I've never really reveled in it. As a kid, I ducked PBJ sandwiches and would readily trade away Reese's Peanut Butter Cups come Halloween."
""
""
""

"O-Damn tasty. The peanut butter taste is authentic and is complemented well by the chocolate and roasted flavors. Well balanced. Probably my second favorite Terrapin brew behind WnB."
""
""
""
"O - It's okay but experimental, would need to be in the right mood"
""
""
""
"The smell is very nice - notes of peanut and chocolate. Which actually matches the taste too. The peanut flavor is very light and the beer isn't overly sweet. It's nice, nutty and chocolatey."
""
""
""

"Overall interesting to try, nice peanut butter flavors, but just way too thin and watery, and choc even tastes watered down, and it has that molasses sugar mess flavor which also adds a bit of meh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Like others stated I wish the peanut butter would have been a bit stronger in this but it is present giving you some peanut oil sweetness that adds some complexity to the base porter. A very well done experimental beer."

"O: glad to have tried this brew out as it sounded very intriguing. but Terrapin missed the mark on this side project."
"A big want of mine ever since I heard about it, Liquid Bliss delivers exactly what I want it to. I wish the peanut flavors were a bit more pronounced but this beer is well balanced overall and the aroma and body carry the flavors over beautifully. Definitely worth trying."

"Thanks to Illudium for the beer!"

"O – Good not great brew. I would have personally like to have had a bit stronger peanut butter flavor. I got much more of a chocolate taste out of this. This was a easy drinker and I did enjoy it."
""
"D: I was skeptical, but Terrapin pulled this brew off surprisingly well. The peanut butter character was obvious enough without over doing it, and it was well integrated with the chocolate and other flavors. The body was good, but could have been a bit bigger. The finish was smooth, so it was easy to drink. Fun beer."

"O: Interesting beer. Nothing I'd pick up all the time, but glad to have tried it once. I think the flavors profile desired might have been better expressed as a stout."
""

""
"Let those bottles sit a minute before opening"
"Overall: Well executed. Definitely recommended."
"O- not a bad beer, but I've had better chocolate peanut butter beers lately. This falls short."
""
"O- Expectations were a bit high for this one and, while they weren't fully met, it's still a good beer. Would probably buy again if it came out in a six-pack format."
""
""
""
""
""
"A: two finger tan head on a deep dark brown body with fairly thick lacing. Roasted malt, both roasted peanuts and peanut butter which is actually better represented in the aroma than I would expect. Roasted malt and toffee base with what I think is just the right amount of peanut butter flavor which I imagine required quite a large amount to be this prevalent. Fairly thick body and moderate carbonation. Much better than I was expecting. Nice degree of sweetness. Still a fairly simple brew."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall this was a very unique beer. Wish the flavours melded together more. I actually wish it was a bit sweeter too on the taste based off of how that nose was. That said, this 22oz bottle was a chore to get through. Fun beer."
""
"O: I just expected more. Maybe my expectations were high as I really was hoping for a liquified Reese cup and I got a cheap, sugar free peanut butter cup that was dropped in dirt and cooked with the reject peanuts of the batch. I'm aging my 2nd bottle to see what happens."
""
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Light beige head, moderate retention, soapy, sticky lacing. Aroma includes roasted malt, coffee, peanut butter (yes, I smelled it), chocolate and slight milk dud. Taste includes chocolate, sweet chocolate malt, again slight peanut butter and maybe a hint of vanilla. Very, very delicious and highly drinkable and pretty much exactly as advertised on the flavors. Spectacular."
""
""
"This was an intriguing beer. It was nutty and had sweet fruitiness to it, but it was still had the typical porter qualities. It was a bit unique with the addition of peanut butter. I applaud them for trying something different. It's worth a try, but I won't be seeking this out again."
"this is a solid beer from terrapin, and i believe not only my first peanut butter experience with beer, but my favorite experience with terrapin. most the qualities are above average, but the flavor did it for me."
""
"Not bad, really light, I wouldn't mind a little more body and viscosity. Pretty good throughout, i really enjoyed the peanut taste, didn't expect too either."
""
"Average mouthfeel. Still worth a try, but I won't be buying more."
""
""
"Not quite as sweet as I expected. This is definitely a dark chocolate beer. Nice roast level but the peanut butter is too mild. The favors don't pop and there's no real peanut butter in the smell. I would have liked more intensity in flavor and a thicker mouthfeel. I'd pass in the future."
"O – This is a good beer and could be a homerun if the flavors all came together. I don’t know why my tongue and palate seem to be playing tricks on me, but I can’t seem to get all the flavors to come together in a single sip. Nevertheless, this is a very tasty beer. I think Terrapin made the right decision in making this a porter. If it was an imperial stout, I’m afraid that the peanut butter taste may have been drowned out even more than it is already. I’d maybe like to see how this would do with a bigger base beer, but I’m happy with how it is now, too."
""
"A terrific nitecap or dessert beer. Seek it out."
""
""
"Almost black pour with no head retention and little lacing. Great smell to start - chocolate comes through and a little of the maltiness. Taste is more chocolate, but somewhat subdued by the peanuts. They didn't really make it salty, but definitely balanced the sweetness and chocolate flavor. A very interesting beer and one that I would try again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Simple and thin porter but it does exactly what it says it's going to do. Pretty much pure chocolate and peanut butter with good balance between the flavors. Thin but creamy mouthfeel, wouldn't have minded a bit thicker but it turned out well. Not much in the way of actual porter characteristics but given what they were going for, I call this one a success. Would love to try an imperial version of this with a thicker mouthfeel and stronger aroma/flavors."
""
"Overall: I'm a big fan of chocolate porters/stouts and when I saw this I just had to try. I really hoped that this brew would be as good as the idea sounds, but was disappointed in the final result. I would not buy again unless the watered down mouth feel was fixed and the recipe was changed so that the peanut butter taste actually tasted like peanut butter."
""
""
"O: im enjoying this one more than I expected to. I would probably get this again, though it might be a bit. I got it for the novelty and Terrapin did a great job with what they were trying to do with that."
"Other: Peanut Butter, Boiled GA Peanuts, Olive & Sinclair Cocoa Nibs"

"O- I love peanut butter, so I was a fan of this beer. However, I would have liked to see an even more peanut forward profile in this one. Nonetheless. This makes a great dessert beer and one that peanut butter lovers will enjoy."
""
"Terrapin Liquid Bliss pours solid black, with just over a finger of dark khaki colored foam topping the beer. Head retention is alright, and lacing is minimal. The nose is nice, with dark chocolate and fresh roasted peanuts mingling and being buttressed by a bit of roasty grain. I just wish the aromatics were a bit more potent. The flavor profile leads off with a bit of roastiness, which quickly fades into an impressively authentic peanut flavor. A brief splash of dark chocolate provides the finish. The balance is just a little bit off though, as the peanuts don't leave much room for anything else. The carbonation, while serviceable, isn't great. The body could stand to be a little more full, and the carbonation's got a bit too much kick for my taste. It's my impression that peanut/peanut butter beers aren't the easiest to brew, but Terrapin had done an admirable job with Liquid Bliss."
"On tap at Sticks and Stones in Greensboro.Poured into a standard pint glass nearly pitch black with a minimal head.Aromas of roasted nuts and chocolate,to me almost like nutella with the chocolate and roasted nuts.Starts out semi sweet with chocolate standing out over top of molasses,the roasty nuttiness is a nice finish to the sweetness.Iam not normally really into these kinds of beers but I gotta say this wasn't to bad."
"O: I was actually disappointed here. It really wasn't anything special for me and certainly doesn't stand up to some of the other beers of similar style with similar ingredients."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Liquid Bliss pours a brown color with a small head. The aroma is good, there's a strong chocolate aroma over roastiness and a hint of nuts. As the beer warms, the nuts become much more apparent. The taste is very nice once you let it warm. The whole peanut and chocolate thing really comes through about an hour after taking it out from the fridge. Any sooner, and the flavors don't quite meld together. After a solid warming period, the peanut and chocolate flavors really work. The aftertaste is a bit muted though, a nice finish would have really made this beer, and it's just a little lacking. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and decently carbonated, and the drinkablity is great. Overall, this is a good experiment that just misses greatness. Still worth trying out though."

"amazing nose, thin, spritzy mouthfeel"
""
"A decent beer, but it doesn't deliver as advertised."
""

""

"Purchased from local Butcher shop and poured into Great Lakes pint glass. Not too big of a head, dissipates to leave a small amount of lacing. Nice aroma with hints of roasted peanut and malt. As has been mentioned, the flavors are quite subtle, but I like that. If any one flavor was overpowering, everyone would complain about that instead. Overall a very delicious porter with nice attributes that I would go back to again if it wasn't so limited. Glad I got to try it."
"O: A pretty underwhelming attempt at putting nutty and chocolate into a beer. While I am glad they didn't go overboard and try to supplement with artificial flavoring, Liquid Bliss is very low on flavor intensity and flavor overall. Sorry Terrapin -- this one is not a good SIde Project."
"overall: Gotta ratchet up the score on this fine experiment. This works and works well."
""
"Overall, disappointing. I wanted something a bit richer. When I think of ""liquid bliss"" and peanut butter and chocolate...i think decadent. They tried to be too subtle with this."
""
"The body sits a dark brown, near black with a tan head that falls quickly. No lacing left behind whatsoever. I let this warm up to room temp to try and get the peanut butter to pop. A thick layer of dark chocolate with some lactic sweetness. Peanut butter is extremely muted. On the palate, layers of dark chocolate and lactic sweetness roll over the tongue. Peanut butter comes through a little bit, but is still faint. I get more of a salty peanut shell flavor than true peanut butter. Smooth, creamy feel, medium body. Low carbonation. Good feel overall. A bit of lingering bittersweet chocolate. This is a nice porter, but doesn't hit on the advertised flavors in the way I was hoping."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So my verdict is that it's pretty good for a porter...but I'm disappointed that I don't taste what should make this beer so unique."
"O: a good beer overall. Simplistic, but it is like drinking a Reese's cup. It would be nice if it had a creamier body and the chocolate/peanut butter were a bit more present in the flavor."
"The mouthfeel is thin for the style and just a little creamy. Carbonation is average. Overall, I thought it was a pretty solid beer. It came together much better then I anticipated. I thought the chocolate and peanut butter were well balanced and very flavorful. Very nice beer overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: When Terrapin is on, they're really on (Anniversary Shmaltz brown ale collaboration), but when they're off, you might as well hang it up. Sigh..."
""
""
"Dark brown-black pour with a small mocha head that receded to a ringlet; minimal lacing. I wasn't aware that this was a peanut butter beer, but one sniff, and it was pretty obvious; otherwise, chocolate malts, and not much else. Dark malts in the taste, pretty sweet and not a lot of roastiness, toasted grains, again, the peanut butter comes through, not so much that it's right in your face. Body was just barely on the fuller side of medium, with a slightly chewy texture, lower carbonation. Quite good overall."
"Wow. It's not quite everything I'd hoped for but I really like how much authentic peanut flavor this has. I think Spike is on the right track with this unique offering and I hope that he continues to explore the use of peanuts in his dark beers."
"O: This is a good beer that could be great. They should have used the WnB base for this beer and amped up the peanut butter a bit. Either way, it's a good beer. And a peanut butter beer with no infection!"
""
"O - I'm pretty disappointed in this beer. I'm a huge Terrapin fan and this is the first time I haven't loved a new release. I don't see this run being brought back. If you're a big Terrapin fan or porter lover try it's a decent pick up."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty black in color with some caramel highlights and a moderate, creamy tan head. Definitely some peanuts in the aroma along with cocoa, dark fruity esters, and a hint of coffee beans. More of the peanut butter thing going on in the flavor...creamy, smooth, chocolaty sweetness, hardly any roast, more dark fruit. Smooth medium body. I eat quite a lot of peanut butter and while it doesn't hit the spot as well as I'd hoped, this is still pretty satisfying. I wish the chocolate malt dominated a little more though..."
"O: This is a fun beer experience. Peanuts + beer? Yes. I'd like to see more brewers take a stab at this combination."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I like this beer quite a bit, even though I'm not big on gimmicks. This is a well made beer, with a little gimmick on top."
"O - A tasty porter, with certainly a different experiment than anything I have ever tried. Its good, but not was not knocked out of the park. But I love the continued experiments in the side project series. Until the next one..."
""
"O: This a beer that is better in concept than it is in execution. It has some good elements, but simply isn't quite there. Drinkable, but only just so."
"Pours dark cola-brown with lighter brown edges and a mocha head that settles to a thin ring and patchy haze. Definitely getting some peanut butter, chocolate, and cookies. Reminds me of a Girl Scout Tagalong cookie. Taste is pretty close, authentic peanut butter flavors, chocolate, dark malt, vanilla, and sugar cookie. Really nice concoction. Mouthfeel is smooth, with a medium body and good carbonation. Really neat beer, one of the better Terrapin offering of late(and easily the most memorable)."
""
"O: Unlike others, I didn't have particularly high expectations for this one, as Ive never really been blown away but a standard (non-Baltic/low ABV) porter. So that being said, I was quite satisfied with is. My main complaint is it just needs to be bigger, from top to bottom. Stronger flavors and aromas, and a thicker body and this one could be special . The potential is there, and they did a good job bringing out the peanut characters, it overall just a little weak for my liking. But then again I am a whore for big beers. That being said, I really did enjoy it."
"Very impressed with the combination and balance of flavors. I would think that it would be difficult to find the right combination to blend all of these strong flavors together, but they pulled it off."
"- Overall: Great idea, poor execution"
""
""
"Pretty good stuff and quite unique. Had real high hopes for this one and it mostly lives up. Not quite as big or bold in the chocolate and peanut butter flavors as I would have liked and more body would help too. Still, they pretty much got what they were aiming for as the peanut butter and chocolate are the predominant flavors here."
"Nothing special. As far as porters go, it's a fairly decent one -- maybe even good. But this wasn't supposed to be yet another garden-variety porter -- it was supposed to be a wonderful medley of peanut butter and chocolate. The label promised me so! But Liquid Bliss fails to deliver. If you want a porter, fine, go ahead I guess. But at $7.99 for 22 oz, there are many better options out there."
""
"Mouthfeel: Light, moderate carbonation, pretty drinkable."
""
"I really wanted this to be an awesome beer. There is a picture of giant peanuts floating down a chocolate river on the label, after all. I was hoping for something bold and distinct, but this beer just comes off as a mediocre, but drinkable, porter."
"O-great beer. very creative"
