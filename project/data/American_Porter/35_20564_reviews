"Nice beer that has some shelf life. I'm sure the fruity notes are due to age."

"O: A decent porter but the herbal, almost metallic flavors up front are hard for me to get past; but I really like everything else about this beer--but like I said, something doesn't quite mesh on the flavors and though it's not bad, it's a bit difficult to get past"

"Very little change in appearance- retention is a touch worse than the fresh batch. Aroma is similar, although most of the subtleties are gone, and a mild sourness has set in to the roasted malt character. Flavors are wet toasted bread malts and a pinch of candied sugar with a mild oxidation on the finish. Mouthfeel qualities are the same, albeit a slightly dryer finish."

"I'm so impressed with this year's Holiday Porter. It really is a great tasting porter. The subtle taste and smell of a coffee and chocolate blend with a smooth feel gives this brew an all-around, great experience. I will get this again next Christmas."

"Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours a very dark brown, appearing black in the glass. Fine two finger light brown head with good retention and lacing. Light aroma of toasted malt, chocolate and unidentifiable spicing. Flavor follows with lightly toasted malt, light chocolate and coffee. Finish is slightly dry with residual malt and a hint of hops and chocolate. Light to medium bodied. A pleasant, but subdued American porter. Not sure what the holiday connection is, but certainly would be as drinkable then as any other time. No stand out features, but like most Sam Adams, well made, looks good and nice to drink."

"Aromas of dark malts which are very chocolate-like. The taste is rich roasted malt with a slight end note of spicy slightly peppery hops. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth with a bit of a carbonation bite in the finish. Overall this beer has a clean malt bill with nice rich chocolately malt flavor without being bitter which is often a problem with porters. Well done, tasty brew with high drinkability and good flavor."
"Overall: Not really a fan of Porters, I did not really care for this one. Just personal taste."
""
""
"This smells like chocolate and hops. That's about it. It has a very clean aroma and flavour. Maybe I've just been spoiled on very yeasty beers, but it seems very clean and thin to me. Not necessarily in a bad way. It's nice to have porters like that every now and then. Cocoa nibs are what hits first in flavour and it's what hits last too. There's some nice, simple balancing hops too. But there's really not a lot going on outside of the chocolate. It looks surprisingly awesome despite how thin the mouthfeel is for a stout. It's almost Guiness-thin. But that makes it refreshing, like a black lager. The feeling it leaves in your mouth is very sticky, though, and strongly of cocoa. This is basically ,an average, run-of-the-mill thinish stout with a very chocolatey edge. So, if that's what you're going for, this delivers."

"D: A decent, but not great porter. Good sessionability."

"Overall - a great porter and great offering from Sam Adams."
"Malty, coffee, roasted caramel ...thats right, just like it sounds super mega deliscious!"
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a black color porter with a nice off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of light dry chocolate notes with medium roasted malt notes. Taste is a mix of roasted malt with dry bitter notes and some light black chocolate notes with some subtle floral notes form the Golding hops. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Not the most complex porter put there but well brewed and easily drinkable."

"Samuel Adams Holiday Porter is a fairly typical example of the style. While enjoyable, I probably would not seek it out."
"Drinkability: I like it. It is not heavy but does provide a lot of nice flavor."

"O - Pretty decent porter, but not what I remember from the first time I tried it a couple years ago. The alcohol-y taste is a bit too pronounced."
""
"From a bottle into a tulip glass, accidentally aged a year in my dad's fridge, I can't say I have much to compare it to because I'm relatively new to beer, especially porters. Very tasty beer. Not a lot of head. Really pretty held up to the light: black with dark, translucent red coming through. The nose didn't jump out at me but there was definitely a little caramel as indicated on the bottle. The taste was very chocolately with some caramel in the background. Toasty, nothing resembling coffee, but a lot of chocolate and vanilla and caramel and toastiness. Creamy mouthfeel, not a lot of carbonation. Very enjoyable, especially on a cold day."
""
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees . The beer was dark and poured no head at all. Even though it did have good lacing I was surprised of no head. The beer smelled like caramel and had a nice creamy taste. There was a slight bitter finish but it was not too bad. Liked the beer and would buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A solid porter that might have a touch too much carbonation. It has enough flavour to keep it interesting and also has terrific balance. I could drink a few of these."
""
""
""
""
"I'm fine with breweries going so on-the-nose with style guidelines (as Samuel Adams typically does) so long as they do it properly. Indeed, this is a buttoned-down, to-the-point porter if ever there was one, but it's good. Here's an idea: Drop the ""holiday"" part - or else explain to me what makes this ""holiday-ish"" - and offer the porter as a year-round offering."
""
"O - A decent porter, nothing great. But do get it every holiday season."
""
""
"Would I buy this beer again? Probably not."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, a good porter. Nothing amazing, but good."
""
""
"M: Pretty full mouthfeel that lingers a bit. Very smooth as well."
""
"Overall - A pretty good Porter offering from Sam Adams but definitely some room for improvement."
""
""
""
"Overall: Overall, not terribly bad. It's rare to find decent porters, and this fits the bill."
""
"Black in color with a thin but lasting tan head. Sweet chocolate aroma with a heavy dose of roasted malts. Delish and complex yet light enough to be a session beer and everyday drinker. Very sweet for the style but not in a bad way. Lot's of roasted flavors. Hints of chocolate, vanilla and coffee. Very well balanced. Thin enough in the mouth to go down easy yet not so thin it's boring or watery. Not great but a very solid offering for the Holidays from Sam Adams."
""
"This is a decent porter and would be something I'd readily recommend to anyone looking to try the style with a name ""they can trust."" Sam could probably remove ""Holiday"" and keep this around all year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not my favorite Porter but I wouldn't say no to it either"
"O - Samuel Adams Holiday Porter is a good entry into both darker beer and spiced holiday seasonals with it's chocolate and cocoa malt flavors and subtle English hop earthiness and herbal spice. Not too robust, putting back more than one of these dry, roasted porters wouldn't be too much of a chore."
"Overall: ""Holiday Porter", I am not quite so sure but a good one...YES definitely indeed. I like this beer a lot and easily my favorite in Sam Adams winter variety pack. Salud!"
""
""
""
""
""
"An easy drinking porter. Taste was a little off in this bottle but it's been better before."

"O - Pretty decent, but nothing really makes it stand out; Easy drinking porter--I could easily see having multiple of these in a sitting; I probably wouldn't seek this out, but if it's included in Sam Adams Holiday 12-pk again I'd be pleased to enjoy this next year."
"this holiday porter from samuel adams has a rich deep boardering on black color. held up to the light you can see a crimson hue around the edges. the smell is nutty with smokey traces. the taste is rich and dark, almost similar to the boston lager if you took it further. this is pretty drinkable for a dark beer. as dark as it is you could drink a few of these. i would drink this more often if it was available year round."

"Happy Holidays!"
""
""
""
"Overall â€“ A nice holiday take on a porter that is very smooth and drinkable with a nice light hop flavor. A great widely available winter brew."
"O: Enjoyable brew. Not my favorite out of the winter variety pack but a solid beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O â€“ This is a decent porter. The taste stressed the roasted malt more than the nose suggested, which is fine. The biggest problem that I have with the beer is probably the blandness of the taste. There just isnâ€™t much complexity or richness here. Nevertheless, this isnâ€™t a bad beer and itâ€™s definitely drinkable. I wouldnâ€™t turn one down, but I probably wouldnâ€™t seek it out myself."
"O: probably my favorite beer in the winter classics"

"O: The Holiday Porter is not at all what I expected, but in a way I should have expected it. Sam Adams, although domestic, brews very original, crafty beers. If you're used to your run of the mill porter and someone hands you a Sam Adams porter, it's going to be different and something you don't expect. It is indeed a dark beer and has a sort of acquired taste, like a porter, but it's hoppy and near-fruity taste are a delight you didn't see coming in an interesting way."
"O - A decent and drinkable porter, but nowhere near rich enough or flavorful enough to be considered memorable. A decent enough additional to the Winter Classics craft pack, but doubt I would seek it out over other available porters if it was available on it's own."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle to a winter warmer pint glass. Dark black with hints of amber in the light. Huge head, three finger retention with tons of lacing; everything you want it to be! Mouthfeel is a bit thin and metallic. Roasted, somewhat burnt and estery. If I could mix this with Sam Adams Chocolate Bock it would be the perfect mix for a Chocolate Holiday Porter. A solid beer for sure and the presentation is exceptional. I would recommend this one."
""
"another goodie from the winter mix this season, this porter is inherently english in style, but with a couple of clever twists. it pours dark dark brown, hardly letting any light pass through, and an inch of off white head. the nose is sweet, more like a cream stout than a porter, and tons of deep roasty to burnt sugary malts. i though the flavor was great, lots of caramel sugar, as the malts used dont hide much at all, some coffee notes, but a lot of lactosey sugar on the back end. the feel is smooth as anything, but there should be a little more carbonation. the body is pretty full, i wouldnt need a ton of these to be satiated. overall though, this is a really nice porter, works perfectly in its small dose winter 12er context, and i appreciated this effort from sam. something different and tasty, a sweet treat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The second best reason to buy the holiday variety pack. I'd drink this any time of the year."
""
""
"Overall, it was a very pleasing to the eyes and surprisingly good taste to the mouth for a full-bodied porter I will definitely partake more of in the coming days."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Pretty good, I'd say it's more like a really malty brown ale. The malts are really nutty and it's pretty well balanced with the hops. Metalic twang seems to be a reoccurring event with these winter pack sam adams, and it lingers and stays in your mouth long after drinking the beer. I might as well throw a handful of penny's in my mouth..."
""
""
""
""
"The rating on this site is appropriate, but I feel like many people that don't come to this site would overlook this beer. It's above average, and a very good porter. Looking forward to bottle number 2 in my variety pack."

"Pours a dark brown color. 1/4 inch head of an off-tan color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of hops, pine, slight sweet malt, roasted malt, hint of spice, and a hint of caramel malt. Fits the style of an American Porter. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight caramel malt, slight roasted malt, hops, and a hint of pine. Overall, decent aroma, blend, and body, but nothing outstanding."
"Opened this beer after a long day of work. It was a 12oz. Bottle in the winter mix pack from Sam Addams. I poured it into a pint glass. Not a lot of carbonation at first sight but would prove otherwise once I took a sip. The taste is nice with a smoky hint that develops into a robust dark malty taste."
"O - Not bad, just not really up my alley."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a tasty brew but I'd barely call it a porter. More of a dark autumn brew. Nonetheless, the balance is there."
""
""
""
"From the winter sampler collection. Not sure what I was expecting from this beer but what I got was a decently well balanced, lightly sweet, mostly dry, faintly smoked, pretty easy to drink brew. Black coffee sweetened with cola and a touch of boozy warmth. This beer is a nice sample to have amongst a sampler."
""
""
"Poured into a Samuel Adams perfect pint glass. Pours slightly translucent dark brown with a thick, light tan head. There is some ruby red visible at the edges of the glass where the light penetrates. This beer smells like a porter should. There are some nice aromas of dark roasted and caramel malts. The Munich malt also helps add some of that bready sweetness. The hops are herbal and earthy in the aroma. The flavor includes dark roasted malts, caramel sweetness, some bready character, and a nice herbal hop bite. There are also some chocolate and coffee notes as well. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is slightly dry and the beer is smooth. The drinkability is high. This is an excellent beer."
""
""
""
"Pouring a very deep red, courtesy of the four types of malts they use, there is a subtle sweetness on the nose, typical of beers that add oats to their mixture, which this one does. There also appears to be a slight metallic tang that I'm a bit leery of, but perhaps that's just a characteristic of one of the three types of hops they use (though my research suggests that all three are mild). Regardless, on the tongue there is a pleasant hop bite, reminding me more of a light IPA than a Porter, and while the oats give it a satisfying chewiness, bringing some balance, the effect is fleeting, leaving one with a weak aftertaste and a feeling of being let down. To be blunt, I'm not that impressed; I prefer my Porters and Stouts with more body and weight, and while this might be considered a Light Porter, good with a simple burger or meatloaf as well as an introduction to the style, there are better examples out there. Cheers!"
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and caramel. Taste is much the same with a mild herbal hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and slightly medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty tasty, although not very robust in the malt section."
""
"O - Drinkable. The highlight of the beer is its mouthfeel and drinkability. No smells or tastes overwhelm nor entice, but the feel is great. I didn't know if I was in for a spiced beer as the name is ""Holliday Porter"" but I perceived none. A beginner porter but flavorful nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Decent porter, though the hops come on too strong in the back end, burying much of what makes a porter, a porter. Still, not a bad beer overall."
"Overall: A classic and continual favorite from Sam Adams. I've always looked forward to this and Old Fezziwig in the winter variety packs from SA. However, it can still surprise me even now with something I never noticed before, like the addition of German noble hops to an English-style brew."

"From a bottle to a duvel tulip. Pours a midnight brown with an inch of tan head and decent lacing. Aroma is toasted malt, ginger, orange peel, and lemon zest. Taste is roasty. Toasted malt smoke, orange zest, and cinniman sugar. Thin mouthfeel. Nice porter, and I get it evey Christmas."

""
"This is a solid beer. Not quite to the level of my favorite (Edmund Fitzgerald) but I would put this up against beers like Sam Smiths or Anchor Porter. Wish this was a little easier to get year round. Definitely would go for this again."

"Pours an opaque black with a thick tan head that leaves lacing on the glass. Aroma is sweet and malty, and almost sherry-like. Flavor is not typical for a porter. There are some subtle roast flavors, but in general, this beer tastes grainy, hoppy, and malty. Some coffee-like acidity in the aftertaste. Hops are a little too present; body is a bit too thin."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out almost black with a two finger sand colored craggy head that doesnâ€™t stick around for long but leaves behind some decent lacing. Aroma is a musty / earthy and noble spice hop crust on a roasted chocolate malt scent. Flavor follows the noseâ€™s guidelines, but also punches in with some herbal and grassy hop accents. Medium body with a smooth inoffensive texture. Nicely done!"
""
""
"M - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation pretty smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is a nice Sam offering and I enjoy it quite a bit. I would have no problem picking up a Winter sampler case again."
""
""
""
""
"Blackish caramel colored body with a one finger gead. Head stuck around for a decent time followed by some spider lacing. The smell is a bit hoppy, chocolatey with some warm spices. Good flavor.. some hops and a touch of chocolate. Well balanced with a clean finish. Carbonation is somewhat high imo but its still tasty. Medium to thin bodied. Easy to drink and enjoyable at the same time. Nice edition to the holiday sampler. Giod job mr.adams"
""
"O- A very nice porter. Not the first time I have enjoyed this beer and definitely hope that it is not my last. A very solid porter by the great folks at the Boston Beer Company."
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown in appearance with a fuzzy tan cover that fades to a stubborn patchy head and fair traces of lacing. The aroma brings licorice spruce with hints of root beer malt. Pleasant. The flavor comes on with a different direction that accents charcoal and a touch of creamy chocolate. Subtle cranberry and a slightly evergreen/herbal hop idea. Medium-plus bodied it presents a satiny, plush feel that may be its greatest characteristic. Very nice flavor with a scrumptious footprint that slides down so easily. A very good holiday brew that represents the style well."
"O-very decent porter, respectable and a nice treat with the holiday sampler pack"
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very nice beer. If you like porters, you'll like this. Maybe not the greatest on the planet, but very solid. Nice"

"If you're a fan of porters I think you'll be pretty happy with this one. It's neither too sweet nor too bitter, and very drinkable. I grabbed this little baby recently with a Sam Adams seasonal sampler, and it stood out as one of the better beers in the mix, though not the very best. They've pretty much pulled all of these off the shelves where I live (as the holidays are over), so you should definately give this one a try if you can find it."
"12oz. bottle, chilled. Pours a very dark brown, has a big foamy head. I like the appearance and aroma, there is a classic yet impressive feel to it. The mix of chocolate malts and English hops gives it a nice depth of taste, and it has a medium-thick body to it. Still tastes good after reaching room temperature, so you don't have to drink it really cold like a lager. This is a great porter that I wish BBC would make in a six-pack. Still worth the wait, a nice addition to the winter mix pack."

"O - A very good porter. Not the best you will ever buy, but if you are a porter fan, you will not be disappointed at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Those who are new to the bitter styles of beer should be aware that this one has a bit of a bite to it."
"O: I would hesitate to call this beer a true porter, of course I also think that Sam Adams stouts don't quite make it over the hump either. Call it what you will, however, this beer has good favors that play nicely together and it is intensely drinkable."
""
""
"Overall, not terribly impressed with this one, but not terribly disappointed either. It's a middle of the road Sam Adams brew."
""
"Overall- The nose was an experience, to put it in slightly nicer terms. I was let down that the flavors were also just really straight forward without much complexity. Not bad, but it is still a let down."
""
"Cheers!!"
""
""
""
"It would be interesting to blind taste some of these common Sam Adams beers with fancier stuff. I have trouble finding much fault with both this and the coffee stout. From the 12 oz bottle."

"overal im very impressed"
""
""
""
"tan head with little retention, very dark brown to almost black in color just as it should be. It has a good malty sweetness with a dark chocolate bitterness to it. It has good feel and overall is a pretty good porter , not my favorite but still good"
""
""
""
""
""
"M: A good old world porter, roasted and dry with a nice residual sweetness. The hops are also fairly aggressive, a nice little twist."
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouth feel is very bitter and dry, and just not my style. I will not be picking this up again ever, and probably wont finish the 2nd one in the variety pack. I think there are many better winter brews from Sam Adams such as Winter Lager."
"Not much was going on with this beer. A little disappointing."

"O: probably one of the better Sam Adams beers. the flavors don't wow you but they certainly aren't underwhelming either. Nice balanced beer and a pretty good porter."
"Well, I'm trying to figure what's so 'holiday-ish' about this porter. It's decent for what it is, but I get no 'festive' or 'celebratory' sense to this thing. Too bad this isn't offered as an all-around, middle-of-the road sort of porter. It's well suited for that role."
""
""
""
"Taste - didn't knock my socks off. It is an OK flavor, but not as full and rich as I expected it to be. Frankly, a tad bit on the watery side. A little hops bitterness, caramel, malt, a bit of coffee-like flavor. It's in the box and I will drink it, but would not go buy some on its own."
""
"overall this one's OK. some moderately enjoyable elements to it but ultimately a middle of the pack porter. along with the winter lager, probably my least favorite from the variety pack."
""
"Poured out of a twelve ounce bottle into a pint glass. Served cool. Pours a nice dark tan head with a nice dark mahogany body with red hues. Smells toasty and like a grain mill. Nice malt flavor. Well balanced with English hops. Light on the palate in spite of color. I would drink this beer again."
""
""
"This is a pretty straightforward beer. Not bad, not fantastic. A nice porter for the winter time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very enjoyable and an easy drinker. A solid seasonal offering. Nice way to start the new year."
""
""
""
""
"Cheers."
"Certainly an easy to drink and approachable porter, but the flavor is just way too generic."
""
""
""
""
""
"Body is light-medium, dryness in the palate. Light roasted malt along with sharp grass towards the finish. There's some burnt caramel and molasses, just a hint of dark fruit."
"Overall- One of Sam Adams best beers (I've never had the utopias) Its a great tasting porter that could stand up to beers double or triple the price."
"Started out on a high note as it looks gorgeous in the glass. However, the aroma is pretty straight-forward and a little harsh on the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I thought it was going to be better, but it disappointed be overall. I tend to give Sam Adams a better rating than Beer Advocate, but this one was just OK."
"[Note: The above comments concerned the 2011 version. I believe that the 2012 version was slightly heartier. In fact, I find that I am enjoying this beer more as the years go by - something unusual as I find many beers that I used to love rather pedestrian now.]"
""
"O: The graininess puts this flavor off. Haven't had a porter that was grainy. Not to good."
"O - decent porter, nothing too crazy about it. Just a solid malty brew"
"Creamy feel with soft carbonation. Overall not bad here. Stands out as one of the better options in the holiday variety pack."
""
""
"O - Great holiday beer. I had to look twice to check it was Boston Beer Co. This is one of their best."
"This was a dark opaque brown beer with about 2 fingers of tan head which quickly dissipated but left plenty of lacing within the glass. The carbonation was a little light and there was not much aroma. The mouthfeel was also a little light for a Porter. This was a good Ported, but not one of the best Porters. A good winter beer for the masses."
""
"A very good porter. One of the strengths from the winter sampler. Always a good decision!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I look forward to this every year. Very solid regular porter."
""
"Notes: Not bad at all."
""
"Good carbonation and mouthfeel. A very decent, quaffable porter."
""
""
""
"Taste is coffee, followed by raisin and malt. Finishes with a bitter citrus bite - grapefruit. A good solid porter."
""
"I recommend this as one of the bottles to keep out of the winter variety pack. Side note: why is the Boston Lager in this pack. You would think that the most common style from this brewer wouldn't be present in a seasonal mix pack."
""
"Overall: A solid winter brew. More hop forward and not as roasty as a typical porter. Still pretty tasty."
""
"O - Pretty good, probably wouldn't have more than one in a sitting, especially with the other options available in the style."
""
""
""
"O: Not something Iâ€™d have again. Minimal roasty malts, coffee or chocolate in the aroma or taste. Pretty bland - my least favorite brew of the winter pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium to light in body, sweet, mildly spiced, decent finish, a little dry but not too dry at all. Easy drinking and enjoyable, to summarize, a relatively light bodied, semi dry spiced porter, if that's your thing go get this."
""
"I give them a thumbs up!"
"O - A solid choice. Certainly not bad, and fairly well-balanced. Not quite at the level of other New England porters I've had however."
""
""
"Overall:	Not bad I would drink it again."
""
"O: This was an okay porter, but there are better ones out there."
""
"O - A really nice porter, holiday or not."
""
"Overall: A highly drinkable porter with a nice flavor profile. I wish this was more readily available as a seasonal"
"Overall: A smooth, satisfying porter. Makes me want to try a lot more of this style. Wish my wife hadn't already finished the other bottle from the Winter Classics box."
""
""
"Overall an ok porter, no worries there."
""
""
""
""
"Overall impressions: A very tasty porter. I was delighted to find a porter that was not overly heavy, as I usually am not in the mood for porters for that reason."
""
"Serving type: bottle"
""
""
""
""
"I'd go out of my way to try this again. For me an excellent ""ordinary"" American Porter that I will bestow with an A- rating."
""
""
""
"overall - an average porter."
"O: If you're looking for a nice winter pint to curl up with by a fire with a good book, this one will do just fine. Also a good session beer, as far as Porters go."
"Holiday Porter is reasonably good, but it isn't a standout of the style. There is some improvement to the overall effect as it warms. I'll finish the bottle but I won't pine for it later."
""
""
"wow. this not what the name would imply. sorta reminds me of bass pale ale. sessionable i guess. but where are the malts the label promised??"
"O- Decent beer but doesn't really taste ""finished", thin flavors"
""
""
""
"Taste is caramel, lots of malt a bit of chocolate and some hop bitterness. A bit of sweetness and bitterness together on the finish. Mouthfeel is good, drinkability is good. Overall this is pretty nice."
""
"O- solid porter, nice balance of roast, vanilla, and bitterness."
""
"O: This is a nice porter that displays a respectable balance of malt and hop flavors. Though I'm not generally a fan of heavily hopped porters and stouts, I have to concede that this is a pleasant surprise. It's worth buying the Samuel Adams Holiday Gift Pack just for this and Old Fezziwig Ale."
""
""
"Mouthfeel: It maybe a bit on the thin side but it isnâ€™t bad due to bitterness that first hits the tongue."
"O- easy to drink with an overall good flavor. Could use more body to it."
""
""
"O: A good example of a robust porter."
""
"O: A classic case of the whole being more than the sum of the parts. At first, I thought I didn't like it too much, but it kept becoming more enjoyable the more I drank it...aftertaste aside, this was a pretty damn enjoyable brew. Would I buy it if I saw it in a six-pack? It wouldn't be my first choice, but I would. It's a porter that really grows on you."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-overall this is pretty good. Weird mix but it works. I wouldn't mind having this again."
""
""
""
"The taste is strong here, disappointed by the appearance with practically no head and the mouthfeel seems just like their Boston Lager. Still a descent enough drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's a nice cheap good winter beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer adds further depth to the variety pack and is enjoyable. I don't know if I'd buy a six-pack of it if the BBC sold six packs of it, though."
"O: As a sam adams expert, lol, I'm gonna say this is their best brew, I would kill for a 6 pack of this. This straddles the line between stout and porter, if there even is a line to straddle. Whats most suprising is how sessionable it is, very hard to find with these flavors. Absolute must try for any fan of porters, stouts, christmas, america and chocolate."
"O: Good stuff. Not a world-class porter, but it's a solid, easy-drinking porter."
"Overall, this is a solid holiday-style porter. I do like the cocoa presence and the dry finish."
""
""
""
"This is an excellent porter for a beginner or someone with an aversion to the style. If not available choose Founders."
""
"Overall: Very drinkable. I wouldnâ€™t mind having a couple more on a cool day."
""
""
"O: I like this porter, it's roasty and smooth with minimal off flavors. The fruit flavor in the beer was a little different, but it works."
"The mouth is silky and then turns dry"
"A - Sampled from the winter variety pack, which is very solid. This particular porter is solid, not spectacular, but a nice one to have in the fridge"
""
"O-It was more roasty than I remember from last year, still a good beer, although the mouthfeel was rather poor."
""
"Solid brew by SA. I'd be OK with a sixer of these"
"o - goes down easy but not one of the better porters i have tried. not bad, but not worth going out of your way for."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a nice brew, tastes great, drinks smooth and kind of thin i would have liked a bit more thickness but the taste was real solid, appearance was spot on, scent was good then bad at the end, good overall brew"
""
""
""
"Overall I remember this beer being much better than this. Not much going on to make seem ""holiday style"""
""
""
""
"This is one of the best Sam Adams beers that I have had, and that is saying something. I think this beer is only available in the Winter Variety Pack, but it is definitely worth a try, as I found each of the beers in the pack to be enjoyable. This is one I would definitely recommend for the holiday season."
""
""
"Overall I didn't even come close to liking this. I will though, be open minded enough to, rate this on the style and not my preference. I tried really hard!!"
"O- Pretty good beer. Likely the most complex of the five seasonals in their winter sampler. I'd buy a sixer of this, if available."
""
""
"Overall this is just an okay brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice change from Sam's lagers, this porter is complex and drinkable at the same time. I could have two for sure. Nicely done."
""
""
"O - This isn't the porter I was expecting...there was an awful lot of hop presence that made me think of a Black IPA...tone down the hops and focus on that chocolate roast flavor and this porter would be pretty good"
""
"Dr: It's drinkable, but forgettable. Munich malt was a flat out bad choice. It doesn't feel like a proper porter, but it drinks like one. I won't be getting it again, but I'd happily try it on draught. Normally I find their seasonals to be better than the Boston lager, but this is an exception."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is medium with a rich, creamy carbonation."
"Overall - At times its hard to tell this is a porter. COuld be a spiced up winter warmer or even a dark english ale. Too bitter for its own good. All the typical porter flavors are masked a bit too much, and it takes away. Worth a drink but something i dont care to drink again."
"Earthy bitterness, dry roast, some unsweetened bakers chocolate and mellow coffee notes. Maybe a hint of dried cherry. The bitterness builds with bigger sips, leaving a nice dry coffeeish aftertaste. Smooth feel, light to medium bodied. Overall an enjoyable, versatile porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a decent porter, not something i would go to again"
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. The alcohol is fairly well integrated but noticeable. I couldn't help but think throughout this entire experience, that this would be an english version of a black ipa (only more focused on hop flavoring than bitterness.) Overall not a bad brew but certainly not what I was expecting based on the name."
""
"Overall- Average porter but not outstanding in any way."
""
"O: Despite what I got on the nose, this one suffered from lack of BBQ or wood flavor and if I had tasted this one without know the style beforehand, I would have pegged it as an Irish Dry Stout. I used to really look forward to this one in the Winter SA variety pack, but my tastes and standards have changed. This one was passable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'd say this is a great beer in the seasonal pack, but it's one of my least favorite. That isn't to say anything negative about the beer. The pack is filled with some other fantastic beers that make it tough competition. This isn't my first choice of porter/stouts but I don't mind having one after dinner on a cold night."
"Overall, it's an ok porter. Kind of average. But its price is decent. I'd rather have Boulevard Porter for the same price."
""
""
""
"Pours black with a one finger head that stays around and leaves crazy lacing on my bruery tulip. Aroma is what it should be for a porter, roasted malts with a balance of hops. Highly attenuated, taste follows nose, fairly dry, easy to drink, good easy to get porter!"
""
""
""
""
"O- Certainly a good porter, but does not stand out in any particular way from a lot of the others. Glad it is part of the winter sampler, but would not pursue a sizer of it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A pretty complex beer, balance is okay, I like the flavors, makes a nice part of a session if you're going through their Winter Sampler. A great beer to clean up your palate after their Chocolate Bock ;)"
""
""
""
"Drinkability-- nice, if you can find enough of it to drink. Decent moderate-ABV too."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Definitely a nice holiday beer that will warm you up for sure."
""
"Boston Beer strikes again, and this under-promoted beer was not disappointing, slightly better than expected. Not remarkable, but a good addition to their holiday profile."

"M: Rich, and sits nicely, covering the mouth well. This very nice feel may come from the flaked oats, which the Sam Adams website says ""is added to help round off any roughness from the highly roasted malts and add a touch of silkiness to the finish."""
"Very dark brown, nearly opaque, with ruby highlights. Fine tan foam, lots of streaky lacing, good head retention. Looks quite nice! Malty aroma, brown sugar and chocolate, toasted bread and a bit of roast, malted milk. Bitterness was mild up front, where there was more malty sweetness, and a little bit more pronounced towards the end. Milk chocolate and roasty notes, toasty, a bit of spiciness in the finish. Medium bodied with smooth carbonation, a bit of dryness from the dark grains. Overall, a decent porter that I rather enjoyed."
"The third of the Sam Adams winter pack, and it's another good one. Pleased thus far."
"Overall: The aromas are very subtle. Tastes just like it smells, but more pronounced. Drinkability is high."
"O- I've had much better porters."
"Dark mahoganhy color with a long-lasting, creamy covering. Sweet, creamy caramel and toffee malt and nougat aroma. More roast in the flavor...sweet and chocolaty with some black malt finishing with a mild hoppy brightness. Medium bodied, oily, and slightly bitter. Always nice to see this in the holiday mix packs."
"Pours a very dark brown with a large, light-tan head that diminishes very slowly. Scent is slightly roasty with faint hops and a bit of chocolate. Taste is initially earthy flavors with some roasted malt and coffee. Nice mellow blend with chocolate and burnt flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and creamy. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is a fantastic porter that I look forward to every holiday season."
"The taste is much more interesting. I don't get much coffee, and there's more of a hop presence that I expected. The chocolate and caramel notes are balanced by some vague fruitiness. The finish is dry and carries more of the roasted character you'd expect with this style. For me that balance really works and helps with the drinkability."
"O: solid beer, glad to have it in a winter pack. Cheap and delicious are my favorite features of beer. This is drinkable, but the aroma leaves a bit to be desired."
"Pours an intense dark amber-black in the glass, not quite lightfast, with a hearty cloud of foam on top. Granted, I gave it a vigorous pour but Iâ€™m still looking at a good two fingers of foam after a few minutes have passed. Cold, I pick up some muted roasty malts and a faint dark roast coffee on the nose. Itâ€™s a full-bodied porter, with a lot of roast on the palate. Coffee, without being coffee-like. Strong, satisfying, without being overpowering. What makes this a holiday porter? Iâ€™m picking up some â€˜holiday spices,â€™ in very subtle and layered ways, as the beer warms. Are they present or am I merely imagining it? Either way, the brew holds up as a sipper. Good job!"
"O: this is definitely the highlight of the SA Winter Mix Pack for me. It rounds out an already strong sampling of SA brews. Too bad they don't put this in 6 packs."
"This beer is very enjoyable and is perfect in the winter variety pack. A good pick for cold weather."
"This is a solid easy drinking beer. I look forward to it each year."
"Like It? Yes"
"O: This is the best winter beer Samuel Adams has put out. It is delicious and easy to drink. It is perfect on a cold winter night."
"Pours a dark brown body with ruby highlights. Head is full, tan and creamy. The head lingers and then laces the glass beautifuly. Scent of bitter chocolate and coffee. Taste perfecly reinforces the aroma. I could probably drink this year-round!"
"Poured into 13 oz tulip. Pours a light black, if held up to light can see threw it. Nice half a inch of white sticky head that leaves some attractive lacing. Smell is of dark roasted malts, some piney hops, and a little expresso, a little subdued. Taste is much more aggressive, some toffee and coffee with with the other flavors. Body is middle of the road, not too heavy or thin, plenty of life. Makes it very drinkable. This has been my favorite of the mix pack for years. The Black and Brew may have changed that for now, but still a fine Porter."
"O: A solid porter that is perfect for the colder months that are here and sticking around for a while. Not too strong, just nice and flavorful"
"This is a very well done porter. Wish it was available in six-packs."
"I don't have a lot of experience with porters. so don't have much to compare this with. Personally I'd like it better if the malt flavors were more prevalent with less of the hops bitterness."
"O - The Holiday Porter is a great porter and an enjoyable part of the winter sampler pack."
"O - It's pretty good. Not sure that it is particularly holiday-ish."
"O: A nice above average porter. Nothing mind blowing but holds its own against many I have had."
"12 oz into a snifter...decent appearance, dark with a fine head. Nose is fine, good porter character but pretty one-dimensional. None of the depth of better examples of this style. Taste is clean, but again, lacks depth. Not a bad porter, but if you're looking for a complex one, this isn't it. Mouthfeel is fine. Value was decent as part of a Sam Adams sampler pack. Sam Adams does lagers and pilseners very well...not so much ales."
"O: Pretty tasty. Classic porter. Not much else to say, but this would be a good regular beverage if it were available year round."
"82."
"From the eagerly awaited Holiday mixed 12 pack. Poured a dark reddish brown/nearly black color with a good brown head. Aromas of chocolate, roasted malt and coffee. On the palate, this one is medium bodied, with flavors of roasted malt, dark chocolate and cocoa."
"Overall, I thought this a good brew, with decently strong flavors to tantalize my tongue and keep me interested. I do have some quibble with how comparatively ""light"" this is for a porter, but I also recognize the variety of tastes that can come even within this style."
"O: This was a very good porter. Rich, smooth easy drinking fairly low ABV."
"O- really enjoyed this offering. this is much better from the sam pack"
"O: This beer is very easy to drink compared to other beers in the style because it isnâ€™t that filling and doesnâ€™t have that much bitterness."
"Mouthfeel is a little thick but not heavy either. Its worth trying."
"Overall, this is a solid porter and quite possibly my favorite beer from Sam Adams."
"O - This is a decent spiced porter. I recommend the winter sampler."
"drinkability: a nice nightcap, if youre not a fan of spiced beers do not drink this one fresh."
"One of the better seasonal beers from Sam Adams, this beer gets better every year to me; not sure if it's my maturity or the fact that this is a perfect winter beer to me, but either way I highly recommend this beer."
"No problems here, just a delicious porter worth a try."
"Overall: A nice little American porter that is perfectly suited for the weather. One of Sam's better seasonal offerings. Simple but tasty."
"very drinkable. i would drink it out of ""season."" some ""holiday"" beers are only good because you have a santa hat a mistletoe to distract you. this one is pretty good on its own."
"Drinkability- I saw this on my porch and realized I must drink it while there is still some snow on the ground. A good winter beer for sure, but two may be my limit even on the coldest of wintry nights."
"Poured this Sam Adams Holiday Porter from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. The beer poured black and had a thick tan or caramel colored head. Like most Sam Adams Ales that I have had, the lacing is very nice. The Aroma of the beer can best be described as roasted and slightly chocolate smell. The mouthfeel is off the charts, very smooth for a porter. The taste combines a very roasted malt flavor with a subtle chocolate finish. Why did I wait so long to drink this?"
"Holiday Porter is described as a ""hearty porter"" on the label and in this way it is very accurate. I love when beer labels don't lie. This is a solid porter. Boston Beer Co. should make this year-round. That's my only complaint. Why call it a ""Holiday"" porter? This shouldn't be a seasonal. It's just a good porter. Make it year round, guys!"
"Poured black in color with a nice foamy head that diminished quickly but had excellent lacing. The aroma was of smoked chocolate and coffee malts with a hint of grassy hops. it tasted of bitter-sweet coffee and chocolate. Mouthfeel was creamy with a dry finish. Overall a very nice Porter."
"D- I do enjoy this but in moderation....I wouldn't be able to have more than a pint/bottle in a sitting as the bitterness blended with the full flavor would become a little much...I think this is a very nice meal beer and could provide some good flavor to a beef stew. Another good showing by SA!"
"Overall: A solid porter, would drink this anytime someone handed it to me. A little hoppier than I would like and alcohol is too much. Wish they kept this beer year round."
"M/D: Very enjoyable. Slight carbonation ten relaxes to very velvety smoothness. Overall a great winter brew especially when taking into consideration its mass availability. Well done SA."
"Overall, a good offering. I like it in the variety pack but wouldn't buy a case of it."
"Certainly a drinkable and enjoyable beer but not one I'd find myself reaching for over and over during the course of a night. An appropriate and well-balanced nightcap, but it doesn't scream ""Drink more!"""
"A dark brown color and a sizable head that recedes slowly. Smells include grass, flowers and perhaps some caramel. The taste is a bit different from this. While there is quite a bit of a roasted taste, similar to a stout, the balance is not similar, giving a dryer feel. There are some hops present as well, for the aforementioned balance, and a bit of sweetness at the finish. Mouthfeel is creamy with some noticeable carbonation. Not bad, but frankly it doesn't stand out particularly."
"I tried to like this beer, but I really didn't enjoy it. As far as smell and taste goes, I got a lot of chocolate and roasted smokey-ness. Flavored tasted burnt, which everyone else here seems to enjoy but it was a bit off-putting to me. ""Smooth"" wasn't what I was thinking of this beer and one was enough for me. To me when I say a beer is ""drinkable"" I mean that I could put them down all day, but with the Holiday Porter I felt it was too heavy for that and a bit abrasive. By the end, I was kind of sick of it and ready for something else that was more refreshing. This beer has a mouthfeel somewhat on the heavier side that I didn't think was sessionable. Overall, I'm glad I tried it but it's not something I'd go for again."
"Taste-Chocolate malt, subtle coffee, toffee, nice hop bite in the finish. Creamy mouthfeel, nicely balanced and tasty. Would pair nicely with an English roast or a hearty chili."
"Drinks well. A nice winter seasonal."
"I poured this into a perfect pint glass, it has a nice dark brown body with a little tan creamy head that retain real nice. The smell is nice of burnt chocolate and roasted malts. The taste is of roasted malts with a bitter finish to it, i get a little caramel taste too. This beer has a bitter after taste to it. The mouth feel is smooth and i think is drinkable."
"D - One was enough."
"8/10"
"D- As porters go this one seems to be a little sweeter, but not in an unpleasant way."
"After tasting this I fear Sam Adams seasonal offerings are becoming more commonplace rather than unique. It is simply an average grade porter. It looks, smells and tastes like any other run of the mill porter. If this is your first adventure into Porterland or holiday-style beers, it is a good starting point. It's drinkable with a very noticable maltiness in the taste and a decent roasted odor. It felt a little light though. Not that I was expecting a heavy stout-like experience, rather this porter did not have the richness I was hoping for. A baltic version of this might add the extra punch that this one is lacking. Overall, I wouldn't buy this again if a porter that I hadn't tried was also present for the taking."
"The beer is not hard to drink, but the flavor is underdone at best."
"D- Overall, this beer is a little light. Easy to drink but not really what I look for in a porter. Kind of a combination of Anchor Christmas and Coca Cola."
"Overall not a bad beer. I have never been that much into porter's but seemed to enjoy this one. Not a beer I will buy of the shelf anytime soon, but its nice to get in mixers or winter boxes."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy with a sweet finish. The flavor is sweet with toasty and roasty malts. The finish carries a little bit of chocolate and nuttiness along with moderate bitterness. Overall a decent English style porter, but it isn't that memorable."
"I'd love to see what this brewery could do if they took some more chances. Many of their B rated beers could easily become A's."
"The one thing I'm curious about is...exactly what makes this a ""holiday"" porter? There's nothing particularly seasonal about it. There;s nothing that even makes it a particularly winter porter either. Just a confusion on my part, I suppose."
"This is just a very smooth porter! It may be a tough Session beer....But I would give it a try!"
"d-medium body and simple but crisp taste combine to make this a very drinkable beer"
"Poured from 12oz bottle from the Samuel Adams Holiday Variety set into a pint glass. Pours a clear, dark brown with deep red highlights and a thin tan head that leaves small swaths of lace on the glass. The aroma is rich and surprisingly complex - vinous malts, dark fruit, some chocolate, and lots of caramel. The flavor starts complex and bittersweet with sweet caramel malts, tangy and highly roasted malt flavors, and a light amount of earthy and fruity hop flavor. Notes of dark chocolate and sweetened coffee grow towards mid-palate. Sweet caramel start turns into a nicely bittered but still full and sweet finish. The beer isnt really strong, but has a slight warming effect on the back of the palate. The mouthfeel is full and creamy with a soft and pleasant lightness from carbonation. Overall, a very decently made beer. It has the slightly-too-sweet character as some other Sam Adams beers (like their Honey Porter, Brown Ale, and Black Lager), but this one isnt cloying (much, much better balanced and better tasting than the honey porter)."
"D- Extremely drinkable... each time I take a sip... different flavors come thru... I wish Sam would do more with porters... They seem to have a knack for it!"
"This Porter poured very dark, with about 2 fingers of just off white head. There was fantastic lacing left on the glass. The aroma was full of patent malt, with some coffee. The taste had the same coffee, a bit of coco and some acidity from the malt coming through. Mouthfeel is medium to light, and the carbonation is medium. Pretty drinkable, but I probably would not want to put away more than one of these."
"Overall: A nice solid porter with good flavor. It is smooth and balanced by crisp hops at the finish. A nice pleasing beer for cold nights."
"Drinkability: Meh. This beer is rather boring. One is enough for me."
"D: Tasty, but the sourness at the end is a little unexpected; I'd like it better without."
"Taste, a real thick consistency. Molasses, dark, dark malt all over this. Pronounced bitterness. Very light amount of charred mouthfeel to it. A slight licorice edge to it, coffee comes out more downbottle than it did in the nose. Pretty drinkable, good price, one of the better bottles in the winter variety pack."
"D: ok porter, but can definitely throw back more than a few. This is not a must have, but still solid."
"Drinkability: This is a very balanced porter that offers both a hoppy bite and smooth, roasted coffee and chocolate flavors. I could drink several of these. Probably my 2nd favorite from the SA Holiday Sampler."
"taste is between three distinct flavors of coffee malt and a a bit of hops"
"D - not sure what's christmasy about this but it is a pleast porter and great dark beer"
"Drinkability - I could have a few of these without any problem. Great lingering coffee/roasted malt aftertaste, it's almost like sipping on your favorite coffee in the morning. Very solid brew from Sam Adams. I'm impressed."
"overall it was alrght. i had high hopes on the look, but it let me down a tad. what can you do."
"D- I quite like this. Fulfills my porter craving with decent complexity and upfront flavors."
"Flavors could be a little less mild, but what's here is very balanced and satisfying. This is probably my favorite from their Winter pack, right next to Old Fezziwig. Highly recommended."
"D-i'm not sure if i should've expected more from a Sam Adams porter but i guess, considering the brewery, this beer is on par. As far as other porters go, this is just gross. It does however go down easily, but then again most american porters do, in fact this might go down the harshest out of the ones i've tried. there's still one more bottle in the fridge...anyone want it?"
"This is a really nice, spiced porter, ideal for the winter"
"D- This is a highly drinkable porter and I really enjoyed this brew."

"A nice beer to have on any occasion. Chocolate forward, not overly sweet, and some moderate roast notes."
"D: Overall I felt this was a solid porter, however its appearance and aroma outshine the taste and drinkability."
"D-Get out a knife and fork! This porter is nearly a meal in itself. I like that the burned grains are less pronounced than in other porters I,ve had (or mayby I'm adapting to them). Either way I,m in love and on board with this offering from Sam Adams."
"Worth a try."
"The Rest: Body is medium, smooth and creamy, drinkability is good and the balance is quite nice. This is a tasty beer!"
"The body is firm. Carbonation level is moderate. Smooth finish. This isn't the most bold Porter I've ever had, but it gets the flavor balance right. Roasted malts at the onset which gives way to a semi-sweet chocolate finish. Slight vinous acidity noted, but it's fleeting. This was a good beer for the cold winter. Best in the pack."
"D: Had mine with some crackers and cheese while watching the Winter Classic""Go Pens"" , would drink it again very easy to like this one. Thanks Sam Adams/Jim Koch !"
"Notes: A descent porter, a little light and watery feeling for my liking. Good flavor overall and a descent porter."
"All very easy drinnking, and flavorful. Great porter."
"Drinkability - Not a bad brew at all, but not quite my type. Still a good example of the style I think."
"D: Overall this is a quality ale and perfect for the holidays. But like many of Sam Adams offerings, it's a little light in nearly every category."
"D - The lighter mouthfeel and the enjoyable carbonation make this porter very drinkable. The very low level of hops does not create an improper balance and the deep rich flavors welcome a follow-up bottle(s)."
"D - I think this one is pretty drinkable. I like it, but I just think it should be a bigger beer. Overall though, I think this is a pretty good beer. I would try this one again."
"Drinkability is good, tasty goes down smooth and easy. Would say a very good porter except for the some what muted nose."
"D: Good holiday brew. Will probably have again...next Christmas."
"A nice chocolate and caramel beer, does remind me of the holidays, does belong in the winter classics sam adams pack. Chocolate doees work better in this than in the chocolate bock but i need to say im not a chocolate fan in the first place. So would probably be a lot better for fans."
"D - Good addition the winter pack. I don't think I would be running out to buy sixers of this but a solid brew all around."
"For what it is... a robust chocolatey porter, it's pretty damn good. I think a spiced version of this one would really be fantastic."
"Na Zdravje!"
"O: A decent porter, but it doesn't make it's case as a holiday brew. A bit to dry for me. I won't seek this out again, but I suppose it's worth a try."
"D: This is a good beer - nothing super fancy or special, just a decent porter. A decent sipper on a chilly winter evening - wouldn't be my first choice if there was a Founders Porter or Breakfast Stout sitting around, but certainly not a bad choice either."
"O: Nothing special, but pretty good."
"Its a good porter, but I got bored of it quickly. Fun to have one during the holidays."
"A solid porter."
"A great triumph of the Winter Variety pack."
"D - Very tasty and enjoyable, my favorite of the Winter Classics, so far."
"It is thick but not at the same time. I could drink a good number of these I think. Got it out of the Sam Adams Seasonal 12."
"This is the most singular beer of my life, right off of the bat! The head rose to slightly better than a finger, but it was of a most unique shade of mocha-brown. Lovely! It held in, with its rocky condition, until I returned from my break (ahem), at which time it began to fall leaving some lovely lacing behind. Color was a deep, dark-brown with ruby highlights. The highlights are the stuff of legend. Deep, rich reds at the edges, at the bottom and perhaps the sides of a porter, those were famed, boys! The nose had a dusty chocolaty odor, like a tin of cocoa had been overturned recently. Mouthfeel was MUCH fuller than anticipated, with porters having been watered down for their intended audience. I felt like an iron fist encased in a velvet glove had grazed my jaw with that first sip. It was soooo smooth and unobtrusive and then, Wham!, playtime was over! Milk chocolate, caramel, spice (perhaps allspice, maybe cinnamon) all of a sudden made an appearance. My palate was overwhelmed. Finish was slightly bitter, slightly smoky, slightly sweet. Zounds! I'll tell you what, my good man, you haul a cask like the one on the label over to Chez Wood and I'll send the neighborhood lad to fetch that big goose in the butcher's window to be roasted for the both of us, by gar!"
"D: Easily drinkable. Flavorful; especially as the beer warmed a bit."
"Drinkability: this beer is relatively drinkable, but I find the more I have the more some of the less desirable vegetabley elements start building on my palate. I think this beer is quite good at the beginning, but more than a glass or to would really start to wear on me."
"d - A pretty nice porter; another solid beer from Sam Adams.I enjoyed the smell a lot. Wish the body was a little thicker but still very solid. Would have again."
"This recipe needs to be a bigger beer. I love this beer and just feel despondent that there is not a 7% version. I don't necessarily want more alcohol, just a more reinforced flavor and a thicker mouth."
"Conclusion: Not the best porter I have had. I'm glad I tried it, but I wouldn't be looking forward to this every Christmas. It was like it was left in the oven to long, so to speak."
"Medium body and carbonation. Smooth, pretty easy to drink, but not all that exciting. I would buy this again as part of the Winter Pack, or as a single."
"This is a damn decent porter, and perfect for the samplers to enjoy in the winter."
"My favorite in the Sampler pack next to the Boston Lager."
"D-another decent samual adams beer. nothing stands out and a few small flaws but easy drinking and nice flavors. contact hitter with virtually no extra base power but consistently on base."
"Nice malty, bitter chocolate, molasses, toasted flavors. Good carbonation, smooth with a bitter bite and dry finish. This beer does a good job of balancing the sweet, roasted, and bitter. A very solid porter."
"Drinkability: It's no Edmund Fitzgerald, but this is a nice winter porter from Boston Beer Co."
"D: This was really easy to drink, but really not rewarding. No strong coffee or chocolate flavors that are typically found in porters, and no spices or vanilla that is typically found in holiday beers. Not offensive, but not recommended either."
"D: Not a real fan of coffee beer, wish it was a little heavier, its missing a punch. average brew."
"A nice holiday beer. Not an every day beer for me."
"drinks rather well. no-frills porter that has no winter spices or any other ""holiday attributes""."
"D - Drinks great for a porter, balanced and has great porter hints and flavor, Easy starter porter or for the person who does not drink much. Great flavor but the smell is kinda down. Overall drinks great!"
"This pours deep brown or black with a nice khaki head that sticks around for a while and some light lacing. The nose is a bit distant, but there are roasted malt notes that run deep underneath something lighter. On the tongue there is a mixture of Christmas-type spices, cinammon, maybe ginger, all riding on the roasted malt. In the mouth there is a really fuzzy feeling, warming but not from the alcohol, more from simple friction. It goes down easy and this could be a nice session beer provided the spice notes don't turn you off after a while."
"D- All in all a solid beer. Right behind ol fezziwig on favorites in the winter pack."
"D- Found this one very easy to drink. Wish they would but this one out in sixers for the season."
"D: Good drinkability. Not sure this is the porter I'd reach for if I had a choice, but would gladly accept one offered to me."
"D: My least favorite of an otherwise solid Winter Pack."
"D - all day"
"O: A pretty average Porter. I like the flavor and mouthfeel, it just seems a bit held-back compared to other porters."
"{description and rating confirmed/tweaked by tastings on 5/12/11 & 3/2/13)"
"A good well rounded and nuanced porter. Interesting and unique combination of flavors. Not stellar, but very good."
"un-enjoyable, Sorry Sammy wasn't digging this one at all."
"Overall a good beer. I've been impressed with the entire Holiday 6 pack."
"This one is a pleasantly bitter porter, it pour dark, smells smokey. Its the type of beer that tantalized the taste buds with a bitter sweet smokey taste with a dark smokey notes. Its not to strong, has a medium body and is a very drinkable beer, nothing too extreme, just a good beer."
"Drinkability: This is classified as an American porter, but it uses Fuggles and EKG hops. More like an English porter. Its flavorful, but there's too much roasted bitterness in this one."
"D: pleasant winter beer. Probably drinks best when paired with food."
"I will be looking forward to this beer every holiday season."
"A surprisingly nice porter. Great for everyday drinking around the Christmas Season."
"Overall I was pretty unimpressed by this brew. I tend to like my porters more on the roasty side and a lot lighter on the hops. This brew reminded me more of an English porter then an American porter, the bottle also suggests that it's inspired by English porters. This would be on par for an English porter, but as an American porter it falls short."
"D-Goes great with dinner, probably could down about two or three of these, definitely would have again."
"12 oz bottle. Pours dark brown with an inch of tanned head. Nose is dark fruit, molasses and some brown sugar. Body is crisp and regrettably thin. Flavor is bitter espresso with some fruity notes and not much else. I love Sam Adams but I'm disappointed with this brew."
"D - Overall, a very drinkable beer. Lots of nice flavors that mix together well and stay really smooth and crisp."
"M/D: A little lighter than expected, but smooth drinking. Overall easy to drink and pretty tasty, but the thin mouthfeel took a bit away from it. I liked it, but prefer Fezziwig."
"D- Good beer but not one I could drink many of at a time. Probably not one of my favorite porters but would not turn down."
"Not a bad example of the style, not nearly as pronounced in terms of aroma and flavor as other examples, but still pretty good."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with a May (2011) expiration date. Sampled on December 5, 2010. The pour is a luscious looking dark brown with ruby red highlights around the edges. The head is about a half inch thick and it settles down after a few moments. Faint dark malts and hops are in the aroma. The body is about medium. The taste is a but more exhilerating than the aroma with its chocolate malts up front and its modest hoppiness at the back."
"Overall - I approve. It's because of this, Fezziwig, Chocolate Bock, and the Winter Lager that I bought the mixer this year."
"DB- Drinks on the lighter end of a porter, not very rich but still a sessionable beer to me. I like the English hop and malt feel here, it works out well."
"Pours a deep, dark, garnet color that is almost black. Head and about average sized tan that dissipates pretty quickly and doesn't leave too much lacing. Scent is a bit faint, mostly dark malts with some cocoa tones. Taste was a bit underwhelming as well. Malty, roasty, and some chocolate tones as well. Mouthfeel was a bit thin and felt a little overcarbonated. Drinkability though, like everything else in the winter sampler pack, is pretty good. Not a bad beer at all just kinda felt like it falls a bit short."
"D: It's a average porter. I find the smell and taste lack a bit. There could a lot be more aroma and flavors. Which would make it a way better beer."
"Cheers!"
"This does manage to put me in the holiday mood. Goes great with the roast and potatoes I had for dinner. Bring on the winter!"
"The appearance is dark brown with a foamy head. The aroma is sweet and taste with coffee, molasses, and a touch of cardboard. The taste is like the aroma and rather average for the style. The palate is smooth. Overall is this a drinkable beer but not something I want much of. It's just average."
"Deep brown in color with thick, fluffy tan head. Great head retention and plenty of lacing. Aroma is muted malts, slightly roasted with a touch of herbal hops. Malty flavor with hints of chocolate with a lingering charred, astringent taste. Medium body and decent drinkability. Nothing to write home about here; as far as porters go this one is below average in most respects."
"D- I liked the complexity of this and will revisit it as it really does make me think of the holidays!"
"D - Very little carbonation after pour, drinks easy but the sour finish builds as you drink."
"Not terribly drinkable. Too many negatives. Disappointing."
"Very drinkable, albeit mild. Could use a bit more flavor but other than that, nothing wrong with it. Solid, good brew."
"Mouthfeel is a bit light right off, but the carbonation is good. I get a surprising amount of roasty/smoky flavor to it as well. There's a good bitterness to it as well. Overall fairly decent."
"Sooo after warming up, the carbonation is nice and light, aroma is very light, consisting of lightly roasted malts and bread. Taste is nice and mild, with slight coffee, toasted malts, and oats. Extremely drinkable porter, and not a palate killer. Nice dark session beer."
"Beer #4 from the pack is a little worse than I remember. Could use a little more sweetness to balance out the bitterness from the roasted flavors. Not bad but not great."
"This is a solid winter beer. Another great one in the Sam Adams Holiday pack."
"Not much of a head from this pour, less than a half of a finger of brown bubbles. Lace is defined and clingy. Color of the porter is a 39 on the SRM Beer color chart. Aromas of coffee, chocolate, toffee, molasses, and malt. Flavors I taste are chocolate, dark roast coffee, heavy molasses, roasted malt, and roasted wheat. Cream like feeling in my mouth and leaves a good coating on my soft palate. A flavor, but little heavy for every day drinking. Thank goodness it is seasonal, a few of these will put on the weight."
"This beer pours adark amber color; almost black with small lacing head. The smell is weak but you can make out the carmel and chocholate. The taste is well balanced. A nice smokey porter like taste with a nice not too strong chocholate and carmel flavors. A nice sipping beer but isnt too strong. Overall a nice flavor porter very enjoyable."
"Notes: A descent porter, a little light and watery feeling for my liking. Good flavor overall and a descent porter."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Mouthfeel is a little light. Carbonation is pretty nice and the beer drinks pretty smoothly. Drinkability is fairly high. Overall pretty smooth drinking and a fairly tasty porter, a nice offering."
"very awesome drinkability....wish they would make this a six pack"
"D) A well crafted porter. I'd have another."
"Overall, slightly disappointed with this beer. Much like the Chocolate Bock the malts seemed odd and hindered its flavor. I probably wouldn't drink this again."
"Final Notes: Yet another great beer from the Winter Classics packs. For those that like that roasted malt character and lots of coffee flavor. I liked it a lot."
"D- This was kind of a bummer for me. After having some of the other winter beers from Sam Adams I expected this to be a little bit more than what I got. ABV was hidden but it didn't matter much with the metallic flavoring in the ending. That brought this beer down to average drinking for me. I wouldn't really want another if I knew it was going to have the same bite in the backend."
"D - Tasty, low abv, and a great mouthfeel make this easy to drink."
"12oz bottle with a Best Before Date of Apr. One of the beers from the Sam Adams Winter Classics mix 12 pack. Pours a dark brown with some red hues to it. Nice head and lacing. Aromas of chocolate, molasses, roasted malts and some caramel. Taste is more of a mix of chocolate and molasses. Dark chocolate aftertaste. Pretty flavorful offering."
"drinkability - fairly average, not a good not bad, nothing special, came as part of the SA mixed 12 pack, so I'm not too disappointed with it"
"drinkability - with the exception of the mouthfeel, decent taste and good porter overall"
"D - great texture and flavor make for an incredibly easy drinker"
"This beer is dark brown almost black. Nice burnt mahogany quality to it. The head has a nice dark eggnog color. Its aroma is reminiscent of maple syrup and butter. The hints of butter continue on the palate. There's definitely a hint of coffee and toffee. It is moderately hopped. This beer will be very nice for the holiday season. Definitely deserves a place at my Thanksgiving table."
"D: It's not bad, but nothing to write home about. Due to it's thickness it's not the most drinkable beer."
"Has a staining quality, lingers and mixes well with the remnants. There's some sting from the carbonation, that's fine. A robust body so one will do for now."
"I'd qualify this as somewhere between an American and English Porter - let's call it a Newfoundland Porter."
"Drinkability is good. Nice solid drinkable porter. I'd happily have another."
"Pours a pretty robust dark color. Amber highlights to light, very dark. Head erupts and lasts with a rocky molded surface. In an imperial pint, it's a lovely sight. Smells of roasted malts, coffee, earth and distinct hops character. Taste is grainy roasted malts with a coffee bite. Finishes on a little too much hops. This is clearly a more English than American porter, with it's distinct bite at the end. Decent balance, but this beer seems to be nothing to get excited about."
"D- Overall it is a pretty easy beer to drink. The worst of the pack as of yet, but by no means awful or bad. It is hard to be above average on every offering."
"Feels medium in body, with some oily hop slickness, a nice amount of crispness and leaves the palate moist and satisfied."
"Slightly thin body and the coffee taste make it not as drinkable for me."
"SA Holiday Porter 12oz bottle into 16oz pint. Pours a super dark, ruby red hue with a light tan head. Big bubbles recede to a thick film with large bubbles around the edge of the glass. Smells of light coffee, chocolate notes, roasted malts, and a slight bitter hop character. Tastes closely to the nose, coffee notes, bitter sweet chocolate, and a slight roasted character, with moderate lacing left behind after first sip. A thin film remains throughout the drink with tight lacing left behind on the walls of my glass. Overall a favorite of mine from SA and a very solid porter at that. Its really a shame that these are not released in 6pk's or 12's."
"I was expecting something more than a straight-up porter from something labeled as a ""holiday"" beer, but then again I am never too disappointed with a solid porter. Poured from the bottle, it has a nice chestnut brown color and a thin, creamy beige head. There is nothing much going on in the aroma, but the flavor brings a little bit of sweetness with a hint of vanilla that is balanced against a good roasty, nutty base. Good body and good carbonation make this one go down pleasantly. Overall, it is a smooth, well-made porter that has a nice balance of sweetness and hearty roasted malts. I don't know if I would buy it regularly if it was available year-round, but I do appreciate its addition to the winter sampler."
"Again, just a pretty tame and run of the mill porter. Drinkable, but a little boring. Maybe my least favorite in the winter pack."
"Tastes are roasted malts, chocolate malts, with a slight sour cherry flavor, not predominant but it's there. So is the green apple Sam Adams yeast flavor. Mouthfeel is good, and kind of sticky. Drinkability is low on this. Overall, I wonder if there is an infection going on with this beer. I'm thinking about making a post about it, but then it turns into a full time job responding, we'll see."
"A solid offering from Sam Adams."
"Nonetheless, I'll drink it again, this time fully prepared for what it has to offer. It's just a shame that you're taken through Werther's Original and your family's sweaty unmentionables to get to something somewhat worthwhile...SA - rebrand this as what it is and you've got something there (plus I'll edit my ratings)."
"Overall, I really like this. Very British and legitimate. It has been a while since I tried some English Porters, this reminded me of them and may be better than some. Often an American Porter is not very exciting, but I think they nailed it."
"D - Because the taste didn't completely wow me, I'd most likely pass on another. Though, the mouthfeel is quite nice and this is a very easy to drink beer. Several of my barely - craft drinking friends loved this and asked for seconds, so i'll give it a couple bonus points here."
"All in all, an interesting brew. Rich and american porter-like with some interesting additions from the fuggels and kent. Still surprised by the level of hops and they way they come across... lingering bitterness is still surprising me. I'm not sure it's one I'd seek out regularly, but I wouldn't turn one down."
"Overall, it was nothing special. Like the Chocolate Bock, which is included in this same Winter Seasonal 12pk, its nothing i would miss once its gone."
"I really like east kent hops in a great many beers. They simply do NOT work with this beer."
"Worked well to scratch my dark beer itch."
"Drinkability: I thought this one nicely drinkable and enjoyed it. Each sip follows naturally from the last and I'd be happy to have another. I look forward to those I have left and will be quite happy to see this one again."
"D: Very good drinkability, i consider porters to be the session beers of the dark type, at least for me anyways. Decided to have this with lunch, i made an excelent choice."
"d: What a pleasant surprise! By far the best beer in the winter sampler."
"Drinkability: Even for its winter weight and thickness, this beer is extremely drinkable and enjoyable. I wish so badly that this came in sixers during the winter months, this is truly a fantastic offering from Sam Adams."
"Overall a pretty decent beer. Has enough flavor to keep it interesting, and one that would make a good choice for a cold winter night. Porter isn't my favorite style, but this is a nice beer."
"This is just not a great example of the style."
"Pours out to a dark colored beer with a thick head with good lacing and retention, not much carbonation to this beer. It has a pleasant chocolaty smell and when drinking it can taste chocolate, some caramel and to me it seems to have a toffee like taste to it. The after taste is a bitter like chocolate taste. This is a good beer that I think many porter drinkers and fans of Sam Adams beer will enjoy."
"Drinkability: Not a bad drinking brew. Taste is pretty average, but not bad. Cost point is good, availability is good, and it's hitting the spot tonight. I wouldn't turn it down if somebody offered it to me, but there are some better porters out there. Cheers!"
"Poured an off white head that lasted quite awhile to lace the glass nicely. Clear normal carbonation seen while held up to the light revealing a beautiful garnet hue. Aroma of specialty malts, roasted, chocolate, and coffee combine affectionately with a light resin. The flavor starts out dark malts that linger to the finish with a touch of bitterness that lightly accents the duration. Medium body, creamy texture, dark malt intensity all add up to result in a fine American Porter that is pleasing and well enjoyed after a hearty meal."
"Almost done with the Winter styles pack. This one pours a very dark clear garnet-brown topped by nearly a finger of light-ish ecru foam. The nose comprises light roasted malts, buttery biscuits, caramel, toffee, rye bread, and a touch of cinnamon. The taste holds notes of chocolate, wheat, rye bread, nutmeg, cinnamon, and the always-there roasted malts. The body is a solid medium, with a light carbonation and a very smooth feel. Overall, a very nice porter, but somehow falls short of greatness. It's highly drinkable, but seems to lack a certain roastiness or darkness or warmth (something along these lines)."
"Notes: In 2010 Winter Pack. Nice porter, but nothing really special. Earthy, nutty and spicy malt is pretty strong. Body is pretty nice. I enjoyed this, and it is a good addition to the Winter Pack, but it isn't amazing."
"Notes: Sam Adams Winter Sampler"
"D: super drinkalbe. (hey - it's BEER!)"
"D: There are so many good porters out there, I would not waste my time with this one. I'm glad that I got this in the sampler pack, so I can pawn off the other one to one of my unsuspecting friends!"
"This wouldn't be my first choice of porters, but it is a good beer."
"Very drinkable. A six pack of these would be nice. Hear that Boston Brewing?"
"SA Holiday Porter pours a very dark brown color, with 2 fingers of tan head that lingers for a few minutes, leaving some nice lacing. A very subtle nose on this beer, maybe some faint roasted malt aromas but thats about it. The taste is much better than the smell, lots of chocolate and coffee flavors upfront with a bittersweet, dry finish. There is also a nice amount of carbonation in this medium bodied porter. An average porter, nothing really out of the ordinary with this one."
"Overall the carbonation is too much and probably the most negative feeling I have about this beer but a worthwhile add to a 12 pack from SA."
"D - A very drinkable Porter, I could have a couple of these. SA needs to drop the ""Holiday"" off this and release it year-round!"
"I've found my favorite from the winter mixed pack. I love a great or even solid good Porter."
"MF/D- Good carbonation and a medium body linger on the palate, but so does the bitterness, maybe too much. Not a bad beer, but wouldn't buy it if was available outside of the winter pack."
"Well worth getting a sixer of. Definitely a compliment to a cold night."
"drinkability- pretty easy drinking a bitter over hoped for me like most american porters can be sometimes to call it extreme drinkability for a porter, but overall if you like the style its pretty decent example from the style not the best but still pretty solid, worth try"
"Overall: I'm a bit conflicted with this. I think the beer starts out slowly but ends up hitting the right notes, just not all at the same time or in a fashion that makes sense."
"was better then i thought from good ol Sam's."
"As for this ""porter's future?"" Not a bad beer, but not worth the hype either. I'll certainly buy at least one SA mixer this season, and so I'll surely be giving this beer another shot. Maybe second time's the charm..."
"Drinkability: A fine porter, but at times I think it's more of an English style than American porter. Still, tasty and enjoyable and I could easily have another by itself or with a meal."
"This Holiday Porter pours a dark brown, and has a slight scent of malts. It starts out with a semi-heavy taste that is slightly nutty. After a good full taste it finishes very smooth. Good taste and highly reccomended to try."
"D- Not really sure what to make of this one. It was ok but I was expecting alot more."
"D- Very drinkable. Thinner than a lot of porters which makes it easier to drink in my opinion. Nice full flavors. Complexities are slightly above average. Very nice beer for the holidays."
"Overall this is one of Sam Adams better non-year round beers. I am actually rather impressed. The winter 12 pack is especially good this year because of this beer and the Chocolate bock."
"- Overall I am very impressed with this porter... unique, balanced, and great. Stands apart from many many others."
"Another knockout for the Sam Adams Winter variety pack."
"Overall - Just a very full, good beer. I echo others who have asked if there is anyway to put this beer in a six pack."
"D- Personally I liked this one a lot, I could drink a few of them at a time if I felt like it."
"d: Great. I wish this and the Old Fezziwig would come in 6 packs or even four packs. PLEASE?"
"D - A yummy porter with good balance and a great range of flavors...another offering from the winter mix pack that I wish was available in a six."
"Taste and mouthfeel is bitter coffee with puckering astringency offset by a notable chocolate sweetness. Hops also help to offset the strong roasted flavors but overall a nice porter. Rather light but plenty smooth."
"D- A nice porter for anytime, it goes down easy but also satisfies at the same time."
"Beer pours a near black with tan head that laces up the sides of the glass a bit, looks quality. Smells of roasted malts, some vinous notes and chocolate sweet malts. Some light alcohol in the nose, good to warm up on a cold Midwestern Halloween evening. Taste is nice dark chocolate bitter snap and vague sweetness and the finish is a little dry but has a good cleansing bitter from the (English?) hops. Hmm, this is a really nice English/American interpretation of the style, would have been great I imagine with last nights filet. Mouthfeel is fairly smooth and not too sharp and bubbly. Too bad you can't find it in its own six pack, another beer good enough to stand on it's own."
"This brew has a very easy drinkability. It could surely catch up with you and give a good kick. A great brew from the Holiday Mix pack by Sam Adams."
"Overall, this is a tasty porter, and makes for a fine beer to sip on a cold snowy night."
"The mouthfeel was on the thin side for a porter, not harsh or anything but also definitely not a creamy feeling that I have come to love. All in all not a bad brew but not my favorite from Sam Adams, I think I liked the Old Fezziwig much better as a holiday type ale."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink. A beer that could catch up to you."
"Smells of chocolate, a lot of malts and some Noble hops in the back. Taste has that chocolate taste with the malts blending together to give a toffee/caramel taste to it. At the end of the taste though is where it really makes it unique because it has this bitter dry hopped taste that mixes with the chocolate. The blend of the surprising amount of hops used with the chocolate of course creates a burnt chocolate/dry finish. This beer is awesome and Samuel Adams really knows how to make a good beer hands down. The whole winter pack this year is awesome."
"Dark rosewood brown with amber highlights and a creamy light tan head that leaves some fine lace on the glass. Dark chocolate and caramel with some charred roastiness in the aroma. Smooth and rich, this is a nice malt bomb with chocolate, caramel and black malt flavors with a mild coffee-like bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied and smooth with a roastiness in the finish. If it were up to me this would be SA's winter seasonal, they released Cranberry lambic as a sixer and left this and Old Fezziwig in the mix-pack..go figure."
"D: Decent porter, nothing that I'd revisit though Not sure what's ""holiday"" about this. My least favorite from the mixed pack"
"D - I would have another one."
"Overall I would say this is an average porter, it is not bad but it is not interesting. It is also lacking in flavor too. Overall not a bad porter but there are many better porters out there."
"It's upsetting that there are only two of these in the Winter Classics variety pack, I could drink a bunch of them. Overall nice brew."
"4/3.5/4/3.5/3.5"
"Another win for Sam Adams and yet another reason I'll be buying multiple 12s of their seasonals at least until the promotional sale is over."
"Drinks fine, but could use more flavor & better balance. All too subdued to my mind for a solid porter. Not a brew I will look for in the future."
"D- easy going for a porter. Some good flavor lingers. It's definitely no Eddy Fitz"
"Pours a very dark brown with a thin head. Almost completely opaque. Nose brings some dark chocolate and hints of coffee. A little bit of caramel as well. Taste is roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, caramel, and some very mild fruit. Medium body with good carbonation. Out of all the beers that can be purchased at nearly any grocery store in the winter, this one is probably my favorite."
"Poured from the bottle into a standard pint with a tan head and dark brown color. Smell is coffee malts with some spice. Taste is definitely the coffee malts, with the spice less evident. Feel is crisp with a full body and ample carbonation. Overall a very drinkable porter and quite appropriate for the holiday season, regardless of the time of year reviewed."
"Served from bottle info a Samuel Smith imperial pint. Pours a dark dark brown with a one finger off-white head. Maintains nice lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt and spice. The flavor was of spice, malt, and a nutty/earthy note upon swallowing. It was light on the palate with high carbonation. Overall the flavors present were very light. It was not a bad brew but it also wasn't great either. It needed more complexity and stronger flavors and aromas to stand out."
"The mouthfeel was a little lighter than expected and seems to be missing something in the depth. I'm not getting very much smoothness in the body and only a very light crispness."
"Overall, Holiday Porter is a nice winter warmer. The smell and taste of this beer are great. It goes down smooth, leaving one wanting more. It's too bad this is only part of a sampler pack; it could be very successful if sold on its own in a six or twelve pack."
"Taste seems to follow the nose quite nicely. A fair amount of chocolate and a nice roasty quality. Some burnt notes, with a hint of caramel. Not nearly as much coffee in the flavor as in the nose. There is a pleasant slightly bitter aftertaste. Medium bodied, with just the right amount of carbination."
"Well I guess Porters and Stouts are starting to grow on me, while typically not my favorite style of beers. I have to say I am starting to like them more and more. That said this is a ""safe"" Porter. As my guest blogger pointed out while we spoke about the beer this sort-a taste like Guinness Stout Lite. Yep a watered down version of Guinness is right on the head. Smooth drinking, sweet chocolate, and caramel attack, with a nice nutty finish. Worth a try!"
"D: A bit heavy, to be sure, but definitely drinkable. This brew is pretty tasty, with a good mouthfeel and not overly heavy in the stomach. I could drink a few of these; good for colder weather."
"Drinkability - Relatively so. I wish I would have enjoyed this during the holiday season. I will always hold a soft spot for SA in my BA heart because they are what got me into craft beer. I will for sure buy the holiday pack next year."
"Very nice dark brown almost black, with reddish tints if you hold it in the light. Nice tannish, almost white head. The smell is much the same as other porters - a coffee with a hint of chocolate. Tastes much the same but with a hint of toffee perhaps. A bit sweeter than other porters I've tried. Still good though. Good carbonation. Would drink them all evening if I could. But then I'm partial to porters."
"Pours a dark brown to black with reddish highlights. The aroma is cherry, dark fruit, vanilla and caramel. The flavor is more of the same with a tobacco and tannic aftertaste, which was unexpected. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"I'm not the biggest fan of porters, but man do I Love this one. I know it says american, but the flavor and the label make me think this is what british porters tasted like."
"D: Rich, hearty, full, and robust - a holiday feast. I admit having a weakness for porters, but the nose and palate on this one are particularly decadent, immensely inviting, and superbly drinkable. My - hands down (and bottoms up) - favorite from the winter mix pack. I wish I could get this in a sixer."
"Poured to a dark brown with a ruby red tint and a thin tan head that dissipated quickly and left little lacing. Aroma was a pleasant lend of black licorice, coffee, winter spices and a touch of chocolate. Mouthfeel was full and tingly and the taste followed the flavors of the nose perfectly. Finish was warming, bitter and slightly dry. Not a bad beer at all."
"D: A good beer. Would try again."
"The flavor is big on the roast flavor coming from the malts with the lighter sweeter cream flavor and any kind of spice flavor serving to complement the roasted part. The end has a slight hop bitterness that's a little grating with the malt flavor but overall it finishes crisply. The mouth feel leaves a little to be desired, it's a bit on the watery side. Overall not bad, somewhat tasty, and drinkable."
"Cheers!"
"D - not very impressed, great to look at, and sniff...but the flavor does nothing for me. could easily list a dozen porters i would prefer."
"Medium body, with medium-to-high carbonation. It may just be this sample, but the carbonation has a little too much bite for a porter. Also, I think a little more body would be appropriate, as it's tipping towards being a bit thin. Overall, though, very enjoyable porter with a unique malt complexity that certainly differs than most typical examples in the marketplace today."
"D - Would tire easily."
"Taste is a bit more simplified as a few of the flavors stand out. I am getting cinnamon, coriander and orange peel to go along with some roasty and chocolaty malts. Mouthfeel is on the thin side and there is not a whole lot of sweetness in here. Hop bitterness comes in late and is accentuated a little by the roast. The spicing on this beer make me think of a wit mixed with a porter. Not a huge fan, but an interesting brew that is worth drinking a couple of every year with the holiday pack."
"I find this to be a very enjoyable porter from SA and would reach for it again."
"Notes: This might be my favorite Sam Adams to date. It isn't the biggest porter ever, but it is good, fairly traditional. A good darker beer that you can just sit back and have a few of."
"D: Decent drinkability. A bit heavy and filling as a porter should be."
"I wouldnt call this heavy but not a light feel either, overall a very drinkable beer that i could have a few of easily with some food, a decent brew from the BBC."
"This Holiday Porter is a tasty part of the winter sampler by Sam Adams."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: A heavier beer but still enjoyable. Light carbonation really lets you taste the different malt flavors in the beer. Very good holiday brew."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has an oil like black color and a 2 finger off white head that leaves a nice cap. The aroma is mild of chocolate, coffee, burnt caramel, and some almond. The taste is chewy with some bold roasted malt, slight hop finish to balance this brew. Not very sweet, almost like unsweetened chocolate. I have had better, but this is a decent brew I would not mind a few more bottles of."
"D- A decent drinking porter, but nothing too special."
"D: High, this is definitely my favorite in the Winter mix 12 pack. Truly a shame there are only 2 of these."
"Mouthfeel is a bit coarse (like it sticks or lingers on the back of the tounge), which I kind of like. Pretty good brew, overall."
"for such a thick (someone said this was watery???), seasonal drink, it's quite drinkable and a pleasure to the beer geek as well as to the novice geekoid. not sure i'd session it. it's more to linger over. 2 or 3 tops."
"Samuel Adams Holiday Porter very much looks the part; however, it pales in comparison to many year-round porters. It was more like a black lager, as it lacked character in the flavor and feel."
"i actually do like this much better than the first one i had, but i wouldn't make this a regular event."
"If this beer was produced by a small brewer the scores would be higher."
"D: A very nice beer, albeit I didn't really find it too Christmasey. Wouldn't stop me at all from buying it again, however."
"Unfortunately one of the least exciting porters I've had. Has very little flavor, and the mouthfeel is a bit off. Not very ""holiday""-ish either; I would have expected it to be a bit more spicy or something."
"---Three years later I revisit this brew on 12/15/2012. A bit different but no different overall. Offers less of a smoky tobacco aroma but nothing stands in its place. Caramel sweetness and spice level is more subdued and the color looks a shade lighter. Just kind of flat overall."
"This poured and smelled like a porter but drinking didn't really feel like a porter."
"Very drinkable...I liked it as is, but was expecting more roasted flavors or some spices..."
"D: good large sipper, would be great with instead of milk and cookies"
"D - Very drinkable. Great for dessert or a hearty dinner."
"What else to say ... Happy Holidays!"
"D - A nice, rich holiday beer. And a very good porter."
"D: Like most of the other Sam Adams beers, a very easy drinker. I wish it wasn't quite as sweet, but it's still a decent beer and easy to have a few of in a sitting."
"Medium mouthfeel. At 5.9% this has great drinkability and is definitely a nice winter treat and a tasty porter."
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with a nice creamy head that sticks around and leaves good lacing. Smells a bit of chocolate. Taste is great, kind of tastes like Christmas cookies in beer form. Chocolate, dough, nutmeg, biscuits. Mouthfeel is a little thin but spiky with weird feeling carbonation. Very good beer, maybe my favorite Sam Adams so far. I prefer this to Old Fezziwig."
"Drinkability- pretty good, I enjoyed it."
"D - True to its name this is a nice winter beer. Light but with a nice dark flavor to fit a cooler weather."
"Overall, this can go down real easy, but you still tend to sip. Flavors are solid but not overly muscular. I would have liked a bit more intensity. Also, this is a beer that takes sharp turns/corners. Not as smooth as I would have liked. Good solid porter overall, but I don't think I'd seek this if it wasn't in the holiday 12 pack. If you see it at a party, try it, but don't buy a 12 just to taste this."
"D - This would make a great mindblower if you hand it to someone who's just finished a lighter-flavored lager or something less flavorful. This isn't the most complex beer I've had, but it's flavorful enough to be enjoyable. It is a bit filling and rich, though, so if you don't like lingering aftertastes or oaky or hoppy mouthfeel then you might not enjoy more than one of these. The flavor lingers on for a while and may influence the taste of beers you have afterwards. It's nice to get a couple of these in Sam Adams' seasonal sampler, though. I'd say have just one of these and then have something with a strong contrast to the porter taste, like an IPA or something hoppy to clear your tastebuds."
"Pours black cola with fleeting white head. Smells of chocolate cola, malt, subtle dark fruit. Dark flavors of chocolate, cola, some syrup and dark sugars. Thick in body but not as milky as most porters. The ABV works in your favor for drinkability and none of the tastes get on your nerves after a while. One of the better winter classics for Sam."
"Pours a clear very dark brown, with red highlights. Thin tan head. Smell is of toasted malt and cinnamon. Taste is quite spice oriented, cinnamon, orange, and ginger are what I taste. A light malt middle, and a slightly tart finish. Mouthfeel is slightly watery, medium carbonation. Pretty drinkable, this is a good beer, though a bit too heavy on the spices IMO."
"Poured into a Sam Adams glass. Very drak brown, almost black body with an off-white head. Laces nicely. Big malty aroma. Very smooth taste, very slight bitterness be covered by the malty sweetness. Another good holiday brew that I wished came in a 6-pack."
"This beer is highly drinkable. I will look for it again next year."
"Pours coal black with a hint of a light tan head and a bit o' lace for interest. Smells a little like burnt toast but not that acidic. Taste is biscuity malt up front, followed by a sharp, almost burnt roast and then a crisp finish. I can see this going well with a sweet-ish meat dish. Mouthfeel is soft and pleasantly carbonated. Drinkability is good but a bit too roasted for me to settle in for the evening with this one. A good, approachable version of the style, it maintains more biscuit than burnt and that maintains my interest."
"D - Had one and that was good enough. I really wanted a lager after this one since it let me down a bit in flavor. Out of all the beers in the winter seasonal the Old Fezziwig Ale was the best."
"d - as stated above, a very drinkable porter, definitely a beer I could drink all night despite the relative lack of complexity"
"Tastes: Sweet at first, with a lot of coco-coffee malt, rich in texture. Has a great full flavor with a nice balance of hops on the finish. This is a great porter, especially for the winter, holiday season. If you get a chance grab a bottle, start a fire and enjoy."
"Pours a translucent dark brown/ruby. Smell is of good, robust malts and a shade of hops - an impressive odor. First taste is thick malt that blends into a rather soothing hops background, with a substantial amount of dark bean bitterness. Mouthfeel is nicely complex and pretty bold for a porter. This is my favorite of the holiday beers in the 12 pack sampler."
"overall, this was a very nice brew i enjoyed it the acidity isnt overpowering but it is present and it is what keeps this out of excellent status"
"A good, solid, middle of the road porter. Nothing particularly outstanding, but nothing very offensive either. The taste didn't appeal much to me. I would drink SA Holiday Porter again, just wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"The appearance of this beer is very dark with a large head. The smell of the beer is not very unigue but the taste stands out to me due to the smooth and kinda sweet taste to it. For a dark beer it is not very heavy to drink. I would recommend this beer to someone who doesn't like dark beers to try it because it may change how they taste them. I would most definetly like to try this beer again. I bought this beer in the Winter Brew 12 pack."
"This beer is one of the highlights in the Sam Adam's Winter pack, and for me falls just short of the Old Fezziwig. Nice dark appearance with a decent amount of tan head. Smell is sweet with strong coffee and chocolate, with lighter hints of spice and caramel. Taste is very similar to the smell, with roasted caramel malts and a hint of hop spice. Mouthfeel has a little too much in terms of carbonation, though when it dies off it has a good body. I could enjoy this beer often, but after one or two I think I might start getting a little full. Overall a nice Porter and something I can look forward to during the holiday season."
"Very dark mahogany, not quite black with some burgundy showing through at the bottom, and a tan head that dissipates and leaves some decent stickiness. Coffee and chocolate are present in the smell, but it is the caramel presence that takes the real lead here. A sweetness in the nose that i can't wait to taste. Taste does not disappoint me at all. Caramel is still very strong, and the coffee is coming through considerably stronger now. Very full bodied and with a sweet taste that lasts on the palate. Goes down very well, and very drinkable. This is a great beer to allow someone to try if the say ""I don't like dark beers"" because it doesn't feel it, it simply feels delicious"
"This is a good porter. Simple, but hits the spot. I wish this came in its own six pack."
"Drinkability: My favorite Porter. Also my favorite Sam Adams beer. Damn you Jim Koch for only having this in the Winter Pack. Edit: Deschutes Black Butte is now my favorite."
"What a great porter. Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. This beer pours very dark brown with some lighter brown highlights. Has a tan colored head that produces some great lacing and retention. The smell is good. Roasted and burned malts, a little bit of coffee, chocolate and followed by some hops. The picks up right where the smell leaves off. Th flavors are perfectly blended. The malts taste caramelized and roasted until a little burned. There are still the same hints of coffee, chocolate, and maybe even some hints of toffee/butter as well. The mouthfeel is very good. It's full bodied and smooth at the same time. All of the flavors perfectly blended together really make the overall feel of this beer wonderful, and yes this is one drinkable porter."
"Overall a very nice beer, great part of the winter sampler."
"Sam Adams has cobbled together an interesting 12-pack this season, with the Honey Porter and Old Fezziwig Ale clearly showcasing the fact that Sam's is very capable of brewing good beer. The Winter Lager was a little dumbed down this year, more like a modified Boston Lager (which they threw in to take up space), and then scraping the bottom we have Coastal Wheat (awful) and Cranberry Lambic (blech). Sam's just continues to confuse me in this regard but I'll take what I can get because this stuff can be picked up in any grocery store in my area, thus, I can recommend it to anyone."
"D - This is a pretty tasty little beer. Not sure if I would like to drink more than one though."
"D - decently drinkable"
"Not a bad example of a porter. Had a slight alcohol presence and traditional porter type flavor. Overall a pretty well balanced beer. Poured a dark brown almost black color with a tan head that lasted for a bit. You could easily have one or two more of these beers on a cold winter night. This beer and the Old Fezziwig are the definite standouts in the winter sampler. If you enjoy Fuller's London Porter I think you will enjoy this beer. Although not as good as Fuller's IMO, its pretty tasty."
"Overall, I think this is a pretty nice brew. Not the best porter ever but certainly the best beer in the Sam Adams Winter Variety pack I've had thus far."
"This is not a smooth porter, it's got some bite to it."
"Almost black that left a 1 1/2 finger head that left a good amount of lacing. The smell is strong with roasted malt, cinnamon and a little bit of hops, very nice. The taste is similar, first comes the roasted malt followed by nice tasting cinnamon, and a small hoppieness that goes down with a slight alcohol bite, not too much, not too little. great mouthfeel and good drinkablility."
"A solid, drinkable porter with a good character with roasted malt, hops and gypsum providing a soft water element."
"D - This is probably my favorite Samuel Adams beer, the only bad thing about this is that I have to purchase some of that awful Cranberry Lambic beer in order to enjoy this one"
"This brew is very drinkable and very good. Nice porter."
"D: Very tasty, would love to get a case of this. Not too heavy and the abv is descent enough to enjoy a nice session on a winter night with family and friends...very good stuff."
"Drinkability: The higher carbonation than I would expect and the heavy roasted flavor really killed the drinkability for me. I am pretty disappointed in this beer, which is sad because I was rather excited to try it after hearing good things about it on BA."
"Really good atmosphere. Great appearance, and a pretty basic but pleasing nose. Flavor, in similar fashion, is quite simple, but full and robust. I do think the over carbonated feel is a negative, and the peaty aftertaste doesn't seem to jive with the overall tone of the brew. Overall, this is a really good quaff, nevertheless."
"Overall a decent porter. I'm not sure what's holiday about it but I'm not complaining. A good session beer for dealing with the family."
"D: Easily drinkable porter that's pretty true to style. It's probably not something I would seek out on its own, but it's not bad and I'll gladly drink the two bottles that come in each winter sampler."
"This beer is also quite drinkable for a porter. It has a wonerfully complex flavor that changes during the drink. Another solid brew from Sam Adams and one I may be picking up again if I can ever find it in a six-pack."
"Pours nearly black with large, thick meringue-like head. Nose has aromas of pan heated butter, brown bread, and light holiday spices. Roasty flavors are apparent with a light caramel sweetness - somewhat resembling a cola product. Somewhat light bodied, and easy drinking."
"I'm going to end up marking this a touch higher than the honey porter. It's quite good, and there's no reason it needs to be just a winter seasonal, except for the name of course."
"Overall- Much better than expected. This might be Sam Adams best beer! So velvety smooth, creamy, and brimming with flavor."
"Taste: Flowery hop spiciness throughout. Much more hop presence than most porters. Really sets this one apart from all other porters I've had. Kind of a piney finish."
"D: Goes down smooth, the only problem, not a problem to some people, is that it is really heavy and fills you up fast."
"Overall, a pretty nice porter."
"(D)- A solid porter that definitely fits well with the holiday season. Sam Adams is a hit or miss for me, but this one is a good one for sure."
"Overall, a nice porter from SA. A lot of flavor with this one. I'd rather see more of these in the winter pack as compared to some of the others. Great beer, especially for the price."
"A very nice porter and I'm glad it was included in the mixed Holiday case, perhaps the best of the Holiday bunch!"
"D: Rather enjoyable, especially if enjoyed as I had it, with a shepherd's pie on a rainy day."
"D- This one goes down pretty easy especially as it warms, and the carbonation dissipates a little. I kind of wish Sam Adams would put this in a twelve pack rather than the Winter Lager."
"This is the first porter I've had from Sam Adams...didn't even know they had 'em until recently. Pours black with a three quarter inch creamy head. Smell is buttery malt with some burnt wood. Taste is predominated by a creamy and malty sourness balanced with a slight butter sweetness. It was a little drier than I initially expected a holiday porter to be, but it balances a lot more nicely when it warms up a bit. Medium-light and, again, really creamy mouthfeel. I'd say this is a real winner...too bad it's a seasonal, because I could definitely drink this year round."
"This is a really solid porter that fits nicely into a Winter Classic mixed 12 pack. I look forward to drinking the second one."
"Drinkability is nicely balanced, but maybe just a hair on the dry side. Still, tasty and enjoyable."
"Solid, easy-drinking porter. It does suffer a bit from a thinner body, but that may make it accessible to those trying a porter for the first time."
"The feel is pretty dry and pretty crisp. It has a nice medium body and goes down pretty well."
"D-An easy to drink porter that does not offend in any way, its very rich so i dont know if i would consider this a session beer, but it is very tasty. I will continue to seek this beer out every year."
"Drinkability: This tastes more like a spiced winter beer than the fezziwig ale does. its a little bit too thin but its tasty and goes well with the winter season. I would try again."
"Taste doesn't linger too long and is somewhat smooth. Medium heavy body very nice. Sam Adams Winter pack is always a good pick up. Desides the Cranberry its pretty solid, This pack always reminds me that BBC is still a good player in the craft scene."
"Drinkability: A decent porter and another good style representation from Sam Adams."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark brown color that is almost completely opaque. The head is a light tan that recedes slowly to leave some nice lacing. Smells of dark sweet malts with a little bit of spice. Has a nice roasted malt flavor with slight flavors of chocolate. There is a little bit of hops that come through in the flavor that are well balanced with the strong malt component. Overall a really good beer and very drinkable for being a little heavier."
"Drinkability is good and it goes down pretty easy. Its not one of the best porters that I've had but still pretty tasty. I could see this as a session beer since I plan to pick up a few more of the winter classics packs."
"salud!"
"d - great brew but def. a beer that should be consumed moderatly.. nothing against the abv... but just extremely filling!"
"drinkability is great - below 6%abv light flavorful - what more could ask for in a winter porter"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of chocolate and malts. Taste is also malty with notes of chocolate. Feels creamy in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this makes for a pretty good selection."
"Impressive appearance! Pours the color of dark cola with a billowy light tan head that dissipates, leaving behind sticky lace. Lots going on in the aroma--rich nutty malts, tangy plum, raisins, smoke, strawberry, chocolate, hazelnut, and rum (I nominate this to be a candle scent). It tastes more bitter than expected. Fruits are prominent in the flavor, and the chocolate steps it up--sort of reminds me of Neapolitan ice cream. As it warms, it resembles Anchor's holiday ale, and that ain't a bad thing. This is one of the best brews I've had from Sam Adams, so of course I can only dream of finding it sold on its own. Delightful!"
"D: Slightly heavier then other porters but its a ""holiday"" issue with some originality"
"Notes: Another great beer from mixed Holiday 12 pack."
"Verdict: Holiday Porter is certainly a welcome inclusion in the Sam Adams Winter seasonal pack and fits the season well. But, that being said, I can see why they don't offer it year-round - it's just not very compelling."
"Drinks very well, and warms decently for cold weather consumption."
"Easy to drink a couple of, though filling. Very flavorful."
"D: A solid porter. Rich and inviting flavor that goes down smoothly, as a porter should. In my opinion, the best beer in the Winter Classics pack."
"D-This is one of my first darker holiday style ales that I could consider drinking multiple pints throughout the night. It's smooth and clean and has great flavor. Very much enjoyed this brew."
"D - High drinkability. Not a very complex beer but it tastes good and is a pretty sessionable porter in my opinion. It was a dreary, rainy day and this hit the spot with a bit of chocolate."
"Pours a dark black color from the bottle with two fingers of rocky, off-white head--beautiful off the pour. I smell a sweet, bready aroma with lactic notes, and the sweetness turns out to be a nice caramel flavor when I sip. Also dominant in the taste is baker's chocolate, which contributes to an acrid but not unpleasant finish. That the beer is balanced without any overwhelming flavors or qualities makes it pretty drinkable. Mouthfeel might be a touch thin, and it leaves my mouth sticky, but I think Holiday Porter's other qualities redeem it, and I thoroughly enjoyed both bottles from the twelve pack."
"Notes: A thin Porter from Sam Adams that will not have me coming back for more."
"The feel was not too creamy, not too thin I think the texture was perfect."
"D: A smooth, easygoing porter. Fairly refeshing for an unrefreshing style, I could see myself having a few of these. Not too robust, no powerful or unique flavors. A fairly well balanced, if unspectacular porter."
"Pours an opaque dark brown with mahogany hues. Two fingers of tight foamy tan head has good retention and leaves nice lacing behind. Smells of chocolate, caramel, spices, nuts, fruit, and floral hops. Tastes of molasses and caramel up front, then some chocolate, roasted malt, light notes of coffee, dried fruits, spices, and floral hops. Medium in body with low to medium carbonation. Smooth, sweet with a nice bitterness. Well balanced, a good winter porter, easy to drink but not something I would session."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a nearly opaque brown/black color. The tan head was a full, three-fingers of foam that became a rocky cap that displayed good retention and excellent, consistent lacing. The aroma was semi-sweet, a blend of chocolate, caramel and toasted malt and spices. The flavors started with caramel malt, then went into chocolate malt, roasted malt, spices and the semi-bitter finish of Fuggles hops. The mouthfeel was average, the body full and the carbonation medium. Quite good, but their other winter offering, Old Fezziwig Ale, was better still."
"This is the hoppiest of all the christmas variety pack. The appearance and the aroma are excellant. The aroma is actually my favorite part of this beer. The taste and drinkability are just not there. This is beer that you can have one of, but not much more. The taste is alittle off. It is like it is trying to be an ipa more than a porter."
"Notes: This is a remarkable fall and winter beer to one through a cold night. Cheers."
"Pours a very dark brown/red colored body. Very big tan foamy head, lasting, okay lacing. Very malty aroma, nutty, coffee. Medium body taste, coffee on the mid-palate, light aftertaste. Some spices. Not too watery. Not bad. Some bitterness, good."
"Overall pretty good, not sure what makes it 'holiday'."
"D: I don't know that I would want to drink a 6er of these in one sitting, but this beer is a very nice nightcap. It would be easy to reach for a 2nd one. A nice beer and worth trying."
"Probably not something I would drink a lot of, but goes down easy and fits in nicely as a winter seasonal. Not incredibly complex but not bad at all."
"An excellent winter brew. True to Sam Adams style, a porter rich in flavor and aroma, excellent mouth feel, creamy with coffee background and perfect carbonation. This beer makes an excellent Black and Tan, is great by the fire, and though heavy, is not overly so. Great with a bowl of stew, or stand alone pint."
"D: Too strong and heavy to have more than one. Solid winter brew, but not a standout."
"Drinkability is good. I wouldn't seek this beer out at all but wouldn't mind drinking it at a party or something."
"D: Very drinkable for a porter. I would recommend it to someone if they've never had a porter because I think it's a very drinkable introduction to the style."
"Cheers to all!"
"Very drinkable."
"Drinkability: This one can be summed up in one word: Hearty!!! This is the perfect night cap to those cold, blustery nights. I can see why London Victorian-era luggage porters would drink this, as it certainly is a warmer upper for the body. If you find yourself in need of a bit of warming up during the holidays, I would highly suggest finding this porter, as it will do you good."
"D-Highly drinkable, a damn fine porter w/many admirable characteristics. Quaffing a number of these would be an excellent substitute to hibernation."
"A touch over-sweet in the finish and light on roasted character, but a solid, drinkable rendition of the style."
"Drinkability - Nice balance, very nice beer."
"Very drinkable, easy to have many back to back. A good porter, something I will definitely have again."
"D - Solid all the way around, you won't have any problem drinking this. Thoroughly enjoyable and satisfying, a real highlight of the Sam Adams winter mix pack."
"Pours an opaque black with a tan head that fades to a light film atop the beer. Moderate lacing. Faint dark chocolate aroma. Silky, smooth, moderate carbonation, very spicy, chocolaty, and malty are how I'd describe the taste. A nice holiday beer, with every sip the chocolaty goodness reminds me of the chocolates from the advent calendars I had as a child. I get this every year in the Winter 12 pack which I seem to pick up once a year, and it's perfect for the season."
"Holiday Porter's another excellent seasonal release from BBc. I really hate the they don't offer this and Old Fezziwig in 6 packs. They're both better than the Winter Lager. Perhaps they don't have the mass appeal. I don't know. The nose could use a little work, but that's its only real shortcoming. At any rate, this is a good beer. Check it out if you have the opportunity."
"This is one of my favorites from the winter mix pack. I would rather they make this in six packs than the honey porter."
"Good brew could drink a few of these."
"A nice porter, lots of roastiness and bitterness. Yet there is a nice fruity sweetness that cuts through this leaving a well balanced taste. Very nice."
" Feel is nice with medium weight and good carbonation. It cleans the mouth and dries it as well. So easy to pull out several of these during the winter and go through the night jolly. A brew to have at this time of the year."
"Mmmmm...could Sam Adams make a better porter? Yes. But, this is a constantly-anticipated offering each year that make me wonder why it isn't on draught in Boston. Come on! The pour is a hearty, full one with dark ruby-black color & a full tan head with great retention. While the aroma is almost a soapy malt with lemon, the flavor offers rich malt with bitter walnut hints & a dusty hop aftertaste. I could settle down on a cold night with plenty of these...."
"Smooth taste. This beer is a great sipper! Mouthfeel is smooth, nice aftertaste. I haven't been able to find this anywhere other than their holiday craft pack, which is unfortunate. Get 'em while you can!"
"Pours a near black with a nice tan head. The foam sticks around for a couple of minutes before reducing to a film; leaves behind some nice lacing. Smells of strongly of coffee and caramel, with dark roastiness taking a back seat. As it warms a lot of buttery notes come out--can't yet decide if this is a good or a bad thing. The roasted (almost burnt) malts are much stronger upon tasting, where the beer takes on a very bittersweet character. Some buttery notes again. Dark cacao and a slight metallic taste lead to a dry finish. High carbonation makes it interesting on the palate initially; leaves an oily coating all over. A pretty decent porter overall."
"Poured clear, dark brown with a bubbly 2 finger tan head. Nutty, chocolate aroma with lots of powdered cocoa. Equally strong molasses and toffee scents. Full, malty taste. Again, a lot of milk chocolate, the maltiness gives the beer a ""Whoppers"" candy taste. Pleasant butterscotch, cereal grain, and roasted almonds accompany this. Kind of thin, but appropriate for the style. While one was very easy to drink and smooth, more than one could get too sweet for me. The beer had a tendency to build up in the mouth in terms of sugar sweetness."
"D/O: Another Sam Adams gem that likely gets lost among their higher-profile (read: higher production) offerings. A very respectable porter that offers a lot to the eye and nose, but falls short of it's ""robust"" labeling on the palate. It would be top-notch if it had a tad more body, IMO. This beer, along with Old Fezziwig, make the SA Holiday case a no-brainer every year. BBC has the capacity to make some really great beers...it's a shame they sell so many of the better ones 4-at-a-time in mixed cases."
"The mouthfeel is just right amount of carbonation and consistency for an American Porter. This is a very good porter, especially as a holiday after dinner drink."
"D - Respectable Porter with a slightly split personality... Part of this one wants to be a Milk Stout and the other part wants to be an American Porter... Enjoyable, but stuck in the grey area between the two styles..."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Malty up front, sweet but not overly rich. Tastes a bit like one of those chocolate-caramel candies. Faint acidity, medium-light in body. Great balance, an easy beer to session as it never overwhelms the palate. The finish is semi-dry and lightly oily, like a bite of dark chocolate."
"D - This is a good porter, but I've never had the urge to drink more than one. Not the best in the Holiday Pack, but I certainly don't let them go to waste. Given the choice, I'd rather drink a SA Honey Porter instead."
""
"D- a nice abv but it fills a person up quickly. this would be a good beer to have with a steak dinner. A sixer might last a good week. A smooth drink and very tasty though."
"Drinkability: It is a good hearty winter beer..an above average porter, that I could have maybe two in a session--I guess the holiday packs got it right"
"Drinkability: Pretty easy to enjoy this proter. I wouldn't say this is the best I have had, but for where it comes from, and the cost, I would say it is very drinkable."
"Upon first taste, the roasted flavor really dominates here. Burnt malt, little bit of hops for balance. Little thin in the middle, but as it warms it fills out a bit and the burnt flavor kind of goes away. Not a real coating beer in the mouth, but some good carbonation keeps it from feeling stagnant. A decent porter, nothing that I went crazy over, but a nice complement to the Old Fezziwig."
"The pour is an exceptional chocolate brown with a beauty of a head which lingers for a bit before settling to a solid ring. Smell is festive yet not contrived and the taste... Well... it has a nice balance of coco and coffee perfect for the holiday. Enjoy!"
"A nice ale overall. For me the mouthfeel of a porter can make or break it. Too thin and I'll dump it. Sam Adams holiday porter is two fingers above the dump point. That's a good thing because it makes the holiday 12 pack buyable. It pours a deep mahogany brown with a tinge of ruby. Aroma is of malty sweet, fruit bread, and cherry. When the first sip hits my tongue I get a quick hit of smoke that fades to a full bodied smooth and toasty malt bath for my tongue. A bready and fruity wash of cherries, blackberries, and currants. It finishes drier with enough hop bite to please the hop head in me."
"Overall: gulp, gulp, gone"
"D: This is an easily drinkable porter that has a wonderful appearance. The aroma, feel and taste are a bit lacking though. It was a bit of a let down. Ah well, can't win em all."
"Medium light in body. Smooth and creamy. Very easy to drink."
"D - Pretty drinkable for a porter do to its mildness. Overall I like it."
"This one pours out black with red hues and a tan head that fades after awhile. The smell is of roasted malt, some sweet notes, and a hint of chocolate. The taste starts mild and malty, the some sweet notes, finishing with a subtle roasted flavor. The aftertaste is the roasted malt, sticking around for quite awhile. The mouthfeel is not as heavy as I would have preferred, the carbonation was a bit much, but the flavors were well balanced and really are the driving force of this beer. This is an average drinker, nothing that stands out here, a few improvements could make this a top notch beer, but it far from bad. Worth checking out, the winter 12 pack has some great beers. Enjoy."
"mouthfeel is bitter and roasty with good depth, sweet and lingering, wish this was year round!"
"Drink: Overall I think this is pretty drinkable. Again average."
"Had this beer as part of a Sam's winter sampler. I have to say that Porter's are not one of my favorite beers. There are a bunch of good beers in this 12 pack. The Fezziweg ale and the Cranberry Lambic are top notch. This one really just lacks distinction. It's the same old porter. There is nothing tha stands out about this beer. It is enjoyable but ordinary. As I said there are other beers in this 12 pack that make it worth while, I just wish they would bundle some of those up seperately. If you like porters you'll probably enjoy this one as well."
"A highly carbonated brew that has great flavor but is tough to have more than one."
"(rated Nov 30, 2008)"
"D-Overall, I'd call this a very drinkable porter...not one of my favorites, but it certainly has a place in the holiday 12 pack."
"I like the ""holiday' style without a lot of the heavy spices that most like to use."
"D: For what it's worth, this is easy to drink."
"the beers definitely drinkable I'd rather just pull out an Ed Fitz though"
"D: Not too bad of a drink, not the best porter for sure but is in the top tier."
"Overall it's between this and the Cream Stout for my favorite in the sampler."
"M/D - It has a medium to heavy body with slight carbonation, I like that. Easy to drink and the dry roasted aftertaste makes it savory as well."
"Good stuff here."
"Use by: April."
"Taste is of roasted malt, burnt sugar, licorice, toasted grain, and a bit of slighty bitter hops, with molasses noticeable towards the finish. A very nice porter that I would buy year-round if available. I would like to see it on its own as a seasonal at the very least."
"Pours very dark brown with a quite nice head that settles to a thin swirl but but leaves some nice lacing. Smells lightly roasty, slightly vinous, amd with some light cocoa and fruit notes. The taste is similar, but the cocoa notes are stronger and more bitter and the roastiness is a bit more pronounced. Still some light notes of fruit and wine. The chocolate really lingers- this is quite nice. Smooth and a bit tannic in the mouth, this pleasant"
"Other comments: Better than Old Fezziwig, but not necessarily a great example of the porter style. Pretty good paired with chocolate."
"D- excellent. A very smooth drinking porter. Brew gets better as it warms."
"D - A decent tasting beer, but too sweet for me to drink more than one or two."
"Aroma is malt, not too much roastiness. Taste is different- a ton of roasted malt, very dry, coffee and chocolate. Super creamy palate. Thick lacing. Very enjoyable, my love for porters continues. This is another winner from the Boston Beer Company."
"Mouthfeel a bit thin, but perhaps my favorite of the holiday mixed pack someone got me."
"A nice Christmas beer for sure. Thanks Shawn for sharing!"
"D: I'm down. A nice mellow porter that's unobtrusive with a good all around flavor that won't get in the way of anything."
"The feel is creamy and milky. Thick motor oil on the palate. It's an uncommonly sweet porter. Very caramel/toffee-flavored. (For comparison, it's akin to Saranac Caramel Porter.)"
"D- This was a smooth porter, good drinking beer for the winter months. Sits well"
"D-Enjoyable, but not terribly memorable. I'll probably drink this one a couple more times over the rest of the holiday season, and will fully enjoy it, but I won't really miss it after the season is done. Pretty easy drinking, decent flavors, overall a pretty OK brew."
"The mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. This beer is very drinkable, but I think three 12 oz. would be enough."
"D: This is, predictably, a nice, if sub-stellar offering from SA. I'd certainly never refuse one of these and it's one of the highlights of the holiday sampler. I'd prefer it were a bit more aggressive, but it's very drinkable."
"Drinkability - Features strong flavors. Definitely a beer one can taste and ponder. One's probably enough for me, though."
"D- Very good for a hearty porter"
"The pour is a dark brown with hints of red. The nose is roasted malt, chocolate, roasted coffee and spices. The taste is full body velvety toasted malt and coffee with molasses and spices with hints of hops. The finish is long and pleasant. A very tasty holiday porter"
"Decent body with balanced carbonation. Overall, disappointing as porters are typically one of my favorite styles and I've been so impressed with most of BBC's winter offerings over the past two years."
"Until next year Holiday Porter...I hope you get better next year."
"This is not the porter I would want year round, but I suppose it is in fact labeled as such."
"This beer had a lot of potential, and it almost nailed it. But that one metallic note in the flavor just had me hung up. Still not a bad beer though, it just could have been so much more."
"D - an Imperial pint or two is enough to satisfy on a cold winter evening, i wouldn't suggest anymore."
"Pours about as dark as brown can get with eggnog colored fluffy head which fades to a few clumps and leaves thick lacing. Smell: roasted malt, chocolate and a touch of coffee, faintly buttery. A little understated. Taste: semi-astringent burnt, roasted flavors upfront, followed by a touch of chocolate and dry oats. Medium bodied with a dry, oaty finish. I wouldn't mind having this option year-round, but it's not at the top of the style."
"Purchased as part of the SA Winter Mix Pack. Best by April 2009 indicated on the bottle. Served in my SA Sensory Pint. Poured the color of cola with a half inch, fizzy, khaki-colored cap. Head dissipated quickly into a soapy skim with a thick, broken band around the shoulders of the glass. Mild nose consisted of chocolate malt and a mere suggestion of dark fruit. Taste was roasty chocolate up front with a light, toffee sweetness towards the back and a kiss of hops at the finish. Consistency fell between light- and medium-bodied. Carbonation was a little bolder than I would have preferred. Fairly easy drinking and flavorful porter; however, carbonation affected the overall experience for me."
"D: Not bad."
"D - A decent enough porter. Perhaps a little forgettable but overall a solid, drinkable beer."
"D- The brutal honest truth is that this was a terrible porter. I am truly glad that I got this bottle for free. Will never drink again."
"Drinkability is good but I would probabaly prefer a standard porter for a session. The spice can get a bit old."
"The beer pours a dark dark brown--essentially black--with ruby highlights. A sticky tan head floats above that left some nice lacing on the glass. A roasted malt nose with mostly chocolate, some coffee, and a little earthy spice. Medium bodied brew with a nice round smooth feel. Chocolate, cocoa, coffee, and some deep dark fruit in the flavor profile. A burnt bitterness leaves the palate slightly dry at the end. A very faint of hint of cinnamon appears at the finish. This is a solid seasonal from the folks at Samuel Adams."
"Nice brew with some flavor. A highlight of the pack for sure."
"Picked this up as part of the winter variety pack. This beer pours with a decent head that quickly subsides. Fairly light for a porter too. Fairly nosy beer, all the usual dark coffee/chocolate malts, perhaps a little bit of licorice too? Taste is surprisingly metallic, but the good mouthfeel makes up for it somewhat. Not terribly coffee-esque for a porter, an interesting take on the style."
"D: Another nice SA beer. I'm happy that there is one of these still left in my box."
"Overall, I'm impressed....one of the better ones from Sam Adams"
"Drinkability: Despite the high carbonation, it is definitely something I could drink a couple of at once. Like most Sam Adams', a quality beer."
"A very nice, drinkable beer, one of the best from Sam Adams. Loved it!"
"It had been a while since I had this one and I forgot just how good it was. Nice and robust smokey roasted flavors make this one a very drinkable and enjoyable porter."
"D - this did not come across as being as bold in flavor as some of my more favorite porters--very good porter none-the-less. Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Not as good as the Fezziwig but a good part of this sample back. Not being a porter junkie, found fun in this bottle."
"M: Very smooth on the tongue."
"From the Sam Adams Holiday Classics box, this poured from a 12 oz bottle a garnet color with small off-white head and light lacing. Nose of light roasted malts and some chocolate. Medium mouthfeel. Flavor is again of burnt malts with some bitterness. Slightly bitter finish. OK, but not great."
"Enjoyed this brew with Thanksgiving dessert and again this evening as I surf the web. This porter pours a deep dark ruby liquid with a scant head that diminishes quickly. A fair amount of lacing adorns my glass. Smell is a smoky tobacco and malt affair. Pleasing. Taste shows off a bitter chocolate aspect, with coffee and dark fruits around as well. Mouthfeel is dry and astringent from an unseen hop front. A very drinkable brew that surely should make it's way to 6-pack availability."
"This ale from Samuel Adams comes in their holiday variety pack. I love the artwork on the cover of a guy carrying a fresh barrel of porter in to a pub on a snowy evening. I poured this in to a Duvel glass. It came out a dark brown color, a shade or two away from black, and had a finger worth of white heading. Smell is very lovely in subtle ways. Dry dark grains, milk chocolate, coal, a hint of dark berries. Flavor is much of the same, but not to the degree that the aroma showed. Bottle says it is a full bodied brew; and I would have to agree to an extent. It felt more medium sized than large for me, but lingering in that territory. Drinking this gets easier with each sip, as it does unfold a lot as it warms. I went in to this beer not expecting for it to deliver as much as it did. Perfect for the holiday season. Now I only wish they would put this and the Old Fezziwig in six packs. This one gets a thumbs up from me."
"I had several of these alst night during the Thanksgiving festivities and was disappointed when they were gone."
"D: Not my favorite porter but worth trying."
"Drinkability - I could see myself drinking a few of these in one sitting, which may be tough since you can only get two at a time in the Sam Adams Winter Classics sampler pack. Along with the cream stout, this is my favorite brew in the sampler."
"overall a nice beer to start my thanksgiving, while watching the lions get stomped."
"This beer is my favorite from Sam Adams winter variety pack."
"A nice porter, not outstanding, but a good representation of the style."
"Smell is roasted and slight hoppy. A little bit of a tobacco flavor as well. Some slight dark fruit in the aftertaste. Decent beer, not offensive and very easy drinking."
"Poured a very dark opaque brown with 1"" tan head which reduced to a light covering with good lacing. Strong aroma of roasted malt with tones of chocolate and toffee and a hint of spice. The flavor strongly reflects the aroma with a more pronounced spice flavor. I enjoyed this brew very much. A great addition to Sam Adams lineup."
"Dark brown, almost black color with a two finger tan head and nice lacing. Aroma of bitter roasted malts, some green hops, and light notes of chocolate and coffee. Taste is right on with the nose. Roasty toasty goodness, some chocolate, light coffee, and some herbal green hops in the background. Creamy, smooth and yummy. Very nice."
"The best of the winter taster pack I bought the other day and split with a friend. Pours an almost black color with some light brown highlights. Tan head with great retention and lacing. Nose is excellent as well. Huge caramel, nice roasted malt, dried fruit. Maybe a touch of chocolate. Flavor is similar: strong on roasted malt, chocolate, and a touch of spice. A touch of coffee. Feel is smooth and creamy, with a nice thick body. Overall, this is a great winter beer. I agree with others that used the word ""cozy."" I'd drink this one on any chilly winter night (or, screw it, morning)."
"SAHP has decent mouthfeel with a high drinkability due to it's pronounced yet unabrassive flavors. A winter favorite."
"D: Very highly drinkable and I wish they made this one year round. Alas, they have the Cream Stout year round."
"pours a very dark black color, with a slight caramel color to it, has a big frothy head on it, looks really nice. smell is of rich malted barley, has a nice smoke flavor to it. taste and mouthfeel is good too, a full flavored creaminess to it, sam adams makes some good brews, this is no exception. drinkability is good, its not too strong, recommended"
"M + D: Smooth feel, a kinda 'soft' body, with a nice little shimmer of carbonation. Drinks well, straight forward and pleasant. Not too shabby at all."
"D: There is a lot of hop and malt flavor in this beer. Something I am looking forward to more of."
"Not a bad brew from one of the best mixed 12 packs out there. Extra style points for really hitting that traditional blended porter taste."
"pours a black color with a thick tan head that stays with the beer all the way down. Good carbonation, even better lacing throughout. Aroma is roasted malts and chocolate. Taste is some caramel/malt and chocolate. Very good mouthfeel, does not feel heavy, nice and crisp. No strong or heavy aftertaste."
"Drinkability: Not bad. Tastes fine, nice body, etc so this category is okay."
"A wonderfully pleasing, calming, warming, and highly drinkable porter. A great addition for the holidays."
"D: Molasses almost always kills the drinkability desire for me and that's certainly the case here. Couple that with the metallic taste I get, the pedestrian aroma, and too much carbonation and I think I'll pass. I'll try this again to make sure it wasn't just the bottle I got, but I'll make sure I don't pay for it."
"SA's Holiday Porter is a surprisingly fine beer that really stands out amongst the stalwarts in the Boston Beer Company stable. Fullish-medium in body, the drink is mildly carbonated and extremely drinkable."
"Drinkability: Right on style for a porter. I can see myself enjoying many of these throughout the holiday season."
"Medium bodied with nice soft carbonation."
"Fairly big body, rich and creamy and mild carbonation. A pretty good porter from where I'm sitting."
" Drinkability: Well...I'll finish the 2 in my Holday pack but I think that is going to be it for me."
"Still a quality beer worth trying if you like Porter and stout."
"D= great for the holidays!"
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. It pours nice and dark with a few tinges of red, decent head. The smell is of dried figs and berries. The taste is very enjoyable. There are hints of chocolate and ripe fruits. The porter is medium bodied, smooth and drinkable. This and Old Fezziwig make it worthwhile every year to but the variety pack."
" Thin mouthfeel, but somehow it works here. To be honest this is not the best Porter I have ever had but it darn sure went down good,and hit the spot.. Good on Ya Sam ."
"Poured myself a couple of these after returning from driving the family around looking at Christmas Lights. Wasn't thrilled at first but this porter quickly grew on me. Roasted, chocolate malt nose with a noticeable hop scent, also some buttery sweets. Gorgeous pour I was and still am very impressed. Near black darkness with a 2"" tan head that calms to about one fourth of that and lacing, man tons of lacing all around and down the glass. Mouthfeel is creamy with a medium body, very drinkable. Sweet chocolate taste gives way to a roasted nuttiness. Bitter english hops tickle the tongue at the end. Great addition to their winter sampler."
"Drinkability: Why Samuel Adams's doesn't bottle this or the Ol' Fezzewig Ale in 6 or 12's is beyond me, these 2 beers are monumental to Samuel Adam's entry as being a solid winter performer, don't get me wrong, I love the Winter Lager, but these 2 beer's deserve more recognition then just placing 2 of each in a winter pack. I think we all need to e-mail Jim Koch and let him know how we feel."
"Overall? Pretty good! A good beer for the winter season. Nice and warming, however, I could have desired a little more creaminess."
"Drinkability: I believe this is a highly drinkable beer especially during the holiday season; this would be a good beer to drink on Christmas Eve. Nick thinks otherwise. Flavor is odd and mouthfeel isn't enjoyable either. J: 4.5; N: 2.5"
"Drinkability - Overall not too bad at all, but nothing ends up grabbing you and saying ""I want more!"" Even still, its a welcome addition to the Holiday pack."
"D- Its pretty drinkable. I think this would make a solid session beer."
"D: I think this is one of the better offerings from BBC... it's just a shame its a winter-only offering and only in the mixed packs."
"Drinkability: Overall a good beer. I could see this going very well with desserts, or maybe even being a dessert in itself. Personally, I had it with a Hersey's bar and it went very well with the beer. This is a beer perfect for the season."
"Having said all of that it's a great session porter with a nice label."
"3.4/5"
"D- A great winter brew. Slightly high on the abv for a session beer. Though it would be a great beer to warm you up on a cold night."
"Overall this is a good porter, not great, but definitely good. Worth a shot."
"MF&D - Very enjoyable. I only wish it was more readily available."
"D: This is one hell of a porter and I could easily see myself tipping back a few more of these. Great winter beer. Very nice."
"I really enjoyed this porter. It was very dark, with a decent head. Had faint smells of semi sweet chocolate and coffee grinds. The smell isn't nearly as bold as the flavor, which has a strong taste of coffee and a little bit of chocolate. It's not nearly as bitter as most porters, making it pretty drinkable (for a porter). Definitely give this one a shot."
"Poured into a nonic. Reddish dark umber color with a big fluffy tan head. Great lacing. Aromas of coffee with cream and sugar, as well as some chocolate notes. Semisweet chocolate up front, ashy roasted coffee finish. Nice lingering bitterness. Dry and smooth, light bodied. Easy to drink. Decent porter."
"D: It was not that bad once you get past the initial taste."
"Future outlook: A solid addition to the Samuel Adams Winter Classics Mix Pack, which I will surely pick up again next season."
"Very, very dark mahogany color with a slight tan head. Rather plain aroma-somewhat metallic and iron like. Decent malty flavor-a mild hint of roastedness and some decent chocolate notes. Mild lingering bitterness. Almost a slight, lingering vanilla flavor. Solid mouthfeel-rather creamy. A nice porter and a decent effort."
"I will enjoy this winter with these Sam Adams selections for sure. Exceptional beer available at you local Grocery Store all Winter. Get this variety pack!"
"The nose on the beer is a nice mixture of sweetness, which is caramelly, and roastiness. The beer looks great with a good 1"" head, and pretty black. The beer has a weird taste for a porter, It's really balanced, and the flavours mix together. There is a sweetness and a roastiness but they almost tasted mixed. The porter isn't good nor bad, because it just leaves me with a meh feeling in my mouth. The bitterness is good though. The mouthfeel is greamy and solid, and the beer is okay for drinkablility."
"Ah, a nice solid porter from Sam Adams. This one is perfect on a nice cold night with a blanket on you relaxing on the ole couch. Full of nutmeg type spices and a nice hearty taste, its smooth, well balanced and goes down easy. One of my favorite porters to have in the winter."
"D: Good drinkability, a decent light session style porter that should satisfy for a couple of drinks."
"Even with full, thick body, very smooth and creamy as floats over tongue. Leaves behind a mild burnt flavor for dry aftertaste along with coffee and cocoa malts. This was great to have and killed second bottle right after. Everyone should try."
"Black color topped with a thick tan head. Roasted with chocolate, coffee and some malt flavor. A little bitternerss that seems to linger a bit. I typically don't like this style and this one was at least drinkable. I can definitley see this one being more appealing when it's cold out as it is warming."
"A fine Sam Adams brew. I'll definitely be looking for this next year."
"The taste is smooth, roasted dark chocolate, slight bitterness for balance. Spicy, earthy, bittereness in the finish rounded out by the sweet caramel cookie mouthfeel. Solid offering, good enough to be brewed year round."
"Overall, it is a shame this porter is not available all-year around as a stand-alone product. Sam Adams hit a grand slam on this one, and yet only sells it in limited ways."
"This is a near black color with a tan head. The nose has lots of roasted malts with some chocolate and nuts. The flavor profile is fairly basic with toasted malts and some English hops. A light to medium body is well carbonated. A good drinker and better than their honey porter."
"Rich, semi-full mouthfeel, along with it's great flavor make this easy drinking porter top-notch for it's style."
"This porter is excellent. It's not very dark, more like an average coffee than a nice dark porter stout, although it does have wonderful head and lacing. It has a fantastic aroma and taste, though! Excellent scents/flavors of chocolate and roasted barley, but the best part is how it smells and tastes almost like a smoked porter. Goes down well and would make a great base for boiling brats. Very much worth a try!"
"Pours dark, almost black, with a short tan head. Thin lace, good carbonation throughout. When held to the light there is a thin ring of ruby red at edge of the glass. Pleasant smell of malt and nuts, some faint coffee and cocoa. There is a slight flavor of roasted malt, coffee, but nothing too strong. Smooth, almost light, no heavy creaminess. Easy to drink and enjoyable."
" The finish was smooth with some grains and coffee-chocolate in the aftertaste. Good carbonation and an even balance of spice and bitterness to cap it off. The beer was not bitter,actually sort of bitter-sweet. This was good for the holidays and I enjoyed this beer to the very end as it was not too heavy or too light."
"Hrmm, a decent beer, but the acidity really doesn't belong here. If that was gone, it would be much more drinkable."
"Quite easy to drink and goes down smooth but as you usually only get two per winter mixed pack, it's easy to finish them off - they aren't deadwood but rather, a beer you can enjoy once a year, which I think is their intention."
"Pours almost black with some opaqueness. Short lived light tan head. Smell is diacetyl and buttery up front with no real roastiness being picked up at all. Taste is different however, and is bittersweet roasty malt. Some diacetyl in flavor too. Somewhat buttery again. Nice bitterness to it, and drinks pretty easily despite the buttery flavor. Slightly rich bodied and bubbly mouthfeel too. Decent."
"D: Drinks more like an ale then its style of a porter. Has the taste of a porter without the body."
"Drinkability - this is a good ale. It would be somewhat sessionable."
"A great porter - English-style with an American flair. It has a good amount of complexity. A great balance with a nice use of hops that are supportive enough to showcase the malt complexities. I could enjoy several of these, and year-round, to boot!"
"I could say I wouldn't buy this again, but the Sam Adams winter mix pack does have some nice beers in it. We'll see, but I can tell you that Holiday Porter isn't the pick of the case."
"D - Solid, highly drinkable porter with robust flavor and nice hop presence. Body is a little thin, but the aromas and flavors are quite pleasant."
"Tasted on 1/17/08"
"D: A pretty drinkable beer overall. Nice, malty taste with some roasted undertones. The nice malts reminded me a little bit of a bock, but overall it was a fairly easy beer to drink."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: As the label describes it a ""hearty porter," I'd have to agree, it is a full bodied brew with just the right amount of carbonation to bring out certain flavors without getting in the way of others. However, there is a hint of a watery character near the finish of this brew, like the body is slowly thinning out after the first few seconds in my mouth. I wouldn't be opposed to drinking this one again, however, I know there are better American porters out there that hit the spot much better on a cold winter's day."
"A good example of a porter. Pleasant to drink. Makes the winter sampler a little more fun to buy. Not my favorite example, but good to drink I would get more."
"Dark chocolate color with a creamy mid-sized head that leaves nice lacing. The aroma is sweet of chocolate malts and burnt caramel. Hints of roasted malts come through, along with earthy-woody hops. Very well-balanced and pleasant smell. Medium bodied and buttery smooth with a creamy carbonation. Slightly sweet of roasted chocolate and caramel malts. Lightly roasted coffee and bitter chocolate come through with mild woody hops into modestly dry finish. This is a very good porter, and probably my favorite Sam Adams offering yet. Very drinkable, very tasty, and the mouthfeel couldn't be better for the style."
"this is a solid porter that if you can grab it is worth imbibing"
"D- I would have to be carfull drinking a lot of these. The alcohol content was evident and gave you a good buzz in a hurry. It wasnt as heavy as some other dark beers or Porters Ive had."
"Aroma was somewhat weak. What I could smell was mainly malts (toasted grains and chocolate) with some brown sugar. Color was a dark mahogany with a matching light brown head. Flavor was a typical porter with a bitter and sour finish. Mouthfeel was dry with a light alcohol backnote."
"Overall a good beer."
"A good beer, not the best porter, but a great attempt from a big brewery."
"Had this one in the winter sample pack. Appearance was excellent. The drink had a light brown head which thinned out nicely. Overall, pretty dark to see through, very little amber colors on the bottom I noticed. The smell was full of flavors such as chocolate, malts, nuts and caramel. The taste is pretty good with a crisp, light malty taste. Definitely a solid, frappe-like body, making it great for those cold days. Overall, Sam does it again."
"A great winter beer, perfect for enjoying the indoor heat while it's -100 degrees outside."
"this is a good cold weather beer and i fully enjoy it"
"Drinkability: I found this Sam Adams to be a run of the mill Porter. It was nothing out of the ordinary or even that good. I doubt I'll buy this one again next Christams season."
"The taste is roasted malt with a good sweetness kick, bit of coffee flavoring and a slight bitterness rounds it out at the end. Pretty smooth with good carbonation, not overly syrupy or thick though."
"D - Overall a decent porter to wind down with on a chilly afternoon. Very enjoyable and easy to drink."
"Light to medium body,not filling with a slight grainy bite. Easy drinking and not too filing with enough taste makes it an almost sessionable dark beer."
"This was tried form the sam adams winter pack. It is a very refreshing beer and very warm beer. I love having it with a big heavy meal that will put me to sleep especially during the winter months. It pours a very dark brown almost black color with a tan head. There ios some malt on the nose but nothing more some sweetness form it as well. Taste of roasted malt with not a lot of hop flavor inside. Nice smooth sweetness that finishes strong and leaves you wanting more."
"D: For a spiced porter fairly drinkable. Could do two of these in an evening no problem."
"Good abv, and the finish is nice and light, a little sweeter than the overall flavor. Mouthfeel is a little light correspondingly, but the drinkability is solid. Very nice porter."
"Big body on this one with hints of toffee, molasses, and rich malts shine through this porter. Nice bitterness to this American Porter. There is a complex malt character and chocolate malts really make this beer. This beer is almost chewy and it leaves a burnt roasted taste in my mouth. Finishes with a sweetness of burnt molasses. A nice beer."
"All in all this is a very nice porter ... just nice."
"Initially a bit sweet but there's a nice bitterness at the end. Another qualitybrew from SA. A nice sipper during the cold season."
"A great beer to enjoy on a cold winters night."
"Excellent drinkability. It really sweetens as it warms making it even more enjoyable."
"I really enjoyed this beer. Boston Beer has been putting out some great products and this is another one. It is possibly my favorite from the winter 12 pack. Well done."
"Pours a black color with plenty of creamy light brown head. Smell is of a dark roasted malt aroma and light hops. Taste is smokey with some touch of bitter hops. Mouth feel is a little watery but very nice."
"This beer is very drinkable. It's not as heavy as you would think from the dark appearance. I highly recommend it."
"D = This is a pleasant drinkable beer. The faults I noted would not stop me from having a second of these immediately or from having more in the future. A nice Winter porter."
"D-Its definently a heavy brew but I think I could down half a six pack in short order! (fo sho)"
"Nice pour out of the bottle with a nice dark color with some amber highlights you can just barely see through. The smell I dont think is too much differnt than any other porter so I gave that an average. The taste is great though, not as strong as others and goes down very nicely. Mouthfeel is just what I like in a porter. taste of chocolate with a bit of bitter sweetness. A nice beer for christmas!"
"D - I enjoyed this beer quite a bit yet again too bad they only put two in the mix pack"
"Smooth in texture and moderate/full bodied. Also moderately carbonated with a slick, somewhat juicy finish. A bit of light warmth can be detected as well. Solid throughout; a nice festive brew."
"The mouthfeel is good, but not exceptional because it ends dry. It heads towards bitter but is so slight I'd expect many to miss it. Considering the high alcohol content, subtle notes could be overlooked by the beer's thickness."
"Of the beers in the holiday variety pack, I preferred the Old Fezziwig, Cream Stout, and even the Cranberry Lambic over this. It's not bad at all, just a little off-center to this tongue."
"carbonated well. full bodied. some lace. great porter. unfortunatey can only get when it is cold outside. could do a session. will drink again."
"I look forward to next year's batch."
"A very enjoyable beer with lots of taste. Although this is nothing that will blow you away."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Sam Adams Pint glass. Poured an opaque black with a huge head. Probably 3 inches that took quite a while to dissipate. Definitely a hard pour. Left lacing down the glass. Aroma is of roasted malts, vanilla and toffee. Taste is much the same except with a bit of overly roasted coffee beans at the finish. Mouthfeel is more full then I expected. Has a sweet yet dry finish. Probably the second best offering out of the holiday pack."
"Pours a very dark brown- nearly black with medium tan head. Mild roated malty aroma. Nice malty flavor. Roasted and chocolate. Light herbal hops in the finish provide some balance. A slight toasted malt aftertaste. Pleasant. Medium bodied and moderately carbonated. A very drinkable porter."
"Another solid beer out of the SamÂ’s holiday six pack. CanÂ’t say IÂ’m surprised about any of their beers, as they were all pretty solid."
"Smell was lightly roasted malts, some chocolate. Not picking up on the vanilla that some others have mentioned, but my nose is a bit stuffed up. Taste is fairly blah, not a lot of roasted bitterness and a bit sweet for my taste. Mouthfeel is much too thin, almost watery which does not suit the style. What bitterness is there is a bit harsh because of the thin body. Carbonation is medium low and pretty much right on. Overall a decent beer, but not one to seek out. Better to just stick with Dead Reckoning or Anchor Porter."
"D: I won't seek this beer out, but I also won't hesitate to drink it again."
"This poured a very dark brown with a big rocky off-white head. The head slowly dwindled down over a few minutes and left very good lacing. The smell was lightly roasty and had plenty of chocolate. The taste was very sweet, caramel and chocolate mostly. There was not much roasted bitterness to it, overall it was a sweet porter. The mouthfeel was slightly thinner than I would have liked, but not much of a problem. A very tasty porter I would buy if it were available by itself."
"D: Will defiantly be looking on enjoying the other Holiday Porter!"
"Mouthfeel is a solid medium body and is very creamy. Soft on the palate with an appropriately light carbonation. This is a really solid porter that I would have again for sure. One of the highlights of the winter classics case for me."
"Poured into a pint glass, This beer poured a dark brown with a 3 finger tan head, that left a good amount of laceing down the side of the glass. The smell is of coffee with a hint of spice coming through. The taste is the same, with a slight chocolate after taste. The mouthfeel is very light and this beer is very drinkable."
"Drinkability: A nice, solid porter. Something about the finish was a bit off and decreased my enjoyment, but it's still fairly drinkable."
"This beer poured a very dark brown with reddish highlights and a big fluffy three-finger tan head that didn't last for long. The smell is very indicative of a porter, with some coffee and chocolate hints. The taste starts off with a a bit of sweet chocolate followed by some coffee and a some hops that linger on the palate. The mouthfeel is a little more watery than I expected from the pour, but it is still pleasant. This isn't as heavy as some porters, and I'd consider it to be more drinkable than most because of it. This isn't a bad little porter, it doesn't do much to stand out but I'd hardly turn it down if it was offered to me again."
"All in all a fantastic porter IMHO. Not much roastiness or over-the-top chocolate, but very balanced and refined in its own quiet way. I really could session with this ale all night long. A great porter from a BIG craft brewer. This would make a great gateway beer for newbies and also satisfies someone whose enjoyed quite an array of dark beers from all corners."
"Already looking forward to next year's Holiday Mix so I can grab another one."
"Drinkability- I would have to put the drinkability of this very highly. So far the vintage aging of the Sam Adams Winter beers have been a home run. I didn't sit back any of the cranberry lambic for obvious reasons, but I would love to have 6 packs of both old fezziwig and the holiday porter. Please?"
"Crisp and smooth, fairly light in body. Lighter than expected, but a nice switch from heavy stouts and porters without giving up the roasted character. Easy to drink - this should be in 6-packs, at least seasonally."
"Got this as part of a Sam Adams winter brew sample case. I poured this beer into a tasting glass. This is a nice looking brew, dark thick, nice head which dissipate quickly, but still leaves a nice creamy lace. The nose has sweet, think cinnamon, chocolate, sugar, spice, especially once warms up a little bit of hops in the background. Agitate this beer a little and the head re-appears, nice and thick. This is a medium to full bodied creamy beer, with stout like characteristics. Not quite a session a beer, but one is great."
"Poured from bottle into chalice. Pours deep, dark, brown with some ruby highlight when held to the light. Nice off-white head with good retention and lacing. Smell was somewhat suprising as there were more hops present than I expected, not overwhelming but present. Also some chocolate and caramel notes. Taste is a good blend of malt and some hops, although the hops arent as noticeable in the taste. Strong tastes of toasted grain with some coffee and chocolate in the back. Leaves a somewhat dry, oily feeling behind and I'd say has a medium to almost medium-heavy mouthfeel. Best when drunk at warmer temperature (brings out the chocolate and caramel tastes more). Overall a solid 4 for me, I have to say I really enjoyed this and I think might be my highest rated Sam Adams yet. A good beer that could easily stand on its own."
"D - This is an okay brew. I had hoped it would be better."
"This beer isn't bad, but it doesn't stand out in any way to me. The color is good, but the taste is a bit carbonated and weak for a porter. Not as rich as I like, but not too pungent either. I wouldn't buy a six pack, but as a part of the holiday twelve-pack its ok. I prefer the cream stout. Not Sam's best."
"D- It is a pretty decent porter. I will have my other one but wouldn't seek this one out again."
"Pitch black complexion with fine carbonation, usual suspects of coffee and chocolate hit the nostrils and come around again in the taste. Good job of hiding the alcohol and a very smooth finish. A nice dark sessioner for those cold days. One of my favorite BBC beers, a superb porter, though I admit that many of this style seem to run together a little."
"Mmmm. Sam Adams comes through with a winner of a Porter here. Robust flavor, a good body, and low ABV make this one highly quaffable wintertime brew."
"Same as the stout, a pure black liquid with a two inch tan head that fades too quickly but at least leaves a bit more lacing than the stout. This one has a bit more of a malt and chocolate presence with hints of brown sugar. Pretty good hop character here but again as the malts try to catch up but remain unbalanced, I'd stick with the stout if I had a choice"
"D- from the decorative label to the 6 lbs of malt per bottle to the great taste to the moderate abv, this is a contender."
"Overall a nice beer that I wouldn't mind getting a sixer of."
"The taste was of roasted malts, sort of bitter and loads of coffee, with a hint of caramel. A nice balance of all components in one bottle. A very pleasant surprise from Boston Brewing Co. What a holiday treat."
"Pitch black body with a brown half-inch head that leaves a nice, balanced lace on the tumbler...toffee, caramel--less toasted than the stout, but still noticeable...aggressive early, thinning to the throat with a bit of fiz...creamy/oily in places...sweet and balanced--full-bodied but not arrogant--brings a little bite...not sure where the ""holiday"" part comes in, but this is a pleasant approximation of the two I love best (Samuel Smith and Yuengling)..."
"Good looking beer. Coffee black with a foamy tan head. I smell what seems to be burnt carmel, dark chocolate, and coffee. The flavor is similar to the aroma but there's a slightly unpleasant bitter aftertaste. It feels like my tounge has been painted with a coat of coffee-flaovred paint... but in a good way. It feels heavy and creamy and chewy like a good porter should. A good beer drink one of before you go to bed."
"Great for the season."
"I had high hopes for this beer after reading about the medal it picked up in the Uk recently. I was not at all disappointed. WOOHOO!!"
"I like the boston beer company for what they do for craft beer, sometimes they really pull through, their seasonal beers are some of my favourite sessions easily available at typical college bars. However if i had a choice betweent his and Sierra Nevada porter it wouldn't even be close. I would definately try it again because I feel like i got a bad bottle"
"Overall- A decent representation of the style. It didn't push any boundries, but would be a great one for anybody that wants to give porters a shot to try. It's one of my favorites from the Winter mixpack."
"D- Although this beer does have some depth it doesn't really have the nice roasted qualities I like in a porter. The chocolate malt doesn't have that nice freshness to it either."
"D - Nothing really outstanding here. Just filler in the holiday mixpack."
"D: A really nice offering without the over-the-top acrid, bitter qualities that sometimes turn me off to porters."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Drinkability is a bit low due to the diacetyl all over the place. Okay, but not Sam's best."
"This being my first porter IÂ’m looking forward to trying more. I would love to brew my own or get as close as possible."
"Drinkability: Quite high. I am usually disappointed by many of the Porters that I try, but this one is surprisingly good. Not big on the ABV, so you can do several if you like. Nice beer for a cold evening."
"D. Great powerful Hops makes for a brew that I would love with a Steak or Roast."
"Pours out a deep ruby brown with a small beige head which leaves creamy, thick lacing on the glass. Smell is a mix of coffee, molasses and anise, along with earthy and floral hops. Anise comes out a bit much aside from the other flavors, however, there is a significant hop presence giving some nice English hop flavors. Finishes a bit dry ans with a roasty lingering effect. Mouthfeel is solid in weight, but a little spritzy for my taste. Overall, this is a solid porter."
"D - Good beer to kick back and enjoy."
"Obtained this brew as part of the ""Winter Classics"" collection. Pours a deep brown color, with 1 1/2 finger thick tan head, that settles. Smell is slightly toasted malt, some very faint grape style sweetness. Very subdued aroma. Flavor has many woodsy notes, very faint coffee. Can also definetly taste the european hops used. Mouthfeel is very coating and smooth. some slight astringency, along with a slightly moist finish. Fairly solid beer. Im glad I have a few more of these."
"Different, interesting, but did not really go well for me."
"Great taste on this porter: roasted & coffee malts, burnt chocolate, caramel, plum, fig, and a bit of spice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated with a lingering, bitter chocolate finish. Drinkability is good. While this isn't the best porter I've ever tasted, it's definately a complex and tasty one. I'll be having it again next year for sure."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Some porters are just too sweet to session, even if I really like the taste. This one is well balanced, and light enough I could probably really throw some of these back."
"Drinkability: Tasty porter. The malt flavors provide an interesting challenge to the drinker."
"pours not quite black in color with a one inch tan head that fades to just cover the beer and a fair amount of lace. slightly burnt roasted malt, coffee, dark toffee in the nose. taste same as nose carrying from the beginning through to the finish with that slightly burnt taste. mouthfeel light, smooth, carbonation ok. drinkability is very good wish i had more."
"This is really good. If you're sharing this pack with friends, give them the Boston Lager (one of my favorites, but you can get it anytime) and save this one for yourself."
"This is a fine porter, one of the most consistent styles."
"I could have used a fireplace and consumed this a little later in the evening to see if that enhanced the experience. I would classify this as a middle of the road porter that is well worth the effort."
"Medium bodied and finishes slightly dry. The fruitiness and coffee really linger with this one. A very nice beer from SA. I assume this is available only in the holiday mixer around this time of year. A solid offering."
"Drinkability: A very good porter although I would prefer a little less hops bitterness."
"A great addition to this mix pack and the SA fleet of award winning beers. I prefer this to the Honey Porter, because of it's burnt chocolate taste and aroma that goes better with a roaring fire."
"D: The beer is extremely drinkable."
"Drinkability: Good stuff! Unless the Old Fezziwig really wins me over I'd have to consider this to be my favorite of the Samuel Adams Winter Mix-Pack."
"Each pint is a meal, and coffee is the main ingredient. I'll pass."
"The brew had a noticable buttery taste, didn't really work well with the porter."
"Drinkability: Very nice. This beer is tasty and smoothe. It goes down easy and doesn't ask for your number when you want to be left alone. Where are all the holiday spices? One can only imagine where they ran off to. Probably a better holiday porter at the North Pole. Drink this one."
"Drinkability - Sam Adams Holiday Porter seems like it would be really interesting in flavor, the smell is pretty great. It's smooth, rich and full flavored. It's a shame, I have to admit the off flavor I keep picking up is ruining it for me and getting through a single bottle is a challenge..."
"The mouthfeel is medium with a high level of carbonation on the tounge. This is a very good example of a robust, English porter."
"D - Overall a decent beer to have as part of the holiday sampler pack but I don't think i wold seek it out actively. Would go well with a holiday meal of ham and sweet potatoes. A decent offering from SA"
"This brew has some meat on its bones, making it a good choice in the cold winter months. Oh, now I see why it's called a Holiday porter. And yes, it's worthy of that moniker."
"Had this at the Falcons football game. Poured into a plastic cup (only drawback). A very dark black with red highlights and a nice head that fell with little to no lace (I think it's the cup). Had a good roasted smell with coffee and chocolate. The taste is much the same with a nice thick mouthfeel and some decent carbonation. Overall drinkability is high for me because it was right in my wheelhouse as a porter and it offered a very traditional porter taste"
"The taste lacks the depth also. Not very complex or deep. Rather bland if you ask me. Just malt, the customary chocolate and coffee flavors are rather weak. It coats the mouth with a creamy feel and finishes dry. Maybe I have been spoiled by being exposed to some really good dark beers makes me not appreciate this one."
"this was my third pick ; pours a deep burgandy-brown w/ a thin tan head which dissapates quickly, little lacing ; a caramel/toffee aroma w/ some citrusy hop notes, some faint estery yeast as well ; a rich, sweet, roasty caramel flavor, not as dry as most porters, has a nice malt profile, some spicy hop flavors as well ; a robust med. bodied brew, plenty of co2 to help keep the flavor around ; this is a very drinkable one, i like it better than their honey, in fact, this one of the best porters i've had, too bad it's seasonal..."
"Great hearty porter. The perfect beer for dessert or after dinner on a cold wintry night."
"d: Good balance to his one, might be my favorite from the SA Winter Classics 12-pack and when paired with a slice of pumpkin pie and MU Football, its sure making for a nice Saturday afternoon!"
"Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, semi sweet with nice balance of herbal hops and mild spice with charred sugars."
"D: Pretty drinkable, maybe a little too rich to be consumed in mass amounts, but definitely an excellent beer for a BBQ"
"This is one excellent porter. It poured a nice dark brown, almost black into the glass with a nice caramel colored head that was very thick and stuck to the sides of the glass. It smells of dark roasted malts and spices. The taste is really good with roasted malts dominating with some spices coming through in the aftertaste. Some nutty flavors come out in the aftertaste making it really nice for a holiday beer. It has a good sweet malty aftertaste and is overall an excellent beer. I wish they sold it outside of the holiday mix pack."
"The head is typically modest for Sam Adams products, but the beer leaves distinct foam lines around the glass to indicate its rich texture. The flavors are prominent but blend together very well. The roasted coffee, chocolate and caramel work nicely, and the creamy texture makes this a full-bodied yet easy-going porter to enjoy. Personally, among Sam Adams products, their porters I find to be exceptional, unfailingly excellent beverages, and Holiday Porter is no slouch. Porter fans will enjoy. This is a great beer to crack open after shoveling the driveway, or for resting with a book by the fire. First-rate."
"I would say that the alcohol showing through isn't quite what I desire in a porter. Even at 5.9%, there seems to be too much upfront that overshadows the roastiness."
"D: I remember liking the Old Fezziwig the best last year, and it still is great, but this year, the Holiday Porter takes the cake. I have been thoroughly impressed by this beer, truly fantastic. The holiday mix pack from Sam Adams is worth it just for this beer, probably the best American Porter I have ever had."
"I'll have to go out and get me a few 12's of this just in case the price goes up ($11.99 this week) and availablility goes down. I am sure they will keep. In fact, I wonder if they might age well."
"Not sure why I always do this, but I like to suggest a good place to enjoy a beer, and this is definitely a fireplace beer. Even better would be outside on a cold night around a fire."
"Excellent beer overall and definately worth a try. I got mine in the SA Holiday Sampler"
"Poured into my Sam Adams pint glass. There is a really decent head on this beer. About a 1/2 inch tall and retentive as well. I don't see many porters with rich heads. The beer is a couple shades darker than cola and there is mild carbonation. The nose is very much porter-like. Toasty, burnt, bitter hop aroma. The flavor profile is really nice. It's smooth and complex with good balance. It starts out rich and smooth with a touch of burnt grain, then the burnt flavor introduces the bitter hop taste. It finishes clean and doesn't leave you hanging. I enjoy the mouthfeel of this one. It is neither too thick nor too bold. It is very drinkable just for that reason: it's rich but not too rich, and it's strong but not unsessionably strong. 1 or 2 would be nice on a cold night."
"drinkability is good for a porter. the thinner body makes this one easier to finish. truth be told, this is a suprizing offer from Sam Adams. a little lacking on the body and boldness. nevertheless, this one is worth a try. cheers!"
"D - Excellent drinkability. Full of flavor, but light in body and easy to drink. This captures the season better than most of the other Sam Adams winter beers, too bad the holiday sampler only comes with two."
"My second favorite in the holiday pack, this porter is excellent. ItÂ’s not very dark, more like an average coffee than a nice dark porter stout, although it does have wonderful head and lacing. It has a fantastic aroma and taste, though! Excellent scents/flavors of chocolate and roasted barley, but the best part is how it smells and tastes almost like a smoked porter. Goes down well and would make a great digestif. Very much worth a try!"
"Beautiful pour on this one, with a terrific head and great lacing. Little smokey on the nose, but smell is a little lacking, which is not common for a Samuel Adam's brew. Dark chocolately, roasted malts with a nutty flavor as well. Some coffee also, maybe? Medium bodied with a little twingy hop flavor at the end. An overall nice offering by the Boston Beer Company."
" This is pretty rad winter brew."
"Overall: Despite the brevity of my notes, I enjoyed it. It's a well-crafted example of the style; I wouldn't mind seeing it year-round, actually."
"Brown head that doesnt last. Nice lacing around glass. Attractive dark color and nice aroma. Thinner than a lot of porters, but still very tasty. Though I appreciate the effort, Samuel Adams makes a lot of stuff that really isnt my style (Winter Lager, Cranberry Lambic, Cherry Wheat, etc.), but they really know how to craft dark beers. Besides this, Cream Stout, Black Lager, and Honey Porter are excellent beers"
"Pulled out of the back of my closet from a holiday pack purchased almost 6 months ago. The beer pours an almost opaque black with a thin head that slowly diminishes. The aroma is of chocolate and black malts. The taste is dominated by black malts and subtle hops with some dark chocolate and molasses present as well. The beer is somewhat carbonated and medium bodied. I will have to give it another try in the winter and see if I enjoy it more."
"D - overall, the taste wins out and makes for a good drinkable brew."
"Overall, this is a good session beer. I enjoyed it."
"with that sweetness."
"Pours a dark chocolate brown with a light brown healthy creamy head that sticks around. Smell of dark chocolate and caramel malts with dried fruits. Taste is more the same with smell with added coffee. A medium mouthfeel that has good body, but a bit on the hoppy side for me in a porter. None the less one the better ones from Sam Adams that I've had."
"Very drinkable, I could see drinking this as a session beer during the cold months of winter. A very solid offering."
"Drinkability: Very nicely balanced. Neither the sweetness or the bitterness ever dominates."
"Pours a dark brown color with a brown head and some nice lace. Toasty aroma, hints ofchocolate, hops, nuts, and toffee. I enojoy this beer ever winter it comes out. Available in Winter Pack. Might be able to find this on sale somewhere for a low price, or clear out."
"Pours a dark brown/black, nice carbonation, nice little head, leaves quickly, nice islands and some sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is of sweet roasted malts, chocolate, toffee, and caramel The taste is slightlysweet, malty, nice touch of chocolate/toffee, slight bitter finish. Medium body. Drinkable, nice little porter at that."
"D - Drinkability is where this one shines. This is just about the most drinkable porter that I've tried...it's a shame that you can only get two in a holiday 12-pack mixer. I would buy sixers of this for the holiday season for sure. Come on SA! Give us the good stuff!"
"D: Relatively drinkable. Definitely not the worse selection out of the SA Winter Sampler case."
"Very well-crafted beer. Recommended for fans of the style."
"Overall not a bad porter from Sam Adams, a good beer to be in the holiday pack. We definitely give it a try next year if they have it."
"Drank this from a 12 oz bottle that's best by May 2007. This is one of the last beers from my Sam Adams holiday pack. Pours a heavy black color with ruby edges. Very small head - okay retention. Smells of chocolate, chalk, sugar, molasses, and applesauce. Tastes mostly of the chocolate, with the heavy bitterness of a dark-roasted coffee. Low/medium mouthfeel - standard for a porter. An easily drinkable beer - makes me appreciate the style more."
"It's decent, but pedestrian. The flavor is a testament to playing it safe. It's reasonably drinkable, as it is middle of the road and harmless. Still, what does it say that my current favorite BBC beers are Longshot winners from homebrewers? But if Jim's happy, who I am to argue? I just won't have any more, is all."
"The mouthfeel is fitting and makes it a sessionable highly drinkable porter. Could be more roasty, but a good porter."
"Nothing like a nice porter. Smells of rich chocolate cake. Smooth chocolate flavor with a bit of spice and mild dry bitter finish. Maybe the smoothest porter I've ever had. Can't quite put my finger on the spice, it's fairly light, but its definately there. I always look forward to this beer in the Sam winter pack."
"Tastes like a pretty good porter, not sure what the holiday part is, but this pack had a couple not so Holiday [at least in my view] beers, but that is OK! Some light chocolate, light hops, some nuttiness. Not too bad for pretty cheap beer. Costco had cases for like 18 bucks!!"
"Drinkability: Purchased the mix 12 pack with two of these in it. A bit of a shame as I'd like to be able to purchase a 6 of this during the winter months as a winter seasonal-type offering. A very enjoyable beer."
"Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Comes out black with a lot of thick, brown head. Smells amazing - malt, spices, and alcohol, wow. Tastes more realistic. Thick but lacking in flavor. Got Some dark malt at the bottom, hops up top, but nothing in the middle. It's Nice and thick on the tongue, lasting finish. It's a tad thick to drink many."
"Drink-Ability: Another great one by Sam Adams"
"Beef Notes: Man I wish they made this one year round. Definitely one of the better porters I've had recently. Do not miss this beer if you can find it during the holiday season."
"I have to say that I enjoyed this brew quite a bit, in fact I think I'll have a couple more."
"A flavorful American Porter that tastes artificially sweetened at times. Not my favorite version of the style, but I wouldn't mind having another."
"Drinkability is quite good for this porter. It is definitely not a leader for the style but it is just a solid beer that is easy to enjoy."
"D - Tasty, but nothing special. I would chalk this up as yet another porter."
"D: I like this beer. Good flavor, well balanced with just the right amount of bitterness."
"This is a nice changeup from the hop bombs I have been drinking and what I have been craving in these winter months: a nice malty, smooth ale. My favorite out of the holiday pack. Bottoms up!"
"I've had this beer dozens of times thoughout the years. This is a nice well-rounded porter that always leaves me satisfied."
"Overall a very good porter. Certainly quaffable and recommended."
"This is the best beer in the holiday 12-pack. It's a nice smooth porter with hints of toasted malts and carmel. It's a nice rich, dark brown color with a light frothy head. Head retention is not great, but it's somewhat typical of other American porters I have tried. The after taste on your tongue and mouth is sweet and very slightly smokey. (Not as clear as a smoked porter, it's very subtle.) It's definitely a good beer to enjoy while wrapping Christmas presents in front of the fire. And unlike a barleywine, you can comfortable enjoy three or four of them."
"Eric"
"Samuel Adams Holiday Porter pours a dark brown with a tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There's chocolate and coffee in the aroma. The flavor also has chocolate and coffee notes, but there are strong hop flavors right in the middle. An Americanized porter that is pretty decent. Definitely worth a try."
"Comes in at a hefty 5.9% ABV, but alcohol is not overly noticable. Worth a try."
"Anchor,or Carnegie for a great version of a porter."
"This poured a very dark, near-black with a very thin head, but some lacing and thickness in consistency. The taste of dark, burnt roasted malts with a hint of sweetness. Dominated by the burnt character. The mouthfeel is quite strong with a high, burning carbonation that has a warming effect that is pleasant, but will make you wait between sips."
"I am probably not adequately versed in porters to give this a review according to the style. However, I know what I like, and I enjoyed this beer. Smell was of cocoa, coffee, and a hint of berries. The taste was lighter and sweeter than I expected, with a mild honey finish. Mouthfeel was also lighter than I expected; this is not a beer that coats the tongue, which makes it a good choice for holiday session drinking. Overall, another nice beer from Boston Beer Co."
"Amazing. Simply amazing. It has a beautiful and robust grouping of flavors. It is sweetly caramel in flavor, has a yet a nice crisp spice, almost resembling of nutmeg, but best of all is that it finishes out with a smooth chocolaty flavor. The smooth chocolate flavor comes with a fine velvet feel at the end. The beer is stunning, it tastes as though it is significantly more pricey beer then would be featured in a winter variety mix pack."
"All and all quite a good beer, I was just a little let down by the start of the drink. I was hoping for something a little heavier. But I do recommend it."
"Overall--not too bad, but certainly not the best porter I've ever had."
"d - really a nice winter brew. i may have started it out too cold because as it neared room temperature the tastes and scents really came through."
"Overall: If I could IÂ’d be picking this one up in Six-Packs tomorrow, hell IÂ’d even buy a case of this terrific Session Porter!!! IÂ’d even be tempted to pick up another Winter Classic CaseÂ…well, except for Â“thatÂ” beer, you know, that lÂ….lÂ…l..l..lamÂ…..nah, I canÂ’t even bring myself to say it. Note to Jim: please put four of these in next years Winter Pack and ditch the Turkey Juice."
"Like many others, picked this up as part of the winter mix pack from Sam Adam's. My smartest move was letting it sit at room temperature about 20 minutes before diving into it. Not sure what's so holiday about it, but it's a pretty good porter on all parts. Lots of caramel, chocolate nose and taste. Easy to drink with a creamy mouthfeel. A great example for someone just getting into this style of beer."
"Pours dark brown with a reddish tint. Creamy tan head with lots of lacing, great head retention. Smells like chocolate and coffee. Taste is roasted malt and chocolate. Medium body. This is probably my favorite Sam Adam's beer so far. It's too bad you have to buy the holiday twelve pack to get two of these."
"Attractive dark brown, keeping a thin film of head for the full term. Nice sheeting lacework. Roasty, nutty aroma, rich with malt and very smooth. Silky coffee with mild english hop undertones. The flavor is smooth and roasty, with caramel sweetness balanced by subtle herbal hops and coffee roastiness. A bit of plum fruitiness rounds things out. Melllow, english-styled carbonation. Lightish body. I'd call this beer exactly to style, nothing more, nothing less. What it lacks in adventurousness, it more than makes up for in tastiness. Probably my second favorite in the holiday variety pack, or equal to the black lager."
"A fine American porter in all, but as such it could be a little too much for my taste buds."
"Spotted a tiny bottle at my local Systembolaget and seized it. Next day there were no more Holiday Porter in south Sweden. I'm glad I did it. I'm not really a Sam Adams fan but this beer was good! It poured in a dark brown color but not with much foam. The smell was like dark bread and butcher's shop with notes of caramel and chocolate. The taste was sweet, dark bread and lots of chocolate. Maybe some coffee too. Arranged to have some more bought for me up north. Gotta have it with my Christmas dinner."
"Winter variety pack -- part II. Pretty agressive brew with strong roots and plenty of charisma. Strong porter-like attributes throughout (chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, toast, and walnuts). All show up evenly in the look, smell, and taste. A swift kick of hops (English) give a big pine flavor and aroma; adds spiciness, dryness, and a Christmas tree, get-in-the-mood kind of flavor. Aggressively bittered and flavored, but not to dominate the malts and other Porter characters. Finishes sweet and bitter with a bit of a roasted grain / hop bite. A bit dry. Good porter though."
"Drinkability: THis was an easy to drink beer for the colder months. I wish this and Old fezzwig were sold in six packs individually. Oh well :("
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a very dark brown with a good sized tan head. There's also a lot of lacing. It smells like caramel, chocolate, and coffee. Pretty malty all the way around. It tastes like coffee, sweet malt, chocolate and a bit of caramel. Along with the sweetness, there's a nice slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is light/medium, a little lighter than I expected it to be. The drinkability is good, it's not too hard to drink this at all. I think it's a decent beer, but there's a lot of porters I'd pick over this. With that being said, I'd drink this again. It is a good beer."
"Thick, black-brown color with a coffee colored head. Malty aroma. Taste is a pleasant mix of burnt malt, coffee and sweetness, nicely blended together. Finishes with a little bit of bitterness. Just the right amount of carbonation. Overall a tasty porter."
"This is one of Sam's better beers for sure."
"All in all a good porter from Sam Adams that i dont know if i would try without the holiday pack. So far this is the strongest beer of the 4 i have tried. This beer is worth a look. Make sure you let it warm up out of the fridge."
"Slainte!"
"Put in fridge sixer by my roommate. Another Samuel Adams brew that I was eying up. Nice 3/8"" tan head with lacing. Subtle burnt aromas.Taste of coffee & chocolate with light hop usage. Very drinkable. Yet another Sam Adams brew I like. Might have to buy another winter variety pack..."
"12 oz. bottle, 5.9% ABV. Best before May. Very dark brown in color, with some ruby highlights. Thick tan creamy, rocky head lasts forever, and when it does shrink, it leaves some great patches of lace. Roasty, buttery, and milk chocolate like in the nose. Smooth caramel, toffee, and chocolate, with a hint of fruit. Seems along the lines of an English style, as hops seem restrained. Very easy to drink, with a medium to full body. This one is worth searching out, however you probably have to buy the sampler pack to do so."
"This is a very tasty (and very hoppy) porter. The hops are very emphasized here, more so than the roasted malt character."
"EDIT: Note that in spite of the dates on the bottle, I'd recommend drinking this as fresh as possible. I had one on 2/20/07 that tasted like all the flavor had gone away in spite of it supposedly being good until April."
"D: Avery good dark beer. Very nearly a session type dark IMO. By no means will it replace my appreciation of the Imperial Stout (No comparison really) but overall a very enjoyable beer that I would gladly keep a stock of when available. More importantly, I could see myself longing for a clone recipe to brew again and again."
"I normally do not like dark beers but I wish this came in 12 packs."
"This was part of the Sam Adams Holiday pack. 12oz. bottle, with a freshness date of Apr.2007, poured into a pint glass. The beer appeared a deep dark brown, with no head, and very little lacing. The nose is roasted malt, with slight cocoa aroma. The mouthfeel is medium, about average for a porter. The taste is what you would expect from an American Porter. Nice chocolate/coffee flavor. This is a fine offering from Sam Adams. Too bad its only a seasonal release. I would easily buy a sixer of this, if it were available."
"Your standard porter with a bit of spiciness added to it. Be sure to give this not-so-typical beer a try."
"A pretty decent beer. Very dark brown/black, with a cafe au lait head that retains well. A nice toffee aroma, with a little chocolate. Coffee/chocolate taste, some hops. Medium to thin mouthfeel. A nice porter, wish there more than two in the 12 pack."
"D: As a ""holiday"" porter this really works! The buttery aspect lends itself to festive activities. Of course, I've always enjoyed a touch of diacetyl within certain beers myself, so maybe I'm biased. But this just seems to fit right in at the Thanksgiving dinner table!"
"Overall the Sam Adams Holiday Porter is an above average beer. I'll drink this one again."
"I'll drink it again. Beats the hell out of egg nog during the holidays."
"Served from the 12 oz bottle marked best before Apr. Pours a very dark brown with red highlights. This beer has decent head retention, rare for a Sam Adams from my experience, with nice lacing. The smell is all malts a nice profile from toffees and caramels to chocolate. The taste is much like the smell a little bitter and it finishes dry. Mouthfeel is good, the carbonation level seems just right for this beer. This a great beer to have on a cold winter night I may have a new favorite out of the Boston Beer company."
"Big tan head, rocky and three fingers tall. Faint notes of chocolatey malts and vanilla. Burnt malts, charred grains, bitter cocoa, and some sour acidity, which is fairly pungent a little detracting, probably resulting from a slightly higher than average hop addition. Good carbonation that translates into a creamy mouthfeel. Excellent sticky lacing all the way down. Not a bad brew but I could have preferred something sweeter and and a little more Â“holidayÂ”."
"Samual Adams Holiday Porter was nearly black in color (red-brown when held to a light) with a thick tan head. The head had good retention and left rings of lace behind. The aroma was sweet and toasty dark malt with some toffee and caramel. The taste was about the same as the aroma with some bitterness and a dry finish. The body was medium-full with plenty of carbonation. Drinkability was good. This is a good porter. Recommended."
"Notes: Sam adams has a ton of offerings and this has to be up towards the top for me. The double pilsner was a delight, and the cherry wheat I thought held up well within style. This is right in that league. Nice brew but nothing I'll throw punches over to get like those PS3 psychos."
"Extremely drinkable, this beer is. I remember loving this beer last year as part of a mixed Sam Adams 12 pack on christmas at my father's house last year. This confirmed my memory. Great beer."
"D- I like this one, but I might get tired of it. The various tastes as tough to find, so I could see myself losing patience."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Lately it seems that Sam Adams' beers have a superb handle on mouthfeel... this one really shines, with a silky texture with barely noticeable carbonation that just rolls like seafoam. The light, airy weight is perfect and certainly carries the true character of an American Porter, with its effortless drinkability over an entire session. Smooth."
"Pours nearly black with hints of ruby around the edges and a nice two-finger fluffy light brown head and great lacing. Smells of roasted chocolate malts and hints of coffee. Tastes much like the smell raosted dark chocolate malts that add a hint of bitterness and some spices. Nice, smooth mouthfeel that is smooth and creamy. Body was solid enough to let you know it was there without being too heavy. Drinkability is great. I can certainly see how this is great for a winter's day but I would enjoy drinking this tasty porter year-round."
"Pours a dark brown, almost black color with nice, thick, creamy head, and very good retention and lacing to match (poured from a bottle into a mug). Has a very malty smell to it with a hint of chocolate and caramel. The taste is also very malty with more than a hint of coffee. Toasty. Strong after-taste. Feels very thick, and heavy in the mouth, although there are thicker porters i've had. Overall a good beer. I was kind of disappointed with a few of the other Sam Adams holiday beers, so I didn't get my hopes up...but it ended up being one of the better ones in the mix pack."
"D - Another reason to look forward to the coming of winter -- Sam Adams' Holiday Porter. A very nice take on the style, and one that I wish they would sell in sixers. Easy to drink, easier to enjoy."
"Overall, I'd probably buy this again if it was available on its own, I was looking for a good porter at a reasonable price, and I couldn't find any Sierra Nevada porter. And I really can't see why this isn't available on its own, as I didn't detect anything particularly ""wintery"" or ""holiday"" about it -- certainly none of the egg-nog-in-a-bottle spicing you typically associate with a winter warmer type beer. Why not just call it Samuel Adams Porter and make it available year-round?"
"This is a mild but just flavorful enough to be enjoyable porter that was in the winter classics 12 pack from Sam Adams. A: medium to dark brown with thin head and transitory lacing. S: Very mild chocolate malts with a hint of coffee comes through late on the palate. T: Very smotth with a pleasant chocolately bitterness that is complimented by the light hop finish. M: A little thin for a porter but it didn't really detract from the enjoyment of the beer. D: A very drinkable porter, I just wish the 12 pack had more than one bottle in it."
"Overall, this porter turns harshly from sweet to bitter, and shows too much schizophrenic character to be truly enjoyed."
"A friendly, easy drinking porter..."
"I found this beer to beer a mediocre example of a porter. It looks great, but the flavor is weak and meandering. Drinkable and innoffensive, but there's nothing to get excited about here. Let this one warm or you won't hardly get any flavor at all."
"I don't really see what's so ""holiday"" about this porter. I mean, it's a good porter and all. Boston Beer Company could make this all year round if they wanted to. Yuengling does it."
"Not a bad porter, just a little the simple and boring side."
"Overall: I'm very happy with this offering from Samuel Adams. An excellent offering from the Winter Mix pack. I only wish it were available all year. Very good porter and I would highly recommend."
"Very dark brown almost black nearly opaque body with a couple fingers of head and a few ruby-red highlights. Smells roasty and hoppy, but not very strong. Tastes roasty and chocolatey... Flavor isn't overwealming like a normal robust porter, but very tasty and enjoyable. Body isn't as full as some robust porters either... Definitely a solid porter. Reminds me in some ways of Geary's London Porter if you can find it. Yummy."
"Pours a dark caramel bron with a small head, but very nice lacing. Smell is coffee, malt, molasses...nice on the nose. Taste is hints of coffee, chocolate...not overly cloying. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slight creaminess, yet with a slightly dry finish. Very refreshing and smooth..a definite recommend."
"Another awesome brew in the Sam Adam's winter mix pack. In my opinion, they should just replaced all the other brews and put six of these in there and six of the Old Fezziwig Ales in there. I hope the BBC keeps em coming with these kick ass brews!"
"Poured into a glass, pours a black color with a reddish tint that has a awesome head that leaves nice lace to the glass. Smell is bitter sweet malt. Taste is a very strong coffee with some hop bitterness in there as well, I can see why they call it a Holiday porter it would really warm you up on a cold winter day. Very robust and full flavored and a good addition to the Holiday pack from Sam Adams."
"A good solid beer. It looked like an Irish Stout, and didn't have much of an aroma (or at least that I sense). I poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. It left a bunch of lace, that ended up being really sticky. I got it in a Winter Classics case, and am happy about it because I don't think I could drink an entire case of it. Don't drink and review."
"D: There's nothing really ""holiday""-like about this, but it's a pretty tasty porter regardless of the name. Very drinkable porter."
"This porter poured a deep brown (almost opaque) color with reddish highlights. The foam was tall and creamy and light brown, and it persisted and left some lacing. The smell was strongly malty with some yeastiness together with resinous hoppiness. The taste was richly malty with complex flavors: some chocolate and hints of fruitiness. There was a goody hoppiness to balance. The mouthfeel was dry and creamy and smooth with medium-full body and good carbonation. The finish was dry and spicy. This was a very nice holiday porter."
"Thin bodied with sweetened coffee flavors coupled with a rich raisin background. Finish is slightly alkaline, though it brings you back for more."
"The holiday porter has a decent head and appears a near-black, very dark brown color. The aroma is nice and sweet and roasty. The taste follows with malty sweetness followed by roasted flavors and finished with some hops at the end. Mouthfeel is clean and medium to light bodied. This is a very drinkable beer, probably my favorite from the mix-pack, and overall solid."
"So far, everything that I would expect from a porter. The taste is the suprizing part. It is very hoppy for a porter. Usually I would expect maltiness up front with a slight hop flavor to finish. This one is almost in reverse. It doesn't seem very balanced. I don't think this is due to it being past it's prime. There are many other porters I will go to before coming back to this one."
"Into a Guiness glass, pours a near black, slight ruby hues around the edges, with light tan head and lots of streaky/bubbly lacing down the glass. Aroma is thick, molasses, roasted malt, faint dark fruits, and toffee. Taste has an astringent quality to it, burnt malts, with molasses and dark fruits, a warming feel to it, finishing with hints of chocolate and toffee. A beer to look forward to (though, a bit odd to drink in May)."
"Doesn't quite pack it like others of the style, but pleasurable in not being overpowering with sweet thickness. Makes for a nice, relaxing end to a winter workday."
"Drinkability: A very nice porter which would be welcome in my house any time of the year"
"Overall I thought this was a very good beer, although if I'm going to drink a Sam Adams beer of this or a similar style, I'd prefer the Black Lager, which I can at least get in a six pack rather than have to get 2-out-of-12 in a mix pack."
"Drinkability: Thank you, sir, may I have another? I can see myself in a pub downing pint after pint of this."
"Very dark ruby red color, almost black with a moderate tan colored head. Malty aroma with raisin, chocolate overtones and a nice lacing from the remaining head. There is a hint of cinnamon in the flavor which quickly changes to a crisp bitterness. Roasted malts with hints of chocolate come through, really a nice porter from Sam Adams. I wouldn't mind seeing this available all year in sixpacks."
"Overall, good flavor and good feel= nice brew! I was very suprised that Sam Adams could put out a nice porter. Very nice!"
"d"
"This is a bit too strong to be a session beer, but it's great for a winter warmer, after dinner brew, or just on it's own for sipping and enjoying. Probably my favorite out of the Holiday Pack, and something I wish they sold in 6 packs separately. Very enjoyable!"
"This is the sixth and final offering remaining from my SA Winter Mixpack. Many characteristics including aroma and flavor strikingly similar to the SA's Black Lager I sampled a few nights ago from the same pack. Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a Samuel Adams pint glass. Appearance is a rich dark brown, similar to a flat coca-cola, thin beige head fell slowly to light sticky lacing. Smells sweetly of milk and dark chocolate, caramel and malt with slight notes of hops and citrus present as well. Tastes sweet and somewhat of chocolate and cream, finishes with a nice hop bitterness balanced well with the chocolate malts. Mouthfeel is exceptional, perfect level of carbonation matches the brew well, goes down slippery smooth and creamy, very drinkable. Might not necessarily seek out in a store but would purchase again."
"Drinkability/Notes Â– Not my favorite porter. Can have a couple but would not seek it out average at best."
"Aroma is hoppy and spirtizy with a hint of chocolate underneath. Dark brown with a pinky thick mocha head. Get a hint of molasses in the fore followed by watery chocolate and caramel. Some coffee notes, but they are more like frappachino and cream flavors. Not a world beater and not at all roasty, but still a decent enough beer."
"this is a very nice porter and makes the holiday pack from SA very worthwhile along with the other offerings included, sans the cranberry lambic, which i just give to my wife to drink. definitely worth buying every year."
"Thick and black in appearance with a half inch brown head. Nice lacing on the glass throughout. A good balance of flavor with hops and malt ringing through. A variety of tastes including a chocolatey something or other (hard to read my scribblings) and a substantial but pleasant aftertaste. A thick beer but very drinkable. (That's my style preference creeping in.)"
"Part of a SA winter mix pack. Notched as best by March, with the code C27350052 printed on the neck."
"Good job! The only thing I was disappointed in was the fact that I most likely will have to wait till next year to taste this great brew!"
"This brew pours a opaque black color. The head is two-fingers in height, and tan in color. The aroma is of roasted malt, cream, chocolate, and coffee. The taste is of chocolate and cream with a hint of coffee in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied, almost too light for a porter. Overall, this is a decent porter, but nothing great."
"One other note: this beer benefits from letting it sit and warm up for just a bit. The tastes definitely became more pronounced as my ""session"" went on (I drank it leisurely over the course of a half-hour DVD viewing.)"
"Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is full bodied. Very nice velvety mouthfeel overall. Dam this is good and I want some more."
"Purchased as part of the holiday sampler pack, the nice wintry painting on the label was definitely festive, just like the sister beer Old Fezziwig. The beer came out burnt reddish brown with a head looking similar to foam on a cappuccino. The body was quite dark looking until held up against the light. Aromatically this was quite simplistic, since the basic smell was that of chocolate, and coffee, but much too light to be very interesting. The taste was a little more robust that the smell suggested, with chocolate and toffee riding atop soda water like fizz, and followed by a fleeting hint of grainy astringency. The hop oils showed up as a spicy earthiness, but werenÂ’t all that bitter. Light in the mouth, and in the aftertaste department, and therefore very easy to drink, I found this Porter to be in a similar veins as the Black Lager, which was also in the sampler pack. A side by side comparison indicated that I preferred the Black Lager a little more, due to the overall smoother feel. If the Holiday Porter might have beer grittier, it might have fared better."
"D Â– Not one of my favorites, but a good beer none the less."
"D - The holiday porter is the best of Sam Adams holiday offerings. The gouda that I had with it really accented the licorice flavor. This beer is one of the better Sam Adams offerings, but it is nothing that I would seek out in the future."
"Dark, almost black, with russet highlights. Formidable beige head and sticky lacing. Aromas of vanilla, caramel, and chocolate predominate; faint evidence of hops. Vanilla-laced coffee and roasted cocoa flavors witha deliciously crispy hop finish, contrary to nose-check. Thin-to-medium body and a smooth, slick mouthfeel. Super drinkability. Reminds me that I really need to check out more porters."
"The drinkablity is pretty good, though it doesnÂ’t quite satisfy my porter craving. I wouldn't mind having another, but I think I'd reach for a GLBC Edmund Fitzgerald or a Fuller's London Porter first."
"Drinkability: The best I've had from BBC, and a great brew. I imagine this is a pretty close approximation of a traditional English porter."
"I'm really not a fan of the famous ""Boston Lager", but this one is pretty good (as is Old Fezziwig). Toasty, burnt coffee flavor, mixed with caramel and chocolate. This beer manages this flavor while not actually being too sweet."
"I enjoyed this beer. It is a nice seasonal (holiday) offering. A very good bottled porter. This beer is a close relative to the Old Fezziwig Ale, also a Samuel Adams holiday offering. If you find this porter has too much bite for your liking, try the Old Fezziwig."
"Distinctive appearance, good taste for a porter, smells alright, and though heavy in the stomach, it's light enough in mouthfeel (while retaining porterish stiff-necked thickness) to remain drinkable. Hooray for the Sam Adams mixed holiday 12 pack!"
" Overall, this is very drinkable stuff for Christmastime or any time. My favorite so far of the winter offerings from the BBC."
"CanÂ’t go wrong with the pour. creamy and spicy porter-esk quaff, and drinkability of this one. Enough said."
"Tasted: 12/16/05"
"cheers..."
"The beer poured a very deep brown and almost black color with a finger of tan head with decent retention. The aroma was hints of coffee and roasted malts with some caramel as well. A good smelling brew. The taste coincides with the nose with roasted malts, espresseo and coffee and caramel as well with a very nice, dry finish. The brew has a slightly creamy mouthfeel along with a nice of carbonation: neither too much or too little. This is a very drinkable porter that is a shame that it is not availabe in other forms besides the holiday sampler packages. Sam's ""Holiday Porter"" is a solid American Porter that succeeds in eluding the downfall of other American Porters: overly light mouthfeel."
"I poured this beer out and it had a nice, creamy head. The color is a very deep black. Only a small amount of light comes through when held up. The smell is a nice malty smell. The taste is of toasted grain. It has a nice, oatmeal like taste with a good aftertaste. The mouthfeel is smooth. Nothing here upsets the tastebuds. The drinkability is high as well. A filling beer that I will look forward to each year."
"Body solidly medium with a slick, creamy texture and soft carbonation."
"I would love to see this and the Feziwig offered in bombers!"
"This Sam Adams classic regrettably only comes around once a year as part of the Winter Classics sampler 12 pack. Pours a dark ruby brown with a good rocky tan head and sticky lacing. The aroma is of roasted coffee, molasses and chocolate with slight hop spice notes. Taste is complex and well balanced between the hop bitterness and the roasted grains imparting coffee, chocolate, and caramel notes. An outstanding porter. It's a shame you get only two."
"Very drinkable on a cold Winter's night."
"Pours a standard porter black with a short, creamy khaki head. It was served a little cold so the nose and flavor were perhaps a little muted. Notes of roasted malts, espresso and toast dominated by a milky, luxurious caramel creaminess. I've never tasted such genuine caramel in a beer, let alone one this dark. Mouthfeel was a little thin, a creamier viscosity would have matched well with the caramel notes. All in all, a unique and tasty holiday porter, a sweet desert-like beer best enjoyed with a home-cooked holiday meal."
"D - Very nice drinkability. I would drink this year round if it was available. Excellent."
"Notes: A lovely looking porter from Sam Adams. Amazes me that the 6th largest beer company in the U.S. produces this beer. A great mix of caramel, chocolate, and coffee. Makes the Boston Beer Company's Winter Seasonal Pack an easy decision."
"Smell is there, but not super strong. Chocolate, yeast, and a touch of caramlized sugar. It's mildly roasty on the tonge and hints of chocolate and vanilla. Somewhat sweet for a porter, but not sticky at all. As the bottle says, it has enough hops to just peak through the bitterness of the roasted flavor of the malt. Very nice beer."
"12 oz bottle pours a dark brown almost black color with a beautiful creamy light brown head that leaves some lacing in the glass, roasty chocolaty malty aroma. Roasted malty chocolate and coffee flavors, nice dry burnt bitterness in the finish, a good porter I would drink this again."
"I reccomend this for a Holiday meal or get-together."
"The Holiday Porter is not quite pitch black, a bit of light intrudes on the edges creating ruby highlights. A fairly large dark tan head forms. The aroma is slightly sweet with a bitteresweet chocolate element in the background. The taste begins with a slightly roasted malt element, which imparts a bittersweet chocolate taste. As it approaches the finish, a sweetness takes over and a butterscotch taste comes into play, which is actually quite strong. It imparts an unusual element to this porter, but it never becomes so strong as to be cloying or offensive. The mouthfeel is a little thinner than I would like for a porter, but it doesn't take anything away from the beer. The drinkability is great because it's just a really good tasting porter. A great addition to the Sam Adams lineup for Winter."
"All in all, I believe this is a great porter. While there are some definate strong characteristics, I wonder what Sam Adams will come up with next."
"Had this one saved up from my holiday 12 pack from a while ago. Pours black, can't really see through it, brown head that fade rather quickly. A nice taste of bitter chocolate, burnt malt and a tad bit of sweetness, finishes with the bitter chocolate flavor but not too strong. I think this is becoming my favorite style of beer, keep 'em coming!!"
"871"
"While I didn't dislike this beer, it did nothing to make me want to replace Black Butte with it as my go-to bottled porter (it's not available where I live anyway). A mediocre porter that's alright to make do with if it's the only porter around, but not worth seeking out."
"Nice drinkable beer here that is a very respectable porter; to bad you can buy this all year."
"Appearance: Dark nearly opaque ruby brown forms a nice doughy textured tan head leaves thick bands of lacing on each sip. Aroma: Definitely British hop aromatics come through warming chocolate and coffee notes blended with those Fuggle and East Kent Goldings herbal notes. Taste: Great mix of dark roasted burnt roasts bring out layers of bitter dark chocolate and coffee tones. Herbal leafy hop flavor works nicely mild hop burps are welcomed nice English style porter with a touch of caramel flavor here finshes rather dry not overly sweet. Mouthfeel: Fuller bodied porter well carbonated not overdone somewhat chunky texture, quality brew. Drinkability: Smooth great tasting Sam Adams's porter where are the sixers is my only question, solid porter."
"Overall, this is a pretty drinkable beer. I'm not always the biggest fan of porters, but this one isn't bad at all. I'll certainly drink the other one, but I wouldn't make this a staple of my beer diet even if it was available year-round."
"Poured a deep,rich brown with a fluffy mocha colored two finger head that settles very slowly leaving a nice sheet of lace behind,alot of nice aromas going on roasted nuts and vanilla stick out most to me with a hint of milk chocolate as well.Those roasted nuts are quite noticable in the flavors of this beer as well,along with that vanilla not overly sweet a good almost herbal-like dryness comes thru late.Quite flavorful and drinkable maybe a little different take on a porter with some different flavors going on,well done."
"Bottom line: This is a very good Porter that kept my interest from first sip to last swallow and is anything but average. My new ""scores"" will reflect that."
"Drinkability: the drinkability is OK, and overall the beer is decent but not overly exciting."
"The beer has a rich chocolaty mouth feel to it. This seems to suppress the diacetyl that is found in the aroma, at least to a pretty good extant. Chocolate is the dominant note, with a bit of acidity in the finish, plus a bit of roast character. In the finish is that diacetyl note though, not so great that the beer is undrinkable, but enough that it is unpleasant. This was a bit disappointing, I was really expecting a decent Porter, in fact without the diacetyl notes this beer would have exceeded my expectations. I should note though, I am particularly sensitive to diacetyl."
"man, i love this brewery, almost everything they make is among my favorite for the style."
"Drinkabiliy: This would make a fair session beer, but I think the sweetness of it might get to me after a few."
"This beer would probably make a good session beer. It is low in alcohol, allowing you to drink a few. Also, the flavor is not overly aggressive. This is a good beer definately worth a try."
"Inky black, tan head that doesn't stay long. The aroma is pretty clean, roasty, with a touch of caramel and grainy maltiness. The flavor is dry, with a nice roasty bitterness that is punctuated with some hop flavor that seems kind of herbal or woody and gets stronger at the end. The two bitterness types blend well with the dryness of the beer and give a good finish. This isn't a strong, overwhelming porter and it seems more like an English porter than an American porter based on BA's style descriptions. This is admittedly influenced by the ingredients list on the bottle. I rather like this porter, its bitter without being exceedingly so and has a very nice balance of the different flavoring malts and hops."
"Drinkability was good except for the odd mouthfeel."
"This is one of the most drinkable porters I've ever had. It pours typical porter dard red/brown with a tan head. It has a less bitter hop profile than other porters but still that black malt flavor. A very good brew from Sam Adams that there is really no downside too. If you like the style then you'll like this."
"Overall: This is probably the best of the mixed holiday pack, in my opinion, just a solid porter that I'd buy year-round were it available."
"The flavor doesn't quite match the great smell somehow, but this is still a very good porter, and a very good representation of the style. Recommended."
"Still like this stuff a lot...even more now than I did in December."
"Drinkability: Not a textbook porter, exactly, but a pretty tasty variation. I liked it."
"Very nice, I wish I could get this in a 6 pack."
"Pours a dark brown with a huge coffee colored head, nice retention, decent lacing. Nose is a nice chocolatey roast, a little sweet. Taste is malty, slightly roasted, with a slight milk chocolate and a caramel finish. Mouthfeel is pretty thin and slightly fizzy. This is an OK beer, not that great though, I prefer the winter warmers from the holiday pack."
"Drinkability: I don't think I will buy a sam adams sampler again, it is clearly not the best examples from this brewery."
"A very black color with a nice two finger creamy head that lasts.The smell is a little weak.There is a hint of coffee and malt,but not much else.The taste is malty,but not as coffee and chocolate filled as other porters.It tastes like a little like a cola.It's not bad,but there are other porters that are much better.The m/f is a little too light for me.This isn't a bad beer,and I would have it again,but compared to other poters it is a little weak."
"Deep dark opaque brownish black color, very slight bit of a tan head and some fancy belgian lace. Aroma is rich roasted chocolate. Flavor opens with a rush of peppery spice from the earthy english hops and is dominated by dark bittersweet chocolate and roasted coffee-like malts. Medium bodied and coats the palate with a layer of sweet caramel and finishes slightly dry. This is a really nice porter that I think I would pick up regularly if it were a year round offering."
"Despite that, I enjoyed this one and would go back for another. It's drinkable indeed."
"It tastes of caramel and molasses with light undertones of coffee. As always, it has that Sam Adams bite to it. It is a little spicy and is a relatively dry stout which could be excellent all year round. Chocolaty..mmm."
"Over all a very nice nrew. refershing, tasy, and drinkable. I implore Jim Koch to brew this year round."
"Drinkability not so high. I couldn't believe how little there was to this beer besides a bitter chocolate bite. Ok with PF Chang's Great Wall of Chocolate, but not enjoyable on its own."
"Tonight was one of those nights. It's the first really butt-cold night of the year, my mind is a week ahead on food and beer, and I come home to a fridge full of beer. Do I go to the gym? No...too cold. But I DO feel like havin' me'self a mug o' porter! And this fits the bill. Pours a deep dark chocolatey brown. A hint of spices are notable in the nose, along with molasses and chocolate malt. Toffee and thick caramel find their way home, with mild notes of dark, bitter chocolate and some pine sap as well. Subtle hoppiness bitters slightly throughout. Carbonation nips the tip of the tongue and hangs there all throughout the aftertaste. Quite nice. Gulpable. One I see myself drinking throughout the holiday season."
"Delicious!"
"Part of the mixed winter pack. 12 oz., best by April notched on the back and 5.9% ABV - served chilled in a nonic. Pours a black that doesn't really thin at the edges like most porters but has ruby highlights in the right light. It has an inch of beige head that is cratery when it recedes and leaves great lacing for the first half of the beer. The aroma is soft and complex, creamy and buttery, with caramel, sweet chocolate, roasted malts, sweetness, and some kinda spiciness (nutmeg?, spruce?) that is akin to Anchor's Special Ale. The flavor is not as strong, with additions of coffee and piney/spicy hops that leave a good bitterness. The body at first seems quite thick, but it is medium with a carbonation that is a bit high at times. Overall it's a quality beer and I wish it came in sixers."
"This is a fine above average porter from Samuel Adams."
"Pours a deep black with ruby highlights. Thick tan head that leaves large amounts of lacing on the glass. Smells of malt, chocolate, and caramel. Creamy chocolate taste, hops apparent which suprised me due to the style and no hints of it in the smell. Medium bodied, creamy as described earlier. Decent drinkability for a porter. I wansn't expecting much from this beer but was suprised by its taste and smell. A nice brew that I wish I could get in a six pack."
"Drinkability: Pretty smooth and easy. Nothing off but nothing to get excited about either. Worth a try."
"I must say this truly a delicious porter. When you get this hop flavor mixed with the porter malt flavor, this becomes an excellant combo."
"I could drink this well into the night if it were my only choice"
"New flavors, but I was still unimpressed with this one. Probably won't have this one very often."
"Brew pours to a dark brown color, actually hedging on black with a thick foamy dark tan head that has incredible retention and leaves thick chunky lacing down the sides of the glass. It has an aroma of sweet caramel and chocolate from the malt, a very nice smelling brew. The taste is very good with its roasted characteristics up front the break to chocolate and coffee like tastes. Pretty dry mouth feel. Over all this is a very good brew, wish I could get it by it self."
"Mouth feel is medium bodied and a bit over carbonated, though it remains quite drinkable."
"I suppose this is a pretty good Christmas party beer that doesn't make me want to sit by myself and drink it."
"Very chocolatey flavor. Malty but slightly hoppy on the back end. This beer lingers. I'd buy again."
"Pours opaque black, with mahogany highlights. Spectacular three finger head, very dense and dark tan in color. Excellent retention, and stubborn patches of lace. Chocolate and caramel malt nose, with some light english hop notes. Burnt chocolate malt taste upfront, with a lightish munich malt sweetness and background coffee flavor. The light hop character reduces residual sweetness and dries the aftertaste, but is not needed to balance the already bitter and sweet malt flavor. Full body and light carbonation allow the sweetness to linger, but not become cloying. This is a ""big beer"" that finishes sweet, but smooth and drinkable enough."
"I liked this, a solid example of the porter, but unfortunately this is fairly rare. Came in the 12 pack."
"Maybe a little too fresh??? Try one. If you like it, drink it. If you get the same annoyance from the flavor hops(?) let it sit for a few months and come back to it."
"I'd be willing to try this again. It is very drinkable for the style and may be a good transition beer for those not yet into darker stuff."
"12oz. bottle: It starts out with a nice color. The beer pours a fairly dark, opaque brown. There is a bit of a tan head on it. The aroma is nice. There are notes of molasses, caramel and hints of chocolate and roastiness. The taste isnÂ’t bad at all. Maybe a hair lighter in body for a porter, but nonetheless good. I get some chocolate and the molasses in the taste. The other flavors are subdued and blend together in the background. No overt sweetness or bitterness. Not too bad."
"Thanks to Pegasus for the bottle!"
"Overall, the flavor just didn't jibe with me - too metallic and bitter causing it to be unbalanced and not very appealing."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce brown glass longneck with a pop top crown, served in a standard tap glass."
"What a good porter, one of the best IÂ’ve had in quite a while. Those Samuel Adams people have done it again; many of the new beers they release arenÂ’t too remarkable, but once in a while they pull off a great new beer. Wish they sold this one in six-packs rather than just with Holiday Mix-pack. But, I might just have to go and buy another Holiday pack JUST to get two more of these (yes, thatÂ’s how good this porter really is!!). Enjoyable and very drinkable. Highly recommended!"
"Caramel and ""biscuity"" pleasant aroma with a malty-spicy taste. Mouthfeel is thick, but nothing out of line for the porter style. This is a very drinkable beer with enough added flavor to mark it as a ""holiday"" brew, but not so much as to overwhelm. I wish this was available in my area in sixers - I could only find it as part of the Winter Sampler."
"Full bodied, with session beer drinkability."
"Very dark brown in color with a tan head. Sweet aroma with lots of roasted malt and nutty characteristics. The same can be said about the taste. Also noticed a little coffee in there. It leaves your mouth a little tingly which I didn't appreciate too much. I couldn't see myself drinking too many of these in a night. But it's a nice change from the other types of Sammy. A nice porter that would benefit from less carbonation. It could be a lot smoother."
"OVERALL COMMENTS: A bit off-style with the lack of black malt character and the fruity esters, but who cares, I say Â– I could drink these all day! Terrific!"
"This beer pours a rubied dark brown color with a 2 finger tan head that falls to coat the top. The nose is slightly chocolatey, slightly fig, with a bit of roastedness. The flavor is also very roasty, with a slight chocolatey coffee finish. Not bad at all. The feel is moderate, with a light carbonation. Overall, I was surprised by the amount of roasty. Its a little too much for me. The beer holds up very well though. Not a bad offering at all."
"A very dark brown beer with deep mahogony highlights when held up to the light. Has a small light brown head. The aroma is rich with carmel and toffee with a spicey background and a hint of cinnamon. The flavor starts out with a strong bitter roasted malt character and then fades with nothing else between that and the bitterness in the finish."
"Pure brown in hue; carbonated tan head. Some light espresso beans and freshly microwaved butter on the nose. Creamy and very oily and slick; well rounded mouthfeel that shows life of chocolate, licorise and dark roasted malts. Hints of vanilla and even some raspberry and fresh cracked pepper; rich, smooth and howÂ’s about delicious. This is a well made porter, can you say Â“How about year round?Â”"
"This nice looking brew pours a midnight black with hints of ruby when held up to daylight. Poured a nice 2 inch tan head leaving generous lacing. Smell is more malty than a classic porter usually is. Picking up faint hints of chocolate and coffee. Taste is a melody of malts, chocolate, and a smooth coffee hopped finish. Mouthfeel is pretty good although thinner than some porters I have had. Overall drinkability is good. I recommend this brew!"
"Part of the holiday 12-pack from Sam Adams. Pours a dark brown color with a small head that falls fast and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma has a grany character but with prevalent coffee. The flavor actually has a great maltiness - dark malts, chocolate, some coffee. Nice. The body leaves a little to be desired, could be thicker. Drinkability is ok, but I'm not sure I would buy a whole six pack of this one."
"My favorite of the Sam winter seasonals this year. Shame it was only available in the Winter Classics box, since that means for everyone one of these bought, a Cranberry Lambic was also purchased (shudder). Hardly seems just, or in keeping with the holiday spirit. Bring this one back next year, maybe let it solo."
"Reflection: This beer is pretty good when mixed with the holiday winter pack but I wouldn't pick this one up on it's own."
"Drinkability - one of the better SA offerings, get 'em while you can."
"Pours near black with shimmering dark ruby hues. Think tan head, with a settling lace of ample stick and stay. Roasted malts, blackstrap molasses, subtle coffee, and chocolate. Wonderful complex roasted malt flavor. Burnt, molasses, pleasing acrid astringency, smooth light toffee character beneath, with some chocolate in the finish. A tasty Porter, and another curve ball beer from Boston Beer Co ... keep 'em coming."
"I was reading the Dig article ""Something black this way comes"" by Jason and Todd Alstrom. I thought I'll see how they reviewed it. And dug through my coolers until I found the remains of the holiday sampler I recieved for Christmas. I would like to try the Black Lager (a Schwarzbier) just hit the shelves in six-packs and mix-packs as part of the Sam Adams BrewmasterÂ’s Collection they they describe."
"Nice frothy head and lacing, deep redish black. Smell is very roasted with some acidity apparent, toffee, and a fuzzy creaminess. Taste is sweet dough, dark chocolate, and a roast acidity that is a little too much in the finish, which is very dry and hoppy. ""Bitter beer face!!!"" Low carbonation but still a little bubbly. As far as porters go, this is one of my least favorites."
"Drinkability Â– A mild porter, a November beer Â– IÂ’d say a bridge between the big winter beers and Oktoberfest."
"nose is coffee, dark chocolate and roasted malt. Medium bodied and flavorful. Notes of roasted coffee, vanilla, smoke, dark fruits and chocolate. Finish is a tad lite on flavor, but makes up for it with a dry,smooth velvet flow over the tongue. Nice robust porter. Worth a try."
"The head is light tan and foamy: 2"". The beer is black, or a deep, dark garnet against the light. Sticky, thin lacing coats the glass. The smell is sweet toffee with a little milk. Up front is sweet toffee ice cream with fruit. The middle is chewy, but not quite satisfyingly full. There is some vanilla. The finish holds bitter toffee and is sourish. There are some juicy hops and also peas. This isn't bad. There are loads of toffee and a strong hop profile. But really, I'm buying a whole twelve-pack just for two bottles of this porter. I wish it were better."
"Mouthfeel was pretty good... I wish they had this available in six-packs, rather than just the holiday pack."
"Mouthfeel has a nice creamy aspect and good body. This is a nice porter that I could easily drink quite a few of. One of my fave Sam Adams offerings so far. I wouldn't mind seeing some six packs of this."
"Deep brown color with ruby highlights when held to light. It forms a nice creamy light brown head and leaves a bit of lace work. The aroma is a bit roasty with a tiny bit of chocolate and coffee. It also has a bit of caramel malts and some huskiness in the aroma. The flavor is malty and roasty with coffee and a bit of vanilla. It is medium in body and drying in the finish. Not too bad."
"12 ounce bottle. This beer pours out nearly black with a sizable brown head. The sweet malty aroma has chocolate notes and is slightly woody. Chocolatey taste up front. Nice roasted flavor. The finish is a little weak on the hops, but overall a very good flavor. Creamy mouthfeel. Nice drinkability; I could hardly put my glass down. This beer was by far the high point of a Sam Adams Winter 12 pack."
"Very dark porter-brown with a creamy, light-tan head. Nice lacing. Smells of roasted malt, burned brown-sugar, light smoke and leather with a hint of chocolate. Considerably aromatic and better than expected. Starts out dry and roasty. Baking chocolate-like faint sweetness. Woody, with a touch of smoke. Generous roasted hop bitterness. Finish is roasty and bitter with traces of woody sweetness. Medium plus bodied, with a creamy, mouth-coating feel. Nice."
"This beer pours an inky black with a small tan head, and it has quite an aroma. I smelled chocolate, caramel, and a bit of a coffee smell as well. The taste was somewhat bitter, with chocolate and malt well represented. I don't usually like porters, but I'll make an exception for this one! I wish that this beer was available outside the holiday sampler, I really wish I had more than 2 total (one now) bottles of it."
"I was just floored by the nose of this beer; the taste on the other hand was just your typical porter. Nice, drinkable, but really just another simple sam adams session beer. I miss the honey porter."
"Hearty, rich, full. All aspects improve with warming."
"I wonder why this brew isn't offered in its own 6 pack and/or on draught."
"This must be a new BBC brew, IÂ’ve hadnÂ’t read anything about it, but found it in the holiday 12-pack. It pours a dark brown, nearly black color, with a light-cream head. Moderate lacing. ThereÂ’s an average porter-like, roasted malt and toasted aroma. Caramel, black malt, and chocolate. Nothing extraordinary. Taste is relatively sweet and has a little fruit quality to it: plum and raisin. Finish is on the sweet side, and is only slightly hoppy. ItÂ’s a decent, enjoyable porter, but certainly not outstanding."
"Pours a deep almost black amber with a minimal beige head and Ok lace. Smells of roasted malt but not a very strong scent for a porter - a timid aroma. Tastes of a typical porter - a nicely roasted maltiness with some coffee, chocolate, a bit smokey but with a nice bitterness to it. It is fairly drinkable, especially at holiday time. The only thing that sets this apart from other porters is the fact that its bitterness at the finish is a bit stronger than most. Not a bad porter, but there are much beteer ones (and worse) out there."
"Drinkability: This isn't one that I'd go out and buy. It is worth trying and it is certainly better than many of the other Samuel Adams Winter-Pack beers. However, I'd rather drink their Fezziwig anyday. In fact, I'd rather drink their Boston Lager or Winter Lager. But, better than a yellow macrobrew...for what that's worth."
"I picked up the Holiday pack for this beer, and im glad I did. It poured a dark, almost black, with a full tan head. Great on lace all glass long.The aroma was of toasted sweet grain and coffee bean. That sweet toasted grain is carried over through taste along hints of nut, caramel & vinilla cap/coffee. A good balance of the malts at start and hops towards the finish. The body seems mid-level which may aid the drinkability. It dose aid the fact you wish you could get more than two. A nice holiday offering."
"Pours out nice and dark with a one finger tan head. Smells really nice almost invoking a feeling of a imp stout.That malty licorice smell.Taste was well balanced malt up front and hops towards the end.I gave it a low score on mouthfeel i felt it was a bit thin for the style.All in all a nice brew that i wish was more available then just in winter variety packs."
"The beer evacuates the 12-ounce brown bottle a deep brown to almost black with a portly light chocolate head that is semi-creamy in texture as it evaporates the lace forms a thick blanket to obfuscate the glass. Nose is lightly toasted grains with a hint of caramel, sweet and fresh, start is lightly sweet with a decent malt profile, top is middling in its feel. Finish is benignly acidic and the hops adequate, quite dry almost chalky in it feel to the palate, a so porter, will not win any ribbons with me."
"Major bitter chocolate in the palate with a slice of drying grapefruit. The malts are there, but somehow getting upstaged by the hops. The mouth feel is outstanding, to the point of being lip smacking and among the best I've had."
"Inky dark brown with a light brown thick and lumpy head of various sized bubbles. The head recedes a bit, but leaves a quarter inch layer atop, and a ring of lace around the inside of the glass. Inviting aroma of roasty malts, some raisin. Flavor is roasted malt, a little chalky, some raisin and plum, but also a bit of a tang, almost cherry-like, and a lingering coffee bitter. Interesting hop flavors moving in and out. Mouthfeel is full and creamy, although a bit tannic."
"Pours with a two-finger brown head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Almost black. Light-medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Nose is roasted coffee. Starts and finishes with a sweetish roasted chocolate/coffee flavor. 83Â¢ for a 12 oz bottle from Market Basket Concord, NH - should be sold in 6-paks instead of two in a 12-pak."
"Cheap coffe, some earthy / grassy hop flavours & a light chocolately finish. Medium bodied, easy carbonation. Nothing all that special."
"Not as good as the fabled Honey Porter but not bad....really looks the part...nice tan fluffy head...brownish black in color...nose has some subtle java notes...and dark cocoa...flavor is roasty...accented by vanilla bean....finishes with a piney hop hit...body is medium..creamy....overall a solid brew but nothing I wound buy again...."
"This porter is exceptional, pours a black ruby color with a mocha chocolate brown head that is amazing to see. The smell is of strong dark roasted chocolate and espresso beans, hints of maple syrup and light toasted grain, the taste is smooth simple and robust, a nice espresso up front and a smooth whipped cream with chocolate finish, very nice. This one warms me up in December, grab one today."
"Very dark with hints of red in the light, and an inch of head with some lacing. This feels great in the mouth, a great weight for a cold night. It didn't taste very sweet to me, the caramel and chocolate flavors were hinted at but not strong. It tasted a lot better as I let it warm, malts really came through. The hops have a complex, rich feel to them. The more I drank it, the more I liked it, I think because the beer was warming up some. I'd certainly recommend giving it a try if you like porters."
"Tastes as rich as it smells. Smoky roasted malt. A chocolate flavor that vasilates between bitter and milky. A nice hoppy finish, kind of spicy bitter hops instead of floral flavors. It is just so damn good. Wel-balanced and full flavored. Creamy mouth. Oh so tasty and goes down easily. This is not a huge knock-you-over-the-head style porter. Just well crafted and well balanced. Tasty as all get out and just a real honest, straight-forward brew. I love it. It's been awhile since i've enjoyed a porter this much. Bravo! Hope to see it regular."
"Porter Purists will write this one off and Jim Koch will ponder adding it to his regular offering."
"The chocolate comes through in the taste, almost like a bittersweet hot cocoa. Very rich body, the carbonation seems a little below average. This has the consistency of the root beer float. I'm having trouble picking up the hop, but can tell it's present because the beer is well-balanced. I recommend this porter."
"Worth the price of admission on the 12-pack."
"Tan head settling over clear deep red/brownish liquid. Nice roasted malt nose with with light coffee and apparent chocolate notes too. Rich mouthfeel, bitter deep roast barley taste with coffee/espresso flavors mix with great hoppy bitterness that compliments the malt flavors perfectly. The finish is long and bitter with just a touch of sweetness, just the way I like it. Much better that I had anticipated, well done!"
"Dark brown, almost black in spots, there is a ruby highlight around the edges, most noticed when held to a light. The head was over two fingers in height, beige in color. Head retention was excellent, it was slow to fade and it rested at a thin cap. This cap lasted the entire consumption. Subsequent lacing was chunky and widespread. It looks good in my glass. The nose is pleasant; the potency is low though yet I can hear what it is saying. Vanilla beans, espresso, chocolate, caramel, and roasted malts complete the bouquet. The aromas are well rounded; however it seems a little too simplistic. Sure, it smells like a Porter but it doesnÂ’t Â“knock me out.Â” Still, it is inviting. The palate says Â“English PorterÂ” to me. I like it. Roasted malts are bigger than the nose indicated, which is a good thing. Sweetness is satisfying from the start, caramel, espresso, and char as well. Vanilla. Chocolate. It becomes astringent at the finish. There is some noticeable hop bitterness but it fails to reach any noteworthy levels, however it does offer some earthy flavors. It is a nice complement to the malty backbone. On the whole this is a good Porter, it isnÂ’t great and it isnÂ’t something IÂ’d buy a six-pack of. So as far as IÂ’m concerned the BBC can keep the two bottles in the Winter Sampler but there isnÂ’t any reason to go beyond that. Not quite medium in body, the carbonation is a tickle too low, more body is needed. Kick up the malt! The mouthfeel is too slick, too oily, and not rich enough. This aspect of the beer could be improved. Sure, this beer is drinkable but it fails to Â“wowÂ” me. It is good but there are far too many better Porters on the market. This beer did sucker me into buying the 2004 Winter Sample Pack. Purchased in Omaha. Okay stuff."
"A fine effort from the Boston Beer Company. This would be a good candidate for a year-round beer, or at least deserve its own six-pack. Superior to most of the current SA lineup."
"Dark ruby beer. Thin, airy light brown head. The head recedes to a collar quickly, but the collar leaves a sufficient amount of lace. Nice aroma of roasted malts, vanilla bean, nuts and chocolate. The taste really follows suit with the nose. Roasted malts, some vanilla, coffee bean, chocolate and caramel malts. Pretty nice. Mouthfeel is somewhat creamy. The body checks in around medium to medium-full. All in all, a solid porter. Not one that I'd buy a 12 pack again just to get 2 though."
"Very, very nice porter...my voice rises in the choir to ask what makes it a ""holiday"" porter...no matter, this is nice nonetheless...why don't they so something this good year 'round, I gotsta ask..."
"Dark brown pour, verging on opaque but letting light through at the bottom. Tan head struggles a bit after a half a minute, but settles as a skin. Rings of thin fne lace with good coverage on a pint glass. Sweet caramel aromas, traces of black pepper and a slight roast. Pleasant medium mouthfeel, lightly slick at first but with an effortlessly well-done carbonation typical of many practiced Sam Adams brews. Starts out roasty with a good crystal malt counterpoint and finishes noticeable dryer if somewhat diminished in overall mouthfeel. The increased bitterness in the close would be better in style for me if the body held up as slightly thicker. Still, a drinkable beer without many distractions."
"I liked this beer alot, especially sice I am very critical of porters and usually only enjoy robust ones. I drank these all night at a card game and would do it again."
"I think Sam Adams gets a bad rap sometimes, and people are overly critical of the brewer. Sam Adams brews high-quality beers, even the ones that are bland and boring. They are still well-made! This beer is no exception. Pours a dark brown color with a medium beige head that dissipated quickly. Thin and sticky lacing. The aroma is roasty with malt, dark chocolate and hops. Medium-bodied with bitter chocolate undertones. Malt, caramel and some coffee flavors. The finish is where the hops become more apparent. All in all this Porter is not up there with FullerÂ’s and the like but it is definitely a good beer."
"From the Winter sampler. Pours with a nice 2 finger tan head (easily the most vibrant of this years winter sampler), atop a dark brown body which turns ruby when held up to a light. Aroma leans more toward chocolate than it does towards coffee. Taste is well balanced, no notes of coffee bitterness or flavors that really jump out at you. Very mellow porter. I'm not too impressed that they traded this for the magnificent cream stout in the sampler. Not bad by any means, it's just nothing earth-shattering."
"This is a great tasting, easy drinking, full flavored beer. It could be used as a stepping stone for those who do not like the dark malt flavors of a stout."
"A bit thin on the body, but it goes down smooth as can be. Great beer!"
"in the winter holiday 12 pack, poured with a big head that settled down to a good solid .5"" layer of tannish foamy goodness. along witha dark brown color. has a very subtle aroma a little bit of caramel but other than that everything elluds me. average mouthfeel and body a little hoppy aftertaste but non of the usual choc. roasty flavors that I'm accustomed to in a porter. still highly drikable and worth a shot, hell ya gotta get yer fezziwig anyway."
"I could drink this brew year round without a problem at all. I prefer this to the Ol' Fezziwig and hope they bring it to market as more than a seasonal offering."
"M.F./Drinkability- Smooth and easy to drink. No complaints here. A great porter, please put this in sixers next year or all year-round."
"Got it in...you guessed it, the Holiday 12pack. Overall I'm not impressed with the 12pack. Old Fezziwig was all right, Winter Lager was decent. I hate Sammy light, and the Cranberry Lambic was definately not my pint of beer. However, the Holiday Porter was a very pleasant surprise. Nice dark appearance with a rich pillowy head. Stuck fairly well to the glass. The smell was a little subdued, but a decent roasted malt and bitter chocolate notes. Smooth creamy mouthfeel with just a little bite. Probably would have smoothed out with some warming. I drank it a little too cold. Very well done. Not the best porter I've ever had, but a definate winner. Now if they would just fill this box up with Scottish Ale, this Porter, the Winter Lager, the Cream Stout, Boston Lager, and Old Fezziwig, You'd have a helluva 12pack. I'd buy 'em by the truck."
"Final Thought: One of the better porters out there, too bad Sam Adams doesn't brew porters in the masses year-round."
"Pour a dark brown color with ruby accents with a typical fluffy Sam Adams head, although in this case, tan colored. The aroma is quite good and full of cocoa. This is a very smooth, medium to full-bodied and malt-accented porter; in this way it seems to be a very English interpretation. I like the chocolately malt flavors, but I'd like just a touch more bitterness towards the finish; heck, I'd like some more hops -- period! It seems almost there is more bitterness from the grain the hops with this one. Still, a very well made porter, just not terribly complex or exciting."
"This is simply an all around good beer. Smell is strong in the spice and so is the flavor. Taste has more of those spices, they aren't complex but feel real Christmassy to me. Malt seems a bit weak and its tough to distinguish them. I don't really get any chocolate but more of an earthy toffee flavor in there. Lots of spices though that are backed by a decently thick, well-carbonated body. All in all this is a good holiday-style beer. This years Sam Adams holiday mixer is very, very good!"
"Pours out very dark - blackish with perhaps just a tiny hint of crimson whne the light hits it just right. Poured with a tiny tannish head that settled within a few minutes. The aroma on this one is something special for sure. Strong chocolate notes with a hint of alcohol. Also some hints of dark, rich malts. The flavors match the aroma quite well. Lots of chocolate and roasted malts. Well balanced with hop bitterness as well. Slight alcohol taste in the finish, which is every so slightly dry. Very good. The mouthfeel is excellent and true to the style. Quite think and substantial, but not quite as solid and chewy as a stout. For the style I think this is a very drinkable beer. Not something you'd want to kick back 6 or 8 of, but definitely a homerun hit for the BBC."
"This beer has a dark black body, with brown hues on the sides. Khaki-brown head leaves behind some lace. The main scent is chocolate malts along with some spicy tones as well. Chocolate malt in front, muted hop accent, along with some spice and nut notes. Med bodied. Overall pretty good"
"Not sure what qualifies this as a ""holiday"" porter, other than calling it that gives SA an excuse to include it in the winter sampler. Marketing aside, this was a very well put together porter. Rich, a touch creamy with nicely roasted malt flavors that did not stray too far to the caramel or over-roasted ends of the spectrum. Nicely punched-up hops qualifies for the robust porter designation (I think of it as a category). I lamented the passing of SA's Honey Porter, which was a nice crossover beer to introduce the style, and I'm happy to see SA put this beer in the lineup. I'd be happier if they made it a regular offering, rather than a seasonal. Surely they could kick a few cases of the cherry wheat off grocery shelves to make room. Nice label - a bottle of this and one of Old Fezzi and I'm ready to watch A Christmas Carol."
"5.9 % ABV"
"i found this to be spot on and a pleasant new additon to the winter classics pack. it pours a lovely deep brown colour with a big fluffy and chunky off white head that leaves a mess of residue on the glass. the smell is subtle but solid: caramel, chocolate, a touch of coffee and some roasted malt. a touch sweet and a touch earthy. nice. the flavour is equally good if not better: sweet but not overpowering earthy and malty but not too rugged. it definitely has a winter/holiday tone to it. there's a warmth here that just fits in right, and it;s not the alcohol as it does not make itself known at all throughout. it tastes at times almost likea mix of the chocolate bock and the honey porter bleded together seemlessly. really good stuff. if only they could eliminate the cranberry lambic and add an extra one of these and the fezziwig. grab the winter classics for this one alone, i'd say."
"Pours a dark brown/near black in color with a light tan head. Aroma of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel and a touch vinous. Full-bodied and well carbonated mouthfeel. Front features dark chocolate flavors and roasted malt. Hop bitterness emerges midway and really dries out the palate. Vinous flavor seeps through behind the hops. Dryness continues in the finish."
"Nice black body with brown head. Smells bready and sweet. Flavor is overall light, kick of flavor in the beginning and coffee aftertaste. The mouth feel is light and crisp, and drink ability is pretty good. Not a big beer that a lot of BA's look for, but it's light charactor is refreshing when you are not looking to blow your sences away."
"Pours a nice black color and has a thick tan head that leaves decent lace rings in my glass. It has a wonderfully smooth malty aroma that screams drink me. The flavor is very smooth and the dark malts are in balance with the caramel and they don't overpower the flavor like most porters. I love the balance of the hops too. This is a great porter and hopefully it will see time in Boston Beer Company's regular rotation. Thank you Jim Koch and the brewers at BBC for another fine beer."
"The taste is fairly bland, but bitter. The malt taste is barely there. There may be a hint of caramel as it is mildly sweet. Most porter that I have tried have some sort of flavor, but this one is not very flavorful."
"Much like the other reviews of this beer, I was also very excited for the new addition of the Sam Winter pack. Specifically bought a 12 just to get my hands on three of these babies. I will say it did not disappoint either. The presentation is wonderful, a deep ruby brown and nudging toward opaque. The head is a perfectly formed, fluffy and tan, and about an inch in stature. The odor reeks of roasted chocolate malts and that's when I get excited. Before any of the actual flavor, I notice how robust the mouthfeel is, but how smooth it remains. The actual characteristics combine a nutty taste with a more omnipresent mocha overtone that is delightful. It finishes bitter and dry, a transformation from a roasted malt to a burnt cocoa taste. Great interpretation of the style."
"My bottle was from the Sam Winter Sampler pack. The beer pours an incredibly dark color with a thick amber head. Immediately chocolate is noticable in the smell and also is present in the taste along with a coffee like flavor. Mouthfeel is similar to a Guiness with a watery feeling but this has much more of an alochol taste. I wish this were available outside of the sampler pack as I would definetly make this a routinely drank beer."
"Pours a very deep black, reddish core when held up to the light. Large creamy head colored a light tan. Aroma is chocolate and a nut-like (almond?) extract. Decent alcohol in there also. Taste is more of the chocolate, and roasted coffee, slight bitterness in the finish. A little watery/loose feeling, leaves a little to be desired. Pleasant beer that I wish was available outside of the holiday package."
"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy tan/brown head that slowly fades. The aroma is great. It has a smooth and sweet chocolatey scent that is very pleasant to the nose. There are also hints of patent and crystal malts, but the chocolate scent is overpowering. The taste is good. It has a rich black malt presence along with a chocolate element. It goes down easy and finishes rather dry. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good porter. It is full of body and flavor, although the taste just wasn't what I expected from the aroma. This is a good drinker regardless."
"My only other wish is if I could buy it in it's own six-pack, and not have to figure out what to do with the Sam Light and Cranberry Lambic included in the 12-pack that I'd rather do without."

"Holiday Porter is the newest addition to the Samuel Adams Winter Classics collection, and it's a winner. It is the color of Coca-Cola, with a thick tan-colored head (about 3/4"") that lingers for several minutes. Smell is slightly malty, not too intense. Taste is pleasant, a bit on the bitter side. Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly thick. Alcohol content is 5.9%. An above-average brew, but not one of the great ones."
"Mmm. Brown rice and rich mushroom gravy to go with this ale. Hello."
"Overall, not a bad addition to the Sam Adams family. I can thnk of many other things Sam Adams makes that I care for much less than this. Not bad at all."
