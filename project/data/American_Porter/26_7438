3.75,-9,4,4,3.75,3,3.75,"On tap at FFF brewpub poured into a half pint. Appearance is very dark brown with little light coming through. A stiff tan head stands an inch over the beer. It clings tightly to the glass in patches as the session goes on and Finding Nemo flashes on the screens in the pub. Aroma is pine, cocoa, roasted malt, and the slightest bit of orange peel. Quite hoppy for a porter. Taste is initially bitter with spruce and anise. Then the essence of one of those chocolate-wrapped oranges from Christmastime slides in. Roasty and charred notes on the swallow. Medium body, creamy, but thinner than it looks, moderate carbonation, semi-dry finish.","SierraFlight","Mar 02, 2015"

4.32,4.9,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,"Overall, Alpha Klaus sure has some hidden smokiness up its sleeves.  At first you don’t really get it.  Things remain all about the hops, and the balancing sweetness of your nicely warming base porter, which is superb.  Once temperatures start to rise, however, is when the grain begins to show its true form.  This particular component is more true through the taste, but in the nose, the hops enhance even further, taking center stage.  These hops show off just enough evergreen hoppiness to keep things decidedly in the Xmas spirit.  Speaking stylistically, this is a wonderful, true hybrid.  It has all of the amazing hoppiness and oily bite of your best black ales or black IPAs, but with a much, much greater and tastier base porter to build off of.","TheBrewo","Feb 21, 2015"

The beer poured an opaque dark with ecru head that left a nice laceing. The scent was subtle earth and peat...did not get much hops. The taste was a wonderful, what I would call, standard porter. There was subtle hints of earth/peat and a very faint touch of pepper. The mouthfeel was medium in body and very creamy....there was smooth carbonation.

Big hop aroma that I wasn't expecting. Pine galore, some lemon, some roast, chocolate, and big sweet sugar. Big chocolate and hop mixture in flavor. Lots of bitterness and pine, some sweet chocolate, then a bit of buttering roasted malts. Medium bodied, pretty smooth, with medium plus carbonation. Very drinkable. Dry finish. I was not expecting this at all, and for some reason was thinking this would be a big sweet chocolate dessert. I like it though, and it is a big hoppy porter bordering on black IPA. Glad I finally got my hands on this one.","BMMillsy","Dec 16, 2013"

I prefer a happier beer, and this is a nice change from the over-spiced Christmas dark ales that tend to be the standard. This is a great holiday beer, it's just done the FFF way, lots of delicious hops!","brewtus","Mar 27, 2013"

4.42,7.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into signature Teku tulip; November 2012 release. Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger fairly dense dark tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, grapefruit, pine, orange zest, floral, cocoa, caramel, coffee, light char, and piney spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great balance of hop and dark roasted malt notes. Taste of dark chocolate, roasted malt, grapefruit, pine, floral, char, coffee, caramel, and roasted earthiness. Good amount of roasted pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, pine, citrus, floral, char, coffee, caramel, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance and complexity of very dark malty flavors with citrus/pine hops; with a great malt/bitterness balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very creamy, sticky, fairly crisp, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. I know this is labeled as a porter; but in my view, this is an absolutely fantastic Black IPA! Big balance and complexity of dark malt and citrus/pine hop flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on. An extremely awesome offering!","superspak","0"

Great retention and significant lacing present. Bakers chocolate, general roastiness, burnt sugar, and grapefruit rind on the nose. This is a beer whose taste closely follows the nose: roasted malt, light espresso notes, dark/bakers chocolate, and burnt caramel and sugar. The hops make their presence well-known toward the very dry finish in the form of grapefruit rind and spruce-like bitterness. Medium bodied, well carbonated, and slick and a bit oily. A very unique porter and one that I welcome every year around the holidays.","chanokokoro","Dec 28, 2012"

Idk if it's their yeast strain or the water they use, but every one of their brews has that 3 Floyds flavor character to it. This is not only one of the best Porters you'll ever have its also one of the best Christmas seasonal beers you'll ever have. Putting 2 n 2 together make for the worlds finest Christmas porter. Period. This will never leave my 12 beers of Christmas list. It's just a thoroughbred porter. I'm a huge fan of holiday brews and of American porters, so this one is just a winner all the way around this time of year. It's a must try for porter and holiday beer fans alike. I am starting to sit and think of what brewery does absolutely everything right in terms of the family of beers they happen to offer, and the crew at FFF are at the forefront of that topic every single time. It's remarkable and so is Alpha Klaus.","BradtheGreat7","Dec 17, 2012"

It's actually on the smooth side with a medium full body, helping to knock down any lingering concerns I had over the dose of hops used in this porter.

But in the flavor, the chocolate comes into the foreground to stand alongside spicy and earthy hopping and the pine resin retreats into the background. It does gain a flavor note of chocolate-dipped dried orange peel as the glass warms up towards room temperature. Bitterness is evenly distributed throughout. I was braced for a lot more dissonance of flavor than what I actually received. Well done, Three Floyds, well done.","WastingFreetime","Sep 21, 2012"

The taste of the beer has a hoppy kick up front, it's almost like a black IPA at first. Then as the hops fade the chocolate lingers in the aftertaste. The beer has several layers of transitions in the flavor. It makes this beer very impressive. The mouthfeel of the beer had a great body to it along with a a solid carbonation.

Rich, creamy toasted malt with a bit of a sharp hop bite starting at mid-palate that doesn't really serve this particular style all that well. Mouthfeel is quite creamy for a porter. You get flavors of coffee, bakers chocolate, and a slight bit of orange rind from the hops. A terrific beer that, in my opinion, is a bit too hopped for this style. It's very subtle, but the flavors tend to be just a bit too bitter on the finish. Still worth trying if you can find it.","deadonhisfeet","Nov 20, 2011"

Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, and pine-like herbal hops. There is also a slight coffee aroma if you smell hard enough. Taste is of dark roasted malt, coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and some citrus zest hops on the finish but not as strong as the smell would suggest. Medium roasty bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a much lighter body than I was expecting with a crisp yet smooth mouthfeel.

Great Lakes was great but not as full bodied and complex. I don't consider any porter like Ballast Victory @ Seas an American porter because it's an Imperial Porter @ 10%ABV, so anyway yum.

Caramel, cocoa, vanilla, and roasted malt flavors at the beginning. Then the hops kick in for a bitter hop and chocolatey finish. This beer has a silky mouthfeel with medium carbonation.

3.7,-10.2,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pitch black with one finger of head that suddenly settled to a thick cap. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. Bizarre aroma of piney/grassy hops and burnt, roasted malt. I can tell they packed the aroma hops into this beer. I have never tasted a beer that tastes like Alpha Klaus. Even the over-hopped Imperial Stouts do not pack the hop flavor of this porter. A lot of resinous pine (pine forest or Chritmas tree fire comes to mind) and grass. The yeast did their job because despite the sugar addition, this is one dry beer. The chocolate malt does not play a very large part of the flavor profile and that is a bit of a shame. The malt gets overpowered by the hops. Tastes almost wet hopped. A wet hopped, Christmas Porter or a Black Christmas IPA? Don't give lesser brewers any ideas now. Bitterness is higher than any porter that I can recall. I just cannot give this beer a higher score because it is so unporter-like. The appearance and mouthfeel are the only things reminiscent of porters. Nicely carbonated but could of used a little more heft in body. A hopheads dream of a porter. One of these a year would be enough.","morimech","Dec 24, 2010"

I feel that it would do well to sit for some time, perhaps 6 months to 1 full year to allow the hops to mellow out and allow the malts to showcase their flavors; the argument to that would be that it is only 6% ABV and may not stand the test of time, even if kept in a relatively decent closet/cellar or whatever.

The nose contains a strong contingent of green hops, with some chocolate and light roasted malts in the background. The taste holds a touch more roast, but it's still only a vain attempt at countering the hops, which have maintained their strength. The body is a light-ish medium with a light moderate carbonation. Honestly, I can see why people could like a rather hoppy porter like this one, but I am not one of these people.

It's a really drinkable mix, I must say that this beer is one of the better things I've ever put on my tongue.

A very creamy 1 finger head sits at the top with excellent retention and some of the best lacing I have seen in a porter. Smell is huge hops up front - bitter, pine, some spiciness. Chocolate, caramel and roasted malts follow. Hop forward but still relatively balanced flavor. The spicy hop flavor plays well with the chocolate sweetness. Some roasted malt and hitter hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is slightly thick and chewey, medium carbonation. Drinkability is good, but not as good as some of the less hoppy porters like Great Lakes or Founders. Hoppy flavor gets a bit overwhelming after a while.

It had a great consistency and was incredibly smooth. It's one of the most drinkable beers I've had, and my list is extensive. The only knock on this beer is that it only comes in 22oz bombers.

4.26,3.4,3,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Into dogfish snifter. Black, various sized bubbles compose a nice 3/4"" khaki head. Head drops to a fog and a solid ring. Super malty nose, all rich caramel and chocolate. Almost an interesting note of wood, like ceder or something. Quite a bit of carbonation, fizzles and brings back the head with a swirl. Smell is clean and clear, maybe a little meaty, some licorice too. Flavor is really great. Hops don't show themselves in aroma or flavor, obviously an aged bottle, considering FFF haven't been distributed in Ohio for a long time, no idea where dude got these or how long they've been in his cooler. Flavor is an amazingly complex blend, rich round chocolate, no lingering bitterness but definitely not too sweet. Sweet creamy coffee, light easy drinking iced tea, such a smooth light flavor without being bland or one note. Glad I got a second bottle of this. Drinks super easy. Feel is good too, only the slightest bit mouth-coating, not sticky at all, mostly helps the flavor linger. These kinds of finds are always great. As the beer warms flavor starts showing some fruit, raspberry I think. It's interesting to me that drinking and tasting this beer is definitely linked to my situation right now. I'm enjoying this beer, while watching the new K-OS video, I'm reminded that I really enjoy his music.

Tastes somewhat sweet, roasty, chocolaty and malty. After spending a half hour riding to the bar in 35 degree weather on my motorcycle, this was very warming! After the first sip, you feel much better. The mouthfeel lost a little in my opinion, there was less carbonation than I expected and it felt a little slick going down. Almost oily.

4.35,5.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a deep, dark, smooth clear black. Very nice looking. The head forms about 2cm, falls back a bit, but sticks around. It's tan, dense, and nice - leaving stick bits of lacing. A very beautiful beer. The smell is very nice, too. A bit of roasted barley, but backed up with a very nice caramelly sweetness. A bit of semisweet chocolate, and a whiff of some grain, maybe a hint of some alcohol, bourbon kind of, but I think it's just the dark grain husks. The taste is just like a great straightforward american porter. It doesn't come out with anything different than you expect, it's just very well executed. Very clean, filled with roasted barley and a very nice rich sweetness. It's still dry enough, a bit grainy, and toasty that it is well balanced. At the end there's like a dense, crusty bread with some chocolate sauce. This is just the definition of an American Porter. The bodyis about medium, with mild carbonation, a bit of a rush, no real sting. It's pretty good, probably a bit heavier because there's more grain in it. The beer is very enjoyable. If this wasn't so high in ABV, with this flavor, I could stick with this for a while, but I think this is still really great. I would recommend it if you can find it, and I'm not sure if the months that have passed have made it better, but I know that this is good now.","taylorhamrick","Aug 22, 2009"
4.32,4.9,4,4.5,4,4,5,"22oz bottle shared by photomike. Black with a medium beige head. The aroma is just outstanding; a mix of potent tropical fruit hoppiness (mostly pineapple, with a good dose of ripe grapefruit) and subtle dark chocolate. If you close your eyes, you might almost think IPA, but the chocolate is also unmistakable. The flavor also has plenty of tropical fruit and dark chocolate, with a dry, earthy, almost smokey quality as well. The finish is dry and earthy with a medium bitterness that isn't nearly as intense as the hop aroma and flavor. Not nearly as thick thick or sweet as I had expected, and I really like that. This drinks much easier than you might think, in a sharp departure from a certain stout that FFF makes, with a medium body and moderate carbonation. This was an awesome and pretty unique beer. Reminded me of Stone 11th, but more toward the porter end of the continuum.","bulletrain76","Aug 08, 2009"

Too bad I only have one bottle of this seasonal brew, but Christmas is only eight months away, so I will definitely be asking Santa for more. So onto the review... poured into a pint glass, leaving a good portion still in the bottle. Appearance is pitch black with a one inch frothy head. It smells wonderful, like a Christmas porter should smell with chocolate being the dominant feature. Taste, well, is good, but I'm gonna let it warm up a bit before really diving in. The taste develops as it warms; I don't think this beer is meant to be consumed refrigerator cold, in the same way Three Floyds' Moloko Plus improved as it warmed and the carbonation of that brew became more tolerable. As this Three Floyds brew warms up, the frothy head disappears, leaving only lacing on the Samuel Smith pint glass. Three Floyds does a very nice job of blending in the hops, as the hops do add a very nice kick to this Christmas Porter. A very enjoyable brew. Thanks Three Floyds.","cadizkyguy","Apr 13, 2009"

4.5,9.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"2007 Edition, decided to kick off the holiday week of beer with a FFF Alpha Klaus. I was a little worried that this one sat too long but once I popped the top and the aroma of coffee and chocolate filled the air. Poured black with a beast of a head that overflowed my Corsendonk snifter. Aromas are coffee, roasted malts, and an underlying sweetness. Flavor is bitter chocolate up front highly carbonated on the palate and believe it or not hops are still present. Finish is all roast and a slight burn from the alcohol but no real alcohol flavor. A top notch porter. FFF does it again.","mbrasi","Dec 17, 2008"

The beer pours black with a frothy tan head that leaves a nice cap on top of the body while providing ample amounts of lace. The aroma delivers an interesting mix of bittersweet chocolate and spicy citrusy hops. The taste hits you with the bittersweet chocolate up front, followed by a citrusy hop aroma and then finished with a residual milk chocolate sweetness. The body is between medium and full with a full amount of carbonation that only adds to the body. This is an interesting spin on the porter style. It is quite strong in the dark roasted malt character along with a significant hop presence. I would expect a sweeter and more chocolaty presence in a porter, but Three Floyds take on the style is certainly interesting and tasty.","MSchae1017","Jun 06, 2008"

Nose is nice: huge roasted malt, coffee, and some light chocolate. Also very mild hops. Taste is as advertised. Huge roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, a strong piney hop flavor as well, that quickly transforms into a consistent bitter lemon (actually quite similar to the other Three Floyds brews I've had). Good body with solid carbonation. Overall, quite a tasty beer, although not as earth-shattering as I'd expected (I think BA got my hops for FFF up a little too high - I've been let down by everything except for the Alpha King).

3.78,-8.3,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Sat down last night with a couple of friends and a 22 oz bomber of Alpha Klaus. Poured into a large Medieval Times glass which resembled something halfway between a weizen glass and a tulip. Worked well enough. Appearance was at first a deep, impenetrable brownish black with a dense tan head that subsided rather quickly. Smell largely consisted of a floral hop bouquet that instantly lets you know you're about to quaff a FFF brew...even so, I was expecting a bit more from the nose given the dark and intriguing appearance. Taste followed smell in the hops department, but also revealed a roasty malt and subtle dark chocolate character that gave way to some alcoholic presence. Mouthfeel was smooth and lightly creamy, with enough carbonation to make it lively. I didn't have any trouble finishing the entire bomber by myself, and I'm a pretty small guy, but I don't think I would drink this on a regular basis.

This is a really wonderful smelling brew, by far the most complex porter I've stuck my nose into. Charred wood flavors to begin with which is followed by molasses and brown sugar. A mocha french roast flavor midway blended with mild pine hops as well. Aftertaste is a nice roasted barley with a hint of hazelnut. Mouthfeel is medium to full with a somewhat weak carbonation, almost water-like. I found this extremely drinkable, and just a notch above GL's Edmund Fitzgerald IMO.","BeerTruth","Jan 02, 2008"

First sip carried right off the smell, with up front notes of smoky strong bittersweet chocolate, bold roasted malts and dark grains, and strong hoppiness, finishing with a light porter-type mustiness that fades to an unmistakable well hopped bitterness.

I was not expecting this strong of a hop presence in a porter. Chocolate, toffee, caramel, and coffee all made their expected appearances, but the hops caught me off guard. They were fresh and piny. Interesting. After tasting it, I was more than grateful for the strong hop presence. Added a very nice balance to the strong malt backbone. After the first sip, I could not help but immediately look at the drink in admiration. Medium bodied and extremely drinkable. I think I may have found a holiday tradition.

At any rate...pours a beautiful dark opaque brown with rusty highlights around the edges. Super soft, light brown head that has a wonderful thickness to it. Looks like something I'd want to put on top of some chocolate cake. Smells immediately like I'm in a backwoods hop patch. And, unfortunately, I hate to be cliche, but it does smell like Christmas. Super, smooth creamy mouthfeel transports a huge delivery of roasty, chocolatey, caramel malt into the palate. Not too far behind is the surprising hop presence. Very hoppy for a porter. I even has a bit of that stringent porter character, which I'm not always a fan of, but its pulled off with perfection here. I'm assuming its the other flavors that balancecd it. The beer finishes with a nice dry touch and a lingering aftertaste of dry, dark cocoa powder. Man, this stuff is just amazing, its unlike any other porter I've had.","BeerHonky","Mar 09, 2007"

Taste was also nutty with big amounts of roasted coffee and a little peaty.

Not what I expected for a porter. I can also smell chocolate and a little smoke. Decent initial head that fades away quickly. Color is dark rich porter. First sip is of oily hops with a chocolate background. This is as oily as some of the larger barelywines Ive had. Thats a real feat for a 7.5% porter! Even though theres a shitload of hops here- they are not out of place. NOt overly astringent, just a flavourable balance with the sweetness of the malt. The malt is very rich and reminds me somewhat of a impy stout moreso than a traditional porter. no matter- it is delicious. At first I thought this would be a real slow sipper, but I really gained speed plowing through this treat. First rate brew- hope to try again one day.","oakbluff","Feb 18, 2007"

The finish is hoppy with the bitter following in the aftertaste begging for another sip. A delicious beer, with a great balance in flavor and mouthfeel.

Tastes are of dark chocolate, roasted malts, strong espresso tones, dry chariness, and balanced excellently balanced by a hefty amount of hops providing mostly esters and bittering character. The hops fruity notes are sweet and sour at times giving this a well rounded profile. Towards the end buttery caramel and spearmint notes are clearer. Some alcohol burn slips through but no way considered unenjoyable. The finish is much of the taste coming through with a higher dry, tart character.

A deep chocolaty flavor wraps itself on the palate, then the hops come foward and that hop flavor lingers there long after the beer is swallowed. An oily texture, that does coat the palate, is slight chewy at the end. Again Three Floyds makes another great beer, that brings strong flavor.

4.42,7.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured from bomber into nonic, nice sticky looking off white head that dissipates into little more than a film, and leaves little thin lacing. Body is musty black brown, almost opaque except when held up to light then the typical ruby is apparent and I can see the figure of my hand. Smells immediately of typical Three Floyds hop bouquet, with a chocolate underbody or backbone, hints of coffee, cocoa, pine, there is a mild roasted nutty character to this, and hidden bits of vanilla. I think as this warms the hop character mellows out or maybe I just adapt to it. Its strange one minute I feel the hop character is in competition with the dark malts and then the next Im fine with the balance, its sort of a strange brew that way. The taste is reminiscent of dry roast coffee, with an underlying smokey nuttiness, that then exposes a slightly milky chocolateness with little hints of vanilla and then turns back to roasted coffee. The bitterness in the flavor is very nice especially as it warms not over bearing. Personally this could be a little more robust, I enjoyed this beer a great deal, but its not quite what I had hoped for still tasty just the same I'm sure I'll grab a bottle next year.","mmcave","Jan 07, 2007"

Mouthfeel was pretty good but wanted just a little more creamy. The taste was excellent. Goes down very smooth with a not too bitter finish. It's been recent that I've started to enjoy porters so can't wait to try this again next year to see if I love it even more.

There is some twangy citrus acidity on the back of the tongue while a smooth chocolate flavors slides underneath on the front of the palette.

The hops really make this beer stand out - despite all the rich, thick roasted flavors, you can still taste and get a nose full of the IPA-like dry hopped elements. Very smooth and nicely chewy. Quite possibly the best porter I've ever had.","RockyTopHeel","Dec 25, 2006"

Whats nice about it is that nothing really jumps out at you. The taste of the dark malts is well apparent throughout.

The body has a nice heavy gravity to it, sliding down the throat langorously like carbonated molasses... only a slight exagerration, but the enthusiasm brought about by this beer encouraging a bit of truth stretching. The hops arent nearly as dominant on the tongue as the aroma, but still marginalize the other tastes. The actual taste of the hops used is quite excellent, however.

Nose is full of coffee molasses, burnt cherries, even a bit of vanilla. Very deep. Taste is pretty damned impressive. Upfront there's a stab of sweetness, but it's quickly overridden by an onslaught of burnt molasses, deep caramel, coffee and burnt dark fruits. There's more than a little bit of woodyness, from hops perhaps? and at the same time a note of green hops as well, and a vague yet profound citrus hop undertone. Midpalate there's a sensation of bittersweet chocolate (70%), which is incredibly impressive and not a compliment i concede lightly. It makes the beer. Substantial supporting bitterness.

Darkest opaque brown with a beauty tan head that is only so very lightly marred by big bubbles that look like pepper. The smell is all piney hops from the outset. A little balance on the malts would have resulted in a higher score. The hops blend smoothly with the malts in the initial taste profile, but the hops soon dominate (go figure from these guys...like Stone Brewing Indiana Division at times.) The mouthfeel falls just short of satisfyingly full. Drinkability is fine for this if you plan in moving to a double IPA. The ABV is not so high as to keep you from having a second and the hops are pleasant (though if you do not like hops, I would avoid this brew.) This tastes like Christmas should taste.

The flavor has a karate chop of roasted malts and a meaty portion of hops. As my palate adjusts the the intense taste, bittersweet chocolate and espresso come through. There is also that ""something"" that I can't put my finger on. It may be just a spicy hop. The mouthfeel is thick and foamy and slighly astringent. A strong sipper, in my opinion.

Head was nice, thick and quite brown in color. Beer was dark brown to black. Mouthfeel was light but not detractingly so.

Quite nice! There's some roasted character to the aroma, but pine and grapefruit from the hops covered most of this up. In fact, it smelled quite a lot like pine trees. The same happened in the flavour to a lesser extent, with malt becoming more evident as it warmed. Strong hop bitterness. There were hints of semi-sweet chocolate and coffee, along with herbal hops, throughout. The finish really lingered and had a lot of hop flavour and roasted bitterness. Medium bodied and quite dry, there was a bit of slickness and well-integrated carbonation. This is a big, hoppy interpretation of a porter and exactly what I expect from 3F.

Its balanced enough that the high hop levels meld into the roasted malts. Hops do tend to dominate overall. Nice mouthfeel-full bodied and not too dry or sweet in the finish. An extremely drinkable beer. I actually read a recent review in a newspaper column about Xmas beers and the writer stated he didnt remember 3 Floyds beers tasting this good when he lived right near the brewery.

It's as if this beer were served on draft at the brewery. It clearly has benefited from late hop additions and dry hopping. Fresh, fresh , fresh. Somewhat of a subtle touch of sweet molasses aroma. Taste is of warming alcohol and an overwhelming yet delightful dry dark chocolate presence. Lots of bittering hops which linger as an aftertaste which is pleasant nevertheless. Well balanced despite being hop heavy. Chocolate malts back it up adequately. A wonderful seasonal beer. Oh I love this time of the year!!!","cracker","Dec 16, 2005"

Incredibly, the hops go very well with the roastiness. The flavor is sweet at first with caramel and chocolate. Roasted flavors come in at the middle. The finish is bitter, with citrus hops. This beer is probably more hoppy than any porter I've had. Furthermore, the hop flavor melds with the roasty flavors to create a delicious whole. Mouthfeel is medium.

An interesting combination that is not used enough, in my opinion. Alcohol is present in the nose as well. Flavor begins with large malts and roasted grain. Bitter chocolate blends with coffee in a big dark way, reminiscent of a stout. A crescendo of hops begins in the middle, beginning subtly and finishing the flavor with bitter, drying citrous. Roasted grain continues in the finish, but is dominated by an onslaught of prickly hops. Mouthfeel is thick (for the style) and very full, with some hop bite and medium-low carbonation.

Full green hop plants come in the finish. There's a creaminess in there as well but I really get it at the end. This beer went down way, way too smooth. Too good.

Aside from some nice coffee flavors, this wasnt very flavorful in a multi-dimensional way and not much akin to any English ales or porters I can think of. Sure, the hops are there; but the malts were weak and the body and mouthfeel were thin. Especially after drinking some other porters recently, I found this a bit wanting.

The head settled down and would create a nice steady lace throughout the glass. The aroma is a very mild spruce, with burnt malts in the background. The tongue comes across as a cornocopia of dark choocolate, Christmas tree, malts, sweet hops, and smokey goodness. The carbonation is perfect for a porter, enough to know it is there and bring out the flavors, but not too much so that it keeps the flavors from reaching the tongue with fizz.

4.08,-1,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Managed to get a couple of bombers of the Alpha Klaus from my friends at Half Time Beverages, and I was not disappointed. This seasonal porter--they call it a chocolate porter--poured a deep ebony with just enough translucence to reveal the clear, blood red undertone. The head was tall (2 and 1/2 fingers) and toffee/chocolate brown. Not thick frothiness, but sticky. The aroma was a balance of roasted sweet malts and distinct piney hoppiness. This is a hard combination to keep under control, and I was nervous about the taste, but they managed to pull it off. The mouthfeel is medium-thin, and the roasted nuttiness was not cloying. In fact, the sweetness diminshes in the taste--a plus as far as I'm concerned because it enabled the hops to assert themselves appropriately. A slightly bitter finish and, to me, not much chocolate!","longpondbeerman","Jan 17, 2005"

I've been looking forward to this one for quite a bit but I wanted to figure out a good pairing for it, which I think I did. This beer pours out a deep shade of brown, so dark in fact that it might as well be black to the naked eye. Comparison to light reveals those burgandy/brown highlights. Sticky cappacino foam head here that retains very nicely, leaving fat clumps of lace on the glass as I work my way down. The nose on this beer is robust and lovely, chocked full of chocolate, nice mild coffee tones as well. It doesn't step over into imperial stout territory by getting to charred or roasty. I'd call it down right perfect as far as the smell is concerned. Tastes like no other porter I've had, the front is chocolate covered strawberries and coffee beans, nice and chewy with malts through the middle where the ""Alpha"" part of the name becomes apparent. The chewy milk chocolate stays present the whole time while melding with piney and grapefruity hop flavors. Bitterness levels are middling, but the flavor of the hops really shines through while playing nice with the rich and layered flavors of the malts the whole time. Wow, grab this one if you have the chance. I know I'll be snagging it up whenever I see more of it. I paired this with New York Strip steak and frites and doused just about everything in shallot/butter/bleu cheese sauce, and it rocked my world.","FormatKid","Jan 11, 2005"

Lucky for us, it has held up very well :-) Color is dark dark root beer, it had a head to match but it's gone now, just a ring in my glass. Aroma promises all sorts of things, including dark chocolate, make it 60%. Tastewise, one is rewarded with more chocolate notes in the taste, a wider range than found in the aroma. I found the malt to be very prominent, but then the hops hit. The finish is hoppy, but not over the top. I think that's due to the malt being just so present. Solid medium mouthfeel, small fine carbonation. Drinkability is high due to the ease of which this goes down. Bring on this beer!","PatandDavid","Jan 01, 2005"

The exuberence of hops produced a strong spruce/pine note that made one reminice of christmas. The hop character was well balanced by the malty porter back note. A great beer.

As with most of the 3 Floyds I've tried the hops came on strong in the scent of this deep brown to black selection. Pine needles, and roasted chestnuts followed subtley. Strong bittery hops grabbed the senses and clung tightly through the entire drink, never leaving the mouth but balanced throughout with a mild dose of chocolate and the aforementioned pine. After both glasses I was ready for bed. Although 7.5 abv it feels a lot heavier but not as thick or hefty as an Imperial Stout. Good for a porter but a tad too heavy on the hops to increase the numbers on the style.","Ahhdball","Dec 15, 2004"

First let me say I like the idea of a hopped-up sweet porter but the hop combo in this beer is a turn-off. My nose knows and while it poured a great dark color and creamy tan head that had staying power and left lace, this beer smelled off. I am sure I have a good bottle everything was intake and it doesn't tasted oxidized. It reminds me of a fasting beer that has a lot of extra sugar to help tide the monks over. There are plenty of roasty flavor in there but they are beaten to death by the sugar. It is definately drinkable and a rare enjoyment that I thank my fellow BA for this. I could see having one of these in the yuldetide mood, but not anytime soon.","Higravity","Dec 09, 2004"

Pretty good head retention, and a nice amount of lace on the sides of the glass. Smell has a whiff of chocolate, followed by an onslought of piney hops. Big hop aroma. Dry chocolate beginning, with hints of roasty malt, followed by piney and citrusy hops. Kind of like a porter with a Christmas tree in it. Medium body, moderate carbonation. Very raw and unbalanced. The hops seem to be over the top, and take away somewhat from the malt character. Not very sessionable. However, having said that, if there is any time of the year for beers to be over the top, Christmas is the time. I think that is why this works. Festive beer, certainly worth a try.","Bierguy5","Dec 08, 2004"

Bitter chocolate and roasted malt flavor, some black licorice, some mild sweetness, and those hops all bounce back and forth melding towards the end. Body is moderate, thick for a porter. Looks great, smells great, tastes great ... this beer delivers. Very interesing mix of hops and dark malts. I had no idea what I was getting into and I'm just psyched.

The head is still a good size even after I drank the whole glass and all the while putting huge clumps of frothy foam around the glass. This is just perfect to look at it really gets the mouth watering. Aroma is a malty mix of chocolate and caramel with strong roasted coffee presence. Wow the hops are just as strong here with notes of earthy and floral hops coming through all that malt. This is quite a bit to take in and I wasnt sure what to make of it at first but it is amazing. The taste is an amazing blend of fresh hops and chocolate malt with both coming on strong. It took me a while to really take this all in but damn this is good. The hops cut though the strong malt to make themselves known and add a wonderful contrast. Flavor ends on a lingering earthy bitter note. Mouthfeel is about full and quite coating that makes the taste stick with you. This is something I could drink all day, huge malts, huge hops and it blends together wonderfully.

It's very dark brown body rests beneath a frothy head of tan foam that holds well and leaves some nice lace about the glass. It's medium bodied and mildly zesty across the palate. The piney hop character is continued in the flavor, but more balanced by its lightly chocolatey maltiness. It's well-balanced with a solid bitterness, but it's far from overdone; and, as might be expected, it finishes with a flourish of hops. It's not particularily complex, offering little beyond its hops and dark malt combination, but it is quite enjoyable and very drinkable in that sense. Nicely done!","NeroFiddled","Dec 02, 2004"

Initial flavors to this brew start off quite roasty with a slight nutty character to it. But these flavors are quickly overwhelmed by the intense hop flavor that lets you know this isn't your ordinary porter. The hops give off an almost spruce like, piney resiny flavor that mix in the most interesting way with the malts. At first I was a bit overwhelmed but as the brew warmed up a bit, the flavors complemented themselves quite nicely. The finish to this brew is slighty bitter, with the the malts lending a night chocolate roasty finish.

Quite the melting pot you'd like to cook your dinner with. Very direct and dry yet eminently appealing. On the tongue, it's very grassy, reminding me of the Saison from a few hours ago, sweeter than expected with lots of brown sugar, maple and chocolate.

Theres an underlying aroma of roasted malt and hints of cocoa or chocolate. This is definitely not normal. Think a cascade chocolate malt. Body is creamy and smooth. Flavor is most original in my opinion. Almost indesrcribable. Hops are really in the flavor and its taking me some time to get a grip on this brew. Theres a good amount of chocolate malt here giving some cocoa flavors along with the piney citrus hop flavors that are trying to blend. Im not sure whether they really do though. Has some uncomfortable bitterness in the finish. By the way, the alcohol is invisible but slowly kicking in. Overall a very unique seasonal. One I enjoyed, yet one that puzzled me to no end.","BierReise","Dec 14, 2003"
4.31,4.6,5,4,4,4.5,5,"Enjoyed this at its Release Party at the Map Room, courtesy of Nick Floyd. Solid brown body, with a thin, lacy head. Very low alcohol taste, but that's only the perception. Rides the very thin line between chewy and watery mouthfeel like a porter should, but with the addition of the 3 Floyds mouth full of hop pellets effect. Hop effect cant help but overrun the chocolate malt taste. Starts out somewhat grapefruitty, but then hangs around when youve finished to playfully bitch slap your uvula!","DrunkMcDermott","Dec 12, 2003"
4.75,15.3,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"22 oz bottle. Poured a deep brown with reddish highlights, massive tan head that slowly receded, and lots of lacing on the glass. Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, and hops. Taste is more of the same, malty with chocolate and coffee hints. Just as with their Dreadnaught, 3F's know how to use just the right amount of hops to give it that distinctive flavor, without the harsh bitterness. This is one smooth drinking beer. I need to pick me up a few more of these!","Indybeer","Dec 07, 2003"
4.57,10.9,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer disembogues a deep brown to almost black with ruby high lights and the head behemothic in size, spumous in texture and the color a beauteous light tan with the resultant lace a thick sheet welded to the glass to seal it from the light. Marvelous floral aroma at the front, sweet toasted malt, molasses, crisp and a real treat for the schnozzle this one with the start ambrosial and nicely malted, top is middling in its feel to the senses. Finish is temperate in its acidity and the hops puissant in their spiciness, quite dry and long lasting aftertaste. One of the best porters I have had in years, and certainly will move into my porter top ten","Gusler","Sep 27, 2003"

4.4,6.8,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Dark black color. Medium head. Aroma is chocolate malts and floral hops. A medium bodied porter. The roasted chocolate malts are offset by a surprising amount of grapefruity hops. A flavor fest: chocolate, coffee, vanilla, cheery/berries and caramel. Smooth taste. Very well balanced. Soft round taste. Very nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","beerguy101","Jun 12, 2003"
4.3,4.4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"This porter poured jet black with creamy, tan foam that coated the glass a bit. The smell was strong, ""chewy", green hops (floral) with a bit of dark malt. The taste was dominated by the hops but the malt almost balanced with flavors of chocolate, cocoa, and caramel. The mouthfeel was smooth, and relatively sweet and a bit fruity. The body was medium with medium carbonation. This was a very nice porter -- kind of a Porter meets IPA. Very enjoyable as a porter and as a highly hopped ale. This keg had apparently lost much of its spiciness after 7+ months cellaring.","UncleJimbo","Apr 24, 2003"
4.29,4.1,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"bottled by hoprus. Originally sampled on 19 December 2002. Yet another winner from Three Floyds has been poured into my glass. Alpha Klaus has a roasty flavor w/ coffee tones along with hints of cinnamon. It is medium bodied and brown/dark red in color. Very nice","jcalabre","Dec 20, 2002"
