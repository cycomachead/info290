5,19.3,5,5,5,5,5,"This beer is truly a decadent masterpiece and I love it. I've seen a few others picking it apart, but I can't find any faults with it at all. The appearance is a smallish, thick, brown, slow to settle head, some lace, and an opaque black brown black color. Aroma was a volatile chocolate up front, then dark malts, nutmeats, toffee, burnt sugar. Flavor's like nose, in spite of the hype- not over sweet; in fact, nicely bittersweet; just enough tang. Exceedingly well balanced. Body is just perfect for the style with just enough boozy warmth, again to fit this style. An example of genius all around from these guys.","drpimento","Feb 19, 2015"

4.63,10.5,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,"Enjoyed from the 22 oz bomber in a Delirium snifter, this fantastic (porter?!?) imperial stout pours a thick oily black with a dark tan frothy head that slowly dissipates to a thin coating layer and a beautiful ring with frothy clinging lacing.  Nose of rich roasted coffee, thick sweet dark chocolate, moderate booze with warmth, and deeply roasted malts.  Flavors are EXCELLENT.  Coffee and chocolate ganache compete to a strong sweet malt backbone that is not overdone.  Espresso flavors win out in the end and on the aftertaste with a slick, smooth, creamy mouth feel with just the right amount of carbonation and a strong alcohol warmth that makes this a year round fantastic desert imperial stout.  Awesome.  A new standard that will be hard to surpass.","Brutaltruth","Dec 31, 2014"

Oddly, not sweet or sugary in the mouth.  Taste dark, unsweetened chocolate, coffee, roasted malts and sugar - hence the donut name.  Goes down smooth but has a little bitter bite back.  More as the glass warms up.  Good stout but I prefer the Ten Fidy over it as well as Founders Breakfast Stout.  Still, very good.","uvachief","Oct 16, 2014"

The palate is exceptionally creamy rich, combining coffee and chocolate at the front end with glazed doughnut gradually increasing to enter your awareness by the middle to the aftertaste. The beer has just enough roast to balance the doughnut, alcohol and malt flavors. The body is chewy, warming with a little heat on the end along with a touch of espresso coffee roast astringency in the finish. The carbonation is medium low.","pat61","0"

Nice chocolate aroma with bourbon, vanilla, and brown sugar compliments. More chocolate and bourbon in the taste, with a touch of breadiness that could lead to the doughnut classification. Medium to heavy body that carries the flavors perfectly with no noticeable carbonation. If any doughnut comes to mind its a chocolate glazed doughnut, but I was hoping for something along the lines of Mexican cake (relatively). Still fantastic though a touch behind Biscotti break.","Phigg1102","Sep 04, 2014"

The brew smells like roasted malt, bittersweet and milk chocolate, coffee, and some molasses. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some vanilla and doughy/bready malt. But yeah, it tastes like what I imagine a chocolate/coffee doughnut would be. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's coating and creamy with moderate carbonation. The 11.5% ABV is pretty well hidden! I think it's a pretty good overall brew, it's sweet tasting, but not as sweet as I expected it to be. There's a good balance between the sweet and bitter flavors. Definitely worth a try, I wouldn't mind picking up another bottle of this soon.","bluejacket74","Jul 31, 2014"

Aroma of cocoa powder and chocolate syrup, earthy coffee, some roast, a little brown sugar and molasses. Mostly coffee and chocolate. Flavor is super sweet Hershey's syrup up front with a nice earthy coffee bitterness to balance that out. Plenty of roasted grains, some molasses , and then just more sweet chocolate. The coffee makes this drinkable luckily, otherwise it would be quite a mess. Body is thick with low to medium carbonation and a spicy coffee finish. A nice coffee brew but nothing to speak of with respect to donuts here. Just a gimmick on the donuts, but there's no need for that because this is a very good dessert beer.","BMMillsy","Jul 28, 2014"

The head quickly settles out into a sparse surface coating with a more defined halo. Aromas of bitter roasted coffee, cocoa nib, sugar, caked, and baked chocolate cake. Smells are heavy and rich. Flavors are heavily roasted and extremely bitter coffee forward, with a solid dose of baker's chocolate, subtle sugary sweet highlight, cake backbone, and a slight booze highlight with a building warmth at the end of the palate. The body is robust and dry, with a heavily roasted coffee aftertaste. The finish is dry, bitter, and warming. This is a beast. Heavy and robust, through and through.","GarthDanielson","0"

Smooth, easy to drink, there is a good amount of sweetness in this beer but to me it's just regular vanilla and chocolate notes along with bread for a fuller bodied beer and there are some roasted malts in the background that provide balance and a dry finish. I like sweet beers and the sweetness and balance where there so I enjoyed this but had ""donut"" not been in the name it would've just a well-crafted ""regular"" porter.","clayrock81","Apr 11, 2014"

Pours dense pitch black color with a 2 fairly dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, toast, sweet dough, dark bread, toffee, vanilla, cream, light nuttiness, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of coffee and big roast/bready malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, coffee, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, caramel, vanilla, toffee, cream, light char, light nuttiness, and roasted earthiness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, caramel, toast, dark bread, toffee, light char, vanilla, cream, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bready doughnut flavors; with huge robust maltiness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy, smooth, moderately slick, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial porter style. All around great complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/bready malt and coffee flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 09, 2014"

A twirl of the glass leaves lots of legs but little lacing, promising a big, boozy drink. Hell of nose if you have a sweet tooth: massive maple syrup, chocolate frosting, cherry cordial, and vanilla-heavy, oaky bourbon scents. Not a doughnut shop, but a candy factory…one with a Willy Wonka that loved booze. The palate follows suit, a wave of gooey fudge, mocha, and sugar cookie. Bring it all together and you get, yep, a little bit of doughnut; that, plus campfire smoke, toasted oak, and a hint of mint. Finishes with a lingering sugary tone, a rich gourmet dark chocolate sticking thick to the tongue. A sugar rush of a drink, and one hell of a dessert. Cheers!","BarryMFBurton","Apr 08, 2014"

Robust chocolate flavor along with nutty dark roast coffee, moderate bitterness, creamy sweetness, and a glazed, almost pastry-like character. Heavy, creamy body with a tingling finish. Sweet, as expected, yet not way over the top which it could easily have been. I haven’t had this in the bottle, but there is definitely something “cakey” going on in both smell and taste coming from the tap. This makes for a unique experience that I rather enjoyed, though I would never try to drink a whole bomber by myself. As far as harnessing the mighty power of the donut, without letting things get too crazy, I'd call it a success.","wedge","Feb 16, 2014"

Like I said, had the name of the beer not been ""Imperial Doughnut Break", I wouldn't guess that doughnuts were used. There is definitely a doughy flavor, but I'd not pinpoint it. It's a nice beer that I'd have again, but it's hard to justify the price here.

Mouthfeel is great and so is the drinkability for an 11.5% brew. Don't get a whole lot of donut in this one, just sort of a minor, sweet doughy overtone. And half of that is probably the power of suggestion. If I tasted this blind I doubt I would have picked it out, it's that subtle. Still delicious, just a little bummed that I'm not drinking alcoholic liquid donuts.","Dope","Jan 29, 2014"

4.24,1.2,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Poured into a Reuben's Brew snifter. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing black in the glass, with a thin light brown head with good retention with light lacing. Nice aroma of chocolate and dark toasty malt, very much like a high quality dark chocolate donut. Flavor also emphasizes chocolate, with a definate cake like element; baker's yeast. Chocolate glaze, eggy brownies, vanilla, hints of coffee. Complex, but in the chocolate / cocoa universe. Good medium creamy body. A flavorful, chocolate forward imperial stout that is very nicely integrated. It may just be the power of suggestion, but I did detect cake donut flavors in this stout. Creamy and rich, this is a great addition to an already well loved series of stouts. ABV completely and dangerously covered. Donut.","LiquidAmber","Jan 23, 2014"

It would have been even better had the alcohol not been as present on the finish, and the nose could have been much more aromatic. Not anywhere near the gluttonous level of Mornin' Delight or Dark Lord for example. And the body is a little light for the offering, need even more creaminess, heft, and stickiness for something that is supposed to be so gluttonous. Still, I am thoroughly impressed by the execution of this glazed doughnut imperial stout. Seek. This. Out!","Pintofbrown","Jan 23, 2014"
4.52,7.9,5,4.25,4.5,5,4.5,"This one pours a full bodied midnight black with a two finger dark mocha head. It looks like you'd want a beer of this size. This nose is big and rich. There is smooth roast, light coffee, and sweet chocolate glazed doughnut. I was skeptical about doughnut character being present in the nose but there actually is chocolate doughnut. The flavors are very well integrated. It drinks like a liquid chocolate glazed doughnut with a touch of roast. There isn't any alcohol presence whatsoever. It's delicious. The body is perfect. It's big and so smooth. Overall I think this is fantastic. I enjoyed this just as much as the Biscotti, if not more.","aasher","Jan 23, 2014"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, doughnuts, dark fruit, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, dark fruit, sweet alcohol, and (you guessed it) doughnuts. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I was a massive fan of the base brew for this one if I am honest. The addition of doughnuts really took it to a new level. This note of sweetness really binded every other aspect going on in the base brew and enhanced it for my palate. I really am glad I got the chance to try this one and plan to make my own version in my glass next time I have an Imperial Biscotti Break. Just sayin'.","thagr81us","Beers"
