A chocolate fudge punch to the palate and wonderful aromas to boot. Not high in alcohol so you can certainly session out on this. Light body doesn't fill you up. I took a girl out to World of Beer and she got this and I opted for the Brooklyn Blast!. Granted, I really enjoyed the Blast! but I had some beer envy when I tried hers. I had to seek it out and luckily I remembered seeing it at a local store. I'll probably buy their last two six packs.","Extol","Mar 07, 2015"

Low hop profile, but some floral notes offset the richness. Some roasty bitterness also emerges.  Even and full mouthfeel, creamy and rich.

The nose comprises cocoa powder, mild roasted malts, and a hint of coffee.  The taste brings in more of the same, along with a nice twinge of graham cracker.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, this beer delivers exactly what it promises: a chocolate-laced porter.  It's nothing mind-blowing, but I would definitely have another.","TMoney2591","Nov 30, 2014"

4,0.3,,,,,,"Had this originally on Nitro line at Gingerman in South Norwalk. It had a fantastic nose of chocolate, toasted malt and the sweetness smell that ice cream has. It drank incredibly smooth and had a well balance to it. Now pouring it out of a 12 oz bottle, it has a more bitter smell to it and doesn't smell nearly as sweet or malty. Upon drinking it, it is way more bitter, less smooth and creamy, the malt presence gets lost a bit as well. I recommend having this if you ever see it on nitro line, but I would not buy it again in a bottle.","Randallnh26","Oct 12, 2014"

The beer looks very inviting with a thick, lasting foam and the aroma is pleasantly ripe with milk chocolate and some light roasty notes. This beer is more chocolate milk than shake, because of the thin body, but it's got a great milk chocolate flavor that makes you forget about the weakish mouthfeel.

This beer was a standard looking porter, though more frothy (like a nitro). Head was very silky and creamy, only a couple millimeters thick. The amount of chocolate, both in the nose and the middle of this beer was staggering. Very dark chocolately. The bitterness was mild, and mostly from the toasted burnt caramelized barley flavor and the bitter chocolate that came through. Alcohol was hardly noticeable at all, and the mouthfeel was very creamy. Not a whole lot of carbonation. Thick layer of lacing on the glass all the way at the very end.","cambabeer","Aug 13, 2014"

I got more of a watery chocolate taste, although it was very smooth, and most notably, far more crisp than your average porter. I do not know if this is due in part to the nitrogen, as I am admittedly new to that genre of dark beer. All said and done, per my own taste, I would not order this beer again.","Jonbearr","Jul 01, 2014"

4.08,2.3,4.25,4.25,4,4,4,"Poured on-tap and served in a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, brown-to-black coloring with a dense, creamy, half inch, cream colored head. Beautiful. Aromas of rich milk chocolate, smooth and sweet, with subtle cream highlights. Smells amazing! Flavors are smooth, with a chocolate milk forward characteristic, mostly sweet, with only hints of bitter and roast. This is like a great glass of chocolate milk. Wow! Smooth and light in mouth, with a light cream and chocolate aftertaste. Lactose linger, with a bittersweet chocolate underlay, in an otherwise smooth finish. Bravo!","GarthDanielson","0"

4.07,2,4.5,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Pretty much a black colored brew, more so than most porters. The tan head is thick and sturdy and leaves a firm coating of lace. The aroma is pretty darn nice with deep milk chocolate that almost turns to an evergreen malt burst it's so enticing. The flavor is similar but becomes a little more bitter and less of the creamy sweet chocolate that the aroma suggests. The feel is also a little thinner, somewhat aqueous, as compared to the expectations that the aroma conjured. But once you get past expectations the flavor does satisfy the chocolate lover's desire for cocoa flavor and it has a curious grassy, nearly charcoal edge that smooths out after a few tastes. It's solidly medium bodied and seems to gain a creamier feel as you get to the end. Overall, very pleasing.","Durge","Mar 31, 2014"

It tastes like milk chocolate with a good helping of vanilla and finishes with a slight bitterness like you would get from dark chocolate. I'm typically weary of nitro tapping and think that it often detracts from the quality of a beer, but in this case nitro carbonation is the perfect complement: it gives the beer a velvety mouthfeel that works with the rich flavors to produce a chocolate milkshake experience.","itsscience","0"

The aroma is the stand out with this beer though, as it really smells like, like I said, a caramel mocha latte -- almost exactly. Would make a great candle. There's a good flavor here, but I wouldn't want more than a couple just because the caramel chocolate flavor I pull out of it would get old fairly quickly.

Sweetness, a touch of herbaly hop bitterness and a lingering earthy finish, coffe and cocoa powder. Quite good, not what I expected.

Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good chocolate porter. Good robustness and balance of malt and cocoa nib flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 26, 2014"

Served in a shaker, a dark brown-black pour, thick creamy tan head that evolved from a luscious cascade; full retention right to the end and blankets of lacing on the glass. Aroma of cocoa, dark malts, cream. Flavors of bittersweet chocolate and cream, mildly roasty, with some light herbal tea in the finish. Nothing overly complex going on, but just a solid and damn tasty porter overall. Thanks to the nitro, the body was full, the mouthfeel silky and smooth. Quite enjoyable. I wouldn't recommend a bottle based on other reviews, but if you see it on nitro, give it a try!","Rifugium","Jan 13, 2014"

Not as well balanced as the nose suggests with a much stronger, slightly acrid burnt malt presence that lingers over the sweeter notes into a very dry finish. Smokey with hints of ash, burnt toast and charred wood along with bittersweet dark chocolate, oatmeal and spent coffee grinds. There's some lighter malt sweetness toward the end of the palate with hints of milk chocolate, hazelnut and caramel but everything us overwhelmed by the heavy roast. The light mouthfeel and subtle sweetness help drinkability but thus beer is too one dimensional and overly roasted for my preference.","corby112","Dec 18, 2013"

Flavors just work, creamy toffee, bitterness from the cocoa nibs, again very soft creamy texture I would have guessed oatmeal, the label doesn't mention that but they do use chocolate wheat. It's a more drinkable version of something like Southern Tier Choklat, I can only do 4 ounces of that one, this one however, I could throwback at least two or three bottles. The powdered cocoa, and cocoa nib additions really help balance the sweetness, finishes semi dry in the end, well brewed masterfully done , medium bodied I'm guessing they're comparing it to a malty shoppe chocolate shape it's that creamy and dessert like.

3.96,-0.8,3.75,4,4,4.25,3.75,"This beer is a dark, almost blackish, brown color. It is capped with a tan head and the liquid has reddish hues when held to the light. The smell is malty, with lots of chocolate overtones. Nutty, with subdued roastiness. There is a sweet and toasted smell to the beer. Think of Nutella on very toasted homemade bread. The taste is moderately sweet, with some mid-taste bitterness to even things out. Somewhat abrupt finish, but lots of chocolate flavor. Full in body, and a thick, smoothness to the mouthfeel. Very good.","Suds","Nov 07, 2013"
3.95,-1,3.5,4,4,3.75,4,"best thing ive had from boulder beer maybe ever. looks thin and translucent from the bottle, but amounts to a pretty dense chocolate brown liquid in my globe with just less than an inch of soapy off white head. I wish it stayed heady longer, more cream, more sex appeal, but it is what it is. smells really chocolaty, which I adore. cocoa powder and melted milk chocolate are both present. nice medium roast malt base, slightly sweet, but bitter enough to balance the chocolate. very pleasant, not over the top at all. the flavor is a mix of so many chocolates. dark and white chocolate both flash in here, buttery and soft, distinctly flavored, long wintery finish. its warming in a comforting way, not an alcoholic one. I bought a single because I thought six would bee to much, but I am regretting that choice now. this is highly drinkable, and it is the perfect season for beer like this. I am most impressed by the way the various chocolate layers are woven into a porter that would be excellent as a standalone. I will be drinking plenty of this in the coming months.","StonedTrippin","Nov 07, 2013"

The chocolate is very heavy on this and one bottle was enough for me but this was a pretty solid beer.","ArrogantB","Nov 04, 2013"

4.03,1,4,4,4,4.25,4,"O: A very well put together chocolate porter. A medley of different grains provide depth and complexity. The chocolate, while very much the focal point of the beer, lets up just enough to allow the rest of the beer to shine through. This is one of those rare beers that provides a simple hedonistic drinking pleasure, but is also multi-faceted and complex enough to allow the drinker to dissect and think about it more if he or she so chooses. I've never really been wowed by anything Boulder Beer has done, but I can respect the hell out of this effort. Damn good stuff.","ryan1788a5","Nov 02, 2013"

I almost wanted to chug it down like a shake I was that ready for it, but I restrained myself. It's not too heavy and not too light, so it's a nice change from the more robust porters I've had in the past. What it lacks in complexity it makes up for in its taste and smell.","quakeroatmealstout","Oct 24, 2013"
