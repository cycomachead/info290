Aromas of roast, chocolate, coffee, caramel and toffee all leaped from the snifter and into my nostrils leaving me very happy and ready for a sip. To the taste there was chocolate, coffee/espresso, lovely roast, brown sugar and a malty caramel/toffee sweetness. Had a medium body but very drinkable with a clean finish, just excellent execution across the board here. One of my favorite porters, and one I find myself recommending time and time again.","BrewChatKen","Oct 28, 2014"

Tastes flat to me - some caramel malt, minimal roasted malt and an odd cloying aftertaste that seems to get stuck on my palate. Low to medium mouthfeel and low carbonation. I don't get the love for this beer - it doesn't have the roasted malt and coffee flavors that I look for in a good porter. No biggie - glad I have access to both Founders Porter and GL Eddie Fitz.","bound4er","Oct 20, 2014"

But, it's tough to play it both ways.  Sometimes the imposing flavor that gives other porters the unique character is exactly what makes those porters less drinkable over the long haul.  The Bros are right, this is a great beer; it's the kind of porter that is a refrigerator staple.  Porters inherently have character, and this one finds a very nice balance all the way around; if you like dark beers, you can drink this one all day, every day, all year long.  It is extremely well-crafted.","Gregg03","Sep 12, 2014"

Easily a top three (maybe four) Porter for me... clearly up there with the ""big boys."" The taste is all over (in a VERY GOOD sense) with roast, char, chocolate, coffee, and a tinge of dark fruits. The feel is basically spot-on for the style. Medium sort of body which suits the style and ABV, and then a pretty prickly carbonation as well. An incredibly tasty, easy drinking porter that I wish could be had in Michigan. I like this more than Edmund Fitzgerald, to be honest. A must-try for fans of the style. Only fault I have with this beer is that it doesn't have a lasting head and lacing that I'd ideally like, but that's a super minor fault on a fabulous brew.","Alextricity","Jul 25, 2014"

The hops taste blend with roasted malt and coffee/chocolate undertones taking the taste buds on a wild ride. Also noted is a hint of citrus with the swallow. Im not a huge fan of porters, so I probably would not buy this in a six pack; however, if I was out and this beer was on the menu I would be excited to order. Great complex beer, and great porter with a slightly different angle.","MMaxim11","Jun 28, 2014"

My first reaction to smelling it was ""why does this smell like blue moon?"" And then i tasted it, and it TASTED like blue moon. Okay, it tastes better than blue moon, but very similar. So why do they call it a porter when it smells and tastes like a generic wheat ale? Another example of dumbing down a style of beer simply for mass appeal. It's obvious. I was not happy that this beer tasted nothing like a porter, and the feel, even less like a porter. It doesn't stick in your mouth, the now all too common hints of coffee are not executed properly, and it's just common in taste. Had this beer been labeled as a wheat ale, i would give it a higher rating, because i do not respect this beer as a porter and believe that it should not be called one.","SlyBanter","Mar 01, 2014"

4.55,8.9,4.25,4.75,4.5,5,4.25,"I was anxious to get started, so I went with a heavy-handed aggro pour. This set up a pseudo-cascade that eventually settled into three fingers of dense, light-tan head that was steadily offgassing. Color was a deep, dark-brown with ruby highlights at the edges (SRM = 44). Nose had a roasty, dark chocolate quality along with a light smokiness. I always think of my late Pops' affinity for Hershey's Special Dark chocolate when I encounter such beers. I would eschew them in favor of sweeter stuff as a kid, but now I gravitate towards bitter or semi-sweet. Mouthfeel was big and creamy, like a scoop of ice cream on the tongue. The flavor was very chocolaty, but dark and roasty at the same time. Man, no wonder this is so highly rated! American Porters can be all over the map, but this was straight-on porter, not bbl.-aged or with wild adjuncts that meld into the style nicely, but get in the way of the base flavors. I have really enjoyed the flavors in this beer to the point that half of it is already gone and without my realizing it! Finish was semi-dry, with the smokiness really taking the edge off of the sweetness at the beginning. I will now dedicate this review to Mom-Za, who lives in Chico (Butte County), California.","woodychandler","Feb 23, 2014"

3.97,-5,4,3.75,4,4.25,4,"According to the label this dark brew is one of Deschutes' old standbys, but a fairly new addition to the lineup here in Alberta. Please keep 'em coming guys. Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, a brownish black beer grading toward pitch black with some orange-red highlights. Certainly has that old school classic porter look. Aroma is initially bright and fruity, raisins and a whiff of rummy booze, along with scanty citrus hops. The first sip is less sweet than the aroma would suggest. Has that tangy ""sour"" acidic note that one expects in well-brewed porters, more common in English examples but more than welcome here. Quite dry, flinty, and chalky, with cold strong coffee and charcoal dominant on the palate. Some barley sugar, cacao powder, smoke, and bitter nuts (walnut?) do appear but these facets are low-key. Not particularly fruity. Where this one really stands out is in the mouthfeel. Wickedly creamy and silky smooth, minimally carbonated and coats the mouth a little. This can go down the hatch dangerously quickly despite the rich roasted malts predominating. If you like your porters uber-dark, dry and bitter, but exceptionally smooth, here's your beer.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 19, 2014"

Taste follows nose with a sweet, iced coffee flavor followed by milk chocolate, raisins, figs, ending with a citrus hop bitterness. Soft carbonation with a creamy almost nitro mouthfeel. A coffee lovers beer, totally delicious. No wonder this is Joe Rogans favorite beer.","Aaron_Ramson","Nov 30, 2013"

Its topped off with a nice thick tan head that simply says,” Go ahead and drink me, I’m easy...but not diseasy!” It’s billowy and very creamy all roped together by a thin lacing. The aroma is nothing short of heaven, its sweet and filled with mild roasted malts and plenty of chocolate smells all highlight by some gentle coffee undertones. Oh yeah, and there’s hint of brown sugar too. Sharp and light at first, it swarms up and thicken as it moves down your throat. Its light to medium bodied, the flavors really kick in as it nears the middle of your tongue, the bitterness fades away and the sweetness become more prevalent. It’s pretty well balanced in my opinion; the bitterness in front, the chocolates and roasted coffee in the middle and mild sweet sugars and malts in the aftertaste. This is a very drinkable porter, I might like it a bit thicker but I have nothing against this fine porter.","vickersspitfire","Jul 22, 2013"

The overwhelming impression is this porter is exceedingly smooth in texture, as silky as I've ever had frankly and has a nice dark chocolate/cherry taste, without being sweet. I've had some amazing porters from Great Lakes, Founders, Bells and Three Floyds, but this one is unique in mouthfeel, pretty special porter.","DAllspaw","Jul 12, 2013"

I found myself enjoying each sip more and more, and before I knew it, I was ready to order another! Its low alcohol content and medium body keeps this one relatively light and very, very sessionable! I can't help but consider this one of my favorite brews (of any style) to date. I can definitely see me sessioning with this beauty in the future.","ThePaintedGrey","Jul 10, 2013"

It is impossible--as you can see--not to compare this bad boy with Deschutes' Obsidian Stout, and while it may not reach those levels, what should be realized is that it does not have those ambitions. Creamy, complex, and perfectly dark, with an out of this world wow factor, this is a world-class porter made by what I'm coming to realize is a world-class brewery. For just over 7 bucks a sixer, it's hard to beat a session of these.","The_Mancannon_of_Slothrop","Jul 05, 2013"

This staple beer is a nicely complex porter with a creamy mouthfeel that I don't get in most of the local porters in WI. It reminds me of O'so Night Train Porter but ends up being creamier and bringing some more complexity in flavour. Definitely worth the while and if I can choose a representative porter to be a fridge staple, it would probably be this one. (5)","Stevedore","Feb 19, 2013"

Tastes are chocolate, but barely roasted, nice balance of sweetness and bitterness, coffee and nut in there too. Mouth-feel is creamy & velvety smooth; nice carbonation.

I'd have it rated higher but I don't get any of the chocolate finish claimed on the bottle, its a mild malt and hoppy character. It's pleasant but not surprising.

Poured a dark brown color, produced an outstanding tan head, featured excellent retention and some of the best lacing I have ever seen. The aroma contained sweet milk chocolate, roasted malt and some earthy hops. Full bodied, the first thing that hits you before even the taste does, is how smooth and creamy this beer is- A foundation of roasted grain, some chocolate, and coffee flavor to boot. The finish is semi dry with floral hops and alcohol as you swallow. Hands down, the best Porter I have ever tried.","GossageBrewery","Oct 05, 2012"

4.05,-3.1,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Black Butte Porter pours almost solid black, with just a few faint ruby highlights shining through. There's maybe two fingers of khaki colored foam capping the beer. Head retention is solid, if unspectacular, and lacing is a bit on the spotty side. The nose is highlighted by roasty dark chocolate. There's also a fairly noticeable coffee aroma present. The flavor is redolent of those same two, with coffee pulling a little closer to chocolate in terms of intensity. There's also a light bitterness, and a gentle, herbal hop finish. The body is a little bit surprising in how relatively dry it is. There's a little bit of sturdiness to support all the malt flavor, but it's very much light and lean for the style. I kind of like it though, makes the beer way more quaffable than porters tend to be. This is aided by the fact that the carbonation is well adjusted to still largely stay out of the way, adding just a little bit of life to the proceedings. There's nothing really fancy about Black Butte Porter, it's just a classic, well executed porter, and a beer I'd love to have available in my area.","axeman9182","Aug 16, 2012"

The hop note of this beer is a perfect touch, only taming the malts somewhat to make it a wonderfully approachable dark beer. Two thumbs up, malt, stout, porter fans should definitely get some, you can thank me later.","ZachStone625","Aug 11, 2012"

This one pours a very dark opaque brown from the bottle, turning completely black as it accumulates in the glass. Great coffee and chocolate aroma, with some beautiful roastiness wafting up from my glass. Flavor is a coffee explosion, earthy, with a beautiful backdrop of roasty bittersweet chocolate. Full body with adequate carbonation--nearly feels like an imperial porter. Finishes clean. Nearly perfect for the style. All others get compared to this.","BMMillsy","May 23, 2012"

4.15,-0.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"On tap at Dante’s in U district. Poured into a pint glass. Appearance is dark, almost black with a finger of light tan head. Ends up with a very pretty lacing. Aroma is smokey and malty, a bit more simple than regular stouts, but still has some things going on. The taste isn’t a surprise from the smell. Slightly bitter. Burnt and crispy. Coffee hits very strong near the end. Palate is a bit less viscous than I would like, but I guess that’s why it’s a porter. Overall, I’m glad they have this at Dante’s.

Overall this beer is a winner, would love to be able to have this regularly.","gabedivision","Jan 06, 2012"

4.28,2.4,4.5,4,4,4.5,5,"Poured a deep brown with some mahogany highlights, clear body with a dense, yet very light tan head. A couple of fingers of head, leaves a wall of lacing solid retention. Nose has some rich milk chocolate, with a bit of bitterness, a touch of roast, some lactic notes and hops. Taste has a light sourness to start, which opens up into some chocolate, gentle coffee and roast. A bit of caramel and warm dark malt notes, leave a lightly bitter finish. Kinda sweet as well. Low carbonation and medium body, that's a bit cream and balanced. Flavourful and subtle, a very well done porter - something to be revisited several pints over.","liamt07","Jan 03, 2012"

Smells rich and complex; earthiness, floral notes, hops, coffee, chocolate malt... very nice. Taste is an absolute flavor bonanza of malted chocolate, fresh ground coffee, faint grassiness, and lively yet subtle hop finish. Slightly viscous on the palate, yet goes down so so easy. This is a unique porter, and the best of the style that I've had.","gregb13","Nov 10, 2011"
4.38,4.8,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"definitely the best porter i have ever had, been my go to since i move to colorado in august. pours apparently black, but when held up to the light has a low red glow. nice 1.5 inch head that leaves good lacing on the glass. smells dry like an irish stout, chocolate malts no doubt, but not heavy in the nose. taste is not dry at all, rich and creamy with a finish that is just ever so slightly bitter from the hop additions. mouthfeel is creamy and on the bigger side of medium bodied. i could drink a 6er of this every day for the next 50 years, just complex but understandable, like a magician showing you the secrets. an epic epic porter","StonedTrippin","Nov 09, 2011"

3.94,-5.7,3,4,4,3,4.5,"Notes: Decent roast, nice complementary flavors and complexity. Very drinkable, especially for a porter that has intense flavors, but that’s partly because its only medium bodied. Hops are present but delicate. It has the potential for something special but only almost there. Really good nonetheless, and for the price it’s a serious value.","4000qtrap","Oct 16, 2011"
3.85,-7.9,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Still, the taste is a bit flat overall. The malty bitterness just hangs on my palate and doesn't do much.

4.32,3.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Black Butte pours out a deep dark brown with a lightly chocolate colored head on top. The head retention is exceptionally nice and I found a decent amount of lacing on the glass throughout the tasting. The smell of this beer is deeply roasty with a great deal of dark chocolate and some light coffee and alcohol notes in the back. The taste of the beer is similarly chocolatety and is paired with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. There's also a slight amount of hop bitterness on the back on the tongue on the swallow, but it's not an off-putting amount. Overall, this is a great classic porter.","jmvecchio1","Oct 10, 2011"

3.88,-7.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"O: As always, a great porter. Bottles down in SoCal have been hit and miss as of late, due to freshness, and this beer fades in the bottle after a few months... So, sadly, sometimes a ""on the shelf"" buy results in a lackluster taste. Here on draft, this is fresh, and reminds me how much I like this porter.","Retsinis","Oct 05, 2011"
4.37,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Very, very good porter. One of the better ones I've had, honestly. Full of character, but not too heavy in any one characteristic, so it keeps it interesting and fresh.","NODAK","Oct 04, 2011"

4.05,-3.1,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall this is the best standard American Porter on the planet. I have had their reserve/anniversary series amped up porters and I can appreciate how this base recipe was used to inspire those big massive gems.

2.74,-34.4,4,2.5,3,2,2.5,"Poured from a 32 oz. growler into a pint glass. Poured straight down the middle of the glass, beer gives about 3"" of solid head. Pretty much downhill from there. The smell is nearly completely muted. Outside of carbonation and some malt, there's really nothing there. The taste to me is pretty bland. There's not a whole helluva lot going on here. Again, I don't detect too many distinct flavor profiles. Some hints of coffee, toasted malt. The mouthfeel is where this bottoms out. It's highly carbonated, and extremely astringent. There's absolutely no joy behind having this in your mouth. I'm wondering if Black Butte XXIII is anything like this. I hope to hell not.","Retail1LO","Sep 10, 2011"
4.66,11.5,5,4,5,5,4.5,"great porter, one I would not mind having a six of during a sunday, although im sure the bootles pale in comparison to this tap serving. Butte deserves more chatter in beer circles like Edmund and Founders porter get.","BARFLYB","Sep 10, 2011"

A small bit of lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of big caramel, roasted malt, dark fruits, chocolate, and vanilla. Decent aromas with decent strength. Taste of tons of roasted malt, caramel, chocolate, bitter coffee, and some vanilla. Decent amount of bitterness on the finish that lingers with chocolate, coffee, and roasted flavors. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a nice creamy and smooth mouthfeel. A small amount of prickliness from the carbonation, but does not detract from the mouthfeel. Very smooth and easy drinking. No alcohol noticed in the taste or finish as expected. Overall, a very nice porter; my first from Deschutes as well.","superspak","Aug 21, 2011"

4.7,12.4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Black Butte Porter is a black bodied brew; when held to the light, the bottom of the glass shines amber, but the rest remains opaque. Topping it off is a medium sized tan head, which populates the glass with a nice sheet of lacing. The nose is a big and bold chocolate and roasted malt scent, maybe just a slight touch of coffee and hop as well. Wow, the taste is very large. Rich malt profile, with a caramel start, quickly supplanted by a chocolate essense and followed by a subtle and refined roasted malt finish. Winds up incorporating some fruit tones, just a touch of coffee, a fair amount of honey, the hops are nice and floral. Nice smooth and creamy, medium bodied mouth.","Tballz420","Aug 19, 2011"

Tastes much more chocolate upfront with roast complimenting it quite well and a bit of some acrid taste that is nice and subtle. Feels medium bodied, maybe even a little light given its dark complexity. Overall, an excellent beer.

Taste well balanced between the sweet and roasty, neither overpowers. Solid notes of milk chocolate and some dark fruit appear before a kiss of earth and a quickly splash of citrus.

It gives a pleasant drinking experience through and through. The only fault I could find was the poor head retention, but it excels so much in every other department that it's easy to forget(and this coming from someone who loves a deep head).

4.2,0.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall - Overall a very nice porter. The first time I had this I was actually pretty blown away. At the time I had not been much into dark beers at all and it was really a wake up call that there were so many other, different things out there that I might enjoy besides Pale Ales and IPAs, etc. Maybe I'm partial because Black Butte Porter brings back fond memories of good friends and simpler times. Maybe I'm partial to beers from the PNW, my future home. Maybe I'm partial because I love XXI so much. Maybe Black Butte Porter is just a very good example of the style, up there with the likes of Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald. You be the judge.","matttttYCE","Jul 29, 2011"

The flavor is heavily dominated by roasted malts, but the beer also offers some complexity with notes of chocolate, molasses, nuts, fruit (prune?) and nice balance of hops in the finish. This is actually a very nice beer; even though it’s dark, it’s fairly light bodied and very drinkable.

4,-4.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Deschuttes Black Butte Porter is a beer that I will always order if I find it on draft. However, it was only briefly available last year during Philly Beer Week here in Philadelphia and since then I've only had it when traveling or from trades. This is a very dark brown beer with a beautiful khaki head that slowly dissipates while leaving lacy draping foam on the sides of the glass as you drink it. The beer smells and tastes roasty but without the astringent burnt flavors. There is a nice grainy, almost nutty malt flavor but there is very little residual sweetness and great balance. A very good example of the style. I would prefer a bit more toasted malt and chocolate but other than that not much more to complain about.","Soonami","May 18, 2011"

3.76,-10,4,3,4,4,4,"12 oz. bottle with clearly-marked freshness date. Brewed with chocolate and crystal malts, hopped to 30 IBUs and kraeusened for conditioning. Pours nearly completely black, clear, with reddish edges and a thin tan head that attempts to lace. Somewhat tame bouquet contributes dark malts, light fruit and perhaps some hops. Tastes of dark chocolate, mild roast, licorice, fruit, and hops that contribute a moderate bitterness. Well-balanced, and it starts light and tingly, dry with a quick finish, but fills out and has a more roasty linger when warmer. Not too bad, but there is a pervasive rubbery note that makes me think ""autolysis."" Other than that, certainly a nice porter, but I must say I prefer their stout.","mmmbeer","Feb 15, 2011"

Aroma begins with lightly roasted malts and ends with heavily roasted malts. Taste of enormous dark malts (for a 5.2% ABV), touch of smoke and coffee, finishing with toffee. As the beer descends down the glass, vanilla hits the nose, and possibly some oak, but it could possibly be the excellent malt profile tricking me.

Aromas are an enjoyable, smooth roasted malt and hints of chocolate. Flavors are of bitter chocolate, touch of coffee, with a little bit of hops in the finish. Definately not an ""over the top"" version, which has become more the norm, but a very classic well done porter with all the flavors and the texture you would expect.

Very drinkable, nothing offensive with this beer. Taste is a little disappointing as well, all the flavors are there - the roasted malts, the coffee, the hint of chocolate, but it didn't hit me the way I thought it would.

There is a hint of smoke to the coffee and caramel flavorings that really makes this a pretty darn good beer.

Taste is better than the nose but with similar flavors. While this is an excellent session porter, I cant give it world class marks that you find in more complex offerings.

Mouthfeel is medium/light bodied with spot on carbonation. This is almost like a more flavorful Guinness to me. Only slightly bitter and a somewhat subdued malt give it a taste that is predominately dark chocolate with a smoky malt finish.

The nose wisely chooses steady penetration rather than brute force, roasted coffee and bittersweet dark chocolate, blanched nuts, tar and earth, celery root, close to herbaceous at times, very little discernible fruit or citrus scents, maybe a drop of anise. Full-bodied, muscular and layered, more interested in posing fully flexed than displaying any fluid movement. The coffee roast, carob, dark chocolate still going on, maybe maple syrup or corn syrup. Here you get an interesting mineral water aspect which dries things out and focuses the aforementioned flavors, the mouth feel has some turbulence. Red apple, cherry, apricot fruit breaks the surface now and then. Muttered suggestion of orange peel.

Aromatics contain dark cocoa and mild coffee with hints of sweet and mildly tart fruits. Flavor is upfront with a cherry plum sweetness that fades ino the background with a mild smokey charred hint of dark roasts. Dark roasts give some dry dark chocolate and coffee roasted qualities to it all, I'm impressed by the all around balance slight herbal hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied pretty dry overall but a complex beer that builds layers with each sip, a nice drying finish.

The smell is loaded with roasted malts and dark coffees, with a very faint hint of licorice hiding in the brush. The taste follows, with that licorice absent and a nice, smoky woodiness pops up, bringing an extra leyer of complexity to the proceedings. The body is a bit on the heavy side, and the carbonation gives an odd bite at the end, and these, when combined, serve to lessen the overall drinkability here.

Black Butte is closer to a brown ale than a stout and it doesn't hit the porter bullseye that I so appreciate in great porters such as Boulevard Bully! Porter, Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald, Sierra Nevada Porter and Odell Cutthroat Porter. Which makes it all the more surprising to me that I like Black Butte.

Smells of milky smooth chocolate, a bit of coffee and I get hints of hot chili as well (If you've ever tried chili chocolate, you know what I mean - delicious and so enticing!). Taste is nice and roasty with the malts showing through. Then, notes of coffee and dark chocolate come through (not overly strong) with a touch of minerality that cleans up the palate. It's on the finish that the chocolate really begins to come through finishing off with a really enjoyable chili-chocolate, spicy tingle and some bitter hops in the background. Mouthfeel is full bodied, quite creamy but with a spicy, tingly finish that really makes it feel clean and surprisingly refreshing. Overall, this is a killer and very sessionable porter that has some nice flavour complexity but doesn't overpower the palate. I could see myself drinking a ton of these - no problem.

A little bitterness is perceived but finishes with just a touch of sweetness. A little ash on the finish as well. Medium body but the carbonation is a little pricky and agressive.

3.88,-7.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"I like the XX and XXI so much more than this ""base"" beer that they've doubled. Not a bad beer, just not quite robust for me. Interestingly, this beer shares some of the same ashy notes that are found in some of the larger dark beers from Deschutes including the above mentioned and the Abyss. Kind of a house character. Pours a dark walnut brown with a thick, tam, pancake head. Smells light and roasty, and a touch ashy. The taste is a bit more robust than the smell, with some sweet malt, licorice, light roastiness and an ashy finish. Even for an American Porter this is quite dry, and not very hoppy at all. Solid beer, but I like my Porters either slightly less dry or slightly more robust. I don't mind the ashiness, but I think it works better with a little more body.","Georgiabeer","Aug 10, 2009"

Whiffs of black malt on the nose, but not in a harsh way, inviting like a black coffee, if you are into that sort of thing. But this is has more flavor and creaminess packed into it than I would have thought possible for a ""basic"" strength porter. Loads of rich dark malt, hints at chocolate without being overpoweringly so. Tons of flavor, but the richness doesn't come with a harsh bit to it.

In the glass it looked black and slick. It had a very subtle aroma that may throw you off, because after first drink I was amazed at how complex this beer was. I will have to have again to peg down specific tastes. In general it was malty and felt creamy on the tongue. It was refreshing and strong. It had a very crisp finish.

Poured into an imperial pint glass, this porter is a robust cocoa brown color, a shade shy of black, with orange-ruby highlights. Head is moderate, velvety and tan. There's a wonderful dry roasted grain aroma immediately evident on the nose. Inhale deeper and you'll get chocolate powder and some funk.Wonderfully balanced flavors consisting of chocolate, burnt angelfood cake, almonds, fig and cedar in the taste department. Hops provide a nice bittering counterpoint and just the slightest hint of citrus zest. Fantastic mouthfeel and nicely drawn out finish of caramel and chocolatyness and lactic acid. Very drinkable.

The taste expands upon the aroma, with that hint of coffee being well balanced by the rest of the malt. As you would expect, this is a full bodied, well rounded brew. This beer has the utmost drinkability, one could (and I have) spend hours at your local watering hole enjoying this toasted delight.

The smell was dominated by smoked malts, and it was strong and rich. I could just picture in my mind the malts being roasted over an open fire. The taste was a delicious balance of the malty and the bitter. The malty: thick chocolate malt flavor, which was as smokey as the smell would leave me to believe. The bitter: there was definitely a bitter hop presence to round off the taste, but there was also notes of coffee grinds and bittersweet chocolate. The taste lingered on long after the sip. While the body was medium, approaching on heavy, and carbonation was plentiful, leaving a sharpness to the aftertaste.

Easily drinkable, and quite sessionable, if you like to session dark beers. A must try. And, as i've discovered, one of the best gateway porters for a non-porter/stout drinker.

Very strong on the roasted malt and hop flavor with coffee and bitter chocolate making their way onto the back of your palate. It has a very dry finish that is slightly sweet at the end. The mouthfeel is the winner on this beer for me. Silky smooth texture that borders almost creamy. This is a great drinking porter that is just overall a great beer.","TheodorHerzl","Dec 30, 2007"

Aromas of roasted malts, toasty sweetness, and bittersweet chocolate, and a hint of citrus hops. Flavors closely mimic the aromas with emphasis on the roasted malts and a backup hint of orange rinds. Very clean textured with a crisp, fairly clean finish. This beer has enough character and power to substantiate the best of the Porter style, with basically no off flavors at all. Pure and simple.","BEERchitect","Nov 14, 2007"

Aroma is not overpowering, but is roasty. Flavor is quite good. Decently roasty, lots of dry-roasted coffee flavor, with just a touch of sourness as it warmed a bit.

3.95,-5.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours nearly black with a controllable tan head that will grow about as big as your pour is aggressive. Web-like lacing washes over the inside of the glass as the foam slowly sinks. The aroma is so familiar to me that I really just know it as Black Butte Porter. I could identify it 10 out of 10 times in a blind tasting much like most of the Deschutes offerings. This is the first time I've actually sat and attempted to consciously dissect its bouquet, though. Roasted malts manifest themselves as hints of chocolate, cashews and chocolate covered raisins. There is also a noticeable hop presence and faint alcohol as well. The taste is much like the aroma. Chocolatey, nutty and a bit hoppy. Oh, and there's definite coffee with 2 sugars character in here as well. The alcohol is almost imperceptible. The mouthfeel is soft and a bit watery if you've been drinking a lot of double stouts lately like I have. Not a lot of carbonation with this one. This is an excellent porter though, whose representation of the style is generally what I measure all others up against. Next time you hear somebody blindly state that they don't like dark beers, hand them one of these. Or a Speedway. haha. I totally just lol'd. LOL!","jakon","Sep 29, 2007"

4,-4.3,4,4,4,4,4,"This one was a very dark brown with chestnut, nearly purple, highlights. A short tan cap formed after the pour and showed good head retention and formed a bit of fine lacing. The dominant aroma at first was a burnt nuttiness. This was followed by malted milk, semi-sweet chocolate, and a hint of licorice. Mild bitterness throughout, this beer was quite malty, with dry cocoa and chocolate notes, a bit of licorice, and a kiss of grassy hops at the finish. Medium to full bodied and very smooth due to lowish carbonation. Solid malt texture. Very nice! Great balance with just enough complexity to stay interesting, but not messy at all.

Pours a deep brown with that consistently creamy head that leaves chunks of lacing down the glass. Smell is fairly subtle but inviting. Chocolate, light roast, some grain, faint green hops lying underneath. Taste is excellent. Not necessarily bursting with flavor but extremely smooth and satisfying. Again, nice balance of chocolate, crystal malt and roast flavors up front, meshing with light grain flavor again. Hops provide the smallest nibble in the finish but not to a noticeably bitter or dry degree, just letting their presence be known. Mouthfeel is creamy, with carbonation suitable for the style. If I could choose any Porter as my staple, it would more than likely be this one. Complex enough and definitely one of the more easily approachable Porters out there in my book. Drinkable? No question.","ncvbc","Sep 03, 2007"

Sweet and roasted malts --roasted coffee, dried fruit, light brown sugar, slight chocolate. Nice. Nicely balanced, if a bit on the sweet side -- a lot of fruit and nut comes through -- a delicious porter. Mouthfeel is a bit watery for the style, but that helps it go down easy.

3.49,-16.5,4.5,3,3.5,3,4,"Drinkability: I think it must be the roasty, black malt flavors that push the BJCP to classify this beer as a Robust Porter. However, in other regards, it's a lot lighter and smoother on the palate than other Robust Porters I've tried. It actually reminds me of a tasty Schwartzbeer I had recently. My overall impression is that it is heavy on the roasted flavors, a little light on the chocolate notes that I usually prefer in a porter, yet I'd still recommend it to friends. And better yet, I'd still seek it out. Porter is one of my favorite styles, so it'd be interesting to line this up against Great Lakes' Edmund Fitzgerald, Bell's Porter, and Sierra Nevada's Porter to see where in that line it fits.","KevBrews","Jul 07, 2007"

Immediately sourish, but then a startlingly ash-like roasted flavor kicks in, rounding off into a plum-like sweet/sour finish. The burnt earthiness mentioned above returns during the aftertaste to dry out the palate for a spell. Soured malts haunt the burps. Leafy-earthy hop notes. Superb lacing, clumpy webby and all.

My favorite time to drink this beer would be after a hard day of work on a night when I really didn't want to get wasted but still have a few beers to kick back and relax with. The Black Butte Porter doesn't have the initial acidic taste that most porters have. It's very smooth and filling, but doesn't have the side effects that a lot of the lousy porters I've had in this country.

Prominent fizziness combines with the thin body to give it a nice clean palate; bitterness is not too prominent.

Looking good so far. Roasted and charred malts in the aroma with a bit of soft marshmallow thrown in. The dark malts continue into the flavor with a bit cocoa thrown in. There are some hops in there that I can't put my finger on. I want to say it's a mint flavor, but that doens't make much sense. Maybe pine? Anyway, time to move on. It's a moderately dry beer that still manages to be rich in flavor. This is the 5th beer in the 6 pack, and I must say I'm becoming even more enamored.

The color is good: not too dark (like the porter I just homebrewed); dark brown and ruby. The complexity of the malt flavors, bits of chocolate, rich caramel make for a very tasty porter. The hops are in the background with this one, they play a supporting role, making this beer nice and balanced. The body is perfect, not too thin, or too full. There is slight tart character that really makes this porter enjoyable. Too many ales are I try these days are too clean tasting. It's nice to get a little yeast flavor once in awhile, and this beer delivers.","marcobrau","Nov 11, 2004"
4.22,1,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured a clear, dark burgundy almost black, brew with a inch and a half thick off white head that subsided to a thin film. The aroma is a beautiful balance of sharp black malts that give a burnt coffee impression. The flavor is clean and american in style but the brew pushes the boundaries with a barely perceptible hop bitterness that is immediatly overtaken by the black malt dryness. A smooth carmel malt sweetness balances the astrigency of the black malt but the dominating flavor is the black malt which is there on the inital taste and lingers on the tongue in the finish. I believe this to be an excellent example of a porter and it is one which helped me to formulate my personal definition of the porter style. The mouthfeel is light and smooth due to very little carbonic bite from the bottle conditioning. An excellent session beer this porter has a very enjoyable flavor that would be easy to drink pint after pint.","RenoZymurgist","Oct 20, 2004"
3.8,-9.1,4,4,4,3,3.5,"Mouthfeel: This is a very smooth beer, but the body lacks the weight that I look for in a porter. The flavor is very good and might be better enjoyed in a fuller bodied beer. On the other hand, a more slender body won't fill you up as quickly, so this may increase the drinkability for some.","GuinnessSmurf","Oct 19, 2004"
4.06,-2.9,4.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"A deep ruby brown with giant, pillowy head and lots of lace; a very attractive beer. Big sweet malts are the name of the game, with flavors and aromas of caramel, burnt bread, molasses, brown sugar, pumpernickel, gingerbread, and a minty herbal hopness. The finish is decisive and warming. While the beer lacks the roastiness of some porters, it's got a lot of malt flavor in it, and should satisfy those who love amber or old ales. The hops are pretty mild, providing a slight mint quality that offsets the chocolatey malts. While the mouthfeel can at times seem soft and pillowy, like the head, at other times it reveals a certain wateryness. This aids drinkability though. Black Butte remains a beer for all occasions, for good weather or bad. I prefer this store-bought in a bottle as opposed to draft at a bar, but that may be because I can control certain things: temperature, amount of head, etc.","Thrasher","Oct 18, 2004"

Coffee-chocolate flavors. Finish is light, roasty and sweet (lips sticking together after a minute or 2) Its certainly well focused on malt, but remains a bit chocolatey sweet ultimately. Fairly mild from beginning to the end which is a nice change of pace at times rather than hop bombs, but its character suffers and just leaves the impression of a straightforward well made porter. Light to medium bodied, medium carbonation. Not quite as great as expected, but of course highly drinkable etc.","Rastacouere","Sep 19, 2004"

One of the things that really impressed me was that Deschutes didn't try to ""stout it up"" like many porters. You can clearly taste the ""old ale"" origins and I'd even suggest that this is closer in character to a brown ale than it is to a stout. Excellent on its own, this would also be a great choice for a tasting party to show the evolution of the styles.","RedwoodGeorge","Sep 03, 2004"

The porter flavors fall off leaving a very pleasant lingering hop flavor in the mouth. These are well developed and delicious flavors.

Lots of malt and a fine hint of toasted grain in the crisp and fresh nose, a treat for this old schnozzle, start sweet, the top middling in its feel.

4.65,11.2,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Almost black, but some light does get through.  Sweet toffee, molasses and raisons on the nose.  Great aroma.  Nice taste. Burnt malt, expresso, roasty bitterness, chocolate and slight smokiness noted.  Medium body.  Great looking porter.  Great smelling porter.  Great tasting porter.  I would put this in the elite class of porters that I have tried.  (Glad they had one bottle left of this at the Coffee Grounds when I passed through Eau Claire a month ago.)","Bighuge","Apr 04, 2002"
4.75,13.6,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Phenomenal porter!  Medium-heavy bodied, very rich and complex.  Coffee, chocolate, smokey woodey notes.  Less hoppy than Sierra Nevada's rendering.  However, I have to say, this is the superior.  Do yourself a favor and give this baby 15 minutes out of the fridge to warm.","Jordan","Mar 13, 2002"
4.84,15.8,4,5,5,4,5,"It makes me proud to be an Oregonian. With it's appropriate ritch maltyness and a more agressive hoping than most porters makes this one one of the best around. If you are missing hte great hop presence then you may not be getting it fresh enough. For a real treat make it out to Bend Oregon and try one at the brewery. For us Oregonians Black Butte is usualy the first dark beer we had ever tried. Around here it is every where. Even is the taverns you can find a tap of it beside the bud and millr","mattmaples","Sep 18, 2001"
