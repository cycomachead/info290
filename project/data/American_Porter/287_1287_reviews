"It's a Porter!  You can't go wrong with any Porter...can you!?"
"Love this porter, and think it is a solid representation of this style"
""
""

""

""

"A solid porter. Dark malt, chocolate and faint coffee aromas and flavors. Welcome to Southern California Bell's!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"An excellent expression of a straight porter.  The aroma is full, complex, and inviting.  Slightly over carbonated hurts the mouth feel, but an otherwise superior porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O.  Really enjoying this porter.  Good balance.  Nice body.  A win for me.  Will drink again."
""
""
""
""
"Nice smooth taste."
""
""
""
""
"Perfect porter for a cold winter evening."
""
""
""
""
"Decent, but I prefer more robust styles like founders or Edmund Fitz."
""
""
""
""
""
"My second favorite Porter after Founder's ""Porter""."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A well-rounded light porter - not too sweet, not too roasty, not too bitter.  Goes down easy but not as smooth a most heavier porters or stouts - feels more like a lager overall. If you think of it as ""Porter-lite"" you will appreciate its virtues. If you are expecting something more robust you may be disappointed."
"Pours a pretty dark brown with khaki colored head. Caramel malts and coffee on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with a little sweetness."
"Gotta say im kinda fond of this one"
""
""
""
""
""
"Carbonation a bit ""bitey"". Bitterness is stout like. Decent roasted taste. Minimal foam head."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  This is another solid porter.  Great balance between the smokiness of the roasted malt and the brown sugar-like sweetness.  Porter fans should definitely try this!"
""
"Sanguine tinge, caramel foam. Light caramel, bittersweet chocolate. Light and refreshing."
""
"This was a decent porter overall. Nothing super special that stands out though."
""
""

""

""

"One of my favorite Porters."

"BOD 8/29/14.  Pours almost black.  Above average head volume, excellent retention and lacing.  Light nose of roast with hints of dark fruit and chocolate. Medium bodied with a nice slick texture that approaches creamy.  Above average carbonation with effervescence from the middle on. The flavor profile is of average intensity, a bit complex and is masterfully balanced.  It begins with a blend of roast, dark fruit and dark chocolate that reveal themselves in that order.  The roast lingers to the middle where it meets a mild hop bitterness.  The finish is a slow fade of roast and hop bitterness over a slightly sweet note.  A good laid back porter, but not outstanding."
""
""
"Smooth, balanced, & very sessionable. This is my go to porter if I want to knock back more then a few ;)"

"O: Very solid porter. I would happily drink this all day in the yard raking leaves."
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with a creamy head. Aroma has elements of coffee, roasted malt and kind of a burnt wood like quality. Taste is mostly malty with elements of coffee. Finish is slightly bitter and hoppy. The feel is perhaps my favorite attribute; although it is a dark beer, it has a deceptively light, creamy and lively carbonation which lends itself to a crisp and refreshing taste normally associated with lighter beers. I had this beer with chocolate and it was a great pairing. Overall a nice example of porter."

"Very dark brown, almost black in color with a soft tan head.  Good retention throughout the duration of the beer.  Pleasant, mild aroma of dark chocolate and roasted malts.  Flavor is much of the same with roasted malts and a hint of chocolate to round it out.  Medium bodied with a slight bitter finish and goes down easy.  Very solid porter here.  Not too heavy, not too light.  I picked this one up in NY but if Bell's distributed in NJ this would be something I would purchase regularly."
""
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown, bordering on black. A light tan head caps it, dissipating quickly to a thin layer that leaves some soapy lacing. The aroma is nice, a little restrained, but hitting all the right notes, with rich roasted notes, mild earthy hops, and some nice coffee tones. The taste is just a little more forward, incorporating all the aroma elements and superbly blending them. No one aspect dominates at any point. The body is a little thinner and there is a slight carbonation tingle on the finish."

"Final score: 4.10"
"Pours pitch black. Strong frothy head reduces to khaki lacing. Scents of Breakfast Blend coffee and biscuits waft off. Good porter bitterness on the nose. Some acids courtesy of coffee, toasted barley, and a bit of smoked peet. Mid-palate it is coffee, some cocoa, and a lingering tartness. The back palate is all malt and biscuits with some lingering coffee notes. Fairly dry, but still very drinkable. Like a good cup of Arabica. Aftertaste is all coffee and toasted barley. 4 out of 5. Very good. Recommended."

"O- A decent slightly above average porter. Not on the level of Edmund Fitzgerald or Founders Porter though."
""
"O: I'm spoiled with GLBC's Ed Fitz being brewed just a few miles away as that's a high bar to beat as far as porters are concerned. This is a good beer and is a good example of the style, just not quite in the same league as Ed"

"Roasted flavor and good malt flavoring"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Once I decide on a regular beer I may go back to this one one day. Not really, I will never have a regular beer with all the options we have now, but this is a porter I would buy again. Its fairly easy to find where I live, and the price is totally reasonable for what you are getting. Bell's does it again!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Aftertaste is sweet and like a frozen coffee drink mixed with some doughy yeast. The mouthfeel is light and thin, with a lighter body, a smooth feel and a slightly bitter finish which trails off like a coffee. Overall pretty tasty and very easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I love a good porter and that's exactly what this is. Rich malty flavor that cascades in a caramel climax that is maybe a bit pronounced, But I like it nonetheless. Very drinkable and not overly heavy. Pours a dark opaque brown, not quite black, yet extremely dark. A very good beer for a night in, a fire, and a steak."

"Taste: Roasted malts, coffee, surprisingly thin mouthfeel and light body for such a rich smelling beer. Short finish with very slight hop bitterness at the end that lingers a few seconds refreshing the palate."

"Although a different style, when I think of this beer I think of Stone's Levitation Ale, in the sense that both are a great interpretation of their respective style's, are very drinkable, and have nothing that is going to offend a drinker. Also, you can have several of these and not be passed out on the floor."

"O - A good porter that could be even better if it had a little more complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a nice porter that brings a decent brown sugar note, it just isn't a *great* porter. I certainly wouldn't kick her out of bed, but I'd much rather fuck someone like Founders Porter instead."

"O: This exceeded my expectations. I have had a few lackluster beers in a row and I am in a slump so I expected more of the same. This was really good and all of the aspects work well together - the taste and the mouthfeel really make this one a notable porter. I would not have been surprised if this was a milk stout with the sweet characteristics. This one is 7 months old - I'd like to try a newer one for comparison."
"O: This is a nice porter. It's starts sweet but doesn't finish quite as sweet, the dark roasted malts seem to add to the semidry finish. A nice porter overall, but there's a nit of mustiness that seems to detract from this brew for me. Overall, a great example of the style that may appeal to some, just not one of my favorites,"

"Overall: Excellent offering. I have reviewed other porters quite harshly, but it was difficult to say a bad word against this one. Not cloying like many porters; complex and delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: its an enjoyable brew. i can see the mouthfeel being a little light for some people, but then you can just go grab a stout. there is nothing outstanding in here, but i think thats because its balanced so well. that being said, its not the best porter i've ever had. a nice drinker and fair representation of the style"
"O - This is a well-made porter. It is not very layered or complex, but is very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark (as a porter should be) without much head to speak of. Tastes of coffee. Noticeable carbonation, rather light and thin mouthfeel. Toasty/malty flavors (as a porter should be). I love me some dark beer, and this is a great easy drinker, but as others have noted there is not a ton going on here. More of a session porter than anything else (not that there's anything wrong with that)."

"In the world of porters, Bell's sits a tick above average. It may not sound like much to some, but because I adore porters more than many other styles, I wouldn't shy away to ""porter"" myself another bottle!"

"This porter pours a deep almost black brown color with a handsome and lasting tan head and decent lacing. The nose is unremarkable with notes of coffee and roasted malt. It is light in aroma as well as in taste. The flavor follows the nose with a surprising amount of alcohol flavor given the low abv. The body is light to medium with a bit if a dry chew on the tail. This is a good porter but when you have offerings like Founders and Edmund Fitzgerald porters, why settle for good?"
""
""
""
"A very nice but simple sessionable Porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice hearty porter. Ranks up there with Founders."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad Porter, a good after work brew. So far Bell's is three for three for me and I have more to go..."
""
""
""
"Fantastic porter. Smooth, delicious, and easy to drink. Well worth your money."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A pleasant porter, for sure. Has the elements you look for in a porter, but itâ€™s just that. Itâ€™s like the foundation for a superior beer without pushing the envelope and taking to that next level. Probably a good beer to start with if youâ€™re trying to get into the style or stouts. That jaw dropping pizzazz is just missing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A great porter from a great brewery and one I would definitely be drinking again in the future. A great representation that isn't an over-the-top hopped version either. Pairs great with a sweet chocolate dessert after a meal or on it's own."
""
"Overall: Pretty nice porter. Please come to Boston soon."
"A very good attempt at the style. A bit simple for me, but definitely fantastic for pairing with food."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice assertive Porter, one with the most obvious coffee notes."
""
"This was about as close to a session Porter that I ever had and if there was another bottle, I would be having it right now. While not as great as the leaders in this category, this would be a great beer for anyone who never had one of these before. It almost reminded me of a Lactose or Oatmeal Stout without the booze or overpowering chocolate and cocoa flavors. By itself, this was a pleasant surprise that fits in nicely with the other offerings from Bell's that I've enjoyed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A good porter; body is bit thin and the aroma is not on the same level as the taste. A solid brew overall."
"Great balance between roast malt and chocolate. Very approachable porter. Bitterness and roast do not overwhelm. Lacks complexity compared to some."
""
""
"o: big american porter. rich and flavorful. would go great with roasted meat or sweet chocolate cake or creme brulee. nice example of robust porter. i would have another."
""
""
""
""
"O- I enjoyed this beer quite a lot. I recommend this beer to anyone who likes classic porter, or someone who is just trying to get into dark beers. I can see why this beer received the score it did. TRY IT!!!"

"O: This is a solid robust porter. Exactly what you want from such a beer. Definitely recommended, as are most of their beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A beer that reminds me why porters were among my first beer loves. I like that there is a distinct territory this beer is working that contrasts with the heavier chocolate and coffee notes of stouts. The grains are clear, clean notes, not just a muddled hint without clarity. Real craft being shown here. That it did this without dumping in the hops is itself of note."
"O- A well crafted porter. Doesn't burn itself into the memory with excitement but I feel this is a good thing. Many times I have passed this up for bigger offerings but every time I return to it im never disappointed. A wonderful example to show someone a textbook porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bell's has yet to make an average beer; this is no exception. I loved the hoppiness displayed here, particularly for a porter. A wonderfuly aromatic beer that would go well with some thick food like oatmeal and sausage. I wouldn't have it with your morning orange juice, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this porter. I will definitely drink this again. :)"
""
"I really like this porter. I received two bottles as a gift, and see that it is not distributed in my home state of New Hampshire, so I will be keeping the second bottle to enjoy in another month or two (before the 6 month expiry)!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Decent average style of porter."
""
""
""
"O- Being new to the richer malty side of the spectrum I appreciate the hoppyness of this beer. It has definitely sparked my curiosity for the darker styles of my favorite beverage. Bells porter was enjoyed tremendously this evening and it will surely not be the last! well, not only because I have 5 more in the fridge..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D - I wasn't exactly enamoured with this. OK, but certainly nothing to get excited about. Cola in the flavour profile wasn't pleasing and it just wasn't something you can really get into."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall this beer was just alright. Nothing that wowed me"
"O - Bell's porter was an enjoyable example of a Robust Porter. The beer leaned heavier towards the dark fruit and bittersweet chocolate character. Overall, it had a sessionable quality that was highlited by it's light to medium body that was showcased by a low level of carbontation."
""
""
""
""
"O - Another good brew from Bell's, very approachable, very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""

"A delicious sessionable porter. Really happy bells opened up distribution to NY."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a great offering from Bells. As good of a porter as Two-Hearted is an IPA."
""
"Overall: pretty good. i am not a big fan of the coffee taste in my beers but this one is pretty good. not sure i would drink it very often though"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - sweeter than i expected from a porter, reminds me more of a mild chocolate stout."
"notes: maybe not Eddy Fitz but this is a damn good Porter. Looking forward to a taste test between Bell's, Founder's and Eddy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good porter from Bells."
""
""
""
"O: a tasty and smooth porter that while light bodied packs a good amount of flavour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The truly dark, rich flavours are normally reserved for stouts but there's little that Bell's Porter doesn't provide. Whether you own a massive beer cellar or simply a bottle opener, this is a must-have beer to keep on-hand. Trade, plan a road trip to Michigan - do whatever it takes."
"A great beer from Bell's I put this along with a bottle of K-Zoo Stout in my chili. it gives it some flavor. Nice brownish to blackish beer with minimal head. smooth tasting and great overall feeling when drinking this beer. I cant complain too much about and awesome beer. so hears again to Bell's"
"What can you say? Thank you Larry Bell for getting over your NY ""thing", this porter is a real treat. Yumm."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good stuff."
"Overall: This is a pretty good Porter. I've had better and worse. It was actually one of my early gateway Porters, so I've got to give it props for that."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is good medium body and moderate carbonation leaves this highly drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle again from my friend Chris T who needs to give me beer to stay a friend. Pours a very dark lacy beer with a small head. Smell is dominated by toasted malts and the taste follows as planned. Very well balanced beer that tastes great. Very solid porter ...I see why Bells is so well regarded"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Not the best Porter I've ever had but it makes my Top 5. If you have a chance to have 1, do it. Would be a delicious companion to Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner."
"Overall a solid porter that I wouldnt turn down. Impressed with the freshness of this bottle. As with anything Bells its worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a well-balanced, well-executed porter that is roasted, but never gimmicky."

"Bell's Porter ---4/5."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Another disappointment with Bell's - knowing what these guys can do, I realize this is a more crowd-pleasing, less diverse offering. Mind you, I love the taste of basic American porters, but this one feels too one-dimensional in the long run. Worth a try for Bell's completionists."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There are many porters out there that include a host of add-ons (coffee, cherries, vanilla, etc.) but neglect to include the classic porter qualities. This is a no-frills porter that stays true to style and delivers basic roasted goodness."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into nonic pint glass; pitch black with a foamy tan head that fades quickly but leaves a good amount of lacing. Smell is roasted malt with hints of coffee. Taste is smooth roasted malt, moving into bitter chocolate and coffee with fuzzy carbonation and a clean, slightly watery mouthfeel. Nothing amazing, but a good standard porter."
""
""
""
""
" Overall: Really enjoyable porter. Nothing crazy, just a solid, easy drinking beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An incredible beer by Bell's that I would definitely drink again. Comparable to their Kalamazoo Stout, but with less complexity. A great beer for cool evenings- I could definitely see this as an early-fall beer where one is not yet ready to hit up the boozy imperial stouts or anything, but desires that warming roastiness."
""
""
""
""
"O - I typically enjoy bells and this is no different. I am also new to porters, but this seemed to have a nice, well balanced profile that was not overpowering. I liked it quite a bit."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: very lightweight beer, but you'd never know by the punch this one packs. full bodied, roasty flavors. hard to put down."
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours pitch black with a small light brown head that leaves a little lacing. Smells of coffee and sweet sugar. Tastes of coffee and slight chocolate. Beer has good carbonation and medium bodied, goes down smooth. Overall, a very good beer."
"O: Not a big fan. It is super dry tasting with no leading flavors. Everything seems subdued."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
"Morey's Bottom Line: What this beer lacks in aroma and feel, it more than makes up for on the taste. Really solid Porter in my book."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer impressed me a lot, I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was. Bell's is always top notch, but I've passed this beer on the shelf too many times. Finally gave it a shot and I'm in love. Will be returning to this one again when I'm in the mood for a porter."

"O: I feel that this was a good porter, being from my favorite brewery Bell's I was expecting a lot more, but this wasnt bad at all. Bought this in a variety case from shangys in PA."
"12 oz bottle. Pours dark brown with tall, short-lived, beige, creamy head. Aroma is of dark fruit, coffee, chocolate, toasted, nutty malt, bread crust, cacao. Body is full and smooth. Taste is herbal hops, roasted malt, coffee and cream, dark fruit and brown sugar. Finish is long and earthy. Wonderful Porter."

"well i like this beer pours great in glass , a little swett tasting but the way it rolls around in your mouth is very pleasent so enjoy great color great taste doesnt blow you away but there a taste in there that make you come back for more enloy this beer the one guy compares this beer to the heavy hitter of edmund and and founder this is not them but a very enjoy triple a beerdrink and enjoy"
"overall: did a blind test with Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald and Founders Porter, this was my least favorite and the lightest of the bunch. A decent porter, but just lacking the flavor and chocolately kick I expect from a porter. One of my least favorite beers from Bells."
""
""
""
"Great tasting porter from a prestigious Michigan brewing company. Why have I never had this before?"
""
"Overall - A decent porter. Nothing that would make me seek it out again, especially given the difficulties at a lack of California distribution."

"This porter does excel in taste with dry chocolate malt and roasted malt or toasted bread/cracker. Hints toward a red ale the dry chocolate lends back to a stout which makes this porter slightly schizophrenic. The feel is easy but substantial and holds this beer together."

"a nice brown almost black pour with 2 fingers of tan head, great retention and nice amount of lacing left behind. smells of chocolate, grapes, and toasted grains. a light refreshing chocolate and dark roasted grain flavor. not much there, but the toasted grains make their presence known, as does the sweet chocolateyness. medium body with high carbonation. crisp and refreshing for a porter, sweet yet still has the roasty bitterness. overall, a great porter."

"Would pair well with music from Earth Wind and Fire."

"O - Good until the finish. Not sure if it wants to be hoppy or smooth roast."
""
""
"This is a nice, easy-to-drink porter. The flavor isn't over the top or too boldly forward, but it is a solid flavor profile. This one is enjoyable and worth checking out."

"O-A decent brew, the smells are the best part but they do no show up too strong in the taste. I'd buy it again, it is above average"

"Overall - An above average beer that while very drinkable is not terribly exciting. It seems a touch watery/thin but still has enough flavour to keep it interesting."
""

""

""
""
""
""
"Flavor is nice and rounded, challenging the tongue while making it feel comfortable. Rich roastiness up front followed by chocolate and coffee and finishes with a nice bitterness that linger slightly along with some sweeter malt flavors. Tingles the gums. Medium bodied with big carbonation. Good flavor and drinkabililty. Not too complex but deep enough, i like it."

"Overall a very solid porter, a recommended drink for fans of the style"

"I expected a lot more from this brewery :("
"A good porter. All the right flavors, but it doesn't go anywhere. Some nice complexity, but not enough to really keep it going through the whole bottle."
""
""
"Poured from 12oz bottle into duvel tulip. Pours a deep brown with a slight tan head. Crazy chocolate aroma, some slight hops also. Smells really initing. Taste is crisp chocolatey roasty malt, but a bit sweet. Slightly over carbed and thin, but nice overall flavor. Good solid porter."
"The folks @ Bell's do good work, and this is a good starter if you haven't tried their beers before."
""
""
"O: Overall, it's a good beer and porter, but I feel that I've had better from Bell's, but still, it's a good beer and is worth a try."
""
"All in all, not bad, just a little to muddled and unrefined. Maybe extended aging would bring things together better. Who knows?"
""
""
"{12 oz bottle produced essentially the same impression and ratings - March 2013 & again August 2013}"

"Not the best Porter I've ever had, but one of the better ones. It is certainly worth drinking, so go out and drink it!"

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled 9/6/2012. Pours lightly hazy very dark reddish brown color with a nice 1-2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of big chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, toffee, coffee beans, toast, light dark fruit, cream, and herbal hops. Very nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of milk chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, toffee, toast, light coffee, earth, and herbal hops. Lingering notes of milk chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, toffee, and herbal hops on the finish for a bit. Nice balance and robustness of flavors; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, slick, and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice porter. Nice balance of nicely robust roasted flavors; very smooth to drink. Very enjoyable and sessionable porter."
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O: Vanilla-roast became more pronounced, and the finish improved, as the beer warmed. But it still remained a bit thin. This would probably be an enjoyable Porter during the heat of Summer, but it's not an ideal Winter Porter."
""
""
""
""
""
"An easy drinker. Not spectacular, but satisfying."
""
""
""
""
""
"O â€“ This is a pretty good porter. The aroma is a little subdued and the mouthfeel is a little thinner than I would like, but it looks great and is tasty. Thereâ€™s nothing special here, but itâ€™s a very solid and drinkable example of the style."
""
""
""
"O - Nothing spectacular, but a really solid and well made porter."
""
"Medium bodied, smooth carbonation, tasty stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a easy drinking porter, I would deffinately drink this one again. Hat's off to Bell's"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This should be one of the benchmark porters. This is a classic porter, and it is an outstanding example of porter. This beer hits the mark as a classic porter."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I like it .. but the notes are unexpected. certainest I've had better, but a very drinkable beer. worth tasting."
""
""
""
"Another solid beer from Bell's, this porter may not be the ""best"" on the market, but it is very drinkable and a nice choice for the price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: I'm not sure what the original Porters tasted like, but this one seems like it would fit right in with those. It's sort of a back-to-basics example of the style but it does not disappoint. It's nicely robust with a lot of great flavors to back it up."
""
""
""
"Very dark, almost black, delicious malty, cocoa flavor that is extremely drinkable. No detectable hop bitterness. Aftertaste is bitterness of dark chocolate. Very well balanced. Almost as good in the bottle, although slightly more bitterness. Large amount of yeast sediment in bottom of bottle that was resuspended upon vigorous swirling. A full bodied mouthfeel rich and creamy."
"Overall: a very tasty, well-crafted porter. This would be a go-to beer for me if it were sold around here."
""
""
""
"This is very light and drinkable for the style. I would say it is a bit mild, but it's not like it is labelled as a robust porter. This is nicely balanced and easy to drink. If I could get Bell's on the East Coast, I would drink this again."
""
""
""
"O) Solid porter, quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""

"This boy pours out a deep brown with a finger of head. The aroma is rich with bready malts, caramel, and cocoa. The flavor is tasty, it's robust and roasty, with cocoa and a hint of vanilla. The mouthfeel is moderate on carbonation and a bit lighter on body, and the drinkability is good. Not much to say about this one, it's just a solid porter. Doesn't stray from the base of the style, but it is well-executed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

""

"O - A tasty and almost-sessionable porter. Plenty of flavor,; leaning towards coffee more than chocolate. I like it although I prefer the Founders Porter which has more of a charred flavor and is a little thicker in feel."
"O - The sweet chocolate flavors make this easy to drink, but I wish that the hops were a little more present."
"A sudsy, thick head with good lacing and stuck around the glass for the entire drink. Beer is a dark, deep brown. Aroma is definitely coffee notes and malty/toasty. Taste is sweet, coffee, and maybe a hint of dark chocolate. A bitterness sets in, much like espresso, on the finish. As the beer warmed, it seemed like there was a hint of some dark fruit present. A good porter that evolved throughout the drink."
""
""
""
"I find that Porter mouthfeels really vary, but this is good. Lighter than probably your run of the mill craft porter. Carbonation level is good. Well balanced the whole way through. Not the best but certainly not the worst, solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Finally got around to giving this brew a proper review. Pours a very dark brown, with a light brown head and alright lacing. Scent of caramel, roasted malt, and milk chocolate. Taste follows the nose very well - with additional notes of a lighter coffee and a hint of what seems like chicory. Really a fantastically balanced porter, and while there is nothing standout spectacular about this brew - in my opinion it is *the* baseline for what a porter should taste like, and that is definitely a remarkable accomplishment."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This was a decent porter and another nice offering from Bell's. I liked the aroma however I felt like there could have been a little bit more flavor and definitely a little bit more full bodied- felt kind of watered down for a porter. Other then that it was an enjoyable porter that was easy to drink. I'd recommend trying it out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it is a decent porter which is one of my favorite styles. A good dark beer for summer sipping."
""
"D - Very drinkable. Nice american porter with good malt profile and body. Nicely balanced."
"Dark brown, almost black. Tan head, good retention and lace. Cocoa and coffee roast in the nose, chocolate as well. A bit sweet, some brown sugar. Everything in nice proportion. More roast, dark malt, chocolate and a bit of tartness in the finish. Mouthfeel is lighter medium, perhaps a little moreso than I dig. Still creamy though. A really nice porter, something to be had many times over."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a lively beer dominated by roasted malts with some dark malts as well."
""
""
""
"Pours dark brown or black with small khaki head. Smells of roasted malt and coffee, light sweetness, nice and pleasant. Taste follow the nose, with some light roasted malts, a hint of coffee, and light chocolate sweetness, but could be a bit more robust. Medium bodied, with low to medium carbonation. Would like a little more body on this. A solid porter overall and pretty easy drinking."
"A very simple porter. Nothing too unique about it. I'd drink it when I'm in the mood for a milder dark beer or for pairing with a hearty meal."
""
""
"Appearance is dark brown, a nice off-white head. Its` nose contains wood, cocoa and a smoky quality. Taking a sip of this long overdue beer to try and I taste raisins, dark chocolate, cherry and roasted malts. Mouthfeel is medium, a dry finish. A nice porter, worth trying if you have not already done so."
""
"Well crafted straight-forward enjoyable session-able American porter."
""
""
""
""
"Edit : I had a bottle a year later (a February 2013 bottle consumed in September 2013) and reviewed it without checking these notes. The review was almost word-for-word the same, so I give Bell's props for consistency."
""
""
"Overall - This is a very robust and flavorful porter, not sweet at all, nice complexity, great finish and fantastic mouthfeel for the style."
""
""
"Now the taste is interesting. nutty and woody. Dry grains, and notes of a barrel. Odd I know, considering this isnt BA. Theres a light body, but it feels thick. I just get all dry grains and woody barrel. Finishes clean with chewy malt."
"12oz bottle dated 3/23/12 so decently fresh. Dark black, brown head. Smells like grainy malts, eh, boring. Taste is slightly malty but I really thought this was a letdown. It was not a bad beer it was just sort of boring and I love porters. I would probably give this one more shot because I know Bells makes great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Solid porter, nothing wowing, but porters are not supposed to be. Light but tasty, very satisfying and flavorful without being too light."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is dark brown to almost black with a tan head. Head retention is average, with lacing slightly above average. A nice combination of cocoa, coffee, and dark fruit scents make for a very enjoyable smell. The taste is flavorful - very well balanced with nice complexity. A panorama of flavors including dark fruit, chocolate, coffee, and bitter citrus cross the palate in approximately that order. Mouthfeel is good but not outstanding for the style. I'd put this among the best porters that I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-More roasty/burnt than most porters however the thin/watery mouthfeel is a let down."
""
""
""
"Overall - I know that this beer is a good flavor for what it's intended to be.. but I just hate anything coffee-like. But I will not mark this down because of that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M- Medium bodied, lively carbonation."
""
"O: One of the smoothest porters I've tried. Would drink again. Great with steak."
""
"I prefer many other Bell's brews to this one, but they did a pretty good job."
""
""
"O - A solid porter that won't blow you away but is there for you when you're not looking to concentrate on a beer."
""
""
""
"Overall - A decent porter. I felt it a little lacking on lasting flavor, but what was present was good. Well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I love to start with this and then go elsewhere. It has a very clean (again, drinkable) taste where you could stay with this all night, were you in the mood, and not bother to change it up."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I haven't had many porters that I have really enjoyed but I like this one. Easy to drink because it doesn't have that overpowering char flavor to it."
""
""
"Mouth feel is good as well. Pretty well balanced with a smooth overall feel."
""
""
"Poured with a tan head, good lacing, and it was opaque in the glass. Aroma of coffee and chocolate and the same tastes came through. It had a minimal carbonation and was very smooth. The aftertaste was slight like after sipping coffee. A quality porter that was enjoyable but subtle enough to drink in a session. I see that as a plus, because some porters can overwhelm your palate."
""
""
""
""
"D - As a session, not bad."
"Overall : I really respect Bells this is a enjoyable porter, but did not blow me away. Definitely a thirst quenching brew."
""
""
"Poured dark brown with small 1/2 inch head which disappeared rather quickly. Minimal lacing. Nice roasted grain aroma. I found it a bit thin to the feel for a porter. Maybe I was expecting something a bit heavier given the look and aroma. Taste of roasted coffee and some chocolate. Good solid porter. Easy to drink. Much better offering from Bells as compared to their Pale Ale which I sampled last night."
""
"(D)- A solid to great porter. Classic flavor and a smooth feel to it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good. I would drink plenty more of these. The blend of flavors is well balanced and provides what you want out of a solid Porter. The building sweetness held me back a bit. I would prefer a bit more roast."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I expected more from Bell's, but then again, based on my experience with their previous beers, my standards were pretty high."
""
""
""
""
""
"An exceptional session porter here, and one of my favorites from Bell's, for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall just a simple good style of the drink and enjoyable."
""
""
"D/O: This porter is a mixed bag of positive and less appealing features; unfortunately for it, the flavor leaves the most to be desired. The appearance is textbook, not too much of an opaque overachiever, with a head that lasts as long as one would like. Appealing flavor qualities spend too much time fighting with acidity and questionable synergies, at one point tasting a bit too much like unscented hand soap. Its fine, and it manages to thread the needle of porter status; it just leaves the drinker wondering if it couldn't be even better."
""
""
"Beer is medium to light in body, a little sweet / chocolaty on the front with a mild maltness, thins out toward the back, mildly roasty / bitter. I enjoyed it."
"Pours a deep brown color, off white khaki colored head forms and leaves some lace down the glass. Aroma is full of roasted malts, chocolate, dark bread, and toast. In the flavor, nice roasted malt presence, undertones of coffee, nuts, and chocolate. Mild bitterness, and little hop flavor. Medium bodied feel with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, a stand out porter, worth getting every time."
""
""
"O-this is a good porter. its very smooth. the taste seems to get lost as you drink this, except the smoked taste stays. its very drinkable. this isn't groundbreaking, but its one of the easy porters that i could drink all night long, and i don't have to give an arm and a leg to obtain it."

"I love Bell's. This is a fine beer. But good, not great, which is less than I expect from this brewery."

""

"O- This is a very good porter, Bells can do no wrong in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O â€“ Solid flavors and taste. Has a little bit more sweetness then I prefer but overall a solid brew."

"Overall this is good."
""

"MF- Medium bodied and creamy feel to this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lively carbonation that prickles the tongue a bit; a little thin but appropriate for the style. Very easy drinking. A beer that really opens up as it breathes; complex roast, coffee, hop, char, burnt sugar and creme brulee flavors emerge."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Really not bad at all. Smell was the only off-putting element. Other than that this was a basic, satisfying porter."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very satisfying porter. Package date: 08/04/11. Another beer I look forward to stocking up on while back in Ohio and Michigan."
""
""
"Overall, a very enjoyable porter. Good stuff for sure."
""
""
""
"Drinkability: I tend to suspect porters and stouts that are not opaque, but this is solid. It is very thick and flavorful."
"Overall: Fairly stock porter with a lackluster flavor profile."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown color from the bottle, producing a sticky, sudsy off-white head. The aroma consists of vanilla cream, a hint of white chocolate, malt, bourbon, and sweets. The beer feels pleasantly milky as it coats my mouth. Nice and light with a fresh toasted flavor and a hint of coffee. Smoky finish. As other reviewers have said - incredibly drinkable!"
""
""
""
"O - Very yummy porter. Incredibly drinkable, you could down a 6-er of this no problem. The sweetness is delicious. I love drinkable porters, and this one is definitely near the top of that list!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Overall an excellent porter. Not amazing like a Great Lakes or a Founders but just one tier down."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink and goes down smoothly."

"12 oz into a tulip...where does one draw the line between a stout and a porter? making a more stoutly porter does add some appeal to the masses but I'm not sure I'd call this a porter, if one is to take the classic stance that acidity (sourness) is the divider. more sour porters don't sell quite as well. this is a fine beer with a very dark body, good balance, smooth robust malts and a sweet full nose. I'm not totally sure I'd call this a porter if I stumbled upon this recipe, but I'd call it a damn fine session stout. cheers to Bell's for another fine beer."

"Pours an almost black with a small tan head. It smells of roasted coffee with hints of chocolate. Smooth brew and very easy drinking with roasted chocolate after taste that doesn't linger in your mouth. Very nice porter all in all. I like Bells and this lived up to my expectations."
"Overall-Excellent, excellent porter. This will be joining my regular lineup for sure."
"O - Bell's rarely disappoints me, and this is no exception. I can see coming back to this beer, especially during the winter."
"Enjoyable and drinkable porter. There are probably some better ones out there but solid all around."
"The beer poured a pleasant black with a nice tan head. The aroma was of caramel malt and a delightful hint of cherry. The taste was of toasty caramel malt and tart cherry. The feel was medium and dry. This was an excellent and interesting beer, combining toasted malt and tart flavors to give a unique porter experience."
"O: Really solid example of a porter. Nothing over the top but a wonderful brew nonetheless."
"Overall: This is a solid porter. I'm not sure I'll pick this one up again, but I might."
"Bell's Porter is a quality brew like all their offerings. It's carbonation sets it apart from others and its noticeable hoppiness sets it apart from the others. These qualities neither detract of add to the quality; they just make it uniques."
"Overall a very good beer. Not too alcoholic and very pleasant. I'm already looking forward to my next one."
"I am glad I got my hands on a Bells"
"D: This drinks nicely, it's smooth and the alcohol is in a range that isn't session able, but it won't prevent me from drinking a few of these."
"Overall: Only a so-so porter. It could be that I just got a bad bottle. The date was 8/30/11 so it shouldn't be past its prime. However, for now I will be sticking with Founders Porter which I enjoyed much more."
"o-very nice very drinkable. should be a go to porter at my place now."
"overall: I've gone back and forth with Bell's Porter for a few years, but this latest bottle is much better than I remember. Definitely a great 6 pack to try."
"Light mouthfeel but it's not too distracting. Overall, a solid Porter and one that could be enjoyed regularly."
"A classic porter. I would love to have this in my fridge at all times."
"O - Amazing beer, staple in my fridge. Everyone needs to try this."
"Medium body, nice carbonation, chewy and slightly dry on the tongue. Drinks nicely with a solid balance between coffee and malt, another hit from Bells."
"Overall: Definitely a session porter, but Iâ€™m inclined to like it. It goes down easy and keeps the palette light without lacking. Itâ€™s not a beer that really develops with time or temperature.. Itâ€™ll be the same quaff from first sip to last, and I imagine from beginning to end of a session. Take that as a pro or con."
"Overall impression, a very forgettable beer. If this were my only choice against the big brewers, I would be drinking water instead."
"Pours a dark black with a decent amount of caramal like foam. Tastes of slight dark roasted malts, with a very faint chocolate like finish. The mouthfeel could be a bit thicker, but its a decent session porter overall. Would have no problem having this as a go to beer if it was available here."
"O: not super impressed I found the founders porter as much better."
" Poured a ruby red darkness, exactly what you would picture in a robust porter. Not much head retention. I was getting some roasted malty sweet tones in the nose, maybe a little coffee. Mouthfeel didn't disappoint and got better as the bottle went down and temp of the beer increased. Taste was like a robust porter with a slight hint of coffee and sweetness, maybe a little treacle. This reminded me of the college days and I longed for more. I haven't had a lot of porters recently but I feel this is a great example of the style."
"This beer has good flavors, but there's just something lacking. Maybe a stronger flavor profile? Maybe more carbonation? It's hard for me to say. I just feel like there are probably better porters out there."
"Overall: Pretty good. I probably won't buy any more of these from Trader Joe's, but I'm going to try some that I get from my friends at The Wine and Cheese Place and see if there is a difference. I just think Trader Joe's doesn't know how to care for their brew and it hurts them a bit. I can see why this one has gotten higher reviews than what I'm going to give it here."
"D - A slightly above average American Porter... I trust Bells to turn out solid enjoyable style interruptions and this is no exception... Pretty good, but not special... I would drink again, but not something I would highly recommend either... ""Decent"" describes this one quite nicely..."
"This is a really a good porter. Not the best I've had (that title probably goes to Edmund Fitzgerald), but among my favorites. If available where I live, I'd certainly drink this again."
"Not as full flavored as other, ""better"" porters, but decent nonetheless."
"O - Average porter for me, and average guy."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of roasted malts, some coffee notes are detected. Taste is of roasted malts and coffee up front, some hops are present, a touch of chocolate. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
"The beer pours a solid black, with only a finger and a half of light tan colored foam rising from the pour. The head does display both admirable retention and lacing though. The nose reminds me of a milk stout. There's some black coffee and roasted grains, but there's also a sweetness that reminds me of a lactose infused beer. Those same three things are what jump out in the flavor. The roasted grain though increases in presence to the point that it lends a slightly acrid note to the beer. The mouthfeel is solid on this one. The carbonation is spot on, a bit on the subdued side to let the malts shine forward, but the body could stand to be just a touch more substantial. Bell's Porter is a solid porter, and one that I wouldn't mind picking up a six pack of every once in a while if it was distributed in New Jersey."
"Overall -- Overall, pretty good. I'd take the bottle over the cask on this one, but it was certainly worth trying."
"Porter is light and easy drinkable and despite its low ABV, it has aged beautifully."
"Pours a solid black with a thin tan lace of head. Smells of deep rich coffee beans, faint chocolates, and sweet licorice. Again rich coffee on the tongue, sugary sweets, toffee, chocolate, and wholesome nuts. The feel is light to medium despite its heavy color, very rich, savory and tasty. Overall this is a damn good porter, it hits all the right spots, and has a nice complexity that makes it very enjoyable beer."
"O- Definitely a good beer a very sessionable porter. A good version to the style imparting a lot of sweet chocolate and coffee flavors."
"This Porter is lighter in body than many of its competitors, but we still think that two might be our limit in one sitting as it might start to feel too thick. We really enjoy this beer, but donâ€™t just take our word for it - go try a pint yourself."
"O: A different take on a porter, more akin to a stout. I love the creaminess and dark roast aromas/flavors. Definitely something I'd go out of my way to get again. A solid ""A" brew. I think I prefer this to Bell's Kalamazoo Stout, at least out of the bottle. This rivals my all-time favorite Edmund Fitzgerald. I'll have to put them up head-to-head someday to see which one comes out the winner. But it'll be a damn close call."
"D- Sessionable, easy drinking porter. Its very light on the palate. The flavour profile is a good example of the style but perhaps lacks a slight depth in malty character."
"It's very good, but by no means the best porter I've had. I think I'm just getting too much roasted malt and I'd like some deeper flavors."
"Overall-I've always wanted to try some beers from Bells andover the past few months I have been able to have alot. Really impressed with what they do with their lower ABV beers. All of which are pleasant and easy to drink. Now I just need to get a damn fresh hopslam!"
"Not as aggressive as other porters, but very substantial nonetheless, and very solid, a great regular drinking porter (better than SN, not quite on part with GLBC or Founders)."
"The mouthfeel is above average (barely) with very small carbonation and a full body feel. Easy to drink but not exceptionally pleasant, I'd drink more of it but wouldn't seek out some at a bar."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is an extremely dark brown coloring, with a healthy, frothy, biege colored head that starts around the one inch mark and quickly settles into a sparse film. Aromas of coffee, sweet nut, and oak. The beer is light and crisp in mouth, and the flavors are light and creamy coffee, with a slight bittering at the end, with highlights of caramel sweetness. The increased levels of carbonation keep the beer light in mouth, and the finish is crisp and quick. The aftertaste is hazelnut coffee. This beer, although light, leaves a great lacing along the glass. Very tasty and light, making it way too easy to drink...good problem to have."
"Yum, another fantastic American Porter to add to my favorites. This one nails it in terms of malt aromas and flavors. The carbonation seems a bit weak on this bottle, but its a minor gripe. The beer is fantastic on the whole."
"This porter pours out with a nice black color, the head was thin and a light shade of brown. The smell of the beer was of roasted malts and some old wood. The taste was interesting, had a flavor in the aftertaste that I can't really describe. Other than that it was chocolatey and earthy. The mouthfeel was smooth and had a lighter body to it. Overall it's a really nice simle porter."
"O: Good. A solid porter."
"Super dark brown, almost black with a think creamy tan head that leaves thin foamy rings of lace. The smell is of dark chocolate and coffee. Pretty simple with some earthy notes. Taste has a robust roasted edge with coffee in the front, dark cocoa in the middle and coffee in the after tastes. Faint hint of vanilla and some earthy, grassy hops way in the back. Dominated with roast, slightly dry finish. Medium bodied, but a bit thin on the tounge. Overall, easy to drink and enjoyable porter."
"D/O- It's a good, solid porter but nothing to seek out with so many other examples of the style out there. Would be a good value and ""sessionable"" buy."
"O: Good Porter."
"Overall a solid, run-of-the-mill porter. An enjoyable enough drink, but nothing too special. I was hoping for something a bit more ambitious from Bell's."
"Pours a dark brown body with a huge creamy-off-white head. Body let through no highlights when held up to light. Smells like roasted coffee and chocolate. Lots of potent roasted malt is the best feature of this beer. Feel is thinner than i would prefer but thats okay. mmm."
"O - i would classify this among the best of the porters i have tried, but i'll admit that's not very many. i do know the difference between a bad beer and a good one however and this is most definitely the latter"
"o - This is a really nice porter. I find most to be a bit lackluster and lacking in body, but this one is vibrant and chocolatey with a great roasted malt. Bell's does it again. I'm a fan of porters and this one is near the top of the pack for the one's I've tried and it doesn't have any smoke or other gimmick to make the style more appealing...this is classic porter done right."
"Solid porter, nothing special but good overall."
"Beautiful cratery head on the pour, with a roasted/chocolate nose. There's hazelnut, chocolate, and a lot of roasted bitterness in the taste. Some coffee and hops show up halfway through the glass, and the mouthfeel is very smooth--a very quaffable, even sessionable porter."
"Overall, I think this porter tries too hard."
"Nutty mouthfeel, coffee malts, nothing imperialized, a good commoner porter, sessionable, goes good with hockey. Good carbonation keeps the beer lively and light relative to its color."
"A good go-to beer, when the selection is limited."
"Overall: A decent version of a porter."
"The taste of the porter has hints of chocolate, coffee and sweet malt. There is a nice amount of oily hop bitterness. This is the most drinkable American Porter I have had- very good."
"You can do much worse than to drink a bunch of these."
"Overall - A good porter and a good representation of what a decent porter should be. Although the smells are a little muted, it comes through in the taste."
"Conclusion: it was a borderline average porter. It was a little thin on taste for a porter. For a craft brewery, this was well below par. This was the kind of beer someone could have on any day for any occasion. Nothing really memorable.I probably wouldn't purchase this again. It was too thin and there are better porters for the same price range."
"When you drink this beer you know you're drinking a porter. You don't have to ask yourself ""is this a stout?"" Overall I'm impressed and will be drinking this one again."
"A very solid porter. Tasty and refreshing."
"O - I didn't mind this one, but it seemed a little weak in comparison to other porters that I have had."
"overall: a pretty decent porter, a touch bland, but nothing is off about it. i prolly wont buy this again."
"D: Not the worst porter I've had, but not even close to the best. A bit of a disappointment from Bell's."
"Pours a dark black with a substantail tan foam head that has little retention. Nose is burnt chocolate malts. Roasted and smokey with a slight hop presence. Not as much substance in flavour following the auroma. Has a sort of fizzy weak coffee malt flavour that tastes watery. Mouthfeel is left dry, perhaps over carbonated. Overall, good abv range and easily handled but left me desiring more."
"Poured very dark brown/black, barely transparent, with a finger of tan foam that dissipated quickly with little lacing. Smelled strongly roasted coffee with hints of chocolate- sort of a mocha smell. Medium in mouthfeel, kind of creamy but not heavy at all. Great tasted- lots of roasted malt and smokiness with a little bit of sweetness and a little bit of bitterness. Well-balanced. Finishes nicely. Went down very easily- too bad I only I had one in my mixpack, I could have easily had a few of these!"
"Overall, this is a good porter. The flavor is rich and complex with the dark roasted tones that one would expect from a good porter."
"O: I'm pretty sure that I could finish a six pack of this in an evening. Bell's Porter goes down easy and is a pleasure to drink. If in the Nashville market, this would be a go to porter for certain."
"My buddy left this one behind in my fridge. Poured a dark brownish black color with lots of tightly carbonated beige head. Not a whole lot on the nose, just malt and not overpowering. Taste is pretty bland in my opinion. Lots of malt, slight smokiness and slightly bitter finish. Not bad though. Medium-full body and very smooth going down. Good mouthfeel and very drinkable. A good beer overall."
"A good, true to style porter. Easy to drink, perhaps a bit thin, and the chocolate notes are very welcomed. Silky smooth, basic, but recommended."
"Poured a very dark brown with a slightly offwhite head. Smells pretty malty, nothing that stands out too much to my nose. A slight chocolate malt taste. It seemed like the first couple sips of the beer weren't as good as the rest of the glass. Almost like my taste buds needed time to adjust, or maybe the beer was better a few degrees above fridge temperature. It seemed a little thin feeling in my mouth. A pretty good beer for me, I suppose."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable, but not terribly complex. Good brew in general."
"This a typical American porter. Fairly easy to drink, but doesn't amaze by any means."
"Overall a VERY tasty Porter, so smooth going down you just may not want to stop drinking it."
"D - very high, easy drinking classic example of a porter"
"Drinkability: This beer is best consumed after it's sat a while, not only to warm up but also to flatten out. The chocolate starts to come through more as both aspects coax the flavor out. The after taste on this is lacking and it's not a sipper by any means. The beer isn't bad but I won't be going out of my way to get any in the near future. I'm glad to have tried it. I'm glad to have tried it and got a different look at the porter."
"Good beer."
"Drinkability: A very average porter. There is really nothing about this beer that stands out or separates it from other porters. While there's nothing inherently wrong with that, it doesn't make me particularly eager to recommend this beer or pick it up again myself. This falls squarely into the ""take it or leave it"" category."
"D - Smooth and drinkable, a solid example of a Porter."
"D - Easy to drink, 2-3 in a session would not be a problem. I feel that this is a very good representation of the style. I'll get this again when I can find it."
"D: Excellent drinkability. There's alcohol in this?? Delicious and balanced. Nice job Bell's."
"D: Not something I would necessarily rave about, but really great. I would get this one again when I can get it in trades."
"Bell's porter looks the standard mix of deep dark browns mixed with some black with a bit of seepage when up to light. A big inch of loose brown foam that left no stick, eventually died down. Smell is the standard porter roasted malt mixing in with some burnt and vanilla. Taste is roasted malt, vanilla, peat, chocolate, slight bitter coffee. Feel is a bit thin, I would say a step under medium, it needs a boost. Carb is adaquate but lacking as well. I drank it and next time I'll opt for a Founder's porter. The feel kinda kills this one for me."
"D- very quaffable and easy going. I guess I'm looking for a bit more out of my porters. Good stuff just not great."
"D -- Very solid offering, worth a pickup or ten. Very drinkable."
"Supple feel, signature roast with coffee and bakers chocolate notes. Little to no bitterness, creamy and smooth body with mellow carbonation. Lingering flavor of dry roast in the aftertaste. Extremely drinkable, flavorful and well-rounded. Many so-called extreme beers pale in comparison to this classic Porter."
"D: A good drinking beer. Goes down easy, and is especially good with food."
"D- Very easy to drink. A decent brew from Bell's but it didn't seem deserving to put this with their BIG brews. All in all very nice still."
"Pours a dark walnut in color, with an offwhite head that eventually fades to a ring and leaves some slight lacing. Smells slightly sweet and earthy, with a hint of roastiness and some aromas of brown bread. The taste is similar. On the lighter side for the style, but very well balanced and with a long, slightly bitter, and slightly peppery finish that exhibits roasty notes and some earthy depth. Smooth, and although somewhat light bodied, it has a long finish. Quite good."
"When the beer hits your mouth, it's sharp - not in a hoppy way, but in a way that's more aggressive than most porters are comfortable being. But the mouthfeel is great; a near-perfect level of carbonation filled with coffee and burnt chocolate. The drinkability is also top-notch but loses a point because it's so filling. I feel like I'm ready for a nap after a bottle and a half."
"D: Nice porter, could drink more than a few with ease. Great taste and body. Check it out."
"Deep black with a hint of dark brown on the edges. Poured with a brief foamy beige head with no retention, but ample wet lacings on the glass. Roasted, nutty aroma with hints of chocolate and coffee. Medium bodied and very smooth with light carbonation. Dark toasted malt flavor throughout with dark fruity middle and a bittersweet chocolate and roasted coffee finish. A touch of hoppy bitterness slips in at the finish as well. Very smooth and easy to drink."
"Drinkability: A very nice solid chocolaty porter that smells great. I could have three or four easily. The more I drink Bells beers, I find that they excel in taking basic styles and making them amazing beers. This is no exception to that rule."
"The beer pours a deep dark brown with ruby glow when held to a bright light. The head is moderate and clingy, off-white, good lacing. The aroma is moderate-high malt--mainly chocolate and a bit nutty/biscuity. The flavor is moderately malty -- a little roast, definitely chocolate and just a bit of dryness and hop bitterness at the swallow. The mouthfeel is smooth, body is just short of medium, finish just a bit of lingering malt, and moderate carbonation. Overall very good but not an overly special porter."
"D: Very drinkable. Relatively light body, with strong, but not aggressive flavors. Nothing is overdone, and all the flavors are kept nice and simple, playing well off each other. It opens up well."
"D: very drinkable at 5.6 abv. could have a couple without much problem."
"Notes: very balanced, drinkable porter with no one ingredient overwhelming"
"This is one of the first craft brews that I really liked and I still find it quite tasty. It is a drinkable porter with a nice mix of flavors. Bell's Porter is definitely a nice American example of the style."
"d - A nice porter. I liked the smell a lot and the taste was still pretty good. I wish the taste had less coffee as that slightly dominated the other tastes, but would certainly have again."
"Poured dark and smelled of rotting fruit, burnt coffee, and somehting sour and acidic. Smallish head that disappeared quickly. I manage to get a few sips in before it was dumped down the drain. This piss water is overwhelm with sourness and alcohol. Worst tasting beer I've ever had, zero drinkability."
"Overall: A really good porter. Very drinkable with lots of flavor."
"D: Not quite an amazing porter, but quite good. Solid in all aspects."
"Nice dark brown nearly black color with a thin tan head. Leaves a little bit of lacing and the head is pretty fine. Head's gone after about 3 minutes leaving a few islands on the surface. It's a shame because the first few sips were my favorite. Very strong chocolate/coffee smell, it's refreshing and lingers for a while. Taste is excellent. This is what I want when I get a porter. Sweet smoked chocolate and coffee malts give way to a quick bitter ending with a pleasant aftertaste. Nothing is overpowering and everything seems to be in a good balance. It's a lighter bodied porter with some mild carbonation but it is very good. If I'm in the mood for a porter, this is the first thing I'm looking for."
"Pours a mahogany red to black body with an off white head that has good retention, good carbonation and excellent lacing to it. The smell is chocolate mixed with coffee, and some hops. The taste is a mild taste of chocolate at first, than the coffee kicks in followed by some hops and raisins. The aftertaste reminds me of chocolate covered raisins. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, and even though I have only tasted four or five porters in my life and am fairly new to the style I'll admit that this is the smoothest and most drinkable one I've had so far."
"D - Rates high on drinkability. It is so smooth that you can easily drink several."
"Notes: Just as much as I was impressed with the Java Stout (just reviewed it) I am disappointed with this one, far inferior to many, many other porters available to me (Not just the great Edmund Fitzgerald, but others too)."
"The bottom Line: A damn good porter. Please give it a try if it's available in your area. Have a good one."
"D: Very drinkable; I could easily put a few of these away in a night."
"Hopefully this brew won't have too bitter a taste thanks to my Bears really getting their asses handed back to them against the Pats. It pours a deep ruby brown topped by a short finger of ecru foam. The nose comprises light roasted malts, a very light hickory smoke, brown sugar, light molasses, and a good helping of black pepper. The taste goes a bit heavier on the pepper and smoke (less of the latter) and adds some mild greens, but, beyond that, everything from the nose returns on the tongue. The body is a lithe medium, with a moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a very nice porter, but a bit too dry and fizzy for me to really get into it. other than that, though, it's pretty solid."
"D: Good drinkability. A nice, straightforward porter."
"Bell's Porter 12oz poured into nonic pint. Pours very dark with small head. Aroma of smokey chocolate, malt, coffee and hops. Smooth mouthfeel, Balanced flavor of malt, hops, cocoa and coffee with a touch of smoke. Exceptionally easy to drink porter, up there and comparable to GLEFP in flavor and mouthfeel."
"The guy below me has it right: not quite Edmund Fitz or Blake Butte but this one is one of the supeb examples of the style."
"Drinkable- More than you'd expect,I'd hav no objection to some more"
"This beer pours a thick black color, with an off white head. You can sort of pick up an amber hue in it, but for the most part you cant see through it at all. The aroma is of smokey, roasted malt. The flavor is light and yet has a balanced delicate roasted flavor to it. The mouthfeel is thick and the taste is light. Overall a very good beer."
"Drinkability: Awesome for my group of friends but only for a demographic of series beer drinkers"
"Overall, a real disappointment."
"Nice chocolate appearance, typical of porters. Wonderful mild chocolate nose, coffee undertones. Milder taste, not overwhelmingly bitter like many porters, the coffee flavor sets in late as it warms a little. Light body for a porter, lingering coffee malt. Simple and tasty, bitter but mild."
"D - The drinkability is good. It goes down easy, and leaves you wanting more. This is a good porter, it is better than quite a few I have had in the past. I would pick it up again."
"A dark brown color with a reddish hue along the sides of the glass, with a beige colored head. The head is a quatrer inch high and it stays there for some time. A roasted malt aroma with touches of chocolate and coffee, with a touch of molasses at the end. The chocolate, coffee, and roasted flavors dominate the taste, then a strong bitterness with some grass and pine flavors, but mostly a lactic bitter flavor. A slightly watery feel that grows to more medium bodied feel. The finish is dry to the point you pucker your lips. This by far one of the best porters I have ever had, the classic color and rosty aroma. A flavor that leaves you wanting more and a feel that cleans the palate. The sad part, is the empty glass."
"D- Not the best porter I've had, but it certainly is easy to drink and the availability make this great!"
"Tis the season for some good porters! First time having this brew and it did not disappoint. Lots of sweet and roasted flavors flood the palate. Coffee, vanilla, chocolate, caramel and a little molasses. Finishes pretty clean with a slight hop bitterness. Aroma follows suite with roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate and caramel. Deep dark brown with a little amber on the edge. Medium body with a little creaminess to it. Very solid porter for the upcoming winter months. Another top notch brew from Bells."
"Despite being pretty decent overall, it drinks below average. Unlikely that I'll revisit this beer after the sixer is gone."
"D - Perhaps a tad too roasted for a porter. Would like to see more caramel to compliment the roast and the bitterness in the dark chocolate. Still, a delicious brew that drinks well, especially on a chilly night."
"Nice companion to my dinner of spicy Kowalski Hunters Brand Hot Sausage, with a Ghirardelli raspberry-stuffed dark chocolate for dessert."
"Drinkability - I think this is a very, very solid Porter. I like it. Warming and inviting. Porters are quickly becoming a favorite type of brew of mine and this is one I will have to revert back to on occasion."
"Drinkability is OK for the style, but not as smooth as some of the best."
"Notes: A solid porter. Plenty of roasted flavors, but also a strong nutty/earthy/spicy flavor. What I expect and enjoy in a porter is well presented in this beer. Definitely worth a try."
"12oz bottle poured into my Darkness glass...A boring pour low carbonation of a very light tan head with little retention or lacing. The beer is a dark brown not a ton to look at...The aroma explodes with flavor, tons of roasted coffee, a touch of vanilla and a little alcohol. Its pretty nice, but the coffee is a little too roasted, the aroma of burnt 2 day old coffee is a turn off...The taste loses the harshness of the coffee and displays as a light drinkable porter with a hint of roasted coffee."
"While I would drink this beer again, if it was the the only dark offering, there are many better porters that I would take gladly in it's place."
"O: Solid if not spectacular offering. Worth having around the house."
"D - I wouldn't be putting these down like mad, but it is a good beer. Flavorful but not too strong or big."
"D- Yeah, it's decent and I could drink more, but for my money I'd place this back on the shelf and pick up an Eddy Fitz."
"dark brown color with off white/tan head. roasted malt in the smell and not much else. taste is more of the same, with light toffee/caramel notes. mouthfeel is thick and creamy. drinkable and good, yet unremarkable porter. Nice ""lighter"" option to a big RIS."
"Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Overall I love this porter and it's easily the best American Porter i have had. This beer will always have a spot in my fridge. A top notch beer from a top notch brewer."
"Drinkabilty - Very high, this is a good starter porter. Very easy to drink 3-5 of these with lower alcohol and its mildness. Theres better porters out this with more kick and flavors, but this is overall solid."
"Pours dark black with a thin tan head and a ring of lacing. Smells of chocolate malts and coffee. Really sweet. Tastes of chocolate malts, coffee, toffee, caramel, and enough hops to mellow out any sweetness. Mouthfeel is really nice and drinkability is really good. A really good offering from Bell's."
"Pours jet black with minimal cocoa powder head. Smells very much like dark chocolate roast with a hint of coffee. Taste is rather the same but the coffee is more prominent. This is a very light porter but still just feels so thick. Little hard to get down without feeling full but a goody for the cold winter months."
"As I got to the end of this one I noticed some sediment had settled on the bottom of the glass. No matter though; this was a tasty porter, and I'd gladly come back to it. Mmmmm."
"D- This beer is good but not what I'm looking for in a porter. Bell's tends to make a good beer but this one is a little bit of miss if you ask me. Oh well...can't do everything right all the time."
"Drink well my friends"
"Bells has brewed an excellent porter, very drinkable!"
"DB- A lot of caramel, the bottle is just a bit old. I will review this one again, just like the Java Stout. I guess I have bad luck with Bell's in Philadelphia. Still good stuff."
"Mouth is full bodied.Great retention as it wanders the palate. Velevety texture and stays smooth all the way down the hatch."
"Batch 9889, bottled on 7/16 pours a very dark brown with a nice cola colored head that retains well and leaves nice lacing. The aroma is mostly roasty, with notes of espresso, molasses, burnt bread, licorice, dark chocolate, a bit of dark fruit, some slight floral hops and alcohol. The flavor is similarly roasty, with espresso and dark chocolate upfront, along with some blackstrap molasses, burnt bread, dark fruits, floral hops, and a touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is smooth and appropriately light, and drinkability is very good. A pretty straightforward porter that isn't particularly complex but is executed impeccably."
"Fairly drinkable, a decent porter, but not in the same league as Founder's or Great Lakes."
"A simple but enjoyable porter. A very nice year-round offering from Bell's. Recommended."
"So delicious, so drinkable. By far one of the top beers we have run into this year. Larry, come to Boston. We'll treat you extremely well. As for the lucky folks who can get this on a regular basis, we are more than envious."
"A decent porter. nothing to run out and buy asap. doubt i'll ever get it again, but i wouldn't turn it down if offered. one if perfectly fine."
"M & D - Nice and carbonated. Smooth and delicious with good ABV."
"Drinkability: It's a nice beer for sipping or with a meal (complimented a grilled ham and cheese nicely). I have other favorite porters though...but still this one I think would be good with other meals and I may need to consider it again."
"OVERALL: Enjoyable and definitely drinkable, but pretty average for the style. One I'd have a few of at the pub, but nothing overly snazzy. A solid beer from a solid brewery. Thanks again for bringing this one home guys."
"Bells porter poured a very dark brown with a large tan head. It smells a bit smoked and heavy. It tasted a bit smoked a bit harsh, really couldnt detect any flavors outside the porter taste. The flavor is a bit harsh and a bit watery, but not too much. Not too difficult to drink. Overall a pretty good no nonsense beer."
"D: Very drinkable. A good porter, though it could be a little more assertive. If you're going for a Bell's dark beer, I would recommend the Kalamazoo Stout or the exceptional Expedition Stout instead, but the Porter is never a poor choice."
"Opaquely dark brown at first glance. Deep ruby hue when held up to light. Smells moderately roasty and watery in an odd way. Some toffee and dark chocolate notes round things out. Still kind of watery in the taste. The roasted malt flavor is ratcheted up. Bittersweet chocolate comes through in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is lacking anything interesting. A very easy drinking porter overall."
"An extremely drinkable and session-worthy porter that does not skimp on the flavor."
"I'm might go out on a limb and say that this is one of my favorite porters now. We can't get it down south, but I was able to snag a bottle while I was in Tampa. The aromas are malty with hints of nuts and dried fruits, such as dates and raisins. The taste is creamy with a nice balance in the carbonation. I'll definitely pick up another bottle"
"A fairly average porter, not very rich or remarkable. Smells pretty nice, that's probably the best part."
"Overall I was a fan of this however I wish I'd caught it a bit later to see how it developed in the firkin. Either way, a solid porter that's worth a shot."
"All in all, this is a decent brew. Nothing to write home about, but decent. Maybe worth one try if you have access, but not worth hunting or going out of your way for. Many better in the style."
"A decent porter, but nothing outstanding. There are many others I'd rather have."
"D- Not a bad beer, was one of the only ones on the list at Bell's that I had not drank before, and I was not disappointed that I tried it. Would not be my first choice of beer but overall it is another solid offering from one of the best breweries in the country."
"It's not bad. I wouldn't turn it down if somebody handed me a bottle, yet nor do I plan on returning to the store to buy more. So it's an average brew, this porter from Bell's is."
"I'm so glad I get the opportunity give this beer a second try, since the first one I had was highly infected(very sour). Now, thanks to BucketBoy, I get to give this one a second go. Appearance is very dark but has a very dark amber color around the edges of the glass when held to light. Very nice inch and a half frothy, off-white head. Smell is very nice. A lot of coffee notes. There is also a bit of burnt smelling notes to this as well. I also get a bit of bittering hops. Immediately after sipping, I'm picking up coffee and sweet chocolate. Don't wanna say dark chocolate, because the taste isn't very bitter. Amazing mouthfeel...not too heavy, not too light (like a lot of other non-imperial porters I've had). There is some pretty nice lacing on this beer as well. Drinkability is very solid. Great beer!"
"D - This is a solid, not-spectacular porter that doesn't do anything bad and is an enjoyable drink. It's not special, but a good beer that I can have a good time drinking."
"As far as look and feel, Bell's porter is one of the better offering that I have had on cask. The flavor is also pretty good, although the sourness is a little bit surprising."
"Not overly impressed by this one, but it is tasty enough and very drinkable."
"D: a great brew to have on cask. I highly recommend the experience."
"Overall, I think I prefer this out of the bottle or off of a normal tap. As much as I like cask beer, I don't think it did a whole lot beneficial here."
"This is the only beer from Bell's that I have ever had that did not meet expectations for the style."
"D - Didn't finish this one. This is the only Bell's beer I've had that I haven't liked and to say that I didn't like this one is an understatement. Very disappointing."
"i enjoyed this porter, although not my favorite porter, it did satisfy my want for one. smelled strongly of roasted malts and tasted of it. the taste tended to linger with me, which i liked. it poured a dark brown to black, with a decent head on it. it hit the spot when i was looking for a full beer. all and all a very satisfying beer."
"Pour is very dark brown (mahogany and ruby when held up to lights) with about a finger of rich tan head. There also appears to be some yeast floating around in the glass. The smell is pretty vague. There's a light bitter chocolate and dark fruit smell. I had to really search for the chocolate. Taste is much better than the smell. There's a fig, raisin, and prune taste that I really dig. There's also cocoa. I've gotta admit, I'm really not tasting the coffee that others have referred to. However, I get a leaf tobacco (like Levi Garrett) that lingers after the finish."
"Worth finding again."
"Beer poured a dark brown with a tan head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose is malty with a hint of coffee and floral hops. Taste is well balanced, slightly sweet malts with a hint of coffee balances nicely with a light hop finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and fairly smooth. Overall drinkability is very good. This is a very sessionable beer that is not overly complex but yet has enough going on to keep your interest. Glad i had the chance to try!"
"Notes - This is probably tied right now with Fullers London Porter as my favorite porter."
"You can drink these all day!"
"Porters can be solid drinking, session beers and this one does not dissapoint."
"My conclusion...I love Bell's beer. But this one kinda let me down. OK, it straight up let me down big time. I like a good porter but this didn't deliver for me. I'm a big time hophead and I'll tell you what, their Hopslam and Two Hearted Ale are amazing. I'll stick to those since this obviously wasn't even on that level at all."
"M/D - Thin mouthfeel especially toward the end, flavor lingers a bit. Very easy to drink, tasty, overall nice brew."
"Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is on the thicker side with below average carbonation. Drinkability is very good, it's a very well made and good tasting porter. Overall it's nothing fancy, just a very good all around porter."
"Good, but a middle-of-the-pack porter overall."
"D - way doin on the list. I will probably not buy another."
"D - I love Bell's but this is not one of my favorites, it is just average overall, Bell's can do a lot better than this."
"Pours like any other porter, dark coffee color body and a thick ""khaki"" head. Aroma was a little lighter that what I expected, but there were hints of cocoa and sweet roasted malts. Taste was a bit weak. I got more cocoa than roasted malts, but neither was robust. Decent carbonation, but a little too thin/watery. As a beer, very drinkable. But there are better porters out there."
"D: Not terribly impressed. Not sure if this beer is starting to go off or not. Seems fairly light and unsophisticated with an odd (off?) flavor of pineapple. Seems to have potential and may try to give it another chance, but there are much better porters out there."
"I don't know if I love you. Which pretty much means I don't love you. I never found out what you were hiding from me. But I would screw you on an odd Tuesday night if you were the only one in the bar."
"D= Pretty good. While the porter is one of my favorite styles this one is pretty average. Not bad by any means but there are a lot of porters that I would rather have. Bell's never lets down and this is no exception but this porter is just too basic. Summit's Great Northern Porter is still my go to for the style."
"Flavors are thin bitter grapefruit and thin bitter espresso but with a citrus character and acidity that detracts. Thin all around."

"Just bought this at Sun Devil in Mesa, AZ, on their new display out front. Too bad this is such a horrific beer. Pours a thinnish brown with minimal head. Smells of smoke and burnt coffee. Tastes of coffee, but with a horrible sour taste. I was able to take about three swallows before this went down the drain. What a disaster of a beer."
"Overall, this is the type of porter I could get used too. Its dark and rich with an abv that makes it quite drinkable."
"this is one of my default ""go to"" beers, a rock solid example of an american style porter."
"A: Creamy layer of thick head which stuck around for a while and left tons of lacing in its wake, the color is an extremely dark espresso brown bordering on black, little to no light passes through the beer except at the very edge of the glass -4.50, S: Strong aromas of a dark chocolate and coffee, heavy on the specialty grains specifically black patent , possibly some hints of licorice and a touch of ash - 4.50, T: Dark and bitter coffee is the most prominent part of the flavor profile, the alcohol also makes a showing but not to the point of being off-putting, the hops are also quite evident and provide a nice bite, grapefruit pith and an earthy woodiness- 4.25, M: The mouth feel is a little thinner than I'd expect though there is a nice creaminess on the palate - 4.00, D: Porter's are not generally a beer to which I gravitate but this is one that really changes my opinion of what a porter is, easily one of the better porters I've had - 4.25"
"HV"
"Great robust porter. I can't find any fault, except we don't get Bell's in Colorado."
"The body is medium with a good fizzy and chalky feel. Nothing wrong with this one, good solid beer."
"Drinkability? This is an easy one to sit down and drink multiple bottles of. Seiing as this is my only bottle, that won't work for me but folks who have access to this sure can and should. A very nice brew."
"D: What can I say? Bell's doesn't make a beer that isn't highly drinkable. For the porter lovers though."
"Dark brown with light through the edges , decent head and little lacing. faint smell with some roast qualities and sweet malt. Roasted malt is the most prominent flavor, that fades into a caramel sweetness with some coffee notes. Thinner mouthfeel with a nice amount of carbination, easy to drink."
"D: Be careful, it goes down easy. With an excellent taste and wonderful texture you might even forget that beer is the wonderful beverage in your hand, but if you take your time drinking this one it will provide the gustatory pleasure many connoisseurs looks for in a beer."
"D- Really sessionable."
"M/D- Pretty good. Not a stellar porter by any means, but definitely very sessionable. Would buy again."
"Na Zdravje!"
"D: 1st bottle didn't last too long. After the initial tasting, the rest was quaffed like a light pils, on a hot summer day! Great beer.."
"http://mikesbrewreview.com/review-of-new-belgiums-1554-and-bells-porter/"
"Also I guessed the ABV was around 5 or 5.1 but was surprised to see a higher number! Smooth!"
"D: i like this beer but wish the could have amped it up on the body to match the carbonation and the dark flavors for color, but it is a daily drinker to be sure, consistent"
"Drinkability: Pretty easy to drink, and would be a great intro for those just getting into the world of dark beers, as the taste is reminiscent of an IPA with more of a nutty chocolate flavor. Not too complicated, but sometimes that's just what you need on a cold winter day in Michigan."
"F: FInishes a little drier but still slightly sweet, it has a nice earthy spicy bitter feel on the finish, and almost that clean mouth feel you get from higher abv beers. The lingering bitter stouty roasted flavor remains for a bit."
"3/2011 I went to it again, B+? It's damn good might be pushing A-?"
"D: This would make a great session porter. Smooth taste without a killer body. Three to four in a sitting would be no problem."
"Pours nearly black with brown head. Roasty aromas are present on the nose. On the palate there's a smoky quality that pairs with the roasty flavors as well. Some malt sweetness is there too, perhaps some spent coffee grounds also. Surprisingly drinkable for such a roasty porter."
"Mouthfeel is light but gritty. Drinkable, pleasant beer."
"Overall a nice easy drinking porter. Nothing special but not every beer can be."
"Poured this into a pint glass. Not a lot of head; about 1/4"" of tan foam. No lacing. The smell is sweet and smoky. The taste is typical porter with a smoky kick. I would normally like that a lot more but I was a little under-whelmed with this beer. It feels a lot like a stout. Nice malt character though with some biscuit notes. Very little carbonation, kinda makes you think of a flat coke. I don't want to be too negative about this beer though, I would drink it a lot if I had it around all the time. It still has a pleasant flavor and drinkability is good."
"D: very little carbonation, which is really nice because the beer is good enough on its own."
"Compared the Fuller's London porter I had last week, this one lacks the nuance and complexity of that product. However, this one is very flavorful and extremely quaffable; the ideal everyday porter."
"A medium mouthfeel, very smooth, not a lot of carbonation. Overall a very drinkable beer with a lot of flavor; a pretty solid porter."
"Very drinkable and would be a cold weather favorite of mine if it were easier to find. Another job well done from the guys at Bell's. Why can't I get this in Massachusetts?"
"Drinkability and Mouthfeel: Lighter than i expected but still filling. The beer is very crisp and easy to drink on the whole."
"Overall, this is a decent porter. I was expecting a little more, but it finishes very clean, leaving no aftertaste so it could definitely be a session beer."
"A solid American Porter great for everyday enjoyment."
"Drinkable due to the low abv, which I am finding more and more to be abnormal. a good standard porter"
"Poured a dark brown with offwhite head that sticks around a little and leaves some lace. A roasted and somewhat coffee malt smell with hints of caramel and a little floral hop bitterness. A mild sweetness in a light to medium body that is smooth, creamy and light. Very minor hoppy, fruity flavor and a tad bit of breadiness for a somewhat dry backbite. Passes easily and while a simplistic porter it is enjoyable."
"Taste-Coffee with cream,roasted malt, some hop notes-Creamy and very drinkable-A nice session beer, and a great every-day porter to have around"
"porur a deep brown/black color with a tan head and 1"" head//the smell is chocolate, molasses ,toffee and vanilla bean..the taste is the same it has some roasted coffee taste with some semi sweet chocolate and toffee and vanilla this is a good porter offering from bells tasty and smooth its drinkable and enjoyable"
"D: This is a very nice cold-weather session beer. The roasted malts sometimes is a bit overwhelming, but all in all this beer is quite drinkable."
"drinkability is great - a sessionable porter - how could i ever turn this one down"
"Almost completely black when poured into a glass mug. Beutifull thick frothy mocha colored head. This is a gorgeous looking beer. A lot of burnt chocoalty roasty notes in the nose. Smokey burnt toast flavor up front, the head adds a mellowing frothy bitersweet chocolatey flavor that balances nicely. A little hop bitterness, but mostly the smokey chocolate coffee richness takes over. Thick and creamy mouthfeel mostly from the foam that hangs around for the duration. It's like one of those creamy mocha coffee latte things you get at the coffee house. This is an excelent porter. It's not my favorite style, mainly because I feel like there's a beer milkshake in my gut after I drink it. Aside from that, the flavors of this beer are phenominal."
"D- A very session-able beer. These go down really easily. I really enjoy this porter."
"Given how smooth and creamy this guy is, it goes down real easy. Scary drinkable for the style."
"Pours deep brown with amber hues at the base of the glass. A tan frothy head and lots of lacing is noticeable. Nose is not overpowering but some roasted malts and coffee are noted. The palate picks up some hints of chocolate along with the chocolate. This brew is extremely smooth and delicious. Mouthfeel is fairly light and thin while drinkability is high. Will definitely put this on my list of beers to continue to stock in my DBF."
"In my opinion, Bell's Porter is the perfect example of the style - simple, yet delicious - and not all fancy, with vanilla / extra coffee / blah, blah, blah. Just a straight up good porter. Appearance is near black, yet a touch translucent, with a tidy, light brown head that leaves some decent lace on the glass. Smell is chocolatey, with some nice roasty aroma - not as smoky as some porters. Its definitely a tasty brew - almost stout-like, with the roasted/burned malt with hints of coffee and chocolate - yet the mouthfeel is lighter and its a pretty easy drinkin' ale. A nice one to have a few of on a cool fall night. Good stuff -"
"D: Supremely drinkable. This is EXACTLY what I think a porter should be. Packing much of the flavor punch of a stout in a more drinkable, lighter bodied beer. Bell's nailed it here. Anyone who considers himself a porter fan ought to eagerly seek this one out--it's top notch."
"Overall, an easy drinking porter."
"Notes: Nice offering on cask, feeling rather fresh and a bit raspy to the palate."
"D- Very good, but just never quite did it for me."
"MF&D - the body is light and carbonated, perhaps a bit too light for my taste, but it is still very close to the style. the drinkability is fine, except that there is nothign particularly special about this beer."
"Drinkability is high. This is a really well put together porter. I shouldn't be surprised, as Bell's is one of my favorite breweries. I'm gonna be buying more of this as the weather turns cold."
"cheers!"
"I am liking this one"
"Drinkability is fantastic - packed with flavor, yet with a relatively modest abv. Bells never fails to impress me."
"Conclusion: Really nice American porter; this is decently complex, nicely balanced, and supremely quaffable...this would probably be a strong A- beer, but the price (at around 9-10 bucks a sixer) is a bit on the high side for a session-style porter."
"This porter hits first with a slight hop bitterness that's faint and is soon overpowered by the malt character, which contains a light citrus fruitiness in addition. This leaves a slightly sweet taste on the tongue after it's done. The mouth feel is a little then but actually works well with the flavor. This isn't bad, but I have trouble with this knowing there are stouts around. It's not bad but I still have not fallen in love with this style."
"From the bottle to a pint glass, pours a very dark brown almost black hardly any head at all and it quickly vanishes. Little to no lacing down the glass. Roasty aroma, hints of chocolate and coffee sneaking through. Kind of sweet overall, a hint of caramel. Taste is very roasted. A hint of chocolate comes through followed by coffee. The aftertaste is dominated by coffee with a small hint of chocolate. No thickness here in the mouthfeel, it's fairly medium bodied. Not a high ABV so it's not noticeable. I do like porters though I'm not huge into them as I'd rather have a nice stout but this one is good. Easily drinkable and pretty good tasting."
"D- Pretty decent, just a good solid offering"
"D: This is a good tasting, smooth porter. Glad I picked up a 6er."
"Overall, a nice example of the style and were it available to me, it would be in my regular rotation."
"Drinkability - Pretty high. The middle of the range alcohol level and the silky body make this sure to please during a drinking session. The light taste leaves me considerably less than enamored, but those that prefer a less flavorful black beer may have found their new drinking mate."
"Nice and solid"
"D- Pretty easy to drink but not something I'd have more than one of in a sitting."
"smells very coffee like. malty and rich and chocolate flavored. decently bittered, but could use a bit more sweets. some nice woody taste, all roasted. nice and creamy feel, and nice to drink."
"Overall, a tasty beer. Not exactly sessionable as it's too strong and too thick, but having one on a cold winters night after shoveling would sound mighty good. I might even try it warm in that case..."
"This beer pours a dark brown with slight ruby highlights to it. One finger of tan head with decent retention, leaving nice sticky lacing on the glass. Nose is of major roasted malts with some muted coffee and chocolate in the background. Taste is driven by the roasted malts on this one, great roasted and toasted malts. Some bitter chocolate mingle with coffee flavoring but those are really just hints to the roasted malt flavoring. Medium body with moderate to high carbonation, somewhat creamy and a touch chewy. This is a beer one can sit with for a while."
"D- What it lacks in robustness, it makes up for in drinkability. I would be a happy man to session these. A great porter to session with."
"Pours a beautiful dark brown with 2 inch tan head formation. The pouring suggests a medium body, which is later confirmed. The head is persistent and settles in at 1.5 inches a flat, creamy top and plethora of micro-bubbles intermingled with larger cavities up to 1/8th inch. As you drink this ale the Belgian lace is well formed and decorative. The nose provides deep roasted notes. Hops are not evident. The porter has a medium body with a light cream texture. The suggestive chocolate and coffee notes join the maltyness, making the ale very nicely balanced. Carbonation is pleasant. The alcohol is moderate and not noticeable on the palate. Combined with delicious lingering this porter definitely invites repeat tastes. Another moreish ale! Light enough to be a restorative and a refresher, yet full enough of flavor to satisfy most any palate."
"Poured into a pint glass, pours a pitch black with a bit of fluff and lace. Smell is sweet malt and roasted oats with a bit of chocolate. Taste is just like nose with hints of burnt dark chocolate and a nice slite sour bitterness towards the finish. Overall a good porter but not a favorite of mine."
"I love the simplicity of this porter. It is a classic quality which makes it very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Overall a great beer, although I prefer the Edmond Fitgerald."
"Dark brown with a finger of sand colored head that leaves some fine lace behind on the glass. Aromas of bittersweet chocolate, molasses and roasted malt in the nose. Nice roasted malt with a decidedly chocolatey flavor and a touch of anise in the finish. Light bodied and crisply carbonated. A solid porter."
"Another great beer from bells that I'd be glad to pick up again."
"Nice dark coca-cola color. Good carbonation, showed a decent head that didn't last long. I could taste coffee and a little bit of chocolate, but it felt watery to me. Overall, it was a respectable porter and I could drink a half dozen of them, but will look for better instead."
"Pours a medium black color with a nice thick one and a half finger head that gave way to some nice lacing. The aroma is of chocolate and roasted malts. The taste is of roasted malts, coffee, and some chocolate. The mouthfeel had a moderate amount of carbonation. The drinkability is very high. This is a solid porter that isn't very thick and goes down light and smooth."
"Drinkability: Another solid offering from Bell's, it's a good looking beer with a bit of a weak nose and flavors that don't quite live up to other offerings. As a porter, of course, it's a little heavier in body, but the ABV isn't too bad so I wouldn't mind sitting through a couple of these."
"Drinkability: A very good beer. It's a little filling which makes it hard to drink a whole lot, but definitely worthy."
"Overall a very easy drinking brew."
"D - This was one of my favorite Porters, the taste and the body was exactly how I like them, hopefully Bell's will see it in their heart to open up to our market"
"Fairly thin body full of nice roast and moderate sweetness. Lots of malt - a nutty base with a major vein of chocolate roast and some minor very dark roast. Creaminess in malt and body. Moderate tart/sourness - kind of fruity. Powdery dryness. Finishes dry with soft nuttiness and a kiss of chocolate. Tastes good. Feels good. Good drinkability."
"D: High, but the saltiness would eventually get to me."
"Deep dark brown color, redish around the edges. Pours with a nice 3/4 inch head that is slightly tanned. Has a bit of lacing. Initially this beer smells like yeast and I don't pick up much more from it in the scent department other than trace bits of coffee. (More chocolate/coffee scent comes through as you come close to finishing the beer.) Taste is kinda bland, very minor chocolate and coffee notes but I keep feeling like this beer seems to be watered down. Not much carbination, mouthfeel is ok but nothing exciting. It is well balanced and I gotta admit it is easy drinking but I am not as excited about it as I was the other products from Bells which is surprising because I am a big fan of porter."
"The mouthfeel is again, just a touch too thin...but drinkability is nice, goes down quite well."
"Pours a dark, barely transparent Coca-Cola brown with a decent but not too persistent beige head. Aroma is smoky with hints of coffee yeast and unsweetened chocolate. Mouth-filling flavor is much like the aroma, mainly smoky with some malt and tones of coffee and chocolate, no sweetness. Texture is lively and smooth, leaving a refreshing and lip-smacking finish."
"I generally like porter, and this is one of the better ones I've had."
"Notes: This was my number one, if-I-can-drink-anything beer while I was in undergrad in mid-Michigan over ten years ago. Trying it now, I'm relieved that I had good taste back then."
"Medium bodied, a touch on the light side, and smooth and creamy. Rich without being heavy or thick. Somewhat drying in the finish, and ever-so-slightly chalky, which works wonderfully with the flavors present. I've finished nearly half the beer just trying to nail down exactly what I'm experiencing, and I can't believe it's gone so quickly. Highly drinkable."
"D- Overall, this is a very tasty that I would definitely purchase again when I am in the mood for a Porter. Recommended!"
"Still have yet to have a bad beer from Bell's. I thought this blew away the Edmund Fitz and has now become one of my favorite porters. Great beer."
"Overall: Great drinkability, delicious flavors but the mouthfeel doesn't match. Easy to drink because of the lighter mouthfeel but does not satisfy like a thicker/creamier porter does."
"Quite a good example of a porter. I support this one entirely!"
"D: This is a well-made, drinkable porter. Very solidly constructed and easy to drink."
"mmm, yummmm, good porter. Poured with a tan, foamy, frothy, creamy, textured head that really lasts and a little lace. Color is a very dark mahogoney with cherry highlights. Aroma is chocolate, coffee, malt, a little toastiness, and a hint of dark ripe fruit such as dates or prunes. Flavor's about the same. Great body; nice and creamy not too much so. Very good finish. Session beer for sure."
"Drinkability: sipper- a beginners porter. Meant to savor. Nice when it warms up a little bit."
"Drinkability: very good porter, but not surprise coming from Bell's."
"Pours out a dark red color, with some dark brown, almost looks black in the glass with some dark ruby highlights. There's a cm thick head with loose bubbles that fell down into a little ring and left just a little bit of lacing. Looks just like most other porters. The smell is about what I would expect as well. Some coffee, dark chocolate, just a little bit of cola like sweetness. Nothing intense or too incredible. This doesn't set itself apart in the smell. But the taste is what amazes me. I mean, everything that a porter should be, this is. And there's not a thing to upset me here. There's immediately a dark chocolate bite, with a bit of a syrupy caramel taste underneath. Then the coffee notes hit, and burst with the carbonation, very pleasant. There's almost a creaminess to it, which is enhanced while there's still a head. I really like this in the taste department. I mean, just perfect for a porter. The mouthfeel is nice. Fairly low carbonation, right in line with what I want. Not a stand out, though its hard to stand out in this style I think. Of course this was a perfectly enjoyable drink. I mean, I would recommend it as a top-notch porter. If you see it, remember that it isn't an imperial anything, but it's a perfectly lovable beer. I will probably buy more in the future."
" leniently if I hadn't been expecting so much."
"Drinkability: Middle of the road Porter. Drinkable enough. Like their Kalamazoo Stout, but with some of its unique character stripped away."
"i got this as part of a mixed Bell's case, so i have 5 more of these to drink....not that i won't drink them, but i may over look it for another option in my fridge"
"D: Pretty high, this is a darn good and easy drinking beer."
"M/D - quite thin, very drinkable. Its a decent beer"
"Another good beer from Bell's. Like I have written before, I'm not sure you can really mess up a porter."
"Drinkability - A decent porter, drinkable."
"D: Very drinkable at about 5 and a half percent. I put it down rather quickly. But I was thinking of the Smuttynose Robust Porter and trying to figure out which I'd pick for a six pack purchase, and it's a toss up. Bell's is great and I appreciate this offering, but it's not iconic or a ""must have."""
"Each beer I drink transports me somewhere, and with a Porter, I expect that place to be dark and heavy. Bell's Porter invoked, in me, a brightly lit grocery store soda aisle."
"Another solid beer from Bells."
"Drinkability- A decent sipper. Not bad to have around."
"Mouthfeel is creamy smooth. Very pleasant mouth on this beer. Flavor is of faint cocoa, potato bread, and finishes slightly sweet like an oatmeal cookie. Not a bold porter by any means, but it's solid. Wonderfully drinkable."
"Totally drinkable porter. Another solid offering from Bell's."
"D- Pretty good brew that could have toned down the smoke flavor just a tad."
"Very solid all around, worth having again."
"D: Very good! Good flavors going on and not too much alcohol combined with the smoothness of the cask condition makes this very enjoyable."
"Maybe it's because I've been drinking Smuttynose's Robust Porter lately, but this Porter seems more like a dark Brown Ale. I won't knock it too much for being subtle though, there's nothing wrong with that. Try it for yourself."
"All in all my second favorite porter I can remember."
"The smell of this Bell's brew is simply magical. A great beer from Bell's. The appearance is wonderful, poured into my Sam Adams Sensory Glass with a frothy head from the Sam Adams tag line on the glass to up and over the top bead of the glass. The beer is much better as it warms up as I've found in drinking a couple of these in the last week. But I'm wondering if this is the freshest porter possible from Bell's, because I find this batch was made on Sept. 5, 2008 (batch # 8726). I purchased the 6 pack at Mid-Town Liquors in Bridgman, MI on March 14, 2009 so I'm a bit surprised to get a porter made 6 1/2 months earlier. Still, I enjoy porters so the review must go on. Not quite as good as Founder's Porter, which is in a league of its own, but this Bell's brew holds its own with a rich, delectable smell and taste. Obviously, age hasn't affected this porter. Thanks Bell's for a great beer."
"mid to full body. good carbonation. great beer. i will grab a six again."
"D: Fairly drinkable. Sort of a heavy mouthfeel to drink a lot of, but not bad for a porter in that department."
"Overall, I really liked this porter, very warm flavor."
"This beer looks good, smells good and is smooth from the moment you pop the top til after you swallow. Not highly alcoholic (5.6%), this is a beer you don't mind drinking a lot of on a winter night."
"Good medium bodied porter, creamy and smooth while giving you a bit of a carbonation burn. All around good drinkable porter. I am impressed."
"Pours an excellent dark brown/black color, with some great initial, tan head, that diminishes to a still nice thin head, with some very nice lacing to it. Great scent, semi-sweet, but a huge amount of burnt grains and a smidge of chocolate. Excellent taste, as well, nice and thick, great burnt grains without going overboard. It goes down very, very smoothly. This was a great porter."
"Bells Porter poured a nice dark brown with a very nice tan head, good lacing as well. The smell was oddly faint. I could only barely smell hints of coffee, and hops. The taste of this porter was very full however, not like the nose at all. It was full of roasted coffee, and bittersweet chocolate. Mouthfeel was good. Also this had very nice drinkability. This was a very nice porter. I will buy this beer again."
"Drinkability was very good. The alcohol was not noticeable at all. Overall, this was a treat to drink. On cask, I would put it up with some of my favorite English porters (Sam Smith's and Fullers). Will definitely have to revisit this in bottled form when I get the chance."
"Mmmmm, another winner from Bell's. I've yet to have a lackluster effort from them. This beer is roasty, toasty and fresh tasting. Nothing to complain about here...now go get ya a sixer of it. Has an English feel to it and is nutty, but not over the top. Smooth and tasty."
"D. Easy to put down....the carbonation is seemingly just right, but the flavor, for me, hurts the quaffability a bit bcause of the charcoal flavors. However, this is definitely an easy-drinker and surprisingly a sessionable porter. Overall, I kind of expected a bit more from Bell's Porter. A solid porter, but nothing special, I think. Everything about it is good, but nothing particularly stands out."
"The color is very dark, closest to black of any beer I've seen. It pours a good, thick head with some nice lacing. Malts are strong as well as some toastiness in smell. I also detected a subtle fruitiness. There's about a medium to strong body with a smooth taste. A little bit of harshness at first sip that translates well to a burnt toastiness. Hops can be tasted pretty strongly and the finish is dry. Quite drinkable. I would recommend this as one to try."
"Taste continues the roast and coffee. Then adds a nice smooth flavor that also brings out chocolate. Nice porter. Tasty dry finish."
"Attractively solid head, dark cream in color, stays about one finger deep but stays there, abundant sticky lacing that you'll have to wash out later. The nose strikes an admirable balance between roast and sweetness, the coffee definitely ""regular"" with milk and two spoons of sugar, you get carob, hazelnut, milk chocolate powder, caramel hard candies, cherry, blackberry to black raisin fruit scents, touch of burnt oats, without you noticing completely fills your nostrils. It's medium-bodied, has a good deal of density which appears to have been accounted for by the highly active carbonation. Plenty of chicory bitterness to tussle with the chocolate, cappuccino, caramel flavors. More roast here, both flavor-wise and texturally. The hazelnut, Brazil nut, macadamia nuts lend an attractive thread throughout. The plum, cherry fruit muted here. Moderate corn and grain notes but never gets ""hoppy"" per se. Dry finish gets you licking your lips for another sip."
"D- A very solid brew and even more special on cask."
"D - Smooth beer. Very drinkable."
"D - Only knock on drinkability is the aftertaste is starting to bother me. The flavors of the beer itself, plus the moderate abv, and the light set on the palette are all positives."
"Overall: very good session porter, not overpowering and highly drinkable, not the best I've had but by far not the worst."
"A very drinkable brew I could easily sit down to a couple of these , and if I saw it on tap I would go for it."
"Taste: Great balance between bitterness and roasted coffee."
"Poured dark brown with a nice sized tannish head. Nose of light chocolate, coffee, a little hops as well. Taste is sudbued. Nose is misleading. Roasted malts on taste with a dash of cocoa but thats about it. Not really impressed. it was good but not great. Thin mouthfeel and body. I expected more robust porter I suppose."
"Pours a very dark brown with a tiny brown head that turns to soap film in an instant. Smells of molasses and a nutty butteriness. Big flavor of roasted nuts and burnt tortillas with a bitter chocolate finish. Medium bodied, highly carbonated; very easy and pleasant to drink. Not the most sophisticated porter on the streets but certainly an enjoyable good one."
"The flavor is sharp forward with a pleasant burnt nutty flavor that ends with a flatness. For the alcohol content it has a lot of flavor, but it returns flat and without much complexity and a lingering bitter taste with hints of tobacco."
"Drinkability is good. All is all, a solid porter, not a ton of flavors, but it's a nice beer to drink."
"Overall, a good but not great beer from a great brewery. Good I got to try it but with some many other great Am Porters out there, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to get this again (maybe once more just to make sure I had a good sample but pretty sure I did since I got it from the Hop Shop). Medium recommend."
"Actually a bit of a let down when considering other offerings from Bells Brewery. Appearance was blacker than black, and smelled of chocolate accompanied by nut, roasted coffee, sweet dark malts, and some hop spice in the background. The taste missed all of the aroma however, and was dominated by coffee, but sort of a weak coffee. Truly a disappointing porter especially when delivered from a tried and true brewery like Bells."
"Overall: This is one of my favorite porters, it's just balanced so well."
"Overall, this beer has me mixing my tenses in this review and I don' care enough to sort them out. I'm used to enjoying nearly every Bell's product I drink; it turns out the a brewery that I love making one of my very favorite beer styles wasn't the recipe for success that I thought it was going to be."
"D- It's a very easy drinker. The flavor is bold, yet not overwhelming. I could see sessioning this one on a cold evening spent inside."
"Would buy this again, but probably will drink it quicker."
"D: I do like this beer.. It is not the best Porter I have had, but it is quite good. Hopefully a bar round here will be getting this on tap soon."
"Not my fave release from Bell's."
"Climbing my porter list more and more every time I drink it."
"Either way, this is a great porter, and another well done dark beer from Bells."
"Not full bodied at all. Rather the opposite. Flavor was OK. I would like to try some other Porter's before I go too far on this. I had Michelobe porter, Bell's Porter is much better than that crap."
"below average drinkability for me."
"Overall a decent an good example of american porter."
"A tasty, finely crafted porter that is true to the style and doesn't try to do anything too crazy. But solid. I guess this beer competes with the numerous Bell's stouts which some might say are a little bit more ambitious. Great for the style though."
"D: Run of the mill porter. Nothing good and nothing great."
"A nice dark oily pour,with a thin light tan head with some spotty lacing.Nice aroma of coffee,smoke,and some faint tobacco. Thick body,with flavors of dark coco,coffee,and toasted malt,smooth creamy mouthfeel.Quite drinkable.A solid porter."
"Pours a decent head, which went away quickly. Some stickiness to the glass. Smells a bit thin, not as robust as many other porters. Is colored black with tan head. Tastes great, very easy to drink. Some fruits, maybe slight cherry, smokey flavor. Toffee and chocolate, but not overbearing. A medium bodied beer which is really easy to drink."
"I really enjoyed this glass and thinks it's worth a try."
"Poured to a two fingered head. Head tasted on the bitter side. Head also had some big bubbles. Left some good lacing. Porter was black in color. Smelled of malt,chocolate, and burnt coffee. Maybe a hint of alcohol. Tasted of burnt coffee, chocolate, malt and a slight cream flavor. Had a slight bitter aftertaste that hung around awhile. Felt smooth and thick in the mouth. Carbonation was good. I think this is one of those beers that if you did a session with it, you would have to be carefull. It tasted so good, that all I wanted to do was gulp it down. With the little higher alcohol content you would probably get in trouble real fast."
"D- Very drinkable. I had this beer along time ago on tap and liked it so I suggested it be put on tap where I work and am happy I did,"
"D: Perhaps I was expecting something different or I had a bad batch. But the taste was not what I expected. I may try again just to see if I have a better experience."
"Overall, the smell was a big turn away from this beer. The taste was normal, but I couldn't get over the smell. I would try it, just to compare to other porters, but wouldn't buy it again."
"Way very drinkable. Not a thick sipper or heavy with alcohol, but with enough body and flavor to be very satisfying. A solid effort."
"Pours a deep amber brown with a small tan head. Aroma is medium sweet with some woody notes, light chocolate and caramel. Flavor is coffee bitter, chocolate malt and roasty. Medium bodied, smooth texture. Finishes somewhat long and roasty. This one along with the Kalamzoo are definitely coffee inspired."
"D: I am a porter fan and I thought this beer was right on for a porter. I enjoyed it and find it easy to drink a few of these."
"Pours a very dark brown color with slight mahogany edges and a thin foamy beige head. Roasted malty aroma with sweet chocolate notes. This beer tastes kind of smokey with lots of roasted chocolate maltiness, oatmeal, caramel and burnt toast. Slightly creamy body with a dry bitter finish."
"D-A tasty and delightfully sessionable american porter. With plenty of flavour to keep things interesting this one has every day drinking porter written all over it. Well done."
"No doubt this is a well-made porter. It doesn't outclass others in its category by a mile, the way Bell's have done with so many other styles. But it's fine, and if you really, really dig porters, you might just love it."
"Try pairing this one with Mole Chicken."
"Overall, this is a quite drinkable beer and is a good porter, although there is room for improvements."
"A very drinkable porter from the folks at Bell's."
"One of the few Bell's beers that disappoints me. It doesn't taste bad but something is missing here, it just reminds me of a weaker version of their Stout."
"Good sessionable porter."
"Notes from 12/31/06"
"This beer pours black with a nice big frothy offwhite head. Smells or roasted malts, and chocolate. Tastes of roasted malt with some chocolate and a hint of coffee. The mouthfeel has medium body and is semi-smooth with some nice carbination. Drinkability is decent I could drink a couple. Overall a good choice from bell's"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, the flavors are balanced, none are overpowering. Finish can sometimes be a little bitter, but not enough to detract substantially. One of the few porters I could enjoy more than one or two of."
"D - it's very easy to drink this tasty brew."
"D-Very easy to drink, lending to the thin body. However, did not leave me wanting another."
"Very good beer and very drinkable."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer, it finishes dry but the dryness is not overwhelming....it's got a fresh, clean crispness that balances nicely."
"A pretty decent, straight forward porter. I'd even go so far to say a sessionable porter for a fall day."
"Tasty porter. Others I like more, but would gladly buy this again."
"D - Drinkability is good. This isn't my favorite selection from Bell's but still a good beer nonetheless. The low alcohol and pleasant flavor really make this one quite easy to drink. I could drink a few of these with no problem at all."
"This beer had a lot of carbonation which was nice. The taste really put the cocoa and chocolate malts first and foremost and really hit nice sweet roasted flavors throughout the mout feel. A good sweet finish at the end."
"I have had this beer many times and never took notes for a review. Here my notes are lacking but i remember a nice full beer that I had three glasses of. Very Dark and very good."
"D- This isn't you typical porter. It has more of a hoppy presence than the more traditional sweet porters. This could definitely be sessionable."
"D: Nothing wrong with this one. It's a solid, if somewhat unspectacular porter."
"D - This is a very nice porter. Yet another fine offering from Bell's."
"D: Overall a solid good beer, enjoyable."
"Drinkability: I'm not usually a big fan of porters, preferring to just get the ""real thing"" in a stout already, dammit, but this is a very good example of the style. Well executed and depending on your taste and alcohol tolerance probably a fine session beer, despite the 5.6% ABV. Lovers of porters should seek it out."
"Overall, a good showing by Bell's. A decent porter with good flavor and a hell of a lot of sweetness"
"The beer pours brownish-black with hints of amber. The head is tan, but not too big. It dissipates down to a ring and wisps leaving little lace. The aroma is chocolatey and sweet. The flavor is chocolatey with hints of coffee. The mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side of medium but quite smooth. Overall, a good porter."
"Crazy darkest brown-to-virtually black with a light tan head. Aromas of cocoa and carob. Almost-but-not-quite-coffee-like aroma - more on the chocolate side. Flavors of more cocoa, more ""almost but not quite coffee-like"" and and some roasted malt. Tilting towards full body with dark bitter-sweet chocolate on the finish. All in all a good solid porter. I braised some skirt steak with this and it did well. Use this as your bottle of beer in a chili recipe instead of something dumb."
"this one had alot of floating particals in it, so i think this bottle isnt fresh, this has some coffie or bitter dark coco flavers in the begining and some big hops at the end, this one was ok but i want to try a fresh bottle befor i form my final opinion"
"This is a classic American porter and darned tasty. It's on the dry and drinkable side of the spectrum, maybe a little more brown than robust, like a Sierra Nevada Porter instead of an Anchor Porter. The flavor has rich roasted malts that give off toffee, caramel, and semisweet chocolate flavors with a multigrain bread undertone. Definitely a beer for porter lovers."
"D: Its light-bodied character and subtle flavor profile make it very easy to drink."
"M/D - medium to full bodied and very very creamy and smooth. Excellent feel. It is a passable porter but the taste just isnt anything great."
"D - Quite drinkable and full flavoured for the most part."
"D- Oh-so-drinkable. This is my favorite beer of the style. Nothing over the top, but consistant as Bell's Brewery is famous for. I will try to have a few more of these on hand for the coming Winter months."
"12 ounce bottle, Batch 8390 bottled on March 20, 2008. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch frothy tan head. Head retention is pretty good, lacing is good as well. Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, coffee and a little bit of hops. However the aroma is a bit on the weak side. The taste is similar to the aroma (but stronger), it tastes like bittersweet chocolate, roasted/burnt malt, coffee and some earthy hops. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's smooth and has average carbonation. Drinkability is good too, it's easy to drink and has a dry finish. Overall I think this is a good brew, I could have this as an occasional session beer."
"This was a nice porter with the typical appearance but the head fades quickly...especially for a cask beer. This is a nice drinkable porter that's smell and flavors lean on the coffee side. Not very much roasted bitterness but just enough to give you that authentic feel. A nice light drinkable porter body. A really good representation of the typical porter without any crazy deviance from the style. I liked this one but I know that it wouldn't be as good in a bottle."
"D. Drinkability is average. An easy drinking porter that i would drink again."
"D_An easy drinking porter with bold assertive flavours. Another winner from the folks at Bell's."
"Bell's Porter is a bit thin-bodied, but with nice carbonation and good drinkability."
"D-Quite drinkable and pleasant on the taste buds. Another good delivers from Bell's."
"D: Not bad, I've had better porters but this is not without its charms."
"Flavor is a nicely mellow bitter coco with hints of hops. Definitely not an in your face type of porter, more the after dinner sipping type. Malts are smooth and creamy. This would complement almost any desert very well."
"Pours a dark cola black with ruby highlights. A two finger tan colored head quickly falls to a thin creamy layer of foam. A fair amount of stickiness remains on the sides of the glass. Smell consists of roasted chocolate malts with coffee and some earthy hops. Brown sugar and molasses in the aroma as well. Basic, but enjoyable smelling porter. Taste begins with smoked barley and dark chocolate with freshly brewed coffee. Wheat bread and cane sugar midway with a slightly dry, but clean, aftertaste from the hops. Soft, smooth, and creamy feel with a light to medium body. Carbonation is light and fluffy. This is a very drinkable and enjoyable porter. I really wish Bell's would distribute in NY."
"D - very good overall, just not something I want to drink over and over in a sitting"
"The nose on the beer is quite robust with toasted malts with a slight bit of chocolate. The beer is poured with a centimeter head and is pretty much all black, except near the bottom. There really isn't much flavour in this beer, it has bit of roastiness, but mainly watered down. Way too much carbonation as well. Thin mouthfeel and I guess it's drinkable because there isn't any flavour."
"Drinkability is very good though."
"D - Cases, kegs, bombers, bottles, whatever you got if this was around more it would be a staple. Goes down extremely easy, during the fall, winter or spring i would keep a six pack real close."
"Having this beer in bottles was great but it was really special on cask, if you ever have a chance to get this on cask definitely do it."
"D: Tasty on cask and easily sessionable."
"12 ounce bottle, no freshness indication that I can find, pours rich, dark brown, darker tan head and so so lace left behind. Malty, vanilla nose. Tasty roasty, sweetish porter, more vanilla noted, then darker malts, some cafe au lait and milk chocolate and moderate hop dryadge late. Easy drinking porter, I would like to try this one with some BBQ, pleasant enough porter, worth a try."
"D- I probably wont ever consider buying this again. i had alot higher hopes for bells and this one was pretty disappointing."
"Overall: Meh. I'd drink it again, but only if someone else was buying. Like some other Bell's products, a deeply disappointing year-around standard offering from a brewery capable of vastly more."
"D: Not the worst porter by any means. I would be anxious to try this beer on tap, to see if the taste is more poignant."
"This didn't blow me away, but I'd definitely have another. A nice simple Porter here."
"I purchased a mixed pack of Bell's beers to see how they stacked up against each other, and I found that this one was too true to style for me, the least exciting of the bunch. That said, I was very impressed by the balance and texture, which never seems to come together in porters. Flavor without stout-like thickness."
"Pours a dark brown in color with a nice quarter inch mocha brown head. Looks good. Smell is roasty. Some dark malts and maybe roasted coffee. Taste is more of the roast with a touch of the coffee there as well. A little too much roast coming through. Decent mouthfeel, could be a bit thicker. All in all a solid porter from Bells."
"Chocolate on the tongue as well. Malty with not much hoppyness at all. Slight carbonation, but not enough to prevent me from taking large mouthfulls of it. Rich and biscuity. Very nice Porter. This would go great with a grilled steak and caramelized onions. Time to start the grill."
"mouthfeel is light on the palate, easy to drink, light bitterness and good carbonation"
"Not the most diverse porter, but very solid and worth a try."
"This beer certainly was the talk around the Eccentric Cafe so I certainly had to try it. This porter poured dark with a slight head. It smelled nice with the underlying flavors of coffee and chocolate. This was not my favorite beer @ the brewery but I would say it was #3 or 4 for me. The taste was nice and you could tell it was a well crafted beer. It was a smooth drinker and I could see why everyone was raving about it. Complex flavor that went down easy. Well done"
"Bell's Porter is an extremely approachable, well balanced, and nice tasting brew that I could happily enjoy by lone bottle or sixer."
"Pours a solid chocolate brown with a decent tanish head that sticks around for a bit. Aromas of chocolate and coffee, a little fruity with some roast in there too. Taste is some chocolate, some fruit and bitter roast with a little ash at the end. Mouthfeel starts creamy, but leaves your mouth dry in the finish. Medium carbonation. Decent brew, I could see myself drinking these a lot if they sold it here."
"Excellent beer, but not for sessions. One or two of these and I'm done."
"D-Easy to drink overall a very solid porter would be one i reach for again."
"Beer could session well. Full flavored without being overpowering. Very easy to sit and enjoy."
" a pretty easy drinking beer, could be a good session beer, if found on tap at a bar"
"Drinkability - A fine porter, balanced and very drinkable."
"Cheers!"
"This is a nice, easy drinking porter that has full flavour and good balance to it. Well worth a try."
"drinkability - Easy drinking because it is not a strong beer,"
"Purchased on 4/30/08 at the Bell's General Store next to the Eccentric Cafe in Kalamazoo, MI. Batch #8363 printed on the label. Served in a standard pint glass. Poured black with some deep brown highlights around the edges. One-inch fluffy off-white head. Scents of chocolate and malt. Taste similar to nose, but not as flavorful as the nose had implied. Some subtle roasted coffee character, as well as a little bit of hops bite at the finish. Mouthfeel was somewhat lively, but also a lit less full-bodied than anticipated (not quite watery, but also not quite medium-bodied). While not overly flavorful, this brew has good session potential for a porter in that it is not overly heavy and the flavors are fairly subdued. Another solid offering from Bell's."
"Overall a drinkable porter; not up there with the elite Americans put out by Anchor & Deutches, but a quality offering from Bell's nonetheless."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a deep dark brown color (not quite black) that had a 1/4 inch tan head that had larger bubbles that dissipated quickly. The aroma was nice with a deep roasted nutty cover that seemed to have a hidden chocolate malt background. The taste was similar. There was a nice balance with a great presence of chocolate and rich malt, no burnt taste as in some. The carbonation was a little heavy for my taste, but this was a very refreshing porter, not too much, rather just enough flavor!"
"drinkablility is great. this is a rich porter that is not too heavy, but provides enough flavors and body to create a solid porter. cheers!"
"This was the first beer I ever drank, and I stuck with it through the cold michigan winters. It was porter for cold weather and Oberon for warm weather. That was when I lived in Michigan... I've moved to California and now Portland, Oregon. I drink a lot of IPA now, so porter has slipped down on my favorites list. When I do visit Michigan for the holidays, it's a given that I get a six pack the first night I'm home of Bells Porter! It's a great back to a whiskey rocks- preferably sweeter whiskey."
"M + D: A nice enough medium body, and carbonation is actually about spot on - at least for my mood, I suppose. It's about what I was looking for, and that much was pleasing. Maybe a part of me feels that Bell's could have done a little better with this, but it's still an alright porter. It could have stood to been a little bit bigger and/or bolder, but pretty straight forward, average beer."
"Overall, this would be a beer that I order/purchase again."
"From a firkin at Hot Shotz. Poured a deep dark mahogany brown with some light seeping through. A short head sinks to a ring around the glass leaving some decent lace. Nose is smoky, with burnt wood and some dark fruits. Hidden scent of sweeter caramel. Taste is nice, with smooth malt and a slightly crisp back end. Flavors of smoke, wood, and deep toasted malt. It sweetens a some in the middle then breaks up to a clean finish. Feel is smooth with a lighter medium body. Leaves a little oily feeling, but has a very clean finish. Lighter and slightly watery on cask. Very pleasant overall. It doesn't pack the body I usually enjoy in this style. Consumes very easily."
"A quirky beer, sour in the nose and nutty tasting. Very good, though."
"This poured a nearly opaque black with a little light tan head. It smelled like delicious milk chocolate. It had a dominant flavor of chocolate as well with some hops and malt noticeable. It had a slightly oily texture with no carbonation and a mild dark chocolate bitterness in the aftertaste. Overall this was easy to drink, very chocolaty, and very nice."
"A dark colored beer, with about a two finger head. Head retention wasn't spectacular, nor was the lacing, then again I am a novice at the pouring process. The roasted malts definitely dominate the smell of this beer along with a hint of coffee. The taste was pretty good, once again the roasted malts dominate the palate. The beer is very smooth with a good amount of carbonation. I don't know if I could drink to many of these, it's a relatively full-bodied beer and I'm quite the lightweight. I would definitely recommend this beer to someone and I will probably drink more of this one in future."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied, very creamy and smooth. Carbonation is perfect. This really is a joy to drink. A very solid offering from Bell's. Highly recommended."
"I get this on draft every once in awhile..It is a staple in my beer diet. This is everything a porter should be and all other should be compared to the Bell's Porter when judging the taste of a porter.Hands down my favorite porter to date. Easy on the pallet and can easily be made into a session beer which I seldom do! Cheers and hats of to Bell's brewery for this exceptionally fine brew!"
" ~ I really think this porter is a knockout. I recommend anyone that likes a good full flavored but very sleek malty rich beer to give this Bell's a try. You won't regret it."
"Overall a pretty decent porter. Not my favorite however. It does have a nonconfrontational taste and body that does make it pretty damn easy to drink. I will probably pick it up again sometime, but I want to try a few others first."
"Pours almost opaque with good lacey off white head. Smell is kind of weak and has some coppery tones but is ok. Taste is very nice. Roasty and toasty malts, a nice creaminess through the middle, and nicely balanced bite on the finish. Mouthfeel could be a bit thicker, drinkability is superb. This one reminds me of edmund fitzgerald but a little lighter it seems. A superb porter, would defenitely be a session beer for me if it was readily available. Thanks again to gkatsoris."
"Overall this was am excellent porter, and something that is quite useful as a staple or standby beer for everyday use in the fridge. I could easily have had another and thought it came off quite fresh. Another quality offering from Bell's regular lineup. I would recommend giving this one a try."
"Overall Impression: A little heavy handed with the roasted grains, or a little too light with the hops or base malt. Either way, a bit over roasted. Still, a flavorful beer that I didn't mind drinking (I'm not a porter fan). Worth a try."
"d: Doesn't stand out too much. No clear flaws. No clear strengths. Typical drinkability. A slightly above average porter, a slightly below average offering from Bell's."
"this is not an assertive beer at all. i take this as one of those ""solid"" porter examples. you can enjoy this beer if yo like milder porters as a slightly more assertive brew, and also if you are a big beer guy as a slightly less crazy beer. it wont bowl you over but you wont put it down either"
"Very happy with this porter. Tastes what I think a good porter should taste like but I would have liked it a tiny bit more sweet. Bell's hasn't disappointed me yet!"
"d - this tastes pretty good, but it almost borders a stout for me with it's lack of any real hops. A decent beer, but I wish it was just a little more."
"Pours black with a good tan head. Smell is somooth roasty malt, cream, nuts, and some smokiness as it warms. Taste is creamy, nutty, and smooth roast which starts milder, and takes center stage as it warms as well. A great porter in all. Thanks Greg!"
"Nice middle of the road porter. Poured a dark ruby red with a thick long lasting brown head. The aroma was faint with whiffs of roasted coffee and malt. The body was firm, with decent warmth from the alcohol. From start to finish, the taste was smooth, creamy with enough malts, roasted coffee, and toffee balanced by a moderatly dry finish. Could have used some English Goldings and Fuggles; otherwise a nice session beer."
"A very easy to drink solid American porter."
"This beer poured a dark brown with a huge, very foamy off white head. The aroma was dominated by chocolate and coffee. The taste was of coffee with hints of chocolate. The mouthfeel was medium body with medium carbonation. Overall another damn great beer from Bells."
"This beer is good, but not great. It would go great with a tiramisu or other dessert. The beer itself is, in fact, a dessert."
"Drinkability: I just think a mediocre porter is so easy to do these days from so many breweries, and it bothers me when I get one -- like a style of, say, a Pilsner or a Brown Ale -- that keeps going along the same lines. I'm not saying it needs to be insanely extravagant, but porters (and not Baltic style) are just being overdone with mediocrity these days, if you'll excuse the semi-oxymoron. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed this, but I don't know if I could tell the difference between this and hundreds out there. Again, Bell's is hit or miss with me, and this is somewhere in between, but there are much better examples with more flavor and balance and nuance and complexity out there to try."
"Color is pitch black with a thin tan head that dissipates quickly. Burnt aroma, bready, hint of fruit and raisin. Tastes dry, roasted coffee and some underlying fruity sweet tones, toffee. Not too hoppy, but there is definitely enough hops to provide decent balance. Finishes dry as well. Oily and slick going down, fair amount of carbonation. Very drinkable, I enjoyed this porter."
"I think I have found another favorite porter. I popped this one before I sat down for dinner with some pasta and wasn't sure how well it would go with the Alfredo sauce. I was so impressed with the flavor that it almost didn't make it to the table with me. Ultimately it was great with the pasta as well. Recommended!"
"D: not something i would pay for again, something with this porter didnt sit right with me. i have been a huge fan of bell's but this one let me down, maybe a bad bottle?"
"Pours a deep clear mahogony with a tan head, Nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is toasty malts. Taste is a nice smooth toast with coffee notes. Mouthfeel is very smooth. Aftertaste is nice bitter hops. A good solid porter. Bell's beers have been avalable around here a short while, some very solid offerings."
"Pours a dark brown color with a foamy, capuccino type brown creme'. Slight lacing on the side of the glass. Smell is a toassty malt aroma with hints of cocoa and earthy hops. Taste is nice with plenty of malt and bittersweet chocolate. Hops come through for a nice compliment. Mouth feel is nice and smooth on this with a hint of a woody flavor. Very nice beer."
"Felt smooth as silk, with just enough carbonation to help it down. Really incredible feeling. Creamy, with no bad oily feel at all."
"The beer poured a beautiful midnight black with a luscious tan inch and a half head. While the beer was being poured it gave a coarse fizzing sound, almost like pouring a soda into a glass, kind of bad news. At first the head had a very coarse texture with large bubbles, but as I began to drink, the head condensed into nice tight bubbles. The beer did not carry a very heavy scent to it, but I did smell almost candy sweet malts, biscuit and croissant aromas, matched with faint scents of coffee, dark chocolate, toffee, and the faintest scent of floral hops. The taste of the brew was incredibly sweet. At the forefront of the palate was a heavy sweet biscuit taste, the beer probably had a strong base of two-row malts. After letting the beer acquaint itself with my taste buds, strong flavors of black patent malts became prevalent, as well as a good dose of chocolate malts. These ingredients produced flavors of coffee, dark chocolate and faint hints of charred oak. The high point of this beer was definitely the body. The body of this porter was captivatingly smooth, like cashmere rolling across the tongue. Overall an excellent offering by Bells."
"Drinkability: There was nothing in this beer that made me feel that it was above being an average run of the mill Porter. Would I give it another try? I would like too, I really would. It would be nice to see if a second bottle would push this beer above average."
"Just delicious, easily one of the best I've had from Bell's. Pours a finger of tan froth atop a very dark body. Good aromas emerge--coffee, chocolate, good malt, nice all around. The taste brings all these together very well, combining with a splendid moutfeel to blend the somewhat roasted malts, well represented by all the flavors mentioned above. The carbonation is just right, providing an easy-going smoothness along with the occasional bite. One of the better porters I've had, and a real treat from Bell's. This, people, is good porter."
"M/D: Full bodied, carbonation is high but not harsh. Drinkability is good, a very fine porter."
"The smell is smokey and slightly sour. Good but nothing earth shattering to make it stand out. The taste is spot on perfect for a porter. Roasted malt goodness with just a hint of smokiness. Finishes slightly bitter. It has a crisp bite from the carbonation which is a little high for a porter. Light/medium bodied and very drinkable. I will definately seek this out for future consumption."
"So, if it's so freaking great how come it didn't get top scores from me? Hmm. Well, I don't recall, much, the smell so I can't honestly say that it had an awesome one. I suppose I can up the mouthfeel, though. There, done."
"Taste was of sweet malt and lemony. Finishes a tad bitter with a citric overtone. Medium light feeling in the mouth, harsh carbonation on the tongue. Overall a good porter that would be hard to improve upon, but could. I could drink this on a regular basis"
"Drinkability: One at a time is enough but I will definitely drink again."
"D = This is a drinkable beer if it's what you have on hand, but I was slightly underwhelmed. I would probably pick another porter if I were really setting out to have a nice porter, but this is a nice tasty beer that can definitely be enjoyed any time it is offered."
"Opaque black with no backlit highlights. Had an initial half inch head that quickly dissipated to a thin layer with foamy islands. Some lacing and a nice ring around the glass. Aroma is very beefy, smells like a beef jerky along with coffee. Taste is more towards the coffee side, definitely dry and bitter. Mouth feel is full with prickly carbonation, has a dry finish. Probably a good beer with food, next time I drink it, it will be while I am eating something."
"A velvety mix of chocolate and coffee tones are predominant in the sip but the finish is surprisingly clean. Hopping is evident but not decisive. Mouthfeel is smooth and properly heavy. Very easy to quaff although several in a row might be too rich. Definitely recommended."
"Notes: A very good example of what a porter should be, and if you've never tried one, you can't go wrong here. It's not as complex as some other porters, but then again it's better than most others out there."
"I could definitely have several of these."
"Pours extremely dark - just one step below opaque. Big tan head off a very firm pour, but it falls fast. Mildly roasted nose. Touch of a sweet tone. Malt tones are there for sure. Flavor is pretty thick with roasted tones and minimal coffee with a lot of malts of course. Feel has a lot of carbonation really going at the tongue and the liquid is thick enough. A nice, hearty porter. Definitely worth trying."
"D - Good beer. This has a really smooth finish and is easy to drink."
"D: My hat is off to the brew master as this is a real honest and well-balanced porter that is a great example of a great tasting profile. Since this is not sweet or heavy, I think that this could be an excellent choice for a session porter."
"Pretty easy drinking...low ABV....not the greatest porter, but worth a try."
"If you like porters or if you have access to these beers, try it."
"Drinkability: So yeah, good stuff."
"D: Very enjoyable porter, nothing fancy but nothing to keep me from coming back to this if I want a simple, good porter"
"Overall: One of the better porters made. Big on taste and an easy drinker. I like almost all of Bell's brews and this one is no exception. While on my trip to DC I found tons of Bell's brews. My only regret was not trying each and every one that was in the store."
"Poured this one into a pint glass. Very dark appearance with a head that sits well and doesn't settle too fast. Smoky aroma with traces of coffee. Excellent, full flavor that's as good as any available porter. Goes down very smooth with only a little carbonation."
"Drinkability: Nothing objectionable about this.... good solid porter."
"This beer pours a full brown color with hints of copper in the edges. The beer props up a tan dense rocky head that lasts. The beer smells of roasted malt and crystal, very pleasing and a bit bready. Very drinkable, a nice smooth malt balanced beer. Not a lot of hop character, perhaps it could be a bit more bold in that department, but it is to my taste. Good beer, try it."
"I would drink this again and may try in the bottle if I can find."
"D - Very good on this one. The slight bite dims down halfway through and I could tell downing a sixer of this would not be difficult at all, in fact, it would probably be preferable. Cheers once again to Bell's, for another fine brew."
"D- Better than I remember. This is a solid porter and a good representation of Bell's solid year-round offerings."
"Taste is a little hollow compared to the smell. I expected a lot more. There's mild chocolate, slight wet cardboard, not very sweet with just a little fruit sweetness. Kind of thin in the mouth with a good amount of carbonation. It's an OK porter but I don't think I'd be interested in drinking many of them."
"Pours very dark brown with a medium/small head. Some lacing. Aroma is sweet dark chocolate with some roasted notes. Taste is mostly slightly bitter roast malt. Some coffee notes. Some herbal hops. A little underlying sweetness is detectable. Medium bodied. Pretty drinkable. Fairly standard porter overall."
"D: Medium. Good drinkability for a porter."
"Poured nice and dark. Light on taste, a bit watery. Not much complexity, hints of coffee and cocoa, thin head and mouthfeel. Slightly hoppy aftertaste. Cold to warm not much different. Not a bad beer, if it were a lager, but not worth drinking unless you had the choice between this and Bud."
"Black with brown edges and a rich tan head, very well carbonated with good lacing and retention. Smells of bitter dark chocolate and has a strong, bitter expresso taste. Dry brazil nut mouthfeel. There is some coffee bean astringency that takes away slightly from the mouthfeel. Although not as balanced as it could be, this is still another fine Bell's product well worth stocking up on."
"Mouthfeel is a bit fizzy at first but with some swirling becomes creamier. Very smooth with some charred flavor from start to finish, balanced by more restrained malt and with subtle hop flavor. The flavor is a bit less complex than the aromas would predict. A bit of melted snow in the finish. Roasted French roast coffee in the finish lingers, but doesn't overwhelm. Overall effect is rather light and refreshing despite the dark color, which is perfect for the style. A bit bolder in taste and definitely more complex aroma than other American porters I have tried. Another great job by Bell's."
"D - I like porters because they are usually more drinkable over the long haul than stouts, but my favorites tend to stray away from this. This is a very solid porter that I could drink multiple of in a sitting"
"d-could drink a couple of these, i will def. get this beer again and will be looking for it on taps."
"D: An extremely drinkable porter due to a nice balance of toasted malts, sweetness, and hoppy finish."
"Drinkability: Great; excellent example of the style."
"Overall, this is a very good American porter that I would consider again."
"Good solid offering from Bell's. Great everyday porter."
"D: Not a bad porter at all, albeit on the lighter side body-wise."
"Drinks good, but given how stellar most of Bell's beers are, I'm a bit disappointed, a solid porter"
"Got this one at the Berkley Front in Berkley, MI. Poured a mahogany brown color with just a couple lighter brown highlights. A bit of head that disappears fairly fast, and no real lacing. Nose is very mild, mostly just a bit of roasted malt. Taste is better, and very smooth. Lots of roasted malt in fairly good balance with the hops that show up later on. A touch of chocolate and maybe a bit of dried fruit too. Not as flavorfull as the Edmund Fitzgerald, but good, nonetheless. Feel is a little thin for a porter, although the carbonation is good. I think I'd probably take both of Bell's widely available stouts over this one, although it's definitely one I'd have again in a pinch."
"D- I wouldn't mind having more of these. Doubt I will go out specifically and try to get them but if I could get them here I would buy a 6-pack every once in awhile."
"A phenomenal example of the style from Bells. A rich dark color with ruby around the edge when held to the light. The rich nutty, malty aroma gets me excited about drinking and the flavor delivers. Chocolate malt, Caramel Malt, a malt lovers dream. I could drink this all night."
"D - This is a highly drinkable beer. The flavors are light but present enough to keep you interested and the midrange body and higher carbonation help it to go down easy. I am impressed that they have hit the porter style so solidly and I must say that this is a beer that I could drink all night long."
""
"Nice, even-handed balanced porter. Carbonation level and character is essentially perfect."
"Easy to drink, well-crafted and robust, a very nice american porter."
"the flavor mirrors what i experienced through my nose; dry roastiness. mild bitterness and an easygoing mouthfeel"
"Creamy but thin mouthfeel. Possibly a bit too much carbonation that creates a slightly light texture that is a bit too much so for my taste in porters."
"D - Very Good Porter but not my favorite, Great for the price"
"A truly ""sessionable"" porter. Nicely balanced - A good example of an American Porter!"
"D: A bit thin in the mouthfeel but a nice flavored porter none the less. Easy and enjoyable to drink. Recommended."
"this is a very good brew, very enjoyable"
"The body is deep dark black with a tan head that quickly dissapeared to lacing on the edges of the glass. It hads a nice roasted nut smell with chocolate and roasted coffee aromas. The flavor is slighty nutty with chocolate, with a hint of coffee and a little hoppy bitterness. It had a creamy medium mouthfeel, low carbonation. It was very drinkable."
"D: Tasty, a good drinkable porter. A good, sessionable example of the style, which I can imagine having more than one of on a cool evening. I'd like to have this again and would recommend it as a good example of the style."
"Dark brown, translucent body. Off-white head with nice retention. Roasted malt in the aroma. Very grainy, like cereal. Sweet, biscuity, raisiny, roasty flavors are present throughout the length of the beer. Light-medium bodied with medium carbonation. Nice, creamy and drinkable. Not overly flavorful but it would be a great session beer."
"Eric"
"Very nice, very easy to drink, a most enjoyable beer. Well crafted, light on the tongue, just a nice, seductive Porter. A simple grilled steak would work with it, as well as some dry cheese, perhaps the two together? A simple chocolate dessert would also be a good match (thinking blondie or a chocolate chip cookie). Definitely recommended, especially if you don't like heavy handed Porters, and would drink again no problem. Check it out."
"The taste is hard to pin down: some wheat and bready grains with a sweet note. My friend called it ""biscuity", sure thing trep. The mouthfeel is flat with a low carbonation and a weak finish. This is a relatively easy-drinking porter, just not one I'd pick over some other, better brews."
"D: Would definitely recommend this to anyone who's a fan of porters. I wasn't overly impressed, but this one did leave its mark, and Bell's is a reliable brewery through and through. I did enjoy this a great deal, though."
"The 'tap' version of the beer offers a better experience than from the bottle. The beer is typically colored with a deep walnut hue and nearly opaque. Well headed and modestly carbonated gives visual weight and stability to the brew. Faint aromas of coffee, chocolate, toasted malts, and heavy cream. The flavors of malt sweetness pronounce early, but are quickly tempered by bold columbian coffee notes and acidity, fresh bitter hops, walnuts, cocoa, and milk sugars. Creamy textured and silky smooth, not relying on carbonation to lighten the feel. Finishes with a simple coffee and milk aftertaste that lingers into a slight bitterness. As nicely flavored as I had remembered, but better bodied from the tap."
"Bell's has impressed me with everything so far, but here's as close to a miss as they probably could get. A nice beer, but nothing to write home about. With so many better options, I don't see myself buying this again, but while I've got it, I'll enjoy it."
"This one reminded me more of a schwarzbier. Decent brew."
"-Oelergud"
"Not terribly impressed with this beer. Found it on tap at a local restaurant. Thought the roasted malt tasted slightly burnt and somewhat dirty. There was a definite coffee and chocolate flavor coming through, and I could taste a little bit of cola as well. Not bad, but not exactly worth a try imo."
"Overall a nice porter but a little too bitter for me."
"D: Very tasty, goes down very easily, not very filling, good representation of style and one of the best American Porters that IÂ’ve had. If IÂ’m in a porter kind of mood, I could see myself drinking quite a few of these, if only BellÂ’s were available here."
"D - Very good in the drinkability category and represents the style well. It is a sweet beer, so multiple tastings seems difficult. The flavor is pleasant and is good to return to on occasion for a sweet dark treat."
"Overall: An excellent robust porter. The fact that it is bottle-conditioned is in my view a strong plus; the beer will change over time, but drunk fresh it is vibrant, flavorful and aromatic. One of the best porters out there."
"Opinion: I think that this is probably one of the best American Porters that I have had. I would not put it in the same category as Fullers London Porter because the ingredients are obviously Americanesque. I really like the balance of this beer and applaud its drinkability. I would definitely drink this beer again."
"cheers..."
"Pours out a beautiful big head that came over. It leaves a good strong lacing as well. The color is black, doesn't let any light through at all. The head eventually thins out into a small cover above the beer. Smell is a little spicy with some chocolate malts and a slight little bit of some roastiness. The taste is chocolatey with a slight coffee flavor, mainly I get chocolatey malts. The mouthfeel is smooth and nice, full bodied and silky smooth. Overall this is a drinkable porter and will have more of this fine beverage."
"Pours an opaque brown-black with a moderate tan head that fades quickly, but leaves nice lacing. The smell is slightly sour, with chocolate and coffee notes present. The taste is delicious - perfectly balanced roasted bitterness and sweetness with flavors of milk chocolate, hint of coffee, slight sourness, and no discernable hop presence. The mouthfeel is smooth and slightly creamy and drinkability is about as good as it gets. This is not a beer for those that love big and extreme flavors, but is very well balanced and delicious. A fine effort from Bell's and currently my favorite American Porter."
"This is a more-than-solid porter from Bell's, they sure do know how to make their beers up there in Kalamazoo. Real good."
"I enjoyed this but it was nothing special for the type of beer.Solid though and I would have again."
"Poured from a 12oz. brown bottle into my Dogfish shaker glass. Appears a dark translucent brown color with about two fingers of light tan head. The foam leaves a nice lace on the inside of the glass. Smells fruity and nutty with hints of toasted bread. Tastes of bitter coffee and chocolate followed by hazelnuts and walnuts. Finish is semi-dry and mildly bitter. A little thin in the mouth with medium carbonation. This is a nice porter. I'd seek it out again. Recommended."
"D - I split this case with DakotaBlue...we were looking for a good all-around, cold-weather beer that wasn't too hoppy (we both have our refrigerators full of hops, so we needed something different), and this hit the mark. A very good session porter."
"Bells is one of my favorite brewers and being from the area the drive to K-zoo is never to far! Solid beer and always has a place in my fridge"
"D- I'll have several. It makes me thirsty for more."
"Appearance was dark as night. Light tan foam lingers around the edge of the glass the whole time. Alcoholic kind of smell along with hints of malted barley. Same dark malted barley taste. Rich! Taste is average for a dark beer. Mouthfeel is nice with smooth low carbonation. Not bad, but not great either."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a medium body. The beer starts sort of sweet and finishes dry. This beer is very easy to drink. This is not the greatest porter of all time but is still solid. I will have this again."
"Recommended."
"Drinkability: A great porter and pleasantly surprised on how good this is."
"Drink ability & Notes: A easy drinking middle of the road porter that has a taste that common people would enjoy, I'd think"
"Body is nearly medium, with a slick and creamy mouthfeel and outstanding drinkability. A perfect body for the style-light enough to be seriously drinkable, yet packs enough flavor to be very satisfying. Me likey."
"A nice roasty robust porter. Flavorful, balanced, and clean. A nice drinking beer, and very easy to session."
"This is one of the better American porters I have run into with a solid and flavorful presence. More of a dark brown than a black and the flavor also seems to be a little understated. Still a very fine porter and worth seeking out or pairing with food."
"Drinkability: Nice session beer. I really like that not all brewers have gone solely ""extreme."""
"A heavy moothfeel with a chewy texture from the hops. I experience a fairly significant bitterness in the roasted ending that lingers a bit. A little dry and more complex than porters that I'm more accustomed to."
"Batch 7766. Poured into a pint glass, left a rather thin head that was mostly off white with darker patches. The head quickly diminished after the first sip. The aroma and taste was mostly of black malt, which I prefer in a porter over chocolate malt. I prefer chocolate malt in stouts, so this was right up my alley. The hops were very subtle, almost unnoticeable, but seemed to do their job balancing out as the malt was not over aggressive. This is certainly a full bodied porter for one that is only 6%. Very drinkable on a cold winter night."
"This is a nice porter that is fiarly drinkable. And while it's a sold offering, I think I would pass this up for something either more bold or sweeter, especially as winter rolls in."
"Pours a dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice fizzy tan head, very nice sticky lacing afterwards and throughout the drink. The nose is slightly malty, and caramel. The taste pretty much follows the nose, malty and slight caramel. Light-Medium body. Drinkable, a nice little porter."
"Pours black with a brown tints and a small dark tan head that faded quickly. Smells like roasted malts with deep rich notes, with some sweet tones. This one was very inviting. Taste is very full and roasted, slight burnt flavor, but mostly malts. Mouthfeel is a thicker medium, not as thick as some, with a good balance of flavors and carbonation. This is a very drinkable porter, nothing that stands out, but a great brew. I highly suggest this beer. Another great bells beer. Cheers!"
"Tasted: 01/01/07"
"Pours a five finger brown head that fades to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Nearly black, faint hints of mahogany color. Light-medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Slight baker's chocolate nose. Starts balanced, flavor is baker's chocolate. $1.49 for a 12oz bottle from Chalet Party Goshen, In. Batch #7156."
"Good beer that's held up surprisingly well but lacks overall complexity. Many thanks to BeerBeing for this one."
"12 oz., batch 7693 - packaged on 10/16. It pours smoothly into the mug to reveal an unfiltered black, almost thick body with a 2 finger coffee-with-cream head that leaves nice lacing. It smells of dark and lightly sweet malts with chocolate and roasted/earthy notes. The flavor is the same, but adds piney and lightly citric hops, oats?, lactose?, and a minerally quality on top of a medium, fairly carbonated, yet creamy smooth body that easily glides down the gullet. Overall a quality porter."
"Mouthfeel was smooth with a thin to medium body. Appropriate for the style. A pleasant beer."
"A heckuva nice porter. Right up there with the best of them."
"This beer pours a deep, almost espresso-like brown with a decent, frothy head. The smell of this brew is unremarkable, but one can pick up a bit of roasted malt and some yeast. As for drinking, this beer is pleasantly light for a porter leading to it being very drinkable. At the same time, however, it does not seem to quite live up to the advertising of its appearance. As dark as it looks, this beer does not have quite as complex nor as deep a flavor as I would expect. This flaw is remedied if one allows the beer time to warm a bit as I feel that this makes the beer a bit sweeter and allow some of its 'maltiness' to come out. Initially, I thought this to be a rather unremarkable porter--but on second (and third) thought, I guess it deserves an upgrade--to a very solid offering from a fine brewer."
"entirely too drinkable, and another very pleasant bell's product."
"This is really quite the quaffable brew, especially as it warms a bit. As it warms the roast character becomes a bit more balanced by the sweeter chocolate like maltiness and a mouthfeel that picks up a bit more heft to it. Quite the enjoyable brew, definitely a good beer for this ""Arizona chilly"" evening."
"D: Another good one from Bell's, but I think this could be a tad better. Flavors could be more pronounced, but the mouth fell can't be beat. A good one to seek out though."
" I found this to be an excellent American Porter, very well balanced with a rich roasted malty backbone. I now have another BellÂ’s beer to keep in the fridge at all times."
"Mouthfeel is satisfyingly full, but not too heavy. Very drinkable porter."
"I like dark beer and this is a good beer. I might just drink the whole 6-er tonight!"
"Thanks to malthead for this one!"
"D -This is a very good porter. Sometimes If I am not in the mood for a porter it can come off a bit too smoky ,but other then that, very easy drinking and tasty."
"A very good porter, and spot-on to the style to boot. A solid beer all-around and one well worth picking up."
"D: Very drinkable--this is my favorite example of the style and my favorite Bell's beer thus far. Equally good in the bottle or on tap. A well-balanced beer with lots of complex flavors."
"EDIT: After having read the other reviews, I really think my bottle was not fresh. I hope to review this again at some point."
"On the palate this beer is a nice medium heavy beer. The carbonation is in check, does not get in the way of the beer's flavor. Would've been really great if the creaminess of the head was reflected more in the overall mouthfeel of the brew. As to the drinkability, I will definitely be buying this porter again. It is a great porter, and represents the style very well and quite accurately."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, not heavy and this could become a great Fall session beer."
"drinkability: good"
"An OK beer, but there are much more enjoyable samples of the style available."
"Bell's with another winner, not a surprise in my book, as they are quite possibly my favorite of all American Breweries."
"This is a fine, easy drinking porter. If any brewery does dark ales better, please tell me. Another winner from Bell's"
"The body is medium to full. Has a fairly crisp carbonation. A bit creamy. Great lingering finish. This is easily a new session beer for me."
"Dark cola brown inkiness. Soft, fluffy, stable head of light cocoa brown. Wet cordwood, campfire, roasted brown sugar, tobacco, chocolate liqueur. Light roasted bitterness up front. Peaty, baking chocolate sweet middle gives way to roasted tobacco hop bitterness. Finish shows flashes of malt sweetness. Medium-bodied with a creamy, yet lively feel. Not my favorite BellÂ’s brand, but solid."
"A great beer all around, but doesn't have a huge ""wow"" factor. I've enjoyed everything that I've had from bell's so far. Can't wait to try some more of them."
"D: The porter is very drinkable, an enjoyable darker brew for the fall season."
"Cheers!"
"Deep brown color with a tan head. Very active carbonation bubbles give it a cola appearance. Smell of burnt toasted malt and chocolate. Also some earthy hop notes. Taste is nice, with a good chocolate sweetness followed by some finishing bitterness and that typical porter smokey taste. Mouthfeel comes off a little thin, but i think this is due to the high carbonation level, it's very bubbly on the tongue. I enjoyed this one."
"Drinkability: A nice middle of the road porter, with good chocolate flavor and a commendable balance of sweet and roasty flavors"
"Very drinkable. Strong flavors throughout without being heavy at all. Even light. Carbonation probably helps with that, although my only disappointment."
"Overall, a decent beer, but I was expecting something more from Bell's."
"Overall - This was a good American Porter. Nicely balanced and has morning to night drinkability potential. Maybe not the best that's out there, but worth a try if you run across it."
"GET MY BUZZ ON-maybe"
"The drinkability is great, nothing done wrong here. Thank you shbobdb for suppling this fine brew. Prosit, MK"
"D: Not a bad porter. Nothing really stand out but certainly enjoyable."
"Served up in a pint glass as black as could be with barely a trace of a head remaining after only a brief 10 foot journey from the tap. Smell is decent although faint, and offers roasted malts with some coffee. Taste is very smoky upfront, which dissolves into espresso, chocolate and nutty flavors with an overall mustiness that carries through to the end. Somewhat thin, but oily with a lasting roasted malt flavor. Nice smooth session type porter."
"This one gives Edmund Fitzgerald a run for it's money and may be better in my very humble opinion."
"Pretty dark in color, but a fair amount of reddish mahogany through the bottom and edges. Caramel colored head drops quickly to a ring. The Aroma is rich and creamy, coco and malty like, some roasted coffee, and some good fresh hops as well. I was really impressed with the flavor of this beer so let me gush, the flavor was like a mint leaf on chocolate ice cream, only the mint was fresh floral hops and the chocolate ice cream was roasted barley malt. There are some good espresso notes in the background as well. I might have to go out on a limb and say this is my favorite porter I have ever had. Relativly smooth mouthfeel and oh so easy to drink. One of Bell's year round beers that gets over looked all too often."
"This one is an easy going easy drinker that could be very very sessionable."
"Drinkability: this one goes down very easy for the style. Flavorful and this is considered a session porter in my book. Great on tap."
"Overall- An OK porter that, for me, was all over the place. The look, taste, and feel were all inconsistant. Not bad though!! I'd definitely drink again!"
"Overall: A solid offering, with a unique flavor profile-mostly because of the amount of burnt flavors. I liked it a lot, but I'm not sure if it is for the ""everyday Porter drinker."" I would have liked to see smoother flavors. Worth a pick up."
"Bottle courtesy of Hogtownharry: Poured a pitch black porter with a medium foamy head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of roasted malt with some very subtle coffee notes is interesting but a bit weak. Taste is a mix between bitter roasted malt with some subtle sweet chocolate note. Body is a bit thin IMHO. Definitely not the best offer from this otherwise fine brewer."
"Poured out into a pint glass, beer had a nice head that eventually died down to a thin layer around the top. Beer has a very dark color, with a good amount of lacing that follows down the glass. The smell is of nutty roasted malt, and the taste reflects the same with a good balance of hops with a slight aftertaste kick of hops. After drinking, the standing taste is of the roasted malt, actually pretty nice. The mouthfeel is very good; it is perfectly carbonated and has a relatively heavy body. Overall this beer is pretty drinkable and I would recommend trying it."
"Mouthfeel is initially slightly zesty, then dissapates into the character promised in the nose. Very tasty, and lingers quite well in the mouth. Smooth and solid. This is my new standard for American Porters. Thank you Bell's. I wouldn't change much with this one & yes, I'll take another."
"D: Very good."
"DÂ—a solid porter. I would have this again in a heartbeat. It gets much better as it warms."
"Tubal, Gog, Magog, Rosh, Meshech and Gomer walk into a bar. The bartender says, ""Oh my God is this the end of the world?"" To which Tubal sternly replies, ""No, we're just here for a little BREW-haha."" HA HA HA right? Well this isn't funny beer nor is it holy. But I did once write the reknowned preacher Jack Van Impe and he told me during his television program broadcast to millions of pilgrims across the globe that even though I was a heathen I had a good heart and was on the right path. With this porter you too are on the right path. Maybe not to salvation or armageddon(be that your thing) but to a little-lot of satisfaction. It's not the velvet licorice of ""the Pils"" per se nor does it wear the choco-mocha halo that other black lagers do but it definitely brings home a little divinity and by God you need some you little warthogs!"
"Drinkability - this is excellent ale. It goes down well, and is very sessionable."
"Think of this as a light porter. Pretty good, but light, and therefore very drinkable."
"Not a bad stout, definitely not my favorite but it shows a lot of promise, good initial taste moving to something a bit too sour for me, but still very drinkable. I imagine this is much better on tap. An almost bitter finish. Not bad for quenching my thirst, but I can think of better stouts that are just as available. Overall a nice try, but not my cup of tea."
"Thanks to thefatkid13 for the trade. Pours very dark for a porter, a deep, deep brown nearing black. A small brown head is present for just a flourish before retreating to a thin coating. Nice aroma of rich roasted malt, with a hint of dark sweet fruit. Palate is nice and complex - roasted malt, raisins, muted fruity hops, and a little bit of lactose sweetness. Body is nice and sturdy, although it could stand to be a bit creamier. Overall, a nice, well-balanced porter."
"Near black in color. Perhaps the bartender poured it a little too safely, but regardless, there was no head. Roasted malt and dark chocolate on the nose. Full-bodied mouthfeel. Flavors of dark chocolate and roasted bitterness are detected first. Then the flavor sort of takes a step back midway through before a strong vinous finish. Hop bitterness is higher than average for a porter, but adds more depth the overall flavor rather than detract from it. Very enjoyable. 5.25% is a little high to qualify as a session, but I could drink this all night long."
"D: Very good. Goes down smoothly."
"Poured with a nice tan head and a dark brown color. It had a roasted, slight nutty aroma, with maybe a hint of something chocolatey. The taste was similar, but more complex, with some flavors I couldn't pick out. Maybe banana. Plenty of generic ""dark roasted"" flavor, but it was good. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy, and it drank easy. A good porter."
"This and GLBC's Edmund are my favorite porters. Another great beer from Bell's."
"This is a really good session beer. It is highly drinkable in my opinion."
"12 ounce bottle. Bell's Porter pours out a very dark brown color with a large, tan head. Nice lacing. Grainy aroma along with some chocolate. Grainy malt flavor with some burnt coffee. There is a bit of astringency. Some woody hops come in at the finish. Slightly creamy mouthfeel, though the carbonation is higher than average. Good drinkability. Overall, this is a pretty good, flavorful porter, but it's nothing exceptional."
"100th review YAY!!!"
"D: It was over all good but I can't see myself rushing out and getting another one."
"As I said to begin with, this is damned good beer. Buy several. Wish I had room in my trunk for more than the one mixed case I'm taking back to FL with me. :)"
"Appeared black in color with a thick, mocha colored head leaving behind splotches of lacing. Aromas of mocha, chocolate, alcohol, and roasted malt. The taste followed the scent with the addition of subtle hop flavors. A nice bitter finish making the beer more bitter-sweet than sweet alone. Somewhat creamy and bready, but not overdone. Smooth finish adds to the drinkability."
" but not all that impressed or memorable."
"Another solid offering."
"Dark brown brew shows no light under an ample dark-tan head that leaves a bit of nice lacing. Smells bitter and roasty, with a slight sweetness and some coffee. Flavor starts out sweet and fruity, with notes of apples and grapes. Dark roast malt flavors are light, well balanced with the sweets. Very little hop bittering makes for a sweet finish. Moderate body with pleasant carbonation is right on target for this brew. Drinkable, but basic. A little more robustness would be welcome."
"D: Okay, but I don't think I'd get this again. Other porters do the style much better."
"Pours a very deep brown color with faint ruby hues at the edges. A finger of tan head falls to a full quarter inch over top of the brew without breaking. Very solid looking beer. Nose is not quite where I was expecting it to be. I'm getting nuttyness, light roast and a kiss of caramel sweetness. There is a touch of coffee when I take a really big whiff, but the nutty character is dominant. Flavor is better. Very solid roasty character, moving to a light coffee with caramel sweetness and light chocolate notes. This is a tasty brew. The sweetness and caramel follow up in the finish as well. Feel is at the fuller end of moderate with a solid moderate carbonation to balance things. Substantial, but not overwhelming. This is easily a session beer. I think the flavor and feel are the best parts of this brew. A porter I could have any season. Its pretty good."
"This is a very good porter. Not best in class, but a great benchmark porter. As per usual, Bell's doesn't make a bad beer that I've noticed."
"Drinkability- Because everything about this beer is so strong, almost overpowering, it is difficult to have a high drinkability rating. More than two of these would be next to impossible I would say, one is just enough to take in and enjoy its bold flavor."
"Very full and warming flavor. Perfect at room temperature. Great winter beer. Little bits of sulfur wrapped loosely around heavily toasted malts. Little bit of dark chocolate. Anotehr flavor that reminds me of roasted marshmallows. Slight hop bitterness that at first was not very apparent but came out the more I drank--a very subtle pine. Full feel and very smooth. Tough to put this beer down."
"Roasted coffee/malt/chocolate dominate the aroma. Deep black with a thumb thick, lasting, mocha head. Flavor is dominated by the dark malt then you get some coffee, chocolate and even mild molasses notes. A fantastic tasting porter that stands up to the best Porters in the world."
"Verdict- Not a bad porter. It didn't blow me away, but it's a flavorful and pleasing beer."
"Poured a Guiness-like black into a pint glass with full foamy, two finger head that is tan in color. Twelve ounce bottle marked batch #7156. Smells of roasted coffee, grains, a little grassy, dark chocolate bitter sting in the nose. Taste is very much the same, hoppier than expected yet well balanced. Light on the tongue, moderate carbonation, finished slightly bitter at the end. Nice porter, I've had better examples of this style but still well executed brew nonetheless."
"Moutfeel is a bit thin/fizzy. I almost feel like the carbonation is getting in the way of the taste. I've had this beer on tap before and there was just more flavor all around. Still, quite a drinkable porter (though Bell's website says 6% ABV, not 5.25). One of my favorites of the style."
"Purchased from Beer Depot in Ann Arbor. Pours a 1.5 finger brown head that's creamy thick. The beer itself is pitch black with brown edgings when held to light. Smells chocolate with some black patent and a grassy dry coffee. Tastes wet sweet fighting a dry roast. Noticable chocolate is complimented by and compliments the malt sweet. A strong, but not over-bearing cherry sour from black malt pulls the beer in an interesting direction. Well done. Woody or cotton-like hop feel with a Fuggles flavor. Nice lacing on the inside of the glass. Md body and a bit too sharply carbonated. After swirling to release carb, the beer became much drier and the coffee flavor was augmented."
"A solid, robust Porter here."
"Drinkability- Another great sessions beer if you like the dark stuff."
"Mouth/Drink Â– Sharp and crisp, but very light bodied, almost watery. You can drink these, but I sure expected more."
"This is an easy drinking porter."
"Another solid beer from BellÂ’s Brewery, Inc. Keep up the great work!!"
"The code 7098 printed on the back label indicates that my Bell's Porter was bottled on October 6, 2005. Received this bottle from CRJMellor as part of SS '05."
"Mouth, it offers bitter in the right places, and seems pretty creamy. Again, good. Drinkability is rock solid, very quaffable. Another solid year around offering by Bell's."
"CheersÂ…"
"Full mouth that leaves just a trace of oil. A solid session porter."
"All-around this is an excellent porter; highly recommended."
"On draught at BW3 of all places. Deep opaque brown with a medium tan head that lasts nicely. Good lacing too. The aroma is chocolatey and bready. Smooth and rich on the palate, and consists of chocolate, coffee and malt flavors. Lightly bitter coffee and hops in the finish. 3 tall glasses of this went down easy during the 2nd half of a football game, what more can you ask of a beer?"
"Very smooth richness enters the mouth with a well balanced blend of malt and hops. Noticeable notes include toffee, coffee and a nice finish that is complimented by a mellow hop bitter feel. Mouthfeel is very clean. Very drinkable for any remote fan of porters. One of the best porters I've had."
"The cask-conditioning and hand-pull may have had something to do with it, but this was an excellent porter. Smooth mouthfeel, great balance between the hops and roasted malts and tame sweetness, combine to make this one of the most ideal session porters that have passed my lips."
"Very good beer. I had it from a 12 oz bottle. Poured very dark with an almost tan head. Excelent taste, great smell, and aftertaste was great. Had a dark roasted taste. I loved it. I would recomend this beer to anybody. I can't wait to drink it again."
"D: This is a very non-obtrusive porter that goes down easy and might be a good introduction to darker (or perhaps more flavorful) beers for the uninitiated. For me, I'll go with Fuller's London or GL Edmund Fitz next time."
"Pours a clear dark brown, some red highlights lurking on the edges, a pretty thick tan head, some nice lacing on the glass. Smell is chocolate, mocha, toffee, very roasty and rich. Taste is chocolate roast, coffee, clean and malty goodness, toffee and nice roast bitterness. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, very smooth and my favourite porter."
"Overall: Nothing amazing or Earth-shattering, but a tasy, well-made porter. It's not my favorite in the style, but it's a solid choice."
"This is a fantastic beer. The only negative aspect was the lack of head. Rich, malty and complex. This is a great american porter."
"D - At the 5.25% it is a bit redeeming, but not the best porter you'll have."
"Another solid staple beer from Bell's. Poured out to a nice black color that let little light through when held to the light. Nice brown cream colored head was thick and dense. Aromas of smoke, chocolate and mild malt were well received and prepared the drinker for the taste that was to follow. Taste was great, very well balanced and complex; flavors of malt, roasted nuts, smoke and earth were interweaved well, with a solid malt backbone. Very nice. Mouthfeel was full, yet not overly heavy as one would expect. High level of drinkability, this is going to a a great brew for the winter months that lay ahead. Highly recommended."
"This brew pours a brownish black with a large tan head. The aroma is of rosted malt and coffee. The taste is absolute heaven. Rosted malt with a hint of coffee. Not overpowering or ni your face, but still flavorful. This just might be the perfect session beer. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with perfect carbonation. Overall, this is another great beer from Bell's."
"Drinkability: Nice session brew here. It won't knock your socks off with complexity, but a solid porter. Very easy to drink, and reasonable ABV."
"very dark brown pour with slight tan head, splotchy foam atop a dark as night beer. aroma here is intense, 100% mochaccino nose with sweet caramel accent. some toffee.. one of the best smells ive ever gotten from a porter. body is a bit thin and bubbly for what i expect, but this beer does not skimp on flavor. medium coffee ground bitterness and a more pointed bitterness from hops combine to even out a sweeter subtle flavor of cream and underripe red fruit. very drinkable and good at both room-temperature and a chilled degree. bell's is one brewery i've found to be consistently above-average to good and i will continue to seek out their products."
"Man, before I even taste it, the coffee and caramel smells are almost overwhelming. Not a great head or lacing, a bit thin in that catagory. This one gets better as it settles to room temperature, but not by too much. Malty and roasted, a bit acidic as well. Pretty easy to drink for the style and okay mouthfeel."
"Mouthfeel is slightly dry with active carbonation...very roasty on the palate. I would not be against having a few of these...could even be sessionable. Overally, it's a tasty, unique porter."
"A very thick porter, almost opaque. Not much head, but pretty good lacing. Smells nice and roasted, a little hoppy, and, unexpectedly, a little vinuous. Tastes vinuous as well, and the carbonation makes it seem eerily similar to sparkling grape juice. Has a nice hop bite at the end to complement the upfront sweetness. Ordinarily, I'd be much more surprised at how hoppy this porter is, but it really can't compare to the Summit Great Northern--which is a good thing. Bell's is much more sensibly hopped, more balanced, and much better. Definitely different than any other porter I've had."
"Never the less still a very drinkable"
"Deep brown color with a Â½ inch tan head. The head receded quickly, and left little lace. The aroma is subtler than most porters IÂ’ve had. It has the roast malt with espresso aromas IÂ’m used to, but there is also a bit of walnut, and toffee in the nose. The flavor was a real surprise. There is a sweetness to the beer that is tough to characterize. It has a bit of black cherry, more of the toffee, and the espresso in the finish. The hops just give it a nice kick of bitterness. Nice smooth, rich mouth feel I expect from this brewery. Great drinkability. I could really get to like porters drinking this beer."
"My first glass of this was not so positive. That is what I get for drinking it cold. This second glass I let get a bit warmer, and the flavors just bloomed. If you try this and think it is a bit too watery and thin, you are drinking it too cold. Let it sit out for at least a half hour, and you will then enjoy a rich brew. At this point I am recommending this beverage. I've got a few more bottles, and I'll update this review if my opinions differ from what I am writing."
"Pours black with some amber highlights. Nice 1"" tan head that leaves some minimal lacing. Smell is smokey and roasted malt with a hop bite. Taste follows suit - quite smokey, roasted malts, maybe a hint of burnt coffee, with a slight hoppy, alcoholic bite. Interesting on my palate and not what I have grown accostomed to from the several porters I've had. Not very much sweetness or chocolate notes at all. Mouthfeel is nice, creamy and well-carbonated which makes drinkabilty good. I could put a few of these back, but the bitter, smokiness might get to me after a couple. Not my favorite porter, I think I prefer a sweeter, maltier, chocolatier palate, but worth a try."
"OVERALL COMMENTS: DidnÂ’t have to work too hard to find out what a terrific brew this is, and how worthy it is to carry the BellÂ’s name on the label. Almost makes me wish I lived in Michigan (well, letÂ’s not get carried away)Â…"
"The beer is very easy to drink and quite tasty. A nice brew that I would seek out again."
"Very dark brown in colour with a tan head and light carbonation. The aromas are of dark crystal malt, some roasted grains, dark chocolate, and pencil shavings. There are some very assertive roasted nut flavors, along with notes of alcohol, dark fruit, and chocolate. Long finish. Generally, I like my porters a bit more mellow, but I still found this one to be quite satisfying"
"Aroma: Malty aroma characteristic of a dark bread. Appearance: Garnet and so dark you cannot determine clarity. A thin tan head dissapated quickly leaving a ring of fine bubbles in the glass. Flavor: As my eyes roll back in my head from the ecstacy of this top notch porter. Dark roasted malts contribute a nice roasted coffee and chocolate flavors to the malt backbone of this brew. Bitterness balances the malt well carrying through in the aftertaste. Finishes a bit sweet. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, and appropriately carbonated. Overall: Damn, even though I don't smoke, I need a cigarette. IMHO this is the best commercial example of a Robust Porter to be found anywhere."
"Overall a solid porter that's (again) very fresh smelling/tasting. The label states 'robust...rich...', I beg to differ. This is an even keel offering that requires no forethought. Not overpowering at all, might even be well suited for the summer where you might think a porter wouldn't fit in (?). Just open, pour & drink."
"D- This is a wonderful porter and a very drinkable beer. It has all the big taste of a porter but the grain bill is not a watered down stout."
"Very nice all-around beer here. I am impressed and I'd recommend this one to anybody. Cheers to the people at the Kalamazoo Brewing Company! Nice Work!"
"Drinkability: I could easily see myself going through a ton of these. This immediately jumps to the top of my list of porters and only stands behind Edmund Fitzgerald as far as I'm concerned. KBC got this one dead on...nice job."
"Overall, an excellent porter. Coffee-like and bitter, but very pleasing."
"Overall, pretty tasty, but somehow just not as smooth and drinkable as my favorite porters (Anchor Porter, Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Fuller's London Porter and Goose Island English Malt Porter all come to mind as much more drinkable)."
"Deep, dark brown with a thick mocha colored head. Smells of smoky roasted malts, a little nutty, and suprisingly, a faint whiff of alcohol. Taste is sweet caramel, slightly burnt, some coffee notes and bittersweet chcolate. Well balanced hop finish. Mouthfeel is very smooth. I could throw these back all night long."
"12 oz. bottle. Deep brown color with some ruby highlights. Thick tan foamy head. Good retention. Lightly roasted coffee and cocoa nose. Nice roasty flavor, slight bittersweet chocolate flavor. Good amount of bitterness overall. Even though it had bitterness, it was still pretty smooth overall. Creamy mouthfeel really seals the deal here. Very drinkable. Excellent session porter here. No quality problems in this beer today for me."
"Drinkability & Notes: Just an easy drinking middle of the road porter that has a good amount of flavor pack in it."
"Overall, I've had better porters, and I've had better Bell's beers. Then again, I've had worse Bell's beers than this. Not one to be avoided, but not one to seek out either, especially If you have, say, Summit Great Northern Porter available to you, at a better cost and a better taste as well."
"The sourness became somewhat annoying after awhile, but this was still a good beer."
"Pours deepest brown, almost black. Chocolate milk colored head. Raisiny, dark roasted coffee, chocolate and black patent malts in the nose. A bit overcarbonated which throws off my first impression of weakness and scattered tastes. I swirl and let it sit... Definitely a good roasty flavor and a flowery hop bouquet gives it an extra dimension of depth. It is pretty astringent, both malty and hoppy. It is pretty good, thinner than some porters, but a solid drinkable porter. I had it on-draft before and remembered liking it a bit better than in the bottle."
"A proper porter, from a brewery reknown for stouts."
"This black colored brew lets some amber hues through with the light, and is topped with a khaki head. Rich coffee scent, bits of chocolate. Taste is rich creamy malts, both cocolate and coffee, and is followed by a nice light hop presence. Full creamy mouth. This isnt my favorite style but this one was quite good."
"Thick and chewy mouthfeel that doesn't dissappoint. It leaves a nice coating of slick malt as it dissappears. I'm going for another, awesome beverage!"
"Solid porter. Really like the subtle sweet chocolate flavor."
"Drinkability and Overall: Another great offering from Bell's, but not their best. This is a solid porter that is quite enjoyable to drink, but offers nothing special. I'd have another, but would I buy a case of this? No. Still quite good."
"Had this one on a recent trip to Ann Arbor and I wasn't disappointed. It poured a nice dark brown with ruby highlights and a dense, light brown head that showed good retention and lacing on the glass. Very pretty. The aroma was a pleasant combination of rich roasted malts and nuttiness. The flavour was very malty, with plenty of roasted character and a light, balanced bitterness. The finish was slightly dry and conducive to having another bottle/pint. Medium bodied and medium carbonation."
"nice brown color, with off white head.nice lacing. aroma, malts, roasted nuts, coffee, caramel.flavor, got malts and roasted nuts aroma, with coffee and chocolate a slight bitter after taste and a little watery not a bad porter but I have had better."
"This beer didn't disappoint me. The longer I drank the more I liked."
"I was excited to try this beer, as it represents one of my favorite styles from one of my favorite breweries. Sadly, I was not very impressed. The appearance is quite nice - a deep, dark black that only lets the tiniest bit of golden brown shine through at the bottom of the glass when held up to a light. The head is rather thick and is a creamy, brownish ivory color. The aroma is the weakest aspect of this beer in my opinion. I don't get the complex roasted scent I normally pick up from a porter, but rather an almost unpleasant smell that reminds me somewhat of my least favorite Bell's concoction, the Third Coast Beer. The taste is definitely a step up from the smell, but still is not up to what I consider a really good porter. The hoppy, chocolately, roasted elements that make up a porter are all there, but seem a little hidden behind a rather boring watery base. I doubt I'll pick this one up again."
"I sampled this next to a bottle of Edmund Fitzgerald Porter from Great Lakes and this was much better."
"Pours out deep dark brown black with a nice thick light tan head. Tastes good and roasty with a very smooth mouthfeel. Hop balance is light and restrained, yet crisp. Without question amoung the best porters I've tried."
"But the beer takes a sad turn here. The aroma and appearance lead me to believe that the flavor would be spectacular but it is anything but that. The taste has some coffee, nuts, and earthy leaf in it. A bit of sourness causes some puckering. Overall the flavor and body are disappointing for such a great looking brew."
"This is an exquisitely drinkable porter, I was hooked after the first sip. Pours out a deep black colour with a dark walnut brown nimbus, big spongy biege head that eventually recedes to a ring and leaves some lacing. Some floating sediment can be seen even in the black body, suspended yeast particles would be my wager. Very enticing bold aroma of dry roasted malt, dark chocolate, and almost a burnt hickory woodsy aroma kicking around in there, as well as small traces of coffee beans. The flavour profile seems pretty simple to me, just a whirling unison of roasted malt and sweet chocolate, with a dry earthy aftertaste, but it works in all the right places. By far the best porter I have tried all year. A little watery in the mouthfeel, but that is the only slight blemish I am experiencing. A rousing round of applause for northyorksammy for sending one of these over to me, it was greatly enjoyed."
"Nice deep brown color-almost black actually.Nice malty aroma-slight hints of chocolate,some roastiness.Really good toasted chocolate flavor up front.Very slight hop bitterness.Some residual sweetness.Good mouthfeel-has a tinge of oiliness to it-somewhat stout like but fits in well here.A great beer-well worth trying and enjoying on a regular basis."
"The beer pours a deep dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice roasted/toastey scent with chocolate hints and a sweet,yet dry finish. The taste is good. It has a crisp, dry, yet malty flavor that has a roasted quality and a slightly sweet finish. It has a chocolate aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine porter. It has excellent aroma and flavor; a good drinker."
"It kind of reminded me of a a watered down Guinness."
"12 ounce bottle smuggled back by AKSmokedPorter."
"Drinkability/Overall: I love Bell's, but I was not too impressed with this brew. I haven't lost hope yet though, because I know they have had problems with bottling. This is the first opened beer of a six-pack, so if I notice any dramatic differences, I will edit my review."
"Poured into a 20 oz pint glass. poured black in dim lighting. a whip cream thick, khaki-colored head. this one stuck around throughout the glass. lacing left rings in the glass, quite a beautiful thing. nose was not too strong, but as with all porters, it was of roasted malts, rather earthy. taste was of dark bitter chocolate, coffeebeans, and i noticed a bit of a woody taste, i cant say what kind, but it was there. there was a bit of an alcohol bite, but it was nowhere near overpowering or a detriment to the brew. Mouthfeel was thick without being too heavy, very nice. an easy drinking brew, not something that one could put down massive amounts of though, rather filling. overall i thouroghly enjoyed this porter. one of the best ive had to date. delightful."
"Appearance of this beer is a deep deep deep amber, almost black but you can still see through it when held up to the light. Poured with a medium tan colored and had good lace. Smell of sweet roasted malt with some chocolate and coffe overtones and a hint of smokiness. Taste is very good, a beautiful blend. Not to roasty or smoky like many other porters, but close to a perfect porter blend. The matiness bleds extreamly well with the roastyness. Mouthfeel is very good for a porter, normally I can only drink one porter but I could easily drink 2 or 3 of these. Its not too heavy of overpowering, nor does it leave a long strong aftertaste. A truely great porter."
"BellÂ’s should have the rights to ""Perfect Porter"" instead of Bert GrantÂ’s. This is possibly the best porter IÂ’ve had, which doesnÂ’t surprise me coming from the Kings of the Dark. The body is a very dark mahogany-brown. ItÂ’s almost black, but light pierces through even the center of the beer. The dark beige head is thick and pitted and lasted nicely. The aroma is fully and malty sweet with chocolate malt riding over a hint of roast. The flavor is thick with an almost chocolate cake with mocha icing. Maybe the tiniest bit of smoke. The body is full for a porter, but not a heavy as a stout. A bit velvety."
"Vanilla and wine Aroma and taste like a bit of wine. Top porter. Tan foam on black. Malty with Coffee bean, buttery chocolate and hickory, and carbonation. Creamy with yeast and caramel, a winning pleasure. Spicy aftertaste. Markled it down a bit on tasting May 2005."
"This beer is absolutely AMAZING!!! First of all, I would almost always choose a hefty ale over a stout or porter, so for this to knock my socks off was very impressive. The head on this lasts forever and the flavors emerge more with each sip. There is definately a hint of vanilla in this one. A very clean finish with a sweet taste. This is a much more lively porter than others I have tried. Overall, this is no doubt becoming my saftey blanket porter!"
"Final Thought: Save this for your first, maybe second beer in a sitting or session, pending your tolerance."
"with porter being my favorite style i would have to reccomend this beer. it ranks up pretty close to my fav. ed, fitz but just a little off. definitely worth a try though"
"It pours a nice deep brown with a light head. The first sip is bitter but not overly so. It has the pleasant almost nutty flavor. A rather mild porter without a stong hop bite, very malty. The hops are very cubtle yet distinctly there in the back of the throat. Very little hop aroma but still overall a very drinkable beer. I would easily drink this one again (but then again it is rare to find one that I wont drink again hehe)"
"A drinkable porter, not outstanding, but good."
"Another winner from Bell's."
"Bell's Porter is a quality, quaffable version that lovers of the style should seek out. I acquired this bottle from deejaydan and wish now that it had been multiple bottles."
"Pours dark brown with light mocha head. Great lacing present throughout the glass. Aromas are big here with nice roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee smells. The taste is just as nice. Real roasted malty taste starting things out with a bitter hops lingering at the end. Bitter chocolate very present, but that sweet malty taste smooths things nicely. Moderate carbonation with a relativly light body and no real creamy taste that you get from some porters. It's a decent porter in taste, and you can probably drink these pretty regularly, but I find it too light bodied for me and desire something more here."
"Nice porter. Thanks to feloniousmonk!"
"Very easy drink. I don't usually drink porter, going more for the stouts, but this will be a repeat performer."
"Pours a nice light black color with a medium sized tan foam head. Nose was full of malt and some roast. Taste is a burnt coffee/chocolate mixture. Pretty good if you ask me. This beer finishes with a little bit of hops left on the tongue. It seemed a little bit thin to me. I'd like some additional body in this one, but it is pretty drinkable."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a light brown 1/2"" of thick, foamy head, and laced well. Barely translucent dark brown brew. Deep, dark malts such as coffee and chocolate and maybe, just maybe a smidgen of smoke, dominate the aroma, and the flavor exhibits these characteristics as well. Extremely smooth, and the coffee/chocolate flavors fight for dominance on the tongue. An excellent represntation of the porter style."
"Enjoyed on-tap at the Blue Nile."
"Drinkability: Great. Wonderful porter. If I could get it here I would drink some every week."
"Medium-full body, not much character, kind of like the school bully, it's got a nice kick to it, but it's not too impressive. As much as I enjoy the smell of it, it's dissapointing in flavor, and I would be hard-pressed to drink more than two of these. Don't get me wrong, it is not a bad porter, but it isn't spectacular; it blends into the crowd."
"Thanks for feloniousmonk for this one."
"Thanks Feloniousmonk!"
"Slightly translucent maroon color, creamy tan head. Smells more like a dunkel, dominated by roasted malt. Taste is of coffee, malt, and black licorice. Nice hops finish, but it enhances, not dominates the flavor. Full mouthfeel, perfect amount of carbonation. Very smooth, extremely drinkable."
"Dark brown in color, thin, yet rocky off-tan head. Roasted coffee beans, fresh bread, some hops are also there on the nose. Slick and creamy off the bat, robust per the label, sweet chocolate and toffee notes. Very rich, right on target as medium bodied. A slight hoppy note sneaks in; some charcoal and coffee beans to boot! A roasted/burnt malt based body, backed with some delicious flavorings, quite impressive, highly drinkable, should define what a porter is!"
" This is a well rounded Porter, excellent in all respects."
"A dark black brew, that is nearly opaque. The head is a tan/beige colour and it stays around big time leaving waves of brown lace on my pint glass. The aromas are excellent! Coffee, chocolate, big time caramel malts, and more! The taste follows suit with a lovely smooth mix of hops and malts up front, lovely coffee notes and caramel in the middle, and a smooth as hell maltball finish. The mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, and just right, and the drinkability is great as well! Another winner from Bell's!"
"Pours a lovely dark chocolate brown with an equally nice three finger light tan head. Smells of dark and toasted malt with a hint of licorice. Taste pretty decent. lots of the usual light coffee and caramel/dark malt flavor, with a little bit of toffee and spice. Perhaps just a little too carbonated and hopped to be a great porter, but it's a nice little session brew."
"A deep brown color topped of with a fluffy tan head that almost overflowed my glass. My mouth is watering just looking at this beer. Very nutty smell with a fine roasted malt aroma and hints of coffee. The taste is delicious with a good balance of coffee, nut, and roasted malts. You can really taste the mocha and coffee beans. A very good porter that I'll be buying again and again."
"Deep dark opeque purple look. pale/tan head. Sweet chocolate malted milkshake smell. Good sticky lacing and retention. Dry coffee dominates the taste with a little bitterness and burnt malt in the finish. A little light and thin on the mouth as well. Brew is ok, but I could not drink many of these on a row.."
"Now, this is what I've come to expect from Bell's. A delicious porter, and absolutely one I'm going to have again!"
"Dark as normal, with impressive lacing and an unusual light colored head. It left a maze of a stain. Smelled of nutty coffee and big, smooth, and deceiving dark malts. Tasted of smooth dark malts and solid roasty character, but in a thin way. For the most part I'd call it husky and bordering on coffee flavors. It had just enough hops to create bitterness but not enough to eclipse the already rough malt character, but instead compliment it. A nice porter."
"Strong tasting porter, almost a stout profile to me."
"Pours a very dark brown color with about one finger of tan head and leaves a small amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is of burned malts and also has a dark coffee smell as well. Fairly average aroma for a porter. The main part of the flavor is the roasted malt and coffee. The flavor was not as strong as expected. There was also a hint of chocolate. The mouthfeel was pretty good, and it is easily drinkable."
"The beer pours an opaque brown with mahogany high lights, the head prodigious, frothy and a winsome light tan in color as it slowly fades the lace forms a thick curtain to seal off the glass. Nose is sweet malt, toasted grain, musky, the yeast quite evident, and a treat for the senses; start is ambrosial and rich in malt with the top middling in its feel. Finish as a pesky acidity with the hop pleasurable in their spiciness, quite dry, and a fine representative to the style, how I envy all the people who have BellÂ’s at their beckon call."
"ng"
"Bell's Porter was a pretty good intro to the beers from Kalamazoo Brewing Co. The aroma could have been a bit stronger but the taste made up for it. This would be a good beer to use as an introductory beer to get novices to try a darker colored brew."
"I've enjoyed most of the beers I've had from this brewery (thanks, Al!) and Expedition and Two Hearted are two of the best beers I've ever had. This porter, however, comes across as relatively bland. Kind of reminds me of one of their regular stouts if it were watered down. Somewhat thin, in body and taste. Some roasted malt and coffee notes, but just too thin and flat to be a classic."
"cheers to feloniousmonk for the sample!"
"This is a tasty brew, but to me does not seem to fit the style well. Poured a deep brown with no descernible head. Roasty aroma with plenty of burnt malts and coffee grounds. Flavor was quite bitter and dark, which was nice, but I felt that the beer was extremely thin. Hardly a robust porter at all, and I felt it could have been better balanced. Nice coffee flavors going on here, but could stand to be heartier."
"Appearance: Pours a deep ruby brown chestnut when held up to the light appears with a magnifiant fluffy tan head leaving a big sturdy collar of lacing. Aroma: Not overly sweet but the deep roasted malted barley is robust filled with chocolate and coffee tones, nice and creamy edge. Taste: Flavor is slightly grainy with the dark roasts leaving bitterness in the finish a bit dry as well, ties flavors together solid porter from front to back dead on. Mouthfeel: Creamy texture paints the palate coats it done with a sweet rising moccha cream tone, very nice brew full body wonderful. Drinkability: The best sipping porter none go down easier than this one just so good and flavorful clean well crafted I have much thanks for aaronh for hunting this jewel down for me."
"Cheers to FeloniousM for having this Porter, well, Portered over to the West Coast."
"Thanks to feloniousmonk for the trade on this one."
"The nose is full of coffee notes and buries the substantial roasted malt base in this essence. The flavor is mostly of coffee and roasted malts with a very strong sense of raisins and prunes added into the strong java flavor. The feel is light to medium with a very nice finish for a porter, actually rather crisp rather than smooth and coating. Very drinkable porter."
"Pours black ruby in color with a creamy tan head that fades into a good amount of lace. Nose is rather grainy with some additional notes of burnt coffee. Medium in body and fairly high in carbonation. Taste begins with some unsweetened dark chocolate followed by some fruity yeasts and a bit of sour coffee. Bitter finish. A decent porter but nothing special. Thanks to feloniousmonk for the sample!"
"Compliments of BA Brent, this one pours a deep dark brown, almost black, with a light brown thick head that rests on top of the liquid. I can see particles suspended through the glass. Smell is sweet like brown sugar, with hints of licorice, cocoa, and fig. Flavor is rich, but not overbearing. Coffee, tea, and raisins, finishing with cocoa. Bitter coffee and chocolate fades in from the finish. A few seconds later this turns into a caramel flavor. The flavor morphs as it rolls around the mouth. The finish stays with me. This is a truly awesome beer."
"Midweight in the mouth, where the chocolate malt again predominates. There is a nice underlying base of other malts, though, and the beer is incredibly well-balanced. Rich and long, but the fine bottle carbonation, and a nice acidity keep it moving nicely along. Great porter! Purchased at the brewery's General Store on July 3, 2003."
"Like other reviewers, I have to note that this was more highly carbonated than I had expected, but it is still drinkable. The mouthfeel isn't smooth enough to merit an excellent rating, but the flavors do have a nice way of moving around the palate. Drinkable, but a little bit too carbonated. Still, the lower alcohol makes this a manageable porter for an evening when beer, not alcohol, is called for. Overall a driankable brew, and one which I plan to return to."
"More coffe, with sublte chocolate, complex roast, and a hint of plums. Finishes long and smooth with a nice bittersweet flavor and a touch of citrusy hops. Well rounded & balanced."
"Deep mahogany beer pours with a thick, long lasting cappuchino colored head. Leaves some of the most even lacing I've seen in a while (is it beacuse I drank it so fast? Hmmm.....) Coffee, chocolate, and vanilla notes make this smell more like a great cup of hot chocolate than a beer. Very nice sweetness to the aroma. The taste is choclately, with a sweet cream flavor as well that gradually fades into coffee flavors and nice burnt and roasted notes. Decent bitterness on the finish. It's like a hop-laden mocha-java malted milkshake. Smooth mouthfeel lends to this overall feeling, and boosts the drinkability. Lingering coffee aftertaste is very good. This is a great beer. Everytime I'm about ready to give up on K'zoo, one of my last bottles is something like this. This is another I will buy again."
"Pours a nice opaque black, with a chunky tan head that lasts longer than an argument with my ex. Chocolate and coffee flavors dominate while the aroma brings in subtle spices and just the slightest hint of fruit. Nice slick body leaving a crisp bitter aftertaste. This is a very nice porter, and will get a ton fridge traffic."
"This beer has a very nice chocolate and coffee aroma. It poured a nice head that lasted a very long time and was filled with small to medium bubbles. It has a strong coffee taste with a mild after bite. It went down very smoothly. It has a dark black all but opaque at the bottom of the glass color."
"The beer smells very sweet and I was looking forward to consuming it. The initial taste was of coffee, strong roasted coffee along with some chocolate tones and even a little caramel. However it loses balance with excessive yeastiness. Mouthfeel suffers because of this and as a result the whole beer suffers. Still a good beer to have when planning to drink a lot."
"Pours out into a dark brown brew with a thin, thin head. Mmmm..I smell dark coffee grounds (lots of em), dark roasted malt and of course, a hint of cocoa. Roasted malts dominate, with burnt flavors coming through and hints of smoke and charcoal. Leaves kind of an oatish feel at the back. It has a fizzy texture on the tongue, which is different."
"12 zo bottle. Pours a deep dark brown, with a good head the slowly receded leaving some fine lace on the glass. Aroma of roasted malt, and coffee. Real smooth mouthfeel, nice and creamy, with just the right amount of bitterness in the finish. I've not found many porters that I like and this is one of them."
"This is a really nice example of the robust porter style. Tons of roasty, chocolately coffee flavors, hedged against a well balanced dose of hops to keep everything in perspective. Finishes slightly tart to clean the palate. In general, I think the robust porter style is a tough one, because it is easy to wind up with a weak but over-hopped stout. Here, Bell's has hit upon a very nice balance."
"Poured a deep brown-ruby color with nice big creamy head,very appetizing smell of rich chocolate and deeply roasted malt.Taste was of dark roast coffee and bitter chocolate with some lingering earthiness.Very smooth and velvety and pretty easy to drink a real nice porter from my favorite brewer."
"Color is a dark opaque brown, nearly black, light but deep glowing brown highlights up to the light, a strong pour produced a thin, small tannish head of tight creamy foam, faded fast, some patchy lacing sticks every now and then. Smell is one complexing delicate nose of sourness of fruits, much like lemon-lime and oranges mixed but dulled and kinda dark, very calm, but I can definately detect a sour-like quality. Somewhat like super fresh sourdough bread yeast. I love it, whatever it is. That destinct Bell's quality. Aroma continues into some deeply roasted malts with cocoa hints and hop notes with a very slight coffeeish note as well. The taste is more complexing madness that starts mildly tangy, somewhat dullish fruit and hops, reminded me of mandorine oranges and of oriental salads with sesame, vinegar & soy sauces, but very good and not to sour at all. This is one pleasantly interesting porter. Flavors continue into some slight light and tangy smoothness of roasted malts, subtle in layers, and a really good mix of earthy tangy dryness thats a bit tingly and all in all very luscious and interestingly yummy. The more I drank it the more I absolutley fell in love with it. Feel is a smooth medium body with subtle layers of tangy dryness, damn nice. There seems to be more going on here then I can put a good finger on, but this will be a top pick to keep around at all times. My fridge is almost all Bell's now, its crazy I tell ya, crazy, send help."
"An interesting porter in its combination of tartness and roasted, chocolately flavors, but ultimately didn't seem to come together harmoniously."
"Faced with a choice between my favorite Edmund Fitzgerald and the Bell's Porter (which I had not tried) I, like every good B.A. took the road less traveled. Opaque dark brown with a nice tawny head. Smells of coffee, bitter chocolate and hops. Nice lace action as I drink it. Good serviceable Porter. Nice and dry on the finish. Light and surprisingly drinkable. Not at all disapointing but alas, short of the Great Lakes standard. I certainly wouldn't refuse a pint but next time I'll go for the Fitzgerald."
"This beer pours a very dark brown color with a nice creamy tan head that clings to the glass and leaves rings on the way down. The aroma of this beer immediately lets you know it is not your everyday porter. It has a strong roasted coffee smell to it. Initially the taste is a strong coffee flavor and finishes with a hoppy/chocolate flavor. After the first drink, I was blown away by this, and thought maybe it was too much coffee flavor for me; however, as I drank it, it kept tasting better and better. Saved a couple of bottles for the next day, and it tasted even better. Overall this is a strong flavored porter that just tastes better with every drink."
"Very dark brown, medium sized thick and tan head. Strong aromas of chocolate, coffee, a little hops as well. A very enjoyable mouthfeel, creamy and smooth with a perfect amount of carbonation. Strong flavors of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, and some hops on the finish. No sourness detected here, just a very kick ass porter."
"Having it on tap raises the mouthfeel and drinkability from 4.5 to 5.0, making it ""The Perfect Porter"". (Take that Bert Grant!). Exceptional in every way."
"Nearly black in color, with a full, dark tan head. Aroma is rich and roasty, toasty, even slightly burnt. Dark chocolate comes out on top, with hints of nuts and spices. Full-bodied, good texture, with loads of tingly hops. A fine rendition of the style."
"Drinkability: Pretty good. The sourness isn't all that welcome, but it's only a small part of the flavor profile. It's not as thick as most porters I like, but it's quite good. Combine that and the modest alcohol level, and you have a porter I could sip from all night...and it's even better on draft!"
"Deep brown in color with a light brown head. The aroma is sour with roast malt aromas, and chocolate notes. The flavor is a burnt roast malt, with chocolate and coffee flavors. The hop bitterness is present as well as bitterness from the roast grains. The finish is sweet and tart. The tartness I gather comes from the yeast used. Overall some good flavors and aromas, but the tartness kills this beer for me."
"Overall, an excellent beer and one which I will have again and again!"
"Dark murky brown in color, with a small off white-tan head, clingy sheets of lace in my glass, sour burnt chocolate aroma, coffee and chocolate flavor, with some sourness, medium body, very balanced, another awesome bells beer."
"At first I thought this was very good...I got a chocolate flavor right off the bat....seemed like I was drinking a milkshake...then that trademark Bell's yeast flavor emerged...I like it in some of their beers...In this one, I'm not real fond of it...It is black in color..nose is sourish like that yeast strain..the finish is also somewhat tart...Not an outstanding porter in my book...slightly above average."
"head of krausen but I don't know how long it will stay, as I always devoured it before I could find out!  The taste is relatively flat, in that no ingredient stands out above the others, A perfect balance in harmony.  It so inspired me, I am trying to clone this beer for My own understanding of what it takes to build THIS Beer."
"Great natural look but it smells like a sack of government grain that has been rained on for two or three seasons. The taste gives nice, clearly defined cocoa and coffee. Dry. An echo of metal and rotting grain on the palate. This was probably my first brand of Porter. The question is: Has KBC quality changed or have my tastes? Probably both. I can't imagine ever having been entranced by such mediocrity."
"This is a good porter, very dark brown/black, light tan head, Coffee/caremel flavors with a burnt/smokey malt flavor. If you are into elements of burnt malt this is the porter for you . Overall I'd recomend it, when I am in the mood for a hearty rustic beer I grab one of these."
"Thei beer poured almost black with little head.  A small, bubbly tan head.  Little lace.  Some carbonation.  Aroma of burnt malt, chocolate and coffee.  Flavor of burnt malt, coffee and chocolate.  A slight bitter finish to it.  Good beer and worth checking out."
"Damn, what a way for me to come off of my month of no brews.  The brew is black and pours with a huge tan head that never completely fades and leaves a nice lace on the glass.  Tons of roasted malts in the nose and some underlying coffee and chocolate.  The taste starts off chocolately sweet with some very nce malt.  As the taste lingers it turns into a nice coffee and roasted malt bitterness.  The bitterness stays on the tongue and leaves you craving the next sip.  Good slick mouthfeel and extremely drinkable.  After finishing this on I was left wishing I had a whole sixer in my fridge.  This is one excellent porter.  Everything this style should be and probably my favorite porter to date.  Thanks to Deuce for the sample."
"Deep chestnut hue with flashes of mirked ruby when held to light. Stiff, thick, creamy, and billowy tan head leaves dogged lace. Notes of carob, dark caramel and sharp coffee - like black patent malt in aroma, while the signature Bell's tart fruity yeast esters is quite prominent in aroma as well. Mellow diacetyl combines with chocolate malt to lend a buttery cocoa richness. Toffeeish sweetness upfront in flavor yields to notes of lightly burnt bread and butter. Residual sweetness becomes fructose in nature and date like mid palate, but is well tapered by a combination of roasted grain and hop bitterness. Trace yeast derived tartness and soft butterscotch emerge late, adding an agreeable pruneish fruit and buttery tinge which complements the stately cocoa presence. The body is moderate, and while carbonation is high, ample dextrins facilitate a nearly creamy mouthfeel. Finishes both gently tart softly roasted with fleeting notes of molasses and coffee liquor. A well balanced porter with well integrated roasted malt and ester character. Soft, almost breezy on the palate, and thus superbly drinkable."
"Bellâ€™s Porter: With a strong/malt aroma that you can smell as soon as it hits the glass.  Thick, dark color that you canâ€™t see through, even after its been held up to the sun.  The head is thick, creamy and very long lasting.  Wow, this is extraordinarily rich, with strong burnt malt flavor, and a long lingering aftertaste of coffee/espresso.  Not for the faint of heart."
"I've been drinkin this mash since the zoo brew started long ago..  This is a fine effort, a must try for porter lovers.  Black with the typical strong chocolate coffee flavor."
"This beer is dark ruby, almost black. It pours a pillowy cream light brown head that has some retention. There really nice chocolate and roast tones on the nose. Very nice bitterness in the taste coming from the roasted malt. There's a bittersweet chocolate taste making its presence known as well. Smooth and velvety mouthfeel. Medium body. A nice lingering bitterness. Very solid porter."
"I love this beer.  Dark, roasty, excellent malt presence with a nice hop finish.  Definetely a beer to drink during the cool weather.  Bell's does not make beer for those with sensitive taste buds."
"My favorite style of beer and Bell's is up to the challenge of one of the best bottled Porters I've ever had...toffee/coffee, with excellent mouthfeel...it can get chunky as its unpastuerized, but that's not at  all offputting to me....this brewery seems to be expanding its regional distribution, so eventually the world will expect great things from this outstanding regional..."
"Robust porter indeed. As stated in previous reviews, coffee and chocolate abound. Full, rich body and mouthfeel. One of several clear favorites from a Canadian brewfest this past summer (I'm finally getting around to reviewing some of them)."
