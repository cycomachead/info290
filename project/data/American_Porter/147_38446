3.98,2.6,4,4,4,3.75,4,"Enjoyed from a growler in a Rhinegeist snifter.  This unique porter pours a dark blackish brown with ruby highlights and a solid off white foam head that dissipates to a thin pool and light ring of foam leaving some fantastic lacing.  Nose of smoke, roasted malts, and rich vanilla.  Flavors are smoke and vanilla forward, with vanilla and smoke resting heavily on the back with a light bitter malts aftertaste.  Nice carbonation makes for an easy drinking experience, while the aftertaste reminds one that this is a unique take on a traditional porter.  Smoke is a bit lighter in this one than the standard smoked porter which is very nice.  For those who are not smoke fans this is a decent foray into the style.","Brutaltruth","Feb 28, 2015"

3.75,-3.4,4,4,3.5,4,3.75,"Poured a deep brown, almost black with a thin ring of tan head. A nice looking porter, true to form. Scents of smoked malt, roast malt, coffee with cream and vanilla, with the cream and vanilla predominating, but fairly balanced. Overall impression of aroma is of a nice porter, true to form, with the special ingredients discernible and complementing the aroma profile. Quite nice. Flavor begins with the typical porter flavor compliment, dark chocolate, coffee, roast malt, at medium levels, aided by a cream, vanilla and lightly smokey flavor. Middle opens up more bitterness, with a stronger roast malt character, black coffee with cream and vanilla, along with an increasing smoked malt presence, and bittersweet cocoa. Finish is dry with notes of smoked malt, smokey wood, bittersweet chocolate and black coffee, with a bit of vanilla. Aftertaste is roasted and smoked malt. Overall impression of flavor is of a bold, smokey porter, more intense than the base smoked porter, with enough vanilla flavor to add further depth. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium-high carbonation and a smooth initial feel that becomes drying. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a rather chalky porter, still within the style, and pleasant in its own way. Overall this is a fairly good beer. It has a nice aroma that highlights the special additions and a flavor that follows. Mouthfeel aids flavor and makes the beer quite easy to drink. Perhaps a bit too bold and lacking in subtlety, but it's Stone, so that is to be expected.","Auraan","Feb 28, 2015"

Dark brown, almost black in color, but takes on reddish/amber hues when held up to a light. The aroma is roasty and hints at vanilla beans, but mostly I sense chocolate and coffee flavors from the aroma and the taste. Well-balanced, pleasant and drinkable with a hint of dryness in the aftertaste.

This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think one glass is the perfect amount for me, but I don't think it would be a chore for me to drink the whole bottle.  What I like the most about this beer was the complexity, the vanilla added another layer to this beer which makes it not as one dimensional as the original version.  What I liked the least about this beer was that vanilla wasn't a little stronger, i think the base beer could hold up a stronger vanilla aspect.  I would buy this beer again when In the mood for the style and I would recommend it to anyone who likes smoked beers, I don't think the vanilla covers up any of the smokey aspects.  All in all I liked this beer, I'm still not a huge fan of Stone's Smoked Porter, but I thought the addition of vanilla beans worked well with this beer and it didn't take anything away from it, it just added to it a little.  It's not a favorite Stone beer, but it is my favorite beer from their Smoked Porter series and it falls at above average for the style.  Nice job guys this was a nice take on the Smoked Porter, keep up the hard work.","StoutHunter","Jan 31, 2015"

Make sure that you REALLY like these components (could I suggest a sampler) before diving into the whole snifter or bomber. Love Stone, Smoked Porter was not a big hit for me, and this wasn't either. However, you definitely get what you are asking for with this one. Maybe I am just not a big fan of the 'smoked' aspect. If you are, try this. I, for one, will be trying some of their other brews.","Mikus","Jan 13, 2015"

4.06,4.6,4,4.25,4,4,4," The flavor is really good with a lot more complexity than most beers of this strength with nice caramel in the malt with mild roasted and slight smoke with the vanilla adding a smooth and almost creamy accent to enhance the sweetness somewhat. I really like the way the vanilla works but I have a feeling the chipotle may be a little more to my taste since the smoke in the pepper could be complimentary to the base. I like the vanilla but it does seem to soften the smoke aspect I enjoy most in the original.","Slatetank","Oct 22, 2014"

Having not experienced this before, I can't speak on the changes it's undergone, a month and a half past their ""enjoy by"" date, but what I can tell from drinking this bottle is that I'll be keeping my eyes out for it when it's released again because the natural Madagascar vanilla bean additions are a wonderful compliment to the beer. I'm sure they're only much better fresh.","BeerFMAndy","May 19, 2014"

A mix of chocolate and roasted/smoked aromas (not that smoked) seem to be all I can smell as the vanilla barely registers/is muted. A pretty good smoked porter with roasted/smoked malts and some dark chocolate mingling around but the vanilla beans add themselves in the taste and as the beer warms it tends to get a more sweet vanilla taste. Basically, this is Stone's regular smoked porter with a touch of vanilla, not a vanilla smoked porter, but still a good addition and a really good beer.","clayrock81","Jan 28, 2014"

Any vanilla seems overwhelmed at first by the dominant smokiness, but later shows up clearly, especially in the aroma and aftertaste. Smooths out to inviting easy drinking once you get past the initial blast of smoke and bitterness. Would probably go well with a cigar. A good buy for $4.50 a bomber.","scotorum","Jan 24, 2014"

When held up to the light, the beer is a little bit transparent and can see through it. The beer smell has very strong vanilla notes that overpowers the other notes. Dark chocolate and bits of smoke. The beer taste has a much stronger smokier note than smell but complements the vanilla instead of competing. In essence, the flavor is kinda of liked smoked vanilla beans. The other notes in taste are the same as the smell. Dark chocolate, hints of mocha beans, and a light smoke but with a smokier aftertaste. Also, there are slight hints of caramel. The feel is medium bodied and smooth. This is definitely one of the smoother porters that I've had with very little carbonation. Overall, not a bad porter but the notes are off balance with the vanilla beans taking over.","HattedClassic","Jan 20, 2014"

The aroma is nice with hints of sweet chocolate, dark coffee, toffee, molasses, burnt malt,vanilla, and a nice hint of smoke. The taste is much smoker than the smell (which I pleasantly enjoy) with nice blend of dark and sweet chocolate, espresso, vanilla bean, and toffee finishing with a nice malty backbone mixed with some more smoke.

The smoke isn't overpowering and combines well with the other flavors in the nose for a very inviting beginning. Taste is rather mild. There is the roasted/smoked character right away, but not strong. The smoke is pleasant but dominates with hints of vanilla, semisweet chocolate, earth, and coffee rounding out the flavor. Carbonation seems bright. Mouthfeel is a bit light and watery.

Flavor starts with some light and sweet roast, light smoke that keeps some balanced bitter on hand, and then explodes with huge vanilla on the midpalate. Finally, a chocolate molasses & vanilla sweetness is left on the palate. Medium bodied--seems right on for a porter--with medium carbonation.

Flavors are smoked forward, with a bitter coffee introduction, followed quickly by rich and sweet creamy characteristics, chocolate notes, and a subtle bitterness underneath it all. Very well balanced, and sweet overall, like a sweet dessert cake. Smooth and light in mouth, with a roasted and slightly bitter blend to the creamy linger in the aftertaste.

Smell is of dark fruits, raisins in the background but pretty vanilla forward. Ironically I don't smell any smoke but I wouldn't be surprised if it came out in the taste. Taste is definitely a little more smoky as expected but not overpowering to be sure. Definitely some nice raisins, prunes, dark fruits, and quite a bit of glorious vanilla to go along with it. I'm very partial to vanilla beers and this doesn't disappoint but it is very well balanced and not really crazy vanilla. It is still vanilla forward but the smoke really tames it down to be sure. Taste is actually not as much vanilla as I expected. Mouthfeel is medium and is not too thick for the style. Could be thicker. Overall this is a great beer but I think I'll like it more once some of the smoke ages and the vanilla is more forward.","NeedBeerHere","Dec 23, 2013"

Tastes of vanilla beans, milk chocolate made from spoiled milk, light bitterness comes through towards the finish, the smokiness tranforms into a strange burnt grassiness in the background behind the sweets.

Pretty much tastes just like the regular smoked porter..a graham cracker flavor comes and goes quickly as well...really interesting..maybe a little bit more mellow due to the vanilla laced in there. tastes great, somewhat creamy and very smooth and drinkable just wish they emphasized the vanilla bean flavor in there more.taste kind of resembles one of those candy chocolate covered coffee beans!! Instead of struggling to taste it I want it to hit me right away and end with the smokiness. Due to the whole smokiness factor this makes for a great winter beer! All in all though this is a solid beer. Coffee lovers will especially dig this;cheers.","Glennlawless","Dec 10, 2013"

Huge billowing light tan head fine speckled lacing covers the sides of my glass very pleasant looking brew. Aromatics offer up a nutty/vanilla earthiness combined with dark chocolate/milk chocolate cocoa notes, the nose invites the notion of dessert or something very decadent about to reach the palate. Balanced flavor profile upfront vanilla bean character, with charred roasted malt and a mild smokey character offering up a nice bitterness to dry the palate out. In addition to the dark roasts, smoked malts, and vanilla beans this beer is packing around 50 or so IBUS. I get a nice herbal hop in the backend and it plays to how drinkable and well crafted this special winter release is, medium to light bodied nice textures a bit more residual sugars or caramelization on the palate but still finishes clean and dry ample moderate carbonation carries the flavor profile very well. Overall a go to beer, if your lucky enough to have Stone in your distribution network where you live, give this a try this winter.","WVbeergeek","Dec 09, 2013"

Not much of an alcohol presence. Lots of carbonation. Drinkable with the vanilla flavor not being too overpowering. More of the smoke comes out at the finish.

Taste is initially vanilla forward. A TON of vanilla. Not nearly as smokey as the original smoke porter. Very faint smoke with a well balanced, sweet, dark chocolate edge. Somewhat bitter finish.

4.07,4.9,3.5,3.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Stone Smoked Porter with Vanilla Bean pours out a deep brown color with a tiny off-white head. The aroma is a little awkward, with the vanilla never quite properly integrating with the smoked malts. The taste is much more balanced than I expected, with an excellent vanilla flavor mingling with the solid smoke and roast flavors of the original. The late aftertaste is where this beer really diverges from the original, with the vanilla lingering on the palate long after the smoke and roast have given up the ghost. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and fairly coating, and the drinkability is exceptional. Overall, the Vanilla Bean treatment on Stone's Smoked Porter is another success. It's not as perfectly complementary as the Chipotle version, but it's still worthy.","shand","Jan 20, 2013"

I gotta say, even though it's recommended fresh, it's good to sit on this a couple of months. Initially the flavors don't blend all that well together, now it's much nicer.

It does seem to smooth out the taste of the Smoked Porter, but I do feel like more vanilla would be nice. It's not terribly different from the original, though I'd like to think on tap it would be creamier and the vanilla would be stronger. I will definitely give it another go then. As a bottle purchase, to pay the same for a 12oz. of this as a bomber of the regular, I'd probably just go with the regular, because this just isn't worth the extra cost.

Almost two fingers of khaki colored foam crown the beer, before fading slowly. The head proves to be fairly sticky too, leaving lots of lacing behind. The nose has a bit each of dark chocolate and smoke. The predominant aroma though is of vanilla. I wish it was just a little bit less overpowering. Similarly, the flavor profile leads off with a nice interplay between dry, roasty, dark chocolate and a light smoke character. Straight vanilla then comes in for the back end and the finish. As much as I like vanilla, it works much better when it's supporting and contrasting with other flavors. Here the vanilla is just on its own, and it comes across as a bit cloying as it lingers on my palate. The body is on the dry side for a porter, but it works just fine. The carbonation comes off as just a little bit low though. My recollection of having prior (draft only) batch of vanilla bean aged smoked porter is of a better beer than the one in my glass tonight. I like the composite parts, but the vanilla just is not well integrated into the final product.","axeman9182","Sep 20, 2012"

Both times they were consistent and had much more vanilla flavor. On tap it resembled a milk stout from the vanilla perspective, but it still had a solid porter flavor profile underneath. This is very similar, but I feel that the vanilla is just not as present, and it takes away from the overall experience. I want more vanilla damnit! Protip: A good sloshing in the mouth really brings out the creaminess and aromatics. Much more pleasurable this way, though the bitterness is still a little too harsh for this sweet-leaning beer. This makes me want to try the chipotle version since this iteration didn't meet my expectations.","Philousa","Sep 12, 2012"

Pours sightly darker than cola in color and clarity with a loose, half inch, beige-colored head that quickly looses half its volume in a matter of seconds, yielding to ringlets and then finally to a soapy skim that coalesces around the shoulders. Some spots and thin strands of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose asserts a strong vanilla bean presence off the bat, albeit somewhat artificial in character, followed by a roasty/chalky cocoa quality. Taste consistent with nose; however, impressions of smoked meat are also expressed in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light and feels a tad thin with a slightly coarse, almost gassy carbonation level. I really enjoy the standard smoked porter and the vanilla definitely imparts an interesting dimension to this beer; however, it falls a part a little in the mouthfeel for me. Perhaps a little more body and a little less carbonation would improve the overall character.","Jwale73","Sep 03, 2012"

Decent head and produces some lacing on a clean glass. Smell to be expected is chocolate and vanilla. The vanilla almost eliminates the smokiness of this porter and is an interesting but good change of pace from the standard porter. Good for a summer time porter.","Oakenator","Aug 04, 2012"

Aroma of roasted malt and coffee with a hint of vanilla. Flavor starts with nuts and roasted malt, then light smoke and hops finishing nutty and roasted. Leaves a pleasant lingering slightly smokey vanilla and roasted malt aftertaste. Medium bodied. The smoke flavor is rather subdued in this porter compared to others I've tried, but is compensated by the complexity of flavors and a unique flavor progression.","LiquidAmber","Jul 03, 2012"

The vanilla hits my tongue almost immediately and then is joined by a hint of dark espresso and roasted malt, all swirl together for a balanced finish that has just a bit of bitterness with the vanilla lingering immediately however the smoke outlasts the vanilla.

About 2 fingers of off white head. Sticky sticky lacing and pretty nice head retention. Vanilla blast up the nose plus coffee. Almost like an iced vanilla latte. LOVE. A little sweet milk chocolate. Bright bitter coffee flavor up front, a little vanilla in the middle. Not nearly as much as on the nose. A surprising amount of burnt bitterness on the finish. Very drying, with very small prickly bubbles. Great beer.","WestValleyIPA","May 23, 2011"

4,3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"D - I think this is a wonderfully balanced sweet porter. The vanilla bean is very noticeable and enjoyable with the smokey and chocolate notes.","stawn","Nov 13, 2008"
4.15,7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"I was happy to see this on the cask at the new, glorious Blue Palms Brewhouse in Hollywood. The barkeep did a fantastic job to make sure this was served properly. Dark as night with a fluffy cumulous cloud head - this looked fantastic. The first few sniffs were all vanilla bean. After warming the ole nose up to that I got some of the roasted chestnut malts through. Brings about a dessert drink - like someone dipped a scoop of vanilla into my porter. I mean that in the best way.","sloejams","Aug 19, 2008"
3.6,-7.2,4,4,3.5,4,3,"Drinkability: Pretty heavy, then again I was a bit hungover. Will try again if I ever venture back down to Escondido. Pretty good, but not great.","ThreeWiseMen","Aug 18, 2008"
4.02,3.6,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,"Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin. The vanilla is gigantic in the aroma and the flavor. I'll be frank, it's obliteratingly gigantic. Is this a negative? Not really. Though, if you don't like vanilla, I could see why folks would find it offputting.","Overlord","Aug 18, 2008"
3.46,-10.8,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Tastes of coffee and roasted malts, but nothing in the smoked department. The vanilla, be it on the nose or the tongue, is once again a bit overwhelming here. I've tried this brew on cask once in the past and I don't remember it being so overpowering. Nonetheless, an enjoyable and easy drinking beverage, assumably weighing in at the typical 5.90% of Stone's standard offering.","HalfFull","Aug 15, 2008"

3.51,-9.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3,"Not terribly drinkable, as the flavor is so strong of vanilla. Everyone at the table did finish theirs, but without enthusiasm. Maybe a bit less vanilla bean in the recipe would yield a more balanced, drinkable brew.","charlzm","Jun 07, 2008"
4.57,17.8,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability - Very easy drinking and refreshing. I could drink this beer all night long thanks to the flavor and the lower ABV.","Cromster","Apr 03, 2008"
2.79,-28.1,4,2.5,2.5,3.5,3,"Not recommended. About the only beer I've sent back at Beachwood (and hey, I said I would pay for it regardless!). Sure, give it a taste - just don't order a pint of it!","rallison","Mar 07, 2008"
4,3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall, I think that its an alright porter but the vanilla really gave it something nice. I guess that should tell you something: that someone who doesn't drink a lot of porters enjoys this beer. I guess that either makes it a really good beer or a watered down version that everyone can enjoy. Judge for yourself.","t0rin0","Jan 29, 2008"
3.86,-0.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D: A good beer overall by Stone, I didn't like it as much as the other 2 variations that I have had, but it's a solid porter beer. Another good beer from Stone.","Halcyondays","Dec 09, 2007"
4.3,10.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"It's not going to replace Otter Creek's Stovepipe Porter in my fridge, mostly due to availability issues, but this is by far worth it if you can find it.","Omniscia","Oct 05, 2007"

4.23,9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a deep brownish red on close examination, dark brown if looked at from afar. Head is off white and frothy with pretty good retention. Leaves ok lacing. The smell has a a good amount of chocolate malt in it, as well as vanilla. The taste has more sweetness compared to the regular smoked porter, not only by the vanilla character but also from chocolate malt and caramel flavor. Still, the vanilla gives a real nice tweek that comes through not too strong but enough to transform the beer into something a little different. I like the mouthfeel, it's not too thick and gives it a real drinkable character over other richly flavored beers. The carbonation level in this is real fine and not course or abrasive. This was a growler that had been kept in the fridge for 4 days so I don't know if that enabled it to mellow or not.","MiScusi","Aug 30, 2007"
