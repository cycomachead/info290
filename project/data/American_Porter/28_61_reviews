"Extremely smooth porter. Completely black and opaque with a beautiful creamy head. Subtle sweet fragrance of chocolate and coffee. Flavor is round and full with an alcohol finish balanced with a bit of sweetness."
"What I expected porter to taste like. Delicious."
""
"I am embarrassed to say I had never heard of this beer before and grabbed it only to round out an assembled six pack.  But, wow, what a nice surprise!  I really enjoyed it and find myself agreeing with the BA Score - Outstanding!  The rich flavor was so well balanced, it was gone before I knew it."

"Such a great beer. blask smooth"
"O - Must try porter, even if you don't like dark beers. Really rich flavor, just cook up a steak and you're good to go"

"Bottle.  52d.  Smell is malt with a little caramel-like aroma.  Taste is on the clean and lighter side.  Some slight bitterness that is well balanced.  Overall a very versatile porter and very drinkable under many conditions.  I liked it a lot and this would be a solid choice if Black Butte was unavailable."
""
""
""
""
"A very gentle but pleasantly flavored porter. The aroma was bready and caramel-like at first, but it took on more of a buttery character shortly thereafter. It judiciously covers all the bases, resulting in a balanced, palate-friendly brew."
""
""
""
"Overall: If this was the same recipe in 1974....this is all I would've drank (Ballantine included). This is a complex little brew and would have me coming back for more. There's nothing to complain about this Porter, it's easy drinking, Roasty and damn enjoyable! This brew is Recommended!"

"Smell cant pinpoint but slight bread hint carmel taste hatd to discribe but slight bread and not sur what else feel has slight tingle on tongue great porter on cold ass day that started out -12 below"
"-a good porter taste like a porter should but nothing stands out to me, hoped for more flavor"
""
""
"Pitch black with a nice foam head.  Banana nut bread, black cherry on the nose.  The taste is bitter black coffee and toasted grains.  A touch of sweetness and dark fruit are there, but mostly a very straightforward brew.  It's tasty, strong, and smooth.  This one will get me venturing into the world of porters a bit."
""
""
""
""
"Maybe an old bottle but this had virtually zero carbonation and no head. Aroma and flavor are just about what I would expect in a porter."
""
""
"One of my favorite porters, hands down. It's easy to find which is a HUGE plus."
""
"Overal, a very solid Porter.  If a traditional Porter is a no nonsense workingman's beer, this is a good fit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Very well balanced and packing lots of flavour this beer paired very well with Dutch pancakes with loads of cheese. If this beer is a hallmark of Anchor's brewing then I have high hopes for the steam beer and barley wine!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O;  Great beer."
""
"Best porter I've had so far. I was ready to give up on porter until I tried this one. Nice and simple, clean, well made. No bells and whistles, just a great tasting example of the style. Well balanced, will buy again when I see it. Allowed to warm to near room temp before drinking."
"Not a bad porter. I like it, it's just not my favorite, but still great quality. I would not pass this one up"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty damn good good bro!"
""

"Great porter. Crisp. Clean. Hint of chocolates with a cola feel. Highly Carbonated but not fizzy. Good beer"

"The first beer I fell in love with.  The owner of the bar near where I used to work ordered me a case every month because he knew I would come in and drink it."
""
""
""
""
"Its sophisticated and very drinkable!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Enjoyed this guy while working on a table.  My wife enjoys poters so I only got to drink half of it :( It was a nice smooth feel with a decent aftertaste that lingered for a while. Very happy with it."
"Wonderfully complex, balancing roasted maltiness, mild hops, acidity and a particular floral character that I believe is related to the yeast, as with the Anchor Liberty Ale. A desert island brew (assuming that island has winters)."

"Color is black with a creamy beige head. Nice body to this beer with a bit of a creamy mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Aromas of chocolate malts and roasty coffee/espresso. All of that very much carries through to the palate with a subtle hop bitterness and a clean finish. It looks like a big beer but drinks closer to a session beer. Great flavor and an all around great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"o: i wish there was a bigger roasty character here, and the floral/mildly fruity hop presence could be toned down a few notches.  still a tasty, well-rounded, and sessionable beer.  improves quite a bit as it warms, so make sure you do that"
"Great porter, very well rounded."

"This pours a dark brown color with a foamy, light brown head. The aroma is mild with caramel malts and sweet malts. The flavor is big and bold for a porter with a thinner texture that finishes slightly chalky. Really well made for a porter style brew. A must try for any porter lover!"

"This is one of my favorite porters.  Always pours with a thick tan head that lingers all the way down the glass.  The roasted coffee and dark chocolate flavors are very abundant with each sip, but it is not overly sweet and off putting like many porters on the market."
""
""
"This may be my favorite Porter of all-time. Poured from a single bottle into an ale glass.  A beautiful, foamy, caramel head immediately billowed-up and laced all the way down the glass as I imbibed.  Silky smooth on the mouthfeel and not a trace of bitterness from initial mouth contact to swallow to aftertaste.  This one truly lives up to 'The Bros' rating of 99."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  This is an outstanding porter!  Great, bready, sweet flavors of roasted malt and brown sugar!  Recommended!"

"Really dark. Lots of flavor. Has a roasted malt flavor, but is also sour and tastes like alcohol. Kind of reminds me of a barley wine."

"O: I've heard this beer roll off the tongues of many a craft drinker, oft times with great praise following. Embarrassingly, it has taken me this long to try it—and for that, I'm kicking myself in the ass. It's so easily accessible here that I've often overlooked it, but now that I've finally grabbed it, I'm in love. It's everything I look for in a porter. Huge, rich flavors, with a solid mouthfeel and sessionable qualities. Sorry, Guinness, but I think I've found my new black beauty."

"Anchor porter presents a deep opaque black with a strong foamy tan head that leaves excellent lacing in its absence. In the nose anchor porter produces a fantastic balance between sweet and malt while retaining the nutty richness expected in a porter. On the tongue this porter matches it's nose by creating a balanced sweet nutty malt that finishes with a fantastic bitter flavor on the tongue. In the mouth the presence of strong carbonation dominates leaving a smooth refreshing finishes that lingers with the delightful tickle of carbonation. Overall Anchor has delivered a top of the line Porter that masters appearance balance and mouthful. It is definitely in contention for my top Porter."

"First impression is that this is a chocolate forward porter, and very light on the coffee. Taste and smell are big on the milk chocolate and some caramel. Very little roasted malt present. Overall this is a creamy, chocolate porter that is smooth and easy drinking. Im not big on porters usually, but this is definitely one betters ones out there. (87/100)"

"The last time I had this beer, I thought it was top-notch. Now I'm finding it mediocre. Weird. Thin, sort of flat, and lacking depth in the flavor."
""

""
""
""
""

"Overall: This is solid. I didn't expect much, but was delighted by the complex taste. This is a sipper, one per evening should satisfy. Well done."

"O: I was surprised by this one. I expected roasty malts, chocolate and coffee - but mainly hit sweet notes. I was confused by the smell and the taste. Not bad but just seemed out of character."

"O - I like porters, but this is not my favourite represenative; for me the cleaning product and pinot noir aromas and flavours didn't gel naturally with the other flavours which are more common for the style."
""
"O- A solid brew. In my opinion it feels like a brown ale/porter hybrid. There are better porters but a have to say I like it. Its got an advantage in the drinkability aspect for sure but, does it? I like the creamy texture of a ""typical"" porter. I don't know, loses character points but gains for originality. I'm confused. I think I need another beer. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
"O: An awesome porter. Anchor isn't over doing anything in this beer, and they are certainly not under doing it either. It's a very pleasant porter and I highly recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"the head was approx.3"" after pouring.very nice color,very dark and nearly opaque.it had an aroma of honey,a little brown sugar am coffee.it had a medium to full body,somewhat lighter than the founders porter.drank it at approx. 45 degrees.the taste was exactly as the aroma,very well integrated.as it warmed up ,it took a noticeably heavier note,but very smooth.highly recommend."

"Overall: a very good porter. It doesn't top Founder's Porter or Great Lakes Edmond Fitzgerald to me, but otherwise, it's about as good as they come. Very true to the style and I would certainly drink it again"
""
""
"From the bottle it pours a deep red that nears black with a thick tan head. Mild roasted smell, but disappointingly mild. Very light feeling with fine carbonation. Roasted grains, a bit of coffee, and a hint of chocolate with a good malt/hop balance. Finishes dry and very clean."
""
""
""
"O> A porter that is highly drinkable while also being incredibly interesting and complex. Truly a benchmark for the style."

""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's a measuring stick for American porters. Hits all the right notes. If Anchor's iconic beer wasn't Anchor Steam, it would be this."
"Overall: This porter got better as time went on. More things were noticeable as it warmed up. I can see myself enjoying more of these in the future."

"O - Overall a decent enough Porter but the ABV a little on the high side for a session beer. I'm a little surprised by the super high ratings since while this is a very good beer, personally I don't think it rises to great."
"O) Excellent example of classic English Porter. As mentioned, I cannot discern the difference between stronger porters and stouts. Never the less I like them both."

"Poured into a pint glass with a nice full head developing, tan in color with good retention and lacing. Appearance was a dark brown to almost black. Aroma had strong notes of coffee and malt with some fruity and bread notes. Taste was sweet and malty with notes of bread, chocolate and coffee, with a hint of dried fruit. Mouthfeel was medium with a mild and dry aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of the most refreshing Porters I've ever had. It is very well balanced, and the flavors play really well together. I'm curious to learn if Steam and this beer share common ingredients and/or how similar the brewing techniques are between the two. You can definitely tell they come from the same source. I will surely be having this again."
"Overall: A really, really great porter from w brewery that doesn't get the credit it deserves. A delicious mix of nutty, fruity, and roasty characters that drinks malty but not mouth coatingly-so. Highly recommended."

""
""
""
""
""

""

"One of the best examples of this classic British style to come from the U.S. A really fine, silky-smooth porter."
""
"Most flavorful porter I've ever tasted."
"O - a classic porter for sure. Being a big porter fan I find this to be just as good as two of my favorites Smuttynose Robust Porter and Founders Porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D - Solid porter. Nice fruitiness and easy to drink. A nice solid porter that is deserved of it's stature."

"I seldom find this beer in Colorado Springs, so this is the one west coast beer I picked up while otherwise loading up on some New England regional beers. I'm very glad I did, because this palate pleaser brought back memories of this classic beer that I haven't enjoyed in five or more years. Rich and satisfying throughout, complexity and depth galore, this is one “meaty” yet very drinkable dark ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - not as sweet as many porters I've tasted, but enjoyed the sour and peppery flavor"
""
"O: This is probably the best robust (hoppy) porter I've had. Everything's in good balance, yet the flavors stand out quite well. I could see this becoming a go-to porter."
"Well done."
"Overall – A rather tasty and slightly higher hopped porter. A nice take on a porter."

"I Just Cannot see anyone not liking this Porter, everything happening about this beer is just done right, silky, Rasiny sweet perfectly balanced bitterness beautiful head on the pour, this is one of my weekly ""Staple"" brews I cannot go a week without it!"
""
""
"Classic beer. This is an improved porter, more complex, flavorful, and hoppy but still smooth. Highly recommended."
"Definitely an unexpected beer, looks like a porter but the elements of fruit definitely is enough to make it not a porter in my opinion. Depending on your tastes, you might like the change."
""
""
""
"The flavor is thick and full with deep chocolatey undertones. Dried fruit sweetness, prunes and cherry, cover the malt flavors. The flavors are hefty and alive and make this a superior Porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours deep dark brown, almost black, with four or five fingers of durable coffee colored head. Aroma is dark fruity malts, more malts, and maybe a whiff of floral and earthy hops. Nice sweet malt complexity in the aroma, and the taste doesn't disappoint. Raisins, dates, cherries, some milk chocolate, coffee, and cola flavors but the dark fruits carry the day. The mouthfeel is silky smooth and a bit chewy, some hop bitterness on the finish but this beer is a vehicle for fruity malts, with the hops just keeping things from becoming too syrupy. Nice example of a ""robust porter"" from the BJCP style guidelines, almost approaches a sweet stout in flavor if not in body. A touch of bitter grain lingers on the palate. This could be my favorite Anchor beer. Its quite consistent from batch to batch, maybe the hops are more pronounced on rare occasions. Malt complexity along a sweet vein (check out Brekel's Brown for a different take on malty complexity)."

"Overall a pretty easy drinking flavorful beer. This is one you could drink a few of."

"355ml bottle bb42014 ap: dark brown, immense head with large and small bubbles. sm: faint treacle/molasses. ta: molasses and herbal. mo: medium, lingering treacle and molasses. ov: pleasant 'soft' dark beer with sugary taste. Quite different to other porters."
""
"This beer is a fine example of complexity achieved mainly through the malt, with hops as a side dish rather than the main course. The beer is also very affordable, at about 4.50 a bomber in my town."

"O: For my first Porter, I've chosen one that's considered one of the best. It's said that its mouthfeel and inner-mouth behavior is complex but I find it incredibly simple. Minimalisticly simple. For sure, one of the best beers I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
"The taste has a pleasant sweetness at the beginning and then there is this wonderful bitterness that bounces forward from left field. It ends rather dry. What a nice Porter."

"Poured into a pint glass, the body is a nice dark brown/amber color and is topped off with a nice thick tan head, which is creamy and very bubbly. The head lasts for quite some time and is rounded up by a thick wall of lacing. Light roasted malts and coffee come through, mild fruits and banana bread aromas are mixed in as well. It has a medium-to-light mouth feel(leaning more towards medium) and is sharp at first, light and crisp. It envelopes your mouth with a thin layer of creamy malts, the hops are hidden and the fruits flavors come out as it hits the sides of your mouth. The aftertaste is a bit earthy and semi dry, over all this is a pretty good porter and it goes down well too. It does get slightly bitter as you swallow but its nothing overwhelming."
"O- This was quite a surprising and maybe confusing beer to me. I mean it was very much a classic porter but it had that unusual lighter feel and it was like two different beers in aroma vs taste. Overall i can still say i enjoyed it: decently complex, nicely drinkable and all"

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 11/26/2012. Pours nearly opaque dark brown color with a nice 2 finger dense and fluffy tan head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, chocolate, molasses, dark bread, raisin, light roast, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark bready malt and light roasted notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, molasses, chocolate, toffee, dark bread, floral, light roast, raisin, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, chocolate, molasses, dark bread, light roast, raisin, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Awesome balance and complexity of dark and bready malt flavors; with good roast/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent porter! All around great balance and complexity of bready and dark malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Not much more to say -- I think this is a classic, and I especially appreciate the essential lightness of body here. I'm aware that the dividing line between Porters and Stouts is often problematic, but I don't think I've ever had any problems firmly placing this in the Porter camp. Highly recommended."

"Poured from short fat 12oz bottle; dark oily brown pour, black in the glass showing a little dark brown in light with a thick fluffy brown head that leaves lots of big lacing. Smells incredible; like no other porter I've had. Vanilla, chocolate, bourbon, raisins, oh lord this smells good. Smell rivals BCS. Taste is as complex as the smell; dark fruit, slight bourbon (that ""old banana"" flavor), coffee/bitter chocolate roasted malt and loads of sweetness. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. This is the standard by which I will measure every porter I have from this point on."

"This is currently my favorite beer. I use to drink Guinness for my dark beer pleasure but this has such a nicer taste. Guinness is more milder than Anchor porter. Sierra Nevada porter has more of a bite and isn't as smooth as Anchor. It has a dark robust flavor and bitterness. A great beer for anyone who enjoys the darker malt side."

"Anchor Porter is far and away the best porter I've had. The complex layers of flavors that follow a wonderful pour and smell make this the absolute go-to porter. I love many different porters but if this brew is available any other porter should take a back seat. If you don't like this porter then you must not like the style because this is what all porters dream of becoming."
"Drank great from a conical pint glass. I'd recommend a nonic if available. That or a dimpled mug."
""
""
""
"Overall a great beer. I enjoyed the first one by itself and the second with a chocolate/peanut butter/ wafer dessert. This paired very well with with the peanut butter. Take a bite of dessert and then a sip of the porter and WOW. This is a great beer. Great by itself and great with chocolate/peanut butter desserts."

"This is a very solid porter. It's been awhile since I've had it and I'm glad I revisited it. It falls short of some other porters out there, but the craftsmanship is solid here."

"Poured this 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This american style porter poured a dark brown almost black color, produce a tan head, creamy, nice retention and left a nice amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of dark malted grain, molasses and prunes. A foundation of dark roasted malted grain, chocolate, prunes, molasses and a citric herbal hop finish. Dry finish. Overall, one of the best porters i have sampled- outstanding!"

"The Anchor Porter is GOOD! The beer pours a dark opaque with nice tan head that is lacing. The smell is not as strong as other porters, there is subtle hints of malt and earth which are pleasent. The taste is a very smooth and well balanced porter that has a clean finish. Beer starts with a sweet caramelly malt that slowly turns in slightly bitter. The mouthfeel is medium body with smooth carbonation. Overall it is one fine porter."
""
"Overall: This is one of my favorite porters. Smooth and crisp but still a strong flavor to it. Very easy drinking due to its low ABV but there is enough going on in the beer to make me want to come back for more. Something I can sip on year round and enjoy in any climate, but particularly on a cold winter night."

"Nice pitch black color with a 2.5 finger head with tons of lacing. Light toasted aroma with some toffee and dark fruit esters. The taste is much of the same with more fruitiness than toasted maltiness and a moderately dry finish. A lighter body, the way an English porter would be. Very tasty porter, anchor brews great beer and this one is great as well."

"Anchor Porter: I was looking for a new Porter to try, and the Anchor Porter came up as highly rated. I was able to get a 6-pack for $10, which is reasonable these days. Black as pitch with a tan head settled on top. Not much in the aroma department. This beer starts out smooth, then an abundance of flavor hits the palate: anise, molasses, burnt sugar and almost any brown sweet thing you can think of. It was too much. I was hoping for a Porter that would be more easy drinking than statement in your face beer. Worth a try, but the ODell Cutthroat Porter is still standing as my favorite Porter."

"This beer reminds me of Guinness Extra Stout and several other Irish stouts, but its got slightly more flavor. Infusion of wine-like aromas with heavy roasted malts make for an interesting drink. Lots of flavor at only 5.6% ABV."

"This poured a dark ruby amber with coca colored foam. It has a light roast aroma and a mild tartness which comes across faintly as you smell it but develops further as it warms. There’s a light chocolate roast flavor with a mild hop bite. It’s sweeter than I remember but then again my tastes have changed over the years."
""
"O - I just had a Founders Porter before this one, and I never thought there would be such a difference. Anchor's take on a porter is a bit more unique than what I've had before, but I like it a lot. To me it reminds me a lot like a lighter Guinness, not necessarily in taste but being more old fashion. I'm a little confused as to how I feel about this, but my general opinion is it is good in all aspects."
"An amazing porter from Anchor Brewing."

"Truly one of the best beers in America. This one is available all year round pretty much everywhere so there is very little reason you shouldn't try it. This beer if smooth and sweet without being cloyingly so. I attribute this to the addition of black malt which provides the ashy and acidic flavor. This beer is also nicely hopped, like a good American porter you can taste them (northern brewer hops in this case) through the malt. Upon closer inspection I find no red highlights that commonly accompany many dark beers (through the use of roasted un-malted barley)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not the porter that I was expecting, but pleasantly different. I prefer the more coffee-chocolate styles, but this is definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"O - Staple Porter. People tout this as a solid, no frills porter that goes down as a microbrew classic. Some would deem this as insipid, but they'd be wrong. Congrats on a solid recipe, Anchor. What a great representative for the porter kin."

"Overall this one is a highly recommended standby for a stout. Rich and complex without being overly filling or too unbalanced in any one aspect of flavor, smell, or body."
""
"Overall this is definitely a very drinkable, above average American Porter. The fruity flavors dominate which I enjoy because the overly roasted and bitter ones are overdone nowadays. A classic for sure IMO, not reinventing the wheel here just a solid beer."

"O: Average American porter here. No frills."
"This beer poured with a one finger tan head that lingered, leaving significant lacing on the glass. The body was a very dark brown color with moderate visible carbonation. The nose had definite notes of roasted malts with hints of smoke, coffee and mild chocolate. The taste had a lot of the coffee that was apparent in the nose. There were also some notes of chocolate and vanilla. This was a really well-balanced beer. The bitterness and malt really worked in concert with each other. The carbonation was moderate and really went well with the flavors in the brew. The body was perfect as well, it wasn’t too thick or thin. The finish was pretty quick with the same coffee flavor. This was definitely an awesome brew, especially for a cold night. I would definitely have this one again."
""
""
"Overall: The smell and appearance are really nice, and it is easy to drink. However, the flavor falls short. It tastes really good, but it quickly leaves the palate leaving behind only a shadow of its flavors."
"Overall: Anchor Porter is often hailed as one of the best of its kind, and with good reason: it's a solid glass of porter every time. Rich and satisfying, with chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt -- just what you'd expect, and then some!"
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: I had this one a while back, so this isn't my best review, but I remember I enjoyed this quite a bit."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a glass mug. Pours dark chocolate brown (almost black) with a thick, creamy dark tan head. The head dissipates slowly, leaving some sticky lacing on the side of the glass. The taste strongly follows the nose. There are plenty of dark roasted malts along with those flavors of chocolate and coffee. It also tastes a little sweet up front with some back end bitterness. These flavors are very well balanced. The body is light to medium with low carbonation. The finish is creamy and slightly clean. The drinkability is very high. This is an excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I enjoyed this thickish yet smooth porter from a footed pilsner glass while eating a BBQ sampler of baby back and spare ribs. It was delicious. The beer has a creamy texture that goes down smooth. The flavor is reminiscent of coffee or cocoa, and it lingers for quite a while. I think this is a great beer to have with a meal, but I certainly wouldn't drink more than two glasses in one sitting."
"Very nice!"

""
""
""
""
"O: had a Fuller's London Porter a couple of days ago, and it was amazing - this is like the american equivalent - right up there with Founders' porter. A must have."
""
""
"I understand that this is a standard, but it's missing some depth and deeper flavors. A very solid intro, and had I not tried some other pinnacles in the style, this might have blown my mind."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: This must be my favorite porter i've had so far. I love the easy going mellowness of this one without getting too thin, milky of watery. Usually porters are all about coffee and chocolate bitterness, but i love the sweet rye base flavor of this one together with the more subtle usual porter flavors. It gives more body and balance to it then any other porter i've had (quite a lot). So for me this one is the benchmark right now :) Highly recommended!"

"355ml bottle. ½ Pint glass. Single brewer tasting session on agt´12. (Enjoyed many times in the past). Pure black, very dark brown to the light. Light brown froth creates a creamy & lasting crown. Roasted malt, caramel malt, toffee & ripe dark fruit aromas with coffee hues. Black malts at firs sip followed by bitter cocoa & dried dark fruits. Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Hops in the middle & astringent roasted malts provide a dry finish. Burnt candies in the aftertaste. Flavorful & delightful."
""
""
"This one is unlike any porter you will ever try. The coffee and chocolate portions we've come to expect are all there, but this one feels so much creamier and tastes a little bit fruitier or something. Much like the brewery's flagship beer, this one is hard to compare anything to. It's so smooth and so unique - a must for all beer lovers!"

"Review from 3/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark brown with deep red highlights when held to light, nice tan head and thick lacing. Aroma of roasted malt and light coffee and chocolate. Medium mouth feel, roasted malts, dark fruit and light caramel, but all fairly subtle. Finish is slightly bitter, but smooth. A really well balanced, decent low abv porter. A slight metallic flavor on the finish, otherwise well done"
""
"Considering the rich history of Anchor Brewing, I anticipated that this would be a more typical American Porter. Instead, this is quite weird. It's got a lot of sweetness, and a lot of dark fruits. Too sweet for what I'm looking for in a porter, but I'm glad I tried this."

"Overall, I may have found a competitor to Founders Porter. Both have very different tastes to them, and both are very complex. Again I love this beer!"
"O: This beer is the nearly perfect blend of a mild, yet strong and complex porter. Everything I could ask for out of a porter, and decently priced!"

"D - With this review Anchor has become one of my favorite breweries. Everything I've tried from them has been top notch, and this was no exception. Their beers tend to have a really balanced and developed character that I figure can only come from years and years of fine tuning. Because of this all their brews just feel exceptionally drinkable and this porter is exactly that, I could drink this stuff all day. I typically find porters to be a little underwhelming as well, and usually leave me wishing I'd opted for a more robust stout, but not with this one. Great beer."
""

"Overall - Is this a porter? It tastes more like an Extra Special Bitter; more akin to Hobgoblin and Old Thumper than Black Butte and Pipeline Porter. Had they labeled this an ESB, a better overall score would definitely be warranted. It's a damn impressive beer, but as a porter? It's a touch off."
"O: A damned good beer. I'm going to have to get an Edmund and another bottle of this and do a side-by-side. I honestly think this might be my favorite porter to date."
"D: this is a great drinking porter. just enough bitterness and sweetness to have a presence, but still super easy drinking beer. like i stated above, both the roast and sweet factor work great with each other and deliver just enough of each."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I drank about 1/4 of the bottle and poured the rest down the drain. It's drinkable, but I was in the mood for something better."
""

"I'm not a big porter type of guy, but man, this is darn tasty and rivals Black Butte for me."
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark brown with an ample, frothy tan head. Lacing clings to glass in large swaths. Mild aroma is a mix of chocolate, caramel, and floral hops. Flavor is a mellow blend of the above, with bitter chocolate really coming through in the finish. The taste of roasted malt lingers stickily on the lips. I'm also noticing a metallic flavor that I don't recall the last time I had this. A bit of warming up may be in order reveal the full flavor profile. Warming does indeed reveal some dark fruit and alcoholic warmth. On the whole, this is a very drinkable, balanced porter with a delicious finish to boot. A quality offering from Anchor."
"Pours black with a 2 thumbs width mocha head. Good lacing A fantastic aroma; very unaggressive but very distinct. Some roasted barley, chocolate, dark fruit, and sugar. One of the best smelling porters I have so far come across. A sweet and rich flavor that aroma totally hinted was coming. Chocolate and caramel, some dark fruit, creamy, with a great roasted finish. A nice creamy medium bodied mouthfeel to this. Move over Black Butte Porter, there's a new porter in town! Shouldn't have slept on this one for as long as I have, this is a wonderful beer and perhaps the best porter I have been privileged to have so far tried."
""
""
"Overall, everyone was disappointed with this one. It was the consensus 5th out of 6 pick. I had never had it before and I was expecting a great deal more from Anchor."
"Pours a dark ruby color with a large brown head and nice lacing down the glass. Aroma is all about roasted and toasted and chocolate malt. Taste is a nice balance between the sweet malts and the roasty, chocolaty bitter finish. Thick creamy mouthfeel with very smooth and slightly bitter finish."
""
"Overall: I am not a big fan of porters but this is one of the better ones."
"Mouthfeel: the best part of the beer. Full and dense, almost feels Luke food. Just what you expect from a porter."

"Anchor Porter - The bottle says: “San Francisco’s famous Anchor Porter rand is made in one of the smallest and most traditional brewer s in the world by brewers of Anchor Steam. Our old-fashioned porter is virtually handmade, with an exceptional respect for the ancient art of brewing. We use 100% malted barley, generous amounts of fresh, whole hops entirely natural carbonation and a simple, natural rewind process which is like no other in the world. The deep black color, the thick, creamy head and the intensely rich flavor of Anchor Porter, made in San Francisco since 1974, have earned this delicious and unique brew a worldwide reputation for outstanding quality. It is aesthetically pleasing and wholly superior in every respect."

"Top 10 desert island beers for me. Pours perfect opaque in a nonic glass, with a oatmeal colored foamy head. Superb notes of roasted chocolate malt and hop bitterness with each sip. A truly world-class artisan beer in every sense of the word. If you have not had one, go get it!"

"Very solid delicious porter. Nice and creamy and decently hopped."
"Pretty black color. Very hoppy on the nose especially for a porter, with some nice roasty malt in the aroma aswell. Slight sweet start, and then leeds in to a roasty malty middle and hoppy finish. Has an excellent aftertaste of bitter chocolate, and in the dying stages i have some apple notes. This is a great porter."

"just an extremely well crafted porter. pours near black, darker than most, with a nice tan head two inches tall. smells malty and acidic, but the flavor is not astringent at all. more roasty, notes of coffee, chicory, even baked dandelion root and bockish springtime malts. some gentle hopping in the background, but this one features the roast. mmm. mouthfeel is ideal for a porter. creamy and expansive in the mouth, with plenty of bubbles and a glorious complex but balanced finish. i love everyting about this beer from the packaging to the buzz. its great. ultra sessionable, and for ten bucks a sixpack, you really get a high quality product. perfect for a late winter evening. world class in my book, a better version of the classic english porter."

"Anchor never seems to fail me. Poured a black, minimal light around the edges. Scent to me was overwhelmingly of chocolate milk and cocoa, fruity as well. Taste was pleasant, milk chocolate, ripe fruits, only the slightest but of hops and char. All very subtle. Mouthfeel was thin, drinkable, and enjoyable. Overall, a really nice porter."

"O: Rich and intense, yet not as exciting as I hoped it would be. I love Anchor Steam and Old Foghorn, but won't be dropping into this port(er) again soon."
"O- I'm not a resident porter expert, but this seems to be just average."
""
"Pours a deep black color, even when held up to light I can barely see any light through it. Head is about one finger tall, off white in color, head recedes to a patchy film, leaving a few strings of lacing. Smell is of rich sweet malts, and dark fruit. Taste follows the same path of being rich and sweet without much roasted character. On the front of my to hue I get dark fruit, I also get some toffee, just a subtle touch of roasty flavor in the finish. I am not a frequent porter drinker, but my usual is Black Butte Porter, which seems colpletely different to me, they seem to be to different stylistic approaches. I do like this interpretation of the porter by anchor though. If you crave a strong, deep sweet beer with less emphasis on the roasted flavors, this is the one for you."

"While not the most complex of porters, this brewery created an interesting, sessionable porter with lots of character and nuances of flavor. I am sad it has taken me so long to try it."
"It appeared light brown in color with a small white head. It smelled of cocoa beans. It tasted of cocoa beans but a bit lighter kind of like a brooklyn brown ale. The mouthfeel is medium. Overall a good beer but in my amateur opinion it is an over rated beer."

"It's not the best porter I've had, but it's solid, and would make an excellent session beer. It's easy, smooth, and satisfying."

"O..Going with a 5 rating overall since this might be one of the best porters I have ever had. Just delicious and something every one should try at least once."
"O- an absolutely fantastic example of what a porter should be. One of the best of the style, if not the best. A must try."
""
"Sharp looking pour. Black, with a dark brown tint in the light. Thick 3 finger head with tight carbonation. Strong caramel and toffee aroma. Nice sweet malt flavor with some bitterness. Fades to a burnt roast on the finish. Real, real tasty, and easy to drink a bit too quickly."
""
""
""
""
"Big body and super rich. Bitter chocolate lingers on the lips."
""
"Overall - Unlike any porter I've had before.. It's almost like a dubbel mixed with a porter. The dark fruit flavour adds an interesting dynamic to the taste. Worth trying for sure."

"Overall, a great example of an American porter and something I would definitely consider purchasing again."

"O: 4.5"

"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a 1 inch foamy khaki head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Small random dots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted dark malt, dark fruits, and some slight cocoa and vanilla aromas. Taste is of roasted dark malt, cocoa, vanilla, and a slightly sour dark fruit flavor. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good porter but the sour/fruity aspect was unexpected."

"This beer looks fantastic. The darkest hade of black I c an imagine with a beautiful off white head. The smell is also very good, if subtle. Lots of bananas, chocolate, a little bit of coffee. The taste follows the nose, in that there are exotic flavors, but a beautiful sense of restraint. Very little coffee flavor (in my opinion this is a great thing for this style), but it is evident and blends perfectly with the ripe fruit flavors and slightly smoky finish. I can't believe it's taken me this long to try this. One of the best porters I've ever had!"

"o - Overall a pretty decent porter. The nose was pretty much just roasted malts. The taste was a little bit better, but again the body was a bit too thin. Worth trying but not my favorite."
"O: Easily one of the best Porters I've ever tasted, I will be enjoying this brew whenever possible."
""
""
"Poured into pint glass. Nigh pitch black. Small, but creamy tan head get's sticky with the glass. Smells fruity almost. Can't tell, my nose is plugged up. Taste is full and creamy, a slight tinge of fruity sourness to offset the malt and hops. Very nice porter indeed. Has just the right balance and drinkability. I love the mellow aftertaste left in your mouth after a drink. I'm glad to have finally tried this and will have one again, hopefully from the tap next time."

"O- Ever really enjoy a beer and then abandon it because “sexier” beers with more hype come along? Anchor Porter is that beer for me. Not sure why I ever stopped drinking it, but what’s not to like about a complex, full-flavored, full-bodied porter? Going back on my list of regulars. Exceptional."

"A very solid porter, with an especially creamy mouthfeel. Pours extremely dark brown with a tan head that settles to a ring. Nicely balanced aromas of bitter chocolate, cream, and roasted grain. The taste is similar with a slight metallic note and quite a bit of creaminess. Downright silky in the mouth, and with some nice lingering soft bitterness, this is a classic American Porter."

"O- A damn fine Porter from Anchor. If you love porters and haven't tried this beer before, go get some, you won't be disappointed. Highly recommended. Cheers."
"Overall: Great porter - I would certainly have it again if it was available locally."
"Despite the nose not cooperating for some reason, this was pretty darn good. Lots of sweetness, roast, and fruit are present, as is a firm hop profile to add some crispness in as well. Drinkability is pretty good considering the richness of the flavors. I’ve had better experiences with this beer in the past but I’m still confident in saying that this is a go-to Porter when you need one that is full flavored and easy drinking."
"This is a classic Porter in all it's glory. Very enjoyable"
"O - Excellent porter from Anchor that I would definitely enjoy again if I can obtain it. I would highly recommend it."
"Overall: It has a great balance of sweet and bitter. It was different but nice to taste a porter that didn't have pronounced chocolate and coffee flavors. Only downside to this was the definite alcohol taste I got but that did stop me from enjoying this beer."
"O: Not bad but not my favorite flavor profile...not enough roastiness, chocolate, coffee, etc. for my tastes."
"O-A wonderful porter, slightly better than the Smuttynose I had last night."
"A tasty porter to say the least. A bit pricey, but worth it."
"o: one of the top five porters i've ever had the pleasure to taste."
"This is a medium to full bodied brew with a thick, smooth texture in the mouth. The 5.6% abv is well integrated in this brew and makes it go down quite easy. Everything about this offering just hit the right way for me. In a time where all the neat-o brewing techniques and gimmicks seem to be the newest fad in the brewing world, it is nice to sit down and enjoy something that is adjunct and gimmick free. I really, whole heartedly enjoyed this offering from start to finish. Thank you Pete for sharing this with me. Quite an exceptional offering right here that I admittedly have overlooked and taken for granted."
"Overall: A great porter that has a great deep toasty malt character and leaves the mouth craving more."
"O: This is very good. Maybe not quite as good as Black Butte in my book but not by far."
"Chocolate aroma with a hint of smoke. Appearance is dark brown, almost black with a brown leather colored head. Taste is caramel malts with hints of coffee. Palate is smooth and creamy with a hint of carbonation. Overall a very good porter. Glad we have it regularly."
"This one hangs in there year after year while more hyped brews come and go. A true classic of the style."
"O- A beautiful and delicious beer. One of the best porters that I've ever had, but I'm not really a porter guy."
"for me its a mouth watering combo of roasted coffee and malts that makes this beer enjoyable. taste makes me regret finishing it. for me this is a top notch."
"Nicely done, and if you're ever in SF a must-have on-tap find."
"Overall: A GREAT rendition of a porter here."
"Not enough availability in the U.K. is my main gripe :D"
"This is probably, hands down, the best porter I’ve had to date. Anchor seemed to do everything right with this offering (no surprise there). This was a real treat!"
"O: I would drink this Porter over a lot of others, but it is not my favorite. It is a good drink."
"Overall, I would suggest that you try it and decide for yourself!"
"For reasons unknown, I was pessimistic about trying this beer. Although I knew it wouldn't matter if I did not like it since I received the bottle in a monthly beer exchange with friends. I poured it after dinner into an old german glass stein. By the Beard of Zeus! The glorious dark color and creamy topping was tantalizing. I was very pleased with it's drinkability. Porters and BA ratings are both new to me so I'm not sure how to rate and hesitate rating with any ""5's"". I'm not sure I have the discernable palate and ability to identify key notes as many BA members do, but I believe an earthy and slightly coffee flavor was detected. Subtle sweet/bitter taste. Awesome drink. Cheers!"
"On tap at The Grove in San Francisco. Pleasant roast malt flavor with a zing of tartness. Caramel gives a nice sweet tang anlong with the dark and slightly charred flavors. Just a hint of hops gives a bitter finish. Winey with raisins and figs, but all very restrained. Pleasant quaff and glad to taste it on tap again. It was the great Western dark beer during the brewing dark ages."
"A rich full bodied beer with a lightly bitter roasted dark chocolate aftertaste that lingers a while. A very worthy addition to any list a beer drink might have or make."
"Black but not opaque. Nose of mocha, but the grenadine subtle when it dives for the first time his nose in the drink. Finally, there is little substance in the mouth and a lack of an obvious body wear. We feel of course the roasting and the force of the water that gives a taste of both hard and sour beer. But it also feels a lack of strength and class bitterness this beer in the category of low porters."
"Recommended Music Pairing: Concert for Bangladesh - Various Artists"
"Medium bodied and soft, with a faint touch of oiliness. Stands off on its own in the realm of porters, a beer to drink when you want this specific beer and not just a porter generally. I'm not a huge fan of it, but I can't say there's anything terribly wrong with this beer."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with a light brown head about 1.5 fingers thick. the smell is rich roasty malt with hints of chocolate. the flavor follows suit with a semi sweet roasty malt base and hints of dark chocolate. the mouthfeel is well carbonated and medium body. overall a really great beer."
"What can I say? This is a classic to me...the litmus of porters. It is more than the sum of its parts. It taste like Anchor Porter, a flavor unto itself."
"If I haven't already convinced you to pick up a six pack then you are an idiot. This beer is fucking delicious."
"O - This is a typical run of the mill porter. Average at best. A good beer to be had though."
"Tried this again at the brewery and it’s actually not bad at all. Must have been dirty tap lines or something last time. Still has that Anchor Steam taste to it that sort of dulls the flavors. Must be their yeast. Has nice roasted malts as well though with some chocolate, and has a smooth, creamy palate with soft carbonation. I would put this in the ""pretty good"" range overall."
"Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, soft and sticky on the tongue. A pretty solid porter, and the addition of dark fruit flavor was a welcomed surprise."
"Comments: Thank you Anchorsteam. This is one of a few beers I will buy again. And for an avid beer taster, I don't do that often."
"This pours a very dark almost pitch black color with a large mocha head. The smell is of molasses, caramel and dark chocolate. Feel is medium to thick. Taste is of bitter roasted malts, coffee, a little sweetness and a hint of alcohol burn on the way down. Overall this is a big quality porter, one I'll definitely get again."
"Beautiful coffee color with slight head. Chocolate and coffee tones make this a solid beer. Very drinkable, Not quite as heavy as a stout but has all that big flavor. I love it!! This is what porter/ beer making is or should be about. I always say, use proper glassware. It'll improve most beverages."
"O. Really good porter. Fits what I think of when I think of a Porter. Good aroma and flavor. Surprised that I was missing out on this for so long."
"The mouthfeel is smooth, but not quite creamy. Medium bodied, low carbonation and a slight stickiness. Overall, a good porter and enjoyable to drink on this cool night. Nothing that blew me away, however, was expecting just a bit more from this."
"Overall: I'm a fan of the Porter style and think this is the best Porter I've had. This is a really good beer. Hard to believe it's so easy to find."
"Medium bodied with light carbonation. Good porter overall."
"Overall this is probably a decent porter. This has never been a favorite style for me and this is not doing anything to persuade me otherwise; still, I'm glad Anchor is still putting out solid brews and was happy to finally try this one."
"O: For me this is as good as a porter gets."
"O- A nice porter that was sweeter than I expected, but had some good balance with the bitterness, not really much roastiness though."
"One of the better porters I have had."
"O/D-I have not been very impressed by Anchor beers. This one is blatantly my favorite. Pretty good. Not exceptional but I respect why this is one of the main cogs of the style."
"O: a solid effort from Anchor Brewing, and a wonderful take on a classic style. They helped start the craft brewing revolution in America, and they continue to make top quality beers."
"Overall a very nice beer, I prefer it over most stouts I had and I wouldn't mind drinking this again. And I got another porter coming up..."
"One of my favorite go-to porters! This brew poured up near black with a mocha-colored, very foamy head with amazing retention and lacing effects. Aromas of caramel, coffee, toffee, dark fruits (figs, raisins), and a touch of molasses. Flavors of the same in a medium-bodied brew. Extra creamy and smooth with just a touch of a hoppy bite to make for a clean, refreshing finish. You can’t go wrong with this porter!"
"O: A decent porter here. A thinner flavor profile than I would like, but it suits the beer well. A solid B rated brew. There are definite similarities between this and their Steam beer, but I prefer the porter. This doesn't quite stand up to other notable heavyweights in the Porter category, but it's not a bad choice if nothing else is available."
"Overall: Very nice beer, not too complex, but very drinkable"
"O: A decent porter. Nothing wrong with it. Very drinkable. A slight twist with the dark fruits from other porters I've tried. Would purchase again."
"Overall, a very good porter that is a good example of the style."
"When I dive into it, I get a lot of fig, as well as a touch of chocolate. The mouthfeel is quite slick, which makes it an easy sipper, despite the darkness. The hops make just enough of a presence to prevent this beer from being too fruity. Personally, I love this beer, although those who prefer their porters and stouts to be hoppy might be disappointed."
"O - A very well crafted porter that would be easy to sip all day."
"o: a very good porter, better than most. Would definitely have again as along as Deschutes BB was not on tap as that is my go to porter."
"O: A very decent porter. Different from your average English porter but I still like it."
"A very fine beer, one of the ten best American Porters I have tried, though closer to no. ten than no. 1 for sure."
"Drink- A very tasty little beer. Was nice to find it on tap. Its light, smooth balanced and brighter than most."
"I taste notes of mocha, fruity espresso and anise. I taste barreled bourbon The beer is extremely bitter in a dry way with a chalky feeling . The beer isn't overly sweetened and the mouthfeel is leathery and chewy. I appreciate the natural level of carbonation. I really love the body on this beer, it's a great sipping beer for a cold day."
"Overall: Not a bad *brew* I suppose, but no better than average overall. Not my cup of tea."
"Pours super dark brown. A tan head stays and coats the glass. Smell is coffee-like malts, a bit of booze as well. Taste is sweeter than the smell, some anise and dark fig taste as well as some dark cacao. Good taste. Feel is a bit ""hot"" for a porter, imo. A good drinker, not superlative of the style, imo, but very good."
"The dark fruits hit up front plumb and raisin, followed by sweet toffee fading into some slight bitter coffee and chocolate notes. An excellent porter. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy - this is truly a delight to the senses."
"Light texture on the mouthfeel, but very drinkable. An excellent porter that could be enjoyed in a great variety of situations."
"O - Overall I enjoyed this one. It has all the elements I look for in a good porter. It possesses a good amount of sweetness with just enough roast to keep it in check."
"Pours a dark brown with deep garnet highlights when held to light. Creamy frothy espresso like head sticks around for some time before attaching itself to the side of the glass. Rich malty aromas waft above the glass. Coffee, chocolate, brown sugar and toffee mixed with a hint of earthy hops. Taste is malty with coffee toffee and chocolate. Earthy/herbal bitterness mixes with a hint of alcohol and a touch of smoke somewhere in the middle. Long lingering bitter chocolate and hops in the finish. Creamy, bubbly mouthfeel, ample almost to much carbonation, medium body. Great old school American style porter."
"O- Solid porter and no real drawback at all to this one."
"Overall: Good basic porter, your not confused with this beer. It has the basic flavors that make up a porter, very drinkable beer anyday of the year"
"O - An exceptional example of the style, and definitely a nice one to sit and enjoy."
"O: Enjoyable beer, the texture is spot on, but lacking in some aroma."
"Overall I don't think it's an incredibly complex beer, but a good-solid representation of the style. Very drinkable. A great porter to have on deck at all times."
"This pours out a wonderful deep reddish black with an incredible long lived tan head. It has very light carbonation and is an incredible example of the style. This beer will keep calling back to you I guarantee you. It doesn't even sit heavy in your stomach so it has excellent sessionability for a porter. This is in my top 5 beers for sure! Let this bad boy warm up. The closer it gets to room temperature, the smoother and creamier it gets. Mmm, mmm, good. I want another one!"
"BOomshakalaka...this one's nice nice!"
"Beer is medium to light in body, minimal carbonation on the palate, overall a little sweet and mildly chocolaty with a pretty clean not bitter finish and no aftertaste. I was expecting a little bitterness but overall it is a decent porter. I'd have it again at a party or a shitty bar that had no good beer."
"Overall this is a pretty solid good brew from Anchor and can't miss the boat. Are there better ones I think so, but this is pretty solid with no complaints that's for sure. It's good, just not exceptional to me."
"D/O- Awesome awesome awesome porter here. Great ""drinkability"". Very good, widely available ""beginner"" porter than holds up even for veterans of the style."
"Overall; not my favorite porter. It's not bad, a little different than what I'm used to. It just didn't scream my name, nor I it."
"Overall a fine example of the style. Gunna be buying more of this from now on."
"O: a pretty classic porter, I like how smoky and dry it is. It's maybe a little too metallic for me, but it's a very drinkable/sessionable beer."
"O- Overall this was a decent brew but something was a little strange about the flavor."
"A really nice porter. The only thing I have issues with is the tea like herbal scents/flavors that are very similar to Anchor's Liberty Ale. It works in a pale ale, but less so in a porter."
"Smooth, creamy, coffee, and stunning looks with a stiff caramel cream head makes this beer the worlds eight wonder. Say no more - get your hands on this !"
"Overall - this is a really solid porter. well crafted. a must try."
"O: An easier drink than it appears, this is a very solid choice. As expected, mostly dark malts and fruits, but a lack of the syrupy sweetness and overpowering alcohol."
"Overall: Let me put it this way: the best porter I've ever tasted. Very deep and enriching, while smooth and perfectly drinkable. It's like candy to the beer drinker (without all the sweetness). A must try for any lover of dark beer."
"O: Cheers to Fritz and the guys. This one's a winner."
"Poured a dark black that light will not penetrate with a thick, creamy light brown head. The head retains about a centimeter that does not go away and looks like the head on an ice cream soda...delicious. Can't really distinguish much from smell, just grains. The first sip is delicious. This is definitely an excellent porter. It tastes like coffee and chocolate with just enough hops to balance. It has sweetness, but it's not as noticeable as the espresso bitterness, which in itself is not overwhelming, but it definitely defines the taste of the beer. Overall, this is exactly what I want in a porter. What a great example of the style."
"O: Good, but not great. A solid porter that was a little boring for me. Would be a good introductory porter."
"One of the best though."
"Glad I tried this beer and glad I got the 6 pack instead of the single..."
"Overall, Anchor Porter may not have the rich flavors of the best American Porters, but it's mouthfeel and drinkability are world class and it's plenty delicious too. It resembles an English Porter much more than an American one."
"ODO date code. Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured black with a four finger tan head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, and dark fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, cream, dark chocolate, and subtle caramel. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. Both the flavor and aroma was quite complex making this one quite enjoyable and kept you guessing on what you would pick up on next. I wouldn't have tried this one had it not been on the Hall of Fame list if I'm honest. Really glad it is readily avaliable in my area. An absolute must try for sure and might even make a decent gateway brew."
"[Despite the other reviews saying this is hoppy, it wasn't apparent to me ...]"
"Overall clean and quaffable. Distinctly a porter and quite drinkable."
"O - Overall a very good porter. Slightly more bitter and smoky than I look for in a porter. Still a well brewed beer."
"This porter pours out with a very dark brown body with a tan colored head on it that fades after drinking a few sips. The aroma is kind of a little bit like old leather to me and roasted malts. Not much else on the nose. The flavor was roasted, and a little bitter and dry in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side for a beer of this color. It's not bad but I feel that there are more impressive porters out there."
"Picked up a bottle of this the other night to finally give it a try and I am definitely impressed by this brew. Had a good, dark brown appearance with a clean two finger head. It smells of a porter but nothing too special in the olfactory realm. Now as for the taste and mouthfeel, this is where it truly shines. Intense smokey flavors of roasted malts balanced perfectly with a light hop finish; truly pleasing after each sip. The mouthfeel was smooth as silk and never felt overly heavy, even when nearing the last drop. I've always been a huge fan of their Anchor steam beer but I have found this one to be just as wonderful and complex."
"O: Overall this is a silky smooth porter, just enough char taste and light smokiness , light and well blended coffee flavors with a well balanced creaminess . I would have this again."
"O - OVerall a very good porter, but in many way it is closer to an English style porter than an American style Much closer to Samuel Smith's than to Great Lakes."
"Pours a deep amber to a brown-ish/ black color, with a tan head. In the aroma, roasted malts and a nice coffee presence. In the taste, small pine hops, coffee, and a roasted malt. A hop bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry coffee and pine like aftertaste. Nice coffee presence and nice pine hops, I dig it!"
"I was pleasently surprised by this brew, I dont like sweet beers and I wouldn't call this a sweet beer. But there is a sweet smeel and a sweet taste. The brew comes together in a very good way. Worth a try."
"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of roasted malts, some chocoalte. Taste is good, malts, some chocolate, slightly sweet, very flavorful. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a beer worth seeking out."
"This is my 4th Anchor beer. Picked a 12oz. up at CostPlus World Market. Quick note on them: An amazing store, lots of brewery name beer glasses, lots of hard to find brands like Deschutes and DFH, tons of imported 750ml bottles including some Trappists, AND they sell single beers. Anything from NewCastle to Red Seal Ale. An excellent way of trying beers you wouldn't be able to drink a six-pack of. Back to the beer. Beautiful black color, looks lovely in a snifter. Just a few points off perfect. I couldn't get much flavor besides the roasty malts and yeast. Forgive me if im wrong. Either way amazing beer. ill defiantly pick up more. I would buy a sixer of this even though it would take me a while to finish it due to a queue of lighter beers, but every time I see a CostPlus I won't think twice about a picking up a single to enjoy by a fire. Stay thirsty my friends."
"Quite a nice porter, overall. It has good flavor, excellent drinkability, and I'd gladly have it again."
"Great porter, loved the citrus and roastiness. I really enjoyed the woodiness as well, not sure if they used norther brewer hops similar to Anchor Steam. Overall, a very unique and great porter."
"O - This is about as solid as a brew can get; the balance is sublime, the sensory element is pleasant in any situation (i.e. can be drank anywhere, anytime, all-weather), the price is right, availability is prevalent, et al. Hypothetically, this beer could be improved in all aspects: better head retention and lace, more intensity or dynamic in the nose, additional complexity to the flavor, Belgian-style creaminess or English-style smoothness in the feel; in reality, however, this is all nitpicking and hair-splitting. This brew is nearly perfect."
"O: Smooth dark flavor without any burnt notes. There is a noticeable lack of hop dominance which makes me happy. Seems too many porters today are overhopped. Superb beer. This is insanely drinkable. Just rediscovered my favorite porter."
"Drinkability/overall-A really solid porter, definitely in the upper echelon for the style, that goes down easy and enjoyably."
"Hadn't had this in a while am I don't remember it being this good. Balanced, full-flavored, but quite light and easy-drinking."
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation makes this a nice thirst-quencher for such a dark beer. Crisp and refreshing, this beer coats your mouth nicely but is not sticky in the least. Any more carbonation would make this porter too cola-like."
"(This is my opinion, and any similarities to your own may have been intended and/or unintended by the author of this review. In order to fully appreciate this Original American Craft Beverage I suggest you go out and try it yourself.)"
"Pours black with a small mocha head. The dominant smell is a dark roasted malt with some sweet notes. The taste start sweets with great malt flavor. This one has a subtle smokiness to it, then finishes sweet. The mouthfeel was impressive, smooth with great depth of flavor. This is an easy drinking porter, it doesn't sit heavy like some darks, but still has nice body to back up the style. Worth checking out."
"I would judge this a well put together porter. The only negative i could find is that I feel there could have been a better balance between malts and hops. This is just nitpicking though because the difference is so slight. I would not hesitate purchasing another 6 pack"
"I haven't had a lot of Porters but I really enjoyed this beer and it will definitely be a re-buy."
"Overall I gotta say it's a decent porter to standby - not too complex and smooth all the way around."
"12 ounce bottle, code of 0N3, bottled on November 30th, 2010, bought as a single at World Market. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch and a half frothy tan head. The head stays around for a long time, and there's a lot of lacing left behind on the glass. Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and some dark fruit. The taste is similar to the aroma, but the dark fruit flavors (plum, raisins) and bittersweet chocolate flavors are the strongest, and some burnt/charred malt flavors are noticable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's smooth, slick and a bit creamy with moderate carbonation. Overall, I think it's a good brew. I'd definitely buy this again."
"O: It is without a doubt, the best porter I've ever had - which is a very bold statement."
"O - Solid brew really, easy to drink, pretty complex for the style. Could just use more ""punch"" to the flavors to be an elite porter."
"Respectable, but I much prefer other Anchor offerings."
"I have only had Anchor's Steam Beer (which I don't care for), and am very happy I tried this. It is an outstanding porter."
"Drinkability: I would definitely drink another. This beer is interesting because each sip is a slightly different experience than the last. I notice something new about the flavor that may have been hidden on the last sip."
"Drinkability - This drink is great on its own and would be my go-to session beer when it comes to porters/stouts. However, I'm sure this beer would go GREAT with a meal, and I can't wait to pair it. I can just tell it'll really work well."
"Pour yields a very dark brown-colored brew with a really nice tan head and quite a bit of lacing. Solid retention as well. The nose brings forward some light chocolate and roast. There is also a bit of toffee and caramel lingering in the background. The taste is similar, leaning more toward the chocolate with a bit of malt sweetness. Body is too thin and undercarbonated. Not my favorite from Anchor."
"Mouthfeel is equally outstanding with a nice creamy texture. Smooth and lightly carbonated an absolute dream to sip. This is one of the best beers not only from anchor brewing but also in the porter style. Tasty and decadent with very simple flavors done extremely well. A great brew that you need to try."
"Other than that, the feel on the palate is solid, if not spectacular. It leaves a bit of coating post-sips, and is creamy at times. Drinkability is very good, and the abv keeps this sessionable. Love having this beer available for cheap all the time, it really is a fantastic standard porter."
"The carbonation is the only thing holding this beer back. I'm guessing that my bottle was an exception to the rule."
"Overall, an enjoyable porter and goes down smooth because of the lighter character. I'll definitely have to explore more porters."
"Gargantuan head, even with a measured pour, easily fills a third of the glass with densely packed microfoam, more peaks and valleys than dimpling, benchmark retention, shit ain't going nowhere. the lacing produces broad, sticky streaks here and little of effect there. Pretty much jet black to onyx colored liquid, sliver of dark zinc orange at the bottom, The nose is much more sour and penetrating than many of its ilk, as if it wants to show sour milk next to the powdered cocoa and caramel. slight pickled quality to it, the more you sniff it the more you realize that it has a lean, semi-defiant attitude that almost wants to play down any roast to toast as well as plum, cherry, apricot scents and leave it all to the standoffish malts to win the day. In the mouth the sourness doesn't try to hide, lemon and orange front and center, herbal streak there too. Hard breakfast pastry character to it, not soft like a croissant but not entirely charmless either. Loads of cocoa powder and cofee, heavy duty, coats the peach, apple, pear fruit close to fully. Has a distinct personality, something I'm willing to accept readily, still not a beer that seems interesting in crafting a fully enjoyable experience."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: The body is between light and medium with a medium amount of fine carbonation. It doesn't hit creamy for me, but still decent. This is definitely a tasty, drinkable porter from Anchor. I find it pretty unique in subtle ways, which is very refreshing. A good take on the style."
"D: Mouthfeel almost brought this up a bit, but I can't get past the overly sweet taste. Again, this isn't a bad beer; there are just 1. better tasting porters out there and 2. sweet porters with more balance, which temper my likelihood of picking this one up again."
"I've not heard that many people talk about this beer, but I'll just say that people should be. An amazing porter rivaled by few."
"Notes: Pity it took me so long to reach this one. This is a quality and tasty porter. Thanks to good but short tap line where a couple of choices were finishes and this looked the best, and it was."
"Very good foam, brown like the beer.. Aromas of coffe, chocolate, bitter cocoa and raisins. In mouth roasted and chocolate but especially bitterness like expected at the nose. Good body and an interesting viscosity. Dry finish for this beer with an incredible balance between sweet tones of malt and hop bitterness. A small level of alchool for this average drinking beer!!"
"D - A bit too thick for my preference. I could see having one on a slow night, but not outside of that."
"Drinkability: Fantastic. This is a great porter for any time of year, but based on its price, it's not something I would buy on a regular basis. If you like porters, though, you owe it to yourself to try this."
"Drinkability: Overall just a very good beer that invites you to drink more."
"D- A nice easy to drink, malt heavy porter. Classic."
"Very nice beer - solid and delicious."
"Notes: Overall it's a well made and very enjoyable American Porter."
"The CPJ"
"Overall a very solid ale here, nothing over the top or out of the ordinary, just a solid after dinner treats."
"Drinkability: There is a mild hopiness that lingers smack dab in the middle of the tongue for just a little too long, otherwise I would rate this beer a little higher."
"D: Actually would be easy to have multiple despite the rich taste."
"An excellent Porter I've enjoyed many times in the past but never got around to reviewing. Good stuff!"
"The beer was black, there was just a sliver of light that shines through the edge of the glass with brownish, red hues. The head was tall, filmy and tan colored. I could smell lots of roasted malt, molasses, chocolate and a dark fruity presence. Tastes roasty, there is some licorice and molasses, raisin and bitter coffee. The liquid is smooth and silky, it has low carbonation and a thick medium body. The rich flavor and full body prevents me from drinking very many at a time, it's very enjoyable though."
"Drinkability: Sippable, drinkable, gulpable, it's smooth."
"Served out of bottle @ 49F, pours into a good 2 -3 fingers tan head. This one was opaque in color w/ hints of deep ruby when held up to the light. Pretty good lacing down the glass. Coffee & milk chocolate are in the nose w/ some hops that I can't identify. A slight toffee aroma as well, just slight though. Tastes a little spicy from the hops & a has a dry aftertaste. Caramel malt is present & has a mildly sweet middle. When left on the palate, a burnt malt character come in w/ a quick finish. Has a fair amount of carbonation & keeps a slight head throughout the sitting. Mouthfeel is good in my opinion & is medium bodied overall. This is a great beer on a cold, rainy, or overcast day. Glad I have this one to keep me company. I'm a big fan of Porters & Stouts - this one will have a place in my regular lineup of beers. Prosit!"
"Slips down okay but I think this is a pretty poor example of the style. I won't be buying this again."
"D: This beer goes down very easily and is quite flavorful, making it very sessionable."
"OVERALL: Solid brew overall. A creamier, fuller palate would have helped, but this was still a very enjoyable and drinkable beer non-the-less. A unique brew within the American porter category, but one that is definitely worth checking out if you get the chance. Recommended."
"D- This is my favorite porter (so far). I'm just loving this beer right now."
"D-one of my first porters to review but am impressed... wouldn't say I would choose this beer after having just one sip but if you sit down and enjoy a whole glass you realize this is a great Porter"
"D- This might reignite my former love affair with porters. Hope to hell that this stays on the shelves at my local store."
"This is an exceptional Porter. I'm typically not a huge fan of the style, but find Anchor's version excellent. Pours almost black, yet light can pass through and shows a nice reddish hue. The off-white head is thick and creamy. The beer drinks very well, presenting dark roasted malt flavor, coffee, cocoa and hints of bitterness. There is a nice bit of sweeness in the brew as well---but just a hint---not cloying at all. Frankly, this reminds me of a great Irish Dry stout with much more body and flavor. This is a beer I crave come cool weather. Definitely worth a shot, a classic brew."
"D: This just struck me as too sweet and one dimensional. Nothing special at all."
"Pours with two fingers of carbonation or so. The color is a dark brown with a bit of deep ruby when held to the light. There isn't much a nose on this beer, just a hint of sweetness, very much like caramel and roasted malts. Taste is a nice rich malt flavor with some bitterness and some signs of coffee. A nice full-bodied porter for the winter. One of my go-to porters."
"Pours dark brown with a light tan head. Aroma is barley, and sweet banana, with a bit of chocolate. Taste is similar with barley, more chocolate and the fruity banana sweetness. Good thick mouthfeel with a long finish that is a little dry. Overall not super complex, but a very solid porter."
"The ethanol can be tasted more than it can be smelled, a little too overpowering, but otherwise delicious."
"These are actually better than I remember, which is rare in my experience. A really wonderful porter."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I can't say for sure, but I'm betting that the recipes for this and their Christmas Ale have a few things in common. Very nice Porter. Anchor has been around a while, and this is still one of the better examples of the style."
"Pours black with a giant tan head. It as a soft dark chocolate smell to it. It tastes similar with a coffee like taste and feel while in the mouth. The after taste is a bit sweet and vanilla like. It goes down really smooth would be a good late evening snack beer or a good cold night beer."
"It's hard to describe the way these flavors meld together in perfect harmony. One of the best American Porters out there."
"M/D) Medium to full body, doesn't really coat the mouth but the flavor isn't thin either. Not much in the way of prickling from the carbonation. Very smooth, easy drinking beer."
"D: This is an easy beer to drink. If it elicited any emotion out of me at all, I'd drink it all day as it's extremely sessionable. Instead, this beer leaves me with just apathy."
"D - I would consider highly getting this again. Drinks so smooth and full of all kinds of flavor. Great porter!"
"The mouthfeel is slightly carbonated and fairly full bodied, very nice. The drinkability is stellar. A very good porter from Anchor that I highly recommend."
"Drinkability: Frankly, I am a little disappointed; I remember it being much better from the tap -- obviously -- at Anchor. However, it is still a good brew."
"This is a good porter. I poured it into a IMP pint glass and was greeted with a two finger tan head that stuck around for a while. The body was black on this brew no surprise there. The nose was full of coffee and roasted malts . Flavors were just like the nose coffee and chocolate notes abound. The mouthfeel was ok but need some more body. Easy to drink I could have a few in a sitting"
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is jet black, with a dark tan, thin head that quickly dissipates into a ring of film. Held up to the light, the beer has brown highlights in the coloring around the edges. The beer has smeels of caramel, sweet malt, and a bit of hops. The initial tastes are sweet and light, followed by a quick transition into a bitter-hopped and coffee flavoring. The beer is light in mouth in comparison to other porters, and very crisp and sharp on the finish, with toasty flavors lingering in mouth a bit. A toasty and very light coffee aftertaste, and not overpowering at all. This is a pretty easy beer to gulp down if you aren't paying attention. Interesting, but I have had other porters I care more for."
"Great beer, got me interested in craft brews, and I'm still going back to it when i can."
"Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Overall, it's good! Let he redemption begin!"
"Drinkability - quite drinkable; I will have some more."
"In all fairness, I will probably try this beer again when I can verify the age of the batch and how it was handled post brewery."
"FourthBeer potential: VERY HIGH, as a subtle, non-imposing porter that is good as a closer."
"D: great porter from a brewer with a huge american craft history at a great price. An easy buy again when looking for a porter."
"Overall, excellent. This is a good example of why I love porters."
"WOW! This beer goes down like nothing I have ever tried. It is as drinkable as it gets. Taste is molasses with a burnt malty finish. The after taste is quick which creates your mouth wanting for more. And smell has hints of roasted coffee and toffee flavors. Glad I tried this at the early age of 21. Now I have a whole new appreciation for beer and especially the porter style. Bravo Anchor."
"Overall, a great porter, delicious and could be addicting. Good brew."
"If you want the perfect porter I'd say go grab a Taddy Porter. Want to try very good US porters? I'd recommend Bully Porter or Sierra Nevada Porter. If you like really sweet porters - this one might just be for you."
"I would not recommend drinking this very cold, its much better on the warmer side."
"Overall: not a bad brew. Will let it sit a bitmore cause it could be drank at a nic warm temp. Is filling on a cold day nice overall brew"
"On the fuller end of medium bodied with a lot of roasted and silky chocolate malt flavor. Surprisingly hop forward with a much stronger bitter, earthy pine profile than the aroma suggests. A bit more roasty and dry than I expected with hints of roasted coffee bean, luscious chocolate, burnt toast and oatmeal. There is a slight lactic cream presence mid-palate that adds to the complexity and balance, making this beer pretty quaffable. The maltier flavors open up as it warms but it's still a bit too bitter for my liking."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a deep not quite opaque black with a thin light tan head that diminishes to a ring and leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is cocoa and dark malts. The taste is a nice blend of ddark malts, chocolate malts and a bit of coffee. The beer is on the light side of medium with smooth carbonation. This is a very enjoyable porter, one I would certainly have again."
"Overall a wonderful beer. Needs only slight tweaks to it and that's being overly critical. Just a great beer and an incredible one for the price. It's just a steal."
"Drinkability: Would be a wonderful, deep, soothing, comforting brew if it weren't for that awful biterness."
"Is a great session beer."
"Pours black with a coffee colored two-finger head. Solid lacing and head retention. Aroma of roasted coffee beans and dark chocolate. Very nice. Roasted flavor up front. Coffee and bitter chocolate. Dark fruit, black licorice and molasses present as you get further into the beer. Finishes back around with dry and burnt chocolate notes."
"D: Pretty damn easy to drink and enjoyable porter, here. I'd gladly drink this beer again."
"D: This beer is fucking outstanding. Hands down the best porter I've had and in the running for the best dark beer ever. I'd be happy drinking this and only this for the rest of my life. My new go-to beer for sure!"
"Very drinkable, one of the best porters on the market."
"Overall I am very disappointed in this beer. After seeing the reviews I was rather excited. The smell, look, and drinkability are there but it lacks a taste. Glad I tried it but for sure a one time thing. Great beer Anchor Brewing."
"Poured a dark brown color with a nice thick tan head from a 12 oz stout bottle, with no ABV or freshness date. Good head retention with the beer turning pitch black once poured completely. The aroma is mainly malty, with hints of nuts, caramel and yeast with faint aroma of hops in the background. The taste is roasted malts/nuts with lingering chocolate and coffee aftertaste. Hops make their presence felt in every other sip, but otherwise it is a beautiful, silky rich blend of nuts, chocolate and malts which coat the palate. The taste definitely gets better as the beer warms up. The lacing is very good; everything about this beer leaves you wanting more. This is, in my opinion one of the finest porters available. Very high drinkability and is definitely a beer which I can have anytime, anyplace. A must-have for every porter lover; VERY highly recommended."
"Very nice Porter."
"pours burnt brown with a fluffy light tan head that lasts. toffee and malt on the nose. toffee and vanilla malt sweetness with a light bitter coffee finish. soft velvety mouth feel paired with the sweet and light bitter balance makes this an extremely drinkable porter."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a deep brown color, with tanned head and fair lacing. Aroma is of dark fruit, juicy malt with a touch of nuts and yeast. Medium body with sweet malt, dark fruit and espresso coffee fill the mouth. Nice long dry finish. Great porter."
"Wow, what a great Porter. Anchor has been doing it a long time and they do it well. Hopefully it stays that way, with the changes and all."
"D -- This is the prescribed beer for a cold winter evening. Not too extreme, very roasty without being harsh and slightly sweet in balance, full of character without being overwhelming -- delicious, outstanding beer. Wow, I really forgot how good this is."
"I like this beer, but it's somewhat unusual in flavor for a porter. Rich, for sure, but in a bittersweet, burnt kind of way. I'm most of the way through my 6-pack and I can't decide how I feel about this. Certainly not awful at all, though."
"Overall, this is a fantastic porter, definitely one of my favorites. The flavors mesh very well together and the body of the beer takes the cake. I'd recommend this one to all the porter lovers out there."
"This porter feels a lot like a time capsule to me in that it seems to be a beer brewed in the heritage of the original porters of old while still retaining the truly American interpretation; it carries with it a timeless quality as a previous reviewer noted (and I agree entirely.) This is my first Anchor Brewing experience, and it is surely an impressive one at that. A fine porter - I would definitely pick this one up again."
"D: A tasty and pretty well balanced, rich porter."
"A good beer, not my favorite. A bit bitter in the aftertaste. Would have preferred a slightly sweeter taste. There are vanilla and carmel notes to the flavor. However, the taste seems to dissolve quickly. The color and smell is of carmel. Not much carbonation to the beer. I would probably buy this beer again, but not for a while."
"Split a bottle of this while leaving Napa Valley (it was the best/most interesting beer in the corner store). Pours a creamy brown colour with thick tan head. Smells of a nice coffee and chocolate roast combination, without being too much of either. Really smooth mouthfeel. This would easily be an every day porter for me if we had access to this in Ontario."
"This is one of those rare beers that truly lives up to the legend and the hype behind it. A remarkable Porter on its own merits, it also comes across as greater than the sum of its parts as well. Worth seeking out and worth revisiting if locally available."
"This is a great brew, and I have a few left. ;0)"
"D: It is easy to believe that this beer is a likely glimpse into porters past as the qualities found here conjure a timeless feeling while remaining characteristically Anchor. Common threads exist here between other darker offerings, such as the holiday seasonal--this porter is convincing as a darker, unspiced sibling of their ""special ale"". Expect effortless versatility in food pairings; I served it with braised chicken and pureed sweet potatoes to good effect."
"Wow, this is a tremendous brew. A highly sessionable, easy drinking, great looking brew. This and Great Lakes Edmond Fitzgerald are the best porters I have had to date. World class stuff here."
"Extremely drinkable. This is the prototype of what a porter should be. World-class beer for sure."
"Pours a deep dark mahogany with a long lasting tan head. Nose is roasted malts, caramel. Taste is roasted malt, sweet caramel some hints of roasted esspresso and some bitterness. Palate is full body, thick texture, with good carbonation. Finish is bitter sweet caramel malts, with some roasted esspresso. Overall a well balanced and tasty brew."
"Overall: A nice tasty porter. It lacks any mind-boggling characters, but it is subtly complex. Definately worth checking out."
"D - Easy to enjoy several of these, as each quaff moves easily and pleasantly from sweet to bitter without tasting the extremes of sugar or hops. Just the right amount of roasting makes this clearly a porter, not a slightly less-roasted stout in disguise. Consistently one of my favorite porters and what I reach for when I want a sure thing."
"This oldie but goodie will be in my cooler weather rotation from here on out."
"Drink well my friends"
"Excellent beer. A cross between reddish and blackish color. Has a thick tan head, which isn't too bad. Smells of malts. Taste of Chocholate and caramel. Mouthful, well the malted and roasted items do the talking. Drinkabilty is wonderful. An everyday american porter"
"D/M: A different kind of carbonation tingle, really hits the center of the tongue. drinks very smooth, with a great depth. Leaves a nice smoothness on the pallet"
"Pours an opaque jet black with faint redish highlights. Thick pillowy chocolate milk colored head and great lacing. Smell is a great mix of sweet chocolate malt and strong bitter coffee. Some smokey burnt toast smells are in the background. Awesome. Fantastic tasting porter. Robust burnt smokey malt flavor balanced with a very smooth and sweet chocolate. Expresso flavors are abundant. There is just enough hop biterness at the end to balance. The roasted sweet malty flavors are allowed to do their thing. Great thick creamy chewy mouthfeel makes it satisfying without being too heavy. Goes down nice without being a gut-bomb. This might be my new favorite porter. Excellent beer."
"this is truly a great tasting porter. it was kind of hard for me to grade, i was torn in a lot of categories between 4's, 4.5's, and 5's. highly recommended"
"I'm very impressed with this offering. Tons of interesting flavors which get along well in the same glass. Sometimes a good porter just hits the spot!"
"Anchor Porter is a dark beer, the liquid is a black color that sports some dark orange spots towards the top and edges. A thick looking beer with a thick, tight cream/tan head about an inch in stature. Pokadot spots. Scents exude roasted malt, chocolate, coffee grinds, cream, and a bouquet of hops to round it out. Dark fruits with some warming, kinda rotted, nothing large though. This is a nicely rounded porter for such low strength, Up front a mix of vanilla/cram and roasted malt, followed by chocolate/coffee, finished with dark fruit and licorice in the end, although minimal. All in all a tasty treat. The body is built up for the low ABV output, that for one is impressive. A silky body thats a strong medium build and slight carb in feel. A very respectable porter and my favorite offering from this brewery."
"D: Absolutely. But I am partial to darker styles."
"D: Very drinkable. Flavorful and smooth."
"Bottle poured into leffe glass, black body with 1/4 inch mocha head that fades nicely and leaves lots of lacing. Smell is perfect porter - sweet malts, rich chocolate and caramel, followed by earthy hops. Taste is very mild considering the smell - very rich mocha chocolate flavor, some balancing bitter hops. Mouthfeel is medium/light bodied with medium carbonation. This is an excellent example of an American Porter, drinkability is great."
"12oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint. Pours two shades shy of black with an opaque clarity. Head is two inches, khaki-colored and rocky. Head slowly collapses to half its volume within minutes. Thin, concentric bands of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Not much happening with the nose - some faint, roasted malt character and perhaps a hint of lactose sweetness. Flavor profile expresses light, roasted malt, a hint of cocoa, a slightly metallic character and perhaps some nuttiness. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lively, effervescent carbonation. All and all, not a bad porter, but carbonation is a little too assertive, approaching fizzy, and the flavor seemed just a little off."
"Drinkability - I really, really, really like this brew. I haven't had a tremendous amount of Porters in my life, but this one has to be at the top of my list of ones I have had thus far. Perfect for those late Autumn and Winter days and evenings. Easily drinkable. This is a beer that I will have to visit every year at some point or another. Thanks Anchor.... for brewing it."
"Drinkability: With an iconic brewery like Anchor you don't get a lot of gimmicky beers, what you get are really good examples of the style. I often over look their beers, but every time I go back, I am never disappointed. I've already finished off half of the six pack I bought last night, but I will definitely start keeping this in the regular rotation."
"D - a straight ahead no frills porter that represents the style well, goes down very smooth, a sessionable porter"
"D - As complex and wonderful as this beer is, I personally find it to be a little on the dry, bitter side. A bit too much for me to have more than one pint of. It's a fantastic beer regardless."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with just the right amount of carbonation. Very drinkable. Probably one of the best porter's I've have."
"D - Quite drinkable, the malt is perfectly balanced by the roast character with just a touch of hops to bring everything together. This is one of the very few porters that really stands out as stylistically different from a stout. The roast character is quite subtle and only really comes out in the finish. Dark sugar characteristics dominate with a spiciness that seems to be more in line with what a porter would have traditionally been expected to taste like. A nice, drinkable beer and a good reminder of why Anchor has withstood the test of time."
"Someone gave me this bottle to try- I wish I had a four-pack! This is a good everyday dark beer as it's well balanced and not too overpowering."
"Wow this is a dark, dark beer with a three finger head of light brown thick bubbles. The head clamed down after about two minutes. Wonderful lace left of the side of the glass. The color rates a 40, as dark as it gets, can't see any light through this brew. Smell of dark chocolate, brown sugar, and molasses. Nice sweet taste very close to the smell. Rich dark cocoa, sweetness of sorghum and malt. Heavy silk feeling in my mouth, doesn't get much better than this porter. Yes this is on the top of my shopping list for beers to share with friends that are into a treat."
"Notes: A very nice porter with mixes of cocoa, anise, raisin, nutty, earthy, and caramel malt flavors. Sweet, tart, spicy, and roasted tones all come in and out. Might not be world class, but a great beer for a good price. Recommend picking one up."
"Pours with a frothy off-white head and shows opaque brown color with some dark red around the edges. Aromas of toffee, bitter chocolate and vanilla-oak. Very well proportioned and balanced toffee and roasted malt flavors are backed by pleasant carbonation that gives this a vibrant mouthfeel and makes for a very drinkable porter that is light on its feet while bringing a heavy flavor profile."
"Light carbing, medium full mouthfeel. I could drink a few of these every night."
"While it is a pleasant beer, I was disappointed. Seeing the grade it was given, I was expecting more. I'm surprised it's listed as #5. The Robust Porter listed at #6 is better."
"Surely, one of the granddaddys of American craft porters."
"The coffee comes through stronger in the taste than the aroma, a dark chocolate coffee bitterness happens in the aftertaste, the roasted malt rounds out the flavors, carbonation is quite assertive but at the same time rather soft."
" Overall, I was truly amazed at the taste and smell of the beer, very much above the price I paid for it. I'm happy I tried it and will probably buy more in the future. Cheers!"
"D - This porter has it all and is highly recommended to any porter fan! The appearance is fantastic with look, scent and mothfeel all contributing the a fabulous experience. The flavours are nicely balanced, not overly bitter and the higher ABV goes largely unnoticed."
"D - Porters are one of my favorite styles due to their flavor profile and not-so-crazy abv's. This is one of the better ones I have tried and was a pleasure to try. I'll have to buy this again."
"Overall a great porter, I'm a definite fan."
"Obviously made with care, a good selection for an evening roasting chestnuts in the fireplace with a side of eggnog on the hearth."
"A pretty decent porter, so suitable for such a rainy autumn day. The undercurrent of fruity and (maybe milky?) sour notes adds a pleasant further dimension to the solid malt/hop interplay. Sure went down easy, this one did - too bad I only procured the one."
"Very good. A true classic American Porter."
"I don`t drink enough of this stuff it`s a treat and well priced here in the Calgary the city of summer snow"
"D-great for a porter and one of the best from Anchor as far as I'm concerned."
"Notes: This is a classic American Porter that garners a considerable amount of praise. It is a very good beer and there is some complexity to it. However, I found the dark fruit flavors to be a bit too dominating. There is a bit of an astringent quality to it as well that I find to be mildly annoying. This is still a very good beer, and really a must-drink for any beer enthusiast."
"Smooth, rich, warming with a somewhat dry finish.nearly full body with a very light, tight effervescence. An extremely quaffable brew. Rich enough to drink it slowly, delicious enough to want to have several."
"This was almost a perfect american porter, the flavor was great, very complex. Also it was very easy to drink, though it is filling it seemed like every sip presented something new to taste."
"There is almost a breadflavour to it, with topnotes of the floral kind."
"I love porters and this is one my go to beer's. It's got a great mouthfeel, flavor, nose, and is very drinkable. Goes well with food, especially pretzels and cigars. At $8/6 pack, not a bad deal at all either. Readily available and a classic American brewer too. Enjoy!"
"I bought this because i love porters and have never had this one. Too bad this was apparently bottled in April of 2010 so it wasn't as good as it could be I bet. Dark black, smells ok, malty. the taste was so malty it was actually sweet and I could not get past it. It was not a bad flavor but I would bet if there were still some hops present this would be more balanced and I'd also bet not as sweet. Oh well."
"I love this porter because it's available locally here in MS where there aren't many good beers to choose from due to the ABV limits. This has become my go to beer for quality and availability"
"Excellent year round beer and actually might be the best porter for the dollar."
"Taste has a jab of piney hops with alot more fruit in the flavor than I anticipated. The malts are more roasty and the chocolate fades away a little bit. I could use more texture...a creamier, fuller body would be great. The finish is quite bitter for a porter and not much in the way of sweetness. This is my third or fourth bomber of this and I have come to the conclusion that it is just not really made for my tastes. I'd give it a go on draft though to see if my feelings change."
"Overall - A really nice, solid porter overall. Worth a buy if you're into porters."
"A tasty porter with good flavour but nothing over the top."
"Notes: This is everything an American porter should be. A perfect beer from one of my favorite breweries."
"D: This beer dethrones Rogue Mocha Porter as my new favorite example of the style, although they do have fairly different flavor profiles. It's addictively simple to enjoy one, two, or more at a time, and it offers substantial flavor and enough complexity that it never gets boring."
"Pours a dark brown, has a foamy brown head that lingers, laces the glass. Seems to be thick in the mouth, has a moderate level of carbonation. Aroma is a roasted bitter chocolate, dark coffee, taste reminds me of caramel and a bit of burnt malts. Drinkability is pretty good, I could go through a few of these. Overall taste and aroma is excellent, this is how a porter should be done. Highly recommended."
"A definitive porter definitely something to stock up on."
"D-this packs in huge flavors, lots of malt sweetness with a dark malt balance. good feel to it, very drinkable and tasty."
"12oz bottle - Black with creamy beige/offwhite, longlasting head. Aroma of roasted malt and walnut shell. This is a great smelling brew. Flavors of semi-sweet chocolate, roasted coffee, and hint of walnut, with bitter hops finish. Solid porter, one of my favorites. I've had this by itself on many occasions, but I tried it with cheesecake and it went surprisingly well."
"D: One of my favorite porters of all time. The flavors are rich and complex but light enough to make this an extremely drinkable beer. One of the best."
"Drinkablity: Very drinkable for the style."
"Anchor porter was like draining used motor oil in a pint glass!! It's almost black. The head is as dark as leather on a well used saddle. It has a rich chocolate smell that makes me skip a second sniff just so I can taste it. There is more licorice than chocolate and an herbal quality that I can't pin down? That herbal taste really lingers on the finish with some hoppy bitterness and a pinch of pepper. I also get some cedar and some smoke flavor. Good beer....I'm not sure when I would drink it. Maybe with some beef brisket and Boston baked beans."
"Drinkability: Dry and somewhat bitter Porter that surprisingly did not overdo the roasted character to accomplish that feat. Just a very smooth, complex and drinkable Porter."
"Overall, a very solid beer. Not extremely drinkable only because it is really sweet. A great desert beer, but not a session beer."
"D= A great porter. Never had it and I heard a ton about it so I went out and got some. Worth the pick up for sure. Porters are my fav and I could sip this one for a while."
"Overall- Very strong entry. I've had porters that are better but I've had many more that are far worse. I like how interesting the profile of this beer is. Overall a solid selection from an American mainstay."
"Very fresh smelling beer. Well balanced aromas; the malt is crisp and clean--chocolate and cream. The hop is subtle but distinct. There is a small touch of yeast, too. Lots of chocolate up front. Hop bitterness comes mid-taste and remains throughout the swallow. Full bodied with high carbonation, this is a rich brew. The aftertaste is largely hop, but sweet carmelized sugar comes through as a balance. The bitterness lingers long after the sweetness dissipates."
"D - I've already put back two. It's a thicker beer with good flavor. However, it doesn't leave a sticky feeling...a clean finish."
"I don't know if brewing so long means that this has been refined over and over or they just hit the nail on the head right away. Either way, I don't care, this is just one damn fine beer. I will call this the one of if not the top American Porter in the land. I will absolutely be getting more of this. Pity it took so long to discover it."
"Pretty sure the average beer drinker is not a proponent of porter and/or stout. This here's a drinker, with a beautiful robust head. Reminded me of Dogfish's Chicory Stout in its pour. The body shouldn't fool you; feels bulky, finishes silky, bit of coffee in the aftertaste. Could easily drink 'em through the night, but would only advise full- or half-blooded Irish to do so. Definitely plan to stock it further."
"D: This is a great beer to drink during winter season. I feel that any porter is difficult to drink in multiples. But Anchor Porter is far superior to many out there."
"I've found in some lesser porters, for instance, that if the body is a little thin, the bite at the end, in contrast, is often more pronounced, caustic and bordering on astringent. Its aftertaste may linger and have a kind of numbing effect on the tongue, snuffing out taste. Anchor, however, has managed to successfully balance out every facet of a porter to perfection. I have found The One (porter)."
"Very easy drinking - worth picking up a 6 pack now and then."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style American Porter."
"Pours a dark brown (almost black) color with a huge light-tan head on it. Smells of hops, light chocolate, and a bit of coffee. The hop smell is stronger than expected. The taste is very delightful. A very nice light taste to it. Initially I get a smokiness/burnt taste, followed by sweet chocolate milk-like taste. There is also a very mellow coffee taste. This beer is EXTREMELY well balanced and the taste is very light, but at the same time it's very flavorful. The mouthfeel is a bit on the light side, but I think that's okay once in awhile. Especially when the weather is as hot as it is right now. The drinkability is VERY high."
"Pours very dark brown; pretty much black. Quite carbonated, foam rises quickly, settles more slowly and leaves islands of lace behind, stuck to the sides of the glass. Smells of cocoa, licorice and rubber. (I'm thinking tires, which I know is kinda weird.) Soft mouthfeel; almost a touch watery. Dark malt flavors dominate; baker's chocolate and licorice, touch of sweeter chocolate. Hops are played way down. Finishes dry with some tannins. A fine porter that makes for a good sessions."
"D One is probably enough... its very concentrated, maybe a good night cap."
"cheers!!"
"Edit on 08/22/2011 only to put an exclamation point to what I posted earlier. I'm admittedly biased. Porter is one of my favorite styles and Anchor Porter may just be the very best."
"Very good porter that I can't believe I've never reviewed this before. Nice dark color. Carbonation is a little bit much, light in color. Great toasty roAsty aroma. Flavor is exactly what you want In a porter. Good dark roast. Not too strong. Great hop balance."
"The beer is a bit on the medium bodied side. Its very nice and almost creamy."
"SERVING TYPE: BOTTLE"
"A pleasant sweet porter, easy to drink, with satisfying aftertaste."
"D - Nice balance between the different flavors present. Bitter, coffee, and mature sensation"
"D - A pleasant sweet porter, easy to drink, with satisfying aftertaste. This one has been added to the cooler's stock list :)"
"Works great to wash down some Cowgirl Creamery Red Hawk washed rind cheese. The porter takes over for a couple seconds, only to have the cheese break back through and play together nicely with the roasty bitterness on your palate."
"Overall this is a very smooth and not overly assertive porter."
"On tap at the brewery in San Francisco. Poured into a small 6 ounce fluted glass. Nice coffee, roasted malt aroma. Really nice malt sweetness behind the toasted flavors from the malts. Perfect mouthfeel and insanely easy to drink. A classic porter on all accounts."
"D-Really easy drinking porter. It strikes a nice balance between the different flavors present. This porter refrains from having that overwhelming roasted malt characteristic, that some do, which is something I don't like in my porters."
"One of the originals and still one of the best American Porters out there."
"D - This is a very easy drinking porter...a nice mouthfeel and lower ABV add to the drinkability...one of my top three porters"
"A quaffable porter. Very effervescent and not heavy on the mouthfeel."
"Pours an almost black color with a dark toffee colored head less than one finger that leaves minimal lacing. At first I noticed mostly coffee, dark chocolate, and roasted malt in the nose, but after a good swirl I got a big dose of liquorish. Very sweet. The taste is a beautiful combination of liquorish, coffee, dark chocolate, and some roasted malt. They blend together perfectly. Couldnt ask for a better mouthfeel or drinkability to this porter."
"D - This is just a damn good Porter. It's got every thing one could want at of the style. This one doesn't have a robust malty flavor profile, just a little bit of everything. Extremely easy drinking, I could have 3-4 of these delicious brews. Highly recommended, I wouldn't mind picking this one up again. Cheers!"
"A solid drinkable porter, one of my favorite American porters thus far."
"Drinkable: extremely drinkable, if you're ok with a slightly sweet, caramel taste. Would definitely seek out again."
"D: A very drinkable porter even with its robust chocolate taste. I really enjoyable beer. This went straight to the top of my list."
"A beer I will definitely considering buying again if I am looking for a good porter."
"D: a bit heavy to drink by the case, but really really good stuff herre."
"Overall Impression: Another solid brew from Anchor! If you like the style, you'll love this beer!"
"Bottle, home. Excellent porter, one of my favorite hometown beers. Anchor Porter pours a very dark shade of brownish ruby, nice highlights in the light, transparent but for the color. The head is big and creamy. The aroma is a mix of chocolate, coffee, roast, plums, molasses, mild booze, some porter ashiness, dates, blackberries, toasted granola. The flavor is smooth and rich. It's intense for the abv with a lot of roast, dark fruits and brown sugar/molasses/caramel. The hops give just enough bite to reign things in. It's one of the best porters around, in my opinion, and it's relatively cheap and well-distributed - a testament to Anchor's success."
"The texture is creamy and smooth. The carbonation that provides the ample head is very subdued, giving a solid finish with a beautifully crafted feel. This is a phenomenal beer. In my estimation, it is close to Edmund Fitzgerald, which before this, had blown every other porter that I have tried out of the water. This is very well done."
"All good porters need to have a strong roasty base, and this one has it. Deep roasted malt and toasted brown toast, vanilla again, and nuts, perhaps chessnuts roasting by the open fire."
"Quite dark with no red edges visible in this light. Attractive, fluffy white head sits atop. Really nice milky, coffee, choco nose with hints of coffe beans and liqorice, really nice. Slight hint of hop presence. Wonderfuly smooth and creamy with more of the same flavours coming through on the palate. Medium bitterness, medium carbonation. Spot on porter I'd like to drink more often."
"Pours like a good porter, coffee black body, thick, healthy beige head. The aroma was definitely dominated by bittersweet chocolate, though you could get some wiffs of roasted malts. However, the taste was more on the malty side. Some bitterness, but then the chocolate flavor somewhat balances it out for a smooth finish. Good amount of thickness, could use a little bit more carbonation though. Not too pricey or heavy, so great drinkability."
"Great porter - very drinkable."
"drinkability: classic porter, not world class but good"
"Poured this into a snifter. Left 1/2"" tan head, not too much lacing that just slides down the glass. Color is very dark with red highlights when held to light. Smell is strong malt and alcohol that has a lot of wine qualities to it. Taste is hugely malty, there's a lot of characteristics of a bourbon barrel aged beer here. I definitely taste some oak. Medium mouthfeel, mild carbonation. This is an excellent example of the style, but it still can't touch the Alpha Klause!"
"Verdict: Anchor Porter is tasty, highly drinkable, and a good example of the American Porter style. While it may not be absolutely bursting with flavor, it's solid and expertly crafted, like every other Anchor beer."
"Dark chocolate brown in the nonic, translucent around the edges with a beautiful two-finger light tan head that clings to the glass. Chocolate, caramel and faint butterscotch aromas waft from the glass. There's a subtle roasty, charred undertone buried beneath the dessert-like scents. It presents a similarly decadent profile to the palate; bold flavors of chocolate, caramel and carob balanced by a roasty bitterness and earthy hop bite. The mouthfeel is creamy and full for the modest ABV, and the finish is pleasantly dry and mildly bitter. I never seem to tire of this one; a microbrew classic."
"D: My first impression of this wasn't very positive, but this is a very drinkable / enjoyable beer. It is flavorful, low ABV, and affordable. Hard to fault."
"This is a very good porter, probably one of my favorites. Drink this at a slow pace and you shall find yourself very relaxed"
"D: this is a solid porter, perhaps a good entry porter for those new to the style. Perhaps my taste buds are fried from all of the imperials I've had, but this beer strikes me as mild. It is however quite drinkable."
"D - A good porter, but not my favourite. I would drink it again, but there are others that I would seek out ahead of this one."
"one of my favorite widely available beers, it's a good medium-bodied, drinkable, dark but mild porter. it's just good and malty, with carbonation keeping things high in the mouth, so it's not sludgy at all. the flavor is brown sugar and rye bread, and as it warms up there are hints of the (what i think of as) woody flavors that anchor brings out more in the christmas beer, for example. this porter pours with a 3-4"" head that maintains coverage throughout its imbibing. i can easily drink a couple 22-oz. bottles of this."
"It has a very smooth creamy mouthfeel and is a really drinkable porter."
"Mouthfeel is very thick and creamy, it's super rich and smooth. Taste is equally tasty. There is a slight hint of iron on the finish, but other than that it's probably the best porter I've ever had. Mouthfeel could be a little thicker, but other than that this is perfect. Nice light coffee finish as well."
"A very good and warming porter for a bad and cold weather."
"Overall a classic porter that is in homage to classic porters before it. Even if this beer was made first in 1974, it can still hang with modern porters and is still better then many new porters."
"d - I'd drink this every day if I could. This could be a world-class beer. Hell, if this beer ran for president, I'd vote for it."
"Notes: This is a solid porter nicely balanced one of the best. Cheers."
"D: Wouldn't kick back more than two of these in a night but it's the perfect after-dinner beer."
"I practically downed the first half of this beer while writing this review without even noticing, so the drinkability is definitely there."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable! complex yet not overpowering. I'd have a hard time drinking these all night, but wouldn't think twice about knocking back a second."
"Overall - I've only had a few porters, but this one is definitely one of my favorites alongside Samuel Smith's Taddy Porter. This is one tasty brew that is not too overpowering on the palate, but also not too weak. I imagine this is a great session beer, but would also love having one of these at the end of a long day to unwind."
"Overall - I loved this beer, very clean and well balanced. Awesome flavors and aromas, I'll have to get more."
"The feel of this beer is medium bodied. Goes down clean and is pretty easy drinking. A truly great porter."
"D - Great subtle complexity and pleasingly rich. A great drink, and an excellent porter."
"d - amazing, a beer with great complexity so you may not want to put down six at a time, but still a very enjoyable beer"
"Drinkability: Not overly strong or thick. Thin enough to guzzle, but thick enough to sip. Quite a tasty porter."
"Genuine Anchor quality. Delicious beer."
"D= 3.5 Pretty high drink ability. It would make for a nice beer before dinner or an early evening beer before a tasting to warm up the palate a bit perhaps."
"PERFECTION. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
"Very very drinkable, this is an excellent porter. I can't believe I haven't tried it before now. This particular batch was bottled in March of 2009 and has not suffered at all for the age, in fact is has some of the same full rounded taste characteristics of an nice aged stout. Definitely recomended, an American classic!"
"D- pretty sessionable once you get acquired to this off-kilter interpretation of a porter; if offered this again i'd probably take it"
"Overall I took about four gulps and the beer was gone. To say it's drinkable is an understatement. Awesome beer."
"taste is tangy, dark chocolate, sour malt, a touch of coffee, and smoke, ends dry and nicely bitter."
"I would recommend giving this a try if you enjoy good dark beer."
"Value: I think this and pretty much every other Anchor product I have seen is an excellent value. At under ten bucks for a sixer, who can complain here? An awesome porter for your money."
"Pours clear brown with subtle hints of ruby red and topped with a clingy, thick, creamy tan head. The head emits bold and sweet coffee aromas which is echoed in the flavor. Sweet and subtle coffee flavors flow quickly through the light body with low carbonation. The finish's flavor is robust coffee flavor and fades very quickly."
"'ve tried several poters and even brewed a few. My mainstay seems to be the Bells Porter and that is my mainstay. This one just didn't seem to stack up . Though drinkable I probably won't have this again. There are better porters to be had and was somewhat dissappointed with this offering out of a 12oz. bottle. A little on the bitter side for a porter and not as smooth as I would have liked..I don't know sorry not everyone can have a Bell's porter on draft but it is great to live in the Midwest where we have access to such great beers!"
"Mouthfeel and drinkability quite nice. Especially for a porter."
"Poured a deep dark almost opaque brown with some ruby highlights. Ample yellowish brown head that laces minimally. Aromas of banana and chocolate malts. Taste is similar with more chocolate. Feel is medium bodied with a slightly oily texture and light creamy carbonation. Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"this is the best porter i've ever had. it begins with the look. dark black with a huge frothy head that almost turns a creamish/pink in certain lights. the smoothest, most complex porter out there. this is a must. if this is your first porter, as it was for me, you've blown it. you'll never find another like this one, everything else will be disappointing."
"T- It has a quite sour aftertaste. Some dark hops with some lemon. Bitter at first, sour after."
"Value: A-"
"D- Very drinkable. This is an enjoyable porter. This would be a nice beer to sesson on a winter night. Well recommended."
" A very nice classic American porter."
"still a good porter but i miss the hops."
"D: I have had this a LOT, trying to resolve my feelings about it and the ratings on this site. Perhaps there is a better porter out there, but not in MY book. And, even though it is from the left coast, it has a reasonable price! Delicious, inexpensive and, with its ABV, it is the beer i buy by the case - ALL the time. Do yourself a favor and go get one right now!"
"Pours pitch black with a two finger tan head that dies down to one finger and retains itself very well. Thick lacing is already left before I even take a sip. The head is nice and creamy. Smells of dark roasted malts, some cocoa and a good amount of hops. A stronger scent would be nice here, but not bad. Taste is basically the same, a good roasted malts and cocoa taste with a generous amount of hops. The hops were a bit too much but as I drink this one it balances out wonderfully. I really like the cocoa aspect of this porter. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, nice carbonation and no warming. A nice coat of hoppy roasted malts is left on the tongue. Very appropriate for this taste. Drinkability is awesome here, the taste and price of this beer rule for the quality of it. The taste holds throughout at least two bottles of this stuff, great porter from anchor. Really like the roasted malt/cocoa aspect here. Also interesting to see a decent hop bill in a porter."
"(My first beer review, Cheers!)"
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. This beer is one of the best looking porters I've had. Deep, dark brown in color with slight lighter brown highlights. This beer produces a darker than average tan head that is very big. It goes away pretty quickly but leaves generous amounts of lacing. While pouring it, it almost has the classic stout nitro effect to it where you can really see the bubbles rising. I was a little dissapointed with the smell, but it's still better than average. You can detect there is a lot to the smell, but it's just not very strong. A bit of a smokey smell, burned malts, and hints of some chocolate and coffee followed by some hops at the end. The taste took a huge jump. Still has quite a bit going on like the smell, but much, much stronger. Very malty, roasted with coffee and chocolate and has a nice hop afteratste. Wonderfully balanced and put together. The mouthfeel is good, it has a good bitter finish from the hop, and the carbonation is perfect, very drinkable."
"D. Very drinkable for a porter. I could see myself having a few. Not as heavy as other stouts and porters that I have tried."
"Pours the darkest of dark browns with a big puffy tan head that is taking its time dissipating. The aroma is of a rich pumpernickle bready malt, light roast and caramel malt. The taste is of a caramelt malt, toffee and very buttery. A roasted malt flavor runs throughout the profile. Very full body with soft carbonation; malty sweet. This is a very thick porter. Too thick in my opinion. Make a beer this thick, call it a stout. Not a big fan of thick porters, especially with this flavor profile, no need. Overall, a big porter with a big caramel/buttery/roasted malt flavor. Too big for the style. I feel porters should be a bit more crisp and refreshing. This is just heavy and buttery."
"drinkability: this is one of the most sessionable beers i have come across in a while. full of flavor, affordable, and not a palate blaster. porter fans should give this one a try."
"D - Rich, but supremely balanced, Anchor Porter is a great beer for slow sipping. Although fine on its own, it begs to be paired with some grilled meat, or a cheese plate. A true classic."
"Summary: For sure one of the better porters I have had, but did not have anything that stood out about it. But maybe thats what made it so good, very drinkable."
"D: I could session this easily."
"Pretty delicious offering, easy to drink, and well worth having."
"Drinakability is great! Goes down nice and smooth and has a great flavor. I'd say this is an outstanding example of the style. Wonderful session beer and I look forward to many more."
"Into a pint glass it poured an opaque brown with a half inch head that faded to a sustainable collar. The aroma was a candy sweet, like toffee, but I had to work hard to get that. The taste was burnt malt, sweet but with a slight sourness in the background. There was a little hop bitterness too, which served to blunt the sour edge a bit. I was unable to perceive any appreciable chocolate flavor. The feel was medium bodied with good carbonation. Drinkability was very good. Not up there with the big boys like Olfabrikken, Red Eye, Founders or Eddy Fitz; but still a very good porter."
"D- extremely flavorful, yet mild enough to go down quickly and effortlessly. an exceptional brew all the way around."
"drinkabilty is exceptional!..I could easily make a night of drinking this!...well done... Bravo!"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle w/ 9UA on the label. Beer poured nearly black w/ a 1/2"" light-tan head. The smell was tight at first, but opened up to a bitter, minerally scent as the beer warmed. Had a faint smell of chocolate and roasted malts. Taste confirmed the roasted smell and chocolate and coffee undertones. The taste was welcoming and got better as the beer warmed. Overall mouthfeel was creamy w/ a clean, crisp finish. Good beer."
"Overall, this is a good porter though I think there are others that I would prefer (I like a little coffee taste in my porters and this does not have any of that). I'm glad I tried it though."
"Amazing that all these years later this still stands with the best American Porters. The benchmark for the style, I'd drink this anytime."
"D: Easy drinking beer, and definitely in the session range, even if it is a little higher up in that spectrum. I would really like to find this beer on tap. Nice beer, I can't believe I've passed it by so much. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Creamy and slick, the texture here is another reason why this porter ranks as one of the benchmarks of the style. The old-world, handmade nature of this beer comes through in all aspects of its presence, and I'm thankful for its availability in the area."
"Nothing overpowering in the smell, but had great body for a lower abv porter. Great malty flavor with roasted barley richness to it. Some bitter flavor, but chocolate, coffee and caramel flavors are mixed up well in this one. A nice drinker, could definitely be a session beer."
"D-This is about as sessionable as a porter can be. This is quite good, coming third behind Black Butte Porter and Samuel Smith's Taddy Porter as my favorite porters."
"A dark and rich porter with a long and malty finish. There is also a good amount of bitterness both up front and in the finish. Very nice smell of chocolate and caramel. Overall a very nice porter. Purchased in New Jersey with batch 6G1 marked on the bottle."
"D: It's been a long time since I've tried one of these; I'm ashamed at how negligent I've been to not have one more often. Terrific flavor and feel + a look that mesmerizes. Among the very best of its kind, definitely worth having occasionally...if not regularly."
"Deep dark brown in color with nice head, retention and lacing. Smell is of dark roasted malts, molasses and dark fruit. Taste follows nose. Quite a different porter - dark roasted malts are there, but the sweet carmel and molassed paired with a dark fruit (fig) flavor sets this apart. Mouthfeel is lighter than expected with good carbonation. Overall a very unique porter with a different flavor profile."
"Drinkability= High. Could put the keg tap in my mouth and just go."
"12 oz bottle to glass. Poured a huge foamy tan head (maybe bad technique on my part). Dark brown to black color. Fruity and malty aromas, sort of bright for such a dark beer. Flavors were solid, sweet on the attack (but didn't really taste like malt?), with a rich coffee and bitter choc finish. Somewhat creamy, the carbonation a bit sronger than I like."
"D: Nice and well balanced. Heavy and light at the same time. Great with a sweet cake."
"Drinkability: this stuff is almost perfect, but for the cumulative effect of the tartness in the beer."
"Drinkability: A decent porter, nice flavours, a smooth feel, culminating in a very drinkable brew."
"The feel of this beer is medium bodied. Goes down clean and is pretty easy drinking. A great beer for people into darker beers."
"This beer is pretty heavy but I will definately pick more up. Great beer before bedtime."
"A very nice looking beer with an attractive light brown-ish head and a deep deep red glow in the light. Smells roasty and dark, almost like a stout. Tastes very robust and flavorful. Hops are definitely present. Finishes a tasty beer, nice to drink from across the country."
"The taste is similar, nicely balanced, full-bodied, but light and drinkable."
"Drink: Very drinkable with nice flavors. There's nothing overwhelming to keep you from having a few of these."
"(D)- What a great porter! Its got the right flavors and superb balance/mouthfeel. This is a porter that I could drink all winter long! Wonderful and creamy to boot. If you are looking for a simple, all around great porter to just sit back and enjoy, then this is it!"
"Drinkability - well it was gone fast but I don't think it's my favorite porter. It's quite good though and I'll pick up another one sometime and compare it side by side with another porter. From what I've read it's a classic American porter and I did enjoy it but I think there might be better ones out there."
"I love a good porter and this one is probably the best I have ever had. This will definately be a beer that I will buy again and again and again..."
"Overall this has to be one my all-time favorite porters. This flavor is so robust, rich, creamy, and smooth at the same time. I got hand it to Anchor on this one."
"Personally: Anchor Porter is not just great, but something that brewers should take note of, a prime example of why craft brewing in America is as great as it is. When you look at the bottle, it appears frivolously austere, serious but unorthodox. The label appears to be from a generation ago, which invites you to taste a brew from a time when craft beer was the only beer available."
"Drinkability: This beer would definetley give alot of the English Porter's I've tried a run for their money. Not only is the aromas right on point, but it's very drinkable and far from bland. Another excellent offering out of the Anchor house, one of the true originators of good American craft beer."
"This is a nice and flavorful, but not exceptional, example of a porter."
"D- overall a nice beer, probably could only have a couple of these but it would be a very nice beer to enjoy almost any time you are in the mood for a relaxing evening."
"D - Very drinkable porter. The dry finish and roasty aftertaste leave you wanting more and more."
"D - Very high, I can't believe I've not had this before, but I will be having it again."
"This porter is highly drinkable, even on a warm summer evening such as today. It's not too dry and the moderate ABV keeps this brew from being too dry for the warmer season."
"This is my first beer review so I am kind of at a loss for things to say. The ultimate test for me when I drink a beer is whether or not I will buy more of the beer. With Anchor, there's no doubt I'll be returning to the store for more."
"D. In my opinion this is better than their flagship beer, and may be more prefereable than their liberty ale (Which is my favorite of theirs beers)This may become my new fav from Anchor. A porter everyone should try"
"D: A good porter but not complex with much more sweetness than most top-notch beers in this style. I like several others much better, but this is a good, solid porter."
"Pouring into a glass, it leaves a small head and has an average Porter smell. It is smooth and everything that a Porter should have (ie. not as heavy as stout but heavier than ale). I enjoy it, but maybe I should try it on a cold evening rather than a summer night."
"D this is one that makes me love porter"
"M/D - smooth, medium bodied, a bit too sweet for me, but overall a nice brew, just not one that I would go to regularly"
"D- Phenolic quality kind of puts me off, but that's just me. Otherwise, not a bad brew."
"cheers"
"D- SOLID porter from anchor brewing company, would love another *gulp*."
"Dark, opaque brown with an epic head of foam. You could stand on this. Dominant aroma is sweet, candylike molasses with a hint of herbal hops underneath. Sour, bitter, fruity, roasty - it's got it all, but well balanced and married flavours. Full, round flavours complement rather than oppose each other, and all against a backdrop of dark, caramelized sugars. Body is smooth and somewhat chewy. Hints of apple sneak through near the end as well. Delicious."
"D - Very tasty and wouldn't mind seeing this in my fridge any day."
"All in all, not a very robust porter, but a great start."
"Notes - A medium bodied porter with a good amount of carbonation."
"Drinkability - Medium. The bottle I opened wasn't quite cold enough, but I suspect the alcohol note would disappear with a chillier temperature, something I plan to test tomorrow. Will update when complete. The bucket o' esters and alcohol note keeps the drinkability lower than some other porters, but overall this is a reasonably mild mannered porter of medium drinkability."
"6oz (shared a 12oz bottle). Poured near black with a creamy tan head. Aromas were roasted malts with hints of cocoa and coffee. Tastes were initially sweeter than expected with a pleasant roasted malt and cocoa up-front followed by a finish of coffee with a slight hop bitterness for balance. Hops were more noticeable than other porters, but the amount used was spot-on for an overall very good representation of the style. Solid porter and one I would drink again and recommend."
"it pours up straight black with a huge frothy tan head. great lacing. the nose is very yeasty, fairly sweet malts, cocoa. the taste is big malts, very crisp, nutty, chocolate, subtle coffee bean, a clean finish, medium to full bodied, medium spritzy carbo. Damnlicious!"
"Beautiful beer to behold and drink."
"I loved this beer and found it a good example of a porter from the US."
"Pours a pretty opaque dark brown, some reddish highlights, thick tan head forms, slowly settles down to a thick ring around the glass, some nice lace chunks stick, good retention. Smell is nice, lots of dark fruit, raisins and prunes, strawberries, caramel, biscuit, light bit of roast but not much for a porter, touch of vanilla and some brown sugar, pretty neat. Taste is similar, very fruity, lots of raisin, dates, dark fruit, cherries/strawberries, some sweet caramel and brown sugar through the middle, maybe a touch of roast in the finish, this reminds me quite a bit of their bock. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, pretty drinkable but definitely not any American porter I've ever had. Still good though."
"Very smooth and drinkability was also very good. Rich mouthfeel and light carbonation. Definitely a beer that I will be drinking again."
"D: Drinks quite easily."
"Notes: Just came back into distribution in Colorado and couldn't want to buy myself a case. I think the head retention could use a little work, and I would prefer the beer to be a little fulller in the mouthfeel, but I'm just splitting hairs. Here you have it, the gold standard for the American Porter. Everything is just so nicely balanced between the roast, malt sweetness and the bitterness. The overwhelming chocolate in the nose is just bliss. I could drink this all day and in any season."
"Drinkability: This is a really nice porter and it would be easy to sit and drink several of them in an evening."
"The king of porters, as far as I'm concerned, is still Deschutes' Black Butte. Tastes great at any temperature, cup or no cup and definitely more worth the price than Anchor's."
"pours deep brown with a 3 finger pillowy head. smell is very metalic and macro. taste is not even close to a porter this is just darker version of the steam beer. mouthfeel is the best thing that this beer has going for it - with a light crisp feel which i feel does not even come close to how this style should be. over all this one of the worst porters ever made. it would be an ok session beer for people looking for a bud ligt of porters"
"D: Very nice. Small enough to be sessionable, but packed with tons of flavor. Highly recommended to all dark beer afficionados."
"I was anxious to try this one since I love porters, but this one just didn't do it for me. Its not bad, but I'd rather have others."
"Pours pitch black, barely brown even held up to the light with thick tan frothy head that leaves good rims of lace. The head thins considerably, but sticks around for the long haul. The aroma is excellent roasted malt that is maybe a little peppery, increasingly sweet as it warms - brown sugar. Rich malty initial flavor that leads to a well balanced bitter aftertaste that has roasted and burnt malt, caramel and a bit of hops. My only complaint is that it occasionally seems slightly medicinal as it warms. The smooth, medium bodied texture is basically perfect. lighter than a stout but not at all watery. The flavor and texture coat the tongue and throat but the finish is dry. This is my favorite american porter, and I am ranking it accordingly."
"Finishes smooth with a slight lingering bitterness."
"Notes: This is a damn fine porter! Probably one of the best that I've had. This used to be an old favorite of mine, but finally being able to review it after having it on-tap was wonderful. Recommended"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Pours a black extremely dark brown color with a one finger tan head that quickly fades away but leaves some lacing down the glass but not much. The smell is sweet and the smell of chocolate comes to mind and caramel. The taste is similar with the chocolate and the sweetness. Has some roasted taste to it as well. I think a hint of coffee is there but it's not very strong. The taste of this one is really good. The mouthfeel is a little above average. Kind of a medium bodied feel to it but not like this needs to be thick or anything. The drinkability of this beer is high. I find myself going through a glass very quickly and wanting to grab another. Overall a great porter, probably one of the best I've had recently."
"D- The hop bitterness of this ale is more evident after the first few sips as it lingers behind in the mouth. That said, this Porter is very drinkable and extremely balanced."
"Prost!"
"Carbonation is but a light tingle, it's just a bit of laced distortion that helps bring this brew together."
"An interesting beer - it seems to carry the steam characteristics from our friends at Anchor into a normal beer style."
"Overall this was a very flavorful porter, and well crafted indeed. It's surprisingly has almost a ""liquor taste."" And the strong licorice notes almost seemed to pull the balance. Has the huge flavor of a Imperial Stout, or Baltic Porter. I see it as an after dinner beer."
"I tried looking for a date on the bottle but could not find one. Well there was a 6 . . T on there, but I don't know what that means. I love Liberty Ale and Anchor Steam, so I am assuming that this might be an old or bad bottle as it didn't taste right. I think I picked this up off a shelf in the back of World Market. I won't be going there for beer again. I'll give this another shot if I see it at a different store."
"D: A very nice Porter, relatively low ABV. If you enjoy Porters, this is a definite must try, easy to enjoy."
"I am not disappointed at all with this one. Very good and satisfying; even ice cold."
"Drinkability: Moderate -- nice and sweet, and the bready flavor is nice, but doesn't keep up with some of the porters that I've sampled, but definitely better than some of the others as well. In terms of taste, it's good and unique, weight is good as well -- filling but not heavy. A great beer overall."
"For my tastes this beer is excellent one at a time but its wine like fruit tastes keep the drinkability down for me."
"M&D: soothing carbonation never turns too high, just in place to back up the delicious, moderate-bodied flavour. All in all, this beer performs slightly better than Sierra Nevada Porter that I had last night, in that an even better balance is demonstrated here, while the slightly chewy, herbal-bitter finish makes the drink an ever-so-quaffable one."
"Drinkability - A high quality beer which is highly drinkable."
"If I was in the mood, I could definitely knock back a bunch of these--it's a pleasure to drink."
"Ordered a bottle at Sibling Rivalry in the South End. Waitress poured into a tall pilsener glass. Not ideal but acceptable. Dark brown color. Smallish white head. Slight smell of cocoa. Smooth coffee flavor present with the first sip, then a bit of maltiness at the back end. Not as thick as other porters I've had recently, but I would not expect that from Anchor. A very drinkable porter, the kind that you would not be afraid to order on a warm evening. A very versatile beer."
"Drinkability- Pretty high for a porter, a sixer of this would be great for a party..."
"The faint flavors prevent the brew from being noteworthy, however, is still pretty enjoyable. I am just left wishing there was more flavor."
"A very nice Porter which I would highly recommend."
"D: Overall, a great porter with very unique flavor profile. I could easily drink a few of these in a sitting especially during dessert. At the price I found it at ($3.99/pint) I will make this a regular buy."
"Very good session Porter, smooth, malty with florals, and has a sweetness throughout all the way to the aftertaste."
"D-Grrreat. Okay, I'm not Tony the Tiger, but this beer is very enjoyable and easy to drink. A great representative of the style."
"Medium body, goes well with the creamy aspects of the beer. Fun to drink, but not delicious. I think Yuengling's porter has more flavor and is a lot cheaper."
"Simply a fantastic beer...words are not necessary, just try it."
"D - A very nice take on the porter style. I could drink this all evening."
"This was one that I decided to take a flyer on one day, and am VERY glad I did. It's a great beer, and I'll surely be getting it again."
"Drink-good beer, above ave porter, great value"
"D: hands down a great example of a porter. Great balance!"
"High drinkability, although they are very filing."
"D: Good, but it is filling. From past unreviewed experiences"
"D- A solid average porter, a nice roasted malt creamy flavour with solid mouthfeel"
"D: Thick and powerful. Filling and flavorful. One of my favorites and an easy recommendation for anyone!"
"D: this is a smooth, rich and satisfying drink. Sign me up. The only thing that has me a bit confused about is the banana. I'm wondering if that is just this bottle, the batch, or the brew...i'll have to buy more to find out :)"
"Summary: Lovely chocolate aroma, very malty taste and hints of dark fruits (probably the yeast). Thick creamy head and very low bitterness and very little hop aroma. Some alcohol bitterness in the finish balances the mouthfeel. I'll definitely buy it again!"
"purs a nice, dark brown color, with a slight dark red color around the edges. 3 finger head, with really nice lacing throughout. First sip i thought this tasted a lot like a wine, its a little dry in the end. And has enough bitterness to balance out the hops but not to be overwhelming. not bad, but i dont think i would drink more than 2 in one sitting due to the dry wine taste i get from it, which maybe how porters are, as this is my first, i didnt know what exactley to expect from this one, eager to try more of this style though."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable for a porter...I could have three or so...While not my favorite style, an excellent example of the style"
"Really good atmosphere. Nice look, and a really well-crafted nose. A little complexity in the flavor, and a hearty feel with a fairly strong alcohol taste, but not imposing at all. Great drinkability when it's all said and done. Really (really) good quaff."
"This is a nice, solid porter. It will be making a regular appearance in my fridge."
"Just had after a Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald, the Anchor has a lot more yeasty fruitiness and comes across sweeter/less roasty. Also doesn't come across as over attenuated, actually seems a little ""creamy"" compared to the GL version (bumped up mouthfeel from 4 -> 4.5). Interesting comparison."
"D-Easy to drink one or two in a sitting very smooth and sessionable"
"Drinkability- very good. Wouldn't have any trouble sending another one down to keep this one company. Good thing it came in a six pack, is all I can say."
"Very drinkable - a great buy."
"This is a very drinkable beer that feels like home-- maybe because it comes from a place that's close to home..."
"I am a definite fan of Anchor. This porter was sweet and thick, though not syrupy, and it was balanced quite nicely with enough hops to be sensible. This little bottle entertains from the moment you pick it up off the shelf, throughout the pour of its sensuous black contents to the finish of this pleasantly thick beer down your throat. Great beer"
"I purchased a six pack while TDY at another base and sincerely regret not purchasing more, this was one of many Beers that I selected that are not available here."
"Great taste. Thick, rich, creamy. Weak coffee taste, smooth bittersweet, with some roasty malt flavor. Terrific balance. This is one solid brew. Superb drinkability."
"As porters go, this is one I would drink again."
"Overall this is a very good porter and I look forward to revisiting it in the future. Give this a try."
"Very mild, balanced, and drinkable, this would make a superb session beer and is a great example, if not the definitive, of the style."
"Great porter. Pretty much sets the standard for American version of the style."
"(D) A fantastic porter. A good beer to introduce / ease ""light"" beer drinkers into."
" Smells like coffee and a bit of fruit. Maybe dark cherries. Tastes exactly like porter should taste. Roasted toasted smoked roastiness. My god, this is good. A bit lower in alcohol than what i've been drinking lately, but at least it goes down easier. Superb drinkability. This may be my new session beer."
"Overall. The mouth feel is coating with a touch of astringent. The finish is slightly bitter and dry. The body of the beer is medium thickness. This is a robust heavy malt ale that is smooth and easy to drink. A very nice robust American porter. I enjoyed this beer very much."
"D - a very good flavorful porter that's very easy to drink."
"Drinkability: All of the malt makes this a pretty filling porter, but it's still delicious and great for a rainy day."
"One of the most middle of the road Porters I have ever had. Anchor continues to disappoint me."
"This is an inviting beer to please the palate. It is a well structured body, but it does not test you. It is a fine and smooth porter that has a heavy mouthfeel that is backed with a quick kick of alcohol. Let it sit; do not drink it cold. This porter must mellow; let it and you will savor a wonderful quaff."
"Pours a very dark brown with an average light brown head . Aroma is roasty, and sweet.Flavor is sweet caramel and banana with hints of molasses and caramel. The finish is dry and quite bitter. The body feels pretty full, sticky mouthfeel would have liked a little more carbonation. A very good porter that I will buy again for sure."
"D - Oh man... this is a great porter. Easy to drink and so so delicious... Will definitely be having again."
"M/D - Very full bodied and creamy. Easy sipping with a good level of carbonation without being overwhelming."
"D- Good drinkability for a porter"
"A very good porter that includes all the essential flavors well."
"Very drinkable, session beer. A somewhat simple porter though. Nothing fancy, good but would not be my first choice for a porter"
"Mouth feel: Smooth and refreshing. Low carbonation and no too viscous."
"Maybe I got a bad bottle or something. Maybe I should try this again..."
"Was able to stumble upon this at a local store, haven't seen it anywhere else. So glad I picked some up because this is one helluva porter. Black pour, nice brown head and decent lacing. Bitter-sweet scent, nice roasted malt nose. Incredibly thick and smooth, outstanding on the palate to say the least. Lots of roasted malt with plenty of chocolate and mild coffee flavors mixed with just the right amount of hops. This is a beautiful beer."
"This was better on the Anchor tour in SF, not sure if it was just fresh or maybe just in my head. I'm not unwilling to admit that the atmosphere may have played a part. A compliment is that it portrays character that usually needs a higher abv."
"Great drinking Porter. Easy to knock down two or three at a time."
"3.0/5"
"This beer pours a thick black with a two finger dark tan head that sticks around for a while and leaves a bit 'o lacing on the glass. Smell is, surprisingly, of ripe fruits up front (strawberries, raspberries) with some coffee and subtle chocolaty notes in the background. Up front, again, the fruity, caramelly-sweet fruits hit your palate and fade into a nice chocolatey, espresso finish with a touch of bitterness from the hops on the linger. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy with a ton of crisp carbonation on the back end which makes the finish quite clean. A very good porter - definitely the best of Anchor I have tried so far. Very drinkable, I highly recommend this one."
"(rated Feb 2, 2007)"
"I'd certainly put this on tap at home - I could drink it for a while in the winter."
"Drinkability: One of my favorite porters this is definately what a porter should be."
"Looks like the the English win this bout of the porters. But I would give Anchor porter another shot, maybe this bottle I have here is a bit old, but I can't tell."
"D - This is a good porter didn't blow me away but its still a tasty beverage worth trying sometime"
"Why does Anchor feature its pedestrian steam beer when everything else they make is excellent? Pours deep brown with a short tan head. Coffee, cocoa, roasty malts, hazelnut, and musty wood. Excellent, creamy mouthfeel. Rich chocolate, coffee, and malt throughout with nuts, barley, and a tiny bit of smoke. Delicious."
"D- This is an ok porter, but I was pretty let down. Because of the carbonation problems, I can't see this being terribly drinkable."
"Very drinkable although perhaps the smokey characteristics might make it a bit too much to make this a session beer. All in all a very good porter, however and I would definitely have more than one in a night!"
"D - A little high on the alcohol level but not enough to make me turn away. Love it."
"D: This is by far a porter from beginning to end, there is no disquising this. The uniqueness of the flavor is the crispness and overall lightness. This is a porter that could end up being a devoured six-pack before you know it. By far my favorite porter on the planet."
"Overall, this is an excellent porter. Great to the style, a nice honey and carmel taste makes this a great brew!"
"D - Of the Porters are distributed in La., this one is definitely my favorite, the taste and body was everything I love about the style, and it makes a great sessionable beer"
"The finish was not as full as other porters."
"Cheers..."
"D: Overall a good drinkable session porter."
"Feels thick and chewy. If I didn't know better, I'd think it was a Scotch ale. Really somethin'."
"Notes from 09/17/04."
"Great flavor to this porter--powdered chocolate nibs mixed with raisin rum and sweetbread. Hops chime in for a lingering, bitter finish that coincides with some roasted chocolate and dark coffee notes. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy with a gentle carbonation level that pairs nicely with the medium thickness. However, a bit of chalkiness lingers in the body, which gets a bit distracting. Still, Anchor Porter is a classic and well-crafted brew that I'd enjoy purchasing again."
"Excellent mouthfeel, with almost perfect drinkabilty, save for the heaviness. I like this porter. I would get again, and again, and again..."
"Very nice and quite unique. Lots of deeply roasted caramel malt flavor along with raisins, chocolate, and coffee. It has a nice sweet aroma and bittersweet chocolate finish as well. This is a great example of a porter in appearance as well as taste and smell; I would drink one of these anytime."
"Anchor Porter is probably my favorite of the style that I've had thus far. Not that I'm particularly experienced in the style having only had a handful of others before this one. However, at $11/6 it is a little pricey. One taste reveals why, so this one is well worth the purchase price."
"Anchor Porter may be a staple in America's craft brewing history but it tastes far more like something out of the Baltic region. Although it may be responsible for introducing (and popularizing) the style in the new world, it pales just a little in comparison to some of the offerings that have spawned in its image. That said, it's always a pleasure to drink."
"Porters happen to be my favorite style, and this one really sings. Currently my number one choice, thank you Anchor!!"
"The drink is silky, creamy, and in the lighter end of the full-bodied spectrum. Light carbonation and great drinkability"
"very nice to drink could have a few of these watching a game"
"Pours a dark black-brown colored body, with a big light brown head. Good lacing. Dark heavy aroma, with chocolate and some alcohol. Chocolately roasted taste, and some alcohol. Soft mouthfeel, fizzy. Somewhat acidic with meat pizza. An okay porter."
"Of all the American porters I tried, this one seems the most traditional, more Samuel Smith than Sixpoint. Very focused, and solid and smooth, on the grain. Maybe because it's older--is this the oldest porter America has that's still in circulation? In any event, it has the feel of a standard-bearer, the one to measure others in the style against."
"This is simply the best porter I have had yet. It makes me interested in finding other porters to enjoy. I could definitely drink a few of these."
"Drinkability is definitely high on this one. Every time I revisit it, I wonder why I don't buy it more. A bit lighter in flavor than some with a fairly traditional flavor profile, but it's done well. The mouthfeel is spot on, and this is just a flat out delicious porter that I could drink all day long."
"On tap at the brewery. Deep brown but clearly not black. Tan frothy head with some decent lacing. Fruity chocolate cordial aroma. Flavor is chocolate malt balls with a hint of red fruit and a nice roasty bitter finish. Light bodied and smooth, very drinkable. A porter with no frills, just quality."
"Mouthfeel is medium and comes off moderately carbonated. Very drinkable. A great beer to have around as fall has settled in and winter begins knocking at the door."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: A nice balance of subtle flavors with a very smooth, inviting mouthfeel make this a very good porter."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a dark coal color with a fat chocolate head that leaves nice lacing on the sides of the glass. The smell is full of robust malts and some deep notes of coffee and chocolate. The flavor is full bodied and full of chocolate and balanced well with mild hops. This brew has a wonderful mouthfeel and the aftertaste is mildly sweet. This is an excellent example of a strong porter."
"D: A lovely porter. A little too much carbonation for my taste and the aftertaste was a little too burnt for my liking. Not taking away from the quality of this brew - really awesome and I'd be happy to have one anytime."
"uh... this is too good... this might cure hernias, it might also make you immune to your boss, and is definitely the thing to drink directly after any incident involving a significant loss of blood"
"D - Another highly drinkable porter, I could easily see drinking a few of these during a cold winters evening with friends. However, at $10.00 a six it's much more expensive and not nearly as good as Deschutes Black Butte Porter. Unfortunately, I can only get that back out west, so I guess I'm stuck with this porter here. Still a great porter, just not a steal..."
"I'm still new to reviewing beer but not to drinking it. Also, I haven't had a lot of porters. There was a lot of carbonation when I poured the bottle into a glass. After it settled down, I was a little dissapointed; not that it wasn't good but not an exceptoinal taste in my opinion. There is a dark richness, maybe some coffee undertones, but the finish was a bit on the bitter side which I wasn't expecting. It's not that I don't like bitter as I am partial to IPA's, but it seems to outweigh the dark rich, complexity I was hoping for. Still, a very nice, drinkable beer."
"Their Be Pirates after that Beer!"
"Overall, the mouthfeel was a bit light for the style, but not a bad porter by any means."
"Delicious!"
"Anchor Porter poured a nice dark brown, appearing black. Ok head as well. Smell seemed a bit faint. Hints of chocolate. Taste was very good. Coffee up front, followed by hints of chocolate. Mouthfeel was good as was the drinkability. This was a very nice porter, full flavored but easy to drink."
"This stuff goes down smooth and is probably the most drinkable porter I've had to date. I definitely waited far too long to grab this stuff again. Great beer."
"The third entry in my American Porter taste test (I'm editing in 2015) is one I've had (and rated) before--way back in 2008.  Here's the earlier note, edited for my latest tasting:   I'm on a bit of a porter run lately, ever since someone (thanks CB!) left one in the fridge. So I dug a bit deeper into the BA recommendations and pulled Anchor Porter off the list (since I knew I could find it here). The reviews mentioned a definite hops presence... something I had not yet tasted in a porter. So I bought some and tried it. Definitely different--unique (in a good way)--and drinkable. A tiny bit more carbonation than normally seen in a porter and helps bring out the flavor, IMHO. Deep brown (to black, with red/mahogany highlights) in the glass with a massive head of tan foam (like its Steam Beer cousin) that provided a nice lacing throughout. Roasted (without being smoky) malt in the nose and initial taste, but the fruity hops flavor kicks in almost immediately and really softens the smoky roasted flavor. It's like two beers in one. And the rich flavor of the porter is perfectly balanced. Very enjoyable. Very drinkable. Another ""hit"" on my list thanks to the recommendations from BA."
"O- It is in the upper realm of drinkability for porters. Its smoothness and good taste made it a beer, that while maybe not a session beer, would still merit the opening of another."
"This beer pours a very dark brown color. The head is a beautiful color that left lacing down the glass. The aroma is toffee, sweet fruit, with a hint of coffee from the dark roasted malt. Smooth on the palate with nice medium mouth feel. Coffee, chocolate, and dark fruit with some broad slightly biting malt underlying it all. Hops provide some pleasing balance without being overwhelming. Dry in the finish, drinkable, complex and tasty. One of the best porters I have had lately."
"3	D struck me as boring but competent. will try again sometime and see if maybe i missed something."
"I'm not a huge fan of Porters, but I truely like Anchor's Porter. This is a really good beer regardless of genre. This is a world class porter."
"Go out and buy one...now!"
"Drinkablity: Tasty and drinkable porter. Deep flavors make this a good example of the American interpretation of the style."
"Overall a very well balanced and well made beer. I have never been big fan of porters and stouts but as I stated earlier I took a tour of Anchor and sampled their beers. Other than their lager and ale, Anchor's beers are on the dark side-bock, porter, barleywine-and I have never been one to turn down a beer. Needless to say I am now a fan of the darker beers."
"D-One of the best Porters I can remember tasting."
"D= This porter is a chameleon. Just when I would describe this as a typical example, the unique yeast flavors kick in and the nearly stout-like creaminess forces me to reconsider. All in all, a damn fine porter that can hold its own."
"Poured into a shaker pint glass, this beer is darker than opaque, topped with a big head that leaves lots of lacing on the glass. As I put the beer into my mouth, I knew this was going to be good. Very smooth and inviting in the mouth, medium bodied. The flavor lacks in diversity, but who cares? This is delicious! Semi-sweet chocolate chips with a bit of molasses clinging to them. It ends with a kiss of hops at the end. This beer is easily drinkable and addictiing; don't order by the pint, order by the pitcher!"
"D. An Excellent beer. This is a meal beer, that isn't sipped casually but almost chewed on. The ABV may make you think it is almost a session brew, but it gives a happy full feeling even after one bottle."
"Nice medium body with decent carbonation that keeps this beer feeling light and very drinkable. This came from a bomber, and I easily could have put another away. Absolute dynamite."
"A very good beer, I was not dissapionted. Now just to try it with different foods."
"Drink ability= Every one else may drink Guinness on Saint Patties, but give me a real porter any day, and I think this particular one is a wonderful representation of the American style. People forget that Anchor brewing isn't Old school; there just old, and I like it that way."
"Pours a nice black with red/coppery tints and a nice light tan head, with some great fluff. Nose is the weakpoint here, as it is a bit too coppery and lacking in significant roast or toast. Taste is quite good. Some roast, a nice vanillaish presence. A little coppery flavor is present. some dark sugar in there as well. Mouthfeel is slightly thin, but quite good. Not the most drinkable porter, but more than makes up for it in taste. Dont get me wrong here though. drinking a few of these is no problem! Good beer, and a fine example for the style standards."
"A good beer. The hints of honey reminded me of how good Sam Adams Honey Porter actually is. They'll end up tying for score, but I might give a slight nod to that one. This is still a beer I'll buy again, but drinkability suffers a little from how heavy this beer sits in my stomach. After the first bottle, I started to forget how full-flavored this really is. A bomber would be just about the right serving. A good choice for fans of sweeter porters. This bottle was about 5 months old, so maybe fresher ones pack a little more bitterness."
"The beer pretty much tastes exactly how it smells, and it's great. It's complex with a complexity of chocolate and sweetness. I enjoy all the flavours and one can taste and focus on each of the flavours. Such a tasty beer and something I can drink over and over again. This is exactly what a porter should be. The mouthfeel is creamy and a bit thick and has a decent amount of carbonation."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Great flavors makes for easy consumption, low alcohol only furthers this beers ability. Could drink them all night."
"Black, black, black! Well, maybe it has some ruby around the edges, but it's about the blackest beer I've had next to Old Engine Oil. Has a lovely dense, wheat-bread-brown head that releases an aroma of chocolate, molasses, coffee. All these are present in the taste, along with a pleasantly bitter roastiness that surrounds everything from beginning to end, but is not overwhelming. Also has a somewhat thick texture that feels very friendly going down. A nice find-- I only know Anchor for Anchor Steam, but this is one of the best porters I've ever had."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a very dark brown with mocha hints on the edges. Head was a dirty white that was foamy, clung very well, and left a nice layer on top for the whole bottle. Aroma was slightly sweet, reminded me of fresh banana bread. Taste was brown sugar with a bit of bitter stale wheat bread. Consistency was very good in the mouth, coated extremely well and nicely carbonated. Fairly easy to drink but not one to rush."
"Extremely drinkable beer. I love it-- definitely one of my favorite porters to date."
"You know, it's not the best executed brew, but it's very enjoyable... maybe the most drinkable Porter/Stout I've ever tried. I suspect they either shorted us on the boil, rendering a less complex wort, or the pale malts used far outweigh the dark malts I desired and expected from my eyes and nose. Put it this way: a great 6-er or 12, not the best bomber. Understand!?"
"Pours a deep opaque brown with a rocky light tan head. Aroma screams SOY SAUCE!!!! There's hints of cocoa and coffee also. Be warned though it's very smokey (Soy Sauce). Very lively carbonation and heavy mouthfeel. Taste is much less soy saucy and more on the roasted grain/coffee side with very little bitterness. Not that complex but not a bad choice. Don't try it if you don't like smokey beers."
"Mouthfeel is thin and watery. I have five more of these to get through. Ugh."
"D - Excellent... A tremendous porter..."
"Overall- I'd drink it again, but I wouldn't really seek it out."
"Not session type,but who cares."
"Poured into a Lukas Liquor pint glass. Beautiful tan head on top of a very dark body - virtually no lacing on the glass as it is consumed. There is a nice sweetness to this beer, balanced with a smokiness. I could imagine drinking several of these back to back without getting too full. Good porter."
"This is probably the best Porter that I have had to date. I can easily drink a few of these in a sitting."
"Pours black with some brown streaks when put to the light. A thinnish one and half finger dark tan head chills out for a good bit before settling down and leaving very little lacing behind. Burnt malts, caramel, sweet bread and spice rise to the nose all robust and complex. Tastes malty with a little bit of the burnt essence around the edges. Yeasts and some bitterness float somewhere in the middle. A caramel and toffee sweetness comes in at the right time with an nice little hint of cherries bringing things full circle. Mouth-feel is medium to full bodied with some smooth creaminess going down. Full on excellent porter."
"I'll be adding this one to my list of favorites."
"A nice enough porter. Deep chocolate brown, creamy head. Definitely quite well hopped. Taste is dominated by piney bitterness on top of some coffee flavors. Nose is roasty with a very pleasant hop aroma. Smooth and nice to drink. Solid, if a bit over-rated."
"at first there is a bitterness to it but it fades very quickly and turns into a nice mild sweet flavor. pretty decent and drinkable."
"I highly recommend this porter as an easy drinking yet flavorable ale."
"No surprise that many consider this a standard for the style. I'm glad I finally got ahold of a bottle."
"Near-opaque brown with some reddish tinge. Long lasting, fine tan lace. Toasty, coffee nose with hints of grass and earth. Begins with huge, earthy/coffee/chocolate flavors that turn rich and slightly citric towards the back. Fresh, leafy hops are present just enough to set off the roasted grain. Long, leafy hop finish with plenty of roasty flavors lingering. Fine carbonation lends a smooth, round mouthfeel to the full body. Complex from start to finish, this is the standard for american porters."
"We will be able to enjoy this brew for a good while here in Sweden since it is now a part of the permanent stock of the government run liquor stores."
"At first, I wasn't sure if I liked this but I have to say that it began to floor me about halfway in and it warmed a bit. Tasty, tasty, tasty..."
"12 oz bottle into imp pint. Nice tan, tight head poured onto dark brown with ruby highlights. Smells of coffee and chocolate- and malt. Tastes of bitter/ smoothe chocolate. Can taste the roasted malt. Great feel in the mouth and very easy to drink. I haven't had too many American porters, but I think of it as the American Fullers- different but very good and very consistent."
"D: This is a drinkable beer, arguably the best one Anchor makes. Like other porters, it's a heavy beer, but still very tasty."
"Drinkability is good, I only had one of these that I was gifted with but as soon as I find more I'll be buying it. Would be excellent with a steak."
"D - Simply put, a very drinkable, delicious porter. Not too heavy. Definitely a porter I will revisit in the future."
"D: A very drinkable porter. Has a love ABV that makes this easy to consume and quite tasty. Will purchase as a go to beer."
"D: a good beer. in my opinion not a session beer. but a good beer nonetheless that I will probably have again in the future."
"The Anchor Porter pours an extremely dark, literally almost black with a tan head. The head receded relatively quickly, but never fully disappeared. The scent of chocolate was not a tease. This beer has a nice full body, chocolate taste to it. It's a bit more on the filling side, but went down very smooth."
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black. Has a lively medium brown head. Smells earthy. The taste is very chocolaty, that was the first thing I thought when I took a sip. This beer is also sweeter than I imagined. There is, however, a good amount of roasted flavor and hop bitterness to help balance the sweetness. At the end there is a taste of raw hops, quite pleasant. Mouthfeel is slightly thinner than I would have expected considering the taste, but nothing bad. Quite drinkable too, this is quite a tasty Porter from Anchor! I would definitely buy it again."
"D: Quite the drinkable porter. Low ABV makes it easily sessionable, but it does sit a little heavy in the stomach (but hey, it's a porter). I'll definitely be getting this again."
"D - Nice brew to have around if you dig darker brews; doesnt pack too much alcohol: a classic."
"D. Solid brew here. Anchor makes some really good beer. This is an example of such."
"D: very drinkable, but not outstanding. A good representation of style, but I think I need a fresher bottle next time."
"Tried it with a gouda cheese. I would probably try it with a more aged or smoked gouda."
"Pours pitch black with dense head and great lacing. Smell: dark chocolate, dark fruit. Taste: starts sweet, fruity, gives way to astringent grain, unsweet chocolate and roasted flavors. Hops sneak up through the malts, spicy and herbal. Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and creamy. A very good porter."
"D: Pretty nice drinkability for a porter. Could drink a couple."
"Drinkability: This is a good drinking porter. It's not overbearing on the palette, but has just enough flavor in just the right amounts. I really like this. This is something I could sit around and watch Animal Planet a few hours with."
"Pours a deep brown/black color with a medium sized medium bodied head that fades nicely to a ring around the glass. It laces a little down the glass on the way down. Once it has setteled it is one nice looking porter. The aroma is of really deep roasted malts underneath smells of dark fruits, chocolate, and caramel with a touch of hops at the end. The taste is just that way. Nice sweet and bitter roasted malts underneath a chocolate, caramel, and dark fruity taste with a tough of hops to finish off the flavor. Really nice. The mouthfeel is soft, smooth, and really warming which makes it an excellent porter. Definately one of my favorites."
"If you like porters you must try this one."
"An extremely smooth drinker. Think of it as a less aggressive version of the Storm King Stout."
"By far my favorite anchor beer among many great ones. Go git you some."
"Wow, What an exceptional beer from such a respectable, historical brewery. Being a Porter fanatic, I tend to be extra critical. Anchor's Porter exceeded my expectations. A dark Opaque and black body with a very bubbly aromatic head. smells of caramel and toffee lead into a strong bittersweet flavor, definitely attacks the back of the tongue. Excellent carbonation, doesn't give you that gassy feeling. I could drink this porter all day. Good job Anchor!"
"all in all, a nice brew."
"The taste is the closer on this deal. Very balance. Caramel, malt, sweet with a hint of coffee thrown in. The key here is the balance; just the right bitterness. So easy to drink. Not strong. Not watery. This is a truly great porter and a truly great beer. I can only say this of one other porter I have had."
"Drinkability: where many porters can be rather acrid, this one is relatively smooth. Flavors are not contentious, but meld together nicely."
"good drinkability. it's a pleasant easy drinking porter without anything to severe going on."
"With a dark subtle body and a nose of caramel and toffee, this porter is seductively simple and delicious. Initial taste of chocolate with subtle notes of cinamon, followed by toffee, maple syrup and coffee that wash over the back of your tongue like milk. As you swallow the hop bitterness starts to stand out and the tingly sensation of carbonation dances across your tongue."
"D: So good, I would like another. Ok, I think I will."
"Drinkability: Excellent, I love porter and this is one of the best I've had. I could drink this all night."
"pours black in color with a one finger tight bubbled tan head that holds for a while and rings of lace with each sip. fruity aromas of dark fruits and slightly burnt roasted malts in the nose. lots of roasted malt with figs and dried prunes and brown sugar, nothing that over powers you very balanced. medium body and very smooth with good carbonation. its at the top of my list."
"MF&D - Sticky and delicious. Just the right amount of carbonation and alcohol content to keep the porter balanced. I wouldn't think Anchor Porter would make a good session beer, but it is great cold weather brew. I would buy this product again and again."
"M & D: I feel this is a bit thin. I wanted more body, more malt to go with that great dark quality. The strength (alcohol) seemed like a stout, so maybe I just wanted oatmeal stout at the time. This is definitely a drinkable beer, I'll have it again, but I was expecting more for some reason."
"The overall drinkability is above average although I couldn't see myself drinking more than a six pack at one sitting. Definitely a good winter beer. Would go great with a stew, pot-pie or any heavy winter meal. Overall one of the better American porters I have tasted."
"Drinkability - What a damn fine porter! A great example of the style, and so easy to drink."
"d - my second anchor beer and yet again it just seems like a simple yet spot on representation of the style. It's nothing too crazy, just great. It's well balanced in taste and in feel. I'll be sure to get this one again."
"A stunning porter. The beer poured with a beautiful deep black body and a big chocolate-milk colored head. It smelled of rich, sweet malts with a hint of hops. The taste is very powerful, a huge mix of sweet malt, plum, coffee, chocolate, and toffee, the hops barely keep pace and provide a pleasing bitter aftertaste. It was very drinkable, this could become my go-to porter."
"A fine porter."
"A very tasty porter with a unique smell and taste; probably not my favorite of all time, but it is nice to have this variation in style that makes it stand apart from all the others"
"Highly recommended."
"D - A really good porter. Easy to drink, and has a nice hoppy bite with a slight chocolate sweetness. Very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: I have to admit, this being the first Anchor Porter I've had, I was not expecting this type of flavor from a porter. That being said....I loved it! The balance of the true to character maltiness with the added fruityness and molasses flavors really impressed me. I'm on #1 now....but I can promise you this 6 pack won't last long. I'll be making this a staple in the beer fridge!"
"Beautiful black color when poured into glass. And the aroma is very mild. Enjoyed this on a really cold night and I couldn't have picked a better porter. I could be wrong, but this porter was almost sweet. Good meal in a glass."
"D: It is a simple and easy to drink beer that due to its moderate profile and low ABV would make an acceptable session brew."
"Eric"
"The smoothest porter I've ever had. Very enjoyable. The taste and smell aren't that distinctive, but it's a very smooth, enjoyable drink."
"d: Wow! Nothing against Anchor, but I wasn't expecting anything out of the ordinary from their porter. But this, this is a very good porter. Terrific flavor, great smoothness, supreme drinkability. A great brew. My only question is why, with this being sold in every liquor store, am I just now trying this?"
"D - perhaps the best porter I've had."
"Excellent opaque coloring with a great tan head and excellent lacing. It has a very nice scent, a deep aroma with hints of coffee and bourbon. Excellent porter taste, a nice dark beer with good coffee/burnt grain flavors. Very smooth, and very drinkable."
"Now THAT'S a winter evening to look forward to!"
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: In the mouth this beer is full bodied, smooth, creamy....well it feels just as it looks! It has a bit of a drying quality to it that I'm associating with the burnt grains/roasted grain bitterness. Once that flavor hits as one is swallowing it, it seems to lend a drying character to the beer. This is one beer that I'll definitely be buying again, perfectly suited for cooler-cold weather.... fantastic beer nonetheless."
"D - Solid Porter all the way around. I'm glad I have two left! This does remind me of SN Porter a lot, another great brew."
"Dark black with barely a red edge and a thick bread loaf of tan head on top sticking to the glass. A rich spicy aroma of hops comes out of this beer. Kind of reminds me of their christmas offering as far as the smell. Drinking this beer blows me away. It has an exceptional flavor of roasted malt with just the right touch of hops for me to get a good balance. The hops linger after finishing the beer, leaving a woody flavor on my palate. Good/appropriate mouthfeel, and I could really drink this beer all night and not tire of it."
"Drinkability- A very balanced, drinkable beer. Not too heavy which is good, not overpoweringly sweet either, worth a try."
"This could be better carbonated, though it is no slouch. Yet that doesn't change the fact that Anchor Porter has created a terrific, flavorful, easy-to-consume porter that ranks well with its American contemporaries. Not the top porter I've had, but well worth trying and enjoying."
"d: so simple yet so delicious; well-balanced and near perfect"
"What more can one add here. The beer pours a thick, chewy, very dark roasted color with some reddish hints if held up to the light. The head is modest but a nice brown and it does retain and lace around the edges. The smell is delightful. This is sweet biscuity malts, chocolate, molasses, and caramel. The consistency is medium bodied, very creamy, and modestly carbonated. The carbonation is just right in that it's not over the top, nor flat. The taste is good, but I will part company a little with many of the reviewers in that the hoppy and almost citric bite detracts from the dextrin sweetness of the malts and the chocolate and caramel flavors. There might be some fig or apricot (what I call heavy fruit) flavors but only a tinge. The chocolate comes through as things settle a bit. The beer could be considered balanced, but there may be just too much hoppiness in there for what I was expecting. The taste is a small let down from the wonderful aroma of the beer. As for aftertaste, this is quite mild and the drinkability factor is good. One could have quite a few of these without worry. The ABV is light enough that you could indulge."
"This is an excellent hop-forward porter which still maintains an excellent balance. In the craze for the extreme and new classics like this should not be overlooked."
"For a beer style flooded with excellent examples the Anchor Porter is truly one that stands out."
"Overall: A world class Porter! I have tasted other Porters and this is, without a doubt, one of the best Porters, if not the best, in the world."
"D - Very good, this is an impressive porter and a sure bet. Definite recommendation here, can't wait to restock."
"Yet another high-quality offering from the Anchor company."
"Overall an incredibly good porter. I dould drink several of these and never grow tired of the aromas and flavors."
"Pours a nice thick head that's tannish but almost brown. It's a rocky head with not much lace. The color is almost black with a little ruby when held up to the light. The taste though is fantastic. Not burnt and almost chocolate like. A slight bitterness without being in the way. Almost like a light coffee-ish stout.Very sweet and overall, the best porter I've had in a long time. Highly recommeded."
"Poured a very dark brown in color with some ruby highlights at the edges when held to the light. About a finger of light brown head with a bit of lacing. Aroma was mostly of roasted malts, namely chocolate and a touch of black patent. Hop aroma was negligible and covered by the maltiness of this brew. Taste was good, chocolate, a touch of caramel, some burnt malts, dark fruits, and some subdued hoppyness. Mouthfeel was good, medium-ish body and carbonation. Drinkability was quite good, i really enjoyed this brew. No major faults, just a solid porter that I might use as a benchmark from now on."
" These are quite drinkable. Not heavy or too meaty to drink a bunch of."
"Lasting beige head on pour. Sweet, alcohol, and roasty malty smells with faint caramel. Nice hearty full flavored sweet roastiness up front followed by good bitterness, and medium length afteratse. Good amount of carbonation keeps it from feeling overly milky, and heavy, and it isnt overly sweet either. A delicious porter. Would recommend."
"D - Extremely delicious and sweet, the favors and carbonation compliment each other perfectly. One of the best American Porters on the market."
"Pours extremely dark brown with very little ruby light coming through with a one inch tan head that drops after a short while. Nose is malty sweet, but not very strong in statement. Flavor is robust and matured with slight chocolate and coffee tones...though I think I am drinking this too cold. It is definitely better as it warms. Mouthfeel is thick with a good carbonation and bubbly feeling. Highly drinkable. Could go for this one again, and again, and again."
"Pours a deep, dark, opaque chocolate color with a minimal frothy head... smell is of burnt, dark chocolate and cocoa... Taste strongly complements the aroma, with a cocoa-chocolate flavor that dominates the palate... slightly bitter after-taste is somewhat of a turn-off, and the bitterness tends to a linger for a bit after the first sip... very rich, thick and sweet, with a good mouthfeel, but due to the thickness of the brew, an average drinkability.. wouldn't want to down more than two in a single setting... a decent rendition from the famous Anchor microbrewery, but overall, nothing to write home about... A decenet brew, but not too sure if I'd give two thumbs up to recommend it..."
"Excellent beer from Anchor. Along with the old foghorn and liberty ale, my favorite beer from Anchor."
"D- A good session beer for those who like to walk on the dark side. A classic example of American Porter."
"Anchor brews are a staple in my brewshed... not so much the porter because I don't buy alot of them.. but this is a very nice... maybe ""MY"" benchmark porter. Now Anchor just needs to make sure Old Foghorn makes it back to Boise."
"This is a very good beer, just be sure you let it warm a bit for the full effect."
"Poured a 12oz bottle in a Chimay Chalice. Poured a darker brown than I expected with a large 2 inch tan head. Left minimal lacing. Smell is of roasted malts and coffee. Taste is pretty much the same except for a lingering taste of dark chocolate. Mouthfeel was a bit thin for the style I thought, but it made for a very sessionable beer."
"This beer poured a very dark brown with a big fluffy three-finger tan head. The smell is a very malty with just a little bit of coffee. The taste is mostly of malt that starts off sweet and ends with a little bitterness. There is also some coffee. The beer has a nice thick mouthfeel but sits a little heavy and I don't think I'd have more than one at a time."
"I usually don't seek out porters so I don't have a great basis for comparison with this style. Nothing spectacular, which is usually how I feel about porters, but a good solid beer that is very drinkable."
"I was not all that impressed with this. Just odd and bland for the most part. Nothing I will get in the near future."
"This the first porter I drink in the fall every year. It was my all time second porter I have ever tasted. Big Shoulders from Chicago being my first. This porter is the standard in which I judge all others by. In the midwest it is hard to find this on tap, most bars in Indiana do not have a clue what a porter is anyway. Except the Floyds they brew a fine Xmas porter. Anchor porter has a great mouthfeel and head retention. It seems to get more complex in taste as it warms in your glass. May only age in the bottle for about six months tops."
"D - This is a good porter. Yet another great product from Anchor."
"It presents black in my pint glass crowned with a tan head that easily fades. The nose is fantastic, toffee, chocolate, and coffee. Smooth in the mouth, oily, but not in a bad way. Hops tingle the tongue while it rests in my mouth, then when swallowed all the flavors (toffe, chocolate, roasted coffee oh-so slight sweetness) come together. I often refer to this beer as ""The Nectar of the Gods."" It is a staple in the winter months but should be enjoyed year round. Highly Recommended!!"
"In its bottle at Moan and Dove. The appearance was a nice and dark body with a thin head. There were fruity, oak-like aromas permeating from the drink. The taste is wicked sweet with some woody aftertastes. It has a pretty good carbonation, making it nice and refreshing. In general, this is a delicious and refreshing porter."
"Black with tan head with good retention. Thin sticky lacing. Caramel and deep roasted malt. Very prominent sharp deep malt flavor. Dark chocolate and slight hops coming through. Good full mouthfeel. A good porter that finishes strong and lingers on the palate with coffee and caramel. Enjoyable beer. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Not my favorite porter. I don't consider this a session beer for me. However, based on the label this beer was brewed about 9 months before I drank it. I won't hold that against it and will definitely try it again."
"D: Drinkable beer. Probably wouldn't buy it again though."
"D: This beer is very rich, however it is still highly drinkable, I wouldnt call it a session beer in my opinion, but I can see others disagreeing"
"The Anchor Porter pours black as night into the pint with a nice foam head that dissipates quickly and leaves no trace on the side of the glass. It has a very nice and pleasant aroma of chocolate and coffee. It has a dryness in the mouth and roasted malt flavor. It is slightly bitter in the finish and was thin to me. Very nice style of American Porter."
"Dark black with nice browns when held to a light. Dark beige head. The nose was of chocolate malts and ripe fruits. A faint presence of hops gave it a nice refreshing aroma. The taste was quite smokey with the roasted malts. The dry medium body makes this a very drinkable beer. It is a good traditional porter that goes well with most meals or on its own."
"d - this is some tasty stuff, goes down smooth and i'm dying for another..."
"A somewhat thin porter, black as hell with an antique head. Smell and flavor are of well-kilned malt, and little more. Finish is nice, coating. Mouthfeel is nice, with a light viscosity. A very nice porter that fails to knock the socks off. Will probably buy again, but won't make it a point."
"D: Outstanding porter - one of the best. Feels bigger than it really is, but drinks pretty well anyway."
"I could drink this all day. This beer is fantastic. It is sweet but still somewhat dry and light, well balanced in every way."
"This beer drinks easy. I only like to drink one bomber a day. This beer is tempting me to have more and more."
"Drinkability: One of the better porters I've had, and the best American porter i've had. Try this is you like porters or even interested in porters"
"D--Like many porters, drinkable to a point. Yuengling is the most drinkable but this has more flavor. If you are into porters, this is a must drink."
"D - A couple in a session would be good but more than that would be too filling, not a bad thing though."
"Pours a jet black color with a finger of tan head that dissolves fairly fast. No highlights whatsoever, which is fairly impressive, even for a porter. Nose is strong on roasted malt , lemon, light caramel and a touch of molasses. Flavor is crazy toasted malt. Light nuts, coffee as well, and that lemon again from the nose. Body is full and thick, with solid carbonation. I really liked this one - got a lot of spunk, especially for porters (which I usually think of a little smoother and blander). Definitely recommended."
"Given the other styles I've been drinking lately this porter felt less like a beer and more like some Starbucks chocalte/espresso/coffee drink. I will definitely be drinking more of this in the future."
"Anchor Porter is on tap and on cask right now at Toronado. Brewed especially for the Toronado 20th anniversary party this is the best beer I have ever had in my life. Cask conditioned beers are my favorite and this beer is done to perfection. Except with a slight dried fig taste, this beer is everything you think it would be on cask. Big mouthfeel, perfectly uncarbonated, and just the right temperature, it fills up your mouth and leaves you wanting more. Hurry on down to Toronado as this is not going to be around forever."
"I could definitely have a few of these on a cool evening. Really nice, complex porter that's on the sweeter side and with less roasty/coffee flavor than others. Simply a classic. Bottoms up!"
"Man, what a nice beer all around. A great, highly drinkable porter. If you haven't had this, run out now and grab one."
"D: A good, solid American porter from Anchor, any porter fan should try this, a microbrew classic."
"It felt like silk going down, I could throws these back for eternity."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a dating code that you can decipher from the notes on the BA Anchor page. It was a dark black color. It had a couple finger brown head that settled into a collar with some foam in center. Slight lacing. Aroma was chocolate, coffee and dark fruit sweetness. The taste pretty much followed the smell. Slightly bitter finish but not imposing in any way. Mouthfeel was just north of watery but south of creamy. Overall a good Am Porter and definitely worth trying. Doesn't blow me away so not sure I'd buy more for home but see drinking this if I saw it on tap. (4, RB-OAY, T, Y)"
"Very good but mostly average porter. It has a very good character, but it lacks abit of the smoky factor associated with most porters. Still easy to drink and flavorful with a healthy hint of caramel malts and alittle bit of chocolate malts. Not a bad porter overall."
"My only gripe with this beer is its deep, aggressive, oily, lingering bitterness, like burning machine grease. Paradoxically, it creates a feedback loop; I need to drink more beer to rinse the aftertaste. Gradually I get used to it enough to finish the beer. The aromas are brilliant: vanilla grape jam coffee cream and cigarrettes. The texture is broad and drinkably shallow. Nice fruity tangy blackberry acidity informs the midpalate. Back off on the IBUs and this might be a perfect porter."
"Comment: Their is a possibility that the bottle we had (me and a BA friend) was a little old, so another taste, down the road, may be something to look at. If this is the best that Anchor Porter can do, than this is a very average beer. Not bad, but certainly not good."
"Pours a dark brown color, nice carbonation, huge two-finger plus creamy tan head, which hangs around a long time. The nose is malty, nice touch of toffee/chocolate/caramel. The taste is very nice malty, slightly sweet, good dose of toffee/chocolate/caramel. The finish is slightly dry. Medium body. Very drinkable, an very tasty brew from Anchor."
"This brew poured a crystal clear black- nice clean aromas; fruity malts, some burnt chocolate and a hint of alcohol. For me the taste as way too bitterl, even for an american porter. The mouthfeel was not very smooth, i felt a dry caustic bitterness through the entire bottle. There was no real roasted malt presence either, flavor was fleeting and unsatisfying. I can see how people loved this brew 20 something years ago when others were not available or as interesting, but now with so many more possibilities, im leaving this one on the shelf."
"Bottle. Black as night with a creamy off-white head. Wonderful roasted malt, slightly sweet flavor with just a hint of hops. Smooth as cream. I think this is a truly excellent beer. I just have to have this every once in a while. Thank god we can get this in Mississippi."
"Poured a very attractive dark brown to black color with tan head that stayed around for a little while. The aroma of this beer is of choclate and coffee. Mouthfeel is medium with carbonation level that is correct and makes this very smooth. Flavor is also of choclate and coffee. A very nice flavorful porter."
"Overall this was a wonderful beer and the reason why I love porters"
"Drinkability - This is a big brew and probably a bit too rich for everyday comsumption, but I'm one who tends to enjoy stouts over porters so I'm a bit biased. Still this is a seriously good beer and I'd be happy to lift one with a friend whenever I get a chance. I'll definetly have to give more porters a chance after this pleasant experience."
"D: The abv is moderate and the chocolate malts are a nice flavor. I would not turn this down."
"D - Overall a very nice tasting Porter. I would definitely recommend this and I will probably have it again."
"Drinkability: This is actually alot better than I thought it'd be."
"Drinkability: Pretty heavy, but I could down a few of these without a problem. Even though the taste is very stong, it's not a barrier to enjoying the brew. Very very nice. Will buy again - this might become addictive...."
"Had a six-pack of this in my fridge for a while, so this review is based on my overall experience with the sixer. This stuff always drinks very smoothly, major chocolate flavors with a sweet/spicy finish. Think clove, nutmeg, that kinda thing. Very very dark in the glass, works well right out of the fridge, only gets better as it warms up. Definitely one of my go-to beers."
"Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz bottle. It poured a jet black with a nice tan head. Smells is slightly fruitly with a rich malty scent. Taste is of a creamy chocolatley coffee with kind of a sweet taste at the end. Mouthfeel is pretty light compared to other porters i have had. This is a very good beer, i will most likely drink it again, it would make an excellent porter to try if you have never tried one before."
"D: Very drinkable due to the delicious, yet subtle flavors. I could easily put down several of these. Full, tasty, silky smooth and well balanced. An exceptional American porter."
"Very well done and quite drinkable for the style."
"Overall, this porter was outstanding. In many ways it mimics a much ""bigger"" beer than it is, yet it is nevertheless amazingly smooth and drinkable."
"Overall, one of the best porters I've had. Flavorful, but with just the right amount of thickness and lightness."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. This porter poured a solid black with a thick tan head. Some light lacing is left behind. Faint roasted malt aroma with some chocolate and hops. The flavor is outstanding for a porter. It consists of a nice chocolate taste, along with sweet roasted malts, and some subtle hop notes. Very smooth. Medium-bodied with a decent mouthfeel...maybe a bit thin. All that said, this is a solid effort from Anchor Brewing."
"Bottom line: This is a world class American Porter that just about anyone can find in the US. Highly recommended!!"
"Color is a beautiful opaque deep brown, tan head is fine-bubbled. Aroma is decidedly porter-ish with strong coffee hint. Rich porter flavor has strong chocolate overtone and smoky and hoppy components. Finish is bitter and zingy. Delicious and highly recommended - particularly on-tap."
"This porter pours a jet black into my glass with a very thick, creamy tan head with excellent lacing. The faintest ruby highlight makes it through the beer when held to a light. The aroma is moderately roasted, a little chocolately, and moderately sweet. The flavor is moderately roasty, slightly sweet, and has medium-low hop bitterness. The finish is quite smooth and leaves a blend of sweetness and roasted malts on the tongue. The carbonation is moderate and body is medium-full. Overall I thought this was a well done porter. A very nice beer to look at and the flavor is not overdone in any way; everything compliments each other, I especially like the bittersweet nature of the taste."
"Very smooth and very drinkable. I've got a special place in my heart for this brew. It was the beer I had in my hand when I stumbled upon this fantastic website! I haven't looked back since!"
"This beer pours a dark color with almost no transparency. The aroma has hints of coffee and alcohol. Taste is about the same with the alcohol showing through more than the actual taste of the beer. Still some hints of coffee left but something tells me that this beer just isn't the way it was meant to be sampled. Must be from sitting on a store shelf for so long. Still a decent, drinkable porter if you can get past the alcohol taste."
"12oz bottle. No freshdate date - just a cryptic code. Pours a very dark brown. Little carobnation visible and very little lacing. Faint aroma of malt. Nice taste of roasted malts, although I don't taste much in the way of the advertised hops. There is a decent amount of aftertaste, but it becomes slightly funky. Decent porter."
"D - The flavors comes together perfectly and stay strong. The body is surprisingly full and the beer doesn't have the typical watery taste at the end like I find in most Porters. I like that it leaned towards a Stout in some instances but drank like a Porter should the whole time. One of the most well-rounded Porters I've had to date. This is what I always thought a good Porter tasted like and it's almost flawless."
"This is a very easy drinking porter. I would take delight in having several of these in a sitting (though I don't normally like to do that). The bittersweetness of this brew makes up for any loss in complexity. This is a great straight-up porter and I think it will become a regular for me."
"Drinkability: A nice beer to just sit back, relax, and enjoy. I like this better when the weather is colder, but I had two left in the fridge and noticed I had not reviewed this so I thought might as well get my thoughts on this beer recorded. An excellent porter. Good example of the style."
"Sort of light/medium bodied, light carbonation. The finish is slightly dry and overall, this beer is very refreshing. Wonderfully tasty and easy to drink. I highly recommend this beer."
"Drinkability: Good."
"I only had a bottle from a mix n match sixer, but this is very drinkable. Not on the top top of my list for porters but a really solid porter. Very dependable."
"Thank goodness I have a sixer of this because they're going to be gone in no time. Not all that complex but the insane drinkability makes this one to pick up again."
"Anchor Porter pours a deep, dark black without a shade of lightness around the edge with a thick, tan head that leaves a nice lace as it fades. From a twelve ounce brown bottle. The aroma is dark malt and a bit of bitter cocoa. There is a thick mouthfeel. The flavor is dark malt, cocoa, a slight touch of raisin at the end. Very nice. Recommended."
"D: Good."
"This is a great beer! Poured with a nice frothy, thick, foamy rich, tan head and some lace. Most of the head dissipated. The color is a very dark, almost opaque brown with highlights of dark copper red. Nice nose of roasty malty coffee, cocoa, toffee, caramel. same thing for flavor but more bitter (sounds like bad grammar). I like a coarser porter. This is a bit thin, but still great. Good finish too."
"D- The best porter I have ever had. I don't normally run to drink porters, but this one is definitely one I will go back to. Meets the high standards you expect from a name like Anchor."
"This is the number one example of the style on BJCP, which makes me feel like it should have better than an 89..."
"I havent tried many porters, but until i tried anchor porter i thought it was a style i just was not supposed to like. The color is nice and dark and it has all the porter tastes but allows them to be subtle and smooth with a clean finish. Everytime i drink one i think, i dont like porter why do i like this so much. The mouthfeel seems a bit thicker which i like but since i havent had many porters this could be par for the course. I would suggest this beer to anyone, even those who claim to hate dark beer, or porters."
"little bottles in my fridge. Good, solid stuff here."
"Wow I've been sleeping on this one, whoops. Almost perfect 'black and tan' presentation, this is one good-looking beer. I actually poured it in a flared cocktail glass which really accents the deep red highlights. Everything a porter ought to be doing; chocolate malts, creaminess, general smooth texture. Blast of citric hops is the comparative advantage; they also lend a unique herbal medicine-flair. This might not have been George Washington's porter, but they've done something spectacular to his favorite quaff. Highly recommended in lieu of an after-dinner coffee, espresso, or dessert wine and to complement quality cinema (""Borat"" in this case!)"
"Very dark brown with a light (for a porter) head. Smells amazing, chocolate with hints of molasses and lightly toasted malt. Taste is very chocolaty with some really complex sweetness in the background and moderate bitterness to balance it out. Absolutely delicious. The mouthfeel is a little thin, and extremely smooth. Best stout or porter I've ever had."
"All in all, a very well-crafted porter, pleasant and easy to drink, if not my favorite."
"D - The drinkability of this beer is excellent, I could drink this all day long."
"Poured from a bottle into my pint glass. This porter looked a dark opaque brown, essentially black. Some light was apparent along the bottom edges. A decent light tan head reduced to a cap that lasted all the way down. Some splotchy lacing. Smell is roasted malts and some clean grainy hops. Taste is burnt chocolate, but not overbearing. Finishes with the alcohol hop bite noticed in the aroma. Mouth feel is clean and dry. I found this to be a very good beer, but I am not one to session porters."
"Overall, this is very drinkable. Nicely balanced with a lot going on but nothing that distracts. I had this with some BBQ'd steak...matched perfectly!! I was very impressed with this beer and will definitely have some more."
"Mine poured a midnight red with a standard head. it produced a nice little aroma, reminding me of a neighborhood coffee shop. The flavor is magnificent coffee, toffee, and dark baked fruits. This is an excellent porter -- what else do you expect from Anchor Brewing? (#2643, 1/7/07)"
":)"
"Drinkability - Like I said, I cut my Porter teeth on this beer. I love it, but a lot of porter drinkers find this one a tad harsh; and it is. Still pretty damn good tho."
"This is an awesome porter. Treat yourself - you won't regret it."
"This beer was black with a nice beige head. The smell was faint of spices? floral? The taste is malty and slightly bitter. It is malty, chocolaty and has a nice balance of hops. The mouthfeel is full and creamy  very nice. This is a great porter that is something Id recommend often if possible."
"cheers..."
"One of my favorite porters with no bitter aftertaste and a strong smooth feel. Highly recomended flavorful beer that will go great with strong and spicy foods. While I wouldn't grab this after mowing the yard on a cool fall evening you can't do much better."
"The flavor is a very well-balanced mixture of chocolate malt, subtle hops, and espresso. Quite a complex flavor. This beer never tries to get ahead of itself or be something it's not; it's a porter, through and through, which is a good thing. Too many American porters enter a hopping contest and it kills the integrity of the style, in my opinion. However Anchor's version stays true, making it a very enjoyable brew."
"and I'm still haunted by it!!"
"D - Malty, rich, robust dark beer = definitely a drinkable porter. At 5.6 % abv, go ahead and have a few."
"D- This beer has a good rich flavor with some nice hops to clean up the finish making it very drinkable. This beer is a true porter and not just a watered down stout that I have tasted so many of lately."
"This is lovely, and probably a much better sample than my on-tap review. I could do with a bit more coffee/dark chocolate and bitter notes, but this is a thoroughly pleasant porter."
"A fantastic porter and a fantastic beer to boot. Will definitely make its presence felt in the company of ANY beers you might be drinking during a session."
"D- I was very surprised by this. This has replaced Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald as my favorite porter. I kept reaching for my pint. It was gone pretty quickly."
"Drinkability is where this beer really shines. This is an excellent lighter yet very tasty session worthy porter. Anchor scores another winner."
"D- It is a excellent porter. Very nice easy drinking. It will fit my crave for porters perfectly especially at the price."
"Pours out a nearly black dark brown body with ruby highlights as put to light. Pours a moderately sized head the color of chocolate milk which then recedes to 1/4"". Spotty, scattered lacing. The big aromas that come out first are of chocolate, molasses, and toasted bread. Some roastedness comes out a bit, but it isn't all that prevalent. Some underlying fruit and cookie dough. The flavors in this blend so fluidly that it takes some concentration to pick out the flavors. Starts off with a bready pumperknickle flavor and dark chocolate with hints of cane syrup. Some ale fruitiness is present in the middle and this rounds out with a dry and bitter finish, thanks to the PNW hops. Some citrus and pine lingers on with nutty flavors. Overall, the malt is rather chewy. Mouthfeel is moderate in body, almost leaning toward thin, but the carbonation could use a little toning down. Firm drinkability."
"Drinkability on this beer is high, in my opinion. If you like a porter, this one is definitely on the top of my list."
"This is a really good beer, but just short of great. It is very easy drinking for a porter, with less tthan six on the boozeometer."
"D - Descent. Sort of weird-tasting IMO. Not bad, but very dissapointing to taste this after such a beautiful presentation and aroma. :("
"D - This is a very drinkable and sessionable porter. A fine american example of this classic style. I didn't expect a lot from it, but I was pleasantly surprised"
"D: Pretty good porter, smooth and very flavorfull. Would get this again"
"DA: I dig the style and this is a mighty fine Porter."
"Overall a big porter full of flavor. Flavor is balanced, but wouldn't mind a bit moe hop flavor. A very nice, but not overpowering beer."
"Drinkability- Overall a very good beer. Delicious. Need to get this more often."
"Mouthfeel is a bit too thin and lacks carbonation, but for some reason the drinkability is quite high due to the dry finish and low ABV. An outstanding porter, but just a bit sweet for me."
"Love this one and it will be a staple when I'm looking for a porter."
"Pours black with a creamy head that is light brown in color. Aroma is sweet with a roasty chocolate overtone. Very full in taste. Lightly sweet with suggestions of coffee. A vaguely oily mouthfeel makes this beer go down easy while still feeling full in body. Medium carbonation but still very creamy as it goes down. One of the better offerings of this style. Go get some today!!"
"Mouthfeel was nicely carbonated but not too much. Fuller bodied than some other porters I have tried. Enjoyable."
"Poured from a 22oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured an opaque black, with a 1/2 inch head, leaving nice lacing along the glass. The aroma is ver faint. A bit of chocolate with a little fruit in the mix. The taste is very much like the smell. A little burnt flavor, but mostly a weird sorta fruit flavor, followed by a light coffee aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium for a porter, not too light, but not thick either. Maybe I got a bad batch, but this is not what I expect a porter to taste like. Judging from the other reviews, I must have gotten a bad sample, but based on the one I have, I would look elsewhere for a porter. Not something that I would care to have on a regular basis."
"This is a very drinkable beer. Smooth yet robust, and not overboard on the ABV. A very sessionable and tasty dark brew."
"Finishes well. Leaves a nice aftertaste and clean bite."
"Drinkability:"
"Drinkability wise...I am happy I'm drinking this beer at this particular moment, but I think when I'm done with it I'll have something else."
"Overall: A spot on porter with quite a lively flavor profile. Worth a try."
"Drinkability - good drinking ale and very sessionable."
"This is a very drinkable beer that's well balanced. The flavor doesn't wow you like some other porters and stouts, but it's definitely worth a try."
"Overall impression: Definitely a quality example of the style. Highly balanced, drinkable, and complex"
"D - A good beer all-around, easily lent to a session and quite enjoyable on a rainy night. I would, though, like to see a bit more hops in here (as per usual...), but that's just my preference."
"This is good, I'm impressed. The smell suggests the sweet would overpower the bitter; to my surprise the hops come out nice and strong in flavor. The rich and thick malt flavors are wide and varied. They all compliment the hop flavors and impressively the yeast byproducts; I especially love how the banana vibe sits with the chocolate and floral hops. I could drink this all the time. Kudos to Anchor."
"Mouthfeel is rich and smooth, without being overly heavy. Drinkability is outstanding, even sessionable. As much as any beer, this is the definition of the Amercian robust porter. Its a terrific ale that has complexities and subtleties, and is still eminently quaffable. It doesn't get much better than this."
"An exceptional porter and a reason to look forward to the winter. I love dark beers when it is cold and this is no exception. There is a certain phenol group in the beer that reminds me of licorice. It's the same phenol as in the sam adams cream stout. This is a very excellent beer. Stop reading this review and try it already."
"Drinkability: This isn't going to make the hop head or burnt-to-all-hell porter fan, but this is almost too sessionable, highly drinkable, and perfect for this time of the season. Not too heavy, not too dark, and lots to chew on as you drink it."
"Opaque black colour with a creamy coffee coloured head. Some lacing. Rich bitter roasted malt aroma, some honey-ish yeast and floral hop. Flavour was roasty, malty, coffee-ish, bitter and rich. Oily, full bodied and smooth mouthfeel. Very tasty porter."
"A good porter, in my opinion. Far from the best I've had, but still a good porter compared to some of the garbage that's out there. It has a very traditional flavor and style to it which I like a lot. Recommended."
"Overall, this porter looks great, smells great, and tastes good. Could use a nudge more strength on the taste, and a little bit more body. An awesome summer porter nonetheless."
"A very well done porter, pitch black with a coffee tar head up top, chocolate is hinted at in the smell along with maltyness and a dark dry black taste at the beginning. Flavorful yet light, could have a little bit more at the end but the lightness is actually refreshing. A nice cold weather beer with chocolate or red meat. Well done job from Anchor."
"D - Simply an awesome porter. I could drink loads of the stuff."
"D-Really drinkable good stuff"
"Soft, chewy, and creamy mouthfeel, but not dry at all. This is also easily drinkable; I'd never thought I'd describe a porter as a session beer, but if there is one, then this is it. Goes down incredibly smooth and easily."
"One of the best porters around."
"Overall, it's a decent porter. Definitely better warmer."
"Very nice beer, but flavor is almost too much too drink more than a couple of these."
"Very creamy mouthfeel with perfect carbonation. This beer is obviously best enjoyed after taking out of the fridge and letting it sit for a good 15-20 minutes. I can't say enough about this absolute MASTERPIECE. This and the Smuttynose Robust Porter are my current favorites. I cannot get enough of them. This one may even edge out on the Robust Porter. It is that phenomenal."
"The pour into my Fuller's nonic raises a quick-settling two-finger plus head. It seems to find comfort at one finger, and stays there for a while. The head is a darker tan, and very creamy looking. Leaves sudsy lacing that elongates down the glass more than most beers. The color is fully opaque. The head does manage to finally come down to surface lacing, so I can't give quite a perfect score. The nose reeks (nicely, though) of molasses, caramel, and brown sugar, with definitely sweet chocolate notes. Reminiscent of a milk stout. The taste is not as markedly sweet as the nose would suggest. Rather, it feels balanced, with the addition of some acidity. Rich in dark fruit tones and chocolate, the beer then ends in a slight, lingering coffee bitterness, with sharp acidity running throughout. Very nice, although I would personally like to see more chocolate. The mouth is medium, with fine carbonation. A tad more body would be appreciated, but it's still very nice. Overall, an excellent beer that is quite easy to drink."
"Poured into my Tumbler a dark and toasted blackish brown. Its got hearty, thick tan head that rises straight to the top and stays. The lacing is pillowy and thick, clinging to the side of the glass. Smells of of subtle charred malt with dark sweet fruity esters, maybe some candied apple, plum, and even spice cinnamon, coffee. The taste is medium sweet robust, the toasted/charred malt is very present and pleasing along with the presence of a hops that come to the front toward the end in a very supportive role. The finish is rounded off with a sweet coffee flavor. The mouth-feel on this one is a little milky and less crisp than most beers I drink, which is still pleasant, how ever I think I could only drink so many of these because they seem to sit a little heavier in my stomach than that of most quads even. This is a tasty beer maybe because of the lack of crisp carbonation it seems to be a little too heavy for me, but honestly its a very enjoyable beer. Personally I could do with a little more strength too, but that really doesn't turn me off. Get some."
"drinkability: good"
"D- an excellent porter, very drinkable, moderate alcohol, the staple brew of American porters, i would recomend/buy/drink any day"
"This beer is amazing with its cherry, citrus, and subtle bread aroma. The dark liquid reveals a redish hue when held upto the light. The minimal effervescence does not provide this beer with much of a head. Upon drinking I notice a bitter fruity taste followed by a distinctly cherry after taste. Smooth and round this is one of my favorite American Porters. Plenty of body, lots of flavor, easy on the alchol taste."
"D: The smoothness makes it very drinkable, especially considering its a full bodied porter."
"D: This is a very drinkable porter. Light on the tongue and you can't taste booze. Goes down real easy. The ABV is probably just a tad too high to make this a session beer, although it wouldn't stop me."
"Poured into a big ol mug. Smells and tastes sorta like a coffee I once had, nutty(?) I want to say. Anchor Porter is very unique to me... of course this my first time having a porter. At first I thought I wouldn't want to drink a healthy amount of this, but then the beer just grew on me. It was soon goin' down great. I would gladly drink again."
"D- yummy, this beer is a treat. I will have this beer again and am looking for it. I think this would pair well with any dessert or some BBQ dishes."
"Overall- A delicious Porter. Anchor just can't do no wrong!! A solid beer from a solid brewery!!"
"Poured with a nice light tan colored head, thick and creamy looking.A chestnut brown with a slight reddish hue,very nice.It smells fruity,nutty.a kind of bannana aroma.A fruity,nutty,roasted coffee flavor,very complex.A medium body,smooth,with a coffee-like bittering finish. a very drinkable and tasty brew.Wish I had another one."
"Drinkability: Just one is a tease, you will want more."
"-Oelergud"
"Poured a deep Mahagony color with beautiful foamy tannish head. Smell is a pleasant mixture of bitter chocolate and dark earthy fruits. Taste brings more bitter coffee tastes combined with strong dark fruit elements. Finishes on the bitter side which gives perfect balance to the fruitiness. Very drinkable. Nice and cremay in the mouth."
"Had again after a long time at Lucky Baldwin's. This porter is really nice. There is actually a quite apparent banana smell to it. Reminds me of my homebrewed porter that I made using London ale yeast that fermented too warm. Pretty tasty overall with a nice light roastiness. Ratings updated."
"Drinkability: good. Nice and toasty, but not overwhelming."
"drinkability is great. it's been years since i last had an anchor porter and it's always good. thanks again nate!"
"Wonderfully drinkable and tasty. One of the best porters on the market."
"Overall well balanced, roast qualities could be a bit higher."
"Idles in the glass opaque black with reddish-orange highlights and a tall dense tan head that is slow to dissipate. Scents of toffee and dried fruit are interlaced with roasted accents. On the tongue it strikes with cherries and dark chocolate which meld slowly back into the roasted malts and then off into a very dry and slightly bitter coffee finish. Full bodied, creamy and inviting. Simply a solid porter."
"The head is thick and frothy with a really sticky lacing. The head sticks around for a long time. The color is jet black. The smell is roasted coffee with some sweet undertones of dark chocolate. The taste is sweet roasted coffee with chocolate and other spices that are just rich and nice. The mouthfeel is smooth and goes down wonderfully. I will definetly have more of this wonderful brew."
"Poured a dark brown, though not quite opaque, with a medium sized tan head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma was chocolate with roasted malts. Bitter dark chocolate with roasted aftertaste. One of the best, widely available porters on the market today."
"Poured a deep black body that let no light through. Very small light tan head disappeared quickly leaving just a skim over the top and just a small amount of lacing. Nose is full of roasted malt and coffee along with a hint of sweet dark fruit and chocolate. The flavors of coffee and burnt roasted malt hit you first followed by a smoky finish. I expected it to be sweeter but it seems that the hops cut just enough of the sweetness out to give it a good balance. Feels thick, chewy and creamy on the tongue. Overall a very nice porter that I will definietly drink again."
"Pours almost black with tan head and lots of lacing. Aroma is reminiscent of chocolate, coffee and fruit. Taste is roasted malts which finishes with evident alcohol and bitterness. Mouthfeel is thick with light carbonation. This isn't the most exciting beer, but its very solid and enjoyable. The thickness keeps this from being a good session beer, but it is enjoyable on its own."
"D - Goes down pretty easy. A little more filling than I like but still a nice brew."
"Anchor has some interesting yeast. Like Liberty Ale, there's something very vaguely Belgian going on. This beer is different, and really good."
"Notes--probably my favorite porter."
"Jet black with a little brown, and even less red at the edges. Darker caramel-like head, that retains exceptionally well throughout the beer. The nose is quite bitter, dark roasted malts, chocolate, espresso, and coffee beans. A little hops noticeable in the aroma. The taste has a lot of roasted malts as well, creamy coco, chocolate liqueur, and coffee/espresso. Some good earthy/grassy bittering hops come through in finish and aftertaste to help balance, but are not overpowering. Good creamy body, but not overly filling, and a fair amount of carbonation helps keep it from getting too sticky. The more of these I have the more I like them and the easier they go down."
"this is a great porter, malty, good hopflavor, bitterness with a balancing sweetness."
"This was a tasty treat and im looking forward to treating myself to another again. Had a cool summer's night to enjoy this one, and could see having a few of these to fortify myself against the harshness of winter, although its probably too rich to be a session beer."
"p.s. Anchor serves my favorite lager."
"D - A tasty porter, which is solid in all departments. Recommended."
"This is a very high quality beer. Like your dream car, it comes fully loaded with a beautiful appearance. If they don't have singles, there is definitely a good chance of sacrificing a few bucks for the six pack."
"Pours the darkest of browns. One finger plus tan head, with decent retention, and excellent lace. Smell is of malts, and coffee. Body is light to medium, and slightly carbonated. Taste is sweeter than I expected. Malts, and alchol up front. Finish was bittered,but smooth."
"My first Anchor offering, and what a treat it was. This is an awesome beer, and it sets the bar for American Porters. Definitely give this one a try."
"Cheers."
"Anchor Porter is closer to a more complex Sweet Stout than a Porter. Porters should be a complex assortments of specialty malts and copius amounts of hops to balance out the heavy malt bill. Hops bitterness and aroma were lacking in this ale. The cloying malt aftertaste also subtracted from the drinkability. Disappointing Porter all around."
"Drinkability: Although this is rich, I could drink a few of these in one sitting, as the taste is very good, but not overwhelming. No ""alcoholic"" taste either. This reminds me of Mackeson XXX Stout, which is another favorite of mine. I recommend this one."
"Very easy to drink, and easily could be a session beer."
"This is a great tasting beer that does the porter name proud. Truly a delicious beverage."
"D - I sure wish I had a whole six-pack of this and not just a single bottle of it. very tasty brew with high drinkability."
"Blackest brown, or brownest black, depends on the angle you're drinkin from. Big bloom of firm fluffy light brown head. Ovaltine merengue. The nose is roasted malt, cocoa, molasses, nutty merengue, slight soy, sweet and delightful. The taste starts with a light bitter bite of hops, then a full toasty creamy malt. Smoky at times, slight burnt notes, delicious.Nice full mouthfeel, great long aftertaste, a wonderful bottle of beer."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color porter with a slightly above average foamy head with good retention. Aroma of roasted malt is well blended with some flavourful coffee. Taste is a mix between well balance roasted malt and coffee with a medium bitter finish. Body is real creamy and quite full. Probably one of the best porter I have had so far."
"Drinks too easy, happy to see this beer back in Co. Springs. Reminds me of a chocalate milkshake, seek out & enjoy. Been drinking this since 91& it has never dissapointed me, a superior porter"
"Nice and smooth yet flavorful."
"Nice and black. Head is about an inch thick and tan. Nose is mild coffee and choclate, with burnt sugar rounding it out. Taste is largely the same plus some dark fruit. Mouth is active, with carbonation rushing all over the tongue. A wonderful porter, one our country can be proud of. Not as good as Fuller's London Porter but DAMN close. A beer to be proud of."
"This brew is easily drinkable, and very tasty. It'd make a nice brew to share a 6-pack with a friend, wife, relative, whoever! Well done!"
"on tap serving. Overall this is an easy beer to drink, even though most people shy away from the darker beers simply because they thinks its going to taste too thick. This one breaks that barrier as its still within the realm of the style for porters, its not overwhelming in any aspect to drink. It goes down nicely and has a roast flavour to it, but not a burnt flavour that you can find in some porters. This would be a great ""beginner"" porter for some to break into this style but that were reluctant before. But by all means this is not a beginner beer in any other respect. Great beer and easy to drink a few pints of for sure."
"Nice American adaptation, though I must admit I prefer the more well rounded English versions. Still, very worth experiencing. I think a fresher bottle might also help; will revisit this one someday."
"My short tour through most of Anchor's offerings ended with this fine beer, probably my favorite of the lot."
"d: Amazing. Incredibly easy to drink, goes down smooth, lingering and delightful aftertaste. This is a beer you'll always want to have around"
"Pours dark black with a one finger with a tan/brown head. Smell is black malts and sweet dark fruit with a bit of chocolate. Mouthfeel is slightly chewy and creamy. Flavor is sweet roasty dark malts with a nice blend of hops to balance the flavors. Overall, a wonderful porter!"
"Dvery, very good, one of my favorite porters, I think."
"Drinkability - love it - very smooth."
"Pure black with a fluffy, nearly brown-hued head. No change in color when I hold it up to the light. Perfect. Aroma is light and ""english"" style, with an faint american twist with some grass overtomes and a hint of pine for the hops. Light but complex aromas. Taste is truly full, deep roasted malt, sweet malts, with detectable layers to the malt profile (pale? caramel? chocolate)... Finishes hoppy in a suble way that simply balances out the sweetness but doesn't linger long. Finishes extra dry. This is such a smooth tasting beer, and paired excellently with a good burger. Mouthfeel is bright, minimal carbonation, full tasting, and shouldn't be any lighter, but just thick enough to satisfy--not watery like a guinness. While at times I somehow imagine a porter being even better (I daydream about these things), I love this porter, and it's nearly, if not clearly, the best."
"D - An everyday drinking porter that should be available just about everywhere."
"This was an impulse buy and Im glad I did. Pours a dark black, not very thick and not a large head. Leaves a nice lacing on the glass as I continue to drink down. Aroma is heavy on the hops and malt, perhaps a bit of coffee and bitter chocolate. The taste is heavy hops and alcohol, with the maltiness powering through. Aftertaste of malts and chocolate continue, but is very mild and balanced. A creamy yet somewhat bitter brew that confused me a bit. I would say that the mouthfeel is creamy and low carbonated and that the drinkability is high as far as porters are concerned. I would recommend this beer highly to anyone and I hope to get a better feel for the interesting and complex taste in my second bottle. Enjoy."
"I have to re-review this one. Man, this stuff is awesome. Very chocolatey and malty upfront, and oddly, very hoppy on the finish. A true, true, alltime classic. A bit overpriced in Ohio, as I used to get Anchor Steam at 6.99 a sixer in florida and now, 9.49. But every once in awhile I get the urge. If you want to introduce yourself to an alltime, award winning, classic American Porter...this is it..and none better."
"This porter poured a dark brown and had a nice medium head to it. It's smell had plenty of roasted malt aroma as well as a medium hop scent to it. The taste was similar and was full of plenty of body and rich malt flavor. The bitterness was about medium and was a good balance. The mouthfeel was medium/thick with a medium carbonation. In summary, I felt this was an above average porter that I would definately drink again, but I didn't feel that it had any qualities that made it stand out to me (save for it's good quality). It's an all-around good porter and I'd recommend trying it."
"Edited 6/21/07 after further exploring the style."
"If you like porter you WILL enjoy this brew."
"I am still sold on this excellent porter. A solid beer from a solid brewery."
"Overall a very good tasting and drinkable brew. I'd definitely drink it again, and it would make a great session beer as well. I wish I had another one with me tonight!"
"The drinkability is good, very sessionable."
"Final Thought: Solid beer across the board with a taste like no other!"
"This is one of the beers that introduced me into craft beers. I just don't know how Anchor does it. I can find this almost anywhere...gas stations, grocery stores etc. and Anchor is all the way across the country. How they can make such large batches, yet still have such high quality is beyond me. The best porter I've had and an American classic in my opinion."
"A good porter, but I don't see any reason to get this again. There are better porters, there are cheaper porters. Also really strong in flavor for any mass consumption, especially considering the ABV."
"Overall: A very good porter, enthusiastically recommended."
"Pours nearly black and opaque, just short, and has a low to moderate tan head. The smell is rich and malty with a hint of something fruity. The taste is pretty complex, with coffe and burnt toast flavors. There is also a hint of something like an ester or diacetyl. odd. Mouthfeel is on the high side of meduim, with enough carbonation to balance it as well as dryness, but there is also a tiny bit of tongue numbing as well. Overall, a damn fine porter."
"Very pleasant. I'm going to break open a Hersey's bar to eat as I finish the rest of my glass. Wish I had some devils food or chocolate cake with thick frosting instead. This would go perfectly."
"Best Porter I have tasted so far...pity similar brews are so hard to get a hold of over here."
"Overall: Wow. This really struck me as too sweet. Good feel and fairly complex overall, but still too sweet for me to embrace."
"This is a pretty drinkable porter...I'd have another; if there was one in the fridge."
"Mouthfeel was creamy. Bitterness is perfect. Some astringency lingers. For originality in the style I would certainly give a five. A completely unique experience as far as porters go. I love the taste, but maybe a little out of bounds (or is it so inbounds I am completely blown away)? I am often wrong so no offense. I thoroughly enjoyed this tasty beer! Certainly the tastiest porter I have set lips to."
"The carbonation is slight-to-moderate. The aftertaste is present, but not strong. Overall, I don't find much special about it, but it's not bad either."
"Overall, this was a great porter. Anchor puts out another excellent product and I would highly recommend it."
"D = Was ok. I wonder what this would taste like fresh. Must go out and buy some more. I have a feeling my bottle was ruined somehow."
"Strong flavor of Chocolate and alcoholic esters. Fairly strong for a porter, almost stout like. Somewhat strong on hops with a bit of nuttyness. Estery alchohol really stands out on this pour. This was served a bit cold so as it warms it gets better. The bitter finish distracts from the toasty flavor that I like. Seems that a bit too much roasted grain give this beer too much dry tannin flavor. Also I think the cold serving temp really hurts this one, I like my porters a bit sweeter and the cold serving temp takes away from the overall flavor."
"This deep brown brew is mostly opaque. The nose opens up fruity, almost Weizen-like, with a trace of bubble gum. The aromas, surprisingly, seem to subside a little as you drink. The first sips reveal fruity and roasted flavors playing off each other. A beefy bitterness arrives mid-palate, then fades into a medium finish to give way to a light fruitiness. Anchor Porter really is a super beer, easy to drink considering its hefty appearance. It's quite distinctive and fabulously drinkable."
"Overall: A great porter that's available almost anywhere. A good choice."
"Overall: This is a nice flavorful porter, one of my favorites."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Mouthfeel is sudsy and carbonated, a nice feel going on. Drinkable for a porter, yes- it's just not what I hoped it would be. I'll have to try another batch of this at a later date..."
"This is one of my favorite beers and has been for a while. Pitch black with a foamy head this beer just looks good from the start. At first you get that roasted flavor followed very quickly by malt. Slight coffee taste but not as much as most porters. The best part is the finish of this beer. Leaves you with a smooth malty feeling aftertaste. You cannot wait to have another drink. Like most porters in my opinion better served around the 55 F mark. Great porter and a great beer."
"This beer pours a very dark brown almost black with a very large creamy tan head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is of dark malts and molasses. The taste is very malty with just enough hops to balance it out. There is kind of a coffee flavor as well. The mouthfeel is chewy and carbonated. This is a very good beer that I am drinking for the first time. It's goes down very well."
"D - Excellent drinkability. Very well done. Layers of flavor. Not a baltic porter, but I think if it wanted to it could easily become one. One of my very favorite American porters."
"Pours a dark brown with a lasting 1/2"" coffee colored head. Smell is of roasted malts and caramel. The taste is very true to the style, but with a nice added complexity. The taste is sweet up front with very rich roasted and coffee flavors in the middle and a nice bitter finish. Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, and nicely carbonated. Drinkability is outstanding. This is a pretty widely available beer. If you have not tried it yet, go and get it now. You will not be dissappointed."
"Pours a deep dark brownhue topped by a pretty tan head that diminishes but doesn't disappear. Superb, rich aroma of dark roasted malt, raisins, prunes, some dark chocolate and a touch of grass. Palate is initially sweet with lactose and roasted malt, with undertones of milk chocolate and raisins. Finish is more of the same - tasty, sweet, and creamy. Body is silky and creamy - damn good. I'm almost mad at myself for not having tried this years ago. I'm a definite fan."

"This is a way good porter. Anchor's best beer in my experience. A special beer."
"Overall a great porter. very solid beer, and pretty available. not a bad price either."
"Breakdown: A one trick pony that does it's one trick very well."
"Mouthfeel is very full and thick with adequate carbonation to keep things moving. The keyword here is rich. It is so rich that this is the only thing that hinders its drinkability. Other than that, I could have several in a night. This is simply a world class porter."
"An often overlooked great beer. Everyone should keep stock in their fridge. Pours a nearly-opaque brown-black with hints of dark ruby highlights. Moderately carbonated and shows good proteins and retention. Smells unmistakenly chocolate and coffee with a light toffee sweetness and a mild lactose softness. Tastes boldly of bittersweet cocoa, columbia coffee, roasty and toasty. Lightly hopped for balance, but not flavor. A soft sweetness lingers into the aftertaste. Has a full, rich, soft feel to the mouth with a lightly roasty bitter finish. The acidity seems a bit high, combined with roastedness and a light scrubbed carbonation, are the only factors keeping this beer out of my top 10."
"12 oz. bottle. Dark brown coffee, just light enough so you know it's not a stout -- but pretty dark all the same! Light brown crater-pocked head. Aromas of coffee, caramel and earthy (almost like compost) hops. Earthy pine bitterness from the hops is the first thing I notice about the taste. A caramel malt sweetness climbs aboard after rounding the horn with a metallic bite at the finish, which is followed by an espresso roast aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel for the most part with a satisfyingly dry finish. This is simply a superb porter -- one of the best I've ever had. It's pretty rich for a porter which shaves a couple points off the drinkability for me, but damn fine nonetheless. Damn fine, indeed..."
"Dark brown, not quite black in color, with some amber highlights. Half inch thick creamy tan head. Some sticky, delicate lacing that disappears quickly. Strong aromas, roasted malt, dark fruits and lots of molasses. Very nice! Quite a different taste from other porters I've sampled. Not so much coffee and chocolate, but the flavor concentrates more on the roasted malts, licorice and dark fruits. Very flavorfull!! Nice creamy smooth mouthfeel, with just the right amount of carbonation. Awesome drinkability, not heavy and a low abv., a definite session brew. An excellent offering from Anchor and one I highly recommend!"
"This is a very good porter. The bottle says it has a thick and creamy head but I did not get that result. The color is deep burgundy with just a bit of light coming through. The smell is of chocolate, scotch and is also a bit like Pepsi. The taste is of oatmeal and it also has the scotch in the background. The mouthfeel is smooth with just a bit of twang. Typical for the style. I would drink these again but not on a regular basis, not because of the beer but the price. Anchor beers are some of the most expensive beers in this area. But I will have one again sometime."
"As I'm starting to explore ""porters"" I tried this at a local pub. Dark brown, almost black. Big roasted coffee aroma. First sips were not impressive as the beer was too cold. After it warmed up, the taste improved, but still didn't really impress me. Maybe I had too many porters earlier in the day (Alpha Klaus and Alaskan Smoked). I think I'll try to re-rate this beer when my taste buds aren't tainted by hops and smoke."
"Dark, typical porter color that pours almost black. Tan head that doesn't last long and leaves a slight ring on the mug. Deep roast scents with an almost floral type hint. Taste is a bit disappointing, I went to World Market hoping to get a London Porter and they were out so I picked this up and I wish the London Porter was there b/c this doesn't quite cut it. Its a malty flavor and a little too bitter for me. Coffee hints & something else, kinda like the smell almost floral. Its not the easiest to drink but I will make due for the next 5 that are remaining."
"Yummy porter! Definitely better than many and I'm sure it deserves its reputation as a classic."
"The pouring liquid from the bottle looks a deep brown and once in the glass looks quite black. The foam is a light brown shade, that is really just a crust that dissipates to a foamy ring over time. The smell is sweet and tangy, with chocolate and coffee flavors, and perhaps some fruitiness in there also, although I can't pinpoint it. May some licorice aroma too? The malt flavor is full and sweet. Hints of coffee and chocolate with a nice dry bitterness. It's almost a bit tangy also, different than many other porters. The flavor is very similar to the 2005 Our Special Ale for Christmas. It has a rich full mouthfeel, slightly chewy and with nice carbonation. Quite drinkable, not very alcoholic, a nice porter..."
" This beer grew on me. My mistake was drinking it too warm. This one is better right out the fridge."
"Poured from a bottle with no freshness date into an imperial pint glass. A nice 1"" tan head sits on top of a black body, which one would expect from a porter. After about 5 mins the head sinks down to a small cap. Dark bitter chocolate malt dominate the nose with hints of coffee there too. After first sip the choc/coffee maltiness linger with some kind of astringency that almost leaves me tasting something that reminds me of mint. Carbonation if just about right on being just enough. Like other reviewers I wish the body was a bit fuller in the finish. Overall a very good drinking beer that I'd be happy drinking anytime."
"A venerable old standby for me. I find Anchor Porter in the strangest places and I always quaff it down if it is availible among the normal macro lineup. Great body and texture. less flavor than i think it should have, somewhat muted somehow and doesn't show off the roastiness/coffee flavors as much as I like in a porter, but still a great beer that I will always go back to."
"Poured into a pint , out of the nicely designed and labeled bottle , very dark and opaque black. Head is exellent , about 1 1/4 inch , tanish color similar to the main color of the label , and it sticks around as 1/4 inch the entire way through leaving slight lacing. Taken to the nose , smells of dark roasty malt , slight chocolate , and a hint of toffee or butterscotch. Very pleasant and welcoming. Taste is rich, hearty malt at first with a little bit of chocolate , then the whole hops kick in nice. Slight Bitter , dry finish of coffee and subtle toffee. ( not very sweet though) . Nicely carbonated and silky mouthfeel. This is one great American Porter. World class brew from a world class brewery. Super dinkable."
"Gorgeous inky black with an antique white head and chunks of sticky bubbles on the sides of the glass. Smell is a baking chocolatey licorice, cakelike, inviting. The taste hampered a bit by an unexpected thinness. Malty chocolate, somewhat sweet flavor. Nutty bitterness balances everything out. Mouthfeel is medium, yet too thin for what I would like, but still satisfying. An easy quaff, a great regular drinking porter."
"Could drink one of these right when I wake up in the morning ;) Def. my favorite beer from my favorite style at the moment. Recommend ++."
"Pours a deep amber/black... almost opaque, with a thick tan head that recesses to just a ring around the outer rim of the glass. Leaves tons of lace. Aroma is rich and malty with touches of espresso. Flavor is a burnt/sweet mix of coffee, charcoal, coffee and malt, with a touch of alcohol. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and sticky. This is a very nice session beer, although I do have to admit that I was a little dissapointed that it didn't have a more prominent hop profile (being a West Coast Porter and all.)"
"Drinkability/Notes  One of, if not the best porter I have ever had. Goes down easy, sessionable, tasty, all round great beer. (no freshness date, some kind of batch marking)"
"Poured an opaque blackish-brown with a thick and foamy light tan head, lasted quite nicely, heavy lacing from the fallen head. Smells like the typical porter, of dark chocolate and roasted espresso beans and malty with a slight bitter tinge. Smell is much weaker than the taste, which is a mirror sense of the smell only deeper and more complex, finishes sweet after a bitter beginning. Bitterness is similar to that of a shot of straight black espresso, but falls off into the malt and sweetens. Mouthfeel is watery thin yet slick and syrupy on the tongue thanks to the low level of carbonation present in this brew. Drinkability nothing special, marks with other porters in my book, a little above average. All in all a nice take on the American Porter."
"It pours a dark brown black color and leaves a small layer of foam. Appearance is very nice, smell contains roasted barley, slightly burned and in the back some oily notes, the smell I suspect from roasted oats. Taste is bitter, dry and burned, some liquorice notes. Carbonation is very fine and very pleasant in the mouth. The only minor critisism I have is that it is a little bit too sticky."
"d A very drinkable beer. The more I drink it the more I like it. Nice balance between sweet and bitter."
"I still feel it's lacking on the smell, especially to style; I get mustiness and brown sugar, with little roastedness. ""It is aesthetically pleasing and wholly superior in every respect," claims the neck label. Dunno about the latter, but it sure is pretty to look at. Overall, seems like fans of milk/sweet stouts would enjoy this one more than people who like a nice robust porter."
"I decided to try the beer thinking it would be very hard to find anywhere else around here. Now it's all over the place in this area. However, there are many other beers I would drink above this one."
"boy is the taste a disappointment. not bad, but was expecting a lot more heft to this one; certainly doesn't live up to the ""intensely rich flavor"" promised on the label. roasted, slightly burnt malts are there, with a slight touch of coffee, and a hint of molasses, but it's all relatively weak. relatively uninteresting porter."
"D: Not the best porter that I've had, but very ""drinkable"" in the sense that it goes down easily and quietly."
"Dark rich thick body and head. Chocolate maltiness throughout. Creamy thick mouth feel and slight overall bitter aftertaste. Smell is mildly sweet and mildly bitter. All in all another good porter."
"Notes: At this point I put this porter as the american standard to strive to get close to."
"Drinkability: The fruity flavors dominate this porter; different and quite enjoyable"
"Pours a very dark brown, almost completely black, with a medium-sized, creamy, tan head that has good retention. Excellent lacing. The smell is of very smooth dark malts and caramel with a little fruit and a slight citrus kick. The taste is mostly marvelous roasted malts. Toasted marshmallow, coffee, chocolate, and light fruit. The finish is lightly floral and spot on for bitterness. It has a medium-full body, creamy texture and soft carbonation. I had no idea that this beer was this good. Could be a little bigger and fuller, but otherwise its a well-rounded porter and a real treat."
"The pour is into an Imperial pint glass; nice thick carbonated tan head. the opaque brown shows no light through it and the head stay thick throughout the session. The smell is of rich roasted coffee almost burnt. The taste is much the same as the smell. The roasted coffee dominates with tones of malt and a strong presence of hop bitterness at the end; there seems to also be an astringent taste that I can't place. This astringent taste feels acidic in the mouth and the body can leave you full after just one or two. Still an excellent porter for anytime of the year."
"The one thing it has going for it is the way it pairs with food. I drank a bottle of this with some roast beef and they worked really well together. Still, that doesn't make up for the overall blandness. This isn't worth $10 a six pack to me."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: I could session this porter."
"Ohhh yes!! Never tried the Anchor porter, only had their steam beer and that was a long time ago. Pours a nice almost black in color with a tan head. Taste is incredible, cocoa powder, raisins, roasted malt all blends perfectly. Finishes a bit sweet. I love it!! A bit pricey but worth seeking out."
"Overall this is a very drinkable beer as far as darker beers go. This could even be a session beer depending on your tastes."
"12 oz. with some code on the back. Pours like a stout - black with the faintest hints of red when held to light. It's topped with a 1 finger brown head that leaves a big collar and some good lacing. Smells of caramel, chocolate, cherries, chocolate-covered cherries, plums, tart apple, and perhaps some buttery notes. Tastes like burnt malts, coffee, chocolate-covered cherries, and a bitterness from the hops, burnt malts, and coffee. The bitterness lingers awhile. The body is creamy and full, thick like a milkshake. A top-notch brew."
"It pours a great dark color with a good tan head with fantastic retention. The color is almost completely opaque. The smell is a fantastic blend of hops and malts. The taste exhibits the same characteristics as the smell. There is a much welcome bitterness and delightful sweetness. Roasted malts are also detectable. The beer feels fantastically thick and carbonated. I find this to be a fantastic brew that can be drank night after night"
"Poured black as night with a nice off white head leaving a nice lacing behind. Nose is of chocolate malts, almost a sweet coffee smell. Taste starts with the chocolate-coffee malts and finishes with a nice dry hop finish. Mouthfeel is nicely full for the style. Overall drinkability is near perfect. I am happy to know that I have another one in the fridge awaiting!"
"This pours a dark black with a two finger creamy head.This has a real strong coffee and malt smell.The taste is very malty with coffee and a sweet aftertaste thats very nice.This is a very good tasting beer.The m/f is medium and fills your whole mouth evenly.I really enjoyed this and would recommend it."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is velvety smooth throughout the drinking experience. Man this is a treat. A very good beer to drink several of."
"Often overlooked...a damned fine porter."
"Pitch black with ruby highlights. Tan creamy head that has a long lasting lace. Fruity, coffee, roasted malt, and slight bitter hop. The taste is a semi-sweet chocolate and coffee flavor. Course hops with a slightly salty and malty aftertaste. Medium bodied and very easy to drink. Hands down the best porter in America!"
"edit: Goes great with smoked summer sausage and hickory smoked gouda. The added smokiness and the palate coating cheese help to balance out the sweetness."
"A good chewy beer that Im glad I picked up a six of."
"Opinion: This is a very well balanced beer! A lot of Porters tend to be overly roasty and coffee-like. This one has enough to put it into style, yet maintains enough malt complexity to male it very drinkable. There are quite a bit of hops here, but the malt balance makes it all worth while. A very drinkable beer!"
"It pours a dark, creamy brown. Not much to the smell, in my opinion. The mouthfeel is very full, and about as unwatery as you'd like. Every drop seems to have a rich taste. And the taste is excellent - slightly bitter chocolate, a touch of coffee, hints of fruit - maybe plum or apricot (or pluot, actually). The aftertaste lingers, allowing you to contemplate the range of flavors for minutes after each sip - so drink slowly. Goes down easy and is quite fulfilling."
"Wow, this is the best porter I've ever had. It's actually a session porter, you can drink this tirelessly. Pours a typically black with tan head and smells deliciously hoppy and burnt. Contains a slight smoked flavor, a little burnt, and it's so complex that you can't explore all of the flavors in one sitting. I find that once the taste and smell is incoded into my memory, the second session is even more enjoyable. I learn more about it's nuances every time I drink it. A ballsey yet drinkable porter. Expensive but worth it. It doesn't mimic the traditional porter exactly, but it couldn't possibly be mistaken for anything else. The beer is helping to expand the style's horizons. Recommended."
"This is probably my fourth or fifth time treating myself to this beer, and I have to say that I like it more every time I drink it. It pours a dark brown, nearly black color with a reddish hue toward the bottom of the glass. Smell is heavenly: rich rich dark chocolate, coffee, cherry, plum, grapes and a slight medicinal cough syrupy aroma.The taste coincides with the smell: nearly perfect. Sort of reminds me of a big cherry cordial. Mouthfeel is medium/large making it not difficult to drink, but still could easily fill you up. This is one of my favorite porters ever so I pick up a 6er of it for myself whenever nothing new strikes my fancy."
"This is my first anchor beer and look forward to trying the rest of their selection."
"The quintessential American porter."
"Pours a dark brown/mollasses color with a thin head. Roasted malt aromas with hints of caramel and coffee. Flavors of chocolate, roasted malt, bitter coffee and a slight burntness. Hoppy twang in the finish. Another winner by Anchor--Good session porter with a nice balance."
"Pours deep brown to black color with very slight ruby hues ar the edges to show its not black. A 2 finger tan head falls to a modest coating over top of the brew. Lace coats the entire glass as I drink it. Nose is more in the dark fruits than other American porters that I can recall. There is a lesser roasty malt in the background, but the sweet dark fruit is most prominent. Flavor is much more roasty than the nnose. It starts as a nice balance between hearty roasted malt and figgy sweetness, but moves to a slightly chocolate and roasted finish. Very tasty. Feel is thick with a light to moderate carbonation. Very solid beer. It is not staying in my glass very long. This will be high on my radar this fall and winter."
"wow! what a tremendous head! poured this barely trying to obtain any head and got one that was at least three fingers high and left loads and loads of lacing! smells remind me of sweet fruits and malts. tastes creamy and sweet with molasses and figs and lots of other great things! damn this is great. has a medium bodied feel with a fantastic finish and a very sweet feeling is left on the tounge. really great beer!"
"Pours nearly black, with mahogany highlights. The two-finger head has a brown sugar hue, and shows decent retention with lots of sticky lacing. Full chocolate malt and toffe aroma. Rich black patent flavor and unsweetened chocolate leave a bittersweet and dry aftertaste, but it lacks the hop flavor commonly found in american style porters. Residual finish, but the full body and medium carbonation provide a satisfying mouthfeel that make this very easy to drink."
"D- depends on your personal preference here. for me itsjust above average drinkability. i think more then a couple at a time and i would be enough."
"Pours a pitch black with two fingers of dense beige head, good retention. Smell is a slight coffee, bitter chocolate, cocoa, slight floral hops. Taste is a mix of coffee, chocolate, roasted malt, and a bitter dry finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy smooth. This is a very drinkable beer, nice dark chocolate flavor but very drinkable smooth mouthfeel. One of the better porters I've had."
"From a 22oz bottle into my favorite snifter, pours a deep black color that shows no light. Huge, enormous brown head (very dark tan?), rocky and big, fades slowly into lace. Smells of coffee, mocha, tiny bit of chocolate, maybe some sassafras like root beer? Creamy coffee. Tastes of more coffee, more mocha; sweetened coffee; some bitterness in the roast but some sweetness too. Very roasty. Licorice in the finish. Smooth and slightly spritzy mouthfeel. Very, very drinkable!"
"Drinkability -- I'd have another. In fact, I did. The complexity of taste is well balanced. I really savored each sip, and at the finish, looked forward to the next."
"If it wasn't for the bitter/sour hops wash, this beer would be very drinkable. As it is, it's a good sipping beer, and a nice change of pace from the norm for me. Wouldn't make it my daily drinker though."
"This beer is a delight to drink and I will be enjoying it for many years to come."
"Very drinkably for such a great porter, but dont start your meal with it. Forget chocolate mousse, this is all you need for dessert."
"The beer evacuates the 12-ounce brown stubby bottle a deep brown to almost black, the head a light chocolate crown to ride upon that sumptuous dark body, the lace a tight girdle to surround the glass. Nose has a sweet malt aroma, hints of caramel and toasted grains, chocolate tones also present, and start is sweet with a delightful malt presence, the top medium in feel. Finish is delectably acidic; the hops spicy and pleasing with the chocolate malt taste present to the desert dry end, a fine representative to the style and a beer and brewery I can always trust."
"Very drinkable brew, Very tasty and has no real flaws. Not very costly either at $9 a six pack a bargain for a world class beer. Do I like this better than the their Victory ale? I refuse to choose between them."
"Looks and pours like a Guinness, just with a slightly foamier head. Smells and tastes wonderful, like a whiff of Hershey bar hiding a more subtle sloe gin cherry. The texture is a little bit grainy, yet also mellow. Not a harsh note to be found. This is indeed one of the worlds great porters."
"overall: probably my favorite offering from anchor. like most porters, this becomes more appealing after warming, and as drinkable as this is, you better have six."
"This brew pours an opaque black color with a large tan head. The aroma is rather disappointing. The aroma is very matly, but not roasted malt. Some chocolate tones are present, but they are subdued. The taste is sweet with some chocolate flavors. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a bit too much carbonation for my liking. Overall, this beer seems very ordinary to me, and not very good."
"Overall: Wow! I don't remember the last time I had this brew, but it was just amazing last night. Blows just about most porters completely out of the water. And this from a macro micro.."
"Very dry, drinkable porter. Another nice beer from Anchor."
"Impressive porter all around - very drinkable. Recommended."
"A very nicely balanced porter that I could easily drink all night long. More please."
"I do like it!"
"This is a very black porter. No light passes through this. very little head, but maybe I poured it to cautiously. The aroma is great. There is sweet malts, fruit and licorice. The taste is even better. There is chocolate, more like bakers cocoa. actually its like chocolate covered cherries. Licorice, molasses, and sweet vanilla. The mouth feel is light and silky. very little carbination. The after taste is exceeedingly pleasant. A top notch porter."
"Virtually black with a tan head. Licorice is the dominant aroma here, with other malty notes of roasted nuts and caramel. There's tons of licorice flavor too, with some chocolate flavors also entering the picture. There's a bit of soft fruit in there as well. Good mouthfeel and a long satisfying finish Great stuff."
"I've tried this beer a few times now and have to say I really enjoy it. Its a rich black color with almost a caramel colored head, average dissipation time. The taste is thick with the characteristic burnt notes of the porter with definate chocolate hints. Very great beer to drink for any occasion, I've used it to take a few friends now to the ""next level"" and each one has really enjoyed it."
"A wonderful example of a porter..I have to wonder why I have never had this beauty before. This is an American classic every bit as much astheir Liberty Ale."
"Very drinkable though a tad pricey."
"Drinkability: Good all around solid beer. Good balance to flavors and nice feel on the palate. I was very impressed with this beer. Nice and tasty."
"Good mouthfeel."
"OVERALL COMMENTS: Really nothing to complain about; great nose, wonderful mouthfeel, terrific example of a fruity porter."
"Went back to check the code on the bottle: it says 4G5, meaning August 5th of 2004. I didn't notice anything off, so I'd say this beer holds up pretty well nearly a year after being bottled. I'll have to try to find a fresher sample sometime to compare."
"Nice brown and lasting head leaving laces and a coffeblack beercolor. Nice arome giving loads of roastmalt, caramel and next to that good fruityness with lots of banana but also a litle citrussy. Overal complex but fresh nose. Taste is fully burnt, malty again caramellic but also sweet and bitter. Roast is hanging majorly with good bitterness next to it. Litle too sweet IMO but great oily and coffee mouthfeel that's quiet easy drinkable and overal a good beerIMO."
"Appearance is nearly black with crimson highlights. A creamy-brown head reduces to sticky foam. Aroma has cherry, roasted malt and raisins. Initial taste contains a sweet malt, molasses, dark chocolate, lemon, and herbal hops. Carbonation is good. It finishes with roasted malts and coffee. Wow! Great complexity and one of the best porters out there!"
"The last time I had this classic was at the brewery's own tap room after a tour. Very fresh and very good. Let's see how a well-traveled bottle compares. Pours a forbiddingly dark brown, sealed by a solid inch of clingy, sandy brown head that lasts a while. Aromas of roasted barley, dark chocolate, and sweetish raisins/toffee are offset by a smooth mocha coffee bitterness. Rich roasted malt flavors up front. Smooth, chocolatey, perfectly sweet, with a hint of smoke. Very nice. Sweetness is near-perfectly balanced by a big wave of hop bitterness. I can almost taste the resin through the roasted coffee. Finish stays bitter, but with latent milk chocolate and toffee sweetness. Medium-full bodied with a smooth feel. One of the best porters I've ever had."
"Overall - an excellent porter, very drinkable. Another great brew from a Anchor..."
"Crap ! Another no date bottle, oh well. Still a nice black with tan head pour Very malty aroma and taste ..but the it had a funky sour dough finish. Still tangy with a little bite to it.. Thick and rich, overall a good one to quaff .BUT ! Worked on an Avery Porter before this one and it wins my head to head completion."
" Very smooth, tasty."
"Drinkability: Maybe it's just me, but I can't see this one as one to drink more than one of at a time. Could be the stout-y hints, but it's just a bit too heavy to drink in multiples. I'm switchin' to an IPA after this one!"
"Clear, dark, chocolatey brown, nearly opaque, with very deep ruby highlights. Dense, light brown head with great retention and generous lacing. Roasted malts and toffee maltiness dominate the aroma, with a bit of dark, ripe fruits thrown in for good measure. Ripe fruitiness similar to dates and figs hits the palate first, quickly followed by a chocolately, roasted maltiness. Moderate bitterness that blends very well with the dark malts. Rich, creamy texture with a bit of grain dryness. A very enjoyable porter that really shines as it warms up a bit."
"This is a very good beer. A dark black color with hints of red in it, smells of coffee and sweetness, a very complex beer with many flavors, honestly, my first true porter, like a stout with more of a nutty and maybe more hoppier than a stout i think, very good."
"Overall, not a bad porter. Very flavorful yet just not what I am looking for. If you like hopy beer with hints of alcohol, give this one a try."
"Small brown bottle with freshness code you need to decipher. Dark rich brown color with creamy head. Good lacing all the way down. This is such a smooth beer. Creamy chocolate taste and just the slightest hints of roasted bitter and hop flavors. Sweeter as it gets warm. A perfect porter and a great session beer I love to drink."
"Finished the bottle with a couple of very very dark chocolate italian truffles, great pairing"
"Pours a deep black color and has a nice thick tan head. It's aroma is of chocolate, coffee, and molasses. The taste is very sweet, a mixture of chocolate and caramel with a bite from the roasted malts, but not much for hops on the tongue. This is a well balanced, full bodied porter and definitely one of the best."
"Poured a deep dark brown, with a tan head. Toasty aroma, full of coffee, roasted malts and dark fruits. Smooth, easy drinking porter. Full, flavourful and satisfying. Roasted malt, coffee, hops and finishes dry. A great session porter. Very enjoyable."
"Damn, this a one smooth drinkin' porter here. Pours out to the color of coffee with a medium brown head. Helluva start. Odors of coffee and hops were present, with an earthy overtone masking the alcohol. Very nice mouthfeel, quite smooth and thick, and a touch on the creamy side. Flavors of coffee bean, earth, chocolate and mild spice were present, along with a bitterness on the finish. This is a good porter. Recommended."
"So perfect, that I will be happy if it was the only beer available drink."
"Anchor porter looks identical to the last beer I had, Sierra Nevada Stout. It has a jet black body, and a big tan head. Smells malty and acidic, slight coffee tones. Taste is chocolate and coffee, a slight bit of staleness and acidity, but I think this adds to the character of the beer. A delicious beer, doesnt overpower you like some Baltics can do, this is a nice, non-threatening porter."
"I'd definitely buy Anchor Porter again."
"Great brew, probably not something I'm going to always have in stock but it's a good change of pace."
"It was a better than average beer, but pretty run of the mill as porters go."
"From Anchor's distinctively shaped bottle flows this black porter. Head is quick to rise up and then settles a bit, its tan frothiness resting above the beer. Smell is sweeter than I would have expected. First noticed is the caramel and toffee and little bit of dark fruit. Chocolate and a hint of coffee are also present, with a faint whiff of alcohol. Taste is very rich and creamy. Bittersweet chocolate and coffee are first on the palate, along with some roasted grain. Then comes that toffee and caramel sweetness to finish things off in a creamy, sweet, yet roasted manner. Hints of bitter hops peck at the tongue, but never fully show themselves. A smooth and easy drinking American porter."
"this was one awesome porter, probably one of the best I've reviewed in months. Tried it out as part of a 5 ounce flight at the Flying Saucer in Charlotte, appeared a bit lighter than the Lefthand Milk stout sitting next to it. Graet blend of chocolate, caramel, and hazelnut. Very smooth from top to bottom. If this one's around and I'm looking for a dark beer, this will be my choice next time."
"A very fine beer here. It pours a nice rich dark color with a beautiful tan head that sticks around for most of the beer. It smells strongly of coffee and hops. This beer has an incredible thick and heavy yet very smooth mouthfeel. It has a very strong bold taste that really opens your eyes. Some hints of coffee and bitter chocolate are apparent. This beer should be savored, but as each drink continues to get better and better, you'll quickly find yourself in front of an empty glass. Wonderful for a cold winter night, I could drink several of these without ever getting tired of them. Excellent porter."
"This is a very satisfying and rewarding porter. It pours with a great dark chocolate color and a generous dark head. The smell is of chocolate, barley, and a little hops. The beer itself leaves a nice lacing after a quite enjoyable swig of chocolate, bitter sweetness. My only slight issue with this offering is that it is a little on the high side for carbonation, but that could be because the serving temp was a little on the low side. Go out and get this one."
"Nice drinkable beer, but after one or so I find myself looking for something different."
"Nearly pitch black body, and a generous amount of creamy, tan head. A good amount of lacing coats the glass. Wonderful malt aroma, roasted barley, sweet molasas, slight estery aroma too. Sweet and smokey taste up front. Some bitterness comes through at the end, but only enough for some balance. Very full feel in the mouth, and creamy. Leaves the mouth a little dry at the end. Drinkability is excellent, really a great all around brew."
"This could be one of the best Porters available."
"This is great stuff! Attractive bottle, poured ink black. Almost no head at all. This stuff almost smelled like smores. Plenty of chocolate, toffee, semi-sweet chocolate, carmel, coffee, you name it. Just smashing!! A bit more hops in the taste than I'd care for, but in light of everything else, this is just delicious. Smooth, pleasant mouthfeel. Not too heavy. This is great stuff. Brilliant!"
"A very dark brown beer with deep mahogony highlights. Has a big foamy brown head, with some nice lace. There is a good roasted malt aroma with a sweet nut like background.The flavor is full of roasted malt assertiveness. With chocolate and licorice note bouncing off your tongue and a nice bittersweet coffee finish."
"Poured a dark brown with a rich, creamy head that left wonderful lacing. The smell was a very solid, but not incredibly inviting cocoa presence. The taste was pretty good, but was missing an extra kick. The chocolate notes were great, and mixed well with the almost sweet nuttyness, but it needed something else to push it over the edge. The mouthfeel was incredibly lucious and creamy, just like a porter should be. I love my porters, and tonight I got to try the Smuttynose Robust Porter. It's definily better than this one, but this is also a solid choice."
"Smell hints at deep hops, raisins, and smoke. This porter has a medium body, and leaves a slight astringent tinge on the corners of the tongue. Taste is pretty rich, but not overbearing. Strong hop flavor followed by a residual sweetness, almost chocolate like although I'm sure there is no chocolate in it. This is the porter paradigm. A subtle yet complex flavor that is quite drinkable. Well worth a try. Cheers"
"The beer pours very dark and similar to a stout. However, the toffee-colored head does not retain itself as well. The lace is quite sticky and sticks to the edge of the glass. The aroma is of toffee and vanilla. the flavor has just a mild hop kick, but is nicely balanced with the malt. Also present is a very mild chocolate teaser and an unfortunate (but slight) burnt rubber taste. The mouthfeel is just slightly bitter from the hops, but has a very pleasant and satisfying heavy feel. this would make a great beer to introduce a dark beer to someone. Nothing overwhelming, but very mellow and balanced."
"Deep,deep brown color. Borders on black but just not quite there. Good sized head that is gone fairly quickly. Nice,somewhat sweet aroma. Port like. Hints of chocolate,cinnamon and licorice. Big roasty malt flavor. Somewhat grainy. Subtle chocolate in the backround. Theres a ""hashness"" I have always found to this beer-its very slight and underlying but its there. Not unpleasant just a certain characteristic of the brew. Never found it in any other porters. Maybe its how the roasted malt comes thru? Wonderful body. Very full for the abv. A classic beer like almost all the other Anchor products. I havnt had this for ages-need to get it regularly."
"Pours a dark brown with reddish purple tints. Nice tan head that doesn't budge. Sticks around as I write this. Exciting scent. Roasty malts up front with a fruity sweetness and grapey winelike aroma. Bitter hops detectable too, as are notes of sugary plums and berries. The head still hasn't shrank any and I still haven't taken a sip... Nice well balanced and full flavored taste. Toasty malts are there but don't hog all the space. Plenty of room for the bitter hops. Complex flavors. I'm picking up on root beer, creamy milk, sweet plums and other fruits, and maybe just the perfect tiny hint of chocolate. Smooth and creamy medium to full mouthfeel. This is a great example of a session beer that is well balanced yet complex and interesting at the same time. A great example of a porter."
"A classic example of the American Porter, and a homage to its British, and possibly Baltic forebearers. This is choice stuff."
"note: flavor becomes much bolder after warming. i suggest letting it sit for 15-20min before drinking."
"This really tastes more like an sweet stout. Amazing though!"
"This one is good...though a little more stoutness would have helped. Pours deep brown with shards of crimson coming through. Smell is rich and regular for a porter...a little vitaminy maybe. The taste is nice except for the noticeable twang of alcohol in the mix with luscious toasty malts and cannabis-like hops presence. Finish is clean and the mouthfeel is good...really a little too thin for me, though. Drinkability is quite good. I can imagine myself lusting after one all day out in the cold and really relishing it when I returned. Good stuff, as one might expect for this storied brewery; weak for the style."
"Due to the richness of this brew the drinkability is sub average."
"Drinkability- May be the best porter I have had to date. Probably because it tastes more like a stout to me and is really sweet flavored unlike many porters I have had. My fiancee likes this one too, so this may become a staple around the household."
"Overall, a solid offering from Anchor. Definitely one of my favorite porters and I would recommend that everyone give it a try."
"This beer is a great example of why you shouldn't overlook the obvious. Living here in SF, this beer is everywhere, and I'd gotten to the point where I tuned it out. One day after a long, cold ride, looking at the taps, it just seemed right. I was absolutely blown away by the heft and smoothness--I couldn't believe I'd denied myself this pleasure for years. Don't forget the basics, kids."
"One of the American classics, this stuff has been delicious for over 20 years! Standard small bottle sampled, pours almost black with a dark tan head. Moderate lacing. Nose of cocoa. Medium bodied, lucious smooth mouthfeel, creamy on the tongue, rich flavors of coffee, cocoa, taffee and caramel. Lightly hopped, finish is more cocoa, powdered sugar and coffee. Tasty creation, always a good selection"
"This is one of my favorite porters. Rather than being a ""light stout", this beer is full bodied and flavorful with a higher hop presense and less burnt flavors."
"Candy for the eye, the nose and the palate, Anchor Porter should please even the most critical amongst us, it has me."
"Body: Creamy, chewy mouthfeel."
"A deep brown color with a creamy tan head and sticky lacing. The head retention is low, but maintains a decent layer. Smells of malt, caramel roasted grains and coffee, with is a surprising presence of fruitiness. Flavor has a rich sweet start and a roasty hop finish. Palate is medium to full bodied, creamy and effervescent with a full lasting bite at the end. Anchor Porter maintains characteristics of a higher gravity beer with a good balance, and more chutzpa than many others of the style without going extreme."
"This beer goes down very well and is great to just sit and enjoy. High quality."
"Spinnakers in Victoria imports this beer in and my father kindly procured some for me to drink. I had this beer years ago and forgotten how smooth this brew goes down. Big brown head on top of jet black body this is a pretty sight . The real clincher is the coffee and roasted barley nose that hints at the figs and chocalate notes in the first sip. There are very few porters this smooth and balanced and this is a direct relation to Fritz's admonition to qualtiy."
"Cheers"
"appeearance,,nice and dark 2 finger head looks good. Has a licorice smell took me a bit to figure out the smell.Decent mouthfeel not too chunky feeling, not too bubbly.I must say im not too big on the taste. The licorice smell is fine but i think the taste of it is too drawn out,,a little too sweet. Bummer i was expecting good things from this brew."
"Still nowhere near as good as Atlantic Brewing's Coal Porter, but still a valiant effort."
"drink this one again for sure"
"Thin 0.5cm head is foamy, tan, never leaving. Body is dark brown, almost opaque. Aroma is typically porterish with direct barley flavors and a small lactic bite. Rich chocolate and anise flavors. Nice range of fruitiness reminiscent of a dates cake with lots of crust. Palate is thick, oily, sweet. Not much bitterness at all despite a gentle hop hint and apparent faint smokiness. I can understand its high rating, this is everything you want a porter to be. Classy and quaffable."
"Mouthfeel is good and carbonation is not overwhelming. It goes down smooth and hits the spot...pretty much perfect for the style. Drinkability is good and this would make a tasty session if I was in the mood. If you enjoy porters, this one is worthy of a try."
"Pours a very dark brown almost black. Head is light and a creamy brown color. Smells slightly of coffee and roasted malt with a fruity aroma too that I can't identify. No noticeable hop aroma. Tastes are heavy on roasted malt, with a slight hint of coffee and raisins. Hops are not noticeable until toward the end and then just a little bitterness that gradually gives way to a slight malty sweetness. This beer has an extremely interesting finish with an ongoing battle of the taste buds - bitter hops, no sweet malt, no bitter hops, nope sweet malt... A very enjoyable brew I'll come back to."
"This is a damn tasty brew - full of roasty flavours and chocolate flavours, quite smoothly done. Nice winey quality - with just a hint of soft fizz. A very pleasant and easy drinking porter - not complex or demanding, just plain old fashioned tasty. Very enjoyable."
"Wonderful brew! Not sure why I chose it off the menu at Bukowski's, but I'm certainly glad I did. Great looking beer, rich dark color, with a chocolate milk looking head. Sweet, fruity smell and deep rich taste. Substantial body and mouthfeel, yet suprisingly drinkable. I will be looking for this one again in the very near future and expect it to become a winter staple for me."
"It has a very nice creamy mouthfeel and great drinkability."
"This is a regular in my cooler."
"One of my alltime favorite porters. It packs lots of deep flavors including roasted malt, chocolate, caramel, with a pinch of hops for bitterness and fragrance. It pours with a thick brown head that just sits there over a mysterious brown almost black body of flavor. The flavors swirl all around the tongue and fade with a bit of hoppy aftertaste. I also love it in a bottle. I always recommend it as a classic dark beer."
"here's what i love about anchor brewing: they don't try to brew anything weird like dfh or over the top like stone (not that there's anything wrong with either of those things), but rather, they concentrate on simply brewing world-class, damn tasty brews that are very faithful to their respective styles. the anchor porter is no exception. it pours a dark as hell brown to black colour with a big ole foamy off-white head. the aroma is off chocolate, malt, burnt wood, earth and a touch of caramel. simply solid and good all around. the flavour is spot on for a porter: it's big but not huge nor overwhelming. there's also a nice creamy texture to this one. the creaminess is mostly chocolate in nature and is complimented by a nice dose of burnt/roasted malt flavour. caramel is intermingled here and there as well as a touch of coffee and alcohol. spot on flavour, for the most part. i really have no complaints about this brew whatsoever. it may soon become a regular in my fridge."
"Nice velvety brownish head, dense and lasting, on a very dark purple/mahogany color. The smell is complex and interesting: some fine chocolate trufle, some vinous notes of porto, and hints of overripe red fruits. The taste reproduces this complexity: chocolate and coffee have a deep effect on the tongue and the palate, being very smoky and roasted. A certain saltiness bites the tongue and makes this beer reminiscent of the sea(?), light hints of coconut announce the more fruity aspects of the brew together with sweet notes of citrus. Mouthfeel is great, sharp and consistent. Greatly robust and woody. A bit doughy. Nicely hoppy too. A pretty intense experience. It's like this beer were saying ""there'll be no white flags and no peace talks"". It doesn't let up. This is a beer for fighters, hunters and lovers. It probably doesn't fit in my favorite beers category, but I can definitely appreciate its qualities."
"Pours a deep ruby brown with a volumnous light tan head. Served at about 55 degrees. Nose is toffee, coffee-ish and roasty malts; slight hoppy undercurrent, but predominantly malty and rich smelling, with a slight notion of toasted marshmallow. Roasty malt astringency hits the palate first, then the dark malts and light berry notes kick in, and finishes off with a slight hop dryness and further suggestions of chocolate and coffee. One of the better domestic porters out there. Flavors meld together well, especially at cellar temperature. Very smooth and enjoyable. Subtler carbonation is appropriate for this beer. I've done some vertical tastings between English porters and American counterparts, and I always seem to prefer the aggressive roasty maltiness of the domestic porters. I guess I'm just a patriot..."
"Really never a dull moment drinking this beer."
"Pours a thick, dark color with a short, brown head, but a small amount hangs around. Nice chocolate, malty aroma and very little coffee. Low carbonation, but it's there. The flavor is mostly comprised of a malty, chocolaty flavor - very similar to the aroma. Roasted malts with an even bitterness. Very good and extremely smooth. One of my favorite porters to date."
"Overall Impression: Im in the mood for a dark rich beer, and I sure found one. Great full taste, well balanced, roasted but not burnt. Its filling as well, so it is tough to go for drinkability. This 1 pt. 6 oz. will scratch my beer itch nicely, but I could see revisiting this one again. A great American Porter, but not the best."
"Very nice beer."
"pours a beautifuk black with a fluffy tan head that leaves a good dose of lacing. Smells of toased malt with hints of caramel, coffee, toffee and fruit. Smells creamy and tasty. Taste is sweet malt flavor followed by lightly burnt malt with touches of caramel and coffee flavors. Finishes lightly bitter coffee flavors and hops. This is one good medium full bodied brew a nice solid porter. Drinkability is great this is a fine porter forgot how good it was, will not forget again!"
"This is fine, fine beer."
"i know i will be the only ""bad"" review for this beer but i just didnt like it. looks nice, semlls nice, but i cant agree witht he taste. thick, but thick isnt always bad. just a bit too strong for my taste, maybe, but i like other dark beers, i am just unable to reconcile this taste as good in my mind."
"Big ,dark, bubbly volcano of brown to black lava. Massive foamball which threatened to explode from the glass. Malty, chocolatey aromas that fill your nose. Tastes of malt, coffee, chocolate, somewhat sweet with mild counterbalancing bitterness. Quite a taste experience. I, however would not want to drink many of these robust beers."
"I'd rank this as the best, traditional porter beers. As for my favorite porter, I respect the craft. Drinkablilty was only a 4 because I wouldn't enjoy more than one at a time in a sitting."
"Now I know why its their best rated beer. A superior porter, with all of the Anchor creamy easy on mouth mouthfeel/flavour. One of the few porters I desire again. Mocha bittersweet rather than chocolate and still rich, not too toasty coffee. Just easy and smooth. Roast, anise nice at end of meal, carbonation on tongue as it sooths it."
"Recommended."
"This really is what a porter should taste like!"
"Drinability- Too filling for more than a couple, but still a really great beer. Throughout drinking the appeal of Anchor Porter increases on my pallate. Not something I'd usually go for (a little too chocolatey and rich for me), but I still recognize a great beer."
"This is my fav beer from the group at Anchor Steam. It was a nice rich chocolatey smell, with a tinge of hops, and the heaviness of malt there as well. The big thing was the chocolate though. The head was a pillowy/frothy beast that lasted a long time and left a nice impression on me over it. The taste was another good part to the brew. It was similar to the smell, but wasn't as strong on the chocolate, and rather blended and balanced out well. As for drinkability, it was hard to put it down. I couldn't get enough of it."
"Roasted coffee flavors are the first to appear followed by burnt raisins and chocolate finish. An odd blend of flavors which make for an ok beer, but not one I would pursue in the future."
"Pours a deep dark brown with a little foamy tan head that dissolves fairly soon. Smells smoky, coffee, carmel, and a hint of dried fruits. All in all, the smell says, ""Drink me!"". Tastes of carmel, coffee, roasted malts, and a sweet finish bombards your taste buds. This is just a great porter. Really bummed to see the bottom of the glass. I rank this up there as one of the best. There's a reason why this continues to be the classic example of a porter."
"It's hard to drink more than of these at a sitting but I'll look forward to having one six day in a row."
"Some very complex tastes and smells come from this one. Licorice and bready flavors with a unique bittersweet aftertaste."
"Smell reminded me of smoked wood. First taste of this beer had a real alcohol aftertaste that i was not too fond of. This beer got better as it warmed up. Lots of cocoa, faint hints of rum and fruit. Very round mouthfeel- balanced. Seems like a decent beer, but one I couldn't drink too many of. I wish I liked this beer more...just not my cup of tea...er...beer."
"A very dark blackish/brown (coffee) color with a small cream tan head. Suprisingly not much lacing left on glass. Smells of smoked wood chips on a grill, earth tones and of course the roasted malt, mocha tone. Maybe a hint of honey or molasses. Taste is of grilled mocha chips and slight molasses. The malt sweetness is a flurish and the hops are a perfect balance to balance out the sweet taste. Full bodied and creamy porter, a drinkable porter for a dessert or with a meal, goes great with ice cream, couldn't drink more than 1 of these 22 oz bottles."
"This is most likely the most complex porter Ive sampled to date. Its deep, sweet, fruity, and robust.Excellent!"
"s.d."
"good value and very tasty. Will definitely be back for more. It tastes liek a perfect dessert beer, and it's priced to drink regularly."
"Thanks nvsblman for this one!"
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"The taste is wonderful - a full bodied, rich almost dessert beer. It is a great combination of chocolate malts, prune, and coffee-style bitters. The beer moves slowly over the tongue and swallows like a creamy milk stout. This beer was wonderful and I immediately ordered another one."
"Best porter I've ever had -- full of character, depth, thoroughly interesting."
"Very nice nose on this beer. Sweet notes. Not so much chocolate or roasty in the nose. Some good caramel notes. Flavor is very nice, but I couldn't tell it was a porter. Very subdued chocolate and/or roasted flavors. I taste a lot more caramel or maybe munich malts than dark ones. Very little hops, nice sweet finish with just a touch of darker malts behind the tongue. Really has a nice body as well, very smooth. Very drinkable."
"Very dark brown with a smallish, creamy brown head that soon fades to a thin film. Smell is sweet roasted malts. Taste is roasted malt, mild dark chocolate notes, with an earthy, herbal hop bitterness at the finish. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Dry finish. Overall, a very good example of an American Porter. I'd buy it again!"
"I'm impressed. I'm a lover of IPAs and I like Anchor Liberty Ale, but Anchor Porter just might be the better beer. It hits all the right notes from start to finish."
"Anchor is really starting to grow on me. When I first tasted their steam beer, it took awhile to get used to the taste. Now that I had their porter beer, I might actually their barleywine, (I dislike barleywines though). This poured out a nice black color with a head that went away quickly. First thing that hits the nose is the toffee and caramel. Perhaps a hint of butterscotch as well, but very faint. Taste is superb. Nice roasted malts make up this brew. Some toffee is also present, but not much. It's also very smooth and creamy. Probably rivals the Taddy Porter for one of the best porters out there."
"A dark, brown to black pour with slight reddish tinge when held to the light, almost opaque. The dark tan head is large and the tannish lacing pronounced. The aroma is one of chicory and coffee with a slight caramel undertone. The main taste is a big hit of grainy malt with definite coffee flavors. This is a thick, wonderful beer in the mouth. I very well brewed porter. One that tastes good at first drop and improves as it warms. It almost demands a second."
"I have to admit I am a big fan of Anchor products. I don't think I have had one I did not like. They were also a great tour stop a few years back."
"Fantastic porter, perfectly balanced in every way."
"The pour was excellent, very dark brown bordering on black with a nice one inch head that faded to a light ring of foam. The smell was very malty lots of sweet overtones, very slight burnt sugar smell. The taste is where this porter left alot of others in the dirt. Very sweet start and just the right amount of hop bite in the middle followed by a clean sweet finish. This may be the best porter I've ever tasted. A very drinkable beer, very refreshing."
"Overall a fine porter to be enjoyed again sometime."
"The flavor is rich and dominated by malty chocolate and roasted malt hits. Again faint earthy hops come through. This brew is incredibly smooth and easy to drink. Glad I grabbed one of these."
"The mouthfeel is smooth and carbonation levels were nice. This is a medium bodied beer. Great drinkability as I could have several of these in a session. One of my favorite porters."
"Very enjoyable beer as a desert or nightcap. Complex, big and flavourful, easy to pin down its different smell and flavour components. Gains a great deal of complexity as it warms from cellar temp. to room temp. I have two left... will miss them when they're gone (not available in Montréal! That's a crime)"
"Pours a black color and is topped by a thick, creamy, paper-grocery-bag brown colored head. Sweet roasted malt, molasses, coffee, and chocolate aromas emanate from my glass. A medium level of body and a fruity sweetness marry well with the other flavors that are in the beer. Roasted notes are here but somewhat subdued, notes of chocolate, and lots of dark fruit are here as well. A very well integrated porter that I can always count on and enjoy. Early on this was one of the best porters out there, and it still can hold its own against todays contenders for the porter crown."
"if there's a better version of a plain porter out there, i've yet to try it. an exceptional beer that gets high marks for its overall flavor, body, and drinkability. a winner for sure."
"This is a really nice tasting porter and has a great feeling when it slides on down your throat. When poured it is a nice dark beer with a pretty good lasting head. The taste stays strong to a porter and just is really tasty. You can taste the malt all throughout the beer and it has a good blend of hops thrown into it to level it out just right. This is my idea of a great porter."
"Another solid beer from Anchor. Deep dark color, thick tan head, nice lace. Subtle roasted flavor complimented by restrained bitterness. Chewy mouthfeel yet not filling. A very nice drinkable porter. I prefer the taste of this beer to say Fullers or Deschutes."
"The initial impression is a very silky smooth and rich mouthfeel, allowing the roasted malts to really assert themselves. There is a light carbonation that interestingly allows the aftertaste to cling for a substantial period of time. This is a robust, very tasty porter, with very nice roasted malt tastes, and a bit of hops to add a wee bit of balance. Nicely done."
"Medium body, smooth, light bite, great the first time, and great after you've had a few."
"This is the porter to drink, one of the best that I have been able to find. For me this is a brew that I hold other Porters to, and not many have been able to match it!"
"This was a bit fruitier than I expected from a porter, and not quite as robust as the Sierra Nevada Porter. Still, this is a very drinkable beer from a reputable brewery. Not my top porter, but I would heavily recommend this to anyone who appreciates a good porter or stout."
"If you drink any Porter this is the one. Why waste your time on some Imported English Porter in a skunky clear bottle or some over hopped American version. This fits right in the middle between the two."
"A black color with brown hues and a thick creamy tan head that left a nice lace around the glass. The head faded quickly which was unfortunate. A sweet chocolate aroma with a bit of roasted toffee. The taste is very sweet and mellow with a great blend of roasted malts and a toffee/coffee flavor. This is a very rich beer that has a great chocolate taste as the beer warms a bit. There is a nice aftertaste of all the flavors blended together. An excellent porter in my mind. Anchor doesn't disappoint very often."
"A great Porter from a great brewery!"
"A dark brown almost black brew. Has a brownish head that disappears quickly, leaving a thin head. It has a roasted fruity smell. The taste is roasted with a hint of dried fruit and a large bitterness. A bitterness i like in a porter. This is a nice beer and could be eaven better if it had some more of the roasted taste in it."
"This beer poured with almost exactly a two fingered head into my nonic pint glass. The color of the head was tan...it looked ""dirty"" but in a good way! The beer was black. When held up to light, I couldn't notice any light penetrating the beer, which is impressive but can be boring. I generally like to see some sort of penetration with a porter. It smelled like a chocolate milkshake...very malty and sweet and wonderful. The taste was very similar to the smell, no surprises when it hits your toungue. It is all malt out of the gate, chocolate kicks in about midway through, and I believe a tiny hop presence asserts itself as you slide into the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is very creamy and thick. The carbonation seemed a little high for a porter, but I didn't mind it at all...it contributed to a wonderful beer. A few months ago I said I had never had a regular Porter that really blew my socks off, but that I never hated one either. Well, the Anchor Porter blew my socks off. It is truly World Class and I could drink these all night."
"The beer pours a thick dark black color with a thick tan head that lasts. The aroma is awesome. It is quite chocolatey with black and roasted malts. The taste is also exceptional. It is thick and rich. It has a roasted malty flavor that hangs on after swallowing. There is a chocolate hint and a creamy finish; very good. The mouthfeel is near perfect. It is a full bodied beer with the right amount of carbonation. This beer is a great drinker. One of the best porters I've ever had."
"Taste is dry, mild, and clean. Smokey and nutty malt flavors are dominant, but the beer itself is relatively mild, in a good way. Slightly stronger than a nut brown, and quite pleasing. A great beer for sipping while not working."
"Poured out a very dark mahogany brown color with tints of deep orange shining through when held up to the light. Beautiful whipped cream-like tan head. The aroma is very appealing with roasted chocolates, fermented fruits and dark black cherries. The taste is excellent and complex  there are plenty of different things coming out of this porter. Fruity, roasted caramel and a sweet nuttiness, molasses and brown sugar, even candy apples. Medium bodied that is syrupy, but not overly sweet. The finish is a pleasant one, somewhat dry and semi-sweet that leaves you wanting more. A beautiful porter."
"Dark brown, almost black in color with a two finger thick head of a tan colour. Smelled of toffee, coffee, chocolate and caramel. Kind of a floral scent also. The taste, to me was smokey and more refined than what I'm used to. A smooth one all the way down. There was a distinct mocha taste also. I have been drinking a lot of porters and stouts, so I've become very used to these tastes. I really enjoyed this beer. My buddy didn't like it, but oh well. Nobody's perfect."
"Pours with a thick, tightly beaded head about a finger deep whose consistent density starts to clump a bit; leaves an oozy lacework the color of light toast. Beer's color is dead black, but rubyish mahogany highlights appear when held to light. Very appetizing toffee malt and sweet molasses aroma; some warmth and agitation bring out smells of caramel sugar, cinnamon, chocolate buttercream, even smoky maple syrup--White Russian cocktails(?)--all wrapped in a creamy, tactile body. I'm spending as much time smelling as I am tasting! Flavor, wow! more smoky, sweet molasses rush the palate; subdued coffee in the middle becoming more pronounced; markedly nutty--chocolate and hazelnuts?--marzipan even??--; coffee and cream finish, with just enough hops dancing around to hold everything together. Mouthfeel is near fluffy in character, just hugs the tongue; a bit sweet and filling for session drinking, but how about that flavor! This may be going for $10 a sixer but it's already become one of my pet beers this winter. Recommended."
"Drinkability: Have been searching for a stunning porter... this may be the one that I judge all others against. I will return to this often."
"are all over the place with a fine finish."
"This is a nice, solid porter. It looks good coming out of the bottle with a nice head which goes down somewhat quickly. It isn't the smoothest porter I've had and it seemed a bit lacking in the mouthfeel department. It's lack of smoothness decreased in its drinkability for me, but I would definitely give this another try. All in all, solid, but it did not seem incredible."
"1 pt. 6 oz. brown bottle. Pours jet black with a nice, abundant tan head. Sweet malty, somewhat syrupy (maple) aroma, with coffee. Some alcohol. Nice, smooth mouthfeel that turns slightly crisp. Medium bodied. Malty sweetness, some toasted, burnt malts. Nice, subtle herbal hops. Burnt caramel aftertaste. This is a nice American porter, definitely one of the better ones. If I were someone who drank porters all the time, I'd come back to this one pretty often."
"Actually, Anchor porter had pretty good drinkability once I was able to put that rubbing alcohol smell to the back of my awareness. Anchor Porter is one I'd like to try on-tap sometime."
"Poured with a big Chocolate soda looking head, chocolately carmel aroma, chocolate first taste, smooth creamy tongue feel, and then the pleasant malt sweetness takes it home, doesnt have that lousy bitter alcohol aftertaste. What kept it from being perfect was that it was just a tad thin for a porter. I've already restocked"
"This was a very good beer all the way through. Apperance was nice with a nice off white head and a deep dark burgundy color. It smelt of malt, coffee, and chocolate. It was pretty mild but flavorful. Had this as a nightcap and it was wonderful. Good mouthfeel, nice ""porter"" consitency. Very drinkable with the low ABV and the wonderful flavor."
"Fairly complex and shape-shifting for a porter, it could be smoother and well-integrated for my tastes, but thats because I like porters smooth and savory with a lower hop profile. Nice session mouthfeel, as this beer truly falls down your throat with unmentionable ease. A very good choice if you like NW hops in your porter."
"Arrived at table in a 23 ounce glass black as tar. The light showing through the glass had a slight reddish tint in the black beer. The head lasted throughout the sample and let lacing on the glass. The aroma was hops, fruity with hints of roasted/chocolate. The flavor is roated and hoppy bitterness. Also you find chocolate in the flavor. Those flavors last into a smooth bitterness that makes it hard to decide if the finish is bitter due to hops or due to roated. The body is good and the drinkabiltiy is good as well."
"Haven't picked any of this up in years. Not the best but a great robust big porter."
"It opens with a distinct wallop of malts on the nose. Slight hints of fruit are there, but the roasted malts soon overwhelm any other tastes. Bitter at first, it evened out over the course of the mug. Sample pours with a creamy head that didn't hang around as long as I would have liked. Taste was dominated by the malts, the roasted grains lending rich character to the beer. Mouthfeel was awesome. This beer has an incredible natural carbonation. Drinkability was good, but I'd have a hard time downing more than two or three of these at a sitting. It's a fine beer to appreciate, but the malts would begin to overwhelm me over time."
"Very good porter."
"Thick tan head that leaves a little bit of lace on the glass as it subsides slowly. This beer is black with a hint of ruby light that can be seen when you hold this up to the light. Aroma is rich with dark carmel malt and a touch of chocolate. Taste is rich and smooth which begins with dark sweet malt that is covered in a dry chocolate which balances perfectly. The mouthfeel is perfect as it gives this brew a smooth creamyness during the initial taste and also adds a bit of flavor to linger on the tongue which makes you want to take another drink. Very high drinkability as this is a very flavorful session beer that goes down well with only an average level of alcohol."
"There was a knock on the door...so I opened the door slowly, and there was this dark ebony-colored woman there...staring straight at me and foaming at the mouth a bit. I didn't know what to think, so I collected my senses and ""took in"" the situation slowly. I could smell something nice, kind of caramel-like, or like toffee. I suspected it was her perfume? I mean she looked rather pleasant despite the foaming, so why couldn't she have toffee perfume on her? I don't know why, but I felt I should lick her to test my theory...so I did! My mouth was instantly filled with a rich syrupy flavor of the same coffee (and maybe chocolate too?), that I'd smelled. It was simply wonderful! I felt I was transported to Heaven, but realized a moment later she had slapped me on the head and had started runing away. I ran after her, my tongue wagging like a hot dog...I wanted to drink all I could from her chocolaty chalice! But she was faster than me and got away. Now, whenever I wanted to be transPORTERed to a better place, I think of her and the pamphlets she left on my doorstep as she ran away leaving me longing for her. She was in a class by herself."
"A stellar porter. I kick myself for walking by it at the store so many times."
"Mmmm.. another great offering from Anchor. Beautiful almost black color with a nice head.... Some lacing ..Nice malty aroma....taste was extremely balanced with no excessive malt or hops...nice mouthfeel...extremely smooth....drinkability was above average."
"Had this on tap at The Flying Saucer in Addison Texas. Arrived in a pint glass. Very dark brown with a tan head. Not much head, but a little. Smelled of dark ripe fruit and roasted dark malt. Tasted much the same. Very sweet ripe fruit up front with a roasted dark malt back bone. Rich and creamy mouthfeel. Very full bodied. I like this porter. Not the greatest I've had, but it's good. I think I prefer this from the bottle, and next time I get it I'll review the bottle, but this was still good. Maybe it was a little outdated and that's why it wasn't as good, I don't know, but alas, still a tasty brew."
"pours out almost complete black with a small brown head that leaves a nice lace. smells of sweet molasses, chocolate and fruits. a nice fruity taste (figs) teamed with a sweet molasses/burnt chocolate flavor and little hops for a slight spicy kick. nice and smooth mouthfeel with good carbonation that makes the toungue tingle. awesome beer with some real strong flavors going on. good stuff."
"This is the brew that comes to mind when I think of Porter. Surprisingly drinkable for something so rich. A little on the sweet side for my tastes, but a solid offering nonetheless."
"This beer came well recommended and it did not let me down at all. It poured a very dark brown with a nice big brown head that lasted quite awhile before leaving a nice lace around the glass. The smell was more on the chocolate side but still had a little coffee scent as well. The taste had a slight smokyness to it that was very pleasing and the burnt chocolate flavors really stood out for me. The mouthfeel was a bit thinner than I was expecting from a beer that poured this thick, but it was very nice. This is one of the most drinkable porters I have had and I will most definantly get it again."
"In conclusion- I could drink quantities Anchor Brewings porter everyday without tiring of it."
"The aromas translate almost identically to the taste. Very nice blend of sweet malty toffee, hops, cocoa, and coffee. Not bitter at all, prominent display of malts. Sweet to an enjoyable level. Smooth, almost effortless consumption - perfect carbonation. So quaffable and oh so enjoyable. To find a better porter will be quite an achievement!!"
"Poured a dark brown with ruby highlights. Danse light brown head formed quickly and eventually settled into a nice sized ring. Sweet prune and plums in the aroma. Flavor reminded me of dry roasted coffee with a hint of chocolate. Left a drying bitterness on the sides of the tongue. Medium bodied... almost medium-full."
"I poured it and was shocked by the red/dark brown color, a thick tan head formed as the silky smoothie liquid settled the taste was almost thick and chewy the lightly burnt malt mixed with the perfect balance of hoppes made this one creamy beer. The was a slight fading toffee taste that lingered in the finish. I would definitely go back for seconds!!"
"This is my first Anchor. It certainly will not be the last."
"This brew is the quintessence of good porter. Nothing unusual or unique, but instead takes the standards and does them to perfection. A lot of beers could learn from this one."
"A superb porter, among the best I've sampled. Poured a deep dark black with a rapidly dissipating tan head. Smell is of dark fruit toasty malt and dark chocolate. Flavor is a delightful mix of toasted malt and dark chocolate, with a little bit of raisin lingering in the background, finishing with a delightful dryness. The mouthfeel was very creamy, and I would rate this as one of the most drinkable porters I've encountered."
"This is a good american beer, worth having."
"Anchor porter is a well balanced and very flavorful porter. It has a nice dark amber tint and a great feel in the mouth. I love the way Anchor packages its products and the labels just make it look like a quality beer, and it is. Pour this one into a nice glass and enjoy."
"my frst Anchor brew...not as thick as many other Porters, but by no means watered down....Coffee taste and smell, but an oddly potent taste of alcohol, it might sound like a negative, but it isn't really potent as much as it is more noticable the in most beers...overall a good beer, and easy to drink, but not the best of porters..."
"Dar, dark brown with garnet coming out where the light can get through. A brown head sits atop, but quickly settles. Aroma is faint, but smells of molasses and fig. Flavor is sweet coffee and brown sugar, with raisin and prune. Finishes with some molasses flavor and a bitter coffee and raisin flavor lingers. The aftertaste sweetens and warms the back of the mouth with dark brown sugar. Very well-balanced and smooth, with moderate carbonation and smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Too bad I have just this one bottle."
"ng"
"Dark, shiny, deep brown color. Nice huge foamy fluffy beige head, creamy and about a 1"" thick. Great looking beer in a pint glass. Full roasted bitter smell. Subtle smooth bittersweet chocolate as well. Super smooth taste is a combination of the same bittersweet chocolate and snappy hop bitterness to clean things up. Carmel and toffee sweetness also add to the flavor experience. Sweetness and bitter hop smack seem perfectly balanced to me. Just the right touch of roasted bitterness as well. Sharp bitterness and soothing chocolate finish, with hints of toffee as well. Tastes and smells erupted as the glass sat a bit. Medium to full bodied.Very good beer, and one worth trying. I have passed over buying this many times, thinking I would eventually enjoy it someplace on tap. I should have never waited so long. An american classic."
"The mouthfeel is very good. Not too heavy with a crisp finish. Easy drinking. Enjoy. I feel Anchor is a very underrated brewery. Give this porter a try."
"This has a nice mouthfeel to it, although the carbonation buts into the smoothness a little, diminishing the thickness of the beer. Not quite ""chewable"" but it certainly manages to fill the mouth. As far as drinkability, this one is a killer. No trouble working down a bomber of this real quick, and I would go for more if only I had the forsight to stock up. Oh well. All in all, excellent stuff."
"Pours an opaque brown with reddish coffee highlights. A creamy beige head falls to thin cap and remains. A great nose on this one. Very complex, with herbal, lemon notes, cocoa powder, dark chocolate and olives, cherries, and some smoky/peatiness. On palate, that west-coast dryness matched with deep, wine-like flavors of chocolate covered cherries, cocoa, bitter chocolate, roasty espresso, fruit (plums, cherries). Mouthfeel is silky smooth. Finish is tangy, long and dry with notes of fruit and chocolate. Bitterness throughout was perhaps a tad too pronounced, but overall a wonderfully characterful American porter."
"This is an excellent porter. From its opaque dark color to its rich, brown, creamy head, I've never had a better porter out of a bottle. A fairly strong and somewhat sweet malt aroma rose from my glass. The taste is a complex blend of roasted malts and residual malt sweetness, with the faintest touch of hop bitterness playing off of the malt flavors. A full mouthfeel was very welcome, although if it hadn't been served so gosh darn cold I would have appreciated it more. Personally, I would have preferred just a touch more hops, but that might make it out of character for a porter. This is one of the most drinkable porters around and I would recommend it to any first time porter drinkers."
"Comments  I would have preferred a little more complexity and a heavier body for this one, but its still an all around good brew. I think this would be a great porter for introducing a friend to the style."
"Mmmm good. Pours to a 1/2 inch light brown head. Brilliant ruby color. Aroma suggests licorice and banana with a hint of roasted malt. Flavor conforms with licorice and banana flavors intermingled with sweet malt and roasted grains and enough hops to balance it all out. finishes roasty with a residual roasted bitterness on the tongue...yum."
"A very good looking body covered with very little head and little lace. The body is very dark mahoghany with very nice ruby highlights. The small head appeared to be off-white, but it was inconsequential in any case. The nose is small, but of chocolate, perhaps a small hint of roast nuts. The taste is very pleasant and definitely provides nut overtones throughout. The feel is too light and watery. Overall this is a pleasant, but not a great porter."
"This beer pours beautifully dark with a thick, thick head. The head stood up a good quarter of an inch out of the glass with out overflowing over the edge, quite a site. The flavor was very smooth, rich in toffee with a slightly hoppy finish. I would have had another if the lucky find of their porter had not peaked my interest in the brand, causing me to try their liberty ale."
"Pours a real deep brown with a small almond colored head that leaves some decent lacing,the aroma is of deeply roasted malt and a little earthiness.The taste is a variety of different flavors,some roasted malt in the start with a almost caramel sweet middle ending woody and smoky,Real nice body feel one of the best American porters that I have had."
"This is on my list to resample as some friends really enjoy it, but I generally like a more roasted less sweet taste in my porters."
"Blackish-brown in color. Small head after a careful pour. Smell is of roasted malt, coffee and chocolate. Hints of caramel, chocolate and espresso on the palate. Damn smooth and eminently drinkable. One of the best porters out there. Even available here in North Cackalacky..."
"When it poured, it was almost black with a medium dark tan head and some lace. The smell of rosted malts were outstanding. The taste was of a heavy roasted malty taste with just a slight burnt flavor with a slight bitterness. A nice combination of roasted malts and a hint of spice. Pleasant to the palate on the after taste!"
"This is an amazingly good American porter. Many flavors are noted while drinking this. It begins with a creamy toffeeish taste that lets the other flavors be accepted more readily. The next flavor I find is of a roasted/burnt molassess that evens out the creaminess. Fruit and chocolate come through next with some hoppy spicyness following. The finish is a mixture of sugar taste with bitter taste that works very well for this beer. I will definitely need to get more of these and try the rest of Anchor's line of beers."
"Always a pleasure to drink. One of the best tasting beers I've had. Nothing tastes better than a good porter, IMO. Relatively light in body, as is expected. Pours a nice, foamy head with good retention. Chocolate and coffee notes, slightly more bitter than it's English counterparts, but not much. Probably would rate as my second favorite porter, behind only Fuller's. Nice, nice, nice. Anchor is still my favorite U.S. brewer, despite the stiff competition."
"This is a classis American Porter, poured on tap it has a good head that stays and leaves a lace. Appeared to be black. Sweet chocolate aroma. Medium bodied, smooth mouthfeel. Chocolate flavor to start balanced with roasted malt and hops and finish has a hint of bitterness."
"Tasty, well made porter.Poured a deep black with a tan head that receded into just a little bit of lace. The smell was peaty and damp with a lot of robust alcohol flavors. The taste was bitter and dry with just a little unroasted coffee bitterness an molasses. This one seemed to be much heavier on the hops than most porters as there was not as much bready full bodied. Much to my liking. The mothfeel was also very good with minimal carbonation and more tingly bitterness. Good session porter no doubt."
"Good looking porter, dark with a thick creamy head. Aroma is sweet and malty with subtle notes of coffee. Medium bodied and crisp with a slightly dry finish. Flavor is sweet roasted malt all the way. This is one of the better porters I've come across recently. Not as fine as the Fullers but a good choice just the same."
"Originally sampled on 31 August 2003. Appearance: It pours a very dark brown with a tan head. The aroma and flavor are loaded with roasty/coffee-ish tones. It finishes w/ a roasted taste in your mouth is a well done, well balanced brew. I'm glad it's readily available."
"Deep black color, large thick creamy head. Roasted malt aroma. Deep rich roasted malts and flavor. Coffee and chocolate flavor. Slightly sweet. Good hop to malt balance. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is smooth and slightly hoppy. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, with a very slight metallic tinge. Nice tasting porter, smooth and very drinkable."
"This Porter pours a dark black; it gave off a small tan head that left little lace. The aroma is roasted malt with deep dark coffee and a semi hint of caramel. The taste is a dead match for the aroma. It starts with the roasted malts, then more of a coffee flavor and a mild bitterness at the end. A smooth, tasty and very drinkable porter that I will visit again and again."
"The one thing that I would add that is purely my own taste is, I don't find the Anchor Porter as flavorful as the Taddy Porter or even the Sierra Nevada Porter. However, it's a good beer and one that I will have again. It is quite tasty and one I would recommend without hesitation."
"Cheers"
"Dark black in color, with a nice tan frothy head which leaves some lacing as the head diminishes and the beer is consumed. A very thin film of bubbles--remnants of the head--persist through consumption. Aroma is very mild, a hint of ""roasting"" comes out. Wondeful taste, mild but very pleasant. A hint of roasted coffee is present, as well as a bit of a nutty taste. This beer is medium bodied and very smooth in the mouth. A great beer for anytime---doesn't even seem too heavy for a hot summer day. A delicious beer and one of my favorites."
"An exceptional porter and one that is easy to find. Color is deep, dark brown with a light tan head that maintains nicely throughout consumption. Smell is very malty, like chocolate malted milk balls. Taste is chocolately with some nice coffee undertones and there's a barely noticeable tea-like hops flavor (Northern Brewer?) that pokes its head out but doesn't get in the way of all the maltiness. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy for a porter, but very drinkable nonetheless."
"I'll be visiting again soon."
"Average appearance for a porter.Aroma strong of hops,coffee,and alot of chocolate.Color is black with a small tan head.A fair amount of lace is present circling my glass.A very creamy mouthfeel with a strong bitter finish.A touch of crispness is noted on the mouthfeel but nothing spectacular.Very hearty and thick with a full-bodied rich flavor.Very bitter finish that lingers in the after taste.With each sip a ring of lace is left in my glass,and for that I will raise the appearance from 3.0 to 3.5.An overall very good porter.One of the better one's I've had recently.A little less bitterness and a little more carbonation would make it excellent."
"Beer has a nice feel and has high drinkablity. I would have no problem recommending this beer!"
"If giving a beer all 5s was truly possible, this beer has to come the closest. Beautiful to look at, a pleasure to drink. An excellent coffee-chocolate taste, never cloying. Smooth as silk on the tougue and tastebuds. A pleasant aftertaste that definitely have you wanting more. Think I will go get some."
"The body is a clear, exceptionally deep mahogany with ruby highlights. It's foamy tan head holds exceptionally well and leaves some very nice lace throughout the glass. The nose suggests cocoa and dark chocolate. The body is medium/full; and it's quite creamy in the mouth - enhancing its malty flavor and adding greatly to its drinkability! The flavor starts with some dark toffee and fruit, followed by a Cappuchino-like creamy malt as it crosses the palate. Notes of chocolate and black coffee appear in the long lingering finish along with some herbal hop flavor and a mild bitterness. It becomes dryer and roastier as it lags. It has a sweetness to it, but it's not a sweet beer. It's well rounded, and very well balanced. Rich, creamy, and strong; it's one of the best porters brewed in the U.S. and absolutely worth trying."
"Tasty porter. Won't replace my favorite local porter (price & availability) but if I travel I'll look for this one."
"The appearance was a black color with a brown thick head to start that thins out but sticks around to the end. There wasn't much of an aroma but what I could get out of it was a chocolate and raison smell not very strong though. The taste was of roasted malts, chocolate, some coffee and again a little raison. The mouthfeel was a little thick but not cream thickness. Taste was good and went down smooth."
"This is one of the smoothest and easiest drinking Porters around. Pours a deep brown color with a 1/2-inch creamy tan head that fades into a nice lace. Aromas of malt and coffee are detected with a hint of chocolate lingering in the background. Upon the first drink hints of cocoa are noted to be intertwined with the dark roasted malts. This is a great one Porter; I could drink it all night long and never get tired of it."
"I wanted a lot more chocolate and roastiness out of this brew. It seemed to be more of a dark ale than a porter. It was very smooth and full of body. The flavor was pretty good, but it was lacking the robust roasty flavor that a porter should have. It was a good beer to drink with a creamy mouthfeel. Not at all bad, but not what I expected or wanted to get out of this one."
"Pours a nice dark color with tinges of red around the boundaries of the glass. A finely bubbled 1/4 inch head dissipates fairly quickly. Medium mouthfeel with a subtle creaminess. Coffee, roasted malt, a slight hop bitterness. Has a full bodied flavor with a nice lingering bitterness, not overly sweet. Quite an enjoyable porter really, very tasty."
"This is one of my favorites and scores highly becasue of the consistency of the brew over the years, it never disappoints. Visually there is a medium thick head on top of an opaque dark brown to black body that is quite still after the pour. The aroma maintains throughout and is rich and almost coffee like. The mouth has a lot of body, not syrupy, but full. The taste evolves a bit from a still tinge of chocolate bitterness at first but as it warms it becomes sweeter. The best analogy is pehaps a Heath Bar. Only a slight chill is needed for serving, maybe 55/60F. Pils specialists may think it is too rich but it is very high quality to me."
"Texture smooths out and the large portion of this drink is an easy-going, fully flavored ride. While I love bolder and brasher stuff, Anchor Porter just about acheives perfection, and the happiness that ensues when it's flavors flood my mouth and spread my smile out wide confirm that thought."
"Last summer, I brought a friend a 6 pack when I came over. This past weekend, I was at his house to discover it in his spare fridge. Naughty, Naughty! Anyway, cracked one open and enjoyed. The beer was thick and creamy and smelled very good. Strong malt overtones but not without a little hop kick to it. Very drinkable. Above average."
"Drinkability and Comment - A medium dark beer, but well built. Nothing amazing, but nothing to be shy about."
"[ STATS:>> SERVING: 12oz bottle / ABV: 5.6% / PRICE: $1.39 USD ]"
"pours out dark dark brown with a little bit of head. Very malt very malt. The balance is very nice. Maybe on another day I would like this brew more, but today is still today. This is a solid porter for sure. The flavors work together instead of against. Certainly worth a shot. You'll most likely enjoy the brew, maybe even love it."
"A very attractive pour--nearly black with ruby highlights where light is fortunate enough to pass through. Topped off with a really nice tan head--a substantial pockmarked cake of foam that reduces to a clingy lace. Smell is highlighted by sweet, syrupy malts and some alcohol--reminds me of a Scotch ale. Very smooth and nicely malty at the front with some hops bitterness toning that down from the start. Caramely and in a way fruity as it fades out. Hints of roasted flavors as well. A really rich, wonderful mouthfeel. I've not had a lot of interest in porters, but this opens a new door (to my refrigerator)."
"pours out dark brown with ruby hues. tan head; lots of sticky lace left over. aroma of dark fruits, black malts, and molasses with some alcohol notes as well. malt flavors consisting of figs, ripe fruits, molasses, hints of chocolate, and roasted coffee flavors. gentle hop and spice flavors add to the complex and layered profile. extremely smooth and easy drinking. just plain delicious....bordering on decadent! one of the best porters i've ever tasted. this ranks right up there with those awesome baltic porters....and this may be the best american porter hands down. highly recommended and worthy of all praise."
"Judged to be a classic by many, this beer really doesn't do much for me. Between the homebrew twang, the alcohol bite, metallic and fusel alcohol notes, it leaves me with a sick taste in my mouth. It would be exceptionally rare for me to drink more than one of these, as there are much better porters readily available."
"This is a good porter. It is sweet, but is well balanced with some bitterness as to not be overwhelming."
"This may be my favorite porter. I think I might like it a bit more than Fuller's London Porter. The nuttiness comes in as it warms, but I might trade a little of the sweet for a little more nut. I do like the balance, though. A great, yummy, comforting beer."
"This was a very solid porter. Pour was pitch black with a nice head and a ring of tiny bubbles at the bottom of the glass. The aroma was a sweet almost candy like smell sort of like black licorice, with roasted malts. Taste is sweet at first like chocolate, followed by a smokey, earthy flavor. The mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth. This brew was very easy to drink, too bad I only have this one."
"This is a damn delicious porter. It's black, with a good inch of thick tan head. Aromas of dark chocolate, coffee and charcoal were easy to pick up, even in the bar. Mouthfeel is quite slick with little to no carbonation. Flavors of very dark roasted malts, lots of coffee and cocoa powder precede a slightly bitter finish. Very tasty and by far one of the better porters to be had out there."
"The Anchor Porter pours a dark almost see through tint, untill you hold it up to the light. She has hints of deep ruby when held to the light, and the head is light brown hue. With the first whiff of this one, I am getting a major nose of chocolate malty sweetness, enough to make my mouth water. There is also a nice hop aroma that comes through the sweetness to form a really good overall very enjoyable aroma. It is very sweet to the tip of the tongue, as it fist touches. What complements the dark and chocolate roasts is a fruity effervesence that dances along the old taste buds. Very unique and well done. Another master piece by a wonderful brewery, my hat is off to Fritz Maytag. This beer has a nice full body that helps carry all the flavors with each sip, and at the same time delivers a really drinkable porter."
"This is a smooth porter with roasty and carmel tastes dominating, and then a dry bitter coffee finish. I found the mouthfeel to be a little thin, but also slightly creamy at the same time. This is a fairly drinkable porter, not my favorite, but very enjoyable."
"Intense, molasses black, with a fascinating, compact, shape shifting head which leave a distinct depth marker of lace with every sip ringed around the glass. Watch the outside of the glass when finish your sip, see the returning beer trickle back through the tight-knit head. Fruity, then earthy, then bitter and dry, coffee, sweet berry, and a hint of lime."
"After years of enjoying this beer out of the bottle, I recently tried it on tap and was astounded at how good it was. It pours a nice dark brown with just a hint of ruby. It has a good-looking tan head that sticks to to the sides of the glass. The thing that was noticeable about the porter on tap is that the hops really kick things into gear. It has a wonderful creamy mouthfeel and goes down like silk."
"Aftertaste doesn't hang around long, or perhaps because it is such a tight blend of flavors there is nothing distinct to make a lasting impression."
"This beer poured black with a very slight twinkle or dark red when the light is right. A thick tan head that slowly subsided, sat on top. Initial taste revealed a slight bitter taste that road the palette from front to back. As the glass emptied, a slight lacy foam followed the liquid down. While drinking, a hint of liquorish could be smelled along with a hint of dark roasted coffee. The taste slightly lingered leaving behind a dark caramel aftertaste. The body was silky and somewhat smooth. Definitely a good drink that I will buy again."
"Note: As I understand it, this porter is brewed with a Lager Yeast."
"The aftertaste is pungent and persistent, and the body is good for a porter. Good beer."
"F"
"Pours almost black in color with a thin tan colored head that quickly dissipates. Nose is sweet milk chocolate and caramelreminds me a lot of a candy bar. That same sweet chocolate comes through up front in the taste quickly followed by a strong taste of bitter dark coffee. Nice body in the mouth with a bitter finish. A very nice porter."
"Dark, opaque color with a white quickly dissipating head. Light malty aroma. Intense malty, coffee like flavor which are nicely balanced with hops. Aftertaste is decidly malty. Malt flavor is very interesting. Overall very pleasant, well made porter. Good, but not great."
"Awesome drinkability, I could drink these everyday, but the price makes it more of an occasional treat. This beer is definitely one of the benchmarks of the style."
"A must try. Prosit."
"Pours dark brown almost black with a small tan head, fruity chocoloate aromas. Sweet chocolate and burnt coffee flavors, medium body and a nice mild hop bite, but very smooth, a great porter and fairly easy to find."
"Pours dark brown almost black in color with little to no head. The smell isn't much just a little malty. The taste is slighty coffee and a bit earthy? Also, a little more dry than I expected. I was expecting a lot more out of this beer. Don't get me wrong, it is a good beer I just had my hopes up. Still, another solid beer from Anchor."
"Pours a nearly opaque black with a thick, cakelike omnipresent tan head. Very complex aroma with port and brandy-like characteristics, as well as some soft chocolate, vague coffee, vanilla and milky scents. Mild carbonation; slick, creamy mouthfeel. Flavors of raisin, coffee, and dark chocolate, with ripe grape and other sweet dark fruit. Very rich, ideal for sipping on a cold winter's night. A definite winner."
"Pours a black with garnet traces when held up to the light and has a modest tan head. Light aromas of sweet fruit and a hint of chocolate...but it is very faint! The taste reveals a nice blend of hops on the nose and tapers off into a light chocolate and malt. Other than the hops, there is nothing here that really sticks out as it is a rather mild blend, but quite enjoyable. The mouthfeel is that of a medium bodied brew and finishes slighty sticky. Pretty decent brew! Cheers!"
"Black in color with a thin, moderately creamy, dark tan head. On opening the bottle, the first whiff has a rubbing-alcohol like quality to it, odd for such a moderate beer. Alcohol soon fades into the background, and is replaced by a grainy, chocolate-malt scent, with slight coffee notes whichs sweeten into something more toffee-like as the beer warms. In the mouth, this beer has a malty body with subtle notes of fig and a citric acidity from the hops. Dry finish with a very niec burnt grainy aftertaste. Quite a nice porter -- matures well in the glass."
"While this is not a particularly wonderful beer. It isn't undrinkable. However, I feel that there are better porters out there that cost less per 12 oz. bottle."
"Notes: Hands down one of the best porters in the US. I'd even go so far as saying one of the best in the world. This is what a modern day porter should be. If you've yet to try this beer, go buy some now."
"Pours to a deep brown color, with a creamy light brown head that lasts.  With every sip it leaves a nice lace-work down the side of the glass.  It has a wonderful roasted malt aroma, with a bit of burnt coffee.  The flavor is rich, with a strong roasted malt flavor, coffee and chocolate notes.  The mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied, rich, and slightly sweet and bitter in the finish.  Overall, I think this is a wonderful Robust Porter with many complex aromas and flavors."
"This porter has a good, thick mouthfeel with nice toasted malt and carmel notes right up front. Semi-sweet hints of toffee are mixed in their also. Unlike some others, the Anchor porter isn't exceedingly bitter and it has an ultra-smooth finish. It's one of the most drinkable porters I've ever tried. Good stuff."
"As I write this, again I realise I drank it too cold. The flavor really improved as it warmed. A very dark black beer that pours thick with a nice light tan head, but which soon evaporates to almost nothing but a brown ring around the top of the beer in the glass. No lace at all. Intense nose of burnt well-roasted barley malt and caramel in the mouth, with an aftertaste that reminded me so much of a vintage alcohol enriched fruit-Dundee cake. Lovely. Has a really dry finish - akin to many other good Porters I have had. But the roast flavours are still there lingering around for a good while after as though they are waiting for a tip! Drank better as it warmed up - I am always guilty of drinking dark beers straight the fridge (which is strange for me being a Limey), I must refrain from this practise. Don't normally drink Porters, but this is a good one that I really enjoyed."
"This porter poured a deep brown, almost black color. The tan head didn't stick around too long, but some lace resided in the glass. This beer exuded a huge licorice aroma that was, to me, kind of annoying. The coffee and roasted malt flavors were present. The mouthfeel was fairly syrupy, also. Anchor doesn't produce a bad porter here, but I don't think I'll be trying it again any time soon."
"This is a good Porter and is one of the best that you can get readily and at a good price. I like Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter more but not much. Great coffee flavor and dry roasted chocolate bean impression. I will definitely get this again."
"All in all, it is great try one."
"Quite hoppy nose and flavour. Great malt roastiness mid-palate. Slightly sweet but pleasantly bitter. I don't think the malt and hops blended however, will definitely resample, hopefully i enjoy it more next time."
"Deep mahogony brown in color, just as well to say sable.  Beautiful tan cloudtop head that endures, thick sticky lace that coats the glass walls.  Rich aroma of caramel, coffee,  alcohol and a vey slight smokiness.  Strong roasted malts flavors dominated the taste, begins with malt sweetness, toasted malt flavors, finishes with earthy notes and a mild sweetness.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy.  A very substantial porter."
"Virtually opaque, but a tinge of deep garnet around the edges is discernible.  The initially thick, beige head settles into a moderate, but very dense & lace leaving layer.  A combination of sharp, black patent & mellow chocolate malt hits the nose at first.  Light fruitiness, toffee & dark caramelized sugar ensue, & become more pronounced as the beer warms.  Deeply roasted black patent & chocolate malt dominate the flavor at first, but quickly give way to dark crystal malt sweetness & well formulated hop bitterness.  The body is relatively full for a porter and almost rich, while the mouthfeel is dextrinous, but not cloying at all.  Finishes bittersweet due to the combination of roasted grain bitterness & unfermented sugars and dextrins.  Anchor Porter straddles the boundary betweenn a robust porter and stout...  I've forgotten how good this is.  I was lucky to get a well - handled 2 month old six - pack, however.  Anchor does not travel well."
"Had this at a picnic today...22oz. bottle. Nice and dark with a great foamy head! Good body, smooth and light enough to drink on a hot day. Definitely not as heavy as other porters I've had but definitely a good solid coffee taste. Definitely will go back for more."
"Pours a deep dark brown with a nice tan head. Great rich malt flavors I taste, chocolate/toffee/coffee, a sure thing for me when I want a solid porter.  I would recommend this to anybody who likes porters, a staple in my refridgerator."
"A beautiful black colour with a creamy brownish head that laces its way down glass.  Pleasant toffee and light coffee aromas find thier way to your nose.  Very deep and nearly-heavy body ride lazily across the tongue with a faint carbonation.  Very rich and creamy malt flavors taste of toasty, if not burnt, caramels and toffees.  This brew goes down smooth and easy.  Excellent to relax with."
"Good porter.  Pours very dark brown to black color, with a small tan head.  Not much carbonation.  The beer has a distinctly porter malt aroma - roasted barley, chocolate malt, etc.  It's a little sweet, and somewhat complex.  Not as hoppy as I expected.  Very enjoyable."
"This beer poured out a very dark color.  Formed a nice dark tan head with little lace(may have to adjust my frig's temp).  Nice aroma of malt and coffee to it.  The taste of it was quite interesting.  Had not only the elements of coffee to it, but the flavor associated with it, toffee.  It gives it an interesting finish.  Well worth checking out for fans of dark beers."
"This brew is black in color with a rich, creamy head and an aroma of roasted malt and some hops. It offers a mellow  roasted malt flavor with medium body.  Mingled flavors of sweet fruit, caramel, licorice, smoke, and hops."
"Pours black with a nice tan head that stays nicely.  Smell is of roasted malts, coffee, and some chocolate.  Nice coffee and chcocolate flavors are the first to hit the tongue with a nice roasted malt background.  Very creamy and very drinkable.  This is a very good porter, definitely recommended."
"This beer is almost black with a nice dense brown head.  Pretty sweet aroma for a porter.  Seem to get a little acetic smell.  Upon tasting, I find no acetic (vinegar) taste present.  That's a good sign.  I do find some pleasurable tastes.  Sweet chocolate, molasses and hints of bittersweet chocolate and java.  It seems like the sweet notes override the bitter notes in this porter.  Or maybe they just don't blend correctly.  But I've had many a better porter than this.  It is not bad by any means,  but I prefer more hop notes and roasted quality and bitter tones."
"This is a big ol' beer, rich, full and rewarding. Sweet dark malt aroma, pleasing dark tan head. Roasty, smoky flavor with trademark American-stout-style hop oiliness. I got hints of grasses, greens, and herbs. This might sound odd but I thought it excellently complemented the aftertaste of the dark green vegetables I had earlier in the evening - beans & peppers. Would like to try it while nibbling on crisp fresh pea pods. Nourishing and authoritative, with a wonderful burnt finish."
"Notes: Rich yet not overwhelming, a porter to reckon with in drinkability ... it gets very addictive."
"My first Porter and it definitely encouraged me to try more, of course one of my beer philosophies is the blacker the better. The porter's close parentage of the stout shows through in this dark roasty beer with hints of espresso and dark chocolate. Fine beer"
"Head forms deeply, settles at 3/4 of an inch. Dark, dark color, lets dang little light through. Sweet aroma. Dense mouthfeel, very nice milk chocolate/vanilla malt notes. Nothing fleeting, sweet and increasingly roasty malt presence front to back. Hops were very understated to me, just barely present. I have no idea what the Brit's blended Porters tasted like in the 1800s but I do like the taste of the recipes used by the revival American craft brewers like Anchor."
"Dark brown to black with deep-red edges. Slight roasty nose. Bittering hop finish lingers on the back of the tongue. If I were in the mood for a porter I would not spend considerable time looking for this one."
"Classic porter flavors; full, rich body, bittersweet chocolate and coffee. Subtle hop aroma and flavor in the finish. A bit expensive here in NY though."
"An outstanding porter.  Very rich and creamy, with lots of roasted coffee notes."
