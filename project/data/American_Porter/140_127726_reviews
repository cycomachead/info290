"Hour later and my mouth is still dry. This mouth feel is AWFUL."
"Very dry mouth feel, decent but nothing nothing to write home about"
""
""
""
"This started so nicely, but the oxidation kinda ruins it.  It's still drinkable, but just not enjoyable.  I feel sorry for the people that bought this getting their first Bells and finding this instead."
"Overall: this is an awesome beer. Wish I had more."

"Short Review.  This was good, it was just a nice and smooth malty beer with some nice toasted malts and nutty flavors.  I liked it, I wish i would have been able to have review a bottle when they released, I hope it comes out again."
""
"I Pop!ped the cap and began a very gentle pour as it was possible that there may be lees in the bottle's punt. As I poured, I could see a tiny amount and although it probably would not have mattered, I left it there for a final pour. The bartender's trick raised a finger of deep-tan head that fell back down, leaving noce lacing in its wake. Nose held a melange of odors - "" toffee, caramel, chocolate, coffee, and dark fruit"" and who would I be to disagree?  Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Mouthfeel was dense, creamy, like a dollop rather than a draught. Man, this was one intense festival of flavors. Caramel, chocolate and coffee were immediate on the tongue, followed by toffee and dark fruit. It was difficult to parse all of them, but they were there at one point or another. Finish was semi-sweet, thanks especially to the coffee and dark chocolate flavors. The all-important last pour was like dark chocolate and a tinge of mint, as though the hops had been hiding out all this time. Good stuff!"
""
"This is pretty nice.  I was surprised that it was a touch thin, but it's a nice balance of flavors.  Nothing mind-blowing, but very solid."
""
""
"This looks amazing. It pours an incredible dark brown, like a thick cola, with a great creamy coca colored topping. Smells fantastic out of the bottle, with a distinct roasty note, followed by some caramel, toffee and coffee. Yums  all around. The flavor was equally delicious, with more of the roasty goodness rounding it out. Enjoyed this tremendously."

"Sierra Nevada tap takeover at City Taphouse in Philly."
"This is a nice surprise. I accidentally aged this (like most of the Beer Camp beers, sorry), but I think this may have actually been an ideal mistake. The burnt and roasty flavors really meld with the caramelized sweetness. This is a solid sipper, and very good overall."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall WELL WORTH the $3.50 I paid for this beer. I will try not to hold said price against the others but this one is worth picking up!"
"The mouthfeel is smooth with a light and almost watery body that leaves a semi-dry ashy coating across the tongue, followed by a slight bitterness and rich coffee and cocoa flavors. Some of the earthy notes resemble peat moss, and I wish there were hop presence, but this was a really good beer that went down very easy and hid the ABV perfectly. A real solid porter and another great collaboration, I recommend trying this if you can still find it."
""
""
"O - An excellent strong dark ale.  Probably more an imperial porter than anything else.  Well done!"
""
"Deep, dark brown, opaque body with a quarter inch of beige head. Aromas of dark chocolate, espresso, roast, char. Big time chocolate character with a smoky finish. Definitely reminiscent of a Bell's Expedition. Some dark fruit character emerges as the beer is allowed to warm.  For sure one of the best Beer Camp beers in the series."

"Big creamy roasted delicious beer that's like an imperial milk porter."

"D: overally, a good drinking malty, sweet ale. I am glad I hung onto this bottle for so long as this is the sipper for the colder months of right now versus the warm summer months when this variety pack came out."

"10/27...BCAA 1/12...pours complete blackness, like paint with a light tan lid. Rich roasted coffee nose. Some sweetness. Hearty creamy rich chewy chocolate bar taste. Like a milk shake. Boozy. Supremely roasted."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall mixed, it has it good points, but again it's an American black ale so just doesn't blend well."
""
""
"A thin densely packed dark khaki colored froth...  Solid retention...  The color is a slightly dull inky black that lets a slight bit of light leak in around the edges...  A light bit of slightly sluggish carbonation can be seen when investigated up close...   A good bit of lacing clings to the glass...  The nose is dominated by sinfully sweet milk chocolate...  Marshmallow...  Sweet cream...  Light gooey caramel notes...  Very appealing...  The roasted malt is dialed up on the palate...  There is also the introduction of some faint coffee notes to compliment the sweetness alluded to by the aroma...  On the fuller side of medium bodied...  Thick and rich...  Slightly chewy...  Decadent...  Light carbonation...  Overall this is a very nice American Porter...  Just shy of world class, but without doubt on the the Beer Camp Across America offerings..."

"Brown sugar and molasses on the nose. Sweet, tangy and bitter. Doesn't rest on the tongue very long but a very decent beer."
""
""
"O: Excellent robust porter, full flavored and bodied."
""
""
"The first one that had some decant full body, stood out from the rest in that it had some 'beef' to it. Overall the taste was good but nothing mind blowing. Was satisfying and had a rich robots flavor. Still nothing that I will stick out years or even months down the road~"

"Very dark brown, almost black, no light shining through at all. Nice three fingers of fluffy light brown head, good retention and lacing. Aroma was lots of chocolate, coffee and roasty malt. I swear I smelled Cocoa Puffs! The taste was really nice with the roasty malt up front with coffee and slight chocolate notes on the back end. The mouthfeel was typically medium to thin like a porter, with little to no carbonation bite. Overall, this was quite a tasty beer, nice collab between Sierra Nevada and Bell's, just what you would expect from two outstanding breweries with great craft tradition.  I really liked this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Outstanding."
""
""
"Overall:  This beer smelled off nice, but the ashy bitterness was a bit much.  Still a very solid beer though.  This beer definitely got better as it warmed up.   Still a bit smoky though."

"Bottled on date is 05/21/14 so it is about 5 months old. Still excellent!"
""
""
"O- Very nice. Imperial Dark Ale was a bit confusing, because I thought this one might be a Black IPA. Anyway, a nice semisweet porter, nearing the stout category, was just fine for me. Definitely one of the top beers in this pack."

""
""
"Dark sugars dominate the nose seasoned with light coffee, roast and chocolate. A deep brown column of beer supports a 1” moussey tan foam cap that marks each sip with a thick line of lace. The beer’s palate impresses with the range of Maillard reaction flavors – kettle carmelization flavors from boiling the wort vigorously for a long time mingle with a variety of roast malt flavors with some yeast driven dark dried fruit in the middle with bitter hop and roast flavors rising in the finish. A light caramel undertone and the interaction between the two types of Maillard reactions provide an interesting reaction and rounds off any harsh or rough notes. The rich creamy texture and chewy body elevate the beer."
"Pours viscous black with a small brown head. Dark malt, caramel, notes of espresso and cacao fill the nose, sweet maple with some mild dark dried fruit are present as well. Taste same as aroma with mild bitterness and mild roasted notes. A full bodied creamy and smooth mouth feel. Finish is sweet dark caramel malt, taste of maple, a bit of dark fruit in there, ending has some sweet alcohol notes. Has a good dark malt character with mild bitterness, alcohol is well behaved on the palate. Overall a rich full flavored very tasty and enjoyable brew."
""
""
"Dark, malty with notes of cocoa, chocolate, brown sugar, light toast, and dark fruit. A well executed malt forward beer. Appears black with brown highlights around the edges. Goes great with grilled meat or maybe some sort of chocolate dessert."
""
""
"Overall: Very good beer overall. This is one of the best beers from the Beer Camp box. If you get a chance, give this one a try."

"Pours dark brown with a nice finger think head. Smells like sweet coffee and dark chocolate with a slight sour note. Tastes of malts, espresso, and hints of cocoa. As I sip I get toasty notes as well, like burned malt but in a good way. Mouthfeel is rich and smooth. Great long finish."

"O: approaches 4."

"O) This was the last bottle I had from this year's camp. Seemed rather fitting, as it was an enjoyable brew on cool summer evening as we transition to Autumn. I'll also just say, I hope SN takes this collaborative approach with next year's camp as well."
"o; An interesting and flavorful Imperial Porter-like ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this Porter delivers almost as much roast flavors as many stouts, certainly more than some. The upfront bitter cocoa is probably the emphasis of the beer but brown and blackened grain flavors cascade beyond that with a bit of yeast influence."

"Bottle from the mix pack bought at Tipples. Pours deep dark brown with a one finger khaki to mocha brown head. Aroma of bitter chocolate, dark fruits, some roast, raisins, even some coffee. Very porter like on the nose. Flavor is rich chocolate sauce, bitter roast, some dark fruit. But very chocolate forward. Rich, stout like mouthfeel, plus carbonation, lingering roast bitter finish. Wow. This was really nice. I did not realize it was a porter until smelling it. Maybe the best in this box."
""
"Black pour with a brown one-finger head. Nice roasted coffee aroma. Taste has a strong chocolate presence upfront backed by light roasted coffee. Only a slight bitterness. Medium body also has some nice roasted grain flavors, as well as a very faint caramel/toffee flavor. Finishes with a mild sweet flavor of semi-sweet chocolate."
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown in color, thick tan head, good lacing.very nice aroma of molasses and raisin. Dark complex malt flavors in the taste as well, but not too sweet. Well  balanced. Thicker body, smooth mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
"This odyssey is a dark adventure into a thick & creamy ale. The ale is a semi-opaque dark brown w/ a thin, tan head. Smells of caramel & chocolate malt. The malt continues into the initial flavor as a fierce roastiness. Also very rich & similar to toffee. Despite its almost double digit ABV, the ale is very smooth. This odyssey is well worth the trip!"
"O: this is a lot of beer; such good flavor;"
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Quite a surprise, given the toned down character of the other beers in the box"
""
""
""
"The label describes this beer as an ""imperial dark ale"". I'd say that it is a solid coffee forward American porter."
""
"O-So far the best beer of the mix pack, still have more to get through but this is the best."
""
"A terrific  dark ale. Would have loved a sixer of this."
""
""
""

"Overall (4.25): Mmm, American Porter? I don’t know about that, but I can appreciate that this “Imperial Dark Ale” doesn’t really have a good corollary in the list of beer styles. That said, in terms of aroma, flavor, and feel, “Imperial Dark Ale” definitely encapsulates what this beer is. It doesn’t have the roast of a porter or stout, the chewy fullness of a barleywine or Strong Ale, or the hoppy dynamic of an American Black Ale. It’s just big, dark (but not particularly roasty), smooth, complex, and delicious."

"Never had a dark beer from Bell's but this was a great porter with really smooth smoky flavors and a nice roasted smell."
"D:  This is one helluva Porter.  Maillards Odyssey is a real sleeper amongst all the camp beers.  A definite dark horse if you will.  Incredible how they were able to coax such great depth in character out of this one and keep it all in good balance.  Would love to pick this one up again.  Ranks in the Top 3 of the camp for me."

"Easily the best so far, being the 9th of the 12.   A great example of a porter  - perfect for a slightly cool and rainy late summer's evening."

"Overall: A pretty good dark brew. Has the full bodied richness of an imperial stout with some good roasty chocolate and coffee flavors."

"Lightly crisp to start, smoother and a bit dry at the finish. Slow sipping beer that is full flavored and very enjoyable."
"This is by far one of the best beer camps out there."
""
"Bottle: Poured a clear dark color ale with a medium size off-white foamy head with good retention with minimal lacing. Aroma of dark roasted coffee is very dry with some chocolates notes and light caramel malt notes as well. Taste is a powerful assault of roasted malt and dark coffee which is quite dry but also avoids being astringent which is great. Some cacao notes and light caramel notes can also be detected. Body is lighter than expected with medium carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Hard to pinpoint to an exact style but very nice beer with good amount of complexity while retaining good drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Medium+ body, medium dry and lasting roast finish. Velvety.  I'll buck the trend and say it's a bit too large body and velvety to be a traditional porter.  Maybe one of those American porters that blurs the lines.  Imperial Dark Ale is a great descriptor. (4.25)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
" There is lots of roasted malt and caramel in the taste with a light cocoa flavor and slight dark fruit taste with subtle yeast element which adds a slight spice and bready flavor with a subtle toffee quality from the layers of malt without going to sweet. The flavor of raisin is mild in the finish. Overall this is a very tasty dark ale w/ lots of chocolate flavors but not overly roasted -just excellent!"
""
""
"This and the Double Latte are easily the best of 2014 beer camp."

"At only 40 IBUs I was waiting for a toasty malty lip smacking goodness and I wasn't disappointed.  drank it straight out of the bottle so I can't give any of the typical feed back other than taste and that's what this beer is all about.  And as advertised dark flavors abound toffee, caramel, chocolate - didn't p/u on the coffee but certainly the dark fruit - maybe cherry."
""
""
""
"Tastes like the aforementioned sweets only with a very nice finish of bittersour barley.  A nice mocha beginning moves into a middle of coffee and charred barley, ending on a finish of fruity hops and porter-like barley.  Basically if you combine a medium strength American brown with a baltic porter and somehow they blend together almost perfectly, this is the beer you end up with."
""
""
""
"Gorgeous dark color, nice creamy head. Flavors of roasted caramel and coffee with a balanced bitterness. Make more!"
""
"Taste shows off the nose while inviting in some light dark fruit notes. The nuttiness and dark fruit are reminiscent of a strong ale, but DAT ROAST!  Big bold and unapologetic.  Nice chocolate and coffee notes...damn fine porter. Medium to full bodied and a touch chewy.  This was a nice one from the set, very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Creamy and smooth, full bodied. Roasty with a slight lingering bitterness. Slight ash and char, but mellowed. Overall pretty nice, one of my favorites of the 12, and one of the more distinctive. 4/4.25/4"

""

"my last from beer camp, been saving awhile now. dark and dreamy this one, invitingly dark brown and delicate looking. the head is furiously big, light tan in color but some two inches high in my globe. nose of coffee and toffee, a very english introduction, but with some more bitter darker coffee roast too, just in lesser proportion and later on in the experience. the flavor is kind of odd, creamy like cappuccino fluff in the mouth, but not having a ton of flavor until the finish, weird in a beer style where its usually malt all the way through. the same things i smell up front i taste way late, caramel and nice hand pulled coffee. great full body and the alcohol is invisible. a beautiful winter beer, one they should definitely make again and package. bells can do no wrong for me, and this is as rich and interesting as their cream stout. one of the better beers in the beer camp box, and a great way to close it out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is hands down the best beer in the otherwise dissappointing Beer Camp 12 pack."
""
"Overall, it has such an incredible cream, chocolate, and coffee flavor that it's shocking that it has none of those ingredients!  I really hope they bring this out again sometime, as it's really just wonderful!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. A pretty nice offering that I enjoyed despite not having a clue what style of beer it was suppose to be."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This really drinks like a lighter but full-flavored porter or brown ale.  Hard to believe it is 8.5% but a really good beer to end the Beer Camp Across America pack with."

"Pours gorgeous, easily achieving three fingers of fluffy head.  The rocky nougat brown head has nice retention sticking around for 5 minutes with no problem.  Leaves thick waves of lace as it fades.  Nose is fizzy and loaded with tons of dark roasted malts.  There is a bit of alcohol twinge there as well.  Taste is an instant unique mix of dry bitter malts and dark fruits.  Really creamy combination that comes together on the back end of the palate.  Strongly reminds me of a very good high cacao content dark chocolate.  This is a exceptionally drinkable brew and easily the best beer I have had in the Beer Camp mix so far."
""
""
""
""
""
"Full bodied, well carbonated, yet still smooth and creamy.  Overall, this is a pretty solid dark ale kind of blends the line between Stout, Barleywine and Old Ale, and closest to the third style mentioned."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a gorgeous dark, almost black, brown body with reddish highlights around the edges and two fingers of thick tan head. Quite good looking. Scents of rich toffee, sweet caramel, black coffee and luscious chocolate balanced together with hints of alcohol and undertones of dark fruit, especially raisin, with slight cinnamon-like spiciness discernible. An excellent, malt, rich and complex aroma that is remarkable in its balance. Very nice. Flavor begins sweet with toffee, caramel, dark fruit, especially raisin, milk chocolate and coffee flavors mingling with faint notes of alcohol. The middle changes tone slightly with rich milk chocolate becoming the most prominent flavor, alongside hints of coffee and a more pronounced alcohol flavor. The finish is slightly drier with notes of black coffee, semi-sweet chocolate, heavy amounts of dark fruit and a pronounced, though not overwhelming, alcohol warmth. Aftertaste is semi-dry with notes of roast malt, strong black coffee and hints of cocoa powder. A wonderfully rich, complex and malty flavor profile that is warming and pleasant. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with light carbonation and a smooth, slick feel with a touch of alcohol burn. Very nice and drinkable, quite pleasant. Overall this is a fantastic dark ale. It is complex and rich in aroma and flavor and with a wonderfully pleasant mouthfeel. It seems like the perfect Winter beer and is simply wonderful to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'd like less carbonation as it make the ale fluffy and not smooth enough.  There is a little extra in this ale with the chocolate noticable and the coffee less so.  Rich and full.  Enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Jet black in appearance, the head was light and fizzy. Dry chocolate and Graham cracker nose I do catch some char, coffee and lactose. The flavor is big and bold and dry. Chocolate malt, light toffee, dry malt, coffee roast, char and caramel are front and center. The biggest drawback is I find it thin and watery. All in all this is amongst the best in the 12 pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes like a mini version of Expedition. (In a good way) Tons of chocolate, coffee, caramel, molasses, and burnt wood. some leather & coconut flavors are also present."

"Deep rich and very good."

""
""

"O: A very nice, complex dark ale (porter) with a few layers. It makes for a nice sipper as it warms up and goes through stages. One of the top 3 in the mixed 12-pack"
""
"O - This was very nice. Reminded me more of a stout than a brown ale. One of my favorites from the Beer Camp series."
""
""
""

"Overall - Very tasty. The most flavorful of the series so far."
""
""
"We'll done. Comes off as a stout with strong brown ale influence."
""
""
""
"Overall: truly a blend of the dark styles. Fairly middle of the road alcohol wise. Creamy oatmeal like feel and hints in the taste. Rich and roasty notes like an imperial stout. Overall i would say it's a little too bitter for me but still quite good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"They call this a strong dark ale, why not a stout? Another worthy inclusion in the Beer Camp Across America pack."
"o: New beer camp favorite, wish I could buy a case."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I would rank this as 3 or 4 in the box. The two cans were the standouts."
""
""
""
"Served in a Pint glass"
"Overall: Straight 4's up to this point. On it's own, this beer is well worth seeking out. It reminds me of a smaller version of Bell's Expedition, or a stronger version of Founder's Porter. Of course, you can't find it on it's own, which is a bit of a detractor for this fine beer. Is it worth $2 a bottle? You bet. Is it worth the $22 you have to pay for the Beer Camp 12-pack? Maybe. Money aside, this is an outstanding beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Definitely a black IPA but thankfully, not over-the-top on the bitterness quotient. I'm glad it leans more to the Imperial Stout side than the Imperial IPA side."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - great beer, wish they brewed more of this. Pretty close to being a stout but not quite, somewhere between a porter and a stout. The smell has one aroma where the taste has a pretty different. Alcohol is hidden well. Well balanced beer with lots of flavors and scents!"

"A fantastic ale from Beer Camp. Pours a thick opaque black with nice dark tan foam layer that dies down to outer glass lacing. Thick and rich, this offering has the aromas of dark bittersweet chocolate, caramel malts, toffee, a hint of coffee, and a touch of sour cherries. Taste is up front splendid chocolate explosion with a touch of coffee, caramel malts to the back, toffee and cherry like flavors on the aftertaste with a very light bittering hop. Fantastic mouthfeel, chewy and lightly carbonated. Stout lovers, listen up, GET IT WHILE YOU CAN. This is one to contact them on for a continual brewing. An A plus in my book."

"O-Overall a great beer will have again."
" Overall – An alight imperial stout/porter, but after the look and the nose, the taste and feel were a bit of a disappointment. An alright imperial, but just on I would have once; likely not going back to again and again."

"Part of the Beer Camp compilation. Collaboration between Sierra Nevada and Bells. This guy pours blacker than black with a little bit of tan head. Nose is dark malts, coffee, dark caramelized sugars. Coats the palate, big mouth-feel, big flavor. The dark coffee flavor pushes through, some dark fruits, and finishes very chocolatey. Really like the bitter hop/chocolate finish. Alcohol is hidden very well. Not the biggest fan of darker beers but this guy is tasty, not too heavy but still well crafted. Kudos to one of the better beers in the Beer Camp."

"drinkable though, would be nice to have again if it they remade it. best 1 I had so far. but its not perfect."

"Overall, it's pretty clear to me that this is the best beer of the entire pack, and honestly, could be hang with some of Bell's best non-BA porter/stout offerings. Also, now that I've trekked through all 12 beers, I should say that a good 1/3 to 1/2 of the box were beers well above average in their individual styles, and only a couple that really fell short for me. I can only imagine that the undertaking of collaborating with twelve different breweries is hard enough in and of itself, let alone to do it and put out nothing but solid beers. I sincerely hope that Sierra Nevada continues with this format for next year's Beer Camp, as it really makes the process of trying the beers a lot of fun. I'd gladly pay $25 for 12 beers of this quality, some from breweries that wouldn't ordinarily come to my neck of the woods."
""
""
""
""
"O-Interesting flavors here. A unique taste for sure. I was expecting another well made, albeit rehashed Imperial Stout/Porter. This is different in both feel and flavor."
""
""
"O- I guess this was meant to be a black IPA, and it accomplishes that in spades. I don't generally like the style, but this is one of the better ones I've had in the style. Nicely done, one of the better beers in the pack."

"This is a light stout really. Its a good beer if you are into this style, it may even be a great beer but I am not a fan. I don't know what they wanted this beer to be, but it was not a true imperial stout, nor was it a standard stout. You get the flavors they describe on the bottle, chocolates, coffee, and some sweetness, I have said over and over Bell's makes great beer, overall this was better than most but not my favorite of the bunch."

"o: wow wasn't expecting to like it as much as i do. its got a great balance of dark flavors, sweetness, and roast to bring harmony to your mouth. the mouthfeel is excellent as well. classified as a brown ale…but its the same kind of brown ale as Palo Santo Marron. i'm not finished with the camp yet, but this is my favorite so far"
""
""
""
"O: Good but unremarkable."
"This beer is very rich! I love it's chocolate and coffee aromas and how smooth and creamy the taste is. It isn't too heavy and has that wonderful feel of toasted malt, toffee and dark fruit to top it off. Its a dessert in a glass! A perfect way to top off a dinner or just to have at the end of that long day!"

"12oz bottle. Pours a pitch black color with an inch of frothy khaki head. Some lacing. Aromas of toffee, coffee and chocolate. Nutty with some earthy notes. The taste is a nutty and earthy mix of coffee, caramel, and toffee. Some chocolate and roasted malt notes as well. Finishes with more caramel and nuts. A hint of charcoal. Heavy, creamy mouthfeel. Fair amount of alcohol warmth. Overall, decent beer."
""
"Bottle. Aroma is coffee, chocolate, roasted barley and brown sugar. Appearance is very dark brown with a big, dense tan head. Taste is toffee up front, chocolate, roasted barley, and coffee. Full body and decent carbonation for the style. Overall a very enjoyable beer with a lot of subtle flavors. Perhaps my favorite Beer Camp."
"Appearance is dark black with a coffee colored head. The smell was very roasty and I got a lot of black coffee in it. The taste had a lot of great roasted malt flavor which gave a tasty feel to the beginning and almost a semi sweet finish. The mouthfeel was also nice, having just enough carbonation to complement the style. Really enjoyed this one, even though it was the last of the Beer Camp for me."
"The body is smooth and even, with a semi-dry finish. Drinkability is very good, I'd buy a sixer of this stuff. Overall, a pretty good brew, certainly worth your time."

"A damn fine beer indeed!"

"O: A lot of great brown malt flavors with hints of roast for good measure. Rich and elegant body. Drinks like a beer half its abv. The sweetness begins to weigh on the palate towards the end of the session, but it was still a pleasant enough drink."
""
"O: a good porter, but nothing that's making me wish it were around all year, but easily a mellow and smooth enough beer to turn someone onto the style."

"T: Deep roast counterbalanced by a moderate hop bitterness. Great toasty taste without being burnt. Notes of dark cherry. Pleasant lingering bitterness well after the finish."

"This is a really tasty dark and strong brew. I don't know what to call it, but it's like another breed of Black IPA with a maltier base. From the 12 oz bottle as part of the 2014 Beer Camp box, purchased at Liticker's Liquor in Ocean Beach."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 5/21/2014. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 2 finger dense and rocky tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, caramel, toffee, raisin, light char, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, fruitiness, and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, brown bread, light char, light nuttiness, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, brown bread, light char, light nuttiness, herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, fruitiness, and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly creamy, and lightly chalky/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial porter style. All around great complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, fruitiness, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Good beer. Rich and complex stout flavor, I wouldn’t mind making this a regular. One of the better Camp offerings."
"O: A good beer overall, and probably the best of the Beer Camp pack. Lots of nice roasted malt and hop characters throughout."
""
""
""

"Overall, this may be my favorite Beer Camp thus far. Still have 6 to go, though."

"Overall a real fun porter. Interesting to see that the roasty beers in the series have turned out to be my favorites."
""
""

"Overall a decent well crafted beer but the roastiness is too acrid, aging may help with this, but it left me disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a solid dark ale. Not sure on the style of this one, but I like it. Reminds me of a porter more than a stout. Very solid offering."
""
""
""
"O) Probably the best beer in the pack. Good example of the style."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Nicely done. Smooth, yet bold and plenty of flavor. This has a nice mix that isn't just a porter with hops, or a ipa with some coffee and dark malts. This is worth a 6'er release. Good beer."
""
""
"Overall: Very nice beer. Similar flavor profile to the Double Latte in the Beer Camp variety pack."

"I have finally come to the end of the 2014 Beer Camp set and this was the one I saved for last. It appears I saved the best one for last. It would be nice to get my hands on this one a few more times."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Well done creamy porter. Bell's porter is world class and I wouldn't expect anything less. The roast is just a tad too much and detracts a bit from the drinkability. Paired exceptionally well with good milk chocolate."
""
""
""
""
""

"While alcohol warmth and spice builds, a rummy tone takes hold, retaining glimpses of coffee and bittersweet chocolate. But as those roasted balances fade away, its sweeter middle is left naked, to fend for itself."
"Poured on-tap at a Beer Camp tap takeover, the beer was served in a shaker pint. The beer is a dark brown-to-black coloring, with a light tan head. Nose of molasses, roasted notes, date, fig, and subtle booze. Very layered. Flavors are heavily roasted forward, with old world fruit dominating. Date, fig, and raisin are supported by a darkly bitter, roasted coffee backbone. Richly sweet molasses character highlights throughout, as well. Smooth, velvety body, with a dark roasted, sweet aftertaste. Slick, smooth, lingering finish. This one felt big."

"O: A very good hoppy porter with rich flavors and a good chew to it. The first of the beer camp pack I really enjoyed."
""
"12 ounce bottle, part of the Beer Camp Across America 12-pack. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with a couple inch frothy tan head that stayed around a while. There's also a lot of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and some dark fruit. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some burnt/charred malt and molasses. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and smooth with a good amount of carbonation. I liked this brew a lot, it's easily my favorite of the Beer Camp brews I've had so far (this one is #11). I'd like to see this one made again in the future."
"Aroma is roasted malts, coffee, mild fruit and toffee. The flavor is dark/roasted malts, caramel/toffee, fruit/berries, mild sweetness, slick texture and an acidic/mildly alcoholic finish. Out of all 12 in the Beer Camp pack, this is one that is good enough to be a permanent offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Best of the pack IMO (by a hair), also the highest ABV, and the most complex. This would be fantastic BA. Beautiful Mahogany color with a thick mocha head, the aroma was a combination of a Imperial stout & Old Ale, both aroma & flavor of sweet toffee, chocolate, vanilla, & caramel, but it wasn't all sweet, it had a balanced hop presence in the finish to keep it honest. I would call this an Imperial Brown, Well Done"

"Pours very dark with a very tan head. Great malty nose. Flavor profile is smokin'! Crazy smooth with thick and thorough malt characteristics. Hints of chocolate, very mild roasted malts. So damn smooth. I have neglected writing anything about this one and have just been sipping and enjoying. This is everything a porter should be. Really excellent."
"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, showing light only at the edges in the glass with a nice medium brown head with good retention and lacing. Nice aroma of sweet toasted malt, chocolate, dark dried fruit, slight lactose. Flavor follows, starting with toasted malt, milk chocolate, dried dark fruit and a hint of coffee with lighter fruit flavors, caramel developing as the chocolaty malt seems to grow a bit more intense. Finishes with a very great light fruit and chocolate malt combination that lingers pleasantly after the taste. Medium bodied with light creaminess. One of the rare beers that starts nicely and just gets better as one savors it, and finishes with super lingering flavors. I really liked this. I've been extremely happy with four I've tried from this pack, but this is probably my favorite so far. Without being strongly flavored, has a consistently nice taste throughout."
""
""
"The beer pours a slightly tan head that dissipates a bit quickly. The beer itself is an opaque brown that is slightly darkish brown but close enough to brown to make it hard to distinguish between. The beer smell consists of strong coffee and vanilla smell. The beer has other lighter notes such as a burnt sugar smell as well as a light and barely noticeable chocolate/toffee notes with no noticeable hop notes. The taste is a bit different than the smell. The taste is certainly more bitter with a slightly noticeable bitter hop note underneath all of the roasted malts. The taste has a stronger chocolate note than smell but the vanilla notes stays the same even though the coffee note has diminished a little bit. The mouthfeel is a bit heavy with biting carbonation. The feeling is a bit thick but still somewhat smooth. Overall, a fantastic brown ale and exactly what I expected from the collaboration of two very good breweries. My only complaint is that this won't be available after the Beer Camp run."
""
""
"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Pours one shade shy of black with a loose, quarter inch, khaki-colored head. Nose expresses roast and a hint of lactose and artificial sweetener. Taste consistent with nose; however, the roast is nicely prominent as well as chocolate malt. There's also a trace of dark fruit and coffee grounds towards the back. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to medium) with a slightly prickly carbonation that leaves a residual tingle at the finish. Overall, a pretty decent porter with a well-hidden abv; however, there are better ones out there."
""
"Overall really a special beer, not sure I would call it a brown ale, more of a stout in my opinion, truly amazing beer."
"Overall: I like this beer quite a lot. It gets to be a little acidic after about half a glass, but it's still quite good indeed."
""
""
""
""
"It's a great beer. Possibly the best in the pack. But let's give Double Latte a run. 4.25"

"Pours a very dark shade of brown, with thick dense light brown colored head. A few rings of lace left down the glass. Smell: heavy on the roasted grain, a little char; caramel, notes of pine and dark roast coffee. Taste: big on the roast and caramel; beneath that juicy black plum, milk chocolate note, and buttered toasted brown bread make a welcome appearance. Mild earth and pine come through towards the finish. Nice porter, one of the better beers in the pack."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is not what I expected barred on the label, but it certainly is a decent be."
"Pours black with finger width foamy head. There is mild head retention and mild lacing on the side of the glass. Dark malty aroma with hints of roasted coffee. Upon tasting, there is a roasted coffee taste, followed by a nice hoppy bitterness, which ends in a smooth milk chocolate aftertaste. There is excellent transition in the flavors of this beer. Aroma could be a little more complex, but the taste is excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I am not sure what Imperial Dark Ale means, but I am not sure what this is either. Imperial Porter? American Stout? Export Stout? Oatmeal Stout? It seems to be some combination of all of those. What it is is delicious."
""
""
""
""
"Velvety smooth and chocolatey. Goes down incredibly easy for the 8.5% abv."
""
""
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, roasted nut, cocoa, and caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with dark roasted malt, nut, and burnt cocoa flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with really nice roast and toast characteristics all around."
""
""
""
""
"A tasty, well done porter. A bit heavy on the caramel, toffee aspect for my taste, but still quite enjoyable."
""
""
"O- Certainly one of the standouts of the pack. Would definitely buy it again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a handsome brew and damn do I wish they both put this in their year-round lineup, or at least seasonal ;)"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied mildly carbonated and very nicely balanced. Some bitterness and alcohol in the finish leave it slightly sharp but nothing off putting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Opaque rich brown pour with a creamy mocha head. Smells richly of toffee, chocolate, malt, vanilla and coffee. Taste is lightly sweet with chocolates, malt, toffee. Bitterness arrives from hops and an aromatic roast coffee. Very nice balance and interplay of flavors. Medium body is creamy with moderate carbonation. Mild coffee and chocolate finish is dryish. Excellent imperial dark ale in its own right, and the best of the 2014 beer camp 12 pack so far by a long shot."
"Overall- Good to really good beer. Spot on representation of the style with no frills or surprises. Definitely worth a try."

"As others have pointed out,after drinking this I believe this to be a porter not an American Black Ale.Pours a deep chocolate color with a creamy half finger deep beige head that settles very slowly leaving almost two full rings of lace as it does.Molasses,char,coffee,and some burnt notes in the nose,mild earthy hops round it out.Some chocolate hits upfront on the palate then some molasses and burnt sugar,the roast and drying earthiness is big in the finish.This is a damn fine PORTER and a big one at that,a great complex beer."

""

""
""
""
""
"Overall - Grossly miscategorized here as an American Black Ale (aka Black IPA or Cascadian Dark Ale), and the 40 IBU's prominently displayed on the front of the label is a testament to that. Drinks much closer to an Imperial Porter than anything. In any event it's pretty darn delicious, but it's no Steelhead Scotch Porter."
""
"Overall 4.0: Excellent brew. Big (8.5%) with no hint of alcohol, this baby will get your attention. Slightly sweet, pleasantly smoky, mildly hoppy and so well-balanced and satisfying. Smooth, silky and fantastic, this is the crown achievement of the Beer Camp...so far."
"Pours out a deep murky brown with a frothed mocha head. Big nose of roasty malts. Heavy on nuttiness: lots of roasted almonds, hazelnuts, Frangelico. I pick up some cinnamon as well. Flavor is kind of a let down after the amazing smells I just experienced. Tastes of roasted malts with some ashy burn. Tastes like a sweet robust porter. Mouthfeel is full with a moderate carbonation. Solid beer, but I was expecting greatness from the nose."

"This is one of the best beers from the Beer Camp Across America pack. It's a very tasty beer if you're looking for something dark and malty. It's a cross between a stout and a Belgian dark ale, to me, and it comes across quite nicely."

"Pours a dark dirty motor oil brown capped by a one and half finger beige head. Above average retention, splotchy lacing randomly distributed on the inside of the glass. Roasted chocolate malt and brown sugar on the nose. Opens with brown sugar, dark chocolate and big roasted notes. Burnt caramel and toffee blend with espresso notes, more charred chocolate malt, and some discernible bittering hops on the finish. Heavier side of medium bodied, smooth, and silky. Moderately carbonated. This is a really unique enjoyable brew that combines characteristics of an imperial stout, porter, and brown ale. One of the best brews I've enjoyed so far that is part of the 2014 Summer Camp pack."

"Maillard’s Odyssey is a dark ale layered with complex malt flavors of toffee, caramel, chocolate, coffee. With some hops coming though, giving a fruit aspect in the taste. This is by far my favorite in this pack. I truly mean it this time. It's one of my favorite ""Dark Ale's"" which is code for stout."
