The caramel has nowhere to hide, I might have confused myself with procuring candy for Halloween not porter as a mix sixer for New Year's. Complements the malt but risks overwhelming it too. Not really in disagreement with my palate but not likely a repeat purchase. Will be interesting to compare to another in the mix-six I selected purely by accident, Shiner's ""Birthday Beer"" a chocolate stout. Luckily accident though since I'll be spending 12/31/14 at a party hosted by a New Year's baby, hope his sweet tooth is in gear for that as mine was for the Saranac.","A_Frayed_Knot","Dec 30, 2014"

Thus far, I find that my ratings are consistent with the general consensus. However, in this case I'm surprised by the negative rating and reviews for this one and find that it is one of the few cases that I massively overrated a brew as compared to the average. I'm really not sure what so many people are turned off by here. I could maybe understand how the sweetness is a turn off but not on such a massive scale. Granted this is not the best porter I have had by a long shot, however, I find it to be a pleasant brew that I would have no problem drinking again.","Gajo74","Dec 20, 2014"

3.11,-1,3,3.25,3,3,3.25,"The taste is more caramel than porter with a slight diacetyl type of buttery element with light brown sugar and mild vanilla extract creamy/sweet blend The malt has a mild toasted grain feel, but also seems kind of adjunct flavored like candy corn, not a great flavor but does have the caramel the label promises, just not caramel malt. Overall a pretty average beer, but not a very good porter -it seems like the gimmick of putting caramel in front of the style is more important than it tasting like a porter -seems like caramel extract dominates the flavor of this.","Slatetank","Jan 09, 2013"

3.65,16.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured into a New Belgium globe glass. Color is a deep rich mahogany, too light for a usual porter, yet too dark for a brown ale. The head is a fluffy pillow of cream that dissipates to a wisp of bubbles across the top. Sticky, random lacing. The aroma of sweet caramel dominates. The taste is very simple and straightforward: roasted malts and tons of sticky sweet caramel. I'm not detecting any sort of burnt malt porter taste anywhere though. The mouthfeel is just about right for a porter. Overall, this beer is one of those overly sweet dessert beers that goes down way too smooth because of said sweetness. If the ABV was higher, you could really get in trouble here, but it's okay at 5.4%. I probably should have bought a single bottle of this instead of a six pack, because the cloying sweetness is just too much to session with. I also didn't feel like I drank a porter, at all. I'll call Saranac immediately and ask them to re-name it as Saranac Caramel Brown Ale!","JuicesFlowing","Nov 01, 2011"

The taste brings the roast and caramel back, now joined by a hint of licorice, a sharp stab of mild blueberry (okay...), a wave of vanilla, some random pinpricks of raisins and figs, and it all wraps up together into an oatmeal raisin cookie-esque configuration.

There is a little bit of lacing, but not much. It's too dark of a beer to see if there is any carbonation rising within. The aroma is a good mixture of roasted malts and caramel sweetness. The beer has a very strong caramel flavor, it overpowers almost everything else. It's not like a caramel malt, but more like the center of a piece of candy. It's a bit surprising, but enjoyable. The caramel hits you as soon as the beer touches your tongue and lasts until you swallow. Near the finish is a bit of toasted malt sweetness that is distinctly separate from the caramel flavor. All of the sweetness contributes to a tangible film that coats your mouth. There is a lot of carbonation that you can feel on your tongue.

The palate opens sweet, with (surprise!) caramel, some sugar and malt with a little roast, before a long, dry finish with a metallic character comes through.

Crimson red hues shine through when the beer is held up to the light. I think this is a very pretty porter. Aroma is sweet; almost too sweet. Caramelish notes are oddly mixed in with burnt coffee smells and butterscotch. I'm strangely attracted to this smell and repulsed by it at the same time, hence the 2.5 grade for smell. Definitely rich and malty aroma, with no real sense of hops. The taste simply adds to this bizarre experience. I expected this beer to be sweet up front, but it's not. It's bitter up front, and the caramel/vanilla sweetness emerges in the middle, and is followed up again in the finish by a bitter-tart burnt coffee flavor. Weird stuff here. A thin mouthfeel, but not offensive. I'm not entirely sure I would call this a ""drinkable"" beer, but I'm glad I tried it. It might go well with dessert; maybe a creme brulee, or a rice pudding. But otherwise I wouldn't wholeheartedly recommend this beer unless you like strange sweet/bitter beers.","Atlas1","May 10, 2007"

Only hints of black patent roast and chocolate malt character exist. Not impressive aromawise. Prevalent in flavor is an expected, steadfast caramel syrup backbone, although malt makes its presence known. Mild notes of bittersweet black malt and baker's chocolate offer token depth. Meager in hop bitterness, leaving ample residual sweetness, but thankfully it's not sugary or cloying in nature, partially due to the high apparent attenuation. Lightly bodied, and a notch above watery in mouthfeel. Devoid of esters, and thus quite ""clean"" in overall flavor profile. Sweetness approaches cola like as it warms, but mercifully halts at a dilute caramel chew like level. Finishes quickly, with a fleeting snap of burnt malt and butterscotch. An odd brew. There aren't any real strengths in character here. A rather insipid porter. Caramel brown ale would be a more appropriate moniker. Yawn.","marc77","Jun 07, 2004"

Head disappears quickly without significant lacing. Nose is of caramel(no surprise) and a hint of smokiness. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, but seems somewhat watered down. Taste is sweet malted caramel, not much else. This one is worth sampling for the caramel that dominates from the nose to the finish. Very interesting, certainly, and its faults make it more drinkable for my tastes. Only a slight hops aftertaste which makes for a smooth experience if you can deal with all the caramel.

Flavor: Doesn't kill me with over caramel tone but it complements the darker roasts and provides an excellent sweetness that gives it vanilla like tones.

It's clearly from an extract; and it's a bit odd, perhaps, but not off-putting. The body is medium; and it's smooth and creamy in the mouth due to a very fine and moderate carbonation - anything else would work against the sweet maltiness that's present in the flavor. The caramel that's promised is certainly delivered, although I wonder where the porter side of things went? There are some toasty notes, and a mild chocolate character; but its more of a sweet, winter dessert beer than anything else.

4.29,36.6,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours with a beige head over darkish red liquid. Intense caramel candy aromas in the nose. Taste is a wonderful mix of caramely burnt sugar, some light molasses and sweet malts. Finishes sweet and mellow. An offbeat but very enjoyable and drinkable brew...I wish this was a regular offering!","beerluvr","Nov 11, 2002"

4.32,37.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Wow, the reviews for this are all over the place. Consider me in the ""liked it"" category. Liked it quite a bit, actually. FX Matt knows their malts and this brew is no exception. Dark amber/light brown translucent brew with light tan head that fluffed, then wisped away. First taste is malts, caramel. Some butter in the aroma, and in the near finish. Piney hops are very subtle and caramel sweetness brings this one home. To me, is reminiscent of a baltic porter without the licorice and currant hints. If you like sweet stouts or caramel malts this one is right up your alley. I can understand how others thought this was too sweet and candylike, but for me the lack of bitterness was no problem.","Thrasher","Aug 22, 2002"
3.25,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Deep ruby brown color with a small head.  Sweet winey & caramel toffee nose.  Very buttery with high diacetyl level.  Flavor is sweet, caramel and toffee with a deep base creaminess.  Saranac's house yeast is present and the beer lacks a certain bitterness that would help balance out the sweetness","Andy","May 07, 2002"
4.09,30.3,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"This in one of the most unique beers around.  If you are looking for a lighter bodied porter to have as a desert, this one is you target.  The caramel aroma and flavor is quite profound and enjoyable in limited quantities.","beernut7","May 06, 2002"
3.99,27.1,3.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"This pours a deep amber color (a bit light for the style) with a nice off white fluffy head that holds pretty well.  The smell is a delicious mix of roasted malt and caramel.  The first and last taste to hit the tongue is caramel.  It is almost like drinking some caramel candies.  There is a nice roasted/burnt characteristic in the background of the flavor.  The body is a bit thin for a porter.  The moutfeel is creamy and smooth.  The beer loses a few points in the drinkability because of its sweetness.  This is not an everyday beer.  Not something you would want to have to refresh you at all but it would fit in nicely as a dessert beer which is how I am currently enjoying it.","Murph","Apr 19, 2002"
2.33,-25.8,2.5,2,2,4,2.5,"This tastes like someone took a bad beer and melted a few caramels in it.  How can they justify calling this porter?  Very disappointing.","JahNoth","Apr 10, 2002"
4.1,30.6,4,4,4,5,4,"Wow! Over the top caramel and toffee sweetness, but give Saranac credit for trying something different. Brewers should take chances with styles and go for broke and see what happens. I enjoyed this beer for what it was. Subtle hop finish balances a bit and I really didn't feel like the caramel was a cloying sweetness. Kudos to Saranac, try another!!","QXSTER1","Jan 01, 2002"
1.42,-54.8,4,2,1,1,1,"The first thing i noticed was the smell. It smelled exactly like caramel. The taste though, was just like the butter used on movie theatre popcorn. Needless to say i didn't like this beer at all. I don't think i have ever tried a beer that just didn't taste like beer.","xXTequila","Nov 26, 2001"
3,-4.5,3,3,3,3,3,"Three cheers to Saranac to have the balls to brew stuff like this, but it's not exactly someting you want more than one of (maybe that's why they only put them in their mixed twelve packs).  I neither love it nor hate it.  It just is what it is, and it's not bad at that.  Got it?","pbrian","Oct 23, 2001"

2,-36.3,2,2,2,2,2,"Didn't like this at all.  I really like porters but this one just turned me off completely.  Imagine a porter with no discernable bitterness and a melted rolo mixed in.  The caramel flavor was too much, overpowering the brew and making it taste like a novelty beer cocktail.","javier","Jul 06, 2001"
