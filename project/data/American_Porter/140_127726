4.42,9.4,4,5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"I Pop!ped the cap and began a very gentle pour as it was possible that there may be lees in the bottle's punt. As I poured, I could see a tiny amount and although it probably would not have mattered, I left it there for a final pour. The bartender's trick raised a finger of deep-tan head that fell back down, leaving noce lacing in its wake. Nose held a melange of odors - "" toffee, caramel, chocolate, coffee, and dark fruit"" and who would I be to disagree?  Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Mouthfeel was dense, creamy, like a dollop rather than a draught. Man, this was one intense festival of flavors. Caramel, chocolate and coffee were immediate on the tongue, followed by toffee and dark fruit. It was difficult to parse all of them, but they were there at one point or another. Finish was semi-sweet, thanks especially to the coffee and dark chocolate flavors. The all-important last pour was like dark chocolate and a tinge of mint, as though the hops had been hiding out all this time. Good stuff!","woodychandler","Feb 11, 2015"

4.5,11.4,,,,,,"Dark sugars dominate the nose seasoned with light coffee, roast and chocolate. A deep brown column of beer supports a 1” moussey tan foam cap that marks each sip with a thick line of lace. The beer’s palate impresses with the range of Maillard reaction flavors – kettle carmelization flavors from boiling the wort vigorously for a long time mingle with a variety of roast malt flavors with some yeast driven dark dried fruit in the middle with bitter hop and roast flavors rising in the finish. A light caramel undertone and the interaction between the two types of Maillard reactions provide an interesting reaction and rounds off any harsh or rough notes. The rich creamy texture and chewy body elevate the beer.","pat61","Sep 29, 2014"

Taste same as aroma with mild bitterness and mild roasted notes. A full bodied creamy and smooth mouth feel. Finish is sweet dark caramel malt, taste of maple, a bit of dark fruit in there, ending has some sweet alcohol notes. Has a good dark malt character with mild bitterness, alcohol is well behaved on the palate. Overall a rich full flavored very tasty and enjoyable brew.","Samp01","Sep 29, 2014"

Rich, stout like mouthfeel, plus carbonation, lingering roast bitter finish. Wow. This was really nice. I did not realize it was a porter until smelling it.

It doesn’t have the roast of a porter or stout, the chewy fullness of a barleywine or Strong Ale, or the hoppy dynamic of an American Black Ale. It’s just big, dark (but not particularly roasty), smooth, complex, and delicious.","fmccormi","Sep 08, 2014"

Aroma of dark roasted coffee is very dry with some chocolates notes and light caramel malt notes as well. Taste is a powerful assault of roasted malt and dark coffee which is quite dry but also avoids being astringent which is great. Some cacao notes and light caramel notes can also be detected. Body is lighter than expected with medium carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Hard to pinpoint to an exact style but very nice beer with good amount of complexity while retaining good drinkability.","Phyl21ca","Aug 26, 2014"

Scents of rich toffee, sweet caramel, black coffee and luscious chocolate balanced together with hints of alcohol and undertones of dark fruit, especially raisin, with slight cinnamon-like spiciness discernible. An excellent, malt, rich and complex aroma that is remarkable in its balance. Very nice. Flavor begins sweet with toffee, caramel, dark fruit, especially raisin, milk chocolate and coffee flavors mingling with faint notes of alcohol. The middle changes tone slightly with rich milk chocolate becoming the most prominent flavor, alongside hints of coffee and a more pronounced alcohol flavor. The finish is slightly drier with notes of black coffee, semi-sweet chocolate, heavy amounts of dark fruit and a pronounced, though not overwhelming, alcohol warmth. Aftertaste is semi-dry with notes of roast malt, strong black coffee and hints of cocoa powder. A wonderfully rich, complex and malty flavor profile that is warming and pleasant. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with light carbonation and a smooth, slick feel with a touch of alcohol burn. Very nice and drinkable, quite pleasant. Overall this is a fantastic dark ale. It is complex and rich in aroma and flavor and with a wonderfully pleasant mouthfeel. It seems like the perfect Winter beer and is simply wonderful to drink.","Auraan","Aug 16, 2014"

Is it worth $2 a bottle? You bet. Is it worth the $22 you have to pay for the Beer Camp 12-pack? Maybe. Money aside, this is an outstanding beer.","robear","Aug 12, 2014"

Thick and rich, this offering has the aromas of dark bittersweet chocolate, caramel malts, toffee, a hint of coffee, and a touch of sour cherries. Taste is up front splendid chocolate explosion with a touch of coffee, caramel malts to the back, toffee and cherry like flavors on the aftertaste with a very light bittering hop. Fantastic mouthfeel, chewy and lightly carbonated. Stout lovers, listen up, GET IT WHILE YOU CAN. This is one to contact them on for a continual brewing.

Also, now that I've trekked through all 12 beers, I should say that a good 1/3 to 1/2 of the box were beers well above average in their individual styles, and only a couple that really fell short for me. I can only imagine that the undertaking of collaborating with twelve different breweries is hard enough in and of itself, let alone to do it and put out nothing but solid beers. I sincerely hope that Sierra Nevada continues with this format for next year's Beer Camp, as it really makes the process of trying the beers a lot of fun. I'd gladly pay $25 for 12 beers of this quality, some from breweries that wouldn't ordinarily come to my neck of the woods.","LambicPentameter","Aug 06, 2014"

Pours fairly pitch black color with a 2 finger dense and rocky tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, caramel, toffee, raisin, light char, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, fruitiness, and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, brown bread, light char, light nuttiness, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, brown bread, light char, light nuttiness, herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, fruitiness, and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly creamy, and lightly chalky/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial porter style. All around great complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, fruitiness, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 01, 2014"

Date, fig, and raisin are supported by a darkly bitter, roasted coffee backbone. Richly sweet molasses character highlights throughout, as well.

Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and smooth with a good amount of carbonation. I liked this brew a lot, it's easily my favorite of the Beer Camp brews I've had so far (this one is #11).

Beautiful Mahogany color with a thick mocha head, the aroma was a combination of a Imperial stout & Old Ale, both aroma & flavor of sweet toffee, chocolate, vanilla, & caramel, but it wasn't all sweet, it had a balanced hop presence in the finish to keep it honest. I would call this an Imperial Brown, Well Done","SiRCRX","Jul 26, 2014"

4.31,6.7,4,4.25,4.5,4,4.25,"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, showing light only at the edges in the glass with a nice medium brown head with good retention and lacing. Nice aroma of sweet toasted malt, chocolate, dark dried fruit, slight lactose. Flavor follows, starting with toasted malt, milk chocolate, dried dark fruit and a hint of coffee with lighter fruit flavors, caramel developing as the chocolaty malt seems to grow a bit more intense. Finishes with a very great light fruit and chocolate malt combination that lingers pleasantly after the taste. Medium bodied with light creaminess. One of the rare beers that starts nicely and just gets better as one savors it, and finishes with super lingering flavors. I really liked this. I've been extremely happy with four I've tried from this pack, but this is probably my favorite so far. Without being strongly flavored, has a consistently nice taste throughout.","LiquidAmber","Jul 25, 2014"

4.19,3.7,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4,"The beer pours a slightly tan head that dissipates a bit quickly. The beer itself is an opaque brown that is slightly darkish brown but close enough to brown to make it hard to distinguish between. The beer smell consists of strong coffee and vanilla smell. The beer has other lighter notes such as a burnt sugar smell as well as a light and barely noticeable chocolate/toffee notes with no noticeable hop notes. The taste is a bit different than the smell. The taste is certainly more bitter with a slightly noticeable bitter hop note underneath all of the roasted malts. The taste has a stronger chocolate note than smell but the vanilla notes stays the same even though the coffee note has diminished a little bit. The mouthfeel is a bit heavy with biting carbonation. The feeling is a bit thick but still somewhat smooth. Overall, a fantastic brown ale and exactly what I expected from the collaboration of two very good breweries. My only complaint is that this won't be available after the Beer Camp run.","HattedClassic","Jul 25, 2014"

Nose expresses roast and a hint of lactose and artificial sweetener. Taste consistent with nose; however, the roast is nicely prominent as well as chocolate malt. There's also a trace of dark fruit and coffee grounds towards the back. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to medium) with a slightly prickly carbonation that leaves a residual tingle at the finish.

4.32,6.9,4,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Pours a dark dirty motor oil brown capped by a one and half finger beige head. Above average retention, splotchy lacing randomly distributed on the inside of the glass. Roasted chocolate malt and brown sugar on the nose. Opens with brown sugar, dark chocolate and big roasted notes. Burnt caramel and toffee blend with espresso notes, more charred chocolate malt, and some discernible bittering hops on the finish. Heavier side of medium bodied, smooth, and silky. Moderately carbonated. This is a really unique enjoyable brew that combines characteristics of an imperial stout, porter, and brown ale. One of the best brews I've enjoyed so far that is part of the 2014 Summer Camp pack.","chanokokoro","Jul 14, 2014"

With some hops coming though, giving a fruit aspect in the taste. This is by far my favorite in this pack. I truly mean it this time. It's one of my favorite ""Dark Ale's"" which is code for stout.","Celtics17","Jul 07, 2014"
