3.98,-2.2,4,3.5,4,5,4,"The beer pours a deep black brown with a nice finger-width sand-dune-tan head that fizzles slowly away to leaving light clouds and strings of lacing on the glass. The body is too dark to tell if it‚Äôs hazy or not, and it also perfectly masks carbonation bubbles, making it a lovely thing to look at. The beer smells in the medium range of potency with nice roasted coffee sitting somewhere in the French roast range. Malts are obviously also present, tending to nice roasted notes that confuse themselves with the coffee aroma, just as they should. Slight caramel and toffee notes are also present and faint leanings towards burnt bread. The beer tastes wonderfully rich with coffee flavors and astringency. The taste opens as slight sweet caramel and then blossoms into roasted heaven with heavy coffee and roasted malt notes. The bitters come nicely off the close of the taste and linger in waves in the mouth. Mouthfeel has just a whisper of effervescence but is velvety and chewy on the tongue with a perfect body to it. Overall this beer is a terrific example of a coffee porter, and is very drinkable and pleasant. The folks at Berkshire know how to do malts, and they do them well. It doesn't really pair well with smoked gouda; though it does bring out more of the smoke in the cheese it cuts right through the coffee taste of the beer. Try this beer, though, it is a tasty malty treat that will go well with a warm fire place or a cool crisp fall day.","Maxwell","Oct 04, 2012"

The taste is very similar, though the coffee is somewhat toned down a bit, leaving the roasted malts to come further to the fore. The body is a slightly hefty medium, with a light carbonation and a fairly velvety feel. Overall, a solid porter, with a delightfully balanced coffee flavor.

The finish tantalizes my taste buds with hints of cocoa. I know this is a coffee porter, but the coffee is actually a little overpowering. I wish it was a little more subtle. The body is a little more light than what I would generally expect from a beer like this and the carbonation is a little more than preferred. I do wish this was a little heavier.

Nothing over the top about it but it's just great and easy to drink. I've had this in the bottle too but it's definitely worth trying again on nitro-tap (which I think Dive Bar permanently has), great in either version. Great price for this too.

Vigorous pour into a tulip produces a light tan 1 finger head, dissipates to leave a very thin tan head over a black body. Huge coffee, black malt nose. Coffee dominates the taste followed closely by those dark roasted malts, surprisingly sweet with just a hint of espresso like astringency. Very smooth, medium/full body, mild carbonation.

The taste was sheer bliss, like someone took an iced coffee, dumped some caramel and bittersweet dark chocolate flavoring in it, and spiked it with alcohol.

Roast hit mid-palate and it ended with caramel and toffee mixed with light hops. Coffee lingered in the finish. Medium bodied with lowish carbonation, decent texture.

Taste here is very interesting. Lots of coffee up front with some roasted malts and chocolates in the background. It also has some hoppy bitterness/citrus to it which adds a nice element to the brew. Beer leaves a coat of coffee on the tongue and reminds of the after taste of a nice black coffee, some citrus in the after taste too. Mouthfeel is good, light to medium and smooth, no alcohol taste in this beer at all, good carbonation too.

Pours a very dark brown (its not quite black, and is almost a deep ruby red around the edges where the light peaks through). A nice thick tan head rests atop, and leaves solid lacing as you sip it. A nice bitter coffee aroma awaits in the nose, its backed up by a faint roasted malt, but coffee is the dominant player here. First sip follows suit to the aroma, a very nice bitter coffee flavor as well. While I have never had a coffee porter, this stands up to the coffee stouts I have had, in terms of a good coffee add. In this case, the coffee flavor is front and center, and almost overtakes the beer. Rather thick for a porter, which made me wonder if you poured this for someone, and didn't tell them it was a porter, if they would assume it is a stout. Had this early on a Saturday, and wished I held it until the end, it would be a nice way to cap off a hearty meal in the winter.","bhalter8","May 24, 2009"

Flavor consists of mildly bitter coffee, roasted grains, and a touch of vanilla. I would have liked a fuller body and a bit more carbonation, but this is only a minor gripe.

4.32,6.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"22 oz. bottle, unfiltered and unpasteurized. This is essentially Drayman's Porter with ""natural flavor added;"" the flavor being an extract of Dean's Beans organic coffee made specially for Berkshire Brewing. The beer pours a deep, dark maroon (blood red when held to light), with low carbonation and a two-finger beige cap that recedes after a few minutes, depositing several wisps of lace. Roasted coffee and dark malts first jump to the nose, quickly followed by milk chocolate-covered espresso beans and a touch of nutty yeast. Tastes of iced coffee up front, followed by roasted malts, then come the floral/spicy hops. It has a mild bitterness along with a lightly sour or acidic note from the coffee and a backing of black malts. Fairly light in body, with ample, lightly-tingly carbonation and a dry, coffee-flavored finish. Pretty good porter here - definitely adds another dimension to the Drayman's, but perhaps I was expecting exceptional. Regardless, this is a tasty brew that I would gladly revisit.","mmmbeer","Jul 03, 2008"

That coffee taste balances well with the malt, but the coffee dominates and everything else is just playing a supporting role. The malt backbone is surprisingly lighter than expected.

Taste was very unique, as it has a very distinct coffee (almost cappuccino) characteristic blended into that hearty porter flavor. Very nice. The only knock that I have against this beer is that it has a very thin body. I have had it a few times at Deep Ellum which serve it on nitro tap. That seems to give it much more heartiness. A bit on the watery side for my liking. But on the flip side, I could see myself more easily drinking these than the heavier nitro version.

The craftsmanship is great and the blend of coffee in the beer is the epitome of restraint. Since Dean's Beans don't overthrow the quality porter in this excellent coffee flavored ale.

Flavor is very nice. It hits first with a mild ground coffee followed by a solid roasted malt that lends notes of bitter chocolate followed with a mild pine hop, that moves into a nice bitter mocha flavor. I enjoy how the coffee bookends the rest of the flavors. Mouthfeel is moderate with a moderate carbonation that works well with the brew. Overall, I am a fan of this one.

Has a thick taste, starting with mouth rolling malty sweetness followed by coffee and chocolate malts. These flavors dominate the hops, which come forward after swallowing. Serve this one at cellar temps or slightly warmer, as these flavors get lost at fridge temps. Carbonation does it's job, delivering aroma and amplifying the body, and doesn't make itself a vehicle for belching. Very drinkable on a Christmas Eve.","altgeeky1","Dec 24, 2007"

The nose is dominated by strong, dark, roasty coffee malts. Light hints of caramel comes through as well, sweet, rich and full nose. No hoppy florals or fruity esters are noticeable. The taste is very proper to what I expected from a coffee porter. Coffee flavor is strong, roasty, sweet and quite like black coffee. No hops flavors. I lost the caramel from the nose, but picked up a bit of cocoa. The bitterness is mild in the mid/after taste. Dry finish. Very light warming. Very full and heavy in the mouth, low carbonation adds both to the heaviness and the coffee-esque qualities. Not entirely complex for a porter, but it's really quite tasty and richly flavored and well done as a 'coffeehouse.'

Taste is much like the draymans porter I had the other day that must be the base for this beer, with some tweeking--the addiction of the cofeee is not as overpowering, and seems to do this brew right. The flavor is present, complex, and adds dimension that balances out the unfermentables, makes it taste more like a porter (the roasting factor) than the drayman's, and an odd milkshake cream kind of flavor is present as well in the mix. As I continue to sip I can taste a bit more of the earthy malts and unfermentables behind the coffee flavor than I'd like to here, and even a tad more hops wouldn't hinder the flavor either, but overall, delicious enough to make even those who might not like porters want more. A hands down delicious brew especially compared to the run-of-the-mill drayman's. Mouthfeel is quite fine here, quite thick and full feeling, but more carbonation burn than the drayman's kept this from a five. Overall, this brew makes it clear why BBC has such a cult following, and will lead me to try more when I'm able.","Liquids","Feb 05, 2007"

What one might expect walking into a coffee house where there were just a bunch of nobodies sitting around doing nothing other tan drinking coffee.

There is also a nice half inch white head with exceptional retention. Aroma is very reminiscent of beers such as Founders Breakfast Stout or Peche Mortel in the dark burnt coffee. Youn can really smell those coffee beans in there. Taste was very similar to the smell, but not nearly as harsh on coffee flavors like the beers mentioned above. To be honest, I did not pick up on many other flavors, maybe a bit of chocolate, but either way it works quite well. Mouthfeel is lighter then I had expected, but it does make it all the more drinkable. If it were any heavier, it might border on being in the stout family. I would let this one warm up a bit as the flavors and aromas pull through even more. I've been sort of tired of porters for a while now, but this one really hits the mark with me.

I drink a lot of coffee stouts and sometimes the coffee is overbearing and takes over the drink. Not in this one. The coffee is blended very well. This is a very good porter.

Taste is coffee, carmel, more coffee, and finishes with a dry red wine, coffee, and carmel liqoirice(?) taste when sipped or in small mouthfuls. Tastes and feels nice.

The finish has a nice molasses flavor following with some more powerful coffee tones and a slight bitter finish that rounds things out but keeps it very drinkable. The mouthfeel to this brew was nicely creamy and medium bodied which led to this being very very drinkable. A fine example of a porter.","bigbeerdrinka","Feb 26, 2005"

3.88,-4.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"On tap at Bukowski's. Pours a very dark brown with a heavy, dirty tan head. Served a little too cold, so I let it warm for a bit. Smells of light roasted coffee, semi-sweetish malt aromas, with a little homebrew twang. I wish it had a stronger coffee aroma. Tastes of roasted bitter coffee throughout. Meaty, semi-sweet chocolatey malt underneath. Finish is bittersweet. Medium-bodied, with a creamy feel. Nice beer, but I'm not sure how clean the tap was!","alexgash","Feb 22, 2005"
4.3,5.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,"Tastes like carbonated, alcoholic coffee; all with a smooth, malty finish. It pours a very heavy, pitch black color. A nice thick, creamy head formed on the beer, and lace coated the entire inside of the glass. The aroma is of chocolate covered coffee beans (hmmm, a favorite). The flavor is heavy Colombian coffee, thick and rich. The alcohol is present, but is hidden way behind the coffee. Matls and chocolate also come through. I want to say hops are present, but they are hiding out of fear of the coffee. The mouthfeel is heavy. Also, kind of like real coffee, I am not sure my stomach can handle more than a couple of bottle of this stuff, just way to rich and acidic from the coffee.","MuddyFeet","Feb 01, 2005"

Coffee/toffee roast on nose immediately with a resonating huskiness of flaked oat. Big mocha and coffee blast is excellent, savory on the mouth, with chocolate and roasted malts in a meaty background. Trailing roasted characters, combined with a medium body and the coffee undertone lead to a highly drinkable brew.","Truh","Jan 12, 2005"

The aromas are of COFFEE, as well as roasted malts, chocolate, and a bit of hops. The taste is very espresso-like up front with some nice roasted malt notes in the middle anda very coffee/chocolate like finish. The mouthfeel was creamy and smooth as all hell and the drinkability was damn good as well. One of the best coffee beers I have had. Excellent stuff.","francisweizen","Nov 12, 2004"

Very smooth and tasty. Very dark brown almost black color had a nice head tanish cream left a nice lacing in the glass. I enjoy a strong flavored beer and this was a great choice. Almost reminded me of a stout but much lighter. Really easy to drink and very enjoyable. I would have this beer any day of the week.","bigone4","Jul 24, 2004"

If you have the chance to try it, don't miss the opportunity.","porter17","Jun 13, 2004"

3.85,-5.4,4,4,3.5,4.5,4,"This gorgeous beer was a deep, translucent brown with a tan head. The aroma was dominated by coffee notes, as was the flavor. This was a nice full-bodied porter, but it sacrificed the complexity for the rich coffee flavor. It was good, but I was hoping for something along the lines of Bell's Java Stout, which has a strong coffee component but also has some other flavors to maintain interest.","AllThingsNinja","Apr 26, 2004"

The color was a deep brown almost black with a nice light brown head. The taste was of coffee with mild hints of chocolate. Medium full to full bodied beer with low carbination is aptly named. It is a brew that is excellent for those cold winter nights. Hope to be able to track more down in the Albany area!","Stimack","Jan 18, 2004"

Pours...you guessed it; black coffee with a light tan head and some sticky lace. The aroma is, of course, mostly coffee, with some malt and hops. A substantial caramel sweet malt body and abundantly hopped with fairly sharp spicy and mild citrus bitterness. Chocolate notes and a hint of camphor astringency. This is a highly gulpable brew!","BeerResearcher","Jul 25, 2003"

4.72,16,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours an opaque black; tan head, not very sticky. Cappuccino and chocolate aromas. Slick, creamy mouthfeel; doesn't have the tendency to dry out the mouth the way many stout and porters seem to. More robust coffee and chocolate in the taste with some caramel maltiness. Hop presence isn't overt but keeps the sweetness in check. Not a particularly complex ale, pretty straightforward, but very tasty and ridiculously drinkable for a porter.","doerickson","Nov 02, 2002"
4.04,-0.7,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours very black with only the barest hints of light getting in around the edge with a nice big, creamy tan head that subsides too quickly but does leave a nice lace behind.  Great bitter, roasted coffee aroma along with some nice roasted/burnt malt smells make this one very appetizing.  The brew starts off with some nice chocolate tastes that overpower the coffee to start with but gently yield to it as the brew tails off the tongue and leaves a nice bitter coffee/burnt/roasted flavor on the tongue.  This brew is a little thin for the style but still remains very drinkable and is definitely something I would try again.","Murph","Aug 14, 2002"
4.02,-1.2,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"750ml brown bottle with two brewers clanking pint glasses and the ""Dean's Beans"" logo smack in the middle. Clear freshness date. Very dark, nearly all black with a beige smooth head. Black malt and ""cold coffee ground"" aromas. Extremely creamy and smooth. Slight taste of earth and some definite coffee flavours that leave a ""day old coffee"" aftertaste -- not very pleasant at all. The malt tries to come through but is murdered by the Dean's Beans. Their cries unheard in the blackness of it all. Reminds us of waking up late and not having time to make fresh coffee so you microwave what's in the pot from the previous day and are surprised by a pretty harsh cup of joe. Perhaps Berkshire should stay away from Porters, especially coffee ones.","Jason","Aug 03, 2002"
