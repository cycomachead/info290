"Thin layer of head. Smells like any porter. Initial taste is of mostly coffee. I could barely taste coconut. I was excited for the coconut but was very let down. Not worth the price"
""
""
"Not into porters just yet... And this drink don't help to much..  Nice flavors but no special kick to it.. Did enjoy the drink."

"Although not my favorite porter by any stretch, I think this deserves props for not being overbearing on the signature ingredient and still conveying some unique character."

"Not a really heavy porter. Tasty, but I couldn't really smell or taste the coconut"

"The taste wasn't that great."

"Delicious coconut and coffee notes on top of a traditional porter flavor."
""
"It smells mildly like coconut, but I wouldn't toss this at any coconut fanatics. They'd be disappointed. But as a nice rich porter, it had a great mouth feel and good flavors."

"O – This is one of my all-time go to beers.  In spite of the darkness, it is highly drinkable any time of the year thanks to the high carbonation and the refreshing, different coconut flavors.  Every time I think I probably won’t like this as much the next time I try it, it surprises me all over again.  Perfectly crafted, preserves well in the can, goes down easy."
"Beer is alright. Like a few others that commented on here it does not taste like any coconut. The beer has a rich coffee like taste that isn't sweet. For the price of a 4 pack here in Hawaii I think it's not worth it.  It's a decent porter in my opinion, but that's about it. It's still a quality beer it doesn't taste cheap. Different strokes for different folks. I love dark beer, but won't be getting another pack of this no time soon."

"If you want to buy this because you like coconut and the idea of a coconut porter sounds delicious, then don't buy this. It's a porter. Bitter espresso finish. Dry cocoa aftertaste. Watery slightly sour mouthfeel. I don't know where they get off calling it coconut. I'm even drinking it with dark chocolate coconut almonds and still, almost nothing. Bit of a metallic taste too when I stretch for the coconut I get an unpleasant metal. Meet disappointed in this beer. Just call it a porter."
""
""
""
"Where's the coconut??"
""
""
""
"T:is a good porter clean tasting, spicyness and licorice. With a SOY sauce taste. Of you have ever had Thai dark soy sauce this is reminiscent of it. But it does not have a sweetened or toasted coconut flavor. It is good for the price point."
"I really liked this beer. One of few I have to completely disagree with the ratings. Maybe people are thrown off by the coconut, but it's a solid porter, with a smooth, full mouth feel, and a well balanced coconut flavor in the finish."
""
"Rated the smell low because I didn't get a lot of coconut on the nose."
""

"O: A solid Porter. There are better alternatives but this brew is still solid. Sadly I got no coconut flavor at all."

"Pour dark wood like brown in color with a big finger and a half fluffy tan head. Aroma is a robust porter to style with notes of coco powder, chocolate malt, herbal hops and a slight metallic note on the end. Taste follows the nose with flavors of coco, chocolate malt, some faint hints of coconut and slightly metallic in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and mildly carbonated."
""
""
""
"On tap at Chuck's 85 St.  Dark colored, not much head and somewhat cloudy.  A little lace lingers with each sip.  Aroma of coffee and espresso with a bit of smoky coconut.  Sweet tasting, with bread and a tad bit of sourness.  Very light for a porter.  Not much carbonation and a fairly short finish."
""
""
""
""
"I've had this from cans & the tap at Maui Brewing. Just a consistently great Porter. Creamy and very very tasteful. Widely available in Maui."

"A good porter with an emphasis on cocoa roasty malts and toasted coconut coming in just below that. Could use just a tiny bit of body to support those flavors."

"O: Expecting lots more coconut here, but still a decent porter."
""
""
"but instead of just putting more into what it says on the label and picture into the actual taste a lot more people would buy this niche beer."
""
""
""
"Overall- Overall a pretty good beer, but I was a little disappointed in this. I was expecting more coconut flavor from a beer with ""coconut"" in it's name."

"Drinkability – The coconut is mild, and I think even people that don’t like coconut would enjoy this. It’s goes down easy, and is a great effort from Hawaii. Another reviewer said this would go well with angel food cake and I think he’s right."

"Pour a dark deep brown with a frothy tan head...."
""
"Terrific. Just terrific. Though I don't smell much of coconut (intentional?) I do sense a hint of that roasted, toasted bite at the end. The mouthfeel isn't too tacky, or tacky at all. Its mellow, but full. Reminds me of Olde Engine Oil, though much more sedated. In a good - in a great way. One things for sure, I'll be coming back for more. Highly recommended."
""
"O - Excellent use of coconut here, wish I could pick up more in the aroma, but the flavor is wonderful"

"Pours a nice deep black with hints of very dark red. Nose has some roast and chocolate, not much coconut. Taste has slight coconut, mainly roast and a cream sensation similar to a milk stout with slight bitter chocolate. Reminds me of a good milk stout and/but certainly quite delicious for a porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a dark, dark brown with a light brown, frothy head that slowly reduces to a thin ring. Lacing is retained around the glass. Smells of chocolate, espresso, roasted malts, and some oak. The coconut is not that dominant which is what I was expecting. Taste is similar to the aroma; roasted malts and chocolate. Medium body with a nice mouthfeel. Goes down smooth and leaves the lips a bit sticky in the end. Overall, a good porter but was left wanting more."
""
"This porter has a nice mouthfeel to it. Dark roasted malts with hints of espresso, chocolate and cocoa. I taste some sugary sweetness with a pleasant toasted coconut profile. There is a mini hop snap on the finish that provides a mini bite."
""
""
""
""
"Picked this up as part of a mixed six on the recommendation of my beer guru, who always steers me right. Excellent looking beer with a very interesting smell, you get the hint of coconut with the smoke, interesting mix. Taste is also surprising, very tasty. Not a big coconut fan, not a big smoke fan in my beer, but it works for me. I was almost surprised how much I like this beer. Very good beer that is very much worth a try because it is very unique, tasty, and easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with ruby highlights and two fingers of tan head with good retention. Nice lacing too. Smells malty and sweet with a hint of toasted coconut, reminds me of some milk stouts I've had. Taste follows with some black malt with coffee, followed by some malty sweetness and hints of coconut. Really well done, not overpowering at all. Mouthfeel is probably the low point for me, a little too fizzy. Overall an outstanding beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: First try of coconut as an adjunct. I like it."
""
""
""
"O: A very good porter.... Coconut is slight but adds that little extra to a very good porter. Very session worthy."

"O: A solid porter and the addition of coconut just makes it that much more enjoyable. I think this could easily be adapted to an oatmeal stout and barrel aged. Now that would be an amazing brew."
""
""
"O: Definitely recommended. I like the blend of coconut and dark roasty flavors."
""
"O - a beautifully well done beer. I am glad i was able to get my hands on it. I havent seen thison the mainland in a couple of years and had only tried it once before at that. The coconut shines and adds a wonderful element to this beer. Highly rec if you can get it! I will be buying a few more packs to bring home to SF."
""
""
""
"O - the nuttiness of the roasted coconut played well with the chocolate flavor. I think its a creative beer that everyone should try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Good specialty porter, it's not something that I would want to drink every day but it's something that is enjoyable every once in a while. For people who like lighter microbrews this could be a nice introduction into the heavier styles."
""
"Overall, a very solid porter. There is room for improvement, but I would recommend it."

"12oz can poured into City Beer Store tulip. Appearance is dark black , tannish minimal head, that diminished to nothing..smell is chocolate malt, coconut, and a little woodsy effervessence as well. Taste is smooth, starts out with semi-sweet cocolate, and finished with a subtle coconut flavor, and roasted malts definately apparent. Mouthfeel is medium/full bodied with bitey carbonation for a Porter..a good summer porter for sure..overall, good, not amazing, however very solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a black color. 1/2 inch head of a brown color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of coconut, sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, hint of yeast, and a hint of hop. Fits the style an American Porter. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of coconut, sweet malt, roasted malt, hint of hop, and a hint of wheat. Overall, good appearance, aroma, blend, and mouth feel. The metallic flavor, hopefully from wheat, was slightly off-putting."
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: While I admit myself a bit let down that Maui Brewing Coconut Porter didn't deliver on the 'coconut' part of its name, I am happy to say it did a great job on the 'porter' part. A good example of the American take on the style with big robustness for a moderate ABV. Would I drink it again? Sure."

"O - Had heard good things and it pretty much lived up to expectations. The only real negative is that I'm left wanting heavier coconut in the flavor profile (-.25). I'd be very surprised if someone picked out that it was brewed with toasted coconut without smelling it first. Despite this it's a very nice wee beer and I look forward to having it on tap next week :)"

"Dark chocolaty color, very foamy light brown head. Smell is traditional porter, a bit of espresso and coconut in it. Flavor starts a bit sour, but mellows a bit in the back of the mouth. I only pick up a hint of coconut, wish it was a bit stronger. Mouthfeel seems a bit bright for a porter, very carbonated. A good porter overall."
""
"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and a pretty good example of the style, it's not a traditional American Porter, but the coconut shows up just enough to compliment the Porter base and not overpower it, it's an American Porter first and a Coconut beer second. This beer had great drinkability, if I was in the mood for a Porter I could see myself drinking few of these, it was smooth, not filling, and the flavors did a nice job at holding my attention. What I liked the most about this beer was the Porter base, it was a very well done Porter with lots of great roasted and chocolate like flavors. What I liked the least about this beer was the lighter coconut flavor, I think the Porter base was strong enough to hold up more Coconut flavors without being overpowered by them, but it didn't hurt this beer as much as I expected. If this beer was available to me I would for sure buy It, I would like to try a can that I know is fresh to see if the coconut is a little more pronounced and I would recommend this to anyone who likes American Porters, even if you aren't the biggest fan of Coconut I think you could still find this beer enjoyable. All in all I enjoyed this beer, it may have not been as coconut forward as I expected but the Porter base was awesome and I'm not sure how more coconut would affect this beer, I have had a couple coconut beers that tasted like Malibu Rum and Sun tan lotion and I wouldn't want that to happen to this beer. This was my first beer from Maui Brewing Company and it made for a good first impression, Maui isn't available in Michigan, but I would for sure like to try more of their beers, nice work guys, Thanks a lot Ben for giving my a chance to try this beer"

"O: Great brew."
""
"Overall this is a great porter than can be consumed in quantity. There are not too many brewers making easily drinkable beers with coconut right now, so this is always a treat to have. I should review this, with a higher score, when I have another can fresh."
""
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas. Solid Porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied but lively carbonation breaks up the body making it feel a bit thinner. Burnt malts on the tip of the tongue along with dark chocolate flavors with a bit of licorice and anise. A little astringent on the back end and overall a lot of roasted flavors. Coconut comes through almost barely and in the form of a ""burnt"" coconut taste. really have to look for it which might be a good thing since i hated kona's coco brown. Goes down nice and easy though for such having so many robust and roasty flavors. A little messy at parts with the coconut flavor adding close to nothing but as a porter not bad. A little pricey but that might have to due with how far it had to travel to get to me."
""
""
"Tired of having IPAs and belgium whites all summer? Try this refreshingly excellent coconut porter that is sessionable even during those hot muggy dog days of summer."
"As long as you aren't expecting to drink a Mounds Bar, and enjoy porters, Maui Brewing Coconut porter is a well crafted and delicious concoction that has the ability to satisfy on a number of levels, and is a really nice way to end the day."

"Interesting gimmick, but it goes a little overkill with the flavor… kind of like a hot sauce that gets its ""reputation"" from merely burning your tongue off. Would love to try it in draft form to see if perhaps it was just a bad batch (as it seems to be well regarded by everyone else on here), but I was wholly unimpressed with the canned variation. Love Maui Brewing Company's other beer though so I wouldn't talk anybody out of experimenting."
""

"pours dark, barely passes the light thru the glass test - none got thru :). head dies quickly to a circle around the rim. faint lacing. aroma is hard to pin down for me, i think the coconut is throwing me off. for some reason i find it reminding me of firestone's velvet merlin, but with a (thankfully) faint hint of coconut. mouthfeel is a bit thin for my tastes, but i tend to like stouts a bit on the thick side. i'm glad i tried it, though i don't think i'll chase it down again. points for justifying their use of a can, rather than bottle, for several reasons (listed on can). an interesting brew to try, if only because it's different."
""
"O- I like that there is subtle coconut flavor here, rather than overkill. It's a flavorful and drinkable dark beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad porter. Coconut adds a welcome level of complexity. Smooth and creamy without being too heavy. Easy drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not quite what I was expecting (I thought more coconut, less hops), but tasty nonetheless. More hops than your typical porter, but it works. Not an every-day beer for me, but one I'll definitely have again. I'm thinking this would pair perfectly with a steak!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkable brew but it soon becomes apparent that after 2 or 3 the game becomes how much coconut flavor can I get out the can before it becomes one dimensional. First beer I've tasted from Maui Brewing, the canned concept and beer are both winners."
""
""
"Solid black pour with a small tannish head that mostly dissipated, leaving a few stray bubbles on top. Aroma of sweet chocolate, roasty malts, not a whole lot of coconut. Taste came off a bit like a Mounds bar, but I found it much too sweet, intense and cloying with sugary sweetness, like coconut candy (I'm assuming there is such a thing). It wasn't entirely bad overall, but just too much for me to handle. It's supposed to be beer, not a malty mixed drink. Body was medium. This one might be for some, but not for me."
""
""
""
"O: Overall, kind of a strange brew. Didnt think much of it at first, but it really grew on me as I slowly drank it. I would drink this again, but wouldnt go out of my way to obtain it."
""
""
"I had this before on tap but it seems a little better than I remember. Anyways, after the finger of head settles which takes a minute or two a slight film of tan lingers. The smell honestly reminds me of fresh cream and a little toasted malt. We know of course that the toasted smell is from the toasted coconut. The toasted coconuts really bring out the taste of the porter but it mellows it at the same time. It's good!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is impressively flavorless. I've really never had a beer with such little flavor. I guess there aren't any flaws, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:. Very tasty and drinkable. Seems sessionable."
""
""
""
""
"O: This was a smooth easy to drink porter with an interesting toasted coconut flavor. Absolutely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I like this beer a lot. Great porter with good flavor and body."
""
""
""
"O/D-Its still a solid beer but I would label this a big disappointment. I have always wanted to try this because I thought I would be getting some huge coconut notes. I leave this beer slightly unhappy. A good Porter, nothing more."
"O: Overall, an above-average beer, and I am glad I got to try it. If I wasn't expecting coconut I would've actually rated it higher, but I felt a little dooped by that expectation. Really good tasting, but I got very little coconut."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A real good flavored porter. Love coconut and this one showcases that very well."
"O-A solid beer, glad to have received it as an extra."
"Overall: Kinda gimmicky. Not enough depth on the nose or tongue but it's a decent brew as a whole nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Considering this is called ""CoConut Porter"" there's not enough coconut smell or flavor on it. It's more like an aftertaste than anything, which is a little bit disappointing. That being said, it's still a good enough porter so as not to be a complete failure. If you're looking to try something different with a lot of coconut flavor in it, this is not it. If you don't mind trying just a regular old porter with a coconut aftertaste, go right ahead."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- very good porter, but I don't really get coconut from this coconut porter."
"This is one of my favorite beers that, sadly, is not available in New England. I'll continue to trade for it though, because I really can't get enough of it. Highly recommended for people that want a porter with something a bit different."
""
"Single can that I picked up in Seattle. Poured into a pint glass. Not much carbonation or lacing. Smell had a hint of coconut, but the taste really lacked it. Tasted more like a weak chocolate porter. Mouthfeel was thin for the style. Lost points with me overall because it really didn't live up to its billing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Well balanced specialty porter. While the coconut didn't come through as its own flavor, it did lend to the overall sweetness. This would be a great on a cold winter night by the fireplace."
""
""
"Tasty stuff - an interesting brew. The coconut certainly comes across, but is relatively restrained and blends well with the malt. The aroma is great, but the taste seems slightly weaker and doesn't linger. The mild acidic note in the background is probably from the coconut. Body is a tad thin and could do with being thicker and creamier. However, this is a solid brew that goes down nicely. The only other coconut beer I've tried is Kona's, and this is better. Well worth giving a whirl if you come across it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I have had this multiple times before and finally get around to reviewing it. It's one of my favorite porters that I can get pretty anytime. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"Things lean towards the sweeter end of things, although that may be expected due to the presence of the coconut, however the malt could have balanced it out some more. I'm not complaining though, I enjoyed this stuff and will seek out some more when the opportunity arises."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer did not impress me at all. It's not bad, however, it does not live up to the reputation it seems to have ""earned"" in my opinion. It a weak flavored porter that leaves something to be desired."
"A very unique and tasty porter, one that I’ve been wanting to try for some time. The coconut is quite forward and not subtle here, so this would be best suited for coconut fans only."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - was impressed by the presentation on the TV show, and the product lives up to it, the feature ingredient is a compliment to the beer rather than a dominator which works very well in this case, now I just need to actually go to Hawaii"
"Enjoyable beer and I would most definitely drink this beer again. Probably would go extremely well with desserts and Hawaiian-inspired pork dishes."
""
""
""
""
"Good enough, but not overly special."
"I have been trying to get my hands on this one for a while. I am not entirely certain that it was worth the wait. The beer was a dark malty color when poured into a snifter. There was about a half inch, off-white head which seemed a little unusual for a porter. The fluffy head made the aroma leap into my nose a little easier, sending notes of malt and flakes of coconut into a scent detector. The initial taste was a dark malty thrust with the coconut hints far in the background. Also present was a hint of nuttiness and something flowery that I could not identify. The thicker texture of the mouthfeel allowed the porter to coat the tongue and lending staying power to taste. For a porter, this is a nice drinker. Like most people, I did not buy this as a porter. The unique coconut spin on a porter is what will draw the attention of drinkers. In this respect, I found the beer disappointing because the coconut was not potent enough overwhelm my palate."
""
""
"Easy to drink and very tasty."
""
""
"Overall pretty good, nice flavors of chocolate, cocoa, vanilla, and lots of toasty coconut. Pretty tasty, but not perfect, and the age shows a little. I would like to try it on draft sometime, hopefully in Hawaii. Wormtown NORM might be the only coconut porter better than this though."
""
""
""
"M: Light to medium body, refreshing, no booze burn at all (pretty lowish ABV so no surprise there), on the dry side. I like!"
"I was very impressed by this . Cheers !!"
""
""
""
"O - Such a tasty porter. I would drink this often if I could get my hands on it regularly. I recommend it."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz can into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a nice black color with a nice 1.5 finger brown foam head that leaves nice lacing down the glass. A very aromatic brew with lots of smell of rich chocolate and some coffee taste. A little blander than I was expecting given the aroma, nice dark malt taste, but little chocolate smell in the taste. This light bodied beer is very drinkable with a nice level of carbonation, but not overly so. Overall, a very good beer."
""
"O) I can see why Washington Post tasters loved this; while a bit of a gimmick beer it's really quite good and a definite change of pace. Not a traditional porter, but very tasty."
"An even porter. The coconut tones seem mild and subdued. I think I was expecting more. It's consistent though. Fairly hearty. I was just expecting some...coconut. Or at least a clearly notable bit of it. I think in this instance, it's more an accent than a feature. And that's alright. The oily nature of this porter works well with it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer has great drinkability with great roasted malt flavors although I didn't really get any coconut flavor"
""
"overall this is a very nice porter. tasty and distinguishable by the coconut character, which sets it apart. not world class territory but very enjoyable."
""
""
""

"I absolutely love this beer and it will become a staple for me. I rarely give 5 out of 5 for any beer. This is rare and wonderful treat. I just recommend letting it warm to about 54 degrees to get the complexity of the flavors. I took my from the fridge and let it set for about 20 minutes before pouring."
"Overall: This was pretty dar delicious, and the glass was gone in 15 minutes."
""
"O: went to Maui on my honeymoon and thought that this was a huge disappointment. The coconut was completely elusive (which makes me think that it must be consumed immediately fresh). Sells in 4-packs for a typical price, but I just don't find this one any more unique than any other porter. Disappointing"
"Overall, if there's such a thing as a ""refreshing"" porter, then this is it. There's coconut here, but it's not as cloying and sweet as you may think. I think this beer is done just right, and very interesting."

"Review from 8/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark, dark brown with an enormous long lasting dark tan head. Nice lacing. Interesting porter aromas of dark malt and something pleasant that doesn't smell like coconut, but must be. Nice porter flavors with roasted malts, cocoa and a hint of coconut. This is the best low ABV porter I've ever had. Nicely done."
""
"overall, this has got to be one of the best porters/dark beers in general i've ever had. i tip my hat to the brewers at maui, this is a damn fine beer."
"O: A damn nice porter with a slight twist...if it were just a touch cheaper, this would be among my regular beers. Definitely a repeat purchase, though."
""
"OVERALL: A fine use of coconut in brewing, this is a world class porter with considerable character. Delicious beer from a remote location."
"A distinctive and enjoyable addition to the porter beer family. Would have liked the head to hang in there. The real draw is the taste -- a pleasing, coffee-like roasted flavor, smoothed out nicely with the roasted coconut sweetness. Good stuff..."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a can into a brandy snifter glass. Ok head on first pour, however nice residual left behind once it settles. Smells strongly of milk and coconut up front with a slight hint roasted malts in the background. Taste upfront is analogous to the aroma; milk and coconut upfront, with the bitter roasted malt taste following soon after. Has a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, I really enjoy this beer. The coconut really tames the porter and blends nicely. I am curious to how this would taste on tap."
"Had this on tap in a pint glass at Vivo! in Ikebukuro, Tokyo. Completely different from the tap compared to the can. Loved it this time! Pitch black, chocolatey looking with a thin dark head. Sweet Kona coffee flavor with a bit of bitter chocolate in the aftertaste. Foams up nicely when you spin it, releasing some macademia nut scents."
"This is a nice concept. The coconut works well with the roasted malt character. Unfortunately, it's more bitter than what I'd look for in a porter. I wouldn't turn this down in the future."
""
"Canned on 9/12/2011. Pours a dark brown body with a one finger high khaki head. Aroma is pretty standard for a porter. Roasted malts, light chocolate and coffee. Just a touch of the coconut. Flavor is kind of a let down. Bitter roasted malts with some dirty coffee. Almost no coconut presence. I know this wasn’t fresh, but I was excited to find this on a road trip. Pretty weak."

"O- This is a great tasting beer, I think it would compliment fish and fruit very nicely. I could hold its own with some spicy stuff I think, Thai Spicy not Mexican Spicy. Tasty. The Coconut does get lost a little in the beer but I would have another!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Good porter but nothing outstanding. Coconut was pretty hidden with only a hint of sweet coconut. A nice balanced porter but it isn't really a spice/herb/flavored type beer. Nothing special to seek out, but a nice porter if it is around."
"Overall I guess I can't find this anymore but it was worth putting down the coin. A balanced porter with mild coconut flavors."
"Beer is medium-bodied with noticeable, but ""soft"" carbonation, causing this to foam up slightly on the palate and have an overall mouthfeel of smoothness. A bit watery around the edges and in the closing moments, a bit of a disappointment there. Closes out dry and satisfying."
""
""
""
"O - Overall there are some really nice flavours and appearance but perhaps this was an old can as the aroma and mouthfeel were both rather lacking."
""
""
""
"Overall, this was a pretty solid porter. The coconut shows up in the nose, along with some coffee. The coconut didn't really show up in the taste, however. The beer ended up being a little thin, but I definitely liked it overall."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I have drank this beer many times and I thought that I had already reviewed it, but I didnt. I love craft beer in a can and its a tasty beer as well! If you like your porters the coconut in this beer gives this beer a nice unique twist that you must try!"
""
"O - A nice porter, but I was actually hoping for more. That said, I would drink this often if it was available in cans around my area. I love Porter's, and the coconuts are just about the perfect level (perhaps a tad more would be nice). Good stuff."
"Pours a two finger khaki head that fades to thin layer, leaving some lace. Black color, no highlights. Light carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Smell: hints of chocolate and flavor is burnt chocolate and coconut. $5.50 for a 12oz can on Norwegian Cruise Line Pride of America off Hawaii. From my notes 5/30."
""
"Fun little brew. Perhaps an appropriate summer porter. Nothing artificial about it. Has great character. Pick up a can."
"O - This is a fun beer to have access to. Definitely a sweet one though full of flavors and aromas of not only coconut but also sweet vanilla bean and chocolate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Drinkable, but poorly executed."
""
""
""
""
""
"Anyway. Nothing too ""wow"" about this one, but it's nice and I thank DA for it. Just like hot chicks on the beach."
""
"O- Glad I got to try this, probably wouldn't seek it out, but a nice beer, definitely the best (and only) canned porter I have had."
""
"A very tasty porter, wherever you're coming from - the coconut guest star doesn't overstay its welcome, and leaves the place better for having participated, giving the big chocolate malt a worthy dance partner, in the absence of the more traditional offsets. Yum."
""
""
""
"Poured from a can into a nonic pint. Dark black, some lacing on the glass. Moderate carbonation. Very light mouthfeel. Toasty, chocolate malt flavor. Little to no sweetness. Minimal alcohol heat, and not necessarily getting the coconut. Very easy to drink."
"The beer pours a deep, dark brown with a large tan head that fades quickly. The nose is an intense toasted coconut and the taste follows (older cans have a much faded coconut presence). It's a really smooth porter (watery, drinkable, light-ish bodied) and is highly drinkable...coconut is just an added benefit. This is a very tasty beer that is completely worth trying."
"Cheers!!"
""

"O: This isn’t a gimmicky beer because the coconut is well incorporate into the taste and helps accentuate it. It is also rather sessionable."
"O: While this beer has the look of a stout, it is much lighter and easier to drink. The beer is very easy to drink and could be quite sessionable. I love the toasted coconut flavor without any additional sweetness, makes this beer very delicious. Definitely one to get again though next time might warrant a trip to Maui :)"
"Overall: This is a a really good porter, rich, robust flavor, and very satisfying. However, the coconut is an undertone, I was hoping for more pronounce flavor. I enjoyed very much."

""
"Had this for dessert with a coconut chocolate cookie (Pasja's kokosawa). Divine!"
"Overall-This beer was my go to beer when in Hawaii. From haupia to shave ice to plate lunches I would try this beer with just about anything. A big Mahalo to the folks over at Maui Brewing. This is brewing done right."
"Roasted caramel coconut nose--nice foamy head. Very dark brown body. Medium to full-bodied with boozy and crisp roasted malts dominating the mouth feel...leaving a dark coffee aftertaste that fades from bitter to bitter-sweet. A big tasting porter for its ABV but refreshing and satisfying nonetheless."
""
""
"Thanks to mulder1010 for introducing me to this a year or so ago, an eternal favourite. Does what it says very, very well. Fun, enjoyable and sessionable. And its in a can. Love it."
""
""
""
""
"The medium body makes this very drinkable for such a dark beer. It is smooth and slick with no traces of stickiness or coating. The carbonation is very fizzy, cutting the body and increasing drinkability. While it does make dissecting the flavors a little difficult at the beginning of each sip, it does create a very enjoyable experience and slightly foamy swallow."
""
"O - A good offering from Maui Brewing. I think the flavors somewhat struggle within the beer to really blend to a cohesive flavor. It's good but could be great. I'd still happily put a few down there for something different than the usual Porter."
""
"eh. pours a dark foamy brown with a nice tan head. smells artificially sweet, with rich roasted chocolatey malts. flavor isnt bad, but the coconut doesnt seem real. i have to be fair, i had this side by side with kona's coconut brown ale (which was exceptional) so it seemed less authentic than the kona version. that said, its got a nice round flavor with a very sturdy dark malt base that works well with the coconut. feel is okay, maybe a little heavier than id want to drink in the islands, and the aftertaste is a bit funny, but i cant place it. i think i would rate this higher if i didnt have the kona product at the same time, as coconut beers go, that one is the pick, but this is worth a shot if you like the tropical additives."

"D: a very flavorful american porter here. like i said the coconut is a nice touch. wish it wasnt so pricey (at least as much as it is in the northern VA area) or i would buy a lot of this."
"Although this isn't a very complex beer and I didn't necessarily notice coconut, the coffee sweetness and sugary sweetness, along with the milk chocolate, are all deliciously delightful. It just tastes too good. A fine offering from Maui Brewing Company."
""
"O - This is a really nice porter. Disappointed in the lack of coconut but hey... it's great for just being a porter!"
"DEcent, intereting but not at all earth shattering. But I would definitely seek it out again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium thick and tightly carbonated. Not what I was expecting. A very good beer. Fairly intense, full flavored porter that doesn't pull punches. That said, I know of a couple of beers that do the same - more coconut, please."
"A really good porter with just the right amount of coconut to make it interesting without making it weird. Not the greatest ever, but cool for being unique and having a good flavor and I would have it again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall fears were confirmed. I did get a nice chocolate nose, but on tasting I was shocked at how sapplingly dry this ale is. I also did not get any hint of coconut whatsoever. If anything this tasted like maybe some husk was in this particlar batch. Overall the noticable alcohol taste along with a quite harsh dry roasted malt made this one I would avoid (in a can) in future."
""
"Could use a thicker mouthfeel."
"Serving Temp 42F warmed to 52F before finish."
"mouthfeel is also nice - smooth, well carbonated and well balanced. great beer. I am gonna seek out more of this stuff."

"Overall a very enjoyable beer with a substantial amount of roast, not hugely influenced by coconut though."
""
""
""
""
""
"A good year-round go-to beer."
"overall - I could drink alot of these, this is a great porter to take to the beach or just to grab a six pack of for game day. Awesome."
"Served at cellar temperature, but seemed a little fuller as it approached room temperature."
""
""
"O - Good porter but slightly disappointing in the lack of coconut flavour. Recommended but it won't blow your socks off."
"Overall: This is a nice little porter. At first I was pleased that it wasn't too sweet, but I think it could have a little more sweetness and residual sugar too improve mouthfeel."
""
"O - Maui's Coconut Porter is a great take on the porter style. I didn't find the coconut to be all that strong, but I have a feeling it accounts for the sweetness and great balance. Extremely well done and I look forward to having this brew again and Maui's other beers."
""
""
"O - A fine porter that I would buy more often if it wasn't so expensive."
""
""
"The mouthfeel of this beer is quite nice, carbonation and body are both on the moderate side, and drinkability is actually quite high - not session able, but pretty good. Overall it is an extremely enjoyable experience drinking this beer."
"O: Overall I really like it, rich and chocolaty. Although I wish there was a bit more of the toasted coconut flavor in there."
""
""
""
""
""
"Just got this in a Total Wine Alexandria, thought i would give it a go. pretty slandered porter appearance: dark brown with tan head that is retained the whole time. smells of coffee and coconut(go figure). wow the taste is really exceptional, with a rosty coffee note fallowed by lots o co-co-nut. a solid porter with a nice twist. the coconut really works with the other flavors,looks like ill getting a four pack"
""
"Epic brew from Maui! Light nutty brown pour from 12oz. can. Nice two finger frothy head and a real coconut aroma. The coconut hits the nose immediately and is a proper introduction to what flavor was to come. Great coconut flavor, not overly sweet, and well balanced with a malty mocha notes. The creaminess of the beer is spectacular, it's richness in body is truely unique in my experience with porters. Grade A Maui, hopefully I won't have to drive 12 hours to get your next offering!"
"Overall I found this to be a highly enjoyable beer that I am happy to know is available whenever I crave it again!"
""
""
""
"O: Overall I would drink it again. It's not just a novelty coconut beer. It's actually very good for a porter. Again, I wish there was more body...but the flavor stands out very well. I would drink it again, and I would recommend it."
""
""
""
"Taste: Has a balanced sweet & bitter flavor…a malty start and hoppy finish."
"D - The tale of two beers... The appearance and aroma were excellent... The flavor and mouthfeel were rather pedestrian... The end result is a solid, but unremarkable offering..."
"I'd have one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice deep brown color. Small tan head. Roasted malt and dark chocolate aroma. Sharp and acrid flavor upfront-almost a burnt malt and bakers chocolate flavor. Somewhat metallic though I know that isnt from the can. Grainy tasting. Perhaps a whisper of coconut but not what I was expecting. Ok mouthfeel. A decent enough porter but really lacks what it takes to be very good in my book. Could use more coconut."
"Overall, its an excellent porter, but lacking in coconut flavor (in my opinion). I would buy next time I see it."
"Flavor - Chocolate covered coconut pieces"
"This beer had a large head and was fairly dark. The aroma smelled of a little bit of coffee with more chocolaty undertones. This is a very creamy beer that stays in the mouth for quite a while. You can detect no hops and has a nice malty sweetness. This porter was very enjoyable and I would definitely drink it again."
"O -With this my first beer from Maui Brewing I find this beer very unique. It's very different from my usual Porter that I enjoy drinking. The blending of the flavors makes it difficult for the palate to really bind everything together, which I noticed some other reviewers noticed as well. I would recommend if you enjoy porters to switch gears a bit and put one of these down. Very interesting experience."
"Overall: This is a good beer, and I will get more of it when I travel. The coconut flavors may go right by someone that is not expecting them."
"Overall: This is probably my favorite beer. I've been drinking this a lot. The only downside to this is that it cost usually 10 dollars for a case of 4 cans. Still the taste it good and the chocolate is definately present as you drink it."
"- no hop aroma but had a hoppy finish"
"Cheers!"
"Overall this is a good porter, bold aroma, would have guessed less than 6% abv all considered. Would like to see more coconut character."
"o - decent beer that improves as it warms. i don't think i'm getting much coconut, if at all. if i didn't know this was a coconut porter then i wouldn't have even thought about that."
""
""
""
""
"O: A let down for a sure, I had higher hopes for this one, But its a really nice light porter for a crisp spring evening."
""
""
""
"O: This is a very tasty beer with a well done flavor twist. I kinda wish I had more and huge thanks to podunkparte for throwing this one in as an extra."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall though, I'd say it's a pretty solid beer. It's dominated by the bitter cocoa aroma and flavors but is offset with just a bit of sweetness and smokiness to give it a little depth."
""
""
"o - overall, this is a well made beer and tastes like coconut, just a shame i don't like coconut...fortunately my wife does and she loved the beer."
""
""
""
""
"This is a solid porter. I feasted on this beer while in Oahu and will likely go back to it on my next visit to Hawaii."
"Overall it feels like a very well executed brew, though not one that I would rely on as a staple. It's tasty, but I don't think I could drink a coconut beer consistently. Try it at least once, though, and judge for yourself"
""
"Overall: Definitely good, and the use of coconut is perfect. I'm thinking this doesn't travel all that well as the flavors seem a little out of balance and breadth."
""
""
""
"O- Coconut definitely stood out and worked well with the dark chocolate and coffee flavors. Wish the body was a little more full and robust though."
"O- unique, but not weird. This is a beer that I would gladly try again. Thanks to Kstrickler and StarRaptor for sending some of this to me, thereby allowing me to enjoy it multiple times!"
""
"O: One of the most enjoyable modern craft porters. Great taste, well balanced, and very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"Notes: I really couldn't pick out much of the coconut, all I tasted was that milky sweetness. Did it ferment out, or am I missing it?"
""
""
"O: This definitely feels like a porter and damn does it taste great. On the can its advertised that this won Gold in 2006 as a Herb and Spice Beer and I could see how it did this. I admit I truly can't taste the coconut, but damn does this beer taste great. I am such a sucker for porters and this is obviously another one that I have fallen in love with."
""
""
"O: This is one fine beer. Although the coconut has faded, the base beer is fantastic. I love porters, and this is one of the better ones I've had. Great look and flavor to the beer. I bet when fresh the coconut makes it even better."
""
""
""
"Overall, this was very good. I tend to avoid fruit beers, but this was a pleasant surprise.  Would pick it up occasionally if we actually got it here in MO."
""
""
""
""
"O- A nice porter that is easy to drink. At first I was not sure what to expect from a beer with coconut, and it was nice to see it be so tasty. Very happy I tried this, probably will grab a few more cans soon."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall – While it really wasn't what I was expecting, it's still a delicious and highly drinkable beer. I'd drink it again anytime."

""
""
"Overall - solid beer. I'm happy to have tried it, but won't seek it out."
""
"Somehow less than it could be."
""
"I was curious about this one. I hate coconut. Me hating coconut won out. Trying to put that aside, this beer does do what it intends to although the coconut is fairly one note."
"Overall, this was a darned fine beer. I just wish that there could have been some real coconut flavor or aroma, somewhere."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: *steps up on soapbox* Hear yee hear yee... All yee brewers take notice. When you make a flavored beer, do not make the flavoring the only thing you can taste. You're brewers for crying out loud. If I wanted a porter that tasted like an island themed air freshener, I'd buy a wine cooler. This beer has performed a deed known to be nearly impossible, to hint at a flavoring, and have it compliment the beer without dominated it. Here's looking at you, Hell or High Watermelon. CoCoNut Porter is a great beer because it is first and foremost, a great porter. The coconut in it is just a silver lining that makes me like the taste of the beer more, as all beer flavoring should do."
""
""
""
""
""
"Was able to try a can of CoCoNut Porter from Maui Brewing Co. The color was a opaque dark with tan head that did not lace that well. The smell included roast, coconut, chocolate and light espresso. The taste was more dominated by roast and espresso....slight chocolate and not much coconut. The mouthfeel is a medium body porter that had minimal carbontation. Overall it is amazing!!!!"
""

"Nice American Porter that drinks like a lightish Milk Stout. Recommended"
""
"Thought it was time to review this beer, as it is a personal fav of mine. I'm stoked that it held up as well as it did; it's an excellent beer and am also glad that it is becoming more and more available...was even available for a short time here in Paris!"

"O - This is a very drinkable stout that is very moreish. Coconut is nearly non-existent though."

"Overall this is just an interesting, unique beer. I don't know that I like it that much, but it's certainly not bad by any means either. It is full-flavored, that's for sure. Might have to come back to this one every 6 months or so just to see if I can make any more sense of it."
"Man, really good porter! Let the can warm some out of the fridge then poured a giant, foamy, frothy, fluffy, sudsy tan head that quickly settled to some islands, a ring, and a little lace. Color is almost opaque black brown; in the narrowest part of the glass it was clear. Aroma is malt, roast, cocoa, coffee, and a bit of coconut. Flavor's much like nose with malt, roast, sweet, and carbonic tang on top, other stuff later. Body and carbonation are smack on. Finish is like flavor with certain flavor lasting longer than others, but in a satisfying way. I could have a few more of these."
"O: After the great appearance and nice aroma, I was thinking I was really going to enjoy this beer. Unfortunately, for me, the taste fell short and was overpowered by the earthiness. There are many other porters out there that I would rather have than this one, especially at over $10 for a four pack."
"Overall this is my favorite beer from my trip to the Aloha State. It's not what I expected, it's better."
"O- A delicious porter and glad i get to enjoy it regularly."
"Overall very good beer. I really enjoyed it."
"Cheers!"
"Overall this is a great, unique, dark chocolate porter with a hint of coconut that isn't in your face."
"O: Like this more than I thought I would, since I am not a huge coconut fan, but the flavor is subtle and adds the right amount of flavor."
"A welcome treat for the taste buds, and an experience worth revisiting. Too bad I can't get this in Indiana anytime soon!"
"O: Really happy with this beer. I had this when it first came out and I was not very impressed. My second try has proven to be much more successful. Gonna be a regular in my fridge."
"O - a good tasting porter."
"O- a very good example of the porter style. The coconut is there but gets a bit overwhelmed by the strong roasted malts. As it warms the coconut picks up some. Kind of reminds me of coffee and doughnuts."
"O - a pretty good beer, wish it was a little bit more coconutty."
"Really enjoyed this, aroma was disappointing, but the taste had a nice subtle coconut that worked great with the roast. Carbonation was a little high, but glad i tried this."
"Pours a deep black/brown with a one finger light brown head. Minimal lacing. Aroma of sweet chocolate and molasses along with a good balance of coffee beans and a touch of hops. Really nicely crafted sweet porter. Initial hit of sweet chocolate, not overly sweet, but very nice. Little kick of roasted coffee and hops before a sweet creamy finish. Hints of vanilla, coconut and coconut milk to finish off this tasty brew. Really complex flavor profile."
"o: A great porter! Good chocolate and coffee flavors."
"Cheers"
"O - Every time I try this beer, I taste some other subtle nuance. One of the best porters available."
"I wanted to enjoy a local Maui beer while sitting on the beach and this is definitely one that I highly recommend."
"The first thing i noticed when i poured this beer was the unique light amber color. The beer's aroma is of smoky wood and a light floral taste.the beer has the perfect amount of lace, head and carbonation. It is surprisingly traditional porter in taste, as the coconut is barely detectable. Overall this beer surprised me, it is alot better than I expected. Definitely worth a try if you are a fan of porters."
"O: I like this porter a lot. It is very drinkable. The sweetness is balanced very well. It always stayed at a perfect spot and never overwhelmed me."
"O: A nice take on the style; I wish it had slightly more body but this is quite the refreshing and unique beer"
"Verdict: Probably the best beer from Hawaii, this one is really drinkable, not a pretentious porter by any means and a great beer to enjoy in a glass or right out of the can with friends."
"This beer has the classic body for a porter. I've had better porters, but this one is well worth getting and trying."
"O – Good twist to classic, impressed with how this is every time I enjoy it. Maui has got something in the brews they make."
"D - Very drinkable. Really nice level of sweetness with the traditional American Porter elements. The toasted coconut is really nice."
"O: Very tasty porter, but I find the coconut presence disappointing. I defiantly recommend, but it's kind of expensive. I suppose if I couldn't get black butte, it would be runner up(possibly). Anywhoo... Check it out."
"A solid effort by Maui Brewing."
"O: nice brew, which I got more coconut in it, but nice nonetheless"
"O- I love coconut, and I think this beer incorporated it perfectly. Highly recomended."
"O: A light, clean (bitter-free) tasting porter with a rather light body that's highly drinkable. Nothing unpleasant about this, just not big or bold enough for my taste."
"Overall Impression- A very interesting brew! While I enjoyed over 3/4 of the can AND THEN started eating the Coldstone Ice Cream, this was very well paired and couldn't have enjoyed more! This Porter had only hints of the coconut but still a brew I have been wanting to try for a while. Thanks Brad!"
"Coconut porter is one of the more interesting beers I've heard of before; excited to try this one. Pours deep, deep brown, basically black out of the can. Thick, bubbly, light brown head tops the beer and dissipates quickly. A very smooth and mellow aroma - chocolate, almond, coconut notes. Lightly roasty with some caramel going on as well. The flavor is malty up front, a bit more roasted malt, some caramel sweetness, and some dark chocolate. A deeper, more coffee-like, nutty malt flavor lingers on the tongue after drinking. Huge depth of flavor here, good complexity; a very smooth and mellow, balanced beer."
"Very good porter with a twist. Will buy again."
"Usually the most intoxicating thing about hot island beers is the imagery they offer; this one, however, also offers a ton of flavour and a unique and gratifying overall experience. Like all Maui Brewing brands, it seems bigger than Hawaii itself and fits less into the scopes of tourism or heritage than it does the new-wave American craft beer revolution. Recommended."
"O: A pretty decent porter, but I really wish there was more of a coconut presence. Not a bad beer at all, though."
"O - I am always happy to have this brew and think it's a fine representative of the type."
"Overall - A bit disappointed with this one... it's a pretty run of the mill porter with just the faintest trace of coconut..."
"O: I'm not sure where the coconut is, but this is a great chocolate porter!"
"Overall: Nice. Mild but well balanced, with a good amount of malty flavor. If many of the beers I drink and praise are meals, this beer is definitely a snack, but it's a crave-able enough snack. In the right situation it would be easy (and enjoyable) to put down quite a few of these."
"2.5, 4.5, 4, 4, 4"
"O: Very happy I came across this. 4 pack for $10, 2 left to go :)"
"Well worth trying."
"Pours an amber and brown streaked black with a fingers worth of dark tan head. A sticky tan lacing streaks down the length of the glass. The nose is dominated by rich chocolate malts, with some roasted notes as well as some vanilla and faint coconut. The coconut comes through much more in the flavor, though it still plays second fiddle to the chocolate. The coconut flavor mixed with the chocolate instantly reminded me of an Almond Joy candy bar, more smooth and rich than citrus flavored like you'd expect from a pina colada or sweeter drink. Coffee and toasted nut notes hang around as well. A really good amount of flavor without anything becoming overwhelming. It has a smooth, creamy mouthfeel and medium body with a sweet, lingering finish. A very enjoyable beer that I hope I cross paths with again!"
"M/O: Great mouthfeel. This is a fantastic porter that adds a great coconut flavor. It's great because its a new twist on a classic beer I like."
"Overall a good porter, it's relatively fresh, canned 6-27, and is an enjoyable beer. The problem is that the only effect from coconut I notice is the absence of head and lacing. A little disappointed."
"o- an enjoyable porter, not super heavy or super high ABV, only 6.0%. i enjoy the coconut a lot its a good compliment to the style. well balanced and very drinkable."
"Dark brown in color with slight tan head. Good carbonation. Smells of dark chocolate and roasted barley. The labeling description on this is on the money with ""toasted coconut"". At first sip you know can taste the dance between chocolate, toasted coconuts, dark coffee and roasted malts. The porter genetics appear to win the struggle over the coconut flavors, though. Would love to see the porter flavors toned down just a bit, but great nonetheless. Medium in the mouth. Worth seeking and trying."
"O - Overall I'm a little disappointing in the brew. I liked the flavor profile but it was a bit wish washed together. I also didn't like the feel of the beer, way too carbonated! I could have another but I wouldn't ever buy it again. Worth a try though."
"A unique brew but it needs to be taken down a notch in almost every way except the addition of coconut. The alcohol is also too noticeable for 6%."
"Finally reviewing this after having (too) many in Hawaii months ago, Nice black body with a fluffy, sand coloured head. Creamy, chocolate and light coconut scent. Sweet chocolate, coconut and a decent hoppy bitterness in the taste. Very smooth, creamy -almost oily- mouthfeel. Great, rich and tasty beer. Well worth seeking out. My can says 6.0%, not 5.7%."
"Well, this is supposed to be a porter that you can pound on the beach, and in that respect it works. It just isn't the creamy-coconut goodness I was expecting."
"Overall this is a decent stout that I'm glad I had the opportunity to try and would drink again, but not actively seek out."
"A very delicious Porter and one I rather enjoy. Really nice balance to it. And while I do recall getting more Coconut flavor in past tastings perhaps this was an older can and I suppose some of those oils/flavors would in fact fade overtime."
"O - I am usually underwhelmed by porters, but this is quite tasty and has a lot of great things working in its favor."
"This pours typical to most porters and stouts. A nice dark brown/black body topped with a substantial 3 finger foam head that was all talk. It disappeared in seconds. The nose is nearly non-existent. I sniffed this glass for 30 seconds trying to find something, and I couldn't. I moved on to pinpointing the taste aspects, and eventually got some hints of earthy alcohol, but that was about it. The taste is absent of any coconut whatseover. I don't know where that comes from, but I couldn't find it. That being said, there's a nice taste of cocoa, small vanilla notes, and some nuttiness. This is a heavily carbonated beer and ever sip coats your tongues in bubbles and bitterness. This is decent, but falls short of what I was expecting."
"Overall good."
"Overall, this is a really good beer. I don't really get/smell/taste the coconut, but it is stil a great porter."
"O- Good beer, but still waiting on my coconut bomb. I would buy the shit outta this if available all the time. A little more coconut, chocolate, and lactose and this could be an easy A+..."
"Overall – I really enjoy this beer. I will say this does taste a bit different from in past, however, it is still a solid porter."
"Poured from a can into a pint glass. Pours really dark with mocha foam. No lacin,g. On the glass. Smells of coffee and chocolate. Tastes sweeter than most porters with the faint hint of coconut. Different, but very good. First time I have had a coconut porter, would enjoy comparing to another."
"O - Awesome brew, with 9 months on it, it only gets better!"
"O: This was a solid porter overall, but the taste was lacking pretty muted. Even after I let the brew warm a bit there still wasn't much there."
"MO- Creamy feel. Worth trying if you get to the islands. Although this was my favorite brewery in Hawaii not my my favorite beer."
"Overall a really good porter. The can didn't seem to affect anything, I just wish it has more coconut."
"Overall: This is a fantastically balanced porter that should be tried to be believed! No idea how people in the always gorgeous climate of Hawaii could find the opportunity to drink something this warming, but as its the only state that grows coffee, I wouldn't be surprised if this is used often for breakfast."
"Overall, it's a good beer. Not my fav but I think it will do the job. I'll definitely have to try it again. This time I'll let it sit for a few minutes if I happen to yank it violently from it's vice grip holder."
"A decent porter, though I was hardly able to pick up any coconut which unfortunately makes this pretty overage overall."
"What a great porter, feels and smells so good."
"Pours black with a small tan head. Smells super roasty and chocolatey with the faintest coconut smell. Tastes the same. The sweet chocolate and coconut flavor are not quite cloying. Nicely carbonayed. Tastes like a coconut foodie roll. Moderate thickness that's slick and smooth."
"Had that definite porter feel with the lighter body and higher carbonation, but it was almost too light at times. Watery mouthfeel. Not a repeat UNLESS I got it fresh (maybe even through a Randall with toasted coconut). That would probably be delicious. I love coconut, but this beer just didn't do it for me as much as I expected it would. It reminded me of Cigar City Maduro Brown, but more roasty and less quality."
"Pours with a nice brown tight head that doesn’t stick around for to long, in the aroma is roasted chocolate, hazelnut, coffee, and a slight coconut sweetness that to me comes off as more of an almond smell. Nice initial bitterness on the tongue followed by chocolate and hazelnut flavors. The malt sort of falls apart in the middle and the beer finishes light, making it a nice porter for a hot day, but I was hoping for a bigger mouth feel."
"O- a really unique and tasty porter, I can never get enough coconut though."
"O: A very solid and flavorful American porter with a powerful roasted malt presence balanced nicely with some coconut sweetness and hop bitterness. Nothing complicated here, but this is top-notch quality. I would say that it's a bit astringent for my palate, and obviously a bit heavy for this time of year, but I will pick this up again without hesitation when the colder months roll around and give this one another go. Cheers!"
"The appearance is very good, its a dark almost blackish color with a large creamy mocha head. The smell is mostly roasted malts, some coffee, a little caramel, a hint of a sweet fruit, probably the coconut, maybe even smoked coconut(??). The feel is medium still plenty of carbonation. The taste is of roasted malts, coffee, a little dark chocolate, some smokiness and a hint of sweetness perhaps from the coconut. There is some hoppy and roasted malt bitterness at the end. Overall this a pretty great porter (even if it was far different than expected) and this is one I'll be sure to get again. Good stuff."
"Overall: This beer, is really a nice surprise. The mixture of the hops, and malt meld very very well with the flavors of the roasted coconut. I expected a mediocre beer with this one, but was very surprised to taste something quite impressive and familiar with just little bit of a twist that coconut adds."
"Conclusion: This is a tasty porter, and reminds me a bit of Breckenridge Vanilla Porter, except this is flavor with coconut. Honestly I could go for more coconut flavors, but this is still pretty tasty!"
"Overall, this is a great beer. Very well crafted, a great porter with or without the coconut."
"O: a good beer, that will be in the regular lineup."
"I don't know if I'd ever peg this for a coconut beer, but it is very pleasant. Simple and drinkable."
"Overall: really un-impressed, I had heard a lot of hype about this beer but when push came to shove I was incredibly underwhelmed, honestly the only reason I would pick this up again is for the convenience of canned porter."
"Good all across the board. Doesn't really stand out in any way, but it's very solid. One of the better porters I've had, but a step below the top ones in complexity, and lacking that special something."
"O: This is undeniably a tasty, coconut porter. That being said, there's a reasonably long road to perfection for this. More complexity, work on the aftertaste, a creamier body, and I think you'd have an amazing coconut porter here. As it is though, while still preferable to the majority of porters I've tried and probably the best coconut taste of any year-round beer I've had, it's just a better-than-average porter with occassionally exceptional good flavor."
"I dig this interesting twist. Dark cocoa color, a whiff of unsweetened chocolate in the aroma. First sip creates a distinct impression of . . . I'm not kidding . . Tootsie Roll. Mild milk chocolate, light brown sugar. It wasn't until half-way through the beer, and after it warmed a bit, that I was able to parse-out the coconut. At that point, my impression was a bit of Mounds candy bar. Bottom line - candy counter in a can."
"Overall - The taste is nowhere near as exciting as the aroma, but it does taste pretty good. Glad I had it."
"O – Coconut is present while not overbearing, an interesting and good porter that I am glad I tried. Not a beer I would ever buy again at the Denver $10/4 pack cans price. 3.5"
"Overall I was really happy with this. Another brewery that is trying some off the wall things. Well commended!!! I truly enjoyed this and suggest you seek this out and tell the BA community what you think."
"O: I really like this beer, but I don't think it's anything really special. I'm glad to have tried it and would like to try it again in the future, but I'm not in a rush to seek it out."
"I've had this beer more than once and thoroughly enjoy it every time I have it."
"O: I enjoyed this more than I thought I would, due to my aforementioned thoughts on coconut. This is as refreshing and Hawaiian as any porter could hope to be. I'm very glad I got to try this beer, since it gets mentioned all the time. Definitely worth a stab."
"O - This is a pretty good beer generally I'm not into coconut but I liked what it added to the taste this one is worth picking up sometime if you see it around"
"overall an outstanding beer i would love to try again"
"Narrative: Day 157, the sand seems to have retreated to a more south eastern sedimentation, signaling the coming of the vernal equinox. I never thought that I would spend almost a half year on this god forsaken island but here I am, carving my exploits into another coconut tree using coconut shards to commemorate this day. Milk in milk out. It seems coconuts are the only vexing produce available and I long for variety. A crate washed up on shore and I prayed for provisions or a flare gun, lamentably, only a driftwood case of Coppertone presented itself. The smell was too much to bear. I fear that I am going mad sustaining only on a diet of coconuts. There is a pun available somewhere but my rancid coconut breath can hardly utter such trifles. I long to hold my beloved and drink a pina colada with her as soon as I escape; someday."
"O-definitely tasty but i don't find any uniqueness to it. i was hoping to find more coconut in this. this is just average."
"I guess I'm in the minority on this one, but this certainly did not come off as an excellent brew by any means. Thankfully it's one of those beers that gets better as it warms, so be patient. The scent and taste certainly did improve as it sat in my pint glass."
"Cheers..."
"O: This is a really delicious beer. I'm really glad I was able to try it and I'll be looking for more of this as well as the Imperial. Both really wonderful brews."
"O- not what I expected, but I'm pleasantly surprised. The fact that it's in a can gives it even more bonus points"
"O: I was a bit let down by this one considering the fact that I know people who swear by this brew. However, I'd love to try it on tap sometime."
"O: If this were available in my state, I'd drink on it with decent regularity. Since it isn't, I look forward to my next opportunity to drink it again."
"O- A very well crafted brew overall! Slightly sweet, almost Guinness like, but more tropical. This is an excellent all weather dark beer, and would be great with a steak dinner or even as a desert brew. As it warms, the robustness gets even deeper and the buttery texture gets even smoother. When I go to Maui in a few months, this could very well be a go to brew for me!"
"Big thanks to Matty D. Martin for the share. Out of a 4-pack, two seemed borderline infected, and two are pretty good. This review is for a good can. The brew pours a coffee-brown hue, visibly thinner, and is capped with a tan froth that recedes quickly. The nose offers some roastiness and some small coffee hints. I don't get coconut aromatically. The flavor actually reveals a bit coconut, just a hint. It is not very sweet, more of a straight-up porter, offering notes of roast, coffee grounds, and herbal hoppiness. As it airs out, the coconut is more pronounced. The feel is relatively thin. Overall, pretty nice, but not outstanding; I wish this beer was good as it theoretically sounds."
"Overall, I was fairly surprised by this given some of the other Maui brews and a large amount competition from other American porters."
"Well balanced, pretty good but not amazing."
"Drinkability is excellent. The coconut is calibrated to perfection and does not obscure the base porter characteristics at all, which are anyway very solid. Really dig this."
"This beer is quite a dark brown with a large off white head which quickly recedes to a thin foam on top. Not much lacing to speak of. The aroma is roasty with a touch of coconut and chocolate. Taste is similar, and is quite light with a bit of sweetness and a bit more coconut than the aroma. Very nice. Mouthfeel is smooth and nice, but is a bit short on carbonation. Overall this beer is nice and enjoyable."
"Future outlook: Really exceeded expectations....too bad it was nabbed in California, and is not available here."
"Appearance is a dark brown color with a nice mocha head. Just as the name would lead you to believe, this one has a pleasant aroma. There is coconut, roasted malts, some coffee. Upon sipping this interesting beer, I taste some dark coffee, roasted malts and yes, some coconut, but nothing overpowering or too aggressive. MF leans towards full bodied, with a velvet texture. This one was fun to try, would be nice if some of this made it out closer to Connecticut."
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, good variation of style, this is a good beer to drink for a long time if you’re looking for something a bit different within the style."
"O: enjoyable porter that goes down easy. really makes me want to get back to the islands!"
"O: A decent porter. Like the toasty flavor. Didn't get the coconut flavor I was hoping for. If there would have been a bigger coconut presence, and the smell was bette, this would've been an A beer."
"O- What we have here is the perfect dark beer for a hot day. The fact that it comes in cans makes it the perfect beer to bring anywhere. The ABV isn't that high so you can pound a few of these and still have a good time."
"CHEERS!!"
"This beer was excellent. I recieved this beer in a trade with MrHirschybar and really wish I was able to get it in my area. Highly recommend!!!"
"Purchased at Gabriel's superstore #60 in San Antonio, TX."
"Surely one of the finest things to come out of Hawaii."
"mouthfeel is pretty good, a bit less carbonation would bump it to a 4.5 from me."
"Overall. A very tasty porter. Nice flavours with nothing overbearing or offensive. Easy drinker."
"Poured into a bruery tulip. Black with a thin tan head that quickly dissipates into a ring around my glass. Aroma of smokey malts coffee and some vanilla notes. Taste is more subdued than the nose, the smoke is there, very light coconut notes and finishes with coffee. Mouthfeel is smooth but maybe a little over carbonated. Pretty good, I was hoping for more coconut but it's not a bad all around porter"
"overall = good stuff"
"O – A very nice brew. Shade boozy. Great chocolate flavor."
"This can was given to me unsolicited by robwestcott. Thank you to Rob for the advocacy! This beer pours a Coca Cola like dark, dark brown with a thick and frothy beige colored head. The aromas consist of vanilla, chocolate, lightly roasted malts, and a milk stout like sweetness. It smells like no other porter I've had. The flavors are of sweet and bitter chocolate, vanilla, slight coffee, and again a milk stout like sweetness. It has really good flavor the flavors are perfectly proportionate. It is a little light in body but I've noticed that porters and stouts are generally lighter from a can. I really like this beer and am glad to have it again. I recommend giving it a try if you're able."
"Really nice, refreshing porter. A must try."
"O - This one definately gets better as it warms. So many of the flavors are masked when it's cold. Let this one warn up a little to fully enjoy it."
"Notes: This beer is a bit light for the style, but still tasty as all Hell. Unique, flavorful, and from Hawaii... What more could one ask for? Drinkable to the max. CoCoNut is a very solid brew, and one I hope to seek out in the future."
"Atmosphere is good. Dark intimidating appearance, and a nice frothy head (especially for a can). Nose is not complex, but heavily toasted malt, coffee, and dark chocolate. Tastes a lot like it smells. Toasted malt, coffee, the bittersweet taste of unsweetened chocolate, and just a subtle hint of buttery sweetness. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"Overall, excellent brew with a nice coconut presence that isnt too much but instead adds to what seems an already great porter."
"Overall, this is a good beer, but probably not something I'll buy another 4 pack of."
"Overall - Definitely one of the best porters I have had in a while. The sweetness of the coconut compliments the roasted malts very well, but it's not overpowering. Everything blends really well. Too bad I don't have better access to this. Loved it."
"This beer is fantastic. Even if you don’t like porter, give it a chance. You won’t be sorry. And don’t let the coconut part throw you off. I despise coconut, and love this beer. Well done boys… bottoms up!"
"O: Overall I was expecting a coconut flavored syrup mess, Instead I was surprised that this porter actually tastes like a porter ,It does have enough coconut to observe the flavor however it's by no means overwellming and it only compliments a well blended and balanced poter - Very well done."
"Mouthfeel: Velvety texture and a bit long on the tongue."
"Overall this is a good brew but not great."
"O - pretty solid, would love to find some more of this sometime."
"O: Good porter, the coconut doesn't really wow me though. Worth trying at least once."
"Overall: Very solid beer. I would not go out of my way for it but if it were available around me I would certainly pick it up every once in a while. Great extra!"
"Overall, a really great porter even if the signature coconut was MIA. Highly recommend if you can get it. This just entered the Texas market and am excited to try the other Maui offerings. Rotation - this would be a great beer on a nice cool fall or winter day. Probably not so much in the Texas heat though. [O;Y]"
"Finish: Long and robust, but not explosive. It goes down like a good iced coffee and it also leaves a trail of kind sweetness. This beer delivers complexity and excellent beer craftsmanship. Cheers! Maui Brewing Co"
"Overall, this beer is pretty decent. The coconut in the title is certainly misleading, but beers shouldn't be rated in relationship to their name. This is a drinkable porter, and one I would definitely have again if ever given the opportunity."
"O: Glad to have tried this beer, but to me it’s more of a novelty item for the addition of the coconut than anything substantial and masterful. It kind of reminds me of a Short’s beer."
"O- This is good, but somewhat pedestrian. I was hoping for something that knocks my socks off and this isn't it it. But still good."
"After having had this several times, I think the freshness really does matter for how much coconut you perceive. It's still noticeable at 3 months, but much more present at one month."
"O- I would drink it again if offered to me but for the price ($9.99/4pack) I would pass in the store. Good porter just nothing special."
"The coconut gets pushed aside flavor-wise, as heftier notes of dark roasted malt grains, coffee, and chocolate coat the tongue. A hint of sweetness lingers in the finish with more roast and some earthy hops. The mouthfeel walks the line between a thick, stout-like porter and that of the more traditional English counterparts. Not a bad beer by any means, but a tad gimmicky when all is said and done. Many better porters are out there to choose from..."
"O: Maui Brewing's CoCoNut Porter was a nice way to start the night. It wasn't quite what I had expected and a bit of a letdown from the coconut department. I'd certainly drink it again if offered, though wouldn't put a lot of effort into search it out."
"O: Overall, this is probably my favorite session beer. The flavoring is strong, regardless of the light feeling. I make sure there is always at least 2-3 in my fridge at any given time!"
"Many thanks to deadeye for throwing this extra in, which has been on my wants for what seems like forever. The color is pretty dark here, just a shade away from being pitch black. Lots of tanned heading shows up as well. More roasted notes than I would have expected here, with some bitter dark chocolate, and just a tiny hint of the coconut. Ahh there is the coconut, but it is still fairly subdued in a good way. Lots of coffee comes through too. Mouthfeel is about medium, with great drinkability. I swear that one day I will sip this beer on a beach in Hawaii."
"O: really good, I went into this half expecting your standard overly flavored additive beer, but the coconut was pleasantly restrained and the beer itself top quality."
"O - This is your beer if you want a solid, flavor encompassing porter. If you're buying it purely for the coconut addition, I would caution you. If the mouthfeel was a little beefier, I could see this being something I'd need in my fridge constantly."
"Thanks chugalug06 for a 4pack in an oustanding trade!"
"O - Overall this beer is just ok. Its a bit of a let down to be honest. For one I was hoping for more coconut profile considering its in the actual title of the beer and depicted on the label. At 9.99 a four pack I probably would not buy this again. A good beer. Just not as advertised in my opinion. I shouldn't have to dig for coconut flavor and smell."
"A big shout out to woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of roasted malts and coconut. Taste is good, big and malty up front, settles in with some chocolate and coconut. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a high quality beer."
"O: This is no Opa-Opa Coconut porter, but its still a very solid representation on the coconut porter sub-style. Coconut is very muted in this one which is a little disappointing but the mouthfeel is very nice and its solid in ever respect. Worth trying."
"O - Will gladly drink this beer again. I am kind of glad it wasn't as coconut-y as I imagined it would be."
"Well Done."
"An excellent porter."
"Cocoa powder with roasty and nutty malt are the main flavor components with coconut and hop presence both bringing up the rear. The coconut is slick and oily almost, with very little sweetness coming forth. I almost think it could benefit from a little more sweetness and body. It is a pretty enjoyable beverage though, and I am glad MBC has decided to come to Texas, I will surely buy a couple four-packs of this each year."
"Enjoyable beer for the most part. Very approachable and would work well as a dessert beer. The sweetness is just a bit much for me, one can would be enough and then it is time to move on."
"O: This is a very nice porter to kick back and enjoy."
"I still like this, but it is not the beer I remember. I don't know if my tastes have changed or what? It is still enjoyable, and worth a try however."
"I waited to serve this beer until it was almost room temperature, but I didn't get much coconut, some in the late portions of the palate but I can't say for sure that if I didn't know that there was coconut in there that I would have guessed so. The beer is a little thin and mildly sweet with some decent bitterness from the roast in the back. Overall it is a decent porter and I'd have it again. I wish the coconut were more obvious."
"single can from the Liquor Mart in Boulder"
"It's a nice, creamy, roasty, beer but not one of the better porters I've had. Also, I noticed a metallic taste that really took away from the up-front flavors."
"Thanks very much to JMBSH for this via a recent trade."
"O: Outstanding brew and it's in a can. Love it."
"O - Really nice porter that I am glad I can finally check off my list. Aroma is fantastic and the rest is decent too."
"The complexity of this actually really surprised me. Not as in your face coconutty as I had hoped for, but a really well integrated flavor to work with the overall beer. This is a one of a kind beer that I really enjoyed."
"-Gfunk"
"Black porter look. The coconut aroma is subtle and pleasant. A creamy maltiness with gradually accumulating coconut flavor. yes, sort of an oddity or gimmick, but coconut flavor meshes well with roasted porter maltiness and this brew is a nice experience."
"d- would not know it was a can blind tasted. best can ive tasted to date."
"O - I'm glad I got to try this beer, as I heard a lot of good things about it. While it wasn't near my favorite porter, it had some good things going for it. The aftertaste left me pretty upset though, and I just can't see searching it out again."
"Overall this is better than expected. I had heard bad rumors about smell and taste like sunscreen but it's totally well done."
"Drinkable by the gallons. Yum! This is one fun tasting little porter. Serve this in a cracked open coconut and Oh My! That would be awesome me thinks."
"Overall, this is absolutely worth a try. I really enjoy trying new and creative brews. CoCoNut Porter is well done, unique, and enjoyable."
"O=I wish the coconut had been a bit more emphasized, but this is definitely one of the better porters I have had"
"Overall: Damn fine porter! It's so nice to see great beers available in cans!"
"Overall: It seems the whole is greater than the sum of its parts for this beer. It can be enjoyed on its own, or with some food. Immediate thoughts are with coconut shrimp, as this has the carbonation level that could cut grease a bit, although it would be interesting; or with a chocolate coconut torte. Further experimentation required and anticipated. Recommended!"
"Overall its a good beer, worth a try, not the best thing ever."
"O: A good enjoyable porter that I won't quite put among the ranks of Edmund Fitzgerald or Black Butte, but it sure beats the hell out of Yuengling's version. 4/5"
"O- Not too bad at all. It's no Duck Rabbit (or whatever the hell they call it) Baltic Porter or Cigar City Jose Marti Porter but it definitely is worth a try."
"D: I've had this before and the beer was much better, too bad I'm reviewing based on this one. Will revisit later and edit."
"12 oz can. Pours a black that a reddish cola brown when it is held up to the light. A small tan white head with decent retention that leaves a small amount of lacing on the glass. Aroma is coffee, light vanilla, coconut, a bit of dark chocolate, and a bit of floral hops. More coconut and alcohol comes through as it warms up. Almost smells bourbon barrel aged. Initial taste is sweet vanilla, going into a bit of coffee. Strong coconut on the finish as well as a decent bitterness. Light bodied. Very smooth. Medium-low carbonation. Enjoyable beer. A little on the sweet side for me."
"Thanks to funkyaudio for the extra. Poured from can (no date stamp) into a tulip glass. Pours blackish brown with a thick tan head to start out, then it disappears almost immediately leaving a collar of tan foam around the rim, lacework is minimal. The aroma is good, the strongest smell is the coffee with a strong chocolate aroma as well, there maybe some coconut, but not much which was disappointing as I expected more of it. The flavor is the same as the aroma, it tastes like chocolate milk with a little bitterness, the carbonation could have been higher as well."
"Pours black with a tan head that fades fast. Looks good. Smells of chocolate, a hint of coffee and coconut. Smells really good. Taste is like the nose - creamy, milky chocolate, a bit of coffee and a hint of coconut. Very enjoyable and pretty big flavors for the style. Nice, creamy mouthfeel. Silky and smooth. Very drinkable. Yum."
"D: Have you ever tasted an Almond Joy? That's what this beer tastes like a liquid almond joy. I wish it was a bit stronger but otherwise it is quite delicious. Treat yourself to some! Drink up!"
"I feel very lucky to have been able to try this delicious Hawaii brewed beer here in the corn fields of middle America. Thanks Camp!"
"The CPJ"
"Pours a pitch black with a 1 inch tan head that fades to nothing. Pretty good ring lacing on the drink down. Smells of roasted dark malts, roasted coffee beans, and toasted coconut. There is a whiff of metal too which I assume is from the can. Taste is of rich fresh brewed coffee, slight bittersweet chocolate, dark malty richness. Golden toasty coconut taste is present at the finish and aftertaste of each sip. Beer has great carbonation levels. Body is a bit thin for a porter but nothing to complain about. Superb drinkability on this beer. One of the staples in my fridge as the wife cannot get enough of this one."
"Drinkability: The name is somewhat misleading, but a porter I will drink again. The fact that it comes in a can is a plus too, at least for those looking to take it to an outdoor venue where glass is not allowed or advised."
"Very drinkable, its something I would pass on to a friend or even an enemy and make them a friend."
"Overall this is a tasty beverage. In fact I'm thoroughly enjoying it. I would definitely like to have a few more of these. A six pack in a night would be no problem."
"T: Coffee and roasted malt with some bittersweet chocolate thrown in. I was expecting this one to taste sort of like a Mounds bar, but not so much. As it warms, there's a slight hint of coconut and milk chocolate, but the sweetness stays at a minimum. The mouthfeel was super thin."
"A nice porter from Maui brewing. And it comes in a can! Great stuff, glad we have it in Colorado. Nice dark pour. Nose has roasty malts, chocolate, coconut, coffee, vanilla and more dark malts. Great session beer. The coconut really goes well with the porter."
"Glad I brought back a few 4-packs with me in my carry-on."
"Fully met my expectations of a tasty porter supplemented deftly by experienced brewers to create a whole new beer. Absolutely a great beer."
"3.5 D: This one doesn't really wow me, but it has a good enough taste to be worth the drink."
"Drinkability is good. A pretty decent porter all around. It's nice to see the coconut come through a bit in the taste and makes the porter stand out a little bit. Probably not something I would seek out, but I wouldn't mind sipping on a few of these while lounging on a Hawaiian beach."
"Overall an interesting offering. I can see how I would enjoy this can stretched out on the beaches of Maui or on tap in their charming brewpub."
"Taste: The first impression is of coconut. It is strangely followed by banana and perhaps a bit of clove. To me this porter comes close to tasting like a banana beer or maybe even a hefeweizen. After a bit the coconut comes back this time more pleasant and tastes more like real coconut. The mouth feel is medium bodied. It is not an extremely complex beer but the coconut makes for an interesting experience. This is a fun beer to drink. I wouldn't mind drinking this out of the can."
"D - Very high. Damn I really wish I had a few more of these. I really enjoyed this one. The flavors mixed very well together. One of the best dark beers I have had from a can to date."
"Hats off to Patrick. Thanks man. Nice beer!"
"Drinkability is high...the slight coconut taste kept me going back for another sip to enjoy that moment of sweetness that differentiates this porter from a regular one. Given the moderately low ABV, I can see it being relatively easy to down a few of these in one sitting."
"Poured from a can into a pint glass, the beer is a nice, dark black, which is slightly translucent, and has highlights of amber-brown when held up to the light. The beer starts out with a thick, fluffy pillow of tan head that settles and disappears as the beer has time to sit. It has strong aromas of chocolate and sweet malt, with some very slight hints of vanilla, too. On tasting, the beer has initial flavors of coffee and chocolate riding a light, sharp carbonated body. The coconut is very light and complementary in flavors, and once again vanilla slips itself into the picture. The coffee flavor does well to provide some bitterness to balance all of the sweet flavors. The body also does well to balance, as it is fairly light bodied for a porter, which helps to keep the beer overpowering. Despite the taste and flavors, the beer has a slightly bitter aftertaste, with both chocolate and coffee lingering around in your mouth. The beer is smooth, and very easy to drink. Good porter for when it's not cold out but you still want to drink a porter."
"My plan is to enjoy my next 4-pk while in Hawaii -- I think it will taste much better then :)"
"Very tasty, drinkable and flavorful. Nice to finally see Maui distributing to Colorado."
"Super super dark appearance here, head looks like milk chocolate. Body is pitch black. Head is a nice two fingers, leaves good lacing. You definitely smell coconut in the smell, along with maybe some chocolate hints. Hmmm, front end of this beer is suuuper smooth, you get the coconut and a velvety taste. The back end however has a few funky tastes to it, not horrible, just a little weird. Overall a pretty dang good porter, somewhat complex, but not too confusing."
"Can. Enjoyed this one compliments of an awesome Cali trader. Pours a deep brown color with a light tan head. Aroma is of dark sweet malts and coconut. Taste is as expected coconutty. Mouthfeel is lighter than I would have expected and wanted. Overall, a decent beer but Minneapolis Town Hall 3 Hour Tour Coconut Porter blows this away in terms of over the top coconut flavors."
"D: Great drinkability. I love coconut and porters so its a win win in my book."
"D - If I had access to this all the time then it would be a regular drink for me. Will look to buy some when I go to the West coast."
"D - It's a different porter. Definitely not bad-different but definitely not largely drinkable either. I couldn't imagine sitting on a Hawaii shore with this one though. It would require a cooler night around a bonfire perhaps."
"Overall, showed promise, but the flavors were very disjoint and it was thin and watery."
"No real coconut flavors which surprised me quite a bit, maybe its a older can? Malty sweetness, some bitter chocolate, caramel and honey and berry notes as it gets warmer. Very creamy with a good mouthfeel that is slick and easily drinkable. I am not a fan on coconut but this turned out to be very good then again the flavors were faint."
"Drinkability. If I was on the beach in Hawaii and craving a porter, I could put a few these down. Light and drinkable, a little lacking on taste, especially coconut smell and taste. I do appreciate it making the trip from Hawaii though."
"I wish Maui's availability would reach Illinois on a permanent basis. I've now had but two of these brews and just wish I could keep a steady stock. Cheers to you Maui Brewing on a job well done!"
"*scribbles note adding it to the places to travel list*"
"D) A worthy brew - I'd be curious to know if the carbonation is like this on all cans or just mine. Head retention could be a bit better."
"Medium in body with a moderate amount of carbonation. This brew has seemingly no indications of alcohol and all together was put together quite well. It was just enough coconut to make it a little different and enjoyable. The toasted quality was welcomed but I didnt like the seemingly mineral feel that was throughout the middle of the profile. Other than that, it was well done and it is worth giving a try."
"D- I can still down the 4 pack in one sitting no problem! Great beer to sit back with and just sip and relax..."
"D - Had no problem with this one, but without the coconut it's just a regular porter, which I can get anywhere. Too bad, I've been excited about this one for a while."
"D: very nice rich tasty porter that was drinking good and was better than the first time I had it."
"This was a fun brew. The coconut adds a nice touch with a smoothing effect."
"From a person who usually doesn't drink a whole lot of Porters, this beer is fantastic! Poured a dark chocolate brown with a foamy tan head with great lacing. The nose is packed full of sweet chocolate, coconut, banana and coffee. The palate was silky smooth with all the flavors working together in balance. Overall this is definetley a great beer!"
"D: Might be too sweet to have multiple in one sitting, but the one I had was fully enjoyed and the chocolate/coconut sweetness never became overwhelming. May work well as a dessert beer, but in my case it was great just on its own."
"Pours dark with reddish hints... A bit of smooth white head... The head dissipates quickly but a lot hangs around the edges. Smells like roasted coffee with a bit of coconut :) smells great! Drinks very cleanly with lots of roasted malts the coconut comes through nicely. Very drinkable and a top notch beer !"
"D: Super smooth beer, great taste and mouthfeel. A solid beer."
"Comments: Expected it to be a little more sweet. Pleasantly surprised it wasn't as I don't have a sweet tooth. That having been said, I would have liked some coconut. Does it fade? Was mine not fresh?"
"Drinkability is high for a porter. Good balance, a little complex."
"The coconut flavor is more restrained on the taste buds than it was on the nose. That's a welcome development as I was worried the beer might have an overwhelming extract quality to it. Instead, the flavor is quite natural. There's some Brown sugar sweetness which is balanced nicely by a bit of roast. I wouldn't mind a bit more boldness on the roast and more complexity in the sweetness, but overall this is a very good porter that deserves a try."
"This is a very tastey porter and I am glad I got two of them. I really like what the coconut brings to this beer. I thought the coconut would be too strong but it is perfect. The porter base is also very good and chocolatey. Pretty bold beer at 5.7%ABV."
"Full, rounded drink that's not over-powering. Pleasant and easy to drink while still being hearty."
"Its a shame it comes in a 4pk, 4 just isn't enough. Drink it all day long. Coconut Porter is proof that flavored beer doesn't have to be a bad thing. This beer tastes like coconut, there is no mistaking it. But its all in balance. It still tastes like real beer, not a gimmick. Shocked by how well they pulled this thing off. Well done."
"A very enjoyable beer though, distinct tropical spin on the porter style."
"Conclusion- Very appealing appearance for like 30 seconds and that is the best part of this beer. After a few minutes, there is a non-existent head that will not return (even with glass swirling) .This beer closely resembled a flat soda pop, and tasted like one too. I liked this beer less with each drink. Drinkability very low, unless you like drinking mouthwash."
"D: A very well-considered and well executed little beer. For $10 a 4-pack, you'll find far better though ...."
"D - Very enjoyable beer. I wish the coconut would have been more forward in the flavor. I don't know if the coconut comes through more when the beer is fresher. Good, but not great."
"D- This is one of the best flavored and easy drinking porters around. I am normally not a fan of coconut but this beer is very balanced that the coconut doesn't become overwhelming."
"Overall, a fantastic beer, and a wonderful drinking experience. Such lovely flavours, so well integrated. Just delicious."
"D: Goes down very easy, extremely tasty, not too filling, mild kick, very nice representation of style. This would hands down be my new go to beer if it were more readily available. If only I had more of it!!!"
"Notes: Glad to try this, thanks Miles! It's really good, but no Edmund Fitzgerald"
"D: You can easily drink several of these in one sitting -- the smoothness really helps."
"Still, I'll happily come back to this since it's the only regularly produced coconut porter I can get."
"Overall a decent porter, mildly sweet with a lot of chocolate overtones. Worth a try."
"Overall this would make a decent dark session beer, creamy and easy to drink, but the coconut aspect is pretty mild."
"Drinkability was good. This was a pretty sessionable porter but at 10 dollars for a 4 pack, not the most bang for your buck. Coffee and chocolate flavors were way more pronounced than the coconut which was disappointing. Would have liked a ton of more coconut flavor and probably wouldnt buy this one again just based on price"
"My second from this brewery, and love them both. Good stuff for sure."
"Drinkability: Overall, a great drinking, tasty porter. I'm really glad I finally got a chance to try this. Absolutely recommend. Thanks again, Kevin!"
"355ml can from ""Lifesource"" Salem. $2.55 Typical American porter in appearance, deepest dark mahogany with a great frothy tan head..almost looks like a root beer float. Lovelly aromas..nice malty roasty with a gorgeous toasted coconut. Wonderful pick me up at this time of year. Flavour is much the same as the aroma..except maybe a tad less coconut, but very pleasurable. The palate kinda lets it down. Its a bit on the thin side, but that does lend to improved drinkability. Overall really nice beer. great from the can."
"Overall an enjoyable beer and one I think I'll keep on my Wants to get more of!"
"Drinkability is solid, bit sweet to have too many, but definitely drinkable."
"All in all, this is a good brew. Not great, but very good. Good to try once if you like porters."
"Overall impression: Unique beer that's worth seeking out."
"D: Pretty good."
"D - amazing drinkability - have lived in maui for a few years before coming back to NY and I can tell you I cannot get enough, especially at the brewpub. This is a solid beer I can drink gallons upon gallons of!"
"drinkable - yep."
"D: Very drinkable and i'm not really into porters, but I could easily get into a few of these in a sitting."
"Pretty harsh at first, but as the beer warms, it really opens up and becomes a very tasty brew. The coconut is well-embedded, but not overwhelming, and there's plenty of balance and complexities to keep things interesting. Pairing? Macaroons all the way!"
"D. Super drinkable. Also thick and awesome - especially for a 5.7% beer."
"D- A really tasty porter. I don't know if I would sip these on the beach but I certainly would pour one in the hotel!"
"A very tasty beer that might get a little cloying on repeated downings, but as a one-off would make a great dessert beer."
"D: Good flavor and balance. Very easy to drink."
"The beer has a nice body with a complimentary amount of carbonation. Very easy drinking, and superbly balanced. CoCoNut Porter leaves a delicious, slightly roasty, chocolate flavor in my mouth. The coconut in this beer is hard to find, but the base porter itself is quite delicious, to the point that any coconut character is hardly necessary for me to enjoy this beer."
"Pours a viscous charcoal black with a decent tan head on top. Retention is firm, but there's not much lacing/webbing. Smells of chocolate right away. Sweet creamy scents pull through as well. Mouthfeel is oh so creamy and smooth. This is like velvet. Flavor is a mix of mild cocoa and sourness. Not sure if that's the coconut that is sour, but there is a definite sour presence. I thought this could be like a liquid ""Mounds"" candybar, but not so much. This is more chocolatey IMO. Not bad though. I like it. Recommend."
"You taste like a stripper at the beginning of her shift, all lust and thrust, coconut and chocolate oil, you leave my mouth watering for more. Welcome home, baby."
"Drinkability: I'm a sucker for porters and this is an enjoyable porter. Definitely would buy on a regular basis if this was available to me."
"Overall I liked this beer a lot and has changed my mind about porters. I will definitely recommend this to others. In the future I will try more porters thanks to Maui Brewing."
"Good stuff overall. Nice to have readily available around here."
"Good beer. I can certainly understand the appeal - a solid porter, with a neat little twist, packaged up nicely, from a place that doesn't send much to the mainland."
"Although this is a great tasting beer, I'm not sure I'd want more than one of these in a sitting. Great beer nonetheless."
"Definitely a little different, but the coconut and sweet qualities aren't overdone. Delicious!"
"This pours a nice finger of tan foam over a good dark brown body. The aroma is most similar to the coffee and chocolate that you would expect from a porter but this, surprise, has a coconut aroma along with some roasted characters and caramel. The taste is actually rather nice. I'm gonna be honest I really don't like coconut as a flavor, but it works really well here. The flavors of coffee and chocolate are there but the nice toasted coconut are pleasant with all of it. There is a slight bitterness in the mouthfeel that isn't really helping as far as I'm concerned, but it is a good carbonation and consistency to help it go down really smooth. It's a very drinkable beer and a pleasant surprise for something I had my reservations about."
"Shared with some friends before racking our homebrew into its secondary fermenter. It pours a matte black-brown, highlighted in ruby, topped by a bit more than half of a finger of light tan foam. The nose comprises dark chocolate, light roasted malts, coconut milk, and a dash of creamy caramel. The taste follows this winning formula, though the chocolate seems to have been calmed down to a milk level and the coconut itself is now present in toasted form. The body is a light medium, with a light carbonation and an airy feel. Overall, a kinda surprisingly good brew (I'm not generally a fan o' coconut, but its presence here is quite welcome), one I wish was more widely available (or, at least, more available to me)."
"Pours a dark cola brown with a dense, foamy head. The aroma is rather mild, with notes of light coffee, a hint of chocolate, and toasted malt. The flavor is largely driven by the robust nuttiness, but it is also quite sweet and has a subtle kiss of the toasted coconut underneath. The texture is smooth and almost creamy, but a bit too thin to support the hearty porter flavors. Overall, it is mild, smooth, and quite pleasant, but it is a bit too thin and a bit too sweet for my liking. The use of coconut is different and interesting, though, and although it could be considered a bit gimmicky for a brewery from Maui, I thought it was a nice touch that made me want to search for this beer."
"One of the best beers out of a can thus far...in fact most of the dark beers I've had out of the can have been amazing. Appears almost pitch black when held toward the light the body has dark brown edges, light tan head foms thick and dwindles quickly...even speckled lacing lines the sides of my pint. Aroma has dark chocolate, creamy tones it a hint of toasted coconut even a touch of kona coffee. Flavor is roasty with fresh coffee, dark chocolate, and toasted coconut very interesting flavorful dark beer probably the best I've had in or out of a can. Awesome porter, really nice blend of flavors colliding, mouthfeel is creamy but ballsy with a good bit of acidity going on with mild natural carbonation. Medium to fuller bodied porter wih coffee grounds lying on the palate. Drinkability overall is joyous when of the hyped beers out there that really really lives up to it. Awesome original take on a classic style this one is just a great base porter that the toasted coconut works well with the whole picture."
"It balances it's dry, smoky/roasty/toasty quality against it's robust sweetness, then adds a layer of coconut. I was excited to try this, and the result surpassed my expectations by a wide margin. This is no mere gimmick, it's a damn nice porter."
"D - Very easy drinker. One that I can for sure have more than one of! Got this as an extra from PretzelCity, Big thanks to him!"
"Pours a deep brown with a tiny bit of a tannish head and not much if any lacing as it goes down. Understandable given the fatty nature of the coconut. Nose is a bit of roasted coconut and some roasted malt. Hints of something semi-astringent and acrid. Taste is quite off. Tastes nearly of stomach acid and is incredibly harsh. Nothing wrong with the can as it was split with a few others who thoroughly enjoyed it. I don't know if it was roasted coconut taken to the extreme or something else, but I could barely swallow the first sip and the second one I couldn't handle. Trying to stay unbiased, the mouthfeel was a bit light, but there wasn't a big issue with it. Drinkability was severely affected by the putrid taste; sorry to say that I really did not enjoy this, a disappointment after having wanted to try it for awhile."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"This is a good porter but I couldn't seem to get much coconut out of it and I'm pretty sensitive to it. Most of what can be tasted is a nice subtle finish. However, it does leave a rather conflicting feel. It coats the roof of your mouth and leaves a coating that is fairly unpleasant, much like sucking on coconut. Certainly worth a try if nothing else because it's a good porter"
"O- Glad to have tried this and would love more, It's unfortunate they are so far from where i live."
"D: As far as can beers go, this is definitely a drinker."
"Interesting concept just not executed as it went to the extreme in aroma and taste. Unless you are a ticker and want Hawaii no need to try this."
"Go out and get this. I dont think you will be disappointed, unless you dont like coconuts"
"Overall - A very tasty and interesting take on the Porter style. This makes a great dessert beer. You'll love this one if you're a fan of Almond Joy or Mounds!"
"D- Overall I could knock back all 4 cans and not feel bad other then the price that I payed for it (4 cans for 10 bucks!) I actually brewed a clone before I had this, there pretty close Although I think my carbonation is also way to pronounced."
"Drinks: like a solid porter. For a beer with coconut in the name, I'd like some more coconuts."
"M&D - super smooth, surprised how well this aged, this can sat in my cabinet for 10 months and didnt expect much after so long and it completely surprised me, great beer"
"A nice beer, but I don't get anything I can distinctly say is coconut. There is a mild aftertaste that isn't true porter, but I'm not sure I'd say it is coconut either. Nice dark pour, mouthfeel is a little thin but overall a tasty drink. Nice carbonation but doesn't manifest itself as huge head."
"M/D - Mouthfeel doesn't fill out the way I think it should and the carbonation isn't what it should be. The finish is slightly sweet. Pretty dull beer in general tho :-/"
"I could drink these all days simply to smell it over and over again."
"Overall: A surprisingly sweet porter with just enough coconut milk presence in the mix to make it noticeable. I would welcome a splash more coconut, but it's probably very easy to go too far with that. Carbonation is too high for me, but it does make this beer refreshing. Even with the thermometer at 90 degrees F today, the beer goes down well."
"D-- Great drinkability to this beer. It is thin at points but highly sessionable for what it has. A beach porter! Very much enjoyed this beer."
"A tasty porter with plenty going on and it's in a can which is a great plus."
"Overall this porter is smooth and easy drinking with a nice twist via the toasted coconut. I enjoyed drinking it and it goes well with the peppered lime chicken I'm having for dinner."
"Pours a deep rich dark brown clod with a light tan head that heaves minimal lacing. Pitch black with barely any color differentiation. Has a big coffee, toasted coconut and vanilla aroma. Taste is a bit off balanced with some bitter chocolate, no coconut and a touch of espresso. Mouthfeel is classic low carbonation porter but has a nice zing on the finish. Not the most drinkable beer IMO. Has a heavy mouthfeel and not my cup of tea."
"D: This is one I feel wants to be drank and enjoyed but without too much examination. I'd like to session on this more often if they were readily available in my area. While its not the coconut bomb they seem to be marketing themselves as, its a delicious porter from Hawaii. That counts for something in my books."
"Notes: Drinkability is excellent. I love that this beer is so rich and flavorful with just 5.7% ABV. I could definitely drink a few of these no problem."
"A very nice, surprisingly refreshing porter from the islands. Not a huge coconut flavor, but it does contribute a nice sweetness. Delicious stuff."
"m/d-Very full bodied beer that leaves a sweet roasty coating in the mouth. Not a real fast drinker, but it is real smooth. Overall a real good beer that is ""Like Hot Chicks on the Beach."""
"This one is all about the balance--and Almond Joy. That's it in a (coco) nutshell: balance and candy, just like life."
"D- I drink 1 or 2 of these every once and a while and I'm as happy as a clam. This isn't really a session beer, but it also doesn't really claim to be. It is a great beer, but maybe on a one can at a time basis."
"Very easy drinking beer. Had a couple of cans over a period of two hours."
"D- Very easy to drink. Good session beer, too bad it is expensive per can."
"D: The lighter body lens to an easy drinkability. This is a flavorful and fun, yet still serious beer. Very enjoyable."
"D- A thoroughly enjoyable take on the style. Smooth and drinkable."
"Pours a dark cola brown with a frothy light khaki colored head that fades quickly to a thin fizzy ring with little lacing. Aroma is very mild, dominated by a light coconut sweetness and very little else. Flavor starts with a mild roasty malt flavor, pretty much a non-descript porter and the finish is complemented with a smooth coconut sweetness. Body is a little thin for the style with medium carbonation. This is very balanced and smooth, and the coconut adds a unique dimension to it, but it's lacking in the body and any depth of flavor like some other american porters. It's a porter for drinking a six pack of, rather than savoring a single one and that's not a bad thing."
"pretty good, could be a bit more mellowed out and blended. comes off as a bit harsh for a porter. nice flavors though and a low ABV are crucial."
"SkÅL!"
"Drinkability: Maui Coconut Porter is really a solid, drinkable porter. I will definitely have this again if I ever happen to see it around."
"O - Well, looking back on the review, I'd have to say that this is one example of where it would be good to have a separate overall score, instead of just a sum of the components. It's better on the whole than each aspect of it combined. This is one beer that I'll miss after I return to the east coast. I'll have to stock up on it."
"This is not my favorite style...but still not a bad beer to drink...unique porter that is refreshing on a summer day."
"Drinkability -- This one didn't knock my socks off, and I couldn't taste much coconut. Beyond that, it's tasty and, while I was hoping for a fuller-bodied brew, the lighter mouthfeel made it especially easy-drinking."
"A 4-pack is adequate for this brew. It's not a bad porter by any means, but personally I like to waft toward deeper flavors and textures in my heavy beers. Leech off some of the excess water in this one, and it could be a heavenly experience."
"drinkability - smooth and rich, great for the style"
"Into a pint glass, it poured black with one finger of khaki, modest retention, and decent lacing. The smell was very dark chocolatey, with a hint of toasted coconut, almond, and even a little alcohol essence. The taste seemed a lot smoother, with a big dark chocolate underpinning which eventually gave way to the nicely blended toasted coconut finish, which lingered afterwards. Little carbonation; smooth and medium-bodied. Nice to pair with a creamy dessert."
"Taste, good amount of coconut, not artificially sweetened from what I can tell, holds itself in check. Would have liked a rougher bitter, hoppier edge, but for a summertime porter, I guess smooth is the way to go. Chocolate comes through more down can. Price = ugh, $12 a 6 pack, but it is very drinkable."
"Not really getting the coconut factor in all this, but I thought this was otherwise a nice enough porter."
"Maui Brewing Company--CoCoNut PorTeR--Like Hot Chicks On The Beach--Porter Brewed With Hand-Toasted Coconut--2010 12 oz. Micro-Can. 5.70% ABV. 30 IBU's. (4.0 / 5.0) Porter--Coconut. Dense lacy tan head. Opaque dark black color. Mild roasted coconut chocolate hop hint front. Creamy textured rich mild sweet slightly burnt black bread doughy coconut flavored smoke hint tasty Porter body. Dry harsh bitter coconut bite mild hop end. Tasty, but coconut at end detracts. Sampled 7/21/2010. 4- Pack $10.99."
"D- It's an extremely drinkable beer. I enjoyed it and would definitely like to have this around."
"D- Certainly a porter with a twist! Reminded me more of a sweet stout. Lots of nice flavors in there, and not too sweet with a bitter balance. Very tasty!"
"D= This porter would be excellent for dessert. I would pair it with a bittersweet chocolate torte with raspberrys,baked pears with chocolate sauce or almond biscotti. Or Gruyere cheese at the end of a meal."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is slightly watery but very acceptable. Very drinkable twist on a porter that I would certainly get if I wanted a darker beer in Hawaii."
"D - Decent drinkability. Good as a summer porter because of its light body."
"Ok, well we know I love beer from a can, as long as it is good beer from a can. This beer had a super light body that was smooth and pleasant to drink. The coconut really shines in this Porter. Its really amazing how the delicate flavors shine through but still dont over power the beer. The coconut plays well with the hints of dark chocolate and light coffee that is in this beer. THIS IS WORTH FINDING AND DRINKING ALL SUMMER IF POSSIBLE! Great Beer!"
"This was a great brew. Lovely after dinner and a good sipper. I'll make sure to grab more nest time I'm in their distrobution area."
"D- good drinker of a porter even as a tropical summer session brew. I will be drinking this as regularly as I can."
"I'm glad this was kept below 6%. If I could get this more readily, I probably would as it is intriguing."
"Pours a shiny black color with no head whatsoever, just a few specks of foam. Seriously smells of cocoa and coconut. Normally I would not be a fan, but something here works to make it quite enjoyable. The taste starts out the same, but after a bit you get some really nice roasted malts coming in to help balance it out. Really smooth, and with a lighter body than I'd expect for a porter, but it goes nicely with the flavor. Definitely a bit on the sweet side, but not too much. For some this could be a great introduction to craft beer or darker beers. For me it is a totally refreshing beer - I probably wouldn't have more than 1-2 at a time, but you can be sure that I'll be picking up some cans of this, and trying some of the brewer's other beers."
"Overall, this is a very good porter. A little light on the body, but a lot of great flavors. Very drinkable."
"D- pretty good. Not to sweet and goes down smooth. Great session beer. Wish I had more"
"As far as taste... yeah there it is. Delicious. More chocolate and nuts, a hint of coffee. Coconut and faint hops round out the finish. For some reason I expected fresh coconut, but they probably toast it first, and that's how it tastes. Medium bodied like a good porter should be. A little tannic. Perfectly integrated. This is my kind of session beer, one of the best porters I've ever had."
"Poured this from a can into my tulip. Very dark brown with about an inch of tan head. This vanishes quickly to reveal spotty lacing. Coconut is a big front runner in the nose followed by a welcome presence of coffee and roasted malts. Initially I taste espresso beans and bitter cocoa. The finish delivers vanilla and the very anticipated coconut flavor. This medium bodied beer is nicely carbonated, but it feels a bit syrupy. This tasty treat seems prefect for a cool summer night spent on the back deck."
"Solid body. Good texture. Lightly carbonated, soft and silky. Not watery like a lot of porters, which is a bonus for me. Very, very easy drinker, despite being pretty sweet. Great porter."
"Well worth the wait."
"D: The coconut adds an interesting dimension to this beer. I really enjoyed the smell and wish the coconut came through a little more on the taste. But overall, this is a decent beer and fairly easy to drink."
"The Coconut porter pours a deep brown almost black color with a very big 3 finger tan head that slowly fades. Not much lacing on the glass. Smell is somewhat fruity with a nice malted chocolate backbone. I'm not picking up any coconut in the nose. Taste is smooth with a nice finish. Flavors consist of traces of coconut, bitter chocolate, and some hops. No alcohol is present at all. Mouthfeel is silky smooth while fairly light bodied. This is a very drinkable brew, if I were able, I would stock my fridge with this beer."
"Much like it smells, very nice mild coconut, doesn't overpower, still a little sweet for my taste. A nice dessert beer for sure."
"Incredibly enjoyable to drink and one I think I could happily give a go at sessioning. Full flavoured and enjoyable but without going over the top and there's just enough coconut to keep you interested but not so much that you'd get sick of it."
"D: Surprisingly drinkable. I don't have that much experience with American porters, but I still got the feeling that this wasn't exactly the best representation of the style. Not a bad thing in my mind, as this was still a good beer."
" Body is full and creamy, but not overly rich. This is an interesting take on a standard porter, but I would have liked to see a slightly more assertive coconut presence."
"M/D: Creamy with hints of light sweet caramel on my tongue. Very smoothe and pleasing as the coconut flavour is mild. I could drink some of this brew all day with some coconut/galic shrimp from the North Shore."
"Edit: The 2nd time I got some I tasted and smelled the coconut more, different batch maybe. So there you go."
"D: I was pleasantly surprised by this porter. The coconut is pretty hard to pick out, and I wouldn't know it was in it unless the can told me, but it is a delicious porter none the less. Body is smooth and the flavors are light yet complex. If not for the price I would buy this more often."
"Mouthfeel is slightly above medium bodied and carbonation is below average. Drinkability is very good, I really liked the beer. The smoothness the coconut gave it is very nice and definitely made it more drinkable. Also it was very nicely balanced which I liked."
"Edit: last few times I have had this the flavor hasn't been as bold or delicious so I lowered it a bit."
"D: I wish I had a six-pack of this stuff. Hell, I'd settle for a two-pack!"
"Great porter, just wish it showcased coconut more. Tasty and easy to drink. Ill bust one open and drink it right out the can, yah I said it."
"Thanks Cheezdawg!"
"d: a great beer that is absolutely worth a try"
"d - Overall an interesting porter. I liked it and thought it was a pretty standard porter with hints of coconut in the smell and taste, which was very appealing to me. If you like porters and coconuts check this out."
"Although it is called Coconut Porter, there was nothing coconutty whatsoever about this beer (apart from a very quick dash of coconut milk towards the end) which is a real shame because if it had some of the coconut notes on the nose and more in the mouth this would really be an eyecatcher for me. Having said that it didn't alter my score as I still enjoyed the interplay between milk and bitter chocolate on the palate. A nice interpretation on the porter style."
"D: Easy to drink and I'm glad I could try it, but ultimately nothing special. It it was a local I'd purchase it again, but I don't plan on trading for it"
"Poured a black color into tulip glass. Little to no head with slight bubbles. The smell of roasted coconuts is the first to hit the nose. Taste of coconuts, chocolate and roast fills the tastebuds. Nice mouthfeel with a good backend. Good drinkability with the different flavors going on. This is a good summer beer on a hot day. I was expecting a full on coconut taste but this combination makes it very good and tasty."
"D- Certainly a porter with a twist! Reminded me more of a sweet stout. Lots of nice flavours in there, and not too sweet with a bitter balance. Very tasty!"
"Another great canned beer. Looks perfect in the glass--Black with a creamy tan head. Smells of rich chocolate, with a bit of coconut mixed in. On the palate, I get a lot more chocolate, and roasted malt. Interestingly, the coconut is not really noticeable at this point. Creamy, nicely carbonated and easy to drink. A very nice porter."
"Poured from a 12oz can into a pint glass. Jet-black as it enters the glass, foams up to a pretty good-sized head that leaves behind some lacing. There's a fair amount of chocolate in the nose, sweetness as well, I don't know if that's the coconut I'm getting. Taste is consistent with the smell; coconut is definitely detectable towards the finish. The body isn't too full but the maltiness leaves a semi-dry finish. Very smooth and very drinkable, a good take on the traditional American Porter."
"D: Very smooth and drinkable and the abv is dead on for a porter."
"Over all, this is a fun beer to try. If you enjoy porters and have accesses to this, I reccomend trying it."
"D: This is an easy beer to drink, without offering any challenge. My concluding thought is that this beer is overpriced, at about $10 per four-pack."
"Pours a deep black/brown with not much light coming through on the edges. Nice initial head that settles to a fine ring that lasts throughout. Smell is great, semi-sweet chocolate, mild coffee, cream and a touch of black pepper. Taste is equally as impressive. A little slow to come alive in the mouth but once things get started it snowballs from there. Nice bitter/sweet chocolate notes, again a mild amount of coffee grounds, perhaps some vanilla. Good velvety mouthfeel. Dangerously sessionable."
"Overall, a top-notch brew that's worth some effort to obtain. A job well-done."
"D: a tasty beer, I can feel the sugar rushing through my head tho... so I don't think I would drink too many of these... I might just be a bit hungover from Winterstorm at Stone last night???"
"(Since my initial review, this has become one of my top three favorite porters)"
"Overall, I support the can beer movement and this is a great example of what is possible, if you have a chance to try it I say grab it. Aloha!"
"Drinkability- Really good, this was a good porter."
"D - Very nice. Rich without being overly heavy. I think I'd buy this often if it was around here in MN. I don't even particularly like coconut. Weird."
"Poured a super deep brown with good carbonation and a tannish head. Nose is chocolate, coffee and roasted notes. Taste is chocolate, coffee, roasted malt...hey..where is the damn coconut? Another sip, hello, coconut. Mouthfeel is roasted malt, cocoa and coffee again, oh there is the faint coconut on the very end. Solid beer and very drinkable."
"Pours a black-brown, ruby highlight edges and a couple fingers of frothy cocoa colored head that slowly dissolves and leaves a nice thick ring around the glass. The aroma is roasted malt, bitter chocolate and a some toasted coconut. The flavor is dark chocolate, roasted malt and finishes sweet with a little more of the toasted coconut. Its medium bodied with a light amount of carbonation. Nice porter, I like that the coconut is slight which creates a nice complexity to the roasted and chocolate."
"So good. One of my good friends here raves about this beer and now I know why. I will be waiting with great anticipation for this in the years to come."
"Great appearance with black color that remains black when held to light. Head is a light tan color and has plenty of thickness and resilience long after the initial pour. Nose is also very appetizing with some soft coconut, roasted malt, and a whiff of hop character in the background. On the palate the flavors are a little subdued, with a thin, watery body, and not as much roasty flavors or coconut that the nose suggested I would find. Easy drinking though, but not the beer I expected based on the nose."
"Overall I had high hopes for this brew and I was not disappointed. This is without a doubt an amazing beer (in a can no less) that needs to be enjoyed. I am not a huge fan of coconut but this beer had just enough to change the complexity and bring something new to the beer world. Excellent work MB."
"D= A very drinkable beer that in my opinion is a B+ porter that gets elevated by its unique coconut aroma. I wish the coconut was stronger in the flavor area, but still a great beer."
"This one pours near black with ruby highlights and a tan head. The aroma is sweet and malty - the coconut is present but not overwhelming, as are other scents of lactose, raisins, cola, and a hint of milk chocolate. The taste that follows is very similar - all chocolate, cola, and coconut with no hop presence. I really appreciate the natural, and not overly done, coconut taste. The carbonation is a bit low - and with such a sweet tasting beer, makes the mouthfeel a bit cloying and coating. Overall though, a unique porter worth seeking out."
"- Overall this is a fantastic porter... this can hold up to a world class porter like Fullers quite easily. I rather like this, and for the price would certainly buy it again. Great session brew."
"The Maui Brewing Coconut Porter pours a very dark brown in the glass with a tan froth that dissipates quickly & above average lacing when froth is present. Rich aromas of milk chocolate, subtle smoke, roasted coconut shavings, subtle espresso, roasted malts....damn...this beer smells rich, robust, sweet, full, & awesome! This beer is really only 5,70% abv?!? All of the aromas turn into flavors on the palate with an emphasized roast & chocolate character, sweet/syrpuy texture, & long finish. Although this is definitely a dessert beer, this is one that I'm completely enjoying, one that I highly recommend, & one that I'll absolutely buy in the future! A must try in my opinion!"
"What's great about this is the dry finish. The carbonation is light but I'm not sure I'd call this smooth. While obviously full bodied, it doesn't seem so heavy; not like a RIS or anything like that."
"Drinkability: Overall, this has a lot of flavor. The addition of coconut makes this a surprisingly refreshing Porter. I have edited this review after trying again in January of 2011, when I enjoyed it a lot more."
"I'm not the biggest coconut fan, either... but actually think it made the beer. Pretty tasty."
"Its black with a creamy, off white, slightly brown head with almost no carbonation. There's some lacing left behind. The smell is mostly roasted malt with a slight coconut aroma. The taste is predominantly roasted malts with a good amount of sweetness, some mild bitterness and the coconut shows up in the finish. Its medium bodied, not much viscosity. I can't detect carbonation in the taste. Its also fairly easy drinking and I could see this a good session porter."
"D- Very easy drinking. A great porter all around that I could sip on all night."
"D: I enjoyed this beer. I was in Hawaii for my Honeymoon and I bought Maui Brewing Company's beers any time they were available at a restaurant or bar. The coconut porter is probably the best beer made in Hawaii."
"The palate opens with a combination of dark chocolate and coconut, fairly well balanced, much along the lines of what you'd expect a coconut truffle to taste like minus the richness. Mildly cola-like, I get a little bitterness towards the finish that could be hop-based (it's a little fruity). Mild medium-roast coffee bitterness is present as well. The finish is long with mild chocolate bitterness and some coconut flavor. Medium-light in body with a high level of carbonation and a great finish, this beer is pretty great and thoroughly drinkable. I'd drink another if I could"
"Overall, a very nice sessionable brew from Maui. Would visit this one again, but am definately disappointed by the lack of coconut flavor in the taste."
"Overall: Very good, but a little too sweet for me personally."
"Although it's not my favorite porter, this is usually a staple of my fridge, mostly because my wife is a fan. An additional benefit is that you can fit a lot more of these cans in the door of your fridge then you can bottles."
"Thanks for the can, Mike!"
"Sample at the Most Honorable SuperHappyFun Stout Tasting. Can courtesy of a traveling coworker. This beer pours a dark brown/mahogany color with a medium thin beige head that diminishes steadily. Aroma of coconut and roasted pralines. Medium body with flavors of coconut milk, roasted nuts and dark chocolate. Touches of hops as well. The finish is creamy with a mild coconut aftertaste. Interesting and enjoyable overall."
"Glad I got to try this one. Wish there was a more prevalent coconut flavor. It might just be my digging, but it comes out a little more as the beer warms, but still not all that powerful, but all together not too shabby."
"Drinkability- very good porter right up there near the top, if there was more of a coconut presence it would fit its name even better"
"D: Very drinkable, this is an AWESOME Porter. Really good stuff here."
"D: this was perfectly paired with the chocolate lava cake and it's very easy to imagine this beer being just as good on its own. the coconut wasn't overpowering (in fact, just the opposite- the coconut flavor was well balanced) and it wasn't too sweet. I was expecting it to be a bit more full bodied, but that certainly doesn't take away from an otherwise excellent brew."
"There's a big head on this sucker but that goes away pretty soon. And pretty soon, you will forget this comes in a can instead of the way awesome coconut shell mug portrayed on the can. The toasted coconut comes through really well, and leaves a wonderful aftertaste making it very drinkable. I would raise my coconut mug if I had one, but instead I'll raise my glass and tell you, ""There is some good beer that comes in a can. And it's flipping delicious...No. Go get your own."""
"D: Good flavor with no alcohol taste, it's tasty enough where I want to keep drinking more sips so that's a good sign!"
"D- This is a highly drinkable beer. I would recommend this beer to anyone who wants to try something different and good. Glad I got to try this one out."
"Mouthfeel is exceptionally light for a porter. Quite drinkable."
"D - The only thing detracting this from a better score is that while I love coconut I couldnt drink a coconut beer all night before my palate wore out on it. Still a supremely drinkable beer."
"Medium bodied and very easy to drink, this beer is a winner for the style."
"Beer is dark, dark brown and forms a fluffy head that dies a quick death. Nose is, you guessed it, coconut, but with some chocolate and molasses mixed in, really enticing smell. Beer is well balanced with a roastiness that carries through the entire drink. Finish leaves a mild chocolate flavor on your palate. Medium bodied with appropriate carbonation a no noticeable alcohol bite, you can really drink this one quick and go back for more. I'd recommend this beer especially to those who only seems to drink Guinness and Newcastle."
"Good drinkability, may be a little too rich after a while though. Although the brew doesn't sit too heavy, I'd imagine if you had 4 or 5 of these, they might get a little too sweet. Then again, having one or two would be a great way to start off or end your night."
"AFTERMATH. Just plain fun! This would be great for late summer afternoons, when the temps drop into the low 70s, on a porch, some sweet wood-fired BBQ or a fat burger."
"Notes: This is a pretty tasty porter! I had been putting off trying this brew in fear that the coconut would dominate and make this overly sweet. Luckily, that is not the case at all. It stays subtle and allows the rest of the flavors to shine with it, while keeping an even keel between sweet and bitter. Even if the mouthfeel is a bit too thin for my personal tastes, it turns out to be a minor complaint because it works sufficiently with the flavors at hand. Nicely done!"
"I love this beer... truly."
"Tastes of sweet coconut covered chocolate. Pretty damn tastey. Also some wood characteristic finish with a pleasent roasted malt taste. Good carbonation, but not overdone. A great beer one should seek out."
"Thanks, atigerlife, for the opportunity"
"D: A very nice beer to try, but I wouldn't want more than one in a sitting."
"A really nice porter. The folks at Hale's trying to brew a coconut porter ought to have a few of these, throw out their old recipe and then try again."
"D: I thought this was an interesting take on the style. I could go for another one sometime."
"Cheers!"
"I had one of these when it was first released and was not very impressed. I thought this one was better and had a lot more flavor that wasn't only roasted malt."
"I liked this beer... but if I ever find it again, I'll let it warm a bit more."
"Despite my minor criticisms, this is a very drinkable beer. Now, I just wish that they had better distro, so I'd have better access to it."
"D: Very drinkable with its excellent flavor, good texture, and moderate ABV. An excellent beer for dessert."
"overall a very nice porter with a interesting twist thats not overpowering at all. i was a little worried ill be honest but this is a good brew..trying the big swell next... man i cant get over these craft brews in cans..."
"Drinkability: A bit sickening after a while, there are certainly much better porters out there"
"Easy and delicious. I didn't get much coconut, but it was still a well done beer."
"D: Super smooth beer, great taste and mouthfeel. A solid beer."
"D - Goes down very easily. The 5.7% alcohol does not make its presence known. This beer is very smooth and easy drinking. Could definitely have a few of these in one sitting. Despite the Hawaiian heritage, seems more appropriate to be drinking on a slightly cool night...on 2nd thought - a cool night on the beach - guess the Hawaiian thing works on this one."
"Overall this was a very good non-traditional porter. Worth a shot."
"In a CAN from Hawaii, no less! CAN you dig it? Two fingers of deep-tan head with decent retention. Color was a deep cola-brown with ruby highlights. Nose was dark chocolate and coconut. Mounds, anyone? Mouthfeel was medium with a chocolate/coconut taste on the tongue that simply reminded me of having a Mounds bar in my mouth. Yow! Finish was equally sweet. I probably would not want this on a full-time basis, but as a dessert beer or one for a beer-phobic date, this would be perfect."
"All in all a good one -- the smell is great, & the taste doesn't quite deliver on the promise. Still very good, IMO, but I'd love to have a brew that matches that aroma."
"Drinkability: Even given my enjoyment of coconut, I gave the drinkability reduced marks because in a sense this is a novelty beer, not something I'd consider for regular consumption. But it DOES offer something new and quirky for those times one might like something different."
"This is a pretty tasty porter, I don't like coconut much but it's not really that prominent in this beer anyway. Wish this was available locally."
"Overall, I REALLY want to love this, but don't. Still pretty tasty, especially as it warms."
"D: This is truly a delicious porter. I'm not a huge fan of coconut, so it was nice that it is really subtle in this brew. I highly recommend this to porter lovers."
"ABV just high enough to prevent you from guzzling the whole glass in one go (5.7%). Eminently drinkable, though the coconut (while in no way dominating) might put some people off after more than a couple glasses."
"Sorry, Maui lovers - it looks & smells great, but that's about it for me."
"D: A fantastic beer, very difficult to just sip, but it's what allows the complexity of this beer to shine through. I'd say that one is about enough in one sitting, then you start to get coconut burps and those I can do without. Oh but I will this beer and Maui Brewing Company. Must return soon, hopefully they will be around for a while."
"The carbonation is a bit crisp, with a thinner body then i would think for a porter. This is a great easy drinking brew with a punch, not too expensive."
"Overall, this beer is simple but unique. Great flavors and extremely drinkable for a porter."
"The taste is zesty but mostly thick and smooth, a pleasant, fairly rich ""porter character"" with some complexity. It is toasty with light blackstrap molasses, earthy with wet soil, hints of licorice, leaves, mocha, and chocolate ice cream. It is slightly oily."
"Taste is very carbonated, maybe a bit too much, almost cola like, not picking up the metallic taste that I thought was going to be there after the smell, so that's an improvement, still hardly enough coconut presence to be deserving of such a title, it does have a sweet syrupy aftertaste though."
"Overall a very drinkable and enjoyable porter that I was really glad to try. The coconut didn't show as much as I thought, but still it was very enjoyable and a beer I would drink any time."
"D: Thank you, sir, may I have another?!? An excellent porter that doesn't skimp on the coffee. Oh yeah, the coconut is a nice element as well."
"I really should sit and let this warm even more...but I'm having a tough time doing that. Just another indication that this crazy thing drinks pretty damn well. Style points for uniqueness, innovation and inspiration...no doubt. Now I want to brew a mocha coconut imperial stout."
"Really huge and airy head, all the bubbles large and delicate, almost like a puff pastry, light brown in color, the lacing is full but slides down the glass sides swiftly. Close to black but it's more a very, very dark brown color, minimal difference around the rims. Coconut oil, coffee beans and dark chocolate make a succinct statement in the nose, in no way overpowering, firm maltiness with a pinch of flowers and baking spices. Medium-bodied, fresh and fluid mouth feel combines with a spring water lightness to keep the drinkability high. The bittersweet chocolate and coffee more pronounced than the coconut, the latter toastier here than in the nose. Gentle notes of peat moss or forest scrub to it. Strong carbonation for overall weight, weakens the finish. Not as sweet as you suspect it could have been, very appreciated."
"D - Pretty good."
"D: Dude, I would drink a lot of this if I had it. This makes a great dessert beer because the flavor is not as sweet as the aroma. You get that dessert smell, but it doesn't overload you on the sugar. Sits pretty light in the tummy and the ABV keeps this baby pretty drinkable. I have to bring up that aroma again because it is just that good. It truly is amazing and I almost gave it a 5 but lack of diversity kept me from doing so. Still its amazing. It all works and would be better with a slight thicker feel. Just seems it would match the flavors and aroma a bit more. The feel as it is just seems a bit out of place. All in all, very good to great. Thanks, Tim!!!"
"WOW! Poured a very dark brown, with a slight amount of tan foam. The smell of sweet coconut and chocolate fill the nose with a pleasant sweet aroma of the tropic's. The taste was the same as the aroma, except the taste of coconut was number one, the semi sweet chocolate was number two, with a slight hint of the roasted malts being number three. I just loved this porter. This will go as one of my favorites and will buy six packs upon six packs next time I visit Maui, next year for sure. Aloha and Mahalo to Maui Brewing Company!"
"D :: Good porter overall, but I didn't get a strong coconut flavor. I can't say that's a bad thing however as the coconut was light and in the background as to not overpower the beer. I think that the lighter coconut flavor worked well here and added some sweetness to balance the roasted character. I could drink this again."
"Hats off to the folks at Maui Brewing for coming up with a memorable porter. Poured a jet black with a thick, solid white foam in my tulip glass. Slight aroma of a little bitter chocolate, but the flavor is where this one really gets you. Rich, bitter chocolate with maybe a tad of coffee and a very subtle, creamy coconut flavor underneath. I really appreciate the restraint they used with the coconut, you bearly notice it, but you can sense the creamy dimension there. Nice creamy mouthfeel. A very enjoyable and memorable porter."
"EDIT: Wiseman Nick: they're* dumbass, and yes THEY'RE MY BEERS! GIT UR OWN!"
"D - Comes in a 6pack of cans and is delicious and fairly inexpensive. I'd say very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is a touch light for me, but this is highly drinkable. Kudos for taking a pretty standard style (for my experience) and giving it a cool twist. This is a porter I could drink on a sunny day or at the beach. Right on."
"Drinkability is very good. Very nice porter that has lots of flavors, but doesn't overpower you with too much alcohol. I'd happily drink more than one these. Nice porter, well done Maui Brewing!"
"Overall, a very tasty, interesting beer that I couldn't drink more than one of because of the sweetness. Definitely good and worth a try if you can get it."
"Pours very dark brown in color. Whatever frothy head that was there from the pour is completely gone. This has a very cola like look in the glass. Smell is highly roasted malts and just a slight hint of coconut. Taste is very roasted almost burnt malts and just mild coconut lingering underneath. There is quite a bit of bitterness coming from something in here. Can't quite put my finger on it and figure it out but it's definitely there. This is a little thinner than I was expecting. Completely clear around the edges. Very enjoyable to drink and quite sessionable."
"M & D: The mouthfeel is a little thin and could use a touch more carbonation. Still goes down way to easy. If this was readily available I would grab a four pack to keep in the fridge at all times."
"The previous ones tasted like a well balanced porter with just a hint of roast coconut. This one I had a few nights ago had bright fresh coconut taste, very tasty and drinkable and not overbearing as long as you like coconut ... but why would you be drinking this if you didn't?"
"I don't have any others to drink! I would love to try it on tap."
"Darkest brown bordering on black, large two finger head with nice lacing. Aroma is very chocolaty, some nuttiness and just a hint of coconut to round things out. Smells fantastic! Taste follows suit with the nose, plenty of chocolate and roasty malts, and the coconut becomes much more prevalent than the nose lets on. Toasty and roasty, lightly sweet. Body is a tad to thin for such a good tasting stout. This thing would be out of the park if it had a little more umph. Very nice though, and very drinkable. Glad I had the chance to try this one. Thanks go out to alexd3891 for sending a 4 pack my way!"
"Well dang, if I never have another one, I'll probably remember this flavor forever. Doesn't hit you over the head with novelty, or come at you with too much sweetness. It lets the coconut do what it does, and remains a good sensible porter to boot. Sure wish I had greater accessibility to this, I could see this being a regular go-to beer. Another great beer from a can!"
"Overall: wonderful flavor for a unique beer. Mouthfeel could have been better, but overall I'm very impressed. If only this stuff made it to Minnesota...or out of Cali for the matter."
"Definitely try once or twice, or six times."
"Drinkability: Really sweety, pretty drinkable though, good flavors. Lives up to the name!"
"pours solid black with a nice brown head. the nose is very pungent. chocolate, big malts, coconut, sweetness from everything (malts, coconut, etc). the taste is dry malts up front followed by coconut sweetness in the finish. the coconut really gives this beer some depth because it is so fresh and tropical in the taste. big roasty malts. full bodied, medium carbo, an instant classic."
"Thanks to ThirstyBird for sharing this one. 12oz. can served in my Gouden Carolus chalice. Poured two shades shy of black. Half inch off-white head recedes into a skim. Nose is big on roasted coffee, followed by toasted coconut. Taste follows nose; roasted character is in the forefront but the coconut clearly comes out immediately after. Also picked up a milky quality. Mouthfeel is thin, slightly watery and lightly effervescent. Decent drinkability and flavor for the abv. I'm not a huge coconut fan, but this is pretty tasty."
"Thanks again, Bill."
"This beer goes for $14+ a 4 pack on the island, but it is quite good."
"This is what canned beer needs, a big tasting porter with low ABV. Full bodied , chocolate notes on the midbody and some coconut on the finish(though less than I thought). The beer is well balanced and has enough smoothness to make the drinkability quite high. A real pleasure to find a good porter in a can."
"D- This is a great porter and I am happy to have the opportunity to try it. The sweet and toasted flavors compliment each other very well and develop a nice balance. The flavor is also not cloying in any way."
"I had this great porter at the Maui Brew Pub while visiting Maui. I really enjoyed the richness and flavor of the coconut. I liked so well I bought a six to bring home, but ended up drinking it on the beach with my son. Had to buy more to bring home! If you are in the islands find this porter!!"
"Very smooth and creamy reminds me more of some stouts that I've had more than a porter. This is probably one of the best porters I've ever had."
"D - If this were at a bar with the normal selections for Ventura, this one would finish second to Amstel Light for the next round."
"Poured into my SA beer drinking glass. Dark brown in the glass with faint strips of reddness shining through. Solid 2 fingers of mocha brown froth. Right away, aromas of sweet roasted coconut and Nestle quik chocolate. Nicely balanced flavors of sweet coconut, roasted malt and bitter hops. Coconut felt in the mouthfeel, but not overly so. Unique beer...pretty good."
"M/D - Medium to full bodied, a little more crisp than most porters. Would like to see it a little creamier. Still, a very good porter from the islands."
"Can: Poured a pitch-black color porter with a rather large medium brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of roasted coconut is clearly noticeable with some roasted malt notes. Taste is a nice mix between some fresh roasted coconut and some dry roasted malt. Bitterness is well controlled and coconut is well balance and more then a novelty. Body is a bit thin for the style but carbonation is pretty good. I could see this going well with some coconut chocolate cake."
"D - This one exceeded my expectations. I was expecting more coconut, but instead I was treated to a robust porter with plenty of chocolate sweetness and lots of body. The drinkability is simply fantastic with this one, perhaps the easiest drinking porter I've ever had."
"This beer is pretty drinkable, especially at warm temeperature. I'm a fan of coconut, so I like this one."
"D: Expensive for a four-pack of 12 oz. cans ($10-11), but very drinkable. I believe the Gold at the '06 WBC was well-deserved. Keep the good stuff coming, Maui!"
"Definitely the best beer you can have while sitting on the beach at sunset. The smell is mostly coconut, a little similar to sun tan lotion. To me, the taste is more chocolate than coconut. Extremely smooth and creamy. It's almost like drinking a chocolate milk. Having two in one sitting is just enough, but any more might be a little much. Price is a little steep but well worth it."
"D: Drinkability is very good. I could easily knock a couple of these back no problem. I'll definately be serching this out via trade in the future."
"This brew poured dark black with a fluffy, light cocoa-colored head that lingers, lacing up the glass. The smell of sweet coconut and licorice is prevalent. The taste is thin and tinny, but has a bit of a hoppy aftertaste that is not unpleasant, but it soon disipates into a bitter finish on the tongue. The mouthfeel leaves little to encourage you to hold it in your mouth. Overall, the beer is drinkable, but not great. The coconut and hops kind of battle each other."
"D: This is a solid porter. I don't find the coconut to be overdone, and I think the sweetness is a nice balance to the roastyness. In general, porter's are usually a bit too roasty for me so this hits the spot, at least for the style. I could do without the metallic taste. Beer just isn't as good out of a can. Good sessionable beer though. Not really a style I seed out, but would probably recommend it if someone was looking for a porter."
"Good stuff. The coconut could be a little more prominent, but it still is very tasty and balances nicely."
"This is a pretty thick beer for the 5.7% abv. Well blended and tasty. Nice and smooth"
"This may be my first can review! On to the beer...pours dark as can be but when held to the light and around the edges, you can see a deep, clear ruby color. I'm giving it a lower score because I had virtually no head or retention. This was my 3rd and final can, but each one the head, which was a nice mocha color, decipated so quickly and left nothing behind at all. Smell was nice and complex. Some dark chocolate, coffee, caramel, cream, and a bit of coconut...almost like a mounds bar in a glass. Taste was about the same. If I had a better palate I probably could point out 12 unique flavors. The coconut wasnt really present so much. It was virtually undetectable when the beer was a colder, but it came out (subtley) as it warmed. A creamy, dark chocolate, dark caramel, and the slightest touch of bitterness all blend together wonderfully. Mouthfeel was much heavier than expected. While I didnt mind it there is a very oily sensation left behind that seemed to be too much for me. Overall a very good Porter and easily drinkable beer. While the coconut wasnt there as much as I thought, the slight presence was nice and a little different."
"Brown color with an off-white head that quickly dissipates. Aroma of smoke, coconut, chocolate, and maple syrup. Taste has coconut, chocolate, coffee, and maybe some molasses. Higher than medium carbonation with light body. An interesting beer to try, but I'd like a little more body perhaps. Thanks to marchcow for the sample."
"Overall, whether you can pick out the coconut or not, this is a good porter all around."
"I was very pleasantly surprised with this beer. I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it often, but it's quality."
"Pours a lightly hazed dark brownish orange, bit of red as well in the edges, thick light tan head forms, drops to a thin ring around the glass, drops a bit of lacing, looks pretty good. Smell is great, chocolate, roast coffee, toast, coconut, toffee, bread, unrefined brown sugar, bit of licorice, vanilla, very nice. Taste is great as well, very heavy roast and chocolate, caramel sweetness, thick coconut and toast, vanilla, fig, toast is great in the finish, very smooth. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to low carbonation, nice roasty bitterness, the toasted coconut is easy to identify but doesn't take the beer over, but the carbonation is a bit sharp on the palate. This stuff is real nice. Thanks Dave!"
"Another easy drinking Porter enjoyed every drop and was left wanting more. If I saw this in the store I would grad a 4 pack of this for sure"
"Feels a little watery and slippery. Well carbonated and easy to drink."
"Overall this is a very nice porter, and a great session beer. Alot of flavor packed in there, and i like the coconut accent on it. I was kind of expecting a southerntierish blow the hell out the beer with adjuncts type of coconut sweetness, but the coconut is merely used as a spice or accent to this porter. And a very nice porter it is. Would buy this pretty regularly if we got it here. Would be awesome for hunting and fishing, cause of the cans. Good beer."
"The aroma was sweet coconut, but I think it smelt of coconut much more than it tasted like it. The body was roasty and smooth with a subtle slightly sweet coconut note- kind of thin. Overall a little too sweet for me, but it was really cool to try. A lot of my friends were going nuts over it."
"Pours a clear dark brown with some dark red hues in the light. Three fingers of creamy milk chocolate tan head lasts a good while, leaving some nice lacing lattice work behind along with some thin retention. Smells of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, toasted coconut, and a touch of hops. Tastes of roasted malt, milk chocolate, toffee, brown sugar, coffee, a touch of tobacco, coconut, vanilla, and slight bitter hop kick. Medium in body with good carbonation, smooth and creamy with good roastiness and a nice lightly bitter finish. Coconut isn't overpowering at all and meshes well with the other flavors. Very easy to drink and enjoyable."
"Wow, it was weird to drink beer this good out of a can. Pours dark brown with a 1 inch thick off-white head. Lovely aroma of roasted malt, vanilla, and coconut. Delicious blend of roasted coffee and hops, then moves into a smoother powdered cocoa, and finishes with a sweet coconut. Very nice."
"Pours a deep brown with ruby highlights, completely opaque in the glass. A nice two finger khaki head rises afterwards. Smells roasted, almost sweet like milk though... Taste is a little too toasted and roasted for me. I've enjoyed plenty of RIS and other porters, but this one doesn't sit right with me. An interesting beer none the less."
"Even without the coconut present, this would have come off as a quite robust and easy drinking Porter. The coconut just adds some additional sweet qualities that balances out a lot of it's roasty nature. Good stuff that I would gladly get into again."
"D- at 10.99 a 4 pack its a little steep but beyond that, 5.7 abv i could drink this all day!"
"Taste of coffee segues to a coconut close and with just a touch of spice. Otherwise the brew offers a rich mouthfeel and solid drinkability. A lively porter with a unique finish."
"Thanks to mymrnngjckt for including this in a recent swap. Poured from a 12oz. can into my nonic tumbler. Appears a slightly translucent dark brown color with a good two fingers of tan foam. Smells of cocoa, roasted malts, nuts, and toasted coconut. Tastes of bittersweet chocolate, toasted coconut(didn't expect the coconut to be so apparent, but yeah it's certainly in there), milk chocolate, vanilla. Very tasty and complex. Wonderful mouthfeel. Rather full bodied and reminiscent of an oatmeal stout, nice and chewy. Medium carbonation, just right. Reminds me of a liquid Mounds bar, minus the sweetness and the fact that I don't have to floss the coconut shreds from my teeth afterward."
"drinkability: good"
"drinkability is great. i'm not a huge coconut person, but this works really well. just enough to compliment without overpowering. good stuff that i'll definitely be looking for again."
"D: Not a bad porter but I don't specifically get any coconut in the flavor."
"This is my first experience with Maui Brewing Company and would like to search out other offerings."
"D: ABV is according to style, and the flavor is just phenomenal. well worth getting and drinking over and over again. very drinkable."
"D: Drinks pretty easy and has a low ABV. Add tasty and you got yourself some pretty good drinkability. I was a bit worried about this one, thinking the coconut could easily get too potent and ruin things. Not the case here."
"can poured into a snifter has a dark chestnut brown color and a thin layer of frothy thick brown head. aroma has bakers chocolate, light toasted coconut, thick chewy malt, and faint underlying hops. chewy nose and a little nutty. mouth feel is medium thick with fine carbonation and good coating. flavor is loaded with malt, heavy chocolate, coffee notes, and more toasted coconut than anticipated. sweetness is enough to keep the bitterness in check and the finish is roasted sweetness with a long duration. really full and chewy bordering on milkshake with roast that just puts it over the top."
"D: I'd certainly call this both a highly drinkable and sessionable beer. I would seel this beer out, and will likely do that shortly after I finish this one. It's canned too, which is a plus."
"D - This is VERY drinkable. Anyone put off by the fact that it comes in a can and is called 'coconut porter' should give this a try. It's one of the most drinkable porters I've tried. Too bad it isn't readily available here. I would always keep it on hand."
"D - This is definitely something I would have every day if forced to only drink one beer... in Hawai'i. But since that isn't the case, I will say that, while it isn't something that I would go absolutely bonkers for, it's certainly a beer with having once or twice at the end of a nice day."
"D- Good drinkability, i expected something more extreme but im pretty satisfied."
"Overall: This was probably the best beer I had while in Hawaii. I am glad to have brought back a few 4 packs, since I have never seen it in the continental US. Great beer, and I will buy it every time I see it."
"Drinkability: A yummy porter is what it is. And in a can, no less. The addition of coconut breathes a bit of new life into the humble, sometimes lackluster porter style. I feel a trip to Hawaii would be entirely wasted on me, as I'd spend a considerable amount of it at the Maui Brewing Co."
"Drinkability: I'm having a hard time deciding if I should drink some more. If I were in the mood to toss back a lot of beer I would be inclined to do so with this beer just because of the taste. However, I think I would probably start to get sick of it after a few more. It's definitely worth 1 or 2 at a time though."
"Almost black. Dark ruby streaking is apparant when held to a light source. medium sized light brown head. Good staying power. Lacing comes in full sheets. Very nice aroma of with thick roasted malts and chocolate and cocoa. Vanilla too and toasted nuts. the first thing I notice is the light body this porter has. It's light to light-medium on the viscosity meter. Too low in my opinion. Carbonation is appropriate. The toasted coconut is apparent on the buds. And it really adds a nice counterpoint to the thickly roasted malt character and bitter chocolate notes. I like the flavor. And this one is going down too fast. Good beer."
"Drinkability- Well the look and feel of the beer isn't that great but come on, in reality that's not why we drink this stuff. The taste is really nice and although I would like more of a coconut flavor the beer is solid. Very chocolaty and quite tasty. Thanks again to Wayne for sending this my way!"
"I had my share of these when I was in Hawaii last summer and i am glad to have a chance to review this one. Smells of coffee with some subtle coconut right after. The taste follows the smell with coffee, bitter chocolate and coconut. The mouthfeel has medium to light body. Drinkability is good, I could have a few of these no problem. Overall this beer is certainly worth a try. Taste's even better on a sandy beach in Hawaii."
"A big Thanks to Georgiabeer for this one!"
"Nice tasty beer here, will probably buy again."
"Nice medium body with average carbonation. Very smooth and silky. The low abv and the canned factor make this tasty treat pretty damn drinkable."
"From a 12oz can - Pours a dark brownish/black. Below average carbonation, no lacing whatsoever. Smells of strong coffee and chocolate. First sip is all dark chocolate and coffee with just a little coconut notes shinning through. A nice hoppy presence all make it work. Great bitter dark chocolate finish. A very fine beer from our 50th state!"
"Overall: if you like coconuts, you will love this well-crafted brewski."
"Long overdue update on 4/12/11: CoCoNut Porter has become one of my favorites. It also makes a great desert beer."
"GREAT stuff all!"
"This is a very tasty porter. The coconut is a subtle flavor, but it's definitely there. Quite drinkable. Tasty stuff."
"Dark cola brown, near black, with a nice cap of tannish espressoy foam. Aromas of conut, dark roasted malts, condensed milk, coffee, chocolate, and more! Taste is very chocolate/coconut up front with more bitter malt/hop/coffee in the back end. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth and excellent, as is the drinkability. Great stuff."
"This Hawaiian import definitely has some coconut aroma, but it's not as overwhelming as I thought it would be. The aroma is there, but in taste it's almost only an aftertaste. It's smooth and very drinkable and isn't too overpowering in any particular facet. I recommend it, but as more of a tasty session beer than something more memorable."
"D - I was not impressed. Generally speaking, I would not go out of my way to have another."
"meh..."
"D- Very interesting and easy to drink."
"D ~ Hard to beat & hard to beleive it's from a can! This is a well done Porter that's a little different, very approachable & very easy to drink & enjoy. Too bad it's not as easy to find. I'll be trading for more."
"Certainly not robust as the can states, but very well crafted and flavorful."
"D: The dryness could cut down on it a bit but a really good beer. Thanks brent56k for this in a trade. Solid totally different beer."
"Maui Brewing CoCoNut PorTeR is good beer that stands out because it comes in cans and because it uses an ingredient that is considered to be exotic. Although it doesn't venture as far outside the box as it should, better to have a coconut-accented porter than a porter-accented pina colada."
"My friend brought me back one of these from his trip to Hawaii. It was good but nothing to go crazy over, although the coconut flavor was very interesting and original."
"D: A very good beer. Worth seeking out for sure."
"Very drinkable. Really pleasant taste, nice feel, and nothing over done or interfering with the experience. A nice beer to have around if you can."
"This was a home run for me. A very different type of porter. Excellent example of a real good canned beer. I really enjoyed this one."
"Well done, brewers! It's not an every day drinker for me, but I will gladly have this again if I see it."
"Really good beer, run, dont walk to get it."
"D- This beer goes down very easily. It's so refreshing cold, but gets so complex and delicious as it warms. I really enjoy this beer and wish I could get more here in NY."
"D: This is going to be a pretty regular beer around my place. It's not cheap by any stretch of the imagination, but it's worth keeping a few around to share with others, especially if they are not very beer savvy. It's a great way to start inexperienced drinkers on ""dark"" beer."
"Pours a deep brown with nice tan head. As soon as you pour this beer a whiff of coconut hits you. Hops? I couldn't pick up any aroma but coconut. Taste is robust with malt being balanced by the hops and roasted coconut flavor. Mouthfeel is full with medium carbonation. Drinkability? Why only a 4-pack? Please someone get me a case of this-because the 4-pack isn't going to last. Excellent beer with high drinkability."
"D: This porter is absurdly drinkable. I wouldn't trust myself if I had a lot of this in the fridge. Sweet, but not overpoweringly so, this is a fantastic porter."
"This is one I have waiting to try for years. Pours blackest brown out of the can settling into the glass letting through no light. A creamy two finger thick khaki colored head has amazing retention leaving waves of lace. Nose has tones of fresh tootsie rolls, burnt smokey malt, zesty minerals and toasted coconut but just a hint. Big creamy roasted malt is like a tidal wave that coats the tongue and mouth throughly. A dark consistant richness drives the palate. There is a hint of coconut on the end of the flavor profile. Folowed by a short peppery spice feel. Mouthfeel is thick and saped off with a mineral nuttiness. This is a nicely drinkable beer but I was looking for a lot more coconut."
"D- Awesome beer. Number one Porter for me."
"12oz can courtesy of BrewerB, thanks man. Dark black, not much head. It smells roasty, and good, hints of coconut. The flavor is a robust porter, roasty with only the slightest hint of coconut, maybe its the power of suggestion? Mouthfeel is smooth but a little thin and this is easy to drink but I don't think I'd want more than one at a time."
"Worth a try for those that are curious."
"Grainy, dry full-bodied, muddled, muddy confused complexity. Malty. Slight roasty bitterness. Too many malts? Finish is not crisp."
"Thanks to jhenry04 for throwing this in as an extra in a recent trade."
"Can. Very nice appearance, with a dark brown color and well lasting foam. Nose doesn't have a lot of character but shows light traces of banana, toasted coconut and dark malts. Flavor shows notes of roast, coconut, cocoa and coffee. Silky mouth feel does impressive. It's a nice beer with good balance, but I was expecting more vibrant flavors and aromas. Would like to try again, but was expecting this to be a little better."
"Another craft beer from a can that kicks ass! Great job Maui Brewing!"
"T + M + D: Soft carbonation, semi-creamy. Malty, chocolate, coconut, could use a little more carbonation. Certainly a porter. It could potentially be a better sessionable if it were slightly lower (5.7%)."
"Drinkability: Novelty of the coconut wears off pretty quickly. Fortunately, the backing porter is pretty solid, so it's still decent after that, though a little less interesting. Recommended."
"this one is smooth, and slightly bitter at the end as all good porters should be. the toasted coconut comes in nicley in the middle, nice and creamy, and the begning is a nice dark carmal roast of the grains almost like a coconut coffiee blend, i can see why this one won gold at the 2006 world beer cup, if you can find one of theese get it and consider yourself luckey, i know i do!"
"T - First taste is the roasted chocolate flavor followed quickly by a subtle bit of coconut, balanced very well. Decent amount of carbonation. It was definitely a porter in the classic sense, only a little lighter due to the coconut. Extremely drinkable."
"A note on the cans - the look like minaturized Arizona pop cans. Thanks to bbothen for the bonus - even if the can design confused me for a sec."
"D: Very enjoyable and damn drinkable. I really like this one."
"D- Once again, despite being a porter, this would be a very sessionable beer for me. The flavors work well together, and don't over power. This is a unique beer that could have easily been a mess. I don't even like coconut that much, but I like this beer very much. I am glad I don't have to wait for our next trip to Hawaii to get it again."
"This is one impressive porter. I was really stoked to see it arrive and it didn't disappoint. I was told the coconut flavor might have dropped off a little since the can was a few months old. But, it tastes great to me. The coconut flavor is alive and well. The only negative aspect of this beer is the burnt smell to it. If Maui could work that out of the nose, it'd be slightly improved. Still highly recommended."
"Very drinkable robust porter. Don't let the ""coconut"" throw you off. Sure, there is coconut flavor here but this is first and foremost a robust porter. Lots of roasted grain flavor - coffee, chocolate, a little sweetness, and hints of coconut flavor. Great combination, I could easily drink the rest of this 4 pack in one sitting."
"Overall, I thought the beer was not too complex, but had a rather one dimensional flavor. Still, it was quite enjoyable and worth a try."
"It's not going to steal the show, necessarily, but it'll always be a handsome compliment to it."
"Drinkability is fair, a great and unique porter with tones of coconut that accentuate the malt profile without being too overwhelming, very exciting but I wouldn't drink a whole lot of this at a time, strangely the alcohol seems stronger than it should be at 5.5%"
"spicy, smooth, rich flavor that improves with warming. This beer should not be drunk cold. Before I drank one of these beers I had a piece of chocolate covered macadamia nut that my great beer trader sent along,( atigerlife ) and what a difference that made! this beer absolutly was more complex and wonderful. Now, it's hard not to have a piece of chocolare before or during one. If you can get it, you should. You won't be dissapointed."
"d: Big thanks to rallison for the chance to try this one. I loved it and I wish it was a local offering."
"Drinks pretty easy, a very nice porter, never had this the couple of 3 times I visited the brewpub, good choice for a flagship beer. I do wonder how much sells in Hawaii?, since folks gravitate toward lighter beers there"
"For a porter it's great but since it's labeled as a coconut porter I was expecting more coconut aromas and flavors. None of which made it to this brew."
"Beer poured black as night with a fine tan head. Nose was very much of roasted barley and hints of west coast hops. Taste is of those roasted malts, hint of chocolate, balanced by hops with a slight coconut finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very smooth. Overall drinkability is good. Even though i am not a coconut fan, this was a very nice recipe and should be tried if you are visiting paradise!"
"Flavor was very smooth, roasty , some chocolate and the smallest amount of coconut in the finish. A very smooth and drinkable beer, i wish it was sold around here, hopefully ill be able to get some more."
"**this is the most inconsistent beer I've ever seen. Sometimes it tastes like my review, above, sometimes it's thin, flat, and has little flavor. I have no idea what the problem is."
"D - Overall, this is a porter worth a try for the novelty of it but I felt a bit let down. It was way too carbonated for my taste for a porter.r It was a bit unique with the hint of coconut but it was really barely noticeable. If you can find this easily, give it a try but if you can't then don't really go out of your way to try it."
"I need more!"
"Big ups to olibeer22 for a great bonus beer!"
"Drinkability is fairly high. Flavors are good, and with low alcohol it's definitely sessionable."
"This is a fine porter. I wanted more coconut aroma & taste though. The $8.99 per 4 pack is a bit of a deterent, but I'll gladly buy this again."
"This porter is badass. The coconut is hinted in the aftertaste only if I give it a minute before having another drink of this fine brew. My roommate, who does not have knowledge in beer, asked me what I would rate it from a 1 to 10, and I said that it's easily an 8. This stuff is highly quaffable and easy to recommend if you like porters or robust beers alike. This would be a great session beer, but the price turns me off a little bit as I paid $8.99 for a 4 pack of 12oz. cans. Bring that price down, or give me a six for the same price and it'll be a staple. Cheers!"
"The coconut flavor is there, but I thought there might be a bit more coconut smell."
"Thanks to Dansting for this one. 12oz. can served in a shaker pint glass. Poured a deep brown/black with about a finger of fine bubbled tan head. Very interesting aroma toasted coconut. Chocolate comes out also as it warms. Lots of roasted malt flavor and some chocolate sweetness. Coconut comes out in th finish. There is also some hop bitterness in the middle. A unique flavor combination that really works."
"D: Delicious, I want another! There are some interesting problems with that though. This is only available in Hawaii and I don't frequently want such a full-bodied beer in warm weather. This beer is worth it though."
"D - Good brew. Excellent complexity, but not overwhelming. Light enough to drink on a hot day and sessionable ABV makes it easy to have several. Would pick more up in the future if given the chance."
"D- This one is very drinkable. I could sip on these all day. I really want to try this one on tap though because the mettalic tinge is bugging me."
"A very good beer none the less and i will drink many more of thease but I just wish it had a little more coconut character (creamyness and flavour) which is why im experementing with homebrew..."
"Poured from the can into a shaker pint. Thanks to coreyrhoads for the trade!! Pours a dark brown, blak with a thin tan head. Smells of roasted malts followed up by a hint of coconut and some wood-like aroma. Flavor is definitely unique. I get a sharp crisp bite, not like most porters and then it sort of fizzles out with a hint of coconut flavor on the tail end. I am loving the whole canned thing, but I think I get a bit of aluminum typo flavor in the taste. I could just be dreaming it, though. Beer fizzles in my mouth. Pretty good drinkablilty, definitely something I will try again."
"If given this beer blind I would never have guessed I was getting a coconut flavored brew, having said that, I can see how it influences the flavor profile, but one could do the same thing by manipulating standards beer ingredients (with perhaps some toasted oak note thrown in). None of that keeps this from being quite a tasty tipple though. I really like the mouthfeel of this beer; soft and creamy yet still quite quaffable."
"D - A little sweet and I couldn't have too many but this is a nice beer ."
"This might be the first session porter I have had, but the coconut might catch up to you even though it seems fairly balanced. I haven't gone past 2 yet..."
"Goes down way easy...easy to savor...easy to guzzle...It's up to you!"
"Drinkability: This is a very good beer. I'm not a big fan coconut, but it works well in this porter."
"Poured from 12oz can purchased at O'side BevMo. Poured into schlitz pint glass, poured a black coffee with light tan head. Smell is dominated by roasted scents of barley, coffee, coconut and a little chocolate scent. Taste is pretty similar with a coffee bitterness and a very faint coconut chocolate flavor. Mouthfeel is full body with a lively carbonation level. An exceptional porter on all levels and cant wait till its available in a constant supply."
"I like it, even if porter isn't one of my favorite styles..."
"Big props to Michelle.. She is a BA, she just doesn't know it. I will intervene at some point. :)"
"An outstanding and unique Porter. Highly recommended."
"D: A tasty porter from Maui, a dark beer that gives you a tropical feel is something I like, nice to see more canned microbrews. A tasty porter that I think is worthy of its hype."
"Thought I was going to have to wait until I went to Maui in August to try this one and was shocked to see it at my local spot, worth all the hype I have heard, pretty much what I was expecting, will be drinking this a lot more in the future, especially if it is readily available in my area, highly recommended"
"This one is a little thin but well carbonated and easy to drink. It is very good, but i do not know if i would travel to hawaii to get it. Course, if i was there I would certainly drink alot of them and bring home more!"
"Poured from it's unique can it is coal black with a wonderful cream 2in head, finally settling with 1/4in cap. This has a wonderful smell most notably of CoConut and rich notes of chocolate. Rich malts and roasted tones are profound. I also got a small piece of coconut floating on top of the cap (not sure if that is intentional, but it was definitely coconut). The flavor is very thick with chocolate and rich roasted nuts. There is not as prevalent a flavor of coconut, but there is subtle hints (which in my opinion is better). I was not expecting much from this brew, but was very impressed. I truly wish I had a six or twelve pack of this...according to my brother-in-law whom purchased this in Hawaii for me, you can only get this on the islands? Oh well, a reason to go visit!"
"I didn't know if I would like this or not, but it's damn good. Even for one who is not big on coconut, I would definitely enjoy this one anytime."
"D: We could drink this all damn day! Seriously. This is that friggin' good!"
"HUGE thanks to fordest for this one. I was lucky to find somebody with one, and he came through big with his final one for me! Black pour, with a nicely lasting attractive brown head. Smell is a delicious sweet roasty creaminess at first reminding me of a good oatmeal stout. As it opens I think I can detect a tiny hint of coconut in the nose, and it comes off just a hint plasticy for a while, but not offensively so. Taste...Exceptionally smooth, creamy, slightly sweet and roasted with a noticeable, and perfectly highlighted toasted coconut flake flavor in the finish. Very nice! Full bodied, slightly thick, flavorful, and all around a very enjoyable beer that I wish I could get more readily... Just what I hoped it'd be, and easily one of my favorites. Worth getting if you have the chance!"
"This beer has a dark brown almost opaque appearance that pours with a small tan head. The aroma of the beer is a mix of chocolate and coffee as well as a few slight tart characteristics. The mouth feel is enjoyable with a smooth finish that complements the chocolate and malt tastes of this fine porter. The drink-ability was another plus of this beer that I hope to stumble upon on many more occasions."
"Pours a nice dark color out of the can and into the glass. There is a pleasantly large, slightly off white, foamy head, which lasts. The smell is a nice mixture of coffee, with slight hints of coconut. A very enjoyable taste, coffee, with a coconut finish. A very nice beer that I would certainly drink again and recommend. Enjoy!"
"Pours a thin black with a one finger light khaki colored head that quickly dies down to a small layer of bubbles. Stickiness is minimal at best. Smell is a perfect combination of coconut and chocolate malt. Smokey barley with a carmelized sweetness in the nose as well. A mild earthy hop aroma makes its presence known. Charred wood flavor up front followed by an artificial coconut milk. Barley and cocoa powder make up the aftertaste. Milky medium bodied texture in the mouth, fits quite well. Soft carbonation coats throughout. There have only been a few porters that I have enjoyed, this one definitely fits in to that category. So glad I had the opportunity to try this one. Thanks again wetherel!"
"Drinkability- Cut down the carbonation and mix the flavors a bit better and you have a winning beer. As is, just ok. Would have again though if in Hawaii as there really isn't much choice."
"Delicate, yet complex. Truly phenomenal. Add some caramelly oxidation from time in my cellar and this beer would be a masterpiece."
"Drinkability. Great! I'd love pairing this with a blackberry sorbet or a tiramisu, though I could drink this anytime, too."
"Poured from an attractively decorated can into a standard pint glass. A thinnish coffee-cream tan head laced the glass for the duration. Very dark brown to black in color, with only a small blood-red orb appearing through the darkness when held up to the Hawaiian sun. Aromas of intense toasted coconut, and milk and dark chocolates. Flavors of leathery hops hit the palate first, followed by mounds of toasted as well as burnt coconut, baker's chocolate, coffee with cream, and hints of black licorice, ending on a slight sour cherry note. What a great concept for a porter. Well done!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sweet up front, robust, and nutty."
"Overall, delicious. Very impressive brew from this impressive brewery. Very, very drinkable. Surprisingly nice for a hot summer day--so fits Hawaii."
"My parents brought me a six pack of Maui Brewing's beers from a recent trip. The beer pours a deep mostly opaque black with a nice brownish head. The aroma is tons of rich sweet chocolate, a damp hoppiness and plenty of coconut. The flavor is very similar, starting off with sweet chocolate, caramel and roasted malts, then drifting into the coconut flavor that lingers in the aftertaste. As I drink the beer the coconut flavor seems to fade a bit in intensity. There is a nice light astringency that goes well with the dark malty flavor."
"Pours black but if you inspect it it's actually a coca cola clear brown liquid.. The head is a medium tan bubbly thing that isn't too impressive. The smell is roasty first and foremost. I can also detect a sweetness, not really sugary but more like a cream sweetness. The taste is pretty roasty. At first you don't get much other than the roast but there is also a sweetness in there to balance it. The coconut that comes through is mostly in the aftertaste, and it's pretty mild. As it warms up the beer becomes really smooth and less roasty. Drinking this beer doesn't really make me think of coconuts, so I wouldn't say that flavor is overpowering. It's just a nice sweeter porter, but less of the chocolate sweet of maybe a Black Butte and more of a dairy sweet."
"Thick and creamy decadent mouthfeel. The coconut melds so perfectly with the porter it's a match made in heavan. Chewy coconut flavors with chocolate undertones and a hint of blackberry. More dark grains just make this a wonderful experience and an easy drinking masterpiece."
"A very creative beer. Well done."
"D: Should have bought more of this because I can see that the 6-pack is going to go very soon. Wonderful beer. I'm glad this is finally making it toward my side of the island."
"I only got a 4 ounce taster of this at the stone 11th anniversary festival so I will do my best. It poured from a can with a dark chocolate color standard of any porter. The cocunut really came through the roasted dark malt in the smell which was a huge plus. It tasted very roasty and nutty and the cocunut was not over powering but just right. It was medium on the mouthfeel, not an extremely viscous porter which was nice on the hot day. Extremely drinkable even for those who may not be in to porters. I definitely want to get my hands on some of this beer."
"Mouthfeel is very silky, like drinking coconut milk with coffee and chocolate. Drinks pretty easy."
"Overall: not sure I found the coconute, but this makes a great coffee porter."
"On another note, Maui Brewing Co. is pioneering what they call the ""Micro-Canning Revolution," denouncing previously held myths about canning premium beer. The revolutionary packaging method would be a total hit in the coastal areas of the US, especially San Diego. There is a growing majority of premium-beer connoisseurs who would like to have a canned option to enjoy beachside or poolside during the summer. I hope more breweries follow this trend in the future. I NEED better beer to drink at the beach!"
"I quite enjoyed this. A unique porter, and one that worked surprisingly well. Highly recommended for at least a try. I suppose the body could be slightly stronger for me to really love this beer, but it's also about par for the style."
"Thanks to Noxious26 for the can!"
"Big time cheers!"
"An interesting beer, but not one that I'd want to drink all the time. The coconut flavour is just too bold. I'd prefer it to be more of a background flavour instead."
"I hope to review a different Maui Brewing beer every night or two, as we plan to re-fill the growler (right now they're serving a DIPA which will probably be next)."
