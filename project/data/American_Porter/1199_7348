Biggest difference I notice outside of taste, was color.  Founders is much darker than the rest.  Maybe it's the closest to a stout, with the highest ABV.

Aroma is roasted malt, bittersweet & Hershey's chocolate & a little creamed coffee. Taste is dark & bittersweet chocolate,  roast with burnt bread undertone, roasted nuts & hints of molasses/toffee, an earthy mustiness, woody vanilla & herbal hops. Smooth, sweet start transitions to a dry, peppery feel in the finish, leaving a spicy, very dry, burnt chocolate & astringently bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied, low carbonation, silky & creamy with a lively finish & tongue numbing aftertaste. A nice brew that in a blind taste-test I would call a stout. I realize there is a narrow set of differences separating the two styles but this is just too rich to be a porter.","mothmanscott","Mar 10, 2015"

A dream of being at a low lit beer meeting my wife for the first time and taking a sip of this beer. I can hear the others chatting.

It was the first time I drank a porter and was really wowed. This is heads and shoulders better than GL Edmund Fitz, in my opinion, it's just got so much more depth to it. If you like porters, this is one of the deepest, most nuanced options available, in my opinion. If you like non-Imperial stouts, this should be right up your alley as well, because this one blurs the lines.","BradenMK","Sep 20, 2014"

It has a dark, dark brown body close to a muddy black and a short-lived but beautiful head the color of a cup of coffee with 1 cream that disappears right before you've been able to fully appreciate it. It's silky smooth, but not thick, and subtly sweet with a killer, sticky and slightly bitter finish and an aftertaste that gently nibbles at your conscience. It's like eating a tiny piece of mildly dark chocolate and no more. It's like a tauntingly gentle kiss on the lips from your high school crush who's also wearing the perfect, creamy  chocolate lip-gloss and (for some reason) holding an open cup of coffee beans and standing in a dewy field. Every time I have one, my eyes pop out like Eddie Valiant ogling Jessica Rabbit then settle back in as the potent but manageable 6.5% ABV washes over.","ob_carr","Sep 14, 2014"

Flavor is a touch smokey as well, wonderfully roasty with some great dark chocolate and coffee and a touch of char, and a nice intrusion of some bitterness from some hops in the finish. A creamy, medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, an absolutely fantastic porter here. Just as good, just different, from my favorite porter, Odell's Cutthroat Porter. Loved it, will absolutely be drinking lots more of this one.","denver10","Jul 23, 2014"

The taste was extraordinary with coffee, dark chocolate, and molasses. The sweetness wasn't overpowering though with a mellow malty finish. Highly refreshing and even though it's summer, I found this beer goes great with bbq or any kind of meat. This was a great beer all around. If you're a fan of the dark stuff, this is a great next try.","WhiteHillsStore","Jun 08, 2014"

Once I returned I was rewarded with aromas of deep dark chocolate, sweet malts and a hint of coffee. The first taste was a deep roast with full chocolate and coffee that end in a subtle bitterness. The Porter was a velvety smooth and sublime beer that is a porter for all porters to be measured. I was impressed with the depth and fullness of the brew and how quickly it disappeared in my glass. The Founders Porter was one of the best porters I have had and an impressive beer for their year round lineup.","brurevu","Jun 02, 2014"

I can discern dark chocolate as well. The taste pretty much goes along with the smell. Roasted coffee predominates initially with a sweeter dark chocolate taste at the end. It was thick and velvety going down. Very slight bitterness at the end. Very good beer.

The nose is deep and rich with roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate, and a pleasant (and unexpected) hop bitterness. The flavor lives up to everything the nose promises. It is incredibly deep and rich and delicious. Bitter coffee gives way to sweet roasted malts to dark smoky chocolate to a finish of bitter hops and roasted goodness. The body coats the palate and lingers with the deliciousness of the ale. This seems much closer to a stout than a porter. I tasted this along side GLBC Edmund Fitzgerald and Bell's porter, overall this one won out. Well done, founder's, very well done.","lochef81","Mar 20, 2014"

A nice roasty nose has me imagining cashews and toffee with hints of figgy goodness. The flavor is subtler smooth cola body faded into a bitter cocoa finish.

The depth of flavors ranged from bitter coffee and dark chocolate to a smoke and wood aged pit fruit..date or fig like.

The nose and taste mimic each other well, burnt espresso beans and chocolate, with some nice hop character as well. The maltiness is more dominant than the hops but they do their work to give some cleanliness to the middle character. A little fruity and bready towards the end, just really good all around.

Nicely bottle conditioned with great carbonation. Aromas of roasted malt weren't as present on nose as it was in the flavor to come. First taste immediately releases coffee notes with a hint of chocolate and a bitterness (maybe from some Black Patent malt) that stays on the back side of the tongue for 15 to 30 seconds. Hop presence is slight but seems to be of the noble variety and contribute to the moderate bitterness. An excellent example of the style and one I will revisit again.

The smell was malts with dark chocolate and coffee upfront and a bit of something roasted. The taste was unsweetened chocolate and roasted coffee. It was deliciously creamy. A hint of the smoke/roast profile shined through. The finish had some dark fruits. It lingered nicely and the creamy texture was the highlight of this beer.","WheelsPSU","Nov 24, 2013"

Light / medium mouthfeel with a light creamy texture. The taste is exceptional and well balanced. The roast is forward, but counter balanced with chocolate and malt. Slight hop presence as it warms. Clean finish of roast with a touch of chocolate and malt sweetness. A slight hop bitterness lingers against the dominate roast. I prefer stouts, but this is outstanding.","tillmac62","Nov 07, 2013"

The main thing I get from the nose is rich sweet caramel malt, with coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and a faint herbal hop presence. A delicious-smelling porter. The taste also has big sweet caramel malt notes but the coffee comes out a lot more and combines with it. It's moderately to highly carbonated to make every flavor note pop, and it finishes dry with a lingering but subtle bitterness from the hops. An exquisite beer!","itsscience","Nov 04, 2013"

This porter has it all...a bit sweet, a bit rich, a bit chocolatey, a bit coffee laden and a lot delicious. It pours smoothly from the tap and settles a little like a Guinness in your pint glass. On the inhale, the sweet and rich aroma gets your palate prepared for a nice sip of an almost a coffee ice cream milk shake-like goodness. This would go nicely with a hefty gourmet burger or even an acid cigar (perhaps the Kub Kuba for good measure?). Highly recommended.","Brouwerij78","Oct 02, 2013"

Thick mouthfeel which reminds me of an Imperial stout. Very slight alcohol bite. The flavors starts of dark chocolate and black coffee . Hints of licorice and more chocolate as it finishes semi dry on the palate. This beer represents an exceptional porter. Please let this warmup to about 50 degrees or so as the chocolate flavors become even more pronounced. A real decadent treat.","FlakyBiscuit","Aug 11, 2013"

Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, roasted malt, coffee, toast, floral, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roasted malt notes with light hop presence; and good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, toast, floral, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Moderate coffee/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, caramel, light pine, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of roasted malt flavors with a light-moderate hop presence; with great robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent porter! Great balance and robustness of flavors; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering as expected.","superspak","Jun 19, 2013"

Aromas of dry roast coffee, chocolate, and a touch of smoke. Slightly earthy, too. Flavors are dry and roasty, with a chocolate-mocha blending, and a creamy chocolate blend at the end of the palate. Dry and slightly creamy in mouth, with a dry, clean finish. Very solid porter.","GarthDanielson","Jun 04, 2013"

The flavour is excellent; plenty of roasted malt notes with a mild fruitiness to round it out. Body is also good - thick and smooth. Overall, a quality brew from Founders. I suspect this bottle is a little past it and I hope to try a fresher example sometime, however it still puts on a good show. Well worth sampling if you have the chance.","jazzyjeff13","May 26, 2013"

4.09,-4,4.25,4,4.25,3.75,4,"overall: A very smoky, hoppy porter, this is another amazing brew from Founders. Did a blind test with Bells Porter and Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald, this one wasn't as smooth as the Edmund, but hands down better than Bells. If you like dark, hoppy beer, you will enjoy this, very drinkable and lots of flavor complexities.","Roman5150","May 12, 2013"

Its a robust, full-flavoured porter that doesn't disappoint in any one department, but it doesn't amaze me in any one department either. Definitely a well-above average porter, but I prefer Black Butte and Eddy Fitz to this as a shelf porter. Definitely worth trying and a potential fridge staple should you prefer this to some of the other shelf porters out there. (4.25)","Stevedore","Mar 31, 2013"

It’s lush and thick on the plate for the abv. Smell isn’t terribly strong, but the taste comes through big. Perfect malt sweetness for the beer.

It has a very American smell. It’s pretty full bodied and soft. It vanishes from the mouth quickly and leaves the tongue a bit scratchy. It has flavors of dark malt, roastiness and maybe chocolate. A sort of lemon peel bitterness and some sort of grass or hay and spice seem to come from the hops. It’s balanced perfectly. It’s bold and delicious.

However, near the middle of the tongue that sweet caramel/toffee hybrid sneaks its way in, and the end is a bit of that earthy hop with a slight boozy tinge that is just distant enough to be pleasant. In terms of carbonation, I would say this is middle-of-the-road; there's a bit of a bite on the front of the tongue but nothing too strong. As this warmed, the very smooth finish gained a bit of an elevated meaning as a nice way to counteract the fierce blast of roasted coffee-ish malts that hits you at first.

The smell is of rich dark chocolate and high quality brown malts with a bit of coffee and a touch of blackstrap molasses. The dark roasted malts are evident in the taste which is reminiscent of coffee, bakers chocolate and a touch of licorice. It's bitter but not astringent, the bitterness seems to be from the malts with a bit of hop bite in there as well but it is definitely secondary to the malt. The body of the beer is medium along with the carbonation which makes it quite smooth and creamy. The finish of the beer is mostly clean with a touch of lingering dark malt character. Overall this is a top notch porter, probably one of the better examples out there actually, if you have the opportunity give it a try I doubt you'll be disappointed.","fank2788","Nov 09, 2012"

The popping of bubbles lasted for nearly five minutes as the head dissappated slowly. The color is BLACK. No ruby hue like I would expect. It smelled of rich cocoa and hints of chocolate but had a bit of a chalky scent. The taste was warm and slightly alcohol tinged. Nice roasted nut or malt flavor but a bit harsher than a lot of Porters. Nothing makes me think this is a Porter and everything tells me it's a stout put in the wrong bottle.","KYGunner","Oct 13, 2012"

It has a very American smell. It's pretty full bodied and soft. It vanishes from the mouth quickly and leaves the tongue a bit scratchy. It has flavors of dark malt, roastiness and maybe chocolate. A sort of lemon peel bitterness and some sort of grass or hay and spice seem to come from the hops. It's balanced perfectly. It's bold and delicious.

There is nothing surprising, but also nothing to really dislike. Its drinkability and low ABV make it a great example of a session porter (if such a thing exists). This is also a great introduction to porters and stouts and could be used as a rubric on which to grade all other stouts and porters.

There is a blend of chocolate in there too and even a hint of what I think tastes like roasted marshmallow. The mouthfeel is a moderate carbonation, but also has a creamy smooth body too.

The head is thick and heavy - slow to subside, mocha in color and leaves nice gobs of sticky lacing on the glass as the beer is consumed. The nose is all roasty malt; coffee, chocolate, caramel and black patent are all present - slightly burnt and acrid smelling. The flavor is much the same with the little bit of caramel(y) sweetness coming through slightly and quickly on the onset, quickly followed by the darker roasted flavors of coffee and chocolate and then finally finishes with the acrid, burnt bitterness that leaves the mouth dry.

This isn't my type of beer to casually drink -- I tend to prefer lighter beers for every day drinking -- but there's no denying its quality. It smells phenomenal, and its taste is one that I feel can surely grow on me as I get older. I don't feel it's as fantastic as the rating suggests, but it's undoubtedly a well made beer.

Mouthfeel is thick and well balanced. Lush chocolate tones, black tea flavors, unfolding into a dark roast coffee taste that progresssively gets more bitter. Tastes just ever so slightly light for a porter though, reminiscent of Bell's Porter that, while both exceptional porters - just slightly lacking. Both are similar Porters though, with Bell's being more smooth and Founder's having somewhat more complex, deeper, and more developed flavors. Excellent porter overall.","srv33","Jun 29, 2012"

4.3,0.9,4,4,4,5,5,"Layers of flavor, starts with bitter black coffee followed by a heap of caramel, burnt sugar, chocolate, toffee, and roasted malt. Finishes dry with earthy, piney, and minty hops. The hops really contrast the malt perfectly, dark flavors followed by bright ones. Incredibly complex, you can't drink all 6 without thinking about every sip. A real beer nerds beer. Just enough carbonation to pull all the flavors along through the sip. Medium body. Only negative I can think of is that the beer thins out a bit on the finish but the lingering flavors make up for this a bit. This review doesnt give the beer justice, i just dont feel like rewriting everything I did before. I hope this gets the flavors across though, awesome beer.","jtierney89","May 24, 2012"

Poured from unstamped bottle to mug the beer pours an oily viscous opaque black with a 1 finger mocha colored head with good retention and lacing throughout. The nose is an impressive blast of rich coffee, cocoa, roast. Terrific. If I didn't know better I'd say this is a stout. More character than any non-imperial porter I've sampled. Awesome. The flavor follows suit with again tons of coffee, roast, cocoa along with a mild bitterness, and hint of caramel and nut. Unbelievably smooth. Creamy. I can't believe how much flavor is packed into this brew, no hint of alcohol but with so much going on I'd think this was a much bigger beer to accommodate the character. Medium bodied. Well carbonated. To say this is a treat is an understatement. New standard for me.","hopfacebrew","Apr 25, 2012"

Smells strongly of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate. Upon first taste I don't understand the reputation this beer carries, So I'm going to let it warm a bit and sample again. The taste was really clean at first, but as it warms, it gains complexity. I notice that the coffee scents don't make a comeback appearance, as the taste hilights the smooth dark chocolate flavor more efectively than the smell. I also get a subtle flavor of floral hops, there is a definite bitterness in the beginning of this beer. Mouthfeel is med-thick, carbonation is light. I'm glad I was able to try this beer as it is a well made porter. Unfortunately it's not in my distro area.

Great roasty flavor on it as well with a bit of a hop sharpness at the finish thanks to the 45 IBUs. The bitterness becomes most present as the flavor tapers off, not a floral/citrus hoppiness but a sharp bitter bite that complements the roast and dark chocolate flavors. Well-rounded and amazingly enjoyable. Wishing I brought a sixer of this back with me as I finished this one all too easily.","elNopalero","Jan 11, 2012"

The pour is thick, dark drown with a thin layer of foam that dissipates to lacing around the edge. The smell is of chocolate and coffee. The taste is of dark, toasted coffee, dark woods, and absolutely no alcohol whatsoever. Smooth, smooth, smooth. Mouthfeel is viscous and foamy in the mouth, especially when swished around the tongue. That is where the real flavors come out. Overall, one of my favorite beers from my favorite brewery. Only have two left of these so I am hoarding them for cold dark snowy days.

4,-6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"It's often a lesson in subtlety that differentiates between a porter and a stout. Founders porter is one that I believe crosses that line into stout territory. It pours nice and dark with slight tan lacing and only minimal carbonation. It smells of burnt umber and dark fruits, and tastes of roasted malts, coffee, sugary plum and raisin and charcoal. The taste is exactly what you expect on the smell with maybe a hint of chocolate tossed in to boot. It drinks easily with some oat additions and is chewy, rich and smooth. Overall, it's a solid effort but in a blind tasting with all of it's depth and flavor, i'd grade this one as a stout.","Aiptasia","Jan 08, 2012"

It's far less hoppy for some reason. Well, Founders Porter picks up the slack on the hoppy + roasty porter style. I take back everything I've ever said about this beer.

Body is full and has a super nice creamy texture with good carbonation. Very well brewed and something I wouldn’t mind having on a regular basis.","Phyl21ca","Dec 09, 2011"

Since it's a Founders brew, I will assume it has a good look with a nice head and good retention. Smell was quite surprising for a porter with lots of carmel and burnt sugar notes. Perhaps a touch of mocca which was a pleasant addition. Great smell overall. Taste followed the nose with the carmel and coffee/mocca thing. Picked up some molasses on the end with just enough hops/bitterness to round it out. Solid. Feel was nice and heavy like a good porter should feel. Not too chewy, but nice and hearty with some decent carbonation. Overall- A very enjoyable porter and good representation of the style. Strong aroma with a thick feel and complex taste. Will be having another at some point in the near future. Very tasty-","TheDinger","Nov 24, 2011"

The initially warm and toasty flavor grows even deeper as the the beer warms towards the end of the glass. Very creamy mouthfeel, almost lacking in carbonation for my taste. The richness is not spoiled by heaviness or syrup like some beers this heavy. An excellent porter. One of my favorite styles, and this is a winner.","MNJR","Nov 09, 2011"

4.45,4.5,4,4,5,4.5,4,"Pours the same color, except with a caramel head. Smells more bitter and even more roasty. Holy lord the taste is robust. Very roasted and sensuous. Much more of a focus on the bitter and dark side than Great Lakes. Alot of bitter black coffee and even more malts that feel hop-like in their bitterness. In spite of that, it has milk stout creaminess and smoothness. The aftertaste is very much full of powdered espresso roast coffee and roasted oats. A chewiness lingers from the malt.","VncentLIFE","Nov 08, 2011"

One immediately tastes the roasted malts, which along with the hops, give this beer an almost rich/bitter start. It fades away revealing some dark fruits, caramel, vanilla, some coffee ground, and finally a blast of cocoa. Very well done.

Aroma - sweet, roasted, with a bit of alcohol and sourness, a little bit of fruit, like prunes or like the sourness you get from very dark chocolate. Taste - classic big American porter - strong, deep, dark, burnt, carmelized flavors up front, with a slight sweetness in the finish. Roasty and a little smoky aftertaste. The bitterness of the hops is mostly overwhelmed by the flavor of the roasted malt, but at 45 IBUs it's present and it's there from start to finish.

I could pour this over vanilla ice cream and be in heaven...Taste follows suit with the smell, roasted malts pave the way for a minimal coffee flavor, dark chocolate, slight bitterness on the end of the sip that blends coffee and hops just right. Very smooth and creamy texture with a mild carb level, hops seem to linger around after each sip. Very earthy-mild hop character that is more pronounced than I have experienced in a porter, but it is pleasant. Biscuity consistency with each sip, malt forward with a heavy roasted presence. Overall, this a good porter, one that I will certainly indulge in again.","jsdunlop","Jul 26, 2011"

Strong coffee smell, a hint of chocolate, roasted barley, and a tiny hint of hops. Very great balance of bitterness from the hops and sweetness from the malts. Leaves a good coffee aftertaste with each drink. Mouthful is a bit thin, but works for the style. Carbonation is a bit on the low side, but doesn't take away from the overall rating of the beer. Overall this porter is top notch in my book.

There is a very slight bitterness and acidity on the palate after each sip. The carbonation level is low which makes for a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good porter from Founders.

Borderline quaff-able. Smooth and crisp, I could drink this as a nightcap or as a dessert beer or with dessert or all at the same time. Wonderfully complex and delicious with a lot going on. Really liked the earthy, woody, smoky flavors that came through that were married beautifully with a mild bitterness that made this exceptionally smooth and drinkable.

4.22,-0.9,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Flavor matches the aroma in both intensity and complexity, as it coats the tongue with nutty chocolate malts, brown sugar, and toasted grains. Earthy hops clinch the finish with a peppery bitterness that lingers after each sip. The carbonation level spritzes up the palate before the medium body thickens on the back end and finishes with a resinous, yet almost dry at times, consistency. Overall, a fantastic porter from Founders. Surprised? Not in the slightest.","wagenvolks","Apr 13, 2011"
4.5,5.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5," The flavor of Founders porter is wonderful with slight burnt malt under a sweet toasted and caramel flavor w/ light coffee tinges and mild hop bitterness. The malt astringency is very light and gives the toasted taste and light pine hop notes a chance to mingle in the subtle biscuit and dark roasted flavors w/ some malted milkball sweetness. The taste has a decent amount of dark cocoa and the finish is semi-sweet. Overall a high quality porter in the American Tradition. I think Founders has executed very well with this fine example -so easy to quaff, yet packed with flavor.","Slatetank","Apr 12, 2011"

Slightly burnt choco maltiness has a firm grip on the taste buds. Hops give a quick sting of bitterness and an earthy flavor in the middle. Roastiness is well flexed and shows its range, from faint, smoky, charred wood to bitter dark chocolate to over-toasted bread.

A bit more acrid/burnt tasting than the aroma suggested with bittersweet dark chocolate, toffee, oatmeal and nut. Subtle bitter dry hops toward the end of the palate with a dry finish. A bit too roasted for my preference with bitterness lingering throughout but still pretty drinkable with a nice lactic creamy flavor mid-palate that gives balance and adds to the mouthfeel.

Has a sort of "imperial stout" smell to it, but without the big roasted coffee and chocolate notes that usually comes from imperials. Similarly, the taste is more imperial stout than it is porter, or even regular stouts. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, more like a traditional porter on the mouthfeel side. Drinkability is high. This beer isn't exactly to style at least from what I've had, but it's absolutely delicious and is similar to many of the great stouts had, but smaller and easier to put down.

Tasteful roastiness,and more slick malts follow. Finish is sweet,with roasty notes, then lingering hop, chocolate, and mocha notes. Little under mid glass this has lost a little body.

The smell off the bat was pretty damn amazing. There was peat smoked malts and roasted malts similar to a strong coffee aroma. The taste was greatly similar to the smell, though the smoke was toned down really nicely felt that there was almost too much roast in the flavor, which is something that I thought I'd never say. There was a good chocolate flavor to tie everything together. The mouthfeel was a tad on the astringent side, but with that much roast it was rather expected. This is insanely easy to drink, I must admit I'm rather fond of this beer and am truly happy that I gave it a second chance.","Vdubb86","Jan 01, 2011"

The smell is malty with a nice roast that stands behind it. Great chocolate notes in there at the end that work well. Tasting at first there is a smooth cocoa flavor finishes roasty and warm. Malt shines through ever flavor. This is smooth and creamy but not too heavy. Pretty drinkable. Founders never disappoints.","jagoffyinzer","Aug 05, 2010"

4.1,-3.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pretty dark pour with a tan head. Aroma of coffee and chocolate malt. Flavor is of roasted malts and chocolate cafe coffee. The very balanced flavor leads to a potent palate -- initially creamy, which morphs into a lively, more interactive experience. It is very dark -- there is a minute hint of dark fruit against the dark chocolate coffee --, and its merit in being so is its exact balance. Smoky with some subtle hops. Very rich, very "sexy".","Shakesbeere","Jul 09, 2010"
4.17,-2.1,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"This beer poured out like motor oil, much darker and thicker than I expected from a porter, more stout-like in character. The color was pitch black, with very little khaki head on the beer. It was not flat, but definitely on the lower end of carbonation, as I was rough to stir up the beer and bring out some aroma. The nose was all burnt malt: coffee, chocolate, roasted barley; and a bit of caramel sweetness. The taste was roasty and bitter like espresso, but clean, without too much fruity esters or sweetness. The porter was dry, but with good body to keep this drinkable.","Soonami","Jul 08, 2010"

Dark chocolate infuses the nose, dusty and slightly chalky. Densely flavorful and aggressively styled porter. Plenty of dark chocolate, figs and other ripe dark fruits, woody/whiskey/smokey chords are also lightly hit. Big and brawn, full flavor porter, good stuff.","Billolick","Jul 07, 2010"

4.8,12.7,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,""Dark, rich, and sexy." Indeed. Our eyes met from across the brewpub. She stood at the bar, all decked out in righteous finery. It was when she peered over her shoulder that her beauty took hold of me: those dark brown, nearly black eyes; those burnt ochre tresses, somehow simultaneously thick and light, that she nonchalantly brushed away from those aforementioned eyes; she certainly appeared nearly perfect. I had to speak to her. As I neared, her perfume caught my nose, sending me further over the edge before we've even met. It was dark, it was roasty, it reminded me of a chocolatier's workshop. Finally, I made it to the pinnacle: I old-fashionedly cleared my throat loudly, springing the trap. I thought she'd bite, but instead she ended up trapping me within those dark eyes, which in turn were reinforced by that rich, creamy skin. I was stunned. Luckily, she took the lead. As we spoke, grew closer, her very essence dove into my senses, recalling and complimenting her perfume. The sweetness, the roast; the chocolate, the molasses, the brown sugar (how come it tastes so good!?), the nutmeg, the coffee, the subtle vanilla. I don't know how I survived the encounter. In fact, she was so rounded, such a complete package, full of energy yet more than willing to slow down and savor the moment, that we talked, nay connected, far after the doors were closed. I had fallen hard. And we've been together ever since. Now, Dean-o, THAT's amore!","TMoney2591","Mar 27, 2010"

Th taste is similar. perfectly balanced roastiness, dry licorice, and a nice dose of spicy hops that complement rather than overwhelm the other flavors. The mouthfeel is substantial, a bit spicy, quite dry, and very satisfying.

It seemed entirely made up of roasted coffee and lacked any chocolate and under tones I almost take for granted in dark beers.

End of the aroma has a bit of citrus hops. Taste is drying bitter chocolate upfront with a nice burnt grain profile throughout the really smooth feel/body. Light feel and low moderate carbination with this porter. Lingering taste of burnt grain and bitter chocolate is left in the mouth that forces you to dive right back in for another sip. Little bit of citrus hop bitterness is hidden behind the bitterness of the burnt grain. The warmth of the alcohol starts to hit you about half way through the glass. Somewhat of a dry finish to this but overall a really good porter.","stakem","Feb 09, 2010"

4.4,3.3,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,5,"A very sexy beer. Pours pitch black with a nice two finger dark tan head (perfect color for a porter) that is nice and creamy and leaves me very thick lacing behind. A ring is left after the head dies down, the retention being the only lost points on the appearance. Smells like a good candy to me. There is a very nice cocoa aspect that blends beautifully with a roast malt backbone in the aroma. Earthy hops weave their way into the scent to add a nice balance to the roast. The great strength of the aroma allows me to sniff this one for a very extended period of time. There is also a touch of vanilla which finishes off this great aroma. The taste is similar to the nose. Huge roasted malts are the dominant flavor for me along with some cocoa and smokiness. There are definitely a good amount of roasted malts in this recipe, chocolate malt specifically. I get a smoky flavor but this is probably from something like black patent type malt. The vanilla is lost in the taste for me and the hops take a bigger step forward. The flavor does not come together as well as the aroma but is still a good example of the Porter. Mouthfeel consists of a nice medium body with lower carbonation than many beers. I prefer this low carbonation with such a rich flavor. Earthy hops and roast malts stay on the tongue long after the beer is swallowed. No alcohol or warming in this ale at all. I might want this to be a tiny bit thicker to get the perfect rating. Drinkability is very nice, I could session the crap out of this and the price is not bad. I will buy this one to session if it continues to come to my area.","cbutova","Jan 14, 2010"

Mouthfeel is very good, nice and velvety, perfect for a porter. Another solid offering from Founders, great for the price, I will be finishing this 6-pack pretty quickly I'm sure.

The aroma is what all American Porters should strive for. Cocoa, coffee, dark malt, a touch of smoke, and an American twist, some citrus hops. The flavor is likewise impressive. A lot of malt flavor and smoke with just a touch of citrus. The hops never overcome the malt but it is noted. Bitterness is also fairly high. The body is robust and filling.

Is it possible to liquify charcoal briquettes? If so, it looks like this porter pours. Not only is is truly black, even when held to the light, it seems to intimidate the rest of the illumination in the room. I think my screen just dimmed a bit. A rich mocha head crowns the glass. Aroma is redolent of roast, dry cocoa, hints of hazelnut, kahlua, earthy hops and a faint, faint hint of alcohol. Yeah, this is going to get good. Flavors mirror what the nostrils anticipated with coating dark malts, whisps of smoke, deep bittersweet chocolate, black coffee and simple deliciousness.

Pretty low ABV at 6.5% making this one very drinkable. Like most porters I could do these almost all night. Drinkable and pretty good tasting. I don't know where this one ranks amongst the porters I've had but I'd say it's up there. Probably not the best but definitetly not bad at all.

When it first hits the palate it's very smooth with almost no taste. Then as it starts to sink in there's a lovely blend of smooth, rich chocolate, along with a pleasantly bitter roasty flavor and the coffee/espresso taste starts to come in a few moments after swallowing.

Lots of roasted malt, ample chocolate, and an overall smores like quality. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with light carbonation, and a velvety texture.

Then comes a wave of coco that is creamy and really oat based for super balance. Just enough bitterness on the end of the palate.

4.16,-2.3,3,4.5,4.5,3,4,"Pours out dark, dark brown - about as black as a porter can get, with a thin brown head, with loose bubbles that disappear kind of quickly, leaving very little lacing. Looks average, but I'm very interested. The smell is what's really nice about this. A bit of a battle between dryness and sweetness in the smell. There's a dry, estery smell - reminds me of dark fruits, plums, cherries, and then there's the caramelly, malty sweetness. I also get light whiffs of the dark roasted malts, with some coffee, roast barley, a bit of dark chocolate. The taste continues on from where the smell left off. This was a bit more estery than I expected initially. There's a kind of cola flavor in it, with some bready malts, some background sweetness, and a sort of dry roasted flavor up front, like a dark chocolate bar. Great character and complexity in the taste here. The only thing I'd want out of this one is a bit more sweetness, it would fill it out, and really kick it along - but it's really pretty good the way it is now. The mouthfeel is nice, but I'd say its about average. Not incredibly full, but not really flat and weak. There's not a whole lot of carbonation (which I would expect to enhance the full-feeling body). But I'd say this just about normal. The drinkability is good. A little high on the ABV side for a really easy drinking porter. But all of the qualities of this make it pretty enjoyable, especially with a good, hearty meal. I'd recommend it as a solid example of a porter.","taylorhamrick","May 21, 2009"

Nice malt character, lots of layer to the flavor, good balance is achieved through out the bright carbonation allows the hops and bitter chocolate notes to shine through.

When I visited The Liquor Stop in Highland, IN on a recent roadtrip, I had the opportunity to purchase several Founder's brews -- Breakfast Stout, Double Trouble, etc. -- but I was glad I purchased the Founder's Porter because it's a wonderful concoction.

The initial flavors are of coffee and malts with slight chocolate. The chocolate flavor is more present on the finish, as well as a bit of a bitter finish from hops. The body was light to medium bodied with slight creaminess on the tongue. The Founder's Porter is beyond reminiscent of their Breakfast Stout, which is by and far one of my favorite beers.

Nice full body affirms that this one is going to give you plenty to chew on. Nice mix of flavors makes this an excellent brew.

Quarter inch, loose head quickly dissipated into a soapy skim with a bubbly band around the bowl. Some webs of lacing adhered during the tasting. Nose was predominantly chocolate malt with an indication of the hops bittering to be revealed in the mouth, but somewhat subdued for the most part. Taste consistent with nose, but chocolate really comes out, and a roasty character is also revealed. Also detected a creamy/lactose-like flavor towards the finish. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied, lively and a little prickly, but a creaminess comes out towards the finish. Outstanding - extremely flavorful porter with a low abv; if the mouthfeel was a little less prickly, it would really enhance the experience. A top notch porter nonetheless.","Jwale73","Feb 01, 2009"

Big time roast to the nose, caramelized dark chocolate, cocoa bean slather the grape, raisin, date fruit scents, mixes in grilled nuts and oatmeal, very difficult to tease out any scent evocative of hops. Medium-bodied, quite firm and would be more so were it not for the in-your-face carbonation which continually churns things up. The toasty, roasty chocolate, cocoa, mocha still in effect, here there's a fried fresh butter element as well. The nuttiness more penetrating while the grape, cherry, fig flavors pull back a notch. Drying texture may be the reason for difference, tactile trumps the olfactory. The finish needs more of an exclamation point, not clean per se but has lifted off the palate by then.","farrago","Jan 22, 2009"

This is a black beer, no highlights, no appreciable edges. 1/2 inch brown cap of fine bubbles, good head retention, spotty lacing. The dark grains in the nose really hit you head on, a combination of roast and burnt with chocolate and malt further back. A bit nutty, some coffee. Really nice. Moderate hop bitterness, definitely some hop flavour up front, grassy and leafy, but the dark malts take over here too. More dark chocolate, milder roast than in the aroma, licorice, sour cherry and malted milk finish. The carbonation was creamy, very fine bubbles. Quite a full bodied porter.

Smell is very nice, with cool dark malts that give off impressions of milk chocolate and fresh cream. Taste has more of the same, with a hint of butterscotch underneath. Mouthfeel is bigger and bolder than most Porters; very slick body that goes down very easily. They were right on their label when they said this beer was dark and sexy.

3.87,-9.2,3.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,"Not bad at all, but quite different than I'm used to. Definitely seek it out if you're a lover of porters like I am. Or even if you can appreciate all beers from a great brewery like Founders. Not a bad choice.","jmalex","Jan 03, 2009"
4.35,2.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beer has a full body. The carbonation is low but proper to the beer. This is a dam fine porter. It verges on being stoutish in my own mind. The beer was an easy drinker. Founders yet again brews a fantastic beer drinking experience.","nlmartin","Jan 02, 2009"
4.85,13.8,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"I love this beer. Maybe closer to a stout than a porter, but damn is this beer delicious. Whatever category this is in, it is in a class of its own. Easily the best drining porter I have had. A bit pricey at over $11 for a six, so this cant be a standard offering in my house, but this was an really good beer.","SaCkErZ9","Jan 02, 2009"
4.35,2.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The abv said 6.5% on the bottle I had. Nearly black pour with a dark cream almost brown head. Much darker head than the usual porter. Roasty chocolate/caramel nose. Roasted peaty flavor of the standard porter, with much more chocolate and a slight hint of coffee. Creamy carbonation, a solid medium body and rather drinkable. An excellent porter for sure. Not sure why they don't distribute this one more widely.","Bung","Dec 31, 2008"
4.05,-4.9,4,4,4,4.5,4,"I do wish though that the beer was a bit more complex, had a bit more of and underscored flavor profile. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy this beer and am looking forward to the rest of the sixer and at 8bucks it is one of the cheaper ones I've picked up recently. You could do far far worse than this beer. I would say you could also probably use this beer as a gateway for those that want to try rachbiers but are affraid of commiting to an entire bottle without knowing what they are getting into.","bluemoonswoon","Dec 30, 2008"
4.25,-0.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Picked up a single bottle at the Beer Stop for $2. Poured into my Lancaster shaker glass a rather dark brown color with a healthy finger of caramel colored head. Aromas and flavors of roasted malts and coffee, bitter chocolate, somewhat nutty and a touch of molasses. Body is much more full than most porters and, in this case, it works wonderfully with medium carbonation. Very tasty stuff especially on a cold night like tonight. Really hits the spot when you are not in the mood for a huge RIS. I'll be back for a sixer. Pick some of this up if you can.","ClockworkOrange","Dec 30, 2008"

The beer looks spectacular, dark brown with a milk chocolate colored foam, tons of tan lacing on the glass. The smell is malty with lots of chocolate, really good. The taste is roasted malt, less chocolate than in the aroma but still there, hardly any bitterness in the aftertaste. Really thick body, more than I usually see in porters, this crosses the line to stout or double stout. Really good, Founders is just a solid choice for any style you care to get.","TurdFurgison","Dec 23, 2008"

3.97,-6.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a dark brown color, way too much carbonation, nice two-finger head when it settles down after about 10 mins or so (I do not like this), does leave some sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, with some toffee/coffee notes. The taste is also malty, with toffee/coffee notes, there is a nice velvety texture to this brew. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a tasty brew, but because of the huge head and settling there of, I brought the score down.","Wasatch","Jul 13, 2008"

4.3,0.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Dark porter brown body. Light cannot penetrate. Finger of thick, light brown head. Robust roasted malt aromas, light chocolate, and pine/citrus hop bitterness on the nose. A bit like a jacked-up SN porter might be like. Big roasted malt flavors up front. Deliciously appetizing roastiness gives way to smooth, sweet chocolate and woody, peaty flavors. Hop bitterness dominates the finish. Good balance. Medium-full body with a creamy feel. One of the better porters I've had in a while!","alexgash","Jan 13, 2007"

This brew was thick and rich with flavor and a small burnt aftertaste. I enjoyed every sip of this one, a great porter with all the right notes and characteristics that I enjoy. The mouthfeel was good, a great balance of all the flavors and carbonation, it was a perfect pour. I could drink these any time, very good beer. Cheers!","wingman14","Jun 17, 2006"
4,-6.1,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Tastes of cassis, mochiato, big roasted choclate and caramel malts, hint of vanilla bean, nice smooth chewy hops.

Smells of mocha, slight roast coffee. Taste is a rich, roasty flavor with a moderate amount of bitterness. Coffe-like in the finish, which was just a bit harsh. Mouthfeel was very creamy, medium body with low carbonation. Something about the creamy feel did not sit well with me. Overall, a decent porter, with some good characteristics.","Bierguy5","Sep 23, 2004"

4.13,-3.1,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4" of dark brown head over opaque dark, dark brown/black brew. Lacing is good. Aroma is full of deep dark malts, coffee and chocolate stand out, with even some nuttiness apparent. Taste is storngly of the dark malts, esp coffee, but a somewhat fruity flavor enters the middle of the mix as well. Adds to the interest, I guess. Mouthfeel good, oh so smooth, and drinkability is excellent. Wow, have to keep my eyes out for this, maybe it'll make the limited Founders selection that recently started becoming available in MA.","ppoitras","Aug 19, 2004"
3.23,-24.2,3.5,3,3,4,3.5,"Seems a bit one dimensional to me. Lots of bitterness, not unpleasant, just boring. Coffee and burt malt flavors overpower it and cover up everything else. Very slight chocolate flavor sneaks in, buit it's too little too late. Nice looking opaque black body with a thin, fast fading tan head. Medium mouthfeel.","Sixpack595","Aug 17, 2004"
3,-29.6,3,3,3,3,3,"Deep dark brown, almost black with a creamy medium brown head. Aromas of chocolate malt and mocha, with a mild alcohol sweetness. Lots of roasted malts balance a slight sourness. Not as smooth as I expected. Mouthfeel is coating, but not too heavy. Slightly sour finish. Overall, a solid beer. Would like to see a little more roundness and less of the sour/acidic flavors.

4.07,-4.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep black color with one finger of dark tan head. There is just a touch of lacing left on the glass. The smell is full of burnt malt, coffee, caramel, and molasses. A nice strong smell. The taste starts with espresso and roasted malt, some sweetness like caramel and toffee. Only a hint of hops on a slightly dry finish. The mouthfeel is just a little light for the style. The drinkability is good though. A nice solid porter.","SheepNutz","May 23, 2004"
3.86,-9.4,5,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours beautifully, flat opaque black with a thick chocolate milk-colored head that dissipated but not too quickly. Nice thick lacing too. The aroma is strong coffee and roasted malt. Medium-bodied, and unfortunately the flavor is not as robust as the look and smell. Bitter coffee and burnt malt flavors dominate, but the balance is a little too much on the bitter side. The finish is fairly bitter with coffee and some chocolate. Overall a pretty good Porter, it just needs better balance.","Dogbrick","May 13, 2004"
3.47,-18.5,3.5,4,3.5,3,3,"Pours a dense, dark dark brown with a modest tan head that disappears before you have a seat. Smells absolutely delicious: roasted barley, roasted nuts, and milk chocolate. Mouthfeel errs a little on the nearly syrupy smoothness. Tastes exactly like it smells, with the addition of mocha java or some cocoa-coffee blend and malt with a bit of a burnt edge to it. Most interesting aspect of this porter is a consistent bitter silhouette that accompanies the rich flavors from start to finish. Perhaps if the carbonation was elevated and the body reduced, this beer would be even better.","marcellaproust","Apr 28, 2004"
4.15,-2.6,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Thanks to trbeer for this beer as part of BIF 4.0. Another solid porter, mixing the coffee bitter and chocolate sweet natures of porter quite nicely. Quite good, and I'd have one again.","beergeek279","Mar 28, 2004"
3.7,-13.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"The nose is malty with a good portion of coffee to add interest. In the flavor we also get a few choclate notes that liven the overall experience.

3.95,-7.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"This beer poured as black as the night and formed a nice dark tan foamy head that left cirular lace as it subsided. An aroma of malt, chocolate and coffee are present, with an emphasis on the coffee, but not thwarting the chocolate aroma. It had a flavor of malt, coffee and chocolate, with more of a chocolate note in the finish. The body was fairly light and the finish was bitterswett like a bittersweet chocolate. Not a bad porter, but with the over the top ones lately, I think it suffers. As a standard example of style, I think it is fine.","Wildman","Mar 10, 2004"

The aroma gave me little and the taste didn't knock me back either. It seemed well balanced with a chocolate flavor at the beginning, a creamy texture in the middle, and a little hoppiness in the finish. Good but nothing spectacular.
