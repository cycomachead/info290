Smooth mouthfeel and incredible smokey taste. I'm somewhat biased as I am partial to smoked porters, but this one is hands down the best I've ever had. Beautifully balanced, it's a wonderful evening treat.","Grant_Satterthwaite","Mar 24, 2015"

3.9,-6.3,4.5,3.75,3.75,4.25,4,"2014  version. First pour: bomber into a tulip glass. Second pour: into a pilsener glass to try to see more (color, carbonation). Pours very dark, almost opaque black. 1.5 in thick tan head that retains nicely. Leaves thick, clinging lace as it receded. (This pilsener pour had a much larger head, that collapsed with a very nice visual effect from the bottom up.  Also, if I backlit the pilsener, I could see a very dark red color behind the front-lit black.) Smokey aroma, as expected from the name, with a faint meaty bacon or ham note. A bit of a boozy smell, even though it is only 6.5%. Pleasant aroma, but not the traditional beer-like. Smokey flavor on initial taste, with a mild bitterness lasting into the aftertaste. Thick, creamy mouth feel. Almost no carbonation visible in the tulip or in the feel.  The smoky bacon is there in the taste, but the smokiness is more subtle than I was expecting. With backlighting in the pilsener, I was able to observe light carbonation. The malt backbone of this beer is well represented, but still, the overriding taste is smoky and somewhat bitter. I would have expected more of a malt-forward taste for a porter, but I do like the taste nonetheless. I have two other bottles that my intention is to drink one per year and see how it ages. I'm looking forward to see how this very good beer changes with age.","MNAle","Feb 22, 2015"

4.17,0.2,4.25,4,4.25,4,4.25,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and i thought it was a very nice example of the style, it had just about everything that I look for in the style and while it was pretty heavy on the smoke it never became too much for me to handle and it still retained some nice drinkability, it was smooth, fairly crisp, a little creamy, just a little dry on the finish, not too filling and the taste did a nice job of holding my attention, one glass is a good amount for me, but if it was just me I think I could take out the whole bomber without it starting to wear on me and I think it makes for a good Winter seasonal.  What I like the most about this beer was how true to style it was, it was just what i expect from the style and no aspect seemed out of place.  What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I disliked or would change.  I would buy this beer again, especially if I'm in the mood for a smoked dark beer and i would recommend it to anyone who likes the style, if you like Smoked beers this is pretty much a must try.  All in all I was happy with this beer and just a little impressive, I see why this is one of the most popular American Smoked beers, it just does a good job of delivering the smoke with a nice Porter showing up in the background.  So far this is my new favorite beer From this brewery and i think it's one of the best Smoked Porters I've had.  Good job guys, this was one tasty Smoked Porter, keep up the hard work.","StoutHunter","Nov 27, 2014"

It pours with a black color and a thin, fizzy, light brown head. The aroma lets you know that it is a solid porter at its base, as there is a dark, roasty, bready sweetness, and the smoke adds a wonderful complexity rather than masking everything else. The flavor is so wonderfully meaty, with the smoked malts being much more assertive, although the smoke still doesn't overpower the sweet and roasty characteristics of the porter. Medium bodied and having a light carbonation, the texture supports the flavors nicely. Overall, I'm a fan of smoked beers and I'm a fan of porters, and this blends the two well.","devilben02","May 28, 2014"

Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, light coffee, light char, smoke, toast, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roasted/dark/smoked malt notes with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, light coffee, dark bread, light char, smoke, and roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, light coffee, dark bread, toast, smoke, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of dark/roast/smoked malt flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic smoked porter. All around awesome balance, complexity, and robustness of roasted, dark, and smoked malt flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 19, 2013"

That said, there was an initial blast of smoke (more like charcoal), but several minutes later I'm picking a lot of vanilla (from oak mabye?)

Served from bottle into a Crooked Stave ‘Crooked Line’ tulip. Poured dark brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, smoke, roasted malt, bread, and smoked meat. The flavor was of sweet malt, smoke, smoked meat, bread, and wood. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. This is probably one of the older smoked porters that I have had to date, so I was happy to see the smokiness sticking around. However, I have a feeling it might have lost a bit of its edge. All of the right flavors for the style were there, but they just didn’t seem to mix together as well as I would have liked. The aroma was still quite nice though which was definitely welcomed. Worth trying if you get the chance, but I would likely shoot for fresher if you have the option.","thagr81us","Nov 21, 2012"

Smoke is mild on the nose with the roasted malts and coffee notes coming through more predominantly. The smoke is very easy on the palate as well. A good malt/hop balance and a touch of bitter coffee and dark chocolate to boot. I'd like the feel to be a bit thicker as opposed to the thin & bubbly feel I got, but on the whole I think it's quite a good beer. The smoked varieties aren't for everyone, but porters have proven to be very good when smoked and I think plenty of folks might find this or Stone's worth trying.","TheRealBigC","Aug 14, 2012"

Flavor is roasted malt, chocolate, faint dark fruit and hops, all overlaid with wood smoke, but very nicely done. A very nice smoky porter, and one that is commonly available in stores without much in the way of good craft beer; a bottle of this has saved me on trips with access only to boring chain store beer.","LiquidAmber","Aug 07, 2012"

For the taste, I note black licorice, more of the smokiness, roasted malts, a small amount of chocolate as well. Mouthfeel is pushing towards heavy with a medium carbonation level. All in all, a damn fine porter/smoked porter. The smoke is not for everyone though, some friends and spouses may be scared off.","mltobin","Jul 14, 2012"

4.05,-2.6,4,4,4,4.5,4,"2002 Alaskan Smoked Porter - Poured into a Duvel glass. Nice head from an agressive pour, pours dark brown with a medium tan head. Light smoke and char on the nose. Much of the smoke has faded from this thing - just a touch on the finish - this thing is nice, smooth, round, with a lot of balance. No signs of oxidation and the mouthfeel is creamy with a slight bit of sweetness. This thing has really held up. I picked this on up a few months back after an Alaskan event where the brewery brought bottles from their cellar, signed by the brewers. I suspect this one has been well cared for since bottling. This is a great cellar experiment and has definately held up - would definately try again if I found one that had proper cellaring.","plumcrazyfx","Jun 10, 2012"

Taste again has these wood-smoked malts at the forefront, with light burnt bread and bitter chocolate notes only in the periphery. A little thin in feel, but taste certainly makes up for it - smokiness is there on the palate and well into the finish. Drying, with minimal (if any) sweetness to contrast.

The nose consists of a strong roasted barley, cocoa, and smoke. Towards the end of the glass the nose becomes less smokey and more chocolatey in character. The flavor begins with a strong smoke character followed by the chocolate, roasted barely. Hints of fig, raisin, and even oak. Mild bitterness. The smoke begins to dominate the palette as the beer warms and finishes. Medium bodied and medium/light carbonation. Smokey. Overall, the smoke dominates.

The flavor is very similar but the smoke is nowhere near as prominent as in other smoked porters I have had (this is a good thing) the smokiness is followed by a little bit of roast. The mouthfeel is fairly dry and moderate carbonation. Overall a good beer and I would love to make me some chili with this beer.","rowingbrewer","Dec 15, 2011"

Taste is crazy dry burnt coffee, over cooked bacon, and over done hot cocoa, but in the most complex way. How is it so enjoyable, because I for some reason can't wait for the next sip. Body is perfect for the ABV, with plenty of carbonation and drinkable. This is a beer that I have been wondering about the hype and I understand it now.

4.26,2.4,3,4.5,4.5,3,4.5,"The brew pours a cola-brown hue and is capped with a very short-lived tan fizzy head. Lets get the smoke element out of the way first: Initially smoke is apparent in both the aroma and flavor; it immediately subsides to mere nuance on the palate, with the olfactory tuning it down shortly thereafter. The smoke contribution is in the range of smoked salmon, and is fairly mild as smoke intonation goes; it is not brutal like, say, hickory or campfire smoke, it has more of a soft subtlety. The flavor shows quite a bit of luscious dark fruity character along with a chocolate impression that strengthens on the finish. The nose suggests dry woody notes, port-like oxidation, soy sauce, and tanned leather, with some of the leather showing up on the palate as well. The feel is just too thin; it does not make for a bad mouthfeel, but it is far from the potential heights of enhancement that I envisage. Overall, it is still one of the more impressive handlings of the smoked element that I've encountered in a beer.","ktrillionaire","Jul 16, 2011"

4.18,0.5,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Alaskan Porter pours a solid black, not even a hint of brown at the edges. It seems less intimidating than a big stout though. There's an easy four fingers of light caramel head on the beer, splitting my glass in two. Retention is very good, amd thick rings of lacing are left circling the glass. The nose is good, but a little bit too much smoke and not enough porter for my taste. There's some espresso notes for sure, but smoke is easily the star of the show. The malty base beer shows up more in the flavor, coffee and chocolate notes abound to open the beer. The smoky quality slowly creeps into the picture, like an oncoming fog, until there's nothing left but a pleasantly smoky finish. While the carbonation is nicely understated, the body could stand to be a bit more full/rich for such a malty beer. Alaskan Smoked Porter takes a tasty base brew and adds just the right amount of smoke to change it into something new and unique without overpowering the beer.","axeman9182","Jun 12, 2011"

The aroma is of big smoke, like being at a bonfire, there is also a hint of coffee and maybe a subtle dark chocolate there. The taste again is big smoke, the taste again is like a campfire but then it is balanced out by a chocolate and cofee taste. There is a little more to this beer, a nice balance with being true to what it is. The mouthfeel is creamy and lightly carbonated. Overall it is a solid beer, it isn't just all smoke with no substance underneath it. Well worth a try.","goblue3509","Jun 06, 2011"

Taste is similar with smoked malts in the front followed by subdued coffee and slight cocoa powder flavors. There is a woody essence that lingers in the mouth after each sip. Mouthfeel is a bit disappointing. Very low carbonation leaves the beer very thick to drink easily. Overall, this is a great porter with a great smoky taste.

The bitterness from the smoke and the roasted malts on a dry finish would have ruined this beer for me...I think. Some rauch / smoke beers do finish this way and it's suffocating.

Black liquid, still also comes across as very clean and without any haze at all, you gets some metallic reddish-orange at the glass bottom and rims. ""Smoked"" is absolutely truth-in-advertising, the smoke is deep, broad and energetic, brings out a woodsy side as well as dried herbs, coffee bean, cocoa, anise, there's some caramel in there but sweetness is not a main goal here, more orange zest than any cherry or berry fruit, as you adjust the smoke seems to even bring out meat fat or beef jerky notes. Medium-bodied with a super-firm mouth presence, glues itself in place. This achieved even as the carbonation brings muscular kick and scrubbing action. The smoke doesn't have the same complexity here, the trade-off might be that the tongue can register the sweetness in the plum, cherry flavors. Coffee bean, mocha powder, bittersweet nibs, some vanilla bean too. Its earthy side comes out more here, herbal matter helps add to overall balance, mineral water too. As you'd expect, the smoke still outlasts the other flavors.","farrago","Feb 10, 2011"

Looks like an average porter, and when smelled all i got was the smoky namesake. However, the taste was something else. Not as intense as a real Schwarzbier makes this far more drinkable and suitable for food. Even alone this beer stands up to a lot of porters and stouts i have tried. There is a real depth of character that opens up as it warms especially when paired with something meaty. I liked the coffee notes at the end, but was glad they weren't overpowering.

4.55,9.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"2009 vintage, about a year old, sideways label. Sampling right after the '10 version to compare. Pours much the same, impressive head, deep brown, see above. Aroma however instantly jumps out as being different. Less of a straight forward roasted malt, although that is present, and more of a nice mellow fruityness developing. Added complexities in the flavor profile as well. Really, really nice. Age is good. Nice mellow sweetness, fruity, raisin; reminds of darker ales from Belgium. Smoke and wood in the finish, perhaps a bit more pronounced. Maintains a voluptious and soft mouthfeel without being too thick, and perhaps a bit chewier a year later. Essentially, every area of this beer has improved age - I can't wait to try some more vintages next year.","twelvsies","Oct 24, 2010"

4.33,4.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Have had this sample of the 2006 vintage ASP in my possession for over 3 years now... For at least the past 2.5 years, it has been in the fridge, but before that was being kept at above cellar temps, as high as 85oF but usually in the mid-70s for say, 4-6 months. Major demerits for me. Pours just shy of pitch black in my snifter and is topped by a permanent creamy brown head that fades somewhat but always retains a cover and very thick, clingy, just-a-bit-too-wet-and-thick-to-properly-lace collar (it sort of melts down the side of the glass as the beer is consumed.) Big, sweet, rich, robust notes of leather, dark fruit, carob, coffee-soaked bubblegum, Jolt cola, with all of these wrapped in a sturdy blanket of smoke and campfire goodness. Some meaty, salty notes as well. Condensed maple syrup. The faintest tang of citrus struggles to escape, but is coated in the heavy tar and treacle notes that anchor this beer as close to the earth as possible. The beer is much less intense on the palate than I expected based on the nose; the nose is heavy, almost overbearing, thick and virtually like liquid in the nostrils--you feel it filling your nose, like drowning. But the flavor, while big and rich, is not nearly as heavy or imposing as I thought it would be. All the hallmarks of a robust porter, with subtle spikes of cola, leather, maduro cigar/tobacco, black cherries, and a clean woodsy note, distinct from the also present smokiness. Fresh balsa. Burning sea driftwood (think salty smoke.) The finish is gentle and kind--a comforting level of smoke that sits so well in the mix of this very tasty beer. Never gets to coffee in the flavor, despite what one might expect for the style. Instead, it's bark and billows. As it warms, the alcohol speaks up a bit on the nose, sharpening some of the acridity and coaxing out the edginess of the citrus hop notes, and on the palate evoking notes of dark rum. I am not disappointed by this beer--let me be clear. But it is not as complex as I expected. Sort of the hype syndrome--where you hear or read how great a movie (or beer) is and then when you see (drink) it, you can't be completely objective and rate it lower than if you'd just waltzed into the theater (or bar) not knowing what to expect. Can't help but think that if I just stumbled across this without knowing from day one (and every day since, as it's been in my possession for over 3 years--calling to me as I fought temptation) that it was the holy grail of smoked porters, that I'd have flipped shit over how awesome it was. Instead I enjoy it as a great beer that is pleasing, but is not rousing my inherent beer geek fanaticism. This is not a proclamation of overratedness. Far from it. This is great beer that I'm pleased to have had the opportunity to try. Thanks to Jabocu for the trade/sample (all those years ago!)","AdvocateFan","Jan 21, 2010"

If not, let it age a while or drink it pretty warm. Some complexity comes through as it warms. A 22 ounce bottle seems about right for this one. It gives the opportunity to experience the full range of flavors going on here. All in all, the Smoked Porter is a good smoked beer and I was stoked to get one from a fellow western BA member.

As if you'd melted chunks of snow on a campfire, made it into water, and used that water to brew a beer. Though...it's not as crazy smoked as a traditional German Rauchbier.

The smoke aroma was quickly apparent upon pouring.The smokiness seems to cover most of the usual porter aromas. The smoke is obviously the first thing you taste, but is followed by the traditional porter roastiness. This beer did not have as much body as is my experience with the style.

The taste is mostly smoke with some sweet chocolate or coffee, struggling to make it through the thick haze of smoke. I imagine cellaring for a long period would allow the other flavors to brighten up and smooth out the smoke. The feel is good, bubbly and mouth-coating.

Literally no light is penetrating this one. Aroma is hard to put a finger on, as it is light, with some peat smoke, but not a whole lot else. Taste is full of interesting flavor. The smoke is such that it almost reminds me of smoked meat, or beef jerky. There is also a nice background of chocolate, and a somewhat bitter finish. Mouthfeel is heavier then I remember.

Many thanks to Smokingmex for the opportunity. Cheers","jamie2dope","May 09, 2008"

A finger of dark tan head of tiny bubbles that turns into a lasting covering. Little lacing. The aromas going on here are marvelous: rich but not overwhelming smokiness, earthy peat, subtle chocolate notes. Has the smoke meat characteristic that a Rauchbier has but to a much smaller degree. Taste is smoothe and savory smoked malt that leaves an almost tanginess. This meets a strong roasted malt backing that comes together in a very unobtrusive complexity. This has such an impressive richness from the smokiness, but is amazingly drinkable. I would no doubt open another of these if one were in my possession. Highly recommended, especially for those fond of Rauchbiers. I could drink these any time of year. Perfect for winter or a cooler summer night in front of a campfire.","beavers","Apr 27, 2008"

The nose is rich and tempting, hinting that the marriage of smoke and porter has been a fruitful one. Abundant smoky campfire aromas, mix in with cocoa and leafy hops. A light graininess and hints of wood also linger, but the smoke is the dominant force here. The first sip is greeted by a nice smooth smoked chocolate flavour (if such a thing exists). Caramel, smoked sausage and wood combine in ways I wouldn't think could be so pleasurable, while a light sweetness and slight hint of sourness provide a delicate balance. Medium body and carbonation is par for the style. Weird, but fantastic. Had it a few years later on tap in New York and it was still on fine form.","bobsy","Jan 10, 2008"

Thick head left creamy trails of lace on the glass. Aromas of extremely smokey malts, some wood, and a touch of bittersweet chocolate filled my nose. Different, but in a good way. Taste was quite unique and as good as the nose. More smokey malts, some charred wood, a small tinge of chocolate, and maybe just a bit of smokey bacon. A little bit of tingly carbonation was noticed on the tongue and throat. No noticeable alcohol here. Mouthfeel was a little thin in my opinion.

4.6,10.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Many thanks to dmeadows and b0ldfacelies for sending me samples of the 2005 bottling of Alaskan Smoked Porter. This looks beautiful in my nonic, all the darkest brown there is (which basically means it's black) with a lovely mahogany halo ringing the bottom edge of the glass. The head is surprisingly modest (or maybe not so surprising given the age of the bottle), and is a sandy ecru color; it's noisy and doesn't stick around for very long. Before the head completely disappeared, however, I detected faded wisps of alder smoke, very much like the way one's clothes smell waking up in the morning on a camping trip, with the embers of the previous night's fire still clinging to everything. There are also some slightly sour, but full and chocolatey nonetheless, aromas from the dark, black roasted malts. These qualities persist in the taste as well, with the chocolate becoming decidedly more pronounced, along with a slightly sour, earthy mineral flavor. The smoke, mind you, is of course the highlight of the taste. But at this age (one-and-a-half years, at least) it has become pleasantly muted. Enough to let the drinker know that this porter is indeed brewed with smoked malts, but it's not here to make you feel as if you chased a smoked-ham and smoked-gouda cheese sandwich with a swallow of bong water. No, this is some subtle, nuanced, well-crafted smokiness that most likely has improved since its fresher days (this is the freshest sample of Alaskan Smoked Porter I've yet to try). Medium in body, full-ish on the palate with a dignifed smoothness that seems to have emerged due to its stay in the cellar. Overall, this is a fabulous, paradigmatic porter. I'm very glad to have more bottles stashed downstairs. By the way, this paired extraordinarily with some spicy black bean quesadillas.","orfeu","Feb 01, 2007"

There is some bitterness, but everything seems well rounded. Still a good amount of carbonation left in this, along with a nice medium body. More smoke and chocolate comes through as it warms. This seems to be a smoked porter that is done to perfection. What an enjoyable beer! Very drinakble, as before I knew it, it was gone.","Bierguy5","Jan 06, 2007"
4.49,7.9,3.5,4.5,5,4,4,"The beer arrived a deep rich brown with minimal head and almost no lacing. The smell that hits you is of smoke, roasted malt and trace hops. The taste is of smoke, glorious smoke. I am assuming they use alderwood because this tastes just like NW smoked salmon. The background notes are of toffee, coffee maybe some dark chocolate. Very nice with a wonderful aftertaste. The smoke hits you in the middle between the sweetness imparted by the heavy hand of the malt and the hops at the end. truly a wonderful tasting beer.

Some smoked malts and peat on the nose and mouth, an average amount for a smoked beer, nothing too extreme. Skunky bitterness tells me perhaps this bottle is a bit overripe, but it's former glory still shines through. The body is too flat and....underfermented??? Is that a word? Seems like there's too much wort still hanging around in the body of the beer. A good porter but not great like the barleywine.","rayjay","Oct 15, 2006"

This is really best drinkable just below cellar temps the colder it was the less it was and the room temp was just not cohesive enough everything really seemed too sharp. The look is great nice black body covered in a tan head. The smell is a dull wet smoke with tannic touches and a addition of roasty malt. The taste comes out smoky and stays smokey only in the back finish does the porter part pop. I think the base beer is pretty good on its own and the nice smoke gives it a unique twist. This is a little bit thinner than I thought it would be but still holds enough to support the cast. A 22 is good enough to fly solo or share.

The nose is filled with smoky aromas of wood and peat, as well as roasted malt and chocolate. The mouthfeel is on the thin side of medium bodies and it's a bit rough and prickly, but the negatives are all fairly minor. Sweet caramel malt and fruit join the smoky flavors in this tasty beer. I have a seafood allergy so I don't know whether or not this tastes (or smells) like salmon.

There also seems to be a little bit of caramel and coffee beans. It's subtle, but there. The taste seems dry and roasted. The smoke presence in the smell is present in the taste, but mildly so, I feel, anyway. But then again, I drink Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier like most people drink SNPA.

Chocolately and toasted coffee. The taste was mellowed but very pleasing to my lucky taste buds. The taste gives you more of the toasted coffee and chocolate notes but also a bit of bitterness. After I let this sit for awhile to warm up a bit, I got some caramel notes in the aroma and taste and I noticed a wonderful swirling efffect on the limited head.

The head atop the opaque body was light beige in color and one finger thick. While the looks were good, the aroma was otherworldly smoky, underlain by a chocolate smell. The smokiness was also unmistakable in the taste, but it was far from overwhelming, and permitted chocolaty sweet and lemony sour flavors of a very well made porter come through. The hops were also present with a citric bitterness. Mouthfeel was chalky and dry, while still being silky smooth. No hint of harsh graininess in the aftertaste, just smooth long drawn out smoke. After tasting this spectacular beer, I wish more brewers would start experimenting with smoked malt.

I enjoyed this with a med-rare BBQ brisket. The choclately flavors came out back and forth when I would take a bite of the steak, and then again with the porter.

We compared this with Stone Smoked Porter in a vertical tasting during halftime of the Super Bowl. Now Stone makes an outstanding smoked porter, but it left me almost wanting to dump it in the sink so I could get on with drinking the Alaskan. So velvety and rich, with a smoke bite almost that of an Aecht Schlenkerla beer. Dumbfoundingly good.","crookedhalo","Feb 09, 2006"

The overall color is dark, but some light penetrates giving it those reddish hues. The smell is not overpowering, mostly hints of toasty/burnt coffee. Taste is very rich and dry. The flavors of toasty coffee are present, and its doesn't really seem that smoky. Finally in the finish I get the flavor of campfire smoke, just a hint. Bitterness is at a moderate level. The mouthfeel is nice, full body, semi-thick, nice carbonation. This is one of the most drinkable beers I have ever had. Its not the best or most complex, but its perfectly well-rounded.

There is the smokiness, a little malty sweetness, and then a good dose of roasted bitterness and some hop bitterness too. This is well-done and a clear American classic, but the mouthfeel seemed a little thin and I think the beer could have been a tad more aggressive wrt maltiness and/or malt complexity without hurting the smoke profile at all.","KroMagnon","Dec 01, 2005"

Of course, the smokiness is the first thing that hits you: almost a woodstove cedar flavor that could warm a ski lodge. The flavor lingers.

The first time I had this beer I thought was like a campfire. I still think it smells like that. Not much hop aroma. I can detect a roasted malty aroma, but just slightly. This beer tastes strongly like smoked wood. Almost like I have a fire log in my mouth. Only not quite so strange, or gross. Behind the smokey wood flavor, I detect some maltyness. As with the aroma, I dont taste much in the way of hops. This beer has a bold aggressive smokey flavor. It is full bodies. It leaves a woody, smokey aftertaste. It is carbonated very well. This beer is very good, but I dont know if it would make a great session beer. Although the alcohol content is not too high, the aggressive flavor might not agree with a night of drinking.

The fruits appear later and stay in the aftertaste: no raspberries anymore, but oranges get combined with fresh notes of lemon. The mouthfeel is quite round, and enjoyably light wihtout being thin.

At the summit the foam was two-fingers in height. Head retention was good; it slowly faded to a clumpy cap. A few more moments later the cap broke apart to a bubbly collar, fairly thick. There was some subsequent lacing; it was unorganized and tattered but not widespread. The appearance is pleasing. The nose is smoky, it is not on par with Aecht Schlenkerla but in fairness I dont think it was brewed to be that loud. Actually the smoke is balanced perfectly with healthy charred/roasted malt. Okay, maybe balance isnt the proper wording because the smoke is a tickle louder. The smoke doesnt offer that typical bacon/sausage aroma; it smells woodier than anything with hints of smoked cheese. There are also hints of chocolate, coffee, peat, and even some vanilla. Rich campfire after-burn and the well rounded finish. The potency is only moderate, this sucks; I wanted it to scream at me. Deafen me with its aroma. It doesnt. Damn! I love what I smell, I really do. It is very inviting. Almost perfect. The palate is lovely. Like the nose the smoke has plenty of company in the form of roasted malt. As brewed, it is more Porter than Rauchbier. Lovely. Other Smoked Beers have disappointed me, not this one. I can see why it is so highly regarded; it is the perfect marriage of two styles (that is now considered just one). The smokiness, like the nose, is wood. Campfire residue ah, the memories this beer brings back. The malt provides some sweetness but the finish is largely dry. Chocolate kisses are semi-sweet. Coffee beans as well, more akin to espresso though. Hints of vanilla laced with caramel. Soft fruitiness too, kisses of cherries mainly. Light acidity. Hops offer the slightest bit of herbalness. In the finish the straight smokiness returns to complement the various roasted qualities. I enjoyed this Smoked Porter very much. Im obsessed with smoke and while this one is not out of control in this regard, it is brewed with obvious care. It is very well done. This 6.5% abv is hidden. I dont think the palate could be approved upon; its that delicious. A tickle fuller than medium in body, the carbonation is moderate and natural. The mouthfeel is very fitting for this beer, it is not too filling or too heavy but there is enough bulk. It is hearty but pliable. Enjoyable. To ask if this beer is drinking is insulting. Havent you been reading? Drink this beer with cheese and sausages. Drink this beer alone. Either way it is great. So often beers that are legendary end up being disappointing, this one wasnt. I understand the hype. This is a quality beverage. It is worth seeking out. I purchased this bomber of the 2004 edition on-line from Liquid Solutions.","bditty187","Jan 06, 2005"

Pours into the pint class an impenetrable dark coffee colored concoction, capped with wisps of pale tan head. Aroma is like sitting in a smokehouse, rich and thick and woody, with a slight hint of malt sweetness and hop. Flavor is perfectly smoked with a nice hop bitterness blending perfectly with a slight tartness. Easing back into the wood fire smoke, you gradually approch a smooth malty middle with just a bit of dark chocolate and the finish leaves you with just a hint of smokey bitterness. It's like when you bit into the best piece of smoked beef jerky and you gotta have more after the first taste.

It is also a bit sweet with caramel malt. The taste is very similar with a big does of smoky goodness over a dark chocolate backdrop. Very roasty with a bit of earth bitterness in the mix. As expected the finish is another smoky filled delight. Overall the smoke and chocolate sweet malts balance out quite nicely. Body is medium and creamy.

Excellent mouthfeel, silky smooth. Drinkability takes a hit due to visions of smoked salmon that I get with every sip.

It looks delicous sitting in my Alaskan Brewing Comapny pint glass. The nearly black body and brown head are just begging for me to stop admiring the beer and start drinking it. This is my first smoked porter, and I have nothing to compare the beer to, so many of my descriptions may be of the smoked porter style instead of this beer itself, but I try to be objective regardless. The smell combines maltiness and a smoky smell. Malty goodness also powers the taste of the beer. The smoky taste is very clear, especially in the aftertaste. However, I cannot shake the connection I make of this beer to meat, having taated many smoked meats, and I find this slightly off-putting. The beer is also, in my mind, over-carbonated, approximately the same as soda. But, despite my criticisms and dissapointment in tasting this very hyped beer, I still feel that it is a tasty brew.

4.59,10.3,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"2002 bottled edition- Very, very dark brown color overall with deep ruby highlights within its realm of dark fog when held up to the light. Thin cocoa brown head that subsides quickly and leaves clear spotty lace. Smell has lots of good sweet roastyness to it, deep and rich, thick sweetened chocolate layered on top of heavily roasted malts, small hops and a hint of smokey woodish earth lightly showing up as it warms with a note of coffee in it. Taste is smooth and roasty sweet, light bitter sweet chocolate, lightly tangy sweet roasted malts. Well rounded and soft, a small amount of hops pleasantly keeps a nice bittering bite and balance over the roasty sweetness. Some coffeeish senses along with a gentle effervescense of smokeyness sneaks its way past the roasty sweetness as well. There's some dark fruity bread chewyness that reminds of a x-mas favorite of mine, a dark marble rye-cinnamon-cherry bread that makes it a pleasing memorable experience for me. Its not overly complex, it has very subtle qualities and when served at the desired warmer temp the smokey characteristics become a bit more noticeable, but never enough to overwhelm. Feel is smooth and creamy, medium, close to full body, lightly chewy aspect with a sticky roastyness covering the tongue and mouth in the finish; my favorite part of this beer, or for any porter for that matter. A very smooth drinkin' porter that goes down pretty easy. Its not quite as bold or rich as some, but its a definate keeper; worth the effort of finding and a must try for all.","tavernjef","Sep 17, 2003"

4.38,5.3,3,5,4.5,4,4,"Originally sampled on 17 January 2002. Break out the smoked sausage, the perfect beer to accompany it is here. Alaskan Smoked Porter is beautifully smokey. One whiff makes you think you're in a great deli, loaded w/ good smoked sausage. It pours jet black w/ a tan. It has a little bite on the tongue, but it's quite enjoyable.","jcalabre","Jun 09, 2003"
4.3,3.4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Mouth is roasted and smoky with a rich BBQ flavor and a rich barley body. Finish is mildly hoppy and sweet with a touch of smoky acid.","drewbage","Jun 08, 2003"
4.77,14.7,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"2002 Vintage. Black in color with a thin, dark tan head. Aroma has a woody smokiness to it, very campfire-like. This sweetens as you become accustomed to it, taking on a more chocolatey malt character. The first sip is a really intriguing burnt malt flavor -- never had anything like it. This smokiness persists pretty much throughout the entire sip, but takes on an interestingly different character at each stage, manifesting itself in the mildly chocolatey mid-palate, and in hop finish, and lingering pleasantly in a long aftertaste. Body is creamy in texture, but there's enough tingle from the carbonation and bitterness to make it go down easily. A surprisingly drinkable beer. Bravo!","mzwolinski","Apr 10, 2003"
4.37,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours very dark, almost black, in color with a foamy tan colored head that sticks all over the sides of the glass. Nose is roasted dark malts and chocolate with a bit of wet wood. A full-bodied brew with a smooth and creamy texture and a slightly warming alcohol presence (bottle lists the abv at 6.1%). Taste has a strong smoky wood and charcoal flavor throughout, but there are additional flavors layered behind the smokinesssweet malts towards the front with dark fruits and bitter coffee following soon after. A very nice brew. Pair this with some aged smoked cheddar cheese, and youre in for quite a treat! Purchased from Liquid Solutions.","Morris729","Apr 09, 2003"
3.9,-6.3,4,4,4,4,3.5,"There was little detectable hop bitterness, but the abundance of roasted barley imparted its own bitter qualities, as well as some chocolate and coffee flavors. A very clean profile, though not noticably different from a standard porter. A 22oz bottle is the perfect serving.","freed","Mar 17, 2003"

4.18,0.5,4.5,4,5,3.5,3,"This beer tastes like a porter should with an added bonus of a unique smoked flavor that is excellent with foods: BBQ, Smoked Salmon and cheese. This beer is lightly carbonated which is a plus in my book but unfortuantley has a thin head because of this. I seem to recall more intense flavor when originally sampled that age seemed to dim, if your not a fan of smoked beers than aging it might be a good idea for you. This is the one of the best tasting beers I have ever had the only downside is that it isn't a session beer. One or two does it for a sitting, you don't want to drink too many of these.","zacharius","Jan 12, 2003"
4,-3.8,4,4,4,4,4,"A successful foray into the realm of the smoke-flavored beer. I will definitely keep my last bottle and let it age for a few years.","OldFrothingSlosh","Jan 04, 2003"
3.93,-5.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Again, thanks to my flat mate for a sample of this beer. Kind of pours like motor oil with no head. Very little carbonation in this one. The taste is of course smokey but mild. I would have to say it has just enough smoke flavor. Any more would through this out of balance. Malty and sweet with that warming feeling as it goes down. I believe this one could use some aging as the alcohol is a bit pronounced. A good beer that I want to try again. This bottle was from the 2002 batch.","CharlesRiver","Dec 17, 2002"
4.02,-3.4,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Drinkability & Notes: Not as legendary as so many of the aficionados said it was. A sound porter as a whole with a thickly line smoky backing, smoked cheese and meat would be the obvious pairing … why not try a contrast pairing of a grilled venison burger topped with soft pungent goat cheese and lime accented mayo … did me just fine.","Jason","Dec 03, 2002"
3.97,-4.6,3.5,4,4,4,4,"I was upset when I noticed the bottle said 2001 so this brew was a year old. A very dark porter, looks like a black Imperial Stout. Head retention was poor and lace was very sparse, perhaps this was due to the age? Smell was roasty and smoky as was the taste, mouthfeel a bit spritzy. Decent drinkability. I guess this isn't my favorite porter but I wish I had noticed the label.","Mark","Dec 02, 2002"
4.5,8.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Had this fresh on tap at the Celtic Bayou for the first time (go figure).  Jet black in color with a pleasing tan head.  Bringing the glass to your nose brings odors of smoke and autumn (dry leaves and the like).  Smoke flavor was surprising well balanced with the rest of the beer and wasn't in your face like I had anticipated.  Other noticeable flavors were some sweer chocolate, fruits, and a slight port-like character.  Lots going on here and the smoke just serves to enhance everything.  Mouthfeel was very nice with the only ""negative"" thing being that the smokiness made me drink it more slowly.  Definitely worth seeking out.","jreitman","Nov 08, 2002"
4.89,17.5,4,5,5,4.5,5,"2001. Quite black in color with only a sliver of clear brown visible at the base of the glass. Pours a pillowy, deep tan head that holds well, eventually drops to a good collar, and leaves some excellent lace. The smoke is clearly present in the aroma. It's satisfying - much more like burning wood than dry leaves, or cigarettes (as some smoked, and even roasted barley tinted, beers can be). Much like the smell you pick up on yourself while camping. When combined with the earthiness and grassiness of the hops present, the aroma is like being out in the wild. It's slightly sharp, but not too acrid; with a delicate, ""woody"" taste. The smoke is backed by a lightly sweet, dark chocolatey maltiness and the aforementioned hops. Surprisingly, it's smokiness is continually noticeable and enjoyable. With some smoked beers, the smoke is mainly found at the outset, and then lost. The body is medium-full with a moderate carbonation level. The mouthfeel is nicely creamy. The flavor is softly fruity, and mainly chocolatey, with a lingering sherry-like character, some hops, and a really nice soft smokiness in the finish. Very well balanced, but also assertively hoppy! Very enjoyable; even comforting in a way. Quite complex, not just with the smoke adding an exciting layer, but within the beer itself. Quite rich, and very rewarding. Absolutely worth trying - even for the person who doesn't normally like smoked beers! This one is quite unique!","NeroFiddled","Sep 11, 2002"

4.28,2.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Very dark, just a little ruby light transmission at the bottom of the glass. Great soft head, slowly breaking bubbles and a good inch thick for quite a while...mild aroma, a little molasses. Smoky impression in the taste, combines with malts of coffee impression to give a woodsy taste, almost like coffee around the campfire in the morning. Smoke isn't overpowering. Nice lack of sweetness to me and the carbonation is well-done, neither flat nor over-charged. Aftertaste is pleasant, like a good Kenyan bean coffee, and with a slight fluffy impression. May be a little bitter to some, but I loved this! Many thanks to fellow Minnesotan BeerAdvocate Bighuge for the bottle.","ADR","May 31, 2002"
4.13,-0.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Had the 2000 and 2001 vintage.  Alder smoking is very apparent in the 2000 from the bottle, not so much from tapped 2001.  Just like drinking a vat of smoked salmon rubbed with dark malts.  I'm goin to save some of the 2000 for later.  Goes great with any type of wild meat and rich fish dishes.  Not a chugging brew for sure.","beernut7","May 22, 2002"
4.65,11.8,4,4,5,4.5,5,"Pours very, very close to jet black.  Lovely creamy brown head that laces the glass as I drink.  Smoked salmon and a little java on the nose. First impression as I taste is, ""Oh, this is a beauty.""  Very nice subtle bitterness and some great black coffee taste.  Very mellow and smooth.  Great roastiness.  Smoke is the main player here.  Not as dominant as I've had in other beers (like Batch 5000), but very, very nice. There is very nice balance between malt and hops in this medium bodied porter.  Neither is neglected, but rather both can be savored in this classic.","Bighuge","Apr 13, 2002"
4.7,13,5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"An excellent smoked porter with the ""smoked"" flavor evident on the nose and the palate...Dark black in color with a nice soft head light head...I love the character in the body of this beer....the ""smoke"" flavor is nicely done and not overbearing at all, but I'm left wondering what this would taste like minus the ""smoke""..I think it would be a top notch porter even without it..(and personally I could drink a few more without the smoke taste)..still this is an excellent beer I feel fortunate to have tried..","ZAP","Feb 16, 2002"
