"O-  Decent porter, good flavor."
""
""
""
"Mild aroma. Flavor leans to cocoa (not chocolate but cocoa). Mouthfeel surprisingly light because it's carbonated more than expected."
"3.77/5.00"
"Not the best beer from this brewer i highly respect. A bit thin but reasonable drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Feel: Carbonation is a big high. But the beer is smooth."
""
""
"Just doesn't feel like a porter to me. It's like they took a IPA and made it darker. Not a fan"
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a decent beer. Not really that amazing, but decent."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not to my liking compared to many other widely distributed porters. Not terrible though. I probably wouldn't get it again."
""
""
"Great overall taste. Very little aftertaste.  Perhaps a bit too carbonated."
""
""
""
""
""
"Coffee and Beer,  the two things I love, and this beer blends them together perfectly.  Look: Dark Brown with a soft white head, and this beer left a fair amount of lacing around my glass as I drank. Smell: this beer had a wonderful aroma of coffee and cocoa. Taste: Awesome flavors of coffee, cocoa,  and malts. Feel: Very carbonated and rich, which I loved. I'm not a fan of Sierra Nevada beers, but they've hit a homerun with this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: In terms of color and flavor this is a lighter dry porter with a stronger than average hops presence particularly in the finish. Pretty easy drinking and very enjoyable."
""
"Overall : a fine offering but way too much hop for my preference. It borders on Odell's Cutthroat, with its hop presence - but it is leagues better in my opinion. Nice cocoa and roasted notes, but lots of hop within a light to medium body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not your typical porter at all. Arguably over hopped for the family but a very interesting selection and certainly one that could turn into a few!"
""
"Nothing to ride home about really"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"pour was beautiful, very dark brown to black, with beautiful fluffy white head, lasting with significant lacing.  all other aspects were just solid, nothing standing out, nose and taste of dark chocolate to coffee, little Sierra hop bite perhaps at the end.  carbonation perhaps a tad strong early on.  to repeat in a word, solid."
"Overall- An average, no bs porter with decent complexity. Not world class but still quite good. Well done and right on par for the style!"
"Unpleasant smell, bland flavor profile."
"This is as delicious and smooth as a porter lover would want. Not a standout but a rock solid porter!"
"O: I have bought this before and will again."
"More carbonation that I would normally expect with a porter, but not too much."
"Overall, this was a very nice American Porter. I love it for it is and what it continues to be to me."
"not a huge porter fan"
"Tastes of burnt malt plus maybe some coffee and a hint of chocolate.  Not a whole lot else going on.  Low carbonation.  Very drinkable, but not something that I would go out of my way for."
""
""
"Overall: Love it. If you love smoke, you'll love this."
""
""
""
"Pours dark with a white medium head. Mild burnt coffee smell. Burnt coffee taste with a dry finish."
""
""
"Pours really dark, really dry Porter. drinkable but not something I will hunt for"
""
"Pours dark with tan head. Nose is mostly malt and some roasted/coffe notes. Flavor is malty and feels a little dry. Finish lingers, again somewhat dry and strong roasted taste. Pretty tasty."
""
""
"Drinkable but just does not standout"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very nice porter, with no one flavor dominating the profile.  It has nice roasted notes, nice bitter notes, and some chocolate sweetness all playing harmoniously.  An easy choice to grab if you are craving the style."
""
""
"rather bland and disappointing.  i expected more"
""
""
"nice bit of coffee flavor, little foam head"
"This is a great porter. While coffee is expected and noticeable in aroma and taste, there is an exciting malt profile that was unexpected from aroma alone. Rather filling, great in the winter. Recommend"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A solid porter - my favorite of the Snow Pack variety pack. It doesn't try anything crazy, but does all the fundamentals of the style well. I like it about the same as Deschuteâ€™s Black Butte Porter."
""
""
"Impeccably smooth. Perfect everyday porter. What a porter should taste like."
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown in color and some light does penetrate.  There's a half inch of dense beige head.  I smell bakers chocolate and dark malt.  I taste chocolate and coffee.   There's a sharp bitterness in the fade with the coffee note. The mouth is moderately chewy and sticky."
"O: I haven't had too many porters, but this is a pretty darn good beer. Another solid one from the Sierra Nevada 'Snowpack' seasonal sampler."
"12 oz bottle on a Christmas afternoon in Ireland watching a Christy Moore video. A good  porter but I would love to try a tap version to compare to draught Guinness as served in an Irish bar."

"average porter beer not a favorite"

""

"Medium bodied, medium carbonation, rather good drinkability."
""
""
""
"Overall: An excellent beer, and one I'm glad I had the opportunity to try. I love Sierra Nevada for including this outstanding brew into the winter Snow Pack seasonal sampler. An excellent beer, and one I highly recommend. I love the lighter body with the robust flavoring- it's a nice switch up from huge stouts."
""
""
"I honestly forgot how goddamn delicious this beer is. Truly an incredible example of an American Porter."
""

"This is a very well crafted offering and imminently drinkable."

"I am not a porter fan. I would drink a case of this porter. So much perfectly chocolatey maltiness. Yum."
"From what I could gather, the porter and stout have very similar taste profiles. The stout is smoother and creamier, while the porter is more crisp and a tad bit sour."
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark brown coloring with light amber highlights, and a fluffy, light, clingy, tan colored head. Aromas of coffee and toffee forward, with nutty highlights, caramel notes, hints of chocolate, and roasted overtones. Flavors are coffee and cream forward, with a tangy and rich toffee and caramel backbone, hints of roast and char, and bittersweet chocolate notes. The body is light and smooth, with a dry characteristic. The aftertaste is mostly bitter roast and cream sweetness, with a smooth, dry, lingering bitter finish. Solid beer."

"Sierra Nevada Porter brewed by Sierra Nevada Brewing Co., with an ABV of 5.60% This brew pours out a nice brown color with a nice off white head.  Sierra Nevada Porter has the look of cola, not saying that is a bad thing.  The smell is rich with sweetness and grains. You also pick up some hops int the smell of this brew. The taste is bold with flavor and mild hops.  Sierra Nevada Porter has a nice balance to it.  There is nothing overpowering in this brew.  The mouthfeel is nice,clean, and refreshing .  Sierra Nevada Brewing Co., did a nice job with this one.  Overall I'm giving Sierra Nevada Porter a 4 out of 5."

"Poured into a pint glass. Appearance: dark brown/black with a finger of tan head that fades with spotty lacing. Smell: dark fruits, bitter hops, light hint of smoky, not much malt. Taste: bitter dark fruits, date and raisin, bitter hops, and a smoky taste. Mouthfeel: moderate carbonation, sticks around through the entirety of the drink. Overall: very good porter, not the best I've ever had but definitely up there. A good beer for fall and winter."
""
""
""
""
""
"I had this poured out of the bottle into a stout glass. The color was a very very dark brown, with an accompanying milk chocolate head. The smell was an excellent indication of the coming taste, dark roasted malts, some coffee, and a little cocoa. The mouthfeel was grainy. What a porter ought to be."
""
""
""
"O: A great example of a Decent, no nonsense porter. An easy beer to drink, and perfect during the colder months."
""
""
""
""
""

"Maybe I expected more based on the previous ratings.  I prefer porters, to me this one seemed average."

"O: a nicely made porter, good for fans of the style or as a solid introduction to the style."
"Did a side by side with the Stout. For $1.25, this is a great brew to drink on those cold nights. For FL that means 70 degrees, but hay, that is cold here!"

"DATE TASTED: November 20, 2014... GLASSWARE: Barley Creek pint... OCCASION: cold days like these call for a porter... APPEARANCE: another pitch-black body; off-brown head; slightly creamy; lacing is hazy and intricate... AROMA: beautiful brown ale hops; some doughy, bready hints--enticing ... PALATE: solid, rather easy-drinking and flat; a bubbly finish; the expected cola consistency....TASTE: earthy, slightly malty base that is appreciably roasted; hops evoke a vegetable-like quality; some coffee and cocoa, enough to add dimension to the profile ... OVERALL: indeed a working man's brew--invigorating and warming, though low in alcohol and not heavy enough to diminish its drinkability ..."

"O - If you are looking for the definition of a classic American porter, this is it. Nothing outside of the box; just very solidly crafted."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: liked the aroma more than the flavor;"
""
""
"Overall - Very good porter.  I believe this would not only be a go to porter for drinking, but would make a good cooking beer also."

"Great looking beer, as are all of Sierra Nevada's products.  I think my main takeaway from this beer is that it is crazy drinkable.  Nice and clean.  I like the flavors, but it still leans more towards the burned coffee flavor than I like.  Leans that way, not dominated by.  I could certainly drink a few of these in a sitting, but I like beers that lean more towards chocolate than coffee."

"The hallmark of all Sierra beers, in my opinion, is consistent satisfaction. That is how I view this porter. Not the best, but it won't disappoint you, either. Toasted malts up front. Smooth finish with very little warmth on the back end. Great to purchase as part of a variety pack and to keep in the fridge for that random weeknight when you want a good porter to complement dinner. But I would probably try something more exotic if drinking at a time or place with options."

"Bottled 10-17-14. Pours dark brown, not quite opaque with just a little light shining through. Nice fluffy head that settled quickly to a quarter inch. Aroma is slight coffee and chocolate, and a little light all around. Flavor is slight dark roast malt with a slight sweet caramel, almost cola flavor. Mouthfeel was pretty thin, with very little carbonation. Overall, not bad at all, but not great."
""
""
""
"Fresh bread dough nose. Taste is bitter, malty and mild. Not much of an aftertaste. Hops come forward a little more as it warms up. Just OK in my opinion."
""
""
"O - The porter you would expect from SN - a nice roast supported by a solid hop complement.  Delicious, and easy to drink."

"Overall: Sierra Nevada's Porter is a great example of the style. A good introduction for those new to beers with well-roasted malts since the bittersweetness and roastiness is definitely present and actually the primary feature of the beer, but does not overwhelm the palate. I'm more of a stout guy than a porter guy, but I definitely enjoyed this one and need to study this style a little more!"
""
""
""
"O- An above-average porter that's a classic among the SN core lineup and actually pretty damn complex.  It's been years since I've last had this and I'm so glad it was included in the Snowpack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I've had this before, but never remembered to review it. A very good porter, wouldn't seek out individually in it's own sixer, but it's a nice compliment to the other beers in the snowpack. As with any SN brew, it's worth the price of admission."

"O: Overall a pretty solid porter."

"This is a good beer, reminiscent more of a brown ale than my style of Porter. Robust but light and relatively low ABV."

""
""
""
""
"O:  Beer has too many drawbacks.  Will not purchase again."
""
""
""
"O: Maybe not the boldest, but good for when you want something darker, but not too heavy."
""
"Overall: It's a good ""no frills"" porter. Great all-around flavor and aroma. To me the mouthfeel is a bit thin, but I would still enjoy this any day of the week. It would be good to pair with anything from a burger to a grilled chicken sandwich."

"Bottle from Hop City Birmingham. Pours dark brown pour with tan head. Aroma of roasted malt and chocolate. Taste of chocolate, roasted malts, a slight bitter finish. Medium bodied. Very good"

"Overall - An outstanding porter; this one seems more balanced than a lot of other porters out there, which makes for a really sessionable brew. I'd have liked to see a tad more hop presence in this, but that is just a personal preference. This is right up there with the best American porters in my book."
""
""
"Overall - I'm not a huge fan of the style, however, this is a very nice version."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall 3.75: Good brew.  I like porters, but they ten to be too light for me.  This one is not light at all and has a very clean finish.  However, I found it a bit too smoky for my tastes.  Nonetheless, a good beer that has many fans."
""
""
""
""
""
"Got this in the winter sampler. Pours a dark brown, almost black, with an initial tan, stoutish head that sinks into a thin collar around the rim of the glass. Doing this out of a 4oz sampler glass. Aroma is smoke, malt, chocolate, a little spice to it. Flavor is that, but not as pronounced as I thought it would be. The mouthfeel is only slightly watery, and the light carbonation doesn't really prop it up much. Overall a good porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle. Pours a dark, clear brown. Very large head. Head is light tan in color. It retains and laces effectively. Chocolate and yeast with a fruit ester element. Roastiness. A light, woody hoppiness. Simple and agreeable. Some chocolate, roast, yeast and brown sugar. A bit milky. Lingering burnt caramel finish. Medium bodied with pleasing carbonation. Actually the body is kinda light. Drinkable. Very mellow but good for a standard, no-frills Porter. Surprised I haven't had this up until now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really good porter from one of the brewers that repopularized the style in the United States. Hits all the right notes, and can pair with a meal or stand up on its own."

"Another excellent beer from Sierra Nevada as I've come to expect from the California based brewery, this one's best bit seemed to be the fact it was so well balanced with no one flavour overpowering the rest, I even managed to detect the hops coming through in this one with relative ease which is fairly unusual for such a style of beer. Great from the get go, I'm just disappointed it has taken me so long to actually get round to trying this one but it's certainly been worth the wait."
""
"Dark pour with some brown highlights and an off-white one-finger head. Aroma is light roasted malts with a hint of chocolate and coffee. Flavor follows the nose with the roasted malt being the dominant flavor backed by some chocolate, caramel and toffee. Also has a moderately bitter espresso flavor that comes through as the beer warms. Medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. Finishes with a light lingering bitterness. Very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Easy to drink and extremely enjoyable to drink - this one is just about sessionable. Alcohol is extremely well hidden and the slightly lighter mouthfeel makes it very easy and pair well with food."

"Overall: This porter is to the point. The aroma has more going on in it than the flavor. Not a bad thing. Sometimes I like it when a beer gets me thinking it is going to be one way with the aroma, and then changes lanes (Either good or bad). This drinks smooth and I could drink this pretty much all day. I like Robust and Roasted brews. But with all the other Porters out there this one is solid yet not adventurous. This brew is worthy."

"Drinkability/mouthful- one and done porter for me.. Lacks body, a bit watery for a porter, I can see some who could knock back a couple but I can't get Folger's coffee out of my head kind of kills it for me personally. I like to see more body to it, more chocolate malts, less hop forwardness and a better body to the brew. Okay beer not bad, nothing to get to excited about."

"Although I have enjoyed this before, I might as well writ a review from the snowpack variety pack.  This is what I expect from a porter, its not watery, but it is lighter than a stout but presents the roasted flavors and aromas forward.  A fantastic example of an american porter."

"Pours a deep brown in color with a good 2+ finger foamy off-white head that lasts a while then settles to a thick layer on top and sides. Decent amount of lacing is seen. The aroma is of roasted malts, coffee with a hint of hazelnut as well. Very nice. The taste has more going on with the roasted malt coming through with a hint of caramel and toffee and hazelnut coffee even. Pretty smooth to drink with no bitter or harsh aftertaste. Perfect carbonation. A great brew."

"Brown, earthly, hint of deep red, foam lighter, hazelnut cream color. Heavy, overwhelming, coffee grains, malt, caramel, although only 5.6 alc, rightfully designated as extra strong. Citrus, roasted nut cortex and some smoke in aftertaste. As it is written on bottle, beer for hard working men and woman. You can't make mistake with steaks."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured an incredibly deep, clear brown. Light barely gets through. The head is thick and dense, with great retention and lacing. The aroma is a little light, a little roasted malt and earthy. The taste, though, brings more with increased depth in the roasted malt. It's not ridiculously complex but it is really good. There's a nice weight to the body and a nice finish. A really good straightforward porter."

"O--It's been awhile since I've had a Porter, but this one was great. Another hit from Sierra Nevada. The label calls for big malt flavor and it delivers. Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Packaged January 29, 2014."

"I like this beer. After trying the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and being a little underwhelmed (though I must admit dark ales are my preferred beverage) I'm very pleased with this porter. Definitely one of the best offerings I've had from the US of A thus far. Perfect for a couple of cleansing ales on a rainy autumn night."

"6 pack purchased at Vons in Scripps Ranch CA. Pours dark brown with a big fluffy brownish tinged head. A very nice looking beer. Down to the last third now and lacing is very nice, retaining all the way from the top of the glass down to the liquid itself. An earthy, malty smell. Mouthfeel is very smooth, similar to a brown ale, some smokey flavors coming through on the taste as well as some chocolate and coffee. Excellent beer, very pleasent to sip on during those winter nights."

"O- Really nice beer. A great beer for a cold night or day. Complex yet very approachable and thoroughly enjoyable."

"Overall: a good beer, not one I would drink everyday but better than I expected. As a stout lover, this is the second porter I have tasted, and I would have to say this has been the best of the two. A good beer to have with dinner."

"Great toasty porter but slightly to thin."
""
""
"o: A fine porter, excellent dinner drink, but also sippable. Dunno if the almost two years of age on this helped it, but it surely could not have hurt it much."

"A solid brewski and an affordable one, thus one I could easily drink regularly."
""

"Pours a brown color with a foamy off-white head. Smells of coffee and malts. Taste is sweet roasted malts with some hints of chocolate. Thereâ€™s a fair amount of carbonation. Has a medium body feel. I feel like it's lacking something, though I can't quite put my finger on it. Still a pretty good porter."
""
""
""
"O - One of the better porters around."
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured this beer into a glass, it has a brackish color body with a small tan head. The aroma is of roasted malt. The taste has a roasted flavor and a hint of chocolate on the back of the tongue. The mouthfeel is smooth and overall a really good, easy drinking and enjoyable porter."

"330ml bottle. Shaker glass enjoyed @ Freiburg (Barcelona). Pours dark amber in color & dark ruby to the light. Off-white froth creates a creamy & lasting crown. Toasted & sweet malt aromas, fudge chocolate notes & hints of licorice candy to the nose. Creamy toasted maltiness rounded by pleasant underliying bitterness. Medium to full body. Moderate carbonation. Licorice hues in the middle linger into a long bitter/sweet finish. Fudge chocolate on the aftertaste. No doubt: One of my favourite American Porters."

"O: Sierra Nevada Porter packs a lot of complexity and some really great flavors. At only 5.6% ABV, it makes this brew VERY sessionable. This is a go-to Porter for fans of the style and newcomers alike. Definitely going to be picking up a six-pack of this again in the future."
""
""
"Damn this thing has some head retention! Deep deep brown but not opaque. Great sticky lacing. Interestingly sweet aroma, like brown sugar or molasses. Taste has a nice medium to rich malt character with some of that sweetness coming through too. Aftertaste is malty and a touch of coffee and stays for minutes. Great creamy mouthfeel too!"
""
"O: Delicious. It's not as rich as some porters I've had - rather, the easy drinking nature is what gives it its wings. This could make a reliable go-to beer when nothing else is available."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an extremely solid beer, just like most of what Sierra Nevada puts out. Slight chocolate, big on smokiness, this dark beer is very satisfying. The color is a near pitch black, but not much of a head. The mouthfeel left something to be desired, but that was made up for with sheer, clean, flavor. I will definitely be buying this again, and I could see it becoming a ""go to"" choice for a dark drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-solid porter will put it on my buy again list"
""
""
""
"A very sessionable beer, this was an easy to drink porter that hit the spot on a cool November evening. I'd consider this one while while tailgating at the game."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm not usually a massive fan of American Porters, but this is a goodun'. This beer held up quite well, decently thick and heavy in flavour, well-rounded too boot. Nice."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I'm not a big porter or stout guy, but I enjoyed this beer a lot. A nice rich brew with chocolate and coffee hints that goes down nice and smooth. Great job by Sierra Nevada on this one. If you're not a huge fan of porters, still give this one a shot."
""
""
"O - Its ok, too much hoppy character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I like it. It held up amazingly well. Hell, I like it more than the non expired Black Butte I tried last night. This is more my style. A little ragged around the edges, maybe a bit imbalanced in the flavor and rustic in style."
"Overall: This is a very, very solid porter, one of the best examples of an American version of the British classic, in fact. If you like porters, this one will definitely please you. Iâ€™ll certainly get this one again!"
"O: A very enjoyable porter and I find it to be a lot more solid than many of the other Sierra offerings."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Packed full of flavor, Sierra Nevada's Porter blurs the line between porter and stout; a great tasting dark beer that's not overpowering in any of the aspects but well rounded and very drinkable. Another superbly-crafted Sierra Nevada beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is another winner from Sierra Nevada and my second favorite Porter. I would definitely drink this again."
""
"O: This is a great porter for those who aren't looking for something sweet. Fantastic for the Autumn months. Looks like this will be replacing Tumbler for me."
""
""
""
""

"The smell is a little weak but, the taste certainly makes up for that. I consider this a solid, sessionable porter."

"This really is an interesting beer. Itâ€™s a lighter beer, so itâ€™s wonderful to see how the flavors come through as I expected a deeper roastier beer."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 2/20/2013. Pours lightly cloudy reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, chocolate, toast, brown bread, toffee, floral, roast, light coffee, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt notes with moderate earthy hops; and good strength. Taste of caramel, chocolate, toast, toffee, brown bread, roasted malt, light coffee, floral, and herbal earthiness. Fair amount of earthy hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, chocolate, toast, toffee, brown bread, roast, and hop earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of dark/roasted malt with moderate earthy hops; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice porter style. All around nice balance of malt and hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"EDIT: This was my full review during a blind taste test."
"Foamy whitish brownish head. Smells a bit hoppy and cocoa. Taste is a tad bitter and maybe even thin. I expected more a of Guinness mouth feel to the porter. Basically, I was standing in Publix looking at the beers and desperate for something, anything different and since I like Sierra Nevada, I thought I would give their porter a try. It's not a bad pour and I would buy it again but probably in the winter. It's a bit too heavy for the summer heat. I paired it up with an organic summer sausage and it complemented the porky fattiness of the sausage well."
"Color: A translucent dark brown with a vaguely off-white bubbly head. Seems to be some carbonation, however the retention and lacing is not so good. The aroma is a bit off - some kind of vegetal astringency is present. Otherwise some milk chocolate and a faint hint of flowers. The taste, however is somewhat soft, with a pleasing brown sugar, caramel, oak, and molasses flavor. Lots of grains and even a very light citrus hop profile. The beer has a very light, sessionable body and the finish has a lasting fade to it. Good balance. Not a bad purchase if you're looking for a low ABV Porter."

"Overall, this is typical of Sierra Nevada, good classically flavored examples that are well worth the time and money...but don't go beyond."
""
" The taste begins with roasted malt flavor like coffee with nuttiness and dry dark roasted character with mild sweetness in the middle augmenting with subtle fruity taste from the yeast which has a slight spice from the hops which adds a peppery complexity w/ nice chocolate accents in the dark malt profile with a mild woody element in the back. This is a classic porter as advertised -very delicious and drinkable -I love how balanced it is yet still presents a nice amount of hops with dark malt the star. One of the better west coast examples of the style."
""
""
"O - Didn't blow me away, but pleasant and very drinkable. Would make a solid session porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: A pretty good brew. I'm not too versed in the world of Porters just yet, but I like this one very well. It's light enough where I would open one up after a bit of yard work with no problem. Definitely good."

"This beer looks just as a porter should look. Dark blackish brown with a creamy, tan head. Nice aroma of roasted malts and chocolate. This has the potential to be an amazing beer but it needs a little tinkering. There is an extremely strong chocolatey taste to it, so much so that it almost overpowers the other flavors. As a chocolate lover, this still makes for a delicious beer, but a little less chocolate would allow the hops and malts to come through more powerfully. The chocolate itself is a little too chalky and sweet. If the brewers replaced it with a more subdued and silky dark chocolate, this porter would be perfect."

"notes: an amazing, asesome brew. Hoppier than most Porters I have tried, it is a delicious, unique interpretation of the style. No smoke like many of my favorite Porters but a bitter but clean finish that is amazingly creamy. This is a keeper."
"It's still an awesome beer. But the stout is world class while this one is just good."
""
"Ah, a fine, smooth and luscious dark ale that just hits the spot. Bold but not abrasive; very approachable. I will be checking this one out again..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a very dark brown with deep red highlights. A solid inch, khaki-colored head that went down to 1/4 inch. A good deal of malt, some chocolate, a bit of vanilla on the nose. This is a very drinkable porter, with a well-rounded taste: malt, more chocolate, a creamy, velvety smoothness that, for a porter, is significant. The sugars are nicely balanced. Some of the most beautiful lacing for a porter that I've seen in a while. A good beer for any season."

"I love this stuff! It's a little light, but not light on flavor!"
""
"This is light to medium bodied with a very crisp mouthfeel with lots of sharp carbonation. This is very tasty."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a nice black with a small white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Smells of coffee, chocolate, and dark roasted grain. Tastes of coffee and slight caramel and chocolate, very nice taste profile. Beer has a very nice full profile for its medium/heavy body and carbonation is right. Overall, a very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A solid session porter that I would never turn down, but I won't seek out again with more solid options like Edmund Fitz and Black Butte."
""
""
""
""

"Overall - This is a big beer. Bold. Complex. Crisp. Not as smooth as many of the English Porters. I like it! Has Sierra Nevada ever made a bad beer?"

"Amber color (kind of light for a porter) without much head. Roasted chocolaty aroma. Again, roasted chocolate and coffee come through with a hint of hops and earthiness. Tastes more like a ""indian porter."" Just a bit more carbonated than we would like."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"MF--chewy but very smooth and drinkable"
"The flavor profile has nice depth. There is a good solid roasted malt taste along with sutle chocolate and coffee. Sprite and spry hops brighten up the flavor as one might use a lemon in cooking. Very interesting. Drinks smooth and mellow and abit flat but is a good solid porter thats handsomely made."
""
""
""
""
""
"Sierra Nevada Porter is not trying to be anything really complex, just a great six-pack selection off the shelf. Works as a cool weather or cold weather beer to great effect. I will never turn this beer down, and I'd have trouble skipping ordering one if I ever see it on-tap. Unfortunately, I never see it on-tap. And, I'd like to. Starting now."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown and has a nice head that does not quite reach the top of the pint glass. Chocolate and some hop in the aroma. Hints of chocolate, coffee, a little roast some sweetness. Citrus hops, its well balanced. Finish is a little dry and only subtle bitterness. A good porter."
""
"O: This is not a bad beer at all, just one that seems watered down and unwilling to give us bold flavors."
""
""
""
""
"Overall an enjoyable porter that has a decent drinkability factor - a softer mouthfeel would make the beer slide down more easily or alternatively more roast and body would push the beer into the special occasion category; I found where it sits on the spectrum a little confusing, but in the end decided this is what makes it Sierra Nevada's and not someone else's and enjoyed the beer I drank. (If you are a slave to style I would say it's a little roasty to be a Brown Porter and not big enough to be a Robust version.)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from 12oz bottle into porter glass. Darker brown that lets some light through, with a thick full head that dissipated slowly leaving great chunky lacing. Smell is of bitter chocolate and coffee with a sweet malt pinch at the end of the sniff. Taste is not as bitter as the smell, a nice rounded coffee roasted taste with a malty backbone. This porter is not as dry as others I've had. It's a little different, but a pleasant surprise. Overall this is a very drinkable porter. Not outstanding in anyway, but a fine beer in and of itself."
""
"This one pours thick and dark. Heavy on the head with nice lacing and a sticky retention. Smells of chocolate malt, grassy grains, dark cherry, and toasted bread. The overall scent is not strong but is what you would expect out of a good porter. The beer tastes of bittersweet chocolate with a nice smoky backbone. There's definitely a dry, malty flavor reminiscent of a dry irish stout as well. It finishes with a hint of light hop bitterness but overall is well-balanced. The mouthfeel is light bodied and bubbly, somewhat frothy. Overall a nice well-balanced porter. You can always count on SN to deliver high quality stuff and this one is no different."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A travesty of a porter. Seriously bad. I guess Sierra Nevada can make a bad beer after all. Hopefully this is just a bad bottle and future bottles taste loads better."
""
""
"O - I've not yet had a subpar beer from Sierra Nevada, and the Porter is no exception. Satisfying brew for fall and winter."
"Taste is a really smooth, faint hit of dark chocolate up front that slides back into a finish that reveals much more of a hop presence than the aroma would indicate. In the middle of the whole thing is a bit of bite that black coffee has, but it integrates well with the aforementioned initial dark chocolate note and the finishing earthy hops. Carbonation is pretty damn high; at times this almost feels like the unquestionably amazing Pale Ale. I won't say that this is a bad thing, per se, but it's definitely a bit much for a porter. Nevertheless, the body is a medium-light hybrid, and it goes down really smoothly without falling prey to one-dimensionality."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was a nice beer to drink at midnight on New Year's Eve. It's a great winter brew to sip by the fire when it's 10 degrees fahrenheit (about -12 Celsius) outside. Happy New Year!"
""
""
""
""

"O- Not a bad Porter, would have again."
""
"Pours a dark brownish/black with rootbeer color highlights and a thick mocha head. The smell is roasted malt, some chocolate, coffee, and sweet notes as well. Very inviting, nice aroma. The taste starts with the chocolate and coffee, then finishes with the roasted malt and a hint of smokiness. Not as sweet as I would have expected, but very good. The mouthfeel is lighter than expected, a medium/light body, the thick head adds to the body but when that is gone the body seems ligther. A little bit heavier and this would be spot on. Overall a very well done porter, great flavor, and easy to enjoy."
""
""
""
""

"(EDIT:) I wasn't able to finish the final two sips so I just rinsed my glass and called it a night at that point. The tingle got annoying."

"Across the board, Sierra Nevada brews are SOLID. This is a great, basic porter and a nice example of the style. There are many porters I prefer to this one, and I would also take SN's stout over this, however it is still a great beer and something that I would by occasionally, especially with it's low price point."
""
""

"A pretty good porter, which is no surprise given the brand. Iâ€™d definitely have it again."

"O: After having their famous Pale Ale, i was expecting a little better, its certainly not bad or even close to being bad, just a little lacking on flavors and too much carbonation."
""
""
""
"I'd buy it again. Didn't blow me away, but the flavor was there. I'd prefer SN's stout, but this is a close second. Would be nice on a cool fall night."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours up a deep mahogany brown with a large caramel colored head and elaborate lacing. Smell is kind of smoky, pecans, and coffee. Mouthfeel is about average, not as thick as I would have expected but not thin either. Taste is kind of a roasted smoky nuttiness along with cola, coffee, and chocolate. A pretty good beer. But does Sierra Nevada really make any bad beers?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If I'm getting a dark beer from Sierra Nevada I'd have to go for the stout. This porter is really good, but the stout is, as the rating system indicates, ""world class."" The porter, to its credit, is lighter and hoppier."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is where this beer falls a bit short. I like my dark beers to have a really thick, velvety mouthfeel (think Stone's Imperial Russian Stout). This beer feels a bit thin. It's crisp and smooth, though, and doesn't linger long."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep coffee brown colour with creamy tan head that dissipated quickly. I might have had this too cold. Initial bready aroma that vanished with the head. Taste is rich coffee mocha, dark rye bread and some caramel. Moderate carbonation and a crisp mouthfeel leaving a little chewiness but otherwise clean palate with great bitter finish. Really nice Porter. Well balanced and great dinkability. Had this with a plate of dolmades. Yum."

"This porter is pretty damn close to being the perfect session beer. Everything is perfectly balanced, yet complex and delicious enough to leave me contemplating driving up to ABQ this instant to find another. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, yet creamy and the beer never comes off seeming weak. Worthy enough to join the ranks of other great porters such as Black Butte, and Edmund Fitzgerald, yet lighter bodied. This is one to come back to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep brown with a reddish hue and tan head. Chocolate and coffee smell lend themselves to a similar taste. This one has a stronger hop presence than other porters (as Sierra Nevada is wont to do), which may be a turn-off for some and a turn-on for others. Feel is pretty light for a porter, but given the hoppier character I think it works. It used to be a favorite, but having tried more beers since then, I've turned to this one a little less."

""
""
""
"I recommend this as the well made porter, and I think it works perfectly for those that are entering the craft beer addiction."
""
""

"O- A very nice porter. The flavor profile is about the same in their stout but overall not as good as the stout. This is by all means, a fine porter and worth getting."

""
""
""
""
""
"O- A great beer. Makes me wish I was closer to the brewery so I could enjoy all their styles: they never disappoint. Great cure for my post-workout nausea as well"
""
""
"I like Porters and have not found a lot of American brews that cause me to look forward. There are a couple of Canadian Stouts that have me really spoiled so my hopes were not high."

"So what do you listen to with this classic west coast style Porter? Well i recommend a modern classic west coast composer ... Lou Harrison's Gamelon CD!"

""
""
""

""
"Top stuff for the ABV."
""

"O- Pretty interesting porter (at least for one who's used to drink english porters), brings a nice amount of american hoppiness, but still has that classic porter feeling. perfect balance and good drinkability. Much more refreshing than what i was expecting from a porter, kind of fits as a summer dark beer"

"Bottle to dixie cup after some softball. Pours black with a nice fluffy cream colored head. Aroma starts with coffee and roasted grain, with a bit of hops in the background. Roasty flavor, but slightly watered down, some earthiness, low sweetness. Not a bad porter, but could use a bit of work. Good intro to the style from Sierra."
"(originally reviewed: 10-25-2011)"

""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I really wanna love Sierra's porter (their stout as well), but I can't. It's too hoppy. Not enough deep notes of roasted malt, and what is there gets dominated by the high hop presence. If I want a hop dominant beer, I'll grab an IPA or strong ale... why you'd do this to a porter is beyond me. As a beer it's good. As a porter, it fails. This is closer to a CDA than anything."

"I've had so many mediocre porters over the years. And to think, all this time, Sierra Nevada Porter has just been sitting on the shelf, readily available. This is not going to blow any minds, but it's the definition of solid. If more porters were more like this, I bet the style would be more popular."
"Good stuff."

"Pretty impressive...sorry I waited so long to try it."
""
""
""

"Overall this has now got to be one of my top five beers. Something I will come back to every so often and savor again. I will reiterate in saying that I just turned 21, so my experience with different beers is lacking so others might know of better porters than this. I've tried the Anchor Porter as well and while that one was good, SN's porter brought more to the table in terms of what I expected a good porter to taste like. I'm used to Keystone and Bud Light, so this is shaping up to be a very interesting brew exploration experience for me to say the least."

"This was not what I was expecting. I was hoping for a bitter porter, rather than a semi-sweet one. Four finger white head when poured correctly which leaves elegant lacing. The beer tastes of the two-row malt, and chocolate. I would call this an ok beer from an outstanding brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a glass mug. Pours deep bround with an abundant, rich tan head that dissipates, leaving some sticky lacing on the side of the glass. The smell is of dark roasted malt, chocolate, and some hops. The flavor is quite robust and bittersweet. The flavors of dark roasted malt, chocolate, and hops are well-balanced. The body is medium and very smooth. The carbonation is not strong, which helps the smoothness of this beer. It's very drinkable. Overall, this is an excellent and enjoyable porter that I could easily session."

"Overall - Easily one of my favorite beers, especially considering its availability and price. A perfect beer to sip on in the evening."

"Porter pours a very dark color, with a nice tan head. There is a nice strong nutty smell, with hints of choclate, on a smokey malty backbone. The taste has a nice sweet taste, full of nut, and cholcate flavors, then finishes bitter, with just a tad of a hoppy taste, and coffee flavors. Nice complex flavor, but very full, and easy to drink. Overall this is a fantastic porter, one of my favorites."

"Pours a deep dark brown color with small size tan head. Aroma has notes of roasted barley, chocolate, and a touch of caramel. Taste is of roasted malts, coffee, and piney, spicy hops. Mouthfeel is medium and smooth. Overall drinkability is good and an enjoyable porter."
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass this is a wonderful looking beer. It pours black with a thick head that doesn't dissipate quickly. The smell may be my favorite thing about this beer. It smells roasted and chocolatey. The taste is exactly as a porter should be. Definitely a high quality brew from Sierra Nevada. I highly recommend this one."
""
""
""
"Pours black with some ruby highlights, a moderate sized tan colored head and good lacing. Aroma is chocolate and coffee roast and a bit of dark fruits. Taste starts out with a some caramel sweetness followed by roasted malt with a coffee like bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium."
""
""
"an excellent porter. robust, dark, and drinkable. pours a nearly black chocolate color with a tall and frothy off white head. smells richly roasted, hints of coffee and cocoa. flavor is great, really nice malt complexity and smoothness. the feel is exceptional as well, perfectly carbonated, highly sessionable. a dark beer with a full body that isnt filling in any way. i enjoyed this with a maple mango glazed mahi mahi on the grill, and it stood up well the smokeyness of the fish, but wasnt overpoweringly roasty to wash out the subtleties of the food. everything a good porter should be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very pleasant. It's pretty mild and sessionable but the hint of ash gives it some nice character. And it's otherwise rich and delicious. Comes across as their stout pulled back a bit on the ash. These guys show up to work and casually turn out solid artistry. No frills, just solid craft that lets you know they know what they're doing to a serious depth."
"O: A decent, enjoyable porter. The flavors are subtle and well-balanced, and it doesn't blow me away, but it's good all around."
""

"O: Early on in my beer drinking career, before I was reviewing and really got into craft, I bought a case of this beer. I loved it then but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve had it since, until now. This is a truly underrated porter and beer in general. The drinkability of this is through the roof."
"Pours a dark brown almost black color with a off white creamy head and good lacing on the glass. Aroma is of roasted malt, chocolate, and caramel malts. Taste is very much the same with a forefront caramel sweetness followed by a roasty finish. Well balanced and a good porter."
"Pours to a very dark ruby/brown color with a small light brown head. Nose is straight roasted malts and a little chocolate. Taste is more bitter than the aroma would suggest. Roasted coffee and bitter dark chocolate. Medium weight, lively carbonation. Lightly sweet on the finish with big smoke on the aftertaste."
""
""
"O- I enjoyed this porter. It was a very solid brew with a nice flavor. Although I like this beer I seem to like BB porter much more from what I remember."
""
""
""
"O - Well, to say I was mildly disappointment would be an understatement. By no means terrible, it's just a very mild ale compared to what I'm used to from Sierra Nevada. Certainly easy drinking and flavourful, but they could have easily amped it up a notch without offending any of their fans."
""
"Overall, this is another winner from Sierra Nevada. Nothing exceptional, but just a good all round porter. Perfect for anyone who is getting into porters or craft beer. Definitely recommended and absolutely worth a try."
""

"D/O: This porter seems at first take like a good candidate for the archetypal model, then the hops begin to stand out. This beer is not hop-focused, but it deviates from the English tradition in the quality of the hop flavors that are presented early. As described above this beer tastes distinctly floral, with more traditional earthy flavors developing secondarily. It is a worthwhile contribution to the style in its own right; a fair balance between interest and approachability is struck."

"Overall - One of the better porters I've sampled so far. Lots of flavor and complexity but nothing too bold and overpowering. Another fine beer by SN."

""
""
""
"This is an above average porter. The roasted malts is not too overpowering. Is one of the better beers I've had."
"O â€“ A solid offering by SN, but nothing memorable or spectacular, and definitely not enough here to elevate this over other easily accessible porters such as Anchor Porter, and Stone Smoked Porter. Still, not bad at all."
""
"Nice."
"Pours a dark black color, with a medium head. Aroma is roasty malts. A medium bodied porter. More chocolate than coffee in the nose. This beer is also a little hoppier than most porters. Smooth taste. A nice drinkable porter, nothing fantastic, just consistently good. Mouthfeel is full and round."
""
"Only a medium body and not as much stickiness in the mouth as you might find in other Porter. Carbonation starts off a little sharp but settles easily."

"Overall, this is much closer to a Brown Porter than a Robust example of the style, though my bottle might be dated. It's not as bold, coffee-like, and ashy as most other American porters but the roasted/chocolate flavours and mild hop kick are quite enjoyable. A tasty drinker that's easy to knock back."

"Overall I thought this was an OK beer and it was a slightly above average American Porter. It had most of those good porter flavors but it wasn't as robust as some of my favorites and the hops were a little heavy for a Porter. This beer had OK drinkability, I could probably go for another one but after that I would be ready to move on to something different. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance, it was a very good looking Porter. What I liked least about this beer was that the malts weren't robust enough to overpower the hops and the high amount of carbonation needed to be toned down a little. I might buy this beer again, but in the wide world of Porters this one doesn't stick out that much, but it was well priced. If you love Porters this is worth a try but I don't think that this beer will knock your socks off. To me this beer falls in the middle when it comes to American Porters, there was nothing too out of place, but to me the flavors didn't come together as well as they do in some of the better Porters. I am glad I finally tried this beer, but it's not that memorable of a Porter."
"O: This porter looked fantastic, but I was a bit disappointed by everything else about it. Still, above average, but I liked the Walker's Reserve better."
"A somewhat thin, highly carbonated porter. But, the flavor is excellent overall. Not as dark and opaque as many porters. This has a semi-transparent brown/ruby color. Lots of bubbles dissipate the head rather quickly. Smells of coffee, semi-sweet dark chocolate, cocoa, rich toasty malt and slight hops. Mouthfeel is a bit slight, but it packs good flavor. Spiky, coarse carbonation. Raisiny chocolate, powdery cocoa with a dry hops finish and lingering malt presence. Some coppery flavors appear in the aftertaste department, but the malty richness makes this beer rewarding overall. I'd like to try this on tap, but I have never seen it except in bottles. A very good beer. Sierra never really falters in my experience."
""
"Overall: An excellent, albeit mild scented, porter. Definitely will be picking up a case of this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Your classic porter appearance here - dark brown, almost black, with a real thick tan head. Tight carbonation bubbles. The nose is pretty minimal. Roast and malt, but not a lot going on. The taste has some citrusy/bitter hoppiness to it, combined with the classic porter roast, malts, and chocolate traits. Really nice blend and very sessionable. Smooth."
""
"T: A really great porter. Great balance between the roasted malts and earthy hops with some powdery chocolate and a dry finish with hints of smoke. Really glad I finally tried this one."
""
""
"Overall, this is a smooth and flavorful, but one-dimensional, porter."
""
""
"A nice porter, but nothing amazing or overly special. The over carbonation detracts from it. It's got some good flavors and aromas, but again, it's nothing so extraordinary."
"Overall, the carbonation is distracting, but it is not a bad Porter."
""
""
"Overall I had Sierra Navada's Pale Ale and hefeweizen but this Porter is far above them All Period."

"This beer has a great balance of hop and malt flavor. Is really one of the best tastes I have had in a porter. Also, there is a small hint of coffee and/or chocolate that does overbear the good taste of porter, yet really adds to that flavor. Overall, this is one of my favorite porters. Luckily it comes from a widely distributed brewery and is relatively available compared to other porters."

""
"Porters aren't my *favorite* style, but Sierra Nevada can do no wrong in my eyes, and this is a great beer."
""
"Overall, this is probably one of the best tasting porters I've come across."
"Pours an almost opaque dark brown with a 1 inch puffy khaki head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. A thick curtain of foam coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, caramel, and toffee. Taste is of dark roasted malt and some toffee flavors. A mild roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty solid porter that is easy to drink."
"Really a terrific beer. Sierra Nevada is the master of so many styles, and their porter really is no exception. There are bigger more exciting porters out there, but for a non-barrel aged/imperial/chutney porter, this one is a complete winner. Essentially the older brother of Tumbler."

"very dark brown, but not quite black.  off white head.  aroma is a touch sweet - a touch of milk chocolate.  same with the taste - not a huge amount of roast flavor.  medium body, lower carbonation."

"O: Definitely a good solid porter with a flavor all its own, not your normal sweet porter because it does have a nice slight hop profile. I recommend this beer to sweet dark beer appreciators."
"Nice porter from SN but not their strongest style"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark amber to brown with a layer of off white head. The smell is mild with some roasted malt, dark fruit, and molasses. The flavor is bolder, but still not very powerful. Roast and dark fruit with a slight grain sweetness in the finish. The finish is roasty but mild. The mouthfeel is medium with lots of smooth carbonation."

"Bottled early August, 2011 A: pours dark brown with a finger of tannish foam which falls over a couple minutes to a sheet of the same. Spotty lace. Limited clarity. (3) S: Nice sweet dry black malt comes up accented with cocoa, coffee and hazelnut. (4) T: Nice and bready with toasted oat flavor and some slight sheet grass. Just a hint of nuts and cereal. (4) M: Creamy and full bodied with moderate, yet prickly carb. Semi slick finish. (4) O: Well done, as usual from SN. Great porter. (4)"
"Overall an good American porter. Dry, roasty and easy drinking."
"if i'm a sailor, i'm there."
"Still a great beer, but if given a choice, in the future I'll focus on their stout!"
"I've been turned off of porters for a while, after drinking some subpar examples. I think this one has turned me back on to the style."
"This is a highly drinkable lightweight porter but it fails to deliver on the roasted malty taste I look for in this style. Perhaps a good introductory selection to porters but will fail to excite more adventurous drinkers."
"Excellent beer! It is very stout like with lots of malts. It has a very dark appearance which fits well with this style of beer. It has a very nice smell of sweet coffee like malts wit a finish of hops. It taste great almost as if you were eating candy. It has a light mouthfeel which makes this an all around good beer!"
"Overall Drinkability - Decent."
"This is a very drinkable, well-balanced Porter that is often overlooked. Perhaps a little too strong for a session, but I could enjoy a few of these. Recommended."
"overall i find this one to be a relatively tasty, above average porter. nothing crazy delicious."
"Overall: Another solid offering from SN!"
"O - Lots of coffee and chocolate in this one. Sure you get your roasted grain profile but when it comes down to it the coffee is dominant with a chocolate side kick. Hops is integrated well. Just enough to keep the coffee in its place and give a little balance."
"Overall, this is a solid example of the American Porter style. It's an above average brew that doesn't try to do too much. It is what it is, and I like when they keep it simple."
"Even though I only bought one bottle, it would be easy to down quite a few in a sitting. Now that the weather is cooling off, I may give this a go again. It's mellow and the alcohol was barely discernible - good signs that this Porter, like a lot of SN's other offerings, has a lot going for it!"
"O - Nicely balanced Porter with all the characteristics typical of the style."
"O - have always enjoyed this American porter. But hadn't had it for a while. I walked away from this last one wanting more. Just seemed even better this time around. You won't be disappointed at all from this porter. Every part of the SN porter is extremely good and enjoyable. An underrated Am. Porter IMO. It's easy going, but still offers unbelievable flavor. Have never had any complaints with This brew or Sierra Nevada and that holds true still to this day. One of my favorite American porters."
"Very dark with 2 finger head that dwindles down to a nice ring around my jar. The lacing is very good on this brew. Deep dark malt with hoppy earth notes as well. Maybe a hint of alcohol? Big maltiness up front. A walnut shell bitterness that melds into a dry mildly hop laden finish. Porter isn't one of my favorite styles, but I like this one."
"This is a great porter if youâ€™re looking for a brew that goes beyond the typical roasted malts and dark fruits. Yet another great offering from Sierra Nevada."
"O - Very enjoyable beer, very drinkable. Tends to border on Dry Stout territory. I will still seek this one out when ever I can."
"Overall - A good solid porter. No wow factor, but nothing bad at all either, another good style representative from Sierra Nevada."
"This is solid, balanced, drinkable porter. One of my favorites in the style."
"O- Pretty solid. I haven't had a bad beer from this company and I don't think I ever will"
"O- A very solid porter with nice roasty accents and a bold toffee taste. Sierra Nevada's lineup of year round beers is outstanding with their stout, kellerweis, pale ale, and now this one."
"This is a good all around choice for a Porter."
"Overall, a great Porter. Greater when you're sitting by the fire too."
"O: a very nice, easy drinking, smooth porter. i would have liked to see a bit more depth to it as well as a little bit more thickness, I like porters to be heavier than this but it is still a very good, highly drinkable brew."
"O: This beer goes down very easily and is quite sessionable."
"Overall: Overall this brew is middle of the road. Itâ€™s nothing out of the ordinary and is pretty drinkable, but when it comes to craft beer Iâ€™m looking for something a little more interesting and for that reason I might advise folks to spend your hard earned cash on a more prominent porter or stout."
"Overall I think this is what we all should be looking for in a standard, off the shelf Porter. I generally drink these out of the bottle and that is what makes this so great. No reason to get fancy shmancy. This is also a great beer to take to a get together. You can drink it out of the bottle and leave the rest of the six pack in the fridge and none of the BMC people will bother it."
"Overall: This a a nice American Porter that is tasty and easy drinking but it could of been a little more bold with the chocolate and coffee taste."
"a well crafted ale as expected from sierra nevada but not among my favorite porters. i like a bolder thicker porter."
"Drinkability: This is a good session brew to have in the fall sitting around a campfire. Just reminds you of a nice fall evening with good friends."
"Overall: This is a very respectable beer. I have a lot of respect for Sierra Nevada due them pretty much getting me into the craft beer world. A sold porter that I see myself revisiting again."
"On the lighter side of robust porter, very drinkable but lighter than I like my porters. More malt and more body would be an improvement."
"O - Porter is a style I usually find unappealing, but there are exceptions (e.g., Rogue Mocha Porter; Sam Adams Holiday Porter) that I like alot. This beer is not among those at the top of my list, but is a very good porter that I would be happy to have again."
"This pours a dark brown with a mocha head. I get lots of coffee and roasted malts and some other sweet malts. The body is medium. The taste is pretty good, I get a light taste at first semi sweet followed by lots of roasted malts and coffee. Overall this is a pretty good beer, but most of the time I just go for the SN Stout over this."
"Some of these rolled into the liquor store at Mairiano's grocery store, so I tried these again. Pours out a dark brown color, very rich mahogany but not black. Beer has a nice sticky brown head. The smell is rich chocolate malt, with some dark toffee. No detectible hops in the nose but all roasty malt. The taste is more roasty malts, and lots of chocolate malts. Not as hoppy as I would expect from a SN brew, would think there would be a bigger Cascade presence but that's okay...I actually feel this is a more authentic interpretation of the style. The taste brings more sweet chocolate malts too; probably because there is no big bitter hop aftertaste. Anyway, the mouthfeel is full and rich. Overall this is a somewhat unique offering from SN in that the chocolate malts really shine through. Although I look forward to trying their other darker beers again, i.e Tumbler, and their hoppier Stout."
"Nice brew yet nothing special."
"Overall this is one of my go to beers that never lets me down."
"I am embarrassed to say this is my first Sierra Nevada Porter, but it won't be my last. I'll be seeking this one out in the future."
"Beer is medium in body and overall nice. It is an interesting and pleasantly sweet beer with a mild roast at the end. Overall easy drinking and a fine beer. I'd have it again and I have had it on several occasions."
"O: A decent porter. Given the availability and price you really can't go wrong. Expected more from Sierra Nevada but they definitely didn't disappoint."
"O: Sierra Nevada has come to the dark side, and I like it. I donâ€™t know if this will ever be a regular purchase for me, as Flying Dog Gonzo and olâ€™ Sam Smith remain my first choice when it comes to porters. I can see myself getting a six-pack some time down the road, though; for $9, how could I not?"
"Appearance 4/5; Aroma 3/5; Taste 3/5; Mouthfeel 4/5; Overall 3/5"
"This is quite an excellent porter. It is well balanced between malt and hops with neither being overpowering. A great example of the style, would make an excellent introduction to the style for beginners."
"O: This is the first Porter I ever had and I can see after trying a few, that I was lucky to start off with such a good example of the style."
"Sierra Nevada continues to impress. I dont think any brewer can match them for combo of quantity and quality of total beer yielded. My 2nd favorite SN offering (celebration first). This is what porters are suppose to be."
"O: This is a well made and generally tasty porter. Worth a shot."
"I poured a 2 yrs old expired porter into a young's glass. I was testing to see if it would hold out. This is what happened It appeared dark brown to light black in color. It smelled like roasted coffee. It tasted creamy, espresso coffee. it was easy going down. I'm definitely surprise how well it held. This beer was very nice but i think I need to drink a fresh one to give a real review."
"O: A good beer, though the first porter I have tried ever, so I've got nothing to go off of."
"M: Balance but in general not sweetness turning a little more bitter at the end with good medium lasting ending."
"Overall a decent porter... although I've had better. Probably nothing I'd ever buy again unless I find it at a super discounted price."
"Overall-Great beginner porter. I wish I tried this a while back."
"O: a solid overall porter with no real memorable quality otherwise. Easy to drink."
"A very easy to drink beer. I can think of a few easy drinking porters that beat this, but it still hits near the top."
"A tasty, simple, American porter. A definitive version of the style."
"GOOD, WORTH TRYING!"
"Overall, everyone thought this beer was the blandest of the bunch. It's definitely drinkable and there are no bad flavors like there were with Taddy and Anchor, but there is almost nothing of interest in this. Consensus 4th of 6, with two people rating it last for absolute lack of character."
"A bit light in the mouthfeel. Overall, this is the type of porter I really like. Will enter my regular rotation of porters with Founders for sure. Highly recommend."
"A little more chocolate in the taste, but still leans more roasty. It's not dry, but it is not sweet either, right about in the middle. Leafy hops contribute a bit of bitterness. Yeast contributes some nutty and bread flavors but shies away from any fruit. This is a very well balanced porter that does everything well, if not spectacularly. Cant go wrong with a sixer of this, I try to buy one or two each year."
"O- worthy porter. Nice balance of maltand hops and sweetness."
"O-Very interesting take on a porter. Actually refreshing considering the style. Nice surprise."
"O- This is a very easy drinking porter. They kept it simple and it works."
"The mouthfeel is about average for the style and carbonation is moderate. Overall it was a pretty nice version of the style. The malty flavors really shined in it and the darker, roasty malts gave some nice flavor as well as balance. Solid beer overall for the style."
"Drinkability: Just the right carbonation for me. The smooth mouthfeel and good balance of bittersweet and roasty flavors, coupled with a final crispness makes this a simple but solid porter."
"Overall, a great Sierra Nevada concoction and worthy of a try."
"There really isn't much wrong with this beer. A good aroma, nice flavors and easy to drink. It really is a textbook porter. And that may be the one that's off with it, it's just your standard porter with nothing really jumping out to make it memorable or unique. I've had it dozens of times and I don't think I'd be able to pick it out in a blind taste test. Don't get me wrong, it's easily enjoyable, just not anything to go out of your way for."
"12oz bottle. Pours a very dark brown, almost black color with an inch of white head. Tons of lacing. Aroma is of roasted malts, hints of chocolate, and a bit earthy. Taste is mostly the roasted malts. Earthy and chocolate as well as some breadiness. Medium bodied and pretty easy to drink. Overall, its a decent Porter. Sierra Nevada doesn't put out many bad beers, if any. This one is worth grabbing again."
"Seriously, I have lately had some fantastic American porters and after drinking this... this is just barely average. Sierra Nevada makes some great beers but this is not one of them, I'll pass."
"O: Goes down easily, very tasty, not too filling, mild kick, solid representation of style. This isn't a blow your mind away porter... but it's one that is definitely a go to beer. It is very easy to sit with for an evening (and a hockey playoff game)."
"I have yet to be let down by any SN offering and this one is no exception. I enjoyed this very much and would reccomend this all day long."
"O - A good beer from a great brewery. No real complaints with this porter. A solid base for the style. It goes really nicely with nutty foods, such as peanuts or mushrooms, or a roast."
"Pours a dark brown color with a medium, light-tan head that disappears quickly. Scent is very chocolate forward with a light hint of black licorice. A bit of roasted malt aromas as well. Taste is initially coffee with some roasted flavors. Then I get chocolate with burnt malt and a tiny bit of toffee and vanilla. Finishes with a lot of maltiness. Mouthfeel is a bit on the light side...would like to see this more full-bodied. Drinkability is high, as this is a tasty porter. Overall, this is not the best porter, but it is very good."
"Overall: Pretty standard run of the mill porter. Not great but not bad, a nice standard porter."
"O: This doesn't stack up to some of my other gold standards of the style: Founders Porter, Deschutes Black Butte Porter, Anchor Porter. Not that it's a bad beer, but it's certainly a step below."
"The mouthfeel touches on being a bit too cola-like at times, but overall maintains a nice easy and enjoyable drinkability and is a decent porter."
"Color is a very dark brown to almost black. Its cream-colored head is thick and long lasting, a nice looking beer. Scent is roasted malts and a hint of citrus. The taste follows the smell, which is quite good - roasted malts up front, with a touch of grapefruity bitterness in the finish. A nicely balanced beer."
"O - this is a great introductory porter. If you want to introduce someone to porters this would be a great start. I am moving on to something a little more substantial."
"I'm guessing that Porter/Stout fans would be looking for something a bit stronger, but I loved the beer. I'll most definitely be buying more next fall and winter. Totally drinkable and a nice treat."
"O= really good solid porter here, I would drink this regularly. Beer is just what I expected from SN."
"Overall very good - certainly another win for Sierra Nevada."
"O: Pretty good, solid representation of the style. Easy drinking. Nothing about it stands out, but there is nothing wrong with it either."
"O: OK....but not spectacular. Wanted to make this a regular at it's price and availability. I'll spend a few bucks more for more taste."
"I love porters; accordingly, I embrace and adore the exceptional ones. Yet, I still reach out to those porters that are just basic - but damn fine ones endowed with an unpretentious decency. This little gem from Sierra Nevada is that."
"Overall, this was a nice porter. Not heavy in comparison to most and not watery. This is great if you want a dark beer that isnt going to fill you up."
"I really like a more coffee porter than chocolate, but the way everything came together in this one was great, the wheat and chocolate with just a gentle hop bite...Lets go with a hop kiss because its not to much or not enough its just right. I prefer Anchors porter when it comes to APs, but I have to take this one seriously, its too good to look over. I gave it a 3.5 on A&S, I felt the nose and look were not that impressive, I've seen that bubbly brown too much which is kind of rude considering this has a ""True Porter Color," also the nose was very unimpressive. Pick this one up, there's a lot of reasons you should, especially the smokey aftertaste, very very pleasant beer. Also i'm super excited to try the SN Stout. Stay thirsty my friends."
"Overall I'd say it's a decent beer but nothing that I'll reach for in a hurry. Meh."
"Drink- A great intro porter for anyone looking for one. I can't believe I never had this before. Learn something new everyday."
"Overall - I thought it was decent. Nothing to write home about. Honestly, for a porter, I found it a bit weak, both in smell and flavor. The roasted malt seemed to drown out any other discernible scent or taste. Best thing about this was how drinkable it was."
"If this beer had some sort of a body to it it would be so much better. As it is I just can't get over how thin the body is compared to the flavors. Carbonation is good at least. Drinkability is good thanks to the finish, but not great thanks to the mouthfeel. I guess being thin and watery could help drinkability for some, but I prefer malt-forward beers to have bodies to match."
"This is a solid porter from a very good brewery. I'm not much for porters usually, but I liked this one. It had a nice roasted malt flavor to it. Mouthfeel was good and the carbonation seemed right on. I felt it finished a little on the bitter side for my taste, but overall was a very solid beer."
"Overall - Was hoping for more robust brew here with a thicker body. First Sierra Nevada beer I didn't fall for right off the bat, go try one and see for yourself."
"I think I may have just found my new porter of choice."
"Tasted a lot like any other Porter I've had in the past. At least this is a slightly different change of pace for Sierra Nevada. This brew shows that there is more to SN than just Pale Ales and IPA's. This beer pour a rich dark brown with a foamy light brown head. The roasted malts are nicely balanced in this with the hops used in the brew."
"O (D) - Not bad by any means, but this isn't quite what I think of as the quintessential porter. It's a bit too sweet."
"Interestingly enough, I found a 2 year old bottle of this and it completely matches my review of the fresh version. The stuff holds up pretty well for a 5.6% beer."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - As stated; not complex but executed well. The most light bodied and downable porter I've ever come across. I don't think this classifies as a sipper; but definitely more of an easy-drinker. I enjoyed this one a lot despite it being so average in taste. Not getting many notes of hops throughout this beer; although they seem more noticeable on the crisp, dry finish."
"O: It is very drinkable but too citrusy to enjoy as a porter. I liken it more to a Black IPA (or whatever it's called)."
"Solidly dark brown with maybe the slightest amber hint. Thick and fluffy off-white head.Good head retention and lacing. Plenty of carbonation. Roasty malt aroma but not much else. A good malt flavor with just a hint of crisp, floral hops. A bit nutty or bready with roasted character. Medium dry with a crisp but smooth mouthfeel. Overall a nice porter, good with a hearty meal as any porter should be."
"Finish: Roosted malts, small amount of a bitter hop"
"D: pretty roasty. my only real complaint is how dry the finish is. i would love the roast to stick around a little longer."
"Flavor is rich and coffee-ish, with a hint of hops (to balance the sweetness) lingering in the finish. Superbly balanced brew, and a perfect example of a porter done right."
"Pours dark brown with very little head or lacing and a good swirl doesn't bring anything up. The nose is very mild chocolate and roast plus some residual sweetness. The taste is quite bland. THere is some mild chocolate up front followed by light sweetness and a bit of roast. Body is medium with a fairly-full finish. Not quite enough carbonation, however. A bit disappointing, but this finishes up the ""Top Beers - Beers of Fame"" for me. Would like to try every beer on the site with at least 1000 reviews."
"D - Best part of the beer - you could drink 5 of these before you realized it."
"The mouthfeel is a nice, full porter body, and the drinkability is quite good, even if it drinks a bit stronger than it's ABV would indicate. I really like Sierra Nevada Porter. It's just a well-crafted, easy drinking porter that's available at a great price. Don't overlook it."
"m/d - thin body is a slight contrast to the 5.6% alcohol but makes for easy drinking. flavor lingers. Easy to drink, very solid brew by SN that probably gets overlooked by a lot of people (including myself up till now!)"
"Overall a nice porter with the flavors one would expect form a brew of this style. Definitely a classic brew here..."
"D - Fantastic Porter...looking forward to many more."
"D - decent porter overall, especially for the cost (8.99 for a 6 pack here). Could easily put away a couple of these any time."
"Drinkability: It's a good beer but not a good porter. It is just average in the style. I can definitely drink it because its inoffensive."
"D: This 3 doesn't mean bad; it just means average. Nothing is really drawing me to this beer to either continue drinking or be excited that more is left in my glass. Lots of other porters out there that I'd rather have."
"The CPJ"
"Overall i wanted more this is a very average porter"
"D-Rather drinkable, although not a seasonal beer a decent cold night brew."
"Picked up a single at Trader Joe's for a buck or two. Poured into a stemmed beer glass. Dark brown color with red highlights. Moderate sized white head, and plenty of lacing on the glass. Smell had a pleasant coffee aroma to it. Flavor varied at times. When cold out of the fridge, it had a roasted espresso bean flavor. But as it warmed up, it turned more towards a milk chocolate flavor. Both were not too bad. Mouthfeel was smooth yet substantial for a porter. Easy beer to drink, with low abv, great taste and a mellow body. A relative deal for the price."
"All in all, a very nice example of the style, and one heck of a beer. Have long enjoyed their stout, but this is my first time trying the porter. Awfully glad I went for the change of pace tonight."
"I feel terrible rating Sierra Nevada so poorly but wow this really is a stinker, I would recommend almost any porter over this one. I'm glad I got it in a make your own six pack so I don't have to give away five."
"I'm a huge fan of Serra Nevada but this porter is not good. I had it a few years ago and didn't like it and I still don't like it."
"Drinkability: Due to the ligering hops and carbonation, the burnt coffee flavor keeps coming and lingers smack dab in the middle of the tongue."
"Drinkability: Definitely the least impressive beer I've ever had from Sierra Nevada, and I likely won't be picking this one up again; weak nose and weaker flavors."
"The body is medium with mild but ample carbonation. Overall it's extremely smooth and the finish is very clean with only a slightly sticky dry finish. One of the best porters I've tried."
"Deep brown with lots of amber when held to light. Dense off-white head with decent retention. Floral and earthy hops balance out the chocolate malt in the nose. Palate is rich in roasted coffee and cocoa with a bit of caramel and toffee. A shade on the bitter side in the finish. Medium bodied with a slightly creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is pretty high and lively. Pretty good American Porter that is very drinkable."
"The liquid was dark brown with red hues in the light, there was a 1 finger, light tan head that was filmy and hugged the glass. It smells like roasted coffee beans with a little bit of chocolate and a very light citrus hop scent. Tastes similar to the smell but with a few different elements. First you get some bitterness on the back of the tongue, it transitions to a roasty coffee flavor and finishes with a slight piney hop bite. It's light-medium bodied with lots of carbonation that compliments the beer nicely and has a dry finish. I think this is the easiest drinking porter I've ever had. I really like this one."
"Drinakbility: Fair"
"Very pleasant session drink if you're a fan of porter/stout. The overall taste is more subdued than I initially expected but as a session beer it's very good."
"Aroma is strong and smoky with malty and molasses components. It pours a dark, somewhat hazy mahogany with a fairly thick, fine-bubbled, pale tan head that leaves some good lacing. Mouth-filling aroma has tones of burnt wood, hops, molasses, coffee and unsweet chocolate. Texture is fairly smooth and fizzy, leaving a smoky and somewhat hoppy finish that sticks around for a little bit."
"Drinkability is high for me due to how light this porter is."
"Decent toffee-malt blend that left me wanting more flavor. Would try again on tap because I've generally heard good things about this porter."
"D - Excellent example of a Porter, and easily sessionable."
"D: I could drink a few of these next to the fire."
"From notes at Old Chicago (2002): Pours a dark brown with a thick, tan head that stays forever. Aromas of roasted malts and some chocolate. Has a strong flavor of caramel, coffee beans, and some malt. Has a very thick, full-bodied mouthfeel that is wonderful to experience."
"Overall-- well done Sierra Nevada... This is a very enjoyable beer. This is an easy drinking porter: plenty of flavor, good body, and a solid nose.... I will try to open myself up to more porters on the off-chance I find more like this."
"Overall: See drinkability."
"D: A great tasting beer. I like Porters & Stouts & this is one that I would recommend. Not my favorite but one I wouldn't mind reaching for. For me it's a 7 out of 10. Prosit!"
"All-in-all an above average porter. A great cool or cold weather beer. Clear, dark brown, but with enough transparency to be barely see through. Tons of lace and good head retention. Aroma is subdued, malty with coffee and a bit of spiciness. The most enjoyable aspect of this porter is it mouthfeel. The carbonation is just enough to excite your tastebuds, the body is medium, but leans towards the heavy, and the finish is rich and full. Good balance between malt and hops with neither predominating, although the bitterness wins out in the finish."
"Smell is chocolate with roasted malt. Before tasting, this has the look and smell of a solid porter. Taste doesn't disappoint, there is everything you expect in a porter, with a bit more pronounced hops, not nearly as notable as FFF Alpha Klaus, but I don't think they are going for that. This is on my short list of porters for certain."
"Poured a deep brown, nearly black, with strong deep reddish hue. Started with a strong off-white head that leaves ample wet lacings and reduces to a full cap throughout. Sweet chocolate and toasted malt aromas. Medium bodied with rich carbonation in the middle that push the hop flavors through. Taste mirrors the aroma in the beginning, sweet chocolate and toasted malt that lead to a light coffee flavor. Once the hint of coffee hits the carbonation rolls though, pulling the citrus flavors forward. A slightly dry finish. Does Sierra Nevada make a beer that isn't dangerously drinkable?"
"D - Very pleasant example of an American porter, which would work well on its own or as a session beer."
"A pretty good, if simple, porter. Pours deep dark brown with red highlights and a quickly dissipating head. Cocoa aroma. Cocoa, malty and burnt sugar flavors with a hint of orange. Somewhat over-carbonated. Crisp clean finish. No particular outstanding characteristics, but overall a good offering. Would drink it again, but not necessarily chase after it."
"Sierra Nevada Porter pours a full black, with plentiful ruby highlights coming through when the beer is backlit. The bone colored head rises to three fingers in height, but doesn't hold up for very long. Several nice looking rings of lacing are left clinging to the side of the glass. The nose is fairly straightforward, lots of coffee and roasted malts. The beer could stand to be a little more aromatic though. There's a bit more to this beer though, as a hint of dark chocolate joins coffee in the intro. The dry roasted malt middle begins to come across as unpleasantly astringent to me. It's joined by a small but noticeable hop bitterness that leads into a very nice subtle orange-citrus close. The boy is somewhat light for the style, a reflection of just how dry it is. Given that, I think it's just a little overcarbonated for a relatively malt driven beer, the end result being the hops maybe elevated to too prominent a place (moreso in the bitterness fueling any sense of acridity mid palate). Overall Sierra Nevada Porter is a solid offering, but not my favorite American porter."
"D- Very good. The hops made me nervous at first but a well balanced beer. Cheers!"
"Brilliant ruby edges painted on the nearly black beer; lacing is nothing less than superb. Chocolate, toasted bread and earthy hop in the aroma. Tight, crisp package. Dry malt palate for the most part; roasty, with mocha and over-toasted bread. Hops are there to balance, and that is what they do--of course, there is some flavor in tow with hints of earth, wood and citrus rind. Roasty malt finish; a note of alcohol makes its mark as well. This is definitely a go-to Porter."
"Velvety smooth body but doesn't drink too thick."
"D: A well made porter but it is missing the wow factor. Maybe a little more hopped than I prefer but it still is one worth trying."
"Pours a deep translucent brown with a very compact, good-looking, fluffy egg-white head. Head retention is very strong; lacing is full and gorgeous. Smell is malty; chocolate-covered cherries, or raisins, and something mildly astringent in the background. Body is medium, a little lighter than some other porters I've had, and the journey across the palate is very smooth. Starts with a mild nettling, then blends over into a slick, easy-going charred chocolate middle, and a mild, but drying finish. A sort of burnt-cola aftertaste. It doesn't strike me as terribly complex, but everything here is very well balanced and this is extremely drinkable."
"This really is a good, solid porter. Lots of flavor, well balanced, and easily drinkable. One of my favorite styles for this time of year - I'll probably pick up another sixer of this before they're gone."
"Easy to drink and enjoyable. A solid porter, if not overly inventive."
"This might not match Smuttynose's Robust Porter, but its a very solid beer that is a mainstay in my fridge."
"Drinkability: Is exceptional, the alcohol content not being too high, but again it is not the same beer ice cold as it is at about 45 degrees, this brew goes down very smooth with plenty of flavor. Great beer."
"Pours a semi clear dark brown with huge off white foamy head. Leaves some nice lacing. Nose is roasted malts, burnt coffee. Taste is a smooth bitter dark toffee flavour with lots of malts throughout. Finishes dry and bitter. Medium bodied mouthfeel. A great tasting Porter, standard for the style, doesn't separate much from the crowd here."
"D- Very smooth and well balanced, goes down very easy."
"While not a staple beer of SN, this is still solid and enjoyable. A standard but enjoyable American Porter, definitely worth trying time and time again."
"D - For the style, i'd say it's quite a drinkable beer. Nothing harsh about this beer at all."
"12oz bottle drank into a tulip...Dark brown beer with a light tan head that is big, but watery, just doesn't look stables or good. Ok lacing...Light aroma of roasted coffee and cocoa, too light and simple, boring...The taste is also way too light, nice cocoa notes that I like, just need more, coffee, but a weird bitter alcohol finish. The lightness of this makes it incredibly easy to drink, reminds me of an English style porter. Enough taste to not be bland and make it drinkable, but I wouldn't come back often for this."
"Drinkability: Incredibly drinkable beer. Delicious taste, low ABV, good price. I probably won't find myself buying this all the time, but for someone who prefers malt to hops this would be a nice staple to keep around for night when all I want is beer and not an adventure."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Under medium bodied a bit watery for the style. It does drink pretty smoothly, however. This porter is definitely drinkable and is by no means a bad beer. It just doesn't measure up to others of the style that I've had."
"Taste- Roasted malts, toffee, semi-sweet chocolate; finishes with bitterness of hops, but everything balances well. Consistancy feels like a porter shouls, very smooth and creamy. Definitely a drinkable beer. Everything balances well which makes for a drinkable beer. Very Good."
"this beer is also very drinkable, and would make a could session brew"
"12 oz. bottle. Pours almost black with a thin tan head. Aroma of roasted malt and dark fruit, some coffee notes as well. Full body. Coffee, roasted malt, and some dark fruit on the palate. Finish is medium and bitter. I guess there can not be a bad beer from SN."
"Drinkability - No doubt this is a very easy to drink beer, I could have a few in one sitting. Not a bad porter, but I thought it'd have more flavor."
"Drinkability- can't stop won't stop!"
"Not quite what I was hoping for, but I definitely wouldn't turn one down. I like a little stronger flavor and more hoppy on the finish. But if you're looking for a smooth porter this may be your holy grail."
"Mouthfeel is light but slightly gritty. Smooth and drinkable beer, but like I said, not exceptional."
"D - Very drinkable. While the appearance suffers a little, the over all beer is very good, and exceedingly drinkable. I especially like the lower alcohol."
"Overall/notes - This was an interesting experience. I tend to associate SN with hoppy beers, but this really changed that perception. The company can do both styles really well. When you drink this, you know why they're so successful: it's easy enough for the casual beer drinker, but deep enough for the beer nuts to drink and say, ""Oh, I see what you did there."" Not bad at all."
"This went down easy and scored extra points with me since I love strong bitter coffee which this resembled quite well. High drinkability for me, I recommend trying this beer."
"12 oz bottle. Pours dark brown. Nice tan long lasting creamy head. Aroma of dark fruit, toasted malt. Taste is toasted malt, esspresso, some notes of chocolate, light hops. Palate is full body, creamy. Finish smooth and long and flavorful. This is a very nice porter. Very enjoyable would drink again"
"drinkability: everything you would expect in a typical porter, not overly intense, pleasant to drink."
"mouthfeel its solid to the core"
"D - A super everyday drinking porter. Good flavor and not heavy."
"D - Not exceptional, but good. The dry feel makes it a bit harder to down."
"Certainly drinkable, a decent porter I will enjoy again in the future."
"Taste - Again, finding the roasted malt character. Picking up hints of what I find to be raisin or plum. Nic"
"Overall: A pretty average porter. Lacks the complexity I like in The top notch porters. It's easy to find and cheap so it's got that going for it."
"A beautiful example of American porter. The dark chocolate color and brown foam are welcoming aromatics for an ale that has Sierra Nevada's unmistakable hop personality, providing spicy dry notes that never distract from the overall presentation of hearty goodness. In the old world, this might be referred to as ""a healthy beer"". A solid choice for food, or by itself as a meal in itself."
"Drinkability : a very good beer, in the style American Porter."
"D- A very tasty and well rounded beer. I like when I can get a beer like this that is approachable, yet also multi faceted."
"Easy drinking, but a bit on the light side for my tastes."
"D - Well like most Sierra Nevada I find it does the job but it really does it too traditional offering no surprises. I did enjoy it though but will seek out other porters to try."
"D - Enjoyable and light to drink but nothing overly impressive."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with an off-white head. The aroma is roasted malt with some chocolate and raisins. I also get a little bit of coffee. The flavor is more of the same, with the chocolate and roasted malt dominating. I also get a little bit of dark fruit and raisins. Medium to thick, creamy mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice American Porter."
"The score here will suffer a bit because of lack of ""oomph", but its drinkability is pretty high. Certainly compared to their stout, this is rather tame."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle nice and dark with a thick tan head. Smell is of roasted barley and slight citrus hop. Taste is just what you want from a porter. Nice roasted malt with some bitterness of roasted barley and a nic balance of hops. The mouthfeel is just as nice, full and creamy but not heavy. Drinkability is high on this beer. It is great when the weather starts getting a little cooler."
"D-very high, this is one you could come back to over and over again"
"Not a huge fan of this one on a whole. Very average on pretty much all ends; a good beer but nothing to write home about"
"Reviewers note: I dunno if there was a problem with the keg, or maybe they had dirty tap lines? But I wasn't expecting the ""lack thereof"" flavor from a Sierra Nevada product. I will try this again in the bottle form, but as it is, my review stands."
"d-I think that the bitterness might get to me after a while."
"D - a decent enough ale. But I was expecting more from sierra Nevada."
"RJT"
"Didn't have the good porter flavor I was expecting and like. Wouldn't recommend it even as a great beer... just meh."
"A little thin and lacking in depth, but well crafted none the less. A good Indian Summer ale - (a half-hearted porter for a half-hearted Autumn?)."
"I poured into a nonic glass to a finger of tan head. This beer is brown with ruby highlights. The aroma is roasted malt and ripe dark fruits. The taste is similar but the malt comes through more on the roasted side. The mouthfeel is medium. This is my go to beer at one of my haunts so I obviously like this stuff."
"D - Let down in a huge way. I had high expectations for this. The flavour is really weak for a porter. If I wanted a Coke I'd drink one."
"Overall, its an okay beer. There are definitely better porters out there but there are definitely worse porters as well. Worth a try but I don't think I'll be coming back to this."
"A hoppy porter that is also fairly light in body."
"d- really good, i'd drink this again, it's a solid porter. can't go wrong with sierra nevada."
"Drinkability: One of the best porters for the season. Not insanely dark or rich, but with all the flavor. One of the best SN brews."
"This a good every day porter. Nice color and nice head. Smells isn't the best, but it taste very smooth and can't get much smoother than it. Exceptional mouthful wanting more and more with each mouthful. A porter to drink every day at any time for any occasion. This is the porter"
"The bottle claims its contents are ""perfectly balanced"" and I'm inclined to agree. It's not often I drink a porter that makes me say ""wow", nor am I often awed by a beer's mild-mannered drinkability, but Sierra Nevada have created something really special here. This is the sort of beer that could really turn a pale-lager-drinker's head towards the darker side of life and love. Something to savour or indeed to scull pints of all night."
"Mouthfeel and carbonation are light."
"The smell is not very strong but hints coffee , chocolate and caramel flavors, which realy enfold after tasting the beer. I even thought I tasted a slight banana taste in there. Very nice mouthfeel with nice carbonation, yet very smooth. It is a very drinkable beer and all around well done . Go for it."
"Notes: Nice flavors and a good Porter. Definitely a Sierra Nevada beer with a definite hop presence and a solid beer for a good price."
"A very good porter, not as good as i remembered, i thought the fruitiness distracted some of the maltiness, but i suppose its to the style."
"A good porter if you want a dark beer on a hot day. It seemed like SN took the hop bill of their pale ale and put it with the malt bill of a porter. Not saying that's necessarily a bad thing, but it seemed a little confused."
"May drink it again to see if I had a bad bottle. Was not blown away by this beer, I have had many porters that blow this one away. Not the worst thing I've ever had, but is far from being the best."
"While this is not an exciting beer to drink, its almost flawless execution is notable."
"D) A balanced porter that is easy to drink, yet quite filling. If I have room, I'll drink another."
"Notes: A bit hoppier and more carbonated than I'm used to in a porter, but not enough to turn me off. I certainly wouldn't mind drinking it again. Solid offering, good but not great."
"D: easy to have 3 or more, I did."
"D-This is not on par with other Sierra Nevada beers I have enjoyed or with better American Porters from Anchor and Deschutes."
"goes down ok. no alcohol burn with some bitterness and char on the finish."
"D: Good flavor, good balance. Very drinkabled straight forward, nothing earth shattering, just a very well balanced rich beer that is easy to drink."
"Drinkability: The beer changes a lot in character when it's first warming up, but once fully warmed up it's a nice one. While porters do go well with beef, I think it clashes a tad with a Burger that has a lot of ketchup and mustard on it. I think it would be better with a steak and potatoes - nothing else to get in the way. So good with a meal, and I think I could have this alone as well. An all around good beer."
"Overall: Very solid porter. This is a good beer from late autumn through winter."
"Surely one of the best standard porters I have ever had. And I have had quite a few."
"Carbonation is the main flaw, it's too high to accompany these rich flavours. Otherwise very impressive."
"D-this has a great balance, extremely simple and straight forward, nothing earth shattering, just a very well balanced rich beer that is easy to drink."
"Great drinkability. Nice smooth consistant porter."
"Sierra Nevada Porter is a very nice porter, it pours the color of black coffee with a finely meshed head that sustains and clings to the side of the glass. The aroma is strong coffee with dark chocolate and a bit of herbal hops. The taste is pleasantly roasted like espresso, bitter northwestern hops and a round malt sweetness. The carbonation is very smooth and accentuates the softness of the beer."
"Drinkabilty - One of my favorite porters. Great beer for the cold nights, or after a sweet dessert. I drink this year round since its so smooth and tastey. Only think about this beer that some porter fans may frown upon is its not very highly smoked flavor, its more sweet."
"Dark brown color with a small head that hangs on for a long time before settling to a thin cap. A lot of lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is more hoppy than what is typical of a porter. Underneath the earthy hops there is some roasted and chocolate malt hints. The flavor also has a lot of earthy hop flavor that dominates upfront. The malt lacks the punch to compete but there is some chocolate and roasted bitterness near the finish. Slightly astringent and that hurts the flavor. Medium body but just slightly overcarbonated. This beer does not quite reach the upper echelon of American Porters but is still a nice beer at a good price."
"Quite disappointed by this porter, maybe my expectations were too high."
"D- Definitely drinkable. Very tasty brew all around."
"D. Not one of the better porters out there and definitely not one that I could/would have on a regular basis. Too thin a body and a clear lack of complexity on the palate and nose makes me give this one a real thumbs down. A BIG letdown after all my praise for the Sierra Nevada Stout I had a few weeks back."
"Smells of chocolate malts with notes of caramel and toffee. Taste is a little roastier with more coffee and chocolate coming out. Pretty complex taste for a porter. It really hits all the flavor bases for a porter at some point. Bitter chocolate finish to it makes it especially tasty. The mouthfeel is a little lighter that I like for an American Porter, but its still good. Very drinkable"
"The taste is great as all the components present in the nose come through in the flavor. I, however, picked up my beer and read the label to make sure I was right, there's a mild hop presence in this that truly rounds out the flavor of the beer and makes it very enjoyable. The coffee, caramel and malt combine splendidly with the hops to make this probably a routine purchase of mine. The mouthfeel is also robust and not watery. This reminds me of Boulevard's Bully! Porter, but I like the mouthfeel on this a lot more. It's very easy to drink with it's lower abv (5.6) and I can see sessioning this very easily."
"D A very nice porter and a good example of the style."
"Very solid porter. Probably a classic by now. This is one of those beers that always gets passed up for other, newer, shinier things. It is nice to revisit old friends from time to time."
"D- Overall, perfect balance of flavors which present not overwhelming. Enjoyed by itself, very drinkable!"
"Overall I thought it had a rustic earthy quality. I very much enjoyed this one and would defiantly have it again. It was very easy to drink. This would make a great spring porter."
"For a porter, or any other style, it doesn't get any more drinkable than this. Very light yet extremely robust and flavorful. A hard combination to pull off like this."
"D: High"
"M/D: Lots of carbonation here, thats a big plus for me. You could have quite a few of these in a night without problem."
"Overall: Despite my descriptions of the specific aroma and flavors, don't expect this porter to blow your palate away. This is a very easy drinking porter with an even blend of hop bitterness and roast. Both qualities offset malt and chocolate sweetness well. I believe Sierra Nevada intended for nice quaffer here, and that's what they got. The vegetal aroma may not be detectable to some. I seem to have this issue with Porters specifically, where I'll pick up on vegetal pretty easily. I can look past it, but it doesn't mean it's not there."
"Not that roasty, almost like a dark brown ale. I like it."
"D: Great beer! I really enjoyed this one. The demonstration of an American Porter is well presented. I recommend this beer to someone that would like to enjoy a pure porter with no adjuncts."
"Taste followed suit, nice chocolate and coffee flavors with that sweet, creamy flavor on the finish that reminded me of their stout. Definitely a good beer"
"I can't even say anything more. I want to go and enjoy this one. It just might be the greatest beer I've ever had. Sierra Nevada's Porter definitely prides itself in balance. There, that's it. Cheers!"
"This is a pretty good, flavorful and definitely drinkable porter. I don't think you'll find a better one for the price."
"I've had better porters but there are definitely worse ones out there too, so this makes a great intro to craft beer and porters in general, it's affordable and easy for me to find."
"Drinkability? I don't see any reason why I couldn't drink more than one of these at a time. Maybe three, but certainly two."
"The mouth has ample carbonation, almost bordering on spritzy. Retains the creamy quality that I look for in the style. Not bad. Pretty average flavors to mirror the average scent. Some roasted malts, dark chocolate, and light breadiness. I was expecting more of a hop-profile, since this is a SN beer, but thankfully this was more ""Porter"" than anticipated. Not bad, but there's better out there."
"O: Another solid brew from Sierra Nevada. I gotta say that I am so glad that they have gotten as big as they are and still produce quality products through and through. I've never had a Sierra Nevada brew and regretted ordering/buying it. Love."
"D: Pretty good overall. Flavors are nicely balanced. Low ABV so it is pretty sessionable. Not a bad little Porter, just a little different than most I've had."
"It's a decent porter."
"Pours a beautiful deep, deep brown. Faint sweet aroma. Chocolate dominates the flavor profile. Roasted malts are also present. Finishes with coffee/toffee tones and a little dry, but not as dry as most of its kind. Very drinkable and well done. Sierra Nevada does a great job of balancing their flavors while creating a beer that's not too flashy, but enjoyable, drinkable and keeps you coming back for more. This porter is a great example of that."
"Despite my expectations of more hop presence, I felt this was a solid drink. Nothing fancy. But solid and quite enjoyable."
"Overall, a solid interpretation of a porter that is deftly executed. A tad watery for my tastes, but definitely has a nice flavor profile and excellent full bodied creaminess."
"On the palate is where this one disappoints. I think it's over carbonated for a porter. At first I got an almost coca-cola taste due to overwhelming carbonation and caramel notes. There is some nice roastyness at the end but it doesn't finish as smooth as it should."
"D- A tasty but not necessarily a unique take on the style. Just what I look for in an American Porter."
"Poured a really dark mahogany with red tones on the edges with a nice two fingered creamy tan head, nice sticky lacing throughout the glass. Aromas of smokey malts and expresso coffee. Thought it was a little watery for a porter but that was made up with a nice burnt carmel flavor. Medium weight with nice carbonation. Very drinkable."
"pours a nutty brown/black. nice head that leaves soft lacing. a roasted hoppy aroma with a touch of sweetness. the taste is really balanced. nothing jumps outs at you but everything is in its right place. very sessionable, very good. all in all one porter that could stay in my fridge all the time."
"d - SN porter, its good to drink a few with dinner or one after dinner. either way it will be enjoyable for all."
"D: A very easy drinking porter that is brimming with flavor. Solid porter from SN, just like every other beer they make."
"And, thanks to the greatness of ChurchKey, I got to take the glass home with me. Yay! Anyway... This guy pours a translucent amber brown with about a finger and a half of ecru froth on top. Imagine a very dark (...and headless...) mad dog. ...Something like that. The nose is composed of roasted, toasted malts, caramel, puffed rice, and a tiny bit o' funk. Bootsy would be proud, but only a li'l bit. Oh well. The roasted malt aspects come through on the tongue as well, along with some walnut, toffee, and a very slight stripe of floral bitterness. It all makes for some very tasty porter-y goodness. With a medium body and very low carbonation, everything goes down all silky smooth. Mmm-hmm. And, with the free glass, things seem even better. I reiterate: Yay! Get some!"
"D: Real easy to drink. i would drink again. seems a bit light for a porter."
"Drinkability is extremely high thanks to the rich flavors and smooth feel. Very satisfying, even on a summer day. Lots of bold flavors and another masterpiece from Sierra Nevada."
"Drink: It's easy to drink and not nearly as rich and malty as some porters."
"OK, so this is a seminal beer (that sounds so fucking gross) in the history of American craft brewing. But it's showing it's age. A decent offering that is timeless in it's own right, leagues above schwilly offerings from other large breweries, but the bar has been raised. Still something I would drink again, though by no means a first choice."
"Pretty decent. In the greater Sierra Nevada context, I give it an A, but compared with my favourite porters and stouts like Speedway, more of a B+. It was a little too watery, although it had a great light flavour of raisins and coffee. For a relatively cheap beer, it was good."
"Very easy to drink even on a moderately warm day."
"Very dark brown with red highlights. Lively tan head that goes quickly and leaves some lacing. Aroma is roasty choco-malt. Taste is similar to the smell with some dark chocolate and coffee. The hops are just enough. Slightly dry bitter finish. Mouthfeel is good but just a bit too much carbonation for me. I can think of a few Oregon Porters I prefer but this is an easy drinker and I certainly wouldn't say no if offered one any time."
"This is a very well balanced porter. I love the hop presence and while the feel is a little fuzzy, it really goes well with the hops. I mostly tasted the chocolate malts in this, not so much a toffee as the bottle describes but it nevertheless is a great porter I would love to sit around and drink a few."
"An aggressive pour produced a two-finger mocha head. Brew was deep brown with ruby edges and clear carbonation. Nose was roasted malt, coffee, chocolate and some earthy hops. Mouthfeel is medium to light. The taste is almost a cocoa powder, caramel with a slight hop bitterness. There is not a terribly complex set of flavors nor any real progression but the flavors are pleasant enough. And, at 5.6%, definitely session-able."
"D: A solid go to porter. Still, with Edmond Fitzgerald readily available in my area, I don't frequent this beer often."
"It doesn't get much more drinkable than this. Its another wonderful sierra nevada beer."
"D - Pretty good overall. Flavors are nicely balanced and of moderate intensity. All blend together well. At 5.6% alcohol, moderately sessionable and of only average strength. This sems like it would go well with bbq and grilled items. An enjoyable porter that can be enjoyed throughout the night."
"Drinkability: Fairly drinkable, a robust porter that has all the right stuff to make it a solid B to B+. Could use some more smoothness and drinkability, as it gets tiresome, but a fantastic sipper. Not my session beer, though. Hope to try the SN Stout."
"This is a great porter. Sierra Nevada sets the standard with this one. This beer will definitely be seeing me again."
"Notes: Change a bit the hop bill, reduce the malt slightly and this is a light version of their already mild mannered stout? ItÂ´s pleasing, and good quality but not particularly exciting."
"D: Fairly drinkable, wouldn't want more than 3 in one sitting though."
"D - The medium body makes it a very drinkable porter. Very fast drinkability so better pace yourself."
"D: Good and enjoyable. I don't think I'd order a second r buy a sixer of this though."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a small head. Smell is, well, missing. Basically oderless. Taste is mild, malts, some hints of chocolate, finishes slightly bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this makes for a mediocre offering."
"Overall, a very good porter from Sierra Nevada. From pour to finish this beer satsifies. Nothing crazy just a straight up delicious beer true to style that goes down easy."
"Overall: a very good introduction to porter, in my experience. I 've been through two cases now and still enjoy this beer very much. Won't be my ""everyday"" beer, but definitely a good, and readily available, stepping stone to the porter class. Highly recommended, especially for someone looking to try a porter for the first time."
"this is one easy drinkin' porter and very sessionable. most of the american porters i have tried seem to lean one way or the other - they are either malt heavy (which i like usually) or they are overly hoppy. most people seem to say this one is very hoppy, but to me it strikes a balance right in the middle. very solid and definitely worth seeking out."
"Overall: Good porter in the west coast hoppy style. Interesting combination of roast and hops. Definitely the hop-head's porter wet dream..."
"D: Definitely a smooth porter, lighter than some others, but overall a solid brew."
"Pours a nice, dark red color with copious, fluffy head that lingered quite a while, leaving chunky lacing. Smells of roasted malt and coffee with background notes of vanilla and some graininess along with a slight nuttiness. A lot of roasted malt flavor in the taste, but with pleasing amounts of piney hop bitterness mixing in. Body is on the thin side of medium and the finish is both mildly astringent and slightly bitter. Drinkability is very good. This is a very tasty porter that doesn't try to be too fancy."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Dogfish Head shaped pint glass. It's a nice, dark brown with some translucence around the edges; pours with a rocky, tan head (what is about the awesome head with SN beers?). Aroma is of roasted malts, with a touch of coffee and caramel - there's also a little earthiness from the hops. Taste is burned caramel up front with some slight roastiness, followed by a pleasant, low-key citrus hop bite. Mouthfeel is a shade under medium-bodied. A good porter, that I could enjoy a few of. Its almost like a little brother to Sierra's Stout (which I guess would be true to style) - a little less roasty / more sweet, with a lighter body."
"The feel is pretty spot on for a single porter. While the liquid looks semi thin and watery, the feel is lucious smooth medium, that goes down with ease. Just enough roast to stick it to the tastebuds, but not overly done. The carbonation is on the light side and it works for this particular porter's size and body. I don't think i'll go for this one again, the smell was yucky the taste was bearable, while the feel was the best part. Much more exciting porters out there in the market."
"D - This has to be one of my favorite porters...Sierra Nevada never disappoints...I enjoyed this one more than their stout...looking forward to having this one around more often"
"Drinkability: A super sessionable and complex porter. This is a favorite in the style. One of my favorites from the brewery."
"An excellent Porter, one that everyone should try. One of my very favourites, if not THE one!"
"D: finished one, could have a few more for sure."
"An adequate porter, the initial hint of hops pretty much fizzles, leaving a straightforward rendition of the style."
"Overall this was a porter that was definitely on the lighter side of average. I thought SN's stout was a better representative of the style than the porter however both are above average and worth a shot."
"Pours a dark, deep, opaque brown, like coffee. Head was a light tan, thick and foamy. Aroma was a mix of roasted malts, and bittersweet cocoa. The taste was the same mix as the aroma, but each flavor was distinct enough. Great thickness, ok carbonation. Great beer for any occasion, not too heavy, great taste, and relatively inexpensive."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"A solid brew and good interpretation of the style."
"D - Wow, Sierra Nevada does a great job at the Porter style! This one has everything one would expect from the style with a wonderful citric hop note on the finish, very balanced & I definitely will buy this one again. I could easily drink 3 or more pints of this brew, highly drinkable. Recommended. Cheers!"
"Libation: An interesting and complex porter, very satisfying and savory. There might be some room for improvement, but the drinkability, reasonable price and almost universal availability make this a solid offering."
"M/D: Medium body, lots of carbonation. A little surprised by how much actually. Very drinkable. Goes down really well."
"D - An excellent porter. One of the better ones I've had."
"Comments:"
"SkÃ¥l!"
"D - No problems here; this is an easy beer to drink. It's pretty much standard fare, but there isn't much to fault with it. Definitely worth a shot."
"A quality drink which stands up to the strong reputation of Sierra Nevada. This bottle is right on its expiration date but still tastes great and except for the aroma ticks all the right boxes for the style"
"D- Middle of the road porter, prolly won't buy it again."
"D: I could session this any day. There is little bitterness towards the end as the beer starts to warm up, and the chocolate and coffee flavors are even more prevalent."
"One more note: I paired this with some Gruyere, and the nuttiness of the cheese with the roast-iness of the porter dovetailed the flavors perfectly."
"D..Yup, I could drink these all day. An easy session porter if ever there was one. I look forward to this beer again."
"Drinkability: Well-suited as a year-round beer. The ABV is about average and hidden well. Not too bitter with the right amount of sweetness for a malty brew. Smooth and not so heavy in its body that I could drink more than one, but probably best suited on its own with a desert pairing."
"Taste is very smokey and sharp for a porter, almost like a stout to me. It's quite sweet without being overwhelming. Mouthfeel fairly full and crisp, heavier than the pale ale, overall very good."
"Mouthfeel is good, not as thick as a stout - just what I wanted."
"Porters arent my favorite style but as always Sierra Nevada does a great job on their version."
"Sierra Nevada Porter is a drinkable beer that is good, but on the light side as far as malt goes; I don't mean light as in lacking malt, but I mean light in the color/flavor of the malt."
"D: Quite drinkable, and a very enjoyable porter."
"This would go great with any beef dish."
"D=4.5 Its a very smooth beer with around high 5 to low 6 percent alcohol. Worth trying if you find it. It's a good beer in the spring and fall, winter as well"
"Quite a good porter, easy to drink, plenty of character, and overall does not disappoint."
"D- for such an easily found beer this could be a great session porter. impressive"
"Just a clean porter! I'd have a hard time picking a winner between this and Anchor's porter. Excellent beer."
"Great example of a basic porter. Though I tend to graviate towards harpoon leviathan or flying dog for my porter needs."
"Overall, for a sessionable Porter, this is a pretty good one. Not my favorite in the world, but definitely up there towards the top."
"Very smooth and easy drinking. Goes down easy."
"Pours a nice 1.5 inch head into a glass. Dissipated quickly leaving some brownish lacing. Nice dark brown nectar. Smells a little chocolaty and is a little tart. Lightly carbonated. Medium bodied, not like eating a loaf of bread. I like this beer but maybe not as much as a Bock or IPA. Good enough to drink year round. Probably would only want to drink one or two at a sitting due to the body. Would like a hunk of cheddar to make it better."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. Poured a deep brown with ruby highlights around the base. 1.5 inch, creamy, off-white head reduced its volume by half in under a minute before settling into a consistent, quarter inch cap. A thick band of lacing is exposed during the session. Nose is somewhat mild - just a hint of chocolate malt and roast. Taste follows nose - really mild flavors, somewhat watery while also expressing some cereal grains and a kiss of hops. Mouthfeel is light-medium and lightly carbonated, with a clean finish. A little lacking in the flavor profile, but fairly easy drinking; just not what I usually look for in a porter."
"Drinkability: On-the-nose example of a Robust Porter. While not my favorite, it is certainly an archetype."
"i'll tell you this. if you like the TASTE of porters but do not like the thickness and wish it felt more like a light beer, this is for you! you'll love it! so, its not my favorite, but like i said, i still buy it."
"Drinkability - Totally drinkable. Not much burn, and the slenderness of it makes it less heavy... though a bit more of a toffee flavor would definitely be enticing."
"Maybe I got a bad bottle, but this is a pretty weak Porter. Relatively fresh, purchased and kept refrigerated so I don't think it was mishandled. An oddball for sure. Stick with the hoppy stuff, Sierra Nevada..."
"with out doubt a lovely porter and I'm glad I got to try it through a trade (thanks adil) my first beer from this brewer and I can't wait to try more, unfortunately I can't get it in these parts so I have no choice but to wait"
"D: It's good enough to drink for a while, not as flavorful as I expected."
"D - Did I mention it's my favorite winter session beer? Oh I did? Ok. Well, it's very drinkable."
"Very nice, overall I am very impressed."
"Poured into a shaker pint. Deep clear walnut color with a thick creamy off-white head that turns slowly into a thick film and laces OK. Nutty malty aroma. Semi-sweet taste with a slight sour finish. Very smooth and easy to drink. A very fine example and well crafted of a porter."
"It's a pretty easy drinking beer if you're looking for a porter that doesn't feel heavy. There's enough flavor here to be worth your time and money, even if it's a little uneven."
"Drinkability: I would limit this to the colder months, though the abv isnt tremedously high, it could be drank summer nights. A full bodied great porter and near perfect example of the style."
"Pours clear, hearty brown in color with a light and creamy, tan head. The glass is overflowing with sweeth roasted grain aromas. The body is mildly heavy with moderate carbonation to make the flavor of robust roasted malts and chocolate dance around the palate. The brew then flows into a graceful malty finish where the coffee and chocolate fade away gently."
"d: Very tasty porter, I think I wanted a little more coffee or chocolate though."
"A very enjoyable porter. I'm surprised by the chocolate notes. A very drinkable beer, especially during the winter months."
"Poured forth a deep brown color into my glass. Smelled of malts and coffee. The taste was a bit bitter, but not over powering. Coffee and hops push through in flavor. An average tasting porter. Hops are quite pronounce for a porter followed by toffee and a rich chocolate finish. I could have a few of these before I got tired of them, bit more bitter than I would like in this type of beer."
"Poured a deep dark ruby or garnet tinged brown with ample tan head that dissipated quickly and left some lacing. Aromas primarily of chocolate malts with some slight bitterness on the tale end. Feel was medium to full bodied with some dryness/crispness noticed. Very drinkable as the flavor was not overly sweet and the ABV is manageable."
"Sierra Nevada really is a remarkable brewery! Every-time I am able to drink one of their beers all the way out here on the east coast, I am a happy man. While their Porter has been a staple in my beer consumption for years, I never grow tired of its sumptuous, robust flavor. A beautiful example of an American Porter, SN has again created a beer worthy of anyones beer fridge!"
"This one confused me. It looks like a porter: nearly jet black with a white head and minimal lace; but the smell and taste are very hoppy. It's not that that's a bad thing, just unusual for the style. The hops aren't overpowering, but they do drown out what ought to be the standout feature of the beer: chocolate malt and sweet caramel. Overall, I found this porter to be too bitter, and for such a great brewery, I think they could have done a lot better."
"Pleasant malt flavours combined with great citrusy hops make this a favourable brew to grab if you want flavour and refreshment. Way to go Sierra Nevada!"
"This beer pours a jet black cola colour with decent carbonation that leaves a two finger foamy head that hangs around and heaps of visible lacing can be seen everywhere,it has a nice sweet malty aroma to it with some coffee and floral fruity hops coming thru aswell,it has a nice full but light mouthfeel with that sweet coffee first on the palette followed by a nice choc fruity bitterness to make the finish quite smooth,definately a standout porter in my eyes and just hope i see it in our winter."
"D= very drinkable, great session if you're in the Porter mood, would be great with dark meats or dark bread meals."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Value: For $8.99 a six pack, you really can't do much better for a good, solid, go-to porter. I'd buy it again."
"High drinkability. But an average porter."
"Overall,"
"D- This is a good drinking porter that I tend to overlook. Flavors are bright and crisp in the beer and I will be looking for this a little more often."
"It tasted exactly like I remembered it - bittersweet chocolate, a touch of dark roasted coffee, and a spicy and citrusy hop finish. A complex, mind-blowing beer this is not, but it's perhaps the most perfectly balanced porter I've ever tasted. Roasted without being burnt, not overly sweet or rich, and with just the perfect amount of hops to give it that distinct West Coast character without overwhelming the beer. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a few more of these to knock back before I get on with the rest of my day..."
"D: Another great beer from Sierra Nevada. These guys make some of the best session/most drinkable beers out there. You can never go wrong with a Sierra product."
"Overall, one of the best porters that's regularly available. When fresh the the malt is sharp and the hops are bold, but as it ages it smooths out and a silky milk chocolate character comes out. In both conditions its a really good beer."
"The feel of this beer is pretty light for a porter but is still medium bodied."
"Very easy drink. Multiples a plenty on a chilly day. This porter is a great version of the style and can be found easily which is nice."
"Notes: When I've had this beer previously, it tasted very much like simply a good West-coast interpretation of a porter. This is neither good nor bad, just an observation. But this time, I didn't get as much of those California hop/bitterness characteristics as I did overall great porter characteristics. I've come to the conclusion this is just a great American porter, West-coast or otherwise."
"Overall, it's a very well made and super drinkable porter...I will seek this out again."
"Subtle chocolate malt in the smell, with a little cocoa. With the taste, I am getting mostly dark roasted chocolate. Also venturing to fruity(dark) and nutty. This is pretty damn good. Nice semi-creamy mouthfeel. Amazed it took me this long to locate this Anchor offering."
"Conclusion: This is a solid, tasty porter. Not a ton of depth, but it's straightforward and enjoyable."
"A nice dark color. Not much of a head. Looks nice. Smell is good. Toast and malt. The taste is excellent. Rich but not heavy. Sturdy but also crisp. Tastes malty, with nice hop bitterness. This beer has a nice depth to it, without being aggressive. Quite drinkable. Refreshing and tasty. Overall, a very very good beer. It's a nice, well crafted porter. I like it a lot.."
"D - Nothing exceptional, but better then average porter that's widely available in my parts."
"Taste-Coffee, dark malts, subtle hop notes-A bit thin-bodied, but very drinkable-Could use a little more kick, but nevertheless a nice easy-drinking porter. Would be a nice ""intro"" porter for newbies."
"D - Exceptional drinkability... Not outstanding in any one area, but this beer disappeared quite quickly leaving me wanting another (and another)... In addition, this provides an exceptional value proposition..."
"Overall, this is a nice example of a classic porter."
"Great product by a great brewery. Enjoy the massive hop assault that you probably won't see replicated by many other porters. Big, rich, bitter."
"As with all Sierra Nevada brews, this is extremely well-crafted, and presents itself as a very sessionable porter."
"As with most of Sierra Nevada's offerings the appearance is top notch. Blackest of Brown with a gigantic beige head that leaves sheets of lacing as it dissipates. Nose is roasty with muted chocolate and coffee. The taste is big and bold for such a low abv, roasted barley malt, supreme blend coffee, milk chocolate wafers and finished with a nice bitter punch from the big hop presence. Mouthfeel could have been bolder, heavier and thicker. Nitpicking really, extremely sessionable and hard to beat for the price and quality."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle no. 9237216-39. Sampled on November 21, 2009. The pour is a rich dark brown with nice lacing but essentially no head. The aroma is vaguely smoked with some clean hops on the nose. The mouthfeel is of decent quality. It is about medium-heavy but smooth. The taste is very clean with a nice bit of smoky malts and fresh hops. Well-balanced and likeable."
"Poured it into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass. This beer pours dark brown with dark red/amber highlights on the edges when held to the light. Dark and deep enough that you can't see through it clearly. This beer produces a huge tan colored head that only takes a few minutes to go away, but produces some pretty generous lacing and stick to the glass. The smell is very good. The hops are present, but I'd say that roasted malts and coffee flavors come out first followed by the hops. The taste goes in a bit of a different order in my opinion. It's really important that this beer touches every part of your tongue, because there's a lot of flavor in this beer. For some reason, no matter what I tasted a quick taste of the hops, but it was immediately followed by the roasted malts and coffee flavor. The second portion is smooth and sweet from the caramelized roasted malts. You can taste roasted coffee beans as well right behind the malts. The bitter finish comes from the hops, not too strong, but certainly noticeable, citrus if I'm not mistaken. This is I'd say a medium bodied beer. This is a very drinkable beer, putting the fact that it's a porter aside, very drinkable. Great brew from Sierra Nevada."
"D: I could have this all day long in the colder months, or just as a solid session beer. Sierra never fails to impress."
"Poured into a Thirsty Bear nonic glass. Super fluffy off-white tannish head about 3 fingers tall. Dark brown with some slivers of red peeking through. Aroma of smoky marshmellow, malt chocolate powder. Milk chocolate on the nose, very smooth up front and creamy. Milky mouthfeel, just a nudge of hops to let you know they are there. Touch of bitter hop, maybe bitter chocolate...hard to tell. Extremely balanced and easy drinking. Dry, subtle dry chocolate on the finish. About as good as it gets for an American Porter."
"I will without a doubt drink this beer again"
"Mouthfeel is creamy and the finish is dry with a bitterness just well balanced. Excellent beer! Thanks Adil and Cheers to that!"
"Drinkability: Not the best, but a very pleasant porter."
"Drinkability: this is a porter that other porters should be judged against. excellent beer."
"Drinkability: A good porter and another excellent beer from Sierra Nevada. They have yet to disappoint me."
"D: A great session beer. I could drink this all night."
"mouth is calm and smooth but it really lights up in the after taste, really smokey. pretty heavy dont think i could drink more than a few but it is a delight."
"Drinkability: pretty good. This would make a solid session porter."
"drinkability: a nice beer and SN usually is right on style."
"over all a drinkable brew, but what am i to take from it? i'm just not sure. i cant see myself running to grab another one of these to satisfy any of my beer related cravings. this selection departs from the traditional porter, but with no destination in mind other than being labeled a sierra nevada brew."
"Note: I checked, and no Cascades in this beer. I admit I sometimes try too hard."
"Whoa, did somebody pour a cup of coffee! Intense aroma of roasted coffee beans and dark chocolate. Two fingers worth of foamy goodness that maintains its character well. Tastes of nuts, smoke, molasses, and of course coffee! A nice hop bite follows the initial roasted flavors. As this deliciously medium carbonated, slightly oily porter was drunk, great lacing was left inside the glass. This porter is very well constructed, and it would serve as a perfect pairing choice with some grilled meats and chocolate."
"edit: another revisit. about the same, but a little more enjoyable except for the appearance. would love more lacing and a sustained head. o well. it tastes great. and it's quite drinkable."
"Overall, this is a great session beer, in my opinion. It's got enough complexity to be interesting, but it's light enough to drink a few of. Really good porter."
"Not a huge ABV, not very heavy, and also pretty tasty. I could drink a few in a row. I'll buy this porter again, it's a solid beer."
"+ though it's one of the hoppiest porters i've had, it's not overwhelming."
"Sierra Nevada labels boasts claims of ""purest ingredients"" and ""finest quality"". You can rest assured those are not deceptive statements. In fact, they could add a few more - ""balanced and flavorful", ""endlessly quaffable", ""beer as it's meant to be"" - and still not even begin to touch on the reasons for their success over the last few decades."
"This was the Porter that got me into dark beer. Also the finest selection from Sierra Nevada, and I'll even go out on a limb to say that this trumps even their Pale Ale, although I'll receive a lot of flack for that. Pours a rich dark brown, with a tan head and lacing visible even inside of the bottle. The smell was the highest point here, full of roasted malts and bitter chocolate, and even tones of burnt hops with a slight tinge to it. The flavor was an intense mix of roasted malts, coffee and chocolate notes, with a slightly smoky bitter and rich coffee-like aftertaste. Warming, moderate body with just the right amount of carbonation, and it goes down extremely well, making for an excellent beer that can be enjoyed in all seasons, whether grilling in the summer or in front of a fireplace at the holidays. One of my all-time favorites."
"A good all around beer from Sierra Nevada. I could probably drink several of these in a sitting and be quite content."
"I was exceptionally surprised to see that Sierra made a porter that rivaled if not surpassed the quality of its flagship pale ale. From the getgo, the cask pour was a perfect deep brown color, with a thick tan head, that laced perfectly. The smell was malty; not too much individual chocolate or roasted aromas, but it did have a subtle pine/citrus note (possibly from dry-hopping with Cascade?). The flavor was outstanding...roasted malt, subtle cocoa, and a subtle pine finish. Creamy mouthfeel, but not overbearing and quite drinkable, which is very rare for a porter. Again, I was very, very surprised by this result. Well done, Sierra."
"*My first perfect score! And this after I thought I'd never find a Sierra Nevada beer that I liked. I am blown away by this, and this will be one of my new regulars in my fridge. Welcome home, boys."
"Very tasty porter with lots of flavor, if this was available in my area I would definately buy again."
"J"
"D- A really nice porter with a great flavor and cheap price tag."
"Balanced yet intense, complex yet totally drinkable. This is a great American porter."
"Drinkability is fantastic and solid. Its complexity and availability make it a great session brew. Thanks again Sierra Nevada!"
"Drinkability is good. As far as porters go, this shit is off-the-wall. I'll be coming back to it from time to time while the weather is cold."
"smooth taste, not too thick and 5% abv. i could drink plenty of this beer"
"D: Great, just great."
"An solid offering from Sierra Nevada. A caveat: the beer I reviewed came from a blue bottle. As I understand it, Sierra Nevada changed the label from blue to brown some five months ago, so this is likely an older beer. I would imagine that the hops would be even more pungent were this fresh."
"Notes: This is a pretty solid example of an American Porter. I've had better ones for sure, but this one will stand out in my memory because it's a hoppier take on the style than most of the others. Nicely balanced and is quite drinkable if a porter session is what you're looking for. Solid"
"BTW the 5.6 ABV is completly masked by the maltiness."
"D - Quite drinkable with a nicely balanced malt profile that walks that thin line between brown and black that we often call porter."
"M & D: Very light for a porter. The carbonation is right but the rest of the beer feels watered down and a tad thin. I'd try it again, but only if someone else is willing to share."
"One of my favorite Porters, the Sierra Nevada Porter and Stouts are what really got me interested in the style. Both are very dry and aromatic with great hop bitterness. The porter is a very dark brown and is not so strong that you can't drink a bunch of it in the right season. I think one of the best in the category."
"D: Excellent, classic porter. Nothing overpowers like todays big beers."
"One of my favorite porters; very refreshing and light for the style. If there is a session porter, this is it."
"B+"
"Rather thin mouthfeel in here, especially for a porter. It's not dissapointing, just a bit syrupy and thin."
"Overall, this is a great tasting porter, another hit for SN. I kinda knew I was going to like this before I even picked it up."
"I like this beer, however, I look for a maltier presence in a porter. As usual, you can't go wrong with Sierra Nevada though."
"Drinkability is good but taste not complex enough and leaves a slight coating"
"Sierra Nevada makes quality beers and this porter is no exception. I will be picking up more of this in the future. Especially when I am in the mood for a porter that is not of imperial strength."
"MF/D: Nice medium body, long bready finish, opposite of dry, definitely a session beer, perhaps my favorite"
"D-Excellent example of an American Porter. Very enjoyable. I think this once won a big 12 beer double blind taste test my brother and I did about five years ago..."
"Brews Brother"
"D- The taste with medium body and ABV make this one a great session beer. More good stuff from SN."
"Creamy, malty. A little bitter in the finish. The roasted flavors are not overpowering thought. Very good, drinkable beer."
"im not a big porter fan (besides black butte xx, alaskan smoked, and stone smoked), but this one is fantastic. rich and smooth all the way through. one of the best porters out there. smells of roasted coffee and hops. tastes the same, with a bit of chocolate and a dry bitterness to the end. Thick on the palate (for a regular porter), and outstanding going down. drinkability is fantastic, given its great flavor combined with its relative lightness."
"Highly recommended."
"Dark brown with ruby red highlights and an airy tan head that leaves some lace behind. Coffee, cocoa, roasted malt and mild leafy hops make up the nose on this one. Rich roasty malts, toasted oak and honey come to mind, all balanced by a nice charred bitterness and a touch of bitter hops in the finish. Medium bodied with crisp carbonation. A tasty porter indeed."
"A well balanced, clean example of an American Porter. Mildly complex, roasted malts and grains with enough bitterness to give it a backbone."
"Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a nice mild bite."
"Pours a cola-like dark brown with lighter hints of amber light coming through and a nice off-white frothy head. Smell is quite subdued, a little bit roasty but not much to pick out. Flavor is fairly light, a pinch of dry bitterness as well as a bit of raosty malt presence. Mouth is light and a bit creamy if you get some of the head. Its extremely sessionable.. though it could serve to have a slightly more robust flavor, the light presence of flavor lends itself to a very high drinkability. You could easily put several down in a sitting. As it warms slightly the flavor becomes a little more apparent. Upon first sips it might seem a bit unimpressive but its certainly a great sessionable beer."
"D - This is my idea of the perfect 5 on drinkability. Unnoticable alcohol, good taste. Great feel and smell."
"I'm not into noting overtones, notes, etc. I like dark beer, the darker & more robust the better. This beer pleases on many levels - pours like ink, smells slightly bitter, taste is robust and very pleasing."
"Pours dark brown to near-black with very light tan head. Nose is somewhat restrained with some chocolate and nougat. On the palate, a nice cafe mocha flavor comes through with hop bitterness near the end. Finish is medium and roasty. Rather drinkable for a porter, if you're looking for something lighter on the palate in the porter style."
"A good porter for everyday drinking. Nothing too special, but no characteristics turn me off the beer."
"Dark, roasted malts, aren't my stlye at all, but this is quite tasty. Personal preference says it's not a first choice, but it's definitely a good porter, the hops adding an interesting component to the mix."
"note: whenever i get a porter in the pubs out in Calgary, well if i get a pint, they serve it with a small piece of dark chocolate that really can bring out a richness you don't get without it, worth a try with this one too, overall a great brew"
"Drinkability: i've only had english and baltic porters before, this has a hoppier feel and is less bitter so it may be easier for some folk to drink, but I still agree sam smith and others are very drinkable but this has a different quality. Overall a great an inventive American interpretation of a porter. Will buy again."
" Taste and mouthfeel add up to a very drinkable porter."
"A frothy, creamy mocha head rests on top of the opaque brew and when held to the light, showcases dark ruby edges. Intoxicating and almost primitive aroma of fresh dark bread, roasted grain, boiled porridge, chocolate, burnt popcorn kernels, and not so primitive smell of freshly baked ice cream cone. The deep flavors of chocolate and coffee are prominent while the soft hoppiness fades to a pleasant rounded bitterness and thin to medium mouthfeel. Forget the Guinness, pull up a Porter."
"I can only fault this beer for being a little thin for a porter. I wish the malt was a bit thicker, but it's one of my favorites so far."
"Would recommend above others, but would recommend other Sierra Nevada Brew's to others before this."
"Notes - Good mouthfeel."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are quite good though. The beer gets drained quickly and having multiples is an easy affair."
"Pours a very nice dark brown/black color with very good head and some nice lacing. Good scent, bit of burnt grain aroma, but not very deep or strong. Nice taste, good thick burnt grain quality with some decent coffee aftertaste and just enough hops to keep the malt grounded. Goes down fantasticly smooth!"
"Drinkability: It went down easy, I'll give it that. This is the first SN offering I've been disappointed by. I never had their porter before this year, so I don't know if they've changed the recipe or something, but this was a disappointment. It wasn't really bad, per se, but was not a good representation of the style."
"This one poured almost black, with an off white head. The head lasted a long time, and there was a nice lacing. The scent was heavenly. VERY nice scent of roasted chocolate and coffee. The taste is much like a roasted coffee bean with just a hint of malt thrown in. Nice carbonation. I could drink these all night if I let myself. The only problem is, I'm having an awful time finding any more of it. I found a couple of loose bottles at trader joe's and haven't seen it again..."
"Pours dark, dark mahogany with ruby highlights. Rocky off-white head with good retention and lacing. A very nice looking beer. Smell was rich of dark chocolate, toasted grain, caramel, and some raisin. Taste is of toasted and burnt grain, chocolate, some toffee, and dry malt. Low carbonation and a slightly thicker mouthfeel, almost chewy. Overall a good beer and easy drinker. I think this could almost pass for a stout as I think it has a fuller body than many other Porters."
"D- pleasing to the mouth. Not too heavy or overwhelming with chocolate richness to make it a single pint beer. I say these can be enjoyed in good numbers."
"When you combine the factors of cost and quality, its hard to beat this one. This is a GREAT porter that I can pick up on sale for $5.99 a sixer. Makes me wish there was a ""value"" catagory for a review. I love this beer."
"drinkability - Even balance porter that wasnt that bad."
"D: Very drinkable. Would make a nice session beer."
"Verdict: Sierra Nevada Porter is just a solid, drinkable beer. It's uncomplicated, but never simple. Highly drinkable, but never boring. I've heard rumors that this beer might be taken out of my local market in order to make room for the new year-round Sierra Nevada beers. That would be quite a shame, here's hoping they can squeeze everyone in."
"The in-laws left this one in the fridge after the weekend. I think they're catching on to how this family thing is supposed to work. A straight tan head sits on top of a coal black brew with no light shining through. Head recedes at a quickened pac. A few thing lines of lace are left. Aroma is subtle with sweet malts rising first, then some faint roasted nuts and maybe a splash of honey and pine. I'm going to stop there as not to try and seek something that is not there. All in all, its not as bold as expected. Let's move on. Tastes sweet and malty up front with a nice little hit of hops following up quickly. Some black coffee and a hint of pine finish it up. Carbonation is big, and keeps everything lighter than usual on the palate. Mouth-feel lies somewhere between medium and heavy, but it goes down pretty easy. Many porters tend to over do things in one area or the other, but this is a Well-made, well-balanced porter, which is not a surprise considering where it came from."
"Notes: As stated above, a possible reference beer for the style. Quite good."
"One finger tan head with moderate retention and lace, under a bright light I can just barely make out the outline of my fingers on the other side of the glass. Low steady carbonation. Smells of roast malt, freshly ground coffee beans. Taste is impressive and delicious with an underlying nutty taste, roast malt, slight espresso, hops. Smooth mouthfeel despite a brazil nut dryness and moderate astringency. Finish is long and drawn out, again dry. This is a tasty porter that is more nutty than coffee-like, a real pleasure as are all SN brews I've been lucky enough to sample."
"D: This is exactly what a porter should be. Will it replace Black Butte as my go-to beer?"
"Pours a deep dark brown, almost black color. thin 1 finger head, dissipates quickly. Smells like roasted malt, with a subtle sweetness. Tastes like sweet crystal malts, balanced with slightly bitter roasted malts. Slight dried fruit in finish. some hints of chocolate. Light mouthfeel, but not watery at all. light to medium carbonation. overall very good, light, refreshing porter. I've seen this stuff a million times at the store, but just finally got around to trying it. another solid offering from S.N."
"Alrighty so had this poured from bottle to glass at Old Chicago. Decent appearance, an off black color almost more deep brown than anything. Smell and taste pick up with some slight hints of dark chocolate and toffee, a mild undertone of nops. Mouthfeel is on par the style lower carbonation and medium in body. Quite pleasant to sip on."
"D - the only porter I religiously stock in my fridge; great for those nights when a dark beer is needed but a liquid meal is not"
"classy beer, another hit by the folks at SN."
"D - An above average, solid porter. A little too roasty without characteristic fruity/sweet/slighty sour notes of a porter. More stout-ish than porter, but at least it's unoffensive."
"D - I could drink a few of these in a row. Not bad at all for the first time."
"D: Not fantastic, but definitely a great porter. Relaxing and fun to drink."
"Drinkability: Nice drinkability goes down smooth. Gonna have to go grab me another."
"When poured, it was very dark brown in color with very little foam and did have some lace on the side of the glass. The smell of roasted barley malts and a hint of a fruity aroma. The taste was of roasted malts, hops, with a chocolate, caramel and hints of fruit and citrus. Nicely balanced, smooth and mellow feel in the mouth, with just the correct bittersweet, tart feel on the palate."
"Drinkability - Wish I had another on hand..."
"[Drinkability]: Very smooth porter. Worth buying."
"It is very drinkable. I would consider this a good valued porter to have on hand."
"D: High marks for drinkability. With it's light body and interesting flavor profile, this beer is very sessionable. Esp at it's 4.99 price tag... I better pick up a case or two while it is still on sale. One note though... don't drink this brew after an impy stout, otherwise it will taste watery."
"Drinkability: It's balanced and smooth. The drinkability factor is high. Very enjoyable."
"M&D: the mouthfeel, strangely enough, falls a bit thin from the very beginning likely due to the sour/winey edge, but overall the carbonation is commendable, to the necessary level only that the palate feels refreshing enough. The deep imprint of sourness manifests itself consistently, like a true Porter should show, but never OTT or stale thanks to the lively input from the aromatic hops. All in all, this is a balanced and likeable Porter ale I would love to drink regularly if it was constantly on the shelves of my local offie."
"Recommended."
"D: A very drinkable porter. One of the better American porters out there. I love the big American hop presence with the dry finish."
"Sierra Nevada Porter poured a very dark brown, with a nice tan head. It also showed every good lacing. The smell was of roasted and sweet malts, with hints of hops. The taste was loaded with roasted flavors. Coffee and bittersweet chocolate, with some mild hints of hops. Mouthfeel was good, not to thick. Drinkability was also nice. Overall this was a spot on porter, one that I will go back to."
"A light carbonation, nice lacey head, and the color of dark mahogany bespeak a warm invitation to drink. I smell nicely toasted barley, coffee and malt. The hops are downplayed, which is good for the style. The beer has a fantastic flavor, and leaves a dry espresso kick at the end which entices you to have more. A good session beer, drinkability and mouthfeel are indicative of the flavor depth. Not an A+ beer, but I'd choose it over a lot of others."
"just a tad on the bitter and astringent coffee side, but still a nice american porter, readily available and quite a deal at trader joe's."
"Drinkability: A nice 'supper' beer. A little on the thinner side for what I look for in a porter, but still very good. I can see drinking a few with nice steak, but I wouldn't want to drink it all night."
"A very good porter which is easy to come by and always great to have in the fridge."
"All in all a good example of an American Porter and a fine beer for late winter."
"It tasted like it smelt but in reverse. At first I got the hints of coffee and blast of carbonation. Then, there was a brief pause before the cituslike hops took me to the finish. The after taste is fantastic. I think it is a roasted nut but there is also something pulling me toward dark chocolate. Either way it lingers and creeps its way back up my throat to my nose. Excellent."
"Pours a huge tan colored head, frothy, and lasting. Body is dark-dark red, nearly black in color. Has a hoppy roasted aroma, with some coffee, and some nutty nalts. Roasted coffee, dry mouthfeel. Not bad, a good porter."
"Theres a good balance of dark, roasted elements in the taste, primarilly coffee. And as the nose would suggest, there's a good citric hop profile to follow up. Medium bodied, though the mouthfeel is slightly watery. Great beer, overall."
"Sessionable. Tastes great. Rewarding. Others have sinced pushed the envelope on the style, but this is a classic everyone should try. In Ca at least you can often find 6ers for $6.99. heck of a deal right there."
"Another good beer from sierra nevada. Has the same great hops taste of the pale ale, but with a great malt flavor like a brown ale or a stout. Good balanced beer."
"M - Great smooth feel. Not thick like too many porters, but also is thick enough to not have the watery aftertaste that I get from Guinness."
"Tons of tan creamy head sit atop a nearly opaque, cola colored beer. Pretty good lacing and head retention. Smells are of sweet malts, caramel, bitter chocolate, and a small amount of hops on the edge. Taste comes through with a barrage of malts, both sweet and roasted, a bit of a coffee flavor. Mouthfeel was pretty good, not a ton of carbonation, medium bodied. An excellent example of a porter."
"A nice, everyday, porter."
"Drinkability- I find this to be an incredibly good porter, though not real high in alcohol this beer is so big it feels twice as big as it even is, great full bodied beer that is definitely worth a purchase again and should be a good beer to always have few of around in my beer fridge"
"D: Probably one of my favorite porters. Could definitely have a few of these."
"Sharp carbonation bite up front, trailing off into a softer bite towards the end, medium body."
"Overall: Not a bad little porter. Not having tried the Sierra Nevada Stout, it's hard to make a good comparison between the two, but it would be interesting to taste both side by side."
"This is definitely a go-to porter. Hoppy and delicious with a nice clean roasted backbone. One definitely worth having around. Nothing outstanding, but certainly nothing to complain about. There's a reason this one remains so popular."
"Medium body, light carbonation, very smooth. This one is an easy drinker for sure."
"D: I could easily pour this back all night. This is a great flavorful beer. It is thin in the mouth, and that is offsetting, but it is still tasty."
"Pours a nice dark brown almost black with a nice frothy cream head that lingers and leaves great lacing. Aroma is cocoa powder and brown malts. Taste is a nice amount of brown malt and cocoa with a nice hop kick right behind it, just what I expected from SN. The beer is nice and light with decent carbonation. This is a very enjoyable Porter, one I'll have again in a heartbeat."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Appearence is quintessential porter - coffee brown with a frothy tan head from hell. Aroma reminiscent of roasted malt and some mild hop spice. Slight burn of the carbonation leads to roasted malt flavour, slight caramel notes waning into a mild hoppy bitterness. A straightforward porter. Very drinkable."
"It was medium-bodied in the mouth. Slightly sticky (hooray for the malts), yet not quite enough to justify how syrupy the back of my throat felt after each sip... not too bad though. I enjoyed the low carbonation levels, and it made the simple beer exceptionally drinkable."
"Drinkability: Just a tad thin, a tad simple, and just not what I'm really looking for in a porter. On to their stout!"
"I've not had many porters in my day, and indeed a bad experience with a major dark beer (which shall remain nameless) almost ruined stouts for me. However, this one may just lead me back to the dark side. A very tasty beer and one that I would pleasure buying again."
"A bit filling but overall highly drinkable. SN's basic offerings (PA, Porter, Stout, etc.) are widely available and quite affordable and yet they still come off as attractive quality beers. A very enjoyable porter that I would not mind having again."
"MF&D - Went down well, a nice compliment to my PB&J sandwich. I would buy it again."
"Drinkability, like I said spot-on for a porter it is a good bench mark for what to look for in one. This is perfect for any porter fan."
"Overall a quite enjoyable beer experience. As this is the first beer I've reviewed since getting my taste buds back to normal after surgery, it's really good to be able to enjoy and appreciate beer again."
"As a final note, the porter is very similar to their stout, though the porter puts more emphasis on a sweet malt taste and doesn't look as appealing as the stout. It's obvious, however, that the two are related."
"D - This is what I'd reach for when I wanted a quirky American Porter. The added hoppiness is a nice twist on a more traditional style."
"D - Nice for cold weather but not a must buy"
"Drinkability: Slightly heavy finish...but overall fairly smooth and easy drinking. Not a session beer though..."
"Quite enjoyable, for a dark beer this goes down easy and is something to come back to."
"D- This is my first porter and I enjoyed it. The stouts I've tasted tend to be a lot more bitter. I found the malty sweetness of this one to be very pleasing. Very easy drinking beer. I only bought a single, but I I think it would be easy to drink several of these in one sitting."
"Very good. The hop presence is more noticeable than in most beers of the style."
"Poured to a nice caramel looking two fingered head. Big bubbles in the middle of the glass. Porter was almost black in color. Just had some slight brown overtones. Head hung around a for quite a while and had some good lacing. Left rings with every swallow. Smelled of malt chocolate and coffee. Tasted a little sweet like dark chocolate and burnt coffee. Had a slight bitter aftertaste that also hung around awhile. When pouring it almost looked thick. Felt good ih the mouth. I thought the carbonation was right. I would buy again. On a cold snowy Michigan day like today, the Porter was going down mighty good."
"Overall it was very solid and for an everyday, and very available porter, this is really exceptional. I was very impressed, and I am lookign forward to having this one again,"
"It's pretty much a prime example of a US take on a classic style. Not necessarily my absolute favorite style (I'd like a little more maltiness), but it's obviously been a VERY influential beer like all of SN's classic brews."
"A great Porter to have on standby for the winter, pairs well with winter food flavors and earthy cheeses."
"poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass, appearance is extremely dark brown with a creamy off white head with a good bit of lacing. smells of roasted malt, coffee, and a bit nutty. tastes of dark chocolate malt with a nice bitter finish. mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied, this is a very delicious porter and definitely one of my favorites."
"HV"
"Pours a chestnut brown color with ruby highlights, average khaki head that dissipated into a sparse cap that left some webby lacing. The aroma is of toasted brown bread, light milk chocolate and caramel. The taste is of a semi-sweet chocolate milk, light coffee and a kiss of hops in the end. The feel is chewy with prickly carbonation to add a little crispness; finishes malty sweet. A fairly easy drinking porter, very smooth despite the carbonation, nice mellow flavors."
"D_One of the all time best porters which never seems to dissapoint."
"I could drink these all night. Very good porter."
"I'd say this is a dependable porter for when you know you want one but don't quite want to experiement with something else and be let down."
"8/4/7/4/14 (3.7/5)"
"I do think it could be one that would be worthwhile in cooking into sauces and when I do give it another try and but more, I think one will be dedicated to that."
"D: nice drinking beer and a great go to porter. Another great brew from Sierra Nevada"
"Robust, malty brew. Good nose and appearance. Not a strong alcohol taste makes it very drinkable. Good flavorful porter with a nice finish. Good porter."
"D: This dark beer sits pretty heavy in the stomach, but its medium body makes it pretty drinkable. I don't think I could have more than a few of these before getting full, but it's definitely an enjoyable beer to drink."
"Drinkability. Overall, solid but not as good as Anchor Porter. Would drink again."
"(rated Feb 8, 2007)"
"Future outlook: Solid in all areas. Repeat business likely."
"Very easy to drink, tasty, smooth and satisfying."
"Great porter something to have around, definately try great dinner or lunch or, hell, fer breakfast if one were so inclined"
"D- I'm not sure if I got an old six pack or what. I didn't really care for it that much, that sour flavor overpowered what balance it seemed to have at first. I will try another in the future just to see if its the same. Cheers!"
"The finish is acidic on the front with a burnt sugar looming on the end. Overall it is a good American Porter."
"I like SN beers, but this one by far won't be making it back into the rotation. I have to wonder if I have a bad one here - seems like I'm the outlier on not liking this beer."
"Wanted to like this beer more because the brewery is so legendary. Oh well--guess I'll have to pick up some more and re-review!"
"Pours a pitch black like ever porter should. Sierra Nevada d does not release anything that is not worth while. The head seems to come off quick and the body is a little lighter than I would have thought, but that makes it easier to have a few in one sitting. Most porters are like digging into a big steak and taters dinner, which is great, but sometimes it nice to enjoy a few without taking a nap. And non of the sweetness that ruins 90 percent of porters. As far as porters go, this is second only to Central Waters."
"D - A smooth and tasty Porter, I can see having a few of these in one sitting. I will make sure to have a few on hand at all times this winter."
"D: This was a true delight to put down. I thought I was drinking a stout towards the end. I reckon due to the cask, this was much smoother than other porters or even Sierra Nevada in a bottle or keg. Less bitter, slicky smooth and lip smacking delicious."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and coats your mouth. A very enjoyable porter, one you can easily have more than one of. Citric note note might not be for everyone, but it sure worked for me."
"This is one of my favorite American porters. It is readily available and not too expensive. The head pours about 2.5 fingers, it's thick ,rich and lasts a long time. I will buy a six pack whenever it is available when buying beer from now on. If you like dark, thick, slightly sweet and very tasty beer, do yourself a favor and try some soon, you will not be disappointed."
"D - very drinkable, a great porter. will enjoy many more"
"Sierra Nevada has another home run here, and this porter can go the distance in nearly every department. If you find yourself settled indoors with good company on a chilly, late autumn evening and have Sierra Nevada porter in your hand, you'll need for no other beer."
"This beer tastes like an ice-fishing cabin amongst a small pine pond after a fresh snow. Probably my new favorite widely-distributed porter."
"Drinkability: Haven't fallen in love with beer this dark yet, but it is a beer to be sipped rather than drank. I would drink it if I was in the mood for a really dark beer or if I was eating a meal. A one and done."
"Very easy to drink."
"D: Excellent porter. Another fine offering from Sierra Nevada. This is a great session beer!"
"Overall, this is a very nice American porter."
"D - This beer goes down incredibly easy. It's very light for a porter and is flavored very well, there is little to no alcohol taste, no dryness...it's very, very good tasting and affordable porter."
"d- A taste that is both bold and fruity sweet, and only a little bit heavy. This is a good solid sweet-ish porter, and I enjoy it enough to have several."
"D: Very drinkable. Knocked back a few this evening. Very enjoyable. Not a blockbuster porter for me but a very nice, well balanced brew that I would be happy to drink anytime."
"D - This beer is easily drinkable."
"Sierra Nevada rocks! The don't make any bad beer (I personally hated the 2008 Anniversary, but people seem to like it). This porter is great - I usually don't drink porters, as for a similar taste I just drink stouts, but I really like this. Pours dark brown with a nice head that stays nice. Smell is very coffee and chocolate, and taste is similar - nice and malty. I would've liked a little more carbonation as by the bottom of the glass its a little flat. Blend is great - not a strong beer and the taste isn't overwhelming - I've gotten so used to imperial stouts and double IPAs that I almost expect to be overwhelmed by good beer, but this is definitely an easy and very, very tasty drink."
"D - This is very drinkable and affordable compared to some of the more 'complex' porters. An excellent 'gateway' porter for the uninitiated. I could drink a few of these."
"Poors a dark, rich black, with some ruby hues. A nice tan head that fades rather quickly. To me the smell was of roasted and chocolate malt, but was rather faint. What makes this beer so good is its taste, which is of chocolate and a hint of coffee with a slight hop finish. It is delicious and very easy to drink. I highly recommend this beer."
"D: A pretty good drinkability with a decent mouthfeel and taste combination. Definitely a very good beer overall; solid porter."
"body? a bit light - no legs (-). not as thick as I would like it, but this leaves the advantage of being more drinkable (+)."
"Great job SN."
"The taste has a range of toasty elements, mostly coffee with a hint of chocolate and burnt leaves. It's fairly sweet and thick, with an interesting, slightly flowery, faint bitterness in the finish and aftertaste, adding an unusual and satisfying hoppy quality. Smooth and intriguing, it has a strong toasty quality without any burnt skunk quality that porters and stouts can sometimes have."
"Pours dark, almost black, with a lively off color head that falls to decent lacing. Smells strong and toasty, with a healthy dose of roasted malt. The flavor is assertively chocolatey, like a mouthful of fine bittersweet baking chocolate. There is a nice smokey bitterness on the back end, but the finish is fairly unobtrusive. The mouthfeel is properly thin, faintly clingy, with a little sparkle of carbonation. This is a respectable porter, quite drinkable."
"D: Pretty damned drinkable. A very accessible beer that is available nationwide, isn't too heavy and tastes great. I can't think of a more sessionable porter. This is quite good and very solid. Will be keeping this in the fridge because since it does lack that warming quality, it can be easily enjoyed year around."
"M- The body was pretty thick compared to the other porters I have had and wasn't that much thinner than the SN Stout. The overall feel was quite pleasant."
"Overall, a very nice, very drinkable porter."
"D: This is a really nice American porter. A bit hoppier than some, but still very well balanced and delicious. This'll be great as the days get shorter and the nights get colder."
"I liked this beer a lot, probably one of my favorite porters. I think it just edges out Bigfoot as the best beer from this brewery. Just so well balanced and tasty and drinkable. So many flavors can be tasted and its all blended together wonderfully. I will be getting sixers of this in the future."
"T/M/D: A full-flavoured dark malt, a leafy hop presence, and a bitter and dry finish. Quite an impressive brew. This will make for a great fall selection."
"Overall, a solid brew. We're having one of our first cool, fall-like days here in Portland, and it's matching the weather perfectly. It paired great with shepherd's pie and bit of dark chocolate. When it's on sale, it's a great value, but I'll pick up Black Butte a few more times before needing some variety."
"Looks like a quart of 30weight with a massive rocky head that ain't goin' nowwhere. Yummy burnt & earthy aroma. Taste is mild and inviting, lots of burnt taste, some coffee, little caramel. Smooth as smooth can be. Drinkability is off the freakin' chart. Wow, can't beleive I waited this long to try this one. An excellent porter - highly recommend."
"This brew poured a dark rich brown with a solid head and decent lacing. This one had more bite than I recall from previous SNPs. It was missing some of the sweetness that I was looking for, and instead had a pronounced alcoholic warmth. Some of the flavors just sort of lumped together in the end. I gave it a higher score than my writing would suggest, but I swear it was much better when I had it last. Old bottle...?"
"Not my favorite from Sierra Nevada, just reaslly bland for its style, you do not hear much about this one for a reason I guess, will probably skip this one next time, might be worth trying"
"Decent beer. I like darker beers and have recently tried Anchor Porter and Rogue's Mocha Porter, so when I saw this in my local store, I jumped all over it, hoping it would match up. It had a good taste but smelled a little sour. It was a typical porter in that the view through was nil. It smooth and drinkable and compared to the others, much better price. Pretty much always available so when funds are low, I have something to fall back on."
"Drinkability - I'm glad I got a 6 pack for my first Sierra Nevada Porter."
"D - Moderate. I can't personally pound rich brews, but this is another great offering from SN."
"Pours an almost-black color, with a tan head that's just a bit weak. Smells of smoke and some coffee, and tastes of coffee, smoke, licorice. Good flavors, just a bit two-dimensional compared to some of the other porters on the market. I'd recently tried a couple of the west coast anniversary porters, and so this might not be a fair comparison, but there it is. A good porter, very good actually, but not top tier."
"Poured a black-like color topped with a small tan head. Not much lace either. Chocolate aroma, with a malty, coffee taste, and relatively smooth with bitter coffee in the finish. Medium to full-bodied, rich and bold. Not my favorite style but pretty well done within the style."
"Great brew could drink this all the time."
"Well it's not as good as my beloved Anchor Porter but it is very good and quite drinkable. Glad I bought a six pack of it."
"Pretty good, it smells a lot different than it tastes. Very well balanced and very refreshing. Some nice tangyness on the tongue and some nice hops peek through."
"Overall, for the price this is a solid porter. Easy drinking with some nice flavors."
"D- Definitely a session porter. Very balanced and easy going down. One of the better American Porters I have had."
"Better than average porter, but not by much. Pours a dark toasted brown with a thick tan head that soon leaves way to a nice film, medium amounts of lacing are present. The aroma is of dark roasted sweet malts, a bit nutty and perhaps even some chocolate but nothing real intense. Mouthfeel is slightly thin for most porters, but it is not out of line. The flavor is good but it doesn't grab my attention. Roasted malts and that's about it. The finish is a bit weak which coincides with the mouthfeel. Don't get me wrong I enjoy this beer greatly, but the bottom line is that this is slightly above average for a porter."
"This beer was outstanding. Overall, its best quality was the balance. In my opinion some porters can be a bit over the top due to the dark grains (but not as much as a stout!), but this one managed to pull off the act effortlessly. I'm going to have another one!"
"Another solid Sierra Nevada brew"
"Nice blend of taste, smell, and not too strong alcohol make this a very drinkable beer."
"I poured a chilled bottle into a plastic (yes, plastic) cup. The lameness of the cup was offset, however, by the beautiful Cezanne-esque sunset under which I drank this enjoyable, but not quite ""refreshing," beer."
"Overall impression: Nice example of the style - this one is drinkable and well made."
"T-Rich coffee flavor with notes of sweetness (carmel) good medium body brew with a very good level of carbonation and is exceptionally smooth. Good malty finish very easy to drink and well balanced."
"Sierra Nevada produces many great products, but Sierra Nevada Porter is one of the brewer's best, and it's one of my favorite porters in existence. The combination of chocolate, malt, hops, coffee, and other complex flavors make for a delicious treat any time of year, and for any occasion."
"Good beer, a solid offering from SA."
"Drinkability: The Sierra line of beers is definetly growing on me. I think a lot of it is availability and price. Always a good combo!"
"M/D - A little thin on the mouthfeel but overall very good. A very good American porter."
"It leaves a lingering coffee flavor and dryness after you drink it, and welcomes you back again. Perhaps the only thing keeping me from sessioning this is it really started to dry my palate, and a few of these would probably leave my throat parched."
"D - Definitely good and has improved over time (or maybe it's my tastes). Still better examples out there."
"Medium bodied at best this smooth and nearly dare I say refreshing porter (literally and figuratively) surprised me. It's like they took that great yeast from the pale ale and applied it to a well-done porter. This may be go well to cut and cleanse the palate of a rich chocolate delicacy without disrupting it."
"This was my first porter and I was frankly expecting something a little more dramatic, but the subtlety and smoothness of this porter really impressed me. It would be a very drinkable beer any time of year (it's 95 degrees outside right now), and I'll definitely purchase a 6-pack of these in the future."
"Notes to self: Simply amazing. In my opinion, the best porter out there. If you haven't tried it, you hate your life. I left a lot out of this review... so go try it and try to tell me im wrong about an A+"
"Appearance was a deep brown color with a solid head. Nose was as expected, and delicious: lots of roasted malt, some light chocolate and coffee, some light dried fruit. Nice aromas, and a lot of them. Flavor was a little unexpected. A lot hoppier than expected, and mostly lacking in the mild sweetness the nose was pointing at. The roasted malt is quite smooth, and rolls right into that hoppiness that sticks around in a fairly-long aftertaste. Body was likewise a little thinner than I'd hoped. Overall, a tasty beer, although not quite as good as I though the nose was advertising."
"I'm really curious as to what this is made from. I'm guessing unsulphured molasses is a prime ingredient. A good, sessionable porter, though nothing awe inspiring."
"D: very delicious, will definitely have again although I have been more impressed by other porters"
"Although it's nice and dark, that's about the only thing here that resembles a porter. There's not much to smell, and very little to taste: no coffee, no dark flavor, not much bitterness, no toastiness... nothing. Very namby-pamby. If this were coffee, I'd file it under Taster's Choice. If you want a good six-pack porter for regular consumption, buy Otter Creek Stovepipe."
"Thoughts: Sweet porter here from Sierra Nevada, I particularly enjoyed the smokey aspect and the hops. Good stuff."
"D - Not bad but nothin special."
"D - I find this to be a mellow beer - flavourful, but very accessible, balanced, and easy drinking. Very sessionable."
"Drinkability: I would get this if I was looking for a widely available porter. It's not particular memorable, but if I'm in the mood for downing a few porters, it definitely fits the bill."
"Drinkability = I really love this porter. It's very smooth. The taste is great. It has a relatively low ABV. Nothing harsh about it. One of my favorites. (Doesn't hurt that it's well priced and easily available)"
"D- Very drinkable. I love this beer. I think it could be a nice session beer, but I think a beer like this need to be savored and not one to drink too quickly. You want to enjoy the flavor."
"D: I really enjoy an occational Porter, and at 5.6% ABV I could enjoy this one often"
"D: This is a very good porter, I would definitely drink this with almost anything, Red meat especially. hell, even with dessert."
"It's very comforting to know this beer is always available at the liquor stores around me... I may crave this sometime down the road."
"M&D: Mouthfeel is full but not particularly heavy. The body and carbonation comes together in a nice creamy fashion, making the whole experience rather creamy. This is an awesome porter! I like it a bunch and would recommend it to those looking for a good dark chewy beer."
"Spot on flavor for a porter. Strong bittersweet chocolate that finishes with a shot of bitter hop. Very good body with great carbonation."
"The mouthfeel is a medium-bodied, and just shy of what I'd call ""creamy."" Pretty drinkable, could go through a few of these without problem."
"D - Good beer. I always like Sierra Nevada though. Classic beer, will definitely drink again."
"D: Fairly easy to drink for a porter. Probably as sessionable as a porter could be."
"Mouthfeel is pretty thin, nice a smooth carbonation, but just feels weak. Pretty drinkable because its not very filling for how dark and creamy it is."
"This was all right. Drinkable, but I won't seek it out."
"medium body with a good crispness. good carbonation. nice lace. i dig this beer. could do a session. will buy again. great example of an american porter."
"Solid west-coast porter - looks very nice, smells and tastes good, feels great, and is very drinkable. Readily available and inexpensive, as well, which never hurts. Not quite as good as the Sierra Nevada Stout, but great when you're looking for something a little lighter."
"It pours dark black and truly opaque with a caramel brown head. The creamy mouthfeel explodes into a festival of well orchestrated flavors. Caramel and chocolate malts are dominating the bouquet offering coffee and toast on a solid sweet foundation. The hops are subtle and sit very well between the roasted flavors. At the very end the hops become dominating but before they develop into a bitterness they fade out leaving you with the urge to have another party on your palate. I simply couldn't stop sipping it. Every time I had a sip, I found a new nuance, noticing some citrus in the middle or the changes in mouthfeel while the beer lost slowly carbonation."
"Black patent and other more lightly roasted grains were prevelant. On the lighter side for drinkability which pushed it up some. Solid brew, would buy it again."
"M/D: Not extremely sweet on the feel of the mouth and not very bitter either. It has great drinkability and I will be a frequent purchaser."
"I don't know why, but I was really caught off guard by this beer. I think it's because I am used to SN's best beers being focused on the hops, and this beer shows that these guys don't need hops to make a great beer."
"Now this is a great American Porter if there ever was one. It pours an inky black color that won't allow any light through. The head is modest, tawny but not overly dark, with tons of lacing. This beer is modestly carbonated, medium bodied, and very smooth and creamy. This beer is exceptionally smooth and creamy, rather. The taste is a very well balanced blend of caramel malts, molasses hints, toasted grains, roasted coffee, and a citrusy tang in the hops. There isn't much bitterness to these hops and some of the tang dissipates nicely as the beer settles. This is too sweet to be a British Porter, but it is representative of the style and very worth seeking out. The mouthfeel is creamy and just right. There is no lasting bitterness yet there is a slight metallic hint in the aftertaste which I'm going to knock a half point off the drinkability factor. I really like this beer, haven't had it in years, but will rectify the matter by seeking it out again soon. L'Chaim."
"A truly excellent beer"
"Much like lays potato chips, its classic."
"We cooked a very tasty beef stew with this last night and it came out nearly perfect."
"This is a very good beer that I will buy again and again. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability- A really nice 5.6% porter that I look forward to enjoying in the future."
"D: One of the most drinkable porters around with an interesting tangy hops finish. SN pumps out another winner."
"I found this one to be very drinkable, not sweet enough to make me tire of the taste, and not so heavy as to become too much of a good thing. I could easily drink more than one of these at a sitting and enjoy it the entire time."
"Yummy."
"D-the smoothest porter I have ever had"
"Pours black with a small light tan head. Smell was roasty malts, and bit of chalky chocolate mostly. Taste was very balanced, and had a noticeable hop presence but didn't come off overly hopped or metallic, like I find some hoppy dark beers do. Quite good flavor, although somewhat mild, and a nice porter in all. Will definitely try again when not in a smoke-filled bar."
"This beer poured black with a fluffy three-finger tan head that didn't dissipate quickly. The smell was mostly roasted malts with some hints of coffee. The taste is mostly roasted malts that provide a lot of semi-bitter sweet coffee taste without much if any of the chocolate flavor that also gets associated with porters. A tasty beer, but not as complex as some other beers of the same style. The mouthfeel is pleasantly thick without an overwhelming amount of carbonation. This beer is very drinkable for a porter and I could imagine completing a sixpack over the course of the night."
"Good stuff. I recommend it."
"Really not too much to say that could be improved upon with this brew.. very nice... I don't normally appreciate American porters with this much hoppiness in the flavor.. but I gotta say, it works."
"Poured deep brown with about an inch of head with very good lacing. The color was a dark brown. I smelled malts and coffee. Taste was not that much different. I was a little disappointed as this was a little less complex than other porters that I enjoy."
"D: This is my new favorite porter. Everything I wanted and more. Just like the SN Pale Ale, I think this is a great representation of the style. More please!"
"Drinkability is excellent. This is a nice tasty porter that is super easy to sip. Very nice session worthy beer, especially for cooler days or nights. Another solid offering from Sierra Nevada."
"Keep in mind that in my area Sierra Nevada Brewing products are very well stocked. I usually enjoy SN Pale Ale with bottling ages of four to six weeks. I first spotted SN porter in the stores during January. My porter was four months old when purchased. Congratulations to Sierra Nevada Brewing as they appear to be very deliberate with their bottle aging!"
"Pours a nice espresso black color with a beautiful thick head consisting of tiny tan bubbles making their way up. Smells good with hints of milk chocolate, coffee and some fresh cut grass. Tastes excellent. Smooth, round, sweet milk chocolate covered cherries, very light hints of bitter coffee, sweetness dominates. Oily coated mouthfeel with some soapy finish. Great session!"
"D- A very good porter, not very heavy for such a dark beer. This is a good beer from Sierra Nevada."
"The beer poured nicely with a generous light tan head and a coffee black body. The taste featured notes of roasted malt, a surprising degree of mild citrus hops, and a bit of black coffee on the finish. It was medium to heavy bodied but still quite drinkable and warming as well. I would definitely have one again."
"d - i wasn't really into the hoppiness of this porter. Overall, not bad though."
"Roasted barley, chocolate, with herbal under tones are present. The flavor of hops is a little too prevalent for my tastes. I can't recall a porter with this much hop flavor. I have had much better porters but this is not a bad porter."
"All in all, a decent yet unremarkable porter; I expected something a bit bolder from Sierra Nevada. A solid option if you're stuck in Macroland, but Anchor or Black Butte porters are more complex and better recommended if you have the choice."
"An enjoyable beer. Dark in color and smooth taste. Characteristics of coffee and almonds can be discerned. Smell compliments the taste while not being strong. It is a strong tasting and heavy beer and not one I'd want to drink more then one of in a sitting."
"This is nothing to reject, or turn up one's nose to, yet this isn't something that will knock off the socks."
"Another outstanding product from the folks at Sierra Nevada."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A very easy drinking porter IMO. A good place to start if you're not into dark beers."
"I can't wait to try the stout."
"Pours very dark brown, nearly black in color with ruby hints at the edges and about 2 fingers of long-lasting pillowy brown head. Wonderful aroma, some lightly burnt dark malt, chocolate, caramel and just a hint of hops. Great taste, the lightly burnt dark malts dominate but chocolate and caramel are also present with just a hint of hop flavor. Some bitterness in this fairly dry finish from the hops which is accentuated by the dark malts. Mouthfeel is good, medium body with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, there is just a slight astringency but thats the only detractor in this beer. This is a damn good beer that is easily quaffable. Definitely recommended."
"d: definitely a great porter and definitely the porter that you would expect from sierra nevada in terms of balance and flavors"
"Pours an almost completely opaque black with a huge tan head. At the end of the pour you could see it getting a little bit cloudy from the sediment from bottle conditioning. As the head fades, plenty of lacing is left. Smells of citrus and toast. Tastes of coffee and sweet malt richness, with a hint of lemon. Full bitterness from the hops. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Carbonation levels are excellent. Man this is a rich, smooth, wonderfull tasting beer. Another great beer from Sierra Nevada."
"T: great well balanced beer, think snpa of the porter world. this is not a big beer, or a crazy off flavor beer, its a solid example. its got some roasted there is an almost chocolate smoothness hidden behind a hop cover, its so well in tuned and tastes great, a little bit of everything, some hops, some dryness, a tart flavor, some burnt malt...its just good"
"Poured from the bottle into a Sam Adams glass. It's dark brown with a tan head that dissipated after a couple sips. There's only a mild odor of coffee, but, my nose is stuffy. Smooth and creamy with a dry, slightly bitter aftertaste. Fairly well drinkable."
"Drinkablity: Very tasty and sessionable porter."
"D: Great example of an American porter that is not extremely hopped. Good balance and very drinkable."
"Sierra Nevada Porter might be overlooked in the brand which known for its hoppy beers (Pale Ale, Harvest, Celebration). It's mellow, different, and more importantly tastes good."
"Overall a top notch brew and very good example of how a porter should be done."
"Flavor starts off with roasted malt and coffee. A chocolate-like sweetness makes a brief appearance before giving away to a earthy, slightly bitter finish. Mouth feel is rich and creamy with moderate carbonation. Overall a tasty, easy drinking porter."
"Nice porter that I will try again. Not up with the elite ones like the Edmund Fitzgerald but still a nice porter."
"This is a very tasty beer. One to sip on a cold afternoon or evening."
"A nice porter but will have this one and then go on to something else."
"D = An approachable porter which could serve as a good standby beer."
"I love porters. They are one of my favorite styles, and this one should not be missed. This beer looks great, tastes great, and drinks great. Nothing more to say."
"Poured out into my Sam Smith stout glass. great apperance, very dark-rich hued brew. The incredible thing is the head. Very foamy, long retention. Aromas are very hoppy, smokiness,malts, light coffees and faint chocolates are coming through. Great mouthfeel, suprisingly light for the apperance, clean finish, plenty of tart hops at the end. This makes drinkability very easy. Highly enjoyable session brew."
"Just sampled Anchor Brewery's porter, and wasn't impressed... this, on the other hand was really great... pours an opaque black color with a nice frothy head with decent staying power... smell is full of cocoa and chocolate, and the taste strongly complements the aroma, with a blast of dark, burnt chocolate, cocoa, and espresso... a great, smooth beer that goes down smooth without the slightest hint of bitterness... I really enjoyed this beer.... another fine offering from one of my favorite American breweries... great stuff... will certainly purchase this again.... copped a single 12oz bottle from Wine and More in West Orange... and being impressed with this sample, am eager to try Sierra Nevada's stout... Great mouthfeel and good drinkability... Definitely recommended..."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this beer is exactly what you would expect for a porter, but there isnâ€™t anything about it to me that makes it stand out amongst the others. Overall, however, itâ€™s a pretty good beer."
"If a pirate were grilling whatever turtle the nets picked up...this beer be making it taste bettter!...."
"Drinkability is hard to ppinpoint for me because I'm new to the style but I could definitely acquire a taste for this porter. I could drink several at a sitting and the alcohol content is such it would make a decent session beer. I'm looking forward to seeing how more beers from this style strike me!"
"This is a great porter with sort of an Irish Dry Stout character to it. Dark brown with a creamy head and an earthy coffee aroma. It features citrusy hops, a nice roasted malt tanginess and a creamy yet dry mouthfeel. I would most certainly have another."
"D - I feel embarrassed that I have put off trying this beer. It's great. The hops slowly build up on the back of my tongue, but this is definitely a session beer."
"there's good balance here, which i don't think is a virtue unto itself, but comes across well. solid brew. drinkable but flavorful...perhaps a prototypical american porter"
"[D]: It's not too thick, too bitter or too alcoholic to drink casually for an extended period. The hops aroma makes it quite refreshing for a porter."
"Overall, an excellent porter. A bigger hop presence is an interesting change from some of the other porters I've had."
"Smooth and drinkable."
"D: I am normally not a big porter fan, but this brew is simply outstanding. Perhaps it's the somewhat bitter character, or maybe it's the awesome roasted malts, or maybe the mouthfeel!!!! Or maybe, it's just an awesome beer all around."
"D - For a big porter fan it would certainly be easy to make a night of this particular beer"
"d- the porter is good and i will have this one again, hopefully on tap"
"Sierra just makes great beer. The Porter tastes exactly the way you would hope a Porter to taste. Has that undertone of chocolate and balances nicely with richness."
"Poured a deep brown, cola-like but darker, with a very sturdy tan head that lasted. Aroma is deep and pleasing, caramel malt and toasted grain, with a sweet fruityness. Taste is full and richer than some stouts, with nuttyness, cola notes, and a nice bitter chcolate finish. A fine, well rounded beer, very satisfying."
"Drinkability- A nice and enjoyable porter . I will most likely try this in the near future."
"Poured into a tulip shaped tasting glass. This is a very nice looking beer, the carbonation breaks similar to fine champagne, the head is a nice 1/2 inch creamy color over a dark purplish brew. I really like the look of this beer. The nose is sweet, but complex there is a lot going on there just hard for me to isolate what it is, maybe malt, and spiciness. The taste and mouthfeel is very good well balanced good body and nice bite. Very nice beer the only thing it is lacking is the drinkability, but a really good beer only one leaves someone feeling satisfied."
"Taste is heavily roasted with coffee as the main component. The taste is more burned than the smell would expect and gives the beer a nice maltbitter on top of the hop bitterness, which is somewhat overpowered by the big roast. Nevertheless, bitterness is pretty clean and only a little earthy and very little resinous. Drinkability at first is lower than in the end, when my mouth has grown into the big hop and maltbitterness. Good beer."
"drinkability is good. this is not a rich porter, nor does it possess much character. a decent example of the style at best."
"Pours a very dark brown, with ruby hues, and with a huge tan head that has good retention and leaves good lacing as it disappears. Aroma is of cocoa, roasted malt, fruit, and citrus and herbal like hops. Not a very strong aroma here. Taste is well balanced for a porter with the strong (for a porter) hop presence. Taste has a roasted coffee like character along with some bittersweet chocolate and a hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and creamy, and this certainly is an easy drinker. Good Porter from a good brewery."
"I think I prefer their stout, but there is nothing wrong with this. Seems pretty approachable for a dark beer."
"A classic American porter, and for good reason. Rich, substantial, and balanced. Yum."
"I like this alot.Its one of the best plain jane porters Ive ever had in my time drinking craft beers.Maybe my favorite of them all.I will forsure look to buy this again in the future."
"D - enjoyable brew, have a few!"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer pours a jet black color with a thin, tan head. Nose is slightly roasted malt with a hint of chocolate. The taste is very similar to the nose with a slight hoppy bitterness that I've come to expect from SN. The mouthfeel is full bodied with minimal carbonation. Overall, a decently drinkable brew, sessionable but not quaffable."
"D - Good beer packed with flavour & well balanced. Could put away a few without a problem."
"D- with 40 degree nights having a few of these generates a warm comfortable feeling. but these traditionally were cold weather beers so game on. in the heat of summer ehh, i'd go for something fizzy...and yellow! nah, just kidding. i'd go for something fizzy and light brown. with lots of hops."
"D: Easy to drink and tastes good, but I'd take an Edmund Fitzgerald over this guy."
"This is a hoppy porter - citric fruitiness worked in nicely. A unique, tasty American porter."
"Pours a dark brown black color with a head that fills to the tip of creamy, khaki color, lacing sticks to the glass. Smell is a little hoppy, little coffee too. Taste is creamy, with coffee in the background. Just enough carbonation to prepare you for the next drink."
"Sierra Nevada does it again. Starts with a nice, dark, coffee-like appearance and an aroma of roasted malts and that faint whiff of hops. The first sip reveals a roasted malty coffee-like flavor that finishes with the slight floral hint of hops. Perfect. Darker beers aren't really my thing, but if they all taste like this, that will change."
"Dark black with brown tints at the sides. Appearance is pretty good with a fluff of coffee-colored head. The smell was instant roast. The taste was light, roasty, some hops, good mouthfeel, delicious. Wow, there are some coffee flavors! This is another fine beer from Sierra Nevada. I have got to get to Chico and check this place out."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a slightly creamy consistency, but nowhere near the creaminess found in a milk or cream stout. Highly drinkable, yet robust porter thats always delicious and easily found."
"Readily available at any respectable beer store. 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, poured out a deep black color. Very thin head that disappears quickly and leaves a rather thing lacing. The smell is a little lighter than a usual porter, not so heavy on the chocolate and coffee aromas, but pretty balanced between hops and the roasted odors. The taste is very balanced and enjoyable. Hints of chocolate and coffee without being too present, and not very heavy on hops and alcohol like a chocolate stout. Very balanced, not too much of anything, but a nice combination of its ingredients. Overall light and drinkable. I'd prefer this over a high-alcohol content chocolate stout. Delicious and balanced."
"M & D: A bit lighter than it should be, but quite smooth. As a result, it goes down more easily than the thicker porters. I could drink this all day."
"A solid and really easy drinking porter, definitely one I'd have again."
"Drinkability: Right on style. A nice porter. Places second in the race when compared to GLBC Edmund Fitzgerald Porter."
"It's too roasty to handle a lot of. Would go perfectly with blackened chicken, though."
"Pours very dark with nice creamy head that lasts. Looks a lot like their stout, but has a more hoppy aroma. Very smooth malty taste. Good stuff. I liked this a lot. Flavor of chocolate, coffee, and touch of molasses. I would definitely have again. Lacing was good."
"Yet another Great offering from the Sierra Nevada Brewers."
"Drinkability- A little heavy to have more than a couple but a very pleasant sipping beer."
"Nearly opaque dark brown with lots of red in the undertone. Begins with a thick, tan colored head, that settles gradually. (After about 5-10 minutes it was 1/8 inch.) Great lacing. Caramel and chocolate and lots of roastiness in the smell. There are some hops there, but they are low, low down. Floral hoppiness comes through in the taste, nicely, on the finish. They then roll out in the aftertaste. The rest of the taste is a thickening of the caramel/chocolate/roasted smell. Flavor of a deep (full city) roast of coffee without the acidity. Medium body with a low-medium apparent carbonation. An earlier reviewer suggested it was oily, but for me it comes off soft. Again, it's comparable to a full city roast coffee with bitterness o hops adding a nice balance. I actually prefer this to the most recent Am Porter I've reviewed. Good drinkability."
"D: A good beer, not a standout though, their Pale Ale is better, but a drinkable selection."
"I gave this 4's across the board. A nice American porter. Poured up a dark reddish brown that appears black until held up to a light. Off white head lasted about 90 seconds until subsiding to a khaki coloured frost over the liquid's surface. Smell is unsweetened bakers chocolate and used coffee grounds. A bit earthy, as well. Bitter hops noticeable, but this is nearly all malt. Mostly dry throughout, this is full of dry, roasted cereal profiles. Mouthfeel is exactly where it needs to be for the style. A very drinkable porter. Nice."
"Sierra Nevada Porter pours a deep, dark, virtually jet black color with a light tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Chocolate and coffe notes dominate the aroma. There is a medium mouthfeel. The flavor starts with chocolate and coffee notes, segues into a floral hop flavor, then back into chocolate and coffee notes. A very enjoyable American take on porter. Recommended."
"12oz stubby with that classic Sierra Nevada label and packaging. Pours dark brown with reddish edges and has a great looking creamy, fluffy head. Looks delicious. First aroma to hit is a lime citrus sweetness and tang from the fresh domestic hops. Underlying cocoa, Dark chocolate and banana bread aromas along with a mellow roast coffee. Taste is the roast malt and cocoa flavors to start leading to a medium long finish highlighted by the lime accented hops. A very well balanced flavor profile. Easy to drink and not too heavy this dark delicious brew is actually quite refreshing. Would love to try it with BBQ."
"im not sure i could tell the difference between this one and the stout.good beer pours out almost black.nice thick creamy head that lasts and clings down the side of the glass.fills your mouth with flavor and leaves no doubt that you are drinking a adult beverage.sirra nevada has done it again they never ceaseto amaze me.ill have to keep some of these on hand."
"Very dark brown with burgundy highlights. A quality, beige head starts out a good two fingers tall, nice and sticky. Roasted malt aromas, coffee grounds, nuts. A slight richness complimented by an earthy hop presence. Malty flavor with a burnt edge. Pleasantly bittersweet finishing with more English-type hops to balance. Smooth, medium body with gentle carbonation. An all-around good example of the style, like most of Sierra Nevada's beers."
"A yummy enjoyable porter which I find highly drinkable."
"Another solid porter. Pours a very nice color that is basically the same as others but the icing on the cake is this thick, light tan head and massive lacing. Smell was faint of roasted malts. Taste is somewhat subdued at first but what I picked up reminds me of a staple for the style. Roasted malts again, with hints of chocolate and even lesser noticeable coffee. Also a little hop kick hidden in there. Mouthfeel is lighter than I'd prefer but still good. Drinkability is way up there, almost too easy to down. Not necessarily the most innovative porter but that's not required for me to enjoy it. Straightforward and great."
"I had to give this beer a perfect score. It goes to show that in your local warehouse type liqour stores you see sierra nevada at 6.99/sixer as there are other beers ranging from 8.99-14.99. I'd have to say that Sierra Nevada Porter is a great beer to have during dinner. Its an extremely robust dark porter beer that can't be beat. I'll be reviewing the Pale Ale as well although I prefer this one."
"Not much to say about this one. I love Sierra Nevada but this is just a typical porter. Nothing to get too excited over. Smooth with a bitter aftertaste. A little too carbonated for this style IMO. Good session beer if you are in for a dark beer evening but would certainly not be my first choice when it comes to porters."
"Good solid porter."
"Lacks the big malty flavors anticipated in a big American porter, but a clean and roasty Porter. No major style or technical flaws."
"Tasty one, this. Chocolate and coffee with a velvety smooth, somewhat chalky feel that blankets the palate. A bitter, mocha finish seals the deal. Definately an easily-consumed stout, very tasty and smooth...one I look forward to meeting again."
"This beer pours a darkish brown color with a nice off-white head. I can detect hints of coffee in the aroma and in the taste as well. Smooth and there's a decent malt backbone as well. It goes down smooth and is very drinkable for a porter. A decent starter for those who haven't ever had a porter."
"A real quality porter. Was hoping for some cascade flavor, but i suppose that it really not needed. Easy to drink and tastey taboot!"
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: In the mouth this beer feels a bit lighter than I expected. It has a medium full body but feels a little watery. Carbonation is appropriate for this style. Feel is creamy and smooth for the most part. This is a brew that I'd have no quarrel about drinking again though I do prefer GLBC's Edmund Fitzgerald over this one."
"D- Good flavor and decent mouthfeel makes for a good beer- reminds me a lot of GL Edmund Fitz, but lacking some complexity."
"This beer has a remarkable deep color. The head is not too creamy. The most obvious thing that I found about this beer was how smooth it is as well as the lack of bitterness. I also think that it is a great value at $7.00 a six pack. It is my new favorite beer"
"The brew was poured pretty much black in color, probably would be considered a very dark brown, with the perfect sized tan (slightly dark) head that had great retention and left a great amount of lacing down the side of the glass. The aromas are roasted grains that give it such a great smell as it seems to act as the backbone for the entire brew. Mixed in with that great smell seem to be an excellent accompanists of caramel, some coffee like aroma and a somewhat (but in no way over powering) pungent hop scent. The taste is as good as the scent; it seems to start on the sweet side with roasted and chocolate malts coming out quite quickly with some notes of coffee mixed in. The end seems to have a break in the type of bitterness, at first I think it was due to the roasted grains but the finish is more of a citric hop. The feel is very smooth and creamy. Over all this is simply an excellent rendition of a Porter. I am glad that we have this readily available as it seems that most breweries today seem to be going to an extreme even with this type of a brew, not to say that is a bad thing but a lot of times you just want a classic."
"I love it when a beer surprises me. Sierra Nevada has a fine reputation, but I still wouldn't expect upper-echelon beers from them. Their porter approaches being just that. This beer is anything but pedestrian."
"Overall, this is a solid B+ performer. I will buy this beer again."
"Just enough sweetness to keep this beer very balanced, good inclusion of malt and hop flavors. This is a really good American porter."
"Pours a mostly opaque dark brown color, somewhat akin to a cola. Smells of slight toasted malt, coffee. Tastes of coffee, perhaps a litlle bit of dark chocolate type bitterness. Mouthfeel is thin and watery, but smooth. I suppose I could find a beer with more body, but this one is very nice. Very drinkable, could easily be a ""session"" type beer, if you are a huge fan of porters."
"D - It has the body of a Brown Ale. Very flavorful, but not very thick. I find most Porters to be very drinkable and this is no exception. The taste is there, but I was looking for it to have a full body, so that leaves something to be desired. I could definitely have another, and I wish I could, but after the second or third one, it would probably get a little boring. A great Porter from a great brewery. Thanks Sierra Nevada."
"Poured very dark brown from bottle into pint glass. 2 finger dark tan head quickly dissipates. Aroma is mostly roasted malts with some chocolate. Taste follows aroma is roasty malts, chocolate, and some smoke. Rather bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is rather thin. I don't love porters, but this one was drinkable. One was more than enough for me, though."
"Into a pint glass, pours a very dark brown with some ruby hues, a decent head starting out, shrinks to a thin film, with nice streaking lacing. The aroma has some good roasty malts, good sweetness. Taste is just classic porter, bittersweet chocolate, espresso, roasted malt, a bit chalky maybe, the mouth pretty smooth, a little too carbonated for me, pretty much a well done, typical porter."
"Fairly dry and light. Carbonation plays a role, but not much in this highly drinkable beer."
"Highly recommended. A very nice porter."
"Pours a dark brown with a hint of red around the edges. Frothy dense head fades quickly. The aroma is rather subdued with a bit of caramel and citrus hoppiness. Mouthfeel is on the thinner side but has a nice creaminess to it. Taste is chocolatey with a bit of a subtle bite from the hops. Lots of roasted malt goodness here. An easy drinking porter that doesn't overwhelm the palate. Very enjoyable."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with an inch and a half frothy tan head. Lacing and head retention are both good. It smells like roasted malt, caramel, chocolate, coffee and toffee. It tastes like coffee, roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate and caramel. There's also a good hoppy finish that lingers around a while. Mouthfeel is light/medium, with a bit of slickness. It's a little bit watery, more than I expected it to be. Drinkability is good, it goes down nice and smooth and it's well balanced and easy to drink. Overall, I think it's a decent porter. I think I could have this as a session beer occasionally."
"Overall I was very surprised by this beer. It is delicious and a great session beer. I've never had any Sierra Nevada beers but I will have to try more..."
"this beer is very drinkable, in fact, nearly sessionable perhaps."
"Its my two hundredth review, so I picked a beer that is something that Ive had but I haven't reviewed. It a standard looking porter with a deep deep brown complexion, ruby highlights peek throught the side, and it has, or should say had very little head. It quickly dissapated and left this very tiny ring around the glass. What is there is leaving some lacing but not much. The aromas are roasty to start, blended with some chocolate, but there is some oxidation in the background that give it a sort of musty aroma. Its very light bodied which also translates to the flavor of the beer. What flavors there are, are coming through, but they seem a little lackluster for this beer.The roast, chocolate and slight alcohol come thorough, and leave your mouth with a semi roasted after taste. It starts wirth sharp carbonation, and stays sharp in the middle. It dries out in the end really well, and leaves that roasty taste very nicely on your palette. Overall, Its a nice session porter. Leaves a little to be desired, but I might have this as my new back up beer in the fridge."
"Drinkability: A nice, smooth porter that blends the various aspects of the style well; typical of Sierra Nevada."
"Overall, a decent beer and quite drinkable. Not what I consider a typical porter, so if you have a hankerin' for a porter you may want to look elsewhere."
"Pretty damn drinkable, especially considering the medium body. A great treat for a cool night, and a solid, obviously american styled porter. A good choice for someone looking to introduce themselves to porters or stouts. Ill be loooking for this one again."
"This is one tasty american porter, complex and has a nicely balanced hop profile to go along with all that roasted malt character"
"Pours from the bottle about the color of Coke, but is a bit darker in the glass. This bottle of beer had almost no bubbles and the very slight head dissipated almost immediately. The smell was faint, but roasty and nice. The flavor is perfectly fine, though. This is a good, solid porter. If you like this style of beer (and I definitely do), this one is worth keeping around. It is as drinkable a porter as you will find: it's not an overwhelming beer in any way; the flavor is very nice, roasty and malty; the mouthfeel does seem to be plenty carbonated (not at all flat) despite the lack of a head on pouring, and at the same time I would call this a smooth beer. Overall very nice."
"pours a dark amber. Small head...about 2mm. Some lacing. Very little to the nose...more alcohol than anything. Taste is good...lighter for the style....a touch too carbonated...hints of cocoa and molasses...followed by an alcohol astringency...yeah a bit too carbonated...but refreshing...the roastedness is early but dissapears quick to watery alcohol taste....still quite drinkable but not as good as I remembered. This beer is about a b- across the board....good...definately above average...but overated here...not nearly as good for the style as their Pale Ale is...regardless...""an above average porter with good accessibility."" Would it be a travesty to say this isn't a whole lot better than Michelob's? I like this beer...but this beer plays it a little too safe...not enough flavor....high carbonation....good but overrated."
"Taste has a medley of dark malts with strong roasted coffee and chocolate flavors. Mouthfeel is medium but bolstered by just the right amount of carbonation for a velvety smooth texture. Ths is a quality product worth trying. Not a first rate porter but not far off it and well worth trying."
"A highly drinkable beer... I've had this one before, but don't remember it being this good. Wonderful"
"This beer is another quality brew from SN."
"This gives off a slight chocolaty aroma, with slight hints of coffee character. This brew is full of darkly roasted malt, but not overly burnt. It feels a bit coarse with the heavy amount of CO2, and finishes quite refreshingly."
"drinkability: high. mellow and comforting but well-balanced and not heavy. a beautiful beer."
"Easy drinking milder tasting well malted porter. Initial white head that dissipitates on top of coal black. Bit of molasses and roasted barley aroma. Tad of coffee and chocolate, tilted toward sweetness. Nicely and smartly carbonated. Quite the session ale."
"Eric"
"Watching a movie the other night, sampled this, Stone's and Smutty's porters. This was good, but my least favorite. It was a dark brown with a thick, coffee-colored head. It had a coffee aroma, and a coffee taste. Pretty one-dimensional. I thought it was harsher than the other porters I tried that evening."
"This is a great example of an American porter. Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a deep brown, forming a 1 inch head, that left medium lacing on the glass. The aroma is of roasted malts, along with a hint of coffee. The taste is roasted malts, and coffee, with a little bitterness at the end. Medium mouthfeel. This is a great porter to session. Very smooth. A great offering from Sierra Nevada."
"Overall I like this beer alot. It is very well-balanced and is somewhat unique in that it has enough hops to really match the malty and toasty notes."
"Drinkability: Delicious."
"Damn, this is one tasty Porter. Sierra Nevada nailed this one. Highly recommended."
"Rich dark brown almost black in color. Mild head with no lacing. Smells like burnt toast. The tastes is really bad, it reminds me of sucking on the filter of a cigarette. High carbonation on this one and it makes the mouth feel dry. This is not my kind of beer at all."
"This is a surprisingly light bodied beer which is smooth and creamy. Very drinkable and easily sessioned."
"Great American porter probably the best. I love it and can't get enough of it. A great winter brew."
"I am a fan of Porter style beers. I happened upon these 'beauts just a couple of days ago at a local wine shop and was very excited to take them home with me. I cracked open my first one and poured it into the glass, the color a deep deep brown and when tilted into the light hints of red and yellow. The head was amazing at first, but would settle a bit too quickly for my taste (I would be willing to bet if this were served on tap the head would be a tad thicker and linger a while longer). The smell was heavy on the coffee side and had hints (small) of chocolate. The taste was very decent, a bit more of a kick than some porters and had similar flavors to the smell with maybe a tad more of an earthy note to it. The mouth-feel was good and the finish was just as satisfying as the drink. I strongly recommend this beer for quiet nights at home or out at a bar (if they have it) not a party beer though, it really deserves to be savored."
"D: A very solid, easy-to-enjoy drinking beer. It's not the best ever, but it's certainly worth it."
"good beer, a nice wintry drink."
"A very nice porter for a very nice price."
"Drinkability - this is very good and quite sessionable."
"The drinkability is good, a solid porter. Prosit, MK"
"D: Porter isn't my favorite style, but I've had much better than this. It's drinkable, but I won't be buying another anytime soon."
"Overall - A good porter that has morning to night drinkability. Great job SN! If you haven't tried this porter as of yet, do yourself a favor and pick up a six-pack. You won't be disappointed."
"An all-around terrific brew. Flavorful, satisfying, yet not overpowering in terms of mouthfeel or abv."
"A great beer. This would be great to wash down a plate of beef brisket with a thick barbacue sauce. A must try for anyone who enjoys the style. Nice job from a solid brewery."
"Bottom line: Great sample of the style that no beer lover should miss trying!"
"This is one of the best americnan porters I've had. It has a strong chocolate malt backbone both on smell and taste. It has an excellent mouthfeel and is one of the easiest to drink porters I've had. This is a chili wheather beer. I tried it at a bar and may go pick up a six. It was truly a treat. I recommend it to everyone."
"Drinkability is pretty good. I like this beer but it could be just a tad stronger."
"A good example of the style and a nice go-to porter. Definitely recommended to fans of the style."
"overall: this is a wonderful example of the style. middle of the road, yet thoroughly enjoyable, with a brilliant combination of flavors."
"This is a very drinkable beer, and a nice fall and winter seasonal choice. I would definitely have Sierra Nevada Porter again."
"The pour into my Sam Smith pint raises a two-finger plus head (thanks to a hard pour), the color of heavily creamed coffee. The head is slow to fall, but the lacing is sudsy and slick. The body is an extraordinarily deep garnet when backlit. The nose is dominated by roast, although it seems soft and caramelly. A little citrusy hop presence seems there also. The taste is actually fairly mild - just a bit of roastiness, balanced by some definite hoppy bitterness. Pretty spicy, but not much depth. The mouth is medium, and the beer manages to be very smooth. The spiciness really makes this beer difficult to drink. Different from my impressions on-tap, but still not a good beer."
"A nice porter, another good Sierra product."
"This one pours a rich dark brown, which appears black until held up to the light. Nice creamy, 2-finger head that goes down to a nice ringwith not much lacing to comment on. Smells of coffee, dark chocolate, dark malty goodness, a bit sweet smelling...maybe chocolate covered espresso beans even. Tastes of very bitter chocolate, weak coffee, somewhat of a metallic taste to it, and finishes off lightly roasty which sticks around for a roasty aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light and airy with good carbonation. Not my favorite porter by any stretch of the imagination but not bad by any means as well."
"Very light and drinkable for a porter. Warm, smooth, and satisfying, but not filling. The flavors are a little weak, but this just adds to the drinkability. Especially considering the price and availability, this is an excellent brew."
"This is a very straight-forward, satisfying drink. Not as thick as many porters with good burnt malt flavor and a surprising crispness. Just the faintest sweetness shines through what is otherwise a nicely bitter/smokey beverage. Almost terrifyingly drinkable."
"This is a very drinkable brew -- perfect for tossing a few back on a cool fall afternoon."
"Lots of that roasty mocha quality in the flavor too. Bitter coffee finish and aftertaste. Smooth and creamy mouth. Medium bodied but an easy drinker. Above average porter."
"A solid brew by Sierra Nevada. Another example of why everyone knows this brewery by only the letters ""SN""."
"Thin offwhite head with black body with ruby-red highlights. Smells like burnt malt with some hop, but not a very strong scent. Tastes very roasty, rather sweet. Something else in there too, but I canÂ’t quite put my finger on it. Medium body. A bit more carbonation than IÂ’d like, but overall not a bad porter."
"D: Smells like a stout, drinks like a porter. I could drink a ton of these. Well, maybe not a ton. Let's say five or six. Not filling at all, and a nice ""chilly evening"" beer."
"Poured into a pint glass, dark black color with a fluffy head that leaves awesome lacing and stays the entire drink. Smell is of malty bread also some nuts and figs smell is present. Taste is BIG FAT and in your FACE, this is how I want my porter to taste, strong and to the point. taste is of some strong malt and fresh yeasty bread, awesome leaves a great after taste as well. I enjoyed drinking this brew very strong and awesome taste, not to filling for its big taste. Try one and I'm sure you will enjoy it."
"Overall, I think this porter is decent. Its not too huge and filling and I revisted this in order to see if it was something I could homebrew for those who aren't fans of our big IPAs."
"Overall, an excellent porter that I will try again when in the mood for the style."
"A nice deep brown with clear ruby highlights, no head to speak of with aggressive pour. A nice roasted barley and chocolate aroma. Taste lacks in much flavor. Roasted malts make up the bulk of it, but the body and taste feel very thin and watery. Hops are there to balance it just a bit. Mouthfeel is very light for a porter, uncomfortably thin."
"D - Highly drinkable, especially for such a dark beer. This is not to say that the beer is an any way lacking in quality."
"Overall, this porter is good. I personally like stouts much better, but it was a delight to have Sierra Nevada Porter. I will be going back to this brew in the near future."
"This is really a pretty good beer. Decanted, it looked dark enough to nearly be black. Nice tan head that didn't stick around TOO long, but with good lacing. A bit more carbonated than I expected, but in this case it wasn't a bad thing at all. I found it had some roasty and smokey flavors, and I believe I found hints of cocoa in there. A robust, affordable and delicious beer....I will most likely revisit this. I must admit to preferring stone smoked porter, though."
"Note: I probably drank this a little to cold and way too fast. This mother is really....really drinkable. Goes down almost way too easily."
"pours a deep black body with a large beige head that has good retention and leaves a good amount of lacing. Nose is of dark chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts. Tastes of roasted (slightly burnt) malt, coffee, chocolate and some hops bitterness. Medium bodied, smooth, leaves the mouth feeling a little dry. An excellent porter and a nice session brew for me."
"Pours a two finger, tan, head that retains well too a strong film. Colro is a dark leather brown with highlights of blood garnets. A little cloudiness. The aroma is a sweet cream, with some very subtle roasted, toasted malts. Tandy leather malts mix with lightly smoked but mostly roasted creams and coffees and hints of char. A nice burny feel to the palate mixed with a cream and hop finish."
"Altogether a really good porter. I'll definitely have this one again."
"A nice porter from Sierra Nevada that's really good on all points. My only complaints are that the aftertaste is a bit too ""burnt"" and it's maybe a bit thin. I definitely see myself getting this again!"
"Easily drinkable if that's the only Porter in the house."
"notes- one of my favorites of SN only the pale ale is consumed more often"
"D - fanstastic beer. one of my all time favorite beers and a great example of this style. If you have not had this beer then go out and get it now. Very delicious."
"Drinkability: Flavor complexity of a stout, drinkability of a porter. A very drinkable beer."
"M/D- The crispness of the hops makes this medium bodied beer very drinkable....I can drink alot of it if the mood is right...Moderate carbonation...definitely one one I keep going back to."
"I was a little surprised that this wasn't hoppier. I think it is well balanced as-is. If you're looking for a porter that isn't too sweet (English porter) or too hoppy (many American porters) this could fit the bill."
"Poured very dark brown with just a hint of amber. Thick, pillowy tan head that lingered until mid-glass, although very little lacing. Malt was very evident, as was chocolate, in both the aroma and flavor. Provided a good, smooth, warming finish that hinted of smoky, as well as the constant chocolate. All and all, another winner from Sierra Nevada."
"D: Classic American porter."
"Drinkability: 2-3 certainly wouldn't hurt, but the heavier body and flavor might militate against adopting this as a session beer (however, for my money, most Sierra Nevada beers are equally agreeable as session or one-off beers). The characteristic hops flourish doesn't overtake the beer, but rather develop it in an interesting ways. I'll be drinking this again soon."
"This isn't a bad porter. The stress on the roasted malts almost puts this porter into the stout category. More aroma and kettle hops would add more complexity, which this style demands. This porter is also a bit rough around the edges. Traditional porters should get most of thier bitterness from the hops and not the malts. The lingering aftertaste of roasted malts is a definite negative.On the positive side, the lighter carbonation allows for a better taste profile. This is a pretty good session beer."
"It is poured into a pint glass a dark brown to black color, opaque. A slight tan colored head forms, that disappates quickly. The scent of roasted malt, chocolate and cofee are strong, there is a slight aroma of floral hop scents in there as well. The taste has a nice malty flavor of chocolate and coffee, followed by a unexpected burst of hop bitterness at the end, though not offensive. In the moutgh it is medium bodied, the carbonation is fairly strong, a nice dry finish helps though. This is an easy to drink beer, in fact I am another as write this. This beer is a good, solid porter."
"SlÃ inte!"
"I had trouble picking up some of the smells and flavors of this beer, but overall I think it was a good porter that I think I would enjoy a session with."
"Pours a deep dark brown (almost black) with a nice creamy tan colored head. Smell is dark malt, caramel and hops and a bit of alcohol. Taste is of roasted malts and coffee that finishes very dry with hops and a burnt/smokey bitter flavor that stays in the mouth long after the sip. Without a doubt a solid porter."
"A great brew that everyone should enjoy."
"Body is black when viewed askance, but turns out to be a deep, clear ruby when held up to the light. Thick beige head. Smell is slightly charcoaly, a little bit like chocholate, plums, heavy red wine. Taste is chocolatey, a bit espresso-like, and caramel sweet. Carbonation is quite tangy, complemented by an upfront bitterness but near-total lack of hop flavor. The black malt overtones are good, I wish they would just scale the bitterness back a bit and this would be a heckuva session porter."
"Pours a nearly opaque black with a nice tan head that retains well. The aroma is roasty upfront with notes of dark chocolate, coffee and burnt bread, along with some floral hops, dark fruits and caramel. The flavor is also initially roasty with coffee and dark chocolate notes, along with some mild caramel sweetness, dark fruits (fig and plum), well toasted bread, floral and mineraly hops, and a touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium and slightly slick, and drinkability is excellent. An excellent american porter, perhaps the paradigm of the style."
"This is not my favorite porter, as Samuel Smith and Anchor come to mind as more definitive of the style and enjoyable, and beers I would drink by themselves for their smoothness and flavor. If I want a little more edge to the malts than those porters, or something to hold up to a steak, I'd probably reach for a SN Stout instead of this. But this is an excellent beer, hands down."
"A truly amazing looking beer. A huge creamy tan head that just parks itself over the deepest ruby/black body. Smell reveals chocolate, cocoa powder, and coffee with a very earthy almost gritty tone. Taste is chocolate coffee balanced with the right amount of hops in the finish. By all means this has all the ingredients to be too bitter, but it comes off as light and creamy with a good amount of warmth from the alcohol. Thankfully this does not push the sweet (Ballroom Blitz) envelope to counteract the hops/coffee. Mouthfeel is solid start to finish with some grittiness that coats the teeth which is something I really like to see in a beer. Yeah this is good, and Sierra Nevada is everywhere so dip dap."
"Drinkability is good though. LIght and refreshing, I'd just like to see something a little more kicked up in the flavor and aroma areas."
"Sierra Nevada or Anchor Steam Porter?? Can never decide which to buy when looking for a quality porter. Anchor having a little more hops. Anyway, Sierra pours a beautiful black with a slight creamy head, lacing down the glass. Extremely smooth, lots of cocoa, but not aggravating. Coffee and possibly toffee and caramel (not too much) round out the flavors. Extremely drinkable, you can make an entire session of just these porters. One of the top 2 porters out there, without a doubt!"
"Drinkability: Terrible. This beer was awful. I drained half the bottle after I couldn't stomach it anymore. Good thing I also picked up some Edmund Fitzgerald the same day. Perhaps this was a bad bottle, but I was expecting much, much more from this beer."
"I don't care for porters that often but this I love. Enough hoppines to combat the heavy malt flavor."
"A very drinkable and light porter."
"Taste is coffee, prunes, and a decent hop twang. Mouth is lush and pleasing. This would certainly make for a sessionable porter. Is there anything SN can't brew?"
"12 oz. bottle pours out a coffee, black color. No head to speak of. It left minimal lacing. It smelled very malty. You could taste the malt as well as a hint of coffee and chocolate. The beer was crisp but a little too heavy to consume many in a sitting."
"Not bad, not stellar."
"D: Overall, I am very impressed with this beer. Very rich and bold. Would be a good beer for someone wanting to try a good porter without too much ""shock"". One of my favorites."
"I hold Sierra Nevada beers as a standard against most other beers. There must be something in the water there or something. This porter holds up that tradition. It has a nice, dark color but not as much of a blackout as a stout, with a quite thin head. It's a little more course going down, as opposed to silky, but that really brings out the flavor of the dark roasted malts. The hops are what really make this beer for me though. They balance with the dark malt flavor to make you say, ""Mmm, porter."" after every sip."
"Overall - An excellent porter.... Recommended !!"
"This is quite simply an excellent porter."
"Drinkability Â– Awesome, tasty American porter. I have been back and I will be back again."
"Nice all around American West Coast porter."
"D - Although I didn't care for the first couple I had - this one is starting to grow on me."
"This stuff is like drinking water, it goes down so easy, and the after taste is heavenly. Another consistant, tasty and quality brew, by one of the finest breweries in the world...any questions?"
"Highly drinkable porter and probably my favorite SN year round. It's one of those gems that you can find even at a supermarket. Like finding a dream that don't ask no questions. Yeah."
"Overall: I think this gets much better towards the bottom of the glass. I allowed this to warm from the fridge before I poured it, but the warmer it gets the better it tastes. Some of the richness and especially the sweeter tones tend to come through better. Because it's watery, it's very drinkable."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Cheers!"
"Overall - As usual, Sierra Nevada creates a fine example of a given beer style. This is a very well-balanced and tasty porter, although nothing in particular about it stands out in my mind. Because of its wide availablity, this is the porter you'll most often find in my fridge, even if it isn't my very favorite of the style (I love you Edmund Fitzgerald). Job well done yet again S-N."
"Darn good drinking. Less heavy than some other porters I've had, which increases the drinkability factor a smidge."
"Heck of a porter here. A very sessionable and big on flavor."
"Smooth. Sort of one-dimensional, but very drinkable and tasty. Like most Sierra Nevada brews that I've tried it seems to be a good example of the particular style, very drinkable and good overall- just nothing that really sets it apart for me."
"This is a tasty porter. The hops do come through a bit on the finish, which is nice. Flavor is about what it smelled like. Another percent of alcohol would have given this better balance I feel. Sierra Nevada churns out some damn good brew."
"Overall: A good porter, recommended."
"Bottle: Poured a medium black color porter with a medium size off-white head with pretty good retention. Aroma of roasted malt with a nice touch of coffee and chocolate. Taste is a well balance mix between roasted chocolate and coffee malt with some medium bitterness at the end. Another good well balance product from this brewery."
"It's about as true-to-style as you get. It's got all of the robust roasted grains, sweet barley malt base to offset the roasted coffee bitterness. Added cocoa for flavor and hops for balance. Light fermentation sourness and a mild lactose flavor for complexity. Despite the boldness, the balance and body lightens the impact and mellows out nicely. Though no dominating characters to mention, it's unfortunate that this beer is hardlly mentioned among the conversation of great Porter. It's deserving."
"Musings: A decent Porter, somewhere in the middle of the spectrum. If it's next to the Anchor in the store, go with the Anchor."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Slick and active, the beer truly shines right here. Carbonation is lively yet refined, and drinkability is above average as a result. Great choice for an easy to find porter; I paired this with a steak dressed with gorgonzola cheese and roasted vegetables."
"My first porter and I feel a very good choice, looking forward to trying others. Count on seeing this in my fridge at all times."
"Drinkable, tasty, pretty good brew."
"I tried this beer on tap at Summits in Sandy Springs, GA. It pours into a barrel mug a deep brown color with a tan colored Â¼ Â“ head that is steady with some lacing. Not a whole lot of smell. What smell there is was a very light dry grain smell. The beer has a good flavor. It has a creamy dryness that tastes of roasted malt and unsweetened chocolate with a decent hoppy finish. The mouthfeel is medium/heavy and full. This is a good solid porter and I would buy more and drink it anytime."
"D Â– Absolutely will get this again. Great from start to finish."
"This brew pours an opaque black color. The head is one-finger in height, off-white, and recedes into thin white lacing. The aroma is of chocolate, roasted malt, and more chocolate. The taste is a perfect balance between roasted malt and chocolate. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is one of the best porters I have ever tasted."
"D - I've never been a fan of porters -- ever really. However, this solid and readily available rendition has me scratching my head, thinking, ""if this is as nice as it is, I wonder what the REALLY good porters are like."" This beer has a very easy drinkability that will leave you satisfied at the end of the evening."
"Pours deep brown/black with red-ruby highlights. Tan head fills the glass with dense, soapy bubbles, then slowly pops down to create spotty lacing. Roasted barley, black patent and molasses nose, not particularly aromatic. Sweet roasted flavor, lots of blackstrap molasses, caramel and subtle coffee. Slightly drying aftertaste, mild american hops will create a suitable balance. Medium body and low carbonation- smooth and sweet overall. Sweetness carries into the finish, but not overly residual. Acceptable session porter."
"D - The rather subdued flavor for a porter makes it very drinkable in the sense that you can easily make this a session beer. The flavor is still interesting enough to keep you coming back for more as well. A nice, drinkable porter overall."
"The flavor was that of strong toasted malt, with some coffee hintsin the background. The hops aroma and bite do a nice job rounding out this porter and balancing a solid malt body. Not a heavy bodied drink, very nice brew to enjoy in the pub. As an example on tap I was very happy to find this."
"Not that heavy of a porter. I could easily drink these all night. An excellent beer."
"Drinkability: A session of this would be fun."
"Opinion: This is one of my more favorite Porter beers from the US. Even though it clashes with what I like about the UK styles, the hops is a nicely assertive component of this beer. It has a floral charm that plays well with the dominating chocolate."
"D - Very drinkable. I guess I'm now a porter fan, lol Would buy again, and recommend to others."
"Not much to say on this one. It's certainly enjoyable, although uncomplex. Great for an intro to the porter style, if you like this, you'll probably like most porter."
"A light Porter whose flavors are subdued and more mellow than most versions of the style. Nevertheless, pleasant and enjoyable."
"Pours a deep, dark brown into a pint glass with thick khaki colored foamy head. Lacing coats the glass as the head falls slowly. Smells sweetly of chocolate, coffee with cream, heavy malt overtones, slight hop aroma present as well. Tastes fairly hoppy, exceptionally well balanced with a blend of dark roasted coffee, tingles on the tongue some. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, not unlike a stout although a lighter bodied brew. Very drinkable, well done, this is my first American Porter, and is fairly similar to a Baltic Porter, although much lighter and fizzier."
"Just a bit more than transclucent dark brown with ruby highlights. Dense beige foam, light carbonation. Complex aromas of roasty malts, coffee, chocolate, vanilla (subtle), and spicy hops. Nice roasted coffee flavor, with chocolate and vanilla notes. Toasted grains and a hop bite at the finish. Medium-bodied, smooth mouthfeel, almost silky. Nostril-stinging hop burps. Great drinkability. Easily a session porter if there ever was one."
"It's January, and 60 degrees in Buffalo! This beer pours almost black.Nice tan head. Good retention, and lacing. Smell is of roasted malts,with a hint of coco. Mouthfeel is fairly thick. Taste is roasted with a nice hop bite up front. Finish is smooth and dry. Very drinkable!"
"12-oz bottle, poured into a wide chalice glass. Dark oak color, clear if held up to light, with a tannish head of foam (nice retention & lacing). Roasted malt aroma with a tad bit of hops. Lot of roasted flavor up front, but more cocoa and caramel than the SN stout. Moderate hops with a lightly spicy/peppery flavor. Neutral yeast flavor. Finishes dry and somewhat tannic. Body is a little thin & watery."
"This tasty porter from Sierra Nevada pours very dark with a fairly small head that quickly turns to large spots. Taken to the nose , light scents of fruity hops and chocolate seem the most present. Taste begins with semisweet chocolate and turns to pleasant bitter hops , deep-roasted barley, and a trace of caramel flavor. Very nice. Medium carbonation in the mouth. The Goldings and Willamette hops , along with its 4 malts , make this a very tasty and drinkable porter. I will definatly be drinking more of these."
"Among Sierra Nevada's ""Big three"": the Pale Ale, Stout, and Porter, this is probably # 3, which is not a bad thing. It is just simply a bronze medal. Extremely flavorful, well balanced, and an excellent choice anytime. Still heads above your average porter."
"Poured this beeer into a goblet, but sniffing it out of the bottle beforehand it almost didn't make it into the glass. The sweet chocolate cheesecake smell is excellent. Once in the glass, however, the head was frothy tan and clung to the side of the glass like a true champ. This beer is very dark, light can't even be seen through the corners like you can even with a stout. The taste is very well rounded and there is no lingering of any one taste but a great balance of flavor throughout. This is the best balance of bitter and sweet that I think I have dranken to date. Have enjoyed many Sierra Nevada ales and stumbled across this porter. Hopefully the source will continue to stock, this is a new one on my list of favorites."
"So I picked me up a sixer of this. Exactly what I needed. Dark, dark brown, thin but persistent head, tastes of caramel, cocoa, coffee gorunds, and anise, with a tingly but tame hop bitterness. Reminiscent of another stellar but overlooked porter from Anchor (thought this is not quite as roasty) Could drink the whole sixer in one sitting, I do believe. I gotta drink more beers like this, yo."
"Poured a very dark brown color (almost black) with a small head of tan colored foam that dissipated into small rings around the mug. It had a faint aroma of dark chocolate, roasted malt and at sometimes, just a hint of caramel. The smell was good, but I think it needed to be just a little bit stronger. The flavor was that of strong roasted malt, dark chocolate, and some coffee notes in the background. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with a strong roasted aftertaste. Very refreshing! Overall a cheap excellent porter that would make an excellent session Porter. This was my very first Sierra Nevada product and I'm going to make sure I try more of their beers in the future. Good work Sierra Nevada!"
"Drinkability - This is a pretty nice porter, great taste and for the price I can see myself downing a few of these."
"Drinkability: Rather light for a porter; more like a hoppy brown ale"
"Very nice porter from sierra nevada. Definatley worth checking out."
"This is maybe my fifth or sixth time trying this beer. Pours a near black color with an impressive thick head and lace that sticks around throughout. Smells like mild chocolate with some faint fruit flavors. Taste is somewhat smoky with a mild hop presence that compliments the roasted character. It stays rather sweet throughout, but does leave the palate with a light sour taste towards the end. For a somehwhat heavy porter, drinkability is top notch, I could drink these all night. I have had quite a few of the Sierra Nevada beers, and this one does not disapoint. It is simply a good beer to have around when theres a lack of selection at a packy near you. Drink Up"
"overall, a great porter to fall back on. great one to enjoy. I can usually find a 6-pack for around $6, cant go wrong with that."
"Pours near black with a finger of cappucino-tinged frothy head. Nose is intensely refreshing - minty hops and grassy/grainy toasted malts with a hint of cocoa powder. Taste is crisp and well-hopped for a porter, with the floral notes balancing the roasted malts, espresso beans and cocoa. Mouthfeel is slick and crisply carbonated. This is a damn tasty, refreshing, and drinkable porter. If I wanted a session porter, this would be it. A very impressive showing from Sierra Nevada."
"OK so I drank another Edmund and it still isn't that damn good!"
"Some hints of burnt toast, but no sour ale aspect. Crisp and dry, almost makes it to a Irish stout category. Just another solid SN brew, best enjoyed in the winter by the fire. Oh, good economical American price!"
"The beer pours completely opaque with a sizeable head that hold and laces nicely. The beer smells of some good bitterness and malts with some sweetness. The taste carries the same characteristics but a charred/roasted maltiness can also be detected. The beer is not as thick as I would like from a porter but there is good carbonation. Porters are quickly becoming one of my favorite beer styles and this falls right in line"
"Very drinkable, especially in cool weather."
"I liked this as much as any beer I've had in the last few months."
"Poured slightly transparent brown with garnet edges. Very little head, but good lace and lots of carbonation for a porter. Smells of sweet dark fruits, deeply toasted coffee and chocolate malts, touches of alcohol spice and piney hops. Flavors begin with very sweet grains, building nice burnt-toast coffee malts in the middle. Medium dry and sweet finish with lingering toasted bread and prickly hop flavors. Body is slightly thick, oily and syrupy, with quite a lot of prickly carbonation for the style."
"It pours a very dark brown color topped with a crisp, flush tan head that sticks around for quite a while. The nose is a nice balance of hops with a malty backbone. I notice semi-sweet chocolate in the smell as well. The taste is of roasted malts and something that reminds me of burnt chocolate cake. Possibly dried fruits also, but on a very minimal level. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, a squeak thinner than I had expected. Nice, smooth character. The drinkability is great, I could drink it all day and all night. I believe I've yet to be let down by any sierra nevada brew. Good Stuff."
"This is a fine offering from SN. Poured out a deep mahogany color with a thin head. The smell is of roasted coffee. It has a somewhat bitter taste with a little bit of bite at the end. The mouthfeel is slightly off a bit due to the bite but it is not too bad. I could drink these all night. This is a good beer worth buying again."
"Taste: little tingle on the sides of the tongue - great mouthfeel, very, very smooth, chocolatey, coffe taste, virtually no aftrertaste, extremely bold in flavor and yet very light. My wife and I really enjoyed this one. Try It! You won't be disappointed."
"drinkability: very drinkable"
"Drinkability: Would I buy this again? If I see it on sale. Do I want another? Hell yeah. Would I seesion this? No, its not what its for. Enjoyable in moderation."
"After having several Baltic porters, I was curious about the American version of this style. This one poured nearly black with ruby highlights when held to light. Had a pretty good sized head that lasted longer than the Baltics I've reviewed. Had the typical roasty burnt and a slight coffee aroma. Taste was like the smell and I noticed this is a lighter bodied brew than a Baltic although heavier than an Irish stout. Not alot of carbonation and it finished with just a slight hint of a bite. Pretty good stuff that I'd buy again."
"Another fine offering from Sierra Nevada."
"Drinkability: Don't get me wrong here- SN makes a couple of my favorite brews, but I expected so much more from this one. Not up to their standards, in my opinion. Still a better than average brew, however SN sets the bar to high for themselves.."
"This is a good beer. Nice dark color, and same lacing like the stout. However the smell and taste are a bit milder and the mouthfeel is lighter. This increases drinkability. However this is no light beer, they certainly fill you up. For me, this is one of my favorite porters and I get this beer a few times a year regularly. This along with the stout are my favorite regular beers from Sierra. I guess everyone's had this one, right?"
"A nice dark brown color,but the heads alittle small.This smells alot like coffee,choclate and cola.There is a malty and roast aroma as well.This tastes like it smells.There is a distinct coffee flavor thats very nice.This is a pleasent surprise.I didn't think this would be so good,but I was wrong.This is as good as some of the more critically acclaimed micro porters on the market."
"overall, a great example of a wonderful style - truly a style that America does very well."
"This beer poured a nice deep brown color, with two fingers of chocolate head. It smelled of roasted malt, coffee, and caramel.. mmm! The taste is similar to the smell, caramel and coffee, a bit bitter, with some sweetness as well. Nice and creamy mouthfeel, not too much carbonation. This beer is much more drinkable than most porters, I could easily drink several in a session."
"Will definitely seek this out again. Quite a sessionable porter."
"Pours a deep, deep brown. Has some great ruby highlights when held to the light. Low aroma-mostly roasted malt with a slight sulfury tinge. Fantastic flavor-chocolate malt with a just a touch of roast in there. Very mild espresso flavor. Lingering bitter and sweet in one. Great mouthfeel. A fantastic version of an American porter. I wish more breweries were this good with their porter-a lot tend to start out good and get thin when it comes to body and drinkability. Buy some on a regular basis."
"This is my first beer review, and, for something different, I thought I'd make sure I included a food that went well with each beer I review on BA. I had this porter with some Newman's Own pineapple salsa and corn chips. The spicy-sweet salsa balanced extremely well with the chocolate-y roastiness from the porter. I'd definitely recommend this semi-gourmet quick-snack combo to others."
"This is my first beer from Sierra Nevada and I am very impressed. Keep up the great work!!"
"Near black with a brown head. Ruby when held up to the light. Some difficulty getting a head, but lacing lingered for the whole glass. Smell is moist pumpernickel bread, floral hops, grapes, toffee and caramel, and a bit of coffee. Strong woody, slightly citrusy, hopped attack followed by creamy, sweet coffee and some smoke. Bitterness became less refreshing and more astringent towards the end. Aftertaste is coffee grounds, slightly tacky. Medium weak mouthfeel, goes down fairly smooth. A nice fall beer."
"This would be a fun session beer. More than anything, I am surprised by the peppery snap."
"12 fl. oz. bottle, bought at Vinens Verden, Odense, Denmark. Very dark reddish brown colour, nearly black. Greyish brown foamy head. Very nice roasty aroma, notes of chocolate, liquorice, leather and oak. Roasty flavour with notes of strong coffee and dark bitter chocolate. Long bitter aftertaste from the roastiness and hops. Not bad at all."
"Well made all in all."
"This is a pretty good porter, but I find the balance a bit awkward with too much pine and overall a bit too thin. Do give it a try anyway."
"poured a deep brown, almost black color with modest tannish head that quickly fell to a thin ring.Smell is of coffee and chocolate but not really overly significant. Taste allow the roasted malt to come through, along with some coffe flavors but the hoppiness is a bit much. Finish is austerely dry, with the malt completely forgotten. Not something I will try again."
"A surprise winner from Sierra Nevada...recommend."
"Bought a six pack with a solid cap and this was much better. Not as good in the bottle as was on tap."
"Drinkability: This is a very tasty porter with a crisp flavor. Lively and enjoyable to drink. I'd gladly have it again."
"Not a bad porter, but not outstanding. Pours a deep deep ruby color. Big fluffy head on this beer. Aroma is slightly toasty, nutty. Flavor is slight roasty coffee up front, with a clean hop finish. Not bad, but I'd like a touch more sweetness in my porters. Mouthfeel is okay as well, but a touch thin and dry for me. Easy drinking and easy to find at most decent bars around."
"This is what I would call a good standby porter. Inexpensive, tasty, and easy to drink."
"Overall a damn fine porter that makes me wonder why I buy regular SNPA so much, this is such an amazing Porter."
"As the beer got warmer, the taste improved a little bit. It became a little less bitter. Overall, though, a good beer."
"overall: good porter. the mouthfeel and drinkability makes up for average flavor and aromas. i prefer sierra nevada's stout for a winter brew. overall, not bad at all, though."
"OVERALL COMMENTS: After all these years, Sierra Nevada has still got it. One of the best beers IÂ’ve had Â– STILL."
"Pours a light tan, five finger-head that vanishes slowly leaving a good lace. Deep amber color. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Nose is roasted coffee/chocolate. Starts with more malts than hops so some sweetness, roasted coffee flavor, finish has a hint of hops. $2.58 for a 12oz bottle from Northend Superette Manchester, NH."
"The color is dark brown with a large, light brown head. Retention is very good. The aroma is of dark malts with the smells of dark chocolate and roasted coffee. The taste has plenty of rich malt flavor with a nice roasty taste towards the middle of a sip. Flavors of sweet coffee and a little bit of chocolate are also in the mix. A light hop twang comes into play towards the finish. This is the kind of beer that I never tire of and a very good representation of one of my favorite styles. Plus, Sierra Nevada products are available almost everywhere in the US, making them a choice stand-by."
"Smooth and fulfilling. Very well balanced with a long finish. This is a favorite everyday beer of mine and an excellent American Porter."
"Drinkability is fine, this is just slightly above average for porter."
"Looks like a typical porter, black with medium-low carbonation and a tan head. Tastes and smells appropriately of roasted/burnt coffee. Mouthfeel is a little lacking, too watery. Very similar to the Chief BlackHawk, but less chocolatey and a little thinner."
"Very dark brown (almost black) with red hints. Aromas are predominently of roasted grain, nuts, and hops. Flavor wise, there is some chocolate and coffee going on, but nothing too sweet. Lots of hop bitterness, which I havenÂ’t really encountered before in a porter, but itÂ’s still nice. Above average mouthfeel. A solid, but unspectacular beer."
"D- This beer has a nice balance of hops and malt on the base of a good solid porter. This is a good beer in its style."
"As a porter fanatic, I was quite delighted to find this one."
"Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and big enough that it doesn't feel weak. Nicely done."
"Full mouthfeel that is not oily or chewy. Very drinkable, but with so much flavor I'm forced to slow down and enjoy."
"Very dark brown, nearly opaque, topped by a light brown head. Good retention and lacing. Roasted malt dominates the aroma, with quite a bit of maltiness and a burnt grainy smell. Big malty flavour as well, with bitterness being contributed from hops and dark grains. A little chocolatey, with bitterness coming to the forefront at the end. Dry finish, a little grainy with a burnt flavour and a little bit of American hop flavour. Creamy texture with moderately high carbonation and medium body. Overall, a very nice porter."
"It is fairly straightforward and not complex but a tasty brew nonetheless. A good beer to enjoy and not have to think too much about."
"Full, smooth and creamy in the mouth. Really nice on the tongue. Burnt malt, dark roast coffee and a sour twang hits before a smooth, nicely bitter finish takes over and dries the mouth. A highly quaffable, classic porter that never disappoints."
"This beer is a classic and hasn't lost a step. Superb!"
"Quite an extraordinary brew. A nice blend of malt and hops, this is a stand alone example of what a porter can be. SN has made the porter available to the common beer drinker, adding further evidence to their being a gateway to the world of fine beer."
"Sweet, full bodied brew. Low carbonation, and chocolatey flavors. Hints of coffee, nuts, and spices. Real thick and chewy. Great beer, can't say enough about it."
"Drinkability- Quality porter from a quality brewery. Good job."
"Mouthfeel is medium, easily quaffable, and very representative of the style. A far better beer that SNPA in my opinion."
"This beer is very dark but some light gets through. Nice fluffy off white head formed but faded fast. The aroma is subtle but sweet. Flavor is also suble and sweet. A hint of mocha with the malt flavor is very smooth. This is much better than I anticipated. From the Sierra line I think this is the best I've had. I would definetly recommend it. A great session beer."
"Coming from Sierra Nevada, I was expecting something hoppier, like their flagship Pale Ale. But this worked very well nonetheless. I was certainly not disappointed; in fact, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I really like this beer. Highly recommended. Don't drink it too cold, or you will likely miss some of the flavors."
"After trying their Pale Ale, I thought I would give the Porter a try. The beer poured dark amber with a one finger head and lots of nice lacing throughout the drink. The smell was mainly of coffee and earthy with some citrus hop aroma. The taste was a bit burnt tasting with nice bitterness and mouthfeel. This is not a very smooth porter like others I have tried, but it is a very drinkable brew."
"Drinkability: Oh hell yeah, this is drinkable! ThereÂ’s nothing flashy about this beer and nothing all that unique, but itÂ’s just a wonderfully balanced, well-rounded beer. I wish had more than one bottle."
"--"
"Shaker glass presentation. Nice tan 3/4"" head over the almost opaque dark brown brew, and laced well. Aroma is dark malts with a tinge of hops character. Taste is dark malts, esp chocolate, with a slight crisp, hoppy finish. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good, went down smooth and easy. Enjoyable porter."
"Pours dark brown, almost black, with edges an attractive hue of dark red. One finger head, brown, medium sized bubbles that recede in about two minutes, leaving only a small amount of lacing but with interesting patterns. Smells of smoky sweetness, carmel and toffee. Taste is more bitter than the aroma would suggest. Roasted coffee and bitter dark chocolate. Medium weight, lively carbonation. Lightly sweet on the finish with big smoke on the aftertaste, also a lingering acidic quality."
"This is a hell of a porter. Really swell. Some porters are bland, others cross over the line into the realm of stouts, SN's porter pushes it gently with savvy."
"Pours a dark brown, not completely black but close. Slight tan head doesn't stay too long (it's an ale). Very little hop aroma, consistent with a malty porter as this. Roasted barley malts are evident and well balanced. This is a good porter because it is not trying to be a full-bodied stout - thinner and less complex than a hearty stout would be. High powered at 5.6% abv. A drinkable porter, and one of the best you can get. I would recommend trying a local breweries porter first, but this is a good standby."
"Overall I'll call this an above average, easily drinkable beer."
"Mouthfeel is crisp at the start and finish. Extremely easy drinking for a porter. This remains as one of my favorite porters."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with tight carbonation and a slight creamy character...fits the style perfectly. This is another easily sessionable SN brew....pick up a sixer and just enjoy it."
"I know everyone debates the merits of Sierra Nevada (not the same, recipes have change, etc) but score another victory for this one in my book!"
"Has a silky mouthfeel. Hands down one of my favorite porters. Always easy to find, taste great, and never disappoints!"
"12 oz., bottle conditioned with no freshness date. Pours into the imperial pint glass very dark brown with red shining through at the edges and a thin 1 finger head that leaves very little lacing. Smell is sweet with chocolate, coffee, raisins, some hops, and a wine character. Flavor is the same with a hint of alcohol and pine/citric hops that eventually make themselves known. Mouthfeel is medium with a crisp carbonation. This is the first time I've had their porter, but it seems like this bottle is past its prime. This store orders large quantities and the beer stays around for years sometimes - they still have cases of Brimstone's 1998 Big Ale...."
"12 oz twist off bottle obtained from a local grocery store in Feb 2005. Pours a tan half-finger head over a dark liquid that is deep mohoganey held to the light and is almost crystal clear). Smells rich and chocolatey with some mild vienna malt character. Coffee roast is very faint and may simply be an effect created by the strong chocolate. Tastes sweet and chocolatey. Has a faint roughness on the tongue perhaps from the hops perhaps from roasted grains. Hop flavor can easily be tasted, but is well in balance with the sweet and chocolate. Medium thin mouthfeel with mild carbonation that fluffs nicely in the mouth. After the swallow, the flavors begin to subdue until chocolate re-emerges. Could use a twist of dark fruit near the end fill the gap between chocolate in the taste and chocolate in the aftertaste. Incredible lacing on the glass and the final gulp still has a thin layer of head. If I recall, this was just $5 per 6-pack...quite a deal for beer of such a high quality."
"A dark brown beer with some ruby highlights. Has a big foamy light brown head that leaves some good lace. The aroma was light with a coffee note and some chocolate in the background. The flavor starts out with a strong push of roasted malt with a coffee like bitterness in the finish."
"This one pours a dark brown color with a small head that doesn't stay long and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is comprised of a coffee and chocolate malt with a bit of hops. The flavor has a bit more hops than I would like in this style. There are coffee and chocolate flavors in there. Medium mouthfeel, could use some more thickness. Drinkability is good."
"One more step in the horizontal tasting of Sierra Nevada. This one pours a nice deep dark brown color with a finger of head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is nice and roasty, with some chocolate notes as well. The flavor is nice, with more of a coffe flavor coming through than the nose would tell me. This is a very nice beer. The feel is just a shade above moderate. I would like a little more creamyness. This is another good beer from Sierra Nevada. Smooth and easy drinking."
"Nicely done. A solid and definative beer."
"Mouthfeel is pretty much just right here as the body is medium and there's a bit of creaminess that's maybe a bit more than you'd expect from a porter but still keeps the body porter-esque. This one is a definitely an easy drinker overall and is low enough in it's ABV to make for a nice session brew."
"The taste was good, though not spectacular. It had kind of an ESB quality to it, but with a much more roasted character, even a hint of smoke in the aftertaste, but not enough to gag me like any real smoked ales I've tried. I had to do some editing to this review after quite a big session the previous night where I was in no place to write a proper review. Thus drinkability has been upped from 3.5 to 4."
"Once again, Sierra Nevada comes through with a solid offering."
"This beer poured a beautiful dark, almost black with copper edges. Maintained a thin head till the end. The initial smell was a combination of chocolate and smoke, not a bad combination. This combo carried over into the taste, with just a slight bitter bite at the end. Excellent body. Sampled at 55 degrees. Not my first SN Porter, and definately not my last."
"Taste was much the same with lots of roasted malt flavor and a smokey and dry aftertaste. A well balanced and tastefull porter."
"Wow! I've never seen a keg of this in Vermont before so I had to check it out. Nice deep dark brown complex with slight tan head. Great mouthfeel. Taste is well rounded and complex. A very decent porter. Certainly the best beer available at this bar on this night."
"Final Thought: Wow, Sierra Nevada brews a mean porter that's as good as any other one out there."
"I love the Pale Ale and Celebration Ale, so I was looking forward to trying this. The beer is very dark, almost black, with a decent size tan head. At first all I could smell was chocolate, almost like a mocha. As the beer warmed, there was a lot more fruit present in the smell, berries? It felt quite smooth in the mouth, velvety. I guess I was a little dissapointed in the taste, not that it tasted bad, I just didn't seem very interesting. A little smokey and well balanced, but I couldn't get excited about it. It's definately above average, but I actually liked the Sam Adams Holiday Porter a little better."
"This one pours like a very standard porter. Nice dark brown color with a little layer of tannish head floating around. Laces pretty nicely, especially for a porter. Doesn't smell particularly interesting but a nice roasted malt scent is present, with a tiny bit of chocolate in the nose as well. Although this is a more malty beer than the widely available Pale Ale it is still very clear that you're drinking a Sierra just by the taste. I don't know they do it, but they definately have a signature taste. Nice malty body, and very well balanced with the citrusy hops. There's definately some flavor in there, chocolate, yeastiness, but this is a pretty mellow porter. None of that over powering ""coffee"" taste. Great smooth mouthfeel with a bitter kick to it. Surely one of the more drinkable porters out there. Cheers."
"I believe I have now found one of my all-time favorite porters. Let this be a lesson to myself and others not to be so quick to write-off (or at least generalize about) a particular brewery after only trying a couple of their offerings. I look forward to trying more Sierra Nevada offerings in the future with a more open mind and palate."
"A quality brew befitting the folks from Chico."
"from the bottle. poured dark brown with a creamy light tan head. flavor,dark chocolate. malts, roasted nuts, coffee,hint of hops. flavor coffee, chocolate the bitter sweet kind, roasted malts. nice smooth mouth feel enjoyed this one very drinkable will buy this one again"
"II don't see this as something I would drink especially with the other SN brews available. If this was the only decent selection available, I would probably go with it."
"Comments - In all the years I've been drinking Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, I've always passed over their porter. No more. If you are in the mood for robust-tasting porter, I don't think you can miss with this beer!"
"Solid porter here, quite a bit better than the Rogue Mocha I had last night. Overall, definitely a must try."
"Pours a clean, very dark brown with hints of red at the fringes. A foamy, creamy head that settles down quickly but nevertheless persists. Smooth sweetness and roasted malts come through in the nose. Taste is wonderfully ""busy"" yet well integrated. Starts out with a nice, hoppy bite, followed by moderately sweet malts. Dry finish makes for a nice mouthfeel and good drinkability. This is likely to become a cool weather staple in my fridge."
"nice dark beer slight red around outskirts of glass.nice size head leaves lace down the glass. i see this beer gets a decent score on BA but i must say im unimpressed.slight coffee hints little bit of hop bite at end .i like other sierra offerings but this one strikes me as average."
"This porter is delicious. As soon as I take a sip, my taste buds are assaulted by a variety of flavor: chocolaty malt, espresso, a bitter hoppy kick to liven things up and keep it from being too sweet. There's a bitersweet aftertaste that lingers on after swallowing - the bitterness the last to leave your mouth. The mouthfeel is just right. Not too heavy, but definitely not light. The combination of flavor and body make me want to enjoy this beer in substantially sized sips. This beer is my good ol' black and blue standby when I don't want to try anything new, and I'm not exactly sure what I'm in the mood for. It's an excellent porter, and one of my favorites."
"Pours a dark and opaque deep burgundy under a big three finger tan head that settles fairly quickly, but with good contour and nice lace. The nose is very nice - roasted nut and caramel in droves. The mouth is very (too?) prickly, with medium body. We start with a good roasted nut and caramel opening, followed by a nice crips hoppy bite. A good bitter aftertaste follows the smooth malt finish. Nice complex and enjoyable brew."
" Another top notch brew from Chico."
"I haven't had this beer in quite some time because I'm weary of buying a microbrew so far from home when it is not refrigerated. (I don't live 30 min from Chico any more.) I was reminded of how great this beer is and I'm glad that it is available on the East Coast."
"Bottle. Dark beer with foamy head. Soft. Carbonated. Smooth and malty with a nice mix of caramel and cough mixture. Mild natured. Some chocolate and coffee notes as expected. A very pleasant and easy drinking bit of the dark stuff. I'll have another!"
"I enjoy this beer but I enjoy others better. I prefer a stronger taste. Still, it's too strong for any of my friends to enjoy."
"The beer pours a deep dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that is slow to recede. The aroma is good. It has a roasted malt scent that boasts of dark crystal and chocolate malts. There is also a bit of hops in there as well. The taste is great. It has an incredibly smooth, malty flavor that boasts of cystal and chocolate malts. It goes down quick and easy with a creamy chocolate finish. The mouthfeel is awesome. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very easy drinking porter. It's not the best I've had, but it ranks up there in drinkability."
"I know I have raved about this beer. If you know of a better porter out there, beer mail me and let me know."
"This beer is nearly black with ruby hues when held to light. It has a nice head and leaves some lacing. It has a lightly roasty nose. The taste has some chocolate with a hint of coffee and some roastyness. This beer is medium to full bodied. This is a great beer that I will definatly have again."
"Overall, it's rather drinkable, but I think I'd only want 2, maybe three bottles at the most, in one sitting."
"A very enjoyable brew."
"A good bitter aftertaste, with some liquorice, and with good persistence."
"Ok cant believe I havent had this one before. Served from the regular SN 12 oz bottle. Quite an attractive looking beer, brown with hints of deep red/garnet, large creamy light tan head.lots of carbonation visible. The aroma is somewaht strange IMO for a porter,very fruity,figgy,sugarysweet..strange but not unpleasant. this is quite a sweet porter compared to most of its class.Nice malt accents, though not too roasted.Unusual taste but I like it. Very nice on the palte ,finishes semi-dry with a hint of bitterness. A quite unusual porter..but good none-the -less."
"Overall, a very well balanced porter. So far it's my favorite of the Sierra Nevada line up, and is one of the better porters I've had."
"This is a plenty nice brew and quite drinkable, though if I were faced with a choice at the store I'd be more likely to go with their Stout which had a much more complex and balanced flavor."
"Not bad at all. Pours a nice jet black, but the head didnÂ’t really stick around. Smells of some roasted grains and aroma hops, but nothing overpowering. The flavor stays true to the smell- but not as good as the Sierra Nevada stout. Lighter, almost thin, mouth feel for a porter, but nice dark color. Overall, this is an easy drinking porter."
"Re-visit on Sa, 21 July 2012. My aggro pour created better than two fingers' worth of dense, light-tan head with great retention. Color was a deep brown with ruby highlights. Nose was chocolate, more towards milk than dark. Mouthfeel was medium and the roastiness was immediately evident in the mouth. I think it tasted more sweet than bitter, but it still had a distinct coffee/chocolate taste on the tongue. Finish gave the toffee flavor that the label mentioned. A very nice example of the style."
"I'm impressed with this brew. I've been a big fan of stouts but haven't truly crossed that vague line into the world of porters. The deep dark color is what first draws me in with the impressive head. Aromas of roasted malt provide a hint of what to come. A slight hint of citrus helps keep the flavor in balance. A smooth mouthfill makes this a very drinkable beer. I'll save a place for this in my fridge."
"ths porter pours a dark brown almost black with a 1"" head that falls to ring in a few minutes. lacing is thin but ample for the style . smell is of roasted malts with chocolate accents. taste is robust malts with little dark coffee and hops in the back. mouthfeel is hearty anfd thick but, quite drinkable. a terrific example of the style."
"Overall: Yet another amazingly drinkable beer from Sierra Nevada. Tastes fantastic and goes down well all night long."
"Pours out very dark brown with a nice tan head. Fair amount of lacing on the side of the glass as it went down. A nice, smooth aroma consisting of toasted, slightly nutty malts, and a lot of caramel. The taste is sweet, but mild. Medium-full bodied, with the caramel really coming through, and also more coffee flavored than the aroma suggests. Syrupy mouthfeel that goes down easy. I enjoyed this beer a lot and I think you will too. Another quality (but not amazing) brew from Sierra Nevada."
"It's a good beer, but I'd like it to be a bit fuller on the tongue and bit richer on the palette. All of the elements are here, but, IMHO, it smokes up and dries out too quickly. Great brewery, good beer."
"This is a really good, robust Porter from a great American brewery."
"This dark red/black brew pours a nice strong tan head that left a nice lacing down the side of my pint. Smells of roasted/toasted coffee like malts. I had this paired with a Mexican dish and was amazed at how strong the chocolate in this brew stood out at the finish. The mouthfeel is a little thinner than some of the other porters I have had. Overall drinkability is good, even on those sultry summer desert evenings!"
"Notes: Letting this one warm up considerably really brought the flavors out. Ranks slightly behind GLBC's ""EdFip"" in my porter book."
"d"
"This is a beautiful dark brown beer with reddish tones, topped with a creamy, sticky foam. The aroma is full of roast malts. ItÂ’s smoky and coffee-like, with a grainy smell underneath. The smell is almost perfect, but I occasionally sense a faint and fleeting cheesiness. Taste is roasty and bitter, like baking chocolate and espresso. ItÂ’s full and thick, complex and chewy. Extremely drinkable. IÂ’ve had this beer a number of times, but not recently. Shame on me for not picking it up in the past few yearsÂ…itÂ’s terrific and widely available."
"the appearance is awsome. a very dark ruby copper if you hold it up to the light. otherwise it just appears black. the head on this is great. a thick foamy tan with lots of huge pits. taste is roasty and umm..roasty. an excellent beer for the winter months. or one or two on a cool summer evening."
"Notes: This brew is good on it's own, but would be excellent if paired well with a food or desert."
"12 ounce bottle, pours dark honey brown, with a tan head. Malty nose, yeasty bread aromas. Notes of honey, dark roasty malts, coffee, toffee, caramel. Creamy,smooth mouthfeel. Lovely stuff, great quaffer. Easy to match this one with everything from salads, to meats to desert. Yum."
"Pours deep dark chocolate color with a rosy tint around the edges. Faint but sweet aroma. Very little head with traces of belgian lace circle the glass. Smooth coffee taste finishes strong to the end. Overall, a good Porter. Will buy again. Sierra comes through again."
"Overall- a very nice porter that is great for a rainy day!"
"Sampled 1/16/04"
"Nearly opaque ruby with a beige head and sticky lacing quickly settling to pure liquid. Chocolate in the aroma, slight hop as well. Light bodied with medium, prickly carbonation, taste mirroring the aroma -- chocolate, with bitterness developing as it goes down, into a clean finish. Smooth and drinkable. Not adventurous, but a great example of the style, by the book. Can make a great session."
"A dark brown color with amber highlights in the bottom of the pint where light is able to penetrate. With a nice, thick, creamy, off-white head, this is how a porter is supposed to look. The aroma is subtle with a malty background and chocolate hints throughout. The taste, in my opinion, is that of the quintessential porter. Very smooth and easy to drink, the malty taste slides over your tongue. Softly sweet with slight hints of chocolate in the background. The aftertaste has a coffee element to it, overridden by the soft malt. This beer is close to a perfect example of the style. That said, it is not very complex. A straight-up porter. I'd say the edge goes to Anchor's Porter, due to its complexity, but this is still a wonderful session porter to be drunk in the company of good friends. The mouthfeel is a bit on the light side, but maybe that contributes to its overwhelming drinkability."
"Pours dark, dark. Translusent black with some redness. Offwhite, thin head settles out within minutes. Smells extremely hoppy with strong roasted maltiness. I detected some slight citris acidity there as well. The taste follows the aroma, hoppy and more bitter than most session porters (hop lovers gotta appreciate Sierra Nevada's heavy hop use), but this is well soothed by the strong malt character. The finish is clean and crisp and the smoothness invites another sip. This one is so full and satisfying I salivate heavily after each sip!? It's great - one of my standby favorites."
"This is a VERY drinkable beer. This is a complex beer where the hops are present but singing backup instead of lead. I plan on having a few bottles of this beer always in my frig."
"Taste - Milky caramels and malts mixed with dark fruits. The result is a very warm welcome. This is the kind of flavor that you'd want to serve someone who just walked 45 minutes in the snow to visit you...after they thawed, of course."
"Mouthfeel is very nice, and this baby is very easy to drink!"
"Another lovely, hop hoppin' brew from Sierra Nevada."
"great sessionability."
"the roastiness is nice, but the grape flavor a little bit boring to me, and there isn't much else. I would always rather have one of SN's other offerings, although this is not unpleasant to drink by any means."
"Looks almost pitch black, but when held to a light, it is revealed to be an extremely dark brown. A creamy tan head on top. Immedietly smells like fresh ground coffee and a hint of chocolate. Taste is of good roasted malts and an odd acid flavor. Not a bad beer, just that odd acidic twang that doesn't sit well with me."
"Not my favorite porter, but very enjoyable."
"I'll have to say I like this beer alot, especially as it introduces me to the style. Although it should be obvious I'd enjoy this beer better as a dessert or night cap than something to session with."
"The taste is rich in all sorts of roasted flavors including toasted dark breads, bittersweet dry chocolates and a hint of burnt smokiness. This is a medium bodied beer thatÂ’s creamy and smooth with a perfect finish. Nothing harsh or astringent in this beer, itÂ’s just full of richness and soft flavors that excite ones palate."
"A very drinkable brew. I would love to have this over and over again."
"Good sized head, nice tan color. Beer has a very nice dark brown color, very appetizing. Strong coffee odor, with some chocolate and possibly something citrus? Long lasting head. Moderate to heavy mouthfeel with a nice roasted coffee flavor as well as roasted chocolate. Balanced very well, the hops keep the flavor crisp. Definitely a porter worth buying again."
"Pours a extremely dark brown with a thick tan head. Leaves a nice lacing pattern. Smells of chocolate and caramel infiltrate the nose and a bit of hops. Tastes of burnt malts and a earthy chocolate flavor. Medium body with a nice creamy feel. Hints of spicy hops and a sweet coffee note. Finishes with a great blend of chocolate and caramel. This is a outstanding porter and really a solid brew. My only regret is that I didn't try this one earlier."
"Sierra Nevadda Porter is an above average porter. The apperance pours a very dark with a coffee froth head. Smell is very mocha with roasted malts. Perfect blend of caramel with the chocolate for a great smell. The taste is good, the dark roasted taste is very present, not to strong but just right, not as flavorful as some porters but very good for a dessert after dinner. Feels full and sweet in the mouth. A drinkable porter but for me I can't drink more than 3 of these before feeling full. Above average at 5.49 a six pack, not bad at all."
"this is some awsome stuff..ive been drinking a glass of it with every meal since ive had the 6pack. this is now one of my favorite beers that you can get almost anywhere...not too bad at 6.99 a six pack either."
"There are many porters that pair nicely with steak and potatoes. Not this one. Seirra Nevada would be paired great with cheesecake."
"Drinkable, but I can find better."
"Overall Impression: Standard disclaimer: Not a porter fan. Given that, this is a good beer. Mild tap at appearance; itâ€™s brown, not black, but otherwise, a good-looking beer. Flavor has enough porter characteristics to be within style, but seems sweeter and smokier than Iâ€™m used to. Mouthfeel is a hair off perfect with the touch of oiliness, but being a bit nit picky. Drinkability? Iâ€™d drink another, which is high praise from a non-porter drinker. Iâ€™m unable to not like this beer! Recommended."
"This is another great example of a style by Sierra Nevada. How do they produce so much beer while still consistently reaching such a high level of quality? I dunno, but I like it."
"Drinkability is very good, definitely sessionable."
"Chewy mouthfeel but a bit thin in the body and almost too much carbonation. Great drinkability, perhaps a session Porter?"
"Pours a dark brown with a nice tan head that clings to the glass all the way down, nice lacing. Nice roasted malt smell. Tastes of wonderful roasted malt , hints of coffee, with nice hop bite and dry tasty finish. This is a great medium bodied porter that is extremely drinkable."
"Sierra Nevada Porter is a solid drinker with an interesting and delicious flavor profile. I'm glad that it's so readily available because I could easily make it my regular porter."
"A fine reasonably priced porter."
"I am rather partial to porters and stouts, and I was expecting this one to be only slightly above average. Turns out that this is one of my favorites now. Soooo very drinkable. I would pair this with one of my favorite foods: steak (preferably a nice t-bone, porterhouse, you get the idea). Perhaps I would even be as daring as to use this as a marinade for some red meat. All in all, this is definitely a grade A beer from Sierra Nevada."
"Pours a nice, thick ruby-orange color with a good thick tan head that sticks around to the bottom. Smell is of semi-sweet chocolate and bitter hops. The taste is like a typical porter, but hoppier (much to my satisfaction). Notes of caramel and lime linger in the finish. Feels great in the mouth, and goes down great on a cold day. A fine, very drinkable beer. A classic American Porter."
"Not a bad beer, but definitely has that Sierra Nevada house flavor. There's something about the yeast possibly, but I think it has to do a with the hops. Definitely a hoppy porter. In fact, it's the first thing I noticed about the beer, but they fade into the background as you drink the beer and you start picking up the unsweetened chocolate notes. Very clean and drinkable porter."
"This is an extremely dark porter. It has a nice tan head with good retention. I smell malts and espresso and chocolate. The taste is quite good but not as strong as the scent. The mouthfeel is smooth and thinner than expected. This is a decent brew, very drinkable. I could easily down several of these is a single sitting."
"12/30/03: Updating my earlier review. This is a very good porter. It really has a wonderful roasted malt flavor and is very easy to drink. Pours out to the beautiful darkness of the style. A very easy to drink beer that could make for a session porter if you so desired. A good option to give to someone who is interested in trying a porter."
"Pours a dark Coca Cola brown with ruby tinting. Small beige head dissipates quickly into sheet lacing. Big malt nose of caramel and dark roast coffee. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated. Taste is much like the nose, but more complex with notes of nuttiness and currants. Bitterness balances out any threat of sweetness. Hops are just slightly noticeable. Finish is dry and somewhat bitter. This is a very drinkable Porter, and not a bad effort by a brewery that I associate with a big western hoppiness."
"Creamy-full feel. Very good at room temperature"
"Sampled in a blind tasting alongside Anchor Porter (which edged this beer out by a mere 0.05 of a point)."
"Tastes very chocolatey, with a little coffee, cocoa, expresso and some dark grapes. Pretty Tasty!"
"Pours a deep brown almost black with a nutty, thick head that dissipates very slowly. Smells of malts, nuts and chocolate coffee. Tastes of roasted nuts and more chocolate with the right amount of dry hops finish. Nice and mildly thick with slight dryness upon swallowing. I can consume many of these in one sitting. A very nice porter, nice one indeed."
"Overall, I enjoy this and all SN products, but I'd have to say that this is probably my least favorite of the regular line. It is an amazingly drinkable porter, but nothing is there that keeps me coming back. The stout is just so much better, but altogether a very passable beer - one i'd go for before most any other ""regular"" beer available."
"I'm suprised I've waited so long to try this. I agree with another review in that I like this better than their stout. Close to Anchor, IMO. Nice, roasted malt flavor, Good balance and taste, Pours with a nice, foamy head, good retention. Not too thin or bitter. Not in the class of Fuller's or Ocokim, but as good as most other porters I've tried. This brewery can always be counted on for a quality product."
"I like SN's porter more than their stout. Dark, cola-brown with a dense tan head. Smells of creamy chocolate malts, molasses, and some roasted bitterness. Taste is a hefty amount of smooth dark chocolate, followed by increasing SN bitter roastiness. Nice creamy mouthfeel. Very drinkable for the style."
"Enjoyable. Lower overall bitterness adds to smoothness."
"All around not bad at all. Good flavor even if it is a little thin. Would definately drink again, but if I'm buyin', I'm getting Bully! Porter. Cheaper and better, it's a winning combonation. However, if I see this on sale and it's cheaper, I'd buy it."
"Pours a deep brown black with a ruby tinge to it. A beautiful bubbly head, with tan at the top and darker at the bottom. Nose is roasted malt up front with coffee/chocolate notes and a balanced hop essence. Smooth, rich and full bodied, malty with a nice hop bite at the end, finishing slightly sweet. Absolutely a drinkable beer, and with winter coming, one I plan on drinking more often."
"Poured a deep, dark brown color - almost black but not quite. Head was a good size, tan colored, and sticky with medium-high retention. Aroma was mostly of coffee notes and roasted malts with a sweet chocolate quality to it. Taste also had the same coffe characteristics with mellow cocoa and roasted flavors, finishing with a very balanced, slight hop bitterness and a nutty aftertaste. Mouthfeel was smooth, heavy bodied, and fully coated the mouth, and carbonation was relatively low. Overall this is a well balanced easy drinking porter that I personally rank towards the top."
"SN Porter has always been an old standby - perfect for a fall day when the weather begins to cool off. The strong hop component makes for an interesting twist. Easy to knock back a few of these without feeling overwhelmed. A great after dinner drink."
"The smell was not what I was expecting at all: it had more of a hoppy smell than your average porter and a nice toasted malt aroma as well. The taste was very smoothe with a dominated hop flavor as well as some slight coffee and malty flavors. This one's extremly drinkable, so watch out!"
"Thin and easy to drink, a quality brew that needs more porter to its taste. Regardless, another fine SN product."
"A very nice porter, pours out to a deep brown/mahagony wit a tan head which has a bit of staying power. Roasted malts are everywhere in this one, chocolate, vanilla, and a touch of coffee. Suprisingly enough though the taste does have a big hop prescence which makes this beer one of the more complex porters out there. Very nice porter, i would highly reccomend it."
"Some sweet chocolatey malts, some burntness and some vanilla. Nice soft, citrusy hoppy finish. Leans towards the hops more than the malts, kind like drinking a dark IPA or something. Smooth mouthfeel. Quite enjoyable and easy to drink. Tasty (Bottle- GBBF 03')"
"Dark black color, medium head. Aroma is roasted malt. A medium bodied porter. Malts are sort of middle of the range. More chocolate than coffee. This beer is also a little hoppier than most porters. Smooth taste. Nice drinkable porter. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Overall good but not one of my top favs"
"A very good porter. One of those beers that everyone needs to have a constant supply of in their fridge."
"Pours with a light brown head. The beer itself is a deep brown / black color, when held up to the light it is clear with brown notes to it. Smells of roast malt and coffee, definitely very malty-roast aromas as well. Tastes of smooth roast malt mixed with solid Willamette hop flavor that finishes the beer off. The hop flavor has always impressed me with this beer. There is a bit of coffee in the taste as well."
"All was good but the taste and drinkability, which matter the most to me. The bad thing about the taste is that you gotta be in the mood to drink it. If it's early in the morning, not good. Later in the evening, good. The apperance was top quality though. The darkness of the beer, along with the thick head, made for a good sight. I got a 6 of it $5, so I'm not complaining too much."
"-Cheers"
"This beer has dark ruby to dark brown appearance and a lightly spicy hop aroma. This is a medium-bodied porter that, like most porters I like, seems have an emphasis on chocolate malt. There's a good balance between the malt and hops with the beer finishing dry. I like the lightly roasted malt flavors that are mixed the more chocolate-like flavors of this beer. Just the right amount of bitterness helps make this porter tasty, but I think I prefer the heftier stout."
"real dark brown with only the slightest hint of ruby when in the light. quickly dissapating thick tan head. mild and nutty smell, a little chocolatey. rich roasted chocolate malt taste. a little fruity as well. thicker side of medium mouthfeel, nice and smooth. overall a real nice porter, perfect for sipping on a cold day, haven't been disappointed by sierra nevada yet."
"Medium body with mild carbonation. Very refreshing and very drinkable. A nice porter all around."
"This was just a good beer, plain and simple. Nothing extraordinary hit me about this one but it was a very good drink. I wouldn't mind drinking this one often. Mix of hops and roasted malts went well here. Went down really easily. Another fine beer from Sierra Nevada."
"Comments - I tasted this alongside the SN stout for comparison purposes. I thought this one was a little more complex, and I enjoyed the various flavors that I experienced along the way. The stout is amazing, though, and I would recommend both."
"ng"
"A medium body. Not heavy at all. Easy drinker but better to sip slowly. This porter will change on you as it warms just like a good bottle of red wine changes characteristics after it has been opened. When I drink this porter I wish we had cold winters in Santa Monica."
"Nice black color with a very nice head that dissipates nicely with a beatiful lacy finish. Coffee aromas invite you to taste more, and the coffee-like flavors tantilize the taste buds, remaining well rounded throughout. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and reminds you to sip this nicely fromed brew. Drinakbility is good, if you're in a sippimg mood."
"This is a pretty well-balanced porter. Bitter, old-coffee taste sat well with me (maybe from my days drinking USMC coffee!). Reasonable %ABV a plus also. Nothing spectacular but not a beer I'd steer away from in the future."
"Poured a dark brown/black that was barely opaque with a light brown head. Roasted malt quickly gave way to assertive hops in the aroma. The first few sips of this beer were all about spicy hops and then a little chocolate and roasted malt came through. Surprisingly found it to be not nearly malty enough, especially considering I have been on a porter binge lately. Overall, flavor and aroma focused way too much on the hops. Mouthfeel was a little light, but still to style. Had to take of points for drinkability due to hop assertiveness."
"This Porter had a medium tan head with fine-small sized bubbles. The body is a dark brown color. It has a chocolate flavor to it. The coffee flavor is not too strong which is to my liking. This is a smooth Porter, but it seemed to be lacking something."
"Fruit factor comes in more in the middle, toward the end. A solid porter. No frills, but no bones about it, they made a nice one."
"12 oz bottle. Poured a dark brown, with a moderate chocolate head, and some signs of lacing on the glass. Aroma of roasted malt with a hint of chocolate. Taste was malty and hoppy but seemed thin and lacking in body. A fairly good porter, but there are alot better out there."
"Notes: Not tasty enough to rank with the elite porters (e.g. Stone's 6th Anniversary Porter, Heavyweight's Perkuno's Hammer Imperial Porter), but a thoroughly enjoyable -- and drinkable -- session brew nonetheless. Drink it."
"Pours a nice deep brown with some red highlights witha nice creamy tan head.The aroma was chocolaty and a little nuttyThis porter has definant hoppiness in the finish thats for sure,but it has the roasted nutty malt character to begin with.A pretty good balanced porter,maybe one of the hoppiest I have had and I really liked it.."
"Frothy tam head which subsides quickly. Beautiful deep brown with a clarity that appears when the beer is held to the light. IMO the color of this beer is perfect but the head retention needs a lot of work. The smell was chocolaty but very faint. I really like the taste of this porter as it is sweet, chocolatey , with roasty hints of malt. The hoppiness seems to be perfect too but i thought Sierra Nevada was notorious for super hoppy beers while this one was toned down. Nevertheless i detected a lot of noble hops with their mild floral flavors balancing the strong malt background. The mouthfeel was a little light and i think that making the beer a little heavier would also help the head retention. I would definetly drink this again but not before i try a lot more brands of porter to make sure this is the best."
"-F"
"Although I love the taste of a good porter, and consider this to be quite good, I can't envision this as something I'd have several of."
"This brew poured a small head of light brown finely sized bubbles and a opaque brown body. It has anice sweet malt aroma of medium strength. It has a strong coffee flavor that finished a tad bitter. Over-all, it a smooth beer with a good wake me up flavor."
"Big off-white head on a luxuriously dark red body. Dark roasted chipotle, barley aroma. Light bitterness on a slightly burnt dark bread flavor. Light bodied beer. This is a delicate dark beer, if that is possible, and it goes down quickly. I was underwhelmed by the totality of this though."
"This porter pours a deep black. The head is tan in color and decent size, it did give way to a nice sized lace. The aroma is a bit earthy and has roasted malt and coffee hints in there. The taste is mild roasted malt with hints of hops in the finish. This is a nice and smooth, enjoyable porter to drink."
"Color is a nice deep, dark brown with dark ruby highlights, the head is very tannish, light brown and creamy, about an inch high and holds together like vaniila ice cream in a root beer float, amazing divets and lumpyness! Smell is pretty mild and mellow of roasted malt, a bit sweet and lightly chocolatey tanged. Not much flavor to speak of, a tad to tame, but still heavy enough for good drinkin'. Feels medium body and smooth with a sweet nearly bitter tang thats easy to handle. Its a porter worth drinking but not seeking."
"Pours a very dark brown that allows very little light to get through. Thick tan head fades quickly to the edges of the glass and stays wih the beer all the way down. The aroma is very earthy, very roasted malt with a hint of hops. The taste explodes on the tip of the tongue with the roasted malts, giving way to a balancing hop character, and then fading to a smooth roasted aftertaste. Very tasty brew. Mine seemed slightly undercarbonated - bad handling, or not aged enough. I'll age a few of the 6-pack for a month or two to see how it develops."
"I had this brew in a 12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. The color was black as night, almost no light would show through. There was about 2 fingers of a light tan head. The initial smell is a slight coffee aroma. The taste is a smoky coffee/caramel flavor, which is just slightly bitter on the back of the tounge. The mouthfeel is good and heavy. After a few minutes, the head dies down, but leaves a slight foam, and there is a good amount of lacing left on the glass. I think this is a good finishing brew."
"A nice, big, dark beer with a good head, healthy looking (much like myself). A slight hint of caramel and coffee to the barley malt aroma. I detected a nutty flavor initially, which kinda surprised me. The nuttiness succumbed to a more earthy, roasted flavor. Further into the brew, I even felt a touch of smokiness. For a porter, this beer doesn't feel like a porter in the mouth, smooth in character and thin. Another fine product from Sierra Nevada."
"A nice dark beer. Almost cant see through it, but held to the light it will shine through slightly. Med sized brown head, some lacing on the glass. Tastes pretty darn good, lots of coffee taste and smell with this beer. Nice tasting hops as always with the sierra nevadas, if you want a nice porter this is not a bad pick"
"Poured an above average head that reduced to almost nothing.Left two circular rings of lace down the glass before it finished.The Color was a dark red almost black but not quite.Aroma was very hoppy as was the taste.Hints of alcohol in the beginning but are well hidden later.A very crisp mouthfeel and highly drinkable.I found myself drinking this with no problem.An extremely smooth porter.Big malt taste with a bit of smoke and coffee.Left an almost refreshing mouthfeel That wasnt dry at all.Very hoppy taste and aroma but left almost no bitterness in the after taste.I find myself wanting another of these already and I havent finished it yet.Left alot of yeast at the bottom of my glass.In a class of its own as far as porters.Overall very good."
"Decent Porter, poured a nice brownish color. Was sweet, with hints of caramel. Not heavy bodied, and not ""watery", just some where in between. Carbonation was good. Mellow is the word that comes to mind when thinking about this beer. A definite ""session"" beer."
"Dark brown, served with a moderate tan head that showed excellent retention. Fruity malt aroma with a decent dose of hops. Roasted notes in the taste are well balanced with some nice chocolate. Decent bitterness on the finish helps balance out the flavor profile and begs you to take another sip. There is a moderate level of sweetness that is revealed as you continue to drink this beer, but again it is all about balanced flavors. The mouthfeel is solid, as it caresses the tongue like fine silk. There is a nice roasted malt aftertatse theat lingers, but doesn't opress. A very dinkable and enjoyable beer from Sierra Nevada."
"Poured a very dark brown in color with auburn highlights. Creamy khaki colored head. Aroma consisted of chocolate malt and some feint caramel sweetness. Full-bodied mouthfeel. Roasted malt flavor dominates the front. The hop bitterness makes no secret of itself in the finish, which take some getting used to and leans toward the dry side. Depending on your preference for hops, I can see where this might be a porter that you would either like or dislike. Overall not bad."
"Overall a good porter that's well crafted."
"Pours a dark brown/ruby color with a tan, medium sized rocky head. The froth fades away slowly, leaving a sticky lace splattered on the glass. The aroma is rich with roasted malts and chocolate. Taste is full of roasted malts and coffee, with slightly nutty undertones. This is an extremely smooth and easy drinking beer. I highly recommend to anyone if you can get your hands on it."
"This is a well rounded taste. A welcomed attack on all fronts of the tongue. A nice sweetness, an opposed bitterness. The two meet somewhere in the middle and the results are very drinkable."
"This brew poured solid black with light barely making it in around the edges. A rocky tan head that was about two fingers for most of the brew. Good amount of lacing as well. The aroma is of roasted malts and chocolate, with maybe a little bit of hops making its way in there. The taste is similiar to the aroma with roasted malt jumping out at the start. Unsweetened chocolate comes next, and what would a SN beer be without the hops. They are not real prevalent but don't go unnoticed either. Makes for a good balance. The mouthfeel is medium to full with a nice smooth finish. I could quaff many of these in one sitting. Another good solid brew from SN."
"Nice porter, this could be a decent session beer for me."
"This beer is very dark in color with a moderately tan head that is longer lasting than the stout. This one also has a very weak nearly non-existent nose. This has a very complex and smoky flavor that is hoppy and balanced with a very good malt. This is an excellent beer."
"Dark black in color, nice lasting creamy off white head, roasty chocolaty malty aroma. Roasted malty burnt coffee flavors, nice dry burnt and hoppy bitterness in the finish. Medium body with a full creamy mouthfeel, the hops really stand out in the end, this is great hoppy porter, one of my favorites."
"Crystal clear ruby-brown with a decent light tan head atop medium-large bubbles...carbonation is moderate-strong. Lacing is sparse. Aroma, though weak, has notes of light coffee, semisweet chocolate, vanilla, a fruity fermentation, mild hops and roasted grains. Mouthfeel is bright and spritzy, exploding upon the tongue (over-carbonated for a porter, IMO) with a light to medium body. Taste starts out with stale coffee, some crisp, fruity hops, toffee, a roasted middle redolent with roasted barley, and finishing in a thin, coffee/round hop bitterness with some distant huskiness and smoke. Forms a skin on the back of the tongue. Not a great porter, but a good porter in many aspects. Lacks complexity and character in my book...despite this, it's an easy beer to drink, though not one I would really feel the urge to drink much of."
"Very dark brown, pretty much opaque. The head was huge for a while and then said bye bye with lace all the way down. Chocolate and coffee dominate the flavor and then hop bitterness hits on the crisp finish. Very drinkable although a little thin for my preferences of porter. I really enjoy this beer though. It's a good porter for me to drink when I want something a little less rich then Fuller's London Porter."
"This was a really good porter, one that I will definitely buy again. It poured a pitch dark with a very light tan head that to some milky bubbles. The smell was sharp with great roasted coffee flavors. The taste was thick and hearty with a complex malted flavor full of coffee, toffee and other earthy flavors. This was an excellent porter with a very flavorful body that left a warm crisp hop taste in my mouth. Enjoy!"
"Appearance: Pours a rich dark brown color. The head is a tan color, creamy, and good retention. On the nose there is the aroma of earthy malts. On the palate, the taste consisted of dark chocolate flavors, malt sweetness, roasted/burnt malts, hint of dry hop bitterness rounds out the flavor well. Medium body and mouthfeel is fairly smooth. Overall a very enjoyable porterÂ…"
"Taste: Chocolate, bitter coffee, and heavily roasted malts dominated the flavor of this brew. It thinned out into a dry bitterness that didn't linger, it just went away. That's the thing I noticed most about this beer; very dry and not much of a finish. It was good, but kind of weak for the style."
"It pours dark brown with a slight trace of red. The head is fairly aggressive but dimishes quickly, leaving a thin layer around the edge of the glass. The smell is not very strong with coffee being the most noticeable aroma, backed by roasted malt and a hint of chocolate. In addition to the coffee, roasted malt, and chocolate, fruit sweetness is just barely detectable in the taste. A nice hop kick rounds things out well. The mouthfeel is slightly light for a porter, but it doesn't detract much from the overall experience."
"A deep ruby brown almost black in color, this beer pours a decent sized cream colored quickly disipating head. In the aroma I am getiting hints of dark malts and a subtle floral hop aroma. That is different, with the first taste on the tongue the hops come to the forefront of the flavor followed by a crashing mass of sweetness surrounded by the nice smooth almost burnt dark and choclate roasts entwined with a nice alcoholic finish to create quite the innovative porter."
"A hoppy, spritzy porter from a brewery that can do no wrong. (Fortunately, one of many.) Their stout is fantastic and this porter almost as good. Dark dark brown with huge fluffy head, grassy aroma with slight mustiness. Big coffee element, smaller chocolate flavor, roastiness and breadiness all pushed aside by very grassy hops that do not bitter the beer so much as give it a green juicy twang. A dry finish with slight reverberations of dark roasty malts. My tongue is deceived and can't grasp the full hoppiness, but the back of my throat definitely senses it. Not a ton of coffee, just grassy enough to make this a very green vegetable-like beer. Spritziness detracts slightly from the style but reminds you of SN's worthwhile bottle-conditioning strategy, and keeps this beer very much alive. I would rank this just under Anchor for West Coast porters (that I have been fortunate enough to try)."
"This beer poured a dark brown with a slight reddish tinge. It appeared to be not as thick as other porters, and tasting later on proved this to be true. A darker than average tan head grew and stayed for quite a while. Tasting proved the earlier assumption of a lager consistency and also was slightly on the bitter side. The smell was one of dark roasting with a hint of coffee lurking in the background. It was smooth in the mouth, went down easily tempting you to take the next drink. This is a beer I look forward to drinking again and would, and will, gladly serve to my family and friends."
"Drinkability: Pretty good...like I said, I'm not used to such an aggressive hop flavor and bitterness with this style, but it's very well done here."
"Pours a deep brown with a nice tannish/white head, a nice porter with some hoppiness thrown in. I have always enjoyed SN""s products, and this is an unsung hero. Porters are a personal favorite of mine and I think this is a very solid porter, which is readily available."
"Looked forward to this after sampling their stout. And I wasn't disappointed. Very dark brown in color, with a finger-thick creamy, slightly dark tan head. Great lace -- when you're done drinking you can go back and measure the size of your sips from its spacing down the glass. Coffee-like aroma to which my nose became accustomed rather fast, making it hard to smell much at all 1/4 of the way down the glass. The flavor is terrific, and it's all about the bitter. Starts off with a nice hop flavor, which gives way to a deep malty body and a wonderful finish composed of the combination of bitterness from the hops and grains. Aftertaste is slightly burnt-tasting. Much like their stout in its flavor profile, with a creamy body that's a bit less heavy, and a taste which is slightly less grainy/barley like. Very nice winter beer."
"Pours dark brown with a persistant tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, floral and citrus. Flavor begins with some malt sweetness, a touch of chocolate and carmel, and finishes with some citrus bitterness... extrememly well balanced. Somewhat high carbonation for a porter (although I don't find this to be a bad thing,) with a medium body. Very easy drinking. An excellent west-coast interpretation of the porter style."
"Pours a dark brown, almost black color with a foamy and sticky cream colored head. Malt and grains dominate the aroma with notes of a hop bitterness. The taste is of roasted malts, bitter chocolate, and dark coffee with a nice bitter flavor in the aftertaste. This was my first time to sample this particular porter, and I must say that it is one of the best I have tried."
"Flavor is quite bitter up front with a lot of citrus hop and some bittersweet dark chocolate flavors that fade into a maltier sweetness, then the hops and dark roast are all that is left on a lasting finish with a citrus burnt coffee aftertaste. Fairly smooth with a medium body and quite drinkable."
"Pours a deep dark brown to black, the way I like to see beer. The head is expansive, the lace in light chocolate sheets coating the glass. Nice roasted grains, caramel, slightly hop floral nose, sweet and quite sniffable. Front is malt sweet, top is moderate in mouth feel, the finish is strikingly hopped, and slenderly acidic, pleasantly dry aftertaste. A quite fine porter in its own right, a favorite from this most prestigious brewery, and well worth your time and money to sample."
"Very dark brown in color- opaque - with a thin, creamy tan head that holds quite well and leaves some very nice lace.The aroma is of a toasted cereal and lightly caramel malt that's ever so lightly backed by earthy and floral hops. The body is medium with a very fine and gentle carbonation that gives it an impressive smoothness in the mouth. The flavor starts lightly sharp with some roasted notes, followed by some bittersweet chocolate and grainy sweetness as it crosses the palate. It finishes with a lingering, acridic/burnt roasted note and some minimal earthy hop flavor that becomes somewhat astringent. Solidly bitter, but still well balanced."
"""Aromas of water, seeds and char. Neutral attack. Slightly sour, slightly bitter, slightly sweet. Now it smells like laundry sheets. Musty, dander-filled blankets of cottony cola and sassafras flavors. Made on the cheap or consciously in a watery=marketable mindset. Wrong."""
"On the usual scale, the more robust the beer, the more I like it. However, I liked Sierra Nevada's Stout more than the Porter. It didn't seem to have the body the Stout enjoys. Dark brown color and thick sea-foam head. Very subtle roasted aroma. Sweet malty, nutty flavor. Very good, but not the best of the SR line in my estimation."
"Taste: less complex than the nose. medium-bodied mouthfeel, signature SN hoppy bitterness dominates, a bit more subdued than their other brews but strong for the style. Roasted malt is in the background, but not by too much. Citrus wang comes in on the finish...due, no doubt, to the use of Pacific Northwest hops."
"Presentation: Packaged in a short twelve ounce brown glass bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Deep opaque brown, a little light transmits at the bottom of the pint glass.  Big and pretty rocky tan head, lots of bubble sizes.  Slight chocolate milk aromas.  Good body, bittersweet chocolate flavors with a nice roast (slight coffee oils) and a gravelly hoppiness to the back.  Nice beer, one of the better Sierra's to me.  Some similarities to Anchor Porter, a deeper American style hop but retaining pleasant chocolate impressions.  Very drinkable."
"Dark brown coffee color.  Large light tan head that doesn't die fast at all, and leaves quite a lace.  Aroma of roasted grain first, then malty sweetness and some hop aroma.  An odd balance of fruity hop and roasted grain on the palate.  Surprisingly, alcohol warms and is noticeable in the mouthfeel, even though this brew is only 5.6% ABV.  Smooth, dry, ""roasted"" finish.  I was surprised by the hop character in this one, just a bit more than I would expect from a porter.  Very smooth and refreshing, but at the same time, it would be a great warmer for a cold winter day."
"Color is a dark ruby-brown-black, with a fluffy beige head, and nice lacing. Floral hop aroma with a roasted scent. Not as creamy as expected, but a nice overall moutheel (gets better as it warms). Starts off roasted malt with hints of chocolate. Hop bitterness comes through on top of warm roasted notes. A little hoppier then what I expected from a porter, but the hops are balanced nicely and do not overpower. A  tasty porter."
"Sierra's Porter has been a long-time favorite of mine, but this was the first time I'd ever tried it on tap. There was certainly a difference. This poured very dark, almost black, with a nice tan head that stuck around. Smell was nice and roasty with some toffee, chocolate and coffee aromas. The taste was quite diverse, featuring all of the above flavors and some tasty, lingering hops. Mouthfeel was quite good with a nice, mellow carbonation. For a porter, this is pretty easy to drink. A typically excellent beer from SN."
"Very tasty porter although hoppier than most other American porters.  Dark ruby-brown-black body topped with fluffy brownish head...looks fantastic with a decent pour.  Aroma hop bitterness evident on top of warm roasted notes, not quite what I expect from a porter.  Flavor is intense chocolate overtones with lingering bitterness.  Another winner from Sierra...."
"pours to a beautiful dark and foamy sensation. i would have to say that this was just a sexy beer. it was very smooth with a dark coffee flavor that was just right. not the best porter i have had, but very good to say the least."
"If you like a well bittered porter, Sierra Nevada is worth a go."
"I would have given this a 5.0 on appearance, but it kind of looks like soda. The head is enormous and fluffy, and I didn't even pour it aggressively, so that part was beautiful. It has a very roasted toasted coffee flavor, almost tastes like it is burnt. A very enjoyable porter."
"This pours with a massive dark tan head that lasts and lasts, over deep ruby/coffee-colored ale. Nose is slightly sweet with roasted barley noticable. Taste is malty, with roasted malt dryness, a bit of sweetness followed by a hoppiness that does not overpower. Mouthfeel is somewhat medium bodied. Finishes with a nice interplay of maltiness and roastiness, a very drinkable, enjoyable & respectable porter!"
"Not the best Porter that I've had but maybe a good stepping stone for a beginner Porter-tryer-outer (?) ;-)).  The color is a typical dark maybe black color and pours a larger than typical head for some porters I've seen that is tannish in color.  The smell is that of burnt coffee and chocolate.  The flavor has coffee and chocolate notes as well as the notorious cascade hops that Sierra Nevada uses...and I'm not sure it fits in with a porter's typical flavor.  Not bad at all, but definitely not great.  Again another decent brew from S.N., but sub-par for them.  Cheers!"
"Overall a very average beerÂ…  Disappointing for a Sierra Nevada product."
"Dark brown with some indirect light penetration. Dark chocolate, medium roast coffee beans and piney hop aroma and flavor. Easy to drink, slighty above average, but unimpressive overall."
"dark with a thick, tan, creamy lasting head.  smells of dark roasted malts and plenty of hops.  chocolate malts dominate the taste, with a hint of coffee.  mouthfeel is full and rich, with the plentiful northwest hops providing a semi-dry, snappy finish.  if you like your porters creamy and hoppy, this is a must.  delicious."
"A deep, dark brown colour with a creamy, brownish head.  The scent lends more to a light, citrusy hop and the grounded, earthy.  A mild hoppy flavor pulls through the brew that leaves it a few shades drier than many porters Later, toasted tones also make themselves present in the taste.  A pleasing porter if one prefers the drier, hoppier renditions over the richer, maltier brews."
"Last fall, my brother ZAP and I did a blind taste test of 14 porters.  This came in First Place overall."
"This beer introduced me to the world of porters and it is still one of my favorites. Nice hoppy chocolate aroma, dark brown color with reddish highlights. Initial flavor is smooth, then turns to dryish, roasted coffee flavors with a hint of sweetness. A slight hoppy flavor, but most of the hops were used to balance the sweetness of this brew perfectly. Not cloying like some porters. This is a great beer cold or warm. For some reason I love to drink this in the summer time."
"Enormous creamy head, craters on top, microbubbles below. Sticks around and leaves excellent lace. Dark brown, with ruby highlights. Roasted malts in the nose. Roastiness and hops duel across the tastebuds.Chocolate in the aftertaste, along with hops. Mouthfeel could be creamier. Goes down easy. Remind me that I should drink more porters, and it's been too long since I've had this porter."
"Dark brown color, beautiful white frothy head that stays there for the finish.  Not much aroma except some faint roasted malt, wonderful roast malt, chocolate malt flavor balanced with hops.  Finish is smooth that begs for another draught.   The most drinkable porter I've had in a long time.  I'm going for another, over and out!"
"Pours a nice dark brown with a nice tan head.  Smells of burnt dark and chocolate malts, coffee, and some slight hop bitterness.  Taste starts off with some nice malts, chocolate/roasted, then fades into some coffee, and finally leaves the tongue as a nice hoppy bite at the end.  Slightly thin in the mouth but nicely drinkable.  Another good brew from SN.  Not anything that will knock your socks off but a nice brew nonetheless."
"Dark black cherry color with slight hops/earthy scent.  Bitter with a dry finish, hints of malt, but not enough to balance the brew.  I think its a little lighter in the mouth than I expected from its appearence."
"Wow. This is a beer. The best example of a porter I've ever tasted. Rich, dark, coffee, thick, beautiful... Perhaps a little more flavorful than a porter ""should"" be, but I am a long time advocate of west coast versions of traditional beer styles. Sierra Nevada Porter is a shining example of how to improve on England."
"The thick, rocky and creamy tan head is well retained.  Sharp, burnt toast black patent notes hit the nose at first, but as my senses adjust there is a pleasant, slightly earthy and floral Willamette hop nose accompanied by just a hint of caramel malt.  The borderline astringent sharp black patent bitterness is followed by an overly mellow and subdued chocolate malt flavor.  Hop bitterness is definitely above the norm for a porter, and the beer finishes with an equal mix of roasted grain and hop bitterness. This is certainly an interesting porter, but the roasted grain flavors and high hop rate aren't quite balanced by the relatively thin body and one dimensional maltiness. As a porter, it's a bit skewed in balance, but as a creation in itself it's quite drinkable."
"A very bold, bitter brew that should please fans of the style and of the brewery."
"I love this beer.  It has that signature Sierra crispy freshness(?) that makes you wonder how Sierra ALWAYS puts a quality craft brew in your glass.  The porter looks beautiful in the glass, the tan head lasts to the bitter(pun intended) end.  Astringent/tannic burnt malt flavors give way to cascades to produce a double bitter hit.  This six is disappering quickly."
"This is a great porter.  Seemingly straying from the Sierra Nevada tradition, the strong hops bitterness has taken a side-step and presents a strong smoked/burnt and maltiness flavor that eminates strongly throughout this brew.  Woodey notes. Dark brown with a tincture of red, the head lasts long after pour.  A sign of a quality craft."
"A good porter; light on the hops (but enough that you can drink it with pizza), medium malt makes it go down easy."
"Notes: An excellent West-Coast interpretation of a Porter. A must have when the weather gets cooler."
