"-great porter liked this much more than the other variety, a greatly crafted beer!"
""
"The smoke flavor was very overpowering. I just don't see the allure of this beer.  I normally really like darker beers but the overwhelming smoke flavor made this very hard to drink."
"Milky vanilla smell, smoked taste is overwhelming and almost meaty. Sour, malty, bitter finish."
"The nose and flavors are virtually the same as the vanilla is strong, yet a tad artificial, strong dry chocolate malt, light char or smoke and a bit or roasted coffee."
""

""

"Had on draft. Nice light porter. Prefer other stouts but this easy drinking"
""
""
"Overall - 4/5"
""
"Overall? Kind of a ""flat cola"" flavor, actually."
""
"Overall: The base Smoked Porter is a very fine beer. The vanilla is a nice touch, but like most vanilla beers, a bit heavy handed making the balance a bit too sweet for my tastes."
""
"Not bad. Still a very smokey taste. The vanilla does mellow it out substantially compared to the original smoked porter."

"A pretty decent porter, the vanilla is a nice touch and comes through in the aroma and taste.  Overall, not fantastic, but above average and very enjoyable to drink."
""
"Great balance of sweet and smoke. Not mind blowing flavor-wise, as I might have expected. Sounded better than tasted."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL:  A nice rendition of the smoked porter.  Vanilla kind of sticks out like a sore thumb, but it is still nice.  If they took this beer and aged in in bourbon barrels with coffee it would probably be the best thing ever."

"Enjoyed from a growler in a Rhinegeist snifter.  This unique porter pours a dark blackish brown with ruby highlights and a solid off white foam head that dissipates to a thin pool and light ring of foam leaving some fantastic lacing.  Nose of smoke, roasted malts, and rich vanilla.  Flavors are smoke and vanilla forward, with vanilla and smoke resting heavily on the back with a light bitter malts aftertaste.  Nice carbonation makes for an easy drinking experience, while the aftertaste reminds one that this is a unique take on a traditional porter.  Smoke is a bit lighter in this one than the standard smoked porter which is very nice.  For those who are not smoke fans this is a decent foray into the style."

"Poured a deep brown, almost black with a thin ring of tan head. A nice looking porter, true to form. Scents of smoked malt, roast malt, coffee with cream and vanilla, with the cream and vanilla predominating, but fairly balanced. Overall impression of aroma is of a nice porter, true to form, with the special ingredients discernible and complementing the aroma profile. Quite nice. Flavor begins with the typical porter flavor compliment, dark chocolate, coffee, roast malt, at medium levels, aided by a cream, vanilla and lightly smokey flavor. Middle opens up more bitterness, with a stronger roast malt character, black coffee with cream and vanilla, along with an increasing smoked malt presence, and bittersweet cocoa. Finish is dry with notes of smoked malt, smokey wood, bittersweet chocolate and black coffee, with a bit of vanilla. Aftertaste is roasted and smoked malt. Overall impression of flavor is of a bold, smokey porter, more intense than the base smoked porter, with enough vanilla flavor to add further depth. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium-high carbonation and a smooth initial feel that becomes drying. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a rather chalky porter, still within the style, and pleasant in its own way. Overall this is a fairly good beer. It has a nice aroma that highlights the special additions and a flavor that follows. Mouthfeel aids flavor and makes the beer quite easy to drink. Perhaps a bit too bold and lacking in subtlety, but it's Stone, so that is to be expected."
"Drinkability – This is a decent beer, but didn’t stand out as anything special."

"Started drinking it when it was still cold - very empty taste. Once it started to warm up the smoke came out and finished better."
""
""
"Good porter but not a big fan of porters because of the lack of carbonation. Nice and smooth with a hint of vanilla bean. stone knows what they are doing and cannot mess up a beer."

"Based on a 3/31/15 enjoy by date bomber- Poured a two finger off-white head into a pint glass. The color was a beautiful ruby brown color, with initial scents of vanilla and chocolate and ended with smells of coffee. To be honest, I was expecting a creamery feel, which I believe was over shadowed by the excessive carbonation. Overall I did enjoy it throughly and look foward to trying it again winter."
"Smokey, dark, so so smooth"
"Too much vanilla. Tastes like root beer."
""
""
"not exactly what I was expecting but worth a try if you like smoke, not the best Stone has to offer but respectable nonetheless"

"O: A great beer that I would return to frequently, but it's a bit overpriced ($8.99) in my neck of the woods, at least compared to the $6.99 price tag others have mentioned. Love the prominent vanilla flavors and the mild smoke notes. And I preferred it at colder temps."
""
""
""

""
""
"Purchased a 22oz. bottle from my local beer store for $6.99 this weekend. Solid price, solid beer. Poured into a mug, this beer produces a hefty, creamy head which lingers. Dark brown, almost black in color, but takes on reddish/amber hues when held up to a light. The aroma is roasty and hints at vanilla beans, but mostly I sense chocolate and coffee flavors from the aroma and the taste. Well-balanced, pleasant and drinkable with a hint of dryness in the aftertaste. My only potential reservation is that I did notice the elevated level of carbonation, but overall, I am quite pleased by this selection for the winter season."
"Would buy in reasonably priced six-packs."
"Look is dark brown but not quite black and very carbonated, two finger head. Smell was vanilla and hints of coffee. Was smooth and lighter than expected, with flavor of vanilla and aftertaste of spice which gave it a nice balance. Overall a pretty good beer, but I have to admit I was expecting more."
""
""
"The smokiness combined with the vanilla gives off a strange, almost licorice-like flavor that I couldn't get over."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad at all, and I normally avoid smoked porters. Nice vanilla edge."
""
"Good balance. The smoke takes a little getting used to, but I am attributing that to the style, not anything bad with the brewers."
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and I thought it was a nice example of the style, it had all the aspects from the original Smoked Porter, and while the vanilla wasn't the strongest flavor it did help make this beer a little more complex and it ended up being pretty balanced.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think one glass is the perfect amount for me, but I don't think it would be a chore for me to drink the whole bottle.  What I like the most about this beer was the complexity, the vanilla added another layer to this beer which makes it not as one dimensional as the original version.  What I liked the least about this beer was that vanilla wasn't a little stronger, i think the base beer could hold up a stronger vanilla aspect.  I would buy this beer again when In the mood for the style and I would recommend it to anyone who likes smoked beers, I don't think the vanilla covers up any of the smokey aspects.  All in all I liked this beer, I'm still not a huge fan of Stone's Smoked Porter, but I thought the addition of vanilla beans worked well with this beer and it didn't take anything away from it, it just added to it a little.  It's not a favorite Stone beer, but it is my favorite beer from their Smoked Porter series and it falls at above average for the style.  Nice job guys this was a nice take on the Smoked Porter, keep up the hard work."
""
""
""
"Thinner mouth feel than I'd prefer in a porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Stone's true strength is in their hoppy offerings but this is well worth your time. The aroma is more complex than the taste. I am not a fan of rankly potent vanilla extract in beers and this skillfully avoids that issue, using actual beans to season rather than dominate. The emphasis is firmly on the dark malt flavors."
"I really love stones smoked porter and this is a great addition. Different flavor. I can't really figure out a distinct vanilla flavor, but you can taste a difference between this and the regular and that difference is still very delicious."
""
""
"Not much smoke or vanilla, but it's still very drinkable. It does have a Coke-Cola pour to it, otherwise it's unremarkable. Not bad just boring."
""
"Goes down smooth. Low bitterness. Sweet hint behind the dark."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Very solid smoked porter and vanilla is nice compliment.  Not quite up there with founders and smuttynose though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad porter. I'm not a huge fan of the style but when I'm in the mood for a porter, this one would be good. Would purchase again when in the mood for this style. I like the vanilla character, not too strong but present nonetheless."
""
""
""
"O: Eh. Not a fan"
"This is a full-bodied brew with rich vanilla flavor. Pours dark with a nice sized head. It's one of the better porters I have sampled."
""
""
""
"It was okay but I would not get it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Little too Smokey for my taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This hits all of the notes that are advertised. Tastes like vanilla-infused smoke. Heavy on the vanilla. Not my favorite combo, I find. That said, it does a great job of providing the said components of the recipe. Make sure that you REALLY like these components (could I suggest a sampler) before diving into the whole snifter or bomber. Love Stone, Smoked Porter was not a big hit for me, and this wasn't either. However, you definitely get what you are asking for with this one. Maybe I am just not a big fan of the 'smoked' aspect. If you are, try this. I, for one, will be trying some of their other brews."
""
""
""
""
"The vanilla flavor hits a moment after it's in your mouth, and is gone before you swallow.  Pleasant and very drinkable, with a slightly-roasted (but not quite coffee-roasted) aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I decent tasting beer that could use a bit more vanilla and roasted malt.  It doesn't need they thick mouth feel of an imperial style but a bump up from what it is would be nice."
"Good but not one of there best! Glad I was able to try it!"
""
"Yum fun dum yummy arrrgggh"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I sure remember when Stone was the thing to have, and sure their IPAs are arguably the best in the world, but I really want beers that I can drink affordable and drink often, and this one does not fit that bill. Asa change to the normal porter lineup, this definitely offers uniqueness, but ask me what porters I am drinking for fun, and this one will not be on the list."
"Beer did not taste great"
""
""
"I popped this open on a cold winter night. The Vanilla taste and aroma is there but it isn't overwhelming, well balanced. Beautiful color in a glass. A very great porter. Next time I'm at my local craft beer stop I'll be picking a bottles of this. Perfect for this time of year. Stone has yet again made another fantastic beer."
""
""
"Deep chocolate brown with just a hint of light working its way through. Average head and minimal lacing. Aroma is light, giving me ever so light amount of smoke. Taste is on the light side for a porter IMO, but is good overall. Smokiness is very faint and I feel that this could be elevated a little more to ad some body to this brew. Vanilla hints are nice, just enough, and adds a nice cool smoothness to the beer. Slight watery finish, but overall, a decent porter and another good brew by Stone"
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Totally dig this beer. It gets better every sip, and they have the vanilla spot-on."

"A pleasant enough re-imagining of the original smoked porter, wherein the vanilla guest star eventually overcomes the inherent smokiness of the base beer.  I actually like this one better overall, for the same reasons - less acrid meaty smoke (save that for the summer BBQs on my deck), and more sweet, sweet vanilla - the sort of thing I used to derive from homemade vanilla vodka - yeah."
""
""
""
""
""
"For being ""limited"" this beer is a disappointment. With that said if it were year around I wouldn't buy it.."
""
"Good beer but not great. This beer sounded a little better than it tasted. Was hoping for a bit more mouth feel."
"O:  Good beer.  Not mind blowing, but solid.  Wish the vanilla from the nose was as prevalent in the taste.   4"
""
""
"Light bodied, and easy to drink.  Faint vanilla taste.  Bitter finish.  Had high hopes for this one...Not disappointed, but not blown away either."
""
"Overall: Very please with this beer! Very sweet and easy drinking. The flavor is mellow, and just a joy to drink!"
""
"Tasty, and very easy drinking... glad I picked this one out of the 20+ I had to choose from!"
""
"Cheers!"
""
"Rich dark brown, nearly black with a huge flush head that stands up very well.  Rich toasty nose with a hit of BBQ sauce smell.  Really didn't pick up vanilla on the nose.  Taste is very nice malty, chocolaty, smokey sweetness with a slightly bitter finish.  Mouth feel is smooth with the vanilla apparent at the back of the palate."
""
""
""
""
"Looks better than it tastes is the reason for the outlier BA App. Don't question me!"
"Too much smoke for me. It lingers to long in the after taste."

"Notes: This is an excellent porter, but I want extremely mouth shattering from my Stone beers.  This is a great beer.....but it's not a ""Stone""..."
""
""
""
" The flavor is really good with a lot more complexity than most beers of this strength with nice caramel in the malt with mild roasted and slight smoke with the vanilla adding a smooth and almost creamy accent to enhance the sweetness somewhat. I really like the way the vanilla works but I have a feeling the chipotle may be a little more to my taste since the smoke in the pepper could be complimentary to the base. I like the vanilla but it does seem to soften the smoke aspect I enjoy most in the original."

"D - Another outstanding offering from Stone... The appearance is world class... The aroma is excellent... The taste is outstanding but lacking in terms of the vanilla bean addition... The mouthfeel is slightly above average... An excellent beer, but the absence of vanilla on the palate is a shame... I would drink again and would love to do the side by side tasting with the other Stone Smoked Porter offerings..."

"Overall/Comments: I thought this was an excellent beer that was a great twist on an already classic porter. The vanilla bean blended seamlessly into the existing flavor profile. Try it if you can find it. Consumed 12/28/2013. Classified as an American Porter @ 5.9% ABV."

"02/05/14 On tap. Well placed as a porter. Smoke is way back as is the vanilla...but there is much to like in this glass. It could be...smokier...sweeter...warmer...more vanilla-y...more a lot of things. Any of which would mess with what it wants to be. I get it & I like it."

"O - Unfortunately Stone's Smoked Porter with Vanilla Beans, a brew I've much been looking forward to, has succumb to the overwhelming variety of my beer fridge and wasn't drank soon enough. Having not experienced this before, I can't speak on the changes it's undergone, a month and a half past their ""enjoy by"" date, but what I can tell from drinking this bottle is that I'll be keeping my eyes out for it when it's released again because the natural Madagascar vanilla bean additions are a wonderful compliment to the beer. I'm sure they're only much better fresh."
""
""
""
""
"o: at first I thought I would have liked a bit more vanilla in this, but ultimately everything is balanced very well to make a really nice, interesting, rich and creamy porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is not at all a bad beer, but it hardly seems to hit on anything that I would have looked for with the beer of this name. Neither something I would refuse, nor seek out."

"An incredibly rich dark beer. The pour was pitch black with a nice coffee head. The smell was all vanilla which was a little daunting, but left me happily surprised when I gave a taste. A smooth earthy porter with a sweet finish. The vanilla commented the flavors of coffee and dark chocolate well. If i had one problem with the beer it was that it was too filling. One 22oz bottle was more than enough for just me."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Overall: A solid vanilla-heavy beer. A bit thin for me, but really nice vanilla flavors as well as some coffee-chocolate. This is a very drinkable porter, and definitely well brewed."
""
""
""
"Black with some ruby around the edges and a finger of off-white head. The vanilla shows up right away on the nose along with roasted malts and a char scent that thankfully avoids overwhelming the aroma. Whereas the smell is nice and balanced, the taste is less so: I get sweet vanilla up front followed by potently bitter char, smoke, cream, and coffee. The bitter and the sweet notes don't quite gel together and the mouthfeel is bordering on watery, but it's a good brew with an interesting combination of flavors."
""

"Drinkability/notes: Quite excellent, pairs well with rich chocolate desserts, and seems perfect for a winter night."

"Overall, a fine tasting porter with emphasis on the dark malt grains, chocolate overtones, and a very fine vanilla edge. The mouthfeel is a little weak, somewhat watery, but that is a minor complaint. On the whole, the peaty smokiness, vanilla, and chocolate flavors triumph."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: too much vanilla."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I think I like the regular version better. This isn't bad but the vanilla just seems like an afterthought."
"Overall: This is fantastic. And, compared to another San Diego porter with vanilla (that is highly rated too) this is way better. Still tastes like porter, but the other characteristics come out nicely and balance well with the porter flavors. I'm happy that I picked this up, and hope it shows up in bottles once in a while again"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - When cold, I felt this was overly bitter; however, once it warmed up, it became much more enjoyable and balanced. I thought the vanilla provided a nice compliment to the chocolate and roast body. Not much smoke for a ""smoked porter""."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with soft carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink. Has a light vanilla and coffee aftertaste. A nicely made beer from Stone. A very nice example of how an American Porter should be made."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ah the taste is nice and sweet like drinking a French Vanilla coffee from my local donut shop. Vanilla is full but the smoke is more vague. Roasted malts find their way into the background and there is a lingering but mild finish. Drinkable all the way."
""
"Overall - A bit pricey, but another homerun by Stone in my opinion!"
""
""
"Pours a beautiful dark mahogany with a very healthy off-white head. Unfortunately the rest of the beer just doesn’t do it for me, which is so disappointing because I love Stone’s original Smoked Porter. The vanilla just does not blend well with the malts in terms of aroma and flavor. The addition of vanilla is more harsh than smooth and sweet, and just plain tastes bad. Perhaps it will be worth a revisit one day, as I can’t quite figure out what happened with what sounds like such a promising (and highly rated) beer."

""
""
""
""
""

""
""

""
"Overall- Decent enough but I would have preferred stronger vanilla and smoke flavors."
""
"O- Not a huge porter fan, and certainly not a smoked beer fan. This works though. The normal version of Smoked porter doesn't do a whole lot for me, but add the vanilla, and it makes ""meh"" into ""nice""."
"Feels too light all around.  Water-ed down almost sugary flavor almost like a light root beer.  Very drinkable because of this.  The look and smell trump anything else this beer has to offer.  Good to try but not impressed. So many other great beers brewed by stone though, this just isn't one of the greats in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"After recovering from some initial harsh qualities, it mellows nicely in the end. Very good."
""
"p.s. Stone had a recipe that had you make your own egg nog with it, but I tried just mixing it with some Bolthouse Farms Eggnog and it did not turn out well."
""
""
""
"O - I must say I am a big fan of Stone Smoked Porter, but this is new brilliance from stone, and honestly, I prefer this to the regular offering. This is just what that porter was meant to be. I sure hope this is a mainstay in the Stone seasonal lineup. It's that good."
""
""
""

"Dark brown, clear, chestnut highlights. Medium yellow-brown cap, good head retention with lots of sticky, clumpy lace. Chocolate aroma, mild smoke that was more prominent right after the pour, malty, vanilla, caramel. Solid bitterness, malty and chocolate flavours, hint of smoke, nicely balanced vanilla, light burnt character. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, a bit creamy, nice texture. Quite enjoyable. The vanilla melded very well with the smoked porter, nicely balanced."
""
""
"O - great beer. very well balanced"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is quite flavorful for its ABV and definitely for those who love vanilla."
""
""
"An interesting porter, I found this beer a very tasty one that seems like a great companion to a chocolate- enhanced dessert. The chocolate aspects are just as noticeable- perhaps more so- than the vanilla, which could be a plus or a minus, depending on one’s expectations. I found the balance very nice and it convinces me to rate this as yet another first- class product from one of California’s best breweries."
"The beer drinks really easily. I could easily put away a few of these bombers."
"Flavor is pretty straight forward. Starts off with smokey, roasted and burnt malt notes. Slight coco powder sweetness is perceived with some nice vanilla bean spice and sweetness. The burnt notes still take the lead on this brew with the vanilla bean riding shotgun. Nice dry roasted finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Great stout, bitter but sweet on the lips."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O- A solid beer but not much of an improvement from the original. ."
""
"Poured a brownish copper hue with two finger head and lace patches. A mix of chocolate and roasted/smoked aromas (not that smoked) seem to be all I can smell as the vanilla barely registers/is muted. A pretty good smoked porter with roasted/smoked malts and some dark chocolate mingling around but the vanilla beans add themselves in the taste and as the beer warms it tends to get a more sweet vanilla taste. Basically, this is Stone's regular smoked porter with a touch of vanilla, not a vanilla smoked porter, but still a good addition and a really good beer."
""
"O - Very enjoyable - The vanilla is present but is balanced with the smoke and malt. A very well crafted brew. I think I enjoy their regular smoked porter just a touch more than this, but I will purchasing this again soon."
""
"Good beer but I just didn't get vanilla in the smell or taste. The smoke on this is good, not overpowering, but if there is vanilla it was hidden by the smoke. There was some chocolate and roasted oak on the taste. It pours dark with a nice frothy caramel head. I enjoy stone beers and this was good but just not quite my favorite"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Shared a bottle among four friends using wine glasses. Not well received by anyone in the group. The overwhelming smell of burnt popcorn pervaded the nose. The vanilla was almost non-existent in nose or while tasting. Mouthfeel was almost watery. This beer was not what I expected from Stone. I purchased two bottles, but had to bring the second back and ask for an exchange."
""
""
"o: Initially more than lives up to its title in the smoke department. Porter usually tastes somewhat smoky, but this one plasters your palate with it. Any vanilla seems overwhelmed at first by the dominant smokiness, but later shows up clearly, especially in the aroma and aftertaste. Smooths out to inviting easy drinking once you get past the initial blast of smoke and bitterness. Would probably go well with a cigar. A good buy for $4.50 a bomber."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Never had the regular version but it seems like a good porter base. The addition of vanilla beans is just ridiculous. Drink this."
""
""
""
""
""
"Straight 4.25 rating with a 4.5 overall because it's a fabulous choice when I'm looking for a legitimate PORTER. Not one that's labelled as such and is actually a stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a creamy tan head that dissipates very quickly and leaves quite a bit of lacing. The beer itself is a very dark brown that is bordering on black. When held up to the light, the beer is a little bit transparent and can see through it. The beer smell has very strong vanilla notes that overpowers the other notes. Dark chocolate and bits of smoke. The beer taste has a much stronger smokier note than smell but complements the vanilla instead of competing. In essence, the flavor is kinda of liked smoked vanilla beans. The other notes in taste are the same as the smell. Dark chocolate, hints of mocha beans, and a light smoke but with a smokier aftertaste. Also, there are slight hints of caramel. The feel is medium bodied and smooth. This is definitely one of the smoother porters that I've had with very little carbonation. Overall, not a bad porter but the notes are off balance with the vanilla beans taking over."
"Poured out of a 22oz. bottles, the beers pours dark brown almost black with hints of brown when held up to light topped with a thin mocha head that quickly dissipated to lace after 60-90 seconds. The aroma is nice with hints of sweet chocolate, dark coffee, toffee, molasses, burnt malt,vanilla, and a nice hint of smoke. The taste is much smoker than the smell (which I pleasantly enjoy) with nice blend of dark and sweet chocolate, espresso, vanilla bean, and toffee finishing with a nice malty backbone mixed with some more smoke. The mouth-feel is med/full bodied with some slight carbonation. Overall I loved this beer, loved the style, the smokiness, and the twist of adding the vanilla bean to an already great beer."
"Overall this was a ""meh"" beer by Stone. I was actually a little disappointed in it. This is a take it or leave it beer that I won't go seeking out in the future."

"I honestly can say that this beer is on my ""avoid"" list.I recently tried clown shoes ganghis pecan.With all that roasted and smoked characters it really gave the beers a taste that my pallet just won't forgive.To each their own.But for this guy I have to give it a fail."

"Cola brown, translucent pour with a thick persistent khaki cap and loads of lacing. Smells immediately of roasted/smoked malt with hints of vanilla, molasses, and bakers chocolate. The smoke isn't overpowering and combines well with the other flavors in the nose for a very inviting beginning. Taste is rather mild. There is the roasted/smoked character right away, but not strong. The smoke is pleasant but dominates with hints of vanilla, semisweet chocolate, earth, and coffee rounding out the flavor. Carbonation seems bright. Mouthfeel is a bit light and watery. This is a pretty drinkable smoked porter that is lighter on the smoke and I think the hints of vanilla are a nice addition."
"Overall – Lots of nice vanilla flavors mixed with a good porter base and a bit of smoke. This was a quite enjoyable brew overall and in my opinion moderately superior to the none vanilla bean aged brew."

"D: This was a decent smoked porter, but I didn't get a lot of vanilla character. The scent and taste were sort of dirty and artificial. The body wasn't great either, and the finish was pretty harsh, so it wasn't really easy to drink. I'm not impressed."
""

"O: Very tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is a very nice flavorful porter to drink for a long time."

"O: The recent addition of vanilla beans to harsher tasting porters and stouts really gives these beers more drinkability. Stone rings the bell with this one. Try it with some sharp cheddar or barbecue."

"This is a pretty good porter, and a nice change of pace from the high-ABV, rich, thick stouts that are saturating the market. If you want an easy drinker which some nice, subtle flavors, grab a bottle."

"On tap at The Top in Gainesville. Pours dark brown to black with some ruby showing through the edges and a small light brown/cream colored head. Aroma of sweet malts, smoke, roast, light vanilla. Flavor starts with some light and sweet roast, light smoke that keeps some balanced bitter on hand, and then explodes with huge vanilla on the midpalate. Finally, a chocolate molasses & vanilla sweetness is left on the palate. Medium bodied--seems right on for a porter--with medium carbonation. This drinks very easy and is a huge improvement over the thin and boring base smoked porter. Worth trying for sure."
""
"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, vibrant, brown-caramel coloring with a frothy, clingy, off-white head that clings all over the glass as you drink. Aromas of rich, creamy vanilla, subtle smoke, milk chocolate, and subtle coffee notes. Very rich and creamy sweet nose. Flavors are smoked forward, with a bitter coffee introduction, followed quickly by rich and sweet creamy characteristics, chocolate notes, and a subtle bitterness underneath it all. Very well balanced, and sweet overall, like a sweet dessert cake. Smooth and light in mouth, with a roasted and slightly bitter blend to the creamy linger in the aftertaste. The finish is smooth and slick, with a subtle linger of bitter and sweet balance. Tasty and very drinkable. Great brew."

"Overall, a very good smoked porter. The vanilla could have been amped up a little to give it a sweet touch but the smoked aspect is done well."

"O-First sip I was very surprised how awesome the vanilla bean was. I thought it was going to be a dark porter with a slight, somewhat detectable amount of vanilla bean. Instead it sips like a porter vanilla bean ice cream float. With enough porter qualities for the porter fanatic, this beer is one that I see most having to try. Cheers to Laura Ulrich at Stone for her creative infusion."

"Pours a deep mahogany with a 3 inch tan head, that settles slowly and leaves behind rings of lace on my giant Duvel tulip glass, bottle says best by 3/25/14. Smell is french vanilla, bread, honey, some hints of coffee, tobacco, and subtle smoke. Taste is has some butterscotch, more smoke than the nose, some french vanilla, and some leather. Body is medium especially for its 5.9 ABV, plenty of carbonation, a touch dry, and tremendous drinkability. Very nice brew, I prefer it way over regular."
""
"All in all, not a terrible beer but I guess I was hoping for more."
""
""
"Overall fair but this is far from Stone's best work in my opinion. The vanilla was the only thing that kept me drinking it."
"O: A pretty disappointing beer, but I would give this another try if the price was right and the bottle was 6-8 months from bottling. Too much vanilla for me at this stage and no smoked quality and I think a little would really work well here with a solid base beer."
"O - A decent smoked porter, but the vanilla steals the show. Enjoy !"

"Pours a  clear brown,  garnet edges in glass,  tan head with spray of delicate lacing.  Smell:  vanilla ice cream in a  cake cone,  cocoa puffs,  cappuccino note,  toast.  Taste: notes of citric coffee and cocoa,   brown sugar,  vanilla, burnt toast and earth.  Finish is tannin city,  blah.  Half of a really good beer."

"O - A nicely balanced, very crisp and dry brew. I like this one a lot. leaves you wanting another sip."

"It's a much better beer than I thought it was going to be...but, IMO, it's a mess; unrefined. Flavors are very good and provide a nice profile, mouthfeel and aroma are a mess. Not sure I can recommend. But, I would like to say, for a smoked beer the flavors are done very nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Yep, this is one of the best Porters I've ever had. This is what I have been hoping I would find every time I've ever bought, or imagined, a vanilla porter. Beautifully balanced and complex. Stone continues to amaze me with their craftsmanship and excellent brews! If you haven't dedicated some time trying Stone beers, you're kind of wasting your life. I will hunt this down every time it is released."

"Pours out dark as night with no translucency and a one finger beige head with little retention but some decent lacing on the glass. Smell is of dark fruits, raisins in the background but pretty vanilla forward. Ironically I don't smell any smoke but I wouldn't be surprised if it came out in the taste. Taste is definitely a little more smoky as expected but not overpowering to be sure. Definitely some nice raisins, prunes, dark fruits, and quite a bit of glorious vanilla to go along with it. I'm very partial to vanilla beers and this doesn't disappoint but it is very well balanced and not really crazy vanilla. It is still vanilla forward but the smoke really tames it down to be sure. Taste is actually not as much vanilla as I expected. Mouthfeel is medium and is not too thick for the style. Could be thicker. Overall this is a great beer but I think I'll like it more once some of the smoke ages and the vanilla is more forward."
"Typical Stone beer- a couple intense flavours, not much subtlety. It's what's advertised- a lot of smoke and vanilla. You're not going to find a whole lot else here. I enjoyed it and finished the whole bomber on my own without any complaints, but I'm not going to be buying this one again."

"O-A good brew. This is the first smoked porter I've ever had, so I wish it was their basic one so I could get a better idea of what to expect, but I wasn't going to pass it up."
""
"I like this beer, but only to have one as a change of pace. It definitely has a strong vanilla smell and taste that dominates it. It has nice carbonation which I like in stouts and porters. A nice dessert beer that is a quality entry from Stone, but some people might be put off by the domination of the vanilla."
""
"The aftertaste is bitter and nice. Lingering. This is the best beer I've had in a the last week or so, and I've had a few good ones (and lots of ambitious ones). A nice treat."
"O- I enjoyed this beer more than expected, it had a nice smell and it had the right amount of vanilla to give it a nice enjoyable taste, might pick up another if i find one."
"This is a very nice porter. The vanilla really comes through and shines without being overwhelming. I wish this still came in 12oz bottles, but oh well. This is worth checking out."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer was a treat, and I'm glad that I bought it. The mouth feel was a bit disappointing to me, but the taste you get out of this beer is definitely worth it, and I would buy it again. Great if you're looking for a dark beer but don't necessarily want a heavy stout."
""
"O: Much like the standard smoked porter from Stone, this is a very nice easy drinking brew. I'm not convinced the vanilla brings much to the party, but it doesn't detract much either."

"Appearance is dark brown with ruby edges and a finger of tan head that enjoyed some lengthy retention. The dominant note in the nose is vanilla. Vanilla flavor is also present, but the roast profile is not terrible potent. The finish is surprisingly dry. Much like the standard Smoked Porter, there is really no discernible smoke."
""
""
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Large, fluffy, beige head, high retention on a black body. Suddsy, soapy, sticky lacing. Aroma includes notes of smoke, toasted malt, coffee, vanilla, chocolate malt, milk. Taste includes all of the same but the aftertaste is really a spectacular note of the vanilla. Delicious. I'm happy that the smoke isn't overdone, very nice."

"Opaque body with thin, spotty off-white head floating around. Soft aroma of vanilla, milk chocolate, light roast, and subtle ash. Tastes of vanilla beans, milk chocolate made from spoiled milk, light bitterness comes through towards the finish, the smokiness tranforms into a strange burnt grassiness in the background behind the sweets. It's a college kid's idea putting vanilla beans into a great porter. It might have been worth the experiment but who would reach for this more than once?"
""
"I like this one, it's not the greatest thing to ever come out of this brewery but it has its moments. The smokiness is out in the front taking control which I like. Then the vanilla and chocolate come in a little subdued. I could stand the vanilla being a little stronger. I've never been too impressed by any porter, so this sits right in the middle top."

"o.a. not good, sorry stone. still love ya, you're still in my top five, but beerlover don't likey this one. drain poured the last half, almost blasphemy for stone."
""
"Overall- I enjoyed it but the flavor profile is very specific. I could imagine hating this beer if I had it in the wrong setting after the wrong beers. Definitely worth a try because of its specificity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not picking up very much vanilla in this one. I'd like for the vanilla flavor to jump out and separate this version from the original smoked porter. Still, a solid enough effort."
""
""
""
"On the whole, very nice without quite making the leap into excellence. Definitely a nice winter beer, and I appreciate having a cold-weather option that isn't a 10% stout, but I kept finding myself wishing for just a bit more oomph, especially body-wise. A pleasant drinking experience nevertheless."
""
"T/M - Vanilla makes a sliiight appearance, and it kind of tastes like a smore. Pretty much tastes just like the regular smoked porter..a graham cracker flavor comes and goes quickly as well...really interesting..maybe a little bit more mellow due to the vanilla laced in there. tastes great, somewhat creamy and very smooth and drinkable just wish they emphasized the vanilla bean flavor in there more.taste kind of resembles one of those candy chocolate covered coffee beans!! Instead of struggling to taste it I want it to hit me right away and end with the smokiness. Due to the whole smokiness factor this makes for a great winter beer! All in all though this is a solid beer. Coffee lovers will especially dig this;cheers."

"Very solid beer from Stone. Not as dramatic as some of there other brews, but it was nice to sit down to on a cold note. Very warm like a campfire."
""
"O - A very nice porter from Stone, not overly smokey or sweet, the vanilla plays nicely off the base beer. Slight knocks for the slightly too thin mouthfeel and perhaps just a hint of odd cola like sweetness on the aftertaste. Still would definitely get this again if given the opportunity, although I wouldn't rush to the store for it."

"Dark crimson mahogany hue, typically I recall the smoked porter to be a bit darker in color. Huge billowing light tan head fine speckled lacing covers the sides of my glass very pleasant looking brew. Aromatics offer up a nutty/vanilla earthiness combined with dark chocolate/milk chocolate cocoa notes, the nose invites the notion of dessert or something very decadent about to reach the palate. Balanced flavor profile upfront vanilla bean character, with charred roasted malt and a mild smokey character offering up a nice bitterness to dry the palate out. In addition to the dark roasts, smoked malts, and vanilla beans this beer is packing around 50 or so IBUS. I get a nice herbal hop in the backend and it plays to how drinkable and well crafted this special winter release is, medium to light bodied nice textures a bit more residual sugars or caramelization on the palate but still finishes clean and dry ample moderate carbonation carries the flavor profile very well. Overall a go to beer, if your lucky enough to have Stone in your distribution network where you live, give this a try this winter."

"Overall - Not bad, but not particularly great either. Thin to the point of seeming watered down. The vanilla is too sweet without a more robust malt backbone to tone down the sweetness. Wouldn't really recommend this if you are looking for rich and creamy, you won't find it here."
""
""
"I think I prefer the plain Jane Version more, but glad I got to try it. I think vanilla in Porters is something I like in theory more than practice. Drinks alright..."

"22oz bottle with an Enjoy By date of the Ides of March 2014. Pours a dark brown with some ruby hues and an inch of frothy khaki head. Some lacing. The aroma is smokey and earthy. Vanilla is the most prevalent. The taste is a mix of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and hints of smoke. Reminds me of a cookie. Lots of vanilla and chocolate flavor. Not much of an alcohol presence. Lots of carbonation. Drinkable with the vanilla flavor not being too overpowering. More of the smoke comes out at the finish. I'm a big fan of the normal version but this one is good as well. Overall, worth having again."
""
"Dark brown appearance with a dense, towering, beige head. The aroma brings prominent vanilla, pretty much dominating the scent. The flavor is primarily vanilla. Smoke gets lost a bit here. Pretty sweet throughout. Some bitterness in the finish, even a bit rough on the palate. This was alright."

"O: It could be a little smoother, but aside from that this is a very nice smoked porter with vanilla bean. It doesn't get too out of control with the sweetness, but it can definitely still satisfy a sweet tooth. Extremely easy to drink, I definitely wish this was in a 4-pack. Glad they decided to bring it back to bottles after the successful 2012 run"

"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Dark hue, with only a slight head, and very little lacing. Nose is a really strong combination of coffee, chocolate, and vanilla; all with a slightly smoked character. Flavor is of the same...chocolate, vanilla, and coffee...with a bit of bitter pungency that lingers on the palette. Overall, this is a good quaff."

"Still pored a huge two finger head in that lingered nicely with plenty of stickiness towards the end. Smell still had plenty of Vanilla, chocolate syrup with a touch of smokiness. Taste is very forward with the vanilla and smooth chocolate like a Hershey bar. Mouthfeel is excellent pretty much what you would want for a porter. I had this when it was fresh and I got to say I think it got better sitting. A lot more of the flavors seemed to be more pronounced. Overall this was an excellent beer and would gladly pay 2.99 for another!"
"Overall: A smooth, easy drinking porter that has a substantial vanilla flavor. Mouthfeel could be a bit thicker. Bit one-dimensional."
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium bodied, with low to low-medium carbonation. The resulting mouthfeel is smooth, slightly foamy, if not a bit thin. Closes quite dry, as fitting for the roasted flavors and ingredients. There is slight residual stickines across the palate."

"O - I really enjoy the nose of this beer. The flavor was great until it started to warm up. The burnt flavor that came through as it warmed was not pleasant. I would drink this again, but would enjoy it cooler than I would normally enjoy a porter."

""
""
"O: A flavor packed bottle that isn't too rich but would go well with dessert. A decent amount of smoke in the flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark amber color. Roasted chocolaty vanilla smokey aroma as expected. Very chocolaty and smokey taste with a hint of the alcohol. The smoke and vanilla are an interesting combination that works really well. Slightly carbonated. Definitely something to be savored. We'd definitely like to try this on draught."
""
""
""
"Overall (3.75): This is a decent porter, albeit not exactly what I was expecting. The vanilla is a nice complement to the smoke and slightly charred bitterness of the roasted malts, and thankfully no part of this is overdone in any way. That said, no part of it reaaally jumps out at you, either, but it’s very balanced and drinkable."
"The mouthfeel is very nice and overall really good."
""
""
"Another solid application by Stone. This bottle is better than the fresh bottle I tried, which was a bit unexpected. A nice punch of smoke blends well with the vanilla. Kind of like a burnt dessert that doesn't suck."
""
"Pours up black with great white head. No lacing. Aroma is vanilla bean right up front. Sweet malts. Taste is same as nose. Amazing fucking beer. Very cheap too. Full body. I dig this. Drinkin this while watching ""I Heart Huckabees"" good movie so far to start."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black. Small-medium, off-white/tan head that disappears quickly. Scent is nice and roasty. Dark malt, dark chocolate...with A LOT of vanilla. Taste is initially vanilla forward. A TON of vanilla. Not nearly as smokey as the original smoke porter. Very faint smoke with a well balanced, sweet, dark chocolate edge. Somewhat bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a great beer that is very tasty. I prefer the Chipotle version more though."
"Stone Smoked Porter with Vanilla Bean pours out a deep brown color with a tiny off-white head. The aroma is a little awkward, with the vanilla never quite properly integrating with the smoked malts. The taste is much more balanced than I expected, with an excellent vanilla flavor mingling with the solid smoke and roast flavors of the original. The late aftertaste is where this beer really diverges from the original, with the vanilla lingering on the palate long after the smoke and roast have given up the ghost. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and fairly coating, and the drinkability is exceptional. Overall, the Vanilla Bean treatment on Stone's Smoked Porter is another success. It's not as perfectly complementary as the Chipotle version, but it's still worthy."
""
"This is a novel idea. I enjoy porters and vanilla is a wonderful dessert/gourmet addition but i feel like this beer falls short. The mouthfeel is too smooth and lacks the punch that a good porter has. The smell is the best thing about this beer but is misleading. On paper, its a great idea, but it really fails top deliver. I was glad my serving was 12 oz. I wouldn't revisit it again. Nice try Stone."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours black with a nice froffy off white head about 2 fingers. Smells of chocolate, almost of candy bar quality, probably because of the blend of the porter with the vanilla bean. The vanilla taste dominates, although it does have a little bit of a coffee note. Beer is slightly undercarbonated, but it is fine for a porter of light body. Overall, a pretty good beer."

"O: I really didn't expect to like this at all. Porters aren't a style that I usually seek out, and I generally dislike smoked beers. But I bought this as a single bottle on a whim. While not exactly complex, this beer delivers what it says. Really pretty good."
""
""
"O- not my favorite, I'm not a huge fan of porters but I'm by no means opposed to them, just something about the really odd and unpleasant aftertaste is making this one difficult to drink for me, I wouldn't buy again"
"A bit disappointing. Too ""odd"" in the vanilla up front -- it just doesn't work. An uneven beer. Easy to drink, but not a quality level I expect from Stone."

"O: Complex flavours, unlike any beer I have ever tried. For me, the mouthfeel was a bit lacking though."
""
"Medium body with a creamy, slightly oily feel on the palate, with a bitter finish. Overall, the bitterness of the chocolate was just a little too much for this beer. Would be better if the sweetness and bitterness were balanced a bit more. Still quite good. I don’t care for smoked beers but this one has the right idea."

"O: It's got some good character, but it needs just a little something more."
""
""
"Overall, do yourself a favor and try this one. Definitely worthwhile."

"The mouthfeel is good, the balance is a little off, but I can't imagine this one would be easy. Medium bodied, maybe slightly on it's way to full bodied. A very nice carbonation level and a good balance between bitterness and sweetness. It's much more drinkable than I expected. I've had it a couple times, the first time I had it, it was very fresh. I gotta say, even though it's recommended fresh, it's good to sit on this a couple of months. Initially the flavors don't blend all that well together, now it's much nicer. Before the smoke was a little too aggressive and then followed up by vanilla that was a little too sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - it's okay but really a disappointment from what I was expecting. The vanilla doesn't add much, the flavors are muted, and the body is really thin. Was hoping for more from Stone"
"O --- very good! I try to match food with smoked porters, but I could drink this one by itself."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Bravo to Stone for capturing such a rich and fresh Vanilla flavor in this beer. This a very drinkable every day Porter by style but with some great robust flavors. The vanilla, smoke, and roast really come together to enhance the base beer experience in my opinion."
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: As per the back of the bottle, I think this beer would be best with dessert. I had it by itself and I wish I had some cookies or cake to go with it. By itself it's just okay. The flavor combo works but it doesn't really pop out or make itself an amazing porter. Its just an okay porter by itself. Smoky, interesting, but one is enough. However....I really think if this was paired with food I might feel very different about this beer. I may have to try it again in the future and see if my hunch is right."
""
""
"GOOD, NOT MUST HAVE!"

"O: Good stuff. I paid $3.99 for the single bottle, which is a little pricey, but I'm not unhappy with the taste of this beer at all."
""
""
""

"Eh. It's nowhere near as good as the vanilla porter, which could also be better. The chipotle integration is masterful, but the base beer leaves something to be desired."

"Overall a really solid beer from Stone, now lets see a Stone IRS w/Vanilla bottled."
"Stone Smoked Porter is a benchmark for the style. Somehow, despite the fact that I like vanilla, adding it to this beer did not create something better. Yes, it is good, but it's not amazing. Still worth a try, though."
"O- Pretty neat vanilla beer, very different. Im not a huge vanilla porter fan but if I had to pick one it would be this one because its got a good sweetness paired with the vanilla instead of bitterness."
"O - A nice drinkable porter. The vanilla is there but I was expecting a bit more I guess. Good balance between sweet and bitter."
"D/O - I have to say, this is absolutely one of my favorite porters. It has all the regular porter appeal with the added vanilla that I love to make it a winner. I could drink this all the time. It is sublime. Stone, please make this one on the regular, and not the chipotle one."
""
"O: Not so tasty. Still interesting. The main taste is great; the aftertaste kills it."
""
"The combination of vanilla beans and smoke give this a little bit of a barrel aged feel to it. I had this before and didnt enjoy it as much as I am now...it seems there has been a bit of a mellowing effect after a month or two. Before, the smoke and vanilla fought each other tooth and claw...but they are a little more integrated now and actually is fairly decent. Still think the vanilla is a bit much, especially paired with the relatively light smoke flavor the regular Stone Smoked Porter shows. I dont think this is one of Stone's better offerings...especially at nearly $4 a bottle!"

"O: Love the vanilla bean, but the beer is not balanced. Won't buy again."

"Not the beer I would have chosen for Stone to bring back, but a solid vanilla porter. Only $6, definitely picking up a few more. Much better experience this time around"
"Pours black with sudsy and creamy light tan head. Looks like low carbonation with good lacing that is sticking around. The smell is mostly vanilla and chocolate. Coffee and chocolate notes blend together nicely with vanilla being the most dominant. This smokey, earthy porter is balanced out by that burst of vanilla bean. There is a smooth, light, velvety mouthfeel for this brew and it has moderate carbonation. ABV does not draw attention to itself. Overall this was a great smoked porter with a great infusion of flavors."
""
""
""
"Just average. Vanilla is just too strong in their interpretation."
""
"O: A good beer, though perhaps not as focused as it could be. The battle between smoke and vanilla all but drowns out the nuances. It starts to seem one-dimensional and begins to wear on the palate."
""
"Mouthfeel has a nice medium-bodied creamy texture. Overall, I like the beer but I don't love it. I like vanilla porters/stouts and I like Stone Smoked Porter but blending the two may be a bit too much."
""
""
"O - another good beer from Stone."
""
"What a wonderful beer. The depth of flavor is fantastic, more so as it warms."
"[O] Bought 1 bottle and I'd like to pick up another for the season. Having had this first one relatively fresh, I'll probably age any future bottles to let a little of the vanilla fade off. Fantastic beer."
"Solid variant of a staple brew in the craft beer scene. The vanilla beans are great on the nose, but lacking in the flavor department. Solid brew, but fell a little short."
""
"not a bad porter by any means, but for the price, and coming from stone - i was expecting way more i guess.. especially after the chipotle smoked porter!"
""
"O- Greatly balanced and exceptionally sessionable. I'm not a fan of smoke in my beer but I could drink these all day."
""
""
""
"Overall, interesting, but the sweet vanilla didn't blend well with the acidic bitter smoke to me."
"Overall: a very good beer that I would be glad to quaff over and over again. Love it!"
"This is merely an American Porter, folks. Easily scores higher than many. Such a unique beer. Would love to try the Chipotle pepper version."
""
"Overall - I'm a fan of the regular Stone Smoked Porter, but I've always felt it lacked that extra kick - the vanilla provides it here. Though the smoke is masked by it's sweetness, the overall flavor profile is a bit more interesting, in my opinion. If I were head of Stone, this would be the porter I release year 'round."
"O - Pleasant surprise from Stone and a much better showing than their chipotle pepper porter."
""
"Overall, a pretty solid beer. I can't say I enjoy it more than the non-flavored smoked porter Stone puts out, but its an interesting change. For some reason the smoke seems more acrid than in the ""traditional"" version. A touch less acrid smoke and maybe a touch of sweetness would help balance the vanilla making it more enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and rich. Very appropriate for a Porter. A little sweet but not too much. I had it with Krinerwurst, bratwust and German potato salad. The beer was an excellent complement to the meal. I would drink this again."
"Being a fan of Stone's Smoked Porter, I was thrilled to give this one a shot. At first, I could barely smell or taste the vanilla. It was extremely disappointing. But as the beer warmed a little, the vanilla started to come through - dominant in the nose, underlying in the flavor. It does seem to smooth out the taste of the Smoked Porter, but I do feel like more vanilla would be nice. It's not terribly different from the original, though I'd like to think on tap it would be creamier and the vanilla would be stronger. I will definitely give it another go then. As a bottle purchase, to pay the same for a 12oz. of this as a bomber of the regular, I'd probably just go with the regular, because this just isn't worth the extra cost. Still a really tasty beer."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 9/20/2012. Pours slightly hazy dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger dense light khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big vanilla bean, toffee, caramel, toasted malt, chocolate, cream, and light herbal. Very nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of vanilla, chocolate, caramel, toffee, roasted malt, cream, light smoke, light citrus, and earthy hops. Light bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of vanilla, toffee, caramel, chocolate, roasted malt, light smoke, and earthy spiciness. Nice balance of vanilla and roasted flavors with hop bitterness; no cloying flavors at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is a very nice vanilla porter. Nice amounts of vanilla flavor with good balance; very smooth to drink. Very enjoyable as expected."
"Superior to the standard and Chipotle versions of Smoked Porter in my opinion, but not by much. Although there isn’t a whole lot of vanilla flavor, the vanilla bean(s) seemed to have really smoothed out this beer and brought out some more chocolate flavors."
""
""
"O - Not a bad beer. The vanilla is certainly present, but in an almost candy like fashion. I do prefer the excitement that the chipotle version brings though."
"Vanilla bean has a nice impact on Stone’s Smoked Porter. I thought it might be a bit at odds with the smoky side, but it’s not really. It certainly takes a backseat to it, but it works out pretty well. I enjoyed it. Well worth picking up a bottle."
"O: a solid beer with very interesting flavored although a bit on the pricy side."
"This one was a let down. Maybe if my expectations weren't as high I would have like this beer more, but as it stands I wouldn't seek out again."
""
"Stone's Smoked Porter with Vanilla Beans pours black, with a couple ruby red highlights shining through. Almost two fingers of khaki colored foam crown the beer, before fading slowly. The head proves to be fairly sticky too, leaving lots of lacing behind. The nose has a bit each of dark chocolate and smoke. The predominant aroma though is of vanilla. I wish it was just a little bit less overpowering. Similarly, the flavor profile leads off with a nice interplay between dry, roasty, dark chocolate and a light smoke character. Straight vanilla then comes in for the back end and the finish. As much as I like vanilla, it works much better when it's supporting and contrasting with other flavors. Here the vanilla is just on its own, and it comes across as a bit cloying as it lingers on my palate. The body is on the dry side for a porter, but it works just fine. The carbonation comes off as just a little bit low though. My recollection of having prior (draft only) batch of vanilla bean aged smoked porter is of a better beer than the one in my glass tonight. I like the composite parts, but the vanilla just is not well integrated into the final product."
""
"Overall: Very good beer overall. I'm very happy that I was able to try this one. The aroma was better than the flavor, but that's not saying the flavor wasn't quite good. I really enjoyed this one and I hope they bring it back (and ship some to this part of Florida). I'd definitely recommend trying this one if you get the chance."

"M- Medium body with good carbonation."
""
"dont like this as much as the chipotle version, but its still a nice porter. it pours a lazy looking dark brown color without a whole lot of head. it smells very strongly of vanilla beans, sticky and sweet, fresh. the smoke smell and flavor is largely masked by the vanilla, which i think is a major detriment to this beer. the original is great for that robust smoke flavor, and the chipotle version really enhanced that property, but its not as evident with the vanilla, and its missing to me. flavor is good though, desserty, sweet. i wouldnt drink a bunch of these, but one is fine. might also be nice with a creamy dessert like panacotta or something. feel is good, low on carbonation but thats okay here, sturdy body, sugary finish. an excellent porter on its own, but compared to the rerular smoked porter, it seems unnecessary."
""
"This one poured with a thick, two finger, creamy tan head that took forever to dissipated. Once the head dissipated, it left lots of lacing on the pint glass. The body was a dark brown color with no visible carbonation throughout the body. The nose was smoke primarily and vanilla secondary. Generally speaking, this was a pretty mild nose. The taste started off all vanilla, which muted almost everything else. The smoke came through much later and lasted until the finish. There wasn’t enough roasted malts on the taste and way too much vanilla. The body was thick with moderate carbonation. Shockingly, the beer presented with a quick finish with vanilla. This was alright, but nothing amazing. I wouldn’t rush back to have again."
"Edit - just drank a bomber of the latest batch and the aroma was outstanding but so different i had to update my review."
"Everything's in balance with this beer, and it's a joy to drink. Just wish I got it a bit fresher. (4)"
"Overall a unique beer that is certainly worth a shot. Like the porter characteristics but the smoke and vanilla need something else to blend a little better."
""
""
""
"This is a nice, rich, complex beer. The smoked malt and vanilla are a great combination. The richness and sweetness actually add to the drinkability by playing down the bitterness. This is definitely worth a try."
"O - Excellent stuff. Love the addition of vanilla. Hopefully the Chiptole one is just as good."
""
"O-interesting but flavors not so well balanced"
""
""
"This is not as good as what I've had on tap. I've had this particular beer on tap twice, once at the brewery and once in the bay area. Both times they were consistent and had much more vanilla flavor. On tap it resembled a milk stout from the vanilla perspective, but it still had a solid porter flavor profile underneath. This is very similar, but I feel that the vanilla is just not as present, and it takes away from the overall experience. I want more vanilla damnit! Protip: A good sloshing in the mouth really brings out the creaminess and aromatics. Much more pleasurable this way, though the bitterness is still a little too harsh for this sweet-leaning beer. This makes me want to try the chipotle version since this iteration didn't meet my expectations."
""
"I've had this beer a few times in a growler from Stone. I heard they were putting it in bottles, but I just happened to see one and grabbed it. I guess I could write 250 words if I actually poured this beer out of the 12 oz bottle... It's the dark beast that you expect, but it's punching you with vanilla, and you like it!"
""
"O: This beer was tasty, and a nice new addition to Stone's line, but the vanilla beans didn't enhance the experience for me. Pick this up if you like vanilla, or really sweet beers!"
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint/tulip glass, can't find the usual bottle date. This pours a dark brown almost black color with a massive tan head. The smells are of vanilla bean, smoke, roasted malts. The feel is medium. The taste is okay, not as good as their regular porter, you have the loads of vanilla almost overdone, the smokey flavors and then some roasted malts. Not bad, but not great."
""
"I was expecting more vanilla bean in the flavor but Stone stays true to it's roots with a strong hop profile that provides bitterness and balance to the power of roasted and smoked flavors."
""
""
"The vanilla beans definitely take over the aroma and palate, but are a nice compliment to the base beer."
""
""
"Overall, this is a good beer, but I wished this had more vanilla flavor present. The smoke overrides most everything, including a very solid dark malt bill. Not bad, but could use a little tinkering."
""
""
"Overall, very nice."
""
""
""
""
"12oz. bottle served in a tulip. Pours sightly darker than cola in color and clarity with a loose, half inch, beige-colored head that quickly looses half its volume in a matter of seconds, yielding to ringlets and then finally to a soapy skim that coalesces around the shoulders. Some spots and thin strands of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose asserts a strong vanilla bean presence off the bat, albeit somewhat artificial in character, followed by a roasty/chalky cocoa quality. Taste consistent with nose; however, impressions of smoked meat are also expressed in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light and feels a tad thin with a slightly coarse, almost gassy carbonation level. I really enjoy the standard smoked porter and the vanilla definitely imparts an interesting dimension to this beer; however, it falls a part a little in the mouthfeel for me. Perhaps a little more body and a little less carbonation would improve the overall character."
""
""
""
"Well balanced for a beer that highlights the vanilla bean ingredient. Nothing groundbreaking, but very flavorful and drinkable."
""
""
""
"Overall this is an OK beer but not a great one. Vanilla is one of those flavors like clove that can easily takeover a beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An interesting beer that might not be as good out of the bottle as it has been when I've tried it on draft. Not particularly complex, but decently done."
""
""
""
"Overall no way worth 4 bucks a pop but would be worth 15 bucks a six pack easy. A very light tasty porter with vanilla flavor."
""
"The tastes very rich with a robust chocolate malt and vanilla bean mix. Truly dessert in a glass. It's great to see so much flavor without an overwhelming amount of alcohol. Very thick chewy mouthfeel. It is great how Stone kept the beer rich, but refrained from making it cloyingly sweet. I would like to see it regularly available. It would be great to show off to those who don't commonly drink craft beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good beer with nice flavors, but they're just not quite in the proportion that I'd prefer. The vanilla is particularly strong, which would be a bigger problem if it wasn't such a nice, natural vanilla flavor."
""
"O: I think this was my least favorite, though I love vanilla and I love that they made this variety. I feel like this out of the two is the one that makes you lose more of the base beer behind the added ingredient. Still a tasty beer and worth the 3 bucks."
""
""
""
"Overall: I liked this better than the chipotle version. I enjoyed both, but I'm a sucker for vanilla. Very nice."
"Worth a try for this variation on a stone classic. At times the vanilla overtakes the smoked malt on the palate but tasty just the same."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This one sounded great on paper, but the result left far more to be desired."
""
""
""
"I suppose I'll have to honestly say that I much rather prefer the original over this. It was good experimental try for Stone, but it has flavors that conflict, rather than benefit one another."
"O - An interesting twist on the smoked porter. Its good, but the original, non-vanilla added smoked porter is better"
""
""
"A nice take on a classic. The base gets lost a bit, but it's still tasty and aromatic enough to excuse that part."
""
""
"A nice tasty porter. Could use a little more of the vanilla."
""
""
""
"O: Just a miss for me.. It does have some nice qualities, but but this just isn't doing it for me. The flavors dont blend well together and its just is an average beer."
"O: good beer overall, but for $4 per 12 ounce bottle at Binny's was not really worth it. Probably won't buy again, but enjoyed my experience."
"Nice looking beer, though the head just keeps on growing off the initial pour. Guess I could have done it less aggressively. Regardless. The vanilla is a nice tone on here, but there is so much of it that it gives this very sweet tone to things that seems too pronounced to me. I salute the idea and the execution, but I think it could stand to be a bit more rounded."
""
"Medium bodied with a strong smokey, roasted malt presence up front that lingers over the sweetner notes and vanilla bean into a very dry finish.  Very robust with dark chocolate, oatmeal and burnt toast countered by toffee, lighter chocolate and hazelnut. The sweetness from the vanilla cuts the bitter roasted character with a decent amount of silky sweetness.  Good vailla flavor but is somewhat subtle letting the characteristics of the base beer shine. Was expecting more vailla but it's subtly integrated and shows most toward the finish.  Could use a little more vanilla but is still really good."
""
"Cheers..."
"O/D-The addition of the vanilla is a godsend here. The original Smoked Porter is still awesome, but this is simply an upgrade. The vanilla is delicious and really puts this one in a different class of complexity and deliciousness."
"O - It is a good beer, but nothing special. Some interesting flavors and all around well put together."
""
""
""
"O: I think that stone did a great job at labeling this beer. Will I drink it again? … I have no choice I because I got two at the store! Definitely not my first choice when it comes to porters, but I cant give it a super bad rating because I don’t feel like it is misleading at all. One thing I would have liked to taste and smell more of is coffee."
"Pours a light brownish-red that is just a tad murky and rather thin. A somewhat frothy tan head crowns the beer and recedes leaving a ton of heavy lacing. Smells of smoked malts and a ton of vanilla dominate the nose. First sip is pretty much what the aroma indicated. The smoked malts are not overly done and neither is the vanilla. There is a good balance between the two while some dark overly ripe fruits add depth and complexity. Excellent mouthfeel. Very nice indeed."

"O - I'd still put the chipotle variety at the top. Still a nice porter, but Stone's vanilla variant is the least of the 3."

"Medium body and carbonation with a smooth sensation as it goes down. Really nice overall and almost sessionable."
""
"O: This is a good beer, but it's a touch too thin for my liking. I think the addition of the vanilla beans takes away some of the smokiness of the base beer as well. Overall, I think the name of the beer is more appealing than the actual taste of the beer."

"MOREY’S BOTTOM LINE: The vanilla beans are a nice addition to an already flavorful beer. I’m not a huge fan of smoked porters (though I do enjoy them) and in my opinion, this rendition is an improvement upon the base beer. I haven’t had the chipotle version yet, but if it’s as good as this one, I’m looking forward to it! Cheers."
""
"O - Really good beer by Stone. For a standard smoked porter, it packs a good amount of flavor in a drinkable package. I like the vanilla and how it balances the smoked flavors. In the normal Stone Smoked Porter, the smoke seems a bit one note. Not the case in this. Good stuff."
""
"Overall a good idea but not a great result. The vanilla character was too much in the end, and it tastes sort of artificial when it's not blended subtly in there. Worth a try but not much else at over $3 for a 12 ounce bottle."
"O: This beer is very enjoyable with the sweetness of the vanilla combining nicely with the smokey and roasted malt flavors. Easy to drink but more of a sipping beer than a session beer."
""
"O: B+"
""
""
""
""
"O: In the new bottled vanilla vs chipotle battle, I give the round to chipotle. By no means is this a bad beer, it just isn't harmonious and I'm not in love with it like I am most of Stone's lineup."
""
"Overall: The flavors in this beer grew on me, but never got to be something I'd like to drink a lot of. Unfortunately, it sort of squanders the base beer and turns it into dessert."
""
""
"The palate opens sweet with plenty of vanilla, including a vanilla-like sweetness, coupled with the cocoa and chocolate (which have taken on more of a milk-chocolate note rather than a dark chocolate note that was present in the Chipotle version). The vanilla sweetness does also shine light on the not-so-positive fact that this beer is lighter in body than would be ideal. Mildly smoky on the finish with a moderate roast and cocoa character that is not very harmonious when paired with the intense vanilla. While the vanilla flavor is wholly natural, it is not terribly enjoyable IMO"
""
""
""
"This beer suffers by being compared to Captain Lawrence Smoked Porter, and by comparison to the other, many superior porters blessedly easy to obtain now."
"Taste-Smoky, spicy,laced with a pleasant little counter-balance of vanilla that takes the edge off of the smoky/spiciness. Has a sessionable, smooth quality that the other Stone Smoked Porters don't seem to have. Very flavorfull. I could have a few of these easily. Well done."
"Enjoying this brew, but, don' t see myself purchasing more of this one."
""
""
"Overall this brew grows on you as it warms and its multitude of flavors presents itself. Smoked porters are not for everyone and one with vanilla is even a bit more complex and i suspect folks will not like it. Give it a shot if you are open to a wide range of flavors."
"O- Never sampling Stone's Smoked Porter prior to this review, I was not sure what to expect. However, I can only imagine the standard release features the smoked malt more than the version with vanilla beans, as it seems to dominate the aroma and taste. By no means is it a sub-par brew, Stone would just need to up-the-ante with regards to the smoked malt to bring it some balance. Overall, very nice and hope they not only make this a year-round but hope they add more smoked malt to the recipe to offset the vanilla component."
"Pours black but when held up to light reveals a red tint. For a dark beer there is nothing hiding in it - a typical clean and clear Stone brew. Decent head and produces some lacing on a clean glass. Smell to be expected is chocolate and vanilla. The vanilla almost eliminates the smokiness of this porter and is an interesting but good change of pace from the standard porter. Good for a summer time porter."
""

"O - I really enjoy their smoked porter, I also really like good vanilla beers. This one is a blending but I feel I should have liked this more. I had it on draft earlier this year and was underwelmed. Sadly, it is only marginally better in the bottle. Worth trying, and enjoyable. Not sure how often I would reach for it given its $5 price tag even if it was available year round."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style with carbonation being about average. Overall, I really liked how well the vanilla complimented the roasted malts. As for the smoke though, I have the same problem I have with the regular version of the beer in that the smoke is way too reserved and barely noticeable. I love smoked beers, but every time I drink a Stone version I end up disappointed in the lack of smokiness. It was a very good beer that might have been great with a little more smoke."
"O: Overall, not bad. Very mellow to what i was expecting. The vanilla takes a pretty big back seat to everything else, but just noticeable."
"Overall the experience was underwhelming. I love vanilla but this just did not work for me. It did improve as it warmed but alas too late for any major improvements."

"O- The nice mellow smoke compliments the good vanilla flavor but the nougat notes take on a bit of a plastic quality when it opens."
"O: This beer is just one big ""feh"" from me. The vanilla isn't too well integrated, and it majorly detracts from an otherwise solidly good porter. The chipotle version seems to be far more up my alley; so I'll have to try that one out. As for this one? Give it a miss."
""
"Overall: The flavors in this beer to not meld together - they compete with one another with the vanilla up front and the char (rather than smoke) in the back; would be a very nice vanilla porter if the smoke was excluded but as a smoked porter, the original is much better"
"Medium body, a bit heavily carbonated for a porter, with aggressive prickly bubbles. Pretty good beer, one of the smoked porters I've enjoyed."
"Overall, the best of the two brews of Smoked Porter Stone made (IMO). The vanilla beans make an excellent combination and I will definitely have it again. Will definitely look for it the next time I buy beer."

"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clearish dark brown color with about a half inch tan head. Head retention is decent, and there's a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like roasted malt, vanilla, chocolate, and some light smoke. It tastes like roasted malt, smoke, vanilla, chocolate, and a bit of coconut. I think the vanilla overpowered the smoke in the aroma, but meshed well with the smoky flavor of the beer. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick with good carbonation. I think this is a good brew, it's definitely worth trying. I like this version better than the Chipotle one, but I still prefer the original Smoked Porter. $3.99 a bottle."
""
"Neat on kind of a novelty level. Don't know whether I'd want a whole bottle normally."
"I have tried many porters, and this is average. There could be improvements: the vanilla could enhance the finish and smell, but it doesn't work out with this beer."
""
"Overall, this is an enjoyable beer, but I still enjoy the Smoked Porter more."
"EDIT: After trying this side-by-side with the chipotle smoked porter (which I preferred), the vanilla was a bit more evident."
""
""
""

"D - Very drinkable. The vanilla really accentuates the smoke and chocolate flavors nicely. Excellent balance."
""
""
""
""
"EDIT: So, I'm having another one right now and it is much smokier than the last one I had. Still smells very vanilla and the flavor has a lot of vanilla but the original smokey characteristics of the Smoked Porter stick out a LOT more than before. Still delicious and much more unique than just vanilla bean. Thank you AJ's for having some in Tucson."

"Pours black with reddish-brown edges and a very dense khaki-colored head that looks like the foam on a cappuccino. Aroma consists of sweet chocolate malt, bitter coffee grounds, a touch of caramel, lightly charred smoke, and sweet vanilla bean. Really liking the interplay between the vanilla and the smoke. Taste is similarly sweet, with lots of vanilla bean, chocolate malt, caramel, and roasted nuts. Mouthfeel is quite smooth and fairly creamy, with a medium-full body and good carbonation. Overall a superb addition to the Stone line-up, but I may have to give the edge to regular Smoked Porter. I'll see how the Chipotle version stacks up."
"This is just not very good, and that's a shame given how great it was on tap. Avoid the bottles."

"M&D - a deep character beer, plenty of style appropriate elements, layered vanilla flavors, smooth and easyto drink. another winner from Stone."
"Overall - Tasty, and enjoyed the vanilla moreso then the pepper version. This is a straight up dessert beer, sweet, creamy and rich. Till orginal smoked porter is the best, but this is #2 for me. Good stuff here."
""
"Medium body and carbonation; slightly smooth and creamy, but still pretty active mouthfeel. Lingering bitterness in the aftertaste. Will appeal to vanilla fans who don't mind a bit of a bitter bite."
""
""
"Pours a deep amber to black in color with an off white head. In the aroma, sweet vanilla, coffee, and even notes of cinnamon. In the taste, sweet vanilla, a coffee roast, and it feels a bit creamy. A small bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry to sweet vanilla and cream like aftertaste. Big vanilla, coffee and cinnamon. Tasty, but I can see this getting to be a bit too sweet at times."
""
"Overal- I honestly failed to spot the vanilla in this. It was so weak and overpowered with smokyness that it didn't really wasn't even that noticeable."
"O: Despite everything there is something about this beer that I don’t love. It’s not a bad beverage, and I’d drink it again if it was handed to me, but I think I prefer the original to this one."
"This one is a bit better than the regular. The vanilla really works to smooth out the rough edges created by the smoke and roast and the feel fits the style a touch better also. The addition definitely worked here."
""
""
""
"Love regular Stone Smoked Porter, this iteration is fantastic as well. The Chipotle version is very nice and complex but not quite as good as the vanilla is, in my opinion. Upon a second visit (bottle) this beer still impresses me, though not quite as much as the initial bottle I had. Maybe I was a little too excited at the bottling of a beer I'd seeked our for some time. Either way, still a great beer and worth trying if you like porters, smoke, or Stone Smoked Porter."
""
""
""
"Overall it's still a very tasty porter, with a great feel more than anything, however I prefer the Chipotle version with its emphasis on bringing out the roast and smoke of the porter considerably more. A decent brew regardless."
""
""
""
"As long as the pricing is solid on this, I'll grab another bottle or two. I can imagine a draft version being nice, too."
"O: Not a bad brew, but the smoke far dominates everything in the beer. The vanilla is nice and sweet and tries to balance but in the end it's all char and smoke. The chipotle version I had the other day wasn't quite as smokey and was much better balanced and tasty."
"O: An alright beer, overall. Not undrinkable, but the vanilla is too strong and artificial tasting, and it clashes with the roasted malt characters."
"O - Pretty good, but I don't have much desire to have it again. I wish the vanilla were a bit more subtle."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a dark cola brown with a small tan that has head decent retention and leaves lots of small spots of lacing on the glass. The aroma is vanilla. Lots of sweet vanilla and a bit of coffee and cocoa. The initial taste is sweet with a lot of vanilla, a bit of coffee, a little bit of chocolate, and more vanilla. Finish has lingering vanilla. Medium body. Low carbonation. Vanilla just overpowers everything here and comes off as way too sweet. Disappointing."
"Although the vanilla provides a soothing effect to the otherwise masculine porter, the mouthfeel keeps me yearning for an imperial version of this beer. But its effortless palate and high rate of drinkability more than make up for it."
""
"O: An oddly likeable, easy to drink porter."
""
"O - Overall I really liked this beer. Like it a bit more than the draft version, which I think suffered in the nose factor. Lovers of vanilla should seek this one out."
""
"Overall, flavor of the vanilla is much more dominant than the smoke character. Good base porter, but I would've liked more balance in the smoke and vanilla characters."
"O- I had to hustle around town to get a few bottles and then hit the mother load at a local shop. My time was well spent in looking for these bottles. The vanilla is well incorporated into a classic smoked beer. Nice job Stones."
""
"O: Was looking forward to this one, and it was just ok."
"Overall, I find this quite good, but you should expect a good bit of vanilla."
"Grade: B+ (definitely try)"
""
"O: Call me weird, but I don't really care much for Stone, but this is a solid dessert beer. Definitely worth a shot."
""
"Overall really a dissapointment. Tasted very watery. I mean not bad... but really nothing spectacular."
"O - Vanilla and very smokey. Almost fished out here?"
""
""
"i did not care for this as much as the chipotle, i felt it was a bit rougher around the edges."
""
""
""
""
"This was a very nice treat. I might prefer it to regular smoked porter. Then again they're both great, so I can love them both equally, I guess."
"Palate: Lots of natural and tasty vanilla flavor, along with a present but nicely integrated smokiness. Roasted malt, a touch of cigar and coffee. The body is medium verging on light. Carbonation is at a lower-medium level. Vanilla lingers, but the finish dries up nicely without being particularly bitter. This is a really enjoyable take on an already good beer."
"O- This is a pleasant smoked beer that would be a good entry brew for someone new to smoke beer. Subtle smoke flavor with notes of vanilla, coffee, and cocao. Enjoy after dinner with creme brule. This makes me want to try the chipotle pepper version...maybe."
"Very dark chestnut color with a lovely, thick, creamy head that lasts awhile and leaves some drippy lace. Mild smoky dark roast aroma with a dusting of vanilla beaniness that seems to meld well with the other characteristics. A bit more vanilla creaminess upfront in the flavor...dark malt, bitter coffee, a little chocolate. Some sweetness, but quickly overpowered by a roasty bitterness. Pretty smooth, though drying. I like this, but it was more impressive on tap."
""
"Overall I really like this, I couldn't knock down a case in a night, but I could happily have one every night for 24 days."
"Overall, a huge improvement over the base beer in my opinion. The vanilla is definitely strong but provides a nice flavor and tempers the char and smoke of the base beer perfectly. A really enjoyable vanilla porter."
""
""
"Pours black with a good solid quilt of tan foam and nice lace resides along the glass. Lots of vanilla up front in the nose, smoke is reserved and plays tertiary fiddle to the beans and malts of chocolate and raw wood. Flavor is initially vanilla, then smoky (overly dry smoky sans flavor) then chocolate and dark portered malts then followed back up with more vanilla - this time with a vengeance. The vanilla is nice. There is a bitterness in the mid point that is not really justified or enjoyable to me - just strait bitterness like aspirin. Medium on heavy for the style with moderate carb and a semi dry finish. Meh, one and done for me."
""
""
""
"I've been on a quest to find beer with vanilla tones so was excited to find this on the shelf. However, there was a bit of reluctance as I'm not big on smoked beers ... certainly willing to try though! The vanilla taste is beautiful ... not too strong but certainly there. Nice sweetness overall. A good beer. However, the roasted, smokey flavor detracts from the experience, and it seems to be somewhat watery ... like it needs a bit more malt to enrich the flavor and give it depth."
"Best application would be as a dessert beer, for example with a decadent chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream, so sounds pretty damn good actually."
"O: Pretty good, one dimensional but nice, and a welcome combination of smoke & vanilla."
"Very smoothe a good blend of smokey and sweet. Stone strikes again"
"O: so glad to see this in a bottle - Stone has produced a really nice, quality beer"
""

"At hay merchant in houston on cask served in a tulip. One finger of creamy light khaki head sits on the rootbeer colored brew. Sheets of lace all the way down the glass as expected with a thin ring on top. The nose is very smoky, earthy tones with a little vanilla presence not strong in the nose. The taste is again a strong smoke, a little black pepper, chocolate malt much more vanilla slightly dry and bitter finish with light hops. No alcohol is present and this beer is very creamy and full bodied while being extremely easy to drink. Overall I would have preferred it not be on cask but beggers can't be choosers. Solid craftsman ship from stone, I like the vanilla and smokey balance with a little chocolate malt compliment to set it off. The gargoyle please once again, drink it."
""
"Overall, this was OK and I'm glad I tried it, but it fell short of expectations."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Its a good vanilla beer and a good smoke beer, but nothing over the top. I was wanting this beer to have a bigger body that was a bit chewier with a stronger vanilla presence. I still enjoyed the beer and would drink it again, but I was a bit dissapointed after being really blown away by Stone Russian Imperial Stout."
""
"Overall this was really good. Enjoyable levels of smoke but the vanilla really pops and blends it all together perfectly. Very enjoyable."
""
"Poures a roasted nut brown with a thinner somewhat creamy off white head atop,the color seems to be a bit lighter than an avergae porter.Aromas are smoked and somewhat earthy with the vanilla pretty faint and in the background.The vanilla flavors are more pronounced on the palate intermingling nicely with the dryer,lighter earthy/smoked flavors.A fuller creamy feel is nice but I have to admit I was expecting a little more from this beer,I would have liked more vanilla in the aromas and a little more smoke on the palate.In saying that it's still pretty damn good,Stone is held in real high regard from me."
"O: A bit too thin, a bit too bitter for the vanilla. Decent but not great."
"O: I enjoyed this one the most out of the three versions of the smoked porter I tried. I do think though, this version could have used less smoke."
"Overall I wasn't sure what to expect from this one, but I was pleasantly surprised. Not a huge fan of ""flavored"" beers, but this one worked."
""
""
""
"D/O: Mission accomplished. This beer could be recognized as being vanilla-infused from low Earth orbit. Before it is recruited to serve a dessert beer function, double-check the bitterness level. It may come equipped with vanilla, but Southern Tier Creme Brulee it isn't."
"Lots of roasted barley and bitterness, with some smoke and vanilla. I like it, just wish there was more vanilla to even things out. Still a really good beer."
""
""
"O: Do BAs really love vanilla or something? Why is this scoring higher than the Chipotle version? It's mystifying. I wasn't terribly impressed."
""
"O - This beer is delicious. I don't drink porters or stouts often, but this one is by far one of the best I've tried. I am really glad Stone came out with this one; they never disappoint."
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a very dark orange brown. Thin very light tan head that dissipates slowly to a ring around the glass. Aroma of roasted malt and coffee with a hint of vanilla. Flavor starts with nuts and roasted malt, then light smoke and hops finishing nutty and roasted. Leaves a pleasant lingering slightly smokey vanilla and roasted malt aftertaste. Medium bodied. The smoke flavor is rather subdued in this porter compared to others I've tried, but is compensated by the complexity of flavors and a unique flavor progression."
""
"O: Meh. It's ok."
""
"Its not a bad beer, but its not balanced enough to recommend if you like vanilla porters, and a definite difference from other Stone beers."
"O- For a smoked porter this beer was very good. Probably the best smoked porter I've ever had. I definitely enjoyed the on-draft version a lot more (I thought it was better in pretty much every category), but I'm definitely glad they started bottling this. Props again to Stone for making very good beers they can mass produce- not an easy thing to do. For $3.99/bottle I definitely recommend picking a few up."
""
""
"12oz bottle $3.99. Picked up the chipotle so I figured I might as well get the vanilla for comparison. This is truly a vanilla beer. It doesn't really taste sweet but the vanilla flavor almost completely overpowers the porter. The aroma was straight vanilla beans. The flavor was so much vanilla I thought I was drinking a cola. Not bad but not something I would ever purchase again."
"Pours a dark brown with a one and a half finger off-white head. Not surprisingly roasted smoky malt and vanilla on the nose. The vanilla hits my tongue almost immediately and then is joined by a hint of dark espresso and roasted malt, all swirl together for a balanced finish that has just a bit of bitterness with the vanilla lingering immediately however the smoke outlasts the vanilla. Pleasantly medium-bodied, perfect level of carbonation, slick with a creamy edge. A nice variation of an excellent brew."
""
"I wanted to emulate this at one point. A cousin of mine actually tried with a standard porter and vanilla bean. Still, nothing can touch Stone."
""
""
"Overall: Lots going on in this porter. If you like smokey flavors, vanilla, or both, give this a try."
"Vanilla bomb with some nice smoked and roast malts hanging around. Almost reminds of some funky Creme Brulee."
"O: an awesome, drinkable, desert beer, I could see making a beer float with this and vanilla ice cream being awesome. Between this or the chipotle, I would deffinatly take this one. I just love the way the smoke and vanilla work together here."
""
"Very, very good brew. Definitely give it a try if you can. Cheers!"
"Nicely done. A porter that has a touch of interest and at the very least makes itself stand out from the mundane and regular offerings in it's style."
""
"Pours a solid dark brown with brilliant garnet highlights and a huge fluffy mocha head that persists forever. smells of caramel, chocolate, smoke and vanilla mostly with little to no hop aroma easily sniffed. The taste is a nice mix of chocolate smoke caramel and vanilla. The smoke and vanilla duke it out for top billing and ultimately the vanilla wins. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet creamy almost syrupy mouthfeel. I'm glad I got to try this, but I think the vanilla is a bit over the top and competes with the other flavors rather than enhancing them."

"I have now had the pleasure to have both vanilla bean and chipotle pepper smoked porter (Had the chipotle at a Stone brunch with Koch.) While not a huge fan of porters this is a pretty good beer. Nothing I would buy again but worth a try."
"Had on tap at Max's, pours a nice cloudy brown color. Smell is of faint vanilla, tannish head to it. Great creamy mouthfeel, well balanced with tons of roasted maltiness and a present, but subtle vanilla undertone. Finishes clean and smooth. Very flavorful porter, Stone shines through once again, one of the best beers I had at the bar all night."

"O - I find that my preference isn't toward porters in general. I believe it's got something to do with that light body (all about the RIS's). I don't prefer smoked beers even more. With that said, Stone got this one right. I can appreciate this one. May even purchase it again sometime to experience the interesting blend of stages of the flavors."

"The chocolate/vanilla combo is nice (reminds me of Aphrodisiaque) but the great smokiness from the regular version is obliterated, this variation is on the sweeter side."
""
"Pours a clear dark brown with a tan head that settles to an oily film. No lacing on this one. Smell is of smoked malt, nutty aromas, and slight vanilla bean. Taste is of smoked malt and smoked meat with a very subtle vanilla note on the finish. This beer has a low level of carbonation and is somewhat flat. Overall, this is a pretty average beer that I was expecting much more from. The vanilla beans are very hard to locate in both the aroma and flavor of this beer."

"This was on tap at the local shop and pours a beautiful dark color with a creamy head. Great head retention and lacing. I could smell the vanilla right off the bat and it has the best vanilla flavor i have ever seen in a beer. It mixes well with the dark malts with flavors found in the original Smoked Porter. Coffee and chocolate are the main flavors I take away from this one. Over all i think this is a great beer and I'll be getting this one again."

"Overall I really enjoyed this beer which I was surprised about. I hate smoke beer and only agreed to try this because someone I trust recommended it to me. The vanilla almost completely changes this beer from the original to the point where if I tasted them side by side I would never think they were the same base beer. Nice to sample and would have more often if it was commercially made. Recommended if you can find it."
"Interesting, but the vanilla is a little too much. I'd recommend it to anyone with a serious sweet tooth and love of vanilla though."
"Overall: An improvement upon an already good beer."
"O – Do I like this more than the standard SP, maybe… Just the addition of the vanilla makes it a little more complex and adds something really nice. Would be nice if they Bourbon Barrel Aged this version and then bottles it and added it to the 500ml series."
"Overall I felt that this was an awesome example of what vanilla can do for a beer."
"Notes: Glad that I got to try this one, my first “Vanilla Bean” beer."
"O: The beer is rather easy to drink because the alcohol is well hidden and the sweetness and vanilla flavors are balanced enough from being overpowering."
"d - A pretty easy drinking vanilla smoked porter. This was one of the surprises of the night for me. I thought it smelt and tasted great, though I didn't get a whole lot of smoke thanks to the vanilla. Would definitely try again."
"O- I really enjoyed this one, so much that I ordered a second."
"Overall impression: Nicely done. The smoke and vanilla provide nice accents and don't over-power the beer. I appreciated how subdued they could be and still highlight the amazing quality and drinkability of this beer. Well done."
"O- This beer tasted like if a vanilla bean and lavender air freshener made love in a field of flowers. Where are the roasty notes, coffee, and chocolate? This one just did not do it for me."
"O - I really wished this would've been served warmer. I spent a third of the glass really thinking Stone missed the mark. After it warmed up I really began to enjoy it."
"O - This is a fantastic idea for a beer, and I kept on drinking it through the night after my initial tasting notes. Very easy to drink, and easy to tuck into a whole 2-liter growler full of the stuff. Although the smokiness is gone, and I agree with other folks on here that maybe they should take the word ""smoked"" off of the beer, but I also understand that this is one of their special editions, so I can't base it truly to the original. I enjoyed drinking this one and am likely to get another fill next time its available."
"Overall: Really good beer but all the orginal version is missing. Is that a bad thing no but I was hoping that the vanilla would blend better with the smoke instead of just hiding it."
"A wonderful base beer made much, much better by the vanilla bean and cask."
"T: Lots of vanilla upfront, but luckily it doesn't taste very artificial. Roasted malt and coffee with a good amount of smokiness towards the finish. Lots of dark roasted coffee on the finish."
"Overall this beer is excellent. Although it'd make sense if they just took the ""Smoked"" out of the title because there just is not enough smoke to stand up to the vanilla and I wish there was. But the beer is very good and a very easy drink. Especially on cask."
"Stone porter with Vanilla bean, poured black with a decent size white head. The smell was similar to that of a urnal cake, and was rather offesnive. The taste was full of vinilla. Very little porter like taste, just alot of vanilla. Very strong flavor, good carbonation. Overall a very unquie beer, STRONG overpowering vanilla flavors, if you dont LOVE vanilla you will not like this beer, luckly for me I do."
"This is a great porter. The vanilla smooths things out and makes this even more drinkable than the normal stone smoked porter"
"O: Top porters for sure. Great beer for any special occasion."
"O: Not as thick as I would like for the style"
"Thanks to Tieman for this! Poured from a growler into my Duvel tulip (which I later broke). Very dark, almost black, with a cherry cola colored bottom 1/4 of the glass. About 2 fingers of off white head. Sticky sticky lacing and pretty nice head retention. Vanilla blast up the nose plus coffee. Almost like an iced vanilla latte. LOVE. A little sweet milk chocolate. Bright bitter coffee flavor up front, a little vanilla in the middle. Not nearly as much as on the nose. A surprising amount of burnt bitterness on the finish. Very drying, with very small prickly bubbles. Great beer."
"10/18/2012-had a 12 oz bottle and it was just as tasty as it was last year; it seemed very mellow with nice, rich roasted coffee and vanilla beans that trailed off with a slight bitterness. The low ABV makes this so easy to drink while remaining packed with flavor. I liked it so much that I'm pushing the flavor rating up to 4.5."
"I'm not a fan of vanilla in my beer. However, I did hope for more with this beer. I wanted the vanilla to more subtle and compliment the smoke and roasted malt I enjoy in the reuglar porter. As my friend said ""It was an experience."" It just wasn't a very good one."
"Wow super strong smell with the vanilla beans it almost takes over all the other smells, I personally really enjoy it though. Taste follows the nose really strong vanilla flavor, really good, pretty rich though. Overall I liked this a lot and would get it again. I could see if someone didn't like this though because I can see it getting overwhelming after a whole glass."
"Overall, a nice twist on the Stone Smoked Porter. More enjoyable than the regular."
"Draught. The beer pours a dark brown to black color with a tannish head. I get a lot of smoke, chocolate, roasted malt and vanilla in the aroma. I also get a tad bit of oaked notes. The flavor is more of the same. The chocolate and vanilla are the dominant flavors, with the smoke hiding in the background. I also get a little oak and whiskey notes behind the other aspects of the flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice, overall."
"O - To me this version tastes way better than the regular Smoked Porter which in turn makes me want to drink it again worth getting if you ever see it"
"Overall- In my eyes, this is a world-class porter. What I'm bothered about is that the Vanilla Bean is so huge while I could hardly tell it was a smoked porter... How smooth and creamy it was, it could have fooled me for a Fruit Beer. This is beer #6 for me when it comes to Stone (Arrogant Bastard, Pale Ale, Ruination, Levitation, Sublimely Self-Righteous) and so far is my favorite! My journey continues..."
"Poured a ruby black color, with some decent light brown foam on top. Aromas of smoke, roasted malt and dark chocolate (not a whole lot of vanilla). Some dark fruits on the palate, maybe cherries, figs and plums, vanilla extract, and a little smoke."
"A very black liquid sits in my glass with a fingers worth of tan head. Slight roast on the nose with very sweet vanilla. Sounded tasty when I ordered it. Mouth was kinda thin for me and not a lot of carbonation. I like vanilla, love it in fact but this tasted like cheap vanilla extract dumped into my beer. It was flat out gross. I can't get around the awful cheap taste and aftertaste in my mouth. I had to dock points for that. Another swing and a miss from Stone for me."
"There's no reason I wouldn't drink a few of these in a sitting, though I couldn't down them all too quickly. This is a great effort at a smoked beer."
"-GFunk"
"O (D) - Very tasty, nice complexity, definitely a great beer. Nothing is too powerful, very drinkable."
"Finish: Vanilla bean sticks around with a little roosted malt"
"Low carbonation was definitely hoping for a thicker mouthfeel. Definitely enjoyed this brew though and my wife loved it -which is a hard sell since she doesn't like too many. Would like to try again as it is a great porter treatment."
"Drink it all day long, yeah. Really delish"
"L- did I mention I love the vanilla?"
"I really wish the vanilla was more prominent here. This doesn't really do much more for me than the regular smoked porter. Just too subtle and it left me wanting more vanilla. By no means a bad beer however."
"D - Very nice, the smoke and vanilla combine nicely with the dark, sugary malt. It is a bit too sugary for my taste however and I really can't imagine drinking more than one in a sitting."
"M - Cedar backend. Touch bitter. Semi-dry finish."
"Drinkable and complex. Nice combination."
"I like the beer, tastes good, however I am a bit disappointed that the smoke was so overpowered by the vanilla. Good but much better smoked porters out there."
"D: While I liked the vanilla flavor at first, a pint of this at the bar was just too much to fully enjoy. The sweetness in this one developed into a very cloying taste during the second half of the beer, and I had some trouble finishing it after the novelty wore off. If I see this again, maybe I'll just ask for a sample of it... it would keep me wishing for more, but definitely wouldn't lead to disappointment."
"D-balanced and rich. not too smokey to the point all other flavors are overpowered but present enough to make a statement. the vanilla beans adds some awesome richness to create a desert like chocolate cake finish."
"D - This was a fantastic beer, I was pleasantly surprised and drank it quite easily. Would love to have it again."
"D: Drinkability is OK... it's good and interesting, but a little too sweet to for my taste."
"This was a nice after dinner treat"
"D - Fantastic for the style. One is plenty for me but it went down very quickly."
"Drinkability is high for this dessert of a beer. Incredibly well-crafted. Highly recommended."
"drinkability - great complexity, highly flavorful, nice dash of smokiness, very exception for the style"
"Drinkability: It has been a while since I have had the regular Smoked Porter, so a side-by-side comparison is not really possible. Overall this was nice, although I switched to something else after one glass."
"D - Too good. Glad I have 2L of this beer. I will have to save some for Tomorrow so I can do a beer float."
"D: The beer is rather enjoyable and decently drinkable. It is somewhat smooth and the vanilla really helps with the drinkability."
"Drinkability -- In my mind, this is a nice improvement over the base beer. The vanilla bean addition does well in tempering the smoke character making the beer much more drinkable. I've got to hand it to stone for consistently bettering their beers with these 'special versions'. Always complimentary, never distracting. Good on 'ya, Stone."
"D/O- Good one and done beer. Not sure if I could handle anymore than that. Glad to have tried it though."
"Drinkability is good with low abv, no sticky or syrupy flavors, smooth and creamy demeanor."
"D- Ive had this beer on several occasions and always enjoy it. It is a nice treat for sure. I'm not putting down alot of these in on sitting, but always welcome a pint. Hands down the best vanilla beer I've ever had. Easy to imagine how good this would go with dessert or even a scoop of ice cream dropped in there."
"Mid level body and clear, crisp drinking. I enjoyed this far better than the regular variety, which I've never been a huge fan of."
"This is a medium to light bodied brew with a moderate level of carbonation. Overall it is quite drinkable but maybe just a bit more forward sweetness or vanilla flavoring would really drive this one home in the drinkability department. The smell of this brew was a bit deceiving, it made me anticipate quite a sweet vanilla profile which was not as forward or bold as the nose led on. Regardless it was well done and I would have it again."
"The body's lighter for a porter, certainly manageable. Able to enjoy this with a full plate no problem."
"Drinkability: Goes down easy."
"poured a very dark brown with brown highlights that had a hlaf finger of head and left a little lacing sticking to the glass. the aroma was very nice consisting of chocolate, vanilla, slight smokiness, and a faint coffee notes. like the nose chocolate and vanilla dominate the palate with cocoa and slight smokey accents with a touch of coffee at the end. the brew was medium in body with a moderate amount of carbonation which had a sweet, smokey, slight astringent, and creamy finish. it drank very good and was very tasty. I'm glad I had the chance to have this one again."
"Had at the Stone Tap Takeover in Charlotte. Served from tap into a tumbler. Poured dark dark brown with a minimal off-white head. There was no lacing evident throughout. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, vanilla, and subtle hop. The flavor was of roasted malt, vanilla bean, and a slight hop hint. It had a medium feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a nice enjoyable brew. I really liked the vanilla aspect to it. The hop note on the followthrough was quite nice and seemed to tie the vanilla bean into a nicely balanced brew."
"Drinkability: Smooth, pleasant, and without any hard edges. Just as the standard iteration gives you just enough smoke character, so, too, does this give you just enough vanilla."
"D- A rare and delicious treat get it whenever possible."
"d - A pretty easy drinking vanilla smoked porter. This was one of the surprises of the night for me. I thought it smelt and tasted great, though I didn't get a whole lot of smoke thanks to the vanilla. Would definitely try again."
"Pours near black and has very little head or lacing. Perhaps a bit more in that department than the chipotle version. Nose is strong, strong vanilla. That's about is as nearly all the smoke and roast are overwhelmed. Taste is similarly unbalanced, although I won't complain, as it is quite a nice flavor. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. Drinks fairly well. Nice and refreshing....would be a great dessert beer."
"VANILLA also wins in the palate, the beer is good and medium to light in body, easy to drink to an extent but the vanilla makes the beer VERY vanilla-y and really sweet too. Side by side with the other two, this one loses the threeway. I probably wouldn't drink it again but it was fun to have once."
"Overall, this was my favorite beer of the night. I love Smoked Porter to begin with but its amazing how a small ingredient addition can do so much to improve something that's already insanely good! I loved this beer and will get it again if I get the opportunity."
"D- I like how it's 5.9%, that way I can have another, and another. I rather liked this one."
"deep brown in color with frothy dense head. Some light roased coffee notes with rich vanilla. Creamy and chocolatey. Mostly the taste of vanilla and some coffee bitterness. Incredibly velvety smooth mouthfeel. One of the things that really stood out among the complex flavors."
"A great balanced beer. The vanilla is really nice, best vanilla I've had since dl vanilla bean, the smokiness finishes this in the best way."
"Great porter, almost a stout and the vanilla is awesome."
"D - overall, very enjoyable - one of Stone best non-hoppy offerings. great dessert beer, or a nice compliment to a number of foods. might be hard to drink more than a couple though."
"Totally loses the smoke, which for me was no bad thing. Maybe a bit too candy sweet, but very tasty."
"Super creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Almost velvety. Drinkability is good. Definately a sessionable beer."
"D- super flavorful with a very approachable abv. Good stuff."
"Pours a deep, rich dark brown, letting some light through, no head. Scent is of muted vanilla bean and light roast and char from the smoke. Taste brings a wonderful blend of the vanilla and smoke with notes of roasted coffee, sweet cream and a touch of sugar, almost like a well concocted coffe drink. Medium bodied, feels lighter as it sits, semi dry feeling and no lingering smokey aftertaste. A wonderful brew that i could drink all night."
"This may be the best porter I've ever had."
"Great easy drinking creamy satisfying beer. Light smoke with more roasted malts coming through then a dry lingering vanilla shows from the mid palate long into the drying finish. Not overly complex bur easy on the palate and liver."
"D: A great beer. A don't want to call this a novelty beer, but its a bit whacked out in the sense of the typical porter. However, it all works. The vanilla is very apparent, in both the nose and the flavor, much more than I was expecting. But it is the lack of sweetness and the light backbone of roasted malts make this beer feel a bit more ""serious," allowing the vanilla to be center stage while not tasting like vanilla ice cream. For me, it was easily drinkable, and while I enjoyed it while eating nachos and a burger, I think it would be an even better dessert beer."
"D: here is a nice complex brew with an interesting aspect in the vanilla bean... the overall product is tasty and drinkable, but it could be better balanced"
"A nice drinker for sure, but I expected more punch here, I prefer the feel of porters from the good Midwest brewers, Tyranena and Founders to name a couple. I will try the regular smoked porter, but I will probably stick with their more hoppy beers which they are known for."
"D-Wow, this is one great beer. Really easy drinking, but nice and complex without being in your face about it. Probably my favorite out of three Stone beers I tried at this event."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have this again and recommend this to those who seek a solid porter with a vanilla twist and coffee undertones."
"On cask at The Daily Pint in Santa Monica. Poured into a Duvel tulip (for some reason). Dark clear brown with a huge fluffy cocoa head that sticks around forever. Big vanilla bean aroma with some roasted malt character. In the flavor, the roles are reversed. Roasted malt takes the center stage and the vanilla beans add a noticeable but subtle even sweetness. Just a touch of smoke/charcoal in the end. Nice dry and bitter finish. Very easy to drink, low carb due to it being on cask. Really complex and flavorful for 5.9%."
"Drinkability- Probably the best beer I've ever had with vanilla. Usually the vanilla is either too potent or too fake. This is neither. Yes, the vanilla does take over a bit but it's not too much. Amazing how one ingredient can change a brew so much. Thanks much Mike!"
"Pours a dark black body, with a small creamy off-white head, diminishing. Smoke on a full whiff. Robust aroma, coffee, and some vanilla and chocolate. Enticing combo of flavors. Chocolate, coffee taste, some smoke aftertaste. Vanilla present too. The vanilla and the smoke are in opposites, doesn't quite work for me."
"At just under 6%abv, this is a very drinkable beer. Very tasty and smooth with a great balance."
"If you like vanilla highlights, this is a beer you have to try."
"D - Good overall, but would recommend other robust porters over this one."
"This is one exceptional brew...considering you are drinking it, it's probably getting poured from other means than a bottle. This pour dark with a tannish head which stays thin as you sip. It goes down like a guiness but much more drinkable. Great taste and feel in the mouth but not too filling. This lasted all but a week in the local pub. Happens every time. Although stone is know as being arrogant, this brew is know for being universal."
"Drinkability: I personally love vanilla and therefore loved the taste of this beer. If you do as well, then you'd probably really enjoy it as well. I wish I could have this more frequently / growler fill it, since while the rating won't look amazing as a composite, I'd love to have a few friends try it as well. Definitely worth the shot."
"drinkability: it's an awesome porter from Stone and easy to drink. Kind of dissapointed on the lack of vanilla taste however. Will definatly have again if the opportunity arises"
"D: Very drinkable, but I would say that of any style Porters cask condition the best. Very nice!"
"D - Quite drinkable. Alcohol is on the low side, making this somewhat sessionable. Mouthfeel and flavors are smooth. I would describe this as a nice, relaxing beer. Just want to sit back in a comfortable chair and enjoy several of these."
"Very drinkable and enjoyable. A successful experiment from Stone."
"Stone does good work, but this is the first beer I've had of theirs that really lives up to the hype. Can't wait to try it again!"
"Milk chocolate flavors upfront, vanilla blasts on the tongue, toast, fudge cake, very light smoke in the finish, dark roasted malts, chocolate malts, truly a dessert beer. Low carbonation and a little thin in the finish but that makes this one pretty easy to drink and keeps it from being to cloying. Nice beer overall."
"Not sure if they still make this. The owner of Blue Palms said he had it aging for a couple of years."
"M - Thinner bodied, light carbonation."
"D: I could drink this all day."
"Overall, probably the best porter I've ever had. Came from a cask, so that probably brings things up a notch. I'm going back for more before they run out."
"Serving type: growler"
"Drinkability: Intensely, intensely drinkable. I quaffed mine with some ribs and I could have been drinking a non-alcoholic drink as far as I could tell. The vanilla just turns it into a sweet affair."
"The first cask beer I am yet to try, and I sure as hell like what it did to the texture. Appearance and smell were both good, but nothing that stood out to me. It was difficult for me to smell the vanilla, but then again, we were in a crowded bar. Taste was seriously good. Plenty of vanilla up front, good vanilla, though, with the word ""bean"" attached to it, not ""Dreyer's", and mix that with slightly bitter baking chocolate, and you've got yourself one hell of a combination. I thorougly enjoyed it. Mouthfeel was creamy and smooth. Due to the cask, carbonation or any type of harshness was undetectable. I wonder how this one ages? This is definitely the ultimate ""dessert beer."""
"Is this a vanilla/chocolate shake from Ruby's? The vanilla is very pronounced in the flavor, where it melds well with the bittersweet chocolate. The porter part seems to be hidden underneath the vanilla bean. There was a touch of cardboard found in the aroma and flavor, but otherwise this was a rich, creamy treat that I would suggest to be served/mixed with vanilla ice cream."
"Interesting beer, I really really liked the concept. The smell was nice, but then when drinking it was very much of two competing flavors in my mouth. Not the good kind. Too much vanilla, and did not hold me with an sort of balance."
"D - I think this is a wonderfully balanced sweet porter. The vanilla bean is very noticeable and enjoyable with the smokey and chocolate notes."
"I was happy to see this on the cask at the new, glorious Blue Palms Brewhouse in Hollywood. The barkeep did a fantastic job to make sure this was served properly. Dark as night with a fluffy cumulous cloud head - this looked fantastic. The first few sniffs were all vanilla bean. After warming the ole nose up to that I got some of the roasted chestnut malts through. Brings about a dessert drink - like someone dipped a scoop of vanilla into my porter. I mean that in the best way."
"Drinkability: Pretty heavy, then again I was a bit hungover. Will try again if I ever venture back down to Escondido. Pretty good, but not great."
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin. The vanilla is gigantic in the aroma and the flavor. I'll be frank, it's obliteratingly gigantic. Is this a negative? Not really. Though, if you don't like vanilla, I could see why folks would find it offputting."
"Tastes of coffee and roasted malts, but nothing in the smoked department. The vanilla, be it on the nose or the tongue, is once again a bit overwhelming here. I've tried this brew on cask once in the past and I don't remember it being so overpowering. Nonetheless, an enjoyable and easy drinking beverage, assumably weighing in at the typical 5.90% of Stone's standard offering."
"This one warms up nice in the hand and may be intended to be enjoyed over and over."
"Not terribly drinkable, as the flavor is so strong of vanilla. Everyone at the table did finish theirs, but without enthusiasm. Maybe a bit less vanilla bean in the recipe would yield a more balanced, drinkable brew."
"Drinkability - Very easy drinking and refreshing. I could drink this beer all night long thanks to the flavor and the lower ABV."
"Not recommended. About the only beer I've sent back at Beachwood (and hey, I said I would pay for it regardless!). Sure, give it a taste - just don't order a pint of it!"
"Overall, I think that its an alright porter but the vanilla really gave it something nice. I guess that should tell you something: that someone who doesn't drink a lot of porters enjoys this beer. I guess that either makes it a really good beer or a watered down version that everyone can enjoy. Judge for yourself."
"D: A good beer overall by Stone, I didn't like it as much as the other 2 variations that I have had, but it's a solid porter beer. Another good beer from Stone."
"It's not going to replace Otter Creek's Stovepipe Porter in my fridge, mostly due to availability issues, but this is by far worth it if you can find it."
"Worth checking out, but only available here at Stone World Bistro supposedly"
"Pours a deep brownish red on close examination, dark brown if looked at from afar. Head is off white and frothy with pretty good retention. Leaves ok lacing. The smell has a a good amount of chocolate malt in it, as well as vanilla. The taste has more sweetness compared to the regular smoked porter, not only by the vanilla character but also from chocolate malt and caramel flavor. Still, the vanilla gives a real nice tweek that comes through not too strong but enough to transform the beer into something a little different. I like the mouthfeel, it's not too thick and gives it a real drinkable character over other richly flavored beers. The carbonation level in this is real fine and not course or abrasive. This was a growler that had been kept in the fridge for 4 days so I don't know if that enabled it to mellow or not."
