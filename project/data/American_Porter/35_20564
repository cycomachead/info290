Light aroma of toasted malt, chocolate and unidentifiable spicing. Flavor follows with lightly toasted malt, light chocolate and coffee. Finish is slightly dry with residual malt and a hint of hops and chocolate. Light to medium bodied. A pleasant, but subdued American porter. Not sure what the holiday connection is, but certainly would be as drinkable then as any other time. No stand out features, but like most Sam Adams, well made, looks good and nice to drink.","LiquidAmber","Mar 21, 2013"

Maybe I've just been spoiled on very yeasty beers, but it seems very clean and thin to me. Not necessarily in a bad way. It's nice to have porters like that every now and then. Cocoa nibs are what hits first in flavour and it's what hits last too. There's some nice, simple balancing hops too. But there's really not a lot going on outside of the chocolate. It looks surprisingly awesome despite how thin the mouthfeel is for a stout. It's almost Guiness-thin. But that makes it refreshing, like a black lager. The feeling it leaves in your mouth is very sticky, though, and strongly of cocoa. This is basically ,an average, run-of-the-mill thinish stout with a very chocolatey edge. So, if that's what you're going for, this delivers.","ElCommodoro","Feb 04, 2013"

Very tasty beer. Not a lot of head. Really pretty held up to the light: black with dark, translucent red coming through. The nose didn't jump out at me but there was definitely a little caramel as indicated on the bottle. The taste was very chocolately with some caramel in the background. Toasty, nothing resembling coffee, but a lot of chocolate and vanilla and caramel and toastiness. Creamy mouthfeel, not a lot of carbonation.

Very well balanced. Thin enough in the mouth to go down easy yet not so thin it's boring or watery. Not great but a very solid offering for the Holidays from Sam Adams.","wcudwight","Dec 25, 2012"

If you're used to your run of the mill porter and someone hands you a Sam Adams porter, it's going to be different and something you don't expect.

The flavor includes dark roasted malts, caramel sweetness, some bready character, and a nice herbal hop bite. There are also some chocolate and coffee notes as well.

3.03,-18.5,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Pouring a very deep red, courtesy of the four types of malts they use, there is a subtle sweetness on the nose, typical of beers that add oats to their mixture, which this one does. There also appears to be a slight metallic tang that I'm a bit leery of, but perhaps that's just a characteristic of one of the three types of hops they use (though my research suggests that all three are mild). Regardless, on the tongue there is a pleasant hop bite, reminding me more of a light IPA than a Porter, and while the oats give it a satisfying chewiness, bringing some balance, the effect is fleeting, leaving one with a weak aftertaste and a feeling of being let down. To be blunt, I'm not that impressed; I prefer my Porters and Stouts with more body and weight, and while this might be considered a Light Porter, good with a simple burger or meatloaf as well as an introduction to the style, there are better examples out there.

I didn't know if I was in for a spiced beer as the name is ""Holliday Porter"" but I perceived none. A beginner porter but flavorful nonetheless.","Jparker37","Nov 05, 2012"

4.02,8.1,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Dark brown in appearance with a fuzzy tan cover that fades to a stubborn patchy head and fair traces of lacing. The aroma brings licorice spruce with hints of root beer malt. Pleasant. The flavor comes on with a different direction that accents charcoal and a touch of creamy chocolate. Subtle cranberry and a slightly evergreen/herbal hop idea. Medium-plus bodied it presents a satiny, plush feel that may be its greatest characteristic. Very nice flavor with a scrumptious footprint that slides down so easily. A very good holiday brew that represents the style well.","Durge","Feb 04, 2012"

They've pretty much pulled all of these off the shelves where I live (as the holidays are over), so you should definately give this one a try if you can find it.","JacStance","Jan 24, 2012"

The mix of chocolate malts and English hops gives it a nice depth of taste, and it has a medium-thick body to it. Still tastes good after reaching room temperature, so you don't have to drink it really cold like a lager. This is a great porter that I wish BBC would make in a six-pack. Still worth the wait, a nice addition to the winter mix pack.","Sudsy89","Jan 24, 2012"

3.57,-4,4,2,4,4.5,4,"M: Rich, and sits nicely, covering the mouth well.

3.78,1.6,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Very dark brown, nearly opaque, with ruby highlights. Fine tan foam, lots of streaky lacing, good head retention. Looks quite nice! Malty aroma, brown sugar and chocolate, toasted bread and a bit of roast, malted milk. Bitterness was mild up front, where there was more malty sweetness, and a little bit more pronounced towards the end. Milk chocolate and roasty notes, toasty, a bit of spiciness in the finish. Medium bodied with smooth carbonation, a bit of dryness from the dark grains. Overall, a decent porter that I rather enjoyed.","DrJay","Nov 13, 2011"

Granted, I gave it a vigorous pour but I’m still looking at a good two fingers of foam after a few minutes have passed. Cold, I pick up some muted roasty malts and a faint dark roast coffee on the nose. It’s a full-bodied porter, with a lot of roast on the palate. Coffee, without being coffee-like. Strong, satisfying, without being overpowering. What makes this a holiday porter? I’m picking up some ‘holiday spices,’ in very subtle and layered ways, as the beer warms.

3.43,-7.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"A dark brown color and a sizable head that recedes slowly. Smells include grass, flowers and perhaps some caramel. The taste is a bit different from this.

Flavored tasted burnt, which everyone else here seems to enjoy but it was a bit off-putting to me. ""Smooth"" wasn't what I was thinking of this beer and one was enough for me. To me when I say a beer is ""drinkable"" I mean that I could put them down all day, but with the Holiday Porter I felt it was too heavy for that and a bit abrasive. By the end, I was kind of sick of it and ready for something else that was more refreshing. This beer has a mouthfeel somewhat on the heavier side that I didn't think was sessionable.

It looks, smells and tastes like any other run of the mill porter. If this is your first adventure into Porterland or holiday-style beers, it is a good starting point. It's drinkable with a very noticable maltiness in the taste and a decent roasted odor. It felt a little light though. Not that I was expecting a heavy stout-like experience, rather this porter did not have the richness I was hoping for. A baltic version of this might add the extra punch that this one is lacking.

Pours a clear, dark brown with deep red highlights and a thin tan head that leaves small swaths of lace on the glass. The aroma is rich and surprisingly complex - vinous malts, dark fruit, some chocolate, and lots of caramel. The flavor starts complex and bittersweet with sweet caramel malts, tangy and highly roasted malt flavors, and a light amount of earthy and fruity hop flavor. Notes of dark chocolate and sweetened coffee grow towards mid-palate. Sweet caramel start turns into a nicely bittered but still full and sweet finish. The beer isnt really strong, but has a slight warming effect on the back of the palate. The mouthfeel is full and creamy with a soft and pleasant lightness from carbonation. Overall, a very decently made beer. It has the slightly-too-sweet character as some other Sam Adams beers (like their Honey Porter, Brown Ale, and Black Lager), but this one isnt cloying (much, much better balanced and better tasting than the honey porter).","CuriousMonk","Jan 27, 2011"

It held in, with its rocky condition, until I returned from my break (ahem), at which time it began to fall leaving some lovely lacing behind. Color was a deep, dark-brown with ruby highlights. The highlights are the stuff of legend. Deep, rich reds at the edges, at the bottom and perhaps the sides of a porter, those were famed, boys! The nose had a dusty chocolaty odor, like a tin of cocoa had been overturned recently. Mouthfeel was MUCH fuller than anticipated, with porters having been watered down for their intended audience. I felt like an iron fist encased in a velvet glove had grazed my jaw with that first sip. It was soooo smooth and unobtrusive and then, Wham!, playtime was over! Milk chocolate, caramel, spice (perhaps allspice, maybe cinnamon) all of a sudden made an appearance. My palate was overwhelmed. Finish was slightly bitter, slightly smoky, slightly sweet. Zounds! I'll tell you what, my good man, you haul a cask like the one on the label over to Chez Wood and I'll send the neighborhood lad to fetch that big goose in the butcher's window to be roasted for the both of us, by gar!","woodychandler","Dec 24, 2010"

On the tongue there is a mixture of Christmas-type spices, cinammon, maybe ginger, all riding on the roasted malt. In the mouth there is a really fuzzy feeling, warming but not from the alcohol, more from simple friction.

Tastes closely to the nose, coffee notes, bitter sweet chocolate, and a slight roasted character, with moderate lacing left behind after first sip. A thin film remains throughout the drink with tight lacing left behind on the walls of my glass. Overall a favorite of mine from SA and a very solid porter at that.

Poured from the bottle, it has a nice chestnut brown color and a thin, creamy beige head. There is nothing much going on in the aroma, but the flavor brings a little bit of sweetness with a hint of vanilla that is balanced against a good roasty, nutty base. Good body and good carbonation make this one go down pleasantly. Overall, it is a smooth, well-made porter that has a nice balance of sweetness and hearty roasted malts. I don't know if I would buy it regularly if it was available year-round, but I do appreciate its addition to the winter sampler.","devilben02","Nov 23, 2010"

Aroma of specialty malts, roasted, chocolate, and coffee combine affectionately with a light resin. The flavor starts out dark malts that linger to the finish with a touch of bitterness that lightly accents the duration. Medium body, creamy texture, dark malt intensity all add up to result in a fine American Porter that is pleasing and well enjoyed after a hearty meal.","outdoorbrewer","Nov 17, 2010"

The taste holds notes of chocolate, wheat, rye bread, nutmeg, cinnamon, and the always-there roasted malts. The body is a solid medium, with a light carbonation and a very smooth feel. Overall, a very nice porter, but somehow falls short of greatness. It's highly drinkable, but seems to lack a certain roastiness or darkness or warmth (something along these lines).","TMoney2591","Nov 17, 2010"

Hmm, this is a really nice English/American interpretation of the style, would have been great I imagine with last nights filet. Mouthfeel is fairly smooth and not too sharp and bubbly.

At the end of the taste though is where it really makes it unique because it has this bitter dry hopped taste that mixes with the chocolate. The blend of the surprising amount of hops used with the chocolate of course creates a burnt chocolate/dry finish.

Finish was warming, bitter and slightly dry. Not a bad beer at all.","kimcgolf","Feb 15, 2010"

The end has a slight hop bitterness that's a little grating with the malt flavor but overall it finishes crisply. The mouth feel leaves a little to be desired, it's a bit on the watery side. Overall not bad, somewhat tasty, and drinkable.","Thur123","Feb 12, 2010"

Mouthfeel is on the thin side and there is not a whole lot of sweetness in here. Hop bitterness comes in late and is accentuated a little by the roast.

This isn't the most complex beer I've had, but it's flavorful enough to be enjoyable. It is a bit filling and rich, though, so if you don't like lingering aftertastes or oaky or hoppy mouthfeel then you might not enjoy more than one of these. The flavor lingers on for a while and may influence the taste of beers you have afterwards. It's nice to get a couple of these in Sam Adams' seasonal sampler, though. I'd say have just one of these and then have something with a strong contrast to the porter taste, like an IPA or something hoppy to clear your tastebuds.","glamphetamine","Dec 18, 2009"
3.53,-5.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours black cola with fleeting white head. Smells of chocolate cola, malt, subtle dark fruit. Dark flavors of chocolate, cola, some syrup and dark sugars.

One of the better winter classics for Sam.","JRed","Dec 16, 2009"

Taste is biscuity malt up front, followed by a sharp, almost burnt roast and then a crisp finish. I can see this going well with a sweet-ish meat dish. Mouthfeel is soft and pleasantly carbonated. Drinkability is good but a bit too roasted for me to settle in for the evening with this one.

Smell is sweet with strong coffee and chocolate, with lighter hints of spice and caramel. Taste is very similar to the smell, with roasted caramel malts and a hint of hop spice. Mouthfeel has a little too much in terms of carbonation, though when it dies off it has a good body. I could enjoy this beer often, but after one or two I think I might start getting a little full.

Coffee and chocolate are present in the smell, but it is the caramel presence that takes the real lead here. A sweetness in the nose that i can't wait to taste. Taste does not disappoint me at all. Caramel is still very strong, and the coffee is coming through considerably stronger now. Very full bodied and with a sweet taste that lasts on the palate. Goes down very well, and very drinkable.

The picks up right where the smell leaves off. Th flavors are perfectly blended. The malts taste caramelized and roasted until a little burned. There are still the same hints of coffee, chocolate, and maybe even some hints of toffee/butter as well. The mouthfeel is very good. It's full bodied and smooth at the same time.

The Winter Lager was a little dumbed down this year, more like a modified Boston Lager (which they threw in to take up space), and then scraping the bottom we have Coastal Wheat (awful) and Cranberry Lambic (blech).

It was a little drier than I initially expected a holiday porter to be, but it balances a lot more nicely when it warms up a bit. Medium-light and, again, really creamy mouthfeel.

Fruits are prominent in the flavor, and the chocolate steps it up--sort of reminds me of Neapolitan ice cream. As it warms, it resembles Anchor's holiday ale, and that ain't a bad thing.

I smell a sweet, bready aroma with lactic notes, and the sweetness turns out to be a nice caramel flavor when I sip. Also dominant in the taste is baker's chocolate, which contributes to an acrid but not unpleasant finish. That the beer is balanced without any overwhelming flavors or qualities makes it pretty drinkable.

The aroma was semi-sweet, a blend of chocolate, caramel and toasted malt and spices. The flavors started with caramel malt, then went into chocolate malt, roasted malt, spices and the semi-bitter finish of Fuggles hops.

Smells of strongly of coffee and caramel, with dark roastiness taking a back seat. As it warms a lot of buttery notes come out--can't yet decide if this is a good or a bad thing. The roasted (almost burnt) malts are much stronger upon tasting, where the beer takes on a very bittersweet character. Some buttery notes again. Dark cacao and a slight metallic taste lead to a dry finish. High carbonation makes it interesting on the palate initially; leaves an oily coating all over. A pretty decent porter overall.","philipquarles","Jan 13, 2009"

Full, malty taste. Again, a lot of milk chocolate, the maltiness gives the beer a ""Whoppers"" candy taste. Pleasant butterscotch, cereal grain, and roasted almonds accompany this. Kind of thin, but appropriate for the style. While one was very easy to drink and smooth, more than one could get too sweet for me.

That's a good thing because it makes the holiday 12 pack buyable. It pours a deep mahogany brown with a tinge of ruby. Aroma is of malty sweet, fruit bread, and cherry. When the first sip hits my tongue I get a quick hit of smoke that fades to a full bodied smooth and toasty malt bath for my tongue. A bready and fruity wash of cherries, blackberries, and currants.

Poured the color of cola with a half inch, fizzy, khaki-colored cap. Head dissipated quickly into a soapy skim with a thick, broken band around the shoulders of the glass. Mild nose consisted of chocolate malt and a mere suggestion of dark fruit. Taste was roasty chocolate up front with a light, toffee sweetness towards the back and a kiss of hops at the finish.

A fair amount of lacing adorns my glass. Smell is a smoky tobacco and malt affair. Pleasing. Taste shows off a bitter chocolate aspect, with coffee and dark fruits around as well.

I poured this in to a Duvel glass. It came out a dark brown color, a shade or two away from black, and had a finger worth of white heading. Smell is very lovely in subtle ways. Dry dark grains, milk chocolate, coal, a hint of dark berries. Flavor is much of the same, but not to the degree that the aroma showed. Bottle says it is a full bodied brew; and I would have to agree to an extent. It felt more medium sized than large for me, but lingering in that territory. Drinking this gets easier with each sip, as it does unfold a lot as it warms. I went in to this beer not expecting for it to deliver as much as it did. Perfect for the holiday season. Now I only wish they would put this and the Old Fezziwig in six packs. This one gets a thumbs up from me.","jamie2dope","Nov 28, 2008"

It has a fantastic aroma and taste, though! Excellent scents/flavors of chocolate and roasted barley, but the best part is how it smells and tastes almost like a smoked porter.

Pleasant smell of malt and nuts, some faint coffee and cocoa. There is a slight flavor of roasted malt, coffee, but nothing too strong. Smooth, almost light, no heavy creaminess. Easy to drink and enjoyable.","BigBry","Apr 27, 2008"

However, there is a hint of a watery character near the finish of this brew, like the body is slowly thinning out after the first few seconds in my mouth.

Slightly sweet of roasted chocolate and caramel malts. Lightly roasted coffee and bitter chocolate come through with mild woody hops into modestly dry finish.

The mouthfeel is a little more watery than I expected from the pour, but it is still pleasant. This isn't as heavy as some porters, and I'd consider it to be more drinkable than most because of it.

The nose has sweet, think cinnamon, chocolate, sugar, spice, especially once warms up a little bit of hops in the background. Agitate this beer a little and the head re-appears, nice and thick.

Smell was somewhat suprising as there were more hops present than I expected, not overwhelming but present. Also some chocolate and caramel notes. Taste is a good blend of malt and some hops, although the hops arent as noticeable in the taste. Strong tastes of toasted grain with some coffee and chocolate in the back. Leaves a somewhat dry, oily feeling behind and I'd say has a medium to almost medium-heavy mouthfeel. Best when drunk at warmer temperature (brings out the chocolate and caramel tastes more).

Anise comes out a bit much aside from the other flavors, however, there is a significant hop presence giving some nice English hop flavors. Finishes a bit dry ans with a roasty lingering effect.

Personally, among Sam Adams products, their porters I find to be exceptional, unfailingly excellent beverages, and Holiday Porter is no slouch. Porter fans will enjoy. This is a great beer to crack open after shoveling the driveway, or for resting with a book by the fire. First-rate.","Gehrig","Nov 10, 2007"

The beer is a couple shades darker than cola and there is mild carbonation. The nose is very much porter-like. Toasty, burnt, bitter hop aroma. The flavor profile is really nice. It's smooth and complex with good balance. It starts out rich and smooth with a touch of burnt grain, then the burnt flavor introduces the bitter hop taste. It finishes clean and doesn't leave you hanging. I enjoy the mouthfeel of this one. It is neither too thick nor too bold. It is very drinkable just for that reason: it's rich but not too rich, and it's strong but not unsessionably strong. 1 or 2 would be nice on a cold night.","Rudgers73","Nov 03, 2007"

Smell was of cocoa, coffee, and a hint of berries. The taste was lighter and sweeter than I expected, with a mild honey finish. Mouthfeel was also lighter than I expected; this is not a beer that coats the tongue, which makes it a good choice for holiday session drinking.

It is sweetly caramel in flavor, has a yet a nice crisp spice, almost resembling of nutmeg, but best of all is that it finishes out with a smooth chocolaty flavor. The smooth chocolate flavor comes with a fine velvet feel at the end.

Silky coffee with mild english hop undertones. The flavor is smooth and roasty, with caramel sweetness balanced by subtle herbal hops and coffee roastiness. A bit of plum fruitiness rounds things out. Melllow, english-styled carbonation. Lightish body. I'd call this beer exactly to style, nothing more, nothing less. What it lacks in adventurousness, it more than makes up for in tastiness. Probably my second favorite in the holiday variety pack, or equal to the black lager.","UnionMade","Dec 12, 2006"

Strong porter-like attributes throughout (chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, toast, and walnuts). All show up evenly in the look, smell, and taste. A swift kick of hops (English) give a big pine flavor and aroma; adds spiciness, dryness, and a Christmas tree, get-in-the-mood kind of flavor. Aggressively bittered and flavored, but not to dominate the malts and other Porter characters. Finishes sweet and bitter with a bit of a roasted grain / hop bite. A bit dry. Good porter though.","BEERchitect","Dec 10, 2006"

Mouthfeel is light/medium, a little lighter than I expected it to be. The drinkability is good, it's not too hard to drink this at all.

Smooth caramel, toffee, and chocolate, with a hint of fruit. Seems along the lines of an English style, as hops seem restrained. Very easy to drink, with a medium to full body.

3.43,-7.8,3.5,3,3.5,3,4,"Purchased as part of the holiday sampler pack, the nice wintry painting on the label was definitely festive, just like the sister beer Old Fezziwig. The beer came out burnt reddish brown with a head looking similar to foam on a cappuccino. The body was quite dark looking until held up against the light. Aromatically this was quite simplistic, since the basic smell was that of chocolate, and coffee, but much too light to be very interesting. The taste was a little more robust that the smell suggested, with chocolate and toffee riding atop soda water like fizz, and followed by a fleeting hint of grainy astringency. The hop oils showed up as a spicy earthiness, but werent all that bitter. Light in the mouth, and in the aftertaste department, and therefore very easy to drink, I found this Porter to be in a similar veins as the Black Lager, which was also in the sampler pack. A side by side comparison indicated that I preferred the Black Lager a little more, due to the overall smoother feel. If the Holiday Porter might have beer grittier, it might have fared better.","rajendra82","Jan 17, 2006"

As it approaches the finish, a sweetness takes over and a butterscotch taste comes into play, which is actually quite strong. It imparts an unusual element to this porter, but it never becomes so strong as to be cloying or offensive. The mouthfeel is a little thinner than I would like for a porter, but it doesn't take anything away from the beer. The drinkability is great because it's just a really good tasting porter.

The two bitterness types blend well with the dryness of the beer and give a good finish. This isn't a strong, overwhelming porter and it seems more like an English porter than an American porter based on BA's style descriptions.

Head retention was excellent, it was slow to fade and it rested at a thin cap. This cap lasted the entire consumption. Subsequent lacing was chunky and widespread. It looks good in my glass. The nose is pleasant; the potency is low though yet I can hear what it is saying. Vanilla beans, espresso, chocolate, caramel, and roasted malts complete the bouquet. The aromas are well rounded; however it seems a little too simplistic. Sure, it smells like a Porter but it doesnt knock me out. Still, it is inviting. The palate says English Porter to me. I like it. Roasted malts are bigger than the nose indicated, which is a good thing. Sweetness is satisfying from the start, caramel, espresso, and char as well. Vanilla. Chocolate. It becomes astringent at the finish. There is some noticeable hop bitterness but it fails to reach any noteworthy levels, however it does offer some earthy flavors. It is a nice complement to the malty backbone. On the whole this is a good Porter, it isnt great and it isnt something Id buy a six-pack of. So as far as Im concerned the BBC can keep the two bottles in the Winter Sampler but there isnt any reason to go beyond that. Not quite medium in body, the carbonation is a tickle too low, more body is needed. Kick up the malt! The mouthfeel is too slick, too oily, and not rich enough. This aspect of the beer could be improved. Sure, this beer is drinkable but it fails to wow me. It is good but there are far too many better Porters on the market.

Stuck fairly well to the glass. The smell was a little subdued, but a decent roasted malt and bitter chocolate notes. Smooth creamy mouthfeel with just a little bite. Probably would have smoothed out with some warming. I drank it a little too cold. Very well done. Not the best porter I've ever had, but a definate winner.

Lots of spices though that are backed by a decently thick, well-carbonated body. All in all this is a good holiday-style beer. This years Sam Adams holiday mixer is very, very good!","granger10","Nov 26, 2004"
4.12,10.8,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours out very dark - blackish with perhaps just a tiny hint of crimson whne the light hits it just right. Poured with a tiny tannish head that settled within a few minutes. The aroma on this one is something special for sure. Strong chocolate notes with a hint of alcohol. Also some hints of dark, rich malts. The flavors match the aroma quite well. Lots of chocolate and roasted malts. Well balanced with hop bitterness as well. Slight alcohol taste in the finish, which is every so slightly dry. Very good. The mouthfeel is excellent and true to the style. Quite think and substantial, but not quite as solid and chewy as a stout. For the style I think this is a very drinkable beer. Not something you'd want to kick back 6 or 8 of, but definitely a homerun hit for the BBC.","niknar","Nov 25, 2004"
3.95,6.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"This beer has a dark black body, with brown hues on the sides. Khaki-brown head leaves behind some lace. The main scent is chocolate malts along with some spicy tones as well. Chocolate malt in front, muted hop accent, along with some spice and nut notes. Med bodied. Overall pretty good","Tballz420","Nov 23, 2004"
4,7.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Not sure what qualifies this as a ""holiday"" porter, other than calling it that gives SA an excuse to include it in the winter sampler. Marketing aside, this was a very well put together porter. Rich, a touch creamy with nicely roasted malt flavors that did not stray too far to the caramel or over-roasted ends of the spectrum. Nicely punched-up hops qualifies for the robust porter designation (I think of it as a category). I lamented the passing of SA's Honey Porter, which was a nice crossover beer to introduce the style, and I'm happy to see SA put this beer in the lineup. I'd be happier if they made it a regular offering, rather than a seasonal. Surely they could kick a few cases of the cherry wheat off grocery shelves to make room. Nice label - a bottle of this and one of Old Fezzi and I'm ready to watch A Christmas Carol.","Brent","Nov 20, 2004"

4.38,17.7,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"i found this to be spot on and a pleasant new additon to the winter classics pack. it pours a lovely deep brown colour with a big fluffy and chunky off white head that leaves a mess of residue on the glass. the smell is subtle but solid: caramel, chocolate, a touch of coffee and some roasted malt. a touch sweet and a touch earthy. nice. the flavour is equally good if not better: sweet but not overpowering earthy and malty but not too rugged. it definitely has a winter/holiday tone to it. there's a warmth here that just fits in right, and it;s not the alcohol as it does not make itself known at all throughout. it tastes at times almost likea mix of the chocolate bock and the honey porter bleded together seemlessly. really good stuff. if only they could eliminate the cranberry lambic and add an extra one of these and the fezziwig. grab the winter classics for this one alone, i'd say.","SixpointJMH","Nov 17, 2004"
3.8,2.2,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours a dark brown/near black in color with a light tan head. Aroma of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel and a touch vinous. Full-bodied and well carbonated mouthfeel. Front features dark chocolate flavors and roasted malt. Hop bitterness emerges midway and really dries out the palate. Vinous flavor seeps through behind the hops. Dryness continues in the finish.","Winter","Nov 16, 2004"
3.56,-4.3,4,3,3.5,4,4,"Nice black body with brown head. Smells bready and sweet. Flavor is overall light, kick of flavor in the beginning and coffee aftertaste. The mouth feel is light and crisp, and drink ability is pretty good. Not a big beer that a lot of BA's look for, but it's light charactor is refreshing when you are not looking to blow your sences away.","danadeny","Nov 15, 2004"
4.57,22.8,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a nice black color and has a thick tan head that leaves decent lace rings in my glass. It has a wonderfully smooth malty aroma that screams drink me. The flavor is very smooth and the dark malts are in balance with the caramel and they don't overpower the flavor like most porters. I love the balance of the hops too. This is a great porter and hopefully it will see time in Boston Beer Company's regular rotation. Thank you Jim Koch and the brewers at BBC for another fine beer.","RushLimbmalt","Nov 14, 2004"
2.66,-28.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"The taste is fairly bland, but bitter. The malt taste is barely there. There may be a hint of caramel as it is mildly sweet. Most porter that I have tried have some sort of flavor, but this one is not very flavorful.","abcsofbeer","Nov 14, 2004"
4.37,17.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Much like the other reviews of this beer, I was also very excited for the new addition of the Sam Winter pack. Specifically bought a 12 just to get my hands on three of these babies. I will say it did not disappoint either. The presentation is wonderful, a deep ruby brown and nudging toward opaque. The head is a perfectly formed, fluffy and tan, and about an inch in stature. The odor reeks of roasted chocolate malts and that's when I get excited. Before any of the actual flavor, I notice how robust the mouthfeel is, but how smooth it remains. The actual characteristics combine a nutty taste with a more omnipresent mocha overtone that is delightful. It finishes bitter and dry, a transformation from a roasted malt to a burnt cocoa taste. Great interpretation of the style.","Hhawk06","Nov 14, 2004"
3.85,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"My bottle was from the Sam Winter Sampler pack. The beer pours an incredibly dark color with a thick amber head. Immediately chocolate is noticable in the smell and also is present in the taste along with a coffee like flavor. Mouthfeel is similar to a Guiness with a watery feeling but this has much more of an alochol taste. I wish this were available outside of the sampler pack as I would definetly make this a routinely drank beer.","WeymouthMike","Nov 12, 2004"
3.7,-0.5,4,4,3.5,3,4,"Pours a very deep black, reddish core when held up to the light. Large creamy head colored a light tan. Aroma is chocolate and a nut-like (almond?) extract. Decent alcohol in there also. Taste is more of the chocolate, and roasted coffee, slight bitterness in the finish. A little watery/loose feeling, leaves a little to be desired. Pleasant beer that I wish was available outside of the holiday package.","hobbes2112","Nov 10, 2004"
4.12,10.8,4,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy tan/brown head that slowly fades. The aroma is great. It has a smooth and sweet chocolatey scent that is very pleasant to the nose. There are also hints of patent and crystal malts, but the chocolate scent is overpowering. The taste is good. It has a rich black malt presence along with a chocolate element. It goes down easy and finishes rather dry. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good porter. It is full of body and flavor, although the taste just wasn't what I expected from the aroma. This is a good drinker regardless.","WesWes","Nov 08, 2004"

It is the color of Coca-Cola, with a thick tan-colored head (about 3/4"") that lingers for several minutes. Smell is slightly malty, not too intense. Taste is pleasant, a bit on the bitter side. Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly thick. Alcohol content is 5.9%. An above-average brew, but not one of the great ones.","DFN","Oct 31, 2004"
