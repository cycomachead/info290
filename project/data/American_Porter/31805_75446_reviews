"Easy drinking beer, which got a decent complexity to it, turning out a bit too thin and metallic during the finish. Also the bitterness is a bit too harsh, compared to the weaker implemented sweeter flavors of the beer, initially promising a decent balance. The beers interaction between coffee, bitter chocolate and slightly wooden coconuts is very enjoyable though, while the brew remains recognizable as a Porter."

"If you like coconut, this beer is pretty good. If you LOVE coconut, this beer is amazing. If you don't like coconut, this beer is terrible."

"If you love coconut, this beer is a must try beer. Super rich and authentic coconut flavor is just oozing from the aroma and flavor profile of this beer. Not smelling or tasting much coffee in this porter. Lots of milk chocolate and vanilla flavor and aroma. Medium bodied porter with very creamy, decadent mouthfeel, and near perfect carbonation levels. Funky Buddha Last Snow proves to me that no one else can do such great porters that are brewed with adjuncts. I thought Maple Bacon Coffee porter was excellent porter, well Last Snow is even better!  Funky Budda definitely ""upped the annie"" with this adjunct porter!"
"Just an excellant beer in general. One of the best ive had in a long time"
""

"O: The coconut is nice on the nose, but overall this is pretty one dimensional, and the taste is decidedly watery.  The base is too thin to stand up to the coconut flavor.  And unfortunately, the coffee seems to have completely faded."
"O – Awesome. Delicious. Heaven in a glass. I love coconut and coffee so this one resonates with me. I have had many chances to drink this and love it each time. So glad its bottled now."
"i don't get this at all.  Tastes like flavored (read: bad) coffee."
""
""
""
""
""
"Good, but the flavor seemed very artificial opposed to a smooth and fully integrated brew.  This was just not for me relative to some other beers in this style."

"Overall, hands down the best beer I have had the pleasure of drinking so far in 2015.  The aroma on this one is just mind boggling!  Funky Buddha brought the funk like George Clinton on this one."
""
"Nice creamy porter with huge coconut flavor/nose.  It goes into the sun tan lotion realm, which is a bit far.  The coffee emerges as it warms to help balance.  It's close to liquid Samoas."
""
"Pretty damn good for a 6% porter."
""
"The beer pours a  deep, dark brown, more amber when light catching the beer's edges, and is topped by a thin tan head that retreats quickly to the glass's edges before fading completely. The nose wreaks strongly of coconuts upfront followed by coffee and some chocolate as it warms. The taste reminds me most of samoas, but I can definitely see the ""liquid mounds bars"" description. As expected, coconut dominates the flavor profile, but the taste does transition to burnt toffee, caramel sweetness and bitter coffee in the finish. Although it's a porter, I'd anticipated more body to match the beer's heavy flavors. The carbonation is low (better than mbcp) as is the bitterness and like magic, every flavor seems to be distinct and noticeable (except for the subtle cocoa buttery richness emblematic of white chocolate). The roasted malt in the finish is all that remains of the beer's fleeting porter base. I'll admit, this is an exceptional beer, which I would definitely recommend to others, but slightly prefer mbcp"

"Wish this had a tad thicker mouth feel.  There's a coffee shop in Central Florida that makes a coconut mocha almond latte called the ""Coco Mocha Joy"" and this literally smells just like that.  It's one of the best smelling beers I've had.  The taste isn't far off from the smell.  Last Snow is a great smelling, great tasting porter.  Just wish that it was a little bit thicker and stayed on the tongue longer.  A lot of brewers make really unbalanced coffee beers, but I feel like this one is spot on.  Well done, Funky!  Now I need to find some MBCP :D."

"Big coffee and coconut smell. A bit less on flavor. Tastes awesome with Samoas Girl Scout Cookies. If this could be barrel aged, and the taste could match the smell, this would be world class."

"one of the best porters i have ever had, and certainly the best use of coconut in a beer that i can think of. its so coconut forward. looks dark brown, chocolaty, obviously stained from the coffee, because the body on this is not all that heavy. its also not all that sweet, which shocks me considering the ingredients added here. i think the white chocolate is a perfect contrast to the dark roasty bitter malts and coffee intensity. it gives a buttery richness to the feel, a milky character to the flavor, and is a perfect platform for the coconut to cling on to. my mom works in hawaii sometimes, and she always brings me good kona coffee. this reminds me of that, the coconut medium roast blend, where both elements contribute equally to a much greater whole. im not really getting caramel here, but i dont want to get it. this doesnt need to be sweeter or richer, i think it finds a near perfect balance of textures and sugars that needs nothing. dusty almost in the finish, with a dryer coffee chocolate thing coming out, and after the swallow all i taste is the coconut. i love this beer, and wish i could get it regularly. these guys have a great reputation, so im stoked my first couple of beers from them were as good as suggested. this is genius."

"O: 4.75 One of the most interesting beers I've tried, but Funky Buddha aspires to just that. Glad my wife was here to share as more than a glass may be too much flavor, but this is definitely worth seeking out."

"Pours a dark beer. Forms very little foam, some bubbles. Smell is a bit faint and hard to catch. Taste is amazing. Has vanilla, coconut, chocolate, and is overall sweet. It is a syrupy beer, and makes you very sticky. Definitively worth trying it."

"One of my favorite beers at the extreme beer fest and one of my favorite new brewers (at least new to me). The beer was smooth and had a great coconut taste but wasn't overpowering on the coconut or vanilla. Crisp but not too light or bitter but it didn't punch you in the face either. I could drink this all day and night long"

"O- Hell of a porter. Very complex, drinkable and interesting. Highly recommend getting a growler of this if you can. They weren't filling growlers of this to go, but if they were, I'd take a couple along with me on my vacation."

"Overall - The BEST porter i have ever experienced. This amazing porter leaves you satisfied but always wanting more. This is however a special release Funky Buddha does so if you catch wind of a release you better jump on it because the kegs go fast usually within hours. This beer is definitely a world class porter that every porter lover should experience."
""
""
""
""
""
"Funky Buddha makes a number of wildly creative, intensely flavored beers, and Last Snow is definitely one of their best. If you want the ultimate breakfast porter, look no further."
""
"This is a coconut bomb. Only slightly picking up the cherry flavor in this. Nice thick and rich mouthbfeel. This beer just explodes on the tongue with coconut, but has a nice roasted malt under lying that really helps to balance everything out. No real sweetness at all. Huge toasted coconut smell. This beer was pretty awesome."

"Overall phenomenal! Very hard to get any better than this. Again another Funky Buddha grand slam! I really need to get down there and hit them up for some special beers when I can. Got another coming soon so I can't wait for that. This is quickly becoming top 5 breweries for me."
"O - Overall this beer smelled and tasted incredible. Mind shatteringly good. So so so much coconut. Just awesome."
""
"O - WOW...I waited several hours in line for this growler, and I actually ordered a glass of this while i waited, however I'm convinced they did NOT give me this and gave me the OP porter or something else. Shame on you bartender! I was underwhelmed by the hype when i had what I thought was Last Snow but what i'm drinking now is a totally different beer. Without a doubt one of the best porters, if not the best, i've ever had. Well worth the hype and fortunate to have been able to try this"
"O- wow what an amazing beer. This might be one of my all time favorite beers ever. The flavors are amazing and exactly what they wanted it to be, and exactly what I wanted it to be Lol just awesome stuff! Cheers!"

""
""
"O- This was a very nice porter that was very rich and sweet but retained a decent balance between the coconut and caramel. Definitely worth checking out especially if you have a sweet tooth."
""
""
"O: Easily the best porter I’ve had, and one I’m thinking about a couple hours afterwards as I transcribe my notes. The base beer comes through and the white chocolate and coconut are used to push it over the edge instead of as masking agents. High kudos from me."

"O- Simply astounding.  I've had this beer once before and loved it but this reminded me of just how special it is.  Quite possibly the best dessert beer ever brewed."

"Best porter I have ever had. I usually can only drink 1 stout or porter per sitting, I drank 3 of these and was ordering another as the keg kicked. Tastes like toasted coconut, soooo good. Top 5 beers I have ever had, I can't wait for them to open up the brewery. I would say it tasted more like a stout then a porter."
"Overall- One of the best beers I have ever had. The highlight of hunahpu day for me. this is one beer that I cannot wait to have again when i visit funky buddha this summer. Apart from huna this was the only beer that day that i went back and purchased a second one because I could not get over what I had just tasted"
""
""
"O- A great beer, one of the highlights of Hunahpu Day. It tastes and smells delicious and is fun to sip at, although I could probably demolish a large amount of this very easily."
""
"Overall, a truly exceptional beer. Ridiculously flavorful, and a standout beer from an event filled with amazing beers."
"O - An excellent porter, spot on for the description. The flavors work extremely well together and make it incredibly easy to drink. Second best Funky Buddha beer I have had, only behind the Maple Bacon."
""
""
"Overall - Tough not to compare it to Maple Bacon, but it's not up to that level. Maple makes the difference. Coconut is the highlight of this beer."
""
""
""
""
"On tap at Churchkey. Served in a mini snifter. Pours near black with a thin head and a few spots of lacing. The nose carries heavy, heavy chocolate along with a touch of underlying roast. Mild coconut in the background. Then more chocolate. Hersey-syrup-type chocolate. A bit cloying as it warms a bit. Flavor is more heavy chocolate with some underlying coconut character. Some roasted malt beneath. This is a hard one to score as there really isn’t much underlying beer; it’s really heavy chocolate, though not what you’d get from chocolate malt. I can’t knock the nose too much, as it was really wonderful, but have taken that into account in my overall score."
""
"The transition from coconut to coffee is a little sharp and the finish doesn't linger all that much. However, this wins points for creativity. The combo of white chocolate and coconut is fantastic. This is a must try for anyone out there."
""
""
"My first foray into Funky Buddha after hearing an awful lot o' chatter. This stuff pours a deep black-brown topped by a half-finger of dark tan foam. The nose comprises sweet cocoa, coconut, coffee, light molasses, and a kiss of almond. The end result is Christmas happiness in a glass. Up my nose. Something like that. The taste thankfully brings in more of the same, along with a toastier coconut component and the addition of some nutty toffee, completing the image of holiday frivolity made manifest in deliciousness. Oh yeah. The body is a hefty-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally smooth feel. Overall, a downright damn-good beer, one I wish I had many, many more bottles of for future enjoyment. This beer was the highlight of an evening that had more than its fair share of strong contenders. Damn. Get some!"
""
""
"Tap at CK. Pours a deeper clear ruby. Massive off white foam. Big rocky retention. Nose is out of this world. Super rich espresso, coconut hazelnut frappacino. Taste is a little weak but this is not an imperial stout. Thinner than expected with rich frappacino character. The rich Dunkin Donuts iced coffee nose and taste is uncanny but still a bit contrived for me. Could simply be not even a beer if it were given to me blind. Delicious. Tangy lactic palate. Sharper coffee finish. Liked this one a lot. But more of a Starbucks concoction than a porter. 6/7/2012 9/5/7/3/16=4.0"
""
""
"Medium bodied with a nice balance of sweet chocolate, coconut and roasted malt notes. Very sweet up front with lots of silky chocolate and lactic cream. The chooclate is so prominent that it almost tastes like a syrup was added. This is nicely complimented by a coconut milk presence that lingers over the roasted notes Ito a sweet and slightly dry finish. There's a nice roasted malt presence underneath that cuts some of the sweetness and makes it tastes more like a porter. Some robust coffee bean flavor along with dark chocolate, oatmeal, caramel and toffee. Still really sweet but just enough roast to keep it from becoming overwhelming and one dimensional. Another really nice beer from Funky Buddha."
"Appearance is dark brown with some light passing through at the edges. Nose is phenomenal, strong notes of coconut and tons of coffee which pair perfectly together and make for one of the best aromas I have exprerienced. The taste delivers exactly what the nose promises. Tons of coconut, a bit of nut character, coffee is a bit toned down on the taste. Mouthfeel is medium with mild carbonation. Overall... This one is amazing, thanks to preismj for sharing this amazing brew."
"O: a very interesting beer. Typically I don't like these weird combinations, but this one works and works well."
""
""
"Thanks so much Ryan!"
"The beer is dark brown with a half inch of beige head. The aroma brings roast, coconut, chocolate. The flavor is a beautiful blend of coconut and chocolates. Delicious. A must try if you enjoy these flavors. Medium bodied and creamy. Lingering sweet coconut flavors. A terrific beer - would love to have again."
"Excellent and unique beer!"
"O: Maybe my favorite Funky Buddha offering of the night, sans SNACK ATTACK! This is very elegant, and a beer that I could have multiples of without getting sick of it's schtick. Easily recommended, a really solid offering from South Florida."
""
"Mostly coffee in the flavor profile, there is a mild hint on coconut in the mid to late palate, beer is medium in body. A decent flavored porter but not my favorite by a long shot."
"Overall, it was a pretty cool and interesting beer, but the coconut just dominated way too much for me. I was really wowed by Three Hour Tour a while back, this one just didn't compare that favorably for me as far as coconut in beer goes."
"o - Overall a pretty cool beer here with a fantastic nose, though I'm sensing a theme aside. MBCP and all its variants aside, I've found most FB beers (this, No Crusts, Pina Colada) to have wonderful, interesting smells, and good, but not great tastes. Seems to me what Short's shoots for, but normally misses. This is still a very good beer and they are nailing the noses on their beers. If you like Almond Joy/Mounds candybars, this is a must try. Would love to have it again."
"Overall: This beer would have been absolutely phenomenal if the finish were a bit smoother. As it is, I still loved it and would definitely have more."
""
"Last snow is another very brown looking beer that verges on black, well maybe it's black, either way it's dark. A nice firm skim of foam on top that looks bright tan in color. No suds on the sides of this one. The suds become nothing after a bit. This one is all about the smell. It's rather tasty too, but the smell is killer. Scents include almond, coconut, coffee, vanilla and faint roast. They meld nice and are bright. BANG! Taste is even a impressive with flavors coming off baltic in a sense as the taste is rather large. Tastes bigger than it is alcohol wise. Big hits of almond and coconut, they are they main two. The coffee is roasted and bold with semi espresso tastes with vanilla. A small malty hit all around. The feel is a nice medium with adaquate carb that is not overkill. This is a killer lower ABV'ed porter with character, get on it quick."
""
""
""
""
"Couple of thoughts about this beer. Obviously, it's a fine beer, but I was amazed by the amount of flavor it delivered considering the (relatively) low alcohol. Also, drinkability was just off the charts; I could drink this all day. This beer really pushes the envelope (as did all the FB beers I've tried), and was just so much fun to drink. Kudos to the brewer for making such an ususual, yet still very fine beer."
"Pours a dark inky black with dense cap of small brown bubbles. Before the beer event got to my nose, I was excited as notes of Mounds candy bars began popping into my head. Full dark chocolate and coconut nose with notes of dark roasted espresso. Taste brings bitter dark roast espresso before ""mellowing"" into dark dark chocolate and coconut, maybe a hint of vanilla dark berries. Fuller side of medium bodied, smooth and creamy. Fantastic beer that smells sooo good, the taste almost cant live up to the hype without actually eating a Mounds bar."
""
""
"I have also had the Maple Bacon Coffee Porter on tap and I feel this beer is better. I can't wait to have more...unfortunately there won't be many opportunities for it up here in PA but I'll enjoy it while it's here for Beer Week! If you can get your hands on it, try it."
"Poured black with no head. Usually there is something, but nothing. The aroma was one of the best of any beer I have ever had. Lots of coconut, caramel, and coffee. The coffee was extremely fresh and the coconut was pungent. It smelled, and subsequently tasted like a mounds bar with coffee, except much better than any mounds bar or coffee I have had. The only complaint I would have is that It could have used a bit more of a heavy mouthfeel. Otherwise, it is astounding what this brewery could pack into 6.5%. I had high hopes for this beer and it without a doubt delivered."
"O-a delicious Porter, a great sipper. Makes me want to seek out the Maple Bacon Coffee"
"I'll put this one down as my favorite Funky Buddha beer."
"This was one of the better beers I have had this year. I would search this one out if you can."
""
""
"Overall, another fantastic beer from Funky Buddha. This one is delicious and unique. I look forward to having more in the future."
"D - Another very enjoyable brew from Funky Buddha. A bit more heft would make this world-class. I would have no problem drinking a bomber of this on my own. Hopefully the recipes translate when they get their production facility up and running."
""
"Pours a very dark brown with a dense ivory head. Huge aromas of coconut, chocolate, vanilla, and caramel. Like a liquid Mounds bar. Taste is spot-on with the nose, sweet and decadent with tons of coconut flavor. Medium-full bodied, with a creamy mouthfeel and good carbonation. Another amazing Funky Buddha beer, these guys easily stole the show this year."
""
""
""
"Overall: My first beer from Funky Buddha and I now understand why these guys are so damn hyped right now. Excellent stuff."
""
""
"Between EBF and tonight, I'm counting my blessings. Not nearly enough BAs have gotten to try these Funky Buddha masterpieces, and I'm glad I got to share two of them with friends this evening. Can't wait for them to expand!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Full-bodied, light effervescence and smoooth as silk. Nice coating of the tongue and palate. A hint of root beer shows briefly on the aftertaste. This is dessert for adults. I dare you not to love this beer."
"O - One of my favorites on-tap at Hunahpu's Day. I was left thinking, ""what the hell just happened there."" Definitely a standout on any tap list, and truthfully, one of the top beers there."
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer pours a near-black with a fluffy tan head. The smell on this one is ridiculous, coconut, chocolate and coffee come together just perfectly. The taste is almost as impressive and follows the aroma. The balance is wonderful, as the coconut and coffee stand out at first and the chocolate shows up in the finish. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I would like, but that's often a common complaint I have with porters. It certainly doesn't detract from the beer at all. Overall this beer is unique and fantastic, just the kind of thing Funky Buddha is known for. It's also very drinkable for such a crazy sounding beer- I instantly ordered another."
"Had during Brewvival 2012! Served from tap into a Brewvival sampler imperial pint. Poured pitch black with a half finger brown head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained good lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, vanilla, coffee, roasted malt, coconut, and chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, vanilla, coffee, roasted malt, white chocolate, and a hint of coconut. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very good brew. When I saw this one come up on the board at Funky Buddha's booth, I kind of batted my eyes at it thinking it was a Winter Warmer based on the name. But WOW! I'm glad I went back and had a go at it. This thing was insane as far as the flavors and aromas coming off of it. I don't know how they got the white chocolate flavor to stick in the flavor, but definite kudos to that one. A definite must try if you get the opportunity, which I hope to get again in the future."
""

""

"Great beer, which I could have gotten a growler to go. Check it out when you can."
"Overall: Very interesting flavor combination (of course, that's what Funky Buddha is known for); while I have a minor quibble with the mouthfeel, this is an outstanding beer"
