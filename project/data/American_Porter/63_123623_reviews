"Overall: Excellent imperial porter (not that I've ever had any others). Chocolate is up front, but not overpowering. Definitely a sipper - it took me about 30 minutes to go through 8 oz."
"Medium bodied with average carbonation. Leaves a lightly sticky feeling in the mouth. The alcohol is well hidden for a 10.8 % abv beer. Glad I had a chance to try this, and that I picked up some extra bottles as well."

"Pours a deep, rich chocolatey brown with similar colored head that faded almost immediately.  No collar or wisps or lacing but good legs.  Aroma is big on the chocolate, deeply roasted malt, molasses, and earthy from the barrels.  Taste is chocolate up front, tart pomegranate and a deep wet earthy malt base.  Great full body and clings the the sides of your mouth and tongue and very low carbonation."

"Overall               92/100"

"The palate opens sweet with honey, syrup cocoa and followed with pomegranate acidity, fruity, bright yet brooding. Cranberry flavor is mild, adding acidity and the intense sweetness does hide the flavor along with the Oregon provenance. Bourbon character is present as a mild vanilla character. Flabby on the mid palate with honey and sweetness, mildly oily. Full in body and mildly carbonated, this beer has a mildly boozy finish. Tannins are mild. Exciting but flawed at the same time."
"Drank fresh....fruit elements became too prominent as beer warmed....going to revisit after a year of age."

"I really liked this beer."
"O-This is a delicious desert beer with heavy fruit body. Would buy again just for after dinner."
""
""
"I do not think that I would buy it again, but that may be more a reflection on my own tastes than the quality of the beer itself."
""
"Aroma is chocolate, mocha, earth and dark malts. The flavor is dark malts, chocolate/cocoa, raspberries, mocha/coffee and a long and very acidic/tart finish."
"Im familiar with the past several years of the black butte reserve line and know that each year they do something a little different. While drinking this you could certainly tell there was a fruit addition to it. To only be reading it now, after the fact, makes a lot of sense. A nice one off that is worth trying if you get the chance (especially if its $6 a snifter on tap verse the typical $20 pricetag the bombers cost.)"

"Looks perfect. Deep brown, almost black, with some amber highlights and a nice thin head with excellent lacing. Nose is surprisingly subtle, sweet caramel, roastiness, some coffee. Flavor is excellent. Smooth, almost no sign of alcohol besides a little warmth. A nice, full, flavor, for a porter. Sweetness, roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, some dried fruit, like prunes or raisins. Really a nice beer - full, delicious, excellent for even a single person to put back. Full body, warming, lovely. Overall a really excellent beer. Not worth the price in DC ($17.50), but would love it if someone else paid!"
"overall: I'm thinking this"
""
""
"Pours a black brown with moderate head which persists.  Pleasant fruity, chocolate aroma.  Taste is sweet chocolate with a fruity midrange followed by a roasted malt finish. Very complex and enjoyable. The high ABV was not evident but clearly puts this brew in the Imperial Porter style."
""
"Pours a dark brown with khaki colored head. Slight bourbon (pretty weak), dark fruits, a hint of cocoa, and some spice on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with bourbon, dark fruits, and a little anise."
""
""
"Very dark with lots of sediment. Smells boozy and a little sweet. Has a strong bourbon flavor with pomegranate, vanilla, and molasses notes. Medium body. Overall very enjoyable!"
"Poured into a chalice a very nice dark brown color, with some very nice carbonation, with a one-finger creamy tan head, a very nice medium size island and some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, lots of dark stuff, vanilla, very slight bourbon note, fruity. The taste is pretty nice, malty, fruity, chocolate notes, sweet/vanilla, some bourbon. Medium body, with a very slight dry finish. Overall a very tasty brew. Been awhile since I've had another BB, nice to see it in the SLS here in Utah."
"Continues the trend of this beer getting sweeter each year (molasses, cocoa), and now they added cranberries. I appreciate the oak and vanilla notes from the Bourbon barrels, but wish it went back to the old coffee formula."

"I heard alot about these beers and was anxious to try one. They don't live up to the hype."
""
""
"On tap in winter 2014! Strong chocolate aroma with an instant tart cranberry fruit and chocolate taste.  Tart and then bourbon/chocolate flows in. Warming deep boozy finish and you are reminded that this is a >10% ABV brew. Mouth feel is chewy thick and sticky. Solid black brew with a moderate brown head.  They went all out this year and in my opinion its a huge success!"
""
""
""
""
"Would you like to drink a sour raspberry tart that took a quick dip in a bourbon barrel? I didn't think so."
"I would like to have had this stuff fresh. It's another argument against aging beers just because they have a high ABV. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Liticker's Liquor in San Diego."
""
""
""
"D: This was a delicious and refined brew, with well balanced scent and taste. The body was great, and the finish was smooth with fairly well hidden alcohol. So it was pretty easy to drink, but should be sipped. Would probably age well, but is already good to drink fresh. Solid."

"Enjoying this on Christmas Day while watching A Christmas Story...  Really nice brew from Deschutes...  I've had a few of this beer's younger brothers and this stands up very nicely, I will say...  The pomegranate and cranberry aspects that this brings really fits the day...  They are not overpowering at all but meld quite nicely with the chocolate and dark roasted flavors that the base offers up...  Brings to mind the chocolate covered cherries that my wife always eats this time of year although not nearly as sweet...  No trace of booze whatsoever...  Could be a touch thicker but I'm nitpicking here...  This is excellent..."

"This is an interesting brew, way more fruit and tart cranberry than I would have thought. The look is a little light and almost Orange on the edges, maybe a product of the additions. The smell is quite weak even with warming up but the barrel, slight smoke mixed with fruit, slight tart, and powdered cocoa are all there in a whisper. Taste follows suit with much more authority and a very interesting tart cranberry aftertaste after nice malty rich bourbon tinged front. Feel is solid for a porter and rolls over cleanly without much booze present, easier to drink than I expected. Awesome stuff."
""
""
"Overall - This is an excellent beer, though nothing like the price would suggest. Anchor Porter is easily as good, for half the price and more availability. I was kind of disappointed in Deschutes. Black Butte is an excellent beer by itself, no need to gussy it up. It is a good beer, just not a great beer like I expected."
""

"Solid BA Porter, but far too sweet for me to enjoy it more."

"a big fruity stout that hits all the spots, could use some more barrel but this one has plenty going for it, very nice indeed"

"I'm a little surprised - I was expecting something a whole lot sweeter, the malt and Bourbon calling the shots, but instead we get a complex (already!) array of dark sugary elements, one duly countered by wood, acerbic berry, and bristling alcohol alike.  No biggie, as this makes things more interesting, letting everything lay it all on the table, nowhere to hide, as such. I can't say that this is really all that easy to drink, but it's easier than it should be, if that makes any sense, and is probably leagues better than what poured freely upon repeal of the 18th Amendment."

"Chocolate, fig, raisins, roasted malt aromas.  Pours dark brown, a bit thin, not much head to speak of and what there is dissipates quickly.  Most a sweet taste, with sour and some bitterness filling in as it lingers on the palate.  A bit thin, reasonably carbonated.  It has a good finish, but could be a bit bigger."

"22 ounce wax capped bottle, label says best after 06/13/15.  Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with an inch tan head that stuck around a while.  There's also a good amount of lacing.  Aroma is nice, the brew smells like bittersweet and milk chocolate, molasses, burnt/charred malt, berries and vanilla.  The taste is nice too!  It tastes like bittersweet and milk chocolate, molasses, pomegranate, cranberry, burnt/charred malt, vanilla, and a bit of licorice and coffee.  There's a good mix of bitter, sweet, and tart flavors.  Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and coating with a moderate amount of carbonation.  I think it's an interesting (and tasty) brew, I'm glad I had this tonight.  Now I'm just not sure if I can wait until June or after to drink my other bottle!"
""

"O: Hmph. A little unbalanced on this one, maybe I really should have waited till next summer to drink it. Super bitter cocoa really overpowers this one. Not enough sweetness to balance it out, not by a long shot."
"Overall: A very unique  and very interesting Imperial Porter. The taste is so complex that it works very well. I would highly recommend getting the beer. I'll probably get another one to age it a little bit."

"Overall, this beer is hitting the spot and is truly, every bit deserving of the hype.  I am enjoying this beer and will be getting more for aging, it doesn't need it by any means but i can't cut ties this early in the relationship!!!  Enjoy!"

"Deschutes, in the pursuit of experimentation, delivers the biggest let down of the anniversary series. The molasses and cranberries throw everything off. The nose is muddled and muddy. You can taste the cranberries, molasses, and pomegranate, but what a weird blend. The roasted malts that make these anniversary beers so appealing are barely noticeable. A weird beer, and not very drinkable."

"Despite being impressed by a few of the pieces, I do not like this. If I'd spent less money on it, I wouldn't have finished the bottle. It's like two beers in one, and they're not friends."

"Aromas of dark fruit, cranberry, pomegranate, cherry, chocolate, caramel and a little booze as it warmed. Pours pitch black with a tan head and, being unfiltered, I did notice some floaties lurking in the glass. Undeterred I sipped and man is this one heck of a beer. Cranberry is very present to the taste and contributes an excellent tartness, also big time chocolate, espresso, roast, and oak. Alcohol was untraceable but it came out a bit as it warmed, and this beer was quite sweet. It was full bodied but actually felt a little light in the mouth I thought, something which lent it a high level of drinkability, and it was creamy. Overall I really liked this beer quite a bit, I can't wait to see how it mellows with age. This is a release I look forward to every year."
""
"Overall - The fruit seemed subtle at first but definitely got stronger as it warmed.  It's an interesting addition, but doesn't help a beer that could use some richness."

"O - I really enjoyed the complexity of this beer.  This is an excellent sipping beer where you are rewarded for going slow and allowing all the flavors to play out in your mouth.  Sorry but this is not a beer for newbies.  Anyone who likes porters and stouts should give this a try."
"I feel that the robust, warm, stout flavors were tainted by the fruitiness of the cranberries and pomegranate rather then complimented. The effect is reminiscent of watered down chocolate covered cranberries. The general experience is positive but nothing special IMO."

"Gave this one a blanket 4 when tasted on tap right after release. Revisiting on tap and comparing to 25. The bourbon/alcohol is still pretty hot. Could use a little age but to take off the edge. Similar to last years version, notes of chocolate, sweet ripe fruits on top of a bit of vanilla and a fair amount of bourbon come together in this beer. Given the taste, I'm going to sit on my bottles for at least a year to let the booze subside a bit before cracking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
" The taste has a lovely woody and malty richness with sweet flavor and mild bourbon and oak coming through with woodiness and lightly fruity complexity with a bourbon depth combined with vanilla and berry taste with a slight molassess edge with slight toasty character. The malt has a light roasted quality and bean-like flavor of cocoa in the finish with the flavor of all ingredients integrated well with boubon very enjoyable as a major component of the taste. This is very enjoyable in every way-plenty of layers of flavor including a copious amount of bourbon and wood -pretty smooth for 10%"

"Deschutes is one of those breweries that can take everything here, and meld it into one balanced treat.  In the hands of a lesser brewery, this would be an absolute mess.  Big and bruising, but at the same time nuanced.  In the same vain as Prairie Noir...while not as vinous, the tart fruits are amazing.  Everything just melds together perfectly.  Well done."

"Overall this is a pretty good beer, kind of a different take on the style. it is very drinkable for the abv, one of the few beers of this strength that goes down so easily. Just be warned this beer is a bit sweet, if that is not your thing, you likely won't care for it, but I enjoyed it, and can best describe it as liquid  chocolate candy."

"Let this warm up, even coming off of ale temps, this didn't flatter this beer so much.  Very nice, but not as good a past iterations.  Not a huge fan of cranberries, so maybe that's it?  I'm sure it will age great"
""
""
"The craftsmanship on this beer is extremely impressive. I suppose I'm personally not crazy about the use of pomegranate and cranberries, but they pull it off. It's a unique take on the style."
""
""
""
"Impressive balance of uncommonly used fruits and a bourbon barrel porter."
"Nice pour. Non transparent, just shy of pure black with a light kahki head that hangs around for the whole ride. Smells wonderful. Nice even bourbon/oak  aroma with some chocolate and molasses. The taste does not quite live up to the nose hype. Not exactly sure what pomegranite is since I dont partake, but I am assuming it is the dark, sour fruit I am tasting, cranberry like. Not a big fan. Also, the bourbon seems to disappear into the background. Otherwise I dont get much roasted malt, smokiness,or robust flavor. Just sweetness. A vanilla and burnt sugar, but over the top. Somehow it tastes too sweet and too sour at the same time. Has the body of regulat Black Butte. A good beer, but based on my expectations (highly regarded brewery) and the aroma, I was a little disappointed."

"I definitely enjoy how you can pick out cranberry and pomegranate at one point. The whiskey, cocoa and roast grains balance out nicely and this is just an interesting, enjoyable experience."
""
"how cool to get to drink this one on tap. pomegranate molasses is a huge flavor in this beer. the sweet and tart complexion from it are so cool in a porter. for one, its that unrefined sugar thing,  almost tropical or island feeling, and then the tartness of the fruit which is very autumnal and thanksgiving feeling, a cool geo-temporal juxtaposition! the base porter is of course fantastic, a little lighter on the roast and attendant bitterness than other vintages, maybe intentionally so for the fruit, and it works. the beer is sweet throughout though, which gets a little geavy about halfway through a glass. the cranberry gets more prominent when it warms, as does the bitter element of the cocoa. bourbon influence is only moderate. more an integrator of ingredients than a flavor agent here i think. less body too than i remember from others, but overall a truly unique a delicious beer. deschutes can do no wrong for me."

"Overall - Good, but not 'blow your socks' off amazing. Reminiscent of those sweet chocolate liqueur candies that somehow end up in stockings come Christmas; the Gran Marnier flavor comes to mind. A bit hot for my tastes as is, but it should age nicely; thankfully I found this on tap so I can save my bottle for a year or two."

"The flavor is chocolate forward with a milk chocolate Hershey's Kiss quality. The barrel blends in a coconut flavor, some vanilla and a bourbon esque taste. All the while there's a tangy fruit center, much like a chocolate covered strawberry. This is dessert in a bottle!"
"Pours black with a khaki head. Aroma is roasty, some chocolate, and pomegranate. Flavor starts off with the pomegranate, roastiness, and chocolate, then a touch of bitter earthiness  and it closes out with the cranberry. Couldn't find much barrel here. A creamy, medium body. Overall, I have not been much of a fan of either of the Black Butte anniversary beers I have tried and probably won't bother trying a third, unless the recipe is one that appeals more to me. Wouldn't drink this again and do regret that I chose to buy this."
""
""

"Rich dark roast, chocolate, some coffee, alcohol,barrel aged. Thick feel. Fairly bitter finish. Some licorice."
"The most amazing porter I've ever had would buyagain and again"
""
""
""
""
""
"The tart cranberries are apparent right up front on the first sip and then mellows as you get further into the glass. The bourbon barrel aging becomes apparent as the beer warms up. Spice and molasses are after notes that make this a highly desirable limited release."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor smacks you in the face with rich, dark chocolate, supported by a roast malt backbone that adds just enough bitterness to dry out the finish. Cranberry and pomegranate tartness are subtle initially, but then blend well with the roast as they emerge.  Bourbon and vanilla weave throughout. Really a nice beer that should age well. Not overly alcoholic. Really like that chocolatey dominance."

"Had an 8oz @Mellow Fellow-Truckee. A great tap room. Smooth, not hot, cocoa sweetness is tasty. Didn't get much cranberry. All in all a well balanced porter."

"O - between two of us, we drain poured 3/4 of the bottle.  The cranberry is way too intense and ruins the beer by its dominating presence.  I see no way aging will improve this bottle in the next couple of years.   Sad drain pour of $15.   The only way I can see myself enjoying this would be at thanksgiving dinner."

"Overall (4.5), this is another great entry in the Black Butte anniversary series. I'm having a hard time remembering my feelings for XXV when fresh, but this one is certainly close to it's equal. I love the fact that the pomegranate molasses provides a fruity sweetness that seems ideally suited to blend with the roasty flavors of the porter, while the cranberries provide just a bit of brightness as a complement. It was surprisingly easy to down an entire bottle of this myself during the course of a movie. I'll certainly be excited to see how this one drinks once it hits its prime in a year (if I can hold off on opening more between now and then)."
""
""
"The bourbon is much more pronounced in the nose than the taste! The sweet red fruit flavors of the pomegranate and cranberry overpower this brew in my opinion. Was expecting them to compliment the coffee-mocha-vanilla-bourbon flavors rather than be at the forefront. Honestly they could have been there in the same intensity just minus the sweetness. It tastes like a cranberry %60 Cocoa bar, which isn't a bad thing at all. But for my personal taste I would want it more leaning towards %80 Cocoa and coffee flavors."

"Pours a medium browns, little bit of transparency.  Smells of cranberry and dark fruit... the taste is mostly molasses and the perfect amount of cranberry.  This is delicious... dark, warm and medium mouthfeel, with a perfect dark fruit subtlety.  The bourbon is really taking a back seat in this one.  Cheers!"
""
""

"Bittered with earthy coffee and campfire, a burnt pinecone taste pulls from the ash and achieves a slight semblance of dryness with spicy curracao liquor and spiced rum to finish and echoes of chocolate covered cherries to return in aftertaste."

"Overall: Another great imperial version of one of the better Porters out there. Nicely complex and rich mix of dark malt, bourbon, and fruit notes."
"A very good beer that puts this series back on the right track. But, Deschutes? I've loved a lot of your beers over the years, like, Magic Johnson-level love. So I say this with all due respect: quit putting bloody fucking fruit in Black Butte. Pretty please?"

"Deschutes Black Butte XXVI ---4.5/5"
""
"Pours a dark cola brown with some light passage and some tan head. A bit light for style. The nose is nice. Chocolate and cranberry sing in harmony up front. The cranberry lacks the acidic punch it has on its own and supports the cocoa and roasted notes well. Vanilla presents itself with a strong creamy character. The barrel character is tame but present in the form of a little bit of oaky char. Taste is much like the smell. Dark chocolate, then cranberry, then vanilla, and a hint of barrel on the finish. The body seems light considering this is a barrel aged porter, but it doesn't get in the way of the overall quality. This is a very successful anniversary reserve from Deschutes, my favorite one in recent memory. The good news is this is pretty easily attainable."
""
""
""
""
"O- At first I was a bit put off by the strong molasses smell and my first few sips I was hesitant. Thankfully as the beer warmed the flavors really came out nicely and rounded out to make what is a really complex beer without any of the flavors stepping too heavily on each other. Definitely glad I got to experience this one."

"The main thing I struggle with here is the price point. I really wonder if it's truly worth the 14.99 a bomber I paid (on sale). There are other porters or similar brews with clearly excellent qualities that would rival this beer in taste, if not in ABV, and are available at a much lower price. Because of this, I dinged it a little on the overall score. Perhaps I'll experiment with another bottle after it has aged thoroughly in my basement."
""
"O- very tasty beer, definitely a desert beer, perfect for special occasions or a night cap. Label says "" best after 6-14-15, so I have one stashed away in the aging section of my garage fridge."

"My old man and I drank this early but couldn't wait to try. Will without a doubt age nicely. There was still to much carbonation. However, the pomegranate and cranberries were very prominent. Great chocolate notes. This is a fantastic beer. I will age another for a year or so that I have no doubt will be even better."

"Great smell and taste. The downside is the unsightly appearance and thin prickly body."
"O- the flavors are intense but should mellow out nicely over time, too much tartness. I think they over did it a little with having two bitter fruits but it's still very good. The anniversary series ages better than any beer I've ever had so this has potential to be world class a year down the road, but is very good as of now."

"Overall, like all the other BB annis I'm not crazy about them at first, but can really see the potential they'll have once they hit the best after date. The flavors stick out in different directions but you can get a sense of how they'll taste when they finally start meeting up, same goes with the feel. Worth buying at least 2, I can't think of a better beer that evolves as it ages. I'll come back to this guy in a year or two"

"A very smooth taste. Bourbon comes in with a nice spice. I get very little beery flavor. I even get a slight bubble gum flavor coming through. I think this beer will age well. This is a huge chocolate flavored porter. It gains a better character as the beer warms."
""
"Overall, this beer seems a bit under matured. I imagine with some age the booze will dissipate and it will drink more smoothly. I'm curious to see how the berry-flavors develop and what becomes of the chocolate that is somewhat faint now. 4"

"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours pitch black with a fine two finger light brown head with great retention and lots of pillowy lacing. Delicious aroma of sweet dark toasted malt, chocolate, light fruit, vanilla, a hint of bourbon. Flavor is dark toasted malt, light fruit with cranberry tartness, vanilla, hints of dark dried fruit, bourbon, chocolate. Medium bodied with a pleasant creaminess, nice mouth feel. I have to say that I was on a roller coaster ride with this one. The aroma is fantastic and the initial taste of malt, fruit and vanilla is very nice, then the cranberry comes in to add a bit a tartness and part of me wants to wallow in dark malt for a while without the tartness, but when the finish rolls around, there is a great aftertaste of sweet vanilla toasted malt and pure, fresh cranberry that is quite satisfying. In general I'm not a fan of tartness in porters and stouts unless it is carefully restrained. XXVI skates to the edge of that flavor preference and pulls it out in the finish. Complex, interesting and as always, one of the great beers produced in our hemisphere. I'm going to take the chance that this will not become too tart in the future and will cellar a few to try again."

"I could easily see how this would be a love/hate brew. I personally wish Deschutes would stop adding fruit to both BlackButte Aniv. Brews and Abyss... This brew would be fantastic poured over vanilla ice cream. This is a great brew, but previous vintages have topped it *eh-hem* XX... Very similar to BCBSBYR, but not as good ;)"
"O - Wouldn't buy again. My roommate like it, I couldn't finish my glass."

"It is still a great looking brew with that near pitch black darkness and ample head of tan foam. The smell is not unlike previous editions with loads of cocoa, plenty of bourbon, some roast, and something else.that fruity non goodness. Thick and rich body, this is the ONLY anniversary Black Butte that didn’t tickle my fancy right off the bat."
