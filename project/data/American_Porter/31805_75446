3.03,-32.7,3.75,3.25,2.75,3.25,3,"Easy drinking beer, which got a decent complexity to it, turning out a bit too thin and metallic during the finish. Also the bitterness is a bit too harsh, compared to the weaker implemented sweeter flavors of the beer, initially promising a decent balance. The beers interaction between coffee, bitter chocolate and slightly wooden coconuts is very enjoyable though, while the brew remains recognizable as a Porter.","aleigator","Monday at 08:41 PM"

Not smelling or tasting much coffee in this porter. Lots of milk chocolate and vanilla flavor and aroma. Medium bodied porter with very creamy, decadent mouthfeel, and near perfect carbonation levels. Funky Buddha Last Snow proves to me that no one else can do such great porters that are brewed with adjuncts. I thought Maple Bacon Coffee porter was excellent porter, well Last Snow is even better!

The nose wreaks strongly of coconuts upfront followed by coffee and some chocolate as it warms. The taste reminds me most of samoas, but I can definitely see the "liquid mounds bars" description. As expected, coconut dominates the flavor profile, but the taste does transition to burnt toffee, caramel sweetness and bitter coffee in the finish. Although it's a porter, I'd anticipated more body to match the beer's heavy flavors. The carbonation is low (better than mbcp) as is the bitterness and like magic, every flavor seems to be distinct and noticeable (except for the subtle cocoa buttery richness emblematic of white chocolate). The roasted malt in the finish is all that remains of the beer's fleeting porter base. I'll admit, this is an exceptional beer, which I would definitely recommend to others, but slightly prefer mbcp","ThePorterSorter","Beers"

The taste isn't far off from the smell.  Last Snow is a great smelling, great tasting porter.  Just wish that it was a little bit thicker and stayed on the tongue longer.  A lot of brewers make really unbalanced coffee beers, but I feel like this one is spot on.  Well done, Funky!  Now I need to find some MBCP :D.","ajwalls257","Feb 25, 2015"

4.7,4.4,4.25,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.75,"one of the best porters i have ever had, and certainly the best use of coconut in a beer that i can think of. its so coconut forward. looks dark brown, chocolaty, obviously stained from the coffee, because the body on this is not all that heavy. its also not all that sweet, which shocks me considering the ingredients added here. i think the white chocolate is a perfect contrast to the dark roasty bitter malts and coffee intensity. it gives a buttery richness to the feel, a milky character to the flavor, and is a perfect platform for the coconut to cling on to. my mom works in hawaii sometimes, and she always brings me good kona coffee. this reminds me of that, the coconut medium roast blend, where both elements contribute equally to a much greater whole. im not really getting caramel here, but i dont want to get it. this doesnt need to be sweeter or richer, i think it finds a near perfect balance of textures and sugars that needs nothing. dusty almost in the finish, with a dryer coffee chocolate thing coming out, and after the swallow all i taste is the coconut. i love this beer, and wish i could get it regularly. these guys have a great reputation, so im stoked my first couple of beers from them were as good as suggested. this is genius.","StonedTrippin","Oct 21, 2014"

The nose carries heavy, heavy chocolate along with a touch of underlying roast. Mild coconut in the background. Then more chocolate. Hersey-syrup-type chocolate. A bit cloying as it warms a bit. Flavor is more heavy chocolate with some underlying coconut character. Some roasted malt beneath. This is a hard one to score as there really isn’t much underlying beer; it’s really heavy chocolate, though not what you’d get from chocolate malt. I can’t knock the nose too much, as it was really wonderful, but have taken that into account in my overall score.","Thorpe429","Nov 01, 2012"

The nose comprises sweet cocoa, coconut, coffee, light molasses, and a kiss of almond. The end result is Christmas happiness in a glass. Up my nose. Something like that. The taste thankfully brings in more of the same, along with a toastier coconut component and the addition of some nutty toffee, completing the image of holiday frivolity made manifest in deliciousness. Oh yeah. The body is a hefty-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally smooth feel. Overall, a downright damn-good beer, one I wish I had many, many more bottles of for future enjoyment.

Taste is a little weak but this is not an imperial stout. Thinner than expected with rich frappacino character. The rich Dunkin Donuts iced coffee nose and taste is uncanny but still a bit contrived for me. Could simply be not even a beer if it were given to me blind. Delicious. Tangy lactic palate.

The chooclate is so prominent that it almost tastes like a syrup was added. This is nicely complimented by a coconut milk presence that lingers over the roasted notes Ito a sweet and slightly dry finish. There's a nice roasted malt presence underneath that cuts some of the sweetness and makes it tastes more like a porter. Some robust coffee bean flavor along with dark chocolate, oatmeal, caramel and toffee. Still really sweet but just enough roast to keep it from becoming overwhelming and one dimensional. Another really nice beer from Funky Buddha.","corby112","Aug 03, 2012"

No suds on the sides of this one. The suds become nothing after a bit. This one is all about the smell. It's rather tasty too, but the smell is killer. Scents include almond, coconut, coffee, vanilla and faint roast. They meld nice and are bright. BANG! Taste is even a impressive with flavors coming off baltic in a sense as the taste is rather large. Tastes bigger than it is alcohol wise. Big hits of almond and coconut, they are they main two. The coffee is roasted and bold with semi espresso tastes with vanilla. A small malty hit all around. The feel is a nice medium with adaquate carb that is not overkill.

Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I would like, but that's often a common complaint I have with porters. It certainly doesn't detract from the beer at all.

Maintained good lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, vanilla, coffee, roasted malt, coconut, and chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, vanilla, coffee, roasted malt, white chocolate, and a hint of coconut. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very good brew. When I saw this one come up on the board at Funky Buddha's booth, I kind of batted my eyes at it thinking it was a Winter Warmer based on the name. But WOW! I'm glad I went back and had a go at it. This thing was insane as far as the flavors and aromas coming off of it. I don't know how they got the white chocolate flavor to stick in the flavor, but definite kudos to that one.
