"Poured into a pint glass. Gives about a one inch head nice and creamy and dense. The taste is as it is named. Vanilla java porter. Like it. Good job to the brewers. I'll have more of this."

""
""
""
"Excellent balance between vanilla and stout."
""
""
"Love it. Like the vanilla with the porter"
""
"This is a great porter bottle notched at jan 15 poured into a sniffer drank half of it cold taste like vanilla coffe with slight carbonation this is a solid coffe porter"
""

"A ton of vanilla, light roasted malts, and a hint of chocolate. Had this on tap after eddy fitz and i should have just stuck with the latter. Not bad though, just doesn't have a chance next to the best"
""
""
""
""
"O: not all that complex; very thin for the style; also a little light on the bitterness for my taste;"
""
"Pours dark and thick into a snifter. A half inch of creamy head lingers. It smells delicious and the taste matches.Not sure why the consensus rating is so low. Solid coffee porter"
""
"The best beer ever made!"
""
""
"O- Smells and Tastes wonderful but lacks depth which makes this beer a good choice but there is better out there. When I read vanilla java porter I expected something strong and satisfying but instead I got a beer that I could sit and watch a show with."
"Great beer if you love dark beer. Recommend to all. Everyone I know loves it."
""
""
""
""
""
"I love the coffee and vanilla accents in the flavor. Great beer to sip on and really feel. One of my favorites hands down"
""
"I agree with some other reviewers. I really liked this beer and my faves are typically Irish stouts. I found the finish to be much less sweet than the initial aroma, which I must say put me off a tad initially. I've had 4 more since my initial taste in early Feb. 2015. My only suggestion is that you may not want to order this pre-dinner, as it is a sweeter beer."
"O- Smells good but there isn't not much else that's exceptional about this beer."
""
""
"I can't figure out why the review on this beer is so low. .  .I think it is very tasty and would recommend it to any Stout drinker.  I just think to many beer drinkers now a days are sucking on IPA's a little to much and ruining their taste buds."
""

"I have been a big fan of porters and stout beers for the past few months.  I love the hints of coffee and the thickness you get from a porter.  After drinking this one I think I have found a new favorite.  You can absolutely taste the vanilla and the coffee flavor is a little more pronounced than in other porters.  The mouth feel is nice and thick an heavy.  The smell is almost like that of an Irish coffee.  This is a great beer to try if you are a fan of the Leinenkugel's Snowdrift Vanilla Porter."
"If you like coffee, more specifically vanilla flavored coffee, you will probably like this. I love coffee and this is fairly good. My only problem with this beer is that the flavor is not strong enough. The flavor itself is good but it's a little weak. This is a porter for the wussies! Hardly any bitterness at all. But without judging it for what it is, it's definately not bad."
""
"Nice vanilla taste, wished it would have been a smooth beer with a vanilla aroma, got tired of it pretty quickly, thought it was better the first time I had it??"
""
"This is one of the few Atwater brews I actually like. It's a decent brew, and a great value if you're looking for a vanilla/java stout type beer."
""
""
""
""
"I didn't look favorably upon this one.  All sorts of head retention and appearance were off on a style that I didn't think could really vary in appearance.  It smelled okay.  Taste was predominately vanilla, but sortof a fake, superficial vanilla.  Feel was thin and oily.  No substance.  My friend gave me two.  I'm not sure what to do with the second."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"To me it's similar to Leinenkugel's Snowdrift Vanilla Porter"
""
"New to trying porters and this is very good. I usually don't like coffee porters/stouts but this is a lighter coffee flavor, but still nice and dark beer. Probably a very personal rating, not so objective."
""
""
""
"D. F-Ing. Litious. Best straight from the brew house!"
""
""
""
""
"Just started trying porters so I'm no expert but I thought this beer and tasted great. I enjoyed it."
"(Overall) Not a bad beer.  Definitely not worthy of a case, but for once if I got this in a variety pack as a Porter I think I'd be alright with it.  Overall, I do think it's missing some complexity, the vanilla and coffee is certainly subtle (I appreciate that it's not overdone) but it absolutely could have been played up some more."
""
""
""
""
"I am surprised by the ratings I truly enjoyed this one. The taste smell and feel did it for me. I would have a second round for sure!"
""
""
"This was pretty disappointing.  The dark color and roasted coffee / chocolate smell belied the relatively thin flavor and feel of this beer."
""
"Pretty much the porter equivalent of Bud Light, or worse."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very watery porter.  Taste of vanilla, hints of coffee, and not much else.  Another misfire from a below average brewery."
""
""
""
"Very smooth, easy to drink. Strong hints of coffee and vanilla."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Black as night. No head. Aroma of coffee, vanilla chocolate & malt. Vanilla dominates the taste and the coffee mixes in nicely. Light on hops. Super smooth, rich brew. Wonderful sipping beer."
""
"Tastes more like a vanilla milkshake than a beer."
""
"Overpowering vanilla and not much else.  Thin, watery, ambiguous identity."
"Tastes like I'm drinking coffee beans and not a beer."
"Smooth rich taste. Drank about 12 now and the taste was consistent. Had moreof a coffee than vanilla taste."
"Our team really likes this beer.  The only thing we've noticed is the batches aren't consistent.  Varying amounts of vanilla and coffee.  Seems Atwater is trying to find the right balance."
""

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled in 10/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear very dark brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, brown bread, vanilla, light nuttiness, light herbal, and toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and coffee/vanilla spice notes; with decent strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, vanilla, toast, brown bread, light nuttiness, light herbal, and toasted earthiness. Light coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, vanilla, toast, brown bread, light nuttiness, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good complexity and solid robustness of dark/roasted malt and vanilla/coffee spice flavors; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very solid spiced porter style. All around good robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/roasted malt and vanilla/coffee spice flavors; and very smooth and easy to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."
""
""
"Overall- A decent porter but the coffee taste is quite strong. If you like coffee beers this would be a good one. I would of liked a little more complexity but it was ok."

"the mouthfeel is a little weak but overall very tastym"
""
"I've had really good experiences with this beer, despite reviews about poor quality control. This is a nice rich beer with a great coffee after taste that isn't too overpowering."
""
"Tastes like a vanilla infused dark roast (almost overburnt coffee really..) but otherwise it's alright."
""

""

""
""
""
"I was pleasantly surprised."
""
""

"Eh. 1 out of the first 5 of the case was bad, like rotten milk bad. The bottle seemed sealed if I remember correctly, but it was off by far.  I had a few that tasted pretty solid. Another go at the case on a different night had me pour out 3 of them because they seemed flat/tasteless. Of the ones that seem ok, the mouth feel is a bit watery. Vanilla extract is prominent. Coffee? I don't taste much coffee, maybe it is the base and the vanilla is up front, I don't know. I am concerned with what I feel is a lack of consistency bottle to bottle. If I didn't waste so many already, I'd probably return the case, although I have never had to do that before. If I had to give advice, I'd say avoid it. The best I have tasted in this category is Wolaver's Alta Gracia Coffee Porter. Breckenridge Vanilla Porter is also solid, but no coffee there."
""
"Pretty good for a coffee porter. I'm usually not a coffee beer guy. I like coffee and I like beer, but usually the two shant mix. This is a decent malty beer, goes down smooth. My one complaint would be the lack of ...robust... flavor. It was in the single digits with a nasty wind chill. I could have had something a bit more warming."

"I like this better than I like this brewery's chocolate stout.  This tastes more like beer with the coffee/caramel/vanilla notes.  Carbonation seems to settle down also as it warms.  Pretty good stuff.  I wouldn't rush out to buy another one, but I wouldn't turn my nose up at it either."
"Atwater Vanilla Java Porter -----4/5."
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a ""pint"" glass. Pours pitch black with a brown head that dissipates quickly. Smells of coffee, not much else. Tastes of coffee with some vanilla and very slight berry. Beer is light/medium bodied, good carbonation, great finish. Overall an above average beer."
""
""
""
""
"This beer is ok"
""
"Overall:  This is a pretty tasty beer.  Good flavors of malt and coffee and vanilla, all nicely balanced into a pretty tasty beer.  Nothing spectacular, but recommended to try once for any porter fans out there."
""
"Black pour with a small tan head that dissipates quickly. Very mild vanilla aroma. Flavor has a nice creamy vanilla flavor upfront backed by a little coffee and semi-sweet chocolate. Light bodied and fairly thin for a porter with medium carbonation. As the beer warms a light roasted malt bitterness comes through as well as a little more chocolate. Good flavors but would be better with a fuller body."

"Overall I would buy a six pack of these for sure again. It is an easy drinking beer, Great for all us third shift Zombies who crave a beer with our breakfast. I think this is my second or third porter style beer, It would be a great beer to introduce to someone who has not Tried a Porter or a stout Before because it is pretty solid but not too overpowering in the flavor department which can turn some people off."

""
""
""

"O - A good, solid beer. I'd love to put down a sixer of this stuff. I would definitely buy it again."
""
""
""
"This beer is dark brown, with a vanilla aroma to it. It also has notes of chocolate and roast melt to it. Th finish has aroasted coffee tast to it. It has a chocolate taste through the whole beer. It has more of a vanilla taste then a coffee taste to it."
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown, vanilla aroma, with notes of chocolate and roast malt. The flavor reveals light roast malt, a touch of a tangy character, and a roasty coffee finish. Notes of chocolate wave throughout. More vanilla than coffee, which makes me happy. Probably my second favorite from Atwater, as I like the voodoo, as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'd never refuse a free one. It's not making me retch. It's also better than the last Atwater I had yesterday (so is just about every other beer I've had in the past couple months). But as a porter, it's just not particularly successful. Not only does the dominant flavor come off as artificial, there's literally nothing else to it. Dare I say it tastes like a porter that would come from Blue Moon or Shock Top? Yep, I'm totally saying it. It's going to take a lot for Atwater to get back in my good graces after 2 stinkers."

"I'm not much of a stout/porter person but this one was very good. Tasted it when it became available on tap at the bar I work at. Very smooth and creamy taste. Lots of coffee and chocolate taste in this stout. Not so heavy where it's unpleasant to eat with food. Overall a good beer for either dinner or desert."
""
""
"Overall: Delicious! I am not a huge fan of Porter's but this one got my attention--really appreciate the coffee undertones (I'm a coffee addict), and it's a great beer to pair with food as well"

"I really wanted to like this -- porter, coffee, vanilla -- what's not to like? But the overall impression is too thin and watery. Also the vanilla seems somehow artificial. When I tried my first bottle I was underwhelmed so I waited a week and tried another bottle, this time letting it warm some. That helped a bit but I'm still disappointed by the thin body and not enough complexity."
""
""
""
"The taste...Not much vanilla (slight) or coffee. Mildly bitter in the finish. Pretty weak."
""
""
"Overall: As I said this was the beer that introduced my to the craft beer world. While it's no longer my favorite, I will still gladly drink this beer with enjoyment."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A decent vanilla porter, but not great. This is a sweet, mildly roasted, vanilla porter, which is truthfully just not my style, but I'm glad I tried it. It was enjoyable, to taste, but I really think to get into it, one needs to be a fan of this style."
""
""
""
"O - terrific beer mostly because of its complex taste. One of my favorites!"

"Decent beer, but nothing to write home about."
""
""
""
""
"Had this on tap at Hops and Crafts in Nashville. Pretty nice sweet porter. Roasted malts and strong but not overpowering vanilla notes. I didn't get as much coffee flavoring as I'd expected. Very creamy mouthfeel. Dark brown color with a light tan head. I think a little underrated."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: For a stylized beer, this isn't bad. Definitely brings both vanilla and java, if unbalanced and without much depth besides those notes. Wouldn't recommend it to people looking for traditional, balanced beers, but for equally unbalanced pairings (ice cream, chocolate brownie, a dessert by itself) I would suggest a tasting."
"Presentation: Packaged in a standard twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
"Overall: A straightforward porter that won’t make a meal by itself. It’s got a good flavor, and drinks smoothly, but I find myself wanting a bit more complexity. Probably a good party beer."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""

"I loved the smell of this beer, but it was a little much for me. Maybe it's just a taste I have to get used to. I didn't really taste much of the vanilla, but there was definitely a very strong coffee taste- but black coffee. I have a few bottles left, so maybe I'll experiment with it. Overall, not bad at all, just not my favorite!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is vanilla beer with slight bitterness from coffee after taste. Mouthfeel is thin compared to most. Overall this is not offensive in any way and somewhat easy to drink compared to most porters since it seems somewhat ""light"". I would prefer more malt."
""
""
"But still, even on the light side, this was full of flavor. The vanilla didn't come out as much as the strong coffee, taste and the java was so smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
" Something different. Ok to try. Sounds a lot better than it taste"
""
""
""
""
"O: recommended for fans of dark vanilla ales. Don't expect much coffee aroma or flavor."
""
""
""
""
"There is definitely vanilla, but I did not even get a hint of java. Most important, the porter qualities are lacking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Just falling short of the whole mark as far as this one goes, I thought I used to like this from times past, but I'd rather have Brackenridge's version of this any day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: There are many better offerings for the porter style; I'll pick one of those up next time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is good, non-offensive or overwhelming. Again, not quite what I look for in a porter. If comparing it to Breckenridge's Vanilla Porter, there is no contest. Still, it is a tad sweet and quite drinkable. I'll probably try it on tap again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Have never been to Atwater, but hope to make a stop on next beercation in that area."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Despite all of its flaws, I honestly like this beer. It's easy to drink, fairly flavorful, and pulls off the coffee-beer balance. Not a favorite or anything but I'd have it again."
""
""
""
""
"Barf. Between this and the ""Decadent Dark Chocolate"" disaster I can't say that I have any desire to buy Atwater again."
""
"very dark brown, almost black. little head. sweet vanilla aroma. sugary, but not really any coffee. taste is more balanced, starts a bit sweet, finishes slightly roasty. medium to thicker body, medium to higher carbonation. overall just an okay porter."
""
""
""
"While the overall beer drinking experience lives up to its ""Vanilla Java Porter"" title well, it is never overly impressive. It is very drinkable, I could see myself enjoying a six pack throughout an evening, but the flavor is weaker than I was hoping for."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a smooth beer and would be good for dessert or BBQ. I'd get it again."
""
"Thinner black. Ring of foam around the glass. Nose is mainly vanilla extract with some malty sweetness and molasses. The flavor is good, but watered down. Blend of coffee with sweet malts and vanilla extract. Some roastiness on the finish. The body is quite thin also which detracts from the overall beer. Not bad, but needs body."
""
""
""
""
"O: A mediocre offering that could really be amazing with more body, coffee, and vanilla."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Medium bodied, lightish effervescence. Drying. A decent brew but not not great."

"On another day, I might have found the vanilla flavor to be too overpowering. The vanilla taste is really, really predominant. Still, it works and as my numerical ratings indicate, it is a beer that adds up to more than the sum total of its parts. I enjoyed it, but I'm not sure of the conditions under which I would order it again."

"Dark brown with a small, but nicely creamy beige head. Sweet vanilla bean aroma with undertones of chocolate and roasted coffee beans. Roasted barley, watery coffee bitterness, and a much lighter vanilla presence. Easy to pound and not particularly nasty in any way. Thin and a little astringent. It's okay, but you can tell that without the coffee and vanilla extract, the base beer would be a very weak porter."

"It's just not that good. Buying was fun. Drinking was tolerable and inoffensive (at least not a drainer). That aftertaste though... no good, leaves me needing to replace the aftertaste with something else. I won't be buying more, but I'm still ok knowing I at least tried it, and I don't feel that I wasted money when buying this one."
""
""
"Would not buy again."
""

"A very delicious beer! Very smooth taste, no bitterness. Almost like drinking an actual java. A little filling, but that's to be expected from a porter.A nice social beer or during meal beer. Great work Atwater!!! I look forward to trying more of your craft beers."
""

"I don't know how they did it but they snuck 6% alcohol into something that tastes more like soda pop than beer. Which in itself isn't such a turnoff, but the flavors seem so fake and off. So much promise in the name, so little delivery. Though my wife (who doesn't really drink beer) loves it, so that's a plus."

"Ah, one of the first bottles I ever bought at a Total Wine during my NoVa days has come here to the Midwest for me to try again. Let's do this shit: It pours a clear midnight sienna topped by a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises vanilla, light buttercream, light toasted caramel, and a hint of marshmallow. It's not that things smell off, they just smell somewhat artificial, somewhat ill-fitting. I dunno. The taste holds notes of light roasted malts, fake vanilla, light vinyl, and a twinge of toasted marshmallow. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a thinly fluid feel. Overall, this stuff has definitely gone downhill since I first tried it those few years ago. It's overly thin, thoroughly artificial, and even a bit plastic-y. Quite a downer, folks..."
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours a dark brown color with a slight, beige head. The scent is not very strong but contains hints of coffee, caramel malts, and vanilla. The taste and texture are much weaker than I would expect from this porter. There are some robust flavors, roasted malts, and vanilla in the taste but they are fairly weak. Not bad tasting at all, the taste just needs to be beefed up and give off stronger flavors in my opinion."

""
""
"a decent porter, nice and flavorful, sweet but well balanced."
""
""
""
"O: Very good beer, I love vanilla porters. Kind of reminds me of the snowdrift Vanilla porter from Leinenkugel's, but with a much richer flavor and texture. I highly recommend trying this brew."
"I like it, and will very likely get it again, but I would like to see better balance. Less chocolate (can't believe I'm saying that), more vanilla and coffee."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
"Overall tasty and drinkable if you're craving vanilla. Could have used more chocolate malt balance."
""
""
"Pours very dark, block, some brown hints. Some brown foam. French vanilla coffee nose. Espresso roasted. Rich chocolately malt taste with vanilla laced throughout. Mild bitter hop at the end. Creamy mouthfeel. A little boozy. Really tasty."
""
""
""
""
"Note: I love the smell of coffee but I really do not like the taste of coffee. I don't think that influenced me too much but it may have played a little part."
""
"O: A decent beer from the home town, its worth a shot."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste/feel: This is a pretty decent beer, as it's a nice change from the typical coffee/chocolate powered porters out there. The feel is a bit of a let down as it's a little watery, but the taste is surprisingly decent. I do get some traces of espresso and coffee, but it's not super strong, and it's balanced pretty well with the vanilla in there. A solid porter from Atwater."
"O: This beer certainly lived up to its name: It had a very strong vanilla flavor. So it get a few bonus points for being a little of the beaten path, but not too far. Overall, it is an interesting variation on the porter style. Not quite a must try, but still pretty good."

"Overall, one of the better Atwater brew's I've had, but in my experience with them - that really isn't saying too much. Definitely worth a try at least one time, but there are certainly better vanilla flavored porters out there."

"Overall: Pleased with this beer as I thought I would be. A nice switch from lagers if you're looking for something different."

"O: Not a bad porter at all, certainly better then the current average in my opinion. If everything about was a little more pronounced then it would definitely be a great beer."
"O- Great smell and decent tasting. Too thin to be amazing but nothing wrong with this beer"

"O: i'm a bit biased because i love vanilla but this was an unbalanced beer. Too thin in body, needs more coffee and malt base to balance it out. Not sure i'd buy another 6 pack of this."
"O: This is a great tasting porter that has some interesting twists from the vanilla extract and coffee."
""
""
"Overall –Not a bad brew, it has good flavors but does not really live up to its name as a “vanilla Java” porter."
""
"A decent vanilla java porter with plenty of vanilla but precious little buzz."

"Near black pour, a few large bubbles, no lacing. Strange indeed. Scents of vanilla, chocolate, and coffee, as expected. Taste is unexpected for a porter, its rather light, lacking in body, though it has a pleasant vanilla and later coffee taste that lingers."
"Appearance is a very thin tan head that quickly recedes. This stuff almost looks like Coca Cola in a glass. The color of the brew is a jet black. Smells of vanilla and coffee beans as you would expect. Nothing more to the smell other than that. It tastes literally EXACTLY like a Medium-Dark coffee would. Lots of java, Lot's of coffee flavor, With a hint of chocolate and a TON of vanilla. In fact, This beer is so delicious that I didn't even want to swallow it. I wanted that vanilla flavor to last forever. The mouthfeel is pretty thin, No other flavors come through other than the ones I have stated. Over all I was very impressed with this, I figured I'd end up giving the 6 pack away. And hell, I got these beers for free so it was an absolute steal. Though one thing I would like to mention is that my experience with this beer has been different with each bottle. This review was written after I had drank the best one in the six pack"

"O: This is a very good beer with if you like the vanilla taste. It's something a bit different from the ordinary that is still refreshing on a warm day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: an alright beer overall, though it lacks depth and is a bit watery."
""
""
"Overall a Coffee Porter that has a lot more vanilla in the aroma than in the taste, but all in all it was a nice smooth tasty brew..."
""

""
""
"Overall, a nice sipping beer I would pick up again."

""
""
""

""
"O- Really nice beer, everything promised was delivered. Lots of vanilla, good coffee, with a solid English porter underneath."
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice tasting chocolate and coffee flavored beer. Sweet but not cloying. Could of used a little more body."
"If you like the bitter aftertaste of burnt coffee, a hint of sweetness, and a heavy after-dinner lingering beer, this is for you."
""
""
"The body is medium with soft carbonation. Coffee really lingers on the pallet on this one. Overall this one isn't very impressive. Not the worst beer but it doesn't seem to come together very well."

"I love anything with vanilla so generally speaking I liked this beer. Strong coffee malt aroma with hints of vanilla. I found the taste to be of strong malts followed by vanilla flavor. Could taste the coffee but not find that it had a strong presence. My boyfriend dislikes coffee but enjoyed this beer. Very smooth mouth feel- was expecting a heavier feel. I will drink the 6 pack and would definately get it again!"
"Drinking my first one now. My first taste it was full of chocolate followed by vanilla and coffee with a slight smoky flavor. That was very pleasant but the feel to me could have been heavier. I drank about half of it cold and then let it set until it got to room temperature. The beer only got better in my opinion. Great color and nice head. I will be buying more in the future. Prost!"
"This beer I picked up at the local stop-n-steal that tries for 9.99 a sixer. I'm surprised it has scored so low on here but in the interest of full disclosure, I dated a girl in college who wore a vanilla body lotion, so anything vanilla is associated with some pretty great memories! Pours a matte black with little head or lacing. Great vanilla aroma, but I'm, you know, into that. A little thin on the mouthfeel, but not bad. Really good flavor dominated by the vanilla at first, but with the coffee, and some chocolatey note at the end. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I thought this was a solid brew. Pours black with a creamy khaki head that sticks around a bit. A nice coffee aroma and a hint of vanilla. Flavor follows with sweet vanilla and some light watery coffee mingling with the roasted malts. A little sweet and light on the mouthfeel, but I wouldn't turn it down if offered. Overall this is decent enough."
"12oz bottle. Pours a dark brownish black color with an inch of tan head. Almost no lacing. Aromas of vanilla, cappuccino, caramel and roasted malts. Taste is much like the aroma. Vanilla dominates with flavors of sweet coffee and roasted malts. Earthy. A bit watery with a thin mouthfeel. Somewhat of a metallic aftertaste. Nothing special and not worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
"This beer blew me away! Aroma of the chocolate comes through immediately! Very nice chocolate and slight vanilla taste sensation with the coffee comming through and lingering on the palate!I like a more malty beer and this one hit the spot for me! Very smooth drinkable beer!"
""
"Very good beer, easy to drink, delicious."
""
"O- I think this is a decent porter, the vanilla makes it interesting, and it is tasty. The body needs to be better, this may improve the aroma as well."
""
""
"Overall...hmm...definitely not one of my favorites. Ive had worse though. If they thickened up the body I think it'd do wonders for this beer."
""
""
""
""
"O- I love vanilla and I love coffee, this was a no brainer :)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a nice dark porter color with about 2 fingers of head. Smell was very nice vanila and java flavor, which rolled over very nicely to the taste. Very smooth and the vanilla gave that nice sweet flavor and finish. This was my first beer from Atwater. Very Nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All and all, I wouldn't steer anyone away from this on, I just feel like there are better examples out there."
""
""
""
""
"T/M - The taste, body and the rest is lacking. I'm not getting much java or porter. I'm getting a pinch of vanilla, and a lot of water. It's sweet, but dry. Extremely drinkable. Watery mouthfeel due to low carbonation and lack of body. Overall, it goes down quick and leaves the palette searching."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is definetely a drinkable porter with a vanilla presence, but it lacks complexity. Not impressed and probably won't drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I have had this beer on tap at a festival and remember it being really good. However, when having it just now in a bottle it doesn't seem as good as I recall. It might just be that's it's another batch, or maybe it was just sitting out for awhile."
""
""
""
"Poured into flute (odd, but what we had) with a finger head on pour, dissipating to a rim of carbonation against a clear black body. looks almost of cola (and the mouth feel is thin and water with good carbonation which also reminds of soda). Smell is roasty sugars (vanilla) and definite chocolate character. Taste follows with mild bitterness and complimenting vanilla and chocolates. Still a bit light bodied for me to want all the time but the carbonation makes it creamy. The friend debated on a 6 pack, and given her tastes i think it would have been a great purchase. Watery for the ABV, i wouldn't buy the 6 pack but i would gladly drink this again, all i could think for the end of the glass was ice cream float..."
""
"D - A very middling but otherwise inoffensive porter. Not a drain pour like many of the gems we opened that night, and might be appealing to craft beer n00bs for it's familiar flavors and lack of subtly."
"D: a novelty and desert beer. And not all that good either. Lacking much beer character. Not enough malty heft to pull off the vanilla, java, porter idea. Not terrible, but a bit less than alright."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a ruby black beer with no foam. It has a creamy sweet vanilla aroma, like an ice cream float. Thin bodied and fizzy, with a flat vanilla flavor followed by a harsh finish. Where’s the java? I’ll give it that it’s sweet but not my thing. Pass."
""
""
""
"I was really looking forward to this beer, as I liked the sound of everything. Sadly, it was a bit disappointing. It poured a nice deep black, however it appears a bit thin as it's somehow almost translucent. Not much in the way of aroma save for a slight bit of burnt coffee. Kind of odd taste, almost a fake chemical note to it, not a lot of vanilla and not a lot of coffee. Pretty thin overall as well, disappears off the tongue without a trace pretty quickly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"O: Great porter as intended. Not as roasty or coffee or chocolate as some, but the strong vanilla balances well. Great simple porter for the vanilla and coffee lovers."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bomber into a tumbler pint, the beer is an extremely dark chestnut brown, with the slightest ring of white foam. Way too small of an amount to be called head. Heavy roasted coffee aromas, with an underlying tone of vanilla scent, and a smokey highlight throughout. The beer's flavors ride a thin, smooth body, with coffee notes in the foreground. There is a creamy vanilla backbone on the palate, and an overall roasted character. The aftertaste is mostly the bitter coffee, cleaning the palate for continued drinking. The finish is slick, and with a slight linger. Decent brew; not outstanding, but a good stand by porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A bit of a let down. I was looking forward to the vanilla java combo, but the vanilla really overpowered anything else. The watery mouthfeel was also a let down"
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Serious disappointment."
"o - overall, very soda like. Not sure if I'll get through the entire bottle or not, but certainly one that I won't seek out again. The vanilla just doesn't work too great. If they did a tiny amount of vanilla and beefed up the chocolate, this one might stand a chance."
"I'll get it again if it's on tap...I will never buy it in a bottle again. This review focuses ratings more towards the draught...I really enjoyed it."
"This beer completely lacks any sort of subtlety. The only way it can call itself a porter is through its color, a pretty weak argument. This would be well and good if the coffee and vanilla were used with some sort of beneficial effect on flavor, but the beer just ends up tasting like a poorly made malted milkshake."
"o: it's alright, probably a good starter porter, kind of bland."
"O: Simply not a very good beer that I didn't even bother finishing. Reminds of a mildly alcoholic cola with it's sweet, fake taste."
"Drinkability: Average at best. I was expecting to really like it."
"Poured a very dark brown with some hints of red. Absolutely no head but did leave a fizzy film at the top. I found this beer very refreshing, and the java taste was very pleasant. Couldn't taste very much of the vanilla though. I found the mouthfeel to be very watery. This beer has VERY little body. Overall it was a refreshing beer that goes down very easy. I would definitely drink again but wouldn't seek out."
"O- Average, I was somewhat dissapointed, kind of overdid it with the vanilla"
"Pours a deep rich coffee color, even the highlights are reminiscent of a dark roasted cup of coffee. Relatively little head remains after the initial pour. The smell is of stale, Italian roast coffee. The flavor has notes of strong Madagascar vanilla, and finishes with a deep, smokey coffee flavor. The beer's mouthfeel is appropriate for a porter, which could be perceived as thin by people expecting a stout. Overall, this is a good example of a porter. It's very drinkable, and refreshing like a porter should be."
"Cheers!"
"Overall I enjoyed it alot just which it had a bit higher alcohol content. Always liked my porter on the heavy side. Cheers"
"With a name like Vanilla Java…I was expecting a brew with much more vanilla flavor. Atwater’s Porter is not as heavy as other Porters, however, a good entry level porter."
"The Atwater Vanilla Java Porter is big on aroma, but short on body. My preference for porters and stouts is to have some body...a bit thicker mouthfeel. This Porter is very light. The appearance is very dark amber, not completely opaque. Minimal carbonation and almost no head. The aroma is filled with vanilla and coffee. The taste has vanilla and coffee, but the coffee is definitely more prevalent. Those that like iced-mochochinos will like this beer. The mouthfeel is lacking cuz I like body...this beer does not have body. Still worth a try however."
"This one isn't as robust as I would like, and I couldn't really shake the not-so-impressive cola aftertaste. Not upset that I tried it, but there are far better coffee and/or vanilla porter out there."
"O: I could see this actually being pretty decent if it wasn't for that sourness and metallic character."
"It's an alright beer that I wouldn't turn down if being handed one, but I won't go out of my to pay for one again. There are better coffee stouts, vanilla anythings, and classy porters out there."
"I was marginally able to finish this beer. Disappointed, sounded tasty."
"Overall: Thankfully, I bought a single. Pass."
"O: Very...bleh."
"O: Meh. Not very beery."
"Taste is light and refreshing, especially for a stout. 40% chocolate bar. It even has a hint of cream to it. Not much coffee but it shows itself lightly. This beer was a delicious session porter and I was happily surprised at the outcome."
"just another tick on the list."
"Overall, this is a tasty, sessionable beer good for a cold evening cozying up by a fire or with dessert. The vanilla, however, seemed a bit contrived, and the body was light for a porter. Ideally, I would like to taste more of the malt flavor in this beer."
"Overall, I was expecting to like this beer a good deal, and I didn't. It had all the beginnings of something nice but never cashed in. To me it was just too thin, like they were trying to brew a vanilla java porter for someone who doesn't like craft brew. The upshot is that it's easy drinking. Thanks to my sister for passing this along. I'm really excited to try the VJ Black Imperial Stout that she also sent, which is supposed to be an imperial version of this beer. That might rectify my problems with it."
"This beer is great for a session, no mention of abv on the bottle but any alcohol in it does not come off boozy in the least bit. Beer is chugable!"
"O: The lighter bodied nature of this beer makes it quite easy to drink compared to other porters."
"O - Of the first couple drinks this may be a 3.5 average. As I drink the rest, the vanilla flavor comes out and I am trying to cherish the end of the drink which is always great!"
"Mouthfeel was way lighter than one would expect from a porter (but in my opnion, in a good way). The lower and ABV and mouthfeel pairing with the awesome flavors makes this very crushable and I, personally, could sit and drink quite a few of these. Fantastic beer."
"O: Light and easy to drink with no sense of alcohol. The lack of a general Porter flavor profile and body, combined with a lack of coffee, leads to a very uninspired brew."
"O- I like vanilla in beers but this is really overpowering. Like to much creme in my coffee"
"Mouthfeel is rather light and a bit creamy. Overall, this is certainly not a bad tasting beer but it's flavoring seems to be a bit out of balance but if that's what the brewmasters want and if thats what sells, who am I to complain."
"Bummer."
"I don't recommend this beer. Possibly my least favorite of any vanilla and/or java beer I've had. Needs more of the advertised flavors. It's as if they didn't use enough ingredients, or used too much water. Vanilla java lite?"
"This was a good idea but like I stated above needs more in all aspects of the ingredients."
"I really enjoy porters and was really excited about the Vanilla Java on the label. I guess you can't judge a book by its cover."
"Drinkability? My first is my last. Got suckered in by the Vanilla Java Porter name (I like all three). This is neither of them. More like a bad home brew where the wrong spores got into the wort."
"This beer pours out a nice blackish-brown body with a thin tan head that has decent lacing and good retention. The smell is a very strong vanilla with some slight hints of coffee and chocolate. The taste is some hops up front with vanilla in the middle and some hints of coffee and chocolate at the end. The aftertaste has some chocolate and coffee taste, but mostly vanilla. The mouthfeel is very smooth, creamy and pleasant on the tongue, lips and cheek. This is a nice beer to drink and I just finished my first of many Atwater Vanilla Java Porters."
"D- this beer is drinkable. id like to have another one to compare it. decent taste, good feel, but a few odd characteristics."
"D - I could easily put this back for a few hours due to alcohol content. But, not sure I'd want to as the flavors don't keep me coming back."
"All in all, this is definitely enjoyable but a porter it is not. I'd more think that is something one could drink quite a few of after a night out. The ""all-American Cosmopolitan young lady's clubbing afterparty beer"" anyone?"
"Overall I thought this was a pretty good brew. The flavors were balanced nicely and as advertised. All in all this was the best beer in the Arcadia mixed twelve pack, I would for sure buy this beer again."
"D: The alcohol is completely masked and it is decently drinkable, but man I wanted more from this."
"Some might argue that porters do not maintain the same drinkability as perhaps a lager or an ale but I would argue that drinkability does not just boil down to session drinking but instead focuses on the overall drinkable nature of the beer. This porter could serve as a nice session beer or it could stand alone as a good beer to pair with a nice meal. Ideally this beer would go nicely with either a smoked chicken or some grilled BBQ meat."
"Atwater Block Brewery--Wake Up & Smell the Beer!--Vanilla Java Porter--Malt Beverage brewed with Coffee Beans with Natural Flavor Added (Vanilla Bean Extract)--2010 12 oz.

"Reviewed on 3/26/2010. Bottle thanks to cheapdark. Pours a dark brown with a thick tan head. Aroma of vanilla mostly with some coffee and sweet roasted malt. Flavor is also predominantly vanilla and lactose. Pretty decent although the body is weak. Nice vanilla notes and much tastier than I had expected!"
"This is a nice beer atwater brewery puts out. A nice dark color with minimal head. The small as you bring the glass to drink is a very strong notes of vanilla,but not a bad thing, because the firdt taste is one to remember.I've had the bottle and this beer can only be enjoyed on tap. drinkabillity is ok but after 3-4 your looking for a new taste. Enjoy this is a good winter beer."
"Dark brownish black, opaque, with little to no head. Rich vanilla, chocolate, and coffee in the nose. Very smooth tasting. The vanilla extract overpowers all, and in a good way, with not much else coming through except undertones of sweet dark malts and a bit of coffee and cocoa. Medium body, not very thick or heavy at all. Goes down smooth with no harshness, and little to nothing in the way of hoppiness or bitterness. Nice beer."
"Drinkability: Too heavy to have more than two or three of, but definitely one of the better beers on tap locally."
"Overall, what was best about this beer was its appearance. While it does have the main attributes of a porter visually, it falls way short in other aspects. What was most offensive about the brew was the overly metallic (and spicy pepper!!) qualities throughout the aroma and taste, making this beer less than desirable."
"Drinkability: It was free, and still not worth the investment of time. Where i am a huge fan of coffee porters and stouts, this specimen failed to interest me in any way. Low drinkability..."
"The flavor is quite a bit of artificial vanilla along with some chocolate and mild roast. The body is thin and slightly astringent. Low carbonation. Nose isn't bad, but this is a bit fake and gimmicky."
"Deeelicious is the one word I can come up with when asked to describe this humble brew. Of all the words that can be used to describe a drank, it is the most fitting. This beer gets a ten on the chug-scale (ladies), and the caffeine buzz is delightful. Sip hard...."
"Works well as a desert beer with a scoop of chocolate ice cream."
"I had a draft pint of this at the bar, and was impressed enough to get a growlerfull a few days later. But repeated drinkings have decreased my originally positive view of this beer."
"Won't revisit this one. Glad I tried but once was enough..."
"I'm glad I split this bottle. The beer is too sweet for me and the flavors comes in waves; they don't work together as they do in the aroma. The gushing bottle made it a pain to pour, which is just another strike against this beer. Perhaps if I find myself in an area where this is distributed, I'll try a fresh bottle, but I'm not going to go looking for this beer."
"D - Again, just OK. I like the chocolatey center, but it gets muddled with the rest of it. I think the problem is that there's too much acidity in this one."
"The drinkability on this brew, I guess would be easy. As stated above, I think that the coffee flavor is a little overbearing, the carbonination is kind of high, and with the name having vanilla in it, I expected a bit more vanilla flavor. I will venture on and try other Atwater Block products, but I will probably not turn towards this brew again."
"One beer was enough for me. If you like black coffee (which I do not), this may be more appealing to you, however."
"Atwater Block Vanilla Java Porter is a brown/black beer with a thin khaki head that fades to a film and leaves decent lacing. It has a sweet, roasty aroma with notes of coffee and sugar and a touch of chocolate. It's medium bodied and watery. It tastes pretty sweet. It starts roasty and then ends with a coffee ice cream flavor. The aftertaste is sour. There's no bitterness involved, really. It tastes great for half a second and then it kind of falls apart. It's a good concept but it doesn't really work out. Still, I wouldn't turn one down."
"This is a fairly drinkable porter, but nothing unfortunately it seems to fall a bit flat. I am not sure if I would seek this out again, though I might be willing to give it a second try."
"D- ok beer not blown away at all. but ok drinking beer."
"I would be curious to try this without the coffee addition. I enjoyed the Stoney Creek Vanilla as it was but Im not sure if this is the same recipe."
"M- Like everything else Ive had by Atwater, this beer is wildly over carbonated. It physically hurts the tongue."
"Finally, it goes to show that the parts are greater than the sum."
"Seriously strange stuff. Gets off to a good start by pouring very dark with a massive brown head. The main aroma reminds me of seltzer water (that's a bad sign) and a bit of coffee. There's a nasty chemical funk that I've never smelled in a beer before. Tastes nothing like a porter; flavors of a weak, day old coffee and stale chocolate, and that same chemical funk that's so prominent on the nose. The vanilla flavors are strongest on the front palate and then linger briefly on the finish. Body is waaay too carbonated. I'm wondering whether I simply got a bad or damaged bottle or if each of these traits is intentional..."
"Wishing for a darker, thicker, and more robust brew. With some heavier malting and a better handle on the sweet vs control of the vanilla and this could be amazing. As is I am trying to think how long these will sit in my fridge before I can muster the will to drink the other 5..."
"This was an ok beer, there was decent flavor, I just thought it was a little too thin for a porter."
"Overall, I saw this sitting in my fridge and it sounded perfect at the moment, but the taste just didn't reflect on the name of this beer and how good it sounded. Not at all impressed with this one."
"Drinakbility: The overall beer is okay, rather unimpressive. The middle slightly acrid coffee flavor is great. Now, if they could only get some more robust porter flavors and pump the vanilla up a notch, this would be great. Right now it is just okay."
"Dark brown ruby red pour with quickly fading head and no lacing. Nice roasted coffee nose with hints of chocolate and vanilla. The taste is much the same with the roasted coffee dominating here also, albeit a bit watered down. The vanilla is present but also watered down. The mouthfeel is very thin which kills the drinkability for me. I had high hopes for this beer when I bought it but it fell way short."
"Presented in a short weizen glass it appears a very dark brown almost black color with little to no head. What does appear reminescent of a head is a thin lacing of offwhite film that collects along the inside perimeter of the glass. Nose is full of a dark grainy chocolate sweetness and a ripe dark fruit character. Taste is quite watery and thin but filled will coffee and vanilla that is pretty much impossible to miss. A little too mild on the level of carbonation. A dark grain bitterness resides on the tongue accented by the alcohol warmth. An ever present character of dark sweet fruit hangs out in the background and really just clashes with the vanilla and coffee. I finished the glass but would not have this again."
"If they had called this Vanilla Porter it would be more effective. The java part is hardly evident and would be better off as a nice surprise instead of something for which people have expectations."
"Future outlook: I didn't buy this several times after having it catch my eye....I'm rewarded for finally caving in and buying with this disgusting (hopefully) infected mess. I don't want to do it, but this beer has truly earned it's ""F."""
"Not bad but wasn't worth the trip to Shoreline."
"I opened this beer expecting too much, it smelled strongly of coffee, which I liked. The look was a very dark brown to black. The initial taste, tasted of too many flavors and spices. This tastes like someone just threw a few too many spices into the mix to see what it would taste like. Overall the taste was weird, the aftertaste was complete coffee, but I couldnt get over the initial taste. All and all this is nothing special, I was kinda disappointed."
"Pours a nice opaque sable with a fluffy, pale tan head. Aroma is fairly strong and mainly of coffee with a powdery undertone and hints of vanilla and cocoa. Flavor is like roast coffee with touches of vanilla and unsweet chocolate, not very strong. Texture is smooth and a bit on the watery side, not much fizz. OK, but not worth hunting down."
"D - The aroma is good but it all went down hill fast from there. The lack of body and thin profile are disappointing. It's drinkability is ok but there is no incentive to bring me back for another try of this beer."
"D-I always like to try new things, but this is what happens when I buy blindly without doing a little research first. Not a pleasant beer at all, and I wasn't expecting the fake raspberry notes."
"Poured into a Dogfish Head Signature Glass. Poured to a color of dark brown with a very dark red behind it. About a finger of head . Creamy on top that fades to fish eye bubbles. The aromatics are not very present. Fairly sweet smell with alcohol. Not much off front. Sort of a muted feeling when it hits the lips. Then the tangy, followed by a slight bitter. This parts seems to come over the pallet too fast then fades out very quickly. There is lingering bittersweet dry mouth feel. Yep, sweet java. This should definitely should not be served right out of the fridge. The head lingers very disorganized on the glass. Kind of fell it in my head. Caffeine maybe? I'm not finding the vanilla so much."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a mostly opaque dark coffee color with a very thing off white head. Copious streams of carbonation rose from the bottom. Aroma was vanilla sweet, almost overly so, with a hint of coffee flavor. Taste was slightly sweet lactosey. Not much coffee flavor, but a vanilla ending flavor. Not very good in the mouth. Felt a bit thin and watery, and the carbonation was distracting. Not very drinkable. The over carbonation was problematic, as was the slightly acidic watery beer."
"D-Just too sweet to have more than one, two at most in a sitting. Not my favorite but I would buy it again."
"D: Pretty decent brew, but my expectations weren't exactly met. I had a feeling this one might sound better than it actually is; this is certainly the case. At least it's not a terrible, hard to drink beer. Easy to drink considering the supposed cornucopia of flavors used. Don't get your hopes up, folks, if you see this one in stores, but it can be mildly enjoyable."
"Until Atwater has simple beers that excel at being simple beers, I fear their attempts at extravagance will continue to come up short."
"D- Nope. I have one now with 2 more staring at me, and it will be a while til I drink either of those 2. To be honest, I'm a college student and I may wait til some big party night and bust those 2 out once I am already feeling good so I can just down them without thinking."
"This is my first beer from Atwater.... I'll look for them again, this one is not a big winner with me...."
"All in all, this brew started off good, but ended mediocre. Not worth hunting down. Good to try once, but otherwise, nah. Hop heads will absolutely hate this brew..."
"Fairly light for a porter, which can be ok if the flavor is there. Unfortunately it wasn't, so I'd have to think hard about it before deciding to drink another one."
"D - eh, I would have a large list before picking this again."
"A nice enough beer, though not so wonderful I feel as if need to revisit this any time again soon."
"D - really easy to drink but I'm not sure I really want to drink it, this isn't a drain pour but I don't plan on ever buying this again"
"F: A slight roasted spicy bitter... wait, no, not really. Just liquid watery taste with some syrupy fake corn syrup sweetness. Sticky and ugly. Some slight coffee and roast lingering, and a touch of chocolate on a burp. But mostly just watery and fake vanilla on the finish as well. Terrible!"
"Pours a deep and clear brown color with a one finger creamy tan head. Looks good, but the aroma is off with a nose of pencil lead and tartness. The drink is similar with a great deal of off flavors. The coffee taste is very tart and the sweetness cloys the palate. With a light body and high carbonation, it is a quick drink and quick finish but it leaves behind the tart and wooden pencil flavor for just long enough to wonder if you should take another sip."
"D: This isn't the worst porter I've ever had, but it decidedly average."
"On tap. Poured to a dark brown with reddish tints, a nice thick tan head that lingered well, and good lacing. Nose started out well, with the scent of coffee, chocolate and a hint of vanilla. Unfortunately, teh rest did not quite live up to the billing of the appearance and nose. Mouthfeel was a little thin bodied and sticky sweet. Taste was a weird mixture of the scents of the nose, and the finish left an aftertaste of having drank vanilla extract straight from the bottle."
"D: Though not a ""bad"" beer, I can't see myself seeking this beer out."
"Drinkinability: Went into this endeavor with I think a bit too much confidence, bit also with high hopes. If your a fan of coffee and beer, this brew is for you. Will I dare to drink again? Only if it was bought for me. Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel- A bit of carbonation not real thick but it isn't a stout"
"Overall I would have to take a pass on this one, just not worth it again."
"No, this isn't anything spectacular, but it's pleasant enough."
"Conclusion: Meh...it's a good idea, but not executed well. Much better coffee beers out there."
"D- Drain pour. Not sure where this beer falls along the history line of the coffee craze in porters and stouts, but this beer proves it's not an easy brew to do well."
"~Jonathan Passow"
"Overall, its very pleasant and as I saw others state, taken in the right context, its worth a try to see where you fall on it. If you want a porter, then buy a true porter. This one comes up a lil short. You want to experiment without crashing, this is a solid choice."
"D- easy to put down but it feels like i am drinking a BMC type of beer. Flavors and smell are good but there is the ""wow"" factor that is missing."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability - Not much to say. It's terrible. I dumped it."
"Real dark brown with ruby/mahogany highlights and no head or lacing. I'll give it one thing...it does look like I poured a cup of java into my glass. Sweet vanilla, coffee, and faint bitter chocolate scents. Bitter coffee finish. I had this a couple years ago and thought it was a turd. Now I just find it a bigger one."
"D/ no thank you"
"Pitch black color with a fluffy off white head about half inch thickness that held on for quite a while. Strong aroma of vanilla extract, chocolate and roasted coffee beans. I could smell this brew as I poured it in my glass. This one tastes almost like it smells, except the vanilla overpowers the chocolate and coffee notes and takes control of the brew. There's a strange aftertaste that I can't quite describe, but it's almost chemical in nature. Something is not right with this brew. Mouthfeel is unusually light for a porter with decent carbonation and the combination makes for easy drinkability. If it weren't for the excess vanilla and chemical flavors, it'd be alright."
"Drinkability: This beer has potential, but just ends up way too sweet. The vanilla/chemical flavors dominate. One was plenty, and it was tough to finish it."
"D: Light enough at six percent that if one were inclined, multiple would be possible, but the sweetness is a bit too offputting."
"Drinkability is just ok. It goes down easy but there's nothing there to make me want another. I feel there are better examples of coffee and vanilla porters out there."
"Poured mahogany with two fingers of beige head and great lace, into an American pint glass. The smell revealed ample traces of coffee and roasted malt, but only feint hints of oak and vanilla. The taste was more complex, with an initial surge of ice coffee-type flavor, dissolving to roasted maltiness, and then finishing on a sweet vanilla note. The taste of coffee lingered afterwards as well. Surprisingly thin body for a porter, with some decent carbonation. Not the best coffee porter I've had, but definitely nowhere near the worst."
"Atwater Vanilla Java Porter is not a very good beer. The only flavor in the otherwise weak and watery beverage is mild vinegar. This porter is more mindful of an English rather than American porter."
"Atwater Vanilla Java Porter looked good, and is enjoyable enough, but has no substance."
"I have to say, in the asthetic department (look, body etc), this one works. The actual result is a disaster. Remove what's used for vanilla here, keep it a straight coffee-porter, and this recipe has some potential. Until then...."
"Definitely try it."
"D - This is quite a bit different from what I expected. It has a distinct cherry note with only moderate coffee and minimal vanilla, and I almost wonder if the bottle I bought isn't a mislabled cherry stout. It is, nevertheless, a very pleasant and drinkable beer with a nice balance between the fruit/malt and coffee bitterness."
"Overall I was pretty disappointed with this offering. I hope this isn't an example of what all their offerings are, but I am a little tentative to try the rest of the lineup now..."
"I'm very surprised at the average score for this beer. I had this in Pittsburgh on tap and I was blown away by the flavor. Most porters/beers that boast coffee or vanilla beans tend to let me down, but this one came through perfectly. You get the Vanilla in the mouthfeel but the coffee comes later in the finish. Perfect. Easy to drink and is now one of my favorites in this genre."
"I head to the sink to start the beer funeral, but I stay my hand a couple of times because, like a summer action flick, this beer is almost fascinatingly bad. I take some extra sips just to remind myself that I'm not making this up. Please, for the love of God, do not make that same mistake. Begin the drain pour as soon as humanly possible..."
"uscaptainsblog.blogspot.com"
"Also, LOL at the wimps on here who can't handle this beer and are giving it low ratings. Good for what it is and when the time is right, I will drink this beer for breakfast again."
"D: Zero, horrible. I don't know what else to say."
"D- Wont look for this one again. About halfway through the vanilla was just too over powering. Drain poured the rest."
"I'm not going to say this one's bad simply because it's Atwater, no matter how some people see it."
"D: I found this cloying."
"I bought a whole six pack of this and all of them were pretty bad. I was really excited about this one but it fell way short and was highly disappointing. I wouldnt purchase this ever again."
"This beer smells intensely of vanilla late. And the taste is quite sweet, kind of like alot of vanilla in strong coffee with a pinch of sugar. Color is pretty black with a bit of brown. Mothfeel is smooth. Drinkability is also ok but would be better amidst sweeter beers"
"Taste-Lots of vanilla extract(almost too much) cofee and cream and some chocolate notes-Light to medium bodied-drinkable, but only if you like, really like vanilla as it almost overwhelms the flavor of this beer"
"Drinkability: The disappointing quality of the coffee flavor and the over-artificial flavor of the vanilla extract is something I cannot get past. This is not something I would buy again."
"Very drinkable, but I certainly would keep it to one of these, perhaps paired with some cherry cheesecake"
"D: I wouldn't want to drink more than one of these, but it's a pretty tasty novelty porter. The flavors in it definitely makes it live up to its name."
"Roasted coffee flavor with chocolate maltiness, oatmeal, vanilla bean and hazelnut. Creamy medium body that is pretty silky considering how roasty the flavor is with a slightly dry bitter finish."
"~ Purchased this 12 oz bottle from New Beer Distributors in Manhattan, NY. Pours dark brown with a small head that dissipates quickly. Aromas are light and I can make out hints of coffee and vanilla. Taste is sourish. Mouthfeel is watery. I had high hopes for this beer in the beginning, but it turned out to be a disaster in the end. Drink at your own risk! ~"
"D: goes down pretty smooth and easy, and reasonably tasty."
"Pours an attractive dark brown color with a thick head that had excellant retention. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Large amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. The aroma and flavor sadly does not carry the show. Mild vanilla and chocolate aromas but very mild. The flavor is a bit off. Touches of vanilla and coffee but it lacks a nice malt base to help with the non traditional flavors. Slight bitterness with no lingering aftertaste. The body starts nice but falls off in the end and feels a little thin and overcarbonated. Nothing bad with this beer but it comes off rather timid and poorly executed. No point in drinking this again."
"Smells like alot of java but with a vanilla bean smell also very prevalent. Pours to a very opaque dark brown with a creamy micro-bubble head that stands nicely in the glass. First sip yields a good up front roasted malt flavor that is slightly sweetened with a twang of vanilla. The flavor however, waters out quickly and leaves a minute bit of bitterness behind but overall the finish is very clean. Mouthfeel is good on carbonation but the thinning out of the flavor ripples into and adversely affects the mouthfeel as well. Not really what I expected. I was looking for more of a big bold porter with a vanilla twist. It ain't there."
"Drinkability: drink one every now and again to do something different, yes. a goto beer, no."
"Pours a nice black color, very nice carbonation, very nice two-finger plus creamy/foamy off-white head, with some thick creamy sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, with some slight coffee notes, slight chocolate note, vanilla. The taste is slightly sweet, with some coffee/chocolate notes, vanilla. Medium body. Drinkable, I was expecting more, but still a tasty brew."
"this is probably the worst and most sorry excuse for a porter i have ever had. please save yourself the cash and do not even try this beer. The only smell or aroma that you get from this is this weird fake vanilla stench that just smells wrong and unnatural. The taste totally reflects the smell and is just as worse if not more terrible. I loved the octoberfest by them but this is just a sorry excuse for a beer and it seems so half assed it just comes off as a joke. Please don't drink this beer, I would rather drink a Kobra."
"After being on a porter kick for about a week, I noticed this beer for the first time at my local liquor store and decided to buy a six-pack... not the best decision. The head was out of control and I had to wait far to long to let it subside before drinking. Light roast and coffee in the aroma, but not much else and hard to detect. I didn't get much vanilla in either the aroma or taste, sadly. The beer was very thin in all aspects. This isn't unbearable, but it was not pleasant by any means and completely not worth the price, which was average or slightly higher than other craft six-packs"
"Mouthfeel is decent but leaves a little bit of a film in the mouth. The aftertaste is bitter. I was really excited about this when I first tried it, & it was my introduction to more complex porters, but now I've moved onto other similar & better examples of the style. Not bad, but I'm starting to see superior alternatives. Also prefer it on draft."
"Luckily I just purchased a single from the 6 pack shop. I don't think my dog would have drank the other 5."
"Pours a solid dark brown with a bubbly beige head. Smells of milk chocolate, a bit of vanilla, slightly acridic aroma. Slight coffee and a touch of alcohol. Taste is creamy chocolate, slight coffee, very smooth taste is a bit unexciting. Creamy bordering on watery mouthfeel, Light carbonation, medium body. This one was okay. It was the best of the three that I bought from Atwater, but only okay compared to others of the style."
"D: This beer was very mediocre. I had high hopes for this and was sorely disappointed. One expects a complex brew based on the flavors in the title. That is hardly what is delivered."
"Smooth vanilla porter, not as much vanilla as one usually gets in this style. It poured a nice carmel color out of the bottle and finished looking like a nice solid porter. It has a smooth finish with a slight vanilla aftertaste which is pleasant. The aroma score is low but that could be cause it tended to lack an aroma over all."
"I had this at the Brickyard in Lewiston, New York but it's not listed on the Beer Spy list. If you are ever in the Buffalo-Niagara Falls-Lewiston area, give this place a try. My best friend is the gm and the person who got me into good beer, as well as telling me about BA. He is building their beer selection and doing a pretty good job of it."
"Can't really recommend this over any other coffee-themed beers - so many better American-style porters out there, and particularly of the vanilla persuasion (I think Breckenridge Vanilla Porter is miles ahead of this), not to mention a plethora of better coffee-forward beers.  Convinced that I had a bad bottle with the oxidation flavors that were present, but I'm not sure when/if I'll return to this beer to give it a second chance."
"Forgettable"
"Has good drinkability as nothing is offending."
"Drinkability: Pretty low - the flavors aren't balanced... I feel like they just tried to do too much with something that may be much better off if left a bit simpler."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and smooth with good carbonation."
"A six pack of any porter takes its sweet time in my fridge to deplete, so this has had some time to grow on me. Over all impression from a guy that doesn't love porters...this is in my top 3. I don't really have a definitive top 2 but this one probably wouldn't be in it. Regardless, it's actually quite nice. I feel like I've had more stouts like this with the range of flavors and creamy mouth feel that this one has. I didn't get any nasty flavors as some others had, though as I sip it now, I can taste a coppery taste, not awful though. This is a nice night time beer. Maybe a top 2 in my list of sleepy time beers."
"If you like chilled coffee, give this beer a try!"
"So after quite a bit of debate, I've decided that I like this beer, but it's not one I will be drinking regularly. It pours kind of a hazy brown color with a small almost root beer creamy looking head with some lacing. It has a VERY strong aroma of vanilla and if you try hard you can smell some roasted malts, but the vanilla is so overwhelming it's a bit tough. It tastes very, very good, but it's so sweet that it would be very tough to drink more than one. Like most porters it does have the smokey flavor at the as an aftertaste, which is relieves the sweetness a little. Because it's so sweet, it really effects the mouth feel and drink ability. It's more of a ""dessert"" type beer. Drink it if you wanted something sweet after a meal. I'd actually recommend anyone to try this beer, but I don't know anyone who would be able to drink it on a regular basis."
"Overall: Interesting. Moderately enjoyable. I expected more from this beer. I didn't think the mouthfeel would be so medium, so that is where it will lack in score for me."
"This beer came to me as a beer of the month offer. I received several beers from the Atwater brewing Co. I prefer pale ales generally but was happy to receive this one. This is a desert beer. After dinner instead of a cup of coffee try one of these. I'm not an advocate of ""flavored beers"" but this one is one I'd like to try again. Very smooth finish."
"D - This is just the second beer I have ever drain poured. Thankfully I only purchased a single bottle."
"If you judge this on it's merrits it is a descent drinker, but judging it on porter characteristics it is pretty weak. Missing the earthy, grass/peaty, roast coffee/malt tones."
"Drinkability: The metallic flavor never really goes away. Interesting to try but I can't say I'd ever go for a second."
"medium to light body, average carbonation. the tinfoil mouthfeel kinda ruined this for me. not too bad of a beer, but definately not what the label suggests, and at the same time, a little too much of what the label suggests. ill finish the other 2 i have and leave it at that."
"M/D: Medium bodied, a bit too light for a porter, low carbonation. Pretty drinkable beer. Overall, it could use a little more porter character, but it's a decent beer as is. I'm quite surprised at this after looking over some of the other reviews. Overall, yes, the beer is ""over flavored"" but I still find myself liking the flavor more than being put off."
"If I am ever looking for a lawnmower porter, this is it."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my nonic pint glass. Appears a dark brown color with about a finger of fizzy, quickly fading tan foam. Smell and tastes of artificial vanilla flavorings, mild chocolate, somewhat sour as well. I picked up zero coffee notes. Rather thin bodied with an aftertaste that just drops off flat. Steer clear."
"Pours a two finger light tan head that fades quickly leaving a good lace. Brown/black opaque color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Coffee nose. Flavor is sweet coffee with a smooth vanilla finish. $2.05 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"3.0"
"D: The vanilla extract ruined a good coffee porter. Shame."
"Not the kind of beer that I would drink all night, but it was decent and a nice late night treat. I generally hate the term ""robust", but as a huge coffee drinker by day I must say that this beer was robust in the coffee sense of being a beer and quite enjoyable."
"Poured from a bottle into a small tumbler. Pitch black in color with moderate caramel head and no lacing. Smells of chocolate syrup and vanilla extract with some coffee and roasted malts. Taste is super sweet, lots of vanilla and hershey's then the sweet malts in the back. Light syrupy in texture, its dry with very low carbonation. Not my cup of tea or java for that matter. Recommended to those who like the sweetness."
"D - Sort of a strange porter. What I assume to be the vanilla component ends up overpowering the taste. This is not the first porter I'd reach for if I had a choice."
"D - Not the first porter that I'd drink if I was out at the bar but for one that was delivered to my doorstep for free its drinkable even though it falls short in the taste department"
"D - This is a disappointing beer for something marketed as a vanilla java porter. It's better suited to a robust porter, but even at that, it's not very outstanding. The astringency is somewhat unpleasant. I wouldn't recommend this beer."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a murky dark brown with a very small off white head. The head dissipates quickly leaving no lacing per se. Heavy vanilla and coffee notes in the nose give me hope. Mild carbonation with a somewhat astringent quality. It has a certain sourness that doesn't seem to pair well at all. Sweet with a very little bitterness. Dry. I don't get the coffee on the palate nearly as much as I did in the nose. Lighter in body and finishes fairly clean. As I was finishing this one, the flavors merged into a definite BBQ flavor. Very weird. It definitely didn't put it's namesake to very good use."
"D: Not overly strenuous to the palate or the liver. I could drink several, but on taste, one is certainly enough."
"D: This one doesn't deliver in my opinion. Falls short on body, balance, and overall character. There are MUCH better coffee porters out there, including Kona Pipeling Porter"
"Overall, this is a reasonable beer. It certainly could be improved upon but I would at least be willing to give it a try if I hadn't had one before."
" D: I reciver this beer from a beer of the month club i thought it was very drinkable but i dont see my self going out and buying a case maybe if i ever see it in a bar i would have a cupple agian"
"i guess it could be easy to drink due to it's light body, but i never wanted another sip, for it really puckered me up like i had to french a frog. it seemed as though they just threw in artificial flavors to keep vamping it up.... i ended the misery by pouring the last third down"
"D- I enjoyed this much better from the tap but the bottle version is not that far off. Not as creamy or smooth from the bottle though. A low abv makes this good for a session beer, but i won't be going out of my way for this one. I paired this with some steak which was a nice way to go, just wish this was put together better, right now it's undrinkable"
"Dark brown with ruby highlights, lots of white sediment floating around, thin head that disappeared quickly leaving no lacing. Aroma has some nice caramel and vanilla notes, backed up by a decent coffee aroma and light chocolate. Taste is is pretty much the same, but with some notes of fruit and licorice and some sourness. Vanilla isn't too noticeable, but what vanilla flavor is in there it seems artificial. Decent coffee notes, but nothing great. Nothing complex about this one. Mouthfeel is a little too thin and watery for a porter. Not bad, but not very good either."
"poured a murky dark brown with a short light tan quickly fading head and some fading lace. coffee aroma was there but just above the weak level. first taste was very sweet but on the second and third you start picking up the roasted malt and fresh coffee and vanilla although the vanilla is weak. mouthfeel felt a little watery for a good porter its worth a try but i have had better."
"A nice beer but it doesn't hit the java and vanilla like I would like."
"Pours a dark black with thin to little off-white head that disappears quickly. Very little clarity, but filtered. Has a little collar and very little laciness. Aroma reminds me of kahlua. Taste is also of kahlua, with a definite vanilla presence and some coffee in the aftertaste. Viscous but smooth texture with a medium body that is not heavy. Decent beer that I did not mind the differences. A little sweet for a session beer."
"D: This one tastes pretty decent, but overall it comes across as a very pedestrian porter with some vanilla and coffee flavors added to give the impression of depth. That's not to say that they've failed, necessarily, just that they didn't aim high enough to begin with."
"Very interesting. I could really only drink one, but it's a decent enough beer."
"Overall: This is a good beer although I think it could use slight improvement. acidic roasted flavor and cardboard aroma are my 2 major complaints, coffee and vanillia could be more noticable. other than that this is a drinkable beer."
"D - Not too harsh, yet not too bland. ABV in check. I would say a beer that you don't have to think too hard about, yet enjoy."
"Now, perhaps I got a bottle past its prime here (didn't check the label for date) or maybe a bad batch from the brewery but this brew was not nearly as good to me as some of the other reviews here. In taste and smell it resembled a botched home brew of a brown ale I did a month back.Those will all be drain pours."
"I got this in my beer of the month club. I poured a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. It pours a dark brown with a thin white head. The aroma is dominated by vanilla, I really do not notice any other smells. The flavor is sweet and dominated by vanilla. The coffee in this one takes a back seat. The beer is a bit on the thin side and could use some more carbonation. The beer is not hard to drink. I like vanilla so I liked the beer."
"Bottle. Pours a very dark brown, almost cola like, small tan head that disappears quickly. Aroma is of roast coffee and slight vanilla and chocolate. Taste is coffee, kind of an extract vanilla and chocolate flavor, but not in a bad way. Easy to drink and enjoyable."
"D - it was a ""one and done"" beer for me but I would ""do it"" again."
"d: pretty bad. i think the sweet vanilla made an average beer pretty horrible. i love coffee and/or vanilla stouts/porters, but i won't be buying this again. it looked tasty on the shelf but resist the urge!"
"Relatively easy to sip or gulp. Probably would go nicely with ice cream."
"I wish i could be more constructive but i just found this to absolutely horrible."
"Pretty much middle of the road."
"Unless they change the recipe, I hope to never have this beer again."
"Drinkability: one bottle was more than enough. The flavor profile is not balanced and I was looking for a different beer after finishing this one."
"Drinkability is low just because it's so damn strange. I was waiting for vanilla and java to hit me and it never does."
"D. Pretty easily."
"D: Low, this is a strong coffee porter which could only be drank once in a while or whenever in the mood for a strong java porter. I dont see myself buying this in the future because I believe there are better porters out there."
"Pours dark brown with ruby tints when held to the light. Thin dark tan head that doesnt last at all. no lacing. Aroma is of roasted coffee and malts. Body is very thin with no carbonation at all. Taste is of roasted coffee, malt and vanilla. Not very well balanced. Has a nasty mouthfeel and avery low drinkability due to the lack of carbonation."
"D: Would not buy again.. Don't know if I will finish this one.. Where is the vanilla at???"
"I like coffee in my beer. I like vanilla in my beer, too. But I much prefer the real thing, beans in both cases, and it just doesn't taste real here. Oddly, they come together to be more than just a throwaway, but not by enough to make it worth seeking out and drinking a second time."
"I bought a 6 pack of this @ Martha's in GR- not impressed overall- i have a feeling that this would be a better draft beer, but in the bottle the overall combination was just all off. It smelled wonderful, but then when I took that first sip, the mouthfeel was just thin and lacking in body. When I poured it into a glass, it developed a good head which rapidly vanished- not the full feel of a good porter- it did smell phenomenal- that I will grant- I would give this beer another shot on draft, but out of the bottle, maybe not so much."
"Drinkable for one, but not two."
"Like most porters, it was very smooth and easy to drink, and at 6% alcohol, the buzz can sneak up on you."
" some of these adjuncts are very over-done which limits the drinkability."
"D - Wouldn't throw it out, but not something I would seek out either. I got it for free, and that is what it's worth."
"D: Average drinkability, a little thinner and lighter then expected with diminishing hopes deeper into the drink. Somehow thought with the Java labeling in the name this would carry a more roasted nature and was a little disappointed with it overall. On the fence with this one, but was barely worth the price of admission and wouldn't waste my time on a sixpack or go out of my way to recommend it."
"Atwater Block's Vanilla Java Porter. ABV 6%. The pour is smooth, with very low carbonation. A frothy, tan head emerges, then quickly dissipates. A great aroma of roasted coffee beans, with hints of vanilla in the nose. The taste is a little thinner than I was expecting, but with a balanced flavor of malt, coffee, and vanilla, with no noticeable hop bite. I was disappointed when there was no appearance of brewer's lace on the side of my clean 16oz pint glass. This is an easy drinking beer, not the bigger beer I was expecting, based on the unique flavor description on the bottle. I have had a few porters and stouts brewed with coffee beans before, but this was my first beer with vanilla. I could drink a couple of these, before moving onto something else."
"The burnt edges and sourish notes and too much sweetness combine to make this less than desirable for more than one. It somehow manages to stay above ""drainpour"" for me, and is not ""terrible", as it has some potential, I suppose, but I would have no desire to have this again."
"Bad, I mean unreasonably bad. The aroma is quite sweet with old coffee, an ash tray, burnt malt, and a tini-tiny bit of vanilla. (whiffing to detect the vanilla was difficult because the cigarette butt smell was making me sick) The appearance is dark red brown with an average tan head. The flavor has all the elements from the aroma plus vegetable stir fry heavy on the bell peppers. The palate is actually smooth but this is one incredibly nasty beer!"
"It pours a rich black color with a nice tan head. The nose is malty with a touch of the alcohol, no vanilla coffee standing out in the nose which is disappointing.The taste is good much better as it warms up. Nice depth of flavor to it the vanilla and coffee some out in the end but it takes a bit for you to find those flavors."
"Notes from 5/24/07"
"D- It's not bad as an after-dinner drink as I had it. I wouldn't want to drink one before a meal or more than a pint or two in an evening. It may not be the ""best"" porter I've had, but it's far from the worst."
"Nothing worth trying here in my opinion."
"This brew has a really funky taste. I'm was suprised to taste this much fruityness in a porter."
"Thick, oily, smooth. A solid stout. Bitter, then sweet, then sour. Quite nice."
"Pours dark brown with ruby highlights when held to light. Thin white head very little retention and no lacing. Aroma is of roasted coffee and malts.Body is thin and fizzy.Taste is of roasted coffee and vanilla. Not very well balanced. Worth a try barley!"
"D: Ths beer is like drinking what is left in the bottom of a scalded coffee pot with a little astrigent mixed in. I will never drink this again."
"Well this beer certainly sounds good but let me tell ya... it's not. Everything about this beer feels rushed. It's pretty watery for a porter and the flavor is just awful. Some hints of vanilla but it's just so hard to get down with the other awful flavors. Probably the worst beer I've tried in my young beer tasting career."
"D: I will not finish this beer. Maybe it was a bad bottle. It tastes like ass."
"I won't be purchasing this again, and I will think twice before trying anything else from Atwater."
"I'm going to chalk this up to potentially not the right bottle, but after having a few porters and a few other coffee brews, this is not the greatest out there. The vanilla was lacking for me, and the coffee taste was good, but just didn't mate as well as I would have liked. Perhaps if it had more of a boozy warming sensation to go with the warming I naturally associate with coffee, I'd feel better about it (I hate cold coffee). Just got this on a whim at Beers of the World, and next time I'll know better."
"Taste: Despite the name, the overall taste somewhat let me down... I was definitely expecting more vanilla on the tongue... Overall, more or less your basic porter... Medium-bodied mouthfeel... Decent level of drinkability... Nothing too exciting... Doesn't really stand out... Good, but certainly not great..."
"Poored a dark brown/black unable to hold glass to light and see through. Head was about nonexistent and quickly dissipated. Taste as advertised very strong burnt coffee taste with a slight hint of vanilla, unfortunately the taste just isn't pleasant to me. Reading the bottle where it states it's a malt beverage brewed with coffee beans and vanilla extract added seems a bit like cheating to me... personal preference"
"D- Avoid this one. It's just not good. The concept is there but it misses the mark on many different aspects. I was kinda shocked that this one wasn't better. How could you go wrong with coffee and vanilla? This one somehow went wrong."
"Overall- Another Atwater beer thats starts off good but fizzles. Very good aroma and initial sip but is just lacking near the bottom. Worthy of trying though!"
"D: Easy drinking if compared to Miller Lite or other BMC beers, but considering there are so many other excellent porters out there, this beer is an otherwise big disappointment."
"A big ""psssfffftt"" as I uncap it. Usually not a good sign. I pour a half glass of foam with a careful pour. Usually not a good sign. Smells weird. Usually not a good sign. Tastes bad. Definitely not a good sign. No redeeming qualities to this beer. Overcarbonated and astringent. No good tastes. I'm not gonna drink this one."
"D - Never again. This is not good beer."
"M- light/medium in body, no where near as chewy as it should be at least. This one was a borderline disappointment."
"This is a pretty bad tasting beer. Its like Java pop soda that went bad and they made beer out of it. We payed $9 for the six pack.. This is not a high end beer nor is it worth $9 I would say its more like a $5 six.. Very different is the best thing I can say about it. I wouldn't bother with it."
"this one is lacking vanilla flavor, in fact i dont taste it at all, i do notice nice dark malt and a strong black coffiee flavor, at the end i notace some hops balanceing this one out. this is disapointang to me, i love coffiee, vanilla and porter so this one had great potential, but the only thing this one does well is the coffiee"
"D: Just had a quick pint. Not bad but not something I would actively seek out again. The Kuhnhenn creme brule java stout is a much better beer if you are looking for something along these lines."
"This type of beer is right up my alley, I've had quite a few of these and look forward to trying new ones. Pours a nice light chocolate brown in color, dense tan head fades fairly quick. The coffee taste comes across as more of a bitter instant coffee with mild sweetness. Tried 2-3 sips to adjust to the bitterness and find some vanilla, but no luck. I was disappointed and barely finished the 1 bottle. Sorry, but didn't care for it."
"Grabbed it before I jumped the border, again, at Port Huron, MI and sampled this one a few months later. Poured out of the bottle an opaque brown with almost no permeating light. Khaki head one finger thick did not retain well but the lacing was good. Great aroma of bold, Kona coffee, malt sweetness and some vanilla. The flavors were dominated by the espresso-like richness of coffee roasted malt sweetness in the middle and a biter coffee finish again at the end. The vanilla character is hard to discern and was more distinct in the fresh bottles I sampled as opposed to this aged one. The heavy body is punctuated by medium/high carbonation. More one dimensional with time but still quite enjoyable."
"I love a beer that delivers what it advertises. The vanilla extract is very nice, not too sweet or over the top, but provides flavor. The sweetness mixed with the coffee beans makes this a simple, yet special beer. Highly enjoyable beer to drink."
"Looked nice. Typical of the style. Smell was much too boozy. Vanilla smell was more artificial, extract style rather than a true vanilla bean scent. Taste followed the nose closely. No coffee that i could detect. Very thin, watery mouthfeel. Won't be coming back to this one."
"Dark chestnut brown with a whipped tan head, minimal lacing. Smells of cocoa, coffee and vanilla dominate the nose. Tastes like a sort of coffee soda, highly carbonated and a little too sweet for my taste. Lots of vanilla coffee but not enough beer flavor for me, very faint maltiness and no real hop flavor to speak of. Thin, fizzy mouthfeel, like a vanilla coffee coke. Not my favorite."
"Notes: This one is so incredible for a cold fall or winter day or night to warm one up rather nicely. Cheers"
"This merges the vanilla and coffee flavors well, but there's virtually no porter-like characteristics left. Maybe there are too many competing flavors going on, but it ends up being more like vanilla-coffee than any beer complemented by those spices. An interesting idea that needs some tweaking."
"Pours a deep blackish-brown with a thick full three fingers of light brown foamy head, very much like a rootbeer float. Smells sweetly of coffee beans, vanilla bean, and cocoa powder. Taste opens to a light watered down coffee flavor, faintest notes of vanilla, sweet maltiness. Has an odd characteristic of a metallic twinge to the tongue, lingers through the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation, a little rough on the tongue. Drinkability suffers due to the lack of any strong characteristics that make for a good porter in my book."
"Served in a standard pint glass. Poured a dark, opaque brown with a one inch effervescing, khaki-colored head that eventually settled into a broken skim that concentrated into a solid band around the edges of the glass. Ruby red highlights exposed when tilted for a quaff; some thin strands of lacing present during the tasting. Scents of malt, roasted coffee and vanilla; maybe a little wood as well. Taste is much more subdued than the nose and somewhat disappointing considering the boldness of the nose. Also detected a little bit of a citrus-quality, which threw the coffee flavor completely off. Mouthfeel was somewhat watery with a consistent level of carbonation throughout the mouth. Drinkability was not great on this one. Too much of a muddle of flavors, combined with the weak mouthfeel, make this an unlikely repeater for me."
"When can you drink this beer? I don't know. It's too heavy and additive-tasting to be enjoyed with a meal, it's the farthest thing from hot-weather beer...maybe coming in from the snow, you could drink this in place of hot chocolate. It would probably would warm you up more, I would think."
"D-- not a favorite and not a beer to sit and relax with"
"My dead hamster could poop in a puddle and do a better job."
"D: Another disappointing Atwater offering with thinness throughout. Not a high performer."
"drinkability - I expected too much from this. Has the words, Robust poter, chocolate malt, coffee bean, vanilla extract. That is all they ahd to say to make me buy it. If they layed off the sour taste and the bitterness. Then this would be a great beer. I wouldn't buy it again."
"D- For a ""novelty"" beer, this one is actually quite good and well-made. Very smooth for a java based brew. I wil definitely seek this one out again."
"D. Drink this beer slow. Enjoy the flavors as they linger on till your next sip. Uniqu style of beer. Stays with you throughout the night. A sipper and then move on."
"Taste unfortunately goes down even further. Extremely sour! I have no idea if I have had a bad bottle but the sourness was really too pugent for me. Is this suppoed to be the vanilla? Very odd indeed, hopefully a bad bottle, but sure I will try it again. Unfortunately a drainpour..."
"This is one you pour immediately - unfortunately the server at the restaurant I was at brought the bottle over and opened and kindly offered to get me a new glass (it was my second brew of the night). The beer started to foam out of the bottle like a snakehead, and when I finally poured it in the glass it was ALL foam. A good tan head that died at a medium pace, but just too much. Oh well. A good lace ring left with a blackish body, but a rather fainter than I expected vanilla smell like it was not pure vanilla malt but substitute vanilla extract. More coffee stout than anything I tasted, the vanilla malt is barely noticeable. A medium body that is somewhat filling but this is a rather basic stout with no standout qualities. Smooth and creamy and enjoyable, but just not something I'd seek out again."
"Not one that I will try again."
"A good concept for a porter, but poor execution with this one makes for a very uneventful experience. The beer poured very dark into the glass with minimal head and even less lacing. I like my porters thick and heavy but this one was neither. Not much in the aroma department, you could tell that it was going to be malty and slightly sweet but that's about it. Very light on the mouth and throat, feels more like an ale than a porter. The taste is decent at best, in fact it's borderline bland. The vanilla is subtle which works nice, but what this beer is lacking are the complex dark roasted malts that are standard with porters. Not an awful beer by any means, but absolutely disapointing."
"D- this disappointed me quite a bit. im sure i wont have this one again"
"Hmm, I had much higher hopes for this beer. The 'vanilla/java' taste promised is delivered on a very lackluster scale. As mentioned earlier, a well roasted beer yes, but there wasn't enough of the other flavors to demand any spectacular raving review. If you like Porters like 'Oatmeal' or 'Breakfast'.... give this a shot, you may love it. Personally one was plenty, just not my bag baby."
"I had high hopes for this one. How can you go wrong with a name like Vanilla Java Porter? Those are all good things. Unfortunately, it reminds me of none of them. Pouring the whole thing into a glass at once, it forms about an inch of head, with no lace down the sides of the glass. No smell to speak of. It's not sweet or thick like many porters, and if there's any vanilla or coffee flavor to it, it's faint to the point of disappearance. It's not objectionable, but it's not really much of anything at all. It's at least recognizable as a well-roasted dark beer, unlike some really bad ones I've had that might as well be Miller with food coloring. I'll finish off the pack with no complaints, but I won't be buying it again."
"A nice surprise. Nothing that I'd have on a regular basis, but a nice treat every once in a while."
"Notes:	A great porter reminds me of Rogue's American porter. And it came from Michigan! Still things can surprise me"
"good, though!"
"Thin bodied with high carbonation. This is a full flavored beer, but the tastes are slightly off and not as advertised. The flavor matches the aroma with an (now) expected spiciness. No vanilla, some coffee."
"D: A decent beer to have after dinner."
"Boasts a sweet flavor that strongly resembles a Starbucks Frappuccino. It's extremely smooth, and would be perfect as an after-dinner beer, at least if you mixed it with something else, like if you made a beer float with some vanilla ice cream. On its own, there's not enough malt, and it's way too watery."
"Decided to grab a single bottle of this at the store. Poured in to an Ommegang chalice a dark dark brown, just a shade or two away from being black. Attractive hues can also be seen at the bottom of the glass. Smell is pretty good, has a pleasant milk chocolate, caramel, and slight coffee nose. Taste is blander than expected, with the caramel, java and chocolate tastes floating around. but never really coming together. Body is a disappointment in that there really seems to be something missing. Perhaps a bit more malt? I dunno, but it leaves me without much to talk about. One is more than enough for me. This one isn't terrible, but like I said, there is something missing. Definitely a beer that could use some improvement. Cheers"
"Drinkability is very good. This beer left me satisfied and happy after it was all done. It was nice, filling, and brought on the right level of buzz; seriously, this was a nice surprise and it couldn't have come on a better deal."
"Mouthfeel was kind of watery to me with some good carbonation it's a descent brew. I'd buy a sixer of this if I was looking for something flavorful but light on a nice fall night."
"Drinkability is not very good on this. Even if one liked this, I couldn't see drinking many more than one of these. I just don't think the tastes really come together on this beer."
"Had a tasting of various new beers to hit our area- Pours a thin oil-like consistency into a shaker pint. Thin off white head disapates quickly. Smells of vanilla and some coffee, then alcohol. Tastes like flat vanilla coke. Not much carbonation and not alot going on tastewise, even though I get some flavors of vanilla, coffee, and roasted malts- they all seem artificial. Very watery mouthfeel, will not seek out again."
"D-It was a near dump dur to teh off flavors. I will not be having this again."
"A good beer overall. A little rich and creamy with bold flavors - limits the consumption."
"A tasty porter with a hint of coffee and vanilla. Rich porter mouthfeel, I am partial to porters and stouts, and I would count this brew among my top 10. ABV comes in at 6%. I'd recommend this brew to any fan of stouts and porters to enjoy. Take a six home and try it!"
"Drinkability - I can't get past the taste of something being burnt. I wouldn't drink this again."
"Pours very dark cola color with a minimal amount of light brown foam. The smell is sweet maple syrup with some dark coffee grounds and vanilla extract. More bitterness than sweetness in the flavor. Black coffee grounds with roasted black malts and some vanilla cola-like sweetness. Medium bodied while remaining a bit watery with minimal acidic carbonation. This stuff is not great."
"Black beer with very dark highlights when held to light. No head or visible bubbling. For sucha dark beer, the liquid itself doesn't seem very thick. The aroma is cheap and tart and pungent coffee grounds. The front of the tongue is a good mix of light roasted vanilla and morning roast coffee. Then the middle flashes quickly turns a bit acidic and cheap tasting as far as coffee goes. Th finish is a dark roasted prune mixed with a more mellow morning roast style coffee flavor. The mouthfeel is quick, but a little acidic. Reminds me of ceap coffee in the work cafeteria."
"Almost black with a tan head. Aromas of cherry pipe tobacco and distant warnings of the Atwater curse (bacterial contamination). There is some coffee notes in the flavor and not much vanilla. There is an acidic tang that is curiously out of place. The curse? Perhaps. Oxidation? A little. Medium body and a bitter acidic finish - possibly the coffee aspect. Strike two for Atwater? You bet."
"D - I would have maybe 2 of these in a session. The taste is pretty strong, so this is something definitely better for later in a session. Overall not bad, especially for a porter."
"Pours a jet black, with a light tan. In the aroma, vanilla, coffee, with hints of chocolate and caramel. In the taste, mainly cocoa, and a small presence of vanilla. A very smooth and cocoa-ish mouthfeel, kinda gritty, and a dry cocoa aftertaste. Big flavor, and quite smooth."
"This beer was recommended to me by the waitress and the restaurant I was at. It had an exceptional appearance in the glass, nice deep and robust looking. It had a nice head or tannish foam. I definately detected the vanilla and coffee aromas in it. I liked the way it finished and would reccommend it to anyone wno is a coffee and beer fanatic."
"M&D: Mouthfeel is generally good but just a little bit thin on the tongue after a few seconds. Don't get me wrong, I really liked this but compared to other porters, this one is just a little thin. As for drinkability, this goes down so smooth and easy that I could enjoy several in a row before considering something else. Give this one a try. Good stuff."
"Drinkability is moderate. The low level of alcohol makes for easy consumption, but the flavor and body would get annoying after a few."
"Pours black with a light brown head. Heavy lacing. Smells just as the name implies. Heavy coffee aroma with a hint of vanilla. Kind of smells like a coffee that has vanilla flavored creamer in it but transformed into a porter. Smells great. And tastes awesome. Tastes likes a perfectly brewed porter with the exact amount of coffee and vanilla flavor that there should be. Not too overpowering and not too faint. But exactly right. It has the consistancy of of thin fizzy milkshake. Very easy to drink. I think this beer's getting the highest rating I've ever given a beer and therefore must be my favorite beer. I have to say that I agree with that logic. This is my new favorite beer... Or at least a tie..."
"This is my favorite beer i discovered it a few months ago and pick up a draft every chance i get. I am not usually a huge fan of flavored beers but i feel that they nailed this one. It has a nice strong smell and taste of both coffee and vanilla. The appearance is a deep dark color almost that of a strong coffee. I am not totally sure how you would judge mouthfeel at this point but it seems smooth not too carbonated just a nice feel hopefully that is what is meant by this. I would highly rate this beer to anyone. I dont know how it is in a bottle i am trying to find some but on tap it is just great."
"This beer was given to me by a friend telling me I needed to try it. I was impressed with it's color deep and black. Before I could even bring the glass close I got a wafting of vanilla. I thought it was a little lean in the mouth. I wanted more of a round mouthfeel, but the flavors of molassis, vanilla and roasty chocolate malts more than enough to turn me in to a fan. A great choice as an after dinner beer or to pair with dessert."
"Eh, this is nothing special at all. Not much flavor, not much to get excited about."
"Not a bad beer but I have had much better java/ vanilla porters."
"D - Very easy to drink w/ a lot going on, yet nice malt and coffee interplay and the twang in the vanilla w/ a husky bean oil and malt mix. Very quaffable - went well w/ teriyaki chicken and rice a roni."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, it's not the type of beer that I would want to pound down several of, but it's a good enjoyable beer to sit and relax with and drink just a couple."
"The beer pours a deep, dark brown/black color with a 1/2"" fizzy tan head that quickly fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a robust, black malt and coffee scent along with a slight vanilla aroma. The taste is average. It has a very bitter coffee taste that goes down with ease, but finishes dry with a very light vanilla flavor. The mouthfeel is average. It is a full bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This beer sounded great, but the reality was a bit disappointing. The vanilla was hard to decipher and the coffee taste was overbearing. Also, the mouthfeel was really lacking. It was too thin and carbonated too much."
"Pours a dark brown with a light tan head that is pretty big, but pretty light in thickness. It has a nice roasty malt smell with some good hints of chocolate and coffee. Not too much vanilla in the aroma. The taste is good for a porter, but not as hit-you-in-the-mouth as I was hoping for. It has a nice chocolatey coffee roasted malt flavor with some hints of vanilla in the aftertaste which is nice. It has an OK mouthfeel and it is pretty drinkable. I liked it as a porter and I would get this more often if I could."
"Pours very dark brown, almost black, like coffee. Not much of a head. Smells like cream soda. Tastes like cream soda and coffee. Rather sweet, but some roasted bitterness. Not bad, but this is just a little weird for me. Vanilla-flavored coffee always seems a bit artificial and perfumed to me, and I get some of that impression in this beer. Well-carbonated and not too heavy. Overall not too bad, but I don't think I'll be reaching for it again soon."
"drinkability: high"
"Bleagh, couldn't finish this one."
"Body is too light, especially for the style. More body would make this outstanding. A great change of pace beer but not an every day one. A damn fine dessert beer though."
"Pours pitch black with a tan head that is very airy and bubble filled. Nose is strongest with roasted coffee tones. Mild vanilla there yes. Wow. What a weird flavor. On the first swig, I got such an oddly sweet hit that I didnt think I would be able to have another sip, let alone finish the whole damn thing. I hoped it would turn into something else as time went on, but it didnt. Way too tangy. Just sings a bit too high. Feel is okay on the liquid and it has a pretty high carbonation. But overall this is one unbalanced beer. Such a weird tangy thing going on that I just cant hang."
"okay, so 6 years later I'm trying this again and liked it."
"This is a nice novelty beer. Very dark with just a small head that disipates pretty quickly. Medium body. Nice aroma presages the full flavors, with only minimal hoppiness. As advertised, it comes through with a complex array of coffee and chocolate with a vanilla finish. My personal bias is toward hoppy beers, but this was a pleasant switch from the routine on a cold winter night."
"The bottom line: flavoured beers like this tread a fine line, and Atwater goes too far into the vanilla territory for me, as that flavour dominates the rest of the beer and destroys any other porter characteristics. Not my favourite version of the style."
"The vanilla is even more overstated in the taste than the nose. Some late coffee notes, more porter typical. The tate is too sweet and gimicky but its the texture that really lets you down here. Not watery, but thin and spineless. Great name, great look, subpar porter."
"D- It was reasonably drinkable. The mouthfeel wasn't as good as I expected so it brought the beer down a little. Still, good flavor, good smell and good appearance makes is a beer I'd try again."
"Very interesting. This is definitely a desert beer. I don't think I could do more than one of these. It has a big vanilla smell. You smell more vanilla than you taste. The coffee flavor tastes like the ""coffee"" flavor, if that makes sense, maybe it's because of the vanilla. It almost doesn't even seem like a beer at times though. Mouthfeel isn't a heavy as I would expect either. I was expecting an oatmeal stout kind of mouthfeel. Definitely try it, but try it before you buy it."
"Taste is thin as well. More in the taste than the smell; lots of vanilla and very little coffee. It would be easy to let the coffee dominate the vanilla so I guess they toned it down a bit. Some grassy notes in the hops, a little earth and leather. Feels very thin and is pretty well carbonated, kinda bloating. Many better porters out there that don't use coffee to get more of a coffee taste and more vanilla taste without using vanilla extract."
"D: If I can ignore the smell, this beer is very drinkable for a strongish porter. Unfortunately, I can't, and it makes this one a bit tougher to handle."
"Michigan is overrun with good-great breweries. After having had two of their offerings, I feel safe in saying that Atwater Block isn't among them. Not even close, really. Vanilla Java Porter needs a complete overhaul. Adding some malt to the hops, yeast and water would be a good place to start."
"Brown colored beer with an aroma of coffee beans.Taste is mostly of coffee and I'm having trouble detecting any vanilla.Aftertaste actually tastes like I just drank a 22oz.cup of coffee.This isn't a great beer but it doesn't suck either.I would drink again only if offered to me though."
"Drinkability: Not overly pleasant, either in taste or aroma. Also, painfully overcarbonated."
"Overall - an unusual flavor, so it was probably worth trying once, but it's not one I'll buy again."
"Flavor/Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Infected, came off as a bretty sour mess. I don't usually do this, but after reading a few other reviews, it appears that this is not only common with Atwater brews, but with this one in particular. Hopefully, buyer beware, some of their other brews don't seem half bad."
"This is a ""quality control view"". I have had this beer once before and it was nice; very sweet and creamy with hints of chocolate and coffee. However, I bought a 6 pack of this a few days ago and this is the second beer from the group. I was hoping the first beer was a fluke ... they were both terrible. This may or may not have been the breweries fault, but I write this review so that people can be aware (perhaps just people who buy their beer in Tallahassee or Publix) that this beer may not be up to par."
"Definitely a style I'm in interested in - I like coffee beers. But this was a drain pour."
"dug it, get it if you can"
"D- This is a very drinkable and quite enjoyable brew. Its not as heavy as other porters and is quite sessionable. Not the best of the style but still tasty and something I will definately have again."
"Overall, I was quite impressed with this beer. It was much more drinkable than I figured it would be. I rarely drink porters or stouts these days, but this one was enjoyable and makes me somewhat sad I don't have another one to drink. I won't buy the dunkel and IPA again, but I wouldn't mind trying another porter. Give this one a try, and hopefully you'll get a ""good"" bottle."
"Full bodied fat daddy beer, a sixer of these will put a couple pounds on you  and I now weigh a few pounds more. I need to get another sixer of these in the winter for some football watching Sundays."
"Hadn't really meant to buy this beer, but when I got home I discovered that someone had slipped this into a sixpack of the IPA. Poured an appropriate dark chestnut. Aroma was mildly sugary a waft of vanilla. Some roasted malt bittering and caramel-toffee sweetness. Vanilla was not overpowering, and more of a vanilla bean than extract flavoring. Coffee notes were present, but seemed too far in the background. I felt the coffee needed more presence to balance the vanilla. Net effect was a bit bland, not really punchy enough to qualify as an after dinner drink."
"Not a very good porter here."
"Poured a brownish-black with a huge, 3"" foamy head from a soft pour. Unfortunately, the head settled too quickly. Smell is slightly peppery and astringent. Some aroma of vanilla, but extremely faint. There is a sour smell associated with this, but I can't quite place it; maybe DMS. Taste is smoky and a bit sour. There is definitely some DMS going on here with a strong, cooked chili pepper flavor. No vanilla. No java. I can't get beyond the chili pepper taste. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and wll carbonated, but a little slick. Drinkability? Not very. I wish that the vanilla and java flavors were here, but I couldn't detect them. I drank half of this and poured the rest out. I don't like to give poor reviews, but there was something definitely wrong with this batch. With that in mind, I am willing to try this once more. I just hope that it's not a repeat of what is written here."
"Drinkability: As I said, it was a little rough at first but grew easier with every taste. There was minor hang and it went down smooth. Not a session beer by any means, but good enough for try once and a while to change things up a bit."
"Looks like a typical stout, really dark, decent head at first but poor lacing. Strong coffee aroma, a little chocolatey, a little burnt. Taste was awful. Overwhelming vanilla that just didn't work well with the beer. Didn't finish the beer, that bad. I bought this as a single, so I can't say if this was just a bad batch or not. From what I've read from other reviews. maybe they are just a little inconsistent and this one was hit with too much vanilla. Don't think I'm going to buy another to find out though."
"Overall, it's a pretty good beer. I'll try any porter I can get my hands on, and while this isn't among the best I've had, it's not bad at all, and I'd definitely try it again."
"Drinkability - any bottle labeled vanilla Java porter gets an automatic try from me, but this was a little disappointing. It's okay but not on my short list."
"Atwater Vanilla Java Porter pours a dark brown with a minimal head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. At first this beer was too cold and was exhibiting something that I'm finding a lot in these java flavored beers, it tasted like green pepper. I find this to be very unappealing in a beer. Fortunately, as it warmed the green pepper like flavor receded. This left me with something that was coffee flavored and there was a hint of vanilla too. I'd rate this a bit low on the drinkability scale, I split one with someone and had a hard time finishing it. Overall, I'd have to say I wouldn't buy this again."
"Worth a try."
"D: Several years ago I made several business trips to Detroit. Each time, I visited the MGM Grand and routinely ordered their vanilla porter. Here I am, six years later drinking something that is incredibly similar and what does my drinkin' companion, Deuane, say? ""Atwater, yeah that is Detroit."" Ahh! Yet another beer mystery solved, this is the MGM Grand Vanilla Porter."
"I think this one wins the award for most pudding references in a single review. I thought the flavors here were pretty solid, but slightly in disagreement with each other. Tasty for sure, but not mind blowing. Looking at other reviews, I feel grateful for trying this on draught and not out of the bottle."
"Drinkability is above average due to it's crisp & wet with a low ABV appeal, but that's where it ends."
"Overall: A good choice for coffee/java porter fans. Unremarkable overall but still a decent and enjoyable brew. Worth a try."
"pours a dark chocolate with no head, sat at the bar too long i suppose. Roasted aroma, sweet taste and a smooth mouth feel. A little heavy. This beer is a great desert beer, or winter/chilly weather beer. I love to see this on tap or in bottle, gives me the option/opportunity to open the doors to non beer drinkers, and also is a good anchor beer, when indecisive."
"Thin and fizzy. This seemed like a great idea, but didn't seem to come together very well."
"Drinkability: Not as challenging as other coffee beers, this is nevertheless an enjoyable brew that I liked better than most of the other reviewers to date"
"And the new brews keep rolling into Central Kentucky. Found this one at Wines on Vine (go figure.) This seems to be a beer with a lot of promise and potential... this means that it really isn't there yet. Opens up with a burst of roasted grains and coffee, with back-up notes of cocoa and cream. The color is a nearly opaque, dark brown with a somwhat fizzy head retention. Robust looking, jut a bit flat. The flavors are bold charcoal and coffee, but little after that. The vanilla is barely detected and there seems to be an overbearing coffee / fermentation sourness that won't let any other nuances shine enough to make a difference. The beer seems under-malted, which hurts the flavor roundedness and textrues. The beer is fast fleeting, leaving a powdery, dry coating and lingering coffee bitterness. The beer is intriguing and certainly worth the try, but would buy many more if improved."
"Overall, a tasty porter upfront but disappoints in its lack of boldness, weak coffee taste and funky dirty water taste."
"from the bottle, poured black with a brown head. aroma bitter sweet chocolate, coffee, malt, some sourness, just got a hint of vanilla. flavor, roasted malt, chocolate, smoke, and than the vanilla sugar as it warms. a little thin on the mouth feel but not to bad"
"Its all spent coffee grounds through the fore and middle. Some roastiness and muted sweetness appear toward the backend. A hint of chocolate along with mild vanilla notes pops up in the aftertaste. Its not a great beer, but its not great in an approachable way. Its the kind of beer youd never go out of your way for, but that youd probably always finish a pint of. The mouthfeel is actually pretty good for the style, might even be slightly thicker than standard."
"Overall a pretty disappointing beer. Porters are my fav. type of beer and I like vanilla and coffee in my beer but this was just a pour mix of them. The whole beer just feels unbalanced."
"Pours thick and black, with a dark brown, burnt brown sugar colored head. Soft roasted malt aromas, very coffee like, with a only a touch of vanilla. A flash of bitterness up front, sweet malts, and substantial but not overplayed bitter vanilla note. Full bodied with medium cabonation, but not overly heavy. This is a drinkable, sessionish vanilla porter, with some delectable vanilla notes but not so much that you're sick of the flavor halfway through the glass. Very good."
"Meduim bodied, towards light for a porter. Smooth, good drinkability,easy going, just not a lot of reason for sessions. An average porter,nothing fancy,very predictable. Not a much of a vanilla presence as expected from the label. Not a bad beer. I think I just expected a little more from this offering."
"Overall: Quality flavors, a little one sided, and becomes way too light. A solid stab nonetheless. It is refreshing."
"Very nice beer to drink in the winter time!"
"Full bodied, but not overly enjoyab;e. Worth a try, I guess."
"Maybe I was set-up from excellent previous experience with coffee porters. I had high expectations for this beer and this beer didn't meet them."
"I got 2 of these and i think i give the other one away, too see if i'm missing something here."
"These Atwater brews are just hitting the Pittsburgh market and so far I'm not impressed, they are a bit more expensive than other 12oz bottles too. Appearance has a dark cola brown hue with some red highlights forming around the edges of the pint glass forms a thin tan moccha colored head leaves behind minimal lacing. Aromatics...it comes heavy with the vanilla, light coffee seems like some extract was utilized in this one no natural whole beans here very sweet mild chocolate roastiness minimal herbal hops. Taste is syrupy cloying with the vanilla extract character with a good amount of bitterness to somewhat balance it between the mild hops and dark roasts finishes with a slight lactic tartness that I didn't care for. Mouthfeel is medium bodied lighter carbonation does leaves that syrupy feel on the palate. Drinkability...seriously I will pass just make a normal stout if your going to kill the base beer with extract, not a huge fan of this one."
"I poured this 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. A very sharp looking beer, nice dark rich brown, almost black, tan head. The smell is all coffee and maybe slight anise, not getting the vanilla. The taste is much the same, but I find the flavors too sharp. The carbonation my add to this. Overall, ok, but I would drink again, but not buy again."
"Full in the mouth yet smooth with just enough carbonation to clear the palate. An excellent cold weather beer. This would be perfect for a dessert in front of the fire place."
