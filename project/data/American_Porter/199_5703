3.93,-0.8,4.25,4.25,3.75,4,3.75,"Dark tan froth atop a charcoal black brew.  Smells of dark chocolate, charred wood, currant and milk chocolate deep down.  Caramel sweetness up front backed by a slight toastiness, a hint of floral hops and nutty right down the middle.  The aftertaste lingers metallic.  Medium to heavy in body and smooth all the way.  A tasty ride albeit with an annoying bump or two in the road.","stephens101","Sunday at 03:54 PM"

3.61,-8.8,3.25,3.5,3.75,3.25,3.75,"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass.  I wasn't sure what to expect from this porter.  I have seen it described as a desert in a bottle and I guess that could be accurate but I think this beer can be used for many different occasions than just a desert beer.  I picked up some coffee, chocolate, and vanilla in the nose.  Taste was great!  Light chocolate and roasted coffee with a hint of vanilla.  It ended dry with roasted coffee.  Very delightful.  I do not like a hoppy beer and the hops were definitely there but it was very well balanced and the hops were welcome and blended very well.  I will seek this out again and set aside a bottle for a nice fall evening .","VTR","Mar 16, 2015"
3.99,0.8,3.75,4,4,4,4,"so glad these guys have their beer all over town finally, so many good ones to choose from, and it has been fun to drink through the available lineup. this is a great porter, a little more simple and straightforward than some of their other offerings, but of equal quality no doubt. maybe an oatmeal porter, as this has a lot of body and froth, and an almost creamy feel to it. there is some sweetness among the dark malt depth of this one, but its not a caramel malt thing, more of a chocolate going on. amazing it finishes as dry as it does, considering that middle sweetness. very little yeast profile to this one, which i suppose is part of what makes it an american style porter, but its almost like it needs more descriptors in the name, because its pretty interesting, american porter just doesnt seem to do it justice. a great after dinner beer, a great winter beer, a great morning beer, and a great beer on a hangover, versatile in its appeal, and dynamic in its flavor, although it is indeed less nuanced than some of their hoppy beers. this one doesnt have much hops, but they arent missing. it has a fresh baked character, warming, and really just a true example of the style. wonderful on tap, no bottles for me yet.","StonedTrippin","Mar 16, 2015"

Piney hops play off of chocolate and lightly roasted grains with a fairly deep, bitter finish where the roast and hop bitterness intermingles. Quite well done.","Georgiabeer","Feb 05, 2014"

Very smooth, easy to drink, but not in a slick, watery way, the taste itself being of roasted coffee, some caramel sweetness, touch of dark fruity hops, all blended well together for one great porter. Mixes sweet and roasted malts along with hops for fruit notes and crisp finish for balance; this is a well-assembled porter and very affordable compared to others.","clayrock81","Jan 16, 2013"

Foamy beige head holds good retention and leaves some spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas seem a little muted with hints of cola, toasted grain, molasses, chocolate and faint anise. Tastes are bolder with complex notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, anise, char, smoke, pine, burnt caramel, coffee, and cola. Medium bodied, smooth, and creamy, finishing somewhat bitter and dry. Overall, nice take on a west coast porter, perhaps. Nice balance between malts and hops with great complexity.","barnzy78","Jun 21, 2012"

Taste of chocolate, caramel, biscuit, roasted malt, nuttiness, slight coffee, citrus, and herbal hops. Light coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, nuttiness, biscuit, roasted malt, caramel, coffee, and herbal hops on the finish for a bit. Fairly robust flavor profile, with very nice balance of flavor. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and smooth mouthfeel.

The taste is also very roasty with coffee and malts, with a bit of vanilla. It's got a very full flavor though, setting it apart from the pack. Smooth at first and finishing prickly, thanks to the easy-drinking mouthfeel yet fairly aggressive roastiness on the finish. Overall, this is just a very well-done porter.

Flavors are smooth and robust, with a dark roasted coffee bitterness highlighted by some cocoa bittersweet.

A bit of coffee in the taste. Not much complexity. A decent amount of carbonation adds to the feel to go with the silk and cream of a good porter. A little on the dry side. Overall- A solid porter that is not spectacular but also not lacking anything. I was wanting a bit more sweet, malty flavor that just didn't come through.

About a finger of light brown head died fairly quickly, but persistent bubbles keep building from the middle of the glass. Not much lacing. Probably the wrong drinking vessel for the beer. Smell lots of dark chocolate, sweet dried red fruit, some Sherry like notes, nuts. A bit of maple syrup perhaps. Light on the mouth, good creaminess. Tastes of bitter chocolate, sweeter than a lot of porters, with more of that dried fruit and nuts flavor. Finished quite easily, with a medium length bitter finish.","WestValleyIPA","Oct 25, 2010"

It comes across as significantly less dry than most regular porters, distinguishing it as a beer with versatility in food pairings and as a good gateway selection for introducing new palates to the joys of dark ale.

3.85,-2.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Got it on tap, poured into a Standard Pint glass. Looks pretty good. Poured and close to a black color, extremely dark brown with dark amber highlights. There is a small tan colored head that goes away pretty quickly and there hardly any lacing to it, just a couple of random specks left on the glass. The aroma is pretty good. Smells of sweetroasted, toasted malts, coffee, and bittersweet chocolate. Slightly smokey with a very slight aroma of maybe dry hops. The taste is a little of a step up from the smell. Has similar features, but the hops stand out a bit more in the taste than the smell. The smokeyness is a little harder to distinguish in the flavor, but tastes and feels very well balanced overall. It's full bodied but the mouthfeel is very good, very smooth, a very drinkable porter.","AndyAvalanche","Nov 08, 2009"

The liquid is a deep dark brown with light cola coloring on the edges. The nose gives the first taste of charcoal smoke. Some hops also come through without overwhelming. It smells like a dry porter, if that makes sense. The flavor has some initial chocolate and caramel, but the wonderful charcoal flavor establishes itself quickly and knocks down the sweetness. There is a mildly bitter finish, possibly with citric hops but I can't quite taste them in such a roasty beer. The alcohol is used beautifully. It warms up the whole palate, like a good Imperial Stout or something. American Porter is a middle-of-the-pack style for my preferences, but I am really enjoying this Black Marlin. Maybe, it's just that porters often surprise because I don't expect to like them, or maybe I'm just better at avoiding bad examples.","popery","Jan 20, 2009"

3.98,0.5,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Black Marlin poured a beautiful dark chocolate black with some bright ruby red highlights along the side. The head of foam was tan in color and close to being 1/2 inch in height. This tan head of foam quickly dissipated into a handful of tan rings and one spot of tan lace around the glass. I thought the color of this beer was just great! The aroma was lightly sour with bitter dark chocolate, roasted malts, a pinch of roasted hops, and a dark fruit hiding in the background. The taste was also lightly sour, but it wasn't a beer gone bad sour. It was one of those good sour tastes. Anyway, the taste was lightly sour with bitter dark chocolate, dry and dark roasted malts, a splash of caramel, a pinch of roasted coffee, and some roasted hops at the finish. If any one of those flavors stood out, it would have to be the chocolate. The chocolate ruled this taste. The mouthfeel was medium to full bodied with a nice dark and lightly bitter aftertaste of dark chocolate, roasted malts, and a hint of roasted hops. As you can tell I enjoyed this Porter very much and wouldn't mind having another one of these. In the end, it's just a great roasted chocolately Porter.","AltBock","May 11, 2008"

Smokey caramel malt, charred oak, and sweet toffee up front in the nose. There's also a light floral hop aroma as well. A faint scent of alcohol can be detected in the smell too. Bitter french roast coffee ice cream flavor at first with a smoked wood flavor towards the end. Lemongrass and hops linger throughout on the tongue, very interesting. Dry birch aftertaste with a hint of cocoa and brown sugar. Nice medium body with a smooth texture. Pretty solid carbonation that tingles all the way down. Very enjoyable mouthfeel for a porter.

Also leaves plentiful fine lace. Great looking stuff. Nose is softly of mild chocolate and some dark malt. More chocolate notes, plentiful dark malt, and moderate hop bit comes in late.

Taste is similar, very fruity, caramel, chocolate roast, oats and bread in the middle, cola, light spiciness, weird chemical kind of flavour I can't place.

The taste focuses in more on the seemingly burnt grains, with a slight ash and charcoal taste.

Agreeable flavor with the nice chocolate/burnt malt/coffee thing going on. A nice little ying-yang deal of sweet vs bitter going on. On one side, you've got the sweet caramel malt back bone and some carmelized sugar traits. On the other hand are the intriguing bitter char notes and coffee bean. Overall a nice blend of flavors. The body of this beer hovers around medium and the carbonation is appropriately on the low side. Ballast Point in Minnesota?? I'll take it.","Bighuge","Jul 18, 2007"

Pungent, consisting mostly of bitter chocolate and citrus hops. Coffee too. It is exactly what I look for in a good porter. Taste is quite nice as well, with the exception of a mild booziness that becomes prominent as the beer warms. Other than that, this beer is just fine. Flavor includes tons of chocolate, hints of coffee, and perhaps just a pinch of vanilla. The roasted dark malt character is deep, pervasive, and unyielding in its intensity. Mouthfeel and texture are very nice. This is a full but not filling beer. It is slick, balanced, and light enough on the carbonation to give it some creaminess. Hopping is well done to create a dry, moderately bitter finish. Very nice. One of the best example of the style Ive had in some time.","DaPeculierDane","Apr 16, 2007"

Nothing bad or offensive, but merely an average porter, with below average carbonation, and a sticky sweet mouthfeel.

Good, definately not great.","rayjay","Jan 15, 2007"
