"Incredible beer. Unlike anything I've had."

"Maybe I went into this expecting too much.  The complex flavors that I was expecting just were not there.  Bascially a coffee porter.  I got a little maple but no bacon.   Mouthfeel was on the thin side."

"Tastes like decent, light coffee porter.  Not much maple, not any bacon, and just a hint of coffee over a very light bodied porter.  Not the flavor explosion I was expecting at all, but still pretty decent outside of what its advertised to be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Was excited to try this one at Extreme Beer Fest but honestly didn't find it to be that great. Decent porter but not one of my favorites."

"Very well excecuted, but McGriddles aren't really my thing."
""
"This beer I'd super unique. Breakfast in a bottle. Maple and pork... Yes, its there. Would've rated higher, though I prefer BA beers. A must try though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great stuff"
""
""
"6.4%? really? So easy to drink and so complex."
"One of the most unique beers I have had. A must try for enthusiasts."
""
""
""
"Great nose of bacon and campfire smoke. Great balance of taste between the coffee and maple. Really unique beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is one of the most enjoyable beers I've ever had. The flavors are unique for a beer in the sense that it tastes like I poured maple syrup in a cup of coffee and dipped my bacon in it. I wish these were more readily available, especially in my neck of the woods. I'm definitely going to savor every sip of this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very well made porter, interesting concept, I just wish it wasn't so hard to get! Lucky I have a fantastic trading partner from Florida who hooked me up!"

"This beer smells and tastes exactly like you would expect.  I did not care for it at all. It was thin and entirely too sweet. Too gimmicky for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I couldn't believe how accurately this nailed the tastes of a perfect breakfast. I was immediately transported to a diner with a stack of pancakes, some smoky bacon, and a cup of joe. I was impressed with how smoky the flavor was. Another super solid offering from FB."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a dark, totally opaque black and without head formation/retention. The nose is initially spicy coffee-forward, but the maple sweetness comes through much stronger as the beer warms. The taste carries forward distinct maple sweetness, bacon smokiness, and coffee bitterness, while maintaining the integrity of a solid porter base - a very unique and enjoyable experience. Despite the heavy handed flavor profile and nearly-still body, I'm impressed by this beer's drinkability. The mouthfeel is rich with flavor, but isn't quite as heavy as a stout and despite the adjuncts, there is still some roasted malt in the finish that reminds me this is a porter. Pleased to have tried this and would definitely recommend it to others"
""
""
"Just didn't enjoy the flavors here.  Oddly they are three of my favorite things in life but putting them into a beer was just not a good idea.  I was looking forward to this and was supremely disappointed.  I'm obviously in the minority here but just not my cup of tea I guess."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Way too roasty.  Didn't get enough flavor."
""
""
""
"An imperial version of this would be out of this world."
"O: kudos for managing to get maple, coffee and a hint of bacon into a porter."

"man, what a special brew, and the way i got to try ti was pretty special too. it came through a trade i suppose, but a generous giving by its original owner, who runs a little pizza shop in port saint lucie florida called tavola, which i must recommend as strongly as one can, some of the most delicious and innovative pie i have encountered, and i am a real pizza enthusiast. thanks rob, my new pal, for this beauty! the beer pours like you would expect it to, nice dark mocha brown head over a dense looking brew the color of a coffee bean. it smells incredible, the coffee is the most evident by a landslide, but the other elements are there, and the maple is wholly authentic, not like the fake stuff, this is the real deal. the bacon is weird, there is a meaty smokiness, but i cant place bacon right away from the nose, it opens up though as it sits. plenty of coffee on the first sip too, thats the flavor i taste first. there is a dark chocolate undertone to it, and a roasted barley depth and texture not common in beers under 7% abv, which i still cannot believe. so many dark and interesting beers these days are 10% abv and sit in a whiskey barrel until the original beer is not recognizable, not this one folks, this is pure genius, and so different for those reasons. the bacon comes on real distinct in the flavor right after the swallow in that second or two long zone of stillness before all the coffee and maple flavors come rushing back. its almost salty, and definitely smoked, but its not intrusive, it just tastes like a really good and complete breakfast. the maple is responsible for a very long finish, and it carries a sweet nutty roast from the grain with it, although its never too much. i tasted maple on my mustache the next morning, and it was just as good, so this one has some staying power. i suspect its better fresh than aged too, although i may never know. the coffee and maple seem so forward, you would hate to lose that. the bacon is never greasy but gets more and more distinct as i zero in on it, i just frankly cannot believe how different and good this is, and how generous rob was to share it with me. a complete treat, and maybe the liquid highlight of my vacation to florida. worth the hype and then some."

"Nice but...too much hype. Just very good. Lots of coffee. Bacon? Smokey porter flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall good but the hype set expectations a bit too high."
""
"Fresh makes a huge difference on the nose and the taste...Never letting one of these sit again :)"
""
""
"This is amazing. A brilliant brewing achievement from Funky Buddha."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Awesome beer, #44 get you some! Coldcuts!"
""
""
"The aroma is like entering a Starbucks. Coffee is strong with maple pronounced as well. Taste follows the nose and offers a salty finish which adds to the complexity and balance. Mouth feel is creamy and smooth as seems to be typical of all FB beers. Extremely drinkable. Saltiness increases as it warms along with a chocolate sweetness. Very unique and enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Pours dark brown with a thin mocha head. Aroma of sweet malt, chocolate, salty bacon, smokey coffee. The flavors pick up the same aromatic qualities. Medium mouthfeel and sticky maple throughout with that nice smokey and salty bacon in the back finish. Overall, a pretty interesting porter. May have to go against the tide on this one and say this isn't exactly a world-class beer, but a very good one nonetheless for a gimmicky porter style."

"2015 - Too much coffee, not enough bacon"
""
"O- Hype is well-deserved, excellent breakfast porter that absolutely smells and tastes like breakfast. It's different than Mornin' Delight in that the body is quite a bit lighter in this beer and the coffee tends to contribute more of a bitterness than actual flavour here, but the maple syrup is proportionally strong in this beer. The best comparison I can make is that this is a baby Good Morning, which is a compliment to both beers. Its hard to think of a brewery that does flavoured porters (and adjunct beers in general) better than Funky Buddha. Cheers!"

""
""
"Unique taste that lingers in the memory and makes you crave more.  Would love imperial version of this."
""
""
""
"Outstanding, obviously. Reminds me a bit of Cellarmaker's Coffee & Cigarettes, in its overall feel. One I'd definitely trade for again."

"A little weak on the mouthfeel and not enough bacon but overall an exceptional beer!"
""
""
""
"Edit: 3/27/2015 - Shared a bottle with friends - A few months later and this beer is still as good as fresh. Tons of Maple on the nose as soon as the bottle was opened. Still very smooth and silky with plenty of coffee, maple and meaty roast."
"Lives up to the hype for sure!!! A near perfect beer...glad it's a porter because the lighter body and mouthfeel makes it easy to enjoy all these flavors in quantity...such a fun beer"

"Huge coffee aroma. Big time maple taste. This is big time."
"Bottle from trade. HUGE thanks for a long time want. Pours pretty much black with a creamy one finger khaki brown head. Beautiful aroma of smoke, chocolate, big maple syrup, coffee. Whoah. Flavor is big time maple syrup,big smokey bacon, coffee, light cocoa notes, roasty malts. Yep. It's all there. Medium bodied, creamy but not imperial stout heavy. Very easy drinking and really nice dessert. This lives up to the hype. Stoked to try the imperial version at Huna day."
""
""
""
""
"Super solid. Ages well. Lovely aroma and delicious to boot. Pair well with mini eclairs."
""
"I've had this beer many times living so close to the original FB Lounge.  As stated in an earlier review, sometimes this beer can be a little off but when it's on it's amazing!  The MBCP served at the release party at the brewery on 1/10/15 was the best I've had.  The coffee, maple and hint of smoke blended perfectly with just the right amount of hop bite for balance.  I went back to the brewery the next night and it was as good as I remembered."
""
""
""
"Ebony body with brown edges is capped by a khaki head. Espresso coffee, Vermont maple syrup, smoke & roasted malt nose and flavors. Creamy smooth mouthfeel with sweetness in abundance. Breakfast in a bottle. Amazing."
"Great beer.  Doesn't hold a candle to the imperial version."
""
""
""
"enjoyed this on tap at MBCP 2014.  It is breakfast in a glass.  Not too heavy and that's fine by me.  Not as much ""bacon"" as one would hope but I can't wait to open another bottle."

""
""

""

"This beer is perfect. Amazing and groundbreaking to marry all these flavors together so perfectly. So good it'll leave your hand sticky like you're eating pancakes. The bacon flavor is the real deal. Perfectly subtle. Love! Exceptional beer. Namaste Funky Buddha!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow, this was about a year old when drank and the group agreed it was the best of the night.  Great flavors prominently throughout with a solid stout base.  The nose and the taste do not match up though."
""
"I've had this beer many times. Sometimes it's much better than others, but when the nail it, it's one of the best beers I've ever had the pleasure to drink!"

"Every time I get to try this, I'm blown away by how much maple is in the nose. Obviously the coffee is there, but even on the label the word ""maple"" is smaller than coffee and bacon. I feel like maple should be proudly etched into the glass for how much is in it. It's seriously good."

"OVERALL: Good beer and all the adjuncts are there in measured amounts. It's rather well balanced, though the flavor is a touch empty at the beginning and the base porter doesn't really seem to be important in this beer. It's mostly an adjunct show. Still, it was tasty and everyone quite enjoyed it. Would be very interested in trying this from the bottle. Thanks again Doodler! This was a fun treat."
""
"A nice porter with some good components, but not quite up to Lost Snow standards."
""
""

"O - I'm impressed. How'd they get all those flavors in there. Very layered and tasty."

"Lots to say but it just all works out into an experience of liquid breakfast, and a good one at that. I swear I'm getting ghost sausage grease notes because I feel like I'm at a breakfast joint. Lives up to its name."
""
""
"Overall - Really crazy stuff, this is savory maple breakfast madness. Rich enough so a small pour would probably suffice, but so tasty I can't help but quaff. Kinda simple and sweet but I think it'd be hard not to dig this one. Next time I have this, I'd like it with a side of French Toast Double Brown, please."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A great candy beer that I am in first glass of. Thank God I have other styles to mix in tonight to help me crush this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown, which a thick tan head and great retention. The aroma is simply stunning! They totally nailed it. Fresh cooked breakfast, bacon fat, smoke, fresh brewed coffee, maple soaked pancakes and a bit of milk chocolate. Flavor is less intense but still good. Strong on the bacon, good robust coffee and ends in a sweet maple note. Very low carbonation. Even texture has that greasy feel mixed with warm sweet coffee and the feel of sticky syrup. This is breakfast in a glass and i loved it."
""
""
""
"O: Highly drinkable and a great novelty. I can only imagine the food pairings for this, assuming I had extra bottles to piss away. The aroma is amazing, though the taste doesn’t *quite* live up to it. And I’m not getting any bacon from this. Maybe it’s already faded?"

"Pours clear brown with a light, tan cream head. Rich coffee in the nose. Medium to big sweet flavor, lots of rich and roasty malts, coffee, hints of maple syrup and smoked meat. Medium bodied with fine carbonation. Sweet finish, lots of dark malts, light smoke. Delicious stuff."

"Drink- A highly anticipated beer for me and I am glad I was finally able to tick this one. I wonder how the bottle holds up vs. growler, but I wont trade for one."

"Overall: This is my first Funky Buddha beer and I gotta say that they nailed that authentic maple syrup aroma and flavor. Toppling Goliath is the only other brewery that can captured that maple syrup flavor and aroma in a beer. Great balance in reguards to the flavor profile and aroma from this beer; everything is well integrated. Funky Buddha has some great finesse that is showcased with this beer. This beer has bigger maple flavor than CBS, but it does not quite make it to the level of Toppling Goliath's Mornin Delight and Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout. So this is my 3rd favorite beer that is brewed with maple syrup as a brewing adjunct. Fantastic job Funky Buddha; I will be seeking out more of this beer. No doubt about it."

"O - I thought this was great and so happy to have finally had the chance to get this. Eagerly looking forward to a couple of more bottles that will be in transit soon and hope that this becomes a regular bottle offering. I had high expectations and they were certainly met and more. This Buddha fan is happy!"
""
"overall an impressively complex beer with a great feel. very recommended!"

"D/O- Very good, a step below world class in my opinion. Nicely balanced with all that goes I to it. Would have loved more smokiness. Wonder about an imperial version would taste like? Glad to try. Thanks a ton for the share egrace84!"

"Pours a clear dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, maple, bacon, smoke, and coffee aromas. Taste is much the same with maple, coffee, and smoke flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a phenomenal smell and tasty flavors that are exactly what the name implies."
""
"I had this beer at the tap room in Oakland Park, FL. It is hard to come by. They only release it on special occasions. A lot of people were waiting for the keg to be tapped. There was even a count down. It has a great nose. The second it started pouring the smell of maple filled the tap room. It was very pleasant. The taste is really good too. A very bold maple taste the leads into a nice coffee taste and is finished with a smokey flavor. There is not too much bacon flavor for those people who are put off by that aspect. The looks are nothing special. Not too much of a head, but overall it is a really great beer."
"O: A very good beer. I am glad that I actively pursued this one for about 8 months. Well worth it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a super tasty treat...another winner from Funky Buddha in my book. Amazing aroma and a flavor that is intense and full of complexity and nuances. Best utilization of maple in a beer that I can remember having. This is truly outstanding. Funky Buddha hasn't let me down let. Wish I had a way of getting more their beers easily."

"O- For a coffee porter MBCP is fantastic and easily one of the best beers out there. For a gimmicky beer the bacon doesn't come out as much as I'd hope for but the coffee and maple syrup make the perfect breakfast beer. I've had this beer in years past and I feel like I've detected bacon more before but this bottling is still fantastic and worth trying, just make sure you drink it fresh!"
"O- I drove through a hailstorm just to get the chance to try this and I'm so glad I did. Worth the money, the hype and the trouble."
""
""
""
""
"Overall great beer. very tasty, although probably couldn't drink more than a glass full."
"O - Overall this beer is every bit as deserving of the hype and delivers what it promises. I would like more bacon/smoke notes but I'll forgive it for being so maple heavy. Just delicious and honored to have tried this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Another beer from the Buddha where all the adjuncts are in perfect balance. They must pour maple syrup right into the keg to get that kind of flavor out of it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had this on tap at Fermentation lounge. The guys from Funky Buddha brought up a keg and gave out samples one night. One of the best porters i have ever had. I must of had 4 samples of this beer...very drinkable. Pours a very dark brown almost black. The smell is divine with huge notes of maple and coffee. The initial taste starts off with heavy maple and coffee giving way to a smokey taste at the very end. I wish they would distribute their beers throughout most of Florida. I am a big fan."
""
"Gotta love a label that's pretty much just a piece of scotch tape with magic marker... Anyway, this stuff pours a brackish black-brown topped by a half-finger of off-tan foam. The nose comprises rich cocoa, caramel, maple syrup, molasses, and Reese's peanut butter cups. Everything is richer than the thickest fudge I've ever had. Da-amn. The taste pretty much brings in more of the same, producing a veritable liquid version of a hot fudge sundae smothered in rich caramel sauce, with a tall coffee to drink and a side of maple-smoked bacon. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a fantastic beer, one I wish I could encapsulate in a candle or a spray or a spread or something, any way to keep it around as long as possible."
"Appearance is dark brown with a bit of light passage around the edges. The nose smells like breakfast. Maple comes through the strongest with coffee and chocolate following things up. Not getting much bacon character on the nose. The taste on the other hand features some smokey bacon quality along with plenty of maple sweetness and a nice amount of coffee which balances out the sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium with light carbonation. Overall, delicious and perhaps one of the most unique beers I have had the pleasure of trying."
"O: Another very nice beer. As I'm sure many others have noted, this is like breakfast in a bottle, not that I've ever stirred my coffee with a piece of bacon, but you get the point."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The maple syrup really stands out here. It is extremely prevalent in every aspect, and never to a point of being overbearing. The underlying complexities work well with the sweetness of the syrup to provide a well-rounded brew that I will seek out again."
""
""
"O: excellent beer. Would love to have this for a morning tailgate. On tap at Monk's for $5.50 a glass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tap at Churchkey. Unfortunately, this beer's debut at CK was a disaster. This smelled like green coffee and mega DMS. Body was super thin. Undrinkable. Will not rate."
""
""
""
"O - On the way back from the bathroom I noticed that the entire bar smelled like maple syrup...pretty sure that isn't a coincidence. Other than possibly HF Ann this is the best beer I had during PBW this year. Amazing stuff."
""
"Overall a very good beer, though I wouldn't say it's worth killing yourself to trade for. I was fortunate to have it at the church key event for sure though."
""
"O: Another longtime want ticked. God damn was I stoked to get in on this one. I'll honestly say that no, it didn't live up to the insane hype that tends to surround a beer like this. But the more I drank (and I had what...three big glasses?), the more I really began seeing what this mash-up of a beer is all about. You like breakfast? You like beer? Then look no further, as this is really one of the more unique yet quaffable gimmick beers around."
""
"Overall, I thought it was a great tasting and wonderfully unique beer. It was an awesome breakfast in a glass. Everything comes together perfectly in it and I loved the smoke and maple flavors. Wish I could drink this every morning."
"Overall: This is one of the smoothest coffee beers I have ever had. The nuttiness from the coffee and the malt was very nice as well. I didn't feel like the bacon added much. I would love to have another."
"o - Overall, a fantastic beer. I actually like it better than the imperial version due to it having less smoke, and would put it up their with their Morning Wood. The nose is perfect to me; a perfect balance of sweet maple, coffee, and light smoke. Something I could definitely have a few glasses of, and one of the best maple beers out there. Would love to have it again."
""
""
""
"D- A glass of this is fine, no need for more, like said a sipper or if you want to take it down quicker, the body wont prevent that. One of the better beers I've had all week."
""
"Beer pours black with a medium tan head. The smell on this beer is incredible - it really smells like breakfast as the coffee and maple are both very present and combine in an amazing way. Flavor is also top notch - the coffee really comes through on the front end, and it melds into a fantastic authentic maple syrup finish. The beer does an excellent job of not being too sweet while incorporating a number of different flavors. My only complaint was that I didn't get much of the bacon here. Mouthfeel is the only real knock on this beer, as it was noticeably thinner than a beer like this should be. It took away slightly from the experience, but not so bad. Overall, this is a top-notch, unique beer that absolutely lived up to the hype. It's got probably the best maple flavor I've ever had in a beer and works incredibly well."
"Had on-tap at Woody's in Philadelphia, PA. Poured a very dark brown color, almost black with a thin head that receded almost immediately leaving the beer looking somewhat reminiscent of a black coffee. Minimal lacing. Had an aroma of coffee/roasty malts, maple and faint smoke. The coffee aroma was definitely more overpowering than the more subtle smoke/maple. The taste was that of black coffee, maple syrup and slight/faint smoke. As the beer warmed, the smoke and maple came out significantly more to create a more balanced ""breakfast in a glass."" Medium in body with low/no carbonation. Appropriate for a porter, though the flavors would have been even more enjoyable with a thicker mouthfeel. Overall, a great ""concept beer"" that was done very well. I would have preferred the maple and smoke to be a bit stronger to match the coffee flavor and balance out the beer a bit but I still enjoyed it as it was. I still think the Last Snow is a better porter, though seemingly not as well known. When you are drinking this beer, make sure you let it come up in temperature as that is when it really shines."
"Huge thanks to the awesome bartender at Hulmeville and Funky Buddha for making this happen."
"Overall this is a stellar beer. I dont think I could drink more then 2 because of the maple but totally worth trying. I've never had a maple beer that actually tasted like maple. I highly recommend this beer. Cheers!!!"
"Thanks go out to Ryan and FB for bringing your great beer to Philly, and also to Bella Vista, Monk's, Capone's, Woody's, Prohibition, Devil's Den, Hulmeville, and any other provider I may have missed."

"Reviewed from notes."
"Pours a dark brown with a dense khaki head. Huge aromas of maple syrup with a nice dose of smokey bacon. Not getting a ton of the coffee in the nose, but I'm loving the maple and bacon. Lots more coffee is apparent in the taste, melding beautifully with the maple and smokey bacon. Smooth and creamy, with a medium body and good carbonation. Just a ridiculous beer that gilds the lily perfectly. I want more!"

"Overall this beer was a unique experience. Lots of coffee, would've liked to have had more bacon and maple. Seems like the maple is hard to bring out in the taste for many beers and this beer is no exception. Would recommend, fun beer, would like to try again. Great beer to share, not a lot of alcohol, wouldn't mind a bit more."
"Overall: This is a great beer; the only thing that could really make it better would be a little bit more carbonation and a bigger body. I am definitely excited to see what the imperial version has to offer."
"Fantastic beer. Funky Buddha continues to impress. I wish it was easier to come by."
"Just don't sell an of the sensory organs required to experience this liquid Nirvana."
"Pours an extremely dark brown, almost black color with a small white head. In the nose, I immediately get bacon and maple syrup which instantly transition into fresh brewed coffee. Fresh coffee grounds and maple syrup make this one inviting porter. Taste is initially a heavy maple profile, quickly followed by delicious coffee. Best coffee flavors I've ever received from a beer. Lovely complex blend of coffee and maple syrup. Breakfast made perfect. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with smooth finish. Drinkability is very high. Overall, I know this is a bold statement (no pun intended)... But best coffee beer I've ever had."
"Overall: Wow. This beer totally delivers. Coffee Maple Bacon(Saltiness) all present. Probably the best coffee beer I've ever had."
"O: Was not expecting it to live up to last time, but this is in no way what I wanted. At first I tried to pretend that time had not treated this beer weel, after awhile though it became apparent that it had been infected. Too bad, was such a great beer the way it was meant to be..."
"Breakfast all day long!!! The aroma is smoky and sweet, not too much coffee. The coffee is more in the taste and combined with the maple, you can’t stop drinking it. The body is syrupy and very dark. Make this beer, one of your last beer of the night. This taste will linger for a long time, which is great for people who love breakfast."
"Overall: This is awesome. Breakfast in a glass. I didn't expect this to be as good as it sounds, but it is. The maple is really powerful in both the aroma and the flavor but it lacks the sweetness one might expect. Highly recommended."
"Overall a really great beer with more maple flavor than I've ever had in a beer."
"One thing is for sure - this is a very unique & delicious beer. Is it worth all the hype & praise? In my opinion, no. But that is just my opinion. All in all, its a great American Porter & pushes the boundaries for what a ""beer"" can bring to the table. Hats off to the Funky Buddha for helping to open pandoras box in the brewing world."
"Tried a snifter of this at the Funky Buddha. Was poured a very full glass with almost no head (not complaining about a big pour). Spilled a little on my fingers, which smelled like maple for the next 4 days. Kind of weird. Heavy maple aroma and flavor with roasted coffee up front transitioning to very heavy coffee flavor on the back end. Did not sense anything from the bacon. Light but pleasant mouth feel - helped to balance the distinct flavors. Very drinkable, but you better like the flavors."
" I have had this in growler form before the hype train. Both times this was an exceptional beer."
"O - My initial hopes before even trying this beer was for a pronounced bacon / smokiness profile, but it really wasn't there the way I had imagined. All in all, this is still one very tasty Porter and one that I will actively seek out any chance I get."
"On tap at the Jupiter Beerfest. A big tip of the cap to Ryan and Kevin. This was the biggest draw at the event. In fact the mob was actually chanting maple!! bacon!! Mohago pour with very little head. Outrageous maple nose. A little thin in the body, but the taste is fantastic with maple syrup, caramel malt, sweet coffee, and vanilla dominating the palate..."
"I really enjoyed this unique brew as did my friends. I'm sad to look at the now empty bottle and hope to land another some day. Definitely recommend it."
"Overall I really enjoyed this one. Only request would be a little more heat. Maybe raise the abv to 8%. This one was hard to get a hold of, but I'm hoping another opportunity pops up"
"Oily mouthfeel, if anything this only adds to the amazingness that is this beer. It coats and sticks to your tongue, keeping those rich flavors for along aftertaste. Not sure what other praise I can heap on this, an extremely good and flavorful beer that you can drink for a long time given the relatively low ABV. Awesome."
"The mouthfeel wasn't as strong as the flavor and smell, but still was pleasant. The beer is a touch thin and sticky but nice carb keeps things moving along. The viscosity is OK for a porter but a breakfast beer could use some heft. Overall, I liked this beer a lot but didn't think it was deserving of the insane hype. Unique for sure, but nothing like the experience of my first Founders Breakfast Stout."
"O - Very good, rare experience. I know of a few other companies who are doing the same sort of thing, and this one is probably the best I've had. The maple syrup thing is very exciting, just hope they can bring up the ABV a bit to give it more of a bite."
"D: I hate when i give into hype, but i loved this beer and would relish the opportunity to try it again"
"Nice head, some decent lace and a big aroma of maple, coffee and light smoke. Looks and feels a little thinner than expected, but the taste is phenomenal. Big big maple, nice coffee and a little smoky bacon and all smooth and balanced. This is just crazy fun stuff. Killer stuff."
"Poured a dark brown with little head that dissapated quickly. Slight lacing most likely from the maple. What impressed me the most about this beer was the incredible nose of maple and coffee. Slight smokiness to it. Similar to the smell coffee, maple and bacon on the back palate. Moderate carbonation and very easy to get down. Would love to try this again and it is a great porter."
"Sweet and thick on the tongue. I wish it was a hair thicker but overall one of the best beers I've ever had"
"O-great beer. Hard to top today even with everything we are opening"
"Had this treat on a spring break and loved it. Beautiful dark head with lasting lacing came paired with an incredible aroma, almost like walking into IHOP. Taste was strong with very mild bitterness however beer was severely undercarbonated to the point of being flat."
"overall i really do not know what else i can say, this was quite simply one of the best beers i have ever had. absolutely amazing in every way."
"Massive thanks goes out to my boy mikesgroove for sharing this one with me during Hobo Tasting #8 sitting in the car at Lowe's before buying a grill (hobos gotta eat too). Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured pitch black with a half finger slightly tan off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate, and maple syrup. The flavor was of sweet malt, maple syrup, coffee, caramel, dark chocolate, and a very subtle smokey note. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this brew was just plain excellent. The flavor on this thing was crazy good. Maple syrup was the star of the show, but definitely not overpoweringly sweet as you would expect allowing some more of the sublte flavors to come through. The aroma just gives you a small hint at what is about to explode on your palate. Really glad I finally got a chance to try this brew and would love to do so again! Also, how can a beer with a bottle label that awesome be bad!? Excellent job Funky Buddha!"
"Thanks again Ryan and great work!"
"Overall I'm grateful for the opportunity to try this brew, it pushes the boundaries of what's possible with porters and brewing in general. Great job, and I will seek this out again, and hope to try the imperial version as well."
"D- OVerall this is an outstanding porter, not too watered down like some and not too coffee flavored like others. And the savory saltness is something ive never tasted in a beer. The only complaint i have is i wish the bacon flavor was alittle more present, But overall this was an outstanding porter ad glad i was able to trade for it. IM proud thatthis beer could be my 100th Review. Please try and get this beer, u wont be dissapointed"
"Overall – WOW. What an amazing beer. This is probably the best beer I have had this year, and it possesses a nose like no other. I need to get this again!"
"Did not pick up roast and malt character from the grains just over-powering coffee. It tasted like drinking a cold flat cup of coffee with a hint maple syrup. The beer is a sipper, taking over an hour to get through the glass. I would not consider this beer a porter due to the lack of drinkability."
"Pours black as night with very little head, i usually just sit there for the first 5 minutes and take in the smell. Can't wait for the imperial version!!!"
"Overall: A great success I would say, excellent beer. Only criticism is the carbonation and maybe a hint too much coffee for my taste (I think this hurts the overall complexity a bit, maple flavors for instance)."
"Best Porter I've ever had. Would love to have a hint of oak in there as well."
"Brown in color with little to no head or lacing. Smells of sweet, sweet maple. Lots of coffee also. Absolutely delicious. Tastes identical to smell. Tons of coffee and sweet maple. Medium to thin bodied. Very little carbonation. Overall fantastic. This is liquid crack in a cup."
"The bacon in the name is certainly for hype, but this beer makes up for it by actually being a really great beer. Glad I got to try this before the insane hype started to kick in."
"D - Had one sample and that was enough. I wish it was a bit more thick and had a touch of carbonation. Otherwise, a very cool beer that I'd try again if given the chance."
"D: I've seen others say it was highly drinkable, so I guess to each his own. I thought it was best at half a glass, splitting with someone else. The taste is too overpowering beyond that. Good sipper though. Would be a fabulous breakfast beer if it ever got bottled."
"D and overall impression: I could drink this stuff all day long, it's not just for breakfast. Overall, this is a hit. Original and well crafted. It really is breakfast in a glass. Get it if you can. Skal."
"The mouthfeel is perfect, it's actually a bit lighter and thinner than the name would let on, which is a very good thing. If this had a full and thick mouthfeel, I think the maple syrup would be way too cloying, the mouthfeel accents all the right parts of the brew as-is. The drinkability is superb, especially considering the full flavor of the brew. An awesome porter, very unique and absolutely worth seeking out."
"Overall, I was pretty impressed with this one. It doesn't quite live up to the extremely high scores it's received so far but it's pretty damn good. Even somefolks who hate coffee beers were really into it."
"While this one didn't quite live up to the hype, I still found it very impressive how they were able to pull all of these unique flavors off into a very interesting yet still approachable drinkable package. That's 2 for 2 so far on these Funky Buddha beers for me. I will continue to seek more of these out."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Very drinkable with quite a lot of flavoring to take in and enjoy. This beer, while a pleasure to drink and something I would certainly seek out again, was a wild ride. Take away the visual and I never really felt like I was drinking a porter. In so many ways this brew reminds me of the conglomeration of different beer styles that makes up Bullfrog's Gothika. It's a crazy hybrid of rauchbier/smoked beer mixed with a porter and supplemented with coffee and molasses. In every way this brew screams morning/breakfast treat."
"D: Man oh man, This is one of the most impressive beers I've had in a while. The folks at The Funky Buddha are just killing with the stuff they're putting out. Simply excellent!"
"O: This is the best porter I've ever had. I'd have more to say, but I'll let this beer talk for itself. Seek it out !!"
"D: This beer is definitely worthy of all the attention it's getting. If possible, I would absolutely trade for a growler of my own. Delicious"
"This is one amazing beer for sure! Glad i was able to try it."
"Beer is medium in body and so creamy, as the beer warms the maple becomes more obvious. The maple is mostly in the back / aftertaste as the beer finishes mildly dry. The coffee and some sweetness is the most obvious flavors in the entire palate. I really liked this beer overall. A very good beer."
"Pours a very dark brown with a nice tan head and a bit of spotty lacing. Thin collar as it goes down. Nose is quite incredible with large doses of vanilla, smoke, and coffee off the front end. As it warms up, the maple really starts to come out. Very, very nice. The flavor hits the same high notes with a good dosing of roast and coffee plus some maple. Not as much smokiness here. Mouthfeel is medium with a dry finish and moderate carbonation. Incredibly drinkable and we certainly had no problem finishing off this 32-ounce growler. Thanks again to Phil for the awesome hookup on this one."
"Although I would have liked more smokiness from a beer labeled ""bacon"" this still was tastier than I expected. I can't wait to try other offerings from Funky Buddha."
"This very intriguing brew appears a dark brown shade, with crimson highlights apparent when held to the light. The head is about a quarter inch thick, and settles down to a thin layer atop the beer. The smell is just awesome. Wow! Scents of maple, vanilla, smoke, chocolate and a robust coffee presence make for a world class aroma. The taste does not disappoint, though it doesn't quite live up to the promises of the fabulous aroma. Fresh coffee and maple syrup are blended to perfection, with some chocolate and vanilla notes coming in behind. I actually thought this beer was higher in alcohol. Highly drinkable - I could sip this all night. In fact, that's what I did."
"D-I would love this beer all day everday. Its small enough to have several of them, but has enough flavor to be able to enjoy several of them. Not much bacon, but a great beer from South Florida, breaking the shell of a beer wasteland. BOOM"
"Thanks, Funky Buddha!"
"This was the best beer at the festival, it was the most drinkable out of all the big stouts which were being poured (Hunahpu, Big Bear's Imperial Stout, Swamp Heads Midnight Oil Treatment, and several other stouts/porters). Just a fantastic beer!"
"The smell of this beer is... wow. It reminds me of breakfast. coffee and maple eminate so wonderfully from this beer. I didn't pick out the bacon so much but it didn't even matter, it was that good. For a brewery that has only been open since November; they certainly can brew an amazing beer. I loved that it had so much flavor but as soon as it was gone; it was gone. I had an IPA right after it and there was no lingering taste at all. drinkability was good, it was definitly a full-bodied beer with a ton of distinct flavors, one was enough for me as it was on the heavier side. but it was a great one!"
"D: drink it all night. nuff said."
"D - A truly fantastic beer, best maple beer I have had to date. Would highly recommend and drink every chance I get. For their next trick, I hope they add some subtle smoke to it, to make it match the name."
"This is a very solid beer, but everything I got from it was very nice coffee porter with a little bit of smoke. While smelling and sipping, hoping to get some bacon, I might have caught a little whiff but never in the flavor. And I completely forgot about maple. I didn't catch maple at all...at all."
"D - This was quite good, although the richness of flavor would make it hard to drink a ton. Still, I'm impressed - great coffee and maple flavors that are well-attenuated. Would love to have this one again."
"32oz Florida growler poured into Matilda glass, thanks again karl! Pours black with brown edges and a creamy tan/white head with very nice retention. Smell is sweet maple right off the bat, lots of coffee, a nice smokey, fatty bacon, followed by a porter malt character. Taste is lots of strong flavors that somehow dont overpower each other. Maple and coffee up front, finishes with a good strong porter malt base beer, very nice. Some roasted and chocolate malt but not a lot of hops. I expected there to be more of a smokey malt flavor, but the ""bacon"" is subtle, which is probably for the best. Too much bacon would ruin the beer. A bitter coffee finish with a maple aftertaste. Medium bodied with a fine light bubbly carbonation and creamy mouthfeel. I thought this beer was going to be gimmicky but it is actually an excellent beer. Very balanced and just as described, my only thought is that this beer could use a bit more smoke to add to the complexity. I look forward to trying more funky buddha beers."
"This is really good, and close to being world class. The name throws me the most and without the bacon reference I would have probably rated higher as going in I was expecting more smoke or some salty pork so I feel a little let down, if that's possible. I would certainly drink this again and recommend it highly. Just forget the name going in."
"This is in the 94th percentile of beers I've tried to date. One of the few I would gladly drink again."
"Drinkability is great! Funky Buddha has managed to pack a lot of flavor into a 6% beer. This is dangerously sessionable. Abuliarose and I will have no problem finishing off the 32 oz growler in front of us. I really wish these guys were closer to New Hampshire. I'll definitely be seeking out more of their beer in the future. Highly recommended. An exceptional American Porter."
"Overall I am quite impressed. It sounded like one of those beers that puts a bunch of stuff in but falls apart in the process. It's actually really, really well done. Wish I had more."
"Much thanks to Electrobunny for the trade and Funky Buddha for making this outstanding brew!"
"D- Really happy I got to try this when it debuted. Highly drinkable and true to its name. I think if it had just a little more body it would be lights out. Can't wait to have this again."
"This is a blessing from the beer gods. This one has so much aroma and flavor it's crazy. The name says it all. You get the coffee in the aroma, the maple in the flavor with a little bit of bacon, all topped off with a great malt balance. Only available on draft so if your in the area I suggest you pick it up now."
"Overall very interesting and enjoyable. It should be tried if you get the opportunity."
"An unexpected treat from jedwards. Pours the color and clarity of cola with some ruby red highlights around the edges and no head. Big coffee grounds character in the nose, with a hint of chocolate that gives it just a kiss of a mocha character. Taste reveals dark malts and a big maple syrup character, some earthiness and quite a bit of chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, with a pleasant, even carbonation. This is an outstanding American Porter. Incredibly flavorful and oh so drinkable. I must have more."
"I'm not usually huge on multiple-flavor products, but this is a gem. Already planning on asking for more..."
"Very good breakfast in a cup!"
"If you are in the area jump on this soon, as from what I understand there is about 10 gallons total. Depending on the response they will brew it again. I have my fingers crossed that they do brew it again!"
