Tastes is dark chocolate and coffee with a toned down roasted nut character and slight smokiness on the back end. Overall, everything I want in a porter...which is also the same stuff I expect in a good stout.","Stinger80OH","Mar 29, 2015"

The taste was much more balanced than I was expecting with those toasted and nutty flavors but also a good amount of hops and bright flavors to make this an enjoyable beer year round.

4.5,8.7,4.25,4.25,4.75,4.25,4.5,"What a porter should be. Not a stout, but with a big enough and rich enough body to be something beyond amber or brown. Jet black with a light head it is less viscous as the color would lead you to believe. The aroma is dried fruit and chocolate but, again, not as deep as what would be expected from a darker roast. The flavors are similar. Where you'd might expect something that was boozy and bittersweet, this beer is a scaled back version. Rich, creamy, the roasted malt comes out middle to finish with a bit of acidity in the end. Medium heavy body and lively carbonation.","LittleDon","Dec 23, 2014"

This one pours a dark black-brown topped by a finger of burnt sienna foam.  The nose comprises dark cocoa powder, roasted malts, mild treacle, light coffee, something that seems like brown sugar, and a bit of chocolate-covered orange peel.  The taste brings in more of the same, though everything has an extra layer of toast, and there's a firm undercurrent of dank greens, tobacco, and candied orange peel.  It's these additions that really ruin things for me, undermining and subverting the positivity of everything that came before it.  I'm claiming over-hopping on this one.  The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish.  Overall, a good porter that appears to suffer from a misguided zeal to overhop things.  Shame, really, even if it doesn't completely destroy things.","TMoney2591","Aug 26, 2014"

4.15,0.2,,,,,,"Bottle poured into an English pub glass. An absolutely pitch black brew, maybe just a touch of muddy brown, with a decidedly impressive four fingers of mocha colored creamy head. Aroma is dark and roasted, black coffee, bittersweet chocolate, burnt almonds, and a little campfire ash with a subtle sweet top note. Palate largely mirrors this. This is a deep, dark, roasted porter with a sneaky citrus hop flavor lurking in the background and a whole heap of dark chocolate almond, coffee, and singed grain flavors out front. Quite smooth and creamy, although the resinous spicy notes will pop a little. Getting some ash, toasted nut, and strong tea in the dry finish. Overall impression is dry, roasted, minimal sweetness ... Perhaps just enough brown sugar to provide some balance and complexity. The roastiest of the Maine Beers I've sampled to date (which is most of them) and certainly a top tier porter, although my own preference swings toward the slightly sweeter "brown porter" style as opposed to the "robust" take.","CalgaryFMC","Aug 26, 2014"

This is tasty and also walks the thin line of being an Imperial Porter. Don’t get me wrong about the hops. It doesn’t lack them either. Like a fine Belgian beer, the hops aren’t in for flavoring. They are used for the dryness of the flavor and bitterness to cut the sweetness ( which does a fine job at that). This beer is rock solid. I wish I had another bottle that is how much I enjoyed this beer. This is Recommended.","Shroud0fdoom","Aug 25, 2014"

The biggest difference between King Titus and Everett is when the beer warms up; Everett remains malty and roasty. While King Titus showcases a mild hoppy bitterness that balances nicely with the chocolate and roast malts. Everett edges out King Titus overall, but King titus is alot easier to aquire. So its a draw and you can go wrong with either Porter in my opinion. I have had many hoppy offerings from MBC and really enjoyed alot of them, but this is definately my favorite beer from MBC!

The liquid is a fully opaque dark brown to black, barest hint of orange at the glass bottom, looks as much a stout as anything. The nose is dry and very roasty, malty with powerful presence in the dark chocolate, coffee bean, coconut flakes department all the while staying nicely balanced, adds complexity via white grapefruit zest, roasted nuts, tar, charcoal and campfire smoke, as pleasing for not pushing the envelope too far as for what it does offer. Light to medium-bodied, smooth but has grip and traction and in no way evanescent nor wimpy. More milk to lactose, vanilla bean here to pair with the chocolate and coffee, restrained sweetness. That curious grapefruit bursts through here too, retronasally floral, makes you think there’s some sneaky hops lurking about. Not as earthy here, some of that coal tar stuff but that’s it. Carbonation level is active, yet lets the primary flavors soak in and lengthen. Clean finish. The paucity of fruit flavors is odd, minor cherry to dark berry at best. Extremely well done.","farrago","Apr 24, 2014"

Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, dark bread, coffee, oats, light citrus, light pine, floral, grass, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity of dark/roasted malt and moderate hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, dark bread, coffee, oats, light citrus, light pine, floral, grass, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roast/floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, dark bread, coffee, light pine, floral, grass, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malts and moderate hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, moderately slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent porter. All around great balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt and moderate hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on.

That being said, this is one of the few porters I have found that straddle the line and do it so well. It is a dark brown to black color, really depending on the light and your eyes, with one finger head that dies slow with lace patches on glass. The aroma is basically a dry, roasted malt aroma but there is a nice chunk of dark chocolate kicking around. The beer is medium bodied, no easy sipper but not necessarily chewey or bready, per se, and I find that dark chocolate is really pronounced with the roasted malts for this balance of sweet and dry, and at a couple of points I believe I pinpointed some dark fruits like raisins and a touch of alcohol in the finish, which to be honest I don't really get any hoppy bitterness in this beer except on the backend as my beer warmed up (I am a slow sipper).","clayrock81","Jan 30, 2014"

Syrupy coating on the sides. Smell is roasty and delicious Healthy amounts of grain and dark chocolate. Huge portion of coffee. A dark fruitiness yields currants and dates. Taste us superb. When cold it is quite good but as it warms the balance really starts to shine. Dark roasted grains in the front with a steaming java cup cradling it. Mild dark bread with a molasses sweetness. Bitter chocolate in the hoppy finish. Nice chewy feel with a surprisingly crisp carbonation and slightly sticky presence on the lips. A touch of creaminess at time. While chewy it is lighter in the mouth than you would surmise from what I am saying. Goes down easily for something this heavy.

Smells of toasted malts, coffee, some bitter cocoa, some raisin, some leather and soil and a bit of resiny hops. Flavor is dry with coffee, dark toasted malts, some more leather, some dirt, some bitterness, some bits of maduro tobacco. Fairly thin for the style with low carb and a dry finish - not sure this leaves me disappointed, but it's certainly different for the style. Overall a beer that is drinkable, but not something I'd tell others to buy and drink over some of the better options out there (although I haven't seen better options bottled here in Boston)","harrymel","Jul 17, 2013"

Long lasting, it leaves ample lacing as it descends with the beer. The aroma is quite nice: multigrain toast, touch of marshmallow, and cocoa with mineral and a hop-forward waft that is a blend of earth, grass, and spring rain. The flavors are abundant and well balanced. Lots of silky smooth chocolate, less coffee, and sweet malt comes first, followed by burnt toast, caramel, and a pleasing mild bitterness that rounds out the finish. The aftertaste reminds me a little bit of Amontillado: a sherry-like, nutty flavor. The texture is extremely smooth and rich bodied, definitely bold enough to hold up to the flavors. Well carbonated and quite drinkable. Hardly any alcohol presence. Overall, a very well made porter that I highly recommend.","DmanGTR","Apr 22, 2013"

Foamy patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and some slight char aromas. Taste is much the same with a cocoa powder flavor on the finish. There is a medium amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

There is still a very dry roast flavor that dominates things but it isn't harsh or completely overbearing. Slightly smokey with some charcoal, burnt malt, oatmeal and espresso bean but this is countered mid-palate by a subtle lactic cream presence as well as some dessert like chocolate sweetness. Hints of sweet and dark chocolate as well as some toffee, caramel and hazelnut. There's also a slight gourmet coffee character without tasting like an overwhelming coffee beer. Really well balanced yet retains enough roast to make it bold and the ABV is very well masked. A complex, intense take on the style that remains an enjoyable drink.","corby112","Feb 10, 2013"

Aromas of dark roasted coffee and bittersweet baker's chocolate blend well on the nose. Flavors are rich and robust, with a blast of baker's chocolate across the middle of the tongue. The richness is all cocoa, and the coffee characteristics provide enough bitter and dryness to cut the cloying. Very strong/big, and very well balanced. The body is robust, but the dryness keeps it palatable, refraining from overpowering. Chocolatey aftertaste, like letting a chocolate truffle melt in your mouth. Slight filmy, lingering finish, but unbelievably pleasant. This is a rich, heavy hitter, and worth looking around for.","GarthDanielson","Feb 10, 2013"

Simple aroma, dark malts, fairly roasty, touches of chocolate and coffee. Porter-ish. Similar taste, dark roasted malts, semi-sweet chocolate and light coffee, mild earthy hops. Seemed like a tiny oxidized off-flavor in there, but well within tolerance. Just about full-bodied, nice and smooth, not a particularly distinctive porter, but still very nice overall.","Rifugium","Nov 14, 2012"

3.93,-5.1,5,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"King Titus started very strong but finished a bit weak in the flavor department. Although this beer is listed as an American porter, it reminded me more of an Irish dry stout (and it would be a fantastic one at that). Perhaps the elevated alcohol presence bumped it out of the aforementioned category.","Damian","Nov 09, 2012"

4.02,-2.9,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"This particular bottle of beer is nicely 1-2 weeks fresh and I have high hopes going into it. The beer pours a lovely brown black with a thick coffee-ice-cream-colored head on top with big rocky bubbles that slowly shore up into a finely compacted unit, leaving behind thick sticky rings and slabs of lacing. This beer smells roasty with a smooth, creamy smell that reminds me of a milk stout’s lactic sugars. There is also a nice strong nutty smell in there reminiscent of a hazelnuts and pecans, and as it warms up slight alcohol spice can be smelt. The beer tastes like a pleasant blend of a nutty brown ale and a roasty stout, which is just fine by me. It begins with creamy notes that still remind me of the lactic sugars in a milk stout, before opening up into medium roasted malt notes, which are quite quickly melded with big nutty flavors with a slight grapefruit and pine sitting in the back of the flavor and resonating more in the aftertaste alongside the pleasant roasty coffee lingering. The aftertaste also occasionally steps into nougat bar flavoring for me, especially right after the beer has left the mouth, which is really quite pleasant and tasty. This beer feels smooth, velvety, and creamy on the tongue, with little to no hint of carbonation. It sits a little thin in the mouth, but this makes it all the easier to drink, and it more than makes up for being thin with flavor and pleasant texture. The beer leaves the mouth slightly sticky-dry with some saliva on the fringes, and thin ichor of stickiness coating the mouth. Overall, this is a superb porter, and another great offering from the Maine Beer Company. Is this my favorite from them, though? Probably not, as that place is still reserved for Zoe, but it holds its own beside Mean Old Tom and even Lunch. This beer is more than worthy of a try.","Maxwell","Nov 08, 2012"

I think one at a sitting is plenty, and I'm positive that if this were available on tap for me, I'd have difficulty returning for a second. This is rich and flavorful but fairly intense. Like all of MBC's beers, this is a good one. However, it will be one that conflicts individual tastes and perceptions of what a style should be. Very worthy of trying, and very tasty. Go into this one with an open mind and you will be rewarded.","OtherShoe2","Oct 11, 2012"

4.05,-2.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,"I highly anticipate any new offering from MBC, so I was excited to hear about King Titus - an ale for an ape. Just from the pour you can tell this is going to be a big porter - deep and near black, hearty looking with a thick beige head. Aroma is surprisingly hoppy up front, juicy, but giving way to a nice woodsy char and roasty chocolate notes. Flavor follows suit - this is really hoppy for a porter, almost borderline black IPA you could say, piney fruity and resinous, but eventually folding to that deep maltyness. The word "robust" is often associated with porters and I think it fits well here - chocolate, nutty, bitter finish yet supple, and a nice rich leathery smoothness. Really a nice beer - kind of an oddball for the style, which is kind of an in-betweener itself, but I think that's part of the charm of this unique beer. Another great effort from the guys at Maine Beer Company - cheers!","twelvsies","Oct 06, 2012"

Do not get me wrong, this is a good porter, just not a great porter. Much better than their stout offering, Mean Old Tom. If you have a thing for Porter, than definitely try this one. If you've never tried anything from MBC before, do not go for this first! Go for Lunch, Peeper, or Zoe.","steve8robin","Oct 04, 2012"

Layers of flavor and a near-full body make this a great example of the style and one that isn't topped by many pure, standard porters. The price point is right around the MBC average, which is a bit high compared to some others, but the quality is right there too. What a beer!","BEERMILER12","Oct 04, 2012"
