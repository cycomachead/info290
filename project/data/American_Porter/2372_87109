3.83,0.5,3.75,3.75,4,3.5,3.75,"Dark and opaque with a fleeting cream colored head that yielded great lacing and just a little fizz about the top. Nose is immediately chocolate that fades into a more malty design. Taste is similar to the nose as it hits quick with chocolate but slowly fades to a more bitter offering that loses most of the sweetness but never really loses the chocolate. Like bitter dark chocolate. Not too much peanut butter, if any at all that I can detect. Finishes quite bitter but oddly, unlike the travels of the taste, it finishes with a cloying sweetness. Thin, slightly crisp.  Taste is not bad at all, but lacks a little depth in the body.","gopens44","Mar 29, 2015"

Taste- bitter dark chocolate, don't get a ton of peanut butter here. It all tastes a little fake. Very malt forward. Little to no sweetness. Feel- not as creamy as I would have liked. My advice, go with Sweet Baby Jesus for a superior chocolate peanut butter stout.","Antc2382","Mar 08, 2015"

4.06,6.6,4,4.25,4,4,4,"Personally I think this is one of the best peanut butter beers on the market (although it actually uses a peanut extract). There's enough PB that you get it clearly in the nose, and clearly in the flavor, but then it becomes just another component (nutty) as the chocolatey malt steps forward. So perhaps it's too sweet for some, and I could agree with that if it was a standard porter, or maybe even just a "chocolate porter", but as a "chocolate peanut butter porter" you kind of have to expect that it's a little sweet. And yet it's not quite a full-on dessert beer - you can drink one of these and not find it cloying. So I guess it's one of those beers that you either like or don't like because you can't really argue that it's not to style. If you found a defect, that would be one thing, but as it's currently designated, as long as it roughly fits into the "porter" guidelines... "all's fair in love and war".","NeroFiddled","Mar 02, 2015"

Pours such a clear deep brown that it appears tar black, producing barely 2 fingers of light mocha, somewhat lasting, frothy head that leaves thin streaks & webs of lace. Nose is dark roasted malt, chocolate milk, peanut butter, caramel, vanilla, butter, heavily creamed coffee & a hint of smoke. Taste is dark, deeply roasted malts, peanut butter cookies dipped in dark chocolate, Nestle' Quik & heavily creamed coffee with butter in the finish. It has an overall flavor reminiscent of a bite of fudge ripple ice cream in a deeply bready cone. Aftertaste is burnt coffee & peanuts in a lightly bitter note & a hint of smoke.

3.78,-0.8,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"how uncommon is this? a peanut butter porter! although i have seen many attempts, this might be the only one i would drink again, its delicious. man it must be hard to use that ingredient in a beer, not just because of its texture, but because of its fat content, not water soluble right? so how do you do it? its awesome. i also like that its subtle, i mean, this is a rich roasty porter before its a peanut butter beer, and i love that aspect. the peanut butter is almost faint in the nose, and a little more forward in the flavor, but still nowhere near over the top. it adds a fitting nuttiness that works with both the grains and the yeast, and there is a bitter roast to this that cuts any sweetness that might be present from the peanut butter. what i think i like the most, in addition to all the layers going on with the flavor, is the texture. its silky smooth, not greasy or oily or sticky or sweet or any of the feels i usually think about with peanut butter, so thats awesome, and i score it highly there not because i love the way it feels necessarily, its not that different from other good porters, but because it is none of those feels that would be out of place in a beer. fun fun beer, i could even have a few of them. so keen to try the banana edition.","StonedTrippin","Feb 23, 2015"

This one more that works but is incredibly balanced and flavorful.  Nice chocolate, coffee, hop and peanut butter that is blended for a great mixture of flavor.  Not nearly as ashy as the Wake and Bake.  Sweet yet crisp finish.  Body is a little light and I almost wish this brew was bigger, thicker and sweeter, but for how it is currently made, I think its still outstanding as/is.  Enjoyed this one tremendously and highly recommend over many other more "faddish" titled peanut butter stouts out there (looking at you S.B.J).","bubseymour","Jan 29, 2015"

Soft, airy mouthfeel, good dark-burn bitter porter notes, mild sweetness, and a potent Reese's aroma that luckily gives way to a more moderated, much cleaner peanut-butter-cup quality at the beer's heart.  All of that is washed away nicely by mellow hop bittering and dry malt tones.  If you're going gimmick, points are deserved for executing it with reasonable aplomb—and I'd say Liquid Bliss is deserving of such points, even if candied-up dark beers aren't in my personal wheelhouse.","OrestesMethuon","Jan 17, 2015"

4.16,9.2,3.75,4.5,4.25,3,4.25,"Enjoyed this at Cafe Craft in North Charleston, SC. Split the last remaining bottle in the joint with a friend. Poured in to a pint glass with a near black appearance and a thin coating of tan foam. Visible bursts of carbonation in the glass, like a cola. Obvious aroma of earthy whole peanuts, dirty shell and all. A little milk chocolate in the nose creates a nutty buddy appeal. Ok, now for the first sip... Roasted peanuts in the front with a tangy bitterness in the back. Mildly sweet chocolate undercurrent pulls it together. The aftertaste is like a freshly chewed mouthful of dry roasted peanuts with a lingering bitter dark chocolate wafer. The mouthfeel is a little thin, partially masked by aggressive carbonation. Overall, Terrapin has succeeded in creating a remarkable likeness to Little Debbie Nutty Bars. Perhaps not as sweet, but in the context of a beer it's tremendous. This one is lacking the silky, creamy texture or richness of my favorite porters but for what it is, it's great nonetheless. Hopefully they reign in the carbonation a little and add some depth to the body. If so, this could become a favorite of mine. That said, I'm a sucker for chocolate and peanut butter. Thank you to my own nutty buddy that let me split his beer.","JohnnyI","Jan 11, 2015"

There is also some slight chocolate. Flavor profile lacked what punch the aroma provided. Mildly reminiscent of the flavors on the label, but all in all, lackluster and poor. Chalky and thin on the body. Not the best beer from Terrapin. In fact, I opened a Founders Breakfast Stout and mixed about half of it with the remaining Terrapin beer to make it enjoyable.","SaCkErZ9","Nov 23, 2014"

The aroma is as advertised on the bottle with the peanut butter dominating and the chocolate more of a background note.  The taste is a mélange of chocolate, dark malt and peanut butter.

The beer itself is a very dark brown with a pretty slick surface. The smell is a mixture of peanut butter and dark chocolate that is very pleasing to the nose. The sweet dark chocolate is dominated by the peanut butter but it is still pretty good. The taste, however, is a little bit disappointing. The taste is only a mere shadow of the smell. The peanut butter is much weaker and barely there while the dark chocolate does not seem to exist. Rather, the taste has a somewhat unpleasant taste that resembles watered down peanut butter. The mouthfeel is a bit watery and not very pleasant and barely any carbonation. Overall, this Terrapin is like every other Terrapin I've had; the beer has a promising smell but disappoints in the tastes and mouthfeel.","HattedClassic","Nov 02, 2014"

Flavor is more chocolatey upfront, with a touch of toasted malt hitting mid palate, and light roast bitterness carrying into the finish, where peanut butter closes out the experience. I'm a sucker for dessert beers, and this is a nice representation without being sweet. There's even a saline flavor that lingers. If this had a touch of sweetness... There's also an acrid and metallic flavor that emerges.","barczar","Oct 22, 2014"

The aroma is like an Easter basket, with recognizable notes of chocolate and peanuts that are gimmicky but enjoyable. The chocolate and peanut butter come through clearly in the flavor as well, but not in an artificial way. Rather, the nutty, sweet, and cocoa characteristics are similar to those found in other porters, but they are just amplified in this beer. The mouthfeel is thankfully lighter than expected, as this would have been hard to take down if it was thick and syrupy. Overall, I don't know that I could drink much of this, but the novelty of it is fun.","devilben02","Sep 05, 2014"

3.75,-1.6,,,,,,"I have said it before, but one of the things that I really dig about these dark-colored beers is the way that the pseudo-cascade is truly obvious when I employ a heavy-handed pour. Once it settled, it produced two-plus fingers of dense, deep-tan/light-brown head with excellent retention. I am going to call the color an Opaque Black (SRM = 44) because with settling, I am unable to get any light penetration. Nose smelled like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup in my glass! It reminds me of my late Pops, who loved them and Tastykake Peanut Butter TandyTakes, white cakes with a top layer of peanut butter and fully enrobed in chocolate. Mouthfeel was medium, but I felt as though it should be fuller. Taste was spot-on chocolate and peanut butter. Wow! It was a bit sweet for my hophead palate, which is why I do not make it a regular thing at the Spring House Taproom, but it was truth in advertising. Finish was sweet, but not cloying, which would be a definite possibility with this admixture. I can take one at a time, but I am going back to something else after this.","woodychandler","Aug 16, 2014"
4.25,11.5,,,,,,"Pitch black nice mocha tan head, forms evenly across the sides of my chalice, Big peanut butter nose, dark roasted malt provides chocolate, this is good stuff...dessert in a beer.  Flavor brings more peanut butter notes with dark chocolate better than Sweet Baby Jesus, roasted malt and the peanut butter flavor mesh so well this is a treat.  Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied not something I could drink in number but it's oh so tasty on the palate.  Overall the type of dark beer I wanna get to know again and again, great stuff from Athens, GA!!!","WVbeergeek","Aug 15, 2014"

It would be wiser to get a Porter that was more filling and roast some s'mores while enjoying it. This will suffice alright for the warmer months but would not be my first choice if I had the heat on right now.","JerzDevl2000","Jul 17, 2014"

Steady flow of carbonation throughout the body, too. Aromas of fresh baked chocolate brownies, peanut bitter rich and sweet, roasted notes, and a subtle sugary highlight. Flavors are subtle roasted chocolate, bittersweet, with a peanut butter backbone that is richly sweet. Nice balance, with a hint of roasted coffee. Mid-bodied, slightly dry, and smooth in mouth. The aftertaste is a solid blend of chocolate and peanut butter, again both sweet and slightly dry. The finish is smooth, dry, and with a solid linger. Decent brew for the flavor profile, and fits the style well.","GarthDanielson","Jul 01, 2014"

Taste starts off with a very strong flavor of dark chocolate and only hints of peanut butter on the finish. However, as the beer warms, the peanut butter taste truly begins to shine.

The nose is nice, with dark chocolate and fresh roasted peanuts mingling and being buttressed by a bit of roasty grain. I just wish the aromatics were a bit more potent. The flavor profile leads off with a bit of roastiness, which quickly fades into an impressively authentic peanut flavor. A brief splash of dark chocolate provides the finish. The balance is just a little bit off though, as the peanuts don't leave much room for anything else. The carbonation, while serviceable, isn't great. The body could stand to be a little more full, and the carbonation's got a bit too much kick for my taste. It's my impression that peanut/peanut butter beers aren't the easiest to brew, but Terrapin had done an admirable job with Liquid Bliss.","axeman9182","Dec 31, 2012"

The whole peanut and chocolate thing really comes through about an hour after taking it out from the fridge. Any sooner, and the flavors don't quite meld together. After a solid warming period, the peanut and chocolate flavors really work. The aftertaste is a bit muted though, a nice finish would have really made this beer, and it's just a little lacking. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and decently carbonated, and the drinkablity is great. Overall, this is a good experiment that just misses greatness.

The potential is there, and they did a good job bringing out the peanut characters, it overall just a little weak for my liking. But then again I am a whore for big beers. That being said, I really did enjoy it.","zac16125","Nov 24, 2012"

Not quite as big or bold in the chocolate and peanut butter flavors as I would have liked and more body would help too. Still, they pretty much got what they were aiming for as the peanut butter and chocolate are the predominant flavors here.","elgiacomo","Nov 19, 2012"
2.99,-21.5,4,2.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,"Nothing special. As far as porters go, it's a fairly decent one -- maybe even good. But this wasn't supposed to be yet another garden-variety porter -- it was supposed to be a wonderful medley of peanut butter and chocolate. The label promised me so! But Liquid Bliss fails to deliver. If you want a porter, fine, go ahead I guess. But at $7.99 for 22 oz, there are many better options out there.","Mavajo","Nov 19, 2012"
