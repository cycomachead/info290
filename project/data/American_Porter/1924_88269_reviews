"Strong chocolate sweetness. Peanut butter in the smell and quite noticeable in the taste. Very tasty but wouldn't drink more than one at a time."
""
"Very interesting, not sure it is balanced.  Coffee and chocolate, but man the peanuts just throw things off."
""
""
""
"Cloying as hell.  Tastes like they squirted a few pumps of Reese's flavoring into each bottle before capping it.  DuClaw usually has solid offerings, I don't know what this was supposed to be."
""
""
"Tastes like a Reese's. Great porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OK, we're talking Reese's Peanut Butter Cup here.  A little over the top for me, but some people may like it.  A once-in-a-very-long-while selection."
""
"Thick and chewy.  Definitely has notes of chocolate and peanut butter.  A bit sweet.  Can only stomach one of these at a time."
""
"Tastes worst than bad dogfood"
""
""
""

""

""
""
"overall: very sweet and a bit artifical tasting. more of a dessert beer"
""
"Rating is based on being a peanut butter porter. It has a great smell. Nice finish. Thin like a porter but pretty dark nice lace. Not a bad porter and for being my first peanut butter porter, it was a decent experience. If it were bba and 3% higher abv itd be phenominal...just a thought"
""
""
"Certainly something that is interesting and fairly enjoyable, but I dont think I would make a regular habit of drinking this one."
"If super sweet beers and peanut butter are your thing then go for it. Otherwise stay away.  I would hesitate to call this ""beer"".  It is about as much a beer as limerita, flavored malt beverage at best."
""
"BA Overall: 88"
""
""
"Bought a single as part a a build-your-own 6-pack; wouldn't buy it again..."
"Suprisingly good. Very tasty with excellent aroma and smooth mouthfeel."
""
""
"Overall, a fairly decent porter and one worth getting. Personally, I think this is one of the better Peanut Butter porters out on the market. I definitely recommend getting this beer if you can."
""
"This is a great beer, but is so much better draft.  The bottle loses some of the flavor that makes it so special."
""
"Overall / Drinkability:  Definitely a dessert beer.  Scratch that - the beer is desert.  You may be able to pair this with something else like ice cream or maybe a burger, but even then I'm not sure about that.  I'm of two minds on this beer - the aroma is great and its a neat treat, and yet one I'm finding is more than enough with this beer - I'm not inclined to have more.  It could be that because I had this after being already full from dinner that this is just too much, so I need to give it another try next time I find it, it for no other reason than to savor that amazing aroma.  So a good beer, but maybe to extreme for me.  I've had other dessert beers that I finished and wanted more - not this one though."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not as much of a peanut butter taste as I was expecting but still a great bottle that doesn't rely on a ""gimmick"" factor."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is peanut butter followed by bitter chocolate rounded out with some faint coffee notes. It has an almost yeasty malt after taste. This is a solid Porter, but not great."
"Amazing porter, definately recommend to anyone"
""
""
"Smooth and delicious. Lingering aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is very cliquey, for lack of a better term. From what I have experience, few people think it's 'ok'; most of whom that (I know) have tried it either loved it or hated it. Personally, I love the chocolate aroma and taste. It is not very harsh whatsoever. In fact, the beer is somewhat a relief to my tongue as it has an abnormal sensitivity to carbonated drinks. Moreover, the flavour is strong. Though I will say I am biased; this is one of my favourite beers."
""
""
"Smells awesome. Love the peanut butter/chocolate combo. Light in the mouth. A  great dessert beer."
"This beer is not for everyone. I think of it as a nice change of pace beer from the usual ipa I like. The chocolate/peanut butter is not overpowering but definitely makes it's presence felt."
""
""
"As a sipper, this is really nice. But take more than a sip, and the peanut butter became unpleasantly bitter. However, this one smells heavenly."
""
""
""
""
"I think that this is the absolute worst beer that I have ever tasted. Like cheap candy and peanut butter mixed with water."
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, good dessert-like representation of style, this is a nice beer to drink for a while if youâ€™re looking for peanut butter/chocolate flavor."
""
"This is a very well rounded stout with distinct flavor of chocolate and peanut butter; side notes of toffee and french roast. Not overly complex and washes back clean feels lighter than most5 porters; refreshing as a flavored dark beer can be while still packing a punch @  6.5 abv"
""
"Very nice chocolate peanut butter taste."
"Suprisingly delicious and tasty beer. You actually taste the chocolate and peanut butter."
""
"O: [3.50] I was really excited when I saw this on the shelf.  I guess I am a little let down.  It is good - but not great.  I have 5 more.  I will share them with the world.  I thought I might keep them all for myself.  The taste and the body are just not up to where I thought they'd be."
""
"Sweet and full of flavor."
""
"One of the best beers I've had."
"Amazing beer, Duclaw killed it!!"
"Tastes exactly like chocolate and peanut butter. Would love to get this in the Midwest."
""
""
"Much better from tap than bottle! Excellent dessert beer. Thick, rich, and sweet, with a strong peanut butter and chocolate aftertaste."
"o: Describes itself as a ""Chocolate Peanut Butter Porter," but I taste hazelnut more than peanut butter, although it does leave a peanut butterlike aftertaste in the corners of the mouth.  Pretty tasty with this unusual combination, especially if you like peanut butter.  I do but not so much in my beer, or in cookies for that matter, but that's just me."
""
"O- As someone who enjoys a good dessert beer, this one does the job very well.  Very easy drinking and is sure to satisfy a peanut butter lover's tastes."
""
""
"O - All my friends love this beer; had it twice so far, trying to give it a chance, but it just ain't doing it for me.  I may give it a third try under dirrerent circumstances to see if I get a different impression.  Thumbs down for now."
"If you have a piece of dark chocolate cake and this porter you might want to be left alone."
""
"Sweet baby yes yes yes. Very subtle peanut butter presence for a rockin porter."
""
"Has just the right amount of chocolate and peanut butter for a flavor beer, without overpowering the porter completely."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer was OK, I guess I was expecting more flavor after experiencing the smell. Good brew, but nothing out of this world."
""
""
""
""
"To me it's a good porter. Flavors of roasted nuts and earthy notes backed by a light tone of cocoa fused with just the right amount of hops. The beer it selfs is not as thick as I thought it'd be. It didn't give me a full feeling and went down quite easy. Again another DuClaw beer I like...Now I'm hungry for a peanut butter cup lol"
""
""
""
""
"Sweet Baby Jesus by DuClaw brewery is an ok beer.  The smell is awesome, but the taste doesn't match.  Some have called it a dessert beer.  I think they must not eat dessert much.  I wouldn't call it a dessert beer.  A good porter though. Worth trying if that is what you are looking for."
""
""
""
"Black with some ruby highlights and crowned with a creamy, bubbly off-white head.  Smells remarkably like a peanut butter cup...creamy dry peanut butter, cocoa, and a touch of berries.  Flavor is a little more Porter-like, but the peanuts are still definitely there.  Chocolaty sweetness, roasted nuts, black malt, and some earthy hop bitterness.  Medium body with some creaminess, finishing dry.  I could drink a few of these."
"   Chocolate and Peanut Butter is one of my favorite flavor combinations, and I would like to find a beer that is a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup in a beer as a dessert beer. This is an enjoyable beer, but the chocolate and the peanut flavor needs to be increased by a factor of 3. The peanut flavor is not really peanut butter  so much as dry roasted peanuts.  Mouth feel-wise, I would like the beer to be thicker and more creamy in texture. I would like to try this on draft to see if the chocolate and peanut flavors are more pronounced."
"A lot of one's opinion of this beer hinges on if one is a sweet tooth. I definitely am. Therefore, this beer really appeals to me. For a dessert beer, I have not had much better. The smell of this beer is near perfection. Taste of the chocolate and peanut butter is not far behind. Only gripe is the porter is a tad bit watery, would be better with a thicker, smoother stout feel. Also, you really could only take down one or two of this in a session. However, when it comes to dessert drinks, this is top notch."
"Little to no head- sweet synthetic  chocolate scent. The peanut butter part is subtle. I'd recommend drinking this from the bottle to avoid smell. Still a good porter. Would advise to try"
""
""
"Surprisingly good, especially for a strange combination of flavors. Not in the best tier of american porters, but a beer that everyone should try at least once."
""
""
""
"I actually think the bottled tastes better than the draft.  I find it more distinctive.  And I am  heavily biased toward draft beer."
"Too sweet for my taste"
""
""
"This beer started off good with the looks but then everything else was down hill borderline Drain pour"
""
""
"Just not a peanut taste in my beer fan, but the aroma is amazing.  I feel like a should keep a bottle and use as cologne."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the 3 best beers I've ever had. I'm a chocolate stout fan first and foremost. When I smelled the PB i was a little nervous, but it turned out awesome. If you're up for something different it's great."
"Based on several failed attempts I've had over the years I think peanut butter must be a tough flavor for beer but Sweet Baby Jesus is one of the two that I'd say did it right. It may not be perfect but it's worth a try, particularly if you like peanut butter in your porter."
"Overall a great tasting beer. More light of a mouth feel than I wanted. The chocolate and peanut butter really come through."
""
""
"Not traditional in any sense, but I love peanut butter and love the way it was incorporated in this beer. A rare adjunct to be handled well!"
""
"Not as much peanut butter taste as the Resurgence Peanut Butter Porter, but still a solid choice"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Was hoping for more of a peanut butter taste. I can taste Malt and a hint of chocolate to the nose. Still a wonderful porter that I'd drink again."
"m: its chocolate peanut butter.  'nuff said"
""
""
"But I will be back for more....."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good to start off the night."
""
""
"Smells like a peanut butter cup but leaves peanuts out of the flavor. A really tasty and interesting beer."
""
"Overall: A novel beer, ideal for sipping but not sure I could drink more than one in a sitting. A little cloying"
""
""
"Appearance 4.25, Aroma 4.5, Flavor 4.75, Palate 4.5, Overall 4.5"

"DATE TASTED: December 18, 2014... GLASSWARE: Guinness classic pint... OCCASION: a Blackish marathon... APPEARANCE: dark black body with creamy brown head that laces and traces well; head is steady throughout... AROMA: burnt toffee and what can only be described as scratch'n'sniff peanut butter; oats, chocolate and vanilla provide a balance of undertones... PALATE: rich, creamy and medium-bodied; slightly warming at 6.5% ABV; agreeable...TASTE: more peat than peanut; roasted malty goodness--a bit grainy and gritty, as a lunchbox brew should be... OVERALL: expectations were impossibly high here, and unfortunately, the beer could not meet them--but to be fair, its mild chocolate and peanut butter compliments the earthy mouthfeel, and a solid porter is worthy of being sought out..."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel was light and smooth with mild bitterness, a little bit if a chewy feel and enough cocoa malts to compliment the peanut butter flavor and hide the ABV completely. Not sure I could have more than one per session, but I'd definitely recommend this and have it again."
""
""
""
"In general, I always think peanut butter chocolate porters sound and smell better than how they taste, or maybe I haven't found the right one yet, because I had higher expectations (especially from friends who had this beer before me). It was a good beer, but on the lower end of the porters on my list."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O = A nice beer.  Something different.  If they could figure out how to make it a bit thicker and get the peanut butter taste to be as prevalent as it smells they'd have a real winner."
""
""
"Had this on tap in Va. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is there's so much peanut butter, I can't drink it all day long. Otherwise, excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall ok, plenty of peanut butter, not much left for porter though, but enjoyable and fun."

"Overall,  this beer is a solid to excellent novelty porter that compares favorably with more mainstream American Porters. A decidedly sweet beer, this is not for everyday drinking but is certainly worth trying for any beer enthusiast or casual drinker in the area. This beer can generally be found only in the midatlantic."
""
""
""
""
"Can't get past the heavy peanut butter to enjoy it. Reducing that some would help this beer a lot."

"Had this on tap at DCA, my first offering from these guys. I was excited about the idea because I love a nice sweet Porter after dinner, but was a little disappointed. The color is fine, but the body is a little light for a porter, I expected this to just sit in my stomach. You could definitely taste the peanuts, but something was still missing. It's ok, give it a try...but someone will (and may already) make a better version."
"Remarks:  I'm glad I only got a single in a mix pack; I don't think I'd like having to drink 5 more of these."

"Delicious, pours a nice dark black. Minimal head on my pour. The nose is a nice peanut-buttery chocolate smell, with more of a faint chocolate taste in the back of the mouth after drinking. It's smooth. Thin feeling when drinking.  Really enjoyable."

"Dark beer black but brown edges. Smell is like a Reese's and subtle hops. Taste is peanut butter strong first. Then chocolate and biter dryness.  I liked it more than dirty little freak but still was not a huge fan. Smelled and looked better than anything else it had going"

"O: not quite as balanced and refined as the Terrapin Liquid Bliss I had soon after."
""
""
""
"Overall (3.75): I didnt know how to rate this one as i havent had a beer like this before and had nothing to compare to. I did enjoy it, but everything about the peanut butter screams artificial. I think I would have preferred more chocolate and less peanut butter. i could only drink one of these as a desert beer, and have to wash it down with a good IPA. The body is also thin and watery, but after all said and done it is a solid brew for what it is intended to be."

"Poured into pint glass, no noticeable head, very dark brown with slight red undertones.  Very roasted coffee aroma, peanut butter is noticeable followed by chocolate.  Strong roasted malt backbone, starts sweet but finishes slightly bitter.  Can definitely taste peanut butter and chocolate.  Fairly medium bodied.  Interesting taste, but overall fails to deliver fully."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours deep black with a thin beige head. Upon pouring a terrific aroma of chocolate peanut butter fills the nose. Amazingly the aroma slowly transfer to the taste as it warms up which is followed by some dark mild toasted malt and caramel. Palate is a full smooth and creamy body. The finish is more of the same but gets slightly richer as it warms up some more some mild bitter notes for balance. Overall a very tasty chocolaty peanut butter flavored brew. Very enjoyable to drink."
""
"I initially passed on buying this beer when I first saw it. I didn't think peanut flavors in a beer would work, even with a porter or stout. Surprisingly, DuClaw pulls it off exceptionally well. The look and feel are what would be expected in a porter, dark, light carbonation, medium body. Somewhat disappointingly, the head is on the small side and there is little lace. The peanuts come out predominantly in the aroma and in the taste middle to finish, where it is secondary to the roasted malt. The roast characteristics are more traditional porter, much lighter than some of the more recent ""super"" porters, such as Founder's Porter, that drink more stout like. The finish is mildly bittersweet, perhaps a bit too mild, with a bit of peanut earthiness."

"I really enjoyed the chocolate and peanut butter, both on the nose and its taste.  However, I felt the base beer was lacking in flavor and consistency, limiting its overall rating."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
"Enjoyable in small quantities.  I don't think I could drink more than one bottle in a sitting."
""
""

"An excellent  combination of roasty malts with peanut butter.  The peanut butter is pronounced and adds to the flavor of the beer.  One of the better beers I have had in some time."
"Thinnish half finger head, doesnâ€™t stick around long, a dusting across the surface, the lacing slides off in slippery sheets. Opaque dark brown liquid, turns to a rust orange near the surface which allows you to see how much chunky particulate there is inside, a few beads of bubbles visible. The nose is almost entirely peanut butter, some chocolate powder, has some roast but basically you might as well open a jar of Skippy and put your nose in it. Light to medium-bodied, carbonated attack prevents it from soaking into the mouth, weak finish. Here the peanut butter is just as strong, chocolate and maybe it is psychological but thereâ€™s also grape jelly. Burnt roastiness, lactose and challah bread along with sweeter nuts. Actually wish it was sweeter so it would have a clearer purpose when consumed. Lacks smooth flow and tends to gum up from front palate to rear. One trick pony that is fun once and thatâ€™s about it."

"Any beer made with artificial flavoring is wrong. Fake peanut butter flavor is fake. No effort needed. Anyone can put any concoction of chemicals to taste like any flavor you want. As much effort as bud light lime. Please stop supporting faux craft beer."

"O) A creative porter. Not really peanut butter, but a valiant effort."
""
""
""
"O: This beer feels heavier in body compared to other porters and seems to be more like a stout. It has a hood balance between the chocolate and peanut butter flavors and makes for a good dessert beer."
""
""
"Overall â€“ A nice sweet chocolate peanut butter cup brew with a good drinkability and abv. If the body was only a little bit thicker this would be spot on for a dessert brew. Even so this is really a quite nice brew overall."
""
""
""
""
""
"From what I have sampled, DuClaw seems to be a gimmicky brewery, and this is the king of their gimmicky beers. The insane amount of peanut butter just blatantly jumps the shark. What you can taste about the porter isn't really all that bad, like the pleasant chocolaty malts ... but it's hard to detect anything beyond the obnoxious peanut butter. I do like brewers trying new things and being experimental, and I know several people that love this beer. But for me, this was not enjoyable and I will never be having this one again."

"Taste is heavier on the chocolate than peanut butter as expected, I cant imagine it is easy to get that flavor in a beer...chocolate on the other hand...manageable. Its really more of a nutty presence than peanut butter, but a nice touch nonetheless. I like the fact they steered clear of hops for the most part, it would have ruined the nice sweet, chocolaty profile they were aiming for. Mouthfeel is decent, but I wouldnt mind a little more viscosity. Low carbonation is about right for this kind of beer. I like this, quite a bit actually...I would definitely recommend this."

"I used my usual heavy-handed pour if for no other reason than to get a pseudo-cascade rolling in the glass. This produced not quite two fingers of dense, deep-tan head with good retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. I found the nose to be more muted than the Horny Goat. Here, the chocolate was more prevalent with the peanut butter underlying it, which struck me as being perhaps more palatable. Mouthfeel was medium, thinner that the Horny Goat, but more in line with what I expect in a Porter. The taste was unexpectedly rich and here I was reminded of my paternal grandmother's birthday cake icing, usually on Devil's Food Cake. She would buy frosting mix (do they even sell that any more?) and mix it up in a mixing bowl using a mixer, and once it achieved a certain creaminess, she would add in chunky peanut butter to thicken it and then slather it on the cake. As a kid, I really looked forward to birthdays at our house, but now, I would probably find it too sweet. Now, to clarify on this one - it was sweet, yes, but not as sweet as the Horny Goat. The finish was semi-dry, at most, but there was still a good bit of sweetness lingering in evidence well past the swallow. Just like with the Horny Goat, this would be a one-and-done for me, but given a choice, I would take this one before a Horny Goat simply because it just was not quite as sweet. More damning with faint praise, I suppose."

"I love just about anything with peanut butter, so I was really excited to try this. It looks like a decent porter in the glass and smells really good! The peanuty nose got my expectations really high! And then I tasted it....oh god.. it's like burnt toast drizzled with acid... not even remotely like peanuts or chocolate for that matter. Prickly carbonation and unnatural chemicaly flavors feel like they are leaving mild burns in my mouth. It gets worse as it warms up. The smell is only there to tease me as to how good this beer could/should have been juxtaposed with this abomination. I got about halfway through the bottle and couldn't take it any more... one of my very few drain pours. I'll give it this much, it's unique, but that doesn't make it any good. If your curiousity compels you to try this make sure you buy it as a single."

"Served in a tulip. Pours the color and clarity of cola with a loose, khaki-colored head that dissipates towards the shoulders. Nose on this beer is great - think peanut butter cups with just a hint of roast. Taste follows nose; however, not as bold as the nose and a little watery. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light) with a light, even carbonation, a thin body and a slight oiliness. Overall, a pretty decent porter - great nose, but falls apart in the flavor profile and mouthfeel. A decent porter, but nothing to write home about."

"Overall: What's strange is, I was never a really big chocolate/peanut butter fan until I drank not only this, but Big Gruesome. Then anytime I had a brownie or any chocolate dessert, I added a dollop of peanut butter. I want to say I prefer Big Gruesome over this, which I have also reviewed, but I'd really have to try them back to back."

"peanut butter is a gnarly ingredient in beer. i mean, brilliant, but when do you add it? i can't see it working in a mash, maybe in a bright tank, but wouldn't it all congeal all weird in the cold and not impart much flavor? if it was added hot, wouldn't it melt and make a greasy beer with no ability to hold a head? lots of questions, and this beer doesn't answer a single one, but i like it for trying. i think my problem with this one is the base beer, not a real robust or full enough bodied porter for the flavors its trying to support. nutty not the nose, more peanuts than peanut butter per se, which I'm fine with, and a cocoa finish. bitter malt and maybe a little over hopped in the taste, but i like the integration of the peanut flavor. more chocolate would help this i think, as would m,pre body on the base beer, but the level of roast is nice and works with the nut complex, and the carbonation is there. seems like it was fermented a little too arm or something, i get a slight staleness to the yeast, but other than that, i enjoyed this quite a lot. could use a few tweaks, but a very cool use of a tricky and perplexing ingredient."

"The sweet fragant aroma of chocolate and peanut butter emits from the glass ever so sweetly. Your nose tries to warn your mouth of whats to come.. but the smell is just the beginning. As you begin the taste Sweet Baby Jesus unleashes it's decadent power. Not an overly powerful mouth feel, making this nectar perfect to devour, alone..w/ ice cream..perhaps over some bananas foster..what?!?! Yup."

"O: The beer has potential. Again, I believe it could have been better. A maltier backbone would've improved the overall taste and quality of the beer. I await the imperial version of this porter to come out with great anticipation."
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, black-ish coloring with a thin, low profile, foamy, light tan head. Aromas of full bore peanut butter on the nose. Seriously, it's like you just dove into the middle of a Reese's cup. Holy shit. If you really dig in there, you can get some chocolate highlights, but this bad boy is almost entirely PB on the nose. Flavors fall off a bit, but still solid, with a blast of bittersweet baker's chocolate followed rapidly by a wave of that same peanut butter character. This is one of the better applications of the peanut butter characteristic that I have encountered in the beer world. The body is light, crisp, and dry, with a rich, sweet, roasted peanut butter and chocolate aftertaste. This is a goddamn liquid candy bar. The finish is slick, clean, and dry. Amazing beer...it really is perfect for a candy loving fat guy like myself. What a fun brew!"

"If you like or love Reese's peanut butter cups this is your beer. Chocolate and peanut butter in a very nice porter. I will definitely be purchasing more and recommending to friends. This is a delightful after dinner drink, that satisfies the sweet tooth and beer craving after a nice meal. Very smooth taste, and finish. Pick some up if you can find it!"

"I poured this outstanding beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was really black and I really had reservations about a beer with pnut butter. The tan head the beer poured was very nice. The beer was really good with just a touch of the pnut butter taste taste coming through a rich afterburner sorghum molasses taste I really liked. I will certainly buy this beer again."
""
"O: I am rating this beer for what it is, it isn't something you would drink 4 of in one night but it is good when drinking one here or there. Usually gimmicky/novelty beers like this gross me out but this one was not bad, I am a sucker for peanut butter!"
""
""
""
""
"Dark and opaque with a beige foamy head. Looks rich when it pours. Nose is sweet and nutty..lots of banana as well. Very mild .. Definitely hazelnut in there on a major level. Flavor follows through with the sweetness and develops into peanut butter and sugar wafer. Mouthfeel is typical of a porter on the creamier side. Overall I love what this beer delivers..but you gotta have a sweet tooth to really dig it"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, while I wouldn't want to drink this on any kind of regular basis, it's very enjoyable when the mood persists. If this were slightly heavier bodied and frothier, it would be a phenomenal treat. Nitro tap please."

"And now, I must regretfully take this glass over to the kitchen sink...."
""
""
""
"Regardless, this beer is absolutely a 5/5. The only thing bad is the aftertaste, but it's of peanuts. All in all it's still a win-win. At 6.5% ABV this is truly alcoholism in a bottle."
""
"This beer is very thin and somewhat watery. The smell is very weak. The mouthfeel is lacking. The taste is disappointing. When I read chocolate peanut butter porter, I am expecting chocolate and peanut butter. The chocolate and peanut butter taste is lacking. I would not drink this again. Maybe I had an old bottle. I bet it tastes great on tap."
"O- one the better ""flavored"" beers I have had in a while. PB from the aroma to the flavor. It is a weird mix of flavors, but it all works for me."
""
""
""
""
"This gave me a new low in which to measure all other beers. WOW was this sour! not a ""raspberry"" sour, a ""gone bad"" sour. Yikes!! The reviews are all over the board, really good to (in my case) really bad. How can 1 beer be so different to so many people?"
""
""
""
"Overall- I actually could not finish this one which says a lot from me. Unable to swallow without making a face. As stated, there is a sourness and staleness in the taste. Try it if you were curious like I was but use caution. This bottle was not expired either."
""
"Mouth is slightly on the thin side, overall, a good porter /stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I enjoyed this beer, but can't say I'd go out of my way for it. That being said, maybe it's just fallen off a little bit since it was bottled in December."

""
""
"O: Overall while the idea is intriguing, the aroma not bad, the execution here flavor wise fails miserablely and didn't translate for me. Seemed a bit stale, thin, with some tinny off flavors and the peanut butter though enticing on the nose, was stale and hardly recoginizable in the flavor. Really not an enjoyable drink and one that i struggled to finish. You can probably get a sample of this at a growler station, even a single purchase will make you doubt judgement later. Im pretty close in scoring to the ba average for a great deal of time, but this one i just cant agree with. A gimmick beer with an interesting concept that was poorly executed and a whole heartly avoid unless you just have to see if the schrodingers cat is really alive in the box."
""
""
""
"The stout body is fine at first but there is an awful reaction i guess from the combination of stout and peanut butter that makes this almost undrinkable while drinking it but the aftertaste is actually not bad. it is drinkable but only because i refused to sandbag a beer."
""
""
""
"O- Better than I thought it would be. Not too sweet, a big plus; chocolate and PB could've been a sugar bomb."

"Sweet Baby Jesus pours a black color, with a small lacing head. There is a strong peanut butter aroma. The has a strong peanut butter flavor, with hints of chocolates, tastes like a peanut butter cup. Nice and creamy, no overpowering flavors. Overall a nice creamy well put together beer."

"An interesting and tasty porter, could stand to have a bit more flavor and body. The aroma is quite attractive though. I'd say this one is worth trying and it gets points for innovation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Disappointing after such a wonderful aroma. Seems to have been caught in the middle between being a dessert beer or being a legit porter, and came away with being a fair but forgettable brew in either category."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It is what they say it is. A peanut butter beer. But only the first half of the bottle. It really fades off fast and and the mouthfeel falls short of what I think should accompany such a beer. It is certainly something different though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: OK, I admit I got this one for the unusual name and the fact that it contains peanut butter. It smells better than it tastes, but it still tastes good. I like that it's nicely balanced, not too much of any flavor, and still a beer first. Too unusual to be a session beer, but tasty and easy to drink nonetheless."
"Didn't plan on reviewing this until I opened the bottle and got that smell. Here we go. The pour is a dark brown, very thin, whatever small head there was went fast. Seems very carbonated and bubbly. The smell is huge in peanut butter, with chocolate in there, as well. It's smells great. Like a candy bar or dessert. Peanut butter upfront on the taste, not a lot of chocolate, though. A faint hint of bitter chocolate, and a little roastiness. It's very thin and carbonated, just how I expected it to be. There is a bitter aftertaste which isn't my favorite. Overall, a nice beer and a good change if you are looking for something new."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured, it is a normal porter. Good, dark color and nice head. The smell is intoxicating and is truly the best part of this beer. It smells like chocolate and peanut butter with hints of cream and oat. The taste is all over the map for me. I am not necessarily saying it's a bad thing, but from a taste perspective, I feel there is too much too fast in this beer. You have the chocolate, the peanut butter and other flavors fighting for your attention, and they were at times too much. I think this would be a great dessert beer and I won't say I'd never order it again... but it's not at the top of my list."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Looks like a solid porter upon initial pour. Smell is something similar to boutique chocolate and candy shops. Smells incredible - especially if you have a sweet tooth. Sweet milk/cream, peanut butter, chocolate, almonds, Reese's peanut butter cup to be exact. Taste carries over much of the peanut butter chocolate and sweetened milk/cream. Not as great as the nose, but certainly still delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Simple, one-two punch of pb and chocolate. Smooth, tasty, yet not overboard sweet. A nice flavorful drink that features one of my favorite things in the world, peanut butter!"
""
""
"o - i haven't had many peanut butter beers but of the ones i have had this is by far the best."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a dark brown color with a thin tan head that quickly dissipated into a thin ring of bubbles. Big chocolate and peanut butter/nutty flavors throughout both the aroma and taste. This beer reminded me of a peanut butter snack food that I used to eat as I kid, but I just couldn't put my finger on exactly what it was. It was a medium body with some carbonation. Some stickiness lingered on the lips afterwards. Overall, a tasty treat and it was a great surprise as an extra in a trade!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a beer best left for dessert. It tastes like a caramel peanut butter brownie. The peanut butter doesn't seem genuine. It's more like a powdered additive you'd put in pudding. Still, it's definitely interesting. Would go great with a chocolate cake."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not sure I'd want to drink too many of these at a time- despite the reasonable ABV, it's definitely a dessert beer, not a session one. But, I'll DEFINITELY be ordering another one next time I see it on tap."
""
"This is an interesting change of pace beer. At first I was skeptical, but this really pulls off the peanut butter flavor well, and somehow makes it seem like it has always belonged."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Eh, it's a porter that had a lot of promise; cut back by some ineccusable flaws. Doesn't drink good enough to have seconds."
""
""
""
"Can't get past the fake/artificial nut smell and taste that comes with this beer (very similar to that which I get from Pumpking). Very off putting. Little to no chocolate on the nose or tongue. Had high hopes for this one but it wasn't executed well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: if you like peanut butter and chocolate this beer is for you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ends refreshing, with a flavorful nutty and caramel profile, but falls short of the decadence that was promised in the aroma (which is mind-blowing). It's absolutely worth buying just to dip your nostrils into, but overall it's a standard, decent porter that is no different from the rest of the pack. Nevertheless, it still is flavorful and refreshing, and I'd love to try other beers from this brewery - and, next time I get this, I'm going to use it as a baking ingredient!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I love peanut butter so this beer to me is darn good, I am biased on this one, but this is a good tasting beer for sure, subtle and well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - A unique and novel beer. But a unique and novel beer done extremely well. The flavors are intense and natural, the color and look are perfect, and most importantly, it truly lives up to its name. I couldn't resist shouting out its namesake after my first sip. It truly is a wonderful porter, and a must have for any fans of chocolate, peanut butter, and dark beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: On one hand it's a pretty simple porter. Some peanut butter, some chocolate and that's about it. On the other hand, that's what it's supposed to be, and they pulled it off nicely. Very tasty and unique. Well done!"
"Overall, i had to try this and i don't regret it...i wouldn't rush out to get it again but it was definitely a solid pick up. check it out if you haven't!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had a bottle of this delicious-ness fresh and frosty out of a very, very cold fridge while it wore a nice, tall coozy to keep it ice cold. Tastes like melted chocolate ice cream with a peanut butter dip on the outsides edges of your tongue. Brought me back to my childhood at the Soft Serve Ice Cream stand with my first sip in an instant. AWESOME!!! Thanks DuClaw!!!"
"Definitely moved up my list of favorite Porters."
""
""
""
""
"O- Really surprised that this didn't get a higher rating. World class in my opinion. I find no real flaws. Thanks Dad for this awesome desert find."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This doesn't work for me. Not smooth. Not pleasant to drink. Tastes completely artificial. I think it's going to end up being a drain pour. I think I just don't care for anything from this brewery. At least nothing that I can recall."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Fantastic brew... will gladly pick up more of this. It is a bit different of flavoring, but something I could drink every day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the beer tastes good, but doesn't live up to expectations. The initial flavor fades much too rapidly, and lacks complexity overall. Good, but not great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It works as a nice festive treat."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- a unique experience, certainly a sipping beer that would pair well with dessert, or enjoyed alone. I couldn't see drinking it regularly, however."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An interesting novelty but not very well-executed; the peanut butter tasted a little off and the base beer was underwhelming"
""
"Overall: The base beer itself is really pretty mild and unimpressive. This is just a canvass to showcase the chocolate and peanut butter additions. This is more or less a liquid Reeces peanut butter cup. So if that sounds appealing to you, you should pick this up. If not, stay away."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer was delicious. Not sure how many I could have, but definitely a good one every once in a while."
"I can see why this is polarizing. The chocolate and peanut flavors are definitely nice, but the body is kind of weird. Personally, I like it. This is a lot of flavor for a 6.5% beer. It feels a bit light, but it works."
""
""
""
"Recommended to me, so I bought one as part of a mix 6. Pours black as night, but where it really gets interesting is the smell. Massive peanut butter smell. Love it. But hen the taste is mostly chocolate, and the peanut butter takes a back seat. Delicious dessert porter. Still, one at a time is enough. Reese's peanut butter cup as a beer."
""
""
""
"If I'm nit-picking, I'd like it a little less carbonated. That 6-pack I have show be NO problem to finish off."
""
""
""
""
""
"The alcohol was just right in this as I couldn't taste it but it made itself known by the time I polished this off. No doubt that this was unlike any beer that I ever had before and this would be certainly worth a go for any beer aficionado, if only for that reason. it almost reminded me of a Nut Brown Ale but there's enough malt and body here to elevate this to the level of a Porter. This was fun and really enjoyable, even without any desserts to pair it with!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar was a porter, you'd get DuClaw Sweet Baby Jesus. This is a very unique take on the style. Well done. Recommended."
""
""
""
"O - A bit disappointed. It's not bad, but not what I was expecting. Not sure why it tastes so smoky to me. It's pretty sweet, but would be good paired with BBQ, I'd imagine."

"Did not expect too much here, so I was neither disappointed nor surprised. Deep dark pour into a chilled pint glass. Good head, lots of tiny bubbles, and decent lacing. Nose is perhaps the best thing going on here -- more chocolate, toffee, caramel, vanilla, coffee notes than peanut butter. On the palate, the same flavors dominate, although peanut butter does appear. Reminds me a little of the taste you have in your mouth at the end of a baseball game after eating a bag of roasted peanuts (which is also slightly bummer). But the biggest problem with this beer is the absence of character in the mouthfeel -- it's just a little too thin. Nevertheless, glad I tried it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I had this beer a couple of times on tap at Coopers Seafood House in Scranton, PA, and am now doing this review from a growler. The beer is dark, nearly black, with a thin tan head. The aroma is outstanding. Nutty, with lots of chocolate...literally, it is like smelling a chocolate bar with almond and walnuts. Some underlying malt and a little coffee notes contribute to the smell. The taste is slightly sweet, with plenty of balancing bitterness. The nut and chocolate tones continue through the taste. Long and bitter finish. Full in body and somewhat creamy in mouthfeel. Great beer."
""
""
""
"Bottled 11/5/13 -- first real experience with a Porter beer --- tried to keep an open mind. Good body and taste - heavy chocolate smell and felt good in the mouth. Got better and contained much better with stonger flavor over time. Really liked the apperance."
""
"O- A very delicious brew that maybe I am a little partial to since I love Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. This is a little better though as there is enough bitterness to off-set the sweetness. A decent, and unique, representation of an American Porter with a great aroma and flavor, just wish maybe there was a little bit more to it. Not a let down by any means, it delivers on what it says it is."

"Overall, a unique brew, peanut butter flavor is almost too much, but the behind the scenes porter flavors is good."
"Overall - This is a solid brew. It keeps the classic porter characteristics while blending in peanut butter, even if it is obviously artificial. Could be a little smoother and creamier but still worth a shot for its uniqueness."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, many brewery's label there beer this and that like donut or pretzel but it early tastes like it says it should.  Here's a case where it tastes exactly what the label says.  So if you buy a chocolate peanutbutter porter and complain that it tastes sweet and chocolately and peanutbutter then it's your own dumb fault.  It might be a little thin for a beer but it's a very nice dessert beer from time to time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, super unique brew, but something tells me it could be better. Worth a try, still."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well, my dreams of drinking this all day while shoveling Reese's in my face has fallen sadly short. A pretty good beer, but I'd love to see more peanut & chocolate."
"O - Sweet Baby Jesus is unique, do doubt about that, but this flavored porter's taste and finish, while good, show obvious signs it's brewed with artificial flavor. Like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, chocolate-covered peanut filling is abounding and, during most of the beer's consumption, keeps it from really being like a ""beer"". In the end, it's a nicely crafted brew that's one hell of an experience."
"92/100"

"Just not my cup of tea I guess. Props for being different, but I guess I just couldn't get over the in your face peanut butter taste. Smells great, but the coffee / PB hits the palate hard and is not subtle at all...if that is what they were going for....well, job well done. I guess I'd prefer this if it was a little more subtle and not so much in your face. Glad I found this on tap though cause I was looking at the 6er lately and was tempted to buy. Won't be revisiting this one."
"D: This was exactly what you would expect. I would have preferred more delicate and complex, but this was a fun gimmick brew. Easy enough to drink, if you have a sweet tooth."
"Overall- Smell was very nice, but really fell short in the mouthfeel and flavor. Still worth a try for the peanut butter mix, but its just ok for a porter"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is just flat delicious, nothing overly complex or snobby, just as advertised."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"very tasty, one of the best smelling beers I have checked out in some time, the peanut butter flavor is so spot on it is scary, this is worth seeking out for the experience of the PB alone"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The carbonation really kills this thing. The peanut butter aspect is solid, but everything else falls short of the mark. It's a mediocre porter at best and that's the tragedy."

"Overall- 4.25 - This is a great beer. I would definitely drink it again. I don't usually like chocolate in my beers, but when it's mixed with peanut butter and not too much, like Sweet Baby Jesus, it's pretty good. This is my second favorite peanut butter beer so far, next to Spring House Big Gruesome. I would love to try this on tap."
"Exponentially better on tap, but the bottles have some serious peanut aromatics and flavors going on. This was bottled on 1/29/14, guess what it looks ruby cola deep brown, with a nice tan mocha head forming nicely. Fine speckled bands of lacing, great looking beer sitting in my glass. Aromatics are peanut butter to the core, think peanut skins and Jiff. Wonderful smell A+ there's not a better smelling beer around with this much similarity to a Reese's peanut butter cup!!! Flavor is dry finished with the peanut butter/dark dry chocolate notes coming forth, I'm glad it has these flavors without stepping into the dessert beer/diabetes realm like some of the Southern Tier Choklat and CrÃ¨me Brule overt sweetness. There's a natural roasted malt finish with lingering salty peanut notes between sips, man I dig this beer. The first time I had it was a couple months back at Caliente in Bloomfield. Nice to see they are getting distribution in PA at Giant Eagle Market District. Mouthfeel is slick with peanut butter oils and medium bodied with even flowing carbonation it just works, I drained my glass faster than I should but damn it's so good and I thankfully have 5 left!"
""
"Poured on tap into a pint glass. Pours pitch black with a tiny off white head. Smells of chocolate and coffee just beautiful. Tastes of Reese's peanut butter cup, coffee, and nice dark malt. Beer light/medium bodied goes down nice light carbonation. Overall a very good beer."
""
""
""
"Overall an interesting beer. A great fusion of flavors that is not forced upon with artificial flavorings but genuine craft expertise. My only knock is on the mouthfeel, but overall it's enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is rich enough but that aftertaste dominates everything. Not a drain pour, but I certainly will never serve up another one. This is a beer to avoid."

"This is an eye opening beer, the aroma and flavor are delectable, and novelty or not, this just works. Thumbs up on this effort from DuClaw: I'm quite impressed and very pleasantly surprised."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer. It has great flavor and complexity. A little sweetness would be nice though."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-interesting porter, like the peanut flavor and overall pretty enjoyable"
""
"Overall, I pass."
"O - Not bad, a decent novelty this would do much better as an amped up milk stout. Its just too dry and lacking to accentuate the peanut quality to this. Though the aroma is very good, its not as sweet or creamy as I was hoping."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-What a great treat for an ""every once in a while"" beer. Very filling and just enough ABV to enjoy a growler with your wife. A recommended treat trust me!"
"Despite its subtle miscues, and after a dozen or so peanut butter-infused beers, Sweet Baby Jesus pulls off the fusion of taste better than any I have experienced thus far. It's ""smack-yo-deity"" good!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not a bad beer. Dark brown in color with less foamy head than I would have liked. The smell of chocolate and peanut butter is outstanding. The taste - well it's there, it definitely has a cocoa and peanut butter taste. I got no fruitiness or bready taste. It's a good beer, worth trying."
""
""
"moderate carbonation, less creamy than hoped-for"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall-a crime to call this a Porter. Roasted malts are weak, if present at all, no head, watery, artificial taste. If you want a ""crafted"" Porter grab a Samuel Smith Taddy Porter or Founders Porter. This reeks of mass production."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Jet black pour with earthy peanut butter rising from the liquid. I was hoping the taste was going to be as good. Overall, it fell a little short for me. A solid porter, but the chocolate felt a little artificial and the peanut butter flavor wasn't there. Worth the try due to the fact I don't find such beers often, but I probably won't buy this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Delicious. One comment: peanut butter shows up mostly in the aroma, and isn't nearly as present in the taste. Eminently drinkable, as a good porter should be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: A novelty that I won't buy again. Worth trying once though."
"Poured into a tulip. Poured a jet black with a small head that quickly faded. Carbonation was minimal with very small bubbles as one would expect for a stout like this. Notes of toasted cocoa are up front. Very smooth. There is a nice sweetness. First you taste a cocoa, but that fades to the peanut butter. Almost like liquid Reece's. I say god damn! So many people have tried and failed, but this one tastes like a liquid Reece's peanut butter cup and that's amazing. Will add to my regular rotations for sure."
""
""
""
""
"The hops make it very odd, like spelling Pam with an ""n" at the end. Maybe another choice of hops, maybe something more subdued, as you'd use in a Wit to accent banana - clove flavors... And no, I'm not trying to turn this into the fantasy football version of beer ratings, but I agree with most of the reviews, it makes a great novelty, but overwhelms the taste buds quickly, making it hard to take more than one."
""
"M: There isn't much, but the beer seems to have a strange carbonation or other bite near the end, but otherwise, it kind of just dies off with only a mild lingering of a dark-malted beer."
""
""
""
"O- This is an ok beer that simply lacks in the finish. Just pulling back the slightest bit on the roasted nut quality and working to reduce the artificialness of it will definitely put this one at the top of the list. If you are a dark chocolate lover this one is for you. But be warned that it can wear down the palate quickly."
"Very unique flavor: nutty, milky (lactose) but slightly unnatural. However, if you're in the mood for something different, then this is a good bet. I want to call it a ""nutty porter"". I did not experience the large head others described. My draft had a small, quickly dissipating head."
"O - Aside from the stale flavor, this thing is pretty good. Not so much to make me say the name. I think if they changed the malt bill on this it could be great. It has more of a peanut butter flavor that's for sure, but if I had to choose I'd take Big Gruesome over this. Still glad I picked up a six pack though."
""
"Overall is very surprising. I've heard alot about this brew and finally got to have my fill. Good choice."
"Overall considering I paid 5 bucks for the single I am kind of disappointed but am glad to try it. I applaud the effort mostly since it just be hard to really capture that ""candy peanut butter"" taste in a beer. Not worth picking up a second unfortunately."
""
"Bottom Line: Excellent beer!"

"Poured this into a goblet. I have to admit it was only as small bit, so it wasn't a fair pour. I'm deathly allergic to peanut butter, so I was extremely tentative (with meds in hand). Anyway, when I did, it had a coke color with virtually no head and thin lacing. The smell was of nuts, but not peanuts to me, but then again, I don't have the most accurate sense of smell when it comes to peanuts- since I'm usually getting the willies when I smell them. It also smelled like a porter, but I didn't pick up on the chocolate. The taste was nutty. It reminded me of fresh hazelnuts and was pretty tasty. The only hint of chocolate came on the aftertaste. The beer had a thin mouthfeel, but the carbonation made up for it in spades. Would I have it again? You bet."

"O- the smell was amazing and led me to believe i was going to have a resses's cup in beer form (can you say heaven in a glass). I can't say i was disappointed because overall it was a good beer but when you get my hopes up for a reeses and leave me with no resses its hard to save face after that. the beer is good and i would buy it again but not before trying some other things first"
""
"Overall this was my favorite brew of the night. It paired quite nicely with the S'more dessert that Da Boss ordered."
""
""
""
"O: Overall I thought the beer had a nice base to it. The roasted flavor contributed nicely to the cocoa flavor that followed. I would have liked to get more peanut butter flavor out of a beer that advertises it though."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- the aromas were better than the flavor, it had some nice peanut notes but the sweetness overpowered it a bit. Worth a try and would make a good dessert beer, I preferred the taste of Terrapin's Liquid Bliss though"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is done well for what it is. I like the fact that the peanut butter is not in your face yet it is there. As it warms up I am getting more of the peanut butter and enjoying it."

"Poured into a bulbed pint glass straight out of a growler filled at the Arundel Mills location. Color is a translucent cola-black with just a bit of latte foam colored head. Smells of roasty malt, chocolate and peanut shells (not particularly sweet) and maybe a hint of cola/vanilla. Taste is big and bready, with dark chocolate type tannins--no real peanut butter to speak of beyond the nose. Surprisingly crisp finish. Silky, slightly viscous mouthfeel almost like a barleywine with a surprising amount of carbonation. Totally worth checking out, definitely a good gimmick beer to bring to a tailgate, but not a whole lot of replay value here."

"A dessert beer (or gimmick depending on POV) that I had to try b/c I have a sweet tooth. Looks like a great porter with a black body, one finger tan head, some lace and to bastardize I'll say it has an aroma similar to a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup (or any PB cup, to be honest). From there I felt it went down south after that. Smooth, light to medium body that is slightly chewey and bready but quite frankly the peanut butter and chocolate tastes are muddy. It's more like a watered down (with alcohol) peanut butter cup milkshake. I didn't have trouble finishing my pint but I couldn't bother with this again. Also there's a hoppy bitterness and crispness that I wish was more subdued since this is supposed to be a sweet beer, or at least sweeter than your regular beer (even porter)."
""
"O: Take this beer for what it's worth - a gimmick. It accomplishes what it sets out to do and I recommend at least trying it."

"I get why it is so popular (my mom can't get enough of it) but I just couldn't get over the strong peanut butter aftertaste. I think a bit of a stronger chocolate would have balanced it more for me. Color, mouthfeel, and appearance all very good, but smell was very strong peanut butter as well. All in all, still quite good."
""

"Bottoms!"

"O: This is a beer that must be drank in small doses. Fine for splitting with a friend at the end of the night but it really does a number on the palate. Certainly infused with chocolate and peanut butter flavors as advertised but the flavors are somewhat harsh and don't seem as balance as they could be."
"Not bad, nose is definitely better than the taste. Could us a bit more body, but a nice treat in moderation."
"would never try again"

"Purchased in Gettysburg, I haven't yet seen Du Claw beers in the Pittsburgh area."

"Overall it's a real neat novelty beer, but it just doesn't taste that great. It does remind me back in the day of that artificial peanut butter topping I used at an ice cream shop that gets too salty at times. But it is drinkable, needs more of a chocolate angle to balance it out and then you'd have something quite special I think."
""
"OV: I think my employees liked it more than I did, but this beer grew on me with each sip. It's tasty, though I wish the body were a bit heavier. So DuClaw, why aren't you in NJ yet?"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I really liked this beer. Itâ€™s very drinkable on its own, but with food, itâ€™s even better! Deserts are the obvious paring, brownies, etc., and it makes an unbelievable ice cream beer float, but I really liked it with pretzels and other salty snacks."
"This poured a dark brown cola color with a ruby hue around the edges. A great head of loose foam that fell fast to a collar and cap with a thin skin that never faded. Soapy wet lace. The nose is peanuts. Dry roasted peanuts, a little salty. Reminds one of a reeses peanut butter cup. Some milk chocolate comes through as it warms and some dark fruits. No alcohol on the nose. There is a little tiny hint of floral way in back. This has a great malt toasty smell too. Taste is peanuts and more peanuts. Follows the nose all the way. The body of this beer is thinner than you would expect from the smell and not very creamy. Malt is deep and has some toast, roast and unsweetened chocolate to go with all those peanuts. Little hint of vanilla. It finishes dry and with some hop bitter on the back palate and in the aftertaste. The dark fruits are lost to the peanuts but they are there in the background as a touch of earth. There is even a little hay on the palate. Itâ€™s salty like peanuts and warms slightly as you sip it. This was very enjoyable beer. Unique and very smooth. Itâ€™s as though they took your favorite candy bar and made it into a beer."

"Finishes smooth with a soft lingering malty sweetness that is rounded again by.. peanuts. Very good session beer. Not too heavy, but very good."
"O: It is what it is. Don't judge, just drink and enjoy!"
""
""
""
"Verdict: Quite an interesting beer and certainly the best use of peanut butter or peanuts I've ever come across. The nose is really amazing but the rest of the beer falls a bit flat in comparison. Still, a solid choice for a dessert beer."
""
""
"I'm trying to think of any other peanut butter porters/stouts that I've had and the only other one that immediately jumps into my head is Odd Side's Peanut Butter Cup Stout. I like that one a little better; the feel the peanut butter is integrated a bit more successfully, giving off a more authentic ""peanut butter cup"" feel, not to mention the astringency is a non-issue. Either way, this is still a nice peanut butter beer and I'd definitely get it again if it were available to me."
"i understand that extract probably is required to achieve a beer like this, but i could do without its being so obvious. it was as if i were treated to all these amazing flavors and am thinking THIS IS AWESOME! and then a fairy comes by and shoots hair spray into my mouth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - If I can get past the artificial nature of the flavors, it's pretty good. Certainly nothing offensive going on, just not the best."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's unique and drinkable with a smell more enticing than the taste, but wouldn't drink it more than once."
"Wow! Peanut butter in your face on the nose, some head retention. Nice dark brown color. Flavor is like peanut butter extract if there is such a thing. Medium mouth feel not dry but not too sweet. Overall this was my first peanut butter beer that I have ever tried. The finish is like great ice cream. Barely bitter and quite enjoyable.can't wait to have this beer in a bottle that I brought back."
""
"Duclaw at BWI airport, on draft. Pours dark brown with ruby edges, not much head to speak of. Smells like a peanut butter and jelly, with a slight hint of roast in the background and some molasses. A little watery and on the sweet side. Needs some bitter to balance out the sweet. Peanut butter is there, but just not working in this. Similar to CCB Snack Attack buy nowhere close in quality. Nearly cloying and just not very pleasant."

"O: I have previously had a sample of this at a bar when I said I had never had a DuClaw beer. I didn't like it then, and I don't like it now. It smells ok, but it doesn't taste anything like it smells. The reason people buy this is the combination of its interesting name and the idea of having a beer that tastes like chocolate and peanut butter (nutella for the most part). This is my first DuClaw and I live in MD. They have just never attracted me, with their graphic design or reputation. I'll stick to Flying Dog. This got a drain pour, since I was already stocked up on beer bread. I probably could have gone with an even lower score."

"Overall: Neat beer to try. Didn't know beer could smell like Reese's but apparently this one does. It's the main thing it has going for it, and it definitely makes it stand out quite a bit. The flavour isn't quite as strong as the smell but it does follow it somewhat so it's not a purely one-dimensional beer. Worth trying a few times, and definitely recommendable to a fellow beer drinker who has a sweet tooth. Or sweet teeth. Thanks for giving me the chance to try this, Brad! (4)"
""
"O- Not a bad beer but the peanut butter tends to dominate and i feel like i am eating rather than drinking."
"This was a very 1-dimesnional beer that just screamed artificial. I canâ€™t imagine much thought really went into this one. â€“Disappointed..."
""
""
""
"O - Worth a try at least once. Solid porter with a nice twist. DuClaw should consider making this a scented candle, so I can live out my fantasy of having this smell around all day."
""
""
" The taste is good with some light creamy nutty flavors and subtle cocoa tasting with some mild caramel and toasted notes in the porter with some gentle bitterness balancing and mild alcohol. The flavor of the malt is almost biscuit-like in that it has a dry quality, with some oily dry peanut butter taste in the finish. I liked this it was not over the top candy-bar or peanut butter cup flavored, but it is satisfying and does have the taste you might expect given the name, it is a pretty quaffable ale."
""
""
"O - a nice novelty beer and I did enjoy it."
""
""
""
"O: There is a really sound porter here...but the chemical qualities really hurt the quality of the brew. It does taste like advertised, and I can see this one appealing to non-beer drinkers. As a gimmick, it's likable enough where I don't really regret buying a six pack, but not to the point where I'd buy it again."
"There was nothing remarkable about the mouthfeel, though it could have been a little heavier. I think SBJ makes for a great desert beer or nightcap, and definitely hits a nostalgic note for me. Even better, this is the second DuClaw bottle I have tried that finally lived up to the Brewery's name...maybe their distribution standards are catching up with that of their brewery/restaurants."
""
""

"overall - even thought it's gimmicky, a pretty good beer. great desert!"
""
""

"O: While the combination of chocolate and peanut butter is not universally unique, it is unique for beer. I think the balance in the two flavors is excellent, but this unique beer is not one I will drink often."

"O- It's good, but I think it could be better with a little additional sweetness and body."

""
""
"O: This was good, but not my favorite peanut butter beer out there. I actually want more peanut butter in this one. Great beer, won't have an issue putting down a 6er. 3.5"
""
""
"O- I was a little bit disappointed in this brew, it definitely wasn't bad but it wasn't quite as good as I was expecting. Perhaps it might taste a little bit better fresher with the hops being a little bit more prevalent, coffee being stronger, and overall flavors being bolder. Overall a decent beer but probably not something that I'd be seeking out again even if it was fairly easily attainable in my area."
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of peanut butter, some chocolate. Taste is very flavorful. Peanut butter up front, some chocolate next, a hint of bitterness at the finish. Well done. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a quality brew worth seeking out."
"Dark brown-black pour with a monstrously creamy off-white head about three fingers thick; nice retention and blankets of lacing. (Note: this was a keg kicker.) Aroma was pretty much straight up Reese's pie. Not much else to say other than ""yum."" The taste reflected the nose, peanut butter, sweet chocolate, toasted bread, a bit of roast in the finish. The body was the weak point here. It was pretty smooth, but also pretty thin, and that caused the otherwise great taste to weaken after a few sips. It was still a good beer overall, and possibly the best I've had from DuClaw. This would probably be a great nitro beer."
"A dark brown body with a creamy tan head. Some mild spider web lacing left behind as the cap falls to a thin layer. Robust porter notes of dark malts, cocoa, and roast with a layer of peanut butter over top. Strong peanut nose. On the palate, milk chocolate/cocoa rolls over the palate first with medium roast coming through mid palate and peanut butter quickly in tow. The finish is some lingering sweet chocolate, peanut butter, and mild roast. Smooth, creamy feel with low carbonation. A little on the lighter side of medium bodied. I've had a couple of these chocolate/peanut butter beers lately and this is easily the most peanut forward and tasty of the bunch."

"Overall: I totally looked forward to this when it was first advertised and it didn't disappoint in my opinion. It's not one that I would drink all night, but for a starter or a after dinner beer it hits the spot. I make a special trip down from Delaware every few months to try DuClaws brews (hopefully they start shipping to upstate Delaware soon) and they might miss on one or two, but this one was just as advertised and a home run in my opinion!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I have been excited for this one since I first heard Duclaw was planning to release it. The aroma is certainly the highlight here, but the flavor doesn't really disappoint for an experimental-type brew. The peanut butter works pretty well, although I probably wouldn't drink more than one of these in a sitting. I highly recommend trying it so you can judge for yourself. I am happy I picked up a few bottles, but I won't be rushing back to the store for a case."

"Drink- I get what they were trying to accomplish. Tasty little beer, but not being a PB fan, just wasnt for me."

"The beer is brown with ruby highlights. Light tan hued head that measures about an inch. The aroma brings peanut butter, nuts, circus peanuts. Similar flavor with some earthy tones, subtle chocolate. Milk chocolate with peanuts in the finish. Pretty thin in body. Nutty flavors dominate a bit too much. Good in small doses."
""
"Thanks to MillerBuffoon for letting me try one of these. This poured out as a very deep brown color with a brown head on top. The retention is thin, the lacing is scattered. The smell of this beer is loaded with roasted peanuts and dark malts. The taste of the beer is chocolatey with a really good peanut flavor in there too. The mouthfeel of the beer is smooth, kind of light bodied and smooth. Overall this beer was pretty good. It's more of a dessert beer but it's not overwhelmingly sweet. It's interesting though. I like it."

"O-i got so excited when i saw a peanut butter beer, but this was such a let down. the peanut butter was lost in the flavor, which doesn't matter because it was just a terrible porter either way. the flavors are all artificial and there's a lot of off flavor to it."
""
""
"O: I enjoyed this brew â€“ I wouldn't drink more than one in any sitting â€“ but is a good brew."
""
"D - Not my favorite, but I should have known better not being a fan of peanut butter in the first place... Interesting none the less... A true artistic expression from DuClaw..."
""
"Although enticing, I suspect this is naught but extract. I'm reminded of something like DFH's chocolate and peanut butter vodka. Does this really influence the quality of the beer? Yeah, it kinda does."
""
"Overall, DuClaw delivered a pretty solid Peanut Butter Chocolate Porter. My only qualms with this beer was the thin flavor and body which I was really hoping would be more robust. I wouldn't buy this again, but I am glad I got to try it, and I love the packaging and name."
""

"O- Overall a pretty good chocolate PB beer but not the best I have had. Definitely worth a shot if your into this kind of beer, just don't expect the something mind blowing."
""
"Medium carbonation with medium to slightly light body. In keeping with the flavor, the feel is a little watery and overall the beer while a novelty is a bit disappointing. Worth a try but not the delicious peanut butter dessert I'd hoped for."
""
""
""
"The flavor seems to be really lacking on this one. A bit watery."
"O: This is a great dessert beer maybe even one to end the night with, I happened to have a Reese's cup here and I decided to experiment with the flavor characteristics and I was surprised to see it work really well with rather sweet candy. I highly recommend this beer and I believe it will be a great brew offered by DuClaw"

""
""
""
""
"O- I really like this. I prefer Duclaw's darker beers over their lighter ones, and this is no exception. Awesome dessert beer"
""
""
""
""
"T: Thin texture, tastes mostly of peanut butter. Smooth with a bitter aftertaste. No real big hints of any chocolate. Not a bad bad beer at all; definitely unique."
"This is a medium to lighter bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. The aroma really drives home the expected peanut butter and chocolate quality in a very pleasing way. However, the flavor comes up a bit short and in a perplexing way. It has hints of peanut butter and chocolate but the fruity alcohol and hops clash a bit with it. Not bad and worth a try but not the sweet baby jesus reaction I was expecting."
"O- I like it. Different and would try again."
