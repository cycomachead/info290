I can't regularly get this beer which is a damn shame.  Very tasty, too much carbonation and not as much body as I would personally like is what kept this from being a truly outstanding beer in my opinion.  Nonetheless, definitely would buy again if given the opportunity. (3.7)","Grugalug","Aug 29, 2014"

The head is a off white...almost tan colored. Smell is just what you expect of a porter, kind of a caramel, chocolate, creamy smell with a hint of bitterness. Taste is just as it smells. Up front you get a nice milk like taste with chocolate undertones with a touch of bitterness at the finish. Very good brew indeed!","tlennon0815","Jul 07, 2014"

Aromas of chocolate, coffee, toffee, and hazelnut, with roasted characteristics to round out the sweet edges. Flavors are chocolate forward, both milk and bittersweet, with a bolt of bitter roasted coffee, crème highlights, and hints of roast throughout. Very balanced on the palate. A dry, light body keeps the drinkability up. The aftertaste is more of the bittersweet chocolate, and the beer has a smooth, dry finish. Solid porter.","GarthDanielson","Jun 22, 2014"

This Oatmeal porter is delicious and I would highly recommend it to those who love dark, strong beer.","jbridge127","Mar 18, 2014"

So rich and flavourful. The roasted malt really shines without being overly bitter or dry to the point of disgust. It is just right. The punch of oatmeal goes well with it, also adding plenty of flavour potency without hitting that thin line of excess. I haven't had a lot of porters this year, so I don't have a lot of specific flavour notes to assess. I only got one 12 oz bottle of this particular brew. Just trust me, it's awesome.

Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some coffee and some bitter hops in there too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's well carbonated and enjoyable to drink. I thought this was a good brew, I'd buy it again. $1.99 for a single bottle.","bluejacket74","May 18, 2013"

Absolute wondeful smell: Chocolate and coffee mixed with just enough hop scent. Had me drooling when I popped the cap. Very satisfying taste - every scent was present and blended wonderfully. Mouthfeel was a little thinner than I expected but again, the taste and smell more than made up for that.

The mouthfell is alot thinner than i expected, but not bad. Its smooth, slightly creamy. The chocolate notes are on the palate as well as the nose but the coffee notes arent that strong. Its malty. Sweet, but not too sweet. You taste the hops a little. Overall: great brew in my opinion. I give this high praises. For the style, it was great. Wonderful with my meal.

More like a stout than porter. Taste is somwhat distracting with some burnt wood notes. Feel is a bit dry and stout like with some cream at the end. Overall- It's an okay/average beer.

Pours crystal clear dark brown color with a small fairly dense 1 finger light tan head with good retention that reduces to a thin lacing cap. Aromas of caramel, chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, oats, and some spicy hops. Some nice and decently strong aromas here. Taste of big roasted malt, chocolate, oats, spicy hops, and caramel. Nice amount of bitterness present on the finish; with lingering notes of spicy hops, caramel, and chocolate. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly nice and creamy mouthfeel despite slightly high carbonation. Decent balance of flavors as well, but spiciness seems to take the prominence.

The smell is a bit faint, although I do detect some sweetness, almost certainly from the oats. The taste is not as sweet as I'd suspect, however, as I get a lot more roasty (almost smokey or even chalky) malt than oat sweetness.

I might be inclined to get a six pack on a warmer summer day when I want something darker but still light and drinkable, but I don't think it is sold in Michigan so I doubt I will be getting more anytime soon.

The aroma brings malt, lightly roasted. The flavor begins creamy, roasty, and malt forward but takes an unexpected turn with a blast of hop bitterness in the back half. While not entirely unpleasant, I feel that the hop presence is a bit overdone and detracts from the roast, chocolate and oatmeal flavors. Speaking of oatmeal, the presence of oats is rather subtle, and could stand to be brought to the forefront a bit more. Overall, a decent beer and worth a try.","Huhzubendah","Apr 01, 2011"
3.9,0.8,4,4,4,3,4,"Poured dark brown with a slight red tint and had a creamy light brown head that lasted throughout and had excellent lacing. The aroma was robust with roasted chocolate malts, a sweet yeast and had notes of dark chocolate, oats and coffee. It tasted mildly sweet with a nice coffee note at the start and ended with a sweet-bitter chocolate flavor that had a mild coffee undertone and just a hint of hoppiness that stayed with you for a nice while. Mouthfeel was medium to full in body and creamy in texture with a soft carbonation. Overall a extremely good tasting Porter.","KajII","Mar 10, 2011"

Aroma is very straight forward: toasted biscuit, some burnt grain, hint of toffee, and coffee. Rather one dimensional but still good nonetheless. I don't really have much to say about the flavor, aside from it tastes just like how it smells, with a little bit more sweetness than roastiness. Smooth and well carbonated, but not too prickly.

Pretty dark looking, almost black with nice red hue. Aroma is nutty and grainy, some chocolate and a slight bit of coffee with a touch of hops. Has a real malty backbone, nice roasted profile with some nutty characteristics noted, possibly the oatmeal giving it this unique twang. Biscuity malt feel to it, thick on the mouthfeel, nice smooth after taste with a touch of bitterness. Some interesting hoppiness shines through on this one as well, bit of christmas tree pine blends in with the light and dry bakers chocolate flavor nicely. Carbonation is just about right, bit on the high side but it accents the beer well. Nice aftertaste noticed, slightly bitter with a touch of hops.

Aroma is on the light side but consists of milk chocolate, some oatmeal of course and a hint of brown sugar. At first taste my impression is that the beer is too thin, but then I remember to concentrate on the taste. It's much drier than I would have thought. The beer is described to be very malty, but I'm not getting the same impression as it doesn't balance well with the bitterness really. Roasted chocolate on the palate with a touch of bread. Mouthfeel is too thin, but even with the lack of carbonation and balance the beer is one I might pick up once in a while if I'm in the mood for a porter and the choices aren't remarkable.","Macky20","Jan 10, 2011"

It's medium bodied with very tiny carbonation, somewhat silky with a dry charcoal, sweet licorice finish. I don't get much toward the oatmeal idea, mostly tart, tangy ideas.

There's some dark chocolate bitterness, along with a roasted grain character. In all honesty, though, the hops are what dominate the beer, covering up the oatmeal even.As I drink this, and my palate gets used to the hop character, I'm struck by how excellent the roasted grain bitterness is, it's pretty spot on for my palate, strong but not overshadowing everything else. Not as nice as it smells, this beer has a nice finish, dry and roasty with the hop and grainy bitterness working quite harmoniously. A touch overcarbonated, which results in the expected oatmeal smoothness being taken away, this beer is solid. At a relatively low ABV, this is an easy drinking porter, one I'd love to try on cask.

Head appears a finger strong with a nicely tanned color that doesnt retain all that well but clings in patchy lace about the glassware. Nose is a mixture of dark grains that present themselves with notes of coffee and a smokey burnt grain character. Taste has a smokey burnt grain character a bit like coffee, dark chocolate and some of the grainy character comes through a bit sweet before the bitter dark grain finish that has a noticeable amount of alcohol warmth for less than 6%. As it warms, there is some fruity character that comes out in the flavor like dark skinned fruit, a bit like plum or raisins. The nose also includes some dark burnt grain sweetness like molasses with a very faint touch of hops. Medium body is quite smooth and moderately carbonated.

The taste generally follows, with the malts playing a larger role, the chocolate coming through (in a bittersweet way) a bit more, the molasses and sugar floating a bit more into the background, and some oats climbing their way onto the stage. The body is a hefty medium, the carbonation is just right, and, though a bit chewy, the brew flows easily and smoothly across the tongue.

The flavor is similar in the fact that it is very roasted, but not to the overroasted point, which is where I think the sour acidity comes in. Chocolate flavors throughout this one from the malt. The hops are more prevalent thank expected. The history of the porter tells us that the beer originated when train porters would essentially order beer "suicides" that included whatever was on tap--- can't really remember why they thought this was a good idea... anyway, this tastes very much like someone mixed a great stout, and an american IPA... very good porter... the biggest gripe I had with it was that it seemed a bit thinner than I had wanted- especially since it has the added oatmeal.","dolemite77","Jan 11, 2009"

The taste begins with a good chocolate flavor up front, followed by a good amount of roasted malts, and then concluding with a hint of oats. I think it could have used a bit more oats in the taste and nose. Mouthfeel was thick and smooth.

Rather different than most Porters' due to the oatmeal addition which lends a smoothness to the overall flavor profile of the beer. Nice and malty with a dark fruit and caramel quality but also has enough hops to give it a really nice bittering quality as well. Your typical Porter roastiness is rather light but does linger long after the swallow. A very easy beer to drink and since it finishes rather dry and is somewhat light in the body it easy to put a few of these back without a problem or getting board. Would make a pretty decent session beer though it would be on the high end at 5.8% abv. Definitley a beer I would get again if available in my area. Glad I was able to pick some up with on the OBX.

It offers everything that is good in a porter with the uniqueness found in the Oatmeal Stout. Best of both worlds. The beer plops into glass, sounding even rich and malty. The pour delivers a dark brown hue with ruby light emitting. The tan head retention prevents me from pourin the entire contents into my glass. The aromas are a soft chocolate, coffee blend with a mild lactose sweetness and mellowness. The flavors are rich with the same chocolate / coffee notes found in the aroma with a complex, smooth sweetness from the malts / oats blend. A mild coffee bitterness blends nicely with a medium hop balance. The feel is a bit heavy and velvety on the toung and palate. Finishes with a lingering chocolate flavor and coffee bitterness. This beer is very non-offensive, yet offers a lot of variety and intrique. Hats off to Highlands again!","BEERchitect","Jun 20, 2007"

It smells of green hops and chocolate at first, but there are also notes of roasted/coffee malts and, of course, oats. The flavor consists of oats, roasted, chocolate, tobacco, and coffee-flavored malts, with a delicious combination of green/piney/citric hops that leave a medium bitterness, complementing the malts quite well. Initially, the medium body is almost prickly with carbonation, but it becomes smooth, almost silky later, and leaves a medium finish. Overall it comes across almost as an imperial stout light and is a quality beer with a body that is fairly light considering how big and flavorful the brew is.","mmmbeer","Aug 28, 2006"

The coffee notes lead the way, balanced with an oatmeal creaminess. There is a watered bitterness throughout and a coffeeish note trails through the finish. The chocolate is only minimally present. Medium to light body, but lacking any heft, everything is low profile. Minimal carbonation. It felt small. This was a fair to middling porter that lacked distinction.","hopsaplenty","Jun 11, 2006"

Appearance is chocolatey black with ruby tones.The nose immediately picks up the earthy, organic oatey overtones that don't overpower the roasted chocolate malts. Mouthfeel is substantially chewy and smooth thanks to the aforementioned perfect balance of oats and malts. Drinkability is what sets this, and really all Highland beers apart. The heaviness that one may find in many porters is not found here despite the heartiness supplied by the oatmeal. These characteristics add up to one exceptional brew.

Easy drinking stuff that goes down quickly. A solid brew that is very sessionable.","meathookjones","Jul 29, 2005"

3.98,2.8,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Bomber provided by GCBrewingCo. Thanks for the opportunity. Pours a 1/2 finger brown-tan head over a very dark brown liquid. Very dark mohogeny brown when held to light. Nose is chocolatey with a touch of molasses and some alcohol. Some dry rough hoppy, like the middle of a piece of dried out driftwood (freshwater) that's just been cracked open. Taste is mostly chocolate with noticable coffee-ish roast beneath, as well as bitter/sour (perhaps from black patent). There is a rough grassy near the end that's a bit combative, but a re-emergance of the chocolate in a more syrupy tasting form fights it off. The mouthfeel isn't as smooth and creamy as I was expecting, perhaps because the coffee and hop put an edge on the beer. Medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Although the beer leaves my mouth dry, I'm left with enjoyable memories of sweeter chocolate. Not a tremendously complecated beer, but definitely enjoyable.","mentor","Jul 25, 2005"
3.83,-1,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours almost pitch balck, but with some light sneaking around the edges. Thick foamy head that first receded to a cool looking cap, then to a pretty thick film. Nose is a bit of coffee. Taste is a strong kick of coffee beans. Can't really find the oatmeal (that comes through more in the full and heavy mouthfeel). Dark chocolate flavor also leaves a dry feel in the mouth. Little bit smokey. Fairly drinkable, but it would burn my taste sense if I stuck with these all day.","MuddyFeet","Jul 05, 2005"

The taste is somewhat sweet with flavors of oatmeal sweetened with brown sugar (this could be a breakfast beer) as well as some dark roasted coffee flavors that segue nicely into a roast malt/hops bitter finish.

The aromas of this brew are of roasted malts that have a sweet smell to them. Also has aromas of coffee and maybe caramel, possibly where it gets some of its sweet aromas? The taste is very balanced, has a nice roasted taste that is intermingled with both coffee and chocolate highlights. Also has a sweetness that seems to break away to a slight hop taste. This is a very smooth brew; this would be an excellent session brew! Best brew I have had so far on my business trip to NC.","Stimack","Feb 22, 2005"

Dark brown colored beer with a caramel hue. Small cream colored head fades quickly to a ring leaving little spots of lace. The oatmeal was hard to taste in the draft version, but not here. Flavor is mildly sweet with some dark roasted malts, but dominated by that dry ashy oatmeal flavor that produces a slightly bitter finish. Smooth mouthfeel, kind of dry.

The aroma is roasty and sweet with scents of molasses and brown sugar. Very appealing to the nose. The flavor starts with a touch of coffee followed by big roastiness, grainy caramel, toast, and some nice chocolate malt flavors. It's nice and sweet with more molasses and brown sugar notes. This beer is one of those beers where the line between a porter and a stout is blurred. They call it a porter, but it could just have easily been called a stout. Granted it would be just a mediocre stout, but is an excellent porter, the distinction is still slim. Whatever you call it, I call it good.

Aroma is fully of charred, creamy malts, cocoa, a lite coffee note, and a sweetness that I assume is the oats. Taste profile same with more complex malts, molasses/brown sugar, and a mellow, but pronounced fresh hop taste. Roast/toasty aftertaste with a bit of bitterness left on the tongue.

There's also a touch of roasted nuts, and a slightly espresso bite, building not during but after the finish, than fading back into wateriness.

The flavour is well-balanced between the malts and the hop bitterness. Dark malts really shine through, with coffee and chocolate dominating. There's also noticeable bitterness from the dark grains, but without the astringency that oftens accompanies it. The body is quite full, with a silky smoothness from the oats.

This was a pretty smooth beer, as the finish was well rounded, not too sharp or dry. Seemed to be a bit too much carbonation, and it was a little thin I felt. Overall though, this was a good one.

The smell was malty, mixed with some hops, and hints of chocolate. The taste was similar, but was more in the area of chocolate, which is a plus for me. Also, this was one smooth mama jama. It was creamy and oh so smooth on the throat. Bottom line, if you like good beer, you need to drink this.

4.1,5.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Its very deep brown body appears as black in the pint, but reveals deep mahogany highlights along the base of the glass and brilliant glints of ruby through the wide part of the body when held to the light. The short and frothy head of tan foam drops readily, but manages to maintain a full surface covering and leave some spotty lace. A roasty edge, some bittersweet chocolate, and a small bouquet of floral and citrusy hops greet you in the aroma, but fade almost as quickly as the head has dropped. Fortunately, both remain to a certain extent. The body is medium; and it's very fine carbonation leaves it crisp on the tongue before warming to become somewhat creamier and smooth across the palate. The flavor is rich with a distinctly roasted character that lends a bit of acidity before it warms to reveal the bittersweet, dark chocolate and almost-burnt-sugar caramel character beneath. It's well grounded by its solid bitterness, and it finishes dry but with a long-lingering note of dark chocolate that's left in the aftertaste. This is a beer that really needs to be enjoyed at, or just below, cellar temperature - so don't just pull it from the fridge and pour. I'd love to try it in cask form.","NeroFiddled","Dec 07, 2003"

3.65,-5.7,4.5,4.5,3,4,3.5,"Pours a deep chestnut brown topped by a two-finger tan head that displays excelent retention. As it gradually fades, it leaves a thick sheeting on the glass and leaves a thick layer of foam atop the beer. I can smell sweet roasted malt and caramel coming off this beer from two feet away. The caramel notes become more intense as you lift it to your nose, backed by some oatmeal notes and some hops. A bit of chocolate is in the aroma as well. Very nice indeed. The taste is high on roasted grain and coffee, with a bit of bitter cocoa powder mixed in. Good bitternes on the finish, but a bit of a burnt aftertatse. The aroma promises more sweetness, but the beer doesn't deliver, as it is a little on the dry side. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, with perhaps a bit too much harshness from the carbonation. The drinkability is pretty good, as the aroma and mouthfeel make up for the average but enjoyable flavor profile. This has the potential to be a great brew with just a little harmony between what the aroma tells your mouth it will taste and the flavor profile. Just a bit more residual sugar to add a touch of sweetness would make this much more enjoyable. But overall, a fine beer.","aaronh","Apr 11, 2003"

Citrusy hops appear prominently in the taste as well but don't overwhelm, as a host of dark roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate flavors permeate your tastebuds. The mouthfeel is, well, "soft" (I can't think how else to describe it...the brew is not rich enough to call it creamy). A highly quaffable porter, very well done!
