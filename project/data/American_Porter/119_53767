It's appearance is lovely and suitable, a deep oily brown with a 1/4"" tan head of suds siting on top. I found the aroma to be very very sweet and fresh, definitely a pleasant surprise. A vanilla aspect is dominant and there are hints of roasted malts and coffee beans in the background. The flavor itself is filled with creamy, sweetened coffee, toasted grains, and the slightest sweet citrus touch as well. I'm impressed in regards to the coffee flavor - how it comes through and the quality of it. This is a very balanced beverage, it has a light and silky mouthfeel, and is the perfect summer libation for those who shun the season's typical choices.","Neorebel","Jun 06, 2014"

The aroma hits upfront with coffee but is quickly balanced by a creamy, slightly sweet vanilla scent that nicely tones down the bitterness of the coffee. Maybe a slight hint of chocolate in there too. The taste essentially echoes the aroma note for note, maybe just a tad more coffee in the taste though.

The thickness is about right, the coffee and chocolate are well balanced, and there is very little that is unpleasant. That said, it could do for more carbonation and maybe just a little more character... parts of the flavor profile just felt empty.","jdhowe","Jan 29, 2014"

I am fairly new to exploring craft beers . This is definitely one of the best I have tried so far. Aroma is amazing almost like being in a coffee shop. I am not a big coffee drinker so if anything I could find fault in is the strength of the coffee taste. It is balanced well with the sweetness of the chocolate and vanilla. Maybe a little less on the coffee and I would say for sure this would have been my favorite to date. Also this is an organic beer for all of those interested.","Jamey61","Jan 19, 2014"

The flavors themselves are fairly nicely balanced, but the beer as a whole seems like it needed to be better balanced from start to finish, with more oomph put in to maintain flavors over time, and a few more sugars to increase the molasses and caramel notes. The coffee notes could have also been more fresh, like the lovely oily notes that come from beans fresh out of the roaster. In all, some very nice points here, but nothing extremely eye-opening or catchy.","jondeelee","Feb 05, 2013"

3.95,0.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall  - This is a very nice porter, it walks the line between a stout and a porter with an nice maltiness and hop kick that make it clearly a Porter. The coffee is clearly the star of the beer, and Wolaver's has done a very nice job mixing the heavy, strong and bitter coffee with a maltiness and subtle sweetness that makes this enjoyable, drinkable and complex. Clearly seek to find this in bottles, or better yet on tap or in a growler fill.","Chas58","Jan 01, 2013"

Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head. Head retention is very good, and there's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, it smells mostly like coffee and roasted malt, along with some bittersweet chocolate and vanilla. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but the coffee flavor is more of a sweet roasted flavor (because of the vanilla) than a bitter roasty one. I like it because the coffee is definitely noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, but I think it fits the style well since it's a porter and not a stronger stout. It's also very smooth and goes down easy enough. $8.99 a 6-pack? Yeah, I'll be buying this again.","bluejacket74","Nov 16, 2012"

Coffee roast upfront in the nose, followed by some mildly sweet dark chocolate and just a whiff of vanilla and hops. Increased vanilla bean comes through in the flavor melding pretty well with a creamy coffee sweetness. Some fruitiness lingers after each sip. The coffee reasserts itself after a few sips and comes with a light chocolaty roast. Medium bodied...nothing really notable, but nothing wrong. Overall, just a pleasant organic porter geared towards coffee lovers.","wedge","Nov 26, 2011"

The liquid on the whole is black with a slash of reddish orange at the glass bottom. The coffee is obvious from the first sniff, more of a roasted bean quality with a light bitterness, only a splash of milk, cream or vanilla, same for caramel, butterscotch and grilled nuts, strong undercurrent of green grasses, while obviously focused on the coffee does not come across as unbalanced or unnecessarily aggressive. Medium to full-bodied, the dry mouth texture helps it stay refreshing and actually speeds it up rather than slow it down as it moves through the palate. The dark roasted coffee bean element decisive with an oily character and smoky perfume. The vanilla bean lacks the power to sweeten the pot, stays in the background with the honey and caramel. The carbonation does not seem weak yet just manages a steady lowkey prickle. No distinct fruit nor citrus flavors although there’s a sense of the latter. Same hoppy green notes with maybe a smidgeon of pine. Offers a mineral water note to cleanse the finish. High quality coffee intensity here.","farrago","May 01, 2011"

The mouth feel is of a full body porter and a bit of overpowering sweetness, but I probably shouldn’t have eaten this with dinner, but with dessert. There is no hint of alcohol when drinking and the taste is very balanced. My only complaint would be it might be a little to on the sweet side.

It smells like just strait up coffee, I maybe pick up a faint hint of vanilla as well, but not much, it's pretty much just all coffee on the nose. Taste is pretty disappointing, I was looking for a very robust mouthfeel and full taste, but I am not getting that. This beer basically tastes like generic beer mixed with coffee, it doesn't even really taste like a porter mixed with coffee, rather just a generic ale or lager. There are not enough malts or other interesting flavors for me to consider this a porter, and the mouthfeel is way too thin for it too be a porter, it feels more like a pilsner. With all that being said - it still isn't a bad beer, it is very tasty, just not at all what it could be.

Nearly nothing but, and, I know, I'm shocked, coffee up front: roasted and dark. My kind of chicken. Hell, it may just be my sad excuse for a nose, but I'm gettin' nothin' but the roasted dark. Na ja. This coffee-ness is nicely subdued a bit once the mouth is involved. Don't get me wrong, it's still there in all its bean-founded glory. It's just that now its solitude is shattered by visits from bitter chocolate and almond. The Hersheys, though, don't stay long, and the coffe once again finds itself alone in that big ol' house.

Coffee is pretty powerful in the flavor too, lending some astringency to the flavor, with notes of vanilla toward the finish. Dark chocolate and nut struggle to be noticed in this coffee bomb. Light to medium in body with moderate carbonation. The roasty coffee tends to make this a bit on the astringent side, hurting the drinkability. If you're a big coffee fan, this is for you.
