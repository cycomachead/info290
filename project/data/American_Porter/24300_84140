4,-4.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of the style, I've had a few Imperial Porters and I've found the thing that sets it apart from an imperial stout is mainly more of a dark fruit presence and this beer for sure had that which made it fall right inline with the style in my opinion.  This beer has ok drinkability, it's a little smooth, a little boozy, a little warming, not too crisp, sticky, a little filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, but I think one would be my limit, anymore than that and I think the sweetness and booze would start to wear on me.  What I like the most about this beer was how balanced the taste was, no aspect got too overpowering.  What I like the least about this beer was how well the booze was hidden, I think it could have been hidden just a little batter.  I would buy this beer again and I would love to throw a couple in the cellar to see how it ages.  I would recommend this beer, especially if you like big and strong dark beers.  All in all I was happy with this beer, it turned it pretty much how I expected and in the end I enjoyed sipping on it.  This is one of the better Evil Twin beers I've had and it's also one of the better Imperial Porters I've had.  Good job guys this this was a tasty beer, keep up the hard work.","StoutHunter","Mar 07, 2015"

Pours dense pitch black color with a small dense dark brown head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, fudge, toast, molasses, raisin, prune, licorice, dark bread, light smoke/char, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt and moderate dark fruit notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, fudge, toast, molasses, raisin, prune, licorice, dark bread, light smoke/char, and roasted earthiness. Moderate amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, molasses, raisin, prune, licorice, dark bread, light smoke/char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts and moderate dark fruit flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, moderately slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial porter. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts and moderate dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 01, 2014"

I've never given a beer a "5" rating because I always want to leave room for improvement. This is the closest thing to a perfect beer I have come across in my travels. Outstanding by any means.

Kind of like when two attractive people pop out a few good looking kids. All the best from both gene pools. Dark and smooth going down. Coffee up front on the taste. The alcohol takes second to hit you in the taste. Super great beer. Can't believe it is 11.5%.","Brackh","0"

Might try to pick some up to stick in the cellar and see what some time does to that warmth.  Maybe a little smoothing would make it perfect....  We'll see.

4.07,-2.6,,,,,,"12 oz. bottle poured into a mug. Very dark brown grading into black, with a light dappling of mocha brown head. Aroma is decidedly roasted, black coffee and light smoke with some sweeter toffee and raisin overtones, even a hint of orchard fruit and tangy English hops. Palate is equal parts roast and sweet, dark chocolate and day old black coffee, brittle toffee, rum-soaked raisins, brown bread, a hint of caraway, and a rather pleasing floral alcohol warmth. Low carbonation and quite viscous, heavy ... Finishes bitter and a tad medicinal, vague hop echoes and that same astringent taste that lingers for a while after your morning coffee. Minimal ash. This is hearty fare indeed, well-crafted and smooth sailing despite the potent flavors involved. I get why this brew is used as the base for things like Imperial Biscotti Break and the like. I think it stands up very well in an unadulterated form.","CalgaryFMC","Aug 18, 2014"

4.04,-3.3,4.25,4,4,4.25,4,"I had heard great things about this beer and; while it is good, I was somewhat dissappointed. This porter pours a deep black with a short lived tan head that leaves beautiful lacing. The aroma is typical coffee, chocolate, vanilla, licorice, and booze. But there is something off about the smell. I can't put my finger on it but it seems forced and artificial. The flavor carries the same notes both good and bad. It is very nice and much more imperial stout than porter, but that fake off note still is present plus a slightly metallic aftertaste in finish. This is good but just not quite as good as I had heard or as I wanted it to be.","lochef81","Apr 27, 2014"

Smell is of dark roasted malt, smoke, cocoa, vanilla, oatmeal raisin cookie dough, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa, char, soy sauce, and metallic flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

The mouthfeel also pairs incredibly well with the flavors and makes for a milk-shake-like experience. Alcohol is well-concealed, and the brew sips beautifully.

4.06,-2.9,4,4.25,4,4,4,"The beer pours like dark roast coffee, oozing between a deep brown and a black coloring. It pours with a tiny head of miniscule, dark khaki bubbles (as is expected at this ABV), which quickly slicks into a scrim ring along the glass. The beer leaves a super slick, thin curtain of lacing when it washes over the glass, along with a small set of legs to suggest its alcohol content. In body, the beer is too dark to penetrate, but as it pours it does not seem to be the thickest thing to ever come out of a bottle… On the nose, the beer smells richly fruity with dark plum, raisin, and chocolate notes. Brown sugar and dates also appear on the nose, along with the ghost of fusel alcohol. The smell is richly fruity both in malt and yeast character, blending with slight nutty smells. Roast coffee is also present, but it is sitting beside a very pungent raisin/date/plum dipped in brown sugar and chocolate. On the tongue, the beer tastes richly sweet at first, almost cloying with definite alcohol notes, but this perfectly melds into a dry, lightly bitter roast as the beer finishes. There is a light, tart pop at the back of the finish, which adds a level of complexity that I did not expect from this beer. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet plums dipped in a light chocolate. Faint raisins and brown sugar dance on the tongue after the initial flavor, but they are buoyed along by cloying, sweet alcohol that takes a little away from the beer. Luckily, this alcohol is very brief, and is bludgeoned aside by beautiful, dry, French roast coffee. A touch of vanilla and cinnamon, also, bring light spice to the tongue, perhaps from the alcohol, just as the coffee flavor moves in. The finish is light, but long and gives hints of praline, pecans and milk chocolate. In the mouth, this beer feels silky smooth and on the heavy side of medium in body. Carbonation is smooth and velvety, blanketing the tongue in oozing goodness. The mouth is left roasted dry and slightly sticky. Overall, this is a beautifully complex and rich porter. Its thinner mouthfeel and silkiness definitely lend it to the porter style, and not to the thick and chewy stouts, but it works beautifully. This beer is not revolutionary, nor is it even that weird in today’s beer world, but it is well crafted and richly nuanced. I think it could do with a little aging to smooth out the cloying alcohol in the middle of the sip, but I still think it’s great to drink now.","Maxwell","Sep 03, 2013"

4.2,0.5,4,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Pours black. Quite black. Tiny bit of brown at the edges but this beer is dark. A nice brown head puffed up at first, but it faded after a couple minutes, leaving behind some scummy-looking lacing. The aroma is sweet caramel and cocoa and a lightly acidic roast edge. There's also a healthy dose of vanilla, dates and a touch of soy, which probably grows as the beer ages. Taste is sweet with lots of toasty malt flavors. Vanilla stands out. The sweetness starts out with light caramel and gets darker and darker. Big chocolate fading into coffee and roast at the end. Toffee, sherry, molasses, mild smoke. It's a little bland upfront, but malt complexity comes out as the beer progresses. Letting the beer warm up helps a lot, too. The aftertaste is chocolate, sherry, Bailey's, smoke and roasted coffee. The mouthfeel is thick and smooth. This beer isn't quite as refined as the Jesus series, but it's a dead solid imperial porter with a great mouthfeel and lots of good flavor for a pretty cheap price. Evil Twin is ridiculously good at making imperial porters/stouts.","popery","Jun 23, 2013"

This smells, tastes, and feels like an imperial stout. It certainly has the ABV for it. It smells very nice and tastes good, but drinkability suffers with the high ABV and strong throat-warmth. I’ve heard that this is the base beer for (Imperial) Biscotti Break and I’ll tell you, I much prefer this. It is not cloying at all and has more roasted character.

The ABV is completely undetectable, which is amazing. Heavy bodied and decent mouth feel, but I couldn't help but think how superb this would have been with some active carbonation.

Feel medium-heavy with little carbonation. All in all, it's got some taste, but I can't help comparing it to this year's Black Butte XXIV and favoring that one. This isn't quite as good and costs more. However, this one isn't a one-and-done brew, so there's that.","TheRealBigC","Oct 08, 2012"

Taste is so smooth boozey dark fruit, chocolatey bourbon vanilla, slight coffee as well. This is just so crazy good and it gets better as it warms...wow. Slightly bitter mouthfeel, which I dig, nonetheless a spectacular amazing brew. Go have one now!","DrinkSlurm","Sep 27, 2012"

This is the second time I've tried it, once on tap and once out of the bottle and neither time was I overly impressed, I am not a huge fan of dark fruit and. Deffinatly do not expect to find them in my porter wether it be imperial or not, I felt this could have been good with much more coffee and roastyness.

4.44,6.2,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: Wow, unexpectedly good. Especially for my first Evil Twin beer. One of the best imperial porters I've ever had, if not THE best. Strong fruitiness and milder roasted malt (though there is still plenty at 11.5% ABV) keeps this firmly in porter territory and doesn't cross over into imperial stout-dom. Wonderfully fruity, smooth and creamy. Balanced flavor. An expertly crafted brew in my opinion.","Dope","Sep 25, 2012"

4.22,1,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"O: Overall, this is a really good beer.  Honestly, my expectations were through the roof, as my last couple of Evil Twin beers were just spectacular.  Ive heard this is the "base beer" to Imperial Biscotti.  Im not exactly sure what that means, and dont know if its true or not.  There are definitely similarities, but there are differences as well.  It doesnt live up to IBB, but then again most nothing does as thats one of my favorite beers, but this one is very good in its own right.  My limited experience with Imperial/Baltic Porters has me rating them as if they were IS's, which may not be fair.  Either way, certainly an enjoyable beer, that I recommend and gladly would drink again.  I wont be running to the store to buy up the rest of the supply like I did for Imperial Biscotti though.  ","zac16125","Sep 17, 2012"

4.39,5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"With its extended finish of milk chocolate, vanilla, and fruit, the beer continues to reward the palate with the same satisfaction as fine brandy or cognac, in place of after dinner dessert. With beers like Lil' B, Evil Twin continues to remind me why it's alright to pay such exorbitant prices for their beers- they are simply worth it.","BEERchitect","Sep 15, 2012"
5,19.6,5,5,5,5,5,"The best porter I’ve ever tasted, hands down. I’m not usually a big fan of Baltic style porters, only because I find them to be too sweet, but this Imperial version is deceptively complex. At first, I thought it was a bit flabby in texture, and totally straightforward in flavor. However, as I continued to sip this voluptuous monster, flavors other than chocolate, toffee, and vanilla began to emerge...leather, tobacco, plum, kumquat, raisin, sandalwood, smoke, Cabernet, and bourbon began to poke out their heads, seemingly out of nowhere. The richness continued to build, but the sweetness never became overbearing, and leveled out at just the right point. This may be the best Evil Twin I’ve tasted, which is even more surprising when one takes note of the fact that it’s a contract brew executed by Westbrook Brewing Co of Mount Pleasant, S.C. I’d never heard of them, but I’ll definitely be looking for any future nationally distributed beers of theirs.","Impfan","Sep 14, 2012"

4.47,6.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Because MSquared2 told me to tick Evil Twin brews this night… Served from bottle into a Mikkeller Teku (semi-proper!). Poured pitch black with a one finger brown head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, bread, milk chocolate, sweet alcohol, vanilla, and very subtle coffee. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, bread, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, vanilla, sweet alcohol, and coffee. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was fairly great brew. Where did this one come from!? Wow… Everything going on in this one was nothing short of fantastic and made it quite easy to drink despite the ABV going on here. The flavors and aromas going on here are nothing short of excellent as they are all on-point. This is definitely a really well done brew. If you have not had the pleasure of enjoying this one, you need to make it happen. Nicely done guys!","thagr81us","Sep 12, 2012"
