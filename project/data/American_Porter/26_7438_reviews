"I really enjoyed this. It wasn't overly hoppy so you get to really enjoy the malty chocolate coffee flavor it has to offer."

"Great beer by 3 floyds! Definitely would recommend trying it if you are able to grab one! Cheers!"

"On tap at FFF brewpub poured into a half pint. Appearance is very dark brown with little light coming through. A stiff tan head stands an inch over the beer. It clings tightly to the glass in patches as the session goes on and Finding Nemo flashes on the screens in the pub. Aroma is pine, cocoa, roasted malt, and the slightest bit of orange peel. Quite hoppy for a porter. Taste is initially bitter with spruce and anise. Then the essence of one of those chocolate-wrapped oranges from Christmastime slides in. Roasty and charred notes on the swallow. Medium body, creamy, but thinner than it looks, moderate carbonation, semi-dry finish."

"Overall, Alpha Klaus sure has some hidden smokiness up its sleeves.  At first you don’t really get it.  Things remain all about the hops, and the balancing sweetness of your nicely warming base porter, which is superb.  Once temperatures start to rise, however, is when the grain begins to show its true form.  This particular component is more true through the taste, but in the nose, the hops enhance even further, taking center stage.  These hops show off just enough evergreen hoppiness to keep things decidedly in the Xmas spirit.  Speaking stylistically, this is a wonderful, true hybrid.  It has all of the amazing hoppiness and oily bite of your best black ales or black IPAs, but with a much, much greater and tastier base porter to build off of."
"A bit smoky? Probably just picking up smething in the malt base, but it adds a certain element."
""
"Overall - This makes me long for Xocoveza and/or Belching Beaver Horchata Imp Stout.  This beer is no match for either of those, but it is pretty good.  Should I be comparing them to those two beers?  Of course."
"Very drinkable beer, but seems to me like it's just missing something I was hoping for. I would probably buy it again if I ran into it on the shelf, but probabaly not one I'd seek out in the future."

"another hit from 3F. had this with beef Wellington on Christmas Eve. If I could give it a 5.25 for smell and feel I would, very good. Sleigh bells!"
""
""
"A real nice seasonal porter, excellent brew, maybe not one I am going to fall seriously in love with, but one I would make part of my holiday tradition, and one I will remember for sure."
"This was a pleasant departure from the normal assortment of porters that are out there. I picked up hops and Christmas spices on the nose.   This is really the first beer I've had where the hop presence was in the taste, but not in a dominating(unpleasant for me) manner.  Overall a good beer, would have again."
""
"O - 4.25 - A very unique and good porter. Is unlike any other I've tasted and is recommended to fans of the style looking for something a little different from the beaten path."

"One of the greatest winter warmers in the market! A robust porter with a festive flavor. It is a malty beer with a west coast hop slam. A beautiful bitter dark chocolate mixed in with dark roasted coffee. A little hint of spices."
"Creamy, roasted, smooth. Super solid porter."

"The stuff tasted like it had something off in it.  My buddy said it tasted like it had weed in the batch."

"Never get sick of this one, and look forward to it every year. I would drink all year around as a treat when I can't decide between dark and hoppy. Booya."

"I really enjoyed this brew. Heavy look, but not quite as heavy a taste (of course that depends on your definition of heavy), but extremely tasty and smooth. Very good holiday porter. Looks as smooth as it tastes. Unfortunately, with a bit of a cold, I cannot give any good smell descriptions as I basically have none. But I truly enjoyed this beer."

"O. I'm loving this beer. Nice roasted malt and chocolate both in the nose and on the palate. Looks beautiful. Finishes nice and clean. Isn't two thick. It's pretty close to perfect for a Christmas beer but for me anytime."
""
"Overall: A good beer overall, but not really my idea of a porter. I also don't understand the Christmas connection with this one, but maybe it fits with 3 Floyds' motto of ""It's Not Normal."" This one is definitely worth trying."

"Pours a dark opaque brown with 2 fingers of loose foam of khaki colour. Sweet, hoppy, lemon nose. Chocolate, mocha, with orange back tones. I got a bit of leather in the back also.  Delicious for a porter!"

"This is definitely a nice porter, but the combination of roast and hoppiness could be a little better. Definitely good, but not the best from Three Floyds (which isn't much of a criticism)."
"Hoppy with enough malt to be interesting. Well played Christmas beer."
"The taste is intruiging... porter with lots of hops. The hops give it a sharp note on the end, but not in a bad way."

"This is to porters what St. Bernardus Xmas Ale is to quads. Gets a good base beer and fills it with a fun, jubilant hop profile and array of spices that makes this become the much needed holiday treat, at the end of the day. By far one of my favorite seasonal releases from FFF, and I hope to get this every year for the holidays as long as I can."

""

""

"Overall one of the better Xmas style beers out there. Not too heavy on the spices, nor cloyingly sweet or alcoholic. Perhaps a bit out there for a Porter, but it is FFF after all."
""
""
""
""
"O- The hops certainly made this one interesting, very danky, almost weed-like. It overpowered the base porter a bit, worth a try but not something I'd go back to"

"O: A hoppy version of a porter with the a mix of traditional and some interesting new world hop flavors. Not my favorite, but it's worth a shot if you come across it."
"O- Really good. Love the feel, and lots of flavor. They hopped this very well, too. You know they're in there, but they aren't overbearing."
""
""
""
""
"Initial sniff reveals chocolate and hops. This was hoppier than expected. I got grapefruit and tropical fruit as I was attempting to discern the hop aromas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. This beer means it's time for the holidays and can be nostalgic. It's certainly well crafted and is a must try for hop heads."
"Overall: A really unique brew from FFF. Have to look forward to them putting their own twist on traditional beer styles. I enjoyed this one but wouldn't go out of my way for it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Taste is exquisite, too. Dark bittersweet chocolate and berries and a bitter finish. I even get note of mole sauce among the deep chocolate underbelly (not a bad thing in my book). Thick bodied and filling, this is a remarkable, complex, and standout beer."
""
""
"O- like much of the FFF line up the aroma is great. The pine with chocolate flavors give it a Christmas feel. Will seek this out again."

"O - Overall, this was not what I was expecting at all. Its definitely not your average porter, and its much more smokey than your run of the mill black IPA. A pleasant surprise."
""
"Pours out black as night with a e finger beige head with good retention and some nice lacing as the head goes down Smell is brown sugar, dark fruits , a little toffee, and a little dark malts. Taste is dark malts, the dark sugar, and a little bittering hops at the end that seems to stay in the mouth and not in the throat. Mouthfeel is a little thin for the style and should be a little thicker for the style. Overall this is great beer but could be a little thicker and more complex,"
"I recommend that this Porter recipe be indoctrinated into the year round offerings by 3Fs. It is a solid ""run of the mill"" Porter....nothing fancy...just outstanding. The beer poured an opaque dark with ecru head that left a nice laceing. The scent was subtle earth and peat...did not get much hops. The taste was a wonderful, what I would call, standard porter. There was subtle hints of earth/peat and a very faint touch of pepper. The mouthfeel was medium in body and very creamy....there was smooth carbonation. Overall....the best nonchalant porter I have ever had!"

"Great American Porter that drinks much more like a Black IPA, rich, malty and hoppy. Has a great feel for 6% Light spice. Although it's really good/almost great. Doesn't set itself apart from a 'subliminally self-righteous' worth grabbing if you see it. That said, I wouldn't seek it out specifically~"
""
""

"Nitro was GREAT 4.25... Bottled was very good 3.75 maybe.   So we're downgrading it to a 4."
""
""
""
"Overall: A very solid dark brew. Its more like a black ale than porter. A nice combination of roast and spicy hops."

"Bottle from Rebekah as part of an awesome FFF box. Thanks again! Pours nearly black with a super creamy two finger mocha colored head. Big hop aroma that I wasn't expecting. Pine galore, some lemon, some roast, chocolate, and big sweet sugar. Big chocolate and hop mixture in flavor. Lots of bitterness and pine, some sweet chocolate, then a bit of buttering roasted malts. Medium bodied, pretty smooth, with medium plus carbonation. Very drinkable. Dry finish. I was not expecting this at all, and for some reason was thinking this would be a big sweet chocolate dessert. I like it though, and it is a big hoppy porter bordering on black IPA. Glad I finally got my hands on this one."

"O - If you are looking for the kind of friendly spice and roasted goodness you might expect from an Xmas Porter, you will not find it here. Not that that is a bad thing. This beer was extraordinary. I would not have expected the citrus to live so well with the roasted notes. Unfortunately, I think the hops is a touch out of balance, eclipsing some of the other notes."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a very unique porter, which I definitely enjoyed. I haven't had a porter with such a hop presence, guess it's to be expected from FFF. I will probably pick this up on a yearly basis."
""
"Another solid offering from three Floyd's."
""
""
"Overall this was a decent porter. There were lots of good typical porter flavors however the hops overpowered the brew and potentially hid some awesome complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I think this is a great beer. I wasn't sure what to expect, but it certainly made me wanting more. I will be picking more of this up to set back."

"Interesting combo of less-popular hops and chocolate/malt/coffee roast. The mint and pine notes really hit home on a nice porter base to make this a non-traditional seasonal. The bitterness is just a touch too much for me."
"This is very similar to Avery New World Porter.. just saying.."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Very hoppy and big for a porter, and I wouldn't expect anything less from FFF. This is one of the best FFF beers, and that puts it pretty high up there in the market place."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Solid porter full of roast and burnt/charred malt character. Dry overall, rather tart, lightly fruity. Enjoyable on this cold fall night."

"O- very unique brew. this beer drinks very easily, the hops leave your tongue bitter but the porter coats it at the same time, very interesting, very good. I prefer a happier beer, and this is a nice change from the over-spiced Christmas dark ales that tend to be the standard. This is a great holiday beer, it's just done the FFF way, lots of delicious hops!"

"22 ounce bottle into signature Teku tulip; November 2012 release. Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger fairly dense dark tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, grapefruit, pine, orange zest, floral, cocoa, caramel, coffee, light char, and piney spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great balance of hop and dark roasted malt notes. Taste of dark chocolate, roasted malt, grapefruit, pine, floral, char, coffee, caramel, and roasted earthiness. Good amount of roasted pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, pine, citrus, floral, char, coffee, caramel, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance and complexity of very dark malty flavors with citrus/pine hops; with a great malt/bitterness balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very creamy, sticky, fairly crisp, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. I know this is labeled as a porter; but in my view, this is an absolutely fantastic Black IPA! Big balance and complexity of dark malt and citrus/pine hop flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on. An extremely awesome offering!"

"O: A fairly run-of-the-mill porter. I don't find the spices adding much, but at least they aren't overdone. I was rather worried about the initial off-flavors, but that seems to be remedied by letting the beer warm for 15 minutes."
""
"A nice offering from FFF. This is not a beer I would buy again as porters don't come high on my list but I don't regret buying it."

"Taste: Well it seems like there are a lot of things going on in this. There is a slight fruity taste at first that goes into a hoppy bitterness that then goes into a sweet maltiness that finishes off with the roasted coffee type bitterness. The hoppy bitterness does remain afterwards too."

"A solid hopped-up porter that reminds a little bit of Cigar City Jose Marti. It borders American black ale territory but that roastyness dominates first and foremost. Not the strongest entry I've had from Three Floyds but worth a go if you have the chance."

"Amazing that I haven't reviewed this brew yet! Pours the darkest brown possible, bordering on black, capped with a very light beige two and a half finger fluffy head. Great retention and significant lacing present. Bakers chocolate, general roastiness, burnt sugar, and grapefruit rind on the nose. This is a beer whose taste closely follows the nose: roasted malt, light espresso notes, dark/bakers chocolate, and burnt caramel and sugar. The hops make their presence well-known toward the very dry finish in the form of grapefruit rind and spruce-like bitterness. Medium bodied, well carbonated, and slick and a bit oily. A very unique porter and one that I welcome every year around the holidays."

"a dark brown pour with a full half inch tan head throughout the full pour. smells of grassy hops, cocoa, roasted grains. nicely hopped for a porter. the flavor is a bit smoky, with notes of coffee, chocolate. medium body, nicely carbonated with a chalky finish. overall this is a damn excellent porter. very nicely hopped making it an interesting take on the style."

"Three Floyds Alpha Klaus ---4/5."
"Pours an opaque black color with a caramelized creme brûlée colored foamy head. The head forms quickly and largely. Some semblance of head lingers throughout the beer. Lacing and spider webbing coat the glass from top to bottom. Late summer mown grass, coffee, and roastiness on the nose. Moutfheel is thick and slick, but dries out a little at the finish. Perfectly balanced roasted malt and resinous hops. It fills the mouth with flavor. Grassy hop flavor blending well with large roasted malt. This is a magnificent beer with a lot of balance. I've missed it so much."

"O - a treat for a Holiday beer. have had it fresh and aged, prefer it on the fresher side. nice bottle to share over the Holidays!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is not your typical Porter (which Three Floyds points out on the bottle), but I'm not a huge fan of it. I would like a little sweetness to balance out all the bitter notes and the coffee and chocolate notes could be more pronounced. It's an interesting beer, but not great."
"Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium intensity. This leads to a slightly prickly, fizzy mouthfeel at first, which then fades to a marginally foamy, generally smooth mouthfeel for the remainder of the sip. Ethanol can be felt flashing across the throat, or upon the tongue (if held there). Closes dry, with fairly substantial stickiness across the palate."
"O - the thing with FFF is you know when you have one of their brews. Idk if it's their yeast strain or the water they use, but every one of their brews has that 3 Floyds flavor character to it. This is not only one of the best Porters you'll ever have its also one of the best Christmas seasonal beers you'll ever have. Putting 2 n 2 together make for the worlds finest Christmas porter. Period. This will never leave my 12 beers of Christmas list. It's just a thoroughbred porter. I'm a huge fan of holiday brews and of American porters, so this one is just a winner all the way around this time of year. It's a must try for porter and holiday beer fans alike. I am starting to sit and think of what brewery does absolutely everything right in terms of the family of beers they happen to offer, and the crew at FFF are at the forefront of that topic every single time. It's remarkable and so is Alpha Klaus."
""
"O - Apparently a porter really works well when its hopped up. Light enough to be drinkable with plenty of chocolaty coffee goodness to balance out that distinctive FFF hop profile."
"Overall: This beer blurs the line between a black IPA and a porter. I actually really enjoy it, and the hoppyness is exactly what I should have expected from Three Floyds."
"O: Good hoiday brew. No unnecessary spices, just good brewing with good ingredients. Would happily drink again."
"This pours a very dark brown color with a fluffy light brown head. There is a mild scent of roasted malts to the beer but even stronger is the scent of hops. The taste is uniquely robust yet hoppy. Initially there is a complex, robust sweetness which gradually grows into a crisp, bitter taste. Very different and very 3 Floyds! Leaves a decent clinging lacing."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Great Christmas brew that reminds you of the smell of the season."
"O - It is a well done, well balanced porter. I am not usually a fan of hoppy porters and stouts, but this one is exceptional."
""
"O: Pretty good porter, I don't get as much hoppyness as others, but good none the less."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The finish is unique for a porter but I wish it had more body. When I think of a porter, and especially a Christmas type of beer, I think thicker with more body."
"Overall- Me not being a huge piney hops fan, I really wasnt blown away. I thought it just had 2 distinct flavors and was nothing crazy complex. In the end, I get the tie in with the piney hops and Christmas, and it makes for a decent seasonal brew."

"O: A beer I had a long time ago, well before I was a BA, so it was cool to revisit it. I remember when this you to be in the old Top 100. I don't think it's that good, but it's very solid and a nice holiday treat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As hoppy as the aroma was, the taste is more bittersweet, with the malt and hops fighting more supremecy. It starts sweet with great amounts of fudge and chocolate. The sensation of spice, like that of chipotle peppers, diversifies the beer. Finally, we get the blast of hops which taste very raw and green. Yet despite their rawness, the beer isn't really bitter. It's actually on the smooth side with a medium full body, helping to knock down any lingering concerns I had over the dose of hops used in this porter. Turns out to be a good one, in fact."

"O: find this one just above average, and think that the variant would be awesome... especially the Plum. there needs to be a sweetness in this to make this one more balanced"

"This is better than I remember from last year and I loved it. 3 Floyds has some kind of secret weapon that utilizes hops to perfection."

"Overall, this is a porter like none I've had before. The hop profile is prominent, yet there are still darker malt flavors too. This is the first stout or porter I've had in which I could detect the hops. Not a trait I would like other brewers to try in a porter or stout, but a very good beer."

"Smells mostly of pine resin and dank herbal hopping over char-roasted malt. The chocolate aroma notes stay firmly in the background of the nose. But in the flavor, the chocolate comes into the foreground to stand alongside spicy and earthy hopping and the pine resin retreats into the background. It does gain a flavor note of chocolate-dipped dried orange peel as the glass warms up towards room temperature. Bitterness is evenly distributed throughout. I was braced for a lot more dissonance of flavor than what I actually received. Well done, Three Floyds, well done."

"Pours a very dark black body with a small tan head. Straight up porter aroma, lots of roasted grains with a hint of vanilla sweetness behind it and a slight smell of alcohol. Very balanced on the palate. A little bit of burnt bitterness, good dark roasted malt, not too complex but enjoyable. Mouthfeel was a touch thin but not watery, very drinkable. Overall this is a solid porter, I didn't pick up on anything exotic that made this a ""Christmas"" porter but it was still very good."
""
"Great roasty malt character here, not sure what the ""Christmas"" part in the ""Christmas Porter"" refers to but certainly an excellent robust porter. Would certainly like to drink this again in the future."

"O: This is a delicious American porter, I would drink this frequently I suspect if it were available around me."
"A very good Porter for any occasion."
""
"Overall, I enjoyed this porter. Much hoppier than most that I have had recently, so it was a good change of pace. I will look forward to having again next year, but I won't go out of my way to get it."
"O: I really liked the balance of complimentary flavors in this one. Definitely on the hoppy side for a porter but it's not a black IPA or anything like that. Smooth, creamy and drinkable to boot."
"An above average example of the style, but after having this multiple times now, it always leaves something to be desired."

""

"I know why they call this a 'cousin' the ipa, because that's what it is. Good, not great. A Black IPA not a porter. I would not need to drink again."

"Pours a very dark brown color with a medium off-white head. Scent is very hoppy...wasn't expecting that. Very hoppy with some roasted malt aroma with a hint of Christmas spice. Taste is not as hoppy as the nose implies. Roasted malt flavors with a bit of chocolate. Some piney hop flavors and just a bit of spice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied...not as thick as I was hoping. Drinkability is fairly high. Overall, this does not taste like a typical American Porter to me. Drinks more like a black IPA."
"Overall: A tasty black IPA. The doesn't taste like a porter to me."

"Smooth, a bit creamy and highly drinkable makes 3 Floyds Alpha Klaus Christmas Porter a clear winner in my humble opinion. Though I'm always willing to share, I was glad to have this bomber all for myself."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. Overall not a bad brew. Decent alcohol warmth is noticeable but integrated well. I don't know what makes this a Christmas beer but it's quite enjoyable. Maybe it's the pine-like essence of the hops that is minorly reminiscent of Christmas wreath? Its like a black ipa but without the oily and overdone feel. This is worth checking out."
"O) This is a true holiday classic. It's like the Bing Crosby of holiday beers."
""
"A very robust porter leaning towards the stout range."
""
""
""
"D - That mexican sugar is really noticeable and fits well with the blend. I do wish there was a bit less espresso and more of that milk chocolate in the drink. Preferences aside, it's a good brew that is exactly what I'd expect from FFF during the holidays."
""
"D - very nice, this comes across more like a black ipa than a porter but I don't consider that a reason to complain. A nice balance between the hops and the dark malt."
"Two finger tan head nearly completely black body with a touch of light getting through. Nice smooth coffee/espresso aroma. The flavor. Burnt roasted malt with a very nice hop flavor, very distinct that many porters lack. Very smooth beer. Moderate carbonation and full bodied. The hop character for this one sets it apart from many other porters. Excellent beer."
""
""
"I look forward to this one every year. Not my favorite porter, but a solid example of the style and lack of bottle dating on this one doesn't make me wary like the IPAs."

"Verdict: A very tasty Christmas Porter from Three Floyds. The flavors are nice and rich, but the grassy hop presence really adds something interesting to this beer, per their motto, “It’s Not Normal.” Definitely a nice treat to enjoy each winter."

"Well I just have to say this one kicks ass! A monster thanks to Billakowski for trading me a bottle. The beer poured out looking black and thick looking. The head was brown in color with laces the glass nicely. The smell of the beer has some big hops coming off of it, along with plenty of roasted malt aromas and chocolate notes. The taste of the beer has a hoppy kick up front, it's almost like a black IPA at first. Then as the hops fade the chocolate lingers in the aftertaste. The beer has several layers of transitions in the flavor. It makes this beer very impressive. The mouthfeel of the beer had a great body to it along with a a solid carbonation. Overall It's not really a Christmas brew but regardless it's a damn fine beer. I would drink it again without a doubt."
""
""
""
"O: Sort of like a black IPA, but I like this one, since it leans more towards a porter, but has a nice hop component."
"O: Great overall beer that is different from the porter style but is so classic of the 3 Floyds Brewery. Didn't have too much hop without a good malt backbone to keep it on the porter side of things. Can't wait to enjoy again."

"Pours a really dark with a thick creamy tan head, about 3 fingers thick. Very nice lacing as well. Strong citrusy, hoppy smell with a mild roasted smell at the end. The taste is where this beer stands out. The roasted malt hits you first with a citrus back end. I expected, with the strong hop smell, it to be more of a hoppy taste, but NO!! A very delicious beer that exceeded my expectations, but shouldn't have considering it's FFF."

"Flavors are definitely on the mark. Rich, creamy toasted malt with a bit of a sharp hop bite starting at mid-palate that doesn't really serve this particular style all that well. Mouthfeel is quite creamy for a porter. You get flavors of coffee, bakers chocolate, and a slight bit of orange rind from the hops. A terrific beer that, in my opinion, is a bit too hopped for this style. It's very subtle, but the flavors tend to be just a bit too bitter on the finish. Still worth trying if you can find it."

"o: Very drinkable. The blend of flavors is nothing extraordinary but still very much a good beer. Perfect for a cool autumn evening. Definitely worth a try."

""
""
""
""
"O: This is good beer, though not my favorite combination of flavors. It’s a big chocolate dream, powered by a bitter sting of pine-cone hops, which are two elements that are right up my alley. But, while these flavors have some great moments, I don’t think this beer will ever be one of my favorites. Pick one up, though; it’s pretty tasty!"

"Enjoy and Happy Holidays!"

"Thinner bodied than expected with some tight carbonation, possibly the beginning sign of oxidization. The hop presence is much stronger than the aroma hinted at making it very dry and bitter, outshining the roasted malt notes. Just too hoppy for the style in my opinion. Roasted malt backbone with dark chocolate, oatmeal, toffee, caramel and dark fruit. Smoother as it warms but still too hoppy with a dry finish."
"We've had a lot of porters during the tasting marathon that this week has been. This one has been no exception to greatness. I only regret waiting this long to open it. Fantastic beer none the less."
"O - Good beer but I probably would like it more if it were a bit sweeter and thicker."
"I have to admit with this sitting on shelves I was not expecting much, but I’m down right blown away. I give 3floyds a pass on price as I now except to pay 4-5 bucks more than the beer is worth on their stuff. This is amazing beer priced like something life changing or at least expensive to make. Enjoy and cheers but really guys 9 bucks for a bomber?"
"Pours an opaque black with a 1 inch dark khaki head that fades to a thin cap. Thick foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, and pine-like herbal hops. There is also a slight coffee aroma if you smell hard enough. Taste is of dark roasted malt, coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and some citrus zest hops on the finish but not as strong as the smell would suggest. Medium roasty bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a much lighter body than I was expecting with a crisp yet smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good porter by itself but I don’t really understand the whole Christmas aspect attached to this one."
"Poured a murky dark brown with a foamy tan head that retained well and left some sticky lace on the glass. Smooth toasty caramel malts in the aroma, complimented by big piney hops and a chocolatey essence. The taste followed the aroma, with lots of caramel, chocolate, pine, with notes of cinnamon and brown sugar. Smooth and satisfying, medium-almost-full-bodied, and pleasantly drinkable."
"Overall, this is a great great American Porter, by far the best American Porter I have ever had. I have had many many great English Brown/Robust Porters, which have been great and plenty of good Baltic Porters as well but as far as American Porters go this is tops. Great Lakes was great but not as full bodied and complex. I don't consider any porter like Ballast Victory @ Seas an American porter because it's an Imperial Porter @ 10%ABV, so anyway yum. Glad I tasted it aged to avoid the bitter hoppiness that apparently exists when this brew is fresh."
"4/4/3/3/3"
"And here we go, okay: Tastes are really neat smoked malt, light and dark chocolates, brown sugar -- dark/darker (than normal), astringent and grassy hops, light booze, hiding caramel, ginger, more hops, coffee malt, medium roast beans, rubber, cream and fudge."
"Overall is really good and might be one of the best porters I've had yet. Was very excited to have this having only had 1 other 3 Floyds beer"
" Overall I loved this beer! So tastey,very hop forward.FFF just doesnt really let me down.If you can get this,get it!!!"
"Pours a dark brown that nears on black with a couple fingers of a frothy tan head. Smells like motherfucking Christmas in a goddamn glass. Some nice Christmas spice along with roasted malt, chocolate and perhaps a hint of coffee. Smells a bit creamy as well. Taste is fairly full and creamy with chocolate, roasted malt, dark malts, and a hints of coffee. Some nice spice is there as well. Creamy carbonation and nice mouthfeel. My first ever Three Floyds beer that I found in a Philly bar several years ago is still a Christmas favorite of mine."
"I actually had the opportunity to try the barrel-aged version of this beer at this Dark Lord Day 2011, but I have to say I like the unadulterated version more. The hops were substantial but kept in check; the toasty notes were offset by a nice sweetness."
"O: A very enjoyable beer, but in order for me to purchase again, I would need a more complex hop flavor upfront. The hop smell made me think there would be a strong presence of hops, but I was wrong."
"O: Not quite up to the level of my personal bench marks for the style. Although its not Edmund Fitzgerald or Black Butte, it's better than most porters out there. 4.5/5"
"D - Very nice beer. I wasn't expecting a porter with this much hops but it was very tasty. It kind of blurs the lines between porter and black IPA. It's quite drinkable. A whole bomber in one sitting would be no trouble."
"D: One of the better tasting porters that I can think of."
"D- Very interesting porter here. Lots more flavor than you would expect from a porter, but dead on from what you would expect from FFF. This would be a great on a snowy night, but it does the trick on a rainy, chilly evening. Would buy another in a heart beat!"
"D: Very drinkable beer that really was nice to sit down to. Easy to kill the bomber yourself and the flavor is very robust."
"D: Kind of heavy on the roast which limits the amount of other qualities you can pick up, but good."
"D: it actually was really easy drinking and was a tasty porter, glad I got to try this brew again; pretty solid."
"D- Easy drinkability, slight bitter taste but well balanced with the hops and coffee flavors, nothing too unique but enjoyable."
"D- I look forward to next years release. It is a enjoyable porter with a nice hop. I gladly pick one up every time I see it on the shelf."
"Atmosphere is exceptional. Great dark appearance with a magnificent head. Nose is chock full of of great components. Well balanced flavor. Nothing overpowers, and it's not distracted by a high alcohol flavor. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Fairly drinkable and radically different. It just got old pretty quickly. I was completely happy splitting this with a friend and not drinking the entire 22oz."
"D: A good beer but I somewhat quickly tired of the flavor on this one. One glass of this was enough for me; not particularly anxious to pick it up for a second time, but wouldn't be opposed to trying it again."
"Thanks to hurfer for the bomber! Poured into a dimpled glass mug. Pours dark brown with a thick foamy head that quickly fizzles, yet retains thin lacing throughout the session. At first, there was a strong hop aroma that overpowered everything else. Once the beer warmed up I was able to pick up caramel and chocolate aromas in addition to brown sugar and the hops. Caramel, cocoa, vanilla, and roasted malt flavors at the beginning. Then the hops kick in for a bitter hop and chocolatey finish. This beer has a silky mouthfeel with medium carbonation. I was glad this beer did not have a lactose milk sugar overkill like some of the 3F beers. This is a porter I would glady drink over the holidays!"
"d - An interesting porter; can definitely see the resemblance to Alpha King with the pine hops. Lots of pine and chocolate/roasted malts; definitely enjoyable. Would have again."
"D: Very drinkable! Looking forward to Christmas 2011!! Kidding...let's enjoy some sunshine in 2011 first! A great way to start the weekend."
"Bottle. Poured into a New Belgium tulip glass a dark brown color with a fluffy mocha fan head of 2 fingers. The aroma is a nice blend of chocolate and hops. Almost has a spice to it as well in the nose. Nice lace as the head settles. Medium mouthfeel. Cocoa like sweetness up front with a transition to a dark chocolate bitterness. The hollow are pretty bold towered the end as well. Slight booze."
"Pours black with ample tan head. Smells like pine hops and subdued coffee, sweet chocolate. Tastes of chocolate and coffee, hops, dry, high carbonation. Kind of like a porter IPA. Pretty good. I'd call this a good Cascade Dark Ale :) I'm diggin the hoppy aroma and the back flavors in this porter."
"Very nice beer. Better than many porters but does not quite reach the top tier. This is one I would seek out on occasion if it were available locally. Worth a try."
"Drinkability: Heavily hopping this beer just was not a decision that coalesces with what I am looking for in a Christmas Porter. This is quite possibly the first time I will want a less-hopped beer and most likely the last."
"M/D - Big, full bodied roastiness with a decent bit of hop bite as well. A sipper, but certainly one I can sip for a long time."
"D - Pretty solid, although it feels bigger than it's 6%, which is good or bad depending on if you want to feel drunk or if you want something to placate your need for beer but not mess you up. I'd drink this again."
"Overall, this is a deliciously minty pine tree dipped in chocolate. If that sounds appealing, you will dig this. For what it's worth, I like this beer better than pretty much any Black IPA I've had. Not quite sure what differentiates this porter from that style, but if you're after the hops, look no further."
"D: Nice sipping beer on a cold winter night. Very smooth and easily drinkable at 6%."
"Overall- Another winner from Three Floyds. They are constantly re-cementing themselves as one of my favorite breweries."
"(70th)"
"D: Quite good. Not my favorite porter, but a good one and nice offering by Three Floyds; give it a spin."
"Not sure if I had a bad bottle or what was going on with this one. Just a strange session experience. In any event. Not the best porter - but not the worst."
"D - The beer is delicious and all the flavors are very well represented and well crafted but also work well together. This is something that might not be expected. Very refreshing and yummy brew. (4.5)"
"D - maybe one, but most likely not."
"Very creamy mouthfeel and a nice balanced body overall, which makes this an easy to drink beer. Nice stuff."
"D/O- The drinkability of this is ridiculously high. Perhaps the best porter I've ever had. Will be a holiday staple for years to come for me. Three Floyds does it again."
"D: Easy drinkin'. Not one designed for chugging, but could be done."
"D: very tasty, but the overwhelming coffee flavor was a bit much for me at times. This beer needs a dessert to go with it!"
"Really great beer, enjoyed two and wish they had some bombers to go."
"D- Very drinkable brew that is an interesting blend and is great for the holidays!"
"Drinkability: I could definitely drink a lot of this. It smells huge but drinks easy. The taste in the finish leaves you craving more."
"All in all, this is an ok brew to try around the holidays if you have access. Don't bother hunting. Many better brews in the style."
"Pitch black with one finger of head that suddenly settled to a thick cap. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. Bizarre aroma of piney/grassy hops and burnt, roasted malt. I can tell they packed the aroma hops into this beer. I have never tasted a beer that tastes like Alpha Klaus. Even the over-hopped Imperial Stouts do not pack the hop flavor of this porter. A lot of resinous pine (pine forest or Chritmas tree fire comes to mind) and grass. The yeast did their job because despite the sugar addition, this is one dry beer. The chocolate malt does not play a very large part of the flavor profile and that is a bit of a shame. The malt gets overpowered by the hops. Tastes almost wet hopped. A wet hopped, Christmas Porter or a Black Christmas IPA? Don't give lesser brewers any ideas now. Bitterness is higher than any porter that I can recall. I just cannot give this beer a higher score because it is so unporter-like. The appearance and mouthfeel are the only things reminiscent of porters. Nicely carbonated but could of used a little more heft in body. A hopheads dream of a porter. One of these a year would be enough."
"O: Very drinkable for the style, although I wouldn't suggest more than one. I believe these beers are meant to be shared anyway. Another solid offering from a fantastic brewery. Next up, Fireside Chat!"
"Maybe."
"D: A bit of nostalgia: This was the brew my wife and I split on our first New Year's Eve as a married couple. I'll be getting more of this stuff soon from friends and family in the Midwest. This is one of the strangest beers on the market!"
"pick some more of this up to take to some holiday parties."
"Drinkability: There was a little bit of contention amongst the tasting group about what to do with this bottle. I feel that it would do well to sit for some time, perhaps 6 months to 1 full year to allow the hops to mellow out and allow the malts to showcase their flavors; the argument to that would be that it is only 6% ABV and may not stand the test of time, even if kept in a relatively decent closet/cellar or whatever. Frankly, I'm willing to give it a shot -- after all, what's 6 moths?"
"Medium bodied, creamy, smooth, and properly carbonated. This is a nice, easy to drink Porter. Not too hoppy, which is a plus for a porter in my book. I would buy this again."
"Another solid offering from FFF"
"At $10 a bottle I can't afford to drink a lot of 'em, but it was definitely worth the price. Hopefully Santa will leave me a few, though I haven't been that nice...at least that's what my wife says!"
"4.0 D: Good hoppy porter. Definitely a good one to try. Solid in each category."
"Overall, this is a pretty good beer...I like the take on the classic porter style, giving it a little more depth with a lot more hops. It is black in color, but looks are often deceiving."
"D- I was somewhat disappointed, this wasn't a bad beer, but it seemed to be a bit one-dimensional and the pine overpowered everything else."
"D - good all around, nothing here stands out and its a bit surprising for a Three Floyds beer not to be over the top with the hops. decently drinkable."
"Medium-light in body with a wonderfully soft and creamy carbonation, this beer has a blend of lactose sweetness, a touch of coffee-like acidity and a little oxidation. At this point, the hops have faded and by quite a bit, but I quite like it this way. I don't remember how much I paid for this, but I'm happy to report that this doesn't fall into the shouldanevercellaredthat file. Enjoyable, I'd drink this again."
"This pours a dark black with a frothy, pretty mocha head. On the nose there is a deep pine mixed with roasted coffee. On the tongue the roasted malt and coffee come to the fore with a bit of hop bitterness at the back. In the mouth, it's pretty similar to Alpha King, a bit of a buzzsaw, which works pretty well here but cuts down a bit on the drinkability. Overall I'm a big fan."
"Yet another Porter that I hope was gonna be better but still a nice porter overall."
"Overall a very nice porter with lots of hop presence and high drinkability."
"The mouthfeel is thick and sweet more like a stout than a porter but what the hell its 3F and it has a ton of hops. This is a very clean well put together beer I just wouldn't call it a porter but I guess it gets a pass since it is really a christmas beer."
"D: Crisp and cleansing for a porter."
"Mouthfeel is excellent - smooth and silky, though firm and tight at the same time. Medium bodied, nicely coating and dry, a bit oily. Very nice, and quite drinkable."
"This porter is full of flavor and will overpower many meals. I would pair this porter with exotic cuisine filled with spices. I would like to have more of this special beer."
"Overall, this is a kick-ass porter. If you get a chance, try it."
"D-For the reputation this beer has, I was pretty disappointed with it. The bitter/hoppy notes don't seem to meld well with the porter notes."
"Drinkability -- This was a delightful diversion from the tried and true American Porter route. Great hop aromatics and flavor, yet still really mild and satisfying. Crisp and refreshing aren't necessarily attributes that one would associate with a Porter, but this is really nice. I'd love to see this year-round. Great stuff."
"Not sure why Dexter was on, but at least there's beer. And Alex is talkin' this one up, too. It pours a pitch black-brown topped by a finger or so of tan foam. The nose contains a strong contingent of green hops, with some chocolate and light roasted malts in the background. The taste holds a touch more roast, but it's still only a vain attempt at countering the hops, which have maintained their strength. The body is a light-ish medium with a light moderate carbonation. Honestly, I can see why people could like a rather hoppy porter like this one, but I am not one of these people. There's just not enough roast to provide any kind of appreciable balance."
"D- A decent porter but reminds me more of a normal stout. Good flavors but a little too dominant in the coffee, chocolate flavors."
"This beer looks amazing and smells amazing. A dark stout like color with beige foam. The smell is hoppy, like a dry hopped wonder. There is also some chocolate to help out the non-hopheads. The flavor is a wonderful blend of hops and chocolate. The melange is oddly fantastic. It's a really drinkable mix, I must say that this beer is one of the better things I've ever put on my tongue. It is the wonderful blend of chocolate and hops without bringing the hop bitterness within. It's a great beer, get it as fresh as possible for the best experience."
"decent. I'll have one or two a year probably around this time of year. I'm close to the brewery but it's only a 1 month item. ABV not too bad so a bomber would be easy in one sitting. I'd like this more if I was a fan of very piney hops."
"Poured into imperial pint from bottle. Color is a dark dark brown bordering on black. A very creamy 1 finger head sits at the top with excellent retention and some of the best lacing I have seen in a porter. Smell is huge hops up front - bitter, pine, some spiciness. Chocolate, caramel and roasted malts follow. Hop forward but still relatively balanced flavor. The spicy hop flavor plays well with the chocolate sweetness. Some roasted malt and hitter hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is slightly thick and chewey, medium carbonation. Drinkability is good, but not as good as some of the less hoppy porters like Great Lakes or Founders. Hoppy flavor gets a bit overwhelming after a while. Alpha Klaus is a great beer and will only get better over the next few weeks as the hops fade."
"D - Good beer here, just didnt wow me. Im guessing may be better fresh, but still a pleasure to try and to drink. Not hot and boozy an easy drinker."
"Bottle. Christmas came a little early for my this weekend. Santa was very good to me indeed. Wrapped up inside this gift was a jet black body with a tight tan head. Notes of chocolate, dark sugars, roasted malts and winter spices. Smooth and creamy. I'm glad the holidays are right around the corner so I can pick up another one of these."
"Included and recommended by Gratefulbeerhead.... Thanks Eric! I really enjoyed this one. Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass. Black appearance with dark tan head. Pours to 1/2 inch of head with good retention. The aroma is dominated by coffee and chocolate, and the taste is very similar, dominated by coffee and chocolate as well. Very good porter, sweet with a domination of malt on the tongue. Mouthfeel is perfect for a porter and the drinkability is exceptional for a porter."
"D- This was a very drinkable porter that has jumped leaps and bounds in my eyes. Three Floyds has this problem with making knock out beers left and right....what a problem to have!"
"Poured into a New Belgium snifter. It poured smoothly and had a quickly dissipating khaki head, lacing the glass. It looked as if it were the prototype for a porter. The smell was excellent. It was rich, malty, roasted, and had a sweet fruit aroma as well, perhaps cranberry. It had great flavor. The flavor mimicked the aromas. It was spot on. It had a great consistency and was incredibly smooth. It's one of the most drinkable beers I've had, and my list is extensive. The only knock on this beer is that it only comes in 22oz bombers. This one is a masterpiece."
"D - Christmas in July. Nice. It's a drinkable porter year-round but definitely would be more fitting with snow on the ground."
"D- Perhaps the one-dimensionality comes from age on this bottle... just a little too simple and a little too skewed to the bitter side than I would have liked. Despite the average drinkability, I would still seek this out again."
"M- Pretty thick for a porter. Its very very smooth with a slightly drying finish from the hops. Carbonation is quite low and it promotes a silky smooth feel."
"Very easy to drink."
"D: This is drinking quite nice right now. Goes down nicely, not too filling, mild kick. I would love to try a fresher bottle of this to compare."
"Purchased from 3 Cellars in Franklin, WI. Pours a black body with a nice tan head that leaves a good amount of lacing. Aroma is of roasted malts and coffee beans. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation and feels soft and creamy. Flavors of chocolate, coffee and a touch of vanilla lead to a mellow finish. Excellent drinkability from this porter."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is strong toffee malt and coffee. The flavor is coffee and roasted malt. The flavor is pretty basic American porter. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"F: Dries just a bit but still smooth and creamy with some sweetness. Lingering roast and coffee with lots of bitterness from mostly the charred malts. A slight peppermint comes out more on the finish and leaves the mouth with a feel of it. A little residual sugar as well makes the mouth a bit stick."
"Beer is medium to low in body, slight roast / smoke on the back end. Some sweetness up front, easy drinking and smooth. Second taste, really high drinkability. A slight aftertaste is building. Not a lot of bitterness. Its a great porter for sure."
"D- Could not drink very many of these, given its heaviness. Also seems a little flat. Could use some more carbonation to improve the drinkability."
"Mouthfeel on the heavier side with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, I really enjoyed drinking this one. They really balanced out the citrus hops, bitter malts and sweet sugars very well to make a very good complex beer. I would gladly drink this one again."
"This is a freakin amazing brew, luckily there is a huge stash at the store near me, I might have to go stock up for the summer."
"Overall, this is just excellent stuff. Say what you want about Dark Lord (I say it's awesome), but if you don't think Three Floyds is one of the best in the business, in the words of Ice Cube, you better ""chiggity-check yo' self before you wriggity-wreck yo' self."""
"SkÅL!"
"Derek, the Porter King, comes through! Thanks for sharing! Deep opaque brown pour with thick mocha froth and stout like lace.Strong coffee aroma with good levels of hopping, dark chocolate, molasses, and roasted coffee beans. Lots of bitter chocolate coffee flavours mingle well and leave a simmilar aftertaste. Large bitter chocolate finish. Thanks for sharing Derek!"
"d: pretty unique porter that's a pleasure to drink"
"D: Very high. Great stuff. I want another and will buy again. Terrific seasonal."
"D: I love a good porter and I love most of what Three Floyd's does so there's no doubt I expect to enjoy this one every year. It's been some time since I've had a fresh one and my next order of business will be to locate a bottle of the 2009. This bottle of Alpha Klaus has held up well to a year on the shelf, but I know I've had better. Smooth, creamy and flavorful without any one aspect taking too much control, Alpha Klaus is well balanced and highly enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Without a doubt one of the best porters I have ever had. There's a big hit of classic porter-quality chocolate and coffee with the delicious bitterness of IPA level hops. What more can you ask for? If you have the opportunity, I highly recommend you try this beer."
"as much as i wanted to ""love"" this beer I was a bit disappointed.smells better than the taste."
"Pours a very, very dark brown with a moderately-brown head. Hops are at the forefront of this one, with a bit of dark chocolate, coffee, and roast coming through in the background. The taste is quite similar, with an amazing amount of piney hops coming through alongside a little bit of citrus. Chocolate and coffee also make an appearance. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and well-carbonated. Overall, a little intense and heavy for extended drinking, but definitely an absolutely delicious beer."
"D: This beer is most definitely a style bender with the massive amount of hops involved. Once I finished the first first half of the bomber, I promptly reached for the rest and made a pour. While this isn't a typical Porter, it is one that I did enjoy, being the hop head that I am."
"If it had anymore bitterness I think it would cut down on the drinkability considering it is already a pretty full bodied beer."
"Medium bodied and easy to drink. The bitter citrus flavor really surprised me, but as a big fan of IPAs I enjoyed it a lot."
"D - Interesting and intensely smokey. Light thin body is a fault in my opinion."
"I poured from a bomber into a snifter. It presenets a deep chocolate in color, with ruby highlights and a medium white head with a good amount of lacing. The nose is burnt chocolate with piney resin(this is a good thing). The backbone of the flavor is chocolate, it is followed by a nice amount of piney hop flavor. The piney finish lingers. The brew is medium in body, and has a nice creamy mouthfeel. This is an excellent porter."
"Pours a deep and dark brown color with a thin and creamy brown head. The aroma is complex and intriguing with a masterful mix of roasted malt, citrus hops, and sprucey freshness. The flavor is just as interesting with a surprising burst of citrus hops followed by a smooth transition into a background flavor of roasted malt. The finish sees the introduction of the piney flavor mixed in with a slightly sweet and tart malt flavor. The finish ends cleanly and fresh with a farewell kiss of alcohol."
"Poured black hue with large frothy light brown head that lasted with excellent lacing. Full body with creamy texture and flat carbonation. Aroma and flavor of heavy roasted, molasses and vanilla. Long full complex sweet flavor with moderate sweet finish of long duration. May be the best of style."
"Overall a very good christmas beverage. I would love to revisit this every year."
"D: One of the better tasting porters that i can think of."
"As with most unique tastes, you don't want to overdo it. It's novel enough to share with Christmas party strangers, and good enough for me to pursue each and every year. Alongside Gumballhead, this beer puts fits Three Floyds on the frontier of craft brewing."
"D: For an American Porter at 7.5% this is an extremely drinkable beer."
"D: I loved this beer. I would gladly have this on any cool winters night."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and rich without being too thick, adds to the drinkability, it's smooth and has light carbonation. Taste is rich and roasty, light dark chocolate flavors as well as some holiday spiciness as well."
"Highly drinkable."
"Overall, not a bad porter at all. Very roasted. Fairly drinkable. Nothing to special. Still trying to figure out what makes this an Xmas beer."
"Reviewed on 8/21/09. Bottle. Pours black with a thick light tan head. Aroma of sweet roasted malt, very sweet. Flavor of sweet malt, chocolate malt, some lactose notes. Pretty bland and boring really; I'm quite underwhelmed. Too sweet and not complex at all. Meh."
"Nice thick brown head atop a rich, dark beer. Aromas of chocolate, hops, roasted malt, toffee. A fabulous tasting brew, and easily one of the best porters I have had. This beer is really easy to drink, and I will definitely be picking up a few of these from FFF in a couple of days."
"Pours black, big tan/brownish head. Big aroma spewing forth, coffee some chocolate notes and the hops, oh yes the hops you expect from any Three Floyds brew. On the tongue you have a magnificent porter, with all the roast you want plus all those citrusy/piney hops you come to expect from 3F's. Love it. I'm still sad over the fact that I can no longer easily get their beers here in VA but I do respect them for pulling back distribution to better serve the folks at their home. You want a big aggressive porter, this is it."
"Currently one of my favorite beers (I had a couple last year too). Try it with your christmas ham."
"Consumed - 12/12/09"
"The mouthfeel is thing and carbonated. The spiciness coupled with the acidic carbonation really help the overall sensation of the beer. I'd say this has everything you'd expect from a porter. Aqueous mouthfeel but full flavoured. It's like a stout, but I could drink as many as my alcohol tolerance would let me."
"The hops/pine are a bit overwhelming but a nice roasted coffee, maybe dark chocolate taste arrives after a swallow. Beer is nice a bubbly on the palate, fairly smooth going down. This beer is a nice creative piece of porter+heavy hops, highly enjoyable."
"D: A very nice, hopped up Porter. Another fine beer from FFF."
"D: Not a fan of this beer, perhaps my opinion would change with a more aged version of it as the hops exercise control over the beer."
"Overall, reminds me of an Anchor Christmas, which I don't like. Try it though, If your tastes are different."
"This is easily one of the best porters around, and it's even better fresh so the hops can do their thing."
"D: This almost drinks more like a dark IPA than a porter, but it is an intriguing brew never the less. This was my first opportunity to experience the freshness of draft... and it translates to a more assertive hop profile (vs. the bottle). Great beer from an excellent brewery."
"D- A unique take on the style and the alcohol is nicely hidden. A nice holiday treat."
"Goes down smooth. Great beer. Must have."
"Overall, one of the most unique beers I've ever had and probably THE most unique porter I've had. This is a pretty remarkable brewery. I think I made the right choice in picking a grad school that's just a short trip away from Indiana."
"Into dogfish snifter. Black, various sized bubbles compose a nice 3/4"" khaki head. Head drops to a fog and a solid ring. Super malty nose, all rich caramel and chocolate. Almost an interesting note of wood, like ceder or something. Quite a bit of carbonation, fizzles and brings back the head with a swirl. Smell is clean and clear, maybe a little meaty, some licorice too. Flavor is really great. Hops don't show themselves in aroma or flavor, obviously an aged bottle, considering FFF haven't been distributed in Ohio for a long time, no idea where dude got these or how long they've been in his cooler. Flavor is an amazingly complex blend, rich round chocolate, no lingering bitterness but definitely not too sweet. Sweet creamy coffee, light easy drinking iced tea, such a smooth light flavor without being bland or one note. Glad I got a second bottle of this. Drinks super easy. Feel is good too, only the slightest bit mouth-coating, not sticky at all, mostly helps the flavor linger. These kinds of finds are always great. As the beer warms flavor starts showing some fruit, raspberry I think. It's interesting to me that drinking and tasting this beer is definitely linked to my situation right now. I'm enjoying this beer, while watching the new K-OS video, I'm reminded that I really enjoy his music. It takes me back to a drive down to Yellow Springs where I first purchased Palo Santo Merron and stole ramps from a state park. Those ramps were delicious."
"D - Highly quaffable and delicious."
"The beer is very heavy on the palate but limited in drinkability."
"Had this on tap at 3Floyds last night. Had about a 1/2"" light tan head, very tight carbonation. Left a good amount lacing. Smells like fruit, spices. Tastes somewhat sweet, roasty, chocolaty and malty. After spending a half hour riding to the bar in 35 degree weather on my motorcycle, this was very warming! After the first sip, you feel much better. The mouthfeel lost a little in my opinion, there was less carbonation than I expected and it felt a little slick going down. Almost oily. I got used to it though, honestly I wouldn't change a thing about this beer. I could easily spend a snowy afternoon drinking these over at 3F!"
"D - Age unknown. Based on FFF distribution in OH, I imagine this bottle is at least two years old. Maybe it was refrigerated this whole time, but who knows. Taking all that into account, this beer seems to have held up pretty well."
"D: Drinkable but maybe a bit off style."
"All in all, quite pleased, as usual from Three Floyds."
"cant wait until the 09 batch hits the stores"
"Pours a deep, dark, smooth clear black. Very nice looking. The head forms about 2cm, falls back a bit, but sticks around. It's tan, dense, and nice - leaving stick bits of lacing. A very beautiful beer. The smell is very nice, too. A bit of roasted barley, but backed up with a very nice caramelly sweetness. A bit of semisweet chocolate, and a whiff of some grain, maybe a hint of some alcohol, bourbon kind of, but I think it's just the dark grain husks. The taste is just like a great straightforward american porter. It doesn't come out with anything different than you expect, it's just very well executed. Very clean, filled with roasted barley and a very nice rich sweetness. It's still dry enough, a bit grainy, and toasty that it is well balanced. At the end there's like a dense, crusty bread with some chocolate sauce. This is just the definition of an American Porter. The bodyis about medium, with mild carbonation, a bit of a rush, no real sting. It's pretty good, probably a bit heavier because there's more grain in it. The beer is very enjoyable. If this wasn't so high in ABV, with this flavor, I could stick with this for a while, but I think this is still really great. I would recommend it if you can find it, and I'm not sure if the months that have passed have made it better, but I know that this is good now."
"22oz bottle shared by photomike. Black with a medium beige head. The aroma is just outstanding; a mix of potent tropical fruit hoppiness (mostly pineapple, with a good dose of ripe grapefruit) and subtle dark chocolate. If you close your eyes, you might almost think IPA, but the chocolate is also unmistakable. The flavor also has plenty of tropical fruit and dark chocolate, with a dry, earthy, almost smokey quality as well. The finish is dry and earthy with a medium bitterness that isn't nearly as intense as the hop aroma and flavor. Not nearly as thick thick or sweet as I had expected, and I really like that. This drinks much easier than you might think, in a sharp departure from a certain stout that FFF makes, with a medium body and moderate carbonation. This was an awesome and pretty unique beer. Reminded me of Stone 11th, but more toward the porter end of the continuum."
"Overall I think this is a good beer. I think my bottle just bad more gas in it. I would love to try the next version to see what the hops are like when fresh."
"Alpha Klaus pours brown, almost black with a huge, creamy tan head that faded quickly. The aroma was predominately coffee. The taste was also coffee with an alcohol taste as it warmed up. Carbonation is not all spent in the head, medium body. Drinkability is OK. Not bad for a porter, but Three Floyd's missed their usual mark of excellence."
"This was a big and interesting beer. Hop kick hampered drinkability for me towards the end of the bottle, but this was enjoyable."
"D: I wish this was a bit more affordable because I'd buy a bunch. Great drinkability!"
"D- Very easy to drink and highly recommended."
"Yet another bold and balanced one from my friends down the street."
"A nice, interesting take on a porter."
"Pours deep, dark brown into an imperial pint glass; there's a tan, two-finger head that dissipates soon but leaves lacing down the glass. The smell is sweet coffee, malt, toffee, some savory and dried fruit notes. The flavor is more of the same, with a finish that a touch salty, with a lingering bitter finish. It's mildly carbonated, very rich. Easy going down. whether you sip or gulp. Up there with the best of the style. Too bad it's not year-round, and too bad I have to get a friend to ship it to NYC."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. If I were to review it based on being a porter, it is a bit heavy on the hops and weak on the malt. However, it is very good and definitely worth trying and should I be able to get it again, I will. I will admit, I must have noted the hops more than many based on other reviews but again, still a very good beer."
"Deep chocolate pour, slight head diminishes quickly. Nose of chocolate and roasted coffee. Deep rich mouthfeel, Taste of that chocolate and roasted coffee. Easily enjoyable as well as easily drinkable, this brew I can recommend to everyone, introduce the world to the Three Floyds Brewery!"
"D - As I stated not a big fan of Ports but this one is good it definately borders a stout in taste although a bit thinner than a true stout."
"Got to have some of this last night and I was pleased! It poured a pitch black with a nice tan head. Smelled of chocolate, a malty sweetness, and a hint of chocolate. The taste was very similar but the hops were very present in the taste where they didn't show there head at all in the nose. A very nice porter and thin enough to drink during the summer without weighing you down! Well done FFF"
"Black body, off-white had with good retention. Sweet nutty chocolate on the nose. Brown sugar, molasses, and chocolate with a nice, bitter, balancing hop finish. The body is medium full and very smooth. Heck of a porter. It really put me in the Christmas mood (I reviewed this last fall) and it did it without any baking spices and that makes me happy. There were some residual sweetness issues, but still it was damn good."
"D: I don't think I'd get this one again."
"This is a very drinkable porter, despite its 7.5% ABV content. They should really make this year-round. Instead, I will continue to enjoy it during my December rituals during the Sunday afternoon football game - and occasionally score the occasional discounted bottle in late spring."
"I'd like it to be a touch thicker in the mouth. Please!"
"Drinkability is high, as there is no boozyness on this, its very tasty and finishes clean without a heavy creamyness that can normally weigh me down to the point that I feel like there is a brick in my stomach."
"I like it. Pretty good beer, I would probably get a couple more, and cellar them, if I see them anywhere. I would drink one every now and again, but nothing too regular. Just to see how they cellar. Cheers!"
"Another winner from Three Floyds."
"Another Yummy brew from Three Floyds. Gumballhead and Dreadnaught are among my fav's. Too bad I only have one bottle of this seasonal brew, but Christmas is only eight months away, so I will definitely be asking Santa for more. So onto the review... poured into a pint glass, leaving a good portion still in the bottle. Appearance is pitch black with a one inch frothy head. It smells wonderful, like a Christmas porter should smell with chocolate being the dominant feature. Taste, well, is good, but I'm gonna let it warm up a bit before really diving in. The taste develops as it warms; I don't think this beer is meant to be consumed refrigerator cold, in the same way Three Floyds' Moloko Plus improved as it warmed and the carbonation of that brew became more tolerable. As this Three Floyds brew warms up, the frothy head disappears, leaving only lacing on the Samuel Smith pint glass. Three Floyds does a very nice job of blending in the hops, as the hops do add a very nice kick to this Christmas Porter. A very enjoyable brew. Thanks Three Floyds."
"D--Any easy drinking dark beer that makes you want more. Definitely in the ranks of world class porters."
"Drinks pretty easy for the ABV & style, the dryness, plus slight coffee overkill slows me down a bit. Nice, but give me SN Porter or Black Butte any day"
"Good to try, wouldn't be a regular beer I would seek out."
"If I didn't have to drive to Glendora for these, I'd drink them all the time."
"This is a really nice treat. A noteworthy beer. Really good stuff. Definitely worth a try if you have not had it."
"I was quite disappointed in this years batch (2008) of the Alpha Klaus. Three Floyds needs to expand out of it's hop profile, and try something new. This beer tasted similar to the Dreadnaught with a touch of coffee on the finish. Absolutely no mouth feel, thin and watery, the flavors were simply awful, and this beer made very little impression on me in a positive light. Hopefully next years will be a better outing."
"D - Could have several of these. No flavor is overpowering or hurts the palate."
"The last of my stash o' Three Floyds brews, they went quickly... Dark dark brown, thin bits of ruby shining through around the edges with a bit of light. Nice foamy brown head, fades. Nice roasted malt and brownie mix nose. Sweet and inviting. Much the same in the tate. Great malty base to this one out front. Chocolate and molasses, roastyness all the way through. A slightly bitter resiny hop finish keeps this beer balanced. Really great flavors all over this one. Hope to get some more of this in time for the holidays next year. Cheers to alleykatking for hooking me up with a great mix of FFF."
"I'm guessing this bottle is around six months old. Taken out of the cellar and poured at cellar temperature into my nonic pint glass. Appears a dark brown color bordering on black, with about an inch of dense fluffy dark ecru foam. The foam lingers forever giving up a little to leave a lace on the glass with each sip. A great looking pour. Smells of rich roasted and toasted grains, milk chocolate, raisins, and caramel. Tastes of grassy, piney hops, semi-sweet and dark chocolates, caramelized malts, raisins, cherries, and you can't have chocolate without vanilla. Rich and full bodied with medium carbonation. I look forward to tracking down another bottle next season."
"Quite refreshing porter. This is like alpha king with roasted malt. Pretty good little beer ."
"D: I think this is where the sum of the parts really hurts it a bit. The hoppiness cuts down on the drinkability compared to others in the style. I like it, but I wish I would have shared a bottle of this one."
"Pours black with a decent crème head. Nose is interesting. Striking characteristics that are a bit difficult to nail down. Coffee perhaps. Candy. Some type of fruit. Almost like a unripe berry or hard apple or something like that. Whatever it is, I like it. Flavor is nice. Spicey robust tones. Thick malts. Pleasant acidity. A nice robust porter with good spices and a touch of fruity sweetness as well. Feel is thick on liquid and carbonation is a bit lower and barely biting. This is a nice porter. I could drink this all night."
"overall: a bit hoppy i thought, with another 3-6 months on it i bet this one is really nice but that kind defeats the point. I have been a little un-impressed with FFF to be honest"
"My oh my, this is a hopped up stout! Rich, decadent and highly enjoyable blend of Three Floyd's goodness. This is too easy to put back. If you want a nice, solid, hoppy stout, you must try this one. Fantastic!"
"Poured into a goblet, appeared as dark cola and had a scant tan head (I could have poured it with more vigor). Smelled spicy, with pine, coffee/espresso/roasted malts and a hint of toffee. The bittering hops were fairly prominent in the taste. Started sweet (not cloying) then some good piney hops which gave way to chocolate/coffee and a finishing bitter. Medium body, medium-low carbonation. Just a tad sticky on the palate. A really nice porter - certainly a good, warming brew to enjoy on a winter's day."
"Courtesy of brewczar. 750ml bottle served in my Gouden Carolus chalice. Poured one shade shy of black with deep red highlights around the edges. Pour revealed a quarter inch, frothy, off-white head that dissipated almost immediately. Nose consisted of espresso and a roasted quality. Taste was smokey, roasty with a dry hops bittering at the back. Mouthfeel was light and watery with a carbonation level slightly over the top for the style. Easy drinking, well-hidden abv. Somewhat lacking in flavor, but improves somewhat as it warms."
"D - This Porter was a very enjoyable example of a Christmas beer, the spices mixed well with the style and produced a very enjoyable beer"
"this is a solid, solid porter that is ver delicious, slightly too carbonated, but not even a 1% issue....fabulous beer"
"Very drinkable and enjoyable. I really enjoy this.."
"Overall this is an alright porter that I think may be elevated with BA's because of the ABV."
"22 oz. Nearly black pour, white head. Surprisingly piney aroma, some peat and roast malt. Flavor is also surprisingly crisp, very dry and hoppy. This over-rides the earthy malt, chocolate and coffee. Nearly creamy, but the bittyness hurts the mouthfeel a bit. Finishes with some linering coffee and hop bitterness. Really too much hops for the style. More alcohol warming as well than I would prefer, even though it is not that terribly high an abv. Drinkability is pretty meh. Unfortunately I had rather high expectations for this. Hopefully with some age this will mellow out a bit."
"Body is medium, CO2 is ample, the beer warms as you drink it. Not a bad beer over all."
"Overall, it's a little disappointing for me, I always stop by the brewery on my way to Michigan and I've had just about everything they offer. This is the first by them I didn't really dig."
"D. Slides very easily. This is well made beer and I would love to drink it regularly but at $8.50 a bottle, it will be relegated to a few times per year beer."
"Poured this beer form a 22 oz bomber. Poured black with a brownish head. Left a good collar throughout the glass. To me, this beer had hints of coffee and pine at the same time. The taste was not one of my favorites. I did not enjoy drinking this beer. I am big fan of some of their other beers, but I did not enjoy this beer."
"Rich and creamy mouthfeel, thinner than expected. Drinks well overall an nice try here."
"This is a top-notch porter from Three Floyds. Though, I'm not sure what makes it an Xmas brew. Any spices are pretty much nil. A must try."
"Really a top-notch porter. Big, bold, and very robust."
"Drinkability: Dan says ""mint chocolate milk," I concur, and being among the class of people who would find such a thing terribly drinkable, I'll have to rate this one sort of high. At 7.5%, it's getting near the upper range of the style, but it's a drinkable enough style to begin with, so that's ok. Definitely recommended."
"poured thick black with cream colored head with impressive retention. the smell was quite sweet with a roasted malt hop scent. taste was sweeter than a typical porter. light floral hops detected and subtle chocolate notes. roasted malts. the moutfeel was kind of light, almost watery compared to most porters but this is FFF so anything goes. the drinkability though was great. I could drink these one after another and at 7.5% ABV, things could get ugly. But hey, It's not normal!"
"http://foodbeertravel.wordpress.com/2009/01/10/alpha-klaus/"
"At 7.5, this goes down easy...I would easy drink a few on a cold winter day/night, very enjoyable. I loved this beer, hope I can find more!"
"Big beer, big taste, smooth and rewarding going down."
"A rich opaque black brown ale with a moderate sized cocoa head that fades at an average rate to a thin ring and lacing. A mix of citrus and floral hops atop toffee sweetness balanced by coffee bitterness. Starts with a robust bitterness of roasted grain. Overall is ashy and smoky. The end is a dry yet not harsh combination of hops and roast malt bitterness. Still medium bodied dry ale with above average head retention. This is a holiday tradition for me when I return home to Indiana."
"A - poured a nice dark black with tan head that gripped the glass. Once it settled it kept a nice thin tan foamy layer on top S - Nice deep coffee aroma with earthy hops and some sweet malt. T/M - Bitter coffee follwed up by a touch of chocolate sweetness then bitter hops. It was decently carbonated and not too thick. I wasn't expecting so many hops though. D - This was good but didn't live up to the hype I expected. It had too much hops and not enough malt, chocolate, sweetness. Pretty good beer but could be better I think."
"Very dark, Poured straight into a tulip glass with a 2 inch head that smells absolutely wonderful, filled with roasted marshmellows and earthy hops. It takes about 5 minutes for the head to subside, leaving lacing all the way down. This is an awesome beer, very hoppy, complementing the roastiness. It is very dry, smooth and extremely easy to drink. I could make an evening of smelling the earthy hops and then tasting the roasted malts... this is an awesome holiday / winter beer."
"I always enjoy most of FFFs offerings and this proved to be no different. The hops evident in this is an awesome balance with the delectable roasted sweetness that accompanies the rest of the beer."
"drinkability- another great beer by fff's. goes down way to easy for a 7.5%."
"D: major credit for creativity with the style and flavor combination. 7.5% makes it a bomber only for me but a great one at that. Absolutely wonderful, believe the hype."
"Great brew my first one this Christmas Day I am easily going to polish this one off while enjoying the festivities. Thanks again Santa"
"I was pleasantly surprised by this beer as when I opened it I didnt think I had an A beer in my hand."
"D - very nice."
"2007 Edition, decided to kick off the holiday week of beer with a FFF Alpha Klaus. I was a little worried that this one sat too long but once I popped the top and the aroma of coffee and chocolate filled the air. Poured black with a beast of a head that overflowed my Corsendonk snifter. Aromas are coffee, roasted malts, and an underlying sweetness. Flavor is bitter chocolate up front highly carbonated on the palate and believe it or not hops are still present. Finish is all roast and a slight burn from the alcohol but no real alcohol flavor. A top notch porter. FFF does it again."
"Thanks again Nelson!"
"Dark brown color, with a fair amount of carbonation. This is a hop bomb with dark roasted malts. Hops overpower everything else here, which seem (though tough to tell through the hop smoke screen) to be the usual coffee and chocolate notes you'd except from a deep roasted porter. Medium/thick body and medium carbonation."
"D - A very interesting and extremely well made porter. I straddle the line between the hop-head and malt-head camps, but for the style I think that this is a little bit ridiculously overhopped. Definitely not a bad beer by any stretch, and I think those who love burnt roasted bitterness wl love this more than I do. Drinkablility suffers at the hands of too much hop bitterness and burnt-charred notes."
"D - This is quite possibly the best porter that I've ever had! Just and amazing blend of flavors."
"I wish Three Floyds had a regular porter I could get instead of having to wait until December each year. I'm not sure it's worth stashing as the hops will probably fade by March."
"Smooth and a great variety of flavors. Big malts with a big hop profile. Light carbonation and a nice chocolate goodness that leads you through the taste sensation. Well done, this is a solid brew."
"I grew to like this beer more and more while making my way through the 650ml bomber. The extra bit of alcohol never seemed to catch up with me and the flavours became ever more decadent with a delicious dark caramel taste coming forth with warmth. Like I've thought of everything else I've tried by Three Floyds: this is wonderful and definitely recommended."
"Thanks to ahatcher and the Brewgrass BIF for this wonderful beer."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Medium roast coffee and the surprising presence of citrusy hops, which doesn't taste as bad as it sounds. Not as sweet as the aroma suggests, has more of a baker's chocolate sort of quality to it. I was expecting this to be overcarbonated, but the mouthfeel hits the mark for the style quite well; medium bodied, not quite stout thick, and pleasantly dry in the finish."
"This stuff is unlike any other Porter I've tried. I had this one last March or so and the hops were not nearly as present as they are now when it's fresh. Get some of this stuff, very unique and excellent."
"D: Very light and drinkable. If I was trying to evaluate this brew as a regular porter, it may disappoint me in some ways. If I think of it as a hybrid of porter and seasonal Xmas ale, it becomes a very unique and enjoyable experience. It felt right for the season which I think is a very important factor. It offered the comfort of a porter with the optimism of hops - a really nice change. As a malt head that has developed a hop addiction, I find this beer to be extremely enjoyable. The higher than usual ABV didn't hurt either. Happy holidays!"
"(On tap at Sonka's Irish Pub, Terre Haute, IN)"
"D: The unique taste alone is enough to keep you coming back for more, time and time again. But the balance displayed by such an incredibly hopped up porter makes this beer a thing of beauty."
"D - This was quite good - excellent actually. Among the best in a style that I really enjoy. Pretty easy drinking considering the ABV."
"D= Very solid and drinkable Baltic porter here. As I drank this one, I wished the roasted grain bitterness was just a tiny bit less, but otherwise its spot on for a big porter. Very drinkable!"
"Overall: good enough"
"Drinkability- Very much a sessionable beer if you're into porters."
"D: This is a nice sipper - but it could be an all night sipper."
"Overall this is one of the better porters that I've had. Everything worked very well together and there are no off flavors. Definitely give this one a shot."
"Pours a beautiful opache black with a thick frothy tan head. Aroma of coffee, chocolate, pine, sugar and grapefruit. The flavor pretty much mimics the aroma only with the malts making more of a statement. Finishes a long dry hoppy/coffee/chocolate. Medium to large bodied."
"Pours a deep cola color with a thin white head. Head leaves a small amount of lacing but nothing too sticky.Smells slighlt of spice and chocolate. The hops show up but are masked by the roasted malt aroma. Tastes wonderful! Just the right balance of hops and ""Christmas beer"" taste but what do you expect from FFF? Mouthfeel is normal for a porter. Doesn't hang around too long after the swallow. Fairly drinkable. Good to share with a friend as the whole bomber may be a little rich."
"D- This beer drink pretty good."
"Notes: This bottle is probably not indicative of a fresh one. I will have to trade out for a fresh one and review it. Pretty nice beer, just possibly faded a little."
"D- probably my favorite american porter to date. i cant wait to have it fresh later this year. this is the sort of beer id be more than happy drinking all night. three floyds comes through once again. recommended."
"Drinkability is high here if only I could procure lots of this stuff locally."
"Pours a dark brown color with a light tan head. Smells of a bit of smoke, roasted nuts, licorice. Tastes of coffee, chocolate,licorice, smoke, roasted malt and nuts, and a touch of hops, but not overwhelming. Overall, a nice combination of flavors. Perfect amount of carbonation and very drinkable."
"Tastes similar- delicious and full flavored. Could be mistaken for mouthfeel of an oatmeal or coffee stout. Good coffee and burnt malt flavor. Good biting finish as well. Lots of flavor in this one- not a thin porter whatsoever. I am almost unhappy I shared this beer!!"
"I could drink this all winter, and it seems particularly well suited for the pseudo-colder winter months of SoCal... may I find this in my stocking every year!"
"D-I would have hogged the whole bomber if they had let me. This review should also be considered an ISO for Alpha Klaus Porter."
"D- A slow sipper, but definately drinkable (AND delicious)"
"D: This is one of the better porters I've had in a while and it is certainly drinkable. Highly recommended!"
"An excellent beer. Pours dark mahogany and opaque. Vanilla and sweet oak on the nose. Mouthfeel & Taste is perfect. Just enough body and full of flavor. This sample had been in the fridge for quite a long time which could of added some mellowness. Excellent overall and a beer I could drink all day long, even on a hot summer day!"
"D : An excellent beer that I plan on finding more of. It's an easy one to drink."
"Mou"
"Great beer."
"This beer reminds me of Mexican hot chocolate minus the cinnamon. I wish I was drinking it in December and not June. I find many porters way too thin and lacking flavor. This is one of the few that delivers!"
"I decided to break in my new Terrapin 22oz snifter with the Three Floyds Alpha Klaus. The beer pours black with a frothy tan head that leaves a nice cap on top of the body while providing ample amounts of lace. The aroma delivers an interesting mix of bittersweet chocolate and spicy citrusy hops. The taste hits you with the bittersweet chocolate up front, followed by a citrusy hop aroma and then finished with a residual milk chocolate sweetness. The body is between medium and full with a full amount of carbonation that only adds to the body. This is an interesting spin on the porter style. It is quite strong in the dark roasted malt character along with a significant hop presence. I would expect a sweeter and more chocolaty presence in a porter, but Three Floyds take on the style is certainly interesting and tasty."
"Got a bottle of this one from a friend at the Wine Specialist. Pours a pitch black color with extremely hard to find brown highlights. Solid head that leaves fairly weak lacing. Nose is nice: huge roasted malt, coffee, and some light chocolate. Also very mild hops. Taste is as advertised. Huge roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, a strong piney hop flavor as well, that quickly transforms into a consistent bitter lemon (actually quite similar to the other Three Floyds brews I've had). Good body with solid carbonation. Overall, quite a tasty beer, although not as earth-shattering as I'd expected (I think BA got my hops for FFF up a little too high - I've been let down by everything except for the Alpha King). Quite good though, irrespective of my expectations."
"D- pretty damn good"
"One of the best porters I've had to date. I've only had this one with some age on it but it is excellent."
"Ok, but I was expecting more from Three Floyds. The hops do not really blend that well here."
"Pours a solid black with a creamy off white head that sticks around for a while before attaching itself to the sides of my glass. Aroma is chocolate, bitter roasted malts, throw in a slight alcohol aroma as well. Tastes of chocolates and coffees, reminds me more of a stout than a porter, but that line is so blurry these days. Smooth creamy mouthfeel with a hint of hops in the finish. Ample carbonation. Solid brew all around."
"This was a wonderful surprise! A porter unlike any I've had so far. Chocolaty, yet hoppy; thick, but not syrupy. An overall fantastic brew. One that I'll be looking for again. Huge thanks to younger35 for the opportunity!"
"Wow, this is definitley one of thee finest Porters I've had, American or not. I especially loved the use of the hops, which gave the aroma and taste a lively take on things that perfectly complimented some of the other tried and true flavors. Complex and hugely drinkable, this is definitely a winner in my book."
"HV"
"Pours a very deep black with a decent off white head. Nose is quite robust with coffee and roasted malt. Roasted malt dominates here, but coffee makes a small appearance. A good bitterness on the finish. Would like to see that mellow a bit with age. alcohol is relatively well hidden. mouthfeel is good, could be just a bit more viscous. Drinkability is quite good, especially since this guy is a little bit amped up at 7.5% Overall a fantastic porter, one I will surely trade for again, and put a little age on to see what happens. Should be good. Is already quite spectacular fresh. Good beer."
"Sat down last night with a couple of friends and a 22 oz bomber of Alpha Klaus. Poured into a large Medieval Times glass which resembled something halfway between a weizen glass and a tulip. Worked well enough. Appearance was at first a deep, impenetrable brownish black with a dense tan head that subsided rather quickly. Smell largely consisted of a floral hop bouquet that instantly lets you know you're about to quaff a FFF brew...even so, I was expecting a bit more from the nose given the dark and intriguing appearance. Taste followed smell in the hops department, but also revealed a roasty malt and subtle dark chocolate character that gave way to some alcoholic presence. Mouthfeel was smooth and lightly creamy, with enough carbonation to make it lively. I didn't have any trouble finishing the entire bomber by myself, and I'm a pretty small guy, but I don't think I would drink this on a regular basis. I can see this being nice on a cold Christmas eve near the fireplace, but as far as regular consumption is concerned, I'll take a Sinebrychoff, please."
"This is a dynamite chocolatey-roasted, hopped up, spiced up, porter. Sure do love this stuff."
"Drinkability- A very nice unique spin on a Porter that really takes the whole hopped up Porter to the next level. Dangerously drinkable for 7.5% ABV I'm really enjoying this thing immensely, maybe to immensely. I couldn't be any more pleased that a couple more bombers are sitting at my local brew store waiting for my consumption (I traded for this when I stilled live din the North West). Big thanks to Matt for another great beer!"
"If you like baltic porters you will probably like this one, but i cannot drink them."
"Overall, simply a wonderful porter!"
"3 Floyd's keep doing what you do. I'm lovin' it!"
"Someone send me a growler of this stuff next season. Too easy. :)"
"The hoppiness turned me off a bit, and there isn't much spiciness for something that is labeled a winter beer."
"Pours black with a hint of ruby edges. Big lasting tan head. Smell is damn near perfect, and unmatched by pretty much any porter I've had. Very big roasty malt, slight coffee, some mild sweetness and mild noticeable hops in there as well. Very aromatic and fantastic nose. Nice roasty character. balanced mild sweetness and slightly drying and bittering hops. The hops are just bordering on too much for a porter, but never really get there. Moderate to mildly rich mouthfeel. Hoppy for the style but it works. Soft carbonation and a nice overall uniqueness makes this a must try."
"The smell was roasty - definitely hoppy with some coffee and roasted flavors. The hops added a new dimension to this porter, but felt overpowering. I wonder if it needs mellowing out, or if it's meant to be had fresh. It's definitely sweet and bitter to dry. I'd drink it again, but during the season. It's a seasonal beer for sure, as it's name implies."
"D - Very good drinkability. Unique with athe hopload of an IPA and the roasty porter character."
"D- This one is a bit heavy for a porter but still highly drinkable. In my opinion three floyds often doesn't live up to the hype but I have to admit this one was excellent."
"Wasn't really a huge fan of this one...too much hop for me sullying up the big maltiness. There's a fine line between balanced and lopsided and I think this one leans too much on the hops."
"D- Overall a well crafted beer but I have lost all the porter notes in this to an alpha taste that I cannot shake from my palate. I want more malt which isn't there. Better on the first few sips than the last of the beer."
"D_Outstanding, as usual from Three Floyds. I could drink a few of these on a cold blustery night."
"Alpha Klaus Xmas porter is a good one. Sometimes I don't like porters that are over-hopped, but this one suits me just fine."
"Have been wanting to try this since I initially got into craft beer, did not disappoint and was even better than I thought it would be, one of the better porters I have ever had, wish this was a year round release and available in my area but neither of those is a possibility, I would love to drink this again some time, highly recommended"
"Pours a very dark brown in color. There was at least a two inch head sitting atop this beer. Smell is subdued hops and some chocolate malt. Taste is much more of the malt with a little bitterness as well. There is a grassy and pine flavor of course coming from the hops. Pretty decent medium full on the mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: This may be the best porter I have tried. Very smooth and not too heavy. The nice addition of a hoppy characteristic at the back end really adds a nice touch to the roasted sweetness you expect from the style. The complexity is what puts it head and shoulders above others. Highly recommeded to see what a porter can be."
"D: Ladies and gentlemen, this is a damned fine porter. My only criticism is that it could be a little more bubbly, but are we gonna split hairs here? Am I wrong?"
"dark brown/pitch black. creamy brown head/lacing. head diminishes, but lacing persists. light shows clarity and no sediment or particles. aromas of dark chocolate, coffee, raisins, molassess, and a liquer-like alcohol. american hop presence is prominent yet vague-spuce? taste is chocolaty sweet malts with a significant underlying hop bitterness and roastiness cleaning it out. full-bodied, somewhat viscous, with a nice lingering, smooth, bitter and roasty finish. nice creamy carbonation. this is a complex sipper with warming qualities. drinks bigger than it is."
"M/D: Full bodied, slightly creamy, carbonation is light. Drinkability is really good on this one. Makes me think of an IPA with roasted malt. My first FFFs brew, very impressed."
"D - Very smooth. Not a lot of alcohol in the taste. Nice creamy porter with an obvious hop presence."
"Very drinkable beer"
"D - overall a great porter from FFF and an interesting interpretation of the style that makes me want to keep having a sip after a sip to experience all of the interesting taste within this one. there are just so many different flavors in the porter that I keep wanting to discover. I love how this is like a mix of a hop bomb and a sweet porter too; gotta love the FFF boldness. Also, the creamy milky aspect makes it really easy to sip down and enjoy. I will pick this up every holiday season and enjoy it whenever it comes out. Also I have to say this is much better than the barrel aged Klaus since you can actually taste the hop profile that makes this such an interesting brew."
"An excellent beer. I just think I still prefer Top Sail."
"Good beer all around. Would make a great everyday drinking beer except it's not available year round."
"Cocoa on the first wave of taste, with a supple body of hops and delicious malt with a nice hoppy finish. As with most beers from 3F, no skimp on hop flavor. Absolutely delicious and very thankful to land a few bottles this year."
"Pours deep dark brown, almost black, with a off-white head that holds a decent cap throughout the glass. Aroma is a great mix of big hops and big roast malt character. Flavor is very much the same, with the hops coming up front, followed closely by a big roast malt flavor, with lots of coffee like notes. Body is medium."
"Glad I got to try this. I could see myself having a couple of these once or twice a year. There was a little too much sweetness and that could get a bit cloying after 22oz. A nice solid beer that is certainly different than any other porter I have ever had. Originality points but point detractions for ""style"" purposes."
"Pours dark brown with some garnet notes. Decent head that fadesa little quickly. Still, its a pretty beer. Smells a bit sugary but this is balanced by nice roasty and chocolate notes. The taste is beautifully balanced between candi sugar, citrusy hops, and chocolate. Their is a very slightly metallic finish, but that is not too unusual in a porter and it doesn't distract from the brew. Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly sweet without being sticky. Delicious- its the candi sugar that adds a sweet note that makes this beer. Also,its a nice change of pace from all the winter warmers around."
"Overall an excellent beer, and worth the hype for sure."
"d - terrific beer."
"This is Three Floyds winter offering for the holiday season. This beer pours with a dark almost opaque viscosity. Hints of chocolate and roasted flavors. A subtle hop flavor that fits to the porter style. Very drinkable beer for the winter season. I was also lucky enough to try this beer at the brewery"
"beautiful dark porter with a thick, tan head that stcks around well and leaves great lace. chocolate, toasty malt, piney hop and a touch of oak and maybe coffee in the nose. tastes of milk chocolate, then hops, with a mildly bitter dark chocolate and coffee finish. big body for a porter and very, very tasty. one of if not the best porter i've had to date."
"Pours a full black body with a one finger light khaki colored head. Good lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell is pretty nutty up front with a nice hop bite. Sweet caramel malts with a smokey oak aroma. Fresh coffee grounds find their way in the nose towards the end. This is a really wonderful smelling brew, by far the most complex porter I've stuck my nose into. Charred wood flavors to begin with which is followed by molasses and brown sugar. A mocha french roast flavor midway blended with mild pine hops as well. Aftertaste is a nice roasted barley with a hint of hazelnut. Mouthfeel is medium to full with a somewhat weak carbonation, almost water-like. I found this extremely drinkable, and just a notch above GL's Edmund Fitzgerald IMO."
"Let this one warm up to let it all out, its a delicious beer that only gets better as you drink it... how can it get any better than that!?"
"Overall a pretty great beer. Good for the cold weather and very well crafted."
"D - Good beer. Great for a seasonal. Slightly more body than I would have expected from a porter. Most porters I have tried are definitely medium bodied, this was a little more than that."
"Poured a deep thick dark brown with ruby edges, some elusive light sneaks through. The nose is filled with chocolate, roasted malt, smoke, earthy pine, and whiffs of alcohol. First sip carried right off the smell, with up front notes of smoky strong bittersweet chocolate, bold roasted malts and dark grains, and strong hoppiness, finishing with a light porter-type mustiness that fades to an unmistakable well hopped bitterness. Good body with a balance of consistency and stickiness. Extremely drinkable - goes down smooth but not too heavy. An outstanding winter release."
"I've also enjoyed this bottled, so don't feel bad if you can't find this on tap anywhere. The experience is just as good at home, provided you give it the respect it deserves by enjoying it slowly with friends."
"This is a great choice for the holidays and another reason to go to Indiana, not that there is many, but this is one."
"Had this on-tap. Dark, dark black color with hints of brown and orange. No head, but a little bit of thin froth floating around on top. Smell was intriguing. I was not expecting this strong of a hop presence in a porter. Chocolate, toffee, caramel, and coffee all made their expected appearances, but the hops caught me off guard. They were fresh and piny. Interesting. After tasting it, I was more than grateful for the strong hop presence. Added a very nice balance to the strong malt backbone. After the first sip, I could not help but immediately look at the drink in admiration. Medium bodied and extremely drinkable. I think I may have found a holiday tradition. A porter for hopheads."
"Taste of chocolate and hops upfront, a little bit of a hop bite too. Theres also a good dose of coffee flavors and roasted malt, charred wood, and bitter chocolate. Very aggressive flavors going on for a porter."
"Smell, and flavor, are of roasted chocolate, some coffee, a bit of piney-ness/hops, and a surprising amount of smoke. For a non-smoked porter, it was heavily laden. By the end of the bottle, it was a bit much, but this was still a very, very good beer."
"My sentiments exactly.... Unmatched in the porter realm to this point. I do have an Olfabrikken waiting on me in the fridge so we'll see how they stack up against one another."
"Overall right up my alley with a very strong after taste - not that it is a bad thing."
"Overall one of the best porters Ive had in a while. The only rival Ive tried recently would have to be Arcadias shipwreck porter which works with bourbon barrel ageing so hats off o them. But this is a reat coffee porter and a must try for this holiday season. Prosit!"
"Poured a dark cola brown but black in appearance. Khaki head that reduces to some sticky lacing. The first initial aroma is chocolate and piney hops. As it warmed, a black liquorish (Jagermeister) scent appeared. After my sip I tasted chocolate, coffee, roasty malt and burnt carmel. Finishes with some crisp citrus piney hops. Perfectly balanced. Mouth feel is creamy then oily and coating. Good carbonation. Overall drinkability is excellent. Full flavored without being over powering. AVB is well hidden. Highly recommend!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, chewy, smooth and creamy. Spot on for a porter, it never gets too heavy. Quite a drinkable brew and one I always look forward to imbibing in large quantities around this time of year. Glad to see it on the shelves again. I give this one my approval yet again...go get a few bombers!!"
"Overall, certainly a nice and respectable porter, but not something I would really go out of my way for. I've found other FFF beers more enjoyable."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a sweet chocolate scent along with a stiff hop bitterness. It's rich with roasted and black malts as well. The taste is great. It has a crisp black malt and hop bitterness up front and then it mellows with a sweet chocolatey finish. It warms a bit, but that only increases the enjoyment of it. This is a very flavorful porter. It has a bountiful wealth of flavor and an excellent arrangement of hops. The mouthfeel is awesome. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is one tastey beverage. I guess I shouldn't be surprised. These guys only produce nothing but the best."
"Pours black with ruby highlights when held to the light, the most rediculous amount of head Ive seen and slow to die before it laces, dammit it spilled over a little. Wheres the warning label Wowza! Awesome smells of some floral...hops perhaps? roasted malt, molasses, chocolate coffee? This is a treat to the senses. Tastes every bit as good as it smells with a little spice and a carousel of flavors. Medium in the mouth with some nice carbonation. Drinkability? I could make quite a night out of these. Went in with good expectations, came out a believer. Cant wait to try a fresh one."
" Overall I was really impressed with this. You could tell that a lot of work had gone into it as it was just almost too complex to accurately describe. I was like a kid in a candy shop with this one. Just really fantastic. I would gladly come though with more of this anyday, but will more then likely wait until the winter, as with it being this hot, its just a bit too big for the summer. But really awesome and deserves the reputation that it has. If only three floyds were closer!"
"When I popped the cap and took a whiff I knew this was going to be very, very good. This beer was black with a foamy, mocha colored head. It wasn't pitch black as some red tints could be seen if held up to the light. The smell was really sweet and enticing with a subtle aroma of roasted coffee beans. The taste, WOW! The taste was very chocolatey, sweet, roasty, coffee-like, amazing. The hops were also noticeable in the back and the aftertaste, almost minty. I have to buy several bottles of this when it is released, I can't believe how good this was."
"Can't wait to try again the Dark Lord, Dreadnaught, Gumballhead, Behomthe Blonde, Robert the Bruce and Alpha King though. I have been fortunate enough to try many of the hard to find (in the West) beers from 3F, and I want more"
"Drinkability: Once you can get past the monumental head, it's a very drinkable porter indeed. Great flavor combinations and a few differentiating characteristics make this one that holds your interest."
"I love this beer. Pushes the envelope of a porter. Smells of chocolate, hops, and deep malts. Pours a beautiful wood brown with a one finger head. Begs to be drank immediately. At the forefront of haute beer where the smell influences the taste. Coffee tastes, with outstanding hops, alcohol tastes that deepen as you drink it down. Smell vanilla towards the end. What an amazing beer. Long coating lingering aftertastes, I dont want to see more of clones like this, this one is enough. Three Floyds have a good thing going and I want more."
"This is a very drinkable beer and at 7.5 abv it won't kill you to have a few. Very enjoyable."
"D: Very nice beer all-around. Heavy without being overwhelming. A sipper for certain, and an extremely enjoyable one - well-balanced, filled with flavor, a treat to look at. Would love to have this again - highly recommended!"
"Overall, a very interesting beer to say the least. If you gave this beer to someone without telling them what it was, its a 10-1 shot they would say its a porter. I dug this beer only for it being unique, I wouldn't buy it again anytime soon and could never finish a whole bomber on my own."
"D- This is not a thick, heavy porter rather one of wonderful balance and lightness though full of flavor. This really is easy to drink and should hold well for years to come."
"D: This is a damn good porter, but at $9 a pop, it's only good enough to have as an occasional treat."
"D- Quite easy to knock back oz. after oz. as I could have drank the whole bottle had I not been sharing with other beer lovers."
"Easily my favorite porter. FFF has a winner here. Much more complex and drinkable than most porters I've tried. Well worth seeking this one out."
"I'm amazed. I was underwhelmed by all FFF beers I've had so far (for the most part), but this one did it for me. For an imperial porter, Alpha Klaus delivers and then some - whether it's a cold day or not."
"The combination of the hops and bitter ending leave me with an impression that this is a ""lighter"" drinking porter. The 7.5 ABV is well hidden. I highly recommend this one."
"And as far as drinkability, I could session these. If there had been more of them, and I hadn't had to drive a friend home, I would have."
"overall this beer is amazing one of the best ones ive had truly a great beer"
"This is an awesome, awesome beer. This beer could convert anyone to a hophead, but the beautiful thing is that it doesn't have to-- the malt backbone is more than strong enough to withstand a year of cellaring (I think.)"
"I've been saving this beer for the right occasion where I can properly enjoy this beer, and this afternoon in front of March Madness is it."
"This was my first Three Floyds purchase. Naturally, I had heard a lot of the brewery, so when I came across a case of this at the Beer Yard, I couldn't pass it up. At any rate...pours a beautiful dark opaque brown with rusty highlights around the edges. Super soft, light brown head that has a wonderful thickness to it. Looks like something I'd want to put on top of some chocolate cake. Smells immediately like I'm in a backwoods hop patch. And, unfortunately, I hate to be cliche, but it does smell like Christmas. Super, smooth creamy mouthfeel transports a huge delivery of roasty, chocolatey, caramel malt into the palate. Not too far behind is the surprising hop presence. Very hoppy for a porter. I even has a bit of that stringent porter character, which I'm not always a fan of, but its pulled off with perfection here. I'm assuming its the other flavors that balancecd it. The beer finishes with a nice dry touch and a lingering aftertaste of dry, dark cocoa powder. Man, this stuff is just amazing, its unlike any other porter I've had."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This is a very good, smooth beer. I'd probably be hard pressed to drink more than one bomber, but two might be possible. Overall, very nice offering from Three Floyds. Highly recommended."
"The mouth is medium bodied, rather light compared to some porters. It deomonstrates solid complexity, lighter and cherry-like on the tip of the tongue, then dries nicely on the luscious finish. A tip o' the cap sirs."
"Mmm, mmm, Alpha Claus XMas Porter is one tasty porter! Dinkability borders on ridiculous. Check the BeerSpy for where I found it; there were still a few left as of this past Sunday."
"Poured this big beer from bottle to tumbler at 48 degrees. BE CAREFUL with this beer. It has like pepsi amounts of carbination in it. Poured a mountain oh head, big lumpy brown biscuit head. I actually floated a potato chip on top of it. Smell oozing from this mass of foam was nutty and sweet. Taste was also nutty with big amounts of roasted coffee and a little peaty. I thought the carbination was a little over the top but all in all it is a fine porter. maybe a little heavy for a porter though. I would call it a stout. i will buy again."
"Acquired via trade with Viggo. Thanks man!! This is a beer with a lot going on. Holy crap! Unbelievable hop nose to this beer- just like an IPA. Not what I expected for a porter. I can also smell chocolate and a little smoke. Decent initial head that fades away quickly. Color is dark rich porter. First sip is of oily hops with a chocolate background. This is as oily as some of the larger barelywines Ive had. Thats a real feat for a 7.5% porter! Even though theres a shitload of hops here- they are not out of place. NOt overly astringent, just a flavourable balance with the sweetness of the malt. The malt is very rich and reminds me somewhat of a impy stout moreso than a traditional porter. no matter- it is delicious. At first I thought this would be a real slow sipper, but I really gained speed plowing through this treat. First rate brew- hope to try again one day."
"A nice blackish color with brown highlights and a light tan head that fades quickly. It smells both hoppy and malty, with some sweet notes. The taste starts hoppy and malty with the sweet up front. The balance in flavor is great, giving you everything you want from the dark beer characteristics, but also satisfying the hops that I crave. The finish is hoppy with the bitter following in the aftertaste begging for another sip. A delicious beer, with a great balance in flavor and mouthfeel. This one has a lighter body for a dark beer, but still has great powerful flavor and a great balance. This one is not the easiest to drink, but great for those that love flavor. Enjoy!"
"Drinkability is awesome. This is one hell of a beer and it's hard to put down (as in stop drinking)"
"Drinkability is good but this beer requires some concentration to fully enjoy. It is very flavorful but almost too heavy to drink in large quantities."
"Drinkability - Wonderful. I could drink a lot of this (I wish I had more.) I bet it would be tasty if aged with cherries."
"A very good beer just a little more hops than I expected from a porter. One that carrys a well hidden kick while being drank, color looked right for a porter but both flavor and mouthfeel seemed off from what I expect. Maybe the flaw is in the reviewer but not one of the FFF I'll buy again."
"Pours a dark black with just a glimpse of ruby highlights. Tan head starts big but reduces to some spotty lacing. Nice depth in the nose...smoked aromas, roasted coffee and fresh spicy hop character. Super velvety smooth mouthfeel and low carbonation. Tastes are of dark chocolate, roasted malts, strong espresso tones, dry chariness, and balanced excellently balanced by a hefty amount of hops providing mostly esters and bittering character. The hops fruity notes are sweet and sour at times giving this a well rounded profile. Towards the end buttery caramel and spearmint notes are clearer. Some alcohol burn slips through but no way considered unenjoyable. The finish is much of the taste coming through with a higher dry, tart character. Coffee and chocolate notes coming through in a big way here and I might even suggest this as breakfast beer."
"SuperBowl XLI"
"D - A straight forward beer that is truly enjoyable. A nice 3 Floyds twist on the porter style."
"Many thanks to Mac300 for a truly great trade for this brew..Prosit MK"
"Pours very dark brown in color with some ruby highlights and a short creamy tan head that coats the sides of the glass with webs of lace as you drink. Nose is rich chocolaty malts blended nicely with floral piney hops. Underneath the dominate aromas, there are additional notes of cinnamon and a hint of candied ginger. Quite sniffable! Taste has some milk chocolate sweetness, a roasted coffee bitterness, and a good amount of spicy hops all balanced together fabulously. A wonderful American Christmas porter."
"The 2005 has lost almost all of its hop smell and smells like a traditional porter: dark roasted malts, chocolate, java. Taste follows the smell, almost no hops in the profile....it is all malt. The mouthfeel is on the thin side, but still nice. Drinkability is good, but I think I definitely prefer this one fresh. It is not bad with a year of age, but it kind of tastes average. The fresh beer is definitely better and very interesting. It is amazing the difference between the two after just a year."
"Mouthfeel was full bodied, heavier than I would expect from a traditional porter. Prickly carbonation teased the tastebuds. This is one of my favorite seasonal/Christmas beers. Seek this one if you can think outside rigid definitions, this is not your ""normal"" porter."
"This is certainly stretching the boundaries of what a porter is. I'm not sure what I would call it, but I like it. An Imperial India Porter? Don't try anything light or mild after this one. Only complaint, and this is with a year of age, is that the alcohol is quite strong and may interfere with other flavors/scents. Would have guessed it to be higher than 7.5% (thought about 10)."
"D: Another winner from 3F. This is a great, unique beer that seizes the holiday feel very well. Not so heavy that I couldn't drink a lot of it either."
"D: Another great one from 3F. Amazing brews they have and this isn't any different. Smooth and silky"
"Pours a black color, nice carbonation, nice creamy tan head which lasts for quite awhile, very nice sticky lacing throughout the drink. The nose is of slight sweet malts, slight vanilla, and coffee/caramel. The taste follows the nose pretty much, their is a nice bitter finish. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice offering from 3Fs."
"A dark brown color with hints of red at that bottom of the glass. A half inch beige, creamy head forms, that sloly dissolves down the glass. At first scent a strong chocolate malt aroma, then this striking scent of hops come through with piney and grassy aromas. A deep chocolaty flavor wraps itself on the palate, then the hops come foward and that hop flavor lingers there long after the beer is swallowed. An oily texture, that does coat the palate, is slight chewy at the end. Again Three Floyds makes another great beer, that brings strong flavor. That flavor is not to overbearing and I will just sit back and enjoy the rest of this very well made beer."
"Poured from bomber into nonic, nice sticky looking off white head that dissipates into little more than a film, and leaves little thin lacing. Body is musty black brown, almost opaque except when held up to light then the typical ruby is apparent and I can see the figure of my hand. Smells immediately of typical Three Floyds hop bouquet, with a chocolate underbody or backbone, hints of coffee, cocoa, pine, there is a mild roasted nutty character to this, and hidden bits of vanilla. I think as this warms the hop character mellows out or maybe I just adapt to it. Its strange one minute I feel the hop character is in competition with the dark malts and then the next Im fine with the balance, its sort of a strange brew that way. The taste is reminiscent of dry roast coffee, with an underlying smokey nuttiness, that then exposes a slightly milky chocolateness with little hints of vanilla and then turns back to roasted coffee. The bitterness in the flavor is very nice especially as it warms not over bearing. Personally this could be a little more robust, I enjoyed this beer a great deal, but its not quite what I had hoped for still tasty just the same I'm sure I'll grab a bottle next year."
"Poured from a 22oz bomber with no bottling information. Was basically black with some burgundy deep in the color. Had a 1/4"" inch cocoa head that slowly whittled to a constant film. The smell was heavy on the roasted malts - very and of course the hops. Mouthfeel was pretty good but wanted just a little more creamy. The taste was excellent. Goes down very smooth with a not too bitter finish. It's been recent that I've started to enjoy porters so can't wait to try this again next year to see if I love it even more. For now, it's good to have the one bottle and then try again so just 4 on drinkability but sure it will rise in the future. Highly recommend especially if you like porters. (4, RR, T, Y)"
"Pours cola brown to black in color with a coffee and cream colred head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a nice roasty and chocolate smell, sweet sugary and buttery chocolate. There is also a lemon and orange acidic smell as well as some coffee, but the smooth chocolate aroma dominates. Taste is fruit and chocolate. There is some twangy citrus acidity on the back of the tongue while a smooth chocolate flavors slides underneath on the front of the palette. Finishes with a slightly dry and bitter mixture of roasted malts and chocolate. Medium to heavy in body, there is a nice tingly that helps to break it up. No problem with 22oz, a very chocolatey and rich porter."
"Have to admit that I liked this stuff. I would drink more of it. However, I would consider labeling the bottles ""IPA"" before putting them in the fridge. I knocked the smell, taste and drinkability some points because I was turned off as a porter lover, though not as a beer drinker. It doesn't taste like much more than the usual Three Floyds hops profile."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a minimal 1/4"" brown head above the almost opaque dark brown brew. Head is quickly down to an uneven layer of bubbles, with plenty of sticky delicate lacing. Aroma is sweet and roasty, with hoppy notes too. Taste is rich chocolatey sweetness coupled with plenty of piney hops. Mouthfeel is a tad on the flattish side, but drinkability remains excellent. A classic I enjoying revisiting each year during the holiday season."
"Purchased in spring 2006 so I assume this is the Christmas 2005 release. Pours totally opaque black with a thick tan head which heavily laces the glass. Beautiful. Smell is big roasted burnt malt and citrusy hops. Taste is much like the smell. Dark roasted malt dominates. Coffee. Big citrus grapefruity hops offset the malt taste. Heavy mouthfeel coats the mouth. Overall pretty nice stuff. Most definitely tastey and gets better as it warms. This reminds me a lot of 3F's Black Sun Stout, although maybe my memory of that beer is fading somewhat."
"Mouthfeel is rich and velvety, definitely a sipper. One bottle per sitting, usually a rare occasion around here..."
"A dark brown offering with a foamy, light brown head. Surprisingly strong, piney hops in the nose, along with roasted coffee beans. The taste is full of thick, luscious roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate, French roast coffee, and more crisp, chewy hops. The hops really make this beer stand out - despite all the rich, thick roasted flavors, you can still taste and get a nose full of the IPA-like dry hopped elements. Very smooth and nicely chewy. Quite possibly the best porter I've ever had."
"Great drinkability, great layered flavors that blend nicely, never would have guessed 7.5abv if I hadn't looked at the label. Great balance between nice flavorful malts and nice floral and citrus hops."
"Brownish black in color leaves a big light brown head at first which quickly fades into a small small layer of bubbles with a good level of lacing. Smells immediately are of coffee and chocolate, with some caramel, roasted malt, and citrus hops upon further inspection. Taste is bitter of chocolate and coffee at first, with some caramel, malt, and sugar afterwards. A nice subtle hop finish makes this a well rounded brew. Full in body with a little bit of a dryness. I'm not big on porters, but because I wanted to try it for Christmas, I picked it up. I haven't met a Three Floyds beer I didn't enjoy yet, and this one is no different. Very easy to drink and very sessionable."
"Sampled at 40 degrees and 65 degrees, the more toward room temp it got, the bigger the greenapple carmel/coffee roast got. Soft light brown head, very dark in color, an exceptional beer. The porter base was well chosen."
"Drinkability - this is very good, and it can be sessionable."
"This is an outstanding American porter and probably the best I've had to date."
"Thanks a lot sman262 for sending this my way."
"D: Very tasty, goes down easy, not very filling and the ABV is very well hidden, this is the perfect beer to sit and chill out with if you’re looking for something that’s a little bit more than just a sipper."
"D: A nice combination of flavors, with chocolate, sugars and hops all making appearances. It's too warm outside (despite it being mid-December, it is near 50) to properly enjoy this. It goes best in front of a fire on a cold snowy night."
"This is an interesting brew. Pours a nice head, creamy and chocolatey. Dark chocolate looking almost opaque black. Very full mouthfeel. Smells of dark chocolate and tons of hops. Very odd to have these hops in this brew. Leaves good lacing and is a nice refreshing beer."
"I've had the good fortune to try this years batch on draft at FFF and in bottled form. I have to say i prefer the bottled version. In my opinion, at FFF, they serve this too cold with too much carbonation."
"This is the first pint that I enjoyed at the Three Floyds brewpub. It was presented in an English pint glass. Dark brown with a huge dense rocky head that didnt want to go away. The nose was all hops. Amarillos if I had to guess. Some chocolate and roast flavor. A touch sweet, but the hops were the feature act here too. A bit on the thinner side. Overall, Alpha Klause did not live up to expectations."
"The mouthfeel is creamy without succumbing to excessive thickness and doesn't sit as heavy as one might imagine. This is just a killer beer. Killer."
"Overall- A porter I've been looking for, for quite some time. Definitely worth it! This should be offered all year!!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Adequately creamy and light in the mouth. The beer's duration of being alive and exciting could be longer, but it's good nonetheless. A satisfying porter that pushes the envelope to go further... but don't try too hard, as the style would be lost completely. Much hops, now I must sleep."
"Drinkability: this is simply a great beer. Alcohol is barely noticeable. One of my favorites."
"Final verdict, a really good beer. Not like any porter I've had. Maybe not something I'd crave every day, but for the cold night I was drinking it on while homebrewing, this was perfect. I paid $9 for this bottle though which I think is entirely to much. I do dislike that about 3 Floyds. I can't blame them, with the demand they have it's more than understandable. Just hard to know I could have bought 2 Old Viscosity's for the price of this, which is a much better beer."
"D - This is an excellent staple for any fan of ""colder weather beers"" with some nice backbone. At 7.5%, it's also feasible to knock off a bomber on your own without getting whacked. An excellently hoppy take on a traditionally mildly hopped style."
"A wonderful warming and relaxing winter porter."
"a great american porter. not worth mortgaging the house over but if you see it, definitely pick up a bottle."
"I am not a porter guy, or stout for that matter, so I could not drink this all the time, but I am glad I tried this, because it was full of flavor, some of which I am still trying to peg."
"Mouth of fluffy dark water that is only reminiscent of coffee, and I'm so glad to have bought a bottle instead of a case."
"cheers..."
"Quite a beer. Pours a black-as-night color with a brown tint to the medium-sized head. Smell is close to non-existant, but is a bit like coffee and dark malts. The taste is huge. It seems monolithic at first sip, but as you continue down with the bottle you start to notice the subtle complexites that make it the BA 91 rated that it is. Whats nice about it is that nothing really jumps out at you. The taste of the dark malts is well apparent throughout. There is also a bitterness that is no doubt attributed to the hops, but its not overpowering. This is just an incredible beer, and something well worth seeking out."
"This ones pretty solid. Its simple, but in true FFF fashion, the quality really comes through."
"I will hopefully be able to land a case of the 2006 variety...."
"D- It is to coffee for me not all bad though. I not big fan of porters or stouts (do prefer stouts) and I do try to keep opinion out when I am doing my review besides in drinkability."
"Black with a stunning tan head leaving excellent lacing. Complex smell of pine, coffee, currants, and chocolate. Coffee starts you off, then pine with a dry roasted and chocolate finish. Low carbonation and light bodied, I could stand a little more body. I enjoyed it and look forward to trying it again."
"Sampled in August and the beer had held up well, but I had the impression it had mellowed a bit from what it would be nearer the bottling date. Muted unsweetened cocoa powder and a bit of coffe with some coffee-ground bittering. Full bodied, but not thick. Almost a bit a lactose sweetness. A nicely made beer, but I think my expectations may have been a bit high."
"Pours an opaque blackish brown, full finger of foamy beige foam slowly gives way to a moderate sticky ring of lacing, spotted coating also hangs on for the ride. Aromas are primarily roasty espresso and bittersweet chocolate, sweet and malty, pleasant hoppiness also present. Taste is also sweet, rich coffee and chocolate flavors, light bitterness, hops are more subtle in taste than in the nose. Mouthfeel is light to moderately bodied paired with medium levels of carbonation, washes down super smooth. Delectable beer, very drinkable and enjoyable, Will purchase the next release."
"Quite a porter. Tastes sort of like someone crushed a butt load of espresso beans into a dark malt based beer, but beyond that... good beer."
"D- Pretty high ABV but very drinkable after a nice meal. Or better yet with a good chocolate dessert."
"Pours a nearly opaque black. Thick brown head of medium and large bubbles. Aroma is pine, then fades to burnt grain. Taste is roasted barley coffee with a burnt black patent bite that transitions to a hoppy pine bitterness in the aftertaste. Flavorful and interesting highly hopped porter. Very enjoyable."
"Overall a nice porter with a hop kick."
"While an amazing tasting beer, it is too big for me to want to drink more than one bomber in a sitting. Additionally, the strength of the brew pretty much ensures I couldnt have more than one. Still absolutely incredibleanother winner from 3 Floyds."
"This is a very drinkable porter. I would like to try this one again."
"I like this, but the mouthfeel could have been smoother, yet dry, and the fruitiness could've gotten bigger to come and meet the coffee/cocoa flavors."
"A black beer, no light gets thru. Has a big foamy light brown head and some nice lace. A marvelous sharp hop note jumps out of the Bottle/glass and straight into your nose. Hints of bittersweet chocolate and coffee linger behind. A roasted malt bitterness washes over your tongue. Followed by a snappy hop bite at the back of your throat. The dry finish is mostly esspresso coffee with a hint of chocolate."
"Mouthfeel is bitter, roasty, full bodied, along with a coffee like finish."
"I poured about only an inch of this beer into the mug and for that I recieved about 3 inches of foam. It took me probably five minutes to get to a near full glass as the foam wanted to keep rising outside the mug. Finally I had myself a nice dark porter with still a good cap of dark tan foam. Smell is sweet and chocolatey, with a nice roasted character. The flavor is semi-sweet with light coffee and chocolate tones, immediately clashing with bitter roasted malt flavors. The moderate bitterness lingers well on the tongue, while the alcohol doesn't seem too strong. Nice rich mouthfeel, smooth with strong carbonation. Good drinkalbility here, I like the bitter flavor on this one. It was worth it despite the difficult pour."
"Bottle undated, presumably 2004 vintage Pours syrupy black with virtually zero head retention. Nose is super pine cone hops overpowering virtually all other aromas. Really, this one smells like nothing less than a freshly squeezed Xmas tree. And to my senses thats a good thing. The body has a nice heavy gravity to it, sliding down the throat langorously like carbonated molasses... only a slight exagerration, but the enthusiasm brought about by this beer encouraging a bit of truth stretching. The hops arent nearly as dominant on the tongue as the aroma, but still marginalize the other tastes. The actual taste of the hops used is quite excellent, however. A fine, if nearly exquisite, example of what I look for in a Christmas ale. High marks all around"
"N.B. Drink this one cold. Alcohol becomes overwhelming as it warms and overpowers some of the flavors."
"Bottle Pours a clear dark brown with a fizzy light brown head. Head is pretty diminishing with good lacing. Has a great malty aroma of good chocolate. Has a little grain too and just enough hops to keep in blended very nicely. Has a thin texture and a mediun body. A decent amount of carbination. Has good flavors. Definately not a beer that would make you afraid of the dark. Has a nice light bitter finish. This is very good, well done 3Fs."
"Flavor is filled with roasted malts, coffee, and a bit of chocolate. Dry, slightly hoppy finish. Very well balanced and crafted. Mouthfeel is full and smooth... I'd swear that this came out of a cask if I didn't know any better. Drinkability is good, as this one hides its relatively high 7.5% very well. Drinks like a 4.5% beer."
"D: Very drinkable."
"A tasty and drinkable beer, but the head is a little out of control and all the bitterness and decent strength make it not something to drink all day."
"OVERALL COMMENTS: This beer is stellar in every way  its got it all. Not a weak link anywhere to be had. Nothing like Three Floyds, man  even on a warm Sunday afternoon, this beer hits the spot. Now we just have to get them to distribute to Colorado."
"Drinkability: A very enjoyable porter, that shows off the best features of the style."
"D- The only reason that this beer got a 4 for the drinkability is because of all of the foam it was hard to drink for like twenty minutes. I would recommend this because it was a good sit down and relax beer."
"Overall I really enjoyed drinking this beer and would certainly recommend it to anyone that likes dark beers."
"Opaque black with a thick, coffee colored head. Great roasty aroma with coffee, chocolate, earthy hops, and a little bit of something herbal in the background. Maybe mint? Really complex flavor with a mix of brown sugar, coffee, and chocolate primarily. There's a nice, strong hoppiness without being a citrusy hop bomb. Also noticing a bit of the herbal note in the flavor. Well carbonated and medium bodied. This is a really flavorful and enjoyable beer!"
"Wow! That's some hoppy porter. Tons of hops flavour right up front & in your face. Plenty of citrus & pine tree sap & hop induced bitterness. Finishes dry with a lingering chocolate flavour medium/full bodied, moderate carbonation. I wish this were available year round, and around the corner from me."
"Drinkability was very good... went down easily, and I wouldn't mind having more."
"Good but not great. It's a bad sign when a beer reminds you of another beer and you wish you were drinking the other brew instead. In this case it's one of my favorite dry stouts: North Coast Black Hart which has similar roasted malt characteristics but a serious hop finish that leaves no doubt it's a *dry* stout. Too bad the Alpha Klaus wasn't equally interesting. Mind you, it's a good beer but not one I'd spend all year looking forward to..."
"Very smooth porter with good roasted choclate malt, very oaty and grainy mouthfeel but not necessarily in a off way. I don't know this beer has left me a tad dissapointed. Not a bad brew at all but for the price many other beers are around to be taken. This beer lacks in complexity and mouthfeel. Still not bad"
"A solid, roasty porter, but I wouldnt expect anything less than a solid brew from Three Floyds. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is medium, dusty, carbonation keeps it light and active. This is a little more chocolatey than a traditional porter but it is highly quaffable and very satisfying. Seasonal or not, traditional or not, one of the better porters I've experienced."
"Im usually not a fan of highly hopped beers of this nature but this one actually works pretty damn well. Dark brown. The aroma is fairly subtle (but I assume it may have something to do with its age) with a gigantic chocolate candy bar malt taste in the flavor and an extreme hop flavor and bitterness. Rich and full body."
"the appearance is nothing spectacular: dark walnut color with a head that doesn't feel too committed to longevity"
"Pours very thick black, forming an enormous dark tan head. A bit unexpected, this is almost impyish in appearance. Beautiful lacing. Nose is full of coffee molasses, burnt cherries, even a bit of vanilla. Very deep. Taste is pretty damned impressive. Upfront there's a stab of sweetness, but it's quickly overridden by an onslaught of burnt molasses, deep caramel, coffee and burnt dark fruits. There's more than a little bit of woodyness, from hops perhaps? and at the same time a note of green hops as well, and a vague yet profound citrus hop undertone. Midpalate there's a sensation of bittersweet chocolate (70%), which is incredibly impressive and not a compliment i concede lightly. It makes the beer. Substantial supporting bitterness. It all ends in a lingering dry roasty note and a very storng ebbing hoppiness. Body is medium with good supporting medium low carbonation. Somewhere between chewy and creamy. Very drinkable. I like it."
"Drinkability. I could see making Alpha Klaus a Christmas time regular. Very easy to drink. The blend of roasted malt and piney, citrusy hops is very interesting. A beer to savor. I could put a couple of pints of Alpha Klaus away without a problem. Not a session beer but one to seek and enjoy."
"This is in fact not normal, but quite amazing for me."
"A hoppy porter? Pretty much...and they do it so well. A porter for the hopheads. The label proudly proclaims, ""it's not normal"" and they were right. It almost defies categorization. What a crazy and unique porter..."
"Appears thick on the pour the color absorbs all visible light on the spectrum, where'd you go Roy G. Biv ; color is dark chocolate hued letting just an inkling of light through when held to the light. It forms a huge tan head with even lacing spread around my pint glass. Aroma contains pine tree scented hops which absolutely rush the senses along with something that is very candy cane esque with a peppermint herbal character underneath the hop layer dark chocolate cake mix and strong imported coffee hibernate. Taste with a little age on this sampe hop bitterness is just beginning to tame a bit, what's left is the pine cone / herbal mix that screams Christmas time. Dark roasted malts add a layer of coffee edged bitterness and dark chocolate roasts bring powdered cake mix onto the flavor profile, hop burps ensue all is well. As more yeast is added from the bottle a bready tone joins in the complexity that really equates to the cohesiveness of this creation, wow I tried it last holdiay season and it's just perfect...pilgrimage to 3F's maybe soon. Mouthfeel is full bodied yet crisp and dangerously smooth I paid $7.99 for a bomber and I don't feel cheated at all one of the few higher priced beers that earns it's value has a velvety texture on the palate carbonation maybe a bit higher but after carrying the higher gravity of this brew it comes of smooth as can be. Drinkability, well this beer is an incredible experience this Limited Liability Corporation from Munster, IN continues to arouse the beer lover deep down in my soul, a treat that one should track down every winter, it's great stuff."
"WOW. I certainly didn't expect this to have such a strong hops aroma, but it is from 3F's. Great roasted aroma really mixes well with th ehops. Long lasting, rocky head. I haven't had many porters, but this beer is outstanding. I have a couple more I thought I'd save till next Christmas, but I'll drink them soon so I can enjoy the hoppiness."
"Though I don't usually enjoy big hops in my chocolate-flavored beers, I'll make an exception for this. Right from the pour, a big boquet of hops swirled around big toasted grains and chocolate for imense complexity right from the aroma. Pours a thick and silky dark brown that is entirely opaque. Nice tan foamstand rose from the glass and left ideal lacing and it subsidded. Tastes of sweet chocolate malt, toasted grains, and barley malt up front. Creamy and smooth texture that led right into the spicy, earthy hop flavor. Creates serious bitterness to offset sweet chocolates. A coffee like finish rounds out the sweetness and boldness. Finishes a hoppy crispness. Quite clean for such a bold beer. Never drying or cloying. The alcohols never get out of hand."
"D- Not as smooth a beer as I look for a porter to be. More of a ""challenge"" than the easy-drinking porters I've most enjoyed. And at 7.5%, possibly a little dangerous to relax with for an entire evening, without worrying about over-imbibing."
"Another nice offering from three floyds."
"Cheers!"
"overall very good and quite drinkable. i'd definitely have this one again."
"Drinkable... likeable well-made, I am happy I have a bomber to drink. I dont have much more to say. Id gladly drink more. I will seek out some next year. I am very grateful BuckeyeNation included this in a beer trade a few months ago. Thanks a lot. I owe you one."
"The body is still fairly light. The finish is great. Lingering, gently bitter, doesn't dry out, and shows off the flavors in their entirety. This is very drinkable despite a fairly high ABV. Thanks again to BeerBeing."
"Overall - highly recommended. Bought this beer after a lot of recommendations from friends, and I went in a bit skeptical - a Xmas porter? It's great, find it, buy it, drink it."
"Mouthfeel is medium. Fairly creamy. Coats the mouth just long enough to let the flavors meld but each express themselves. This is an extremely drinkable beer. An awesome flavor and a nice mouthfeel."
"Fantastic looking beer. Good head although it was more bubbly than creamy. Tremendous laving. Black as a steers tuckus on a moonless night. Odor was nothing exeptional, just some hints of coffee and malts. Taste was a surprizing hit of hops first, then a chocolateness and then a heavy roasted malt taste. Creamy and dry in the mouth. Good drinkability...i could have another or 10."
"Clever artwork and cool looking label, as you would expect from the Floyd's bros. Foamy tan head..leaves some lacing that fades pretty quickly due to the oily consistency. Chocolate malt aroma with a touch of hops. The taste is fairly complex, and who would have guessed Three Floyds would add some extra hope to their porter recipe? Very hoppy for a porter..the roasted character hides the hops pretty well up-front, but you'll find yourself burping hops for the next few hours.. I've noticed that some warmth really brings out the flavors..you're doing a huge disservice to this beer if you drink it too cold. A great seasonal porter that is meant to be drank fresh..but I will be laying a few of these boys down to try next Christmas."
"I now have the sudden urge to find my copies of Emmit Otter's Jugband Christmas and the Charlie Brown Christmas episode."
"Ho, Ho, Ho! Wow, just below the tree line in the northern reaches of Nunavut here. Sheesh. Darkest opaque brown with a beauty tan head that is only so very lightly marred by big bubbles that look like pepper. The smell is all piney hops from the outset. A little balance on the malts would have resulted in a higher score. The hops blend smoothly with the malts in the initial taste profile, but the hops soon dominate (go figure from these guys...like Stone Brewing Indiana Division at times.) The mouthfeel falls just short of satisfyingly full. Drinkability is fine for this if you plan in moving to a double IPA. The ABV is not so high as to keep you from having a second and the hops are pleasant (though if you do not like hops, I would avoid this brew.) This tastes like Christmas should taste. Enjoy."
"This had been aged a few years so the hop element was toned down, but still much more lively than an average porter. Piney hop notes with chocolate cake and coffee in the aroma. Foretaste is roasty followed quickly by dark chocolate and espresso and then a kick of hops int he finish. Reminds me a lot of Gonzo Imperial Porter."
"The drinkability factor is self contained. Most reasonable humanoids wouldn't drink a few of these in succession. One bomber is capable of providing all of the enjoyment one could ask for in a sitting. Not to say that you couldn't have something a bit less intense before or after. FFF! Unbelievable brews! Thanks for the Christmas present."
"Drinkability: The biggest thing decreasing its drinkability is the price. In addition, it's so thick, complex, and tasty that to me it's more of a sharing porter, or else a nightcap to be enjoyed but maybe purchased months down the road for another treat. Still one of the best porters out there though, and one of the best that uses a fantastic combination of hop and malt to near perfection, in a porter to boot. It ain't easy, and Three Floyds have it down. At least snag one of these to see what you think."
"My only ding here is that this lacks the girth I was hoping for in a big porter. For all the hops and loudness, it seems to me that there oughtta be a little bit more around the midsection. Especially for a beer named after Santa Klaus, big fat old fucking gluttonous slob that he is. Be that as it may. I can't really complain about the overall drinkability with this one. I drank the shit out of it."
"Drinkability? I wish I had a couple more!"
"Personally, I think I prefer the Alpha Klaus, but only by a hair's breadth. My friend murrayswine likes his beers to be hoppy and unbalanced, and so prefers the Black Sun. Either way, though, you can't really go wrong. Two damn fine beers."
"The only thing that prevents me from really wanting this beer again is its price."
"Poured thick and creamy into the glass with a nice thick head. It smelled divine as it poured into the glass with the aromas of roasted grains, chococlate and coffee. Rich coffee and chocolate flavours to start, but a wave of hop bitterness slowly took over. It finishes slightly dry and bitter which lingers in the mouth for a while. Very well balanced. Highly drinkable."
"Pours with a huge coffee-colored head of tiny bubbles that slowly settles leaving decent lacing. Pitch black and no light makes it through. Big and hoppy smell of pine and sap. The taste is roasty and coffee-filled with chocolate that finishes sweet with hints of chocolate powder and piney hops. Medium body and medium carbonation make it relatively light on the palate. Nice and smooth and highly drinkable, if a bit pricey."
"One of the very best beers I've ever had."
"First of '06. This looks great. Pours damn near black, with a hefty mocha head. Smells heavily of malts, hops, and maybe some spice or something. The flavor has a karate chop of roasted malts and a meaty portion of hops. As my palate adjusts the the intense taste, bittersweet chocolate and espresso come through. There is also that ""something"" that I can't put my finger on. It may be just a spicy hop. The mouthfeel is thick and foamy and slighly astringent. A strong sipper, in my opinion. A great way to start the year."
"Aged bomber from xmas of 2003. Most beers lost their hop and spice aromas after a year in the bottle. Happily that was not the case with the Alpha Klaus. Head was nice, thick and quite brown in color. Beer was dark brown to black. Mouthfeel was light but not detractingly so. Flavor was full of hop spiciness and something else I could not place my finger on. Chocolate and a slight coffee bitterness came through once the mouth adjusted to the hops. Luckily I have one more of there I can sit on and see how it fairs next year."
"Dark chocolate, coffee, and a bunch of spices that I couldn't figure out. That is, after your tongue is assaulted with Christmas tree sappy hops. Even with the big flavor, a bit lighter than a lot of porters out there. Though not traditional in any sense, very enjoyable and worth a few."
"OK drinkability here but not great. An interesting beer to be sure but the Dreadnaught IPA rocked my senses; this one did not. This is a beer I will try again at another time. Maybe my mood was just not in harmony for this tonight; but I didn't like it as much as most do."
"Nice and easy to drink. I have yet to try a 3F brew that I don't enjoy."
"This isn't your Dad's porter, but it's quite the tasty little brew. It's hard to justify the price as other similarly stylized brews would go for $5.99/bomber or so. I found it more enjoyable after it warmed up and the carbonation mellowed. One of a kind, but I'd be hard pressed to buy it again considering the cost."
"Great drinkability, if I had more of this beer, I would have drank more. Not filling and very easy too drink. Overall a great brew from Three Floyds. I must find some more of this treat before the holiday season is over. A must try!!!"
"This beer is very dark brown with mahogany highlights and there was a bit of cascading from the pour. The light brown head showed good lacing and decent retention. Quite nice! There's some roasted character to the aroma, but pine and grapefruit from the hops covered most of this up. In fact, it smelled quite a lot like pine trees. The same happened in the flavour to a lesser extent, with malt becoming more evident as it warmed. Strong hop bitterness. There were hints of semi-sweet chocolate and coffee, along with herbal hops, throughout. The finish really lingered and had a lot of hop flavour and roasted bitterness. Medium bodied and quite dry, there was a bit of slickness and well-integrated carbonation. This is a big, hoppy interpretation of a porter and exactly what I expect from 3F. You can tell there's a solid porter malt base lurking underneath all the hops. Quite enjoyable. Thanks for the pick-up Viggo!"
"Drinkability- Nice change of pace beer. I wouldn't recommend it as a traditional porter, but if someone love hops and love porters, this would be a nice fix for them. Probably a once a year beer for me. Definitely not a session brew."
"Very dark in color-basically black though not quite thru and thru like some beers. Great tan head on top. Extremely hoppy and floral aroma. Very perfume like. It actually reminds me of Victory's Storm King which I have recently found to be very, very hoppy. Fantastic flavor-great blend of hops and roasted malt. Its balanced enough that the high hop levels meld into the roasted malts. Hops do tend to dominate overall. Nice mouthfeel-full bodied and not too dry or sweet in the finish. An extremely drinkable beer. I actually read a recent review in a newspaper column about Xmas beers and the writer stated he didnt remember 3 Floyds beers tasting this good when he lived right near the brewery. I sort of have to agree-in that it has taken them a few years to come around to my liking. For a while they were really nothing special but have really come into their own. Well done I say!!"
"Drinkability- Not to overbearing if your having this AS desert. Definetly a meal in bottle."
"First this is a damn good beer. Pours a dark opaque black color with a faint creamy head. The aroma is to kill for. I've never smelled such fresh piney resins in a bottled beer. It's as if this beer were served on draft at the brewery. It clearly has benefited from late hop additions and dry hopping. Fresh, fresh , fresh. Somewhat of a subtle touch of sweet molasses aroma. Taste is of warming alcohol and an overwhelming yet delightful dry dark chocolate presence. Lots of bittering hops which linger as an aftertaste which is pleasant nevertheless. Well balanced despite being hop heavy. Chocolate malts back it up adequately. A wonderful seasonal beer. Oh I love this time of the year!!!"
"22 ounce bottle. Three Floyd's Alpha Klaus pours out a nearly, but not quite, black color with a creamy head. The aroma is very roasty, nutty, and hoppy. Incredibly, the hops go very well with the roastiness. The flavor is sweet at first with caramel and chocolate. Roasted flavors come in at the middle. The finish is bitter, with citrus hops. This beer is probably more hoppy than any porter I've had. Furthermore, the hop flavor melds with the roasty flavors to create a delicious whole. Mouthfeel is medium. A beer this tasty is almost drinkable by default. Great beer. I'm falling in love with this brewery, even as I despise it for the price of it's beer ($9 for this bomber)."
"Drinkability -- This one is very quaffable. If it didn't cost $8 for a bomber I'd probably purchase more. I've got one more bottle I'll save for closer to Christmas. In many ways it reminds me of Edmund Fitzgerald. A nice offering from Three Floyds but due to the cost and similarity to Edmund Fitzgerald, I wont be purchasing it again anytime soon."
"Overall: I didn't buy this one last year because I thought it was too much for a single bottle. Wow. I was wrong. A completely unique porter that really uses aggressive hopping without being over-the-top and losing all of its porter characteristics. Outstanding."
"Overall this is a pretty good beer, but it is certainly not worth $8.99 for a 22 oz bottle."
"Cheers!"
"Price not withstanding, this is endlessly gulpable. A fattened hophead porter. If I could get this in sixpacks for the price of the bomber, I'd drink it all season....but that seems to be the case with all of FFF's specialties."
"Pours crude oil black with a couple fingers of capuccino froth. Nose is vibrant and clean, with notes of menthol/piney hops, tabacco, espresso beans and dark chocolate cocoa. Taste is a tale of two beers, reminded me a lot of Founders Black Rye, with the juxtaposition of big floral hoppiness and chocolately roasted malts. Mouthfeel was rich and creamy. This is an impressive American porter, I don't know if I can put it above the Edmund Fitzgerald though, certainly not on value. At half the price it's a steal, at $9/bottle it's a one time indulgence."
"It poured form the bottle a dark brown to black with some ruby highlights, and a dense, tan head that stuck around for ages, and left a clumpy lace on the side of the glass. The nose is an explosion of grapefruit hop along with espresso and chocolate, just a hint of toffee on the finish. The taste? WOW. This is a porter. More grapefruit and orange right up front. The espresso and chocolate are a bit muted in the flavor. There is a touch of dark roasted malt on the finish. Man is this beer a hop bomb. Thick, wonderfully rich mouth feel. Great drinkability, no real heat from the alcohol. Merry Christmas 3 Floyds!"
"The first thing that comes to mind for taste is the body. Very smooth and rich. Hoppy and delicious. Malts hit the palate more towards the end of the hop bite. Dark tasty malts in the aftertaste that stay with you. There is a spice to this beer but mainly I taste hops and roasted malts. Complex beer and it is a great one. Merry Christmas Alpha Klaus!"
"22 oz bomber, no date, but I know it's 2005. Poured into an imperial pint, dark opaque black with a slight reddish hue, 3 fingers of light brown head, good retention, nice lacing. Smell is very very hoppy for a porter, somewhat piney, some nice dark chocolate and roasted coffee lingering. Taste is more of the same, a wonderful rich chocolate, roasted malt, espresso, all overlaid with a strong hop taste. Mouthfeel is full and rich and creamy. Very very nice porter, I love the hops, great seasonal."
"drinkability: very very drinkable"
"Enjoyed this gem with dessert on Thanksgiving. The beer poured a dark brown with hints of red. The head was tan and well-represented, leaving a nice head on the glass. The smell was full of chocolate and Pacific Northwest Hops. Taste was reminiscent of many good porters I have sampled in the past. The alcohol was high but very unnoticeable. I could have drank more of this beer. Find a bomber and enjoy!"
"I don't try too many porters, I guess I never got into them all that much. But this one was good. I'll have it again in the future, especially if I can find it in smaller bottles."
"Served in an imperial pint glass at the brew pub. Very dark with slight ruby tinge around the edges and a tight tan head that sits on top leaving good lace down the glass. The aroma gives you a ton of pine with hints of cocoa and chocolate and dark roasted malt. The pine hops lead initially but the dark malts take over with the malty sweetness and taste of molasses coming from the mexican sugar. The beer finishes somewhat dry with hops again bringing up the rear. Another great beer for the holidays from 3F's"
"Pours an opaque dark brown, red visible on the sides, big tan head forms, nice sticky lace. Smell is coffee/chocolate, roast, then big pine and grapefruit hope blasts. Taste is chocolate, coffee and caramel, with a super resinous piney finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full with low carbonation. True 3F interpretation, my only complaint is that by the end of the glass the hops have killed taste buds enough to weaken the roasty flavour, but other than that spectacular."
"Drinkability: This would be a great porter for any occasion, but it is especially well suited for the Christmas season with it's unique piney characteristic. I was expecting something a little more adventuresome form FFFs, but this still doesn't dissapoint. I'll be curious to see how a few hold up over the next couple holiday seasons."
"This is an absolutely delicious beer, and as a holiday beer, it's perfect. Deep dark chocolate, spicy pine hops, luxurious mouthfeel, and a nice alcohol kick to boot. I need more!"
"This beer is incredibly drinkable for the style. It has lots of flavor without being overwhelming and it doesn't sit too heavily on the stomach. While its price-point and ABV deny it session beer status, it certainly drinks like one."
"Ill pick of a bottle of this and try it again soon. Maybe their was something wrong with the keg I had or my taste buds that night but like I said, I dont get the hype."
"overall: this is just an excellent porter. i recommend drinkin' this just a tad below room temperature as this made all the difference in the world. very tasty and excellent mouthfeel."
" The mouthfeel is thick, which is something that far too many Porters are missing, IMO. Drinkability is good, but 1 bomber is enough. I do prefer this fresh, but less than a year of age has done wonders for this one."
"Following its emancipation from a 22oz bomber, this porter sits heavy in my snifter and kicks up a frothy light brown head. Opaque onyx is the color, ambrosial is the aroma. A thick roasted chocolately coffee smell coexists simultaneously with citrous and piney hops. An interesting combination that is not used enough, in my opinion. Alcohol is present in the nose as well. Flavor begins with large malts and roasted grain. Bitter chocolate blends with coffee in a big dark way, reminiscent of a stout. A crescendo of hops begins in the middle, beginning subtly and finishing the flavor with bitter, drying citrous. Roasted grain continues in the finish, but is dominated by an onslaught of prickly hops. Mouthfeel is thick (for the style) and very full, with some hop bite and medium-low carbonation. An intense, complex, enjoyable and very drinkable porter. Why do Three Floyds kick so much ass? I don't know, but I'll stay satisfied as long as I'm supplied with these unique and well-hopped takes on familiar styles."
"Drinkability: I could drink this one all day. As previously stated it has a very clean taste and a great smell to it. I wish I had brought more home with me."
"Another great offering from 3F...could enjoy this one all evening if only I had more."
"Overall, a great beer. I've yet to disappointed with anything I've tryed from 3F, and I didn't have any doub that this one would continue the trend. Of course, it does."
"It's Christmas in July. The aroma of this beauty sends me back to sipping Bailey's in December around the tree with my parents; that is to say, quite piney... with notes of dark chocolate, black licorice, and a crisp pungent hop nose. Chocolate flavor and rich dark malts initiate the palate, leading to a slightly resinous herbal hop finish, which is not nearly as bitter as the aroma might suggest. Quite balanced. Mild alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is velvety and near perfect, with just a tingle of dry carbonation in the finish. I'd love a fresh sample this holiday season, as this is a real treat. Maybe 3F will start to send this to PA? Please?"
"Another top beer from a top BA - BuckeyeNation has hooked me up again. Thanks."
"It's sure not normal...but it IS indeed tasty!! This has definitely catapulted up to amongst my favorite Christmas beers, and while it was slightly more hoppy when we had it in January, now it's mellowed out to a nice balance. As nice and piney a beer as I've had and one I will look for this holiday season."
"I am a huge fan of this brew. I want to see how I compare to before. It pours an incredibly dark brown to black color with a small head that falls to a moderate broken head over top. The nose is divine. Brilliant hop aroma, along with a big chocolate and moderate coffee, but not bitter. Very well blended flavors on this beer as well. The hop is mostly aroma and flavor. Not a lot of bittering. I get a blast of chocolate and a nice hop flavor, but not bitter. Very very good. The feel is a light thick to heavy moderate with a light to moderate carbonation. This beer is awesome. Everything works so well together. I'll alwyas grab this beer when it comes out. So good."
"Bottle: Poured a black color porter with an above medium dark foamy head with good retention. Aroma of pine is really non-expected but enjoyable nonetheless when mix with roasted malt. I couldnt really detect any chocolate or coffee, which I would have expected. Taste is dominated by the pines and IMHO doesnt leave enough places for roasted malt and bitterness. I guess Im kind of surprise this is rated so highly since it seems to be liking character and I must say that Ive had much better beer from 3 Floyds."
"Comments  Big thanks to my BA bro BuckeyeNation for hooking me up with this classic Three Floyds offering."
"Dark, smooth full bodied pour with reddish purple tinges around the edges. A huge tan head comes in and holds until I'm done. Ridiculous amounts of sticky lacing. I love it! Smells like I walked into a coffee shop and then put a hop plant up my nose. It works well! Very nice mixture of the two along with some sweet chocolate on top. Taste has a concentrated espresso shot, not really roasted at all, but still intense. Dark, lucious chocolates dominate the malts. A little charcoal in there underneath. Full green hop plants come in the finish. There's a creaminess in there as well but I really get it at the end. This beer went down way, way too smooth. Too good. It's a shame we can't get it here in Michigan and the price also makes it a shame but its still worth it for a treat every once in awhile."
"Overall, one of my new favorites from 3F. Absolutely dangerous in drinkability. Each sip brings a smile to my face. Not a trace of the alcohol within. Smooth, smooth, smooth."
"A very enjoyable porter for the holiday season, with food or as a late night beer."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Drinkability and Overall: I've been spoiling myself with these good porters lately. This is another classic. Three Floyds have again outdone themselves with this rich, thoughtful and wonderfully refreshing piece of brewing art. Thanks to PatYoda for the bottle."
"D- This is a big beer with a bigger hoppiness. The aroma and bitterness of the hops are well balanced so it feels like there are fresh hops right in the glass. It would be nice to see a bit more maltyness in this beer but I can see hops are the driving force in this brew."
"Drinkability - are you kidding? I think I spent $100 on Alpha Klaus this year, it's dreadfully delicious. If my refund gets here in time, I may deplete Jungle Jim's of their remaining stock!"
"Backwash: To be fair, this was based on only two bottles from the same source, but I feel they were somewhat representative. I hope that the draught version is much better and I get to try it. Still, this is the first Three Floyds beer that Ive found to be disappointing, especially after being so eager to try it. Aside from some nice coffee flavors, this wasnt very flavorful in a multi-dimensional way and not much akin to any English ales or porters I can think of. Sure, the hops are there; but the malts were weak and the body and mouthfeel were thin. Especially after drinking some other porters recently, I found this a bit wanting. Not anything like a Fullers London Porter and a classy Imperial Stout. Id take either of those (esp. the Fullers) over this in a heartbeat."
"And an even bigger kudos to rhoadsrage for the chance to try this wonder!! Yummalishious!"
" Drinkability is good a nice porter that is heavily hopped as the name states. Want to think merlin48 for this fine brew."
"from the bottle. poured dark brown, wih granet edges, and a tan head. aroma pine, bitter sweet chocolate, honey, roasted malts, coffee, alcohol, floral. flavor, semisweet chocolate, malts, caramel, fruity, raisins. the hops were not as strong in the flavor as they were in the aroma. nice dry mouth feel"
"I was a bit let down when it came to the mouthfeel. Not a lot of body or complexity. Very watery and a little too oily. Despite this setback, this beer was a Huge Winner with me. Will pick up more next time I make a trip to the east coast."
"Very nice!"
"There's a lot going on in this beer for a porter. It pours extremely dark, with a two-finger deep head on it. The head settled down and would create a nice steady lace throughout the glass. The aroma is a very mild spruce, with burnt malts in the background. The tongue comes across as a cornocopia of dark choocolate, Christmas tree, malts, sweet hops, and smokey goodness. The carbonation is perfect for a porter, enough to know it is there and bring out the flavors, but not too much so that it keeps the flavors from reaching the tongue with fizz. But good God, I think I actually found a Christmas/Holiday/Celebration beer I found myself wanting to drink."
"Managed to get a couple of bombers of the Alpha Klaus from my friends at Half Time Beverages, and I was not disappointed. This seasonal porter--they call it a chocolate porter--poured a deep ebony with just enough translucence to reveal the clear, blood red undertone. The head was tall (2 and 1/2 fingers) and toffee/chocolate brown. Not thick frothiness, but sticky. The aroma was a balance of roasted sweet malts and distinct piney hoppiness. This is a hard combination to keep under control, and I was nervous about the taste, but they managed to pull it off. The mouthfeel is medium-thin, and the roasted nuttiness was not cloying. In fact, the sweetness diminshes in the taste--a plus as far as I'm concerned because it enabled the hops to assert themselves appropriately. A slightly bitter finish and, to me, not much chocolate!"
"Very dark with a thick tan head. The head shrinks down a bit but then sticks around for quite a while. The smell is good, with a mix of roasted malt and chocolate and flowery hops. The taste is very good but also unusual. There is a good balance between malt and hops. The hop flavor is more floral than bitter. The mouthfeel is good. I would prefer a little more body."
"poured witha tan fluffy head that faded to an average thickness and clumpy underneath an almost black body. fresh hoppy aroma with a bitter black malt character. moderately thick mouthfeel witha an excellent blend of toasted and chocolate malts. bit on the chewy side without becoming heavy but has some sugary notes. aroma is completely opposite of the taste. grassy and hoppy and finishes with a rich malt finish. very excellent."
"Ambiguity in American culture is seldom pondered. This beer is doing a noteworthy nonverbal job. It doesn't speak but it demands I do. I will seek this out next Christmas. Onece again, Three Floyds makes it big with me. It's a pleasure dto live close by."
"I picked this up while on the East Coast for the holidays. I've been looking forward to this one for quite a bit but I wanted to figure out a good pairing for it, which I think I did. This beer pours out a deep shade of brown, so dark in fact that it might as well be black to the naked eye. Comparison to light reveals those burgandy/brown highlights. Sticky cappacino foam head here that retains very nicely, leaving fat clumps of lace on the glass as I work my way down. The nose on this beer is robust and lovely, chocked full of chocolate, nice mild coffee tones as well. It doesn't step over into imperial stout territory by getting to charred or roasty. I'd call it down right perfect as far as the smell is concerned. Tastes like no other porter I've had, the front is chocolate covered strawberries and coffee beans, nice and chewy with malts through the middle where the ""Alpha"" part of the name becomes apparent. The chewy milk chocolate stays present the whole time while melding with piney and grapefruity hop flavors. Bitterness levels are middling, but the flavor of the hops really shines through while playing nice with the rich and layered flavors of the malts the whole time. Wow, grab this one if you have the chance. I know I'll be snagging it up whenever I see more of it. I paired this with New York Strip steak and frites and doused just about everything in shallot/butter/bleu cheese sauce, and it rocked my world."
"Fellow BA Quarre gave us this about a year ago (!) and we are just digging into it now. Lucky for us, it has held up very well :-) Color is dark dark root beer, it had a head to match but it's gone now, just a ring in my glass. Aroma promises all sorts of things, including dark chocolate, make it 60%. Tastewise, one is rewarded with more chocolate notes in the taste, a wider range than found in the aroma. I found the malt to be very prominent, but then the hops hit. The finish is hoppy, but not over the top. I think that's due to the malt being just so present. Solid medium mouthfeel, small fine carbonation. Drinkability is high due to the ease of which this goes down. Bring on this beer!"
"I had a good idea what Alpha Klaus had in store before I cracked the crown, but that hasn't kept me from being impressed as hell (drinking is believing). While hops are far and away my first love, I also appreciate massively malty beer. Nothing wrong with combining the two into a two-headed beast of epic proportions. Kudos to Three Floyds for sheer audaciousness, originality and further evidence of genius. 'Christmas in a glass', 'the best of both worlds'... whatever you call it, call it great beer."
"No dating, but from the 2004 batch. Poured a deep, dark, rich, black brown. Deep khaki head that settled down as a thick and creamy head, but left only a dusting with islands drifting across, and a very thick ring of large bubbles. Scents of chocolate, coffee, and darknes. Smooth, luscious creaminess and decently carbinated. Great, dark maltiness and yummy hoppiness. Wonderfully drinkable!"
"Had this on tap at Rich O's Public House. Pours a very dark color with a small head that doesn't stick around too long and leaves great lacing on the sides. The aroma is very hoppy for a porter, but very nice. The flavor was much less hoppy from the aroma - very well balanced hops here. Big maltiness and creamy chocolate goodness. Wonderful body and exceptionally easy to drink. Loved this one on tap."
"Served straight up in a standard pint glass. Poured a lovely velvety black with very little head. Smell was excellent, strong note of pine and sweet malts. Taste was superb. The exuberence of hops produced a strong spruce/pine note that made one reminice of christmas. The hop character was well balanced by the malty porter back note. A great beer. Superb mouthfeel and rather easy to dring. It's just a shame this is a seasonal, and in very limited release here in the mid-atlantic."
"An excellently hoppy porter. Spruce pine aroma. Black. A fullmouth treat of quality chocolate on the sweeter side, and hoppiness. Some roast, something dairy, ginger, cardammon, anise, cinammon, grapefruit and other citrus Thanks Wohlfs for bringing in."
"The mouthfeel is oily & slick, the taste just coats your mouth. Drinkability is very good. What a great beer to have by the fire! Another winner from my favorite Hooiser brewers!"
"Overall, it's a very good beer."
"Served from a 22oz bomber at close to 45 degrees in a brandy snifter. Black oily pour accompanied by a nice 2 finger beige effervescent crown. As with most of the 3 Floyds I've tried the hops came on strong in the scent of this deep brown to black selection. Pine needles, and roasted chestnuts followed subtley. Strong bittery hops grabbed the senses and clung tightly through the entire drink, never leaving the mouth but balanced throughout with a mild dose of chocolate and the aforementioned pine. After both glasses I was ready for bed. Although 7.5 abv it feels a lot heavier but not as thick or hefty as an Imperial Stout. Good for a porter but a tad too heavy on the hops to increase the numbers on the style."
"Pretty drinkable. Definately tasty and not big enough to prevent me from having a couple bombers...but I'd definately be feeling good after more than 2 or so."
"22 ounce bottle. A beer with a great nose and a very well achieved balance of flavors. The alcohol never makes an appearance at the party and the drinkability due to the balance was very high."
"Unique, fascinating, and exceptional. The best winter seasonal I've ever sampled, and I'm really fond of Mad Elf and Cold Mountain. Judicious use of hops here transforms a very good winter porter into an excellent winter seasonal. Three Floyds has really raised the bar with this superior brew. A big thank you to orbitalr0x is in order."
"This is truly a good beer and probably deserves to be aged. But it's not a porter. If you blindfolded me and made me sip it, at the very least I would say a hopped up pale ale if not an IPA. It's not a porter. But a very interesting beer...."
"22 oz bottle. Perfect thick tan head atop a beautiful brown body. Nice even carbonation. Hoppy chocolate aroma. Those hops are fresh right now for sure. Flavor is rich with chocolate. Nice hop flavor with a light bitterness. Hop flavor and roasty maltiness lingers. Thick and chewy mouth feel. Extremely drinkable and satisfying. That thick head really has staying power, and forms a nice lacing on the glass. the balance in the flavors is perfect in this one. A must have while fresh."
"I got this from Cretemixer and I read some reviews before I tried it. First let me say I like the idea of a hopped-up sweet porter but the hop combo in this beer is a turn-off. My nose knows and while it poured a great dark color and creamy tan head that had staying power and left lace, this beer smelled off. I am sure I have a good bottle everything was intake and it doesn't tasted oxidized. It reminds me of a fasting beer that has a lot of extra sugar to help tide the monks over. There are plenty of roasty flavor in there but they are beaten to death by the sugar. It is definately drinkable and a rare enjoyment that I thank my fellow BA for this. I could see having one of these in the yuldetide mood, but not anytime soon."
"22 oz. bomber. Pours a deep brown with ruby highlights at the bottom of the glass. Huge creamy tan head. Pretty good head retention, and a nice amount of lace on the sides of the glass. Smell has a whiff of chocolate, followed by an onslought of piney hops. Big hop aroma. Dry chocolate beginning, with hints of roasty malt, followed by piney and citrusy hops. Kind of like a porter with a Christmas tree in it. Medium body, moderate carbonation. Very raw and unbalanced. The hops seem to be over the top, and take away somewhat from the malt character. Not very sessionable. However, having said that, if there is any time of the year for beers to be over the top, Christmas is the time. I think that is why this works. Festive beer, certainly worth a try."
"Giant, dense, light chestnut colored head holds like a champ, eventually leaving a sheet of lace. Roasted malt, coffee, maybe some marshmallow in the aroma and a smell I couldn't quite place at first, but I think it's hops, kind of piney, very interesting. A pretty dry beer. Bitter chocolate and roasted malt flavor, some black licorice, some mild sweetness, and those hops all bounce back and forth melding towards the end. Body is moderate, thick for a porter. Looks great, smells great, tastes great ... this beer delivers. Very interesing mix of hops and dark malts. I had no idea what I was getting into and I'm just psyched. Gonna have to stock up."
"This was from a 22oz bottle. After finally seeing this in a store in the area I decided to pick up a few. This pours out with a pitch-black body with a tall tan head that slowly rising from the bubbles beneath the surface. The head is still a good size even after I drank the whole glass and all the while putting huge clumps of frothy foam around the glass. This is just perfect to look at it really gets the mouth watering. Aroma is a malty mix of chocolate and caramel with strong roasted coffee presence. Wow the hops are just as strong here with notes of earthy and floral hops coming through all that malt. This is quite a bit to take in and I wasnt sure what to make of it at first but it is amazing. The taste is an amazing blend of fresh hops and chocolate malt with both coming on strong. It took me a while to really take this all in but damn this is good. The hops cut though the strong malt to make themselves known and add a wonderful contrast. Flavor ends on a lingering earthy bitter note. Mouthfeel is about full and quite coating that makes the taste stick with you. This is something I could drink all day, huge malts, huge hops and it blends together wonderfully. Simple amazing."
"Who would've ever expected hops in a Three Floyds porter? Well, they're there! It's aroma is chock full of resinous, piney and spruce-like hops (Chinook, but mixed with something else... even some Cascades perhaps...) over subtle, toasted and mildly chocoaltey dark malts. It's very dark brown body rests beneath a frothy head of tan foam that holds well and leaves some nice lace about the glass. It's medium bodied and mildly zesty across the palate. The piney hop character is continued in the flavor, but more balanced by its lightly chocolatey maltiness. It's well-balanced with a solid bitterness, but it's far from overdone; and, as might be expected, it finishes with a flourish of hops. It's not particularily complex, offering little beyond its hops and dark malt combination, but it is quite enjoyable and very drinkable in that sense. Nicely done!"
"Where's the smell? Besides that, a very smooth porter."
"This is one smooth beer. The aroma is fantastic! The flavors almost seem muted, but only in comparison to the nose. This is winter seasonal I will return to. I'm just a little sad that I don't have another;("
"My roommate and I picked up a sixtle of this among other offerings at FFF, I decided that 2004 edition especially on-tap merited a rereview. Pulled the beer into my Sam Smith pint glass. Pours a nice black with the edges turning a beautiful ruby when held up to a light. The 2 finger head ever so gently fades into a tan lacing. Aroma is a little weaker than last years but coffee, chocolate, and ""sticky"" hops meld to form an intoxicating aroma. Taste has a slightly harsh finish but has the same attributes as the nose. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy. Overall this is a great beer but it could use a little time to mellow out the finish before coming something legendary."
"While this is definitely quite tasty, it could certainly use a bit more thick, rich, malt notes. Thicker malt notes would make it just that little bit more festive."
"overall, an excellent winter warmer/spiced ale, not a surprise from this outstanding brewery...wish it were easier to find though..."
"Three Floyds always does a good job of taking a well-known style and tweaking it just enough that it is still within the boundaries of the style yet memorable because of its uniqueness. This is another example. The beer is a deep mahogany color with a thick tan head that lasts pretty much the entire glass. Nice lacing too. The aroma bursts with hops, coffee, alcohol and pine. Rich body with a very pleasant blend of flavors. Roasted nuts, coffee, malt and tons of piney hops never let up. The finish is roasty and bitter to the end. I thought the $9 price tag was a bit steep but this is a fine beer."
"Alpha Klaus can come to town any time he damn well wants. Great stuff!"
"This beer poured very dark with ruby background. If formed a light tan head that left trace lace as it subsided. An aroma of roasted malts and flora hops, with some coffee and chocolate elements to it. The flavor was of malt, hops, coffee and anise. The finish is a touch astrigent and creates an interesting aspect to the overall body. A rather unique porter."
"I think with age this might balance out a bit, but for now it is too hoppy for a porter. At the very least it doesn't have the stuffing to stand up to all the hops foisted upon it."
"This brew pours a deep dark brown color almost black with a billowing offwhite head about an inch or so thick. As I pour this brew its aromas make themselves quite present almost immediately. There is a mix of beautiful resiny hops, followed by some deep roast like aromas, and just a hint of bread. Initial flavors to this brew start off quite roasty with a slight nutty character to it. But these flavors are quickly overwhelmed by the intense hop flavor that lets you know this isn't your ordinary porter. The hops give off an almost spruce like, piney resiny flavor that mix in the most interesting way with the malts. At first I was a bit overwhelmed but as the brew warmed up a bit, the flavors complemented themselves quite nicely. The finish to this brew is slighty bitter, with the the malts lending a night chocolate roasty finish. The body of this beer is truly superb, almost chewy and the carbonation just tingles on the tongue, keeping me fully excited for the next sip. Overall a truly original porter than will warm up your holiday spirits."
"22oz. bomber poured into a snifter. It pours a deep ruby red, almost black color with one finger of head. There is just a little bit of lacing on the glass. The smell is very hoppy. Lots of fresh hops, but a good malt background. The taste is sweet with some chocolate. The hops that are present in the aroma aren't really representing in the taste. Need more hops early in the boil methinks! The mouthfeel is nice and strong. The drinkability is pretty good for a 7.5% brew. A nice take on porter."
"22oz. bomber: Thank you for trades, or I would have never gotten this gem. It pours an inky dark brown color. There was some tan head, but it dies down quickly. A pleasant aroma. A mix of hops, roastiness, coffee, and some smokiness. The taste is an all-out assault on your taste buds (but a pleasant assault). Smokiness, some chocolate, some hop bitterness coming through (although it is sweet to the taste overall). This is just flat out excellent. Thanks to TAR for the trade!"
"Poured black with some reddish hues, tan head and nice lacing on the glass. Piney hop and slightly roasted aroma. Taste started resiny hoppy, then turned roasted with some coffee as well. Full creamy mouthfeel. This is a one of a kind, super hoppy porter... but by no means any sort of Herbed / Spiced Beer."
"During the holiday season I enjoyed this both on-tap and from a bottle (I really got behind at transferring my notes to the site). This review is based on a 22 oz. bottle. The familiar ""Alpha King"" exchanges his crown for a Santa hat on another of Three Floyd's great looking labels. Pours a dark, dark brown with a thick frothy tan/off-white head. Hoppy floral aroma and citrus scents make themselves known right away--a bit reminiscent of Dreadnaught in smell. Tastes very nicely of chocolatey roasted malt with a great hop finish. This is a smooth, highly drinkable, and very enjoyable beer. Overall this was definitely one of my favorites of the Christmas season and I am definitely looking forward to having it again next year."
"Yet another damned fine beer from Nick Floyd and Co!"
"Courtesy of Raindog, thanks sir Body is dark brown and initially wears a tan head that fast becomes one of the quickest dissipating festival of bubbles I've ever seen. Aroma is very intense with more hops than I can shake a stick at. This is woody, herbal, chocolatey, grapefruity with notes of marijuana and smoke. Quite the melting pot you'd like to cook your dinner with. Very direct and dry yet eminently appealing. On the tongue, it's very grassy, reminding me of the Saison from a few hours ago, sweeter than expected with lots of brown sugar, maple and chocolate. Still, after a few sips, the feeling you have is to be drinking hop juice.. but good hop juice! Well-made and to my liking where a fine medium body with appropriate carbonation sure helps. So, when is next christmas?"
"Overall, this beer rocks! Mammoth thank you to TwelveVoltMan for sharing his only bottle with me!"
"Many thanks to cretemixer for the bottle."
"Medium-full body, nicely carbonated and about as drinkable as they come for my tastes. It just satisfies all the senses without numbing your mind ""too"" much."
"Served from a frighteningly decorated 22oz bomber, acquired on a recent trip to Indianapolis. Been looking forward to trying it for a while. The Alpha Klaus pours out an deep dark suede brown with a creamy and persistent dart tan head. Aroma is surprising and mouthwatering, a unique blend of roasty chocolate notes and a very hearty dose of citrusy hops. Taste is amazing, different and leaves you craving more. It has everything a great porter should, lots of good roasty flavor and complexity with hints of chocolate and coffee drifting across your tongue. But just as you're starting to appreciate the perfect traditional porter flavor the hops grab you and make you sit up and listen, lots of crisp grapefruity flavor. A surprisingly good match, very well done brew, a bit too drinkable perhaps, as I wish I had lots more..."
"This is something that I was really looking forward to at the Southeastern Ratebeer gathering. Very dark brown. The huge aroma is screaming spruce at me. The malt is dry and clean and really comes across as a dry brown ale than a porter. Still, it's tasty and one of the few dark beers I've had that had dominant hops that I really think work that way."
"Drinkability. The 22oz bomber was drained in no time, and I was craving more. This is definately one of the best, if not the best Porter brewed in the good ole' US of A!"
"Highly Recommended!"
"Thank You Dale!!"
"Maybe I didn't have the best bottle? Maybe some of the extra flavors disappeared on the shelves over a few months? Alpha Klaus was quite interesting, but not as good as I'd hoped."
"Thanks to CRJMellor for this hop bomb!"
"After smelling it, the real surprise was that it managed to have a real solid, balanced flavor. The hops are nearly 100% aromatic. Slick hot fudge flavors dominate and find themselves laying in the toaster oven blackening to a nice roasted flavor. A little thin but not really to any sort of detriment -- and exceptionally drinkable. Hops show up as the roasted cocoa fades and dominate the aftertaste. Just really kind of an odd mix in the nose...but intriguing! Thnx to Tim for the sample!"
"This is a hell of a unique porter...unlike any I've had before...hat's off to them for their creativity...this has the feel of a ""Special Occasion"" beer...I wouldn't want to drink it everyday like I would Dreadnaught, but I would greatly anticipate enjoying a bottle or two every winter.."
"Pours very deep brown with a dark off-white head. Aroma confused the heck out of me, was this a chocolate IPA ? Heavy, resiny hop aroma that hides some dark chocolate notes. Had some folks at my house give it a whiff and the range of answers was pine trees to marijuana. Taste was roasted coffee, semi-sweet chocolate and the overpowering hop bitterness. If you sat down 10 blindfolded folks, at least 9 of them would guess this an IPA by aroma and taste. Mouthfeel was good but I look for a little more chewiness and depth in a porter."
"Impressive. Good for listening to Nascar soundtracks with headphones. Not for any food other than packaged, powdered, flavor crystalized corn puffs or cheesy cream vegan burgers."
"The Klaus poured a deep mahogany color that when held up to the light looked a deep cherry red. Head was thick and airy which slowly reduced in size. The aroma is an insane amount of hops that seem to be primarily cascade but I could be wrong. Really pine-like and reminding me of spruce and Christmas trees. Theres an underlying aroma of roasted malt and hints of cocoa or chocolate. This is definitely not normal. Think a cascade chocolate malt. Body is creamy and smooth. Flavor is most original in my opinion. Almost indesrcribable. Hops are really in the flavor and its taking me some time to get a grip on this brew. Theres a good amount of chocolate malt here giving some cocoa flavors along with the piney citrus hop flavors that are trying to blend. Im not sure whether they really do though. Has some uncomfortable bitterness in the finish. By the way, the alcohol is invisible but slowly kicking in. Overall a very unique seasonal. One I enjoyed, yet one that puzzled me to no end."
"Enjoyed this at its Release Party at the Map Room, courtesy of Nick Floyd. Solid brown body, with a thin, lacy head. Very low alcohol taste, but that's only the perception. Rides the very thin line between chewy and watery mouthfeel like a porter should, but with the addition of the 3 Floyds mouth full of hop pellets effect. Hop effect cant help but overrun the chocolate malt taste. Starts out somewhat grapefruitty, but then hangs around when youve finished to playfully bitch slap your uvula!"
"22 oz bottle. Poured a deep brown with reddish highlights, massive tan head that slowly receded, and lots of lacing on the glass. Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, and hops. Taste is more of the same, malty with chocolate and coffee hints. Just as with their Dreadnaught, 3F's know how to use just the right amount of hops to give it that distinctive flavor, without the harsh bitterness. This is one smooth drinking beer. I need to pick me up a few more of these!"
"The beer disembogues a deep brown to almost black with ruby high lights and the head behemothic in size, spumous in texture and the color a beauteous light tan with the resultant lace a thick sheet welded to the glass to seal it from the light. Marvelous floral aroma at the front, sweet toasted malt, molasses, crisp and a real treat for the schnozzle this one with the start ambrosial and nicely malted, top is middling in its feel to the senses. Finish is temperate in its acidity and the hops puissant in their spiciness, quite dry and long lasting aftertaste. One of the best porters I have had in years, and certainly will move into my porter top ten"
"Furthermore, Alpha Klaus possesses an uncanny drinkability. I don't care if this beer is 10% abv and is only available in a handy 22-ounce economy size bomber, every bit is savored. I love this beer and anxiously await its release each year."
"Dark black color. Medium head. Aroma is chocolate malts and floral hops. A medium bodied porter. The roasted chocolate malts are offset by a surprising amount of grapefruity hops. A flavor fest: chocolate, coffee, vanilla, cheery/berries and caramel. Smooth taste. Very well balanced. Soft round taste. Very nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"This porter poured jet black with creamy, tan foam that coated the glass a bit. The smell was strong, ""chewy", green hops (floral) with a bit of dark malt. The taste was dominated by the hops but the malt almost balanced with flavors of chocolate, cocoa, and caramel. The mouthfeel was smooth, and relatively sweet and a bit fruity. The body was medium with medium carbonation. This was a very nice porter -- kind of a Porter meets IPA. Very enjoyable as a porter and as a highly hopped ale. This keg had apparently lost much of its spiciness after 7+ months cellaring."
"bottled by hoprus. Originally sampled on 19 December 2002. Yet another winner from Three Floyds has been poured into my glass. Alpha Klaus has a roasty flavor w/ coffee tones along with hints of cinnamon. It is medium bodied and brown/dark red in color. Very nice"
"(Tasted this beer at the Blind Tiger's Three Floyds event)"
" I am surprised my numbers came out so high but when I look back, I dont want to change a thing. I just took another sip.... IMHO its nearly as good as it gets."
"A truely astounding brew from 3f, and *dare I say it* probably even better than Dreadnaught!"
