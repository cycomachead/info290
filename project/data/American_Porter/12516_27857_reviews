"Good but not great, and I would drink it again. Unique name and branding, but nothing really special about this porter."
"O- A decent porter. It's up my alley but not quite in my wheelhouse- I'd prefer a little more hops note and not quite as smoky. But I'd recommend this to another porter lover."
""
""
""
"Overall really good beer with a good coffee and Carmel taste"
""
""
""

"O: [3.75] A good example of a robust porter.  I am certain that you could session a few of these.  The go down smoothly and have a nice flavor profile.  Improvements would be elevated chocolate flavors and aroma and slightly more body."

"This is a sentimental beer for me, you know one of those that just brings back great memories... so ratings might be a little high but still a great beer I'll drink over and over."
"even though it only one state over I really don't see this one in PA that often, shame because it a very nice porter both on tap and in the bottle format. Rich bitter chocolate with a nice roasted coffee back taste, which I saw more of it in my area."

"Not great but very drinkable"

"Overall this was a solid beer. No flaws to it but also nothing outstanding about it. This beer was on my want list for years, glad I got to try it, another tasty beer from Thirsty Dog."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is a little overcarbonated, but light. Overall, it's fairly good."
""
""
"O: Easy to drink and very enjoyable, a nice beer for the cold of autumn/winter. Definitely worth grabbing. Alcohol is very well hidden."

"O- It skews a little sweeter than I prefer for the style, but the dark fruit notes are pleasant and uniquely prominent for the style.  It is missing a lot of the chocolate and coffee notes I really enjoy in most porters though. 3.5"

"Don't get me wrong, I""m enjoying this, but there are 40 taps in front of me & in that environment my thirst may be quenched, but my curiosity lingers."

"O: This is the kind of beer that turned me off to the whole robust porter style. I'd probably struggle to finish it and give the rest away. This is a perfectly average robust porter, if not below average."
"Overall: Porters are one of my favorite styles, but its hard for me to find one that i truly love. I usually stick with my top 3 (Eddy Fitz, Founders, Smuttynose), and Old Leghumper gives me justice as to why. Not enough balance between roasted and chocolate malts, and I get a stale quality to it. It also goes down like water and I prefer my beers to be full bodied. I consider this a third tier porter, under the 3 i previously listed as top tier, and Black Butte being second tier. Still above average for the style and a decent offering"

"Mouthfeel: This is a rather thick porter it is oily, it is almost stout like."

"Overall- This is a good beer to sit down with and have with a dinner. I might buy this beer again. definitely not a session beer. I do like this though but for some reason this beer is a little harder for me to judge."
""
""
""
""
"I like this beer. I think it's a solid offering I would never turn down. I'd be quite interested to know how it tastes from the tap, in fact. However, I don't think I'd spring at the chance to purchase my next six pack. Recommended if you're into porters and like to try all that the style offers."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy very dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, biscuit, light coffee, herbal, floral, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate hop notes; with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, biscuit, caramel, light coffee, herbal, floral, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roast/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, biscuit, caramel, light coffee, herbal, floral, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors with light-moderate hop presence; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice porter. All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
""
"Dark pour with a very deep dark ruby cast. Nice head and a lacing that lasts well enough. Nose is sweet dark malt - caramel with a touch of chocolate. Almost medium bodied with normal carbonation. The flavor profile is nice and a bit complex. It begins with the dark malts delivering a caramel and coffee taste against a slightly sweet background, progresses to a slight roast bitterness and finishes cleanly with a carbonation burst with a hint of smoke. Quite nice!"

"O: Decent porter from Thirsty Dog; definitely a beer to consider when you want something dark that isn't too chewy or sweet."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, not sure when it was bottled. Pours a dark brown, with a one inch tan head that leaves behind some webs of lace. Smell is vanilla, chocolate, bread, butterscotch, and almonds. Taste is dominated buy vanilla and butterscotch, but nice. Body medium to thin, good amount of life, not really dry, and easy drinking. Solid porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A bit light on the flavor, but a decent example of the style."
""
"Feel: Soft, low carbonation. Full bodied. Creamy smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
"I can't believe I have not tried this beer until now. I just always shyed away from some of the local breweries. This brew has an excellent finish. Just the right note of chocolate/coffee on start up and finishes smoother than most beers I have ever tried. Definitely worth grabbing a six pack for a try. I will buy again!!"
""
"I would have easily mistaken this for a stout. But, it's a porter. Either way, this is one delicious beer. I love the dark mysterious flavors. Definitely a dark chocolate flavor with many more deeper flavors that buzz me with delight and wonder! There is something very gritty within this flavor.... like something has been ground down to is most bare element and then brewed into a smooth concoction! Great stuff!"

"Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side. It's very easy to drink. I got this in a sample pack so I can't say if its worth the price but I will go out on a limb and say that there are some much better equally priced porters on the market."

"The mouthfeel is average, with the right levels of carbonation. Overall, this is a decent porter, but nothing I would chase down, or choose to drink again. There are simply better options available at the same price point."

"Overall/Comments: This was a very respectable offering that I really enjoyed. I was a bit underwhelmed by Old Leghumper and would have love to see a bit more body. Classified as and American Porter @ 6.7% ABV. Consumed 2-22-13."

"O - 4's across the board on my rating, but this actually ranks as one of my favs in my mind. I wouldn't mind having a six pack of this in the fridge."

"This is a pretty run of the mill porter. The citrus was different but faint. It was primarily roasted malts with a light coffee-like bitterness. It has decent flavor and is highly drinkable. Itâ€™s worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"I do enjoy how it is not a sweet porter. More of an ashy, burn, dark flavor. In contrast to a dessert porter. I'm a long time fan of the brewery, but not my favorite porter."
""
"pour is dark brown with red edges and fluffy dark tan head. Nose is light cake batter, toasty grain, a little bitter coffee and some herbal hop in the finish. Taste is actually citrusy, light herbal hop, sweet caramel and notes of milk chocolate underneath. Body is light, smooth, low carb, velvety and creamy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle from Big Red Bloomington, IN. Poured in snifter. Pours pitch place with half finger head and a nice reddish brown head. The aroma is chocolate malt with a roasted smell. Medium body, taste upfront has roasted chocolate malt and a milky cream taste in the background. Lactose and sugar seem apparent in the finish to give a chocolaty milk taste. Overall a good porter but not full bodied/flavored leaving some missing taste."
"The mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and rich. Not the most complex Porter, but a very solid representation of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The score here is a combination of the quality of the beer as I drank it 2 weeks ago and the obvious problems with this one."
"O - Overall this is a good beer. Not my favorite porter, but one that I will gladly return to."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this is a pretty solid brew that I would have again."
""
""
"This came in a mixed sixer from Ryan & Casey in Greenfield, Mass. Very good, basic, but tasty porter."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good example of the style. The roast character is not overwhelming, and alcohol is only evident in the aroma and as a slight warmth. Chocolate malt and nuttiness are well represented. Perhaps a touch sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Rich aroma has notes of caramel, molasses and roast quality coffee with a touch of licorice. It pours an opaque warm sable just a couple whiskers above black and a fairly thick and fluffy light tan head. Flavor has good smoky, molasses, coffee and caramel notes. Dusty texture has slightly above average body but not a whole lot of fizz. This one is worth sniffing out."

"I've had much better experiences with this beer, so I'm rating it a little higher than this experience. Still nothing special. 3.5"
""
""

"M: Medium bodied with great coating and pleasant aftertaste. I think the aftertaste is more telling of the beer than the actual sip."

"Pretty rich and robust, the feel is another way in which the Americanization of the porter includes making it bigger. It's nice and smooth initially, with a bit of a bite at the beginning. Dryness kicks in not long from the beginning."

"Overall, familiar porter flavors, just a bit more kick. A lot to like here."

"Overall I thought that this was a slightly above average American Porter that drank well on this cold and snowy night in Michigan. This was a pretty straightforward American Porter that was all about the roasted malts. This beer had Ok drinkability, this one went down smooth but I think after one the sweetness would start to get to me. What I liked most about this beer was the robust and chocolaty aroma and taste, it had just enough roast for the style and the added chocolate flavor was nice and made this beer stick out a little. What I liked least about this beer was the mouthfeel and the high amount of sweetness, the body and carbonation need some work and the sweetness got to be a little much once this beer warmed up. I wouldn't turn this beer down but I don't think I would buy it again, for the same price I can get Founders Porter and it is just as robust but not as sweet with a much better body. This is worth of a shot if your really like the style but I just don't thin it's a top tier American Porter. I was glad I gave this beer a try and it was pretty solid but there were more then a couple things that kept this from being a great American Porter, another solid example from Thirsty Dog, good job guys, I will be searching out more of your beers."
""
"O: pretty good beer, a good amount of sweetness and bitterness but definitely more bitter than sweet but I appreciate the woody characteristic and the other subtle flavors."
"Was in Cleveland for a youth hockey tournament and was able to try Old Leghumper from Thirsty Dog. The beer poured a clear dark amber with a thin slight off white head that laced nicely. Roast malt, peaty earth comprise of the scent. Taste is roast malt and mocha, just a hint of coffee. The mouthfeel is a medium body with good carbonation. Overall it is a decent porter."
""

""
""
""
""

""

""

"Overall: A little on the weak tasting side for my personal preferences in porters and stouts, but the classic porter malts and aroma, combined with respectable ABV, makes this a porter worth checking out."
""
""
""
"Leaves a roasted flavor in your mouth after the dryness disappear. More coffee late in the aftertaste, thank god. Its the savior of the beer."

"A porter that is perfect for my palate and has everything I enjoy in a porter."
"Overall, this is a solid offering, but I wish it had a touch more intensity. As it gets warmer it gets a bit richer and the aftertaste starts to shine, however it still seems a bit light initially. I'm sure others would like it more than I. It's a great brew, but a little bit away from my tastes."
"Overall, I'm happy with Old Leghumper. The smell could be a little more interesting to match the taste, but this is a very drinkable beer, and I would probably be interested in getting ahold of some more down the road. However, I won't be rushing out to buy a case of it any time soon. There are just too many other beers yet to try!"
"O - A nice porter overall. This wasn't nearly as bold and flavorful as I remember it being on tap at their brewery, but it's solid nonetheless. I would recommend it to any fan of porters and dark beers."
"Pours a midnight black body with a negligible head that disappears in an instant. Totally non- lacing. Scent is of french roast coffee/ burnt chocolate. Taste is bit bitter and overperked coffee, this kind of reminds me of Russian Imperial Stout in many respects."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was robust for sure. It poured a really crappy head that was gone instantly. The beer was a pretty black rich color though. The beer smelled like burnt chocolate. The beer was fruity and had a burnt wine taste to it. I liked the beer well enough to try it again."
"Dark brown, almost black. Chocolate head. The foam was weak. I could smell some roasty notes, maybe a little malt and hops. The taste was a good and strong coffee like taste with chocolate. I thought the beer was quite drinkable. I don't think I would have trouble drinking several of these at one sitting."
"Pours a dark opaque brown colour with creamy tan head. Some rings of lacing around the glass. Smells of nice roasted malt with some bitter coffee. Flavour is a nice full roast, fairly sweet. Mouthfeel was a little bit thin, but a very nice porter overall."
"A bit over carbonated for a porter IMO. It's a bit slippery on the tongue as well. so like watery and overcarbonated somehow, haha. a meh beer for me."
"o - a pleasant surprise, dark enough, and plenty flavorful enough for the style. a nice change of pace from many of the other burnt porter offerings out there."
"Overall this was not a well balanced porter, very dry, very dry with a strong bitterness. A little more sweetness would have balanced this beer very nicely."
"Good dark porter. One of my favorites, but not the best. Has a good taste bit of a bitter bight on the end of it. depends what your into when looking at American porters, but its not a real heavy thick beer in my experience. But it has a distinct taste"
"Roasty and quite dry, bitterness keeps everything in check. Simple, but balanced robust porter, enjoyed it."
"A solid offering that is sure to please coffee fans."
"Black as night with a rich tan colored head that reached a height of at least two inches before settling down to a respectable inch of head that did not go away. Lots of chocolate and coffee leading the way here. Hints of molasses as well. Huge flavor here, maybe the best tasting porter I have come across. Lots of cocoa and chocolate, rich, huge flavor with a smooth creaminess that was second to none in my eyes. Really fantastic balance here as the chocolate really starts to come out as it warms. Lots of flavor here with a ton of mellow notes that were just all over the place"
"Good beer, recommended, although I do feel I've had better porters."
"Overall I will not buy this again since I can think of way more balanced porters that are less dry. I guess I can't love every beer."
"Very black with an off-white head that dissipated quickly. Aroma was strongly of coffee, maybe some dark chocolate; not very pronounced but still pleasant and rich. Taste was also of coffee with a slight sweetness. In fact, if it didn't have the warmth of alcohol behind it, it would have tasted very similar to a good, dark cup of coffee. Faint cardboard taste in the finish. Medium body, moderate-high carbonation."
"Cola brown with mahogany highlights. Creamy tan head with nice retention and plentiful streaky lacing. A pleasing balance of roasted and chocolate aromas, heavier on the roasted end of things. Flavors are bolder than anticipated. In particular, acrid burnt malt and earthy hops are surprising, but not at all out of place. Sweet chocolate and a touch of citrus develop midswallow. Things are quite dry and roasty at the swallow,though. Long satisfying roasty finish. Very enjoyable porter here."
"O: One of the better porters out there. I searched it out, simply for the name. Yet, the beer within was most definitely a hidden prize."
"Overall a well done porter. Worthy of a visit and a job well done Thirtydog."
"What started off so promising fell flat when it mattered most. An ok beer to try once, but when my six pack is over I'll look forward to something different."
"pretty drinkable, but nothing special. seems to fit the style. i have a hard time believing this is a gold medal winner."
"M- Very creamy and full. Just as a robust porter should be."
"Overall - an excellent beer. More of a slow sipper than I expected."
"O- Not a bad beer, I was hoping for the wood flavors to stand out more in the taste like i got in the nose but the bitterness was a pleasant surprise. An enjoyable porter, but i've better."
"O - Easy drinking, but nothing special."
"Pours a dark brown color. 1/3 inch head of a tan color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, hint of coffee, hint of oatmeal, and a hint of hops. Fits the style of an American Porter. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, hops, sweet malt, slight coffee, and a hint of chocolate. Overall, a good aroma, body, and blend."
"not bad overall, It's an ok porter but there is just something lacking for me."
"Overall, this is pretty good, though the thin mouthfeel knocks it well below Founder's porter. Pretty solid overall, and paired nicely with some acorn squash."
"Food Pairing: Beef, BBQ, Dense Desserts, Stews, Ham, Smoked Meats, Goat Cheese, Gouda"
"This was a good porter, nice full flavor and pretty easy to drink."
"Overall, this basically tastes like a fundamental, old-school porter which is great. However, I wanted the tastes to shine through a bit more. B"
"O: Overall, a pretty bland porter without much depth."
"Seemed rather weak, certainly not robust like the label says. Foam head disappates quickly. Not as thick/rich as I expected. Smell and taste are a little sweet, but largely benign. Flavors all seem to be muted ... nothing jumps out. I've been drinking Imperial Stouts lately ... that could be my problem with this beer."
"O: No complaints here. I like porters and while I've had better, Thirsty Dog is a local brewery that always puts out solid products and this is no exception. It would be a good introduction to the style for someone who typically drinks lighter beers."
"Overall very drinkable and one of my favorite porters that I've had in a while."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, this is a good drinker. A bit thin for the style, but that just makes it more sessionable."
"She got legs and Old Yeller knows how to hump them. Great dark ruby-brown color with a little lacing head. Smells fruity and a little note of yeast. Taste of banana and nut bread with a clean cool finish. Overall this porter is lighter and sweeter than most. It is not the Lebron James of beer maybe they should try to brew this in Miami."
"Picked up a bottle of this mainly because of the label. Found out that it was a decent porter that wasn't overwhelming. Strong coffee like flavor with an odd smell to it. Not all that bad really. Rich black color with some brown around the edges of the glass."
"OverallI enjoyed the beer and glad I had a chance to finally try one. Its not something that I would go out and purchase a six pack of but at the same time I wouldn't turn it down if I had a chance to have it again."
"Easy to drink and not harsh at all"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is good, roasted malts, chocolate, some hints of coffee. Taste is the same, very malty, some chocolate with a touch of coffee. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a fine quality beer."
"This beer poured a dark brown almost black color with just a little bit of head which quickly dissipated. The smell consisted of roasted malts with a hint of chocolate. The taste was very malty with the chocolate and roasted malt character coming to the forefront. The taste was a little bitter and not as smooth as I like porters to be. The carbonation was actually fine. I thought it was going to be a little flat due to the lack of head from the poor, but the carbonation was just right. I think this is a one and done beer for me. The name is catchy, but there are much better porters out there."
"I had a pint of this on-tap once and I got tired of it halfway through the beer. The bottle that I reviewed was the same story. It's not a bad beer, but it is disappointing. The simple solution would be to just increase the grain bill. This needs more malts, more body, and more flavor."
"Pours a deep amber to black color with a light tan head. In the aroma, roasty coffee. In the taste, somewhat bitter and roasty coffee. A bitter and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry roast, and coffee aftertaste. Nice coffee presence and mellow, enjoyable, but nothing exciting."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a dimpled mug. A solid brown pour, but light gets through fairly easily. Small cream colored head. Sticks the the glass fairly well. Roast malt, peaty earth aroma. Taste is roast malt and mocha, just a hint of coffee. Medium body that borders on creamy. Finish is earthy, clean. Not a bad porter, that smoothes into the flavors nicely as it warms a little. Just not my style with this one."
"D: The bitter taste combined with the carbonation really clashes in a really negative way, which was rather surprising."
"Poured from the bottle with a deep, opaque cola brown color, but even a vigorous pour yielded only a cracker-thin cream-colored head. The aroma was bold and multi-layered, with both a lactose-like sweetness and a rich nuttiness. The flavor was likewise rich with characteristics of milk-chocolate and roasted cashews. The small, prickly carbonation was energizing but also largely distracting (even thought it also covered the moderately high alcohol level). Overall, although it misses in certain areas, this porter presents a robust combination of sweet, roasty, and nutty flavors, plus there needs to be some bonus credit for a great name."
"I had high expectations, so I suppose that's why I graded it so harshly, it hurts. I like Thirsty Dog, they do some really good stuff.. but this is a complete miss. Old Leghumper has no characteristics that I look for in a porter.. it's definitely not robust. In the world of porters, I can't recommend this one."
"D - Pretty drinkable but too boring and ordinary to ever get again."
"Acidic roasted malt flavor, the beer I tasted almost had a sour aftertaste; I'm not sure if it was off. (I had a bit of a cold) I would like to try again to update the review. Vanilla notes come through after a few sips. A decent beer; I'd like to try it on draft."
"The taste starts roasted and malty smooth with little carbonation The taste of coffee and chocolate enter as the carbonation builds and leaves a dry finish"
"I'm really a big fan of a good porter. Eddy Fitz is my all time favorite, but this porter is also good. I enjoy having it as a stand by in my fridge when I am not trying new things. Overall, good beer that is easy going down."
"Very solid porter! Can't say much more than that."
"Clear dak brownish plumb purple color. Tan two finger head dissapates to thin face cover with pretty good lacing on glass. Aroma has a lot of coffee. Some chocolate and maltiness but predominately picking up coffee. Modarate carbonation. Earthy start. Almost a plumbish raisiny fruit taste in swallow. Malty in middle. Almost a spicey fruity thing goin on at end. Dry finish and aftertaste, some smokey raisin in aftertaste. At end of glass, leaves a very impressive lacing, quite a fan. Overall not bad."
"Pours a motor oil black color with a thick brown head that goes away quickly and leaves a little lacing. Smells of roasted malts, and booze. Tastes of roasted malts, burnt sugar, sweet malts, coffee, and hints of chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium and very nice. Drinkability is great. A great beer."
"All in all, eh, this is nothing spectacular. It's a decent brew, just not a great brew. Only try if you have access, don't worry otherwise."
"D - Average porter with average drinkability, the label cracks me up, but that's about it. Maybe I'm just too spoiled with Edmund Fitzgerald."
"A decent porter, and one I'm sure to have again since it is local."
"Drinkqability To the extent it's a Porter to lure Pilsner and Lager drinkers,it's drinkable. For me? I can get Edmund Fitz at the same price. Nuff said."
"mouthfeel is higher carbonation that expected for a porter. medium body. not quite as smooth as some in the style."
"This is how Porter's are to taste!!! This poured nice into a 16 oz Guiness draft glass. The color was pitch black with a nice brown head. The taste was out of this world!!! None of that burnt grains taste that some porters try to pull off. I don't know why they try for that taste? This was a GREAT Porter that I will go and get some more of. I don't know why people like Great Lakes Edmond Fitzgerald so much? My personal opinion is that this is far better and a most enjoyable beer."
"very drinkable robust porter"
"Well done porter. Would buy again."
"MD- Creamy and smooth. I am not a huge stout fan, bu this is a nice middle ground. A very good beer for a cool fall evening."
"D - Pretty drinkable and an all around solid porter. One of the better one's that I think I can find around me. Worth picking up if you are in the mood for a solid porter."
"Pours black with large off-white head that sticks around for a while. Mmmm...aroma of milk chocolate-covered marshmallow bars, slight tangy grape, raisins. Flavors slight chocolate, raisins, tang, malty sweetness, toffee, coffee beans and tang ride out the drink. Medium-bodied with very light carbonation. A good porter worth giving a shot."
"D: I liked having one - I could have had another, but that would have been the max. The sticky sweetness is a bit too much for me."
"Picked up a single at a liquor store to sample. Poured into a stemmed glass. Dark brown in color with auburn highlights. Not as much head as I would have expected. Some lacing on the glass. Smell was chocolate up front then coffee as you breathed more. Very appetizing. Flavor was just as good. Cocoa and roasted coffee beans dominate. There was also a caramel sweetness that lurked in the background. Mouthfeel was good, but I prefer my porters to be a bit thicker. Drinkability was great, as it's flavor and mellow body made this beer a treat to drink. Paired this evening with an oak smoked cheddar cheese from the UK."
"Drinkability: tasty and quite drinkable. I just wish this beer were more available out here in the Pacific Northwest."
" Humpers go down rather nicely with no big time alch. burn/flavor getting in the way, wish the restuarant was still there to get these babies fresh on tap, Very Good Brew!"
"Overall: Well made brew. I like my porters a little bit chewier in mouthfeel. Pretty in your face with roast and alcohol."
"Overall I was pleasantly surprised. A very good porter that has a real roasted flavor and it's really enjoyable. I will no doubt seek these out in the future. Very good beer."
" Body is a creamy and a little rich, but not thick. This is a fairly easy-drinking porter, sweet but not too sweet, robust but not overly thick. It's my first encounter with a Thirsty Dog beer, and I look forward to trying more of their lineup."
"Pours a dark brown color with a large tan head that had very good retentio before settling to a thick cap. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Aroma is a bit muted but I do pick up hints of chocolate and roasted malt. About what one expects in a porter. Nice flavor. Quite a bit of chocolate and just a little coffee. Bitterness is low and hops are not detectable. Alcohol is well hidden. Good body. Feels robust enough and nicely carbonated. A good porter but is not terribly exciting either. The ABV is a little high so that limits drinkability."
"D: A solidly drinkable American porter."
"d - A decent porter. Wasn't the biggest fan of the smell; I thought it was mostly roasted malts and alcohol. Thought the taste was better balanced and very easy to drink. Would give another shot."
"It strikes a great porter balance despite the ABV."
"Normally I wouldn't let leghumpers near me (maybe it's just me), but this one looks tasty enough. It pours a translucent dark garnet-brown topped by about a finger of ecru foam. The nose comprises pepper, molasses, brown sugar, roasted and toasted malts, and a hint of sharp hoppy florals in the background. The taste forces the pepper and malts to the fore, backed by something akin to smoked leather and salmon (seriously...am I on acid...?). Some hoppy bitters lurk in the shadows, stabbing seemingly random passersby, but never really coming into the light. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lingering ashy finish. Overall, a decent porter, but the roast is a bit much, too far on the smokey side to be porter-ly effective. Pretty good nonetheless, though. Worth a shot if you see it and like the darker side of brewing."
"Let it warm up a little and it's even better."
"my first thirsty dog beer, they just started distributing around here :D"
"Pours black with red tints, and a small mocha head. Smells of roasted malt with sweet notes and a hint of alcohol. The taste starts and ends with the roasted malt, no real sweet flavors, finishes with a subtle smoky aftertaste. The mouthfeel is disappointing, a very light beer, watery for a porter, not very rich, or complex flavor. This is an easy drinker, nice flavor but that is where the beer ends. Nothing special, but still enjoyable."
"I am pleased with this beer. If you're in the mood for a darker beer and haven't given this one a shot, go ahead and try it. May not be as complex as other porters, but it holds its own in a very demanding category of beers."
"D: Not as full bodied as I would expect, actually a bit smooth and easily drinkable. Could pair nicely with a grilled steak or piece of beef."
"Not my favorite style but a great representation of an American porter. Maybe it's something about Northern Ohio, they make great porters."
"A very nice robust porter."
"D-I can't get over that vegetable note I'm getting. I'll definetely have to give this beer another go-around. If only this bottle had a date code so I knew how old it is."
"I'm loving this with some Kerrygold Irish Cheddar"
"The palate opens with a pretty big bitterness a blend of earthy hops and roasted malt, with the hops being in the forefront. Mildly ashy, even, this is slightly like burnt toast without enough of a malt backbone to make it particularly enjoyable. The roasted bitterness is quite complex, though, bringing to mind very dark chocolate, coffee grounds and just a little burnt sugar?I'm definitely getting some fruity character, there's a definite yeasty fruitiness with some raisins. Drying, a little burnt and a little ashy on the finish, this beer is medium-light in body with moderate carbonation. The alcohol is quite well hidden too."
"Fairly dry finish throughout. Hoppier in aftertaste than in taste. Medium/full body, tight effervescence. Very good, a solid brew if not a real standout."
"I poured into a pint glass to a half inch of tan head. It is brown in color. The aroma is chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt. It has a nice robust flavor, featuring unsweetened chocolate, black coffee. It has a nice creamy mouthfeel and is a good beer."
"A well-brewed Porter that's just shy of being as robust as we'd like, but it's got balance. You could definitely have a session of these and not lose interest, but allow this one to warm before drinking so you can pick up all of its nuances. Try pitting it against some grilled pork chops, blackened fish or a sweet chocolate dessert."
"D: This may have been a gold medal winner in 2002, but this recipe needs to be updated to match the big flavor and smoothness of other American porters. Fine but I won't be buying again."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this brew. Only bought one and might buy a sixer next time."
"F: A little bitter and spicy actually. Bitterness from both roasted earthy malts and some spicy hops. A little earthy dry taste from more of the roastedness. A little chocolate as well late on the finish, that carries with the roasted malts."
"D- would have never guessed 6.7% abv, this one drinks like something around 4%. flavorful and tasty but not too bold and a truly great example of the style."
"Drinkability: Session quality"
"O: Overall a great example of a proper porter, and a fine brew from Thirsty Dog Brewing In Ohio."
"D- I honestly don't know if i would go out of my way to get this one again. But, like any beer, worth a try."
"D - if it was not for that opening flavor I wolf drink this, but unfortunately I have to pass."
"D: It is tasty and has a low enough ABV to drink a sixer."
"This isn't as robust or as oatmeal-smooth as some, but overall it does a really good job at an American Porter."
"D - Overall I think this beer is mostly impressive. Very solid & at 6.7% abv, it's not unreasonable to have a few. It's a good effort, but when reaching for a porter it would be hard to reach for this one while in Great Lakes distribution. Just sayin'..."
"D- A very solid porter. Drinks nice for the style."
"A slight disappointment from the Thirsty Dog camp."
"M: A nice, chocolate-forward porter from Thirsty Dog. Pleasantly drinkable while offering a somewhat sweeter interpretation of the style. If I had to criticize, I'd prefer it to be a bit chewier at 6.7% abv, but this is a nicely crafted beer regardless."
"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into pint glass. Dark brown with slight tan head with decent retention, and some decent lacing. Malty nutty sweetness with caramel, and a bit of citrus notes. Roasty malt and crisp hoppy finish. Heavy carbonation, medium body. Not my favorite, but not bad."
"OK beer, nothing crazy, but it did take me back to the days of the old brewery in Fairlawn."
"this beer pours a nice dark translucent brown with red highlights and a rocky tan head that recedes to a solid layer of lace. the aroma immediately brings the roasted dark malt to mind, with just a bit of sweetness. the sweetness catches up with you at the first sip, but the dry dark roasted malt kicks in and is complimented nicely by the bit of hop bitterness at the end. the medium body and adequate co2 make this a pretty drinkable porter"
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice roasted malt scent that's dry and toasted along with a light chocolate malt sweetness. The taste is good as well. It has an excellent roasted character. There is a bit of chocolate malt sweetness for complexity, but a dry, roasted flavor dominates the profile. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a well brewed porter. It's true to style and damn tasty."
"A medium body and a little thin. This is a very drinkable porter."
"Drinkability- Actually, I downed a six-pack and a half before reviewing this beer (not in one night) so i'd have to go with ""quite drinkable"" On really analyzing it however, there are definitely some areas that could be improved."
"Pours a nice deep brown with some good initial head, and has just a bit of lacing. Very deep scent, huge burnt grain with very nice coffee tones. Thick and dark flavor, coffee throughout with excellent burnt grains and a hint of chocolate. Goes down fine, nice and thick, but with a slight alcohol tinge to it. Nice stout porter."
"Drinkability: this has some characteristics of a great beer, but others (thin-body) leave you wanting more. enjoyable, but lacking."
"Overall, solid. Most of it is a nice basic porter, the kind you could drink easily with a meal or by itself in quantity. The thing that helps this out in all aspects, though, is the Baltic aspect. It's your general US porter but with a nice Baltic note that makes it just -that- much nicer than any basic porter. Good stuff."
"D- A decent porter that is worth trying."
"d - Good beer to drink now that its getting colder. A 6 pack also makes a good conversation starter."
"Cheers!!!"
"D:Very drinkable would buy agian and would buy it by it buy the case next time."
"Other than the slightly thin body, this is a superior porter. First surprise is that the beer is quite dry. The swallow features a hop bitterness, but the aftertaste is dark chocolate. Wonderfully complex. I note the alcohol level. Even though it is low, it's more than most porters. Overall, it is an easy-to-drink and flavorful beer."
"Drinkability: A nice porter with some robust qualities. This would, and does, make a nice fall brew. I would certainly revisit again."
"Not as good as its best reviews here, not as bad as its worst. Crisp and quick, a nice beer. It suffers from comparison for not being big enough, I think. But it's OK. I'd have to cycle through a lot of 6-packs of other stuff before I got back to this, but if I was at someone's house and they offered Old Leg I woudn't ask for a Diet Coke instead."
"Pours a dark brown color with hints of red around the edges and a slight head. The smell is faint and has notes of chocolate and coffee as well as a caramel malt. Taste wise there is a chocolate and coffee backbone with caramel as well, with just a hint of hops to balance out the flavor, the problem is that the flavor is weak and leaves you wanted something more bold. The mouthfeel is smooth and slightly watery. The drinkability is so so, you could drink a lot of them but the taste and the smell leave you walking away."
"d - Due to mild nature of flavor very drinkable, despite lack of flavor."
"The beer is very drinkable and good, but not great."
"Pours a dark brown with a thin tan head. Nose has grassy hops, roasted malts, chocolate and coffee. Taste a bit on the light side, but well balanced and a good drinker. More cocoa with burnt malst and espresso beans. Body seems a bit light. Great ale to wash down some fish and chips."
"D- Very good beer for drinking many of, not overpowering and smooth"
"This poured a hazy dark mahogany with some tan head. It smelled like fresh coffee and cream with some milk chocolate and roasted barley. It tasted much the same, with roasted coffee and cream dominating the flavor, along with some milk chocolate and roasted barley. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a mild bitter aftertaste. Overall this had a fairly basic flavor, but it was very clean and tasty. It had good body too, and was super easy to drink. This is a great simple porter. Nothing too exciting, but perfect for a regular drinking beer."
"A: Thin layer of thick, small bubbles, the color of a dark cherry, nice spotting along the side of the glass - 4.50, S: Strong sweet grain aromas, some charring and burnt espresso, a bit on the earthy side - 3.50, T: A little ashy on the tongue, very mild hop bite, possible rye, far amount of malt and lots of specialty grains - 3.50, M: Creamy on the front but light on the tail - 3.75, D: A very drinkable porter - 3.50"
"Overall - Like eating a fine desert. What a great American Porte"
"Bottle. Pours a dark brown with a small light tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, smoked meats (very light), and sweet malt. Flavor of the same--roasted and smoky malts, some crystal malt and tea-like notes. Palate is a little thin but not too bad. Pretty decent for a porter, I was a little surprised actually!"
"Decent beer, reminds me of a otter stovepipe."
"This was my 300th review - come on Old Leghumper as the 300th review? Had I not had to drive back to Mass, I would have sessioned with this on this Memorial Day!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. I realize there is a fine line between some porters and stouts, but this is the most stout-like porter I've had to date. Drinking this blind, I would have guessed it a stout. Big malty chocolate flavor that finishes bready with just a slight hop kick. Very well-done. Great porter."
"Taste-Not overpowering, almost light, coffee with sugar, mocha-like. Easy drinking, with hardly any bitterness in the finish. This beer could use a little more character for my taste, but overall a nice porter."
"On-tap at Sawmill Tap Room served in a standard pint glass an almost opaque black that shows slight ruby highlights. The aroma is some brown malts with a hint of cocoa. The taste was a nice subtle blend of chocolate and brown malts with a hint of hops. The beer was smooth and crisp with a slight dryness. This one was quite enjoyable on draft."
"This is a drinkable porter but thinner & less malty than I expected. I did like the smokey scent."
"The drink is medium in body with excellent carbonation. My bottle is marked 6.7% ABV, which is surprising, as any alcohol in the brew is exceptionally well-hidden. Quaffable, savory, and refreshing."
"Thanks goes out to drgonzo3705 for this extra! Pours a brown color with mahogany highlights, small light tan head, no lacing. Aroma is surprisingly hoppy with a light smattering of chocolate and caramel. Taste on this one is pretty light for what I like out of a porter. Again, the American hops are overly-present for a porter, very light chocolate, cola, toasty malts, and caramel, but the taste is very underwhelming. Light bodied, average carbonation. Not a bad beer, but not very ""robust"" as it says on the label."
"Overall, I can't say this wasn't easy to drink but I don't think I'd get it again."
"Future outlook: Solid in all areas. I enjoyed drinking this, and would be quite happy to have again. Can't believe I didn't realize this was a ""local"" brewery until tonight...."
"M/D - an ok porter in my book, the burnt taste along with the bite at the end is keeping me from wanting more."
"I know this isn't a review of the porter but the label / case pack ! I think the label just makes it even better. Still chuckling !!"
"Black colored beer with a thick brown head.Aroma is coffee and chocolate.Taste is mocha,smoked malts and some alcohol on the back end.The abv on this site says 5.7 although my bottle says 6.7.Either way this is an enjoyable beer that I would recommend and purchase again!!"
"Overall, quite a nice porter. I could have a couple of these."
"I really like this porter, its very simple and easy drinking. I just noticed that this beer clocks in at 6.7%. I would have guessed 5%, so smooth and drinkable...wow. The label on the other hand...."
"Taste: The body feels a little thin. Roasted flavor. Hints of cocoa. This is much more subtle than I was expecting it to be."
"D - That lingering toffee taste really effected the drinkability of this brew. If this beer could cut back on that and the hop rate, this beer would be all the easier to drink. The toastiness, roast, low carbonation and balanced esters made this beer a pleasure. This beer is above average by all means but does need some fine tuning to make it a solid 4."
"Pours a clear, dark, reddish brown with a dense, tan head leaving some spotty lacing. Roasted barly malt aroma. Medium body rich in sweetish, roasted malt with a vague, burned edge. Very drinkable with a smooth and soft mouthfeel - a bit low in carbonation,and just a hint of bitterness,very good porter."
"The body is moderate but still sweet. It doesn't have the unattenuated feel, but the taste is just sweet. Overall would like more bite and roast but easy enough to drink."
"12 oz. bottle. A solid brown pour, but light gets through fairly easily. Small cream colored head. Sticks the the glass fairly well. Roast malt, peaty earth aroma. Taste is roast malt and mocha, just a hint of coffee. Medium body that borders on creamy. Finish is earthy, clean. Not a bad porter, that smoothes into the flavors nicely as it warms a little."
"Enjoyable, but a little strange for it's style. Tasted like a nut brown/porter combo..."
"in terms of drinkability, i usually end up finishing this beer within 5-10 minutes because it just goes down so easy. it's delicious, and i wish the alcohol content was slightly lower because this would be my session beer of choice. i highly recommend this porter!"
"An easy drink, one I'd like to have around when my mind can't decide on anything else."
"D - Great. A sessionable porter - the mild flavor makes it a real bottle-downer. Worth having. Worth searching for."
"D: drinkable but reminded me more of a average non-descript dark ale, alcohol was there but body and substance were incredibly lacking"
"Although the ABV is a little strong to qualify, this would be a great session beer. Tons of character, but nothing overwhelming, an excellent brew."
"This 'robust porter' was a nearly opaque wood-stain brown out of the bottle. The head was tan, very short lived and it laced only decently. The aroma was mostly roasted malt, caramel malt and chocolate malt with some undertones of earthiness. The flavors were rich and chewy, starting with the aforementioned sweet malts then fading into elements of nuts, roasted malt and coffee. The finish has hints of hops and a general bitterness. Though the flavors were good I found the body light for the style. The carbonation was soft and solid however and the mouthfeel smooth albeit slick."
"Overall a decent porter; not the best I've had, but certainly an enjoyable beer. Give it a try."
"Came in a darkish brown, almost black and viscous body with minimal head and no laces (could've been the pour). Had a semi-sweet smeel while balanced with some earthy hops. Real smooth and creamy, carbonation is light so it passes fluffy. Taste of varied malts, caramel and butterscotch for smoothness and some roasted malts to give it a slightly dry edge as it passes. Not for those who prefer overbearing porters, but if you just want a simple yet tasty porter to enjoy then you can't go wrong here."
"Drinkability- Goes down easy enough, but leaves a lot to be desired. Oh, and where are the hops?"
"D - It threw me off with the strong alcohol taste but towards the end I got over it...all in all pretty good"
"Pours a dark brown with ruby hues when held to light. Decent head that leaves good lacing behind. Smells of chocolate, very malty, lactose, a lot like a milk stout. Tastes of roasted malts, some bitter chocolate and coffee notes...Pretty drinkable and a fine example of an American Porter."
"Overall this is a very sessionable porter, like if you crossed a stout with an irish red. Definately worthy."
"Not a bad porter - not the best I've ever had - but a great session one."
"D: I've got another bottle that I'll enjoy. The flavor profile deviates from that of a normal American porter."
"D_Not quite so sure about this one, I prefer my porters a bit dryer."
"D- Very nice porter, maybe a touch sweet, but I would love again."
"Served in a nonic. Poured the color of cola with ruby red highlights around the edges. Half inch off-white head reduced it's volume by half within less than a minute before settling into a thin broken skim; no lacing on this one. Nose is predominantly chocolate malt; intense off the cap, but much more diffuse in the glass. Taste consistent with nose with just the slightest hops bittering at the finish. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied with a mild carbonation throughout the mouth. Good drinkability; alcohol is well hidden and flavors are pronounced and well balanced."
"Dark chestnut in color with a good sized tan head that left some decent lacing. Smells of chocolate, roasted malts and slight citrus/grassy hops. The taste is chocolate, moca and a raw nut flavor with a nice botterness throughout. It has a nice creamy mouth feel and slides down nicely. This is a very good porter that I always try to keep around the house."
"This is a great all around porter, in fact it is one of my favorites. The color is a deep dark brown. An aroma of rich roasted malts permeates the air just above the rim of the glass. Wonderful complex malty flavor accented with just the right amount of hops. The flavor is fantastic. Porters and stouts are my favorite styles, and this is one of my most enjoyable beers. Like most of the previous reviews on this beer I too wish that there was a better head on this beer, but overall a small price to pay for such a wonderful flavor."
"D - easy to drink, tasty brew."
""
"D: Pretty good tasting and easy drinking."
"I'm not sure if this is, in fact, just another porter. I've had so many and each excels in it own way. This very well could be a repeat buy for me."
"Taste is balanced and bittersweet. Earthy tobacco leaf in the finish, malty caramel notes and dark chocolate in the beginning, with a smooth feel overall. Mild roastiness that isn't overpowering. Damn this is good. Should have grabbed a six-pack, I know I will next time."
"Could throw a few back."
"D: Low ABV, similar to other porters, not overly sweet lends me to believe that multiple beers can be consumed in a sitting."
"Smooth roasted malts malts up front. Coffee bitterness. Doughy caramel and cola-ish malty sweetness. Vanilla, licorice, and some cocoa as well. Finish is drier, with moderate coffee and dark chocolate bitterness and milk chocolate sweetness. Pretty good! Medium-bodied with a slightly cream feel. Goes down nice and easy."
"Drinkability is good since it is not very intense and I could see it tasting better on tap."
"Drinkability- A definate afternoon sipper, a good grilling companion."
"Pours a deep, dark brown with ruby and copper highlights. A medium tan head rises up and hangs around for a while. Smell is somewhat light. Caramel, toffee, touch of chocolate, light buttered bread. Taste is good and interesting. A sweet malt assortment up front and the slightest splash of green citrus hops to finish. Didn't notice it at first but they became present at times. Mouthfeel is a tad lighter than I'd prefer but holds up well. Overall a pretty good drinker. Two or three would not be out of the question."
"drinkability is great. a tasty and well balanced porter. i enjoyed this one from the bottle before i really got into reviewing, and it was nice to revisit it. i'll definitely need to pick up some more of this one."
"Drinkability- A very drinkable beer."
"D- Not easily drinkable. This is a beer you relax with and watch a ballgame to."
"Pretty good way to start the day of festivities."
"Pours pretty dark black with a nice big tan head. Very lightly ruby tones around the edges. Smell is nice dark roasted malt and is very aromatic and satisfying. Nice slightly creamy body. Good Roasty character with a hint of char, but very light, almost nonexistant bitterness. Moderate to high sweetness level and creamy milkly flavors along as well. Would like a hint more balancing bitterness to match the sweetness, but still very enjoyable. Thanks Mike!"
"Tasted on 3/6/08."
"Awesome label but only a slightly above average beer."
"154 reviews as of this posting. amazing how a bere can be so reviewed and regional. I seem to be in this mode today - I'll skip the usual review and note that I liked this overall, a bit light in the mouthfeel but that's just my .02. Worth a try if you're looking for a nice porter."
"In regards to the lable, like they say, ""every dog has his day."""
"This is a very good beer, at least fresh it is. Don't know how long this one can sit, as I am not sure what tends to happen to coffee and chocolate notes as beers age, but if you can get a fresh bottle I highly recommend it."
"Pours very dark with very little head. Smells a bit smokey, hints of caramel and grain. Tastes faintly of the chocolate hops described on the label, the chocolate is not overdone. Heavy in the mouth, but easy on the throat. I haven't tried this on tap yet, but it is available in my area. I have the feeling I will end up very drunk the night I decide to do so, as it is very drinkable; and because of this I am hesitant to try it on tap."
"Overall, an extremely well done beer. While the mouthfeel and appearance aren't top of the line, the aroma and taste of this brew are absolutely wonderful."
"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date - 24 IBUs. Fairly black body, with medium carbonation and topped with a finger of brownish head that manages to leave some light lacing, despite reducing to almost nothing. Chocolate, coffee and dark fruits are the predominant aromas, but are backed with a dash of hops and perhaps some anise. Tastes of coffee and chocolate with maybe some lactic notes, and green/spicy hops that impart a medium bitterness. It has a medium body with annoyingly high carbonation and imparts a decent finish. Not that bad of a porter - could be more robust though. And the carbonation was distracting, taking way too long to work itself down to a drinkable level."
"Overall: Nice porter. Fairly inexpensive way to get your beer rocks off."
"D: A slightly above average porter, and not as ""robust"" as I thought it should be. Easily drinkable and tasty, but lacking depth. Glad to try it."
"D- Probably one of the best standard porters I have had. Just a really solid beer."
"Pours one step below pitch black. Has a dark tan head that does not stick around. Nose is a bit deep. Has an almost molasses tone to it, but slightly so. Beyond that, there isnÂ’t much going on besides malts. Flavor is pretty earthy, rustic, and robust. There is definite wood there, and more than a small portion of molasses. Feel is good on the body and the carbonation is at a good level. A good porter. Not one that will blow all the others away, but one that is crafted well. Worth trying for itÂ’s slightly deep consistency."
"Sorry I only bought one of these because I am definitely ready for another. Great drinkability. I recommended this one."
"Frankly, this is one of the better porters I've had in awhile. Being up here in hop country, it's nice to taste brews from a different region of the country! Nice porter."
"Overall- A nice smooth easy drinking Porter. A bit light on the flavors but easy to drink. A good session porter."
"This beer poured a dark brown hue, with a small light-brown head. The smell had aromas of sweet, roasted malt and a light hop aroma. The taste was balanced, and had a slight sweetness and plenty of roasted flavor to the body. There were some chocolate malt flavors in there as well, but a strong roasted presence prevailed. The mouthfeel was medium/thick with a low carbonation. For it's ABV, it actually masks it well. This was a fairly drinkable porter, but nothing extraordinary in my mind. I would recommend trying it."
"Pours a dark brown with some dark red hints around the edges, and a nice thin coffee colored head. Smell is rich with chocolate, and sweet roasted malts. The taste is quite good with allot of chocolate and coffee, a bunch of roasted malts, light hops come through to balance things out a bit. This is one of the best porters i have had in recent memory. Flavorful, and a drinkable 6%"
"After much confusion about the Thirsty Dog Brewing Company being closed I finally found this beer. It pours an inky black with a beautiful brown head that seems have different shades as I pour. The aroma is rich sweet roasted caramel, tons of delicious malt aroma. The flavor is sweet and delicious, like desert in a bottle. Rich chocolate, toffee, toffee and plenty of sweet maltiness make this one a real treat. Behind all the sweetness, there is some hop bitterness in the finish, but not very much. This is what I'm looking for from an Stout or Porter. It has all the flavor, depth and richness of an Imperial with out being overpowering and remains drinkable at under 6%."
"Thirsty Dog's Old Leghumper is a really nice robust porter with exceptional drinkability. It pours dark brown with reddish brown hues when held to the light. The head disappeared so quickly that I couldn't even tell you what color it was. It smells malty sweet with dark chocolate and caramel aromas. I found this porter to be medium bodied with moderately low carbonation that combined to impart a smooth creaminess to the mouthfeel. Sweat roasted malt flavors blend beautifully with hints of caramel and a touch of alcohol and then finishes with a mild burnt dryness that is clean and well balanced. Overall, Old Leghumper is an excellent porter that I will just have to find on tap."
"Dark, with minimal ruby highlights and quick to reduce top. Robust nose of dark chocolate milk, and tastes similar. Creamy & full-bodied, but well carbonated. This reminds me of a cola milkshake. Very easy to drink. Well-balanced, well-crafted and good enough to find itself regular shelf space in my fridge."
"Got in a trade with johnnnniee - many thanks! Poured from a 12oz bottle with no dating info into a pint glass. It was pitch black with deep mahogany highlights around the edges a light. It had a good sized tan head that very quickly dissipated into nothing. No lacing but good carb in center. The aroma was very subdued - really had to sniff to get it. What was there was roasted and chocolate malts, some caramel. The taste was very good. I'm really into porters right now and this one won't blow you away but you find yourself taking drink after drink. Overall, it's a good but not great porter. Recommend. Need to try this one again. (4, OR, T, Y)"
"Pours 100 percent black with a fine-bubbled tan head that leaves some lacing and remains as a collar on top of the liquid. The aroma is very rich, a mix of sweet smells and roasted ones, with an overbearing creaminess that's kind of Coffeemate. On the palate the flavors are smooth but very robust -- this is an Americanized porter, with lots of roasted malt goodness, substantial bitterness from hops and malt, and big, heavy mouthfeel. This is a good American porter, but its heaviness is a bit much for my taste, and the hugeness of the flavors detract from a style that ought to be pretty easy and drinkable."
"It's now warmed up some and nothing's really changed. I'd have to say that this is a pretty good sample of the style, not overly complex yet a solid interpretation and I'd gladly drink it again if I was offered one."
"D: A good beer, but like the rest of TD's beers, I remember liking this one a whole lot better a few years ago. The quality of their brews seems to be waning."
"The taste is lovely, a generous cocoa chocolate presence, roasted almost, little to no hop presence, perhaps as really short in the middle, hard to put a handle on. The finish seems to take a long stroll out of sight, there but not too obvious, a tad dry with coffee. The body is pretty full, a even keeled carbonation plays with the smooth body, overall a very quality beer, nicely done."
"Fairly dry tasting, but there is a solid fruit character here of slightly burnt figs and roasted raisins. There is a certain tartness here from the roasted grain character, which also accentuates the fruit notes. The beer is a touch thin as it could use a touch more malty richness. The beer finishes with only a hint of hop bitterness, but it does have a solid, burnt grain bitterness / astringency that provides a structure and balance for the malt and fruit notes. The fruit and light acidity almost give this beer a vinous quality. This is an enjoyable brew, though I expected it to be a bit more rich than it was."
"Aftertaste becomes surprisingly creamy after a thin porter swallow...creamed unsweetened cocoa."
"This beer poured an oily black with a thick rocky tan head. The aroma is malty and subdued. The taste is mostly malty with roasted and chocolate flavors noticeable. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy. This is a delicious brew that while may be a bit heavy for most Â– I find quite drinkable."
"Bills itself as a robust porter. I would call it a darn good porter instead. Pours a dark, dark brown with a nice half-inch head. Smell is molasses and malt..slight metallic note. Taste is very good, mainly roasted malt and coffee in character. Mouthfeel is actually lighter than I expected, but with a refreshing crispness. Because of the previous quality, drinkability is very good."
"A chocolate porter by taste and a session beer by feel. It's not the richest porter or the most complex, but there's a wonderful chocolate malt flavor with a nice balancing hops bitterness (a touch of hops flavor). Something different, generally speaking, for a porter, worth trying."
"I'd say the smell is the best part here, which probably accounts for why I enjoyed the taste given this beers near absence on my palate. I think Thirsty Dog is a pretty cool little gem of a brewery though, they make solid enough products and it's good they've managed to stay afloat thus far."
"D - A nicely balanced porter that has that roasted flavor I love"
"This is a decent porter that is just a bit too sweet for me to like it more than I do."
"Pours a nice clean dark brown color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy tannish head, some lacing afterwards. The nose is malty, with lots of toffee and caramel. The taste is malty, nice touch of toffee/caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty porter, glad to have had a chance to try it out, highly recommended."
"This is one mild and easy to drink beer. Mild tasting with no trace at all of any rough edges, this is beer you should try to obtain."
"What I expected to be an average run-of-the-mill porter, pleasantly suprised me by delivering well in all areas. This deep brown/amber American Porter by Thirsty Dog pours to a rich darkness and milky pearl head that lasted a bit shorter than desired. A light sweet aroma bares hints of roasty carmel. The initial tastes includes moderate chocolate and carmel tones that give way to a toasty coffee-like finish. The moderate mouthfeel is pleasant and appetizing with a creamy smooth finish that agrees with the palate. Because of the mellow texture and feel, the drinkability of this porter is very high and at 5.7% abv, you can sit and drink it all night. This would be a great after-dinner beer. Well recieved."
"D- pretty drinkable and decent porter. I enjoyed drinking this one but I probably will not have another for awhile."
"I've been meaning to taste this brew for some time and I'm glad I did. Poured dark brown with a hint of a caramel color shining through. Nice 2 inch tan head the cascade quickly to the top yet fully lasted through the session. The scent was a robust roasted malt, molasses and caramel upfront. Somewhere in the middle I got a hint of coffee ending with vanilla. The flavor was right on with the smell. Medium body, watery and slightly oily with a lively carbonation palate feel. Overall, I like this porter alot. I felt it was well rounded in flavor and aroma. More of this brew will come home with me. Enjoy"
"Overall: An average interpretation of the style that I will most likely not go back to. Nothing bad here, but nothing good either."
"D: Very tasty, goes down easy, not very filling, good kick, very good representation of style. For a style where you normally donâ€™t look for a pounder, this could certainly be one, while still being a good sipper as well."
"D - A great example of a Robust Porter, highly drinkable while minimally bittered. Malty and slight dryness from highly roasted malts with plenty of sweet chocolate and coffee notes in a lighter bodied ale."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black, with a half inch tan head. It smells like roasted malt, coffee and chocolate. It tastes the same way it smells, but there's some caramel and nuts in the taste and also some hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is nice, it's a bit slick, smooth and creamy. Body is medium. Drinkability is very good, it's really easy to drink and has a slight dry finish. Very sessionable IMO."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my Dogfish shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a dark translucent brown with about a finger of tan foam that quickly fades leaving no lacing to speak of on the glass. Smells of roasted malt, chocolate and coffee. Tastes initially of herbal, grassy hops, followed by bitter cocoa. Finish is quite dry and clean with a slight bitterness. Thin bodied with medium carbonation. Worth a try if you are into the style."
"Drinkability: A great porter, rich and robust with a great long lasting finish."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle, this beer is dark black with a thick coffee-colored head. It had a nice coffee aroma, as well as some roasted malts. The taste was also coffee, but moreso some sweet chocolate. I thought it to be a little too much on the sweet side, but still a good beer to drink."
"A very dark brown beer with ruby highlights. Has a big foamy brown head. The aroma starts with a strong roast coffee and dark chocolate character with a hint of piney hops in the background. A prickely carbonation precedes the smooth roasted malt notes. Which are followed by the coffee and chocolate notes promised in the aroma. Has a light dry finish but not biting."
"Drinkability: It's hard for me to drink a lot of smokey beer, but this one is a pleasure."
"D - LOVED this beer. Will definitely have more."
"A dark chocolate and coffee ice cream layer provide the backbone. A touch of dairy, but strong roasted malt flavors dominate. Minimal hop presence overall. A tad smoky with a caramel and toffee blast."
"D - Nothing really spectacular here...I sampled one from a 12 oz bottle about a year ago and enjoyed it more than from the tap. If you see it in your bar, pick one up to see for yourself...I'd suggest that, at the least."
"Pours a three finger light brown head that fades quickly to a ring leaving some lace. Almost midnight black color. Good carbonation and heavy bodied. Sweet malty nose. Sweet malty flavor, caramel, nutty, clean sweet finish. 12oz bottle, gift from Vintage Cellars."
"D - The one tastes a lot more like a Baltic porter to me then an American porter. Tasty beer that could be easily sessionable."
"Draft at KClingerÂ’s Tavern, Hanover PA. A dark black beer with but a thin white film. Mellow java and light almost jellybeany flavors. This is a bit of a junior varsity player in the serious porter market, but a well balanced exceptionally drinkable beer. (#2655, 1/14/07)"
"I wasn't able to hold the beer into the light to see if the color was a dark brown or pitch black. From what I saw when the bartender put the drink down was that it looked like they just had squeezed 100 black ink pens into a pint glass. It was that BLACK! Of course if they did squeeze 100 pens into my glass, then my beer wouldn't have had a 2 finger head of tan colored foam. I really couldn't tell what was going on in the smell. The aroma was on the light side with roasted dark malts with a hint of caramel in the background. That was nice and all, but for some reason the sweetness of the malts and the caramel mixed into what I believe was a minor sour smell. That minor sour aroma doesn't belong there. The taste was that of dark roasted malts, roasted nuts, and with a trace of sweet caramel at the end. I really couldn't taste any hops in the initial taste, but they did manage to show up in the aftertaste of the mouthfeel. Other than the hops in the mouthfeel, I thought it was a bit on the weak side. It wasn't as thick as I like my Porters to be. After all of that, I could see myself having another one of these on-tap. I would probably buy it just for the inky appearance alone."
"Aroma is quite bad. Spoiled eggs and coffee with some sweetness in the background. The taste is bland and watery with some roastiness and faint sweetness. Mouthfeel is way too thin, and I am not inclined to drink more of this."
"Tastes Dry with sweet undertones and grassy co-humulone that is underplayed by the malt. Wow, that first sip was yummy. Dry finish is mostly chocolate with roast rising just to be noticed in the aftertaste. No citrusy hop flavor, like I was expecting this american porter to have. Md heavy body and moderate carbonation."
"The smell is strong and very nice, with tons of roasted malt blended with bits of coffee and chocolate. The taste has plenty of chocolate. Hops are minimal in the finish. The mouthfeel is extremely smooth and it is very easy to drink."
"This one is not too bad. Worth the 10 bucks a sixer. But there are better porters out there. Fullers comes to mind."
"A well made porter very tasty and enjoyable.A must try porter!"
"D: The roast bitterness is a bit overwhelming for me, although appropriate for the style. Pairs well with extra sharp cheddar cheese. Overall, I think the roasty taste is out of balance with the chocolate and coffee flavors. This beer is decent, but there are other examples of the style that I prefer more. Not sure I'd buy another sixer, but I would order it if it were on tap someplace and I'd certainly recommend it to a friend."
"This is a really nice beer. Nice 3 finger head also leaves lacing down the glass. Nice chocolatey malts and some coffee. Warms ya up a bit and is a better depiction of sierra nevada's porter. Nothing offensive. Better as it warms. Provides a clean, smooth taste and is easily drinkable. I give this one a thumbs up!"
"D - Easy to drink but don't know if I would have more than two at a time. This is a beer to drink when solving the worlds problems. I wouldn't want to rush drinking this one."
"Mouthfeel is slightly thin but highlighted by some roasty, and sweet notes. Perhaps a bit too effervescent for my taste but not bad."
"Not bad, but a little too dry."
"Drinkability: Despite my disappointment with the flavor progression, this beer is very easy to drink and would complement a variety of foods"
"This beer poured a very dark brown that allowed absolutely no light to pass through the glass. Very dark. Thin head that quickly vanished and practically no lacing. The smell was enticing with the chocolate malt and the taste followed suit. However, the flavors were very short-lived and I felt like the lack of lasting power detracted from the overall taste. Mouthfeel had medium body, slightly oily, and the right amount of carbonation. To me, this was merely an average porter."
"Pours a nice deep chocolatey brown with a few red highlights. Low aroma-sort of roasted malt/espresso like though pretty faint. Nice roasted flavor with a prominant bitterness to it. A bit metallic in the backround. Good body. Overall a fairly drinkable beer. Decent effort though theres others out there I would pick up first."
" I will gladly finish the sixer at a later time."
"All threes now."
"Poured this porter, dark as night, into a snifter producing about 1/2 inch of head. Up front the smell was nutty and coffee like, as most porters from my experience, but this gave way to sweet, fruity scents. The taste was predominantly smokey, almost like slightly burnt whole grain toast, but this turned sweet and eventually clear and crisp (though the smokiness remained). By the end of the glass, these flavors seemed to be mixing just about evenly. I'm not a huge fan of the burnt quality in beer. Regardless, this is definitely an enjoyable beverage."
"Near black, some roastiness. Medium plus mouthfeel, mud in a barrel, which may be mollasses, a bit on the sweet side but tasty, nicely malted and likeable addition of chocolate. Suitably understated carbonation. Went great with pizza and mid eastern spicey food. Coffee not observed, and only faint hop."
"This was my 13th beer on my Gullifty's 130+ beer challange. Like all but one, I really enjoyed this beer. I can't lie, however, I am very attracted to advertising. I'm embarrased to say that in my conquest to better understand beer, I have gotten side tracked by the advertisements. If I try and get past this flaw of mine, I would be comfortable with recomending this beer to anyone."
"Poured into pint glass from 12oz. bottle, creating a 1inch dark tan head that subsides after the first couple drinks, leaves a little lacing. The apperance is black, with only a little brown/ruby hues on the sides when held up. The Aroma is fairly strong, mostly of mocha, some chocolate, and roasted malt. The taste is mostly of a roasted coffee flavor, very delish in a typical porter style. The roasted malts can be tasted as well, with very little carbonation to interfere with the rich flavors being taken in. Aftertaste is of an oily nutty flavor. The mouthfeel is a little less than expected, it could be creamier and more full-bodied in my opinion. Drinkability isn't too high, but then again I can't see many people taking down more than just a couple porters, they're just too rich. Or I'm just a baby."
"A tasty porter that I would for sure buy again!"
"Brown. Aroma of coffee grounds, molasses, roasted malts, earth and chocolate. A nice malty sweetness gives way to a fortitude of struggling lingering coffee flavor with other notes of chocolate, pine, brown sugar and dark fruits. A bit light in body and flavor, with a pretty bland aroma."
"Cheers!"
"Dark brown almost black in color. Some dark ruby highlights, not much of a head. Poor head retention, and no lacing. Even after taking a deep breath, not much of a smell. Mostly dark roasted malts and suttle hints of chocolate, but not much. Taste is pretty weak also, mostly sweet roasted malt and a light mocha flavor. Mouthfeel is very airy and light, with a good amount of carbonation. Low abv, light body and easy too drink. This brew needs more aromas and flavors. I doubt that I will buy this again. Lackluster."
"Just an average porter. Nothing special going on here folks. That isn't to say that it is bad, it's just pedestrian. A bit watery with a hint of dry chocolate. But that is all there is to say about this one. There are better porters out there and you should go drink those before settling for this one."
"Pours a dark deep brown with ruby ruby tint when a thin light brown head that leaves quickly,love the aromas pretty fruity with a cinnamon spice quality wich I had never encoutered in a standard porter but wich I enjoyed also picked up some bitter chocolate.What I like best about the flavors of this porter is that its not overly roasted sure there is a roasted malt profile but this brew is fruity and chocolaty over top of the roasted malt profile.A real nice porter one I would drink alot of if more available the mouthfeel is spot on for me,a nice change of pace porter with a cool labelon the bottle to boot."
"Easy to drink, but just in the middle of the pack."
"Pours a brown/red, clear, small tan head forms, some spotty lace. Smell is dates, very malty, roasty chocolate. Taste is dates as well, chocolate and coffee, roast, some vanilla in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with low carbonation. A different approach to a porter, enjoyable, thanks DrJay!"
"Bought this one for the cool new cap and of course for the name and picture. Nothing like drinking some Old Leghumper while sitting through a talk on invasive crayfish. I checked, and this was from the brewery in Frederick, MD. Not sure why there are so many different old leghumpers but whatever. Looked fine. brown with caramel head. the whole beer experience here was overwhelmed by it's huge roasted taste. problem was, the roastiness was all it had. pretty dull otherwise. a hint of chocolate, maybe. Very thin for a porter too. i expected it to much fuller. Ok drinkability but there are many many porters i'd go to first."
"Poured a very deep brown colow with tannish head, which proved to be long-lasting and left slight lacing on the side of the glass. Smell was mostly of burnt coffee, with some bitter chocolate also present. Taste was much milder than expected with the promise of the smell falling a bit short. It was good, but not as nice as I was expecting. Finish is also a bit disappointing with a watery mouhtfeel, and a little bitterness that is quickly gone. This is a very easy drinking beer, almost too easy for the style. While iI did enjoy it, it fell short of my expectations for a porter."
"Overall: Not bad but not that exciting either."
"This is a pretty damn good robust porter. Nice big chocolate character, decent hop bitterness, good hop flavor, nice and fruity, and malty sweet. I'd do a case of this if I could find it."
"Dark brown with ruby highlights. Short, light tan head that showed some lacing. Sweet, roasted malt aroma with a bit of chocolate and faint hops. Same characters in the flavour, maybe a bit burnt as well that lingers in the finish and some brown sugar. Mild bitterness. Medium body, slightly dry, moderate carbonation. A solid porter, nothing more, nothing less."
"D- This is a good solid porter. It has lots of nice depth in the malt and would make a very good session beer. I would like to see the fizz bite cut back. The hops were very hidden in this beer but they weren't really missed."
"A nice beer with a clever name. But a beer with such a name should come with some serious strength. Though this beer is well balances and clean, it doesn't pack enough strength in flavor to compete with it's strength in alcohol. Lighter in color than I like in a porter, it's almost copper with good head retention and decent lacing. Aromas are expectedly of black malt, cocoa, and coffee. Flavors bring out a moderatley malt sweetness with a touch of black malt without becoming charcoal like. The cocoa flavors take on a milk chocolate flavor, but not texture; instead of a prefered bitter-sweet cocoa. The coffee notes are soft--more of a cappucino flavor and bitter. Hopping is a bit aggressive for style, but not to bother. The texture is light for style, not quite watery, but light. The finish is a bit sweet and alcoholic. Never packs much of a punch. I wouldn't say a whimpy porter, but certainly easily drank."
"Interesting combination of flavors that evolves and moves around the mouth. I gotta say the best part might be the label. Thanks to Brent for passing this one on."
"Pours black, and when brought up to bright light, appears very cloudy with fine carbonation. One finger of brown head doesn't hold long, and leaves only slight lacing. Chocolate and burnt malt apparent in the nose, sweet molasses, and no detectable hop aroma. Sweet roasted malt and raisiny fruitiness; the chocolate and burnt malt give it a bittersweet balance, with a decent hop presence to back it up. Medium-bodied with med-high carbonation, finishes clean with minimal roastiness and residual sugar. Perhaps a bit thinner mouthfeel than optimal, but still qualifies as ""Robust""."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" light brown head above the barely translucent root beer brown brew. Head fades down to a solid layer of bubbles covering the surface, with average lacing, at best. Aroma is lightly of dark roasty malts, would be nice with more intensity. Taste is sweet dark chocolate and coffee grains, coupled with a light fruitiness, and a tinge of alcohol at the close. Mouthfeel and drinkability are nice, just was looking for more here..."
"Overall, this is a really well-done, basic porter that has a great malt constituent. It's well-rounded, nicely balanced without too much dark malt acidity, and quite easy to drink. It's light enough in character that it would make a decent session ale (although the alcohol is a little high for that at 5.7%); it passes muster for a summer brew as well as a great fall/winter quaff; it pairs well with a wide variety of foods (grilled pork chops, mussels marinara, pizza, black bean and corn soup); and it would fit in quite appropriately at quite a number of social functions (guy's poker night, backyard BBQ, simple night at the pub, holiday get-together, back-at-camp beer, etc). Well done!"
"This is a nice, balanced porter with a slightly off the beaten path quality in those fruit tones. I recommend it and will certainly drink more."
"The ""porter"" pours a dark brown to black with a week, thin, tan head. There is almost no lacing left on the glass. The nose is sweet, almost like a milk/cream stout. The beer's taste is very thin, with little hops and an overwhelming sweet, milky taste. Not much good to say about this beer. The mouthfeel is awkward, with a fizzy carbonation that leaves an oily film on my tounge. Drinkability...I won't be having another."
"OVERALL COMMENTS: A little worried about the head; could be that there was too much dishwashing detergent residue in this glass, since we just moved and who knows what happened to what in the melee. Since everything else about this beer pans out IÂ’m willing to overlook it. ThereÂ’s another bottle in my beer fridge that looks just like this one, and if that one has the same problem IÂ’ll let you know. Other than that, itÂ’s a fine brew Â– certainly worthy of its 2002 Gold at the World Beer Cup."
"I had this beer at the brewpub but I didn't take notes. I also got it in bottles here so I decided to write my review from this location. I really liked this porter. It had a strong roasted espresso note upfront but chocolate seemed to be the focal point. The chocolate flavor was quite sweet and smooth. There was a grainy bitterness in the bottle that I didn't notice while drinking it on tap. The body was on the light side but it was really a smooth beer. Another great beer from Thirsty Dog."
" Drinkability is good goes down easy and smooth not in the league with the great porters but not a bad beer."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep pitch black color with three fingers of medium tan head that retain nicely. There is a decent amount of lacing. The smell has lots and lots of burnt malt. Some chocolate undertones, and a hint of coffee, but just lots of burnt malt. The taste also has lots of that burnt malt character. Roasted coffee and cocoa powder on the finish. The mouthfeel is just a little too light and watery. The drinkability is great though. A decent porter."
"This was a very good porter that quite frankly was only purchased because of the name. Still I was quite impressed the only thing it lacked was a trace of hops."
"A tasty American porter that could use a bit more roastiness and hop bitterness. Very drinkable, but I wouldn't go out of my way in search of this one."
"Pours a dark color with a small head that doesn't stick around long, but leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is mostly coffee and chocolate malts. The flavor is much the same. kmpitz2 and I decided it's more of a mixture that resembles mocha. Very enjoyable. Makes for a good porter. Could use a slight bit more body, but it's pretty nice. Easy to drink."
"Beer pours a nice dark brown to black color with a small head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is a lot of coffee with chocolate in the background. The flavor is a nice mocha from start to finish. The feel is moderate. I want a bit more in there as its not enough for me. Drinkability is good on this one as well. I like it for a porter."
"Super dark brown with a thin tannish cap, some collaring persists, lacing minimal. Aroma is of a swell dark milk chocolate roastyness with a bit of burnt cookie, molasses, and coffee over the top. Good nose for a porter, clean, peppy, and unwavering. Taste closes in at the front with a clean roast and milk chocolate, some gaining bitterness of burnt coffee, hops, and chocolate squeeze in just past midway and dusts off in the finish with leftover molasses chewyness and cocoa. Quite the enjoyable taster. Feel is about medium, clean, robust, slightly burnt and drying, nice chocolate return across the entire palate the whole ride through. This is a fine porter, one to have again and again. Enjoyably robust, chocolatey, clean, milding, and soothing."
"After having this a few times I think I have made up my mind. It is by no means the best out there but I think this porter is very good. Poured a nice dark beer with a head that was made to last. The nose brings out malty roasted barely and some caramel sweetenss. At first I thought it might be overhopped but have since figured that it is decently balanced and the extra hops aren't really bitter they are just noble so I am thinking fuggles or somesuch. I wasn't too thick and you could drink this porter all night with out too much stopping for burps. Enjoyed it and at a decent price I drink it again."
"DonÂ’t pass this one up because of the gimmick label. Actually a very good porter."
"The beer after its departing the 12-ounce brown bottle sets in my glass a deep brown to black with some ruby high lights, the head is portly in size and frothy in texture, the color a toothsome light tan and the left over lace a thin but concealing sheet upon the glass. Nose is roasted grain, sweet and pleasing to the olfactory senses, start is sweet and rich, the top medium to almost full in feel. Finish has a pleasant acidity, the hops modest and unassuming in their spicy bite, very dry aftertaste that lingers long on the tongue, like the beer, love the name."
"This is a very good looking offering that tastes as good as it looks, and it looks pretty good. The smokey aroma gives away the flavor which is indeed full of smokey, roasted goodness. Flavors are complex and combine coffee, chocolate and roasted malt/grain flavors. There is a surprising lightness in the body which tends to a bit of wateriness. The color is a bit lighter than many porters as well. Small head, but decent lacing, tan foam coloring. The name alone demands that you try this beer."
"I would definately have another."
"Strange, even though it is creamy and medium bodied, it seems to leave the mouth quickly. Easy drinking and wouldnÂ’t mind having again.."
"Drinkability and overall: Easy going down but not very inspiring. A pretty average porter that got worse as it went. With all the good porters around here (especially Great Lakes) I see no reason to go back to this brew. I'll stick to their Russian Imperial Stout and go from there."
"Slick feel as I took the first sip which brought good malt, chocolate, and coffee flavors. A slight tinge of bitterness from small amounts of hop followed up to make this one of my top porters."
"Big thanks to sidabeef7 for the bottles!"
"Wow. This was one of the best porters, right up there with my favorite. Of course, I'm comparing to Cumberland's Nitro Porter, so I prefer a creamier porter, but I know that is not true to porter style. This is about as accurate as it gets. It was dark, smelled robust, had faint coffee and chocolate flavors and finished above average. This is my third favorite beer brewed by Thirsty Dog and the best of the Ohio micros that I've tried."
"props to thirsty dog for the funny label and name"
"Deeo dark brown with a small tan head that dies quickly. Superb aroma of roasted malts, chocolate, slightly herbal hops, and slight booze. A very balanced taste that starts off with slight hops and roasted malts. This is quickly followed up by some nice milk chocolate and weak coffee notes. The finish is dry, and to the point. The mouthfeel is creamy, but a tad thin and the drinkability is good. Nice stuff..."
"Pours a deep brown with no highlights. Small, tan head that stayed for a while. Smell is a nice roasted almost coffee-like note. Deep rich and robust here. You get some dark malt, combined with a nice roasty taste, with little hop flavor or bitterness. Slight coffe taste in the finish. Medium body with low carbonation. This is one of the best that T.D has to offer. Nice example of a robust porter."
"Thx to Craig for this one."
"This is pretty dark, especially for a porter, as it looks black from a distance. There wasnÂ’t a lot of light coming through even up close. ThereÂ’s a weak roasty aroma. The flavor is roasty and not bad. ItÂ’s a little sticky which makes for a nice mouthfeel."
"Overall, an enjoyable, good porter."
"Thanks to my buddy Chilidog for the sample."
"	A rich roasted malt aroma takes center stage. It also has a strong alcohol aroma to its bouquet. The taste begins sweet with a burnt coffee taste. ItÂ’s odd; I canÂ’t really detect the alcohol in the taste. Ends with a roasted bitterness. Medium bodied mouthfeel that seems to fit the style to a tee. It leaves the mouth slightly coated. Overall a very good and drinkable porter. I will definitely be having this one again."
"Old Leghumper is good beer, all things considered. It has the flavor profile that I like (more chocolate than coffee, light on the hops) and has a reasonably full body. This is my first Thirsty Dog brew, but I look forward to trying more of their offerings. Love the label; the dog tags on the women's ankles are a nice touch. ""So many legs... so little time!"""
"This was definitely one of the ones I was looking forward to, and I wasn't disappointed. A sweet and fairly robust porter, and certainly amongst Thirsty Dog's best...one that I'd be glad to find bottles of!"
"Drinkability - a wonderful robust porter, I could salt away 3 or 4 of these, but will instead spread them out over several evenings to prolong the goodness."
"No best by date on the label, but let me say the label is classic shows a black dog chilling among a group of shapely legs and states..""So many legs... So little time!"". That's good stuff the appearance is dark black with ruby highlights peeking through around the edges with a large massive tan head leaves specks of sporadic lacing. Aroma: Chocolate and coffe tones with the dark roasted malts just doing there thing along with a mild hop tone thrown in. Taste: Is a robust creamy barrage of milk chocolate and mild coffee excellent fullness to the flavor with a tad of finishing hops here great porter. Mouthfeel: Full bodied texture very nice and slightly chewy to me even carbonation good stuff. Drinkability: A classic session porter very similar to Crooked River's Robust porter which I really miss seeing around the Morgantown area."
"To begin with, the name alone earns this beer some positive points. Fortunately, the beer itself is not a let down either. I've had this beer both at the brewery itself as well as in bottles once they became available. The aroma has definite hints of coffee and a maltiness. The taste is at first a settle chocolate flavor followed by an aftertaste of coffee. You can taste the maltiness from beginning to end. I think this is a good beer to start out the night with because it is a little heavier being a porter. This beer also scores points for its great taste even from a bottle as opposed to a draught from the actual brewery. Great label too! ""So many legs, so little time!"" Indeed!"
"This beer poured extremely dark ruby red, almost black color that formed a medium tan foamy head that receded quickly and left trace lace. It had an aroma of malt, chocolate and a touch of coffee. The flavor was of malt, coffee and a touch of chocolate. A bit of a bitter finish with a somewhat light body for this style. Not a bad porter."
"A dark brown with tints of red. Very little head and almost no lacing. The smell was of bittersweet chocolate and almost a raisin aroma. Tastes even more like raisins and chocolate but is entirely too sweet in my mind. The aftertaste is again a lingering sweetness that I wasn't looking for. This wasn't a bad beer but it wasn't that great either. It seemed to be missing the full body that I associate with porters."
"Very dark porter with a thin but dark tan head. Try looking through one during the next solar eclipse. There is a slight hint of maple (someone at Thirsty Dog must be a fan of Sammy's Triple Bock). Good mouthfeel and flavor. I definitely enjoyed it but could not spend the night drinking these. Don't serve it too cold, it really became much more flavorful as it warmed up."
"A very good, smooth drinkable porter. It doesn't have that burnt bakers chocolate bite but was it does have makes it smooth and appealing. It pours black with a contained cascading head. Lace is not much at best. The aroma of roasted coffee. the taste also coffee like with chocolate, malt and slight hop. A smooth hop oil mouthfeel is left making this porter almost cream like. I like cream in my coffee, so this is a porter i'll go with time in time again."
"After some recent disappointments in the porter/stout neighbourhood, this I heartily recommend."
"This brew pours a small head of dark brown colored bubbles and an opaque black brown colored body. It had a mild malt aroma. It was very smooth and had a mild coffee flavor. I enjoyed drinking this one as it was a very well balanced and a very smooth brew."
"Justin"
"Deep ruby red/brown color. Excellent coffee, malt, and chocolate flavor comes through. Body is a little lighter than expected but outstanding otherwise. This is the beer to get when you visit this Brewpub."
"How can you not order this beer when the advertising poster shows a black lab in a roomfull of nicely legged ladies, only shown from the waist down, and the caption ""So many legs, so little time.""  Presented as a robust porter, but it was pretty restrained, more like an English porter.  Deeply roasted malts with nice flavor, but lacked enough ""uumph"" from the hops to be robust.  So little time."
