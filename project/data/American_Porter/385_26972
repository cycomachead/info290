This a seamlessly integrated beer. Each component playing beautifully off of the next. Great beer.","Georgiabeer","Beers"

4.1,0.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, 2013 bottling. Pours pitch black color with a a 2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big pumpkin, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, herbal, toast, light coffee, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with very well balanced pumpkin, spice, cocoa, and roasted malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big pumpkin, milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, toast, light coffee, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Light roast/spice bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pumpkin, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, light coffee, herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity, balance, and robustness of pumpkin, spice, cocoa, and roasted malt flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent pumpkin porter. All around great balance, robustness, and complexity of pumpkin, spice, cocoa, and roasted malt flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 04, 2013"

Taste is not far behind - I do pick up pumpkin, chocolate, and spices, and the right level of sweetness, though not necessarily the clove as claimed. Mouth feel is thick and syrupy. Carbonation level is perfect - a nice not too subtle balance for the thick body. Very interesting to compare this to a beer like Dark 'O the Moon.

The taste is certainly more cocoa forward and sweet with little distinct pumpkin and mingling spices. Although the spice profile is...less than embalmed...there is still an interesting collage of spice, pumpkin, and chocolate that's really not present in any other beers. Wow, what is the potent raisin taste after it warms up?? I think it's a far cry from pumpkinator in its correct state, but is still supremely drinkable and tasty, even in the warm summer heat. It's a relatively full-bodied porter with a velvety mouthfeel reminiscent of Founder's porter. I'd love to try this beer when it's in season and hopefully witness the spices pop out against the rich chocolatey base, but think its still worth a try regardless.","ThePorterSorter","Jun 01, 2013"

There’s a ton of pumpkin pie flavor with extra spice, just right for a pumpkin beer. However, the aroma also has a big cola note that is almost sickly sweet, kinda surprising for Midnight Sun since their beers seem to run drier than nearly any other brewery. There’s some chocolate and caramel lurking in the mix, as well. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. Appearance could also be improved - the head dissipates quite quickly, leaving just a very dark brown to black body. This is a very well done pumpkin beer, but it has a few problems.","popery","Feb 24, 2013"

This was my introduction to midnight sun and I don't think I could have had a better one. If you see it for less than $20 it's worth it, but know that, if you can find, you can find it for probably $15 or less. This beer rounds out my top 20 and is damn near an A+. Now my reviews says 4.88, which, when multiplied by 20 makes it a 97. I gave it a 96, but with inflation on BA, 4.88 is probably equivalent to giving a beer a 140. I would not give it that. Ever.

The pumpkin is not "in your face", but as this beer breathes a bit, I definitely get some nice canned pumpkin aromas. Very nice-smelling beer. Taste is just as good as it smells.

Pumpkin is well done here with the full flavor of the meat developing alongside the spice component. A nice amount of cinnamon, nutmeg and clove. Alcohol shows a little in the finish but is otherwise well hidden. Finish itself is quite dry and clean with a wash of burnt sugary sweetness and then earth and pumpkin. Lingering mocha. Feel is lightly syruped and a touch slick. Gentle carbonation gives a mild velvetiness. Drinkability is quite good but this is not a session ale by any definition.

The flavor is complex with the pumpkin and chocolate as the main tastes, but with coffee, light roasted malt, also present. I did not taste much of the spices listed in the description. But this still was an amazing beer. Medium to heavy bodied. But it did get a little sweet towards the end, Especially after drinking the whole 22 oz. bottle. I planned on sharing with 2 of my friends, but after drinking a Weyerbacher Pumpkin Ale, Lagunitas 'Sucks" and a Goose Island Christmas ale on thanksgiving, I couldn't stop myself.

It looks like a porter while I was expecting something in the realm of auburn. In the nose you get plenty of pumpkin, cocoa, cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin pie with whipped topping, with a light coffee like bitterness. The flavors are very nice and authentic. You get a lot of chocolate, nutmeg, and cinnamon but the pumpkin is very authentic. It really does taste like pumpkin pulp. The longer it sits in my glass it smells like chocolate ginger snap cookies. Because this one has a base of what seems to be a porter it does drink a little thinner than expected yet leaves behind plenty of real pumpkin behind in the aftertaste.

Spice dominating the aroma, but it's nice and sweet smelling. Whereas the chocolate and roast are lost in the nose it's made up for in the flavor.

The taste follows the same lines, though the chocolate is richer and smoother, the pumpkin seeds are diminished, and the spices blend nicely into their surroundings. Good times.

This is kind of a letdown compared to the rest of the beer, as I would have liked a strong aftertaste to let the beer linger after every sip, but everything else is too good to let that bother me too much. The fact that it finishes so clean, and hides the 7.8% abv so well, speaks volumes about the drinkability as well. Pumpkin beers perhaps should not be measured by this one due to its mesh of styles, but this definitely has set the bar for spiced beers in my mind. This probably faded a bit since the initial release, but I can see the flavors melding a bit better now than if it was fresh. Nonetheless, it's going to be a long wait to try this fresh this year.

Mouthfeel is thick and coating, alcohol isn't really noticable, carbonation is almost too high. As it warms I detect the cinnamon more, and more bitter chocolate.

There's also a bit of an earthy quality, with the cocoa really asserting itself. The flavors start out well-rounded up front with the spices coalescing nicely. A hint of char comes out towards the back. Mouthfeel is is medium-light, with an easy carbonation. This is perhaps one of the best, if not the best, pumpkin beers I've had to date.

Mouthfeel is full and creamy, nice soft carbonation works well and gives the full feel, though the body is not too heavy.

4.32,5.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Thanks to AlaskaJoe for hooking this one up! With a name like Imperial Chocolate Pumpkin Porter, this beer could be either really good or really bad. Luckily I was pretty damn good. Poured a nice dark dark brown that let little light through with a tan head that dissipated slowly. The smell was awesome! Almost better than the taste. A nice blend of chocolate and pumpkin that made me drool a little each time I took a whiff. The taste was just as solid. You could make out the chocolate and the pumpkin individually but they played well together. I was surprised by this beer, I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. It was a very smooth porter, much more complex then I had anticipated and the best of the pumpkin beers I've had if you throw it in that category. Would love to try this again and it's oak aged brother.","PretzelCity","Nov 22, 2008"
3.93,-3.7,4.5,4,3.5,5,4,"Dark brown. Small, quickly diminishing light tan head that lasts decently. Nice nose. Flavor has some richness and depth to it uncommon in a pumpkin porter. Very smooth, with an elegant mouth feel. Still doesn't quite have the loads of extracted flavors I prefer, but still has some nice chocolate and pumpkin notes. Nice pumpkin ale overall.","Crosling","Nov 17, 2008"
4.28,4.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"It's probably not a fair comparison but this is, without a doubt, the best pumpkin-infused beer I've ever had. Very drinkable with a completely non-existent alcohol presence. Big thanks again to Joe for this rarity.","gford217","Nov 16, 2008"

4.47,9.6,4.5,5,4.5,4,4,"This beer is definitely not retired and is released in October of every year in Alaska, arrived the day after Halloween or it would have been drank that night, this beer was one of the more complex things I have ever drank, I have to try the oak aged version now to see if this could get any more interesting but I struggle to see how that is possible, cannot wait to drink this again in the future, recommended","Floydster","Jul 27, 2008"

4.4,7.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"first of all. THIS BEER IS NOT RETIRED!!! It is a seasonal release and is one of midnight suns best sellers. They have no intention of retiring it. And the alcohol should be listed at 7.8% However youd be lucky to find a bottle in the stores and wont at the brewery until next season. This beer pours a dark black with the teeny tiniest red hue. The head is a dark tannish brown, but fades rather quickly. The nose is very porter with obvious pumpkin spice and faint chocolate and coffee. the taste flips flops harder than Al Gore. The taste is of chocolate and coffee mix and the pumpkin takes a back seat, or maybe just sits bitch in the front. The middle of the taste is where the pumpkin starts to show up and fades with the malt and hops in the finish. Taste lingers and chocolate flavor hangs on the lips. Mouthfeel is excellent, smooth and creamy, but not as soupy as an imperial stout. The carbonation is suprisingly good, but not abrasive at all. Perfect carbonation in my opinion. I would kill somebody, maybe even a member of my family to get some of the oak aged version of this from an older vintage. Incredibly drinkable, and lingering flavor. Another fine offering from m sun. Those boys sure know how to brew em.","AKBelgianBeast","Dec 14, 2007"
4.57,12,4,4.5,5,4.5,4,"Liquid Pumpkin pie, no bull. this brew pours black with a dark, dark tan head that retains well and leaves a nice lace. the smell is pumpkin pie, the taste is also pumpkin pie with some cream taste to it at least i taste it. the mouth-feel is perfect not too thick, but thick, not flat, but not overcarbonated either, a good porter mouth-feel. and given the viscosity, take your time with it, savor it.","irishevans","Nov 08, 2007"
2.97,-27.2,4.5,2.5,2.5,3,4,"Overall: I'm very torn by this beer. I like it, it's quite drinkable, and I'd drink it again. However, I absolutely wouldn't pay $8 for a bomber again (maybe $5.) It's a solid robust porter, a semi-decent imperial porter, but almost zero as a pumpkin porter, or a chocolate porter. I don't know: I guess I feel like if you're going to turn out a unique, out in left field beer like this, it should be a little more, well, unique.","warmstorage","Jan 12, 2007"

4.18,2.5,4,3.5,4.5,5,4,"Mouthfeel is medium-thick but amazingly silky. Helps the chocolate flavor hang around and sweetens it up a bit. Wonderful and adds a great deal to the beer. Carbonation is moderate.","mentor","0"
4.53,11,4.5,4,5,4,4.5,"Mouthfeel is somewhat thin and I feel there is a tad too much carbonation. But on the other hand it fits this beer well. I could drink this one all day.","mcallister","Oct 14, 2006"
