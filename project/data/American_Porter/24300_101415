3.93,-5.1,3.75,3.75,4,4,4,"22oz. bottle served in a tulip.  Pours one shade darker than cola with a loose, 1/8th inch mocha-colored head that quickly disperses towards the shoulders.  Only spots of lacing are present during the tasting.  Nose is roasty and chocolatey with a suggestion of lactose and cherry sucrets and a faint metallic quality.  Taste follows nose - fortunately, the cherry notes are less medicinal and the metallic character present in the nose is no longer present.   There's also a nice cocoa quality to the flavor profile.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a mild carbonation, a light acidity and a slightly oily texture.  Overall, a decent imperial porter, but not worth the price point.  Not something I would recommend for extended cellaring.","Jwale73","Jan 03, 2015"

Nose of fresh black coffee, rich dark tart pie cherries, chocolate, and dark roasted malts.  Flavors follow the nose with chocolate and coffee on all sides, some crème brulee qualities on the back blending with tart cherries.  Smooth, slick, and creamy with mild carbonation that has a light souring on the aftertaste.  I loved the doughnut which was a milestone for me personally, this one is solid, yet it is hard to beat the doughnut break.","Brutaltruth","Jan 03, 2015"

Coffee, chocolate, dark cherries, caramel, roasted malts, and cookies. Sweet and boozey. The taste is chocolate and coffee at first followed by dark cherries and some sweet cookies. Cocoa powder, roasted malts, and a touch of nuts. Very sweet, as expected. Finishes with the coffee and cherry flavor with some nutty cookies. Fairly big alcohol presence. Very little carbonation. I liked Imperial Biscotti Break alot and Doughnut Break not as much. This one lies somewhere in between the two. Overall, sweet and boozey Imperial Porter who's price tag may stop me from buying it again.","PicoPapa","Nov 10, 2014"

My overall take here is of dry Scandanavian licorice complemented by cherries- which my wife thinks is a bit like cough syrup, but I like. Don't get her wrong, she doesn't mean overly sweet and medicinal, just that the licorice and cherry combo reminds her of those flavors. Not me, and everything mellows and harmonizes a bit as the beer opens up as it breathes. It ends up becoming downright silky, with a persistent fruity cherry background and roasty licorice and malt notes throughout. Quite pleasant.","Georgiabeer","Jun 28, 2014"

Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, tart cherry, toast, dark bread, fudge, vanilla, light nuttiness, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and light-moderate tart cherry notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, fudge, toast, dark bread, vanilla, light nuttiness, light tart cherry, and roasted earthiness. Light cherry tartness/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, fudge, toast, dark bread, vanilla, light nuttiness, light tart cherry, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and light-moderate tart cherry flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial coffee porter! All around great complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and light-moderate cherry flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 15, 2014"

I'm getting some coconut now that its warmed up, more alcohol, tiny bit of tartness, some dark fruit, hint of smoke. Pretty ashy/roasty finish with a touch of bitterness that's gone quickly.

Aroma of toasted malt and chocolate with hints of vanilla, very similar to the regular Biscotti Break. Flavor is sweet toasted malt, mild chocolate, vanilla and a perfect light touch of cherry juice in the finish with has a slight hop bitterness. Medium bodied with a pleasant creaminess; nice mouth feel. The Biscotti Break family of porter/stouts has been consistently great tasting and this one keep up the tradition. I had some trepidation with this variant because I'm not a fan of sour flavors in stouts or porters, but other than a mild and well supported tartness, the cherry in this was well balanced by the chocolate flavors. Impossibly well covered ABV, requiring careful sipping because this is as tasty, but not as cloying as a chocolate covered cherry.","LiquidAmber","Feb 13, 2014"

But it is the cherries that work- it is mild and not overwhelming and makes this stand out.

Overall, the taste/smell of the cherries was very subtle -- just enough to counteract the beer's roasty bitterness (an excellent quality for someone like me who has a low bitterness tolerance). Very enjoyable. That said, as I progressed through the beer, the cherry taste diminished (almost entirely by the end), and the roasty bitterness took over.

While the standard Biscotti is flawless in its simplicity, the addition of cherry to the mix adds balance but it also distracts from the purity of the stout. Its a great variation that's certainly welcome in my glass, its a shame that the standard version came along first.","BEERchitect","Nov 03, 2013"

I would like it better if I didn't know how good the base beer was. This is a downgrade from the normal Imperial Biscotti Break but it's still a cool brew to try.","VelvetExtract","Nov 02, 2013"

I opened this at about 51 degrees, so it wasn't like I needed it to warm up to get those cherries: ultimately, I actually had hoped it was just a bit sweeter and a bit more cherry-forward; what I'll do in the future is a side-by-side with regular IBB: that might ultimately help to discern that cherry flavor a bit more. It's a damn good beer nonetheless.","SkeeterBoganski","Oct 19, 2013"
