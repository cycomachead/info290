"FEEL: A much lighter body than I'd expect for something billed as a porter. Maybe it'd work if billed as a brown?"

"O: [4.00] I really like a coffee forward stout.  This fits into that category.  They were not shy with the coffee flavor.  The main gripe is the watery mouthfeel.  It is hard to avoid on a low ABV porter.  Overall I really like this.  I would like to have it again."

"I feel the taste was average but it was very thin tasting to me."
"This is a very tasty coffee Porter! If you're big on that strong coffee taste in a beer you will really like this one! It's delicious!"

"Really enjoyable."

"Excellent blend of a roasty porter with a real solid coffee note. Wonderful balance, and one of the best, most natural coffee additions I have had the pleasure of trying. All-around outstanding brew."

"this beer closely reminds me of surly's  cacao bender only it comes in a 6 pack!  if you're not ready for the vanilla I can see why some people might not love it,  but I think it is restrained enough to still be very good.  overall  the base beer is good too.  it's a little too sweet to be perfect  in my book,  but still very good. I will buy it again."

"O- An above average coffee porter that I'm glad I purchased a full sixer of since it satisfies my coffee beer cravings without breaking my wallet.  Recommended."

"Nice, deep chocolate brown color keeping out the light !!. Aroma is of chocolate and a back of coffee(thought it would be the other way around !!). Head is minimal and lacing is ok ! Taste is nice of roasted coffee infused with a bit of fine bittersweet chocolate. The feel is thick and chewy and this beer lingers around for quite awhile, Nice !!!!!!!!"

"This a quality product and reasonably priced."
"Bottom Line: Organic never tasted so good!"
""
"One of the most coffee forward beers I've ever had.  A light stout but despite the extreme coffee nose and taste it was well balanced.  No ashiness, roastiness.  Also minimal chocolate.  Definitely worth a try."

"o: A very good coffee porter, well balanced and pleasant, especially after the vanilla kicks in and mellows it out.  The best of the few organic brews I have had."

"Whoa this is a chocolate coffee vanilla bomb! Good vt porters are usually much harder to attain than this. I will continue to buy this for as long as I can find it!"

"O- Tasty coffee porter, reminds me a lot of a Jr breakfast stout."
""
""
""

"Overall: This was always one of my favorite coffee beers. glad to see it back on the shelves. I say this a lot but, it's a good ""go-to"" beer."

"Very good, but wow, that is a lot of coffee flavor for the non coffee person.  Overwhelming coffee kept it from being outstanding."

"Solid porter base supports extremely well-balanced medium roast coffee with just the right amount of vanilla in the background.  Enjoyable nose.  Absolutely delicious."

"Alta Gracia Coffee Porter is a beer I am very anxious to taste as Porters are my current favorite style, I am a coffee fiend, and an advocate of all things organic. It's appearance is lovely and suitable, a deep oily brown with a 1/4"" tan head of suds siting on top. I found the aroma to be very very sweet and fresh, definitely a pleasant surprise. A vanilla aspect is dominant and there are hints of roasted malts and coffee beans in the background. The flavor itself is filled with creamy, sweetened coffee, toasted grains, and the slightest sweet citrus touch as well. I'm impressed in regards to the coffee flavor - how it comes through and the quality of it. This is a very balanced beverage, it has a light and silky mouthfeel, and is the perfect summer libation for those who shun the season's typical choices."

"Overall: Excellent coffee porter. One of the best I've had of the style. Another win for the breweries of northern New England."
""
"Coffee is obviously the star of the show here but it comes across well balanced in both aroma and taste. The aroma hits upfront with coffee but is quickly balanced by a creamy, slightly sweet vanilla scent that nicely tones down the bitterness of the coffee. Maybe a slight hint of chocolate in there too. The taste essentially echoes the aroma note for note, maybe just a tad more coffee in the taste though. Mouth feel is medium to slightly full bodied , a bit of creaminess, nicely carbonated."
""
"Not much of a head on this one and a light lacing on the glass. A nice, dark, practically black coloration. I can smell the coffee and vanilla. Taste is excellent, much like the scent, Coffee with a hint of vanilla and very light on the alcohol taste. A bit of a mocha type aftertaste. Delicious."

"O: Far from the coffee bomb that was described by the friend who supplied the bottles, I find that this beer is still quite tasty. The thickness is about right, the coffee and chocolate are well balanced, and there is very little that is unpleasant. That said, it could do for more carbonation and maybe just a little more character... parts of the flavor profile just felt empty."

"Not going into a lot in the explanation of this beer. I am not as educated as many of the other reviewers on here so I don't know if I could do this beer justice. I am fairly new to exploring craft beers . This is definitely one of the best I have tried so far. Aroma is amazing almost like being in a coffee shop. I am not a big coffee drinker so if anything I could find fault in is the strength of the coffee taste. It is balanced well with the sweetness of the chocolate and vanilla. Maybe a little less on the coffee and I would say for sure this would have been my favorite to date. Also this is an organic beer for all of those interested."
""

""
""
""

"Excellent adherence to robust porter style with a coffee speciality ingredient. Perhaps reducing the coffee additive just a tad to allow the other dark and chocolate malts to add some slight complexities and improve the balance would make this a perfect coffee porter."
""
""
""
"Dry and gritty but not chewy like so many other porters. If you like coffee, you will enjoy this."
""
""
"Pours a two finger tan head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Black color, no highlights, yeast left in bottle. Light carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Roasted coffee nose and flavor is strong roasted coffee. $1.90 for a 12oz bottle from a Tully’s Beer & Wine Wells, ME."
""
"Surprisingly good for Wolavers, they don't make any 'wow' beers but this is a solidly great coffee porter, a bit chocolaty very nice overall, hint of raspberry or maybe plum, just a hint though, I got it in a winter mix pack, hopefully I can find it solo."
""
"Overall I did enjoy this beer but I feel there are better examples of the style available."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste has this unique merging of the dark roasted coffee beans and coffee grinds and a kind of pale malt sweetness with a very low bitterness that drops a hint of its participation in the experience. Very easy to drink"

"Willie #1 Beer ya'll! If you do not try this you are only hurting yourself & your sheltered tastebuds. This ranks #1 amongst coffee porters in Willie world. The only thing close to it is Willoughby Peanut Butter Coffee Porter and sometimes Sam Smith or Atwater Chocolate. Drinking a Wolavers iz like watching Gary Franklin tossin a no-look to Cory Jefferson ya'll! Take it from Willie... This Organic Purebread is a WINNER!"

"Overall - I don't want to play it down or make it sound cheap by saying that it tasted like ""adult"" iced coffee when it's cold, because I mean that in a good way! This was a good solid brew that any fans of porters or coffee should try."
""
""
""
"O: This is a really good beer--in my opinion the best Wolaver's/Otter Creek offering (excluding Double Dose). If you like coffee, you'll probably like it. That said, I'm always a tad underwhelmed by how unbalanced and quasi-stale the coffee flavor is. I love coffee, so it's okay, but it's not the most balanced or well done coffee beer, either. That said, this is just about $9 a six-pack and, around here, singles of Dieu du Ciel's Péché Mortel are just about $5 each. I'll take Wolaver's."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours pitch black with a small brown head. Smells of coffee, not surprising for a coffee stout. Tastes of coffee with slight hints of chocolate. Beer is very lightly carbonated goes down great for its medium/heavy body. Overall, a very good beer."

"Overall I found this to be a delicious treat , and I would definitely buy it again. Knowing that they used all organic ingredients also made it a better experience."
""
"O - Pretty impressed by the flavor and smell of this beer. Also love the fact that it's USDA Organic. Awesome!"
""
""
""
"O: Unique, multi-faceted beer with beautiful smell and appearance."
""
""
"First of all, if you like coffee, especially darker roasts, you're almost guaranteed to like this beer. Pours almost pure black with a nice tan head. The head dissipates rather quickly though and I did not get much lacing at all, the only downside to the appearance. Smells almost exclusively of coffee and hints of vanilla. Taste is the same as the smell but also has the smokiness you would expect in a porter. Overall a great porter with exceptional smoothness. I've always been a fan of Otter Creek but this was the first time I have had one from Wolaver's. This one definitely maintains the standard. Very drinkable!!"
"O - While not the best coffee porter out there, this is very balanced and smooth, It does have one of the best mouthfeels Ive ever noticed in a beer, but it needs to boast those coffee flavors just a little more."
""
""
"This may well become the benchmark through which I measure other coffee porters. I just wish its nose belied the taste for which the drinker is in store."
""
""
""
""
"Total Rating: 38 out of 50"
"Dark brown to black in color. Poured with a short beige foam that quickly reduced to a wispy cap. Light roasted malt, chocolate and intense roasted coffee aromas. Smooth, light creamy, incredibly delicate feel. Sweet dark chocolate and bitter malt flavors up front. Flavors transition to dark coffee and bitter hop bitterness toward the finish. Finishes smooth and clean with a dark chocolate and light coffee aftertaste."
"A nice dessert beer. Very much a porter but has the bitttersweet bite of coffee in it. Smells of malted coffee and has a slightly sticky sweet tasting feel to the mouth. Would be great with some rich desserts. I'm drinking this beer straight from the bottle and you can't see through the liquid at all. Worth a shot if you want a sweet porter."
""
""
""
""
"I paired this coffee with a homemade flourless torte and a side of Vanilla ice cream - the experience was amazing. I highly recommend having this beer with a light, sweet and creamy dessert. It brought out more of the rich and creamy coffee flavor of the beer and hid the acid burnt coffee flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"You gotta get out and try these beers! Life is too short for those crappy beers! Don't let them tell you what to drink!"
""
""
"Pours a clear crimson-brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, coffee beans, and vanilla beans. Taste is much the same with coffee and vanilla flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"Overall, this is decent fare, but marked at first by an overly-heavy reliance on coffee notes, and afterwards, by a watery mouthfeel and slightly weak flavors. The flavors themselves are fairly nicely balanced, but the beer as a whole seems like it needed to be better balanced from start to finish, with more oomph put in to maintain flavors over time, and a few more sugars to increase the molasses and caramel notes. The coffee notes could have also been more fresh, like the lovely oily notes that come from beans fresh out of the roaster. In all, some very nice points here, but nothing extremely eye-opening or catchy."
"Good enough balance between the core of the beer, coffee and vanilla to make it work. Was hoping for more robust flavors though the drinkability is pretty high."

"This is not the most complex porter I have tasted but sometimes there is something to be said for simplicity. This porter is heavy on the coffee and that is fine by me; it just works. It goes down smoothly and although it lacks the complexity of some other porters it is a smooth drinking beer."
""
"O: One of my favorite coffee brews, must try if you like coffee."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall  - This is a very nice porter, it walks the line between a stout and a porter with an nice maltiness and hop kick that make it clearly a Porter. The coffee is clearly the star of the beer, and Wolaver's has done a very nice job mixing the heavy, strong and bitter coffee with a maltiness and subtle sweetness that makes this enjoyable, drinkable and complex. Clearly seek to find this in bottles, or better yet on tap or in a growler fill."
""
""
""
""
"This is a little bit of a let down, I want a coffee porter to taste like brewed coffee..."
"this is probably a better review than when i had it on tap. the beer is still SOLID and even though i haven't enjoyed most of this brewery's releases, this is one of my favorite beers to have during winter months."
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this beer but I could see others being disappointed because the flavor is completely dominated by the coffee - as a person that really enjoys coffee, I really like this one."
""
""
""
"Overall quite an enjoyable brew. It's a smooth drinker that demands sip after sip and doesn't really fill you up. I'd buy it again"

"12 ounce bottle, 102412 stamped on the bottle, not sure if it's a bottled on or best by date. I don't care, I'm drinking it anyway. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head. Head retention is very good, and there's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, it smells mostly like coffee and roasted malt, along with some bittersweet chocolate and vanilla. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but the coffee flavor is more of a sweet roasted flavor (because of the vanilla) than a bitter roasty one. I like it because the coffee is definitely noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, but I think it fits the style well since it's a porter and not a stronger stout. It's also very smooth and goes down easy enough. $8.99 a 6-pack? Yeah, I'll be buying this again."

"Of course, some people don't like asparagus and I love it. I'd say this beer is good for what it is. I just don't like what it is."
"O: a fine coffee beer with a pronounced coffee flavor and aroma. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Not overly intense in coffee, but it acts as a nice addition to a porter base. The little bit of vanilla sweetness does well for balancing the roasty flavors. Well worth a try."
""
"O Solid porter with coffee flavor that cements its name. Truth in advertising. When I think 'coffee' porter', this will be on my list of 'go-to's'."
""
""
"Quite good. And the coffee impact is noted, balancing out the alcohol leaving me neither tired nor more awake."
"O Nice porter with great coffee flavors."
""
""
"Nice lite coffee brown in color. Smell, wow can you say fresh gound coffee. Strong on the smell and very refeshing to the nose. Taste is a great blend of coffee and beer. This is what coffee beer should taste like. Mouth feel is very clean, not lingering here. Overall this is what a specialty beer should be. Hay pass the cream and the begals. Wow."
""
"An above-average porter, and all organic to boot. I usually have one a year. You should too. 4.0"
""
""
""
"O: Was told since I indicated I prefer porters and stouts to give this one a try. Exceeded expectations. A solid coffee stout that is available year-round. Surpised I walked by this one numerous times before in bottle shops before the recommendation. Will buy again when I'm craving a porter or stout when the weather gets warmer."

"O-really awesome porter. One of the most coffee flavored-coffee flavored beers I have had. A lot of beers will have the hints of it but this really comes through in the aroma and the flavor but still isn't overwhelming. Great beer"
""
"Rich and creamy mouthfeel that goes down really smooth. Overall, a top notch coffee beer."
""
""
"O: The base beer seems to be more of an English style porter. This approach seems to confuse people these days. When you say 'porter,' most people automatically think dark and roasty. I think this might turn some people off, though I find it to be a refreshing change of pace. My main criticism of the beer is that the taste just does not live up to the nose, and that the coffee flavors seemed a bit old and stale. Oh yeah, and how about that vanilla?"
""
"Nice porter, but the coffee completely dominates, making it somewhat one dimensional, so one was enough. But hey, it's advertised as a coffee porter. Either way, it's still enjoyable and if you like coffee dominated beers, you should try this."
"O - Overall, it is delightful to all the senses except for its feel. I love the smell and taste of this beer. It is just so thin that it kind of ruins part of the experience. That being said, I would still buy it again."
"A excellent porter and highly recommend"
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This was definitely a great beer. Easily sessionable. If you like coffee flavor this is definitely the beer for you. One of the better coffee porters that I've had."
""
"O: It's an OK tasting beer, but well off of the quality I've had in other good porters, not to mention the better coffee porters."
""
""
"This one has potential... I wish the coffee taste was stronger..."
""
"Overall, I was fairly disappointed with the Alta Gracia. I enjoy everything else I've had from Otter Creek, and love coffee porters in general. I'll wait a good while before trying it again. Although I plan to revisit this ale in the future to ensure that there isn't something wrong with my batch (or my tastebuds)."
""
""
""
"O - Enjoyable but didn't knock my socks off. The flavor didn't grab me enough to want to put this beer in rotation."
"O: A good coffee beer, I think it could be improved with a better union of vanilla and coffee beans to cut through some of the acrid notes. Still very pleasant and a good beer for those of us that love coffee."
""
"Taste is of course a big bold coffee taste, but that's it. The porter aspect is gone or more like overpowered by the abudance of coffee. Smooth, medium body with a semi-dry finish. This beer is definitely a good tasting beer, there is just too much coffee presence. Drinks like a coffee beverage. There is no balance of coffee and porter beer, it's all coffee. But it's good."
""
""
"Deep brown with reddish highlights and a short, tan/brown cap. Decent head retention with a bit of lacing. Roasty aroma, coffee and brown sugar, mild vanilla. Nice flavour, moderate bitterness with roast and caramel, vanilla and toffee. Moderate carbonation, but the body felt a little thin, perhaps overattenuated given the dryness - maybe it's just astringency. Overall, nice flavour and aroma. I'd purchase again if in e mood for a coffee beer."
""
"O: The head was a bit disappointing, but then the coffee aroma and flavor were ridiculously good. The way vanilla AND chocolate are integrated into the flavor profile is really neat. And, this porter was very smooth. Possibly one of my new favorites here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavors are obviously dominated by the rich coffee, but much like the nose it reminds me more of a stout than a sweeter style porter. The Alta Gracia is very smooth, almost silky, and easy to drink. It's not as bold as a big coffee stout or 'breakfast' stout, but definitely more dry and complex than what I typically think of in the average porter."
"O - The coffee started off nice in this beer, but after awhile it became too bitter...the vanilla was sweet and didn't play well with the coffee, I think...not a bad coffee porter, worth a try"
""
" Overall this is a very good porter and the coffee is mild yet in the flavor enough not to mistake what you are drinking. I like the balance it offers however I prefer a little darker roast quality from the coffee I drink so that may be why I found the coffee flavor to be light overall. I think the base beer works which is important when adding any flavor to a beer like this."
""
"O: Not too bad of a beer. Good coffee flavor, but that's about it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-usually when I'm the designated driver, as i was when i ordered this, i like to drink my beers slower....however with this beer, i just about chugged it. i couldn't help it! it was so good and it goes down sooo easily! this is an amazing brew! the flavors were so bold and flawless!"
""
"O- overall a very nice coffee porter, good coffee taste. Not filling and overly strong. Light enough for a nice session beer but the sweetness gets to you."
"O - A very nice beer with big coffee flavor. I really enjoy this beer and hope to see more of it in years to come."
"Morey's Bottom Line: If you like coffee, I recommend this. You can taste it better than you can in any of the other coffee beer that I've had (FBS, WnB, B&B, KBS). Maybe not as good, but big coffee flavor for sure."
""
""
"O: Goes down easy, very tasty, not too filling, mild kick, nice representation of style. This is a beer that I could, would, and did sit with for a good amount of time. It's the closest that I've gotten to Schlafly's Coffee Stout. This would definitely be a go to beer for me."
"Overall it was okay I wouldn't try too hard to find this one again, but if it was there and none of the other porters were available I'd get it."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is one of the best tasting, and definitely the best smelling, coffee beers I have tried."
""
""
""
"Yep, if you like coffee, give this one a shot. Otherwise, stay far, far away. Good, but you have to be in the mood. Cheers."
"Slightly watery and fizzy. the thinness is a real dissapointment, additionally lacking a smooth finish. There is missing a certain silkiness on the pallet that my favorite porters possess (ie Fuller's, Smutty, etc.)"
""
""
""
""
"O: A good coffee beer, but could benefit from just a bit of cream and sugar."
""
"I always say that I love coffee and I love porter, but I've never found a coffee porter that offers a distinct coffee infusion. This is it! Well done!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown color with some haze - a fine, bubbly covering rests on top. Coffee roast upfront in the nose, followed by some mildly sweet dark chocolate and just a whiff of vanilla and hops. Increased vanilla bean comes through in the flavor melding pretty well with a creamy coffee sweetness. Some fruitiness lingers after each sip. The coffee reasserts itself after a few sips and comes with a light chocolaty roast. Medium bodied...nothing really notable, but nothing wrong. Overall, just a pleasant organic porter geared towards coffee lovers."
""
""
"O - Not a stellar coffee beer, but not too bad either. Heavy coffee grounds is a bit of an odd choice to get the coffee flavor, beans or brewed would better the smell and flavor. Still wouldn't deny being given one, though would probably not buy again."
""
"O: I'd had a great experience with Wolaver's Pumpkin Ale, so I had high hopes for this one. With my first sip, I commented how good it was (and each new sip was good), but the bitter aftertaste was just a little too harsh for me. I definitely finished it, but won't be going back for more."
""
""
"I've had better coffee porters, and I've yet to be impressed with organic brews... sorry Wolaver... good, but not great.."
""
""
""
"Overall: Wish the mouthfeel were bigger but that is not likely to appeal to the typical Wolaver's customer; clearly the best beer I have tasted from this brewery"
"Overall a decent coffee porter with really nice coffee flavor. My only qualm is that it is very light and a bit one demensional."
"Very solid, my favorite Wolaver’s offering so far."
"Not bad at all. Very easy drinking beer."
"D - Very good coffee porter overall with plenty else going on besides coffee. Try one for breakfast."
"M: Nice easy drinker thats smooth and ver carbonated as I saw from just looking at it. Overall, a very nice beer and definitely the best organic beer I've ever had."
"Notes: Overall it is a good average Porter with a great aroma and easy drinkability."
"Rich, creamy two finger head of brown foam, mainly a weave of microbubbles, about average retention, leaves thick lacing streaks which might need to be washed out to disappear. The liquid on the whole is black with a slash of reddish orange at the glass bottom. The coffee is obvious from the first sniff, more of a roasted bean quality with a light bitterness, only a splash of milk, cream or vanilla, same for caramel, butterscotch and grilled nuts, strong undercurrent of green grasses, while obviously focused on the coffee does not come across as unbalanced or unnecessarily aggressive. Medium to full-bodied, the dry mouth texture helps it stay refreshing and actually speeds it up rather than slow it down as it moves through the palate. The dark roasted coffee bean element decisive with an oily character and smoky perfume. The vanilla bean lacks the power to sweeten the pot, stays in the background with the honey and caramel. The carbonation does not seem weak yet just manages a steady lowkey prickle. No distinct fruit nor citrus flavors although there’s a sense of the latter. Same hoppy green notes with maybe a smidgeon of pine. Offers a mineral water note to cleanse the finish. High quality coffee intensity here."
"Poured this from the bottle to a pint glass, it pours a dark brown almost black look with a visible tan head. The smell is of coffee, vanilla and roasted malts. When I took that first sip and swirled it in my mouth I got a good taste of coffee, vanilla bean, a little bit of a roastiness. The mouth feel is of a full body porter and a bit of overpowering sweetness, but I probably shouldn’t have eaten this with dinner, but with dessert. There is no hint of alcohol when drinking and the taste is very balanced. My only complaint would be it might be a little to on the sweet side. I recommend if drinking, either drink it alone or with some dessert."
"I guess I never read the label, The whole time I was drinking it I thought it was a stout. Anyway it's pour is and very deep brown color with a few highlights of a very dark red. This beer's aroma is straight up coffee with just a little sweetness on the nose. The flavor is what I really enjoy about this beer, It starts you off with a bitter coffee kick that that really lets you know that it's in there. Then the aftertaste smooths out into a soft vanilla flavor. The mouthfeel is just a little watery but still has enough substance in it to make it stand on it's own. I really enjoyed this brew."
"The body is nice and full with soft carbonation. Overall this isn't bad. Kind of a run of the mill coffee porter, but it's decent enough."
"O/D-High hopes after smelling the beer, mildly let down. Still not a bad beer but for my limited porter experience, I would probably go for something else before this in terms of the style. Still worth a try."
"Pretty decent if you're a coffee lover. I enjoyed it overall."
"Overall, this is a decent beer but nothing about it is particularly exciting to me. Coffee added beers tend to overdo the coffee and this is no exception. A bit one dimensional, maybe this could do better with some age. Still, worth a try and it gets some extra points (I guess) for being entirely organic. Cheers!"
"D: A coffee drinker's delight and one porter that had me wishing I had saved it for dinner. Would probably be a tough pair with anything but rich chocolate or raspberry desserts, but it's really enjoyable on its own. Something about porter lends itself better to coffee flavors better than stouts, and Wolaver's Alta Gracia is another superb example of why that's so."
"D: Quite enjoyable. Give this beer time to recover from the cooler...it's quite something! And this is a great cause; always giving it up for sustainability and moral coffee consumption!"
"D: Very drinkable. Even with the lower alcohol content, not sure I could drink alot of this considering the strong coffee, but certainly a pint or two. Wolaver's does not disappoint - would definitely buy again (when in Vt)"
"D - A wonderful marriage of coffee and beer... Deep, rich, and slightly sophisticated... After a not so favorable Otter Creek experience early on in my beer geekdom, I was leery of trying other OC/W offerings, but this one more than restores my faith... I'm happy I invested in a sixers of this and recommend it to either beer or coffee lovers (but hopefully both)..."
"Otter Creek/Wolaver's is not one of my favorite breweries, though they do have their moments. Alta Gracia Coffee Porter is definitely one of their finer moments and is an offering that deserves to be released on a regular basis."
"D: Good for one bottle but you're not gonna make a night of these or I'm not at least. Sometimes it seems more like coffee soda than beer, not that this is a bad thing, but it has to be something you're into. I like it and will probably keep one or two on hand for when I'm in the mood."
"Drinkability: I was very impressed with this. I will be picking up more after this six pack is gone."
"Wolaver's Alta Gracia Coffee Porter is a brown-black ale with a coffee-colored head. It thins to an even foam and leaves thick sheets of lacing on the glass. It has a huge fresh ground coffee aroma with notes of chocolate and vanilla. The soft, chewy medium body leaves the mouth clean and dry. There's lots of coffee in the taste. It's lightly bittered. The hops are hiding beneath the coffee-- everything else is too, really. It's well balanced and pretty mellow with lots of coffee coffee flavor. You want coffee? Here you go. This is quite sessionable."
"Pours a nice two finger creamy looking head. The head is somewhat dark, looks like milk chocolate. The body is pitch black, you cannot see through this beer at all. The lacing leads me to think that this will be a tasty brew. Wow, the smell of coffee is just so overpowering in this beer. It smells like just strait up coffee, I maybe pick up a faint hint of vanilla as well, but not much, it's pretty much just all coffee on the nose. Taste is pretty disappointing, I was looking for a very robust mouthfeel and full taste, but I am not getting that. This beer basically tastes like generic beer mixed with coffee, it doesn't even really taste like a porter mixed with coffee, rather just a generic ale or lager. There are not enough malts or other interesting flavors for me to consider this a porter, and the mouthfeel is way too thin for it too be a porter, it feels more like a pilsner. With all that being said - it still isn't a bad beer, it is very tasty, just not at all what it could be. It is very drinkable, tasty and smooth, but as for mouthfeel, like I said before - pretty disappointing."
"The pour revealed Black Death! I had a thick two-finger cap of deep-beige head sitting atop what looked like the oil spill of last summer in the Gulf of Mexico. Nose smelled like the interior of Starbucks and I usually eschew their coffee because it is too strong even for me, a retired US Navy sailor. Zounds! Lifting the glass to the light reveled NO light penetration, just a glass of oily liquid, black as night, black as the Ace of Spades. The Black Hole of Calcutta came to mind, also. Cue Moe at Sam's Saloon: ""Woody takes his coffee like his women - hot and black!"" Har. The mouthfeel was really full for a porter and the taste was really acidic bitter with hints pf chocolate. Wow! Me likee. As the liquid level went down in my glass, thick, sticky lacing began to appear. The finish remained highly coffee-like and strong coffee at that. It is going to go a long way for you if you like coffee but it may not entice others."
"- Overall a fantastic porter, and sets a good standard. I would prefer a little more vanilla flavor as it says it was brewed w/ vanilla beans, but it is hardly noticeable past the coffee and grain notes."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Aroma was prevalently coffee, slightly burnt hints. Also reminded me of very dark chocolate. Taste was a sweet milky mocha. Had some vanilla lactose hints, but was strongly a milk chocolate with tad of coffee. Tended to finish with well balanced coffee flavors. Solid in the mouth. Very slightly thin, but not bad. Needed a tad more carbonation. Very easily drinkable. Very well balanced and extremely pleasant to drink."
"Drain pour - better beer in the fridge than this."
"Drinkability (4.5): Being a porter it stands out from some other coffee beers. Although it probably wouldn't be a great porter, it's not a bad beer overall. Although there is no ABV information to be found, I'd say it's around 5.5% and hidden well. Very drinkable."
"(12oz bottle courtesy of plondrigan!). Pours dark brown with 1"" tan head. Aroma is ground dark roasted coffee, earth, dark chocolate and a light berry note.Taste is slightly sweet with a roasty bitterness. Unfortunately, this beer is quite thin. Mouthfeel is somewhat creamy, but still watery. Finish is roasty. An ok beer that would be much better if there was any body to it."
"Body seems thin, although there is still a creamy feel. This is really the only knock I have on this beer. Alcohol is a non-factor here. Very well made."
"Taste is mellow coffee, it's there but unlike some others (Victory at Sea) it's not over the top. The bitterness is well balanced with the sweetness leading to a nice dry finish. Dark chocolate and earthy, chewy dark malt flavors round it out nicely - very well done."
"If you must have coffee in your beer, this one isn't a bad one to try. I'm not a huge fan of the style: unlike the combination of chocolate and peanut butter, beer and coffee do not represent a happy accident. The coffee here is far too forward in both aroma and flavor, although the burned and slightly bitter aftertaste is pleasant. The sweet whatever-it-is up front, however, is a bit icky. Non-dairy creamer, anyone? Postum?"
"This is excellent and really gets what it's going for."
"D: The thin body makes this beer seem more like a carbonated coffee instead of a beer."
"Seems fairly drinkable, but I'm not sure if i'd seek this one out again. But better then most that i've tried from Wolaver's."
"Drinkable....well done here. It's wet,has flavor and life,no Shock + Awe beer but feels rich yet not ponderous. No 'nasty"" in there. Organic too."
"I certainly wouldn't contend that Wolaver's Alta Garcia Coffee Porter is a bad beer, as that would not be true. I for one, however, was not enthused with the slightly off-flavor of the coffee."
"Taste-Rich roasted coffee, dark chocolate. Very smooth and creamy with great coffee flavor throughout. A bit thin-bodied but very aromatic and flavorfull. A great beer for coffee lovers."
"It has amazing drinkability, especially for a porter. It could definitely be a 6 pack beer and I'm glad it is."
"D- Very drinkable, the thinness of the body actually helps this area. I dont know the abv but it doesnt seem high at all."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of my morning coffee. Taste is of strong coffee, espresso like, some malts, good flavor. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a quality brew."
"One of my favorite Coffee brews for sure!"
"A very well-balanced beer for everything that's going on. Not one element dominates, but rather they all complement each other, making for a very drinkable brew. If you dig coffee, chances are you're going to dig this beer--especially if you truly care about your beans as much as your beer."
"If you love coffee than this beer is for you. It is a nice take on the American Porter and the strong coffee flavor keeps you coming back for more."
"D - Honestly, I have no idea why this was on my wants but I appreciate getting it! A decent take on a porter, the coffee infusion is heavy while the vanilla, not so much. Not bad."
"This is excellent stuff, tastes like ice brewed coffee. Dark body maybe a hint of ruby makes it through the light, with dark tan head forming thick, fine speckled lacing left behind. Aromatics bring out acidic coffee notes/earthiness/dark chocolate/fruity full roasted fresh coffee roasts. Flavor brings out a super creamy rush of coffee/creamy vanilla bean/earthy robust ballsy porter notes. I can actually tastes fine bits of coffee roasts going on in this brew. Dark chocolate/tree bark/coffee grinds god bless America I'm getting buzzed on beer and coffee. Mouthfeel by the way the acidity doesn't hurt the palate/mouthfeel in anyway, carbonation a bit tight bubbled effervescent for the sytle but it carries everything through even the oils from the Dominican coffee beans from Alta Gracia. Overall this is the best organic beer I've ever tasted, and it's hella drinkable. Alcohol doesn't come through too strong, either it's hiding that fact or it's meant to be drank in number."
"M - Light body, smooth, moderately carbonated. At times is a little bit thin and watery."
"A really sweet beer that would be most likely work best as an after dinner treat pared with some ice cream and cake. Don't think I could do more than one."
"Impression: Otter Creek does well with dark flavors. This is a solid, not stellar, porter. I'm certain to get this again, suggest you do the same."
"This porter appears dark brown in color, with an eighth inch of beige head. The aroma is primarily of coffee grounds. The coffee aspect is not as wonderfully aromatic as I would like. The taste is similar to that off yesterday's leftover coffee, served cold. The feel is medium / thin in body with a moderate amount of carbonation. This was an OK beer, but there are many better coffee porters and stouts available."
"Much better than Founders Breakfast, an unexpected delight."
"Served black with a tiny chocolate colored head, with roasted coffee and cocoa aromas which carried over into the taste. There's a lot of chocolate in the taste and a little bit of vanilla. I think I like my coffee stouts to be thick, and this is a little thin, with a dry and sweet finish that doesn't exactly compel extra drinking. Still a tasty beer for coffee-lovers."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a deep almost opaque black with a thin diminishing light tan head. Aroma is slight fresh ground coffee and dark malts. The taste is a nice blend of fresh ground coffee and dark malts with slight cocoa. The beer is quite light, smooth and easy drinking. This is a very enjoyable coffee porter, one I would certainly have again."
"This beer is exactly as advertised. Perhaps a touch sweet, but quite good and easy to enjoy."
"Reviewed on 3/14/2010. Bottle. Pours black with a small, thick light tan head. Aroma of roasted coffee, roasted malt. Flavor is completely coffee with burnt coffee grounds and roasted nuts in the finish. Smooth malt balance. Wow, what a great unheralded coffee beer! Awesome stuff, especially for Wolavers."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest, lively level of carbonation that could be tuned down a bit. It was surprising how prickly and evident the fizz to this brew was but it couldn't produce a head no matter how hard it is swirled or poured."
"4.5 D: Good, interesting taste and a damn good mouthfeel make this a very drinkable beer. 'Nuff said."
"Poured pitch black from a 12 oz bottle with no ABV or freshness date on the label. Good head which disappears fairly quickly. As the name suggests, this is coffee all the way. Right from the moment I cracked the bottle open, the aroma of coffee was evident. In fact, it is so overpowering that it is hard to get past the coffee if indeed there is anything else to the aroma. The taste again is coffee, coffee and more coffee. Decent lacing along the glass, and mouthfeel is good. But the weakness is the taste, way too much coffee for my liking. It is definitely not up my alley, and I don't see myself having this one in the distant future. Wolaver's/Otter Creek definitely have better beers than this one."
"Surprisingly light for a porter, given the robust flavor and went down pretty easily once I had gotten through the first few sips. Still, I prefer notes of coffee rather than a full-on coffee bean flavor, and would have trouble drinking more than one of these in a sitting."
"To my taste, this is more like ale flavored coffee."
"The mouthfeel isn't very pleasant. I'd actually compare it to drinking cold black cheap diner coffee that's slightly carbonated. Very thin, light bodied overall, not typical for a porter in my opinion, average carbonation. The drinkability is pretty average overall, not horrible but nothing to write home about. A unique idea for this, I like the fact that it's organic. Seems as if it would be more of a summer porter in my opinion."
"Mouthfeel is sweet, with the richness of coffee - while this is no imperial, it's also less watered down than expected. The flavor is strong, interesting, and worth a try; if you can get beyond the intense coffee flavor into the beer itself, you will enjoy it."
"d: Very smooth and rich with real coffee bitterness."
"D/M: leaves a nice smoothness on the pallet, doesn't go down nearly as heavily as expected"
"Not terrible. Just needs some sweetness to round it out a bit. Will have to compare this to my homebrewed coffee porter."
"Conclusion: I would not buy this again, not because It is bad bad by any standards, it is just not what I like in a porter at this time. Again, I prefer sweeter, less dry, fuller body, noticeable chocolate with the coffee, with a creamy feel that makes me think, ah... Yum... And this didn't do it. I do think many out there looking for this taste would think this is a perfect beer."
"Pours jet black with a light tan head. In the aroma, a dry roasty malt and coffee. In the taste, roasty malt, dry coffee, and a small sweetness at the end. A smooth and medium to big bodied mouthfeel, with a hint of dry coffee in the aftertaste. Nice big coffee presence and just a hint of sweetness, just like how I enjoy my coffee."
"D - Well yeah I could drink more and it was smooth and the flavor was constant. Very nice. Still like my Founders Breakfast tough."
"Pours a dark amber-tinted brown with a thin beige head on top. Light lace. The nose was excellent. Lot's of dark-roasted coffee, espresso, faint chocolate, and a mild nuttiness. The mouth was a little more carbonated than I'd prefer, and the finish was oddly thin. It was an easy drinker though. The coffee is very pronounced in the flavor as well, as expected, but it finishes slightly sour and off. Some chocolate sweetness balances it out a bit. Some notes of vanilla in there as well. All-in-all, this was definitely coffee-forward, but it just wasn't my cup of ""coffee."" Glad I tried it though."
"Pours a very dark brown with a hint of light making it through...nice frothy head that retains very well. Smells of coffee and not much else...maybe earthiness. Tastes of the same...loads of coffee, roasty, slight vanilla, dark chocolate but not that bitter at all. Aftertaste is predominately dark roast coffee. This beer is....coffee. Not beer, coffee. I like coffee so I guess it's pretty enjoyable. Slightly thin mouthfeel and a dry finish. If you enjoy coffee, you'll enjoy this. Coffee."
"Poured into my Guinness pint glass an ink black except for just a few rays of ruby when held to a bright light,a thinner toasted almond colored head atop.Aromas are like stickin your nose in French roast coffee gorunds,its that domant in its coffee aromas,a slight dark fruit element comes thru but its light.Flavors of dark roast coffee crystals are overwheleming,I havent had a beer is domianant its coffee character.Its a decent beer,if you like cofee you will like this."
"Pours a very dark brown bordering on black, with a thin tan head that leaves nice lacing. The aroma is all french roast coffee and espresso, along with a bit of dark fruit, very dark chocolate, a bit of lactose and some burnt bread. The flavor is a bit one dimensional, with big arabica coffee and espresso, some dark chocolate, burnt bread, hints of dark fruit and alcohol. The mouthfeel is light and smooth and drinkability is limited by the intense coffee flavor. This is a decent coffee beer, but it lacks the complexity of the better coffee stouts/porters (pipeline porter, FBS, Bell's Java, etc.)"
"Overall this beer is muted and does not hold it's own in the coffee porter character. Few organic beers can truly hold their own for whatever reason and those flaws will keep this one from being revisited."
"Nothing wrong with this beer, but I like a little beer in my coffee. There's nothing here but a bit o' Folgers black."
"D - as a coffee drinker, I could drink this brew all night."
"Overall, this porter really surprised me. The aroma is unbelievable and I just wish the taste packed a huge punch that the aroma did. It is really good and I am glad I had a chance to try it. I won't have a problem finishing this one."
"Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is decent, but you really have to be in the mood for coffee for it to be drinkable. I really enjoyed it after dinner tonight and it was very drinkable in this setting. Overall however it was pretty one dimensional, a very good coffee flavor but nothing that made me really say wow like say Speedway did. Some beer flavors could have been a bit more pronounced."
"DB- Good taste, decent everything else. The price is good as with most Wolaver's stuff. No huge off flavors but the coffee gets to be too strong for me after a bit, but it is a coffee porter. Would like to try it again on tap sometime."
"This poured a nearly opaque dark mahogany with some tan head. It smelled like delicious roasted coffee and cream, with some dark chocolate and hazel nut. It tasted like fresh roasted coffee with dry dark chocolate, and some sugar and cream. It was watery with a little carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this had a great coffee scent with a nice clean taste. The body was a bit weak, and there wasn't much depth to it - basically like drinking a chilled coffee. But it was very enjoyable and definitely worth trying once."
"I have found organic beers to be a bit watery and thin. Similarly here, however the mildness of the coffee was preferable to me than another thick coffee beer. It was more pleasant to drink at lunchtime, sessionable. Poured black, with roasted coffee aromas."
"Drinkability- What a great freaking beer. It's no secret I love coffee beers but this was a hidden gem. So drinkable and smooth and the coffee aspect is EXACTLY where it should be. Potent and even somewhat balanced with the rest of the beer. Thanks much Adam, awesome shit!!"
"Pour out the darkness and watch the ecru head guillotine itself down to almost nothing, a tropical shoreline in the Atoll of the Damned. Frankly, it's not as bad a place as it sounds. Give it a chance and leave your preconceived notions (and inhibitions, YOW!) at home. Nearly nothing but, and, I know, I'm shocked, coffee up front: roasted and dark. My kind of chicken. Hell, it may just be my sad excuse for a nose, but I'm gettin' nothin' but the roasted dark. Na ja. This coffee-ness is nicely subdued a bit once the mouth is involved. Don't get me wrong, it's still there in all its bean-founded glory. It's just that now its solitude is shattered by visits from bitter chocolate and almond. The Hersheys, though, don't stay long, and the coffe once again finds itself alone in that big ol' house. It'd be sad if it weren't tasty. A medim-sized body and thickness will help ease this guy back into the arms of a waiting, sociable public. Trust me, if you'd met him, you'd like him. Ask around."
"Highly recommended, unique coffee porter. The organic certification and sustainable and fair farming practices for the products add another neat and inspiring dimension, as well. A beer I would love to have laying around at all times, to be enjoyed in moderation."
"D: A nice porter that is hit with a heavy dose of coffee. Coffee lovers will cheer this one. The coffee is delicious in this beer which is the best coffee porter I have tried. It is a great blend but I would have a hard time having more than one of these in a row."
"D: What to say? If you can't appreciate an over-roasted coffee, this is probably not the beer for you. The smell is a bit too forward, but the flavors are big and quite balanced. If you can get past the dirt, it's a pretty good porter."
"D: A very nice and smooth drinking experience. Definitly one of their better beers. You cant go wrong with a six pack here, and probably be disappointed that you didn't get more."
"I'm a big fan of this beer and will be picking up more of it to share"
"Overall - I enjoyed it but would probably not seek it out again. It was very similar to Swamp Head's Midnight Oil but with a little less body. I would rather drink the one brewed less than 3 miles from my house."
"D- Again, for someone who doesn't like coffee, I found myself at the end saying ""I could drink another."""
"D: Has session ability, nice and enjoyable."
"In summary, I'm glad I tried this at a half-price happy hour rather than committing to a sixer--I'd ogled this beer many times on the shelves of my local Whole Foods--but I'm extremely unlikely to ever try it again. I suppose I should never say never, though; my review of Founders Breakfast Stout was likewise damning, but I have come to realize it can be quite toothsome with a few months or even weeks on it. Perhaps the same is true of Alta Gracia, but even if this is the case, I doubt a compromise can be reached between the disparate coffee and lambic/sour ale traits of this beer--it's almost as if it has a split personality."
"D - A little off to my tastes. The mix of coffee and vanilla seems to be missing something plus the smokey taste"
"d - Overall this was a very solid coffee porter. I have had a few coffee stouts I would prefer, but the smoothness and creamy flavor this has makes me think I could drink a couple of these, and I would definitely go for this again."
"D) A delicious porter. Well crafted with great flavor."
"Compared to other coffee porters, the coffee content is exceptionally strong but unfortunately overpowers the vanilla - it failed to make itself present. Overall, this brew was well balanced and accomplished what it set out to do. Certainly one of the better coffee beers out there. Extra points for its certified-organic status."
"Really quite pleasant. I was surprised I liked it as much as I did."
"Would I buy more of it? - I'd love to try this on tap or cask (does anyone ever stick some coffee beans in a cask with their beer?). Very solid coffee beer."
"Otter Creek makes some solid drinkable brews and this is another. A must try for the coffee inclined brew drinker."
"12 ounce bottle, twist off cap, no freshness info offered. Pours darn near black, dark tan head, shows lengthy retention, tight and long lasting, leaves the expected tongues of sticky lace. Bright nose of black coffee and bitter chocolate. MOre strong coffee notes, light vanilla and again ample dark and bitter chocolate notes. Decent mouthfeel, give em points for the organic purity, but a bit too much of a java flavor jolt here, unlikely I'd ever go for much more of this full flavor cofee infused brew, hence the lowered and rare (for me) lowered dinkability score."
"I got this as an extra from steelersxl, thanks a bunch man! Dark black, pretty standard appearance for the style, looks good. Smells like coffee grounds after the pot has been brewed. Strong! The flavor is actually better than I expected, very heavy coffee flavor but its not bad, its actually pretty good and I don;t like coffee beers (usually)."
"Rich and robust coffee and caramel flavors. Creamy yet light on the way down. Leaves a soft, pleasant coffee flavor that makes this one a true pleasure on cold winter nights. The quality of the coffee beans is well represented in this offering, well chosen ingredients went into making an exceptional porter. This is my new comfort beer."
"Nice try but a little watery and fizzy."
"D: I'm extremely impressed by this beer. Probably the best coffee beer I've ever tasted. Simply chock full of coffee flavor, with a perfectly balanced vanilla creaminess. Highly recommended."
"D - quite good, again remembering it's an intensely flavored brew. Not going to drink several back to back, but I can definitely see myself revisiting Wolaver in the future."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style this is a good coffee-flavored beer to drink for a while but there are a few others that I would pick first."
"If you like coffee you'll like this beer. Very easy to drink, with tons of coffee flavor."
"Pitch black colored beer with a slowly fading head.Aroma is the smell of a diner in the morning(heavy coffee).Taste is coffee grinds,cocoa,and smoked malts.If you do not like the taste of coffee this is not for you.I enjoyed it but I would find it hard to drink more than one at a sitting."
"Pours near black with a small light khaki head. It would be an understatement to say that the aroma is very coffee forward. Rich, high quality roast. Vanilla bean comes through as it warms but is generally more evident in the taste along with hints of dark chocolate. Low to medium bodied with low carbonation which is fine for the style but nothing really outstanding about the substance of it. Good drinkability, but the vanilla gets to be a bit much as it warms closer to room temp. A nice coffee-centric beer, but there are many better ones out there. Definitely reasonably priced though."
"12oz screw-top bottle purchased at McKinnon's in Salem. A vigorous pour yields a short-lived half inch of dark tan head a-top a nearly opaque black body with ruby-red highlights. Roasty espresso pretty much dominates the aroma with hints of vanilla, nut, and dark chocolate. Coffee is pretty powerful in the flavor too, lending some astringency to the flavor, with notes of vanilla toward the finish. Dark chocolate and nut struggle to be noticed in this coffee bomb. Light to medium in body with moderate carbonation. The roasty coffee tends to make this a bit on the astringent side, hurting the drinkability. If you're a big coffee fan, this is for you. Not a bad porter overall, but kind of a one-trick pony IMO."
"P St. Whole Foods/$8/6-pack"
"edit: while I can't speak for this beer on tap (though given the reviews, I would definitely try it on tap despite my somewhat lukewarm review of the bottle), I want to emphasize that this beer belongs in a snifter or a tulip; if this beer is your kind of thing, you don't want to miss any of that aroma."
"This brew was discovered at the Riverview Cafe in Brattelboro, VT. It's a thick black color with just slight root beer highlights. The head is fair in stature and a light tan color. The lacing is very substantial and uniform. The aroma jumps out with delicious mocha and vanilla caramel, full and sweet, wow! The taste is assuredly bitter sweet coffee, medium bodied, somewhat milky and one of the most coffee rich brews I've had in terms of a pure blend of the two base flavors. Carbonation is very subtle at best, it's quite drinkable and full of flavor. Good coffee bitterness but very pleasant on any tastebud. My favorite Wolaver yet!"
"Otherwise I am smitten with this beer. Great job."
"Highly drinkable for both coffee and porter lovers."
"Interesting and a nice substitution for a coffee with dessert."
"I'd liked this beer as a straightforward coffee flavored beer. It's not as layered as some of my other favorite coffee beers, but the quality of the coffee used seems to be top notch. Worth a try but I'm not sure I'll get it again."
"Nice pitch black color, tan 1 1/2 finger head. Strong aroma of coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malts and slight vanilla undertones. This porter tastes just as great as it smells. My gustatory receptors were blasted up front with freshly brewed coffee, chocolate and a perfectly balanced residual sweetness with a minor hop bitterness to finish it off. Matched with the minimal carbonation and moderate body, this porter is quite possibly one of the best I have tasted yet! Thank you Otter Creek Brewing Company!"
"Overall this was the best coffee porter that I have ever had and i look forward to trying it again soon. Recommended."
"Overall, I'm liking this new addition to the Wolaver's line. They've managed to execute a tasty coffee porter and have probably produced the best organic beer I have ever had. I think if they could beef up the body a little bit and cut back on the carbonation and metallic flavors, then they would have a stellar brew on their hands. Either way, I'm glad I got to try this."
"Props to the Wolaver's line for what they're making with organic ingredients. It could have been more well-balanced, but it's a formidable offering for what it is."
"M&D - it really tastes and feels liks i am drinking day old coffee, slightly acidic and medicinal, without a terribly complex flavor to save the experience, not a beer i would buy more of, but not horrible either, the coffee flavors are tasty"
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a perfect coffee aroma. It's like smelling a cup of French roasted java along with a light hint of vanilla. It's dry and earthy; very nice. The taste is good. It has a dry, coffee flavor with a bit of chocolate and patent malt character as well as vanilla in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is one of the best coffee beers I've ever had. It's simple and easy drinking with the best damn coffee flavor around."
"Poured black into an American pint glass, with one finger of tan head that laced spottily. The smell was fairly one-dimensional (but not surprisingly, given the name of the beer) coffee, with some hints of caramel. The taste however was amazingly ice-coffee-like, with a nice mix of toffee and caramel mixed in. The mouthfeel was thick, creamy and silky, which was a welcome surprise relative to many 'session porters' being made nowadays. Too thick to sit down to session a few, but certainly worth sipping on a relaxing night. Going to stock up on some of these for the upcoming winter months."
"Drinkability: The vanilla taste at the end really makes this one different from other coffee porters I have tried. I think this one is fairly drinkable and I could have 3 or 4. A very solid coffee beer."
"via duffextracold"
"In some ways, I should not rate this because I struggle with this flavor. If you are a coffee lover, you may love this."
"This is a COFFEE Porter! I was tempted to add cream and sugar! Good overall, but could only handle every once in a while..."
"My only complaint is id like to see this beer offered as an imperial, as it lacks the punch and warming feeling of an imperial porter."
"black, but not opaque, with an off-white head that leaves just a touch of lace. wow! nose. it seems like it's all coffee in there, but coffee and yeast/hop/malt share a lot of similar charcteristics. basically, it smells like a really nice, top shelf, freshly dark roasted coffee that exhibits cocoa, vanilla, caramel, vine, earth and smoke. taste doesn't translate quite as well on my palate, but it's still quite good and carries a long, roasty finish that is very earthy, slightly bitter and acidic. i imagine it would be difficult to have more than a few of these, so it loses points for drinkability. 2009 has been the year for organic coffee beers in the northeast it seems. after being well impressed by Peak Organic's Espresso Amber, i was a little let down by this one, but both beers certainly raise the bar and are a must for coffee/beer fans in the ne."
"It has a nice mouthfeel, not overly full. The drinkability is decent and the coffee would make it a beer where a ""couple two tree"" would be good."
"Picked up a six pack at Walsh for $8.99. Poured into a standard pint glass. Dark black color. Thin white head. Some lacing noticed. Smells like fresh coffee grounds. Tastes like an espresso on steroids. You really have to like strong quality coffee to enjoy this beer. While I really like coffee porters and stouts, this one I think went a bit overboard by using such a intense coffee bean. It totally overpowers any flavors of the porter beer that may have been present. More coffee than beer. While it was an extremely flavorful porter, I was not inclined to drink more than one that night."
"A nice offering from Wolavers hope they keep it up!"
"D: Really surprised by this one. I might have to go back and grab a full 6 pack."
"D - A very nice coffee porter...wish there was a touch more vanilla character here, ideally. Alcohol isn't specified on the bottle, but doesn't seem to be very high. This bottle is going down quite smoothly - full flavored, nothing harsh, somewhat light in body. Quite easy to have more than one of these in a session."
"Overall- Delicious Coffee Porter. Heavy on the coffee and very creamy."
"I was truly impressed by this brew...it snuck up on me as an instant favorite and stand by. I hope that more people get to try this one out."
"Despite the shortcomings mentioned, this is still a drinkable coffee porter. The coffee isn't harsh but at the same time, it could be a bit more thick. Otherwise, check out this beer."
