"A ballsy porter. Really had more of a stout character in terms of mouth feel. The coffee cuts through strongest but you get the nice malty sweetness in the finish. I will definitely grab this again when it comes around."
"One of my favorite stouts from Evil Twin. Nice sweetness, bready, toffee, burnt caramel, malty, chocolate, subtle coffee(becomes more bitter coffee aged). Just a great sipping stout for an after dinner dessert."

"This beer is truly a decadent masterpiece and I love it. I've seen a few others picking it apart, but I can't find any faults with it at all. The appearance is a smallish, thick, brown, slow to settle head, some lace, and an opaque black brown black color. Aroma was a volatile chocolate up front, then dark malts, nutmeats, toffee, burnt sugar. Flavor's like nose, in spite of the hype- not over sweet; in fact, nicely bittersweet; just enough tang. Exceedingly well balanced. Body is just perfect for the style with just enough boozy warmth, again to fit this style. An example of genius all around from these guys."

"O:  This is a big beer with big flavors, great complexity and no apparent alcohol flavors.  It tastes great and drinks well for the size so if you like big stouts you should try and get your hands on this one."
""
""
""
"O: Definitely a treat, and fairly unique, but like most Evil Twin beers, it doesn't live up to the hype... or the price.It has a strong novelty to it, but novelty only goes so far. And at this price point, there are better options to enjoy."

"Pretty good overall.  Definitely sweet."

"Enjoyed from the 22 oz bomber in a Delirium snifter, this fantastic (porter?!?) imperial stout pours a thick oily black with a dark tan frothy head that slowly dissipates to a thin coating layer and a beautiful ring with frothy clinging lacing.  Nose of rich roasted coffee, thick sweet dark chocolate, moderate booze with warmth, and deeply roasted malts.  Flavors are EXCELLENT.  Coffee and chocolate ganache compete to a strong sweet malt backbone that is not overdone.  Espresso flavors win out in the end and on the aftertaste with a slick, smooth, creamy mouth feel with just the right amount of carbonation and a strong alcohol warmth that makes this a year round fantastic desert imperial stout.  Awesome.  A new standard that will be hard to surpass."

""
""
"By far an amazing dark favorite. Not overwhelming gives a little bit of a coffee hang time after while the first taste will always be of coffee and doughnut."
"full bodied with modest carbonation. Has a coffee and chocolate aftertaste. There is no hint of alcohol in the taste, which is impressive for an 11.50 % abv beer."
""
""
"Overall, about what I expected. Very rich, dark, sweet, high ABV. A delight."
""
"Had this on 2014-12-26 in Lititz, PA"
""
""
""
"Had on draft at Hops House in Brooklyn. Was the perfect dessert sipper -- sweet, chocolaty and roasty with a velvety mouthfeel, all while being balanced enough for me to have two. Swear you can taste donut glaze. Spectacular."
""
""
"Superb aroma, coffee, chocolate, booze.   I get a ton of chocolate, hints of toffee, vanilla, very sweet but not cloying.  Great mouthfeel I've come to expect from evil twin stouts.  Delicious like dessert"
""
"O - This is a deliciously rich beer. Lots of decadent flavors make a nice winter sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - For me, this is a beer to be sipped slowly in 5-6 oz pours with a group of beer lovers that will appreciate it, especially at over $30 for the bomber.  The smells, tastes and feel are complex and the beer alone makes for interesting conversation/discussion."

"O:impressive brew with strong chocolaty flavor, I'm digging it!"
""
"Donut Beer! Beer for breakfast! This is delicious!!"
"Best Evil Twin I've tried. Just a little better aroma & flavor than Biscotti Break."
""
"I LOVE this! I never get tired of a great stout!"

"Overall, this is one of my favorites.  Maybe not something to drink every night, but one a weekend would do a body good.  No real faults with the beer and not much to improve.  Very well put together gimmicky kind of beer."
""
""
""

"I really didn't pick up the doughnuts in this one, but still a very well done beer.  I was glad I was able to try this one."

"O: Very enjoyable and I liked the stronger roasted flavors and not nearly as much sweetness, all while having a compelling amount of complexity of flavor + aroma. Alcohol is extremely well hidden. Glad I grabbed this one."
""
""
""
""
"Pours  jet black with a thin tan head.   Smells of coffee, burnt grains, maybe a hint of chocolate.   This one is thick!   Tastes of dark roasted grains,  dark chocolate,  burnt coffee, no hop flavor, but the dark grains and coffee add plenty of bitterness.   Full bodied, but still easy enough to drink.  Overall,  first Evil Twin beer I've tried, but I'll look for more!"

"This is truly a world-class imperial stout. I instantly put it up there with the best non-BA stouts I've ever had (see: above). It's sweet enough to be a dessert stout, but not so sweet that it can't be a breakfast stout. Evil Twin puts out yet another phenomenal stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Regardless-- grab a couple of bottles."
""

"pretty good overall, didn't taste much like doughnuts but a solid stout overall"

"O- Pretty good, interesting concept but there are quite a few faults I can't ignore in this beer. Enjoyed this more than Natale, but the original Imperial Biscotti Break is the King of Evil Twin beers. [3.75]"
""

""

"Draft.  Pours dark black with a thick creamy brown head. Aromas of dark chocolate, coffee, cinnamon and spices. Definitely smell sugar.  Creamy and full in the mouth. Oddly, not sweet or sugary in the mouth.  Taste dark, unsweetened chocolate, coffee, roasted malts and sugar - hence the donut name.  Goes down smooth but has a little bitter bite back.  More as the glass warms up.  Good stout but I prefer the Ten Fidy over it as well as Founders Breakfast Stout.  Still, very good."
""
"Bottom Line: Love it!"
""
""
""
""

"Overall. Not getting much in the way of doughnut, but a darn fine stout."
""

"Think more like doughnut glaze and strong coffee."
""
""

"Good Beer I'm wasn't overwhelmed to the point that I wanted to go out and get it though."
""
""
""
""

"I love coffee beers, so this was a real treat since it was an Imperial Porter that hid the 11.5% ABV well. I really enjoyed this beer and think that Evil Twin is one of the top producers of all coffee related beers on the planet. Most of their stouts and porters rank up there with the best in class, and this beer is no exception. A high recommendation, this was very enjoyable and a pleasure to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Eh. Coffee is a little acidic. Would like more sweetness if this is supposed to be glazed doughnut."
""
""
"Overall –   A bit too cloyingly sweet and thick for my taste.  It has some decent darker flavors, but these are just sorta lost in some of the massive sweetness.  If only this was fermented down a bit more, then I think it would be a very enjoyable brew.  But as stands, for the price this is one to shy away from."

"This beer  smells exactly like a glazed doughnut with a cup of coffee nearby. It pours a deep dense chestnut brown with a tan to brown thin foam cap. The beer has legs. The palate is exceptionally creamy rich, combining coffee and chocolate at the front end with glazed doughnut gradually increasing to enter your awareness by the middle to the aftertaste. The beer has just enough roast to balance the doughnut, alcohol and malt flavors. The body is chewy, warming with a little heat on the end along with a touch of espresso coffee roast astringency in the finish. The carbonation is medium low."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Evil Twin has never wowed me before (let me admit, I've never had any of the Jesus varients, but I have had original Imperial Biscotti Break), but this was a very good offering. Unfortunately, this will be gone the next time I go to the store, I really wish I'd bought another two of them. Evil Twin is a label that I know has a dedication to quality that just, for me, does not usually live up to its own potential. This is my first beer from them that has lived up to the hype."

"I didn't catch a distinctly doughnut taste yet this is definitely a sweet desert type beer. Very little lacing that fades quickly. Nice chocolate aroma with bourbon, vanilla, and brown sugar compliments. More chocolate and bourbon in the taste, with a touch of breadiness that could lead to the doughnut classification. Medium to heavy body that carries the flavors perfectly with no noticeable carbonation. If any doughnut comes to mind its a chocolate glazed doughnut, but I was hoping for something along the lines of Mexican cake (relatively). Still fantastic though a touch behind Biscotti break."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This is a good beer, it simply isn't anywhere near as good as Imperial Biscotti Break and the high price point ($18 per bomber) would probably deter me from ever purchasing it again."

"22 ounce bottle. Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head. Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing. The brew smells like roasted malt, bittersweet and milk chocolate, coffee, and some molasses. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some vanilla and doughy/bready malt. But yeah, it tastes like what I imagine a chocolate/coffee doughnut would be. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's coating and creamy with moderate carbonation. The 11.5% ABV is pretty well hidden! I think it's a pretty good overall brew, it's sweet tasting, but not as sweet as I expected it to be. There's a good balance between the sweet and bitter flavors. Definitely worth a try, I wouldn't mind picking up another bottle of this soon."
""
"Balanced and creamy with robust undertones, this beer is definitely one of my new go-to's for double porter selections... Not to mention 11.5% ABV is enough to give anyone a good time. The ""doughnut"" in the title is a little misleading, although I would still classify this as a dessert beer."
""

"Bottle from my trip home to MD. Pours pitch black and syrupy looking into my tulip glass, with a biff creamy dark brown head that turns to mocha as it thickens. Aroma of cocoa powder and chocolate syrup, earthy coffee, some roast, a little brown sugar and molasses. Mostly coffee and chocolate. Flavor is super sweet Hershey's syrup up front with a nice earthy coffee bitterness to balance that out. Plenty of roasted grains, some molasses , and then just more sweet chocolate. The coffee makes this drinkable luckily, otherwise it would be quite a mess. Body is thick with low to medium carbonation and a spicy coffee finish. A nice coffee brew but nothing to speak of with respect to donuts here. Just a gimmick on the donuts, but there's no need for that because this is a very good dessert beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good beer."
""
""
"O – Very solid interpretation of imperial stout (though they call it a porter), but does not accomplish its goal based on the name of the beer. Not a lot of “doughnut” here. I would have seen it more as a straight imperial stout or possibly a coffee beer."
""
""
"Overall Evil Twin is a bit expensive, but they can brew a stout as good as any. Awesome stout..."

"Mouthfeel is awesome. Full bodied no doubt; it has a nice long lingering flavor. Moderate to low carbonation level providing a nice silky smooth feel, yet kind of heavy. Pretty drinkable, but it's filling so it's more of a sipper. A nice dessert beer that would be a little more appropriate to be shared. A great beer. Thank you N-O-C for the birthday gift!"

"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, chocolate syrup, and vanilla aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa powder, chocolate syrup, and vanilla flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with awesome cocoa and vanilla qualities all around."
""
""
""
"Draws rich with a developing head. Decadent color, with a proud caramel malt aroma. Lucious mouthfeel. Imperial stout with a unique residual baking yeast on the tongue. I've also had this on cask at Kudu in Charleston, home of the Glazed doughnuts used for brewing. More doughnuts were in the cask!"

"Pours slightly darker than cola with a loose, mocha-colored head that dissipates towards the edges. Nose expresses cocoa, roast and a hint of ethanol. Taste is roasty, chocolatey and there's also a suggestion of hazelnut and a slight chalky character. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a carbonation just shy of lively. Overall, this beer is fantastic. I think I prefer BA Biscotti Break a little more, but there is a great stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, sweet, full, and pleasant, but not anything I haven't tasted before. It's very good, but not outstanding or groundbreaking."

"Not as good as on tap but this is one delicious beer. The doughnut part is a pretty good gimmick but it certainly is different from the base beer. Worth trying."
""
""
""
""
"Another good variant on this series. Whereas the other variants improve the base beer a lot, this one is just about the same, not a whole lot different than regular Imperial Biscotti Break."
""
""
"O-good flavors and definitely a sipper as the sweetness makes this hard to drink significant amounts of this, good for dessert"
""
"The beer is a deep dark brown, nearing black, with a small beige head. Aromas of chocolate, vanilla, fudge, cookies, alcohol, roast. Sweet vanilla and chocolate. Notes of cookies and fudge. Sweet but not cloying. Thick feel on the palate. Low carbonation with moderate alcohol presence. Overall, solid."
""
""
"O: Well, I wasn't sure exactly what to expect going in to this. It doesn't taste like doughnuts at all (unlike the Rogue attempts). Perhaps it's a beer to have with doughnuts? Either way, enjoyable and easy to drink for such a big beer. Perhaps not world-class, but very well-done."
""
""
""
"O: Solid offering from Evil Twin Brewing. Balanced, very easy to drink."
""
"Pours a black color. 1/5 inch head of a tan color. Poor retention and slight lacing. Smells of alcohol,, hint of liquor, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, slight yeast, and slight oatmeal. Fits the style of an American Porter. Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with a low carbonation level. There is also a slight bitterness from the roasted malt. Tastes of liquor, slight alcohol, strong roasted malt, hint of sweet malt, hint of pine, hint of spice, and slight chocolate. Overall, very strong body, weak appearance, complex, and well blended."

"O - It is a great coffee porter. It has an intense coffee smell and taste. I paired it with a doughnut for National Doughnut Day."
""
""
""
"Poured from a bomber into a snifter, the beer is jet black, and appeared heavy on the pour, with a light, tan, bubbly head. The head quickly settles out into a sparse surface coating with a more defined halo. Aromas of bitter roasted coffee, cocoa nib, sugar, caked, and baked chocolate cake. Smells are heavy and rich. Flavors are heavily roasted and extremely bitter coffee forward, with a solid dose of baker's chocolate, subtle sugary sweet highlight, cake backbone, and a slight booze highlight with a building warmth at the end of the palate. The body is robust and dry, with a heavily roasted coffee aftertaste. The finish is dry, bitter, and warming. This is a beast. Heavy and robust, through and through."

"O: I expected this would probably be pretty good considering my enjoyment of Biscotti Break. From what I recall of that beer, it was just a little sweeter, but they seemed fairly similar.  I seem to recall biscotti have more tartness and bite; this beer had a more bready feel and taste.  Interesting ""remake"" that I think dies better capture the concept I assume the brewer was going for."
""
"Overall it's a great beer , but at the price I can do a lot better , at 15.00 a bomber"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, kind of a gimmic beer. I really didn't enjoy it compared to the other ones I have had. Just too sweet for me. I wouldn't buy this one again."
""
""
"I did enjoy this more than Imperial Biscotti Break which did not live up to the hype or label claims. This one did not live up to the label claims either but overall I thought it had more qualities that I found enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: Lots of similarities to Biscotti Break (which is a good thing imo). Doesn't quite live up to that one but this is a damn good beer."
""
""
"Bomber poured in a sniffer. Pours like black ink. Smells like a typical Evil Twin ""stout"". Chewy mouth with a strong sweetness upfront but not cloying followed by bitter coffee. Doughnut taste is nonexistent but it doesnt matter because this is great."
""
""
""
""
"Nice beer. Not quite the all-out donut flavor I expected but nice."
""
""
""
"I didn't taste a lot of doughnuts here, but the coffee and chocolate were very palpable and delicious. The aromas and the flavors went together really well, and the bitter coffee elements really balanced out the rich chocolate flavors. I thought this was pretty standard stuff for a porter, but much, much more flavorful and intense than your standard porter. With just enough carbonation and hops to make it snap on your tongue."

"Overall another creative beer by Evil Twin, while I don't get much actual doughnut taste, it is a very sweet, rich beer. Coffee adds a nice roasted quality so that it's not just a sugar bomb."

"O: I liked this beer because it still tasted like a porter and wasn't overpowered by residual sweetness from the glazed doughnuts. The alcohol is also very well hidden."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Obviously, it's a little on the sweeter side from the base beer. But, I like this version as it's not overdone."

"22oz bottle. Pours a thick pitch black color with an inch of dark brown head. Good amount of lacing. The aroma is Very rich. Chocolate syrup, sugar, coffee, earth, dough and espresso. The taste is lots of rich chocolate syrup upfront with some caramelized sugar, and espresso. Somewhat doughy with a big alcohol presence. Very sweet as expected. Chocolate syrup and some warming alcohol at the end. Heavy and creamy mouthfeel. Not picking up on much doughnut flavor but I'm guessing it's just mixed in with all the other flavors. I really liked Imperial Biscotti Break so that's why I picked this one up. I like Imperial Biscotti Break more but this one is good as well. Overall, very sweet and pricey but worth trying at least once."
""
"Pretty good for what it is, but give me Biscotti Break any day. Enjoyed it, but over priced, & a little unrefined, Evil Twin I will continue to roll the dice on you, but probably wouldn't if I lived back in Colorado still"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I prefer this to biscotti because of the more subtle coffee. The cinnamon is great in aroma, and makes a more subdued appearance in the aftertaste. Very well balanced and complex."
"O: Right up there with what I'd expect from a stout/porter from Evil Twin. Not picking up any real doughnut flavor, but still a fantastic beer. Was worried that it might be too sweet for my liking, but was not the case."
"O- well worth trying. A very good porter for an after dinner drink"
""
""
""
""
"O: This was quite a let down. However, I'm glad that I got to try. Now, I only need to get my hands on some BA IBB, but that probably won't happen because it is crazy expensive."

"Looks good on the pour. Lots of jet black with tan head that dissipates into a thin layer that continues to hang around. Aroma has dark chocolate, roast, coffee, caramel and a hint of glazed doughnuts. Taste has plenty of dark chocolate and coffee. Good balanced sweetness throughout and booze is apparent but not overdone."
""
""
"Poured a black body with good head and lace and the aroma is like wood, vanilla, chocolate and roasted coffee malts and I guess one could say this is like a sugary donut. Smooth, easy to drink, there is a good amount of sweetness in this beer but to me it's just regular vanilla and chocolate notes along with bread for a fuller bodied beer and there are some roasted malts in the background that provide balance and a dry finish. I like sweet beers and the sweetness and balance where there so I enjoyed this but had ""donut"" not been in the name it would've just a well-crafted ""regular"" porter."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter; no bottle dating, but was released recently. Pours dense pitch black color with a 2 fairly dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, toast, sweet dough, dark bread, toffee, vanilla, cream, light nuttiness, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of coffee and big roast/bready malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, coffee, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, caramel, vanilla, toffee, cream, light char, light nuttiness, and roasted earthiness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, caramel, toast, dark bread, toffee, light char, vanilla, cream, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bready doughnut flavors; with huge robust maltiness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy, smooth, moderately slick, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial porter style. All around great complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/bready malt and coffee flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""

"O - Pleasantly surprised. Goes great as a dessert beer. Chocolate-glazed doughnuts + coffee in a glass. Nothing wrong with that."
"Bottom line: if I saw this on the shelf of a store in California, I would pick up a bottle or two, no question."
""
"Motor oil body, black and viscous; deep mahogany head of thick (though fleeting) cream. A twirl of the glass leaves lots of legs but little lacing, promising a big, boozy drink. Hell of nose if you have a sweet tooth: massive maple syrup, chocolate frosting, cherry cordial, and vanilla-heavy, oaky bourbon scents. Not a doughnut shop, but a candy factory…one with a Willy Wonka that loved booze. The palate follows suit, a wave of gooey fudge, mocha, and sugar cookie. Bring it all together and you get, yep, a little bit of doughnut; that, plus campfire smoke, toasted oak, and a hint of mint. Finishes with a lingering sugary tone, a rich gourmet dark chocolate sticking thick to the tongue. A sugar rush of a drink, and one hell of a dessert. Cheers!"

"this is great beer, on par i think with the biscotti beers, but this adds an extra twist. not sure how its done, are real doughnuts really added to the kettle, i dont really get it, but when i think about it, i taste glazed breakfast treats in here, and i agree with others about its almost waxy texture. hershey syrup in color, smallish mocha head, strange nose. i almost smell chili pepper actually, among some cocoa notes and the evil twin base porter that is just enormous. bitterness abounds, and i find myself happy that this isnt dessert sweet, its only a little sugary, and it cleans up well. i taste an almost spice too, not sure if its the alcohol manifesting itself in a weird way or what, but its there, especially in the finish among the forest of roasted bitterness. yet another beer that blurs the already fuzzy line between porter and stout. also, not extremely different from the biscotti breaks, just sweeter with a more pronounced cocoa or dark chocolate profile. maybe not as doughnut forward as i wanted, but how can a beer really be doughnut forward anyway? i guess this is as close as it gets, for now... huge body, sticky feel, milkshake density, long finish. enjoyable, but a bottle that you must not drink alone."
"O - Very nice dessert beer. I never tasted doughnuts, but damn good nonetheless. Yep, it's recommended. Cheers!"

"Full body, coats nicely, alcohol non existent. You really have to search for the donut after the aroma to me. Great dessert type brew, but not over the top liquid sugar like some of the Southern Tier offerings."

"Verdict: A nice beer from Evil Twin, but falls well short of Imperial Biscotti Break, which was so bursting with flavor, this was a more mellow experience in a way. It wasn't as put together, a bit muddled and taxing to pick out the nuances. Definitely complex, but not integrated. I did enjoy sipping on it over the course of an evening as a dessert."

"The regular, non-imperial Biscotti Break remains my favorite of the series."
""
""
""
"I guess I was thrown by ""Doughnut Break""...I was expecting something heavenly doughnut'y. I guess I was wrong. This brew rocked! I would Highly Recommend at least a try, even at $20/22oz. It's delicious."

"o - Overall I thought this was a really good beer and I am a huge fan of this series of beers. That being said, I would rank this slightly below the Natale cherry version, and both significantly below the normal IBB and the BBA IBB. Given that I can buy IBB for the same price on the regular, I don't see myself picking this one up again, but it is still a good beer."

"I can say that I really enjoyed this beer - it was nothing spectacular, but definitely complex and unique. Worth a try."
""
""

""

"o - probably my favorite evil twin beer. let me stop typing while i go get another bottle..."
""
"I know IBB is a popular beer and a big seller for ET, but I really wish they'd give it a rest on all the various variations. The bourbon barrel version and the regular IBB were great, but I could have completely lived without all the others. Oh well..."
"Overall: This is the best dessert like beer I've had to date. Easily able to finish the entire bomber by myself. The flavors are well done and very balanced. Definitely recommend if you like sweet but not overly sweet (ST's Creme Brulee) offerings."

"Solid black body, above which a soft khaki head of thick foam forms and settles to a thin film on the surface and collects at the edge to form a nice collar. Aroma is of chocolate roast, coffee, sugary donut glaze, heavy cream, and dark fruit. Robust chocolate flavor along with nutty dark roast coffee, moderate bitterness, creamy sweetness, and a glazed, almost pastry-like character. Heavy, creamy body with a tingling finish. Sweet, as expected, yet not way over the top which it could easily have been. I haven’t had this in the bottle, but there is definitely something “cakey” going on in both smell and taste coming from the tap. This makes for a unique experience that I rather enjoyed, though I would never try to drink a whole bomber by myself. As far as harnessing the mighty power of the donut, without letting things get too crazy, I'd call it a success."

"Overall - I don't get the doughnut thing, but it's a good beer."
""
"Overall, I almost want to trash this beer given the price I paid, but I'll go ahead and not bother doing that. I was expecting (and actually hoping for) a beer with huge amounts of glazed doughnut flavor, but I just got a really nice imperial porter -- with some doughnuts added. Like I said, had the name of the beer not been ""Imperial Doughnut Break", I wouldn't guess that doughnuts were used. There is definitely a doughy flavor, but I'd not pinpoint it. It's a nice beer that I'd have again, but it's hard to justify the price here. Truthfully, I like this beer a bit more than my rating indicates (maybe by a quarter of a point in most categories), but it's a slight let down."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Very solid beer and yet another enjoyable desert beer from Evil Twin. The doughnuts are obviously kind of a gimmick but it's still a good beer. Worth a try but if you've had Imperial Biscotti Break, you've pretty much had this beer."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good, imperial sweet stout. Very sweet, yet balanced because of the darker coffee roasts. A very interesting, somewhat doughnutty version of Biscotti Break."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Dark chocolate and espresso notes upfront. Some nuttiness and hints of chocolate cake and roasted malt in the middle. Finish brings some day old coffee notes and just a touch of doughnut glaze. Slight char as well at the end. Loved the smell and thought the taste was decent. Nowhere near as good as Biscotti."
""
"Overall: Not being a huge fan of overly sweet beers, I was a little concerned by this one when I bought it but felt I had to give it a shot to compare it to the others in the series; easily my least favorite, I am afraid, as the sweetness is similar to what I have encountered in some of the sweet Southern Tier beers"

"O: An interesting and very tasty ""imperial * break"" brew. Coffee and chocolate flavors are quite nice, as it the nuttiness. Mouthfeel is great and so is the drinkability for an 11.5% brew. Don't get a whole lot of donut in this one, just sort of a minor, sweet doughy overtone. And half of that is probably the power of suggestion. If I tasted this blind I doubt I would have picked it out, it's that subtle. Still delicious, just a little bummed that I'm not drinking alcoholic liquid donuts."

"O - There's little to no doughnut, but there's whole lot of delicious porter."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I bought this beer reluctantly, but I am drinking it way too fast and also enjoying it along the way. The doughnuts help to tame the bitterness from the coffee and help to let the chocolate notes shine through a bit more than the original. Outstanding."
""
""
""
""
"Not as over-the-top as expected, the crazy donut scent is really one of a kind and great, the taste didn't quite match up but was good in its own right. A nice fun stout."
"O: another interesting take on the Imperial Biscotti Break brand, sure to appeal more to some than others, and certainly worth the try if you've got the dough ;)"
"Poured into a Reuben's Brew snifter. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing black in the glass, with a thin light brown head with good retention with light lacing. Nice aroma of chocolate and dark toasty malt, very much like a high quality dark chocolate donut. Flavor also emphasizes chocolate, with a definate cake like element; baker's yeast. Chocolate glaze, eggy brownies, vanilla, hints of coffee. Complex, but in the chocolate / cocoa universe. Good medium creamy body. A flavorful, chocolate forward imperial stout that is very nicely integrated. It may just be the power of suggestion, but I did detect cake donut flavors in this stout. Creamy and rich, this is a great addition to an already well loved series of stouts. ABV completely and dangerously covered. Donut."

"Yes, this beer drinker humbly presents the case that glazed doughnuts are very prominent on the palate of this beer. And yes, it is indeed a tasty drinking experience. It would have been even better had the alcohol not been as present on the finish, and the nose could have been much more aromatic. Not anywhere near the gluttonous level of Mornin' Delight or Dark Lord for example. And the body is a little light for the offering, need even more creaminess, heft, and stickiness for something that is supposed to be so gluttonous. Still, I am thoroughly impressed by the execution of this glazed doughnut imperial stout. Seek. This. Out!"
"This one pours a full bodied midnight black with a two finger dark mocha head. It looks like you'd want a beer of this size. This nose is big and rich. There is smooth roast, light coffee, and sweet chocolate glazed doughnut. I was skeptical about doughnut character being present in the nose but there actually is chocolate doughnut. The flavors are very well integrated. It drinks like a liquid chocolate glazed doughnut with a touch of roast. There isn't any alcohol presence whatsoever. It's delicious. The body is perfect. It's big and so smooth. Overall I think this is fantastic. I enjoyed this just as much as the Biscotti, if not more."

"Overall interesting, a great base beer but not a ton of doughnut, an interesting lIght note of it."
""
""

"Reminds me of an Imperial Stout with a doughnut and a muffin mixed in. It has a unique feel that could really be utilized nicely and works well here."
""
"O - Overall I enjoyed this beer a lot, but not nearly enough donut flavor."
""
""
"An interesting variation of a fantastic base. It's almost like the doughnuts were used for dry hopping- there is a good bit in the aroma but almost none in the flavor. Still quite enjoyable and I look forward to having another. Further cements in my mind the notion that the Evil Twin and Westbrook partnership makes for some excellent stouts."

"O- Another great beer from Evil Twin. Wish I the doughnuts were more noticeable, but I will pick this up again!"
""
"Instead, the doughnuts give a hint of aroma and sweetness throughout the flavor. Doesn't live up the expectations unfortunately. However, we're talking about a wonderful beer of Imperial Biscotti."

"O: doesn't really resemble a donut, unlike imperial biscotti break which is impeccably similar to a real biscotti but very good nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
"This ""Imperial Porter"" is fantastic in every way. With so much acclaim with the doughnut infusion, the actual taste of doughnuts are rarely noticed in the ale- a lot of imagination is required here. But the real problem with the beer is that the ""Imperial Biscotti Break"" came first. As that is a better ale, this one simply struggles to live up to expectations."

"It has all of the aspects you'd want out of a dessert beer without being overly sweet or too crammed with crazy flavors that make it undrinkable. Definitely pick it up if you can find a bottle."

"Had this one at Brewvival 2013! Poured by Jeppe himself! Served from tap into a Brewvival sample shaker. Poured basically black with a half finger brown head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, doughnuts, dark fruit, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, dark fruit, sweet alcohol, and (you guessed it) doughnuts. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I was a massive fan of the base brew for this one if I am honest. The addition of doughnuts really took it to a new level. This note of sweetness really binded every other aspect going on in the base brew and enhanced it for my palate. I really am glad I got the chance to try this one and plan to make my own version in my glass next time I have an Imperial Biscotti Break. Just sayin'."
"Fantastic beer and a definite treat."
