I got it as part of a mixed seasonal 12- pack (I'm a sucker for mixed 12-packs to try out a few of a breweries' different offerings) , otherwise I tend to stick to IPA's and other hoppy types without really trying a broader range of a brewer's styles. So while I normally retch at the thought of a pecan/maple flavor beer, I tried it anyway. It turned out as bad as I had feared, with the taste being an artificial-flavor rendition of maple and (lesser) pecan. Turrible from Sam Adams. I still enjoy several of their other less bizarre flavors. It's very possible that I just don't appreciate this style of beer.","beerlust","Jun 21, 2014"

3.99,10.2,3.75,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle, best before May 2014. Got this bottle from a friend last weekend. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a dark ruby red/brown color with about a half inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice and sweet, it smells like maple, nuts/pecans, and roasted malt. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some caramel, chocolate, coffee and a bit of smokiness. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit syrupy and creamy with moderate carbonation. I liked this brew, and if you like sweeter tasting beers then I would recommend it.","bluejacket74","May 09, 2014"

Aromas of sweet roasted malts, caramel notes, hints of syrup & dried nuts as well as coffee & chocolate hues. Flavor profile -as expected from aromas- displays caramel & roasted notes, chocolate & coffee infusion touched by herbal sweet syrup. Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Silky palate & dried mouthfeel. As it warms, maple syrup increases & lingers into a sweet finish in combination with arising dried nut sensations. Sweetness reaches the edge of cloying but slightly roasted notes & nuttiness hold it back. Interesting Porter that makes me miss a hot Pecan Pie!!","GONZALOYANNA","Mar 23, 2014"

The nutty aroma mixes well with the hops and compliments the strong porter. There's also just about the right mix of malts, maple, hops (I wish I had more than two from the variety pack to partake.)

The pecan smell is more intense than in some other pecan ales I've sampled in the past, which works well for this porter. The flavor is very pecan with hints of coffee and maple as well. The pecan is the star of the show here. The body is medium with light carbonation. This beer drinks very well and the finish is only slightly dry.

A subtle mocha backbone adds to the sweetness, but also provides enough of a bitterness to keep the beer balanced. Smooth in mouth, the dryness of the coffee combats any cloying characteristics.

Still an enjoyable beer, though. Kind of surprised it is in the spring selection because it tastes and feels like something I would want after an autumn hike or in front of an early winter fire.","chrisd73","Mar 03, 2013"

Some lacing retreats down the side of the glass with the head. The are aromas of bready malts and very nutty from the pecans. The pecan smell is more intense here than in some other pecan ales I've sampled in the past. There are also hints of coffee and maple in the nose. Like in the nose, the flavor is very pecan forward and the malts are bready. There are those hints of coffee and maple as well, though these are not strong hints. The pecan is the star of the show here. The body is medium with light carbonation. This beer drinks very well and the finish is only slightly dry. This is an excellent beer.

The maple sweetness is dominant, but not overbearing. Pecan nuttiness and a some woody bitterness into the finish. Lingering sweetish roasted malt and vanilla. Medium bodied, with a nice, creamy feel. This beer is what is says it is, that is for sure! If you like strong maple and pecan flavors, this beer is for you.","alexgash","Jan 24, 2013"

3.6,-0.6,3.5,3.5,3.75,3,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and an ok example of the style. the maple syrup and pecan are really nice but the Porter base is lacking a little and I wish it had more roasted flavors and aromas to it, so it isn't the greatest example of an American Porter, but other then that it's fairly true to it's name. This beer had good drinkability, it was pretty smooth, with some nice flavors to hold my attention, I could drink two or three of these but I think after that the sweetness would become too much. What I liked the most about this beer was the taste, the maple syrup and pecans showed up very nicely and they were the highlight of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it wasn't bad, but there was too much carbonation for the style and it got to be a little prickly. I would buy this beer on it's own, I don't think I would buy a lot of it, but it would be nice to keep in the fridge during the colder months, and I recommend this beer to just about anyone, unless you have a nut allergy. All in All I enjoyed this beer, I thought the American Porter base could be improved on some, but the maple syrup and pecans seemed to carry this beer and made it pretty enjoyable. Good job Samuel Adams, this is one solid beer and it's my favorite in the Spring Thaw pack, I like the concept of this beer and I think with a stronger Porter base this could be a really good beer, thanks for another enjoyable beer.","StoutHunter","Jan 21, 2013"
3.65,0.8,4,3.25,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Pleasantly surprised by this one. I admit I was afraid this would be a little one-dimensional and overly-sweet, but was surprised by something that is sufficiently complex and balanced. This actually tastes quite familiar to me...porter is always a holiday mainstay for me, as are Swedish nuts. Sam Adams basically took both of my favorite winter flavors and conveniently combined them for me. My only gripe is that this really feels like a Winter beer and would have been well-placed in that mix pack. It strikes me as a little bold and heavy for Spring...but then again, with several months until anything resembling Spring here in New England, I've got plenty of cold weather left to enjoy this one!","deciding39","Jan 21, 2013"

3.95,9.1,4.5,3.75,4,3.75,4,"Pours a pitch black color with a thick, very creamy, tan colored head. Excellent retention and lacing. Smell is of dark roasted malt, coffee, and maple. Taste is similar, there is lots of dark roasted caramel notes up front with a coffee like bitterness. This fades to a mild sweetness of maple syrup, and finishes with a nice clean and crisp taste. Medium carbonation, full body. This beer is pretty easy to drink, however its slightly off balanced towards the sweet side. A little too much syrup flavor for my tastes I think. Also the mouthfeel is slightly oily from the pecans I would imagine. Overall a decent beer to try, definitely better than most.","scvance","Jan 12, 2013"

Looking past that it does carry aromas of chocolate. There is also a bit of maple, but I detect no pecan. The taste is chocolatey with some coffee, but the finish shows signs of maple syrup and pecan with a bit of wood. The hops are almost undetectable. It is a bit overly carbonated for this style of beer, but the mouthfeel definately gained some body from the addition of the maple syrup. Its good, but not great.","silverking","Jan 09, 2013"
