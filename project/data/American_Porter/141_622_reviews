"A very well done porter by a reputable brewery."
"Pint at Uncle Buck's in Grapevine Texas."
"Proof that I just don't like this style."

"Very good Beer I would get again"
""
"This is a very good porter, nothing fancy, just a great balance between sweet carmel and a dark roast bitterness.  The feel is full and smooth.  Very drinkable."

"Great with any chocolate dessert!!!"

"O:not special, but very nice:"
"Delicious. Well paired with desserts specifically chocolate"

"Bottle.  Appearance is close to black.  Not sure where the company or others get ""amber"" from as a descriptor.  A very thin and unimpressive head that left quickly.  I smelled malt as the predominant aroma.  Was not very sweet in smell or taste, although I would have preferred a touch more sweetness.  Some coffee showed up as it warmed, but never chocolate.  Flavor was sort of neutral, something for everybody.  Feel was close but not truly creamy."
"Presentation: Packaged in a standard twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle, sealed with a pop-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
"Pours like soy sauce with a thin ring of khaki head. Smells of delicate sweet cream, vanilla, and cocoa. Tastes of bittersweet chocolate malt and smokey oak. Mouthfeel is somewhat watery, but there is some carbonation and a thickness in the finish. Overall, I've never liked porters. I'm not sure why, I think it's a combination the sweetness with acerbity, lingering smokey and bitter notes and a watery body. Either way though, this beer isn't bad. I may not like them, but after tasting this one, I do respect them."
"Overall I thought this was a good beer and I thought it was a good example of an American Porter, it had pretty much all the aspects that I look for in the style and it didn't seem to have weak points.  This beer has good drinkability, it's smooth, fairly crisp, slightly sticky, not too filling and the taste does a good job at holding my attention, I could drink a couple of these especially during the colder weather.  What I like the most about this beer was just how true to style it is, it reminds me of a couple local Porters that I first tried when I got into craft beer.  What i like the least about this beer was nothing, I don't think it has any off flavors or any weak points.  I would buy this beer again when In the mood and I might even have to put it against some of my favorites of the style.  I would recommend this beer, especially if your a big fan of Porters.  All in all I enjoyed this beer, it was just what I wanted out of the style and I'm glad to have this an option now.  It's my new favorite Smuttynose beer and it's one of the better example of the style that I've had.  Good job guys, this was a really tasty Porter, keep it up."
"Really nice chocolate and roast notes. Medium bodied and carbonated."

"The second entry in my six bottle American Porter taste test. Deep black color in the glass, nearly opaque with a dark tan to leather brown colored head that lasted awhile, lacing the glass nicely. Rich (like a black coffee milkshake) mouthfeel, with roasted chocolate/coffee in the nose. A hint of malt sweetness (dark roasted) on the tongue and then a rich roasted smoke with a bit of residual sweetness, ending with a quick hint of bitterness. I understand the attraction and the beer was good, but the flavors came and went without really combining or balancing each other, as if it wasn't sure what it wanted to be. As the glass warmed, there was also a hint of astringent alcohol in the nose that was warming, yes, but detracted from the overall flavor. Again, I agree with the high ratings, but I was disappointed a bit in the way the flavors joined overall."

"The perfect balance between malt and hops. Thought the smell was great. The taste was exactly for me. I'll definitely search this one out and try to find it. Great Beer."

"Overall. For me, it's a bit thin and a bit too middle of the road. I prefer a stronger lean toward either the malt or the hop. Not nuts about dry finishes in a dark beer."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel was smooth and on the watery side with mild carbonation, a medium body that had some chewy consistency, and a nice slightly bitter finish that had sweet fruit and sweet chocolate notes help it ease down quite enjoyably. A damn good porter that always delivers."
""
"This is a great Porter, one of my favorite. Pick up a Sixer, you'll love it. Perfect for the winter. Grab some before this Tues Blizzard. World Class for sure. Cheers."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 6/8/2015. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 2 finger dense and rocky tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around- the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, dark bread, light nuttiness, light smoke/char, light herbal, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted/bready malt and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, dark bread, light nuttiness, light smoke/char, light herbal, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roast and herbal hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, dark bread, light nuttiness, light smoke/char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and light earthy hop flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome porter style. All around great robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink for the abv. A highly enjoyable offering."

"first smuttynose beer i've had. very good"

"Solid porter with smoky full malt flavor and slight bitterness."

"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Pours a deep dark mahogany red.  One of the best looking beers I have seen.  Full 3 fingers of head with abb aggressive pour.  Nice lingering head with lacing.  Smell the malt, coffee and chocolate.  Not as full in the mouth as you would expect from the head and look but not light either.  Carbonation is heavy.  Chewy though.  Taste the malts and hops but well balanced and smooth.  Very subtle coffee and chocolate notes.  Goes down easy without burn or boozy aftertaste.  Less spice than expected.  Good winter porter.  I could drink several back to back.  Halfway through a pint and head still lingers with nice lacing.  Very impressive porter."

"From bottle, good appearance with a dark brown colour and good film retention. Smell had coffee and some dark cocoa but also some fusual alcohol esters. Pleasant roasty and licorice herbalness. Taste is creamy with chocolate and toasty malt and a good dose of bitter earthy hop notes. Pleasant feel, dark licorice notes, dark malt, some orange spice. Good roastiness with a creamy satisfying mouthfeel. Enjoyable porter, some warmth and spice to it. Pretty good balance to make it a satisfying but quenching porter."
"Not a bad tasting beer dark,rich & robust flavor."

"the platonic ideal of the type. in my considered opinion, this is the epitome of the style. when i want a porter, this is what i want."

"Dark flat not too sweet good winter flavors"
""
"I havnt had this beer in a while, but what a solid porter."
""
""

"Roasted malt nose, dark opaque black with brown head. Strong malt up front with lingering coffe and some hops to finish. Delightful stuff."
""
"Good flavor, but really strong. A little too strong."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - a very well crafted American porter, not quite Edmund Fitzgerald in my mind but certainly a worthy offering for my 500th review. For my fellow Canadians, pick this up while you can."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Bottle. Drinkable, rich, smooth.  Great coffee/chocolate flavor--a bit much carbonation at a finish when I expected nirvana.  Such a good beer."

"Pours out a deep brown with a thin, tan head.  Smells of roast malts, brown sugar, mild fruity esters.  I'm surprise there's no coffee in this.  Big coffee and roasted malt flavor dominates.  Solid bitterness in the finish, which feels like a mix of roasted malt and hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel is moderate in weight.  Carbonation is relaxed.  Overall, this is a very solid porter, leaning more towards stout territory IMO."
""
""
"A shade lighter than black and semi opaque, the bubbles on top are thin and light khaki in color.  The smell is coffee and roast malt, dark caramel maybe a hint of chocolate and a bit of floral hops.  The taste is a wonderful balance of the roast malt character combined with bitter black coffee and a rather assertive hop bitterness that blends nicely with the bitter character of the malts.  Medium in body with low to medium levels of carbonation, the finish is a little bit dry and definitely bitter I'd prefer it to be just a bit more smooth and have a sweeter finish.  Overall this is quite good I cant believe I've overlooked it for as long as I have."
""
""
""
""
"Flavorful and superbly balanced Porter. Bold mocha roasted notes and a good complexity and hop profile: earthy, citrusy and piney. Huge drinkability, a truly American Porter, not radical."
""
"Poured into a glass pint. Very dark beer with a thick brown head, moderate amount of lacing that sticks for the duration of the drink. Smell is raisin and coffee with hint of piney hops. Taste, absolutely delicious. Raisin, toasted caramel, dark burnt coffee, piney hops, and perhaps date or plum. Mouthfeel is moderate carbonation, very smooth. Overall, an outstanding porter. Well done by Smuttynose especially as I'm not a fan of most of their brew."

"Begins with wooden malts among a toffee sweetness with hints of cane sugar, which directly turns more present, accompanied by molasse. Burned malts settle the balance in this one, smoothing the way for a spicy coffee bitterness, wrapped up by soft cream, creating a smooth mouthfeel. High carbonation adds complexity and piercing force to the coffee, which punshes in a pleasant way through the slick sweetness, creating a convincing, diversified complexity. Finishes very smooth, sweetness turns coca-cola like for a split-second, soon getting detained by rich, roasted, unsweetened chocolate and coffee, along with wooden hints."

"This is one of my favorite porters. Hands down. So full of flavor with a big roasted quality but excellently balanced. I love that this beer is readily available to me all year round. It's something that is in my fridge more than other beers."

"Two fingers worth of tightly packed crisp medium to dark khaki colored froth with a bit of a batter like top...  Turns a bit creamier as it settles a bit...  Really nice retention...  The color is a deep dark brown...  There was a slight reddish hue noticed during the pour...  Mostly still with just a few micro carbonation streaks seen towards the top of the glass...  Chocolate, coffee and roasted malt in near equal proportions...  Everything a porter should display on the nose...  The flavor profile tilts towards to a lot more of the roasted malt and slightly less of the coffee and chocolate notes...  There is also a subtle but complimentary hop presence...  On the fuller side of medium bodied...  Slightly dense...  Moderate to sharp carbonation...  There is a slight grittiness and chalkiness about this one...  Finishes with just a touch of dryness...  An outstanding American Porter...  When combining that with the modest price point,  this could prove to be a go to brew..."

"Bottle at the Rookery. Dark black with frothy white head. Aroma of roasted coffe and chocolate. Taste of roasted coffee with a bit of sweetness at the backend. Medium bodied with a mild bitter aftertaste"

""
""
""
""
""
""

"This was enjoyable even though porters aren't my go-to preference. I haven't tried too many, in fact I recall only Black Butte, and that was excellent. This one seems solid too."
""
""
"A Nice head atop deep brown body. Noticeable coffee notes with enough sweet/bitter interplay to keep me interested. More fizz than other porters, but balanced by a slightly sweet back. Mild aroma and a good foamy-cling to my glass. Not the best but another good example of the style."
""
""
""
""
"It's a sin, I know, but one of my favorite guilty pleasures is to go pick up some cheap chocolate ice cream and go to town on it alongside one or two of these guys. A match made in heaven."
""

""
""
""

"Pours a beautiful light mocha colored head that dissipates relatively quickly and leaves only moderate lacing. Coffee notes predominate, and roasted black malts give a pleasant bite to this full bodied yet smooth brew."

"Pours an opaque super dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and char aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa, char, and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast and hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a nice balance of roast and hop aspects."

"popped this top and poured into my favorite Cape May Brewing Co. glass. Appearance was spot on, with a creamy head and a beautiful dark body. The smell was warm and nutty, with hints of toffee. Taste was a great standard for porter, hints of chocolate and coffee, small note of caramel. This brew is hearty and satisfying. The best part is that it is readily available in almost all beer stores!"

"DATE REVIEWED: May 9, 2014... GLASSWARE: Howard's Pub pint... OCCASION: NFL draft, day two--and the Manziel rush dissipates with Gordon's suspension... APPEARANCE: thick two-finger brown head sits atop a jet black body--yup, it's a porter! thick, smeared lacing... AROMA: rich, toasted malty tone; toffee is present; hops are punchy but brief... PALATE: creamy, vibrantly active at the throat; a softened, stout-like profile that endears and demands another sip...TASTE: sweetly puckering malts, pleasant and easy drinking; toffee and lactic flavors predominate; robust, yes--but I do not detect the chocolate or coffee promised by the brewer's profile...OVERALLL: surprisingly distinctive in the genre--a truly worthwhile experience from a beer whose label suggests otherwise..."

"O: What a great beer - lots of complexity in the flavors and aromas of this beer which is quite flavorful but light enough in body/mouthfeel to make it very easy to drink. The lower ABV makes this one that I could enjoy a couple of pints in a single session."
""
""
""

"O) A delicious porter. Great taste profile. I will definitely have another!"

"O- Solid. Not spectacular IMO, but not bad."
""
""
""
"Overall- This could easily be a stout. We all know the distinction is blurred anyway and, with this ABV and the amazing, robust taste (as the name suggest), it could be a stout. I'd probably not really be able to distinguish in a blind test. What I especially like about this one is that it was like a roasty/chocolatey beershake! Sweet but balanced. Awesome. My favorite porter to date."

"I'd come back to this one. Delicious. I don't know, ""robust"" just that word put ideas in my head that I was expecting sweet and heavy bodied. While definitely robust, it's not exactly fitting that bill. Compared to others in the style, I feel Smuttynose has done something more drinkable and more bitter, I can get the hops in there at the end as well. Good beer."
""
""
""
""
""

"O- Bold but manageable. Teeters on the border between porter and stout. Good stuff all the same."

"O: This is a great surprise find. Really flavorful and robust (good naming choice). Well balanced taste and mouthfeel."
"Overall this is a very good beer."

"A very good beer. Very dark in color. Has a slight kick to it, that I like. My first Smuttynose beer of a variety pack of 4 that I got from Jungle Jim's in Ohio, since it isn't available where I live. Has a slight coffee taste, but not too overpowering. Almost like a stout. Definitely worth trying for anyone who likes Porters."

"Overall: This may very well be my favorite porter that I've personally tried and one of my favorite beers in general. Even better than Founders Porter in my opinion. Right when you think the flavors have subsided, they keep coming with a fulfilling, lingering aftertaste. It demands your attention at relatively low abv. Considering that this is practically the cheapest craft beer by the case in my area (yes, even more so than Sierra Nevada or even Samuel Adams), it has been my go to beer this winter as I've bought a few cases. Porters are often too thin and lack flavor, but this, Founders, and Edmund Fitzgerald keep me coming back to the style, especially on a chilly night. Robust and world class indeed!"
""
""
""
"Very dark with slight foamy head that retreats quickly.  Smells of roasted malts and some caramel.  Taste is of caramel, toffee, slight coffee, hops, and some coffee.  Quite thick and really smooth.  Thoroughly enjoyed this porter and probably one of the best!"

"Overall - great beer. Enjoyed with a Turkey Rueben and some pub fries. Very nice."
"Overall: I've been to Smuttynose, the island off the coast of New Hampshire that serves as the brewer's namesake. It's a pleasant place to spend a quiet summer day; you can reach it by rowboat and watch what passes for civilization in New Hampshire's coastal islands fade into the distance. But I'd rather just have one of these beers. A terrific porter - I imagine one of the best domestic porters on the market. I paired it with a Field Roast sausage, spinach-and-potato pierogies and roasted broccoli. It was the star of the meal and imagine it would be the star of most meals."

"This porter isn’t easy to find outside of New Hampshire, but I recommend picking up a bottle or six if you can find them. It’s an amazing, full- bodied brew with complexity that doesn’t quit, balance that doesn’t deviate, and smoothness that doesn’t let you down. It’s a delicious beer that everyone should seek out and try."

"Not only Smuttynose's best, its the finest porter."

"Strongly recommend this as one of the best readily available Porters."
""

"Very interesting and complex porter. It's a great bit of fun to review this as there seems to be a good amount of things going on. It's not intense but it'll make you think about your palate a bit. The bitterness is the only thing that keeps it from disappearing as fast as it should, but it brings a new dimension to porters for me. Its certainly not the best robust porter in the New England area (Everett taking that spot) but there's no shame in that. I will definitely choose to buy this again when I want to mix it up from Edmund Fitzgerald and Black Butte."

"My wife got one of these in a sampler. I immediately returned to the distributor and bought a six."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Well, this is a good beer. If you see it, it is definitely worth trying. If you are looking for a more chewy than typical porter with a bit of a hop snap, you will love this. Otherwise, just try it for yourself anyway because it is worth it."

"Poured out a deep deep brown. Bug fizzy tan head has nice retention and leaves big lacing throughout the beer. Aroma is malty but not too heavy. Seems to be missing some oomf. Taste is pretty good. Nice roasted malt but not much complexity. Some alcohol sweetness is present. A little fizzy in the mouth. Overall it's a good but not great porter."
""
""
"A truly robust ale, with lots of interesting twists."
""
"Pours a very dark brown with a big creamy tan head. Abundant lacing as it travels down the glass. Aromas of light coffee. Taste begins with a bit of bittersweet chocolate, then some dark bread, then some earthy, woodiness in the finish. Smooth mouthfeel. Overall an excellent beer."
""
""

"Overall - A malt centerpiece porter, very well done at that. Beautiful in its simplicity. Simple recipe with great results. Definitely recommend."

"O: nice representation of the style, but not as complex as I'd like. Definitely worth trying"

"Pours black from the bottle with a creamy kahki head that sticks around. Aroma of coffee and chocolate, with lots of roasty malt. Very smooth mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Coffee and roastiness abound with a hint of chocolate. Hops come in but really fade into a creamy flavorful porter. Very nice beer."
""

"o - Overall a very good porter; just really solid all around. Looks great and a nice mouthfeel, full of roasted malts and dark, bitter chocolate throughout it. Would certainly have again and suggest to someone who likes porters."

"overall the best take ive had of a porter thus far...so much flavor that you want more and in this drinkable porter's case, u actually can"
""
""
"Smuttynose has really done a terrific porter here. My favorite of it's aspects is the light berry-like fruit. So many times dark fruits impart a heavier quality to a beer like this one but this is just buoyant on the palate. Balanced perfectly and drinks with a delightfully long aftertaste. Tremendous!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a lot more (hoppy-)bitter than I prefer, however, this may be the quintessential American porter - hop forward, aggressive, yet really clean, dry and super drinkable"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I am not a fan or porters and I don't like this one so that means it is great! Love smuttynose"
""
"A dense and well....robust porter that will grab your attention for sure. The coffee and roast character is bold and very fresh. Dense and intense keep coming to mind. The mouthfeel starts full and creamy then quickly trasnitions into a thin dry finish. This is what I was hoping Founders Breakfast stout would taste like. My first Smuttynose and it will not be the last."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good tasting. Just wonder why I couldn't get a head or smell."
""
""
""
""
"PS. Smuttynose, you need to put this beer in stronger case boxes."
"Taste is a perfect balance of roasty chocolate malts. I get a touch of burnt malts at the finish, but it's subtle. A top-tier porter!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very interesting and exciting porter that gets better and better as it warms up. Pour it cold and take your time. Have something on the side to cleanse your palate every few sips. Watching this beer open up as you drink brings quite a show."
"O: A very nice robust porter. I'm thankful that the fellas at Smuttynose didn't go crazy on the hops in this beer, as that would have ruined the wonderful malty aromas and flavors it presents so well. Highly recommended for fans of the style or for fans of traditional dark ales in general."
""
""
""
""
""

"Atmosphere is great. Foamy head, yet no lacing. Nose, however, is characteristic of the style but so well done. Flavor, again, is basic yet pristine. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"The taste is full of dark malts, more coffee grinds, and slight sweetness with a low to moderate bitterness at the end. This is how a Porter should be. I am glad Smuttynose is from my home state of New Hampshire."
""
""
""
"O: I truly enjoy roast flavors in my beer, so this one was perfectly in line with my tastes. It reminds me of one of my all-time favorite porters, Fuller’s London Porter, but with a more abrupt bitterness – needless to say, I loved it. Thank you Smuttynose for coming to Indiana!"

"o: this is really nice. smooth and robust (see what i did there). lots of well balanced flavor but not too huge. thumbs up"
""
""

"It's a good beer, I just hoped for the sweetness rather than bitterness. Has more of a stout feel. Mild alcohol is never really noticed. Easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It might just be that I don't like American Porters (judging by my extreme dislike of Sweet Baby Jesus), but I like Baltic Porters (Sixpoint's 3beans). It is just roasted malts with no complexity. Not a big fan I guess."
""
""
"Overall: Some fun and interesting stuff going on here--the bubbles, the stickiness, the raisin toast, the spicy florals...but taste is what matters most, and while dark malts should be prominent in a robust porter, I was expecting a little something else...something other than the astringency, that is. The puckering quality that came with the bitterness actually prevented me from appreciating the roasted grain, and may have masked some hidden flavors, the ones that seemed to settle on my lips, for example."
""
""
"Poured into nonic pint glass. Jet black with a thick brown head that fades after a bit, leaving tons of lacing. Smells dark and roasted, coffee and baking chocolate. Taste is nice smooth malt, a delicious roasted character with lots of coffee, and slight chocolate and caramel notes hiding in the finish. The finish is balanced with just a perfect hop presence to balance the roasted malts. Mouthfeel is medium-full, wet and slick with a perfect amount of creaminess. All alliterations aside, this is a perfect porter."

"Poured into a chalice. Pours a deep black with a thin tan head. No lace. Nose is roasted with whisps of chocolate powder and slight vanilla. Moderate body. A little high on the carbonation for my liking on this style, but it's not overbearing. Big roasted flavors, some charred toast, heavy on the dark malt, sweet finish of dark chocolate and almond. This beer lives up to its name as quite a robust beer. Big on flavor. One I will have again, no doubt."

"Robust Porter - apt name. As good as any I have tried. complex. save for your last beer of the evening, or with a cheese dessert course."
"This was only my second beer from Smuttynose, but given the quality of this porter, I can't wait to try more."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very easy, tasty beer. I could definitely have more than one of these at a time."
"This is a delicious porter that makes the style so appealing. So easy to drink and leaves you desiring for more. Nice, slightly burnt, roasted flavors, and a nice hardy mouthfeel. The type of beer that you could drink year 'round. If you're in the mood for a imperial stout but don't want the abv, this is a nice alternative. Smuttynose knows porters. (I should be paid for that. :))"
""
""
""
"A great porter - close to the best of its style."
"Great burnt maltiness there's a lot of roasted breadiness. Again, not as Robust as I had hoped, this brew is still delicious and smooth. Touches of chocolate mix with a bit of cracker in a dry feel."
""
""
"Overall this is a great example of the style, no wonder it's listed in the BJCP as an exemplar robust porter. This is not a classic English porter, definitely a bigger, American version of the style, but not a crazy imperial/chocolate/coffee etc. porter. Just a great robust porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For a porter, it is very good. Feels like a stout."
""
""
""
"O: Not much to say here, it's a great porter that I've been ignoring for far too long. As I said before, this bottle is at the perfect age for consumption."
"My favorite beers of this style are more stout-like. I find this one to be black IPA-like. There's lots of roastiness and hoppiness (as opposed to roastiness and sweetness) and I'm sure this will appeal to many others, but it's a bit overdone for my palate. It's a very nice beer, but I doubt I'll buy it again when Great Lakes and Founders offer porters that suit my palate much better."

"This pours a dark brown color with a slight, beige head. There is a fairly decent scent of coffee, black licorice, and caramel malts. The taste is heavy and complex. There are a lot of bold robust flavors mixed with some smoky hints. There are lots of roasted grains and sweet malts. Very well made for a porter!"

"O: I must admit that I don't usually love porters, but this is a great one. Not a lot of roasted taste which I appreciate, along with enough balance to keep it insanely drinkable. This is a great beer."

"OMG!!!! This stuff is amazing. It pours up a beautiful black with a luscious 2 finger head, excellent retention and lots of lacing rings. The smell is a fresh aromatic coffee note. Taste is a pleasing malt sweetness with a well balanced coffee and dark chocolate finish. Mouthfeel is amazing. I'm sad because they don't sell this in Alabama and I only bought one bottle in North Carolina,"

"One of my favorite porters. Porters are my favorite winter time beers and this is one of the best I have had. It is called a robust porter for a reason. The smell, taste and aroma are robust. I keep this one in my fridge at all times. If you can find this in your area, it's worth trying."

"I'm ashamed that I have never reviewed this on BA. I've had it both on-tap and in bottles multiple times. I've also used it in multiple batches of chili (it's a fantastic base). This is not the best American Porter I've ever had, but it is one of the best."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Wow, this is excellent stuff. Probably my second favorite American porter behind Founders. Definitely worth seeking out."
""
""
"one of my favorite porters going these days. it flows out of the bottle dense and nearly black, creating one dark pint of beer with several permanent inches of mocha colored head. the nose is powerful and awesome. fresh ground coffee, dark roasty barley, and a peppery ale yeast all come together to suggest that a sip of this is going to far exceed my expectations of what a porter is capable of, and indeed it does. i taste a lot of coffee up front, save the acidity, with milk chocolate notes and black licorice in small proportions. the finish is bitter from the burnt malt, almost ashy, really big and bold. not sure how well this beer fits the style i have come to know as porter, this is a definite envelope pushed and one of the most flavorful porters ive sampled. massive body and the right abv for what it is. the bottle says 5.7% though, so i am wondering if the recipe has changed? .5% seems like a large variance from batch to batch, but what do i know. overall this beer rocks, and it may just be the best thing smuttynose does."
"O- The only thing i'm disappointed in right now is that i took so long to sample this beer. I never thought Edmund Fitz would be overtaken as my go to porter, but it just was. IMO this is as good as it gets as far as American Porters go!"
""
""
"O: A great, very rich and complex porter. Lots of strong and bitter flavors. Delicious."
""
""
"Near-black brown. Dark tan head that dissolves completely. Legs are wrapped around the inside of the glass. Lactic feel. Full body. Heavy dark malts with to s of dark chocolate and a bit of coffee. Flavor reminds me of powdered mocha. Solar feel on the tongue as well."

"12oz bottle with a Best Before Date of 04/02/13. Pours a dark black color with dark brown hues and no head. Minimal lacing. Aromas of roasted malts, dark chocolate, earth, and some coffee. Great smokey roasted malt taste with dark chocolate and black coffee. Smokey dark chocolate taste at the end. Solid mix of roasted malts, coffee and dark chocolate flavors. Nicely balanced. Overall, great Porter by Smuttynose."
""

"Without a doubt one of the most amazing beers. Smuttynose never fails !!!! The color is incredible, the head was good and the lacing was excellent. We are sampling this beer as hurricane Sandy is hitting us outside of Philly and we don't care!! The fragrance as you drink this beer is as much the experience as the taste. Fantastic, Incredible, Amazing. Great job Smuttynose!!"

""

"Really great example of a porter, brings the big bold roasted flavors without hitting you over the head with imbalanced roasted malt or pushing it too far into the coffee/chocolate arena. Still shows love for its malt body, excellent brew."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A damn good porter, one of the best i've ever had."
""
""
""
"Bitterish roasted malts and coffee up front. Tannic and peaty. Smoky, charred roasted barley, cocoa nibs, and semi-sweet chocolate mix on the palate. Peaty, smoky, charred character increases into the finish that is dominated by coffee bitterness and dark chocolate. Medium body with a smooth, oily feel. Delicious and perfect for the coming cold."

"O: well, I think I'm becoming a fan of Smuttynose, period, after this one. After all I've tried by them, they are a very good company that makes very good beers. Of course, I would have this again."

""
"Well played Smuttynose, you have done well."

"I am on vacation in Vermont and I went into restaurant for dinner. Ordered a Smuttynose off tap and expected the regular Smuttynose I am used to off tap in my local New York watering hole. At first I had thought the waitress poured me the wrong drink but upon further enquiry I was delighted to be introduced to this fabulous Robust Porter. Simply amazing. The taste and smell is very comforting. I would love to drink this beer in the winter when I come back to Vermont to ski. I hope they keep it on tap."

"Half finger head on a very dark near jet black body. Very nice lacing. Aroma is nicely coffee filled though a touch mild with toasted malt. The flavor follows nicely with a more full coffee flavor with smokey undertones. Medium body and moderate carbonation. The flavor is very nice and full for a porter. The coffee stiffens this up and makes it more memorable."
""

"Huh. If Robust Porter is this good with over a month beyond it's ""best by"" date, I'm curious to see how much ""better"" it is fresh. Haha."

"I think it's a great beer."
""

"O - This is a great robust porter that would be a perfect companion on cold winter nights. The roast character adds an extra taste dimension compared to regular porters, but it doesn't have the harshness that can sometimes result."
"Good stuff. Really hits the spot."

"This is a top notch American Porter. Porter, especially robust porter, being one of my favorite styles, I could drink this beer anytime, anywhere, and I will certainly buy it sometime. My friend gave me this bottle, so I thank him for that."
""
"O: Great flavors, awesome porter. Very complex, different flavors for a sub 6%abv brew. Big flavors, definitely some hops in their which is nice. Similar flavor profile to their Baltic Porter. A must try for porter/stout lovers. One of the best at its price point."
""
""
""
"Came out of a Smuttynose sampler pack. Deep black pour with ruby hue, smell of coffee, caramel, and nuts. Flavor was roasted coffee bean, sweet caramel, and just hit of nuts. A tad bit of bitterness at the end to round it out. A really nice porter. Would definitely buy again."

"O - Very well made porter that I would put up with my favorites. Nice I had easier access to this one."
""
""
""
""
"Excellent American porter."
""
""
"O: An OK porter, but not top of the class in my opinion. The malt is too sweet, and the hops too phenolic and astringent to be a great example of the style. I'll pass in favor of one of several better porters next time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mucho gusto robusto. ...I'm sure that made sense somehow, right...? Anyway, this stuff pours a deep black-brown topped by a finger or so of sienna foam. The nose comprises plenty o' roasted malts, chocolate, light molasses, and a touch of toasted caramel. Robust, indeed. The taste focuses on the roast, as well as a decent amount of coffee. It's all a bit acridly bitter, but not enough to make it come across negatively. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a more-than-solid porter, one that definitely lives up to the title of ""robust""."
""
"Notes: Tasted on 1/21/2012, freshness date on bottle reads May 2012."

""
"This is really a solid porter. It's thick, heavy, robust, and flavorful. I really enjoyed it."

"the darkness has consume me , as i journey down this road frist taste and the way it goes down wonderful always wanted to taste this and glad i did too bad snow coming and i gotta drive to work tommorow but its about i found a porter worth drinking been in a slump,too bad afterfrist night this is pretty bad"
""
"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a very dark brown coloring with ruby highlights around the edging, with a low profile, sparse, foamy, milk chocolate colored head. Aromas of dark roasted coffee and cocoa nib, with dark fruit sweetness that is subtle in its presence. Flavors are well blended on a dry, robust body. Plum sweet in the background of the bitter, dry roasted coffee characteristics. A kick of dark chocolate shows up on the palate here and there, keeping the flavors dynamic. The beer hangs on the glass as you drink, and the aftertaste is a deliciously bitter, solid chocolate and coffee flavor. The finish has a slight linger, which transitions into a dry, almost astringent finish that cleans the palate, leaving a fresh feel to dive back in for more. Very tasty Porter...well put together from beginning to end."
""
"Overall-This porter came in a variety pack of Smuttynose that I had bought for a tailgate, I really like their IPA and find it pleasant. I did not end up drinking this at the tailgate but consumed much later. I have to say I was not expecting much of this beer for some reason, but it was very solid. If I was in the mood for a porter I would reach for this again."
""
""
"O: Fantastic head and mouthfeel. This and the Stone Smoked Porter are both excellent American porters. I would call it a tie."
""
"Medium body with lively prickly carbonation."
""
"Pours a very dark brown, huge tan head to it. Smell is of chocolate and coffee. Taste is medium to full bodied, great complexity and flavors going on. Great coffee and chocolate tastes come through, with a nice backing of hops to make an overall smooth beer. Absolutely delicious and one of the better porters I've tried."
"o - overall, smuttynose always impresses. the robust porter is no exception. the chocolate and coffee flavors are well balanced with some good roast and char. well done porter."
""
""
"Beer is medium in body and pretty flawless. A nice beer / porter all around. Smooth on the palate, sweetness and a mild bitterness at the end connect well with a nice finish. A good always available standby beer."

"O - I don't reach for many porters. But, this has turned me on the style of beer. A very well done porter where everything it does seems to compliment itself."

"O: I really enjoy this beer. The smell and tastes are well above average and it has the perfect amount of alcohol."

"Absolutely phenomenal. This is just an example of how to do something simple, but to perfection. This isn't high grav, this isn't aged in oak, this isn't brewed with coffee, this is just beer and it is every bit as exciting and flavorful as anything. Hats off to the Smutty Robust Porter."

""
"O - Great porter that I'd recommend to anyone."
"An excellent porter. One of my favorites in the US. Pretty much perfect for the style. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A full bodied porter that starts with a dark fruit on the pallet followed by heavy notes of coffee and dry dark chocolate that lingers. Has a thin head the quickly disappears to nothing, the beer is pitch black and robust. A bigger hop profile than more porters."
""
""
""
"It has a nice, well roasted robustness about it. It looks good in the glass and has a nice aroma. I think it will sweeten up as it warms. Overall, a porter I would buy again if I was in the mood for a nice porter that isn't over the top."
""
"Very nice porter, but I would have preferred less earthy hops."
""
""
""
""
"O - A big, earthy, roasty porter. Quite nice. Robust indeed."
""
""
""
"O: I love the engineering of this beer; its body and mouthfeel are fantastic. Unfortunately, the particular take on this style isn't quite to my liking, and I find myself gravitating toward other beers."
""
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Solid black pour with a 2 finger light tan head. Adequate lacing throughout. Smell is strong notes of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate. More in line with a stout than a porter. Taste is much like the nose, but very smooth and full bodied. A great balance of dark roasted malts and a low end hop finish. Strength of flavors grow with warmth. Coffee and molasses stick out for me. Feel is rich and silky. Adequate carbonation with a somewhat thick feel. Overall- A very solid porter/stout. It seems to fall more in line with a stout than a porter. I enjoyed the roasted malts and coffee influence with mild hops. It's not outstanding, but a very drinkable beer and will find another soon-"
"Overall- After full consideration, this turned into a hoppier porter with a nice chocolate profile. I wish it was more creamy than dry on the palate, and will keep hoping that this one is sweeter than what it is on my next attempt."
""
""
"A seasonal ""elixir of the gods"". Thank you, Smuttynose."
""
""
""
""
"O-This is potentially the best porter I've ever had. Smooth drinking, great taste. An all around great drinking beer."

"This is everything a Porter should be"
"O: Not a bad porter, cracked the Top 10 list in Porters, but with most Porters it must be had in Cask form to really appreciated the burnt cask/ heavy french roast, dark cocoa that porters can deliver. Best served when slightly cold, when too chilled it draws away from flavor and aromatics."
"OUTSTANDING, MUST TRY!"
"overall, complex, and lots of flavor for a ""smaller"" beer."
"O - Another amazing offering from a fantastic brewery. Rich, thick, and lingering, this beer is not for your average beer drinker. But for those who like the dark stuff, this is one of the best in the category."
"The mouthfeel is fluffy and bold with flavors of burnt semi-sweet malts holding the piece together -dark roasted coffee beans and dark unsweetened chocolates, mild peppery tingle. What you'd expect, but very well put together and balanced. Feel is balanced and gentle all the way through to the finish. Love the very soft-spoken but present hops. This is how you do it, boys. I love that I can get 6-packs of this anywhere for 8 bucks or so. Thanks, Smuttynose for keeping in real for so long!"
"The first I really notice in the taste is how it feels. It feels slick and soapy, with strong notes of coffee. Also feels crisp, which is actually really helpful; it could be a very slick, sweet beer."
"This beer, in my opinion, is the absolute benchmark for a porter. Really pronounced flavor in such a small ABV package. If someone were to have me recommend them a porter, I would only have two words: Robust Porter."
"O-A great all around porter, the only draw back was the flatish finish. A tad bit more hops and this beer would be wonderful."
"O: Great Robust Porter! This brew was complex with lots of aromas and flavors."
"Medium high carbonation; moderately dry without too long or lingering of an aftertaste. Very tasty and easy to drink; perhaps just a tad shy of the creamy mouthfeel I most want in the style. Very good, overall. Aroma may be the best aspect of this beer."
"Overall - This beer has its joys in the nose and taste. It is really a great beer for how much it costs and the abv. I would say seek it out but since it is readily available all i can say is buy a six pack and enjoy. a perfect winter session beer."
"O - Nice porter and everything I expect to get from a self-dubbed robust porter. I'd get it again."
"Taste simplifies things a little bit, although it is by no means a one-dimensional beer. Sweet, roasty malt has a touch of caramel and a nice hop backing that compliments, rather than opposing the roasted malt. The line that this beer walks between sweet bitterness is truly amazing and an incredible brewing feat. This is a quintessential American porter and is one of the best of the style I have had in at least a couple years. I love it when a beer under 6% gives you that 'WOW' feeling. This one did it for me. Hats off to you Smutty."
"Morey's Bottom Line: This may be my 2nd favorite Porter to date, with Founders holding the top spot. I like Edmund Fitz, but I got give the runner up to Smutty."
"O - A pretty good brew, nothing spectacular. Can't wait for the Pumpkin to see how Smutty can fully use the ingredients to their full potential, cause I just don't see it in this porter. Try it out regardless, along with Firestones. Cheers!"
"O: Robust and very enjoyable. Excellent change of pace, kick back, relax and savor."
"O - Overall, I really like this. Might be a little heavy to down a few in a night, but the taste is well balanced, and it doesn’t just stick to the aroma, it mixes things up. Not too sweet either."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Body is actually pretty heavy, between medium and full. Nice fine carbonation contributes to a nearly creamy mouthfeel. Nice. Overall, I enjoyed this. Unfortunately I'm a bit biased towards porters with more roast/coffee/chocolate than I am towards hoppier porters, and my score will reflect that. But this is an excellent porter that I would definitely have again."
"This is my first review, but from the few porters I have had this is the best. Will revisit this review after I have tried a bigger variety."
"A very nice example of the style featuring great toasted malt notes and pleasant aromas all of which are very appropriate."
"A classic, simple, and roasty porter."
"Overall - A fantastic smooth, creamy porter with a bite!"
"Overall: One of the most balanced porters I've ever had to date. It's futile to write a review for this thing - the beer speaks (or drinks) for itself here."
"O - Simply an outstanding porter."
"Overall - Decent, kinda mellow and watery, but, this is perhaps from this past winter, so this bottle might have 8-9 months on it. Lacks overall flavor like coffee and sugars. Too weak for me, but a good gateway for a rookie porter drinker."
"O: All in all, this is a fantastic porter! Packs so much flavor in such a light ABV brew. If you're looking for a great example of the American Porter style, this is it."
"O: A very enjoyable porter. The combo of the smell, taste, and mouthfeel add up to a great beer. Would definitely enjoy this one again."
"Another review thats too many characters short! This ones good for listening to the Beatles!"
"Seriously well done."
"O/D-Smuttynose aces the porter here. Easy drinking. Flavor is smooth and enticing. I am excited to get my hands on their Baltic Porter. I am liking the style more and more."
"Black with about a centimeter of beige head that dissipates quickly to patches of bubbles and a ring around the edge of the tulip glass. Smells of roasted malt, caramel, a touch of vanilla, and some dark fruits (raisin especially). Tastes of roasted, nearly charred malts caramel, coffee, a touch of chocolate, and perhaps some cane sugar; very nice. Mouthfeel is very smooth, with perfect carbonation. Overall, a very good porter that I am grateful to have had the opportunity to try."
"O: Pretty good. Some work on the body and retention would make this a killer, world class porter, IMO. As it sits, Edmund is still my favorite. This one is probably second, but it's still a good ways off."
"Overall: Probably my second favorite overall stout and I wish I could find it in Texas, I guess I’ll have to load up next trip to New Hampshire."
"It's a lovely brew, just gorgeous. Certainly one of the best porters I've had, and what's more, it's relatively light; almost sessionable. Just a brilliant brew. Certainly one of the most flavoursome beers I've had at this strength."
"O - This has great drinkability. I could easily drink a few of these through out an evening. It has a nice roasted quality to it. Overall, I think this is a really good porter, and I would definitely buy it again."
"Color is nearly black with some reddish-brown around the edges. A light brown head fades quicker than expected, but leaves a good amount of lacing. Coffee scents are prominent, with a floral hint. The taste is mainly malts of coffee and caramel, with a piney hop bitterness trying to push through in the finish. Hops seem to come through more as it warms, but malts remain in the forefront. Really nice mouthfeel. A good and solid porter."
"I really love this beer. Fantastic."
"Big thanks to Sammy for getting this one for me. Great stuff."
"The Robust Porter pours a dark black abyss in your glass with amber highlights where it meets with the light brown head. One smells strongly roasted malt with subtle fruity undertones. The mouthfeel is thoroughly creamy with a dry finish. The taste follows a smoky path through dark malts and bitter chocolate."
"Final Thoughts: A great example of the style, could be a top favorite of the style for me. Smuttynose seems to do a good job of making good examples of styles. It always seems like my glass is well laced after a Smutty as well."
"Dark mahogany brown with red highlights in the Scotch Ale glass. Handsome brownish head. More bitter, more like a stout. Quite rich and flavorful. Nice rasp of burnt malt, though fairly mellow. Only a touch of sweetness among all the roasted malt. Nutty, like walnuts with the bitter skins. Serious hoppiness turns up the more you sip, and gives a long bitter aftertaste, probably enhanced by the black malt. More austere and less sweet than many porters."
"I've never tried this beer before now (for whatever reason). I think I've found my go-to porter."
"A great brew for sure. Really really flavorful and easy to drink"
"Quite good except for the intense sourness."
"One of the best porters I have come across. Awesome balance of hops with the sweetness from the roasted malt. Not too much alcohol and very easy to drink. Great Beer!"
"Overall this is a very , very nice porter, enjoyed on a nice cool June evening. Great job."
"Overall-Porters aren't my favorite style but this one is very nice. I hate Stones Smoked Porter and had a feeling this would be similar but this is more balanced and drinkable. Good beer."
"http://www.facebook.com/KAJIIsBeerReviews"
"O: Solid porter, quite drinkable and refreshing, even when its a week from July."
"medium bodied, enjoyable, roasty beer."
"I got this as an extra so long I go I can't remember who gae it to me, but it's quite nice."
"Overall, a nice brew."
"O - This is definitely the best porter I've had and another good beer from Smuttynose. Good beer from a good brewery."
"O- Overall this is towards the top of my porter list. Not as good as Edmund Fitz but still very solid. Even better is how widely available this is just like Edmund- I always have 2 top notch porters at my local grocery store (well, when in Ohio now). I always enjoy this beer, and though it isn't as smooth as some porters, it can really hold its own against some great stouts out there as well with the more pronounced roast, so its the best of both worlds depending on mood sometimes..."
"This beer poured out as a rich deep brown color, mostly black. The head was a light tan color. The smell of the beer had a very nice roasted aroma to it, and a touch of sweetness on the nose too. The taste had a burnt flavor to it, very enjoyable when mixed with the sweet malts. The mouthfeel os the beer isn't super heavy even though the color is dark. overall it's a pretty nice porter and worth a try."
"O- probably my favorite porter, just a really solid beer from a great brewery."
"O-Really well balanced beer. Easy to drink and well made. Would drink again anytime."
"OVERALL: A great example of what a porter can be. This one came off way bigger than it is, and shows once again that you don’t need a big ABV to pack huge flavor into your beer. Definitely memorable for the style. Give it a chance if it’s available in your area. Recommended."
"Overall – As stated, I’m always on the lookout for a good porter, and I am going to be trading for some of this in the near future so I can have plenty during the winter months. This was just a great beer and a fantastic surprise. Glad I was able to try it."
"I have one left to log and it was already consumed. I just need to dig out my notes for a very nice beer. I love this BIF"
"The Robust Porter from Smuttynose was very good! The color was a real dark, very deep amber. The beer had a thin wite head. The aroma was bolstered by a roasty/coffee scents. The flavor was also very good...dominated by very good caramel, coffee/espresso, oily taste. A roastiness polishes the beer off the pallet then dissapates quite nice. Theis porter is very easy on the mouth could have multiple of these!"
"Overall - Not bad stuff. I would give it another go. Some surprises throughout the glass which should have been much of a surprise in the first place. I mean, it is called ""Robust Porter""."
"Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side but nicely carbonated."
"Cheers!"
"Dirtybeerguy.com"
"O - Coffee seems to dominate this brew. I find myself wishing there was less coffee going on in this one so that some of its more subtle features could shine."
"This is a good porter, but it's rough around the edges. It has some good components, but they don't blend together as well as they could. It feels like a jagged surface, where my favorites are like a smooth path over rolling hills."
"Overall: Really nice beer that I should buy more often. I've never been a huge Smuttynose fan, but this is a great beer. No question about it."
"Overall-I love porters and this one is pretty good."
"Pretty good porter here....one for people who don't want a porter to hold back and want chocolate notes, that's for sure."
"Overall this is a very solid porter. Robust indeed! The IPA WAS my favorite Smuttynose beer until I tried this."
"just like i remembered, has that nice roasted edge to it, like a proper porter should, and honestly for not having coffee added this bears a strong resemblance to a coffee profile, and actually has a better coffee profile then alot of coffee stouts, imagine that. lesser notes of powdered coco and artificial vanilla."
"D - Very drinkable. Flavors are really nicely balanced and mix together. The roasted flavor is really nice throughout. Finish is full of flavor and really nice."
" Overall this is one of my staples ,I love this Porter one of the best I've had up there with Founders and Eddie fitz.I think this is a great beer that flies under the hype radar.A must try."
"This porter is very dark with a small head which recedes to a thin film which remains. Not much lacing. The aroma is of dark chocolate and a bit of coffee. Really great bitter chocolate mocha coffee flavor. Good mouthfeel. Smooth, medium bodied, and very drinkable for such a robust (heh heh) beer."
"D: Very smooth, pretty easy to come by and not overpowering in flavor -- really easy to drink."
"Drinkable without a big hit of alcohol."
"Overall, this is a classic American Porter that I could easily drink on a nightly basis. A very well-rounded brew."
"The mouthfeel is a bit too thick though, I don't think the beer is strongly flavored enough for the thickness and fullness on the tongue. The drinkability is rather good. Overall, this is a solid porter that's quite enjoyable. Recommended."
"Overall, pretty darn good. THe lack of a smell confuses me, but I only have 1 bottle so I won't be able to compare, but it's pretty damn good."
"Overall - A very fine porter. I think this one is just a step under Edmund Fitzgerald, especially on the nose and in the mouth, but a very, very good porter. Cheers!"
"O - One of the best. I could drink it any day. Up there with Founders and Great Lakes, but in a different way."
"Taste bitter dark roast coffee, slight sweet caramel, then it unloads a citrus hop pow. Wow wasn't expecting that from a porter but it is very nice and full. Reminds me of Sierra Nevada Stout in its fullness. An excellent beer."
"This beer is up there with the Founders Porter. Very very good."
"This porter is suitably named as it accurately describes how all five sense perceive it. Pours thick and black with a nice light brown head. Gives off aromas of roasted malts and subtle chocolate. The taste is a great balance of sweetness, roasted malt, light hop presence, all tied together with a creamy mouthfeel. Great beer, can't wait to find sixers."
"drinkable - very."
"Worth a shot? Eh. If somebody gives it to you (which in my case, is the case) sip away. Seen on the store shelf...Grab something else."
"Pours almost black - super, dark brown. I get anise at first with the nose, as well as medium-roasted coffee, and milk chocolate. Taste definitely repeats that, chocolatey and smooth, sorta sweet.. Feel is not as dry as expected, but there is some pepper and spice with the finish. For the alcohol %, this beer drinks way bigger, and that works in its favor. Very nice brew that I'd love to pair with a nice piece of meat."
"Very sessionable, and full of flavor. I would love to have this beer on tap at my local haunt."
"black with a beige head, significant lacing upon the cylinder. Looks swell. Bitter chocolate, coffee, roast, some vanilla all up on the nose. Pretty nice aroma. Flavor is solid, for some reason the first bottle I had seemed like it was too roasty and coffee but this one seems more well-balanced, playing off the sweeter malt backbone effortlessly. It's pretty good, something in the middle isn't quite doing it for me, seems like a roasty hop thing that's just slightly out of whack. Nonetheless, a very solid porter."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - A very light bodied porter. There is almost a sort of crispness to it. The ethanol is very well hidden despite what the smell suggested to me. Absolutely delicious and addictive to either sip or gulp down. I could easily drink these one after another."
"The flavor hits pretty hard and offers up quite a bit of goodness. The chocolate and roast blend beautifully along with some lingering dryness and bitterness. Light amounts of espresso and molasses in the finish. Quite nice and doesn't really present any alcohol. There is a lingering bit of strange dryness in the long finish; almost cardboard-like, but I wouldn't call it oxidized. Medium-to-full body with moderate carbonation. Really quite nice and one of the better porters that I've had in quite sometime."
"Drinks very well, a really nice porter."
"D: goes down easily even with the light bitterness. Overall one of the best porters out there."
"D - I could drink these all day. absolutely delicious. probably the best porter I've had in a long time, maybe ever."
"Drink - Just a fantastic beer that would be ideal for a session. I'm really happy I tried it and would rank it up there with the Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter. Worth seeking out."
"I could have a lot of this! I would have more but this bar is amazing and must try more of their beer!"
"D - Very high. Pour me another! I will be purchasing this excellent porter again."
"A good example of an above average porter in my opinion."
"Nice mouthfeel, very drinkable. Very thick but goes down smooth. I could drink a lot of these probably for the price but they are very rich and a little thick. Overall a quality porter that is easily accessible."
"D - Good drinkability, but it's a bit thin."
"Notes: Definitely better served on draught but not bad out of the bottle. A rarity, for sure."
"D=Easily downed, light body and good taste"
"Pours black with a decent light-brown head. Nice smoky aroma. Flavor is Smoky Roasted Malt! Appearance is nice with a lot of lacing. While not as thick & heavy as a Stout, it is closer to a stout than a porter. It seems a little hop on the finish, nice balance. Very good Porter. Smuttynose is really starting to impress me."
"Overall - A very well balanced porter... definitely recommended..."
"Pours a very dark brown with a few inches of tan bubbly head. As it dissipates, very little lacing is left behind. The nose offers less than I had expected but shows signs of coffee and bitter cocoa. The taste offers much more. Roasty malts with plenty of robust coffee and bitter cocoa nibs. The mouthfeel is creamy wiyh a good amount of carbination. This one could be drank all day. Pretty delishious."
"Overall a very solid coffee porter, this was a favorite of the night for me for sure, I would not mind having this one again any day!"
"The taste is robust, it starts with a frothy carbonation. The roasted barley/coffee taste is very smooth and velvety. It has a slight almost alcohol finish. Very nice the name fit it"
"D - A ton of flavor for a lower ABV beer; thoroughly enjoyable. I'll be adding this one to my list of beers to keep around in the fridge"
"This is a delicious porter, and the near-perfect taste profile makes it a highly drinkable beer. Perfect session beer in my opinion. A solid offering from Smuttynose. This is a 'must-try' for every porter lover. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Not too filling. Very smooth, for a porter. This is the first porter/stout style beer that I've really enjoyed, and I see it helping me expand my interests in those styles."
"D: This is one of the more complex-yet-subtle porters I've tried. It is right up there with Founders Porter."
"Pours a creamy one and a half finger milk chocolate head. Black body no light getting through. Smells of sweet malts, Carmel, bubble gum, breach yeast. Tastes sweet and malty, coffee, milk chocolate, some roasty notes as well. Full bodied, light carbing. quite drinkable. $1.75 a single."
"Robust Porter is a good beer, definitely worth a try."
"Very dark, opaque porter with a nice tan head and lacing, this smells like hopped-up-coffee (mmm, just the idea is nice) and has the taste to back it up. The mouthfeel is smooth, with a medium body and very fine carbonation, but I'm marking it a bit down on taste because overall I didn't find it as complex as I was hoping--the bitter, coffee-like element is so strong that it crowds out other flavors, which include a touch of cocoa, a sniff of sour fruitiness, and a bit of pine/grapefruit hop."
"This is a full flavored, easy drinking porter, it is well balanced between sweet and bitter."
"Solid beer. I look forward to trying more from Smuttynose."
"I've waited to review this beer as it as one of the original porters had ever tried. So a year later comes this review and I have to say this porter is still one of the best that I've had. The roast flavors are fantastic and the backing malt flavors round out the beer nicely. Can't go wrong with a Smuttyy."
"D- Sessionable porter thats full of taste a solid porter and another all around solid offering from Smuttynose."
"Very drinkable, love the flavors and mouthfeel is well done."
"One of my favorite standard beers from any brewery in America. And one of the few where the bottle version is nearly as perfect as the draft."
"This is a very surprising beer for me to drink but very different from most porters I've had due to what appears to be a big hop rush going into IPA territory. Very similar but not as bold as the Smuttynose IPA as well. Interesting..."
"Light carbonation makes it very drinkable."
"D- very drinkable. Tasty and easy to drink"
"A nice one beer drink."
"Pass on this one. Especially when there are so many good Porters readily available."
"D: Would love another of these; a few would go great with a meal, so long as the meal could stand up to it."
"Nice head (ok lacing). Slight bitterness on the nose. Deep, rich, slightly sweet, more dark chocolate than coffee flavors. Crisp on the front end, slight sweet fruitiness (berries?), but lingering richness. My new favorite porter (don't tell Glenn)."
"Pours a hazy dark brown with one finger dense light brown head, settles to a thin cap leaving rings of fine lace. Smell: leafy, earthy hops, big roasted grain with a whiff of 'dark' toast, lots of sweet caramel and a little chocolate beneath. Taste: citric and earthy hopping upfront, unsweet chocolate bookends around an astringent roasted character. Lightish medium body with a dry finish, fleeting experience as the carbonation comes in late and leaves early. Good, not great. Best by 4/11."
"D - It's a solid session porter that unfortunately can't back up the promising look and aroma. If there were few options I'd certainly have this one again, but I prefer Edmund Fitzgerald and it's about the same price."
"Drinkability -- Truth in advertising. I've really been enjoying Smuttynose since it came into the Chicago area a few months ago. This has been the best of all. Rich and roasty, and pretty damn complex for a beer with an abv south of 6%. Can't believe this isn't in the top 5 of the style. Keep the hits coming, Smutty!"
"D - A nice beer. Not sure I've seen this on the shelves anywhere but I'd definitely keep it in mind as something to grab in the future."
"D: A solid porter overall, but I was not as blown away as I expected to be. Tasty, but definitely better porters out there."
"Overall: I prefer a good stout to most porters but have some affection for them as my first homebrew attempt was a nicely drinkable porter. This porter was quite nice and I will certainly look for it when on sale at my local shop."
"Taste is good, and a little different than the standard porter. First note is smokiness with a ton of malt, but the close has a slight bit of hops. Flavor has a tinge of molasses and sugar, but has a strong oak character. Medium body, and a nice drinkable porter for a cold night, or with a heavy meal."
"Drinkability- as good as a porter can be. Very solid ""today sucked beer"""
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and packs in a big amount of flavor. The low alcohol content makes this beer sessionable."
"D: this is a very dry and smoky porter, and very tasty."
"Drink-ability is rather good but I kind of prefer the big series porter since it has more ABV and more cocoa chocolate tones. This one came off more coffee and burnt like but still a great example of the style."
"Drinkability: Its alcohol content is very well-hidden by the complexity of the flavor, and this alone makes it a very drinkable beer. The alcohol kind of creeps up on you, but this is a beer that you could drink at least two of in the winter months with no problem. A fantastic beer, glad I grabbed it while I could."
"Very Drinkable American Porter, one of the best that I've had in awhile. Not one of the flavors overpowers the other."
"Overall... Reminds me of Deschutes Black Butte Porter with a hoppy finish, an interesting little something extra at the end, but enjoyable. I still prefer Black Butte, but this beer is still a solid porter!"
"D-A very solid, easy drinking, and very flavorful beer. I will definitely stock this one on the fridge in the future."
"D/O- An extremely drinkable porter at 5.7%abv. A delight to be a part of my Christmas beer drinking lineup. A top tier porter with the likes of Founders, Great Lakes, and Three Floyds. Smuttynose is now 3 for 3 in my book...running out of available beers of theirs to try."
"Really good, and not far from excellent."
"A surprisingly flavorful porter. Flavor is rich, but there is enough sweetness that this couldn't be confused with a stout. A really well done porter."
"Nicely drinkable hoppy style burnt porter, I like it."
"D: Good drinkability. Robust as it says on the label. Great winter anytime beer. Too bad I have to go to Wisconsin to get this."
"Poured a dark brown in color with brown highlights on the edges with a thin head and left a little lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was really roasty with chocolate coffee notes and slight vanilla bean notes lurking in the background. It actually was more chocolatey on the palate with good roasty character but had coffee and vanilla bean accents. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, roasty, and creamy finish. It drank really good and was a solid porter. Would definitely take another stab at this beer."
"Pours out a blackish color with tan head with nice retention...looks quite inviting. Nice lacing after I take some sips. Smells of dark chocolate, some coffee, liquorice, roasted malts....when I take a good close whiff. Smell is nice but you have to get up close to take it all in. The taste is more dark chocolate with some bitter hop, overall a nice balance and not too sweet which I don't love. Quite complex tasting and a nice interplay between the bitter dark malts, the bite from the hops and slightly sweet roastyness. This is a great beer, reminds me an awful lot though of Edmund Fitgerald, which is a good thing, but if I had to review Smuttynose for originality they would lose some points. Everything they make reminds me of something else. But still nice to have around as an option, at least if the original is out of stock or stale. I do appreciate the fact that their beer is date coded, hats off for that taking that extra step and potentially losing sales for the sake of freshness and quality. That is huge to me for a brewer. And oh yes, these are very drinkable but I swear they are stronger than they say cause I got quite a headache last weekend from overindulgence ;-)"
"Edit: I had a bottle on Aug 8, 2011 that seemed a little hoppier and really showcased the chocolate malt in the aroma. The aroma was quite strong. Very good!"
"D-High (for a porter) probably a good thing that I only had one at poker (for my chipstack)"
"D: The beer is pretty good, but a little on the bitter and thin side. I can get past it though, and I liked this one a fair amount."
"Medium brown head was less than a finger, and the lace was broken and somewhat clingy. Color is a 40 on the SRM beer color chart. Very very dark brown and that can only be seen in direct sunlight. Smell in intense and has aromas of coffee, chocolate, dried prunes, and sweet malt. Flavor is also intense, with tastes of dark chocolate, dark roasted coffee, prunes, caramel, peanuts, and malt. Mouthfeel is that of heavy cream. Wouldn't want to drink too many of these at one session, but this beer is very flavorful and one I will drink again."
"Pours a dark brown/black with a tan head.  Smells are roasted malts, some smokiness, and a touch of cocoa.  I taste roasty malts, a little smokey malt and a nice coffee finish with some chocolate.  Medium mouthfeel, same as drinkability, medium."
"drinkability - tons of flavor for such a low abv beer - and when i say low abv i mean under 8% and this one clocks in @5+"
"Overall, this beer was average or below average. I found myself drinking these sparingly and feeling the same way every time. I will venture off to another brewery for my porters."
"D - Drinks heavier than it's abv (this is only 5.7?!)...ok as a sipper, but personally doesn't take me too long to get to the bottom and ready for another one."
"Good not great."
"D - Delicious porter. Exceptionally well made, especially in how all the various flavors present themselves individually and then meld together in a long, lingering finish. I'd prefer slightly less roasting in the malt and a bit of caramel and/or toffee to sand down a bit of the bitterness, but if this had that, it would be fiver. I can see an evening of alternating between this and Anchor Porter to get the best of both. I might even try blending them. In any case, I'm going to need a couple of six-paks to thoroughly investigate this beer."
"D- This was a interesting porter. One of the best I have had in a little while. Smuttynose does a good job I think and I look forward to trying more of their offerings. ABV is light enough that a sixer of this should be no problem to drink."
"As you can tell, this is one of my favorite porters. I also give it some props for having a cool label."
"D- like the name says, this is a robust porter. easy to finish and im left looking for another one. very enjoyable. i appreciate that the strength and bottle size allows me to have another one without having to worry about how im going to get home."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of roasted malts, some hops. Taste is a little disappointing, strong bitter coffee, some hops, roasted malt flavor is very weak. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a pretty good beer, but considering the other reviews I was expecting more."
"D: i'd never guess this was a porter-it drank like a stout, a stout which brought bigger flavors and aromas than the abv suggests. well-done."
"This is a great go-to local Porter that has the robust flavor of an imperial. Another solid Smuttynose offering."
"D: Very drinkable porter overall, just sort of run of the mill in many ways to me."
"Moderate carbonation with a very pleasant finish, leaving your mouth ready for another. At 5.7%, this one will definitely replace a higher ABV stout without sacrificing the flavor. Awesome."
"Tastes strong for an under 6. I could drink this all night. One of the best Porters I've ever had."
"This beer pours a darkness black brown color with a beige frothy head that laces nicely. The smell is nicely of smoke, cocoa, chocolate, and currant. The flavor is mostly of the smoke and roasted barley. The flavors aren't much stronger than that, but they are still present. The mouthfeel is fairly apt, but nothing outstanding. It's a good drinking beer, I'm rating it highly, but I wish I had more to discuss about this good beer which I am recommending to many."
"D - Delicious and toasty. I could drink these all winter long."
"Don't ""agressive pour"" this...it will spend it's energy on a huge head...unlike a lot of Porters that won't get 1 finger if you pour from a ladder. Also...being on the Unsweet side anyhow,don't expect this to do well cold."
"D- RB is a great beer from smutty. It is very enjoyable and the flavor keeps it very drinkable"
"D - Very good. My first Smuttynose and based off this great beer I'll be trying to find some more."
"Overall, this has got to be one of my favorite American Porters. A great go-to beer packed with flavor but easy to drink."
"It was quite drinkable and I could have gone for a few more pints but alas I had to drive back to Boston."
"The nose is a bit more subtle. Nice gentle notes of coffee and malt, followed by hints of chocolate. The taste experience follows the nose up nicely. A strong bitter cocoa flavor gives way to light coffee. While the mouthfeel starts off a bit crisp with good carbonation, it goes to take on a creamy and full texture towards the back of the palate. This one really sticks in the mouth with its long finishing chocolate-chasing hop-effect. Thanks Smuttynose!"
"It has a great chocolatey, strong flavor and really fills your mouth with its good thick porter strength. Absolutely fantastic. I would recommend this beer to anyone who has either had a bad experience with porters or hasn't had one before."
"M/D: Smooth and creamy with slight carbonation. Pretty drinkable, one of the better offerings from Smuttynose I have had thus far."
"This beer was delicious. Tend to drink porters when it gets cold and grim and this hit the spot. Could sit in a romote cabin watch the cold rainy countryside and drink these all day. So good."
"Would definitely recommend this one and this one will be a great part of the rotation. Again Wow!"
"Notes: Shapow! This is an excellent beer and a personal favorite of mine. It is very well balanced and extremely flavorful. It is perhaps the most stout-like porter I have ever had, but that's not a bad thing."
"12oz bottle into my Orval glass...Dark brown pout, light tan head rises only about a finger, light retention ok lacing...A very ""robust"" aroma that gives off ton of strong coffee. Its not too much, the coffee smell is just right, but it is a little plain, not much going on but a very wonderful smelling coffee...The taste is much of the same, a really nice coffee throughout not complex. Big drag is the feel, its really light, but makes for a super drinkaable porter."
"A very fine brew, (almost) as always from Smuttynose."
"M- One of the most full bodied American Porters Ive had. Its very smooth and silky."
"Black in body topped by coffee head. Sweet smell of milk chocolate, hops, whipped cream. Tastes of milk chocolate, cream, slight bitterness toward the finish, raisins, some tang as well. Smooth heavy-bodied beer with some milk characteristics. A porter with some sweetness but not as a main characteristic."
"A great American porter that could give Edmund Fitzgerald a run for its money. Smuttynose is definitely in the top tier of porters."
"D: This beer drinks much bigger than it is, almost to the point of tiring my palate. It's good, but it would be a bit much to drink for an entire night."
"Impression: the bottles of this have been great, this growler features an even smoother beer from a keg. Bottles or kegs, this is a must try for anyone, esp. porter lovers."
"The mouthfeel is creamy due to nice smooth carbonation and the body is medium to heavy. I like this beer a lot and I will happily have it again. A wonderful drinking experience - try it with a pepperoni pizza like I did, it's an immaculate blue collar pairing!"
"The creamy feel and malty smell are especially notable, and Smuttynose manages to impress again despite the setback of the all-too-goofy label."
"Overall- Very nice porter with everything you would expect out of a robust porter. I could definitely have a few of these and feel pretty good about it! Great example of the style and no wonder it is in the BJCP style guidelines as a commercial example!"
"Notes: A ridiculously well made beer. This is everything I want in a porter; big black coffee and nice creamy mouthfeel."
"One of the best American porters I've had in a while, def worth a pint, single or 6 pack if available."
"goes down well. tasty and little to no harshness. can't complain, though it doesn't overwhelm either. which isn't always a bad thing."
"Drinkability: I'm going to rate the drinkability even higher than the flavor or aroma: I can't precisely put my finger on it, but I am really enjoying this beer."
"Taste Is malty rich, and lotsa coffee. It's bitter and sharp but quite drinkable. It's got a nice creamy mouthfeel."
"Nice effort, it's a good porter, but couldn't get over the odd bitter aftertaste."
"D - pretty low abv means i could get through a few of these things no problem.. i remember when i was a rookie this wasn't so ""drinkable"" because it was robust, but that then and this is now and right now i'm loving it (like mcdonalds)..."
"Pours a rich dark brown, letting some light through, nice cap of khaki head. Scent is of roasted malts, roasted nuts, roasted coffee beans, roasted cocoa beans... ya get the picture... but without too much char or earthyness. The first sip brings all of the wonderful roasted notes from the scent and blends them to make a big bold taste that is almost stout like. Nice earthyness to it as well. The body remains on the heavy side of medium, just a touch higher than most porters but with all that flavor its expected. A slightly earthy and chalky finnish is very nice. I am fully impressed with this porter, one of the best around."
"D- I feel like there are some caveats I have to keep in mind. As mentioned above...this is not a stout, and not your typical poolside summer brew. With that being said, I think this is a great example of this style that is flavorful and would pair great with food, something grilled or some deeper rich meats, hearty stew. For now, I will continue to drink it poolside."
"This is a great tasting porter. Highly drinkable and caseworthy. One of the better porters for sure."
"Another excellent porter from an outstanding brewery. I am enjoying this in the air conditioning while it roasts outside."
"Got this in florida, only 1 mind you, and I'm very sad I did not get more!!! :("
"The roasted, chocolate flavors of this beer are fantastic, it's like drinking a creamy mocha--there is enough clean hop bitterness and roast astringency to balance the sweetness of the beer. This beer has a great thick texture, that is chewy and full. Smuttynose Robust Porter is my go-to porter on the east coast when I want a flavorful, yet balanced dark beer to fulfill a chocolate craving or to pair with grilled or roasted meats. Superb!"
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Ping glass. Beer comes out Jet black, easily the darkest porter I've had. Dark like a Russian Imperial Stout. It has a chocolate milk colored head that sticks around and some lacing, nothing to really write home about, but pretty good. It smells really good. Chocolate malts and roasted ground coffee, a dark roasted coffee type smell followed by a slight hop aroma. Taste is good, much like the aroma. Coffee and chocolate flavors. Again its a dark coffee flavor and a rich chocolate. Tough to tell, but when it the chocolate seems to go away a little as it warms up and the coffee takes over. The hops combine with the coffee and give it a little bitter after taste, it's good. Its a very tasty porter, ""Robust"" is an extremely accurate description on what's going on in both the smell and taste. Mouthfeel is full and heavy, bitter finish. Very drinkable, more of a fall/winter beverage, but I enjoyed it in July. I was on a Porter kick about 2 months ago, I think I might have rated it much higher than, but I still enjoyed this and I'd get it again."
"D: Great, one of the best porters I have ever had."
"D - Not the best but a decent porter. Won't seek out but would drink again."
"D - an excellent porter. Alcohol isn't noticeable at all. Not sure why they call this a robust porter at 5.7%. Will definitely seek this one out in the future."
"Pours an impressive deep black. Smells of chocolate syrup, coffee beans and a hint of alcohol. Faint aroma overall however. Tastes of bitter unsweetened chocolate, roasted black coffee and has a stronger hop backbone than most porters. Finishes with a mild dryness. The bitterness stands out in this beer, both in the malts and hops."
"D - This is a very good beer, and one of my favorite straight-up representations of the style."
"Overall: Overall the beer had a very good flavor. It's a porter that has a real coffee kick finish. I'd recommend this to any porter drinker and if it's cheap, this is an easy everyday beer."
"Pours a very deep chestnut brown color with a small, dense brown colored head that disipated into a light ring. The aroma has some nice milk chocolate notes, brown sugar, and a touch of wet wood. The taste has the milk chocolate characteristics as well but there is also some bitter chocolate flavors. I pick up some wood, smoke, coffee grounds, and some brown sugar. The feel is quite thick and chewy, definitely thicker than most traditional porters. On par with a baltic porter. The porter has soft carbonation which leads to a creamy texture. The beer starts off sweet but ends with a roasted malt bitterness. A robust porter indeed. It has some nice earthy characteristics between the chocolate and smoke. Not enough smoke to get confused with a smoked porter but enough to add some complexity. The 5.7% abv lets you drink several of these without much affect. Very recommended, good example of the style. My only knock is that it is a bit thick for my liking in a porter."
"this is a great porter, up there with the best. i highly recommend this. kind of like a ""light"" imperial stout if you can imagine that. for the $8, it was a bargain, get it!"
"D- Any time I'd want a porter and this was around, I'd opt for it"
"D: Outstanding drinkability. I wish I had another right now. In fact I may go to the beer store right now even though I have about 7 or 8 other beer types ready to drink. Drinking anything else after this is not fair to that beer."
"Bravo to the inconsistent Smuttynose for this beer. Between this and their annual Pumpkin Ale, they're capable of some really fantastic work."
"D - Would have and recommend again in the future."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability is good, it was a very good tasting porter with a great mix of flavors. They really mixed the coffee and chocolate flavors very well. One of the better porters I've had, and will be buying again."
"Recent convert to dark beers. Robust Porter is one of the reasons."
"D - Simply outstanding. High drinkability. I could drink this beer all night any night of fall or winter. Great drinkability. I tried Wachusett Black Shack Porter a while back and loved it and yet this is exponentially better!"
"D- A big, roasty porter to say the least."
"D: As someone who can't drink coffee (too bitter for me, somehow?) yet loves coffee flavor, this is a great way to get my kicks. It seems that the bitterness is compounding, as it gets stronger with every sip. If I didn't know better, I'd probably guess it was over 7% ABV."
"Easy to understand why some have called this the best porter in New England. If it were to be tweaked a bit, I'd bring up the malt bill just a bit to match the sweet and bitter better. Really good brew from a great brewery."
"Reaching for another."
"I like this beer very much and it would be my go to Porter if I lived in the Northeast."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink & would be willing to drink more. I'm relatively new to the porter scene, but think this would be a tough one to beat."
"This is a delicious porter and has moved among my favorites"
"Tasty. Robust. Excellent!"
"Smuttynose did it right, this is definitely a robust version of the style and is now one of my favorites of the style. Relatively low ABV and lots of highlights (including the amusing labels typical of Smuttynose) make this an extremely drinkable porter and one that I will be revisiting over and over again in the future. Definitely pick this up if you see it around."
"12oz bottle into a pint glass. Make mine a smutty. This porter is deep dark brown like shoe polish with a semi thick looking body from the pour. The pour was very tilted leaving for more than an inch of mocha dark tan colored foam, leaving rings down the glass. Smell is robust like the name suggests with big roasted malts and some creamy coffee. In taste some more coffee and some hops coming through from a fresh bottle. Some nuttiness and a splash of vanilla and even less chocolate. An above medium feel is bordering on full. The feel is a bit fuller than the appearance would allude to. Carb is where it needs to be, not to big. I will drink this again and get a sixer of it, when the weather gets cold enough for it."
"D- this is robust for sure. The flavor really makes me think its of a larger abv. I would have no problem having a whole pint but probably only one."
"Pours near black with creamy tan head. The aroma is nice and roasted - coffee rinds, dark chocolate, and a little earthy hop shining through. The taste is perfectly balanced, a marriage of dark chocolate and hops. A little communal bite of bitterness from both the roasted malt and bittering hops. The body is medium, and carbonation spot on. One of the best American porters in the country, and one I crave when not on the east coast."
"D - This would be a nice session porter...the flavors work well together and it could be enjoyed chilled...definitely robust"
"Drinkability: I love the start and body of this beer, but the end is a bit too long and harsh. Take away the the ending for me and you have a near perfect porter. I would still do a couple with the finish, but could see myself drinking a lot more with a smoother ending."
"D - Very drinkable beer, espeically in the right weather."
"D - Almost like a Dry Irish Stout, this Porter is very dry and bitter on the finish. Smooth and round is what makes it so drinkable though. A good Porter that is ""robust"" to the point of a stout."
"D: I can knock back a few of these with the great taste that comes through, well balanced"
"Drinkability- highly drinkable wit nice long bitter finish, the flavor is complex and multilayered that it leaves you craving you next sip, a fine example of an american porter showcase power and complexity and finesse, a nice find"
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. The full-body and powerful flavor do not detract from this beers drinkability for my tastes. It just makes me want another. Delicious and drinkable."
"D: Not too strongly alcoholic but certainly not something I can suck down..."
"D: Pretty good. Solid beer."
"M/D: Pretty drinkable and tame; smooth and easy to drink. I could definitely session this."
"The taste is quite nice, definitely on the sweet side with lots of chocolate and coffee notes. I felt it was a little to syrupy and sticky on the palate to rank with the great porters from Sam Smith but definitely worth a try."
"If you like Porters, this is a must have."
"D: Could see myself having a couple of these. Low ABV, nice taste."
"D: This is very drinkable. Of course I enjoy dark beers. Therefore, I will be having this beer again!"
"Overall, this is a decent porter. It is very, very robust and lives up to its name but its not a porter I care to drink again."
"D - pass. The smell issue and alcohol after taste put it off my future list."
"D Driven down by the harshness but I finished the pint without much delay. 3.0"
"I could easily put down a dozen of these in a night loving every sip."
"Where fans of darer ale typically reach for stout, all should take notice to this formidable ale that belongs in the discussion with Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter and Founders Porter."
"-Bye"
"Medium body, with lower, soft carbonation. Alcohol is well hidden. This beer is dry, sharp and roasty. So much so, that it may hinder the drinkability slightly. However, this is very well made, and a bit different than others."
"D: Taste reigns supreme and this was certainly a good single bottle purchase. A coffee fanatic this didn't quite pull me in, but I can see the appeal. Certainly not a disgrace to all the porters out there."
"D - Very well done and highly recommended. If this were easier to come by (read: if I didn't have to drive to Wisconsin) it would definitely be a regular in my fridge."
"Notes: Despite the just expired date this felt rather tasty and nicely brewed. I´ll sure make note of trying to try it next time within its recommended lifespan and see what it feels like. Solid and tasty porter in any case."
"so drinkable. really, a superb porter and better than most."
"Pours dark brown to black with a tan head. The aroma is milk chocolate and roasted malt. The flavor is strong on the coffee and roasted malt. I didn't get much if any chocolate in the flavor. The beer has a creamy mouthfeel and low carbonation. This is exactly what I am looking for in a beer of this style."
"Very nice! Pours black with a decent light-brown head. Nice smoky aroma. Flavor is roasty, roasty, roasty! Appearance is beautiful with lotsa lacing, looks like tree rings on my glass. While not as thick & heavy as an Impy Stout, it is a bit heavy for a porter. Very glad to finally give this one a shot & will certainly buy again!"
"Fantastic -- honestly an excellent porter! Pours thick and black, the head is tan, one can instantly detect smells of coffee and chocolate. Every flavor is subtle and harmonizes nicely lending itself to be consumed one right after another -- doesn't have the high of an ABV either."
"The bitterness lingers a bit longer than I'd like. Personally, I am a biggher fan of English porters - this was a good brew, drinkable, but not my favorite style."
"Smells of roasted chocolate and coffee. Taste is a spoonfull of the same. This beer finishes nicely, no aftertaste, very smooth. Drinkability is high. One of the best american porters i have had. I will definitely drink again."
"Drinkability: Quite nice and probably more ""stoutish"" than some stouts I've had lately; looks and smells good, tastes great and the mouthfeel is quite nice and just heavy enough to sit in the stomach, but not weigh one down; I'd be happy to polish off a couple of these in a night, especially with a moderate ABV of 5.7."
"D: A really nice porter, and definitely lives up to the 'robust' in its name. Another winner from Smuttynose."
"Very nicely done and pretty damn close to a session beer"
"A bargain at $1.69 for the bottle. I'll be buying some more of this in the future."
"D - been having a hard time finding a porter beyond ""decent"". the search ends. this is perfect to sip on this time of year. just had one bottle but might put more on my christmas list. well done!"
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and thin with a biting carbonation. Really the only disappointing aspect of this beer."
"This seemed to be quite a superior porter at first, and then it actually became more unpleasant as it warmed. Still a good beer. It would be nice to have on hand just when you're in the mood for that rich, roasted flavor."
"This beer poured a very dark brown with a tan head, looking very much like a porter should. The smell is mostly toasted malts with a hint of hops in the background. The taste starts off with some sweet slightly-burnt malts that are followed by some coffee and bitter chocolate. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with a decent amount creaminess. This is a great version of the style, one of the ones to point people towards if they're wondering what a porter should be."
"Overall: Glad to have this on my home system. Will have again and again."
"Drinkability: Heavily flavored, always enjoyable. Could go for another one."
"Another great beer from Smuttynose. This is perhaps a little more bitter than I'm used to for a dark beer, but I got used to it quickly. Definitely wouldn't mind having another."
"Black as night. Robust, yet easy drinking. Extremely balanced. Very pleasant on the palate. Malty, chocolate tones. I'll skip all of the alliteration...simply put, this is the best Porter I have ever ingested! I would recommend keeping a constant supply on hand."
"Overall, I'm very happy with this beer. I'm glad I have five more sitting in the fridge and will probably try this one again in the near future."
"The intense robustness of this porter effects the drinkability a bit. A full flavored beer and on par with some of the greats of this style."
"it's a little bit harsh to just drink due to his dark roast but if you dont mind it. its very good for what they say though a ""Robust Porter""."
"Full bodied and with a great bitter aftertaste. Very balanced and drinkable, definitely one to have in the fridge in the regular rotation. right up there with their IPA as my favorite Smuttynose brew."
"Overall I was much more impressed with this beer the second time around (first time on-tap). An excellently done porter and well worth a shot."
"I'm a bit new to porters but I really like this one. It is very drinkable and I can think of a number of meals I'd love to enjoy this with (burgers, steaks, stews, roast beef, etc..). Smuttynose continues to impress me. Highly recomended!"
"drinkable beer despite the not-so-great smell. strong taste for 5.7 ABV, could be a bit smoother but definitely sessionable for a robust porter."
"12oz bottle. Pours opaque dark brown with a substantial light brown head. Nice lacing. Dark roasted malt with some cocoa on the nose; some pretty clear coffee notes as well. Heavy roasted malt in the taste as well, to the point that some bitterness comes through. Light coffee sweetness before a dry finish. Medium-full body. A nice porter overall."
"Drinkability: If it were just a little lighter or smoother, I'd drink it all the time. This is probably the second best American porter I've ever had, next to Black Butte."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with a half inch brown head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice, it smells like roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and some molasses. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like coffee, bittersweet chocolate, burnt malt/smoke and roasted malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and silky with good carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and easy to drink. This porter lives up to its name, it is quite robust and enjoyable. I'd definitely buy this again the next time I get a chance to."
"For me this is a good once and done cold weather beer."
"Overall - This is one of my favorite porters, if not my favorite. Fantastic representation of what a porter should be, and almost flawlessly executed. Highly recommended."
"Cheers!!!"
"Pours a dark black color. 1/3 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, slight alcohol, and slight hop. Fits the style of an American Porter. Mouth feel is smooth and creamy with an average carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, slight toffee, and slight hops. Overall, a great aroma, great flavor, body, and blend."
"A very nice, drinkable porter overall. The flavors are indeed robust, which tends to make me think twice before having another, but all things considered the drinkability on this one is good. This is one of my favorite porters, and a perfect beverage for chilly fall nights."
"Very easy drinking. Does not feel very filling. Could easily have 3 or 4... or more on a nice fall night."
"D: This is one big, bad, bold porter. Great for sipping and admiring the strong taste. A nice example of the style without leaving a hole in your wallet."
"This beer pours a dark brown color. The head is a half inch in height, and recedes into a small cap of light tan lacing. The aroma is graham crackers, roasted malt, burnt malt, and a hint of chocolate. The taste is like the aroma, but with a significant bitterness through out the sip. The bitterness seems to hide the porter characteristics of the beer, and I'm rarely a fan of that. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a velvety texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a decent porter, but like I already mentioned I'm rarely a fan of hoppy porters. I could drink this beer again without any complaints, but with all kinds of great porters out there I won't be in a hurry to get back to this one."
"T- It's got an outstanding smokey, burnt taste to it, almost coal ish. Smooth but very full bodied."
"This was a pleasure to drink....creamy yet light enough to drink a few. Excellent example of a porter, appropriately named ""Robust"""
","
"D: What a killer porter. I wish we had more because this would have a pretty regular spot in the fridge!"
"D: Packed with flavor, this one would be a challenge to session. Nevertheless, I'll be glad to try! And for that reason and many other(see above), this beer qualifies as drinkable. This beer is an experience in itself. Must try. And then must buy more and frequently."
"D= I liked this beer a lot, but if I could change anything, I would dial back the roasted malt bitterness by about 10%. Still, it is tasty and full of flavor as a robust porter should be, and it would be easy enough to session a few."
"This porter compares favorably to most any I've had before. I'll be making this one a regular. Top-notch stuff here, keep it up Smuttynose."
"A fantastic beer by a fantastic brewery."
"I love porters and this is one of the better ones. Great job by Smuttynose."
"D: This is another great offering from Smuttynose. A nice porter that can satify both your malt and your hop fixes at once. Robust, indeed."
"D. Rich could only drink a few of these because of the heavyness of this brew"
"Poured into a standard pint glass. This is a very dark porter, just a hair shy of pure black. The good sized head is full of brown bubbles. It doesn't leave any lacing. The aroma is full of coffee and chocolate scents, but I can also detect some malt. The robustness of that is this porter's namesake come from the strong coffee bitterness in the flavor. It is immediately detectable and lingers after you swallow. There is another flavor behind the coffee that my drinking partner and I are trying to identify. There may be a trace of vanilla, and perhaps cocoa/dark chocolate. The beer is medium bodied; it doesn't coat your mouth nor is it light and watery. I think this beer is very drinkable, but personally it may be too bitter for me to drink a number in a row; I'd need to have a lighter beer every third or fourth round. Still, this is an excellent porter, and worth seeking out."
"D- Very high drinkability for a porter. This one has enough complexity to make it stand out a bit more than other porters."
"Salud!"
"D- This beer is jam packed with flavor for a 5.7% beer, very tasty stuff! Recommended!"
"It's American, it's a porter."
"D: This is a great porter. I look forward to having more!"
"Overall: Good drinkability, great roasted smell and flavor. Not a whole lot going on in the flavor, but what is there is very good. Thick and creamy in mouthfeel and appearance, very appealing."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a pitch black body with a foamy 1 1/2 finger tan head that settles into a thick collar. Who can see any bubbles in that void of blackness? Aroma is of smoky roasted malt. taste is of black coffee ( no cream or sugar), light smoke, & dark unsweetened chocolate. Medium mouthfeel, not heavy or watery. Good drinkability!! Outstanding porter!!!"
"This beer has always been one of my favorites, so I may be a bit biased in my review. Came across this brew on tap at Audubon Circle on Beacon Street. Served in their normal tall, thin beer glasses. Dark brown color. Large fluffy tan head. Huge smell of coffee. I think this beer tastes amazing. Coffee and dark chocolate play off each other perfectly. Deliciously malty and smooth. Since it's a porter, it's a bit on the heavy side, so it's not a session beer. Also, the abv borders on 6%. Robust Porter is a great beer to just sit with, sip, and relax."
"This is my first offering from Smuttynose, and I was far from disappointed. This is a great brew."
"Drinkability: This one of those beers where the word ""balance"" comes immediately to mind. It is also highly drinkable in the sense that I'm loving each sip. Even though I'd probably not drink more than one a night because of the robustness of flavors I'll be returning to this beer again."
"D- Very good beer and a pleasure to drink."
"Very good beer. Smuttynose is climbing the charts in my book."
"Drinks so easy, eventually the dryness would get to me, after say 3 or 4 pints, great porter!!!"
"Drinkability - Very disappointing. To thin and watery for my taste. Too hoppy, and too dry. This Porter is anything but robust."
" Vibrant flavors and creamy mouth-feel make for better than average drinkability."
"This beer tastes like the younger brother of Peche Mortel like Troeg's Hopback Amber is to Nugget Nectar. It's lighter and easier to drink, but it still packs some serious flavor."
"Smuttynose is justified in calling their porter 'robust'. It is a flavourful beer and full of character. The rich maltiness only increases with warmth, as do the hints of coffee and bittersweet chocolate. If I could I would keep this beer around the house not only because it's easy to drink but because it is a characterful, well crafted porter."
"Very smooth. My first thought after sampling this issue from Smuttynose. I recently had their Imperial Stout and was so impressed that I went out and bought the Robust Porter. This porter is perfectly positioned: no bitterness, very smooth, great body, nice taste, no burn, in fact tastes much bigger than the 5.7% ABV would imply. Not much in way of an aroma, but more than makes up for it in smoothness, body, and taste. A definite keeper."
"I bought this in a mixed 12 pack that contained 3 Shoals Pale Ale, 3 Finest Kind IPAS, 3 Brown Dog Ales, and 3 ""Brewer's Choice"" which turned out to be the Robust Porter. I was very pleasantly surprised by this choice as the Brewer's Choice. Not my favorite porter, but this is a damn good porter. Pick one up without reservation"
"This beer is pretty light but very flavorful. The feel is a bit of a heavy/medium but is pretty drinkable and goes down well."
"Poured into a pint glass pours a pitch black with a foamy tan head that leves some nice lace on the glass. Smell is of burnt chocolate with roasted oats and sweet faint molasses. Taste is pretty good with nice chocolate, coffee taste to it with a nice hop bitterness. The hop burn flavor lingers on the palate for quite some time. Overall a tasty porter and one that I would recommend."
"Drinking Smuttynose Robust Porter was like being in a coffee house. A dark, gritty coffee house that doesn't make any frou-frou drinks ending in ""...achino."""
"D--This 12 oz. bottle didn't last long, and I could definitely drink a few more if I was in the mood. It doesn't have that ""x factor"" that makes me excited to drink more but this is sessionable for sure."
"D - Meh, a little disappointing overall. None of the expected sweetness or even sour hints I would've expected. More like a semi-dry stout. The weird coffee flavor is slightly off putting and doesn't really make me want another sip."
"Pours pitch black with a average toffee head and some good lacing. Smells mostly of bakers chocolate and roasted malts I cant pick up much else. The flavor is indeed robust with all the right flavors, heavy roasted malt flavoring some mild hop bitterness chocolate and a lingering burnt taste. Full flavored yet drinkable. This is a very good porter second to only Old Leghumper for me. Another good one form Smutty"
"This is a good beer, flavorful and balanced; however, I don't I find anything extraordinarily special about it. A pretty good choice if you want a porter."
"Heavier and substantial with above average drinkability because it tastes pretty good, almost a meal in a glass."
"Overall, a good porter to pick up a six pack of. I enjoyed the flavor and thought I could have this in any situation and be equally impressed."
"a good beer but not precisely my preferred porter."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is a dark chocolate brown color, with a thick tall light brown head that lasts quite long leaving good lacing. The aroma is full of chocolate, sweet caramel malts, some burnt coffee, and hints of some nuttiness. The flavor falls a little short of the great smells, but is still solid. You get a strong shot of coffee, but is more bitter than sweet. The finish is very smooth but leaves a lingering burnt taste. Good brew all around, but the actual taste leaves a little to be desired."
"Robust certainly fits the description. A dark black pour like a stout, and a brown creamy head that holds very well. Smell is all malt to this nose, and the flavor hits you immediately. Very bold, this is quite distinctive in my limited travels. The roasted malt flavor immediately hits, and it seemed a little bitter for a Porter on the way down. The flavor mellows as it the beer warms. A good solid medium body, with good carbonation. I enjoyed this beer and could certainly have a few. The flavor did mellow as the beer warmed up a bit, a tasty and distinctive American Porter!!"
"Nice stout, well defined, conservative. Could use a slightly smoother body with a hint less carbonation."
"I was surprised to see that the ABV was only 5.70%. Between the taste and the hue, I thought it would be a lot higher, but that's probably because of all the heavier beers that I drank oer the winter. Although this isn't a good session beer or to pair with dinner, it would pretty much suffice for most other occastions that didn't involve warm weather. Certainly a must-try and one of the more pleasant suprises I've had in quite some time!"
"Overall this is a very nice porter."
"Thanks for Reading"
"Really a nice beer. I'll be back for more. Probably will wait until the fall, but I will be back."
"The taste was also very smokey, charcoal almost. Very good. It was quite thick but a great mouthfeel. This is one great porter that I think I could drink for a while. Goes down easy with a nice smokey taste."
"Drinkability is spot on, I could drink a six pack of these in a night, and the price tag is generous for as far as porters go, this one is up there and it is not sold in a 4 pack!"
"D: Very well built. Because of the richness I would limit myself to one per session. At 5.7% this is one that could be enjoyed all night. I would suggest this one to anyone."
"fantastic creamy mouth that leaves me going back in for more. I could drink this for hours. DAMN YOU SMUTTY FOR NOT DISTRIBUTING TO THE WEST COAST. iso robust porter ft my unborn first child."
"This is probably my favorite porter here in New England, its extemely drinkable and in my opinion its the best example of an American Porter I've had from these parts."
"Drinkability: Overall, a very nice tasting brew. It's a shame I only got one of these left."
"D: excellent all around and very drinkable to boot."
"Delicious, well-executed, and smooth. Goes down well."
"This is my first Smuttnose beer & I'm not disappointed. This is a very tasty porter. Don't pass up an opportunity to try this one if you can."
"Poured into a pint glass, super dark with a dark, thick head that wont go away. Smelled of roasted barley with some chocolatey sweetness and biter like coffee. Taste was similar to smell, very thick, roasty and malty taste, then turning to bitter and with a coffee like aftertaste. Great porter, goes great with a steak."
"D - Nice and even, just enough roasted ""warmth"" to keep it going down. Very nice for this style."
"Very dark brown head, consistent one finger depth, randomly mixed bubble sizes, super sticky lacing. Even through the close to jet black color you can see the bubbles cling to the inside glass walls, no variation nor lightening anywhere. Gets right up in there with roasty, smoky malts, grilled nuts, dark chocolate powder, cappuccino, raisin and lighter prune fruit scents, oatmeal, for all of this a narrow, consistent burst of hoppy bitterness punctures your nostrils, for the better you can never shut off the brain and relax as you sniff. Medium-bodied in terms of sheer palate weight but it is so firm and taut that you'd need a sandblaster to wash it out of your mouth. The carbonation continuously resparks the coffee bean, dark chocolate, butterscotch flavors, much more verve than sweetness. Green grape, fig, golden raisin, red cherry flavors give the fruit profile a dancing lightness. The hops engage, disengage and reengage just to prod things forward. Has you sucking the flavor out of your tongue after you swallow."
"Served in a pint glass. Pours black as night with just a hint of brown at the edges. The head was almost non-existent and very disappointing (may be a bad pour, i seem to remember this having a decent head last time I drank it). Smells and tastes as dark as it looks. Odors and tastes of smoke, coffee and chocolate. Delicious, but very thick and strong. A little too strong to drink more than one in a sitting. I had this bottle in my fridge for a while, waiting to get reviewed. It took a long time before i was in the mood for it again. I guess it's just not my style."
"My First smuttynose experience and I will definately have another one soon..."
"the appearance, is great. the bar was dark, but the head seemed to be super powerful. stuck and spider webbed all over the glass. really was a stand out aspect of the beer's looks. the smell was great, like i'm sure ill say throughout this post a few times; robust. full of notes and scents to be picked up on, some growing stronger as it warmed up. the beers were served a bit cold. along with the smell, the taste was very robust. tons of malts and barleys, sweet and bitter. mixing in with that tons of coffee hues along with chocolates in there as well. lots of those standard elements one looks for in a porter, all combined into a great beer. one of my favorite porters i've tried. lots of sweet and bitter tones opposed to sometimes metallic and bland notes. another great smutty."
"A very satisfying porter, excellent for the style. Pours very fark brown with a somewhat slight head that fades to a thin ring. Smells roasty and a bit malty, but on the dry side. There are also some citrusy hops in the aroma mix. Tasty, tasty. Nice balance between thoroughly roasted grain, some slightly sweet malt, and some nice citrus peel bitterness. Smooth and not nearly so thick as a stout, and the malt and hops bring everything to a perfect balance of light roast and bitterness. Quite sry and with just the right body. A real pleasure to drink."
"Strong flavors, if not very subtle. Not lying about the robust part. With roast character and only moderate hops, this is pushing towards being an Irish stout and not a porter."
"Smuttynose, welcome to Atlanta!"
"After such a lovely smell, I was disappointed in the taste. It consisted of a bit of a coffee-esque flavour with some dark roasted flavours as well, which certainly sounds good, but there was just something peculiar about this one that I didn't care for. Also, the Cascade hop bitterness on the finish doesn't seem to fit this beer, or the style, for that matter. It just wasn't for me. Mouthfeel was very thin and left a bit to be desired, too, IMO. Not a bad beer, simply one I do not care for."
"T - Would tire after awhile, but nice."
"poured from a bottle. pours thick black with little head that dissipates quickly. light roasted malt scent. taste is very smokey with hints of coffee. slightly dry and bitter as compared to most porters i try. almost reminds me of a mix between a porter and a stout. slightly above medium carbonation. this overall it is very drinkable and a great late night treat. This is my 2nd smuttynose beer, as i slowly try this brewery out."
"D: Goes down pretty easy. The dryness makes you slow down a little."
"D - I would definately have more than one of these. The thickness isn't overbearing and the alcohol is relatively light."
"Lolts of roastiness in this, a slightly heavier body would improve it."
"D- It's a relatively filling beer; a robust liquid meal of sorts."
"This is a very chocolatey beer. The smell leaves something to be desired, but the taste is very strong. Chocolate dominates, but the hops also come through in a good way, mixing with the smokiness of the roasted malt. Only real negatives here are the poor presentation. Weak head, flat appearance, and little lacing. But, a great porter overall."
"A huge and flavorful brew all around. The flavors and aromas truly are robust and will come to form what is one of my favorite porters to date."
"Poured a 12 oz. bottle into a 12 oz. tumbler. Rich dark color emerged with sensational head that made me hold back just an half ounce to let settle. Smells of dark chocolate, coffee, and molasses embrace the senses. Little bitter on retrieval, tastes of the coffee and the sting of the hops are the star with no contest. Nicely hoped indeed. Medium bodied with a slight thickness in toe. The bite is spectacular, this feature makes for the perfect closer on any session. Will try again and recommend to those who never had. Stellar in all aspects!"
"Drinkability- I'll finish off the sixer, but I don't know if I'll hurry to pick up another. Taste is a whole lot like a French Roast coffee, but personally, I prefer more of a Full City Roast."
"Dr: A home run. Flavorful and easy."
"A top notch brew here. If you are a porter fan this is a must."
"VIA donkeyrunner"
"Overall a very solid porter with a unique smokey taste to it."
"Here is a robust porter that actually lives up to its name. And at less than 6% abv no less. I do find it to be a bit out of balance, however, with too much bitterness. The intense bitter espresso flavor starts to get to me and affects drinkability, but I suppose I'd rather have that than a porter that's lacking in flavor. Overall a very solid porter."
"Overall: this is certainly a robust porter and worth your time, especially if you're a coffee lover."
"Overall, a really good porter that I'm glad I finally got to try. It's a tad too bitter to be top tier porter for me but it comes damn close. I'm going to have to get some more over the years as I expect I'll grow into the bitterness. Highly recommend. Would make the change-up rotation for porter/stouts if available here."
"Pours a very dark, though not quite impenetrable reddish brown that looks almost black in the glass, with a giant brown head that smells strongly of coffee in a thermos, burnt marshmellows, and rich dark chocolates. So far so good. Taste is phenomenal. Complex dark malts up front - an unapologetically roasty S.O.B. - with a burnt bitterness that lingers for minutes. A very full body whose carbonation makes it almost creamy; a refined beast of a beer that is just as enjoyable to sip as it is to gulp. A very satisfying beer that can be had with any number of stews or meaty meals; also able to stand completely on its own cause you to marvel."
"Damn good beer. This one came in a trade but now I can buy Smutty in NC. Yipee!!!"
"The appearance of the beer was an espresso colored body and a thick tan head that dissipated a little two quickly. However, the smell was enticing and warm with a strong hint of dark chocolate. The initial flavor of the beer was rich but left an aftertaste that decreased it's drinkability."
"D - A bit too bitter (roasted, not hoppy) for me to have more than, say, two a night. Still, a delicious brew for fans of roasted and dark malts."
"The taste is quite drier than I anticipated. It is a creamy brew overall, but there is a unique grapefruit like acrid tartness, not often common in a porter. There are plenty of roasted malts, somewhat charred dark grains, the hops that are tart, and then plenty of chocolate and some coffee rind insinuate themselves throughout. If you let the beer settle, there are some raisiny or floral notes, but these are hidden way underneath. The mouthfeel is somewhat drying and tart. This is a medium bodied beer with an aftertaste that lingers just a little longer than necessary, but not bad."
"D: I could drink this all night, slowly, with great pleasure. A wonderful sipper - a little big for a session beer but who's going anywhere?"
"D: Very beefy for a porter."
"12 oz. Nice black/brown pour. Small disappating tan head. Very roasty aroma malt, coffee. Nice strong roast/burnt malt with mocha and some coffee bitters. More hop flavor than some porters, finishes with a clean bite. Not bad at all, will look for more from this brewer. Not quite as good as the Dark Horse Special Black I had a few weeks back, but worth trying."
"D - A nice slow drinking flavorful porter."
"Edit: 2-1-2010 ... had to try it again. Got a bit more head on this pour, and very nice lacing. Taste profile hasn't changed - predominant coffee."
"nose is of sweet roasted malts. not too hoppy not too burnt. same w/ the taste. this one is well balanced. a lot of porters are too agressive, this one is just right. great balance of the roasted malt character, sweetness and hops. all in all a very well rounded porter. velvety mouthfeel. goes down very easily."
"Over all: A very easy drinking porter. Not hard to enjoy several of these."
"D: Like I said, a surprisingly bitter and dense porter. But damn tasty. This is probably my favorite style, and this is near the top of my list from now on. Very complex and yes, robust. I'll be drinking this again in the future."
"D: Pretty good, but heavyish."
"Definitely a good drink, though."
"Smooth roast malt and coffee up front followed by a sour berry, ash taste that diminishes as the beer warms. Creamy but a litte airy mouthfeel."
"A great beer and one of my favorite porters. Lots of flavors going for it rounded out by lots of roastiness. I love this beer."
"This is not a chugging beer, and really opens up when it warms a little. This is a great porter! Don't hesistate to get some."
"D- This is a nice porter. I will drink more of these."
"Great value found on this one. Found it in a smuttynose sampler pack $11/12-pack. Can go toe-to-toe with my current stout favorites from Samuel Smith."
"M/D - Very creamy but a touch too high of carbonation level. Very easy drinking with a smooth finish."
"(rated Jul 9, 2007)"
"D - Heavy on the chocolate and roasted malt but still easy drinking."
"Overall, just killer porter. This was from a mixed 12 pack, and 3 is just not enough (all three of us dipped in an come out with the same brew). I could easily drink this all night. No off flavors, and nothing overpowering or cloying. Thin enough but rich enough for you to finish the glass fast. Wonderful beer."
"D: If I'd been in the money spendin' mood, I would have definitely bought another round. As it is, I may head out to Hegedorns and see if they have it on the shelf. It was hard not to drink it too quickly!"
"This beer is very enjoyable and at a good price. I'll be getting a lot more of these, and then missing them when the season is over. I have to give a strong recommendation on this one."
"Toasted, coffee aroma. Pleasant on the nose. Thick, bubbly, brown head, lots of lacing. Incredibly fine looking beverage. Woody, toasted, coffee taste. Enjoyable, different. Palate resembles drinking warm whipped cream, fantastic, but purely a winter beer."
"This beer pours very dark brown in color with a creamy tan colored head that fades into a thick and sticky lace. Scent is of is dark roasted malts and sweet chocolaty cocoa--very inviting. Medium to full-bodied with a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Taste starts off sweet and malty with notes of milk chocolate and a bit of dark fruit followed by some bitter and acidic flavors of dark (almost burnt) coffee. This is a highly enjoyable beer that I will be sure to pick up again."
"Pours a dark brown with a creamy tan head that leaves lace on the way down. Smells of chocolate and licorice. Tastes of chocolate, malty, roasty in the finish. Great roasty chocolaty flavor. Mouthfeel is creamy and silky smooth. moderate carbonation. Medium body. This is a fantastic porter, one of my favorites. At 5 % its easy to have a couple."
"Edit: After trying many porters, and many other beers, I can say that this is my all-time favorite. I wish a ""5.5"" was reserved for a one-time use for each BA. This beer would receive it from me."
"Drinkability is high considering the flavor crammed into this. I could easily drink several of these over the course of a night. A great dark beer."
"P.S. I tried this beer again on 21/1/09 and found the immediate smell and flavor of chlorine to be unsettling. A change in the water perhaps? While the flavors settled down eventually and were robust, the underlying chlorine remained. I asked a friend what she thought of the beer I was drinking. She smelled it and without any prompting at all told me, ""It smells like a swimming pool."" I'm guessing there was a change in the water quality."
"A flavorful, complex, and enjoyable porter. My only experience with this brewery to date, but I definitely plan to sample their other beers soon."
"3.6/5"
"Bought Kroger Daleville VA. Make your own 6 pack... Nice selection..."
"Pours a deep dark ruby red in the edges, but black everywhere else, very opaque, huge and thick chocolate milk head forms, drops a ton of lacing, insane retention, retains a solid layer for the whole bottle. Smell is very rich and roasty, tons of dark chocolate, toffee, coffee, bit of smoke, raisins, more chocolate, vanilla, some piny hops, just great. Taste is similar, milk chocolate and toffee, coffee roast, vanilla, ash, figs, bread, nuts, very dry roasty finish, tons of chocolate, light pine and solid bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, very rich porter, almost perfect. Would like a little more flavour, but the appearance and aroma are pretty great. Thicker body would be a plus as well."
"This was an excellent American Porter, easily one of the best that I've had. I wish Smuttynose distributed out here as I've enjoyed everything I've had from them so far."
"Drinkability: Each gulp is like a shooting star: there is a distinctive fluid sequence that is seamless and brief, so there is sure relish in paying attention to what's making you happy. The promise of a deeper glow drains one's glass with steady meter. As mine just has!"
"D: There is so much going on here that I want to keep going back for more. The low ABV makes it easy to have a few of these."
"Tastes of chocolate and light coffee with a good hop presence. Chewy and spicy black licorice flavors arrive a bit later and finishing with a lingering ever-so-bitter chocolate close. A nice medium body matches the style and the carbonation rather well. I'm slowly becoming a fan of Porters, guess it's time to settle into 'winter' mode."
"Bottle thanks to Mark. Pours a black color with a medium light-brown head. The aroma is very nice; roasted malts, some coffee, light dark fruits and smoke. The flavor is excellent; lots of rich roasted malts and some chocolates. A strong hop mix balances the beer out somewhat. Lots of smoke and a nice dark fruit aspect too. Very nice."
"very drinkable but not something you'd sit around and cut the grass with"
"D: For such a dark beer, I found the texture pretty light. I would say this is a medium-bodied brew. I couldn't quite see sessioning this, but there is definitely potential for you to enjoy more than one of these in a sitting."
"The drink is silky-smooth and medium-bodied"
"HV"
"Highly drinkable porter. In fact this is one of the best beers that I have from smuttynose yet. Excellent job. Get some."
"The flavor mirrors the aroma well, kicking the bitter chocolate notes into overdrive. This slowly gives way to roasted coffee grounds and a somewhat uninspiring middle note of caramel malt and smoke. Mouthfeel is creamy, but deceptively thin, and could stand to be a bit more fuller-bodied. However, the finish is amazing, with baker's chocolate and bitter hops lingering for days. All in all, Robust Porter is a great beer by a great brewery. I would gladly purchase this again. [goes great with grilled meat]"
"Holy crap! this is pure darkeness. Pours like motor oil with a brown creamy head. High marks for appearance. Very strong tasting porter. Dark Chocolate and coffee with unfortunate acidic aftertaste. Altough it has a light feel to it this porter is very hard to drink. The flavors are very very rich."
"Poured a thick, oily, close-to-black color, but with some hints of very dark red when held up to the light. There was a thick, tan head, that slowly faded down heavy lace around the edge of the glass. The smell was pretty strong: plenty of roasted coffee and a pinch of pleasant burnt flavor. There was also a little hoppy smell there that stung the nose a bit, plus the faint whiff of alcohol. The taste was great: it started out actually kind of sweet and soft when it first hit the tongue. Then aftertaste is a fantastic combination of bitter flavors: unsweetened dark chocolate, coffee grinds, and acidic hops. The mouthfeel was smooth, thick, and creamy. A very nice beer, overall well balanced: not too thick, not at all runny, full of flavor. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I would be happy to have another right now."
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. The beer pours very dark with a thin white head. The beer has a strong enjoyable smell of chocalate malt, perhaps with a hint of coffee. The taste is a mix of chocalate, coffee and burnt toast. This is an easy drinking enjoyable medium bodied beer."
"Overall, this is a pretty good porter. There are a few I would put above this, but it is good nonetheless."
"Decent session brew-full-flavored yet by no means filling. Well done!"
"d - Very drinkable at 5.7%, very tasty...try this for sure"
"A very nice porter. Possiby the best I have had. Thanks a ton for this one Lrrr. I believe it is now available in NC so I may have to seek this one out again. Thanks!"
"D--Decent. With so much going on in the flavor profile it's tough to throw back too many of these. But at nearly 60 degrees both outside and in the glass, you can't go wrong."
"D: This is one of the better examples of a porter I've had in awhile. Very easy to drink and suprisingly not too heavy."
"D: Overall I found this beer highly drinkable. I'm a big malts fan and this beer delivers. Creamy and rich, this beer has made me a Smuttynose fan."
"overall, a very good porter, this is my first beer from Smuttynose and now I'm excited to try more!"
"Tastes of chocolate, a mix of hop and dark coffee bitterness, fruits and roasted/burnt malts."
"D - Drinkability is good. It goes down quite easy and lends itself well to consuming a few at a time. If Smuttynose distributed to Ohio I would revisit this one at a later date. But alas... Good solid porter from Smuttynose that I could easily recommend to any dark beer fans."
"D: Robust, but certainly worthy of a couple."
"Wow what a beer! Dark dark and more dark. No light what so ever getting through that body. Head was light brown and frothy. Heavy lace all the way down the glass. Chocolate in the nose with slight fruitiness. Taste is roasted and mocha like. Sweetness clings to the mouth after the swallow. On the big side of medium in the body. Almost too big for a porter. It is a very good beer but I think it is a tad too big. Definitely earns it robust title. But I like it alot. Lots of flavor and complexities in there."
"Drinkability - In summary: A ""warming"" beer with a slight bitter finish. Had vague association with a Russian Imperial Stout more than a porter. Overall, I look forward to the remaing five (5) from this six-pack."
"I had this porter at Mahar's public bar in Albany, New York"
"D: Robust but very drinkable. Leans toward Malt but hops come through in flavor just enough to balance well. I could have a few more if I had them. This is a very good porter in my opinion and I would recommend highly."
"Smooth finish. Very drinkable and highly recommended."
"Poured into a pint glass. Color was a dark coffee brown. The head was mocha colored and about 1 inch. Aroma was sweet and coffe like. Taste is like an earthy dark chocolate. This is very easy to drink. I have recently gotten back into trying Porter's again as my palate for different beers has expanded. I picked a really good one. Smuttynose continues to impress me even with their ""regular"" beers."
"Served in a tulip. Poured a deep, opaque brown with a quarter inch off-white cap that quickly dissipated into a broken slick of foam that coalesced into a frothy band around the edges. Some spotty strands of lacing present during the tasting. Pleasant roasted coffee character dominates the nose. Taste follows nose with a touch of char and an earthy finish. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with the perfect amount of carbonation present. This, in my opinion, is the perfect porter. Incredibly well-balanced, excellent drinkability and lots of character for the abv."
"Poured out of the bottle and opaque, onyx black with a brown head that faded very quickly to a thin ring. Laced pretty well though. Aromas of coffee, chocolate and roasted malt. Flavors were similar, coffee dominates with some roasted and caramel malts and bit of sweetness of rich fruit. It is indeed robust for a porter and similar to a stout. Long finish. Medium to high carbonation is unusual however and takes a bit away from the otherwise smooth mouthfeel. One of the better Smutty brews available."
"A very nice robust porter. I wish it were available in my area."
"D: This is how to use a porter as a vehicle for roast and caramel malts"
"Another Smuttynose award winner and another fine brew. I can't wait to make a pilgrimage to this brewery or visit at the next beer fest just to see what they might be cooking up next. In the meantime, enjoy this outstanding porter."
"Black in color with a nice tan head and an okay amount of lace left behind. The aroma is pretty nice, they've got a coffee, chocolate thing going on which is pretty much follows suit in the taste as well. Somewhat dry with the addition of some malt and bitterness. Not one I'll get too often though as this isn't my favorite style."
"Pours dark, dark brown with only the slightest hint of light penetrating around the edges. The tan head is dense and shows very good retention and lacing. Aroma has big roasted malts with significant chocolate and coffee whiffs as well. There is also a little bit of hops in the nose as well. The taste is mostly roasted malts and coffee with some dark fruits and a bit of milk chocolate. Mouthfeel is creamy with tons of carbonation that accentuates the coffee bitterness a little bit. This is a great porter and yet another solid brew from Smuttynose."
"Best before right now, glad not to leave this in the cellar any longer! Poured black with a solid, half-finger mocha head, wispy lacing covered the whole glass really. Beneath all the blackness was very small bubble carbonation. I found a nutty presence starting with the smell, also a caramel and chocolate latte bouquet, quite intense. The taste was very rich, more choco-nut, astringent dry hazelnut/walnut finish that was almost too dry. Lingering walnut finish with more chocolate latte presence, this is one of the richer porters that I've enjoyed with a really frothy yet nutty- chocolate mouthfeel, quite interesting."
"Beer pours black with a well sustained tan head. Nose is toasted grains, coffee and cream, and dark chocolate. Taste is roasted coffee with a hint of cream, dark chocolates blending nicely into a mild hop finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied but is not as thick as the taste, but satisfying nonetheless. Drinkability is near perfect as the abv is in the sessionable range. This is a porter that should be sought after by anyone that is a fan of the style!"
"D - This is truly a wonderful robust porter - one of the best I've tried. It's too bad I can't get this in my neck of the woods - it would probably be a frequent fall favorite. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it."
"This was a smooth and tasty beer with an aroma that was to die for. At 5.7% ABV, this porter was surprisingly drinkable. Definitely one of the more impressive examples of the style I have tried in a while."
"D: Very drinkable. I had to catch myself when reviewing this brew because I kept comparing it to a RIS. It really has some serious richness to the flavor, nose and appearance that make this easily mistaken for a RIS. Still it stands tall as a porter due to its slightly thinner mouthfeel and is great for a night cap beverage. An almost nonexistant ABV presence doesn't hurt either. Really liked this beer. Amazing."
"Another great beer from Smutty! This actually pairs well with grilled steaks, and is also great for/with dessert. A very enjoyable brew."
" Medium bodied, crisp and livley but smooth around the edges which makes this one really drinkable for those of us that don't love overlly thick porter's."
"part of a Smutty mixed-pack from Whole Foods Reston, notched as best by November 2008"
"Drinkability: Great complexities in this one, reasonable abv%, and surprisingly refreshing for a beer of its maltiness. Definitely recommended."
"Creamy medium body. Very nice texture, smooth and enjoyable. One of the best porters I've had in a while."
"D: Definitely grabbing another!"
"This is one of my favorite sessionable porters and I tend to pick up a sixer whenever I'm in an area that carries Smuttynose. Robust Porter is incredibly easy to drink and very flavorful."
"Pours nearly black, some faint reddish highlights, big foamy tan head fades to a thin film on top of the beer, tons and tons of lacing. Smell is dark roasted coffee, some milk chocolate, and maybe just a touch of soft floral hoppiness. Taste is just huge on the coffee, with some great burnt edges, some bittersweet chocolate, slight plum flavor. Perfectly carbonated for an American Porter, great mouthfeel, and endlessly lingering coffee aftertaste. Really just a great porter, one of my favorites, and with the relatively low ABV, you could definitely have a few."
"Tested on 6/11/08."
"Very nice, robust, flavor. I'm really on to this whole robust classification. I suggest Smuttynose consider an aggresive, multi-million dollar marketing campaing for the ""Great American Robust Porter."""
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a dark coffee brown with a touch of transparency. Head was mocha colored, disappeared very quickly, but left a retaining ring around the top. Aroma was sweet, but also had tinges of burnt coffee. Taste reminded me of burnt wheat bread with a bit of bitter dark chocolate. The chocolate flavor lingered after drinking. Felt a little bitter and slightly acidic in the mouth, but coated well and not overly carbonated. Easy to drink but the limited alcohol content seemed to hit harder than I would expect for a similar ABV."
"I could drink this til the cows come home Smutty."
"""Robust""? Is that the right word for this? I think not."
"D : It's a pretty good porter, one I wouldn't mind having again."
"There is a nice amount of carbonation to keep this beer from becoming syrupy sweet. Overall, a very drinkable and enjoyable porter. I will keep coming back to this one."
"Drinkability: Pretty tasty brew. I would seek this out again."
"MF&D - Medium bodied porter with pleanty of flavor. Definitely worth checking out."
"Drinkability here is a bit above average. I'm not a huge fan of porter but I do like the style, and in the event that I can get this again I'd take it over some others that I've had. Good call here."
"Even though I'm not a huge porter fan, this is one terrific beer."
"I have a feeling this is a few hairs short of fantastic on tap but loses a little something off its fastball in a bottle."
"this is a wonderful session porter that i wish i could get in my area. it is very inviting and begs to be drank."
"Nice big-bodied and pleasantly drinkable robust porter."
"I thought this beer was quite good, and i would recommend it as a very fine (dry) porter. I bought this bottle at Woodman's in Oak Creek."
"D: Even with the balance, I think I'd be done after one of these. Tasty but probably a night cap or desert brew. 5.7% is actually surprising. Alcohol isn't really present in the nose or taste but the the intensity and... well, the robustness(lol) of this brew would make you think much higher than 5.7%."
"On of the best porters I have had in a while!"
"Overall, a really good porter.. Maybe not world class but it is still drinkable as hell and went great with my grilled cheese and tomato soup combo..."
"Final thoughts - Very smooth and rich. I really enjoyed this one and I like the bottle label."
"another from my smutty sampler ; pours a deep, almost lightless cherry-cola black w/ a small light-brown head which dissipates a bit quick leaving a fat ring of decent lacing all the way down my nonic ; a piney citrus hop mixed with dark roasted malts, some dark fruits present as well, reminds me of an RIS ; a rich, toasty flavor, almost tart w/ roasted nuts and a touch of citrus hop about midway, finishes well, dry w/ a slightly bitter coffee/toffee note ; a surprisingly light body, though quite creamy feeling, decent co2 prob. contributes to that ; an excellent beer, i'll def. enjoy this one again..."
"This beer is outstanding. No other way to put it. I could drink it all day."
"Pours dark black with a rich short lived brown head. Smell is roasty chocolately malt. Nice and rich. Taste is equally if not more rich, dark and roasty and lightly bittered to perfectly balance. Full bodied and just the perfect palate for a porter with light to moderate carbonation. Light burnt roasty notes and some coffee flavors appear without it being a coffee beer. Some light hops and dusty chocolate in the finish. What an incredible and drinkable porter this is. Up there with Troegs Dead Reckoning, and Nogne O Porter for my absolute favorites in the style, and otherwise."
"Overall not my favorite tastes in a porter. I would have liked a little more caramel or chocolate sweetness in here to balance out the sometimes acrid roastiness."
"Had on tap at the Moan and Dove, look was just as a porter should be not a huge head but it was present, immensely dark. Smell of coffee and toffee, slightly sweet, some astringency. Taste was of an even stronger coffee, almost espresso, nutty like walnuts, also slightly metallic like walnuts, good amount of bitterness. Great Porter, could have been just a shade thinner for more drinkability."
"Dark with some amber seen through the light. Very light chocolate colored head with an eventual lacing. Great sharp mocha and caramel smells, definitely smelled like a decadent frappe. The tastes were great: dark chocolate with a good bitter aftertaste. Medium body but lighter than you think. Overall, this was very nice."
"There is a full body that enhances and balances the roast/burnt tastes. A good creamy texture that stays through the full taste. Very nice presence. Very easy to drink and leaves a full flavor. One of the best robust porters I have had."
"D: A robust porter with a big deep dark roasted nature that was bitter, dark and true to style providing for a rich experience."
"(original date of review- 2/11/08)"
"Also, has one of the best labels in my opinion, so weird to see on a beer bottle."
"easy to enjoy with tons of flavor. And a good representation of the style."
" This is the first time I've tried this and I intend to make it my dark session till I'm bores and beating it like dead horse."
"Overall, this is a great stout I would certainly consider putting on tap."
"Notes: This one's been all over recently -- I've had it on tap at Beff's in both Albany & Delmar as well as the Lionheart in Albany. I'm not usually a big porter fan, but I'll make an exception for this one. . . ."
"Taste & mouthfeel - Bold, roasty and full-bodied. Flavors of coffee and dark chocolate come to mind. Very drying to the palate; there's no balancing sweetness to be found anywhere here. The beer finishes on a roasty (almost burnt) note, leaving a long lasting bitterness on the palate."
"Nice medium body. Coats well and the roasted flavors linger for a while. Overall, this is a really nice beer. Nice big body and simple but robust flavors. Pretty easy to drink. Just a lot of flavor for a 5.7% beer."
"Drinkability is ok a decent porter looks good and smells nice, just not up to being a regular in my frig with many others a wee bit better."
"d - A great porter. This one was very well balanced for me. Had a good bite and a nice roasted/burnt flavor."
"Pours an opaque black with a thin tan head that diminishes to a ring. Aroma is abundant brown malts with a hint of mocha. The taste is a wonderful blend of brown malts, rich cocoa, and mild espresso. Chocolate and caramel linger in the finish. The beer is light bodied and very smooth. This is yet another wonderful beer from Smuttynose."
"Let me put it this way-- my boyfriend, who does not generally like beer and teased me for buying this, had to have one of these with me, that's how good it is. Anyway, it pours dark with a nice, light head that's a bit thin. The smell is mostly chocolately, although there is a bit of coffee in it. The predominant taste, however, is coffee. There is the flavor of something else, but I can't place my finger on it(someone said tobacco- I wouldn't know but that's interesting...). The mouthfeel is great, it's not too watery or syrupy (juuuust right). Overall, it's a great beer. I plan on keeping it in my fridge, and for once my boyfriend will not complain about the space it takes up."
"D - exceptional - easy drinking and great tasting."
"Looks like a stout in the glass. Pours to a jet black body hosting a deep fat dark tan head at an inch and a half. Head has nice staying power but leaves no lace. Nose is inviting with balanced sweet malt and smokey richness. As you take first sip you get a bitter richness. As the palate opens up you get a slight soured maltieness. Twords the end of the palate you get unique mineral like notes that almost resemble raw tabacco. There is a long toffee like richness to the mouthfeel, very thick. This is truely a ""robust"" porter, as it drinks like a stout, oatmeal maybe. Well done and a joy to drink."
"Thick, creamy, hoppy, roasty, bottomline, it's awesome. This will be a staple in my fridge."
"D: This was intended to be the last bottle I had before packing it in for the night, but it is leaving me with a bit of a craving for another. A positive thing, I suppose, even if I don't give into it!"
"""Robust"" is a very good adjective to describe this outstanding porter... an all-around, top-notch American depiction of the style... one of the best I've ever sampled... Copped a single 12 oz bottle from Gary's in Madison for $2.25... great deal, as this wonderful sample pours a deep, dark, opaque, jet-black, ebony hue with a reddish-tan head with some lacing... deep, dark, rich choclate, espresso-like aroma, very strong, penetrating, and satisfying.... wonderful flavor - robust to say the least, thick, creamy, with roasted malts, dark-espresso, burnt-chocolate and ebony latte taste... the relatively light 5.7% ABV cancels out any unwanted alcohol interference in the flavor and leaves you with an exceptionally wonderful taste with a slight bitterness that is overshadowed by elegant coffee flavors... good mouthfeel with water-like drinkability that goes down easily and effortlessly... could drink this stuff all night... really top-notch... Definitely recommended..."
"The beer poured a rich black with a tan head. The aroma was of bitter malt and hops. The taste was of coffee malt with some nice hints of dark fruits in the background. The feel is just about perfectly wet and dry. I may have just found a new favorite porter. Definately one I will be having in the future."
"I'm usually not a porter fan, an exceptional one will usually get my due appreciation. This one: plausible."
"D = Highly drinkable. This is a very flavorful American porter with a great mouthfeel. Just a good all around experience to drink it."
"Had on tap at Union Brewhouse. Poured a dark black with small light tan head that disappeared quickly. Lots of sweet chocalate malty smell. Very easy to recognize. Taste is sharp yet sweet, not too bitter. Good full flavor, and not too malty which I like. Very drinkable, as the flavor is full, but it seems somewhat thin on the palate. Good Beer!"
"M/D: Full bodied, carbonation is pretty high, drinkability is good on this one. Aside from the taste, this one could easily pass as a stout."
"Drinkability: Tasty, balanced."
"I really enjoy this beer. In my opinion it really captures what a porter should be; fairly light mouth feel with a great roasted malt complexity. There is a nice balance of hop bitterness and residual sweetness that isn't overpowered by the roasted flavors. Essentially a great beer with great drink ability."
"drinkability - Won a golden medal at the GABF? What one? I wouldn't rank this the best porter. Seems that it is #6 for an American porter. I guess I like Baltic porters. Don't get me wrong, easy drinking beer, might be the one of the best American porters out there. I thought it was above average."
"Pours pitch black with a nice sized tan head. Nose is dusty chocolate. Beautiful. Flavor is smooth and hearty and never waivers. Nice even malt characters with a smoky, earthy edge. Definite coffee and cocoa tones. Feel is great. Nice and appropriate level of bubble on the tongue. Thicker liquid feel. Definitely drinkable. A good example of the style."
"D_This is a good sessionable porter from Smuttynose. Well done with the alcohol % and nicely bitter as I enjoy my porters."
"No other dark beers besides Guinness at the Irish pub I was at? No problem! Smuttynose Porter was a big surprise for me. Let's see...the beer's big, black, and bold, the aroma is soft with dark chocolate, and the taste is quite sweet with more chocolate, molasses, and a brush-up of hop leaf in the finish. The aftertaste is mildly roasted. It's easy to put down, as I could have easily had a few more pints of it. Nicely done!"
"In other words, pretty much everything I was expecting it would be. A solid porter"
"Nice, nostalgic label too."
"Drinkability: For a beer that reportedly ""expired"" in June of 2007, it was excellent. It this is what it's like when it's 7 months old, I would love to try this beer fresh. This is one beer that I'm sure I will enjoy again in the near future. As a matter of fact, I wish I had another one right now."
"Mouthfeel is lacking some of the creamy consistencies I expected. The carbonation comes off as what I can only describe as prickly and enhances the acidic flavors. Close to what I would describe as sessionable, but the acidic flavors (as I've frequently mentioned) come off as overbearing and I would have difficulty trying to finish a second bottle."
"Drinkability is very good. A very rich and flavorful porter, that is easy to drink. Good stuff!"
"When I initially opened the bottle of this the aroma of this beer seemed to right at my face. It's dark.. very dark with a reddish tinge to it. A really enjoyable dark beer where the hop bitterness doesn't deter you from taking another gulp right after the previous one. Great for winter. I'd say it could be a little more alcoholic to complement the rest of the flavors, but I don't think that's what they were going for. Overall very good, I'm going to buy more."
"Overall: A very delicious porter. Darker than most I have seen, and very similar to a stout. Very similar to the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout, just not quite as bitter and thick. A very good winter release."
"This is one great porter in my opinion. Not a lot of complexity to the taste or the auroma but still very good none the less."
"Got this in a trade from lefthandedrighty. Poured a super black with 2 fingeres of foamy latte head. Aroma of espresso, chicory. Nice porter taste- espresso, bitter coffee bean. Milk chocolate on the nose with somewhat of a thin mouthfeel. Touch of caramel in the body with a nice warming hop finish. I liked this one a lot."
"D - Very rich, flavorful, roasty, dry and spicy w/ a hop zest. A very drinkable and robust porter. The quaffability of this ale is high, a nice robust offering from Smuttynose."
"I have found the consummate American porter. Smuttynose gave an apt description by calling it robust, because that is exactly what it is. The heavy roasted malts, burnt dark chocolate flavor, lots of coffee bean flavor, and just the right amount of hops create a wonderfully complex and satisfying drinking experience. The mouthfeel is medium-thick and creamy. You don't have to sip it, but you'll want to savor it for as long as possible. Excellent job, and another real gem by Smuttynose."
"Alright, I don't get the fuss about this beer. It poured black into my glass with a short head that receded to a very thin film. The smell was a sweet sort of dark malt that's pretty much par for a modern porter. The taste is a pretty simple deep roast, and it turns bitter very quickly. Not very complex or ""robust"". I'm not impressed with this beer or others of its style (Mocha Porter, Anchor Porter) - they're just too bitter and not very drinkable for me."
"Thanks to citrusjim for this one."
"The first thing to say about this beer is that it is most definately robust. Extremely dark pour with a thick caramel colored head. The aroma is strong smelling of sweet malt and hints of coffee and a little caramel. Very roasted nutty flavor with a very bitter but refreshing finish. Aftertaste is very good. The roasted flavor really comes out wiht a very coffee-like flavor. The finish is very clean and very bitter. If I were an alcoholic, I would heat this up and drink it for breakfast. Definately very drinkable if you like this type of beer."
"Sample at Firewaters in Atlantic City. Dark brown color with a medium light tan head and streaks of lacing. Coffee, hops and a touch of chocolate in the nose. Rich body with a well-balanced array of flavors from bitter coffee and hops to roasted malt and chocolate. The finish is dry with a roasted coffee flavor and lingering hops. Pretty good all around."
"Overall an excellent porter and a great brew for SN."
"The Smuttynose Porter poured dark brown topped by a medium sized tan head with limited retention. It has a rich roasty aroma with chocolate and coffee notes that blend well with a mild hop background. The taste is certainly robust with strong dark malt flavors that are only mildly tempered by hops and followed by a moderately bitter and semi-dry finish. Overall, I found the Smuttynose Robust Porter to be a bit of a dissapointment. It looks good and smells great, but the mouthfeel was thinned by a prickly carbonation and the taste seemed a bit too acrid and burnt for my taste."
"Pours a deep brown mahogany with a minimal dark tan head that doesn't leave much lacing. Smells of roasted coffee, lightly malty and wonderfully chocolately. Taste is much like the smell, which was, of course, excellent. Roastyness its dominant, but also present are a bitterness derived from the roast and a pleasant malty and chocolate flavors. In my opinion the roastyness is a bit too intense and somewhat overpowers the other flavors but this is still great. Mouthfeel is good, medium body, and low-moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, as mentioned before the only problem that I perceive is the overwhelming roasty character but then again thats just my opinion. I'd certainly recommend this beer and will definitely have this again."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied with a quite a bit of a creamy carbonation that never becomes biting, and the drinkability is good, but with the big coffee flavors might be a bit hard to drink more than a couple."
"Pours an opaque black with a nice tan colored head. The aroma is intense, with a huge roastiness, along with some belgian chocolate, some toasted bread, slightly fruity esters, and a touch of resiny hops. The flavor is equally impressive, with notes of espresso, gourmet dark chocolate, burnt bread, dark fruits (plum and date), some mild resiny hops and a touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy without being overbearing, and the drinkability is exceptional. A great porter from Smuttynose, one of the best for sure."
"An aptly named brew from a Brewery that I don't pay enough attention to. Pours a deep brown without heaps of carbonation, even when poured from a decent height. Bouquet is dominated by hops and malty sweetness. Tastes, well, great... complex, well rounded, roasted malty sweetness with enough hops to keep you on your toes. Would like to do a blind taste test with this and a few of my other favorite porters. This could very well become a staple fridge beer."
"D- A very drinkable brew. Much better than most American porters I've tried recently."
"Pours near-black with a medium tan head that leaves a touch of lace on the glass. The nose is predominantly coffee and chocolate, with lots of bitter-smelling roasted malt notes and a touch of fruity American hops lurking in the background. It definitely fits its billing -- classic porter, but more robust. On the palate, this pattern is repeated, with classic porter notes like burnt coffee bitterness and fragrant hops meshing into a package with a bit of a rough mouthfeel. Again, classic flavors and mouthfeel turned up to 10, if not 11. Well integrated and well executed."
"Pours black with a 2 finger light cocoa head that retains a laces sheets nicely. Smells of roasted malt, molassas and bit of hop. Taste is delicious. Big malt, molassas, a hint of coffee grounds and a little hop bite at the end. Medium in the mouth with a nice tickle from carbonation. Awesome drinkability. A nice robust porter full of great flavors. Try it and enjoy."
"Give it a shot!"
" pick this beer up, enjoy it, review it. its a very solid beer"
"A fantastic porter in all facets and a true representative of the style. The boys up in New Hampshire sure got this one right."
"12oz bottle with a freshness date of July 07. Color is of the darkest brown and almost black. Very dark mahogany at the edges when held to light. Tan head with various sized bubbles looks creamy and appetizing. Aromas of lime and grapefruit citrus from the hops and fantastic dark chocolate, cocoa with milk, and mellow roast coffee aromas from the malt . A faint dried fig fruitiness rounds out the nose. Flavor is more of the same but with the alcohol note hitting a perfect chord with the other flavors. Smooth medium mouthfeel with C02 bubbles bursting on your tongue. Hands down my favorite porter. A real highlight of New England brewing prowess. Keep cold for a pronounced citrus flavor or let it warm to bring out more dark chocolate, dried fig and roasted malt. Very versatile with meals, it goes great with spicey foods when ice cold because it has a Negra Modelo with a lime wedge vibe. Let it warm up a bit to pair with chocolate desserts. A very easy beer to drink all night long and not get tired of. The list of exceptional beers from Smuttynose is long and Robust Porter is at the top."
"Pours a deep dark color with a brown head. Strong aroma with hints of coffee and chocolate. Taste is rich and smooth with the hints of coffee and chocolate. Creamy mouthfeel that leads to a dry finish. Very well balanced porter. Not too much of a stretch to say that it's one of the better porters I've had in a while."
"Overall, I like this beer as a lighter alternative when I want something dark, but not quite as heavy as, say, a Russian Imperial Stout. I'll certainly get it again, especially considering that it's less expensive than a lot of other American microbrews."
"Pour is very close to black with some brown/ruby highlights on the outside of the glass. Lower carbonation and big tan/orange head that slowly fades. Smell is of roasted malts, coffee being the most present along with some chocolate. Definitely a sweet side to it. Taste is very well balanced. I like coffee so I guess that doesn't hurt for me. It packs more flavor than the usual porter that I find somewhat watered down. This one doesn't lack in any department, so robust is a good word. Mouthfeel isn't as full as I'd expect based on flavor. A little light and clean are the first things that come to mind, though it's not bad at all. Overall good drinkability. I would consider this a fine porter, just below the best and above the average. I'd almost put it up there with the King Coconut but not quite."
"This one is just not to my taste. The main problem is that there is just too much patent malt flavor without anything to balance it."
"Ahhh porter!!! I dont think I've had something this drinkable since Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald or Bell's Porter. Great smooth caramel malt flavor with a great roasty bite. If you dig a good roasty bite this beer is definitely for you. If i didnt just write up a recipe for a porter i'd probably buy a case of this stuff."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice small creamy tan head, some nice sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is malty, slightly roasted, nice dose of toffee and caramel. The taste is very delicious, malty, roasty, lots of toffee/caramel. The finish is slightly dry. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty Porter. Smuttynose does it again. Highly recommended."
"D - This is a very good porter. A good blend of sweet malts and chocolate that is complimented by a coffee bitterness."
"Nice thickness. Dry. Leaves a thick film. Still, underlying smoothness. Not too ashy. Overall it's a nice, dry, well-crafted porter. Flavorful and complex. Not to strong that repeats are unwelcome."
"D- Smooth and easy-drinking. A little too heavy on the chocolate for my tastes, but still quite good. Would definitely have again."
"Overall: Surely a solid porter that is definately Robust. Complex roasted flavor profile."
"Damn, this sucker is robust all right. So much so it reminds me of stouts I've had more than porters. There's a big coffee and bitterness with a touch of grapefruit hops flavors. The main flavor is a sweet and smooth cocoa that's just as rich in my mind as Rogue's Chocoate Stout, but backed with a greater bitter punch."
"Great label, served in a plain pint glass. Incredibly dark, ruby-black color with a milk chocolate head. Malty aroma. Flavor is a great, complex mix of malt, dark chocolate, and coffee. Slightly bitter aftertaste, yet very smooth. This is a delicious porter, probably the best I've tried in the class."
"Mouthfull is sweet and full-bodied. Very drinkable. I really enjoyed this beer."
"A must try porter. One of my favorites, love this beer!!"
"O - A bit hoppier and more acidic than this style often shows, I still like this take on it. Granted, I know of a few other porters that I would grab first, but I'd still say this is a good, sessionable beer."
"Surprising body & flavour for its weight. A little age doesn't seem to have hurt this at all!"
"I love this offering from Smuttynose and it hits the style on the nose as a great porter.Taste great but more filling.I will have again"
"Tasty and easy to drink and enjoy, a fine example of the style, and another fine Smuttynose offering. I have yet to be disappointed in their brews. It does have a pronounced roasted smokiness, and as such likely not the best choice for a gateway porter, but this is a very good choice that i would recommend to fans of the style."
"Overall: a damn chocolaty and damn good porter. I think I would have to put it up with my favorites. I love when they can get that almost minty tang in chocolaty beers. A session porter."
"12oz bottle drank from a pint glass. Pours a dark brown with some lighter shades throughout. No head to speak of. Smell is roasted malts with some hoppyness coming through. Taste is really good, if it wasnt for the hops. The underlying porter has a very roasty, smooth, coffee and chocolate thing going on with an incredible mouthfeel. The flavor from the hops is taking away from that. A very good beer that I wish I could sample without the hop profile."
"Deep brown color is only noticeable at the edges of the glass; otherwise it looks black. Topped by a moderate light brown head that fades to a small ring of foam. Aroma is fairly clean, with a hint of molasses and malt. Flavor is strong on black malt flavors, and has a great espresso note. Slight hints of dark chocolate covered raisins also peek through. Bitterness shows in the finish, but grudgingly gives way to the strong espresso flavors once again. Mouthfeel is solid, but not special in any way. Drinkability is pretty good - overall balance works well. A nice porter."
"Drinkability - Keep them coming!"
"All in all, this porter has a great smell, but not much else IMO. Sad, I was looking forward to this one after picking it up."
"D: Whew...quite enjoyable! Aggressive flavors, a bold porter in most every way. This one I enjoyed sipping on for the better part of an hour, just savoring that dark chocolate flavor - who needs dessert when you could have this? Thankfully, I have one more bottle to enjoy, but big thanks to Jeff for this one. Highly recommended!"
"D---A great winter warmer. I highly recommend it to anyone that likes a dark porter or stout."
"There isn't a single thing I don't like about this. One of my favorite porters and I really should stock up on it."
"I love it. This is my first time with this beer, but I'm head-over-heels."
"Taste is much bigger, good roasted malts, lots of espresso and coffee grounds, the chocolate is subtle but delicious, a great composition. The mouth is smooth, carbonations is slightly up, a little thinnish but still plenty full. The finish is long lasting and dry. Overall, this is a fantastic brew, the best offering by Smutty as far as I'm concerned."
"An awesome porter that is rich and smooth. True to style and well crafted."
"D: Solid all-around. This one's a keeper."
"I like this one as a session porter. One of the better offerings from a solid brewery. If you like porters, you will like this one, for sure."
"D- It is decent. Nothing amazing but it is a nice porter."
"Smuttynose comes up with another winner. A very likeable, drinkable porter. Its bigness of flavor makes it drink like a big beer even though the ABV is modest. Mmm mmm good."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color porter with a nice foamy head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of rich roasted malt is quite powerful and interesting. Taste of rich bitter roasted malt is domination and enjoyable. Creamy texture with some medium carbonation and good full body provide even further enjoyment of this fine beer. I would have like a bit more chocolate malt to offset some of the bitterness but apart from that this is a fine beer."
"I feel this is one top of the line brewery."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable, I could easily session this during colder days. This is probably my favorite porter, I really wish it was around all year."
"Friday night at home, Netflix movie (Miami Vice. Don't bother). Had some porters in the fridge, and really liked this one. A dark brown color with a coffee-colored head that dissipated quickly. Rich chocolate aroma. A chocolate, espresso flavor. I thought it was quite rich, and fun to drink."
"An awesome Porter. Great color, smell, and taste. A great combination of coffee and light chocolate flavors with a really smooth feel throughout. The drinkability is really high for a Porter. I wanted to order another, but there were so many taps at The Horseshoe Pub, I had to try something different. Gotta love Smuttynose."
"Big and tasty, but flavor zeroes in on chocolate a little too dramatically. But if I were in the mood for a sweeter beer, I could definitely down a few of these as the flavor is nice if a bit sweet."
"drinkability is great too. excellent balance between the bitterness, malt, and alcohol. the alcohol is almost completely hidden. a very tasty and drinkable porter. definitely will pick this one up again."
"D- Big beer that doesn't dissapoint. This is an excellent nightcap to wrap up a very festive Christmas Day 2006. Merry Christmas and a happy New Year to all!"
"Drinkability - This is just another great beer from Smuttynose. Like the name implies, this porter's flavors are indeed robust. Definitely pay this porter a visit if you haven't yet; I plan on revisiting it many times myself. Cheers!"
"This beer was poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Admittedly, the beer was slightly colder than I would have liked. The beer is very dark brown with a slight reddish hue and a 1/4 inch dark tan head. It has a very strong roasted aroma that I'm sure would be even stronger if the beer was served at the proper temperature. The taste is heavily roasted with a very clean finish. There is low carbonation and the beer is very heavy as it should be for a robust porter. The drinkibility is very high for this beer and I drink it often. This is a beer that I search for at the beverage center."
"Nice smooth finish and a wonderful beer to drink, no matter if it's cold outside or not. A great beer that lives up to its name."
"D: Very tasty, not as filling as most porters, goes down very easily, this beer is an excellent representation of style and one of my favorite porters. I haven’t had a bad beer from Smuttynose yet."
"Tastes of nice dark roasty malt - caramel and coffee. Just a bit of carbonation to add to the overall strong flavors. This brew is quite enjoyable. I could drink a few of these in a sitting - one of my favorite porters that comes in a sixer."
" I wish this beer was available year round, if it was-I may have found a new Porter. For now, anyway-I'll get my hands on all that I can."
"Black bodied beer. Thin creamy brown head. It recedes quickly but the bubbly collar left behind leaves some spotty lace as I drink. Thick nose of coffee bean, chocolate, roasted malts, vanilla and crystal malts. This is a real Meat and Potatos beer. Thick flavor of roasted malts and dark chocolate. Dry cocoa aftertaste lingers long. Mouthfeel could use a little boost. But it's not bad overall. This beer has a lot of flavor. It's one I'd drink quite a bit more of in the future."
"A Robust Thanks to Sir BigHuge for this one."
"Overall: One of the best porter's I've ever tasted. Smuttynose makes some great stuff, and this is one of their finest offerings."
"It has a thick, but very smooth, mouthfeel, but goes down easy. It's a very drinkable beer, one of the best porter's I've had."
"On cask this week at Andy's, poured out a super dark brown with a creamy tan head. The nose offerers pollen, honey suckle, citronella, coffee, floral hops, ember, and chalk. The taste goes in a completely different direction, I get tabasco and jalepeno notes, supported by chocolate, malt, and smoke. Has a very heavy mouthfeel."
"D: Hell yes. This is a great beer. Really flavorful, really big flavors, and really, really enjoyable. A beer I would buy by the case. Well done."
"Drinkability: Robust is right...a complex and big American Porter. Definitely one of the big hitters for this style in my opinion."
"The drinkability is good but the strong burnt taste holds it back some. Prosit, MK"
"Pairs well with Gorgonzola, the earth and smoke character stands up well to the earthy richness of the cheese."
"Cheers!"
"By far, THE best porter I have ever had. Smuttynose has absolutely NAILED it with this one here. A Masterpiece. Obviously, I cannot say enough about this brew. Robust Porter...what a perfectly apt name."
"If you like your Porter's to have an attitude like they could kick your Dad's ass, then this is the Porter for you. Do seek it out, this is the most unique Porter I've had so far."
"Musings: First time for this one and I wasn't disappointed. Borders on a good oatmeal stout."
"excellent flavors. very hoppy, but whats new for SN. finishes a bit chalky and dry, and that might be my only real criticism here. there are some nice burnt dark chocolate cake flavors mingling with the traditional hoppy stout metallic twang. this is really drinkable as well for something bursting like a supernova with such powerful flavor. when i want to drink a few flavorful, dark beers but don't want the kick of an RIS.. i will certainly turn to this. kinda bummed that i didn't pick up a sixer. will have to remedy that."
"Smutty Robust Porter pours a deep inky black, even holding it up to a light, scarcely a bit of light shines through. A half inch of dark brown head sits on top. Smell is roasted malts as well as a sweet caramel aroma. Taste is a nice bitter roasted punch up front with a nice sweet caramel malt flavor balancing it out. There is a nice fresh roasted malt taste in the finishand aftertaste, an almost coffee like flavor. The hops are hidden, beaten back by all the malty flavor. Another great offering from Smutty, robust is a the best word I can think of for it."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- I love the unique ""coffee soda"" qualities, including the sublime mouthfeel... it's smooth yet well carbonated, but really tame. From beginning to end, it livens up and quiets down in perfect succession, feeling just right for this beer. This is boldly flavored and is drinking mighty well on its own, but next time you can bet there'll be a piece of tiramisu right by its side."
"The other beer I bought in Conway today, good stuff. Pours pitch black with a frothy foamy head. Smells like charred malt. Tastes the same with some nice bitterness to it, a very faint lingering sweetness to it. Good mouthfeel. A real treat from Smuttynose, love these guys, maybe I should plant me and the family to New Hampshire."
"-Oelergud"
"D- I like porters as an end-of-the-night beer. Good for after a big fat steak."
"Drinkability: Flavorful and well-balanced; very nice"
"Wow, that's a dark beer. Black with no highlights to speak of. Dense, creamy head that's about half an inch off a vigourous pour and leaves thick lacing at each sip - too bad it didn't last longer. Malty aroma with a nice mix of roasted, caramel, and (lots of) chocolate character, but what sets it apart is the way the hops peek through and round things out. The taste is solid, but falls a little flat compared to the aroma. Nice and malty, with a hint of roast, mild chocolate, and a burnt bitterness that lingers on the palate. Hop flavour and bitterness are present, but restrained. Creamy carbonation, off-dry, with a round body. This is quite a good porter, definitely one that I recommend to porter lovers out there."
"Wow, this looks like a robust porter. Half an inch of light brown head, with a black completely opaque body. Smells roasty and malty with a hint of hop. Tastes roasty and malty, coffee-like with a hint of hop. This is an excellent porter. Medium to full in body and extremely tasty. One of the best porters I've ever had."
"D: This was easy to drink, but not my idea of a sessioner. More like something you'd bring out at a tasting; it would make a good palate-cleanser, since its distinct flavors don't linger."
"This is one good porter!!"
"Overall? Fantastic."
"The pour raises a one finger dark tan head, with quick sudsy lacing slowly falling into an opaque black body. The nose is immensely roasty, and filled with coffee, chocolate, and a bit of sweet caramel. Now, with these two areas rated, I'm definitely not prepared for the horror of the rest of the beer. Taste is like a sugared espresso, with a licorice note. Very bitter throughout, mildly acidic dry finish. The bitterness builds to extreme levels, and the licorice flavor becomes unbearable over time. The mouthfeel is far too thin for the intense flavors, I feel. This was a horrible beer, perhaps a bad bottle, but certainly a drain pour."
"Poured dark, dark black. I thought Guinness was dark...this is pitch black. Smells very rich with sweet roasted coffee tones. Taste is very powerful, almost too strong with a bitter aftertaste. Very rich flavor. Mouthfeel and drinkability are excellent. Excellent porter overall."
"D: Very tasty porter, thanks to snilsen for this one. Would be a good late fall/winter beer."
"Edit: years later, this remains a regular choice.  It's still a really great beer."
"This is a full bodied beer with a nice creamy consistency. Great mouthfeel and balance of flavors render this brew a good, drinkable porter."
"Overall an excellent porter. Very drinkable and highly recommended."
"D: Probably the best example of an American Porter I've had. Smuttynose just can't go wrong. Highly recommended."
"Medium-full body, moderate carbonation. Smooth, and creamy going down. As far as aroma & taste go, this is maybe one of the more roasty porters I have ever had. Great balance...all of the flavors come together nicely, with nothing being heavy handed. A porter this good, I could easily down a few of in an evening."
"GO BUCKS"
"It's stands alongside porters such as Eddy Fitz as paramont in the American class."
"Mouthfeel is medium-light, very smooth. ""Robust"" is quite an accurate description for this as it's like a porter with the volume turned up (without the ABV hike). I could definitely session this."
"D: Now thats a porter. Deep, complex, chocolatey and roasted. Great porter. Another good beer traded by JeffKrenner"
"Overall, a GREAT porter that is worthy of a try. I happen to like most of Smuttynose's beer, and this is definitely one of their top styles. Good for winter, but the light body makes it a nice change of pace during the summer as well."
"Drinkability: A very solid example of the style, though the risk factor could be amped up and make this a stupendous beer. Still, a great example of a style that's very tasty and easy to drink."
"Pours a pitch black liquor with a molases colored, creamy, 4 finger head? The head actually holds too, and there is noticale yeast at the bottom, meaning this ages well despite being three months past date. Impressive pour. Smells of slight alcohol and of american hops, cocoa, deep aromas, a little grassy as well. A unique aroma that I fail to be able to articulate. Taste is complex, fully and charred. Starts smoooth and sweet, and evolves into a roasty charred finish with the hops spiking in the aftertaste. Noticable hop zing after the malt has shown it's complex character. Mouthfeel is good on carbonation, full bodied, hearty and prefect for a porter. Overall I prefer anchor porter, but this is a contender worth drinking. I just avoid beers that are noticably charred in general, but I'll probably return here occasionaly anyway because it's just tasty. A great beer."
"Many thanks to BA JeffKrenner for the surprise package-o-beer."
"A bit thin body."
"Pours a very dark almost opague coffee brown. Had a one finger head that dissipated slowly. Smell was lots of coffee and chocolate with some nice orange/citrus hopiness in the background. Some licorice and slight alcohol on the nose. Flavor was a little harsh I felt for a porter... guess that's why it's a robust porter. Lots of roasted barley, coffee astringency with some notes of chocolate and licorice. The hop flavor and bitterness was very mild and hidden from the roasted barley. Very drinkable beer however, I just was expecting something a little smoother. Once I got used to it, it was very good, and drank two more :)"
"This is a nice porter with a meaty, bold flavor. There are not many better examples of the style."
"Can't really smell much but there is some warming alcohol and burnt molasses smells. Tastes real smooth and drinkable. Plum, licorice, and molasses come to mind as I quaff this beer. Good full malt flavor with a little alcohol to take the sweetness off. This beer probably ages well. My beer was bottled in January and it's late June right now and still good. Smooth like the hot asphalt oozing in my driveway."
"Drinkability: The beer is another good creation from Smuttynose, one that you could easily consume without a second thought."
"A solid porter, for sure."
"This is definitely quite drinkable. More than anything though, it just makes me want an Edmund Fitz from the fridge. I like that beer too much, though."
"Pours black,with a frothy tan head. Great retention and lacing. Aroma is of chocolate, carmel, roasted malt,and nut. Body is mediumn not much carbionation. Taste is smooth,but smokey up front, with a nice refreshing finish. This is great stuff! recommended!"
"Drinkability: Top-notch flavor, and offers, quite simply, well-rounded excellence. Leaves me longing for more. Harmony of flavor, enticing aromas, and pleasing on the tongue. Extraordinary."
"very fruity aromas mix in with the dark malts. the hop flavor is significant and melds very successfully with malt flavors, just like in the aroma. it's an eathy hop flavor, and the bitterness is moderate. mild black malt flavors, but i don't know that it's all that robust; i could drink plenty of these"
"D: Nice moderate alcohol and excellent balanced flavors make this a great brew. I would drink several yet sadly I only have this one. Thanks to warriorsoul for letting me try this fine porter..."
"A very nice entry into the Porter category."
"."
"Reminds me quite a bit of Anchor porter... or rather, the Anchor porter I had that wasn't the freshest. This is a fine choice for when in the mood for a deep flavored brew."
"D- The malt flavors are nice and robust but the tart notes are a little odd and with the hops at the finish they kind of class. Good malt profile and an interesting beer."
"1/2 gallon growler filled at Consumer's Beverage Center in Williamsville. Deep, black-coffee brown with an incredibly dense burnt sienna foam cap, just thick as all get out. Aromas of roasted malts abound: coffee, toasted cocoa powder, faint smoke scent, and an earthy compost hop presence. Taste is predominantly burnt toffee and black patent malts -- a smoky and earthy hop flavor emerges near the end right before a wonderfully smooth and bitter finish. Aftertaste of dark roasted espresso beans. Mouthfeel is quite silky, but not too thick. Medium-thin body. Stupidly drinkable. Can't say I'd ever pass this one up as an option for a growler to take to a party (which is exactly where I consumed this sucker -- yeah, I'm a dork, I took notes on a beer at a party...)"
"Mouth: Wow! The taste matches the nose (but way stronger) and look 100%. It's like drinking a chilled coffee with a beer's excellent carbonation and balance. Sweet, sour, bitter... nice finish in the swallow with some sugary toffee flavor in the malt that's a little faint but works to balance out the coffee bitterness. I love this beer!"
"This ones just way to smoky for me to really enjoy. If smoky is your thing, youll be in heaven."
"Drinkability:A nice dark roasted porter that starts strong and finishes smoky and smooth. Not my favorite type of beer but I'd definintely keep a couple in the frig for those occasions when I want a change for the typical stoudts."
"wow, this is very nice. i mean, its very good for the category. good for what it is. that being said, its not going to winover any non-stout drinkers, but for us lovers out there, we'll all be happy. again, that being said, its not at all super, incrediblle sweet, super chocolate dude beer but, i mean it is what is. good stuff."
"D: Oh yes, this is one of those beers that you need to try, asap. It deserves a place in every beer lover's fridge."
"pours out a near black beer with slight ruby highlights.smell of licorice but not overbearing,,very nice smell.taste is pretty dry,,coffee and licorice,,not very complex.mouth feel is pretty bad,,very watery.not a bad beer pretty drinkable,,but nothing outstanding at all about it."
"This arrived with a big, fluffy, deep-tan/light-brown head. The beer was really dark, with very little light able to pass through it. The nose was very roasty, like coffee, but with an underlying malty sweetness. The mouthfeel was thick and full, almost creamy. There was an immediate sensation of roasted coffee beans on the palate. The finish was also roasty, but with a lingering charcoal taste, which I dislike (sorry). This drank more like a stout than a porter. I'm down with it, but not as a session beer."
"Drinkability & Notes: I truly do wish that I had gotten more than one of these, as I could see drinking a few of these. However, a few is where I'd max it out. What a great beer, easily the best porter I've yet to have, and has certainly justified this as one of my favorite styles. Another spot on beer from Smuttynose."
"This is certainly one of the best porters I've had. It pours dark black with an inviting, solid, tan head that linger through the drink. The smell is rich. Its aroma is that of strong coffee and chocolate with a bitter touch. The taste is simply delicious, and reflects the smell nearly perfectly - coffee, chocolate and a nice citrus touch. It has a full body, but exceptionally smooth mouthfeel. I can drink plenty of this - disappears ""too"" quickly - in any time of the year!"
"Drinkability: Like i said above, the consistency is a little light, but that adds to it's drinkability. The major set back is the incredible robust nature of this porter, which I find to be a little over the top."
"A very dark brown,nearly black, beer with deep mahogony highlights. Has a big foamy brown head with good lace. The aroma has a sweet nut like character at first. Then a roasted coffee note come thru with a hint of floral hops in the background. The nut like sweetness comes and goes lightly throughout the taste. The dominating character is however the roasted malts with some bittersweet chocolate and a shot of esspresso snap. The finish is clean and sharp."
"This beer makes me say 'mmm porter.'"
"The taste is a smooth roasted malt flavor, mixed in with some very nice hop bitterness in the back. The flavors definitely come out as the beer warms. I liked this porter very much. Very well done."
"Overall a fine treat acquired from warriorsoul in Mass. I'd liken this to an Edmund Fitzgerald, but with more of a coffee/hoppy blast. Truly a big porter that's not shy to make its mark. I'll certainly make this an annual beer trade must."
"Nearly opaque with a huge imperial like tan-brown head. Aroma is strong and full with wonderful wisps of chocolate, French roast coffee, peanuts, and hex. Taste lets down jut a notch from the huge aroma but its still quite enjoyable. Aggressive coffee and hex nut are the dominant flavors. Mouthfeel is full, rich, smooth, drying in the finish, and mildly astringent. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Give me a cool spring or fall evening, a sweatshirt, a deck chair and a sixer of this!"
"Other porters beware! Cuz there's a new sherriff a-comin'."
"Delicious stuff here. Will give any other porter a run for its money."
"Drinkability  Really good for one or two but not a session porter. Solid choice in the style."
"Full bodied, but a little oily. Assertive carbonation. Very tasty and quite drinkable."
"Picked this one at at Bauer in Boston. This is one heck of a deal for a six pack around $8. Beer pours a true black, not translucent at all and with no red hues , also a medium chesnut head. Smells are not exploding from this one but roasted goodness is detectable. Taste and mouth feel are where this one excels. Easily drinkable but not going to sit here and pound, great for one or two and read or watch a movie. Another great offering from Smutty."
"Notes: EXCELLENT beer"
"The only other American Porter that I've enjoyed as much as this one is Anchor's. This version is more intense and hoppy with a bigger roasted malt character. A classic; nearly flawless!"
"				~Benjamin Franklin"
"Another great brew from Smutty!"
"Poured out of the bottle and a deep, dark colour with a healthy head filled the glass. I smelled the left-over beer in the bottle and an aroma of cocoa quickly filled my nose. In terms of taste, the cocoa translated easily. I could also taste malts with a bit of hop. The porter feels light and sweet, and going down, you feel a nice, hoppy sensation. In terms of cooking, the porter easily complimented my hamburger. In fact, I had three porters and I felt really good afterwards."
"Poured a dark, dark brown with a mocha colored head that was very thick and left behind lovely lacing. Bubbly and intense, the head didn't go anywhere for quite awhile. Aromas of caramel, chocolate, alcohol, and toasted bread. Roasted malt flavors dominated the taste, but the other flavors worked well; caramel and semi-sweet chocolate. Somewhat creamy and yet dry with a slightly sour finish. Good for the style. Good drinkability."
"Drinkability -- Exceptional! After having only one bottle two weeks ago I ran out and bought two more 6-packs. This is a great porter! I just wish it was available year-round. Oh well . . . exceptional offering from Smuttynose! Highly recommended."
"A really interesting and well-crafted porter/stout from Smutty. I had this with a porcini mushroom and garlic-laced burger a few weeks ago, and it complimented it nicely."
"Overall: A great deal for a solid porter."
"Poured a very deep brown, virtually black color with brown chunky monstrous head. Retention was excellent, as was the glue-like lacing on the side of the glass. Smell is deeply roated malt combined with strong black coffee, dark ripe fruit, and bittersweet chocolate. Hint of alcohol also present. Taste is roasted malt with a very enjoyable bitterness in the background. Finish is strong, bitter, and very robust. Very nice beer."
"Simply a wonderful porter. Seek it out."
"Robust...the name says it all. A damn good porter."
"At this point, I can't say that I understand the hubbub over this beer. I like it but I'm not crazy about it. Maybe that will change as I get more acquainted with it and have a few more."
"Notes: To sum it up, aptly named. My repetition of the word robust was obviously a joke however it really is the perfect word to describe this porter. Another great one from one of my favorite breweries."
"This pours a very dark brown with a large tan foamy head.The smell has a coffee and citrus aroma to it. It's not that strong,but you can pick it out. The taste has a real coffee and chocolate dominance to it. This is a very tasty beer. The m/f is medium and is very balanced. This is an outstanding porter and the best Smuttynose beer I have tried."
"M&D: Very nice, the accessible weight makes it very drinkable. An easy drinking but still very interesting beer. Well made."
"overall: what a kick ass porter, refined, and very flavorful, excellent balance, there's not much that smutty could do to make this one better. easily one of the best porters i've ever had."
"Overall- Damn fine Porter. 1 of the best I've ever had. Only nitpick is a slight detection of alcohol. Otherwise amazing!"
"Very drinkable. Very drinkable indeed. Seek this one out and hoard it!"
"D- Good drinkability. Very nice porter. I want another"
"Good stuff."
"Wow, one of the best selections I've tried from smuttynose. Recommended from my man at Colonial Spirits in Acton. Lets get to the beer. This beer pours a magnificent dark chocolate brown, and leaves a very thin tan lace that continues with the beer as you drink it. The smell is chocolate, caramel, coffee, dark fruit, and a piney leafy essence. As this beer hits the palate it hits you with a kick of espresso hopped chocolate bitterness and finishes with a smooth caramel fruit blast. This is one the best and most complex beers I've had from Smuttynose it is great and def recommended."
"In the end, I like a porter to be more traditional and distance itself from its little bother, stout. Yeah, you heard me correctly."
"Pours a thick, impenetrable black with two fingers of dark tan, rocky head. Nose is, uhh, robust with intense coffee, dark chocolate, woody vanilla notes and bourbon. Taste is as robust as the nose with roasted coffee grounds, baker's chocolate, earthy peat, toasted malt, bourbon barrel cask, and dark fruits. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth. Nice balance of sweet and bitter/roasted while keeping the palate interested. A big tasty porter here, I wish I could get my hands on some of Smutty's other stuff around here - guess I'll have to get it from Milwaukee as they're finally distributing there."
"Many thanks to Px2GrafX for the chance to try this."
"overall: definately a tasty porter, probably makes my top 5 of the style"
"overall: there are other ""robust"" porters out there, but this is the first truely robust one i've experienced. packed with flavor and super smooth, this gets a couple of thumbs from me."
"The brew's taste didn't exactly live up to my enthusiasm, but it was a nice, dry porter. There are tastes of coffee and toffee, with some spiciness. Cool. Interesting. It's well-balanced and drinkable to the last drop. Not my favorite in the style, but creative and enjoyable enough to try once in a while."
"Very enjoyable and very drinkable. If this was on tap now, I will be seeking this out in the Winter months to come for sure."
"I can just imagine sitting around a campfire in November drinking about a million of these. Very tasty, interesting beer. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability - This porter at first went down really easy. But as it warmed a bit, it got worse and worse."
"Smuttynose has delivered a truly ""robust"" porter with a black body and creamy orangeish tan head. The retention is quite good and it leaves some nice spots of lace about the glass. The nose expresses very dark cocoa, and a waft of espresso. In the mouth it's creamy and smooth with a medium body and fine-bubbled, moderate carbonation. The flavor is rich with dark, bittersweet chocolate; a berry-like and cherryish yeasty fruitiness; and some mild grassy & citrusy hops. It's backed by a solid bitterness, and it finishes bone dry with a mild, cold black coffee-like roastiness. Nicely done!"
"It was a regular at the LCBO for quite some time, but has since been in absentia. Shame."
"This baby pours an inch light brown head that sticks around for a bit. Lace paints the glass nicely and while it looks almost opaque, you can pick out a very deep and devious brown. The nose is light yet thick and woodsy, smells of bitter chocolate, grapefruits, and jet black coffee. Mouthfeel is medium and creamy. Taste is slightly sweet caramel coffee which immediately fights for mouthspace with the strong hops before finally giving in to their respective strengths and agreeing to disagree by striking a nice balance. It finishes with the hops having the final word and becoming a bully of an aftertaste...not too overwhelming though but quite enough to be considered ""robust"" and to make you chew on your own mouth for a bit. I could definitely down a sixer of these badboys no problem. Between this and Anchor porter for a mainstay in my fridge. Simply a great example of a porter."
"Coffee dominates the flavor. It is medium bodied yet dry with a crisp finish. Bitterness come at you from two directions- the hops and the abundance of roasted malt- yet it is not overdone. I wish I could say the same of the roasted malt acidity, which lingers in the finish -as well as a pleasant mocha quality. It's a good beer, though- just kind of, well, obvious."
"This is one of my many favorite beers - very drinkable, and very flavorful."
"Overall-after a dissapointing start Smuttynose's porter proves that it is indeed ""robust"" quite flavorful and full of chocolate and caramel flavor without any harshness. Fine porter to have by your side anytime."
"Taste starts off slightly milky, with a cool creamy sensation then transitions to a slightly bittersweet chocolatey mocha cappucino profile. Very smooth on the intake, a thick bodied brew. Very satisfying and a delicious porter, ranking up there with my favorites Sierra Nevada and Samuel Smith."
"I don't know if Robust Porter is a play on words, but this was one soft, subtle porter. It slid down so easy & nice, love the creamy aspect of it. This is a keeper. Not as flavorful as others, but certainly welcome in my glass again. This could be a great porter to introduce someone to porters with."
"After trying countless numbers of porters from around the world, I think that this is one of the best."
"Pretty drinkable and not bad in many categories, just not as robust as the name implies. Would like to see this suped up in their Big A series, though."
"The char & grapefruit remain in my mouth for minutes afterward. Different. Thought stimulating. If you like something different in the porter family that throws a curve at your tongue, give it a rip. There will be a return trip. Thankfully there are 5 more in the fridge."
"A very enjoyable liquid."
"This beer pours a very dark color with a small head that falls fast and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is very roasty with just a hint of chocolate and very low in the hops. The flavor is much the same, with a huge roasted character and small hints of chocolate. The mouthfeel is thick and the drinkability is great. This is very well done and extremely enjoyable."
"This brew departs the bottle a nice black color with a small head that falls to coathe the beer with a mice tan foam. The nose is really nice, with chocoalte and nice roasty malts being full and forward. I really like it. The flavor is just as nice. Huge roasty notes assault me. Not coffee, but nice roasted malrts. There is a bit of chocolate on the finish. I like it. The feel is big and thick, slight creamyness as well. Well balanced, good flavor..just a damn fine brew. This is one of the better porters I have had. Its right on par with the one from the Great Dane last weekend."
"Drinkability is high if you like this style...if you dig dark beers, you must try this offering from Smuttynose."
"This is the East Coast equivalent to Old Rasputin but with much less Alcohol. The beer is dark brown/black with red undertones. The head was minimal but the nose was all burnt malts and coffee. The taste was smooth and big with coffee to the front. A very wellmade porter that is closer to a stout in attack. Very drinkable."
"Saved this one for last from my smuttynose variety case. Just like the brown ale this one poured to have little head and no life at all. Big dissapointment in the appearance hopefully the taste will be better. Black brown in color and gives off the typical porter smell of roasted malt and chocolate. Taste the same as it smells with a nice hop bite to it. Not one of the best porters i've ever had but an ok porter is better than a pale ale any day."
"Excellent beer. I think this is my highest rating for an American beer to date."
"extremely dark brown bodering on total blackness, with a milk chocolate head that tops off at about 1"" and has some insane staying power. deep roasted malt aroma with notes of cocoa and dark roasted coffee. lightly carbonated, big full velvety mouthfeel without approaching imperial stout territory. deep roasted malted barley flavors dominate, with more subtle milk chocolate and macadamia coffee flavors in the background. finishes with a tobacco leaf hop twang, dry and satisfying. robust it certainly is. one of the best big porters around. well done."
"Thanks to Sulldaddy for this one. 12 oz bottle consumed in April 2005 (bottled Nov 2004). Poured a finger and a half brown head over a ptich black liquid. Smells of baker's chocolate, roast, and Fuggles hops. Tastes initally of roasted grains. After the swallow, the roast fades away and a dry choclate rises up with some floral hops. Some caramel tinges to the rising chocolate that gives the beer an overall candy-like goodness. Not quite as sweet as I expected, for a robust porter, and also a bit too dark. Carbonation is perfect and the body is medium. I get some alcohol in the flavor as the beer goes down the throat. It's gentle, but has rough edges. All in all, a very enjoyable beverage."
"Robust indeed  Smuttynose's take on a porter crushes some weaker stouts. If you like a strong hop profile in your porter, this is definitely one to try; if not, you'll probably be happier with a more balanced offering like Anchor's porter. I tend to prefer the latter, but this is still a fine beer, and another quality offering from Smuttynose. Recommended."
"Drinkability and Overall: Damn I love porters. And this is a king porter. Truly wonderful. This is just so damn smooth and creamy I can't keep my lips off the glass. This is one of the better porters I've had to date. If you like this, I'd recommend trying Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter. Killer."
"Beer has a dark brown/black body, with a dark caramel head; it's great to look at. Aroma is sweet with some roasted barley, chocolate malt smell, very nice. Malty, malty, malty. Smokey flavor, with a noticable bitter bite at the end. Certainly is robust, full of malt flavor. Great american porter."
"As for the taste, A roasted coffe, finishing off with an unsweetened chocolate. Hops are there, but as an after thought. It's mochachine taste reminds me of a lighter mix of old rasputing and storm king. The thiicker mouthfeel adds to it's presence. A nice, solid,hearty brew all around, something that can be both savor and drank often all in one. good show!"
"Bottled Nov. '04. Pours almost black with hints of red shining through at the edges. Some sediment on the bottom of the bottle. Head is tan, 2-3 fingers, and leaves lots of lacing. Chocolate, coffee and dark fruits in the nose - wish I'd used a snifter. Looks like a stout and smell reminds me of Old Rasputin. Tastes are burnt malts, unsweetened chocolate, coffee, a hop bitterness, and some citrus. Moderately thick mouthfeel with decent amount of carbonation. Could drink several but I mix-and-matched this 6-pack."
"Smuttynose Robust Porter pours a deep dark almost black color with a thin head. Aroma is full of dark roast coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Taste is dominated by roasted malt and coffee flavors, with some hops showing up in the finish. Delicious! A slick, thick mouthfeel, and a very drinkable beer for a snowy winter night."
"(K. Richmond)"
"Flavour here is quit esimilar to the smell and equally as good, though it does have a bit more bite to it, especially in the dry finish. It's nice to see this one be what it is: a porter that has just the right mouthfeel for one. It doesn't tryto bulk itself up and pass off as a stout. Awesome and definitely robust."
"Always a good choice, one of my fav brews from Smutty! Jet black with medium frothy brown head, light retention and lacing. Standard porter aromas of bittersweet chocolate and espresso balanced by a slightly sweet caramel/burnt sugar note. Tases is""robust"" as the name implies. Full flavors of darkly toasted malts, coffe, caramel, with a nuttyness to it that is very pleasing. Medium to light mouthfeel and and viscosity make it easy to drink as a session beer, just right carbonation. I really wish they would make an amped-up version of this beer to include in the Big Beer series, it would be a classic!!"
"Smutty's porter was the cask offering at the Sunset during my last visit. While I've always enjoyed the brew, it never tasted as great as it did from the- cask. It was a jet black brew with a finger of milk-chocolate colored head. It offered roast malt and chocolate aromas. The flavors were incredibly well balanced with lush swashes of chocolate, coffee, and nut flavors. It was a smooth drinking, medium bodied brew that I hope to enjoy again."
"Taste: Very good burnt malt, fairly round and warm, a very good porter that's perfect for a late fall evening. My bottle was nearly a year old and showed no sign of decline in taste."
"Pours nearly black with a huge brown head. Leaves a film of small bubbles on the edge of the glass when I tilt it to sip. Strong earthy aromas of bitter coffee and chocolate Bitter roasted coffee flavor. Full mouthfeel with high carbonation. Quite drinkable as well. Robust is an apt desciption of this fine porter. Another impressive beer from Smuttynose."
"Just a fantastic session porter here. I don't find anything particularly compelling or complex about this beer, it's just a porter, and a damn fine one. Head is minimal, as is lacing. Color is very deep dark brown, making it essentially opaque. The smell is very nice, very heavy on the coffee aromas, with some anise and licorice. Very roasty malt flavor, with a smoky ashen flavor that is juuust barely balanced out by a licorice and maybe red fruit sweetness. Hops are minimal, barely noticeable. The mouthfeel is not too thick, as a porter should be, and not too thin, as a porter should be. I could put away a few pints any night."
"Cheers"
"This is a pretty big beer. Very dark brown color and with a huge and sturdy brown head that sticks around for a while. I almost couldn't pick up on the scent because the head was creating such a barrier between my nose and the beer, but coffee comes to mind. Taste is roasted everything. Take a bunch of trail mix, berries, coffee, malt malt malt and throw it in the over for a while, that's what it tastes like. However it's pretty well balanced, though roasted malts do pretty much take over. Very creamy and rich mouthfeel. I had 2 of these and that was pushing it for this beer. A nice beer to have after dinner or before going to sleep. Hooray Smuttynose!"
"12 oz bottle with a bottled date of March 04. This poured out with a black body and a large light brown head that I had to quickly sip before it went overboard. Roasted malts and coffee were strong in the aroma with a good bit of bittersweet dark chocolate present as well. Overall the smell was pretty darn strong and good. The taste followed suite with strong coffee and roasted flavors stirring about and a nice chocolate staying in the background. The after taste was a lingering roasted one. About medium in body with a bit of a sticky mouthfeel. Very drinkable porter overall that goes down very easy and is flavorful enough to keep from getting boring. A great one for any one to try."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Smuttynose Robust Porter was served from a 12 oz. bottle. In a pint glass, the beer was black, with rich mahogany accents, and was topped by a luxurious, reddish brown head. The excellent nose was rich and roasty with a well-developed sasparilla-sharp figgy cola chocolate cocoa maltiness. The taste was equally excellent and balanced, with a rich, sharp and roasty bitter chocolate-cola malt profile that poured out great chocolate related flavors right through to the dry and robust bitter choco finish that held a touch of licourice....mmm. The body was wonderfully full, smooth, and creamy. Robust Porter is a superb brew that I would enjoy on a regular basis if were available in the PNW."
"This is a rather refreshing and multi-quaffable porter given its flavor and the subdued alcohol."
"Just don't ask me if I like this or the Smutty IPA better."
"All in all a very nice brew"
"(I finally understand what is wrong with American craft porters. They are too thin to bear the weight of roasted grain extracts that are typically forced into them. The effect is a dilute-tasting package of coffee grounds and char. More complex carbs would restore balance, but then it would be a ""stout."" Less roast would fail to impress the ""more is more"" crowd. And so we are left with a tea of charred grains.)"
"It kind of reminds me of a small imperial stout with much less hops. I really like this beer."
"Roasted coffee assaults senses. Too potent. A smoky burnt flavor follows with some sweet malt and a bitter finish."
"Draft 6 years later at Primus 16. Thick lace, sweetish, watery.Big coffee."
"Definitely, one of the better American porters. I could have several of these without tiring of the robust flavors."
"Drinkability - A very nice tipple. I drank the six-pack in one night with ease. A very good porter, and one that is close to my personal favortite Sam Smiths but significantly cheaper."
"Smuttynose Robust Porter comes close to being one of my favorites of the style. The only problem (and it's a huge one), is that I don't enjoy coffee-flavored porters and stouts. Cut the java way the hell back, replace it with chocolate and then I'd be in heaven. Thanks to Dantes for the bottle."
"Backwash: Certainly makes it tough to choose between this and the Fullers. Why not have some of both! Smutty continues to impress me. I might be late to their party, but Im glad I finally made it! By the way, Im equally impressed with their Brown Dog Ale, which represents one of my favorite, if somewhat neglected styles."
"A sharp hop attack right up front. Followed by waves of chocolate & coffee. Finishes dry with a smooth orangey hop loaded finish. Medium / full bodied, easy carbonation, velvety smooth. Comfort beer."
"Pours a deep deep brown with a wispy almond colored head,aroma is chocolaty and deeply roasted with an almost lactic quality to it.Taste is pretty robust like it says,I get a big earthiness along with some bitter unsweetened chocolate with some dry hoppy notes that eek through near the finish.A real nice cold weather brew nice to sip on a rainy damp day like today."
"On tap at the ginger man in NYC Pours black, dark tan head. Bready/malty nose. Outstanding lacing. Roasted malt, burnt malt, coffee grounds, licorish notes. Chalky dryness, hoppy dark chocolate. Medium bodied, nice stuff, fine brew, greatly enjoyed. Seek and quaff!"
"My last experience with Smutty was a very bad one. I had the pumpkin ale and it was sooo horrible, I couldn't even finish it. Naturally, I was reluctant to try this one, but the beer store guy said this was a good one, so I though I would try it. He was right on the head. This was a very nice offering from Smutty. It had very strong coffee/chocolatey tastes that were delectable. The color was a bold black color with a small tan head. The head was very thick and lasted a long while. All in all I was impressed with it."
"Brew poured to a very deep brown with a large brown head that broke down slowly and lead to incredible lacing through out the brew. The brew is all about the malt, as the roasted malt and caramel flavor overwhelms the nose with a little fruit sweetness that is also detectable. The name goes well with this beer as it has a very robust taste that actually has a lot going on. I can notice from the malt tastes of chocolate, caramel, coffee and a burnt flavor that actually is incredible! Also from the hops I can notice the pronounced flavors of citrus hops, all of the flavors bring this brew together into an incredible experience! Up to this point the Old Brown Dog Ale was my favorite from Smuttynose but it has been replaced with the fabulous porter! If you like this type of brew, try it!"
"Pours a deep coffee brown with a thin mocha cream head that leaves plenty of lacing. Big malt aroma with coffee, molasses, and chocolate hints. Smooth in the mouth with just the right amount of consistency to leave a nice coating on the palate. Tastes of coffee and chicory with a bittersweet chocolate aftertaste. A very nice porter, but the bitterness in the aftertaste would prevent me from drinking a lot in one sitting."
"Opaque dark brown with a sticky brown chocolate small head, rapidly becomes a film. Aroma of big columbian coffee beans, dark chocolate, milk blended in a rather low-profile expressiveness. Taste is also coffeeish in its malt development, but an unexpected strong piney/resinous/citrusy bitterness indicate a large hop presence and make the finish very long. Medium bodied and perhaps a tad overcarbonated, but I'm judging it against its Great Lakes rival. Good porter that wears its name with great pride, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I expected. I prefer the clean smokey/roasty to straightforward citrusy bitter finish I guess."
"It was nice to pur out this black beer and stare at it. The aroma smells of roasted coffee and some chocolate. It has lost of roasted flavor. I think the name says it all; this beer is robust. It has an almost grapey sourness and a subtle hop finish."
"Nice job Smuttynose."
"Taste: Great for a porter. That is, if you like your porters not as harsh. This was a light porter. Foamy mouthfeel, chocolate. I get a tiny bit of bitter foam. the rest is like unsweetened chocolate."
"Appearance: Very dark almost black with ruby edges when held up to the light nice sized tan head pours very thick head resists dwindling leaves nice lacing in unevenly dispersed rings. Aroma: Nice mild chocolate and coffee tones produced from the large amount of dark roasted malts added to the boil, hops are evident but not pushing any borders of hoppy. Taste: The taste is overly sweet a bitterness is produced between the mixture of harsher dark roasts and balancing hops a dry finish in the sort but very big and robust from the get go. Mouthfeel: Full bodied pours thick even carbonation. Drinkability: Quite refreshing overall even after considering the heavy body present, mild and balanced flavors nothing about this beer is controversial it's good."
"Pours as a nearly black, burly liquid with a moderate tan-colored head. The aroma is intensely roast grain. Smells of bitter, roast coffee and bakers chocolate.mmm. Theres very little hops in the aroma. Taste is instantly grainy and bitter. Dry and almost chalky, but extraordinarily porter-like. Roasted and burnt malts abound in the flavor. Its an in-your-face taste: Robust indeed. Bittering hops kick in by the mid-taste, and finish with a solid punch. The aftertaste lingers for an eternity. This is one very enjoyable porter!"
"Maybe this just came at the right time on the right day, but I'm enjoying this beer. Porters aren't usually my thing, but perhaps there's something about seeing that robust strongman on the label that gave this beer an invigorating quality unsurpassed by any New England craft porter. The thing I don't usually like about porters is the combination of bitterness and carbonation that just seems to attack the palate. Smuttynose must have found a way to remedy this because Robust Porter is the one of the most harmonious examples of the style I've tasted. Amen."
"01/19/04 update I tried this brew again, and feel I needed to upgrade the taste. Smooth smoky malt, with a very subtle aftertaste of citrus hops. Upgrade drinkability also....extremely smooth and easy on the palate."
"This beer pours a crude oil black with a very modest dark tan head that is small but creamy and smooth. The smell of roasted malts and chocolate and light hops make your mouth water! This is one good porter! The taste is a bit more chocolatey than anything else, but it has subtle complexities lurking in the background. There is a slight nuttiness with mild hops and a burnt lightly dry finish. This porter is a little thin, but not too much so. This is one of the best porters I've tasted! Cheers!"
"Another delicious offering from Smuttynose...very rich and delicious. A good porter, and one I'd have again!! Thank you to mydeadguy for the bottle."
"Mmmm, good stuff! A black caramel pour, with thick, frothy, long lasting brown head, just the way I like it. Smells crisp and clean. Taste is a mouthful. With each sip I'm hit with powerful, intermingling malt tastes, with a roast coffee taste being predominant. Aftertaste is of lingering dark chocolate and cream. Powerful stuff and just a gosh darned great ass porter."
"Very dark pour, close to blackish brown with a nice tan head of good duration. Complicated lace on the glass. Malty aroma, dry Mexican chocolate and a harder roast than some. Even a sense of a blackberry fruitiness as well. Mouthfeel is nice, smooth with fine carbonation. The flavor is interesting and somewaht contrasting -- a lot of herbal hoppiness joins with a coffee and rum-like impression to give this Porter better complexity than many. Good consistant flavor front to back with moderate dry aftertaste. I could have used a bit more sweetness. Compares to Summit Great Northern but with better mouthfeel. A final thanks to Liza P. and her dad for getting it, and Ken K. for bringing it back on the plane -- a twelve back of mixed bottles gets to be a drag in carry-on."
"Had this at the great lost bear...pour was black as night. The toffee colored head quickly faded, but was nice while it lasted. Over-all flavor notes were of roasted coffee and dark chocolate...pretty darn pleasant. Smooth and easy to drink, it's even better on cask. Pat"
"Thanks to mydeadguy of BIF 4.0"
"Very drinkable. Not too strong abv. Very tasty. I urge you folks to try it. You won't be disappointed."
"I am often very demanding of a porter. I know what a good porter is. I went into this particular porter with descriminating taste and a bit of experience that told me not to expect too much. But I was put in a state of aw by this beer. It was close to perfect. A wonderful beer."
"Taste is very smoky. Strong coffee flavors with biter chocolate lurking beneath the surface. Dry bitter finish. Big bodied witha strong bitter aftertaste. Lots of big flavors in this brew but it is really smooth and extremely drinkable. This is my kind of beer. Could put down a six of this without thinking about it. Chocolate silk."
"I would say this is a pretty true modern interpretation, not to mention a damn good beer - complex yet easy to drink. I could definitely knock a few of these back at a sitting."
"I love porters that bursting with flavor and this robust porter certainly meets that task quite well. It pours almost opaque black with a dark brown head which I believe is a sign of the presence of roasted barley. Either way the presence of roasted barley in this really develops the flavor, making it a sweet porter with a big burly taste. The hopping is well balanced -- it is not too bitter and you pick up some lovely hop characteristics in the aroma mixed with the choclatey-ness of the malt they use. Altogether a great beer that goes down well during those harsh New England winters."
"Nice porter. Mildly rich, chocolate and roasted malt flavours (sweetish at times), roasted , medium bitter finish, with some light bitter, lightly acidic, citric hops. Flavours blend nicely together. Nice roasted finish, quite a long finish aswell, simple and easy to get into, tasty(Cask-GBBF 03')"
"The beer poured a dark black color with a nice tan head. The aroma was malty with bit of hops. There was a strong chocolate malt aroma. The taste was good. This is a smooth beer; quite malty. The mouthfeel is fine. The carbonation is just right. This is a med to high bodied beer. This is a good drinking beer."
"This is a decent porter, but not great, and hardly robust."
"Lasting brown sugar sweetness stays on the lips."
"Interesting for all of the flavours in it, handsome looking beer. Not real agressive for something labelled robust, but quite enjoyable."
"Deep mahogany color with a dark brown frothy head that settles quickly, but leaves oily looking ringlets of lace around the glass. Aroma of roasted malt, some cocoa, hints of rich coffee and molasses. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Flavor is intense and complex - bitter coffee, light cocoa, some hop backbone, raisin and molasses. Lingering aftertaste of sweet raisin and brown sugar envelopes the insides of the mouth. I really like this one."
"This brew pours a small head of large brown mostly lasting bubbles and an opaque black colored body. It has a mild malt coffee aroma. Initially it is smooth and mild but comes through in the end with a tingly coffee flavored mouthfeel. It is a decent brew, but far from being a best example of the style."
"A thin tan head tops this black coal beauty with a dark brown tint. Fragrant hops, malt, licorice and fumes of alcohol rise up upon pouring, but dissipate all too soon. The dark roasted barley is smoky and coffee-like with dark chocolate, molasses and licorice notes. This porter is amply hopped with citrus and mild tea-like bitterness. The advertised 5.7% alcohol seems a bit low, because you can really notice it. Creamy and rich!"
"My very cold bottle of this poured just enough head to cover the surface, but that only lasted a minute, by which time it was only a modest amber ring around the surface. It's very black, with maybe a slightly redish hue, if anything besides purely black. The aroma is moderate in strength, and dominated by black roasted malts. The mouthfeel is very smooth, and pretty light, considering what I expected from the color. Very little bitterness initially, but with a light, not overdone, round sweetness. Then a slightly bitter roastiness becomes almost immediately noticable, balanced nicely with the initial sweetness. This is soon joined by a slight hop flavor, though a very mild one. A nice robust sweet dark graininess sits on the tongue as the flavor fades."
"Can Smuttynose do anything wrong? Wonderful. I believe this is my favorite porter."
"-F"
"The Smuttynose Robust Porter is a good, dark pour with virtually no head. The smell is smoky and dry, and I note a deep fruitiness, courants perhaps or prunes? The taste begins with a quick, sharp hoppiness and fades to a complex woodsy flavor of ferns, cones, and oak leaves after a cool, autumn rain. This is a worthy brew, and I recommend it heartily."
"A hair shy of jet black, w/ a flash of clear crimson when held to light. Tan, persistent dense head leaves loose lace. Slightly burnt, smokey black malt accompanied by sweetly citric hops upfront in aroma, followed by rounded dark lovibond caramel and mellow, bittersweet chocolate. Mild black patent bitterness with a slightly tart tinge initially in flavor widens into a lightly buttery melange of chocolate, brown sugar sprinkled burnt toast and molasses drizzled, candyish clementine. Chocolate malt presence becomes more pronounced as the beer breathes, and approaches that of cocoa butter rich milk chocolate. Hop and black patent bitterness keeps malt sweetness well at bay, allowing the agreeably pronounced chocolate presence to shine. Caramel malt character is well integrated, leaving its mark in the from of residual dextrins and rounded, mild toffee. Moderate in body, and notch shy of firmly viscous in mouthfeel. Almost creamy. Well calculated attenuation. Finishes with a hint of butterscotch yielding to lingering sharp coffeeish bitterness. A delicious, superbly well rounded porter that displays a striking hop, chocolate and roasted grain balance that remains quite soft on the palate. Nearly epitmoizes a ""robust"" porter. Outstanding!"
"As a porter lover I will be sure to continue to stock these and I recomend that you do the same."
"Extremely dark brown beer, with very little head. The aroma is like a traditional porter -- very smoky. Tastes of roasted nuts, coffee, and toffee. There are scents of all of these as well, but the smoky smell dominates. It's not sweet at all. Very smooth, and very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel was thinner than expected, and made it quite easy to throwback but unfortunately the more unappealing tastes really linger and hold it back. Tone down those hops and black malts - they make things wicked caustic!"
"Pours a dark brown, almost black color with virtually no head at all. The aroma is a mixture of cocoa, coffee, and roasted malt. The tastes of bittersweet chocolate and roasted male are quite apparent with slightly mild hop undertones. There was a bit too much carbonation, which distracted some from the flavor. The finish was bitter and dry. This is a decent porter, its not the best that Ive had, but its quite drinkable."
"Now I can't say that I'm the world's biggest fan of porters to begin with, but this was just downright awful. The first few sips leave you marveling about all the flavors you are experiencing. The next few sips leave you cringing at how disgustingly sweet it is. The sickening sweetness of its chocolate tones overpower anything else in the beer and leave you looking for a Victory Hopdevil to assuage your taste buds. If you don't like sweet beers, beware."
"Pours very dark brown in color with a creamy tan colored head that fades into a thick and sticky lace. Nose is dark roasted malts and sweet chocolaty cocoavery inviting. Medium to full-bodied with a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Taste starts off sweet and malty with notes of milk chocolate and a bit of dark fruit followed by some bitter and acidic flavors of dark (almost burnt) coffee. A touch of citrus rind tasting hop bitterness comes through in the finish. Quite robust and highly enjoyable. Thanks to paceyourself for sending me this brew!"
"This porter poured a very dark brown (black) with brown foam that settled relatively quickly, but left a thin head that left some lace. The smell was of dark (burnt) malt, with a bit of coffee and sweetness. The smell was modest. The taste was strong: some sweetness balanced by some bitterness -- malt and floral hops and coffee. The mouthfeel was full bodied and rich with low carbonation. Not overly sweet, but nicely balanced. However, there was a bit of chalkiness. The drinkability was very good. A very tasty porter."
"Mild head on top of a black body with what seemed to be a hint of a reddish hue. Initial sip is quite nice, a bit of a sharp coffee finish. The taste seems to lessen with each sip disappointingly, but it still held substantial flavor. I was just expecting more with something named ""robust"". It should be named ""kinda robust porter"""
"Fully black color, below a rich, tan, though woefully brief, head. Aroma is strong and powerful, rich with notes of cocoa, coffee, and butternut. Slightly oily texture, but with plenty of grit. Full body, sweet, strong, substantial, with a tasty acidity and tang. Small bitterness, and solid malt. Sweet and bitter at once. Roasty, toasty, and above all, tasty. A little syrupy toward the end, but that didn't spoil my enjoyment of this fine porter.Thanks to UncleJimbo for introducing me to this gem."
"First I’d like to say that I liked the label, good imagery of a strong guy and use of black and white antique style photo. This beer poured very dark brown to almost black, you almost don’t see the slight red outline that is present unless you hold it to a white light. The head is a medium tan color that is chunky and thick, that holds up fairly well. The lace is very sticky, hold well to the sides of the glass. The aromas were quite distinct. I smelled dark molasses that is slightly burnt, roasted malt, hints of cocoa and sweet coffee. The taste was also pretty distinct as well. Flavors of sweet burnt molasses, roasted dark malt, sweet chocolate coffee and a slight hops appeal as well. It filled my mouth pretty well, which allowed me to taste the flavors fairly well. There was a slight aftertaste of the bitter chocolate and hops that seemed to last a few seconds until they totally disappeared. A good beer that held the style pretty well, a little darker then usual but that would not stop me from getting this beer. Would taste good in the dark."
"Very dark pour, with a slight hint of rubyness around the edge. Head was small and tan, and left light lace on the glass. Aroma is all roasted - some coffee, chocolate, and hint of caramel. Flavor starts of quite sweet, with a little caramel in there, middle becomes more roasted coffee-like, with hints of chocolate. Body is medium, flavor lingers. This brew goes down very smooth."
"**Review #6**"
"Pours out a near opaque tint of darkest brown. Head is short-lived and leaves only a tiny collar. In terms of flavour profile, I can identify this most closely with Storm King Stout. However, it is less opressive than that, and decent. Agressive hopping battles with the standard porter malt profile. Vinous, acidic, and still sweet, with some bitter touches in the finish. Has pretentions to being stronger in ABV than it actually is. Very nice mouthfeel, though. Smallish bubbles, smooth and a little thick on the tongue."
"Beautiful, thick, bronze coloured head. Roasted nose with a light sweetness. Vety rich and smooth going down but yet not too heavy. Wonderful roasted malt flavours with a slightly sweet finish. Reminded me of the great St. Ambroise Oatmeal stout. I would definitely buy this porter again."
"Cheers!"
"The pour a deep dark brown to black, the head monstrous, the lace in fine sheets to coat the glass, light chocolate the color. Nose is caramel, roasted grains, sweet. The beer starts sweet, the top light, the finish is minimally carbonated, potently hopped, the aftertaste dry, long lasting and a good drinking beer, and an above average porter. Robust the name, robust the beer, and well worth a sample"
"After a bad day at work, picked up a bottle of this beer. Dark and robust, with barely no head. It has a french roast taste. The first sip is forced, but each drink after that is more pleasant, much like the coffee. Two 22oz bottles is all my palate will allow, then it starts to taste bad."
"Very tasty and highly drinkable, I will be having this one again very soon."
"Blind fold me and I'd have a hard time differentiating this from a sweet, complex stout."
"You have to work at it to get a decent head which lasts about halfway through the pint. This is a very dark dense looking beer. Even if you hold the glass up to a light, you still can't see through it. Awesome porter flavor with chocolate and coffee flavors all mixed together with the hops. Just a little sweet on the finish which decreases its drinkability somewhat. Another fine unfiltered offering from Smuttynose - their beers are starting to grow on me."
"Pours very black with a nice brown head that sticks around for a good amount of time.  Smell is of roasted malt and some slight hop bitterness, some chocolatey sweetness is in there as well.  Brews starts off very chocolatey on the tongue and then fades into a very nice roasted coffee taste that leaves a lingering bitter finish on the tongue.  The finish fades ever so slowly into bittersweet chocolate with some vague smokiness in there as well..  Very smooth and creamy and very drinkable.  This is one damn fine porter.  Thanks to the Bierman for the sample."
"Dark, dark porter with crimson-brown at edges. My head did not last, but I'm guessing that's either my pour or my glass. Rich, rich, and rich, like dark chocolate. Alcohol gallops to the forefront, not only puckers the mouth but warms the whole body. Creamy, nourishing mouthfeel if a bit oily for my tastes. Coffee finish. Tonight's a fine summer evening and this beer is a bit too ""robust"" for a night like tonight, but I can imagine on a chilly winter's eve it would hit the spot."
"From the start: the pour was great - nice and dark. Creamy head that stuck around. The roasted malts are definetly foremost but still enough hops to give it a nice dry finish - love that coffe/chocolate mix. Smooth, smooth, smooth. More please."
"Deep dark heavy bodied porter with a thick creamy lasting head.  Slightly fruity aroma just after the pour.  Use of roasted malts apparent and pleasing with subtle chocolate aftertaste.  A good porter, especially for the area where hops tend to be king."
"Huge rocky light brown head that holds up very well and seems to stick everywhere it can. It literally is one of the best heads I have seen in a long time. Big aroma of highly roasted malt, a pinch of sweetness in there also. Very smooth with a creamy backbone. Robust they say and robust it is with a sturdy full body. Roasted malt is very prevalent and gives a quick snappish twang then a blanketing of softer roasted malt flavour slowly cover the mouth again with suggestions of French roast coffee and unsweetened chocolate. Tight berry like fruitiness within and a mild warming alcohol slowly warms the mouth and body. Damn good drinking."
"Typical tastee porter. Not overpowering. Pleasant finish.  One of several quality brews this New Hampshire outfit produces (haven't had a bad one yet)."
"31"
"Some brewers think that, in order to call a beer a ""robust"" porter, it has to be an IPA disguised with dark malt.  Fortunately Smuttynose has resisted the temptation to overhop this beer.  A well-executed example of the style.  Solid, deep roasted java maltyness with just the barest hint of dark chocolate.  The hops have something of a grapefruit essence and justify the ""robust"" designation."
"not bad"
"Notes: One of Smuttynose's most complex and tasty brews to date. Haven't had many Robust Porters, but this is indeed true to the modern day interpretation of a Porter, and it is indeed robust in flavour."
