"O: A drain pour, after 2 sips (I don't know why I didn't stop at one)."
""
""
""
"Poured a dark brown with a cream colored head. Has the typical warm smell of a porter with notes of caramel. Taste is good, not strong like some porters and goes down easy. Overall very good beer."
""
""
"Smells of rich caramel.  Would probably taste better warmed up to about room temp.  Nothing worthy to seek out though."
""
""
"Has a nice caramel taste but overall just an ok porter"
""
""
""
""
"It's actually pretty well balanced. I don't get a ton of caramel in it. To be honest, it's too carbonated in the mouthfeel for the style. It has a rich taste, but the problem is the mouthfeel is not smooth enough. Decent beer though, it's drinkable"
""
""
"Great flavor. Candy apple hint. Porter finish."
""
"Overall pretty good and flavorful."
""
"Nothing horrible and there are a lot worse examples of beer than this one. One member said it should be a brown ale, couldn't agree more. It's okay,  not something the craft aficionados would go Gaga over but something to bring to a party and others will enjoy."
"It looks like a flat cola, and smells and tastes like it has gone bad"
""
"O: I could see this appeasing the masses, but for me it misses the mark. Seems artificially sweet, and cloying. I simply don't think I can finish this."
""
"Abbreviated review: Simply isn't a porter. Should probably be called a brown ale, but still wouldn't be a great beer, just more aptly named."
"To be honest I like it"
""

"My first Saranac in a long time, there's been too many others to enjoy! From the bottle poured a cola-color with very light lace skimming the surface. The caramel has nowhere to hide, I might have confused myself with procuring candy for Halloween not porter as a mix sixer for New Year's. Complements the malt but risks overwhelming it too. Not really in disagreement with my palate but not likely a repeat purchase. Will be interesting to compare to another in the mix-six I selected purely by accident, Shiner's ""Birthday Beer"" a chocolate stout. Luckily accident though since I'll be spending 12/31/14 at a party hosted by a New Year's baby, hope his sweet tooth is in gear for that as mine was for the Saranac."
"Nice flavor, but prefer a heartier porter."

"I don't care about your error message. I like this beer, doesn't matter to me that others rated it lower. :-P"

" In an effort not to be influenced by other BA reviews, I either take notes or make a mental rating before posting here. Thus far, I find that my ratings are consistent with the general consensus. However, in this case I'm surprised by the negative rating and reviews for this one and find that it is one of the few cases that I massively overrated a brew as compared to the average. I'm really not sure what so many people are turned off by here. I could maybe understand how the sweetness is a turn off but not on such a massive scale. Granted this is not the best porter I have had by a long shot, however, I find it to be a pleasant brew that I would have no problem drinking again."

"Awful."
""

""
""
"O: Too sweet and too thin to be a beer that I would want to have more than one of in a single session. Not bad but not one I will be picking up again anytime soon."

"I seem to like this beer a lot more than other people. The appearance is a nice dark hazel or brown with a nice head. The smell is sweet with a lot of the caramel as well as toasted scents from the malt. The taste is delicious with a full beginning with the toasted malt flavor and then ends on the sweet caramel. The only problem I had was it is a little thin for a porter. I might have nostalgia glasses on, but I still love this beer."

""
"Overall: This is a good beer. Not outstanding but nothing here really excites me. Most memorable aspect is the caramel which I have never found more intense in any other beer. I love caramel, but in this beer it could use a little balance."
""
""
""
"Loved this beer! It has an amazing taste, look and feel to it. The malty caramel combo was perfect, especially during the winter. Plus the buzz I got from it was pretty nice. Definitely would have this again. It isn't available all year around so I plan on stocking up once it comes back."
""
"Not suggested unless you can get it for super cheap."
""

"O - All in all, not a bad beer, just proves too much is bad. Definitely a dessert or after-dinner drink, way too much for session drinking. I imagine it would be enjoyable on a cold fall evening with a piece of warm pie or some cobbler. Good dessert beer, bad session beer, but overall a good porter, albeit a little too sweet."
"Overall: A solid effort from Saranac, one of the grand old men of the NY beer scene. It's a decent dessert porter that has enough depth and complexity to avoid being just a sugar-bomb. Would probably drink this again if it were the sole craft porter/stout on draft; otherwise, I'm happy to have had it once."
""
""
"Overall: I may have this beer again, perhaps in a float. Maybe not, on second thought, it tasted like a caramel-flavored ale. However, it was nice to have a Saranac that was missing the characteristic hop-laden flavoring that makes many of their beers taste like an IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste-Faint roasted barley, caramel, toasted malt, nutty. A bit light-bodied and the flavors don't blow your doors off, but overall a decent, innofensive, affordable brew."

"Overall: This beer was not a hit with me -- there were some off-flavors in the taste and the additives just made it taste like imitation flavors."
"A fairly average porter, decent flavor but disappointing body. Worth trying but probably not worth going out of your way to find. There are plenty of better porters."

"We were lucky to get a case, apparently a regular shopper at one of our local PA beer distributors buys every case they get in their shipments. Two couples shared the case and everyone thoroughly enjoyed Caramel Porter."

"The taste is more caramel than porter with a slight diacetyl type of buttery element with light brown sugar and mild vanilla extract creamy/sweet blend The malt has a mild toasted grain feel, but also seems kind of adjunct flavored like candy corn, not a great flavor but does have the caramel the label promises, just not caramel malt. Overall a pretty average beer, but not a very good porter -it seems like the gimmick of putting caramel in front of the style is more important than it tasting like a porter -seems like caramel extract dominates the flavor of this."

"Not totally encompassing the porter aspects, but it's an average flavored beer with a nice aroma. 3.5"
""
""
"Yes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours very dark brown with a touch of white foam. Clear top after it settles. Sweet caramel nose. Taste is a light caramel sweetness without much of a hop backup. There is an extra sweetness in there that is muted by the porter. An odd blend, not quite right. Too sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
"D: if you like caramel you will probably enjoy this brew. if not, avoid this brew. myself, being a fan of beers that are able to mimic other flavors, really could only drink one of these. good, but not great."
""
""
"Overall one of the Saranac beers I always look forward to. Even better on tap as even more of the caramel comes out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is not the porter I would regularly choose, but has a nose that is beyond intriguing!"
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark, vibrant, ruby coloring with a thin, even, foamy coating of off-white head that is a fraction of an inch high. Aromas of sugary sweet caramel, just like a Werther's Original. Overpowering and very candy-like. Flavors are extremely rich and sweet. There is a slight roasting that gets lost in the backbone, extremely overpowered by the buttery and sugary caramel components. The body is smooth to start, which helps to support the body, but it becomes thin and filmy. Rich, sweet, and cloying finish. This is a tough one...good for someone wiith a wicked sweettooth."
"This is a nice porter. Good mouthfeel, good flavors and it looks good. Highly sessionable brew that isnt a big beer by any means but is approachable and does the job. Just isnt a roasted malt porter. Good."
""
""
"This taste like an underwhelming homebrew with added candy caramel. Super sweet, slick, and kinda makes you shiver as it goes down."
"O- Good as a sweet, end of day ""dessert"" beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A bit better than the sum of its parts, but this is still just an average or below-average porter. Still, happy to have this as part of Saranac's very affordable $14 12-pack this fall."
""
""
"O- this would make a good dessert beer because it's so sweet, it does however take away from its drinkability. Not as bold as most porters but it is as advertised, so you can't knock them for that."
""
"O: uniquely flavored beer with a pronounced caramel aspect. I really enjoy this one from time to time, although it is one of those ""one is enough"" beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – The smell of the beer is fantastic, the taste good, but the mouthfeel was a hit to the overall quality of the beer. While the mouthfeel is not the greatest, for the price you pay it is not a bad beer and one that is well worth a try."
""
"O: There are better porters out there. I recommend people try this beer at least once. If you are crazy about caramel, then you might really enjoy this. A little bit too much caramel for me -- this is something I can imagine putting on ice cream or something."
""
""
""
""
"Man, this started off promising & I really dug the smell - what happened? Weak sauce, indeed."
"D - This beer is like a cover band or the second album that comes out after a band has a really big hit. I don't mean that Saranac had lots of hits in the past what I mean is the idea is awesome, and the album cover is good, and much like the bacon beers and chocolate beers why not put two great things together. In the end though the flavor just can't live up to the hype."
""
""
""
""
"D/O: While it sounded appealing on the label, this beer's practically undrinkable nature shows the caramel feature to be nothing more than a poorly-executed gimmick. The palate suffers a moment of dread at the prospect of being freshly awash in this beer's displeasing flavor and textural qualities."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- It's a cheap porter. I picked up a 6 pack for 6.99. For a micro brew, this is rather cheap. I was expecting a lot from Saranac, but was disappointed by the lack of quality."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured nicely, smelled great. Caramel! Lots of caramel! and malts! How can this go wrong. Well it goes wrong because it tastes like someone took the most generic, god-awful artificially sweetened caramel and liquified it and poured it into an otherwise good porter. The first few tastes weren't bad, actually, but then the artificial caramel sweetener built and built like a rolling snowball and buried my palate under a ton of disgusting fake caramel. Saranac can do better."
""
""
""
"O- not a favorite. Good idea but taste like a caramel syrup poured in a soda. A beer that you want to commit a beer sin and not finish."
"Dang, I like this unique brew. I am no connoisseur of beer but I know what I like. When I want a sweeter brew with lots of flavor this meets that requirement. The caramel is apparent and fills the palate with flavor and sweetness (that is a good thing...isn't that why you grabbed a brew with that name?). So, if you don't like caramel flavor in your porter, don't buy it because it is what it says it is. You can't ask for more and you shouldn't ask for less! And, BTW the ladies like this one, if they like better brews than Coors Light."
"O - A solid number of gripes here. I felt it could have used a more balanced profile, a better hop back-end, a bigger body, and less artificial-ish caramel flavor. Not terrible. But certainly underwhelming and average. Disappointing after I really enjoyed their Octoberfest a month ago."
""
"O: an enjoyable enough brew but nothing really even stands out, scent is bleh, taste is eh, appearance is the best part"
"O - Great smelling beer that just doesn't work out, caramel is overpowering and doesn't really taste integrated"
"Overall- The beer smells entirely too sweet, but makes some points back with the flavors. If the base roasted malt was stronger, this would be a nice little porter."
""
"Overall you could say this is a desert beer, however, it is way to sweet for my taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall at first I was considering getting a case but I can't believe how cloying the beer gets. Would be nice to have a six pack though as a nightcap."
""
""
"it sounds so tempting but the execution of this brew is off a little to me. pours dark and enticing, but smells like an artificial caramel than the real butter and burnt sugar authentic article. taste is the same, like a nice porter meets a sugardaddy. lousy caramel on a stick... the texture of the porter is really smooth and the mouthfeel of this beer is quite good. overall it is a nice winter beer from time to time, defnitely too weird to be sessionable. i would love to try a different caramel porter, but this is the only one i have ever seen, so bonus points for originality."
""
"O- Its an ok beer but it kinda grows on ya if you give it a chance."

"what can i say this beer taste great there something in this beer that i havent tasted before i think i got a buy a case , looks like a regular dark beer nothing new there the smell is up lifting a good smell but its the taste its great thank you old man who leaves beer out for his mailman"
"Caramel, sweet, malty aroma. A bit over carbonated for my liking. Sweet, caramel, malt flavor...seems somewhat lacking, but not undrinkable. Not my go to porter, but somewhat unique...I guess...meh."
""
"Feels smooth and overall this was a much better beer fresh."
"Overall - Very poor beer. Weird tasting and not pleasant."
""
""
""
""

"Overall, unimpressed. Guess I'll just have to look forward to my Vanilla Porter in the 12 Beers of Winter!"
""
""
""
"Part of the 12 beers a fallin. Best by January 2012. Poured into my Duvel tulip. Dark brown color with minimal head and not much activity. Sweet caramel syrup smell. Sweet caramel syrup taste. Way too sweet. Wow is this sweet. Quick to shotgun due to the relatively low ABV, low carbonation and light body. Super sweet. Maybe I need to pair the last one with dark chocolate."
"Poured into a New Belgium globe glass. Color is a deep rich mahogany, too light for a usual porter, yet too dark for a brown ale. The head is a fluffy pillow of cream that dissipates to a wisp of bubbles across the top. Sticky, random lacing. The aroma of sweet caramel dominates. The taste is very simple and straightforward: roasted malts and tons of sticky sweet caramel. I'm not detecting any sort of burnt malt porter taste anywhere though. The mouthfeel is just about right for a porter. Overall, this beer is one of those overly sweet dessert beers that goes down way too smooth because of said sweetness. If the ABV was higher, you could really get in trouble here, but it's okay at 5.4%. I probably should have bought a single bottle of this instead of a six pack, because the cloying sweetness is just too much to session with. I also didn't feel like I drank a porter, at all. I'll call Saranac immediately and ask them to re-name it as Saranac Caramel Brown Ale!"
"Lacheim..."
"Wouldn't try this one again."
"Overall this was a solid brew with some interesting complexity. Initially I was a little concerned with the odd aroma - It almost reminded me of another gimmicky flavored beer. After sipping on it for a while, the palate became better and better. I still think there may be some artificial flavoring used in this one."
"Overall, this is a decent beer. It's different at least. The nose and taste are a little too sweet and candy-like. It's just a little too one dimensional."
"O- This one wasn't for me."
"Pours deep brown with ruddy highlights.Creamy but very shortlived head.Slight lacing of glass. Smells only slightly of caramel. Taste slightly of burnt caramel, malt, touch of hops. Slight lingering aftertaste. I've had worse."
"D: Looks alright and has an okay mouthfeel. The nose is just not right and the flavor is disjointed, unbalanced, as well as cloy and weak at the same time. Too much candy and not enough beer. Not terrible, but cheaply desert-like."
" O: This beer is very acceptable but not outstanding. Fun to drink and could pair with food."
"O-A sweet beer, however there are much better porters out there. I had it last year but didn't review as apart of their Fall Sample Pack and this beer just isn't up to snuff."
"This beer looked a lot like a cola when poured - to complete the look all I needed was ice. Very small to nonexistent head. It smelled a little like Killians red to me for some reason which I liked. The mouth feel was dryer than expected with too much carbonation. Overall an OK beer - was hoping the caramel would be a little stronger."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin for a porter, and while carbonation isn't obscene it seems a little high for this beer. One good thing is that there is a very nice smoothness that rolls on the tongue all the way into a mildly lingering finish."
"Taste is not robust as they say but it is flavorful in an interesting way, very artificially candy like with it's caramel presence, the roasted malt presence that you'd expect is lacking, the body is fairly thin and fades from the mouth quickly, carbonation is spot on though and lends a nice softness and a bit of slickness, sadly it's wasted on this ""Caramel Porter"" which seems more like an oddly flavored brown ale."
"overall not bad at all, it had all the parts and just needed a bot more to throw it over the edge to excellence"
"Well, it's different. Make that very different. It's not offensive but I don't think it's really what anybody thinks of when they think of a porter. Seems like a bit of a novelty to me."
"O: Overall the beer was ok. The smell is awesome, but the flavor just doesn't back it up. As a big porter fan, maybe I'm being overly critical, but all in all, I wasn't impressed."
"D-I'm not drinking this all day, but it's a nice beer to save for dessert or something of the like. I would definitely drink this with a dessert item."
"D - Decent, not great."
"A metallic smell to it and a dark appearance. The beer itself does not taste metallic however, but very sweet. I'd say it may even be too sweet, but I have a sweet tooth, so I'm not too upset. The immediate aftertaste is pleasant. However, the taste lingers and soon becomes not so pleasant."
"D/M: Very big and strong sweetness. Really good flavor but sticks to the palate."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. The abv crept up a bit for less than 6% and was slightly noticeable but overall this is fairly decent drinking. However, it is quite a contrasting amount of different tastes that dont particularly work well together. The whole idea of a caramel porter is an interesting concept but just didnt quite get it done for me. Worth a try but not something I would enjoy more than just one of."
"The pour results in a pretty nice dark brown topped by a healthy tan foamy head. The nose comprises light roasted malts, caramel, light toasted toffee, brown sugar...honestly it smells like a really nice cookie, kinda like the base cookie that normally holds a Hershey Kiss. You know the one I mean. The taste brings the roast and caramel back, now joined by a hint of licorice, a sharp stab of mild blueberry (okay...), a wave of vanilla, some random pinpricks of raisins and figs, and it all wraps up together into an oatmeal raisin cookie-esque configuration. The body is a sleek medium, with a mild carbonation and a smooth, slightly grainy feel. Overall, a very nice beer, one I could see easily drinking an entire sixer of on a number of occasions (if 'twere possible, o' course)."
"DB- The metallic flavor is really throwing the whole experience off. As far as I know this is decently fresh, from around Christmas time. Something is wrong here, brewer or infection... Maybe I will try this next year to confirm. Reminds me of the ""bad"" Fuller's and Sam Smith's beer I have had that were not fresh."
"I miss the winter seasonal Saranac 12 packs with 12 different varieties. This was always a real stand out. This beer gets nostalgia points even if it isn't actually, you know, great."
"D: Very drinkable could get a few of these going now if I had more than one:-("
"Definitely a beer I'd pick up and try again."
"Overall I like it and will probably buy again. At 7 for a six pack it's definitely worth it. But is it a porter? That's questionable. But definitely something that would be easy to put a few down."
"D- This was a one trick pony for me. It depends on caramel and forgets the porter aspects of it. Too sweet and caramel ba forward to make it truly drinkable."
"D - I wouldn't run out to buy it, but I wouldn't turn it down if it was offered to me."
"D- All of the problems make this beer impossible to drink, enjoy, or ever purchase again."
"Drinkability is pretty good. This is a decent beer, but it is in the 2nd tier of porters."
"D: Since I didn't care much for the taste or mouthfeel, needless to say, the drinkability naturally followed suit."
"This is on the sweeter side of things out there and probably explains the overall rating on here. $1.85 a single. I plan to buy a sixer of this and enjoy it for the rest of winter. Its snowing outside right now and this brew makes me warm and fuzzy inside."
"D - Decent enough but too sweet to have more than one of. The caramel takes over a little more that I would have liked."
"D: if you're looking for a good caramel taste to this porter you certainly wont find it here. the bad caramel taste made it hard to drink."
"D: The high amount of sweetness in this beer doesn't make it one that goes down very easily. There's no way I could drink more than one of these at a time."
"D - Fairly drinkable, but overall far too sweet. The mouthfeel and aroma both feel like they are they are too light and lacking something. Much more of a dessert beer than anything else, and still a too sweet."
"It's a great beer for a cold winter day. Heavy brew with a rich body and different tastes that intrigue the drinker."
"Drinkability: A sub-par porter. Really this is all caramel and no porter. If you like caramel, it might be good for you but there's really nothing else here for a good beer lover."
"A very nice break from the IPA's and Ales that I usually consume, good thing I drank this after dinner because it is definitely a desert beer."
"Overall this was well above average and worthy by all means. The flavor delivered all the sweet toffee and caramel sweetness that I hoped for then some. Couldn't drink more than 2 or 3 in a sitting because of the style. Better in a mixed 12 pack vs. a whole 6er of this brew."
"caramel isn't quite sweet enough to overcome the butter and metallic flavors to make this quaffable. luckily it was cheap, so if i don't finish it i wont be out much money."
"Picked this one up for my wife recently, and figured I go ahead and try it with her. Poured a deep, rich, dark brown, with a nice tan head. Unfortunately, all down hill from there. Aromas of caramel syrup, sweet cream and a little vanilla. On the palate, light bodied, sickly sweet caramel and little else. Never again."
"Pours a moderate caramel-copper color and really doesn't have any sort of head at all. It's a bit murky and there isn't any real lacing. The nose is actually quite nice with some very mild chocolate plus a good dose of toffee and caramel, leaning toward the former. The taste is a mess with the toffee really taking over and it tastes just like liquid candies. Feel is a bit too sweet and moderately cloying. Does not drink well and is just a bit too much of a novelty."
"Not drinkable."
"D: Flavorful and smooth. Caramel is bit overbearing throwing the beer out of balance."
"Pours copper-gold out of the bottle, appearing dark amber in a nonic glass. Two-finger head, almost Guinness-like head retention, average lacing. The aroma is a little disappointing, with some roasted malts, heavy caramel character, but smells soapy with more than one finger of head. Letting the head settle down will rid of some of the soap. Same goes with the taste....something weird in the head that throws the taste off. The taste is not developed in this beer. However, I give credit that the taste is sufficient with this low, 5.4% beer. Caramel, roasted malts, but unfortunately followed by some buttery flavors, and that soapiness just won't go away. Once again, credit to a light-bodied beer with that much winter flavor and under 6% ABV."
"That is definetely one which I will buy again. great job."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a very dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of sweet caramel. Taste is very good, caramel, malts, a touch of hop bitterness, lots of flavor coming through. Feels full bodied in the mouth and is highly drinkable. Overall this is a very good beer worth seeking out."
"A sort of fun beer, gimicky, too sweet and very shallow, but kinda cool. I won't be having another, but I could see many less demanding drinkers loving this."
"D. I will never buy this beer again. It's nothing special but I do give credit for the use of real caramel which this beer is very upfront about."
"Pretty bizarre beer. Wasn't crazy about it, didn't hate it either. I would consider having it again just because of the uniqueness it serves."
"D: Way too sweet for my taste."
"D - This just came out way too sweet for my taste. I love the caramel aspect of porters but this one was too overwhelming for me. If you like beers with a sweet candy-like flavor then this might be for you and you should definitely give it a shot."
"Sampled on September 2, 2010. The pour is too clea for a porter with a clear mahogany brown appearance with a thick two-inch puffy tan head. The aroma is full of cany sweet caramel, butterscotch and toffee rather than burnt chocolates typical of porters. The mouth feel is thin. The taste is just too sweet with its confectionary sugary caramel and butterscotch elements with a vague hoppy ending. Hard to drink."
"Drinkability: Could have a few more for sure. Great tasting."
"Drinks alright I could do a few prior to moving or getting sick of the caramel. If in the right mood I could do this with some doughnuts at breakfast"
"D: i wouldnt have one after this one."
"Poured from a chilly bottle into a pint glass. The beer has a dark brown color with some hints of ruby in it. There is a thick head of light brown bubbles. There is a little bit of lacing, but not much. It's too dark of a beer to see if there is any carbonation rising within. The aroma is a good mixture of roasted malts and caramel sweetness. The beer has a very strong caramel flavor, it overpowers almost everything else. It's not like a caramel malt, but more like the center of a piece of candy. It's a bit surprising, but enjoyable. The caramel hits you as soon as the beer touches your tongue and lasts until you swallow. Near the finish is a bit of toasted malt sweetness that is distinctly separate from the caramel flavor. All of the sweetness contributes to a tangible film that coats your mouth. There is a lot of carbonation that you can feel on your tongue. Having one of these beers is enjoyable; it would pair especially well with some chocolates. More than one may be a bit difficult; the high levels of sweetness and the thick mouthcoating would grow tiresome."
"D: Drinkable and fairly balanced. Not great but a solid brew."
"Drinkability: if you aren't deterred by the butterscotch-caramel touch they were going for, then it makes for a pleasant spin on a typical porter."
"salud!"
"In a word... Terrible."
"D - The smell gets in the way, but at least it's easily quaffable."
"The aroma is all sweet carmel. The flavor is full of carmel, brown sugar and some sweet malt. Very smooth with little bitterness. Pretty much a one trick pony. Carbonation is fairly low with a medium body. If you like carmel this is fairly drinkable, but I wouldn't want to have more than one in a row."
"Sweetness / caramel / botterscotch is forefront in the flavor, some sourness in the midpalate, beer finishes nicely. There are no detectable hops in this beer. I would expect more roast from a porter, but the carmel / butterscotch is the primary and dominant flavor. Mouthfeel is fine, its a little thin but not terrible. Drinkability is average. I think you could put this away rather quickly and there is no aftertaste, nothing really impeding you from finishing, kind of an average beer."
"The pour is decent, a clear deep brown with beautiful reddish highlights. A large light brown head caps the beer, leaving a little lace as it recedes. That's about where all good things end, 'cos the nose is one trainwreck. Artificial caramel flavor, sickly sweet (think Smuckers), brown sugar, and a malt characteristic more reminiscent of a brown ale than a porter. The palate opens sweet, with (surprise!) caramel, some sugar and malt with a little roast, before a long, dry finish with a metallic character comes through. Carbonation is high, making this fizzy on the palate, and this does not work with the metallic character of the beer. Just not worth drinking, this is a rather poor porter, and the addition of caramel just makes it rather horrific."
"I can see where some people might not like this beer. I can best describe it by comparing it to something you might find on a Starbuck's latte menu. It has coffee notes and a definite caramel taste. Actually, upon having another sip just now, all I can taste is caramel. It's unique and might prove to be a 'love it or hate it' beer. I'm just not sure how to place it..."
"Brrrrhhh. There's just so much caramel...so much bad candy sweetnetness. Tons of bad flavors. I just can't stand it. Even the smell is too much to take. It's a bizarre beer that few will like. It's just a cranked up, super-flavored brew. Ugh. Only useful for getting drunk."
"I'm not sure what they were trying to do with this beer, but it didn't work. It started out OK, dark brown color, small tan head. Not much aroma, just a little sweet. A porter taste, coffee/chocolate, but the damn caramel (or whatever it was, I couldn't tell for sure) kept intruding. It was medium bodied. Not a beer I'd want a lot of."
"D: Overall average drinkability here, the overbearing sweetness limits this to a dessert beer or a novelty try. One of matts better beers with a big flavor, however as a whole the beer started out strong but ended up limpering towards the end (mouthful, drinkability). Worth a single purchase and a curious try and delivers as a dessert beer."
"D. I really liked it. The smell was almost over sweet caramel, but it definately had some coffee character."
"One or two in a sitting is enough for me."
"It's a very dark brown and thicker than a normal beer. The head is a half finger of foamy brown. I could smell the sweetness with a casual sniff. The caramel flavor is somewhat strong, not overbearing. You feel in all the way down the throat and the flavor stays on your tongue for a while. Not bad, but it won't make my favorites list."
"Next time I see this one I'll pick more up."
"the mouthfeel of this drink will bring my review down...not at all impressed here...but is smooth to the point where you could drink another, but probably only after dinner as a dessert..."
"A 12 ounce bottle taken from a variety pack and poured into a standard shaker glass. Appears a clear medium chestnut color with about a finger of quickly dissipating light ecru foam. Smells and tastes of sweet caramelized malts and grains, bread, butterscotch candies. A bit thin bodied with medium carbonation. Worth at least one try if you happen upon a bottle."
"An odd beer all the way around."
"D - Not the best porter in the world, but certainly not a drain pour either. If you like caramel candy, you will likely enjoy this beer."
"Not a bad beer, but not great either, just very mediocre, to be honest."
"i knew this beer wasnt going to be great, but i had a lot higher expectations for it. as soon as i opened the bottle it filled the room with an aroma of buttery caramel. it pours a dark clear brown color, that reminds me more of a brown ale than a porter. it had an off white head that faded almost instantly to absolutlely nothing. the aroma was borderline offensive. it had a very fake smelling caramel. and there was a strong buttery smell as well. thats about it. the taste was pretty similar with the strong fake caramel and the butter going on. maybe a hint of roasted malts but not much going on. this beer reminded me nothing of a porter and it was flavored with very artificial caramel that even a non beer enthusiast could easily notice. this was a really pour showing from saranac. i tried tons of their other beers and most of them were ok, but this one really sucked, i had a hard time finishing the six pack. definately do not buy this."
"This is definitely a dessert beer. It doesn't actually taste bad, but if you can drink more than one, you have way more of a sweet tooth than me."
"I hate these types of beers on the market. I call them fake beers due to their artificial taste and smell. The beer looks great though, but thats the only thing good about it. The smell is of heavy caramel extract that over takes your nose to the point you want to gag. Taste is of caramel, again I say fake caramel its so obviously fake I don't even see how they sell it. Mouthfeel is what I would call thin but with a heavy carbonation feel too it. Overall like I said before the only good thing about this is the way it looks, other than that I wouldn't waste my money or time drinking this beer."
"D: Not bad overall. I would drink another."
"Overall - This is a well rounded beer fit for many occasions and meals. I would recommend this to accompany a meaty meal."
"Pretty thin, with evident carbonation. More ingredients would have been a good start."
"This just is not for me. Too sweet. This beer is all about caramel, with the ""porter"" part seemingly being an afterthought."
"The mouthfeel is decent, somewhat watery. Seems to be a trend in the Saranac line. Medium-light bodied. Carbonation provides a nice crispness, but it's still lacking. It goes down somewhat easily but the watered down body is getting tiresome. Overall, despite it's good aroma, it's not an impressive brew at all. When taking into consideration the fact that this is a porter... it's even worse."
"D - After all is said and done, this is a pretty drinkable sweet beer. While at times it can seem a watery mess and marginally artificial, overall I actually liked the beer. However it is a poor representation of a porter and moreso lacking in the taste and mouthfeel departments."
"Well, years of drinking craft beer have not changed my opinion of this brew. This is still a major dud. I won't come back a third time. Yuck."
"(rated Dec 10, 2007)"
"M = Body is just a little lighter than I would like, but it is a medium-light, so okay for the style, mouthcoating is pretty decent, carbonation is at a light frothy level that is enjoyable. The metallic and bitter/sour notes in the taste though cause an unpleasantness on my tongue that just cannot be ignored. This beer is just not right. I give them credit for trying something different, but they need to go back to the drawing board on this one."
"Drinkability: is high cause its not heavy at all"
"Drinkability: As I mentioned before, this beer reminds me of something I would order for desert. Sweet, tasty, very drinkable. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, so I don't think I could pound down more than a couple of these in an evening...but very enjoyable."
"Note - Never have I changed a review so many times... Continuity between bottles seems to vary greatly... I feel this ""final"" version of my review details the average of a recently finished six-pack."
"This is a gimick beer. Avoid it."
"There are other REAL porters to drink out there"
"This is definitely a disappointment. The idea, the look during pouring, the color, the great smell... then the mediocre flavor. I believe there isn't enough to this beer. It should have more robustness to it. It is a nice red amber with an acceptable head. The sweet smell of caramel and malts is very pleasing to the nose. Still not horrible, but it's not convincing me to go get more."
"This beer is excellent, the only beer I can think of thats better in the Sweet beer category is the Southern Tier Creme Brulee. BTIET. Definitely give this one a try if you come across it. The only thing with this beer is that it has that "" I Smell better than I taste"" thing going. It smells great, and tastes really good but its just not all the way there. If you like this style, I would recommend you seek out the Creme Brulee. you WONT be disappointed."
"D: A little too sweet"
"I see this beer has taken a bit of a beating but I was pleasantly surprised. It is sweet, but in a good way in my opinion. Smells and tastes like a pure caramel, almost like eating a sugar daddy.. man I love those things. The appearance and mouthfeel weren't too great but I couldn't get over the great taste. Maybe I'm just a sucker for caramel but I loved this beer."
"Try pairing with cheesecake!"
"This pours a very dark brown color with some red in it, thick head, but that goes away pretty quickly. The aroma was great, rich caramel and malty. Caramel flavor (of course) and malts and that are a bit sweet. Overall a little thin. I can see myself getting sick of this pretty quickly. Still, the one I had was pretty enjoyable."
"Pours a dark brown with red hues and an aroma like a caramel soda. Not much head and it fades relatively quickly with very little lacing. Medium carbonation (more than usual for a porter) and dry. But so damn sweet. Caramel, caramel, caramel. And a little toffee. Unusually light for a porter and slightly sour at the end. Not a bad beer, but not a good one either. The same could be said for this brewery."
"Pours a very dark brown with a thick light tan head. Nose is super caramel, but it's almost like someone put an additive in it, and it's not natural. Flavor is pretty caramel heavy as well. It's nice and robust and flavorful, yes. The artificial edge is just a bit too prevalent. It doesn't make it a bad beer or anything like that though. Feel is good. It's drinkable and nice enough, but like I said before, the artificial edge just doesn't work right."
"Drinkability here is alright. I've had this before and its not bad for a seasonal. Not for everyone and it really doesn't seem like a porter at all. Regardless, I'd suggest trying it, it's a nice social beer."
"Notes: One-dimensional and honestly pretty bad. I guess this might appeal to someone with a serious sweet tooth, as it really is like drinking alcoholic caramel."
"Notes: So this is not an everyday beer and certainly not to be had for sessions,yet I thought it was not too bad. A bit too sweet and this is my major complaint. Rework it and it could be something."
"Drinkability: Overall this beer is very dominated by caramel, which is cloying. It would be hard to drink a bunch of these."
"Pours a medium to dark brown in the glass with a small head that dissipates at a medium pace (couldn't resist) to a thin caramel colored ring leaving a minute amount of lacing. Smells slightly sweet and bready. Not much of a hop presence and I don't get a whole lot of caramel in the nose. The taste is a different story. It has a much sweeter presence on the tongue. Caramel and sweet chocolate are there as well as a dull bread. The sweetness coats the tongue a little too much for my liking. This is a little sweeter that I had prepared for. OK in small quantities."
"Very mediocre beer."
"Over all I am looking forward to the couple I have waiting in the kitchen."
"I can see it's potential, but I probably wouldn't call it a porter - more like a caramel flavored brown ale."
"It pours dark brown with a deep red hue. The head is foamy but small with a tan color and nice lace. It has a sweet aroma of caramel covered white bread. The flavor is simple but good with a heavy does of sweet caramel and some toasted malts. The flavor is almost candy like and fades slowly into the finish. Its palate is medium bodied and silky smooth. I always enjoy the caramely sweet flavor of this simple and tasty porter."
"A thick dark brown color with very scant white head and minor lacing. A strong butterscotch / caramel aroma and a faint touch of piney hops perhaps. The taste is a smooth sweet caramel and orange blend. It has a dry finish with fine carbonation. There's a raspberry touch with a hint of smoke. Fair drinkability. Not a flavor I can sink my teeth into but OK if you can handle the sweetness."
"D: If you dig the tastes I would give it a fairly good drink ability because it's not overly heavy or anything. Just didn't do much for me."
"Tasty beer, first one I've had from Matt Brewing. A caramel porter should have a major caramel presence, imo."
"D: A pretty drinkable beer overall. Can taste the caramel very easily, but it takes away from the burnt malt nature of the porter. Overall, a pretty good brew and I would recommend it."
"D= Ive had these sitting around..they are good when switching between brews but i dont think i would buy a sixer and drink it"
"If you like Porters and like beers with a dose of sweetness - highly recommended. If you're more into hops, stay away."
"D- Too sweet to consume quickly, but I could session these"
"One of Saranac's best best beers. This beer has a wonderful aroma taste and pour, it has just the right hints of chocalate and carmael. When i drink a beer I don't want friut or candy. This beer puts just the right hints in to make it very drinkable. I have only found it in muti packs and it would be nice to be able to buy it by the case."
"Bottle poured into a chilled pint glass with a 1-finger tan head sitting on top of a much-too-translucent amber-ruby body. Nose is implied roasted malt dominated by full-on caramel sweetness with too much butterscotch diacetyl action. The head subsides quickly, leaving little lacing. Body is creamy with a good amount of carbonation. Flavor profile is full steam-ahead in the direction of sweetness -- caramel butterscotch, with a slightly toasted undercurrent -- and the hops aren't remotely assertive enough. Cloying sweetness makes this unbearable in most contexts; perhaps suitable as a dessert drink if one is used to such sweetness."
"D: I rarely pour out a beer -- after half of the beer, down it went. Maybe after a meal for a dessert..."
"D - I could drink a few of these. Very good flavor and the aroma is the best part. I gave it a 3.5 drinkability only because I think the body is too light, which I couldn't stop thinking about."
"D: Not bad to have now and again. Not necessarily an easy drinker, because of how filling it is, mostly because of the sweetness."
"D - This is deffinetly a big beer and by no means a session beer. More than two and you feel like you just gorged yourself on candy after trick or treating. A very good replacement for that piece of cake after dinner."
"Sugary scents with a hint of vanilla--intriguing, if not unbeerlike... dark mahogany body with effervescent off-white head that settles swiftly into uneven tracings... immediately a cream and oil marriage...active tongue presence, much like a cream soda... the toastedness is too subtle to be a desirable porter --no smoke either, although the lingering aftertaste of dry malt and coffee isn't bad... caramel? yes, indeed... the finish is, again, more like a soda... active and a nice companion in the winter sampler..."
"D- Damn... Seriously, these are great to drink socially. I think if you're ONLY drinking these, then they could become monotonous... however, this is a great brew to go with food. I definitely recommend this for any stout fan who wants a tasty brew that doesn't stick to the rules."
"Duhh...pours a rich caramel with a big head and great lacing. Only caramel is obvious in the aroma...Taste is sweet, some malt presence..definite caramel...glad I like caramel. Mouthfeel is slightly creamy, sweetness is over the top. Drinkability likewise suffers through over sweetness."
"Lightly bitter finish. This one could be toned down a bit to make it more drinkable."
"The drinkability is low due to strength of caramel flavor. However, the beer pairs nicely with desserts."
"drinkability - Very easy drinking beer, not bad, something to try."
"D - Don't get me wrong, this is not a horrible beer. I did go down rather smooth. It was pretty well balanced. The only draw back is you get it in the 12 pack of winter beers, so you're kinda stuck with it."
"D- It was easy to drink but wouldn't recommend it as a session beer as the sweetness would get overbearing."
"I am not a big fan of coffee but this beer was very good. The sweetness got to me a little. Its not a thick or heavy beer but not far from it. Good beer, try it."
"D- The pleasant surprise from the caramel on the first sip is great, but the overly sweet caramel after taste gets rather tiring once the initial novelty is gone. After finishing the first one, I would most likely reach for something else."
"D- i can drink probably about 2 of these before i feel awake for the day then have to poop. Porters are not my style but i can deal with this one longer then the rest."
"Drinkability & Notes: This should be treated as a dessert beer and that is all, this is too damn sweet. I looked for the sweetness knowing what was on the label and it smacked my palate around, it was hard to drink another after this one let alone another beer all together as it ruined my palate with that cloying sweetness and caramel flavor."
"I couldnt drink another one of these, i could barely drink this one. it improved as it got warmer, but i think i would have to boil the next one to get it down."
"Was pretty cheap too, swiped it out of a friends' fridge while I was cleaning up from his new year's party."
"D= I drank one. I drank one a few weeks ago and thought better of it, but I realize now that was because of the cool caramel taste. Buy caramel, instead."
"I had to get this beer done.It is horrible.If it goes in your mouth its horrible"
"from the Saranac winter mix"
"Served in a standard pint glass. Poured the color of rootbeer, with ruby red highlights when backlit. Dense off-white head settled gradually into a thin, consistent slick of foam with light, sticky lacing. Scents of carmel and malt. Taste similar to nose but much less intense with a hint of butterscotch at the finish. Mouthfeel was very, very watery and not particuarly lively. Alcohol was virtually undetectable. Might be a good choice if you are looking for a session porter, but the caramel scent can be a little too cloying in my opinion."
"D: Not very drinkable, I had used one to make a beer bread earlier and I'm glad the winter 12 pack only has 2. So I drank the other, and didn't miss the one that had been put in the bread. The bread turned out pretty damn good though!"
"Pours a dark brown into the glass with a nice tan head that sticks around for a while and it sticks to the sides of the glass. I has a very sweet malty and caramely aroma. The taste delivers just that. Very sweet malty flavor with alot of caramel taste coming through. The caramel overpowers the rest of the beer and it is a very sweet beer. It has a very nice mouthfeel with not too much carbonation. Maybe more carbonation could have helped it. Due to its extremely sweet and overpowering caramel flavoring, it is only fairly drinkable."
"The Caramel Porter poured very nice with a nice head and dark amber hue. On first sip you can easily identify the caramel but there is also a strong taste of butterscotch. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would and I could imagine myself drinking this beer again. I think it would best be enjoyed on a cold winter night while relaxing with friends and family."
"D: Not so good -- way too sweet and one-dimensionally caramelly. I will avoid in the future."
"Drinkability. If you have a sweet tooth you may like this. I found it to be slightly overpowering. I personally didn't like it and probably wouldn't try it again. But just because I didn't like it doesn't mean you won't...give it a try anyways."
"Drinkability: IMO good beer to mix into a session to break samples up  perhaps not the best beer to start with"
"Pours a clear dark brown with hints of red and about a 1/4"" of tan head that exhibits decent retention. Smell is pleasant with a prominent caramel aroma supported by a solid maltiness. Taste is good, some dark crystal malts are present upfront but then give way to some biscuits and caramel. The caramel lingers into the finish but is overtaken by some slight roastyness in the form of possibly chocolate but more likely black patent malt. There really isn't much hop flavor in here but there is a bit of hop bitterness. Good mouthfeel, medium-light body and low-moderate carbonation. Drinkability is average. No real major flaws in this brew. Overall its pretty solid but the caramel can be a bit overwhelming in the aroma and, to a lesser extent, the taste."
"Drinkability: Excellent, for those of us with a sweet tooth, for those of you who aren't fond of sweet beers, it's still very drinkable, but you may need to take a break once in awhile."
"I like caramel and I like Porters, but this one seemed to fall short in both categories. I think the caramel was overdone a little which made a very sweet characteristic that doesn't fall in place with the rest of the beer. Not recommended."
"Overall, an interesting beer. Not really my cup of tea, as the balance is off; one dimensional. However, not awful, although I'd only partake of this one in the 12 mix pack."
"Saranac Carmel Porter is a overall a great beer, but definitely a one at a time thing. The sweetness of it is great, but a little overwhelming. I bought mine in a 12 winter mix pack (6 styles), which is great for sharing with friends."
"Alright, this beer isn't making the BA Top 100 any time soon, but I'd still recommend it. The problem is that it's only available in the Winter 12-pack, and that might be too big an investment for some people. Your best bet is to randomly find it on tap and go in with no expectations. Drink it if you see it."
"Poured with an amber-brown color but settled with a pretty dark appearance with some hints of amber in the light. The smell was out of this world: real caramel flavors at their purest literally permeated from the drink. The taste reflected that with the wicked sweet caramel flavor wrapped around every sip. The carbonation was pretty good, giving this beer a fascinating crispness that might loose some with its off-centered structure but might gain others with its uniqueness. Overall, this might not be for everyone but this is one of the best from Saranac and one of the best I have had."
"Drinkability: Caramel flavor dominates, I have not often had such a strongly flavored beer. The flavor is a bit unbalanced and I don't think that I could have more than one."
"I can't finish it."
"Poured a decent brown color, not as dark as many porters, but not bad. It had a bit of head and a bit of lacing. Not a very deep scent, very little in the way of a nice burnt grain or coffee or any other porter like scent, but a little was there and the tiny hint of caramel kept it from going below average. Nice taste, although not as deep as it could have been. A bit of a weak porter flavor, but the caramel helped out, making it a sweet porter that was pretty good. Goes down very smooth! Even if it's not the best porter, I'll have no trouble drinking all of the ones I have."
"Part of the 12 Beer of Winter pack. Pours a weak cola-brown color with a thin head. The immediate impression from the aroma is that of sherry. Also a good bit of caramel on the nose. The flavor is caramel, coffee and very sweet. Theres plenty of carbonation to tingle the tongue, perhaps a bit too much. This one seems a little thin for a porter. The sweet caramel flavor is different, if not a bit sweet."
"i felt festive so i got the 12 beers of x-mas sampler ; this one pours a dark garnet color w/ a slight head which dissapates quickly leaving little lacing in my nonic ; smells like dark roasted malts, butterscotch, and faint nuts ; caramel galore, has nice balance w/ the malts and hop bitterness, the artificial-type sweet taste throughout was slightly distracting, takes away from the dry, nutty, caramely taste ; nice rich mouthfeel a little too carbonated for me, though ; a nice brew, great one for the season, love the 5.5 ABV too !!!..."
"Give it a shot if you like the sweet stuff, but I can't really recommend it. Tons of other American Porters out there, and flavored ones as well, that don;t kill the brew with caramel."
"12 ounce bottle, part of the Saranac 12 beers of winter pack. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours dark brown with an inch tan head. Lacing and head retention are both good. The aroma is very sweet, it smells like caramel and butterscotch. Caramel is the strongest taste in the beer, but there's also butterscotch and a bit of hops in the finish. It's a mostly sweet tasting beer, but the sweetness isn't overpowering. Mouthfeel is medium, with moderate carbonation and it leaves a slight coating on the tongue. Drinkability is good, it's smooth but could be better if the carbonation was cut down just a little bit. I like this beer, but then I like sweet tasting beers. If you don't care for sweet beers, then this might not be the choice for you."
"Cool idea, but falls very short of being a good beer. Average beer."
"Pours very dark brown with a medium sized off-white head. Aroma is very interesting- caramelly and sweet. And there's a really strong buttery smell upfront. Like sweet buttery caramel. The taste is similar to the smell. Sadly it doesn't work as well as a flavor. Strong sweet caramel with that butter note again. Medium to full bodied. Not one I'd want to have a lot of- the flavors are just too different. I can't decide whether I like this or not. It is at least unique though."
"This is pretty much candy in a bottle. If you love caramel, this is the beer for you. If you love porters, you might be better off looking elsewhere."
"I can see why this wouldn't get consistently good reviews. It's obviously not for everyone but I cannot fault Saranac for taking a solid porter and adding caramel to it. It's just different for one thing and similar to how some people enjoy pumpkin or spiced beers."
"Really good on a cold day in warm house kind of beer."
"D I enjoy this beer when I have it but it is definitely not a session beer. I remember I had 4 of these one night and I was spitting caramel secretions all night. Not a bad beer at all and definitely worth a shot at the price."
"The mouthfeel is the part where this beer could use some work. It's too thin, though not thin enough to make it undrinkable. This is a very drinkable beer and I could easily see myself drinking several of these in a night. It was very enjoyable. I had it right before dessert (which happened to be baked apples with which the beer paired nicely)."
"Overall I was not impressed with this beer. It's made well, just too sweet for me. Won't get it again."
"I hate to be so hard on a beer, especially when the brewers were being so adventurous, and for that, i'll give you kudos... but ""hints of caramel""? This guy beats you in the face. I don't taste those fancy fuggles & kent hops in here -- it's almost a chemical tasting beer. Sorry guys, but I think you missed on the attempt here."
"The drinkability is ok but not a beer I would but more of. MK"
"D: Very approachable, a little too sweet to session."
"I don't know why this beer tastes so bad, as the idea is a good one. It's just way too artificial and overpowering."
"One of the beers i'd hope Saranac would remove from the 12 beers of winter. I've just never really liked this offering, which is why this bottle lasted so long."
"An interesting beer, this Saranac Caramel Porter. Pours a deep dark brown color with a thick off-white head that holds some shape and leaves a nice lace. Crimson red hues shine through when the beer is held up to the light. I think this is a very pretty porter. Aroma is sweet; almost too sweet. Caramelish notes are oddly mixed in with burnt coffee smells and butterscotch. I'm strangely attracted to this smell and repulsed by it at the same time, hence the 2.5 grade for smell. Definitely rich and malty aroma, with no real sense of hops. The taste simply adds to this bizarre experience. I expected this beer to be sweet up front, but it's not. It's bitter up front, and the caramel/vanilla sweetness emerges in the middle, and is followed up again in the finish by a bitter-tart burnt coffee flavor. Weird stuff here. A thin mouthfeel, but not offensive. I'm not entirely sure I would call this a ""drinkable"" beer, but I'm glad I tried it. It might go well with dessert; maybe a creme brulee, or a rice pudding. But otherwise I wouldn't wholeheartedly recommend this beer unless you like strange sweet/bitter beers."
"its going to be hard to finish drinbking this candy....its not horrible but i wouldnt choose it again"
"Looks impressive at first -- dark brown, with over an inch of billowing head, which did leave decent lace on the sides of my imperial pint glass. And the smell is inviting -- milk chocolate, latte, and of course, some buttery caramel. But on the tongue, all that this beer could have been is lost to a powerful butter caramel that tastes fairly artificial -- I think it's the butteriness that really does it for me. I enjoy breweries taking risks, and have been a longtime fan of Saranac, but I found this to be a slick, syrupy beer that I don't really want to drink much of. Sorry."
"I think what I don't like about it is the fakeness of the caramel. It's obviously something that's been intentionally added, not naturally occuring in the basic ingredients of beer (hops, malt, water, yeast). I typically do not like beer that has fake stuff added to it, but for some reason this seems alright to me."
"Overall: Will pass the other 5 on to someone else. heres just something not quite right about it. Too hard to drink."
"pours very dark brown with a three finger medium tan head that fades quickly with some lacing. smell and taste was of a funny not right caramel. to strong and to sweet not to my taste at all. mouthfeel on the light side and carbonation was ok. didn't care for it at all will not buy again."
"Medium body, with a dry, lingering aftertaste. I wasn't expecting much from this one, so I am not completely disappointed. Not really bad, but I know I won't be purchasing this one again."
"overall this is a dissapointing beer it tasted way too sweet kind of like a kool aid beer"
"DA: This brew delivers what it promises, Caramel! Not Bad."
"Pours a clear ruby red color with a small, quickly fading tan head. No trace of lacing. Smell is very sweet, loaded with caramel and butter, much like caramel popcorn. Taste is very much the same, very little up front, a wave of caramel with a buttery blast in the middle, and a tiny bit of bitterness at the end to remind you that you are drinking beer and not actually enjoying liquidized caramel popcorn. Very light in body and watery for a porter. After a while the beer gets somewhat sickening. It was almost too sweet, but was interesting. I think it would be better with a dessert sundae, but I wouldn't want to have to enjoy a whole sixpack of this."
"D - This is a very interesting porter. It is not very porter-like. There is a fruity/tannin quality reminds me of a red wine, like a merlot or a cabernet. Very interesting."
"Overall, it might be worthwhile to try one of these if you like caramel, though I'd shy away from buying a six pack."
"Drinkability: Rather doscile for a porter. A craft brew porter should have more flavor."
"This beer poured with a thin, light-tan head that quickly dissipated to nothingness. The color was a deep brown with ruby highlights. The nose was very sweet, carmelized, with a light smokiness. Mouthfeel was full with a smoky, sweet taste on the tongue. The finish was really caramel-like, with a taste not unlike sucking on a Sugar Pop. My fillings ached from the memory. I cannot say that it was an unpleasant experience, unlike some malt-driven beers in recent memory, but it still was not my cup of tea."
"Caramel Porter is my twelfth Matt Brewing Company beer and I haven't given one of them a flavor score higher than 3.5. That has to be some sort of a personal record. This brewery seems to be constantly spinning its wheels, putting out style after style without gaining any sort of traction toward what I would consider good craft beer. Call me an optimist or call me an idiot, I still have hope that one will surprise me someday."
"Overall: A little too sweet for my liking, but overall not bad. It might do well alongside a slice of chocolate cake, or alone as a dessert beer."
"Poured this beer from the bottle to a tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer had a nice dark roasted look with a tan head that was just kinda okay. First think that hits you is the smell. WOW, does it smell good. Like nutty caramel that has been chewed up by an elephant and spit in yo face. And the taste is about the same . WAY caramel to the point of over bearing. I still liked the beer and think Saranac could have a great beer if they just toned down the caramel about halfway. I have one more left and i think I'm going to mix it with (or cut it) something else like a hoppy beer and see if that clashes too bad. I actually might buy this again, but it is certainly not one to sit down and drink 4 of."
"The beer is light, and would be easy to drink if not so sweet. Generally, it may be good for someone who's not a beer drinker.... but for most people on this site, I'd say stay away. It's dissapointing for a porter. It could be a Caramel ___ (fill in the blank with any style). I initially thought maybe they just put caramel flavor in a light lager, with some food coloring, until I read the label that says they used Caramel malt. There simply is not enough of a roasted or nutty character to classify this as a porter."
"D: This beer has intrigued me since I heard about it and it was darn close to what I was expecting. If you can handle the extreme sweetness its a little tasty and can go down easily enough. Its not very filling and is a decent representation of style apart from the caramel twist. This beer would probably go perfectly with many desserts, but Im not sure I could sit and drink more than one or two these in a sitting without getting sugar overload in my taste buds."
"A below par offering. This one would sweeten up and smoked barbeque meal. Stay away from this bottle from the mixed pack, unless you can't control your curiosity."
"The flavor is for those who like it sweet. The caramel is so prominent that it reaches a candy-like level that only fans of sweet sweet beers will enjoy. There is, thankfully, some hoppy bitterness that helps keep the caramel character in check, but it's still crazy sweet. A rich nuttiness appears in both flavor and finish, and with a well-carbonated yet oily mouthfeel, it's one of Saranac's more daring and interesting offerings. Not everyday-drinkable, due to that cloying caramel, but still, I found this to be pretty enjoyable."
"This brew looked good, sounded good but was all off on the taste. Poured a dark amber and blasted my nose with caramel aromas. Sickly sweet artificial caramel flavor- hard to get down. Not much else, a slight hop bitterness but not nearly enough to break the caramel. After a few sips, this beer had a date with the drain."

"D: Smooth and easy. Not great, but worth a try--drinkable porter."
"Not very thick for a porter, but has a decent feel. Lingers on the tongue afterward. It's a delicious, sweet caramel brew (though to categorize it as a porter might be slightly misleading). Original and highly drinkable, especially on a cold winter evening."
"It's mouth feel is nothing to write home about, and overall drink ability is ok a best. I have been drinking these for years before I got into real brew tasting and I was never a fan of this flavor, but even now though, I have a hard tiem getting excited about this Saranac."
"D: A sweet, but light, beer. Does not have any similarities to any other porters I have had, and I dont mean that in a good way. I wanted this to be awesome, but alas, it was a let down. Definitely not a drain pour by any means though; just nothing anyone should look forward to."
"Drinkability--Nothing offensive about this one, but not one I'm likely to revisit on a regular basis."
"Poured a dark brown with amber highlights, small tan head that dissipated quickly leaving no lacing. The smell of buttery toffee, caramal, real sweet. The taste was sickly sweet, artifical, with a slight roast aftertaste. The mouthfeel was light and fizzy. Due to the sweetness of this porter, I could only have one of these. Not a big fan."
"Cheers!"
"A lame porter."
"D - not my thing. If you like really sweet, rich beers with an almost artificial sugar/caramel flavor, give it a try. But I will not be having this one again - ever."
"Overall, a nice porter with a strong caramel presence. I thought the mouthfeel was a tad thin for the style, but still enjoyable nevertheless."
"very very very sweet beer. you can smell the sweetness as soon as you pour it. the caramel just drips off this brew. borederline too sweet but for some reason i find this enjoyable. not overly enjoyable but pretty good. incredibly swee. a dessert in itself. could ner be a session beer but is one of those good once in a while beers."
"drinkable?:yes indeed, never gets to bright bitter or over powering, very smooth and easy."
"D: The drinkability is limited, this strikes me as an experiment gone horribly awry."
"M&D - the caramel lends this beer a unique smoothness, its easy down, with a higher drinkability"
"Pours a very dark brown with a redish hue. Not much of a head, but decent lacing. Smell is all carmel. Body is thick with some carbionation. Taste is sweet carmel throughout, with maybe a hint of coffee in the finish. I prefer a stright porter,but this was a nice change. Too sweet for more than one or two."
"Yet again another Winter pack beer...Pours a dark brown color with a reddish tint (poured from a bottle into a pint glass). Had a decent head with little retention and some lacing. Smells like caramel (no way). The taste is also a very strong caramel, with a hint of toffee. Feels very heavy in the mouth, with good body. Overall, a good beer..very tasty...a very interesting taste, which everyone should check out..."
"Pours a deep, dark, clear, red color with a medium head of tight tan/brown bubbles. Looks great in the glass. Aroma is pure candy caramel. The taste is, well, candy caramel. Aftertaste is you guessed it, candy caramel. Roasty mixed with sweet, rich caramel throughout. I actually remember hating this in the past, but this years I enjoyed. Not something to drink as a session or frequently, but a nice holiday treat. I cant see a non beer drinker that likes caramel not loving this one. A little lacking in the porter qualities for me, but enjoyable none the less. Seemed less artificial than in the past?"
"Dark and rich. Extremely dark and extremely rich. With a bit of sweet in the aftertaste. The first few sips were a delight. After that, it became a bit too sweet and the dark carmel flavor came through like liquid English Toffee candy. Combined with the smoky flavor of the porter, it was a bit much for me. But wow what an incredibly delightful mixture of tastes (albeit for a short few sips). Not quite drinkable enough as a session beer, but to impress and to enjoy during the holidays (for instance), a keeper."
"The taste is also incredibly sweet. Caramel, birthday cake, syrup, pretty much anything you can think of to really sweeten a beer. There is little-to-no hop presence either, making the taste a bit over bearing. Mouthfeel is clean and carbonated. I like sweet beer, but this one is a bit over the top. This isn't a dessert beer; it IS dessert. I can't see myself trying this one again."
"Overall a decent low ABV dessert beer. Not meant, in my opinion, to be an everyday drinker or even a session beer. A dessert beer is what this is and is rather drinkable as such."
"Not very caramel like. It poured a nice thick dark color. The mouthfeel was one of the best I have ever had, but the taste was pretty bad, and so was the smell. Neither of which resembled caramel. I would not recomend this, but if you're even rometly interested then get a single bottle. Don't drink and review."
"Thanks Saranac for making so many different styles for such an affordable price... and making 12 different interesting styles available in one package! the 12 beers of winter are more than worth it."
"D: There's just no way I could drink more than one of these, and I'm kind of glad there was only one in my Winter 12-pack. This beer absolutely would have its uses for me, but they pretty much all involve dessert. Pairing it with something creamy would work (vanilla cheesecake, for one). Maybe using this in waffle batter that you then serve with ice cream and fruit would work. But as a beer that you sit back and sip: it just didn't do it for me. It's unique, I'll give it that. It isn't balanced, though."
"Mouthfeel was decent, but not great. Smell was excellent though.. lots of sugar, caramel, and spices. I could only have two glasses though, any more than that and I probably would have gone into sugar shock!"
"This was an excellent porter. I could definitely taste the caramel overtones. I paired it with a bacon cheeseburger that I prepared on a gas grill and the two went perfectly together. I consider Yuengling Porter to be the benchmark of American Porters and I would have to consider this to be a few notches above it. I disagree with those that don't feel that this is a true porter. This is what a porter should be."
"A little too sweet to consider having more than one in a session. Hard to see this as a porter, since as noted it has no real roasted malt contribution. Probably an acquired taste."
"This beer starts off with a good appearance and a good smell but then loses a little steam. The taste is pretty good, with hints of caramel but the mouthfeel is only average and it has an average drinkability. Overall, slightly above average but certainky nothing to write home about."
"Drinkability is OK. Like most of the Saranac line, it's mild and inoffensive. If I came across it on tap in a little bar in the middle of nowhere, I could easily session it."
"Drinkability is OK. Like most of the Saranac line, it's mild and inoffensive. If I came across it on tap in a little bar in the middle of nowhere, I could easily session it."
"Dark brown with a see through ruby color , very little head stayed short. Caramel is the name and the scent. Strong caramel dominates but smelled a little like a Brachs Butterscotch disc. Unusual but appetizing for a porter. Mouth really foamed on the tounge and there was a tad of bitter, but mostly the sweet butterscotch was the aftertaste. That said, it wore off. Nothing about this tasted even remotely porter. The caramel dominates, straight up and in your face. There was a bit of bitterness but none of the chocolate/coffee tastes that would make this a really great porter. Only after concentrating on the taste, did I really get a touch of burnt coffee. It wasn't really bad, a caramel beer. I'm going to say it's average drinkablity because I could have a few, but it's too odd to get again. Sweet butterscotch/caramel is another I'd put on the fruity beer pile."
"This was not enjoyable, I'm pretty sorry I drank this and indeed sorry I bought the mixed 12. It seems that all there beers are good in concept and idea, get a good start, but fail to pull through and deliver a quality product. I'll pass on this."
"The color was a deep brownish color. A little lighter than a typical porter. There was a large head on my beer. The smell was unmistakingly caramel. The taste was very sweet. There was a lot of caramel in the taste as well. The mouthfeel was smooth. No outstanding bitterness. The drinkability is good as well. This could be a session brew if you like sweeter beers."
"D: If you like very sweet beers then this is the beer for you. I could only drink one as this beer was too sweet for me."
"Not a bad offering. I enjoyed this beer, but don't think I'd want to drink a lot of these in a row due to the strong caramel aroma."
"THE BLOODHOUND FACTOR: Benjie wasn't interested, but Peaches again gave props to Saranac for a superior product, and quickly consumed her small share."
"Very concentrated caramel malt aroma. Dark red/brown darkening almost to black toward the top of the glass. Thumb thick tan head. The caramel blasts you in the fore and doesnt go away. Very one dimensional and sweet, but it goes very well with Christmas music. The finish is slightly bitter, but mostly it is smooth malty caramel."
"Aromas are over-the-top caramel. Not a pleasant aroma. An over-done, nothing else even comes close to making it through caramel funk. I thought a porter was supposed to have something resembling a roasted malt character...not here. Flavor is thin and watery caramel water. That's it. Horridly one-dimensional and not representative of the style."
"Man, this beer tastes just terrible. I like carament, but I do not like the putrid, sickly sweet and overpowering caramel taste that this beer presents. I don't mind Saranac beers on the whole, but this one was just undrinkable. Their other offerings are all better."
"				~Benjamin Franklin"
"Most of the beers in the pack so far have been a bit of a disappointment, and this one is no exception. Not a lot of hops, depth, nor lasting power to this beer, and even though it's 5.5% ABV, I wouldn't even consider this anywhere near a session brew It's a lot of liberty to call this a porter, when in fact, it's a novelty, like the Sam Adam's Cranberry Lambic. I'm glad I tried this once, but I wish Saranac would concentrate on solidifying their offerings instead of creating a beer like this that makes wonder what they were thinking when they came up with this..."
"well malted and carmel to make go down A melange of porter and burnt rubber and maybe burnt wood. Highly roasted aftertaste. Nice colour. Medium mouthfeel. Sweet but not cloying. In any case, I will save the rest for tenderizing meat in the slow cooker."
"As mentioned, this is not a drinkable beer. It is really awful. Its a drain pour. I hope by this point of the review you had figured that out. I enjoy Saranac beers, generally. I hope this is rock bottom, I pray I dont ever taste worse from these guys. Or any other brewery for that matter. This is one of the worse beers I have tasted. This offering was part of a 12-beer sampler that I purchased in Lawrence, KS. Its a major dud, I say avoid it."
"A clean dark brown beer with ruby highlights. Has a nice creamy dark beige head with some lace. The aroma is ... yes you quessed it caramel with a nice bit of toffee in the background. The flavor starts with a kiss of sweet caramel on the tip of your tongue. Followed by a roasted malt bitterness and that nice toffee note and a bite of hops on the finish."
"Pours a dark amber mahonagny, with good clarity. Fizzy one finger head briefly holds a thin cap, then dissapears, leaving minimal lacing. Strong caramel and molasses aromas, with a background chocolate malt scent. Some roasted barley flavor, but mostly caramel and brown sugar taste. Aftertaste is still sweet, with some mild english hop notes. Light-medum bodied and evenly carbonated. Finish is a touch residual sweet, but the mouthfeel is smooth. This beer relys too much on artificial sweeteners, and is not the best example of the style, but this is probably what the brewers intended."
"I think that if the caramel was toned down, this could become an alright beer."
"Not very drinkable. Can't decide if I should slam down or dump into sink. However I'd bet some macro drinkers would like this one."
"Purchased as part of a special holiday 12 pack. Pours a dark translucent ruby brown with a thin tan head. I can't believe how sickly sweet this beer smells! Smells like cooked caramel candy and cheap candy at that. Thin, syrupy and way too sweet. Could not even finish it. Not impressed at all. I hope the other offerings are better than this one."
"The porter pours a dark translucent amber with a tan head. The aroma is of sweet caramel malts with some dark fruit overtones. The taste is really like a creme de ley but with a bit of coffee in the finish. It's a very intriguing taste. The body is rather light and watery, but very smooth. This is a beer I'm glad I tasted, but I'm not sure I'd buy a six or order one at a bar."
"Pours a dark red color with a small thin tan head. No lacing after the head fades away. Aroma is all caramel and a touch of malt. Taste is sweet caramel and that is about it. It starts off smooth with the caramel front but nothing else develops or is noticeable after that. It has a bit of a thin feel in the middle and finishes sweet. The flavor is there but nothing else happens. It is not awful and I would take this brew over any macro but it just inst greataverage is a safe call."
"Pours a very dark reddish brown with a medium sized, light tan, creamy, quickly diminishing head. Its a well named beer with as much caramel as there is in the nose. Actually, its a little more like butterscotch, and has a light hop presence. The taste follow with a hefty wallop of caramel thats VERY candy-like with just a little bitterness on the finish. It has a medium body, lightly syrupy texture, and low carbonation. Its rather weak on the finish and a bit too sweet (though I know thats what they were going for). I found it to be an enjoyable beer once you got over the shock of the added caramel and wicked sweetness, but being classified as an American porter, I have to knock major points off this beer for being in no way a good representation of the style."
"Yet another mediocre beer from the Matt Brewing Company."
"Fine body but, well, not drinking another, you know?"
"This caramel porter is a nice dark amber color. The head is minimal but lasts. The smell is strong, all that comes through is the caramel. At first taste the caramel is all that the palate can discern. However, the flavor grows, as the brew warms up, and the hops and malts become a bit more discernable. A porter worth giving a try. But be sure to drink this on the warm side. Enjoy."
"Altogether, its really not that bad a beer, but it will be way too sweet for some, lets just call it a couple of pints of dessert."
"Pours a two-fingered light tan head that slowly fades leaving a good lace. Nice clear, deep amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Strong sweet caramel nose. Starts sweet, smooth caramel flavor, clean finish. Nice porter. 12 oz bottle from their winter sampler 12-pak $9.99, Market Basket Concord, NH."
"The finish is caramel sweet to the end, and in that respect, it is very consistent. I don't think this would make a good session beer myself; a bit too sweet for my tastes. However, as a part of a sampler, it might provide a novel tasting experience. Not one of Saranac's best, in my opinion."
"Drinkability: One bottle is enough of this its almost to dam sweet."
"D - It would go okay with beef or lamb dishes, but there are better options. I am not sure if I am going to finish this. I've had worse. The smell is interesting, but the rest of the beer just comes up short. This isn't an unbearable experience, but it isn't one that I will soon repeat."
"D - This is a slightly above average one-off cold-weather drinking beer that's a good addition to the Saranac Winter pack. Unfortunately, this beer is stuck in the same neighborhood of mediocrity as many of the other Saranac beers."
"Pours a dark mahogany with crimson highlights, two fingers of beige head, actually some decent retention and lacing as well. Smell was pure caramel, pretty strong, candy store strong, nothing else though. Taste is more of that single note, a sweet cloying caramel, overwhelming any roasted malt, that's present and just a slight hop note on the end that's really hard to detect. There is nothing porter-like about this beer. The mouthfeel is also on the thin side like most Saranac beers, and combined with the one-note sweetness this is really more like drinking a soda than a beer. This is the first new one I've tried out of the winter pack, and this is a real dud. I'm not even sure if I can finish this one--definitely won't be trying another."
"This is a totally unique beer, and not (at least for me) in a Crazy Ed's Cave Creek Chili beer way. Saranac thought outside the box with this one and I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Not my favorite, not sessionable, and not for everyone, but I'll heap the kudos..thumbs up."
"While its a bit on the sweet side, its still pretty tasty and very drinkable. The finish is a little weak, but its got a great caramel maltiness. Recommended."
"This is a rough one. Translucent reddish, purply brown. Dark tan head with some lacing, all falling to a firm table. Smell is hard candy sweet destroying most of the ""beer"" odors. A thin mouthfeel combined with an unpleasant sweetness make this a brew to forget. This is difficult to finish one bottle. The spouse was ok with it. I'm not. Not recommended."
"Sampled from the 12 Beers of Winter Variety pack, the Caramel Porter is the worst I've tried yet from the box. It looks nice enough, in fact it looks pretty great. It pours very dark with nice ruby highlights on the edges when held up to light. A medium sized tan head forms. This is where it stops being good though. The aroma is caramel. That's it. Caramel, caramel candy, caramel syrup, whatever you want to call it. The taste is the same, the caramel dominates everything. I like caramel, but I also like beer and this has nothing to suggest beer. The mouthfeel is fine I guess, but the drinkability is terrible; way to cloying and sweet. It gets worse as it warms and releases the caramel even more. I actually think I would like a caramel flavored porter, but I didn't like this caramel syrup drink mess."
"Flavor was about the same as the scent... caramel and not much else. If this had a nice porter flavor with the caramel added on it would be nice, but it doesn't. With the caramel is a creamy vanella flavor like ice cream. I can't see myself drinking much of this at all due to it's overpowering sweetness and lack of beer character."
"cheers..."
"Drinkability: I probably couldn't have too many of these because of the sweetness (though I don't think it's extremely overpowering like some poorly made fruit beers can be), but damn I'd like to pair this with a piece of cheesecake or something of that nature, as I'm sure it'd go pretty well with it."
"Pours a semi dark brown, not quite the usual almost black color, with a two finger head, decent longevity and good lace. Huge amounts of caramel aroma, not much roastyness to speak of. A very odd beer, not bad, just odd. A very sweet caramel taste is present, but its not very porter like. Yes there are some roated flavors and coffe like bitterness, but not enough to call it a porter. I think a more appropriate name for this would be a caramel bitter, although it doesn't quite have the same ring to it, does it. Again not a bad beer, just different. Give it a try for yourself and see what you think."
"Not a bad beer but one that maybe should be classified as something else."
"Poured a 12 ounce bottle from Saranac's 12 Beers of Winter (or Christmas). A nice deep ruby color, with very little light penetrating except for around the edges of the glass. Good head retention with some minor lacing afterwards. A rather strong toffee/butterscotch/caramel aroma that clearly warns the drinker that the beer is going to be sweet. I expected sweetness; after all, it is a CARAMEL porter. Even though there is a slight hint of bitterness (good thing too!), the sweetness just overpowers the beer because over time, the bitterness can no longer be tasted. Not a good balance at all. I must say it is a full-bodied flavor with an undertone of chocolate, but it's really like drinking candy. I wouldn't expect anyone to drink more than one since your tastebuds are going to be thrown out of whack after one sip of this. Good thing I had this at the end of the meal."
"This was a rollarcoaster of a beer to say the least. The appearance was quite nice, with it's big, solid tan head and dark amber body. The smell was nothing too bad, just a little heavy on the caramel and a tinge of the hops. The taste was not too good. It was a little interesting, so I gave it a 2.5 instead of a 1.5. The caramel was little too much for me though. It made it more like a pudding or desert, something to that effect. It's kind of hard to put this one down, due to the super sweetness of the beer. Not something I would recommend to anyone, but it is another beer down in the reviews for me."
"Nice deep brown color-some great chestnut/mahogany hues but nowhere near a porter in color. Fantastic aroma-really screams caramel. Somewhat toffeeish flavor-definate malt backbone though the caramel/toffee flavor is the real standout here. No real roasted or chocolate flavors that would make this a porter. The flavor is not unpleasant-just different. Body is a tad thin-could use a boost. An enjoyable beer overall. Nice, somewhat lighter dessert beer. I dont find it overly sweet but it is definately an acquired taste."
"Overall, this is just, flat-out, a bad beer in my opinion. The first beer that I've poured down the drain in a very long time. Reminds me of my first homebrew, and thats definately not a good thing. I recommend the 12 Beers of Winter, but give this one away."
"Dammit, I want to like this beer, but I feel I've been truthful. Not impressive, just barely worth a try, and a damn shame too because I psychically know that Saranac brewers can do so much better. However, this is possibly the BEST option, especially in a mixer pack, for a transition beer or something to bring to a party. It's inoffensive and highly drinkable (when you don't have to focus overmuch) but just intriguing enough to try something more intense."
"This pours a dark reddish brown with a small head that disappears quickly.The aroma is all carmel and maybe cola,not much else.The carmel taste dominates this beer.There is a coffee aftertaste,but not much else.This is a bit watery,so I would give it a light m/f,not what a porter should be.All in all, I don't think I'll be buying this again when there are so many better porters out there."
"Poured a deep red color without much of a head, crystal clear. Smell was intensely of caramel with a little bit of malt, almost overly sweet. Taste was great. I know a lot of the other reviews are saying that it was too sweet, but I disagree. The caramel did overpower any other flavors but I still enjoyed it. Anyone drinking this beer should know that caramel will be the main flavor they get out of it. There was a little bit of malt flavor and no hops to speak of. Light mouthfeel. This would be a great after-dinner beer."
"Drinkability: It doesn't taste as sweet as it smells...which is a good thing. Still, I think this would be better served as an after dinner drink or an apertif. I can't imagine pairing this with anything in a meal. Maybe some pork loin. A pretty average beer and an interesting twist on the style. I wouldn't go so far as to say ""not recommended"" but that's just my opinion..."
"Because I'm a bit of a sucker for these sweeter and more succulent tastes, I have a tendency to exercise a kinder hand in review. But the lack of true porter-like character makes the base beer seeming like a very nondescript dark ale of America or Europe- except with the deceiving succulence of artificial caramel sweetness. The beer may make for a nice ice cream float."
"purchased as part of sampler pack. Poured a deep reddish color with slight tannish head that persisted as a fine ring. Smell is of sweet caramel with onle a bit of roasted notes. Taste is a bit sweet for me, with the caramel overpowering any porter aspects. Finish is also too sweet. Just an OK beer."
"Pours a deep dark brown with hints of red. The head was nice and frothy and dwindled to a 1/4 inch froth after a few minutes. Nose is pretty much all caramel with a subtle hint of malt in the background. The taste is sweet caramel with a bit of maltiness, the hops are there, but are really relegated to a bit role. Even though this is a sweet beer, I didn't find it to be cloyingly sweet as others have stated. For what it is, I think it's a nicely balanced beer and would best serve as a dessert beer as the caramel flavor is so assertive. I wouldn't drink more than one of these before moving on to something else, but it does make a nice nitecap beer. It's kind of like drinking a Sugar Daddy."
"Very dark brown after the pour. Not much of a head and no lace. Aroma is very sweet and malty. Strong caramel notes on the nose too. Which follow through into the flavor. Slight chocoalte, but the caramel is nice and strong. A buddy of mine has been talking about this beer for 2 years and I finally had the chance to try one. Not bad. I commend his comments. The malts are nicely balanced by a very subtle hop backdrop. But the caramel is omnipresent. Mouthfeel is almost full bodied and heavy on the palate. The only problem with this beer is that it is like eating a rich desert, after a bottle (maybe two) I think I woill have had my full for the day."
"There are better Saranac beers and Porters out there!"
"Smells like cream soda. Is there any malt aroma underneath all this candy? There is finally a dirty-earthy smell.. Taste? Let's just say this, I'm passionate about porters, and that's why this one bothers me. It tastes like a dingy ale with candy added to hide the problems. This just doesn't make a porter [period]. I won't go any further.. because.. I can't."
"Woah. Pop open this one and take a whiff of the crazy caramel aroma. It had a nice half inch head that lasts for a minute of so. I taste the caramel right away but i guess this could also be taken as syrup, or anything insanely sweet. The mouthfeel is a very smooth and a little stickey. I probably won't be needing too many of these tonight but it is interesting. Not the best in terms of drinkability."
"At first this beer tastes like a normal porter, with some spicy hops that bite in the beginning but once you get into it the caramel hits. Very sweet, a little too much which makes this a strange beer. It's light in body I feel, very easy to drink but so sweet I don't know why I'd want to. I enjoyed one, but I can't think of any reason why I'd decide to get another aside from the pint special. Saranac has better beers for the same price, so go with those."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Overall this beer can serve as a niche beer or dessert, but not much else. Glad I only have one from the sampler."
"Drinkability/comments: I nearly poured this one down the drain, but at the last second reminded myself that it was in fact an alcoholic beverage and persevered. The least appealing flavored beer I've had to date."
"Whew. I don't know if I can justify this with a full review. Pours a deep brown color, some light can shine through without much of a head at all. A thin lace soon dots the surface. One whiff and you'll know what this beer is about. Being fake. Loads and tons of carmel. Not carmel malt, but like boiled down sugar. Sickly sweet gooey carmel and not much else. The taste is much the same. A thin and soupy porter is steamrolled by syrupy tooth rotting sugar and carmel. I tried to find the acidic dark malts that ought to have balanced such a liberal dosing of carmel, but they were hiding in fear. Far too sweet and fake to be called a beer. Drinkable? That would imply this was a drink. Maybe you can put it on an ice cream sundae. Rather bad."
"Does a fine job of keeping Rapapoda at bay, though. <g>"
"I had high hopes for this. I was imaging a creamy full bodied porter with undertones of caramel coming into presence at the end. But there was none of that."
"Thin-medium body with faint carbonation. Rich butterscotch and caramel sweetness dominate the flavor with a very faint roasted flavor. The concept of ""Porter"" must have been thrown out the window because nothing about this matches. Not a terrible beer, but not at all to style. I'm glad I only have one because it would take some time before I could drink another."
"Pours a deep brown/ruby red color with a little tan head that subsides rather quickly. Very nice aroma that smells almost exactly like my girlfriend's favorite drink at Starbucks (caramel macchiato) - sweet caramel, a touch of roasted malt, and some mocha. Taste is more of the same. Overly sweet caramel dominates the palate, with roasted malt and a touch of mellow hops. Sticky sweetness lingers in the mouth. While pleasant for a few sips, it's difficult to finish the bottle."
"Overall this is a decent entry by the never-complacent folks at Saranac, like I said not out-of-this-world great but not bad either."
"Another very mediocre brew from the fine folks at Saranac. Pours dark brown and clear, minimal head/lacing. Nutty caramel nose. Taste is, you guessed it, caramel and sweet. Tastes sort of like a mix between sugary caramel corn and a bottle of miller. There is obviously much better beer out there to be consumed. Saranac seems to be trying to fill the space betwwen BMC and any type of decent craft brew, I'm sure there is pleanty of $$$ to be made in that zone."
"Nope it's a porter. Very sweet. Serve it to the wife."
"smells like candy, looks like a watery brown ale with red streaks. really light in body. Malty falvor with a caramel sweetness. more hops then expected from the smell. like most of the saranac beers i feel this is a little watery. However the light body does make this a very drinkable dark beer, though it really isnt even taht dark. i am surprised they describe this as a ""robust porter."" i think saranac could be a great brewery if they concentrated the flavor profiles of their beers. from the smell i thought this one was going to be differnt but it falls victim to the same watered down flavor profile i have come to expect from sarnac."
"Brew poured a medium-brown into a logo'ed pint glass. Nice head, about 1/2"" thick. The carmel smell hits you as soon as you start to pour. It's VERY carmel sented - almost Starbucks Carmel apple cider level of carmel. Taste was very sweet, though the onslaught of carmel is somewhat diminished in the actual imbibing. Some hop backbone comes through as well. It's a fairly balanced beer. (Not sure how it came to be called a porter though...). Good mouthfeel, and fairly quaifable. A very different sort of beer."
"almost too sweet to be called a Porter, more like a sweet brown ale."
"Similarly, this is pretty sweet for regular drinking. It sure went down in a hurry, but there's no roasted flavors, no black malts, no bittersweet chocolate -- nothing to really stop the oozing butterscotch and caramel candy flavors. Personally, I think it makes for an interesting brew, and the first one goes down well. Beyond that, this is a bit too one-dimensional to be consistently quaffable. Like I said -- a few bonus points for being an interesting take. Try this with a Snickers bar, some sort of turtle/caramel-chocolate dessert... But probably not appropriate for your next BBQ or burger."
"The First Beer of Christmas"
"A very one dimensional porter in terms of flavor. Too syrupy sweet of a Porter to have another and really just an average attempt. Not Saranac's worst beer, but not their best either."
"Got a 12 pack mizer of Saranac the other day. This is quite a unique beer. It appears fairly dark brown, but as dark as your average porter. Smell and taste are both, well, very very caramely. VERY caramely. It's a nice flavor, don't get me wrong, but I'm not so sure it belongs in beer. The sweetness almost overpowers the malts, and forget about tasting any hops in this beer. A little to ""flavored"" for my tastes, but a nice try."
"The mouthfeel was quite thin. Overall I was disappointed."
"Bender Factor: I can drink about a half and then pass it off to my girl (that way I can get the Roggen and the ESB). I know for a fact that the ladies love Caramel Porter. Suprise your significant other with a sixer (if you live in the greater Utica/Syr area) for your anniversary. I will honsetly say that I could see myself putting down a sixer in1 hour. Dangerous. I rated this brew for what it is and factored in all the comments from the ladies that have tried this."
"Poured a much darker, nut brown like appearance with little lacing or carbonation. Smelled way to bitter--would have preferred something totally different. Just did not expect this bitter taste either, maybe I just hoped this would taste and smell as sweet as caramel ice cream topping."
"This poured a deep and clear ruby brown with a thin filmy head topping the beer off. The aroma yields sweet apple buttery notes, rich sweet caramel with a sweet nutty butter quality. The taste is bitter, roasty and flavorful. Initially the taste buds pick up sweet cherries, then ends up with a roasted bitter tang and slight touch of warming alcohol. This beer is loaded with rich flavors, but unfortunately there isnt much of a malt backbone underneath. A decent and interesting beer, and matched nearly perfectly with the canoli I was having for dessert."
"Got a 6 pack of this on special. I thought I'd really like it. Not so much. It poured a reddish caramel color. Smelled like roasted hops. The taste reminded me of most saranacs, but not as good. Kind of bitter finish, slight caramel flavor. Had 1 with a grilled steak, didn't pair up well. Overall it was drinkable, but I'm sorry I got a 6 pack. Prefer other saranacs over this."
"A very nice brew, the first of my 12 pack sampler from them. Looking forward to trying the rest of them. Haven't had a caramel beer before, so this is interesting. I think of this as a thinner-bodied Fuller's Porter with a ton of caramelized sugar. An interesting dessert beer, but 2 would be enough for the night."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" tan head above a deeply reddish brown brew. Aroma is STRONGLY of caramel and vanilla. So much so as to be sickly sweet and artificial. Taste lacks malt, almost tastes like a cream soda. Mouthfeel is quite watery, and drinkability is due to flavor and sweetness issues. Very disappointed, was expecting so much more."
"Almost sickly sweet at first, though it does grow on you. As the nose indicates, flavors are purely caramel to the point of being overdone. I like caramel, but this is a dessert beer gone bad."
"This pours a brown with a reddish hue and a decent size brown head. Pretty good head retention with a bit of lacing as it goes. Aroma is completely dominated by the sweet aroma of caramel. I cant detect anything else even as it warmed. Tastes like malts and caramel. It is very sweet almost too much so until a slight bitter on the after taste. The mouthfeel is average and it is quite drinkable it you like all that sweetness. Overall not a bad brew something that would be good as a dessert almost but dont drink too many because I bet these can give you cavities."
"Clear deep garnet hue. Rather light in color for a porter. Thick, persistant, dense tan head leaves lace. Candyish, sugary caramel dominates the aroma. Only hints of black patent roast and chocolate malt character exist. Not impressive aromawise. Prevalent in flavor is an expected, steadfast caramel syrup backbone, although malt makes its presence known. Mild notes of bittersweet black malt and baker's chocolate offer token depth. Meager in hop bitterness, leaving ample residual sweetness, but thankfully it's not sugary or cloying in nature, partially due to the high apparent attenuation. Lightly bodied, and a notch above watery in mouthfeel. Devoid of esters, and thus quite ""clean"" in overall flavor profile. Sweetness approaches cola like as it warms, but mercifully halts at a dilute caramel chew like level. Finishes quickly, with a fleeting snap of burnt malt and butterscotch. An odd brew. There aren't any real strengths in character here. A rather insipid porter. Caramel brown ale would be a more appropriate moniker. Yawn."
"A lightly reddish/brown colour with a small head of offwhite/tan foam. The aromas are all sweet sugar, caramel, light malts, and where are the hops? The taste is too sweet up front and even sweeter on the finish. The mouthfeel is sticky and the drinkability is not good. Not one of Saranacs better brews."
"Ok, so it's very sweet, but I like this beer. Great dessert fare."
"Not a bad porter. It's a good conversion porter. It is very sweet and only gets sweeter as the temprature rises. It has a very strong caramel taste that masks every other taste and subtlty of the beer, It could have been less strong on the caramel side and moreso on hoppy side of things."
"Drinkability - interesting. I'll be buying this again as much to drink as to get other people's reaction to what is certainly a unique taste in my beer travels to date."
"Pours out dark brown with a slight ruby tint to it. As soon as I started pouring this baby, I could smell the caramel. It was overpowering. The amount of caramel hops make this a sweet smelling, but also a sweet tasting, beer. The taste is a little too sweet for my liking. If this beer was a bit more subtle and smoother, it would be a high-quality brew. Instead, it was a little nausiating. Could also benefit from a little less carbonation. The sweetness really brings the drinkability down. Couldn't imagine having more than 2 of these."
"I know this is not a premium beer, but there is something about it that I really like. It is ruby-black in color with a buttery sweet aroma. Its robust body tastes of sweet caramel and roasted malts. It is then rounded off with an English hop finish (Fuggles and EKG). It is a nice dessert beer that is not too thick. All too often many stouts that go well with dessert fill you up too much when you are already full, but this is a little lighter in the stomach for those times when you can't consume too much more, but need soemthing to finish off the meal."
"This is a decent brew but I wish some other flavors came through. Oh and if you dont like caramel candies dont even open this bottle."
"I like the uniqueness of this beer but not the overpowering sweetness. Not really a porter in my mind, but it could be an excellent and special dessert beer. I'm torn on the scoring: as a Porter, this is very different and not very accurate. As a sweet beer, I could see this with a fine cheese course or a tart dessert and would highly recommend it as a special treat. So I rated the taste as a Porter and the ""drinkability"" as a dessert beer."
"A nice looking dark brown beer with a tinge of red. The head was a light tan and was fairly substantial at first. The smell and taste were very sweet and the caramel was very strong. It had a pretty good taste, but this is supposed to be a porter right? The hops were very light, the sweetness was more from the caramel than from malt, the color was a little light. If I strictly reviewed this as a porter it would score much lower. It was enjoyable and is worth trying, but it won't become anyone's favorite. It could be a good beer to introduce macrobeer drinking friends to a new style of beer."
"dark brown with a tan head. caramel and buttere dominate the smell. buttery caramel is the most apparent here, with slight hop bitterness, before finishing with a thick caramel aftertaste. medium bodied with good carbonation. this is a bit too sweet for my taste, but i can't really say that it's bad. i won't be rushing out for it any time soon, but if your in the mood for something different, it's worth a try."
"Deep brown, with a creamy tan head that doesn't go away. Smells sickly sweet of caramel, they should've held back a little. This tastes like someone put melted caramel candies in a decent porter. Just not satisfying in any way, makes me sick to my stomache with it's intense sweetness that covers up most of the coffee undertones from the porter. This beer would've been a lot better if it was simply a Porter, not a Caramel Porter. But I am just repeating myself. Easily the worst beer of the sampler, I may not even finish it."
"Drinkability: I can't find much porter character in this. It is more of a vanilla-cream/butterscotchy soda/malternative. Disappointing."
"Beer poured to a deep brown color with a nice tan head that was gone fairly quickly with little to no lacing. The smell is very much about the caramel with a touch sweet toffee and malt. Very interesting smelling brew! The taste is all caramel with some hints of chocolate and roasted malt that offer a very smooth and creamy concoction! Wow this is a sweet brew, actually have to be very keen as to what your matching it with when eating. Not sure how many of these I could have, just due to the sweetness of the beer, but once in a while it is a treat as it is quite different. Definitely a colder season brew for me!"
"I found this to be a very enjoyable brew. I am not a big fan of sweet things, and I really don't like sweet beers, but this offering had enough roasted malt and hops in the profile to keep it from being too much. It was nowhere near to becoming cloying. And, while I am not usually a big fan of sweet things, caramel and toffee are my favorite sweet flavors. So that didn't hurt either."
"Definitely a session beer, but could be improved upon."
"This porter would probably be amazing if they would leave out the caramel in the brewing process. It takes over the whole beer. The head is decent and stays around, leaving a nice lacing. The beer is brown with reddish highlights. The smell, taste and mouthfeel are caramel. It is too much. Drinkability is low. The caramel is just too sweet for the beer. It might go well with a desert or as a dessert. Maybe it would make a great ice cream float."
"Char"
"This is a very drinkable beer. It's the first of my Saranac 12 beer sampler. I'm looking foward to the next one."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick tan head. The aroma is of sweet malts and butterscotch. It is quite creamy. The taste is rich with caramel and chocolate malts. There is a good caramel flavor to it. The mouthfeel is fair at best. For such a malty beer the carbonation is too high. This is a medium bodied beer and a good drinker; and excellent sessions ale."
"Burndt caramel linger without the initial sweetness."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with a small head. The aroma is really strong with caramel and something really sweet. The flavor really surprised me because it had a really strong taste of sweet caramel. Possibly some butterscotch too. Very cool taste. I really enjoyed this beer."
"Very sweet, I felt more like I was drinking highly sugared popcorn than drinking a beer. I couldn't get past the initial impression and didn't enjoy this at all."
"Drinkability: I like caramel, but not in a beverage... well, a beer anyways. The caramel taste and mouthfeel is just way too dang strong and almost stomach turning. This came damn close to being tossed in the sink."
"I picked this up as part of a Saranac 12 beer sampler pack, and I'm certainly glad I tried it. One of the most unique beers I've had  but unfortunately, not in a good way."
"My first Saranac, from a 2003 ""12 beer sampler"" box. Pours a dark brown with some hints of red, not as opaque as most porters I've had. Head disappears quickly without significant lacing. Nose is of caramel(no surprise) and a hint of smokiness. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, but seems somewhat watered down. Taste is sweet malted caramel, not much else. This one is worth sampling for the caramel that dominates from the nose to the finish. Very interesting, certainly, and its faults make it more drinkable for my tastes. Only a slight hops aftertaste which makes for a smooth experience if you can deal with all the caramel. Not at all a bad choice, but definitely different."
"Appearance: Pours deep ruby brown with a nice full tan head sorta chunky textured as well, lacing appears in full patches excellent appearance. Aroma: Robust tones of caramel blended with sweet but slightly harsh dark roasted malts, not too much chocolate but this is one of the best from the Matt Brewing Co. I've had tasted so far. Flavor: Doesn't kill me with over caramel tone but it complements the darker roasts and provides an excellent sweetness that gives it vanilla like tones. Mouthfeel: Not a thick bodied porter medium if that very smooth and silky, great. Drinkability: Couldn't fathom downing these brews in number but for the sheer flavor profile just excellent I would definitely sample again in the future."
"dark brown color with a tan head that sttled to a thin skim on the top of the glass. whoa, i've had this before but never came upon a bottle as strong as this years (from the 2003 12 pack). buttery, butterscotch and caramel aromas abound. that pretty much sums up all I can smell, can't get past the butterscotch. all this caramel and butterscotch and what a big let down by rather thin mouthfeel/body, but the butterscotch comes back in the aftertaste."
"Poured a nice tan head that left a decent amount of thin lace. It smells like caramel popcorn. Very dark brown in color, just a little light makes it's way in through the bottom of the glass. Liquid caramel corn flavor fades is cut half way through by a bit of hop bitterness, but it's still there. If you like caramel corn you'll love this beer. It tastes really fake, and it's incredibly sweet."
"This seems like a novelty beer to me. I happen to like caramel, hence the decent score I gave it, but it isn't hard to imagine strongly disliking this beer. This probably would go well with a desert, maybe even ice cream. All in all, this is probably one of the sweetest beers I've ever had."
"Marks all over the board on this one. It pours a brown / burgandy color with a reasonable off-white head. Some lacing developed on the glass during the drink. The aroma blows your doors off - strong sweet caramel with some light roasted coffee tones. The flavor is as loud as the aroma, but less enjoyable as it sports a very sweet mouthfeel with tons of caramel flavor. This is definitely one of the more flavorful Saranac beers I have sampled. Drinkability is way down below average as every time a took swallow, my sense of smell and taste were overpowered by caramel. The first quarter glass was interesting, the remainder seemed to get old quickly. This would be great in a 4 oz bottle."
"Next time, less ""caramel"" and more ""porter", please."
"Not terrible, or even bad, just kind of dumbed down, with little complexity. The caramel sweetness got overbearing about halfway through. Some more robust, bittersweet maltiness would have helped, or perhaps something in the way of hops, to even the brew out somewhat."
"(And were do they get the cojones to call it ""robust""? )"
"Malty aroma of slight roast, a little sweet, like brown sugar. Eventually the caramel presents itself and dominates. Head is small, then leaves quickly. Dark brown with reddish hues and clear. Caramel is pretty strong in flavor, espeically middle to end. Maybe a little too strong with not quite enough blending for my taste. Mild hop bitterness. Average mouthfeel, but appropriate for style. ' Appreciate the attempt for something different, but this is just not a great combination for my tastes."
"Label states: ""Robust Porter"" & ""Dark Caramel malt"" & ""Fuggles and East Kent Goldings hops"" & ""HInts of real caramel used in brewing"""
"Drinkabilitywise, this beer seems more gimmicky than good. It took me the whole bottle (drank from a glass of course) to decide if I liked it or not. At the end of 12 ounces, I decided ""not really"". What starts off as a semi-interesting curiosity becomes a bit tedious. One bottle is enough for me for this lifetime."
"Pours a clear, very deep mahogany body with crimson highlights. The creamy, light-tan head holds well; and it even leaves some spotty lace. But it's not the appearance that gets your attention so much as the sweet caramel and cake-icing nose! It really smells like a dollop of rich vanilla/butter/sugar icing! It's clearly from an extract; and it's a bit odd, perhaps, but not off-putting. The body is medium; and it's smooth and creamy in the mouth due to a very fine and moderate carbonation - anything else would work against the sweet maltiness that's present in the flavor. The caramel that's promised is certainly delivered, although I wonder where the porter side of things went? There are some toasty notes, and a mild chocolate character; but its more of a sweet, winter dessert beer than anything else. Hop bitterness is present but minimal, and it finishes with a lingering maltiness. Quite unusual and interesting, but very one-sided. Still, I can certainly imagine lingering over one following a large Thanksgiving dinner."
"Got this in the holiday variety 12-pack,thought it would be alot better than it was.Poured a dark/amber color with with a medium tan colored head.True to the name caramel was the dominant smell I got almost overpowering,the taste like the smell was very caramelly with a little chocolate/earthy tone but I would have liked more balance there.A good try but not one of the best porters I have had."
"I definitely liked this beer and I am not one who is big into exceptionaly sweet beers. It poured very dark, but had some red showing through at various points. The head was rather light and about 2 fingers thick that receded into a kind of slick on top of the beer with some lace around the edges. There was a very obvious caramel smell with hints of a sweet malted taste. It tasted much like it smelled with caramel being the overbearing taste, but it also had some sweet notes of chocolate and mocha. My only complaint(and this is true of most saranacs) is the odd carbonated mouthfeel I seem to experience. Perhaps it is personal taste, but regardless, this is an interesting brew to try."
"Still mainly a nutty, dark porter in its old English roots, but thinner in taste and density than expected yet easy to drink a bunch in a row. Not the greatest in all categories, but I had a great night drinking a bunch of these while I played pond hockey in the middle of the night. The thinness was (for once) an asset in its refreshing-ness, as well as the sugar sweet made me feel all nice in between periods. But not one I'd drink when I want to relax and enjoy ""a good pint."""
"Truth told, it's got more balls than your average Saranac."
"Brown body with red highlights, topped by a three-finger foamy beige head. Good lacing. Aroma: they did not lie. Hugh amounts of caramel, with a bit of toffee, and way in the back, a smidgen of coffee. However, all that caramel became strangely muted when first tasted. Some roasted malts at the beginning, joined by a light comforting blanket of hops, and at the end, a hefty dose of caramel, which carries thru the aftertaste. Creamy smooth mouthfeel. Drinkability? I might not want to throw back a sixer all at once, but I would drink this again. Fine for dessert or late night."
"The smell is sweet, caramel and more sweetness. Pours very dark brown with a nice 1/4 inch head. The taste is overwelmingly sweet. The beginning is malt and roasted malt but the middle and ending are completely caramel. Maybe better as a desert beer? One that I don't think I will go back for. They call this a robut porter but I don't taste that."
"Pours a decent brown color with a white head, Caramel smells and flavors. A lighter bodied porter, but a decent one none the less. Nice taste with hint of caramel. Purchased in a 12 Beer sampler, a decent collection. I'd recommend it as a cheap way to sample entry level versions of 12 styles of beers."
"One of the better offerings in the christmas pack."
"Ruby color, with a light brown head that lasts. The aroma is of caramel, with a roast aroma as well. The caramel is evident in the flavor, along with a sweetness, and slight roasty flavor. The level of bitterness is pretty high as well. It goes into a dry bitter finish. It is a medium bodied brew, which is overall a tasty treat."
"Not much nose except for a smidge of sweetness. Deep purple color with a light brown 1/2 inch sticky laced head. Sweet chewy caramel taste. The brew is quite sweet with a bitterness to the finish that helps to round the sweetness. It does not completely do the job though.. and the beer is still left on the sweet side. This is a caramel chew for you! Drink it after a meal as a treat."
"Appears a dark brown with red highlights. Pours a thick tan head, which fades away slowly, leaving a sticky lace that clings to the glass. Smell of strong caramel is overpowering with very faint malt and hops undertones. Taste is incredibly sweet. Caramel dominates all other flavors. No other notable flavors where noted besides an extremely mild hint of hops. This was an o.k. novelty beer, but I don't look forward to trying it again."
"Not relay that bad but the overpowering aroma and the lackluster flavor should meet some where in the middle!"
"Pours a dark copper color with a tan creamy head that stays around for a little while. The coffee malt is not over bearing with little hints of caramel. I would like to have a stronger taste of caramel, but maybe next year. Over all not to bad, and it finishes nice."
"in the end, it is an interesting brew. the initial aroma is excellent, and it is a different beer to drink. it is not great, but as far as the experience of a unique beer, i liked it."
"A little thin for a porter, but the flavor more than makes up for it. Caramel is definitely the dominant flavor, but the English hops come through also, which is a nice surprise. Could definitely be a dessert beer, but it also could be had at any moment really. I think it would be a great breakfast beer."
"There are roasted and slightly burnt grains here, and the mouthfeel is full, rich, and creamy. It's got an over-the-top sweetness, however, and doesn't have the complexity of a great porter."
"A mahogany red beer with amber highlights that pours with a one-inch tan head. The head slowly fades to just a thin ring of foam. The aroma is pretty much all caramel, maybe a hint of hops underneath the overly strong caramel aroma that was apparent while pouring the beer. The taste has some chocolate notes, strong caramel notes, and a bit of peppery spice. Not much bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is a little on the light side, with the carbonation very noticable on the palate. This does not remind me of a typical porter stylistically, and I would not purchase this beer again."
"Ruby red in color. A brown rimming is all this beer offers for a head. Huge butterscotch, caramel and toffee on the nose. Overwhelming. This beer smells cloying, if that is at all possible. This beer swishes around the mouth like that gross, viscous medicine that you really don't want to swallow. This beer is just disgusting. One of the worst beers I've had in a while. Medicine like taste. Cloying caramel flavor. Astringent bitterness. No carbonation whatsoever. No porter like qualities in sight. This is the type of beer I could see ending up in the toilet in less than an hour if I drink it all."
"Freaky. That's what I kept thinking all the way through drinking this beer. I kept waiting for it to grow on me. It never did. I didn't really get much caramel flavor, either from the caramel malt or the real caramel used in the brewing, as noted on the bottle. What I did get was an odd, candy-ish background flavor that I just could not quite put my finger on. Cherry? Dr. Pepper? Not sure, but it did not work."
"Clear dark brown, head is reserved and a skim after a minute. Jeez, I can smell caramel two feet away. Completely caramel flavor, overdone and heavy from beginning to end. Sweet, sweet, sweet. The English hops don't stand a chance in the bittering department. I take Porter style seriously and love some crazy experimentation -- but to me, this beer has a CARTOON of a flavor profile. Unbalanced and cloying, choking and gross, its like a swan dive into a cheap liquid candy bar, saccharine and unchanging."
"Pours with a beige head over darkish red liquid. Intense caramel candy aromas in the nose. Taste is a wonderful mix of caramely burnt sugar, some light molasses and sweet malts. Finishes sweet and mellow. An offbeat but very enjoyable and drinkable brew...I wish this was a regular offering!"
"*quench your sweet tooth*"
"Wow, the reviews for this are all over the place. Consider me in the ""liked it"" category. Liked it quite a bit, actually. FX Matt knows their malts and this brew is no exception. Dark amber/light brown translucent brew with light tan head that fluffed, then wisped away. First taste is malts, caramel. Some butter in the aroma, and in the near finish. Piney hops are very subtle and caramel sweetness brings this one home. To me, is reminiscent of a baltic porter without the licorice and currant hints. If you like sweet stouts or caramel malts this one is right up your alley. I can understand how others thought this was too sweet and candylike, but for me the lack of bitterness was no problem."
"Deep ruby brown color with a small head.  Sweet winey & caramel toffee nose.  Very buttery with high diacetyl level.  Flavor is sweet, caramel and toffee with a deep base creaminess.  Saranac's house yeast is present and the beer lacks a certain bitterness that would help balance out the sweetness"
"This in one of the most unique beers around.  If you are looking for a lighter bodied porter to have as a desert, this one is you target.  The caramel aroma and flavor is quite profound and enjoyable in limited quantities."
"This pours a deep amber color (a bit light for the style) with a nice off white fluffy head that holds pretty well.  The smell is a delicious mix of roasted malt and caramel.  The first and last taste to hit the tongue is caramel.  It is almost like drinking some caramel candies.  There is a nice roasted/burnt characteristic in the background of the flavor.  The body is a bit thin for a porter.  The moutfeel is creamy and smooth.  The beer loses a few points in the drinkability because of its sweetness.  This is not an everyday beer.  Not something you would want to have to refresh you at all but it would fit in nicely as a dessert beer which is how I am currently enjoying it."
"This tastes like someone took a bad beer and melted a few caramels in it.  How can they justify calling this porter?  Very disappointing."
"Wow! Over the top caramel and toffee sweetness, but give Saranac credit for trying something different. Brewers should take chances with styles and go for broke and see what happens. I enjoyed this beer for what it was. Subtle hop finish balances a bit and I really didn't feel like the caramel was a cloying sweetness. Kudos to Saranac, try another!!"
"The first thing i noticed was the smell. It smelled exactly like caramel. The taste though, was just like the butter used on movie theatre popcorn. Needless to say i didn't like this beer at all. I don't think i have ever tried a beer that just didn't taste like beer."
"Three cheers to Saranac to have the balls to brew stuff like this, but it's not exactly someting you want more than one of (maybe that's why they only put them in their mixed twelve packs).  I neither love it nor hate it.  It just is what it is, and it's not bad at that.  Got it?"
"Overwhelming sweet caramel and other off flavors. Didn't care for this one."
"Didn't like this at all.  I really like porters but this one just turned me off completely.  Imagine a porter with no discernable bitterness and a melted rolo mixed in.  The caramel flavor was too much, overpowering the brew and making it taste like a novelty beer cocktail."
"very tasty.  the caramel is nice accent"
