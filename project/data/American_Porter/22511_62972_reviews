"This is a beautifully crafted porter. Not thick enough that I'd consider it a stout, but hugely flavorful and complex."

"Deep black pour into a snifter, with a small, sturdy cap of brown head that sank to a wispy layer and dotted the glass with lace. In the nose, roasty malts and coffee, vanilla beans, some caramel and milk chocolate sweetness. Taste was nicely balanced. On the sweeter end: milk chocolate, vanilla, marshmallow; on the roastier end: dark malts, cocoa, coffee, toasted grains. I didn't really get any cinnamon, either because I wasn't searching for it, or because it had faded (not sure of the date on this keg). Smooth mouthfeel, medium-full body, moderate to low carbonation. Easily drinkable and extremely tasty."
"O: Overall an excellent beer; the nose and taste are very enticing and complex (though maybe a touch off). The subtle treatments and additions to this beer at the various stages of brewing (coffee, cinnamon, vanilla beans) all work very well together making a beer greater than the sum of its parts."

"Overall: Damn good beer. Great balance overall. Very sessionable and rewarding beer. Quite complex for what can sometimes be a style that can be overpowered by a particular ingredient. Not my favorite offering from Hill Farmstead but honestly I don't have a single complaint about this. Very nice job."
"Tested from a 500ml bottle. Color is a rich dark black with a creamy brownish white head. Smell is of smoked coffee with heavy hints of toffee and lighter notes of dark chocolate malt. Mouthfeel is slightly syrupy with a nice hop finish. Tastes of vanilla, dark roast coffee, and a rich European milk/dark chocolate finish. Heavy cream and smoke are noticed at the back of the Tongue. Overall one of my favorites of this style. Really good thing I don't live closer to Hill Farmstead as I would be broke."
""
"Pour is black and opaque, tons of tight caramel brown head. Nose is roasted coffee, assertive vanilla and rich chocolate, light char, fair spice to it. Taste is similar in comparison to the nose. Same aspects, coffee is light with the roast slightly stronger. Very rich chocolate and vanilla, light peppery tang to it. Balanced sweetness subtly behind showing a deep malt presence. Body is lighter, carb is assertive with a juicy texture and semi dry finish."

"M: Creamier and more substantial mouthfeel than you would find in a lot of porters. Not stout-like, but definitely on the hearty side for a porter."
""
""
"Basically, this beer's flavour profile is very similar but the mouthfeel is definitely thinner bodied in comparison to what I recall on draft (and from the original review above). My guess is that it isn't as well carbonated as it was on draft. I'm going to conclude here that I certainly prefer this beer on draft, so if you've had it out of the bottle and thought it was good but not great, I encourage you to try it out on draft on your next visit to Vermont."
""
"D: Deliciously roasty with flavors full of decadent chocolates and a wonderful creamy mouth feel. I get the sense I would love just the base beer minus any special adjuncts here. They don’t seem to heighten an already great Porter for me. Has a supreme balance of flavors and easy drinkability. Would love to start trying some more of their offerings. Really great stuff!"

"Overall: A very nice holiday porter. Very well balanced with a really nice, smooth flavor. Very drinkable."

"O. Couldn't ask for anything more. It's a fantastic brew. There's no point to saying what style it fits in. It's awesome drink it enjoy it. Be happy you are getting to enjoy it."

"O-very nice porter, good flavor and balance, not as smooth as Everett"
""
""
"O-I liked the beer, and it's fun for a seasonal release, but it isn't my new favorite porter like I had hoped"
"Absolutely lights out, I think of it as a KBS light, which says something as its not barrel aged. Also it was even more sessionable. Once I got to the end of the Growler, I savored every last drop. Currently (11/26/13) my all time favorite brew."

"Growler that was one day old from the brewery. Pours jet black limited head with a mild coffee and cocoa smell but not too aggressive. Initial sip a bit thin with mostly unsweetened coffee notes and a slight metallic taste which as it warmed seemed to be from the vanilla. Was expecting more given the coffee and vanilla"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a solid porter as a base beer which is given another level of flavor and complexity with the vanilla and coffee added. The vanilla adds a nice sweetness that you notice up front while the coffee adds some punch on the backend."

"O: A pretty nice beer that I'd probably have again. The cinnamon balance here works, however, I think this combination works better in a stout."
"O: Perfect porter for a cold winter's day (though it is July presently). Very smooth, creamy and goes down nice. I prefer the beginning if this beer better, lots of nice coffee and chocolate and vanilla. The toastiness and spice in the aftertaste is a nice balancing point but prevents this one from being perfect. I'm being nitpicky of course, but I feel like I should given the brewer. Very flavorful and very complex. Nicely done."
""
""
"Overall: Very delicious. World class. However, Vanilla Bean Framinghammer porter has ruined me for life and this beer pales in comparison to it."
""

"Picked this up from a great trade with Evan! Nice black pour with two fingers of thick, foamy beige head with great retention and lacing. Complex nose with hints of roasty coffee, cinnamon, vanilla, caramel, and a bit of mocha. The taste follows suit with lots of dark roasty coffee up front along with hints of cinnamon, vanilla, sweet cream, milk chocolate, and some subtle black pepper. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, extremely creamy, and smooth as silk. Overall, this is a really nice Porter with a unique holiday twist. It's a bit too sweet for my taste, but still enjoyable."
""
""
"O: Another tasty porter from HF. A can see how this would be nice to drink in the winter, but nothing wrong with drinking it on a cloudy May afternoon in Seattle either."
""
""
""
"Its sinful of how well this beer satisfies the taste- and does so with no real gimmicks, over-selling attributes, and keeping within style. Its raises the bar of what is the best Porter on the market!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I don't remember it being this big of a cinnamon flavor last year. Also, there seems to be less vanilla. Very good, although not the beer I have loved in past years. Still amazing, although I wanted something that simply wasn't there, mainly less roast and astringency, and more vanilla and chocolate."
"M - Medium body. Creamy. Light to moderate carbonation."
""
""
"Pour is black and opaque, tons of tight caramel brown head. Nose is roasted coffee, assertive vanilla and rich chocolate, light char, fair spice to it. Taste is similar in comparison to the nose. Same aspects, coffee is light with the roast slightly stronger. Very rich chocolate and vanilla, light peppery tang to it. Balanced sweetness subtly behind showing a deep malt presence. Body is lighter, carb is assertive with a juicy texture and semi dry finish."
""
""
"I'm not sure what's not to like about this. Judge on its merits as a porter, this is an amazing beer. I enjoyed this far more than Birth of Tragedy."
""
"quite disappointing when you open a top 250 for the first time and it just isn't what you expect, I'm almost certain I got a bad bottle so please send me all you HF so I can do some quality control"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- great easy drinking winter seasonal. A lot of taste and great body."
""
""
""
"Overall this was a very good beer but not exceptional. I wonder if the age or storage prior to me acquiring it was a contributing factor but I will never know. Solid but not up to the elevated expectations I have come to expect from HF."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was quite good, a very stellar porter with a wintery twist - loved the amount of cinnamon used here, just the right amount - though one glass would be enough for me I think. More well-rounded and solid than the bourbon-barrel aged treatment (birth of Tragedy)."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Very nice winter porter that I should have drunk back in winter and not spring, but whatever. Quite nice. Hill Farmstead does it again."
""
"It's a really solid porter that had a couple slight flaws in appearance and the finish."
"OVERALL: Surprising that this is the base beer to Birth of Tragedy actually, as the abv difference is quite large. Nevertheless, this is an excellent beer and quite drinkable for it's size. Perhaps a little more bitterness at the finish would make this perfect, but it is a really tasty and enjoyable treat as it is. Another great porter/stout from Hill Farmstead. Cheers again for the bottles guys!"
"Drink- I really thought I would have to trade a ton for this one. Thanks for sharing vince. I appreciate it."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall this is a nice coffee stout. Very unique. I couldn't drink a lot of it, however."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel is very good. It's certainly full with a good carbonation level. It's very smooth, almost silky then leads to a nice dry finish that's pretty clean. Very drinkable, one to slowly enjoy and/or even share, but anybody who likes porters could very easily polish this one off. A well done seasonal brew. Huge props to BBG for sharing this one."
"Beer is medium in body and fairly sweet, the finish isn't bitter or spicy at all, it is super drinkable and makes me happy. I really enjoy this beer and hope to have it again in the future, perhaps on draft or fresher when the spices are still dominant."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Lots of vanilla. Needs more roast. Good without being Hill Farmstead's best beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid, quite enjoyable porter, and another good beer from HF. However, I did not find it to be quite as good as Everett."
""
""
""
"Bottle shared at the Santa Cruz tasting in January. Chocolate and fresh coffee aromas, some vanilla and honey as well. Big coffee notes in the flavor, firm roastiness balanced by sweet dark malts. Smooth vanilla bean finish. A really nice rich mouthfeel."
"8.1/10"
""
""
"A good porter, but not really stand-out. Dark and roasty with a big dry roast finish. The vanilla beans are subtle, cocoa and cocoa dust seem to permeate. Heavy on the dark chocolate, chocolate malt, and a secondary blast of coffee. I liked, but not really an upper class porter to me."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's black with a nice solid sheet of tan foam. Smells nice, coffee, cocoa, rich toasted graham crackers, bits of burnt toffee and a good dose of vanilla - but not overbearing. Flavor is rich with the tone of the nose and a little hint of pepper and almost a waxy crayon note. The bitterness is well matched with rich dark gooey chocolates and a little bit of dust. Full and smooth body with low carb and an off dry, but mucous producing finish. Nearly perfect mouthfeel for my money. nice beer as usual."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-An amazing porter. HF can do no wrong."
"O: I disagree with the classification of this beer as a porter. It is more of a stout. Either way it is a great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O~ nice full flavor porter, definitely not my favorite porter but in my opinion its actually a nice mix of a stout and a porter. to me its still all about the pales/IPA's and saisons/wilds with HF!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The palate is a step up from the nose. Creamy and gently carbonated, this beer opens with a blend of vanilla, caramel, coffee and chocolate. Not as roasty as my favorite porters, though there is a pleasant grainy bitterness towards the finish. Vanilla characteristics dominate, with the unsweetened chocolate and coffee coming in second and third. The combination is quite enjoyable, though. The finish is creamy, almost with a touch of lactose, with chocolate and vanilla dominating. The medium body on this beer is just wonderful, a sentiment that is heightened by the fantastic level of carbonation. A very good beer, though pricey for what it is IMO."
"Different strokes for different folks. A rather ordinary beer made less appealing through the addition of cinnamon."

"O: If you like coffee and vanilla beans, you'll find this to be a beer that's packed with flavors and is also very well balanced."
"O: This is a really enjoyable brew that I was happy to get my hands on, and I would be happy to have a few more of these - it is a really nice brew. Very nice complexity to both the smell and the taste with nice coffee and vanilla notes (one of my favorite combinations)."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great beer. My first exposure to HF, and I'm definitely a fan."
"Overall. A very nice flavourful porter with plenty of coffee and a unique bit of spice. Very enjoyable on this Friday afternoon! Thanks again, Franklinn ...the only one who has correctly guessed the source of my internet name that I've been using for around 15 years now. Very impressive!!!"

"Sorry for the non-technical review. I had this beer about a week ago, and honestly, I have not stopped thinking about it since, kind of like a first date with a girl you know is going to turn out to be the one. The coffee bean/vanilla bean combo was amazing, took the bite out of the coffee and gave it a velvety smoothness I've never had in a beer. A friend from Vermont gifted me about 6 different offering from Hill Farmstead and this is the first one I tried. The aroma matched the flavor. Poured nice and dark, what you would expect from a winter porter. I can't want to try this again."
""
""
"Overall, a very nice beer. Leans a little too much to the sweet side for my tastes, but still well crafted and enjoyable."
"Pours black with a slightly bigger than average coffee head and average lacing. The smell is quite faint with nothing but grains and chocolate malts coming through. The flavor on the other hand is rich and complex with chocolate vanilla coffee and lingering spice and cinnamon notes finish it off. The mouthfeel is not overpowering and just about right and this is a very drinkable brew. The first ""dark"" beer I have had from Hill Farmstead and another great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Thoroughly ordinary and the perhaps the only sub par (or at par) HF beer I have had. For one, it is over carbonated so that takes quite a bit away from this beer. It is a porter alright and suffers from the excessive acidity that porters tend to have sometimes. Among the ""spices"" part, I get some vanilla and that is about it. Thin body and harsh feel, I found it tough to go through my sample."
""
"Overall: Thanks to franklinn I am having my first experiences with HF and must say that this brewery knows how to craft some damn fine beers! Again one spectacularly balanced big dessert like beer. Outstanding!"
""
""
""
"I much prefer Everett over Twilight but that's not to say this isn't one of the better porters out there. Exhibits great balance in flavor and as always, a perfectly crafted feel. Worth a try but if you're into sweet porters, the vanilla is very subtle in this beer and you'll likely prefer Everett over this."
"Overall (4.5/5): Twilight of the Idols is a great American Porter that features a wide array of flavors perfect for a winter beer. One of the best things about it is that all the ingredients–the vanilla beans, coffee, and cinnamon–seem to mix well together; it's not one of those beers that seems to use additives as a crutch. It also doesn't have that fake spiciness thing going on that some winter beers have (you know who you are). This is a subtle, complex, and very tasty dark ale that really brings the roast. Shaun Hill has done it again–another excellent Hill Farmstead Brewery beer."
""
"O: A killer beer. A killer AP. HF can craft a great brew from any end of the spectrum. Of this I am convinced."
""
""
""
"D- very drinkable and smooth."
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, coffee beans, and vanilla. Taste is much the same with a rich cocoa, coffee, and vanilla flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with some great aromas and flavors."
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm really enjoying this. The beer has a nice blend of flavors that go well with the base Porter. It really opens up when allowed to breathe."

"Really love the label, it is bad ass and ominous looking. As far as the beer inside the package..Porters don't come better looking then this one. Big billowing mocha colored head, it fades, but it leaves lacing. The beer itself is black, black. The nose gives you roast, earthy oh is this earthy, and cinnamon. As for the vanilla, not picking that up so much, but none the less the aroma is inviting and complex. Roasty, now I get the vanilla it comes on subtley but is perfect in its restraint. Cinnamon, I really never expected to be enjoying cinnamon as an ingrediant in a beer but it is so complementary to the flavors in this porter. The finish is lingering with the cinnamon, coffee and latte like charecter really hanging around, a little to long actually. Thick and rich somewhat milk shake like, its a good thing. I'd drink this every day of the winter, it is a perfect winter beverage."
"O - Nice layers of chocolate, coffee then some vanilla."
""
""
""
"Very dark brown, but still a little translucent with a slightly reddish note around the edge. Forms a small tan colored head that sticks to the edges on the glass. No lacing. Aroma is strong and full of coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts. Flavor is lightly sweet, with notes of chocolate, molasses, coffee, roasted malts, and vanilla. Medium bodied with a very mild bitterness. Overall, a good beer, but considering how good of a beer Everett is, this one was not exactly up to what I was expecting."
"Verdict: Delicious porter from Hill Farmstead, a really nice treat to have as desert. Rich and complex flavors complimented by a nice roast character, what else could you ask for in a porter?"
"Poured from bottle. Aroma is a bit bitter with hints of coffee. Vanilla smell could be confused as a smokey character. Nice dark brown with a quickly disappearing tan head. Nice malty porter with a perfect balance of coffee. Sweet subtle vanilla finish. Doesn’t taste nearly as bitter as the aroma. Very nice porter."
""
"Mouthfeel is creamy and somewhat thick with carbonation being moderate. Great mouthfeel for the style. Overall, it was a very good beer. The aroma was a little off but the taste completely made up for it. Very good beer overall, I especially loved the vanilla component."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I was not that into this. Needed far more vanilla to balance the coffee."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall a fantastic porter. I've had 2 darker beers from HF now between this and Damon and both have been great. This one just has a ton of coffee, vanilla, and chocolate to it, with no heat whatsoever and is easy to drink. Would love to have this one again sometime."
"M: That is a big medium or basically full bodied brew. Wow."
""
"O- Overall, this is an extremely nice spiced coffee porter. I hate smokey beers, but this has just the right touch of smokiness to compliment the roasted malt character. It reminds me of Victory at Sea, but has a much different spin on it. It's highlights are really the malt and spices, with the vanilla and coffee somewhat taking a back seat."
"O: This was another excellent porter from HF. While enjoy Everett more, this was still a big winner in my book. Nicely hidden ABV and greatly nuanced flavors. Definitely recommend."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really awesome beer! As usual HF delivers another beer worth your time. Recomended!"
""
""
"Pours a solid dark brown/black color with a creamy mocha head that persists forever leaving lots of lace on the way down the glass. Smells of chocolate and a hint of roast and coffee with a solid shot of vanilla, a touch of ash and earthy hops. The flavor is rich chocolate, caramel and coffee up front with again a bit of vanilla contrast. Sweet flavor with little to no hop flavor or bitterness. Medium to thick body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a creamy velvety smooth mouthfeel. I tried this on tap this weekend and thought the vanilla was a bit too forward, but trying this bottle its seems just right to me. This is a really nice porter, I thoroughly enjoyed it."
""
"o - overall, very nice porter. a bit decadent and rich for the style, but enjoyable none-the-less. something in that Hill Farmstead water, i tell ya."
""
""
"Nose is dark bitter chocolate, earthy hop character in the middle with a little bit of of vanilla at the back. The coffee is present on the nose but much tamer than I would expect for a coffee porter. The taste features a stronger presence of vanilla, chocolate, a touch of cinnamon on the back. Very nice. Overall, tons of flavor and decent balance, coffee is more backseat than I expected."
""
""
"Very good and I can see where the hype lies. Thanks egrace84!"
""
""
"O- This was another fantastic porter from Hill Farmstead. Twilight was very flavorful and extremely well balanced. In my opinion the subtle spices and vanilla were perfect in this beer and it was very easy to drink. Overall I like the chocolate and coffee that come out a little bit more in Everett (the vanilla takes a little bit of that away), but this is also a fantastic porter that I'm glad they are making a regular seasonal offering. I definitely recommend trying it out."
""
"Overall, probably my favorite non-barrel aged porter ever. Incredibly drinkable and complex. All the additions to this beer (coffee, vanilla, cinnamon) work well together and complement each other. Nothing is too heavy handed and it makes for an incredible porter. Having this released during the winter season was also a great choice as it drinks great in the cold weather."
""
""
""
"O - This is a fantastic Porter. It falls short of Birth of Tragedy, but that's to be expected. I can't think of another better Porter that I've had. Overall balance, great but not overwhelming flavors. This is everything I wish all Porters could be."
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is smooth and easy drinking with lots of pleasant roasty stout quality contrasted by sticky sweet vanilla bean addition. I had no problems finishing my glass and reaching for more. My only complaint is the mineral aspect thy seemed a bit out of place."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Another incredible beer from Shaun Hill. Not sure if I prefer this over Everett or not. For now I'll say ""yes."""
""
""
""
"O - An exceedingly complex and intense porter. I assume Everett is the base beer due to matching abv's. I do prefer Everett in that its much simpler and basic while perfecting all the qualities that make a world class porter. The addition of ingredients seems to make a great thing a bit less great. Still a world class porter that is exceedingly enjoyable on a cold ass night."
""
"Not my favorite of styles, but I enjoyed this."
""
"The beer is dark brown with a quarter inch of beige head. The aroma is roasty, with a touch of spice. Vanilla presence hits immediately upon the first sip. While vanilla presence is muted in the aroma, it is rather assertive in the flavor. Smooth, silky feel with lingering vanilla, chocolate. Delicious. Another fabulous beer from Hill Farmstead."
"Beer pours black with a thin off-white head. Smell is really excellent - roasted malts, coffee and some spice all come together quite nicely. Flavor follows the nose, it has that same awesome porter flavor as Everett, but adds some coffee and spice to the mix, really impressive. Sadly I'm not getting much vanilla, but I can deal. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is yet another fantastic beer from Hill Farmstead."
"Edit: had this same batch tonight, and the smell is significantly better, maybe with some age the coffee mellows out and everything seems to coalesce very nicely with a bit of age, a nice roasty solid example of a porter aroma. It was noted that the alcohol level is perfect for a chocolate coffee vanilla porter, it's also very nice in subtlety. The feel also seems silkier than last time. Nice! Thanks to Andrew MacWilliams for the bottle!"
""
""
""
"Full-bodied and creamy mouthfeel. Really, this might just be the perfect winter beer."
"Pretty sure I prefer Everett to Twilight of the Idols as it stands. I like this combination of flavors moreso in theory than in this particular beer. Perhaps the next batch will be better?"
""
""
""
"EDIT: In retrospect, uploading this review maybe 2 years later, I realized that this must have been the base beer for Birth of Tragedy. Nice. No wonder that beer turned out to be so exceptional."
"O: a really good porter, don't really know what else to say... A touch of sweetness to it for the style and a hint of dark fruit, but overall deffinatly try this if you get the chance."
""
""
""
""
"O/D-Awesome. Such a treat to try. One of the more imbibable dark brews I have had. Creamed coffee in beer form. Very happy. This brewery cannot do wrong!"
""
"O: As previously stated this is an excellent porter. Definitely one of the best I have had to date."
""
"O - Liked this one alot. Great example of a porter that could pass for a hearty stout."
"O: Very nice porter. I'm sure I didn't get all of the complexity that is in there, but I really enjoyed this brew. One of my favorite porters ever."
""
"Twilight of the Idols pours a solid black, with about a finger of mocha foam left crowning the beer. Head retention is just average, and there's a little bit of lacing left stuck around the glass. The nose is nice, dominated by milk chocolate with a strong spicy cinnamon presence. The flavor profile takes things to the next level though, starting with a creamy chocolate open. Cinnamon comes in for a short time in the mid palate, before coffee and more chocolate close things off. The finish is like the liquid equivalent of snacking on chocolate covered coffee beans. The mouthfeel is also top notch, very full and creamy for a 7.5% beer, with a subtle and understated carbonation. I'd be shocked if there weren't a healthy dose of oats in the grain bill, because the body is just that silky smooth. Twilight of the Idols was the first non hoppy beer I've had from Hill Farmtead, and it left me just as impressed with them as I was by their outstanding IPAs."

"Appearance is black with a light brown head. Upon smelling this, you know right away that you are in for a treat. It has vanilla and coffee on the nose, some malts. Then, with a taste and there is more of the coffee and vanilla, along with some cinnamon and some other winter spices. Roasted malts continue in the taste too. This is very well balanced and drinks easy, a smooth texture and finish. It would be great to drink a glass of this alongside chocolate chip cookies. A fantastic porter and well suited to a cold night in New England."
"This is a fine porter that I would seek out again. Rich, bold flavors, a nice hop profile and the added touch of cinnamon for a little flair."

"I’ve been anxious to try this one for a while now and man, I was impressed! I just loved the combo of flavors involved here, chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon, with roast and hops adding a bit of an edge to things. But this was so well balanced and smooth overall. Wow, I love their takes on American Porters from here. Just tremendous stuff!"

"After trying Twilight Of The Idols and Birth of Tragedy (which is the barrel-aged version of Twilight) on back-to-back nights, I can confirm that these beers are entirely different beasts. While I loved the bourbon notes and the overall intensity of Tragedy, Twilight definitely had more coffee and vanilla nuances (and more carbonation). Like nearly all of Hill Farmstead's offerings, this beer is fantastic."

"The flavor is unbeleivable here. Hill Farmstead remains one of my all time favorites."

"Had a glass at the Farmhouse in Burlington VT. Damn, that's a porter. The coffee and vanilla are wonderfully blended into the beer. So many coffee porters and stouts go too heavy on the java, and even get a stale taste. This beer takes a great cup of joe, adds a dash of subtle vanilla, and still brings a great porter. The malt brough a dark, chocolate character with a sharp roasted edge that's balanced by the sweet vanilla. The beer is formidable, but never too heavy. Find this porter."

"O- A smooth and easy to drink porter. The flavors complement each-other as nothing was too dominant. The spices weren't as evident as I thought they would be, but still another solid offering from Hill Farmstead."

"Poured into a sampler from a 750mL swingtop. Pours jet black with a thin head. Nose is roasty and sweet. Taste is mildly smokey with a nice tinge of bitter ess. Mouthfeel is pretty decent. Well carbonated, slightly astringent. Im not a huge porter fan, but this is one of the beat examples of the style I've had."
""
"an easy-drinking beer that has plenty of flavor, is well balanced, and is slightly complex. A very good beer, but it doesn't wow me as much as a few other Hill Farmstead beers."
"D: Pretty drinkable for the weight of the body, but everything is very balanced and pretty tasty."
"A good porter with very noticeable cinnamon bark, vanilla and spiced feel."

"Deep dark black, much blacker than Twilight! If I swirl the beer in the light I can pick out some faint chestnut around the edges. Minimal mocha head, with a little brook trout patterned lacing. Vanilla comes through big in the nose, followed by coffee grounds and then kahlua. Some coffee roast, but everything is overshadowed by vanilla bean. So silky smooth. Vanilla, bourbon, and coffee. Rich and chewy. Milk chocolate, root beer, amaretto. A little bit of booze and bitterness, but overall a creamy delicious beer. Not sure I could polish off a growler alone. A little heavy and rich. Ecstasy-inducing in small doses."
""
"Unreal. The subtle flavors and the sheer level of rounded integration of each component was just remarkable. These beers speak so softly and yet they say so much. I swear it, my bags are nearly packed, I'm just about ready to drop everything and lurk in the woods around Hill Farmstead with hopes for more tastes of these beers. World class for sure."
""
"Very solid beer. As far as a porter goes, one of the better ones. A great tick."
""
"Man this is just a fantastic beer, totally worth the expectations. Too bad I have to wait for folks to drive north to get a second growler of this one."
""
""

"Mouthfeel on this one is a homerun. Silky smooth and the alcohol is non-existent. Overall, a great take on a porter, rich without being over the top (yes, I'm looking at you, Southern Tier)."
""

""

"Somewhat smooth while still having a drying finish. Light effervescence with a fairly full body. 7.5% ABV is really well concealed. Not sure if that is a good thing. Overall, a pretty good beer considering my aversion to coffee."
"Smooth mouthfeel, very easy to drink a couple glasses of this."
""
"O - Drinks like a chocolate/vanilla milkshake. An excellent dessert beer and perfect for the winter months to warm you up. Another winner from HF!"
"O-I had seen good things about Hill Farmstead and thought I would not have a chance to sample their wares. Thanks to the great taps of Queens. Vermont is not too far away, maybe a road trip is in order."
"One of the best beers I've ever had, just wish there was more of it!"
"Cheers"
""
"This is a very tasty, easy drinking beer. The flavor really improves as the beer warms."
""
""
"Once again Shaun has captured the essence of a place in your mind in an outstanding beer."
"Overall this is a good example of the style and a perfect fit for the holiday season. An easy drinking porter and a candidate for a Christmas after dinner menu."
""
"Overall: Another standout beer from Hill Farmstead. I think I like Everett better, but this is a very nice porter itself. Don't let the vanilla/spiced/winter angle scare you away - I'm not a huge ""winter warmer"" or sweet/vanilla fan but these additions are minimal and only add nice complexity in this beer."
"O - Really nice beer from a great brewery. Wish I was local and could hit them up on a regular basis. I have to remember to never piss kelp off."
"Pours a rich chocolate black with a quickly dissipating mocha head. Dots of lacing and wet legs line the glass. Aroma starts with mild smoke, bread and burnt malt, and turns mildly sweet with molasses, milk chocolate, vanilla bean and light cream. Flavor has a bready and coffee base, more roasted malt and a baker's chocolate finish that isn't particularly sweet. Vanilla and molasses subtly blend in and out of the body without ever being cloying. Biggest knock on this is the slightly thin body and watery finish. Nowhere as robust as Everett and too thin for the style and ABV for my taste. Regardless, an excellent, unique porter but I'll just stick to Everett."
"This beer pours a really dark brown color. There is a small finger of light tan head on top of it. The head sticks around for a bit, and it leaves behind a few specs of lace behind as it recedes. The nose is roasty and there are aromas of coffee, chocolate, and a bit of dark fruit. There is also a bit of vanilla and molasses that comes out. The taste starts off with a strong roasted malt presence. There are some good flavors of milk chocolate and coffee that stand out. Also, there are flavors of vanilla, dark fruit, molasses, and a bit of cinnamon. The finish leaves some lingering roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate behind on the palate. This has a medium body and good carbonation. It goes down easy and has a rich velvety feel to it. There a good amount of roasted malt bitterness here, as well a nice dose of sweetness. It coats the mouth nicely and really lets you taste all of it. The roasted bitterness and sweetness sticks to the palate and lingers for a bit. This has good drinkability. It is a really tasty beer, and I could easily have a few glasses of it in an evening. Overall, I think this is a good beer and a good example of the style. This is a solid beer, and I recommend trying it out. I would buy it again."

"This beer pours a nearly pitch black color with minimal head. The smell is chocolately, roasty, with hints of vanilla and spice. The flavor is more roasty when cold, but as the beer warms you get wonderful notes of vanilla and chocolate with a good residual sweetness. The mouthfeel is full with low carbonation. I did sit on the full growled for a few days without opening. I wonder if it would have been more carbed if I had drank it fresh. Overall this beer is awesome, it really is one o the best porters I have had."
"O: Like Clockwork, Shaun has managed to create another magnificent beer. Very rich and chocolaty with lots of depth and great coffee and vanilla highlights. As good as it gets for the style."
""
"D - Delicious stuff that I would gladly drink again on any occasion. I'd like to get another growler, as I don't think my mental facilities were quite up for the complexity and depth of flavor when we drank this beer. I'm extremely hopeful for Birth of Tragedy."
""
"O - Overall this beer is exceptional. This alone is practicly worth the drive up to Greensboro. A definate growler fill of this is needed again. Argh, I want to drink this every day!"
""
"Overall: This is just a fantastic porter. Nothing I didn't like about it."
"O-First beer I've had from Hill Farmstead and it's impressive. Totally worth driving to the middle of nowhere to pick up a growler."

"O - awesome, my favorite non barrel aged porter. wish I had gotten a second growler."

"O- This stuff is fantastic. Awesome taste and feel which compliment each other nicely. I wish this stuff was bottled."

"Overall really nice, great dark malt flavors without too much bitterness or any burnt flavors, nice and creamy and tasty, drinkable, a big time winner!"
"D: One to remember. Instantly one of my favorites. I could easily drink this all night and would be very tempted to have a few the following morning. Hats off to Hill Farmstead for this winner. Can't wait to get my next Twilight fix."
"Cheers"
"Cheers!"
"It's bolder on the palate, with flavors of anise and baker's chocolate, burnt bread, French roast coffee. I've read that this was brewed with cinnamon and vanilla, but I couldn't pick out those flavors above all the dark malt. The mouthfeel is dry, medium-light in body, perhaps a touch thin for the 7.5% ABV. An enjoyable beer, easy to drink, but not particularly special."
"Exceedingly well balanced, this is a wonderful beer."
"Really good porter, impressive and easy to drink."
"On tap, served into a tulip. Pitch black with a one finger tan head that settles to a cap, very creamy with amazing lacing. Smell is bourbon and raw vanilla beans, spiced cinnamon, coffee beans, dark roasty malts, spicy hops. Taste is very sweet malts and some roasted malt bitterness, vanilla, slightly hoppy, a hint of coffee and some cinnamon (a later batch I had was heavy on the cinnamon, i prefer this version). Medium/heavy body with a light carbonation. This beer drinks and feels more like a spiced stout then a porter, but an excellent Christmas beer either way. One of the most drinkable spiced beers I have ever had. Sadly, TSA smashed the growler I was attempting to bring back so I wont get to have any more of this for a while."
"Drinkability: The abv and mouthfeel hold it back a touch but I definitely wanted more than one pour and had more than one....heck I had more than two :)"
"Big regret is leaving the brewery without a growler of this. I'll just have to make do with my 8 bottles of various other tasties."
"Excellent brew for winter consumption. Almost too rich for dinner, a porter for pleasure."
"Taste is again strongly coffee. It's a bit dry and bitter with a lot of coffee characteristics as well. The cinnamon comes in on the finish very faintly and subtly that's super well done. A great holiday beer that's flavorful and drinkable."
"This ale is marvelous. I would expect no less from Hill Farmstead. Shaun knows how to take a style and make an excellent interpretation of that style."
"On tap at La Laiterie. Excellent winter beer. So smooth you could drink them all night. The vanilla/cinnamon combo is just right. Reminds me a bit of Anchor Steam's holiday offerings. My only complaint is that ot feels a little thin and I would love to tase this combo in a heavier stout. Either way, Shaun does it again. Superb!"
"The taste is nice with a bittersweet chocolate character layered underneath a good presence of vanilla. Again, some really nice and mellow bourbon notes and a hint of oak. Medium body with a slight hint of booze. Overall, a fantastic brew from Shaun and the vanilla really shines through."
"Wow, this stuff is extremely drinkable. Great flavor and really smooth. Just delicious. The vanilla and cinnamon add some nice layers to this beer that bring it a step up from a regular porter. I really need to get a growler of this."
