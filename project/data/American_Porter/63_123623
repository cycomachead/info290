No biggie, as this makes things more interesting, letting everything lay it all on the table, nowhere to hide, as such. I can't say that this is really all that easy to drink, but it's easier than it should be, if that makes any sense, and is probably leagues better than what poured freely upon repeal of the 18th Amendment.","biboergosum","Dec 05, 2014"

It tastes like bittersweet and milk chocolate, molasses, pomegranate, cranberry, burnt/charred malt, vanilla, and a bit of licorice and coffee.  There's a good mix of bitter, sweet, and tart flavors.  Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and coating with a moderate amount of carbonation.

Pours pitch black with a tan head and, being unfiltered, I did notice some floaties lurking in the glass. Undeterred I sipped and man is this one heck of a beer. Cranberry is very present to the taste and contributes an excellent tartness, also big time chocolate, espresso, roast, and oak. Alcohol was untraceable but it came out a bit as it warmed, and this beer was quite sweet. It was full bodied but actually felt a little light in the mouth I thought, something which lent it a high level of drinkability, and it was creamy. Overall I really liked this beer quite a bit, I can't wait to see how it mellows with age. This is a release I look forward to every year.","BrewChatKen","Oct 27, 2014"

Nice even bourbon/oak  aroma with some chocolate and molasses. The taste does not quite live up to the nose hype. Not exactly sure what pomegranite is since I dont partake, but I am assuming it is the dark, sour fruit I am tasting, cranberry like. Not a big fan. Also, the bourbon seems to disappear into the background. Otherwise I dont get much roasted malt, smokiness,or robust flavor. Just sweetness. A vanilla and burnt sugar, but over the top. Somehow it tastes too sweet and too sour at the same time. Has the body of regulat Black Butte. A good beer, but based on my expectations (highly regarded brewery) and the aroma, I was a little disappointed.","WesMantooth","Sep 29, 2014"

I'm having a hard time remembering my feelings for XXV when fresh, but this one is certainly close to it's equal. I love the fact that the pomegranate molasses provides a fruity sweetness that seems ideally suited to blend with the roasty flavors of the porter, while the cranberries provide just a bit of brightness as a complement. It was surprisingly easy to down an entire bottle of this myself during the course of a movie. I'll certainly be excited to see how this one drinks once it hits its prime in a year (if I can hold off on opening more between now and then).","LambicPentameter","Aug 25, 2014"

It tastes like a cranberry %60 Cocoa bar, which isn't a bad thing at all. But for my personal taste I would want it more leaning towards %80 Cocoa and coffee flavors.","samtrillo","Aug 24, 2014"

The cranberry lacks the acidic punch it has on its own and supports the cocoa and roasted notes well. Vanilla presents itself with a strong creamy character. The barrel character is tame but present in the form of a little bit of oaky char. Taste is much like the smell. Dark chocolate, then cranberry, then vanilla, and a hint of barrel on the finish. The body seems light considering this is a barrel aged porter, but it doesn't get in the way of the overall quality. This is a very successful anniversary reserve from Deschutes, my favorite one in recent memory. The good news is this is pretty easily attainable.","homebrew311","Aug 12, 2014"

Delicious aroma of sweet dark toasted malt, chocolate, light fruit, vanilla, a hint of bourbon. Flavor is dark toasted malt, light fruit with cranberry tartness, vanilla, hints of dark dried fruit, bourbon, chocolate. Medium bodied with a pleasant creaminess, nice mouth feel. I have to say that I was on a roller coaster ride with this one. The aroma is fantastic and the initial taste of malt, fruit and vanilla is very nice, then the cranberry comes in to add a bit a tartness and part of me wants to wallow in dark malt for a while without the tartness, but when the finish rolls around, there is a great aftertaste of sweet vanilla toasted malt and pure, fresh cranberry that is quite satisfying. In general I'm not a fan of tartness in porters and stouts unless it is carefully restrained. XXVI skates to the edge of that flavor preference and pulls it out in the finish. Complex, interesting and as always, one of the great beers produced in our hemisphere. I'm going to take the chance that this will not become too tart in the future and will cellar a few to try again.","LiquidAmber","Jul 17, 2014"
