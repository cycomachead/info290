"Overall: For the price point it is a decent beer nothing spectacular compared to other coffee porters or stouts, but still not bad really. I enjoyed it fair enough its a shade above average in my opinion."

"I love getting a big, quick pour going, especially with the darker beers since the pseudo-cascade is much more visible. This settled into two fingers of thick, rocky, deep-tan head with good retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown (SRM = 44), allowing zero light penetration. Nose had the deep roastiness of coffee, especially my morning brew, which is not for the faint of heart, along with a dark chocolate bitter-sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was definitely of coffee and some dark chocolate. Man, if you like coffee, you will like this, but it was pretty intense. Finish was bitter and dry and I began to contemplate when I would drink something like this. It might go well with dessert, especially in lieu of coffee. It just seemed like more of a novelty than an everyday beer to me."

"O: Pretty good but I'd think of it more on the stout end of the spectrum with roastey flavors similar to guinness. I seem to recall having one with more chocolate coffee character to it but this particular bottle seems lacking."
"O - love it!!!! Great beer. I could drink it every day."

"An excellent porter from Kona. I wish I could find more of the breweries beers Coffee and porter is a good combination and love this beer so addicting as coffee can be. Kudos to Kona Brewing Company for this amazing coffee and porter beer that i love so much"

"O - If not the best coffee porter I have ever had, it is right up there. Outstanding. I would recommend this beer highly."
""
"I bought this beer as part of a variety 12 pack at Three Bears Alaska for about 14 bucks (cheap), so I'm on a bit of a Kona kick. I tried their coconut brown ale about a year ago, but had not seen it in most stores around here."
""
""
""
"O- This beer is a great beer, but I just cant see drinking this on the beach where it is made"
""
""

"O: Body was nice, coffee was there, but then again it always is with a porter. Still, this was good and I would recommend it to anyone who likes coffee, stouts or porters."

". 4----5"
"The first sip was very nice - a bit of coffee mixed with chocolate, and very smooth. Maybe as my palate become overwhelmed, the beer became more watery tasting and the nice flavors of the coffee and chocolate were no longer as pronounced. Still, overall a very enjoyable porter."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of coffee, a bit of chocolate. Taste is strong of coffee, roasted malts, a mild bitterness. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a very good beer, worth checking out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Rugged porter with a big roast character and some excellent dry coffee flavors. A bit of dusty cocoa, dry toffee, earthy malts, herbal hop, and a touch of spice. A little thin, which is to say that bitterness has too much contrast. Attenuated, but tasty. Easy to enjoy, but the body needs a little more heft to it. Effervescence has some sizzle. A nice porter."
""
"Good, solid beer, but not the greatest Porter. Pretty good marks in all categories but nothing that strikes me as great. Has a nice head and a clean, roasted taste. Good finish but fades quickly. Pretty well carbonated but light body. Could use something in my opinion to make it better; more hops or heavier body."
""
"Overall - flavors are pleasant, but generally subdued."
""

"Pours a black color. 2/3 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of coffee, sweet malt, roasted malt, and hint of hops. Fits the style of an American Porter. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of coffee, sweet malt, roasted malt, and a hint of hops. Overall, good appearance, coffee dominate, simple blend, but decent body."
""
""
"O - I liked this a lot. Really well executed on almost every level. Not something I would want to knock back a six'er of, but as a one off it's a real winner."

"O: One of the best coffee porters - a great style - must try."
"Overall: good beer. Rather dark but is not overbearing or too heavy-bodied. Nice flavor that works"
"O-A bit of a let down for what I was hoping for, but still a nice beer. Will definitely enjoy the entire 6 pack (though not tonight, gotta study). A very good beer for someone wanting to try a coffee beer, but not a coffee fan. Maybe my review is a bit skewed being that I had my first founders breakfast 2 days ago and that blew my mind. But Overall this is a nice, pleasant beer, that I think most beer lovers would thoroughly enjoy."
""
"A solid coffee porter; not to heavy, tasty and, at 5.4 ABV, certainly sessionable."
""
""
"Like the aroma the flavor is alive with coffee grinds that taste like they've been collecting in the bottom of a coffee pot with the burner still on. But then there is this moderate dark fruit bitterness at the end that lingers for some time, usurping the coffee character."
""
""
""
""
"Kona Brewing Pipeline Porter ---4/5."
""
""
"Overall: Pretty solid beer from Hawaii or wherever it is made now. Probably NH. Anyways, will be enjoying more."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied. It clings to the tongue in a pleasant manner, and leaves it a little sticky."

"I'm thinking about the taste that this beer has compared to the signified trance it gives to the audience that has masked another defeat through sarcasm and playa-hatin' ! Only a freshman would suspend an inferiority complex enough to clone it with another inferiority complex to hate this beer if it was a Doctor Doom>LLO,<<,"

"Taste-Roast coffee, dark chocolate, nice little hop bite. Very well-balanced with excellent flavor and character. Not overdone, just right. A great match for a big burger or a plate of beef fajitas. Gulpably good!"
""
""
""
"Pipeline Porter is a well put together beer. A nice roasty base set the foundation for a solid accompaniment of fruit, vanilla, and coffee. The pricetag make this beer even better. I'll certainly grab more of this in the future, good to see it around these parts."

"Poured a deep blackish brown with a one finger fluffy tan head that receded to a ring of tan foam. It looks excellent, very deep and rich. Scents of roast malt, faint roasted coffee and dark cocoa. A typical porter aroma, with a bit more coffee than usual for the style because of the addition of Kona coffee. The flavor follows the aroma. Roast malt, black coffee, toasted malt and some slight nutty flavors with a roasted, bitter finish and aftertaste. The coffee is a bit more noticeable as the beer warms, and adds to the typical porter flavors, though this is still very much on the lighter side of dark in the intensity of it's flavors. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with moderate-high carbonation and a smooth, slightly watery feel. It's nice and easy to drink, but maybe a tad too carbonated and watery for my mouth. Overall this is a pretty good porter, the coffee definitely adds to the porter base, but it has a few small flaws and there are better porters out there."

"O: Love that its from Hawaii, love the label. Got it in Asheville NC, drinking it in China Oct 30, 2013, it was produced August 27, 2012. Kona coffee is awesome, and this beer is a great idea. The coffee comes through more as it warms."
""

""
""
""

"Pours dark brown. Nice head. I wouldn't really associate porters with Hawaii but this beer wasn't bad. It has little to no smell. It starts out smooth with chocolate notes and finishes with a coffee aftertaste. It's a little too carbonated for my taste. I felt that the taste left a lot to be desired. Overall it's a decent beer. It's worth a try."

"O - Honestly I thought this was a really solid brew. Tasty, nicely balanced coffee flavour and well measured carbonation and viscosity on the tongue. Nothing earth shattering here but this could well be my go-to beer while I'm on the Islands. Would definitely take 6 of these over 4 Maui CoCoNuts."
""
""
""
"It's semi-dry as the roast and coffee draw that light char out onto the palate. The body is medium. Crispness is light and falls off a little as it goes, thinning out the end of each sip later in the session."
""
"Overall it's a good beer at a bargain price, but if you like heavy porters this won't satisfy you. It's a good coffee beer, but if you want extraordinary brew, try Epic Brewery's Bug Bad Baptist."
"O: I wouldn't turn it down but the bitter aspect makes it unfriendly. I'm yet to be wowed by this brewery."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 8/14/2013. Pours crystal clear nearly opaque reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, nuttiness, biscuit, light roast, light floral, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and coffee notes; with good strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, nuttiness, biscuit, light roast, light floral, and toasted earthiness. Light floral/coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light roast, and light nuttiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors with coffee; with nice robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice coffee porter! All around good balance and complexity of malt and coffee flavors; with good robustness and very smooth drinking. A very enjoyable offering."

"Coffee haters should probably steer clear of Pipeline Porter, but for anyone who appreciates coffee and beer both, this is a worthy marriage. Would drink more of these (and probably will)."
"Very dark, almost black beer. It has brown highlights when he'd to a light source. The aroma has mildly roasty scent, a little malt and some coffee qualities. No real hop smell. More roast and slightly burnt qualities in the taste. Dry. Nice bitterness. The body is of medium heft. Drinkable and enjoyable, but not outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
"The nice aroma of coffee with roasted malts hits you right up front. The taste was even better with some chocolate overtones also. Very smooth and no bitter aftertaste. Sad that I only bought a single bottle to try from World Market in Minneapolis, Minnesota last weekend. Wish I would of bought a few 6-packs for the $8.29 they were asking.."

""

""

"O - I was expecting more intense roasty flavor since Kona coffee is so strong. The flavors that are there are good, I just wanted a little more depth. Mouthfeel could also have been a little thicker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Good color and smell. Head disappears quickly. You really get a great burst of coffee flavor from the first mouthfull. You have to be in the mood for it, but I really enjoyed it. Would buy again, which is my best recommendation. Only drawback is I wouldn't drink more than 2 at one sitting."

"Overall a tasty porter."
"O - I think Koko Brown is my favorite of the staple Kona lineup, but this is a good #2. An easy to get sessionable porter that you can enjoy year round."
""
""
""
"Well, it sure is coffee. Not sure there's enough of a porter underneath. Still, nice easy sipper."
""
""
""
"Overall, I would not call this a smooth porter, but rather a beer-drinker's porter. This sometimes carriers a negative stigma, but don't let that mislead you. Pipeline Porter has rich and distinguished flavors and scents, but is incredibly easy to drink. Since the coffee flavor was a bit too strong for my liking, I will not likely seek this out again; however, I would be interested in trying this on tap. I'd also recommend to someone who enjoys coffee porters/stouts. Cheers."
""
"O – Nice, light coffee notes, the nose is misleading, but it is absolutely a coffee beer, very easy drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
"Light to medium bodied with average carbonation. Nothing really good or bad stands out. Kind of average. I wish the body had not been as thin, and that there was more chocolate flavor."
""
"I have been wanting to taste more from Kona Brewing for a while, ever since I tasted the excellent Fire Rock Pale Ale. I finally got around to it... This porter is an appropriate dark shade of brown, nearly opaque, with a bubbly head, similar to Cola. The head diminishes to barely cover the top of the beer after a few minutes. There's some remnants that cling to the side of the glass, but not much. The aroma is very pleasing and fresh - like a cafe mocha topped with whipped cream. The taste trumps the aroma... the 100% Kona coffee flavor is one of the most distinct in any beer I have ever tasted! It's quite toasty and towards the tail end of the flavor there's a tiny hint of hops. The beer is very light, borderline watery. The taste lingers for a few seconds in the finish but disappears in a dry fade. In short, it tastes similar to a lightly sweetened iced coffee. Despite some of the negative sounding things in the review, I really like this and will definitely be buying it regularly! I like to always have a beer around that is satisfying, yet somewhat low calorie. This fits that bill perfectly, with the added bonus of the gourmet coffee aspect."

"Would I buy this beer again? Probably."
"Hey, what do they say? ""Pipeline Porter is full-bodied with a rich, smooth dark-roasted malt flavor. A selection of premium hops and 100% Hawaiian Kona coffee complete this limited brew."""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Whatever happened to that proposed trans-Eurasian pipeline? Regardless, this stuff pours a deep black-brown topped by a finger of dusty brown foam. The nose comprises mild coffee, roasted malts, light cola, and a splash of cocoa powder. The taste brings in more of the same, with the coffee and cola taking full command of the situation. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, though it's a bit on the thin side, this is a highly enjoyable coffee-forward porter. Good times."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: A very good Porter. More coffee forward than typical for the style which is a nice twist. Up there with the better American takes on the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I may not be the best judge of beers, but I rather enjoyed the taste. It had a pleasant dark coffee aroma and flavor. As with many porters, It tasted better after warming to a glass. Not much of a head when poured.Nice color as well as great feeling on the palate. Practically no bitter after taste. Not as strong as others but still a great drinking beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- For this review, this beer is finishing the evening with a piece of 85% cocoa dark chocolate. It's a good combo."
""
""
"Overall this is a solid beer and I would recommend it."
"Full of dark roasted malt flavor, with chocolate and coffee predominate. It’s brewed with Kona coffee, so that’s not too surprising. The lack of bitterness is a bit surprising though. Kona isn’t one of my favorite brands, but there’s nothing to complain about here."
""
""
""
"A really rich and flavorful porter, loaded with tons of coffee and chocolate tastes. Everything seems to fall together nicely with the exception of a slightly over-carbonated feel, but that's such a minor thing in the grand scheme of things. It's the well-put together malts, coffee, and hops that make this a great little porter, and these are the flavors that will stick with you. Delicious!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty good brew. Does the job right after dinner. Not the best porter I have had but then again it wasn't designed to be. Drink up and enjoy, Salud!"
""
""

"OK stout, would prefer a thicker more full feel. Nice, roasted malt flavor."

"Lighter in body than I'd prefer but smooth. Light effervescence. A really good, American style porter. My on-tap review must be a case of a bad line or keg, I guess."
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavors are similar, dark roast coffee, a flash of roasty black malt, slight bitterness in the aftertaste, about the same as a mild cup of coffee. Light bodied, a drinkable porter. Something i'd pick up again for a session to spend more time with."

"A great beer when you want a nice sipping beer on a cold night"
""
""
""
"O: This is an enjoyable and easy drinking everyday porter - nice amount of complexity and balance to both the taste and the smell. Not a special beer but definitely an enjoyable one."
""
"Overall – While not the most robust porter out there it was a decent more session like porter. A little more sweet flavor and body may have been better for the brew,"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: Did I mention coffee?"
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Incredibly good porter, all there is to say"
""
""
"Compared to recent porters, this one isn't the top. I'm not picking up enough of the coffe notes and complexity. The taste was flatter than other porters. Still a good beer, but not upper echelon porter."
""
""
""
"O - This is not a complex beer, nor does it stand out in its style. There are many other coffee porters and stouts out there that are better, but none of them I can pick up at my corner convenience store like I can a six-pack of Pipeline at QT."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very easy to drink and balanced porter that has some nice flavors of coffee and chocolate."
"Overall, I think its a great example of an American Porter. Its well balanced and represents that smooth island feel. It doesn't have much of a bite or anything unique that makes it spectacular, but when it comes to a few Porters on the beach, these go down easy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Whenever I travel to Hawaii, I usually have one of these with breakfast instead of coffee. The caffeine level in it is enough to give you a nice boost and still have a cool drink. Lately, in Los Angeles; you can buy 6 packs at a cheaper price than you can get it for in Hawaii."
""
""
"O: On of the best porters I've encountered. Drinkable, thick, tasty, and flavorful. Recommended. A touch too sweet for me, but I would have again."
""
""
""
""
"M: Big medium to full due to body."
"O: Decent porter, don't think i'll be buying this one again anytime soon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This one is more of an everyday drinker than a beer to be analyzed carefully, and it's all the better for it. C'mon Kona, make this one year round already!"
""
""
""
"Overall its pretty solid. drinkable and enjoyable. If you have a friend who your trying ease them into the world of dark beers this has a home. Easy for a porter."
"clearly a very average porter, pretty good but you can see from the scores that it was unremarkable. the color was actually true to style, the aroma was less than expected, the smell was not that bad with roasty notes, the taste was unfortunately thin and unlasting. mouthfeel was not much better."
"Meh, Meh, Meh... unfortunately the deep brown body and light milky head are as far as I go in appreciating this beer. The smell leaves me searching, and trying again. Cola, possibly roasted malts and maybe some chocolate summarize my view of the main body of taste of this beer. I am NOT a fan, and found it dificult to finish my 4oz taster... in fact I think I didn't."
"Medium coffee and hop notes. Poor mouthfeel. Thin and uninteresting as far as coffee porter goes but would drink over bud light etc. In all honesty and in my opinion, probably not worth all the money it took to ship this all the way from Hawaii. Sorry guys at Kona. :("
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a run-of-the-mill porter. Nothing great but nothing bad. I expected more coffee and taste."
""
"ovrall nothing to write home about i was told it went down smoothed but i dont think it , it has coffee in it could of fooled me this beers offers nothing to me this beers lacks everything no taste no moment of oh yes i must drink it all night or again but no skip it enjoy thier vannilla one this brings nothing to the table leave it in the car"

"O: Very easy to drink, but otherwise it's a bit bland. I certainly wouldn't mind drinking it again, but with so many beers competing for a piece of my wallet during the winter season, it's unlikely that I'd buy it again."

"A decent porter, especially for time spents in these islands, as I'm getting a strong foreign stout vibe here. Tasty and dark, to distill it down to the vast majority of typical bar server knowledge. Not here, though, I am happy to report."
""
""
""
"Overall- Fairly one dimensional, somewhat bland beer. Not very interesting. This might be a good beer to introduce to a new craft drinker who likes coffee."
""
""
"Overall, an extremely average porter for me, maybe even a little disappointing. I think what did me in, is I am hoping for a silky, thick, dark motor oil of a beer with a coffee porter, but this just didn't deliver."
"Coffee rules this brew, and as far as coffee porters go this one ain't bad."
""
""
""
""
""
"A good solid porter; solid flavor and feel. Problem is there are ALOT of other stellar porters out there that are better than this one. Good brew, just not a ""wow"" brew."
""
""
""
"Body is medium-thin and carbonation is pretty lively. Maybe a little more prickly than I’d like, assertive and bubbly, without a lot of smoothness or creaminess. Crisp and dry finish. Not bad, but if I’m going for a Hawaiian porter make mine a Maui Coconut please."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a decent coffee porter but lacks the overall viscosity i was hoping to find."
""
"1.5 finger head with nice lacing on a jet black body. Aroma is mostly roasted malt with some coffee. Flavor is heavily dominated by dry roast coffee bean flavor without too much of a bitter note. Dry finish. Full body and moderate carbonation. Overall this is more stout like than porter. Coffee is heavy which affects drinkability but it's good for my tastes."
""
""
""
"Overall: Just tastes like some kitschy coffee flavored ale, go for it if you're into that kind of thing."
""

"Had this at the Lahaina Yacht club and found it a very nice coffee forward porter with a balanced mouthfeel and a good finish. Not as nuanced as the Coconut Porter from Maui Brewing but still a nice change from the lighter beers at most Maui bars or restaurants"
"O - If you are looking for a drinkable coffee style porter this is a great selection. If I see this in a local mart I could easily throw down a sixer without being disappointed. That said if a bold, big body porter is what you are looking for, go elsewhere."
""

"O: Drank this while comparing with Maui CoConut porter. I liked them each for different reasons, but this had little carbonation and much more coffee. Didn't like it as much as the Black Butte."

"This is my first taste from Kona Brewing and I am not disappointed. I think the coffee is a bit more pronounced, which sets this apart from other American Porters. A nice take that is an easy drinker and a worthwhile try."
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a very dark red brown, appearing black. Thin, fine light tan head dissipates quickly. Aroma of chocolate with faint coffee and roasted malts. Flavor follows, dark and roasted malt, chocolate and light coffee; coffee finish with some residual bitterness. Light bodied. Flavor is light, but well integrated and pleasant. I prefer more robust flavor in my porters, but this tastes good, if a bit attenuated."
""
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a 1 inch tan head that settles to a thin cap. Small dots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, roasted coffee beans, and slight cocoa. Taste is of dark roasted malt and some sweetened burnt coffee flavors. There is an acidic quality and roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good stout but the coffee flavors I am getting are a bit odd with the roast."
"Overall, I was disappointed by this brew. It was a struggle through a 6 pack, and that with using it as an extra in a trade with a guy who loves it."

"O: Overall enjoyable to drink, but would be even better if the flavor at the beginning lasted a bit longer.."
"by all counts a lovely porter. pours a nice dark ale color with very limited transparency and a 1 inch white head. smells like fine hawaiian coffee, sweet chocolate malts, and that north shore evening breeze. flavor is rich but drinkable, plenty of roasted grain here and a delicate sort of coffee finish. not bitter coffee, but like a luxurious cup with a spoonful of raw sugar. no acidity either. mouthfeel is damn near perfect, everything a porter should be. fuller bodied but not filling, still an ale here. highly sessionable with a modest abv, and just enough bubbles to bring out the flavor, no more. overall this is a fantastic porter, one of my favorites actually, and it is infinitely better than kona's longboard lager. almost wrote these guys off, but now i am keen for more. well done here! mahalo!"
"Overall- Pleased with this beer, but to me it is almost too forward with the coffee. The fact that this is a beer gets lost, but that would make it a good sessionable beer."

"Overall: Nice initial impression but it fades fast as it can't sustain it. I expect more out of a porter. Just ok, nothing more."
"Overall - I paid less than two bucks to try a bottle, I think its worth a try if you like yourself a Porter."

"Nothing spectacular, but very enjoyable."

"Pours an extremely dark brown color w/ a thin, fizzy cocoa head. A little low on the carbonation, and minimal lacing on my snifter glass. The nose is coffee, some malt, and a hint of chocolate. Fairly weak, but pleasant smelling brew. The taste is a lot thinner than I was expecting. It's coffee, some hops, and that's really about it. I'd like the malt to be a little more present here. Feel is thin, a little undercarbonated, with a dry finish. Overall, this beer is ok, but I probably won't seek it out again. A decent porter."
""
"A good beer easy drinking but lacks depth in both aroama and taste."
"Overall - One of my favorite seasonal porters, a definite standby. It's a shame Kona doesn't offer this beer year-round, because I would still drink this in spring and summer."
""
"I got some of this out of a sampler 12 pack from Kona Brewing. I didn't read what this beer was before I opened, and let's say, I was VERY surprised with the blast of coffee flavor, with carmel. I am a few sips into this beer at this point, and I am enjoying it. I need a few more sips, but I am enjoying it. If you love beer and coffee, this is a good brew!"
"GOOD, NOT MUST HAVE!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not sure how this one drinks fresh or even if I ever could get one brewed less than a month old but if this was distributed to PA (fingers crossed) I would pick up a six pack often. Solid balanced coffee porter."
"On tap at the Plano Gingerman. The beer pours a very dark brown to black color with a tan head. The aroma has is a strong mix of roasted malt and coffee, with not too much else coming through. The coffee also really stands out in the flavor, but there is also some roasted malt and a little bit of chocolate. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
""
""
"O: Not heavy, enjoyable weight. Not too fulfilling. Paired well with grilled ribeye."
"O - A solid porter. The flatness on the finish was the only negative for me. Despite that, I'd still drink more."

"M. this beer felt good on the palate. I love porters and this one is worth multiple buys. I am a big coffee drinker and the fact that I could taste the coffee, but I could also taste the other ingredients. some of the other coffee porters/stouts I have tried it was like drinking straight coffee. I very much enjoyed this one."

"Poured black with a bit of burgundy at the edges of the glass, light tan head with pretty dense lacing and mild retention. Nose has some light powdered cocoa, a bit of milk chocolate, lightly roasted coffee that's somewhat rich, creamy and 'soft' in nature. Flavour has some creamy and light coffee notes as the mainstay, minimal roastiness. Light caramel and a bit of lactic sourness. Coffee again in the finish, but not in large amounts. Lightly roasty and bitter finish. Body is disappointingly thin for my liking, medium to thin with a light medium carbonation. OK overall, but not enough overt coffee flavour to make this a standout 'coffee' porter in my eyes - left me a tad disappointed with my first opportunity to 'try' some Kona coffee!"
"O: Overall very easy to manage. One I might be tempted to claim as a session porter. Nice balance with a emphasis on drinkability that just begs you to drink more. Six pack worthy."
""

"O - My boss brought a bottle from Hawaii and I have been hooked since...it's nice to be able to pick this up in Maryland...the coffee addition to this porter is spot on"

"Very very good porter...surprisingly up there as a new favorite."
"I have been curious about this beer for awhile. I am glad I had a chance to try some since NY does not get the stuff. It pour a classic porter dark-brown with a nice 2 finger head. I could smell sweet sweet Kona coffee and a bit of cocoa. The coffee carried thru, not too sweet not too bitter. For the price, if I could get it all the time, this would be my coffee beer. Not a strong or syrupy as Founder's Breakfast stout, but darn good."
""
""
""
""
"O: While this porter has great flavor, I feel it has more in common with a dry stout than a really great porter. I'd buy it again, but only if the price was right."

"Kona Pipeline Porter: Some friends brought this brew over for a dinner party. Up front, I want to be clear that I am not a fan of flavored beers. The Pipeline Porter is brewed with coffee. My preference would be to have a Porter, then let me add coffee to my liking (or not). So you may like this Porter, but due to the strong coffee properties, it does not get high marks from me. The color is black, the head is thin, offwhite and fades quickly. Aroma is primarily coffee, with some roasted malt backing it up. Flavor is the same, lots of coffee and big roasted malt. There may be a great porter hidden under all of the coffee flavor, but I just cannot tell."
"Great job Kona!"
""
"O: I like it a bunch...must say I really enjoyed it....when you don't really want something as heavy as a stout...this is it..."
""
"overall a solid porter, and good for sessioning because of the lightness to it."
""
"Black in color with brownish hues on the edge of the glass. Poured with a short beige foam that reduced to light wisps and a few sticky lacings. Rich roasted malt and coffee aromas with a pleasant chocolate undertone. Thick and smooth feel with lively, tangy carbonation through the middle. Strong coffee flavor from beginning to end with roasted malt underneath. Floral hop bitterness begins in the middle and intensifies to the finish. Finishes semi-dry with a black coffe and herbal hop bitterness."
"O- Solid beer. Not my absolute favorite porter, but coffee fans should give this a try. I'd happily drink it again, might even buy a sixer, but probably won't seek this one out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Good porter. Nice chocolate and coffee flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
"This porter shows an opaque brown color with a decent sized tan head and good lacing. The aroma brings an obvious and tasteful coffee malt idea that invites the first mouthful. The flavor offers a woodsy malty coffee, with a medium body and silky feel. Carbonation is light but works well. Very good stuff that goes down very easy for the style. Recommended!"
"Overall I really like this beer, if Starbucks made a beer I'm pretty sure it would be like this one. But since I love coffee this worked quite well for me."

"O - Very drinkable and something that can be enjoyed by the few."

"O - Nice easy drinking porter, lacks depth of some of my higher rated porters, but this is an easy one to hand to a ""non"" craft drinker."
"Mouthfeel is kinda thin and watery. Decent acidity from the coffee. Really little carbonation, definitely hurts the beer."
"Overall. Good coffee porter here. Just a little too sweet for me, but very nice flavours and being an easy drinker won't make me hesitate in trying this again."
"This is good porter overall, especially with coffee. The coffee taste is very evident, but not overpowering which seems to be the case with many coffee beers. This is my second time having it, could see this as being a winter staple if it were regularly available to me."
"Overall, this is the best coffee porter I have ever had. This is exactly the level of coffee taste I expect when I see mocha and coffee porters and stouts. This is the first one to truly satisfy that expectation. I would highly recommend this beer if you like coffee or the awesome coffee/beer mix. If it's not really your thing, I would still recommend trying it at least once due to its outstanding coffee flavor."
"Overall: Not a bad beer. Nothing wrong here, but not much to write home about."
"I would however drink it every morning for breakfast."
"Now if kona can just improve on their regular lineup of other beers..."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer, ABV is good and it you like coffee you might really like this..."
"A very good coffee porter. I appreciate that it drinks light and has a lower ABV. Surprised I didn't review this earlier."
"Overall: Perfect beer for certain moods, an acceptable beer otherwise."
"O-A very nice beer, won't blow anyone's socks off but at 5 and a half % a great session beer for the price."
"O - best coffee porterI have had."
"O - One of my favorite winter seasonal brews."
"M – Medium body with nice depth through the finish."
"Average looking. Dark brown in color with little to no head. The little head that was apparent, was light beige in color. No real carbonation here. Smells of straight black coffee. Taste's like pure coffee. Burnt or roasted coffee beans come to mind. I've had tons of coffee beers, but this is one of the most coffee powering beers in my opinion. The down fall is that it's sort of one-dimensional. The body and mouthfeel is average for the style. Worth seeking."
"Overall Impression- Very sweet, malty, roasty, but doesn't give off much of the coffee flavor I noticed in the aroma. Glad I was able to try but needed more body. Will be looking for more from Kona."
"Not real complex but the coffee flavors are pretty tasty."
"It pours a dark black with about a finger's breadth of khaki head; leaves considerable lacing. The smell is what throws it off, with the roasted malts being overpowered by what appears to be pineapple; there are definitely strong fruit aromas present, and perhaps a touch of coconut. Weird. Tastes exteremely sweet for a porter, obscuring everything else. Lots of fruit coming through in front of the roasted malt, tinge of caramel, and grassy hops. Kind of tastes like an over-grilled pineapple for lack of a better comparison. The extreme sugar presence is a bit overwhelming in the mouth, but otherwise it has a decent mouthfeel. I would choose other, more traditional porters over this, though it certainly is a unique offering that should probably be tried once just in case it does appeal to your tastes."
"A little disappointed here."
"very dark, but obviously clear brown, almost black. Very large tan head graced the top, eventually faded down to just a slight ring around the outside of the glass. No glass lace and little carbonation,.Smell very sweet, lots of caramel and roasted coffee, a touch of chocolate perhaps. Very nice light feel. Good carbonation kept it feeling alive and allowed the flavors to really pop. Nice burnt caramel sugar and a touch of chocolate. Very nice dry piney hopped finish. Very drinkable, in fact I had alot more of this alot quicker then I intended to. Overall a really great beer and a fine sessionable porter."
"Overall, this isn't bad... But I'm glad I didn't trade for multiple bottles... I will drink the other one, but won't be looking for more."
"O - This has good drinkability. It goes down good and flavor is very nice. I could easily drink a few glasses of these in a sitting. Overall, I thought this was a really nice brown ale, and I would definitely buy more."
"This is a very welcome, very flavorful brew and is right up there with my top porters. The bottle is perfect for skeet shooting as well."
"Overall: great porter."
"I love porters and I love the smell of coffee. This beer had it all for me. The first time was after having some sweet scotch and needed a beer, it really complimented the sweetness of the whisky we were drinking. A nice dessert beer without being sweet. The coffe has a nice aroma but not overpowering on the taste. Not an every day drinker but I would visit again soon."
"Overall this is an average porter. tastes how a porter should but nothing too special or exciting. Good drinkability, goes down easy."
"O: A good porter - not amazing - could be better."
"D- Would love for there to have been a bit bolder characteristics in the nose and especially on the tongue but overall its a solid beer I could drink all night."
"Pours a dark brown, small off white head. Smell of roasted malt, coffee and dark chocolate. Flavor follows suit with a strong roasted malt/coffee presence. Little hop bitterness is percieved. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, decent level of carbonation and smooth. Overall a good solid porter and worth getting ontap."
"Pours black, with a tan head that leaves some lacing. Aroma is roasted coffee, some dark chocolate, not too much. It has a medium mouthfeel, and the carbonation is more than I expected. Taste is mostly coffee, chocolate, dark fruit, hops aren't very noticeable. A very tasty porter that has a good coffee taste without being overly burnt or bitter tasting. The flavors seem to be more pronounced as the beer warms up a bit, you don't have to drink it really cold like a lager. This is another good Kona beer, not my favorite porter but I'd buy it again."
"Overall, pretty solid coffee porter but there are much better coffee beers out there. Worth a try."
"The beer was almost black with just a glimpse of light shining through the edges of the glass. The was lofty, rocky and the color of coffee with cream. The smell is mostly roasted coffee beans and some sweet chocolate. The taste is mild with flavors of coffee and roasted malt, there is a slight bitterness at first that gets washed over with some sweetness. The beer is light and silky with low carbonation. I thought this was a solid beer, it's dark but still light enough to enjoy in warm weather."
"I'm impressed with this seasonal brew. Smoky java smell, but a lighter taste. My only real complaint with this porter is that the flavor is not quite as rich as the aroma. I expected a slightly more pronounced coffee flavor but wasn't too disappointed with it."
"Really a pretty solid beer overall, with a dark, roasted profile"
"I picked this one up recently as part of a mixed six pack at Lukas a while back. Poured a dark brown/black color, with a thin tan head. Aromas of roasted malt, coffee and cocoa. On the palate, this one is light to medium bodied with flavors of roasted malt, coffee and chocolate."
"Overall, this is a very good beer. It impressed me with the strong coffee smell. The only thing that I had issues with is that the coffee in the taste isn't as strong as the smell, but it is still strong. Its a solid 4.0 in my book- very impressive beer."
"Overall, the appearance and the smell of this beer is great, but the taste is off. Can't say I'd buy this again."
"Overall I really enjoy this one every time I drink it. It is an easy drinking session beer that should be purchased if you get the chance."
"D: Very nice balance and tons of sessionable flavor at 5.4% ABV. Pipeline porter is smooth, sweet and a bit smoky with nice roasted herbal and chocolaty notes to pair well with a chocolate or raspberry dessert or perhaps even with a hickory pulled pork sandwich. Very good on it's own though."
"I like kona brewing so far and this is my second beer from them and, though not as impressed as I was with the fire rock, I find this beer very enjoyable."
"o: a good coffee brew. The best I have had to date for a good rich coffee taste. Slight burn of alcohol on the larger sips, though for the most part you would never know you weren't drinking a chilled cup of coffee. The sweetness of the malts takes the place of sugar and the creamyness and lack of carbination takes the place of dairy. Very good, a unique and strong coffee taste."
"Overall, this is a good beer, probably the best that I've had from this brewery. The coffee flavors are some of the deepest and richest that I have had in the style, what else would you expect from a beer that come from a region that prides itself on its kona coffee. The beer exhibits a fairly complex taste, but lacks some of the sweet cream flavors that can be found in other offerings."
"The only bad thing I can say about this is that it's hard to pair with any food, since it has such a distinct heavy flavor. Oh well"
"Overall - Easy drinker with a lot of flavor without killing you with a high ABV. Would gladly drink this regularly if it was available around me."
"D- This drinks fairly easy because it is so light. This is my 4th tasting and (just like another beer I reviewed today) I remember the previous ones being a little better. Overall, I would visit again down the road, as this wasn't unpleasant beer by any means, just lacking in a few areas."
"D - Awesome...could easily put down a 6er."
"This is an average to good porter. A pleasant aroma with hints of the Kona Coffee. Taste is neither bland nor overly aggressive. The coffee flavor is very pleasant with out being over bearing. The subtle flavors become more pronounced as the beer warms into the 40s. this beer has a mild slightly acidic finish, pleasant. While very drinkable, this wouldn't be my choice for a session brew."
"Overall, it's quite a quaffable coffee porter - maybe the best I've had? Its middle of the road body with a grainy (could it be the carb?) and lightly chalky feel doesn't lend as much smoothness or substance as could be desired in a porter, but I liked it just fine."
"It's kind of like hot buttered rum. It sounds so delicious but then when you have some you realize there's just some butter floating in your rum."
"Seek it out folks - I have bought this on more than one occasion. That means a lot coming from a guy that is all about trying NEW things.. this is the kind of beer I come back to."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability is say average, defiantly worth a try just might be the mood I am in today."
"As far as coffee beers go this was a little tame for me. Not bad but pretty dull overall."
"Overall decent beer. Good showing of coffee without being overpowering. Good flavors but not to complex. Enjoyable and glad I tried it. Good colder, like an iced cappuccino."
"Pours a dark brown, not opaque, nice off white head. Smells of a coffee house and maybe a hint of cocoanut. Earthy scent as well. Tastes of strong, fresh Hawaiian coffee and the husks of cocoanut. Slight acid bitterness at the end. Smooth and thin mouthfeel and this is really drinkable. I have not had many porters, but this has been my favorite."
"Bottled on 6th Jan '11."
"D - very drinkable and well balanced, at first seems almost like an iced coffee, but as it warms the underlying beer does show through with enough sweet and roasty malt to deserve to be called a porter. The coffee is clearly evident in aroma and flavor, and although the coffee flavor itself is unremarkable (I would not have known it was Kona if it wasn't on the label) it is well balanced and fits the beer without dominating."
"Pours a pretty much solid black with a tiny light brown head. Little lacing and no head retention. Sweet coco powder and roasted coffee bean aroma. Nice. Very enjoyable taste. Mild, but well done. Definitely taste the roasted kona coffee beans which highlight the flavor profile. A little chocolate sweetness and a tad bit of hop crispness. The roasted coffee notes come back around to finish the beer. A top sessionable porter with just a well blended, mild, but great flavor profile."
"Big taste in a beer of average ABV."
"Not very complex but a good solid porter with a nice coffee touch. An enjoyable and unpretentious simple beer that's good to have around. I'll buy this one again."
"D- really bland and boring. I expected a lot more out of this one, and didn't get it."
"Good beer. Nothing extraordinary for a coffeed-up porter, just a solid drinker."
"This works because it transcends all seasons. A good warm-weather porter. The more I drink this, the more I like it."
"Very drinkable beer, nothing too aggressive. Easy drinking. Good sessionable beer."
"I normally don't like heavy beers, especially porters but this beer is exceptionally good. If you don't pour it out of the bottle you honestly would never know how dark and heavy it is. It has a great coffee taste without losing any of its beer integrity. I higly recommend this beer to anyone that is looking to try something new and a bit different."
"Carbonation is a bit much when cold, but eases as it warms. A great session porter. I'd love to have this on tap."
"Color is dark brown--not quite black, with a tan colored head. Aroma is (as advertised) coffee, and lots of it! Taste is coffee and loads of malts. The hops don't really come though at all in aroma or taste. Body is medium with a very smooth and creamy mouth feel. It's lightly carbonated and leaves a lingering coffee & malt aftertaste, which is appropriate. The malt heavy profile of Pipeline provides a nice change of pace from the hop laden beers I usually drink."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"D: Very drinkable, quite nice."
"Overall, this was ok but there was not much there. The beer seemed watered down in flavor and reminded me of the ever so disappointing Java Head brew from Troegs. Also worth mentioning is the lighter than usual porter body, however this was made in Hawaii so don't expect heavy."
"The taste is smooth throughout slight carbonation it starts sweet with a roasted coffee taste enter. A smooth malt trails to a dry coffee bitter finish"
"Mouthfeel is nice - a medium-full body with light carbonation. Finishes dry with a light bitter aftertaste of coffee. This is a good, smooth drinking beer."
"Black with one inch dark tan head. Had great sweet roasty scent with a bit of coffee. Nice delivery on the taste. Good balance. A slight bitterness which was okay with me. Nice creamy mouthfeel. Just what I was expecting. Found it easy to drink and I usually shy away from porters. But, this one got me interested again."
"D - Moderate drinkability. Good taste, but a little too watery for the style and I have to bump down the overall score because of it."
"Final Thought - While I love coffee and I love beer, this combo is good, not great"
"D: Pretty great. The bitter bite throughout the flavor is interesting, but not fitting."
"This is a different kind of beer. Right now I'm not sure if I like it or not. Smell is intensely of molasses and coffee beans It has a nice dark color and a tan head, taste is where it gets difficult it has 2 flavors I like and a finish I don't really like. The firs one is a smokey porter with a hint of sweetness, the second one is a kona coffee which is mild but then it finishes with that all too famillar cold coffee bitter finish, which doesn't seem to go with porter, overall it seems it's just not the right kind of coffee for this kind of drink as something a bit boulder would probably give it a richer coffee taste and less of that finish. Because of this, wouldn't want to drink more then one of these in a night."
"D - This is a very drinkable porter, one that I enjoyed and will continue to enjoy in the future, just wish it had some more predominant flavors."
"The beer pours a dark brown/black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a really nice roasted malt and coffee scent. It's dry with a bit of chocolate sweetness. The taste is decent. It has a dry, bitter, black malt flavor with a mild coffee character. It goes down easy with a touch of caramel malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a good drinking porter. It's dry and roasted and just plain good."
"It's a good tasting porter, with a good amount of coffee flavor. Very easy drinking."
"DB- Has a wonderful drinkability compared to other porters I've tasted. Goes down VERY smoothly and leaves notes of smoked coffee beans dancing on your tongue."
"All in all, not what I hoped for, but good in its own way. I would certainly drink another if the opportunity presented itself and I can safely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good porter. I might even pick up a sixer."
"D: Not the smoothest thing across the palate and there is some acidity from the coffee but still a session porter."
"Overall this is a highly drinkable session beer. It's strongest flavors do not affect tastebuds over time, and it's smoothness makes it pleasant to swallow."
"Kona Pipeline Porter is an opaque beer that's the darkest brown. It has a big, fluffy, light brown head that shows outstanding retention. If has a full aroma of roasted coffee, wood and slightly sweet grain. It's medium bodied and very smooth-- almost flat. The finish is chewy and slightly chalky. It's nicely balanced with lots of coffee that's both roasty and wooden. It's just bitter enough. This is smooth and easy to drink."
"One of the best coffee beers out there. A coffee beer does not have to be huge and boozy to deliver a wonderful coffee flavor."
"Pours very dark brown when held to light, nearly black when just peacefully resting on my table. Nose has whopper of a coffee aroma. No ambiguity there. Same on the palate, almost like a cold coffee with carbonation. Some roasty flavors present too. Medium to light bodied and a long coffee finish."
"Because of the uniqueness of this one, I can't really see myself drinking a six pack in a weekend, let alone a good night. If I were some place that had it on tap, maybe. It's good, and worth having, but not a kick back and drink beer."
"DB- Has a nice porter feel to it. The coffee has too much of an acidic feel in my opinion but it still goes down decently."
"D: Before I knew it I drank 6 of these. Good price, good beer, & easy to get."
"Drinkability - quite drinkable..would work a little better in a colder environment, I think..which ironic in that the brewery is from Hawaii."
"The feel of this beer medium bodied and has a smooth feel going down. It is pretty drinkable and has only a small aftertaste that is gone in the shortest of time."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Great smell with an above average taste make this a very easy brew to knock back with some friends. I just wish that the flavors could have followed up on the very promising nose, but oh well. Quality brewing from Kona, nonetheless."
"I enjoyed this, nicely balanced and drinkable."
"D: Extremely drinkable with a well balanced and delicious flavor profile alongside a surprisingly easy to drink mouthfeel. Combined with the low abv, I could see this being a very easy beer to knock back a few of without batting an eyelash."
"Overall a fairly drinkable beer, but not a favorite amongst the coffee porters and stouts that I've had."
"Overall: I'm not a coffee drinker, but I really enjoyed this beer. I'll probably try to brew a similar beer in the near future."
"The body and drinkability were both typical and average for the style. Overall, this was a slightly below average beer, not terrible by any means, but also not note-worthy or memorable."
"Dr: Well worth a try for a porter fan like me, especially at its relatively low price. I'll reach for it again when I don't feel like trying something new."
"D - Good price for this bottle, maybe a little bit heavy to drink all night."
"Dark brown color. Strong smell of coffee beans. Very easy drinking porter. Goes down very smooth. Alcohol taste is negligible. Medium-strong coffee taste. As I lover of dark coffee, I love this porter. Excellent smoothness to coffee flavor ratio. Great drinker."
"this beer pours a dark translucent brown with a tan head that recedes quickly to a ring of lacing. the aroma brings a strong roasted malt scent with a nice coffee counterpoint. the taste follows with a rich coffee flavor enhanced by the black malt taste to a near tart bitterness. the medium mouthfeel and good co2 make this a very drinkable beer."
"Mouthfeel is pretty good, it meets the overall standard for a porter I guess. Its probably more medium bodied than full, could certainly be more full in my opinion. Somewhat smooth with a strong bitter finish. Good drinkability overall, I'd certainly get it again. The first Kona brew I've had, I'd certainly be willing to try more."
"D - Quite drinkable and flavorful, yet still a bit lighter than other coffee porters I have tried."
"D- Very drinkable. Well balanced where the coffee doesn't overpower the porter profile and vice versa. Watery, but enjoyable."
"An easy drinker with tons of body."
"A nice, solid porter that I try to sample on its yearly release. Good stuff."
"poured a dark brown in color with brown highlights that had a thin head and left some good frothy lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma had a very nice bouquet of coffee beans with vanilla, chocolate, roasty, and faint nutty notes. The coffee bean and roastiness meshed really good with vanilla, chocolate, slight herbal notes, and a touch of hops on the backend. The brew was medium in body with a moderate amount of carbonation which had a sweet, roasty, mild astringent, and silky finish. It drank really good and is probably my favorite beer from kona."
"Drinkability - I could drink this all afternoon! Especially on a cold day or with a good winter stew."
"Its lightness makes it go down easily. The coffee is used better than most, though there isn't much else going on. One-dimensional and good at what it does."
"Very drinkable for a porter, which is not my favorite style."
"Cheers."
"To me, there is a good drinkability to this porter but mind you porters are not for everyone. If paired with the right meal, perhaps either a rich pork dish or a barbecue meal, this beer would be an ideal dinner time match to just have a beer with the meal. That said, with a relatively low ABV and a good taste packed into the bottle, porter fans would have no problem in having this beer serve as a session beer."
"D- Probably the best coffee infused beer I have had. That is saying a lot since my local go to is Central Waters Coffee Stout for all you old school acronymphs."
"Drinkability: Not very drinkable for me, but I still would enjoy a few with a dessert."
"Great for a coffee beer fix, but not a regular purchase."
"D: This is very drinkable. Goes down smooth, has a moderate, pleasant coffee flavor to it, and the semi-sweet dry finish means I think I could hit this for an entire evening and be a happy man if it was the only option available to me."
"D- if it wasn't so flat and thin this beer would be decent at worst and great at best. the flatness and thinness ruin it for me."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a very dark, almost opaque brown with a light brown head. Head was maybe 1/2 finger, and didn't last long, but left a thin ring around the edge. Aroma was burnt malts and coffee with a bit of chocolate hiding in the undertone. Slight acidic hint in the aroma. Taste was at times slightly milky sweet, other times it was a bit bitter like coffee. Ended up with a dark chocolate taste lingering in the mouth. Felt a little thin in the mouth, but left a nice coating linger akin to a rich dark chocolate. Easy enough to drink, pleasant sipper, but nothing outrageous."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Drinkability is high in my opinion. I've had it as a session beer before and its great whether your sipping and savoring or downing three pint glasses."
"This beer is medium bodied, with some nice carbonation. Very pleasant overall, and nicely drinkable."
"Notes: This a tasty American porter a good one to enjoy during the colder months. Cheers."
"Fairly drinkable beer."
"Good lookin' single finger mocha colored head. Comes back nice with a swirl o' the glass when halfway thru. Rich nose of coffee and toffee and all that good roasted stuff. Bit of a bite after the bitterness of the coffee sets in and then real smooth on the way down. Lashed back a sixer of this puppy while putting up the house Christmas lights on a cold cloudy windy day. Thoroughly enjoyed."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a sa perfect pint glass. The pour is midnight black with red highlights, medium white head, light lacing. The aroma is dark brewed coffee. It taste like it smells, black coffee. The coffee is not overwhelming, but is predominant. The beer is light for a porter, well carbonated. A solid coffee porter, they should take limited release off the label as it looks like it has been around a few years."
"Usually when I buy a single of a beer, that'll wet my appitite for more. But not in this case. I want more Pipeline Porter, and I plan on getting a ton more while it's still around. It's perfect for the winters here in Florida, where it doesn't get too cold, but I still get the craving for something a bit heavier."
"Drinks: I usually like my porters more robust in character, but this one was actually nice. Good coffee flavors, not too heavy and easy-drinking."
"M&D - thinner than I expected, nearly Irish Dry Stout thin, but that makes it quite drinkable, the flavors are noticeable and unassuming without being stripped of all their power, would be a great bridge beer for a BMC drinker, a nice beer."
"Pours a deep brownish black color with a thin white head and a generous amount of lacing. Smells of coffee and roasted grain. Tastes of roasted malts, honey like sweetness, and tons of coffee in the front and also in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thick with a nice medium body and drinkability is high."
"M, D- Medium bodied. Thankfully there is absolutely no detectable sourness/acidity therefore the Pipeline is quite drinkable."
"Well worth the 8 bucks."
"D- Porters are my favorite for this time of year and this one is no exception. It's cheap ($7 sixer) and an easy drink. I'll definitely pick this one up again for relaxing on winter nights."
"D: I've always been a bigger fan of added ingredients to porters rather than stouts. In my opinion, the overall subtleness and transparency of the style lends itself extremely well to outside taste agents. This brew illustrates my mindset on that matter perfectly. I would reccommend this brew even for non-coffee drinkers."
"Poured very dark brown almost to the point of being black with a one fingered tan head with nice lacing the length of the glass. Aromas of earthy coffee, malt and chocolate. On the palate this brew had a liken to a iced coffee with mocha hints. Lightly carbonated with a medium body. Quite an exceptional porter."
"D- obviously there is too much coffee here. taste is good, but is complexity too much to ask for? wont be drinking again unless i mistake it for my morning coffee in a tired haze."
"D: Overall, although there's not much to write home about as it's not a special occasion brew and doesn't have outstanding, over-the-top qualities, this is still one of my favorite beers because of the good mix of coffee and chocolate and that it's not too heavy. For me this is my 'ole reliable American porter that I get every winter. I recommend it to those who like coffee stouts and porters."
"Overall, I really enjoy this contribution from Kona and I find it to be a beer i consider frequently when looking for a nice porter with some character"
"Poured into a tulip glass. Color is a very dark brown with a light tan head. Nose brings pretty much a straight shot of coffee. Also some light chocolate and roasted malt. Taste is coffee, roasted malt, and some mild chocolate. Good roasted feel and drinks fairly well overall. The best beer of theirs that I've had."
"Overall this was a bit of a let down. I wasn't expecting anything amazing, but being a product of Kona coffee, I was expecting stronger coffee notes. The beer seemed to go flat awfully quick (both in flavor disappearing quick and very little carbonation). I don't think this is something I'd buy again."
"A guy who works at my local distributor was very excited to find someone interested in this brew. His enthusiasm persuaded me, and his review was pretty spot on. Pours a dark brown/black colour with very thin lacing on glass. The smell is pleasant, it smells like carmel and coffee (but not a heavy, dark roast). The taste is similar,it definitely lets you know it's a coffee based drink, but is lacking the bitterness sometimes seen in these. The mouthfeel is smooth and the finish is nice. This is very easy to drink, you can easily have several in a sitting, and I appreciate the beer salesman's input."
"I really wanted to like this beer, but I just found it rather unexciting. Certainly a good sessioning beer."
"Light-bodied like a brown porter, it has a clean finish with noticeable notes of coffee in the aftertaste. The light body increases the drinkability and I can see this as a great porter for warmer climes."
"D- I feel the drinkability is pretty high considering the style. Nothing too palate pounding but flavorful none-the-less. Fell in love with this beer in the summer of '07 on a trip to Oahu to visit a friend...had said friend pick me a up a 6 pack for when I returned this summer. She probably doesn't realize what it means to me...there's just something about it that I love and will always (baring I get to have this again in the future) bring me back to the middle of the Pacific."
"D - a highly drinkable good tasting porter."
"Cheers..."
"Decent cost at 9 bucks a sixer."
"D - I am not going to seek this out, but if I am ever marooned in an oh-so-provincial bar or locale, I would perhaps reacquaint myself with this Hawaiian style."
"If you like coffee like I do, you will really like this brew. I was very surprised by how rich and smooth the flavors were. I plan on returning to this brew fairly frequently."
"Not bad for a Porter. I really love the creamy mouthfeel, but I wish there's lot more flavor to this beer."
"The mouthfeel is very prickly and refreshing and I feel for more. Really a great beer."
"drinkability good. i could put a few of these back. it's nothing spectacular, but a pretty good and readily available porter"
"Good porter, great coffee beer. I wanted a more robust body for such a great tasting beer. It was not thin just lacking in the full body of a great porter The aromas were full of coffee and roasted malts. Hops were in balance for a porter. Clean yeast flavors. Nice coffee aftertaste? Not over the top."
"D- good session beer."
"Nearly creamy, lighter side of mid bodied. Mouth coating, real nice and goes down very easily. A very good flavorful session porter."
"Pours dark, a solid dark, not too menacing. Smells of some sweetness and coffee but not overpowering. Tastes of coffee and malt. The coffee has a syrupy taste to it that coats the tongue and is quite pleasing. A very drinkable and enjoyable beer. A solid representation of its style. A beer I continue to look forward to every year."
"Something with such a coffee and bitter mouthfeel rarely is so drinkable."
"Final Notes: An all-around delicious beer, and definitely a beer that the coffee lovers should check out. Relatively sessionable, and would be a good choice with a variety of food."
"A-taste sorta blends together, obtains a bitterness to it, but still stays great"
"D- Great, very, very great. Tasty, interesting and a must try for coffee-beer lovers. Big ups to Kona for this great seasonal."
"drinkability: pretty high on drinkability. nice coffee/malt balance. can easily be a session beer."
"Even though I know this Porter is one of the few Kona varieties that is widely distributed across the country, I still wanted to try it at the source (or rather at Kona's Koko Marina Pub on Oahu). This one has an opaque dark brown color with a lighter brown glow around the edges and a thin, creamy tan head. The aroma is a mild combination of a light caramel malt sweetness with a smooth coffee finish. The flavor is likewise smooth and subtle, with a nutty sweetness from the roasted malts, and the coffee flavor being noticeable but mellow, much like the 100% Kona coffees I had been tasting around the island. The texture is smooth, creamy, and again quite mild. Overall, this one is smooth, easy, and relaxed with just enough intrigue from the local coffee to make me want to buy more of this porter when I get back home."
"T- The coffee is more in the aftertaste. Nice and smooth. Nice chocolate sourness in the front. Almost tastes like a shake. Not too bad."
"Coffee was up front and personal with this beer from the get go. Coffee was strong in the nose, strong on the attack, and sat down to chill on you palate. I did get some roasted malt qualities in the body of the beer but they were quickly over powered by the coffee. Usually when a beer is so heavy on coffee the body would be pretty thick, this was not. The body was light and thin, making for an easy drinking coffee beer. The fact that this beer was so refreshing, makes it a great solution for the Imperial Stout Lover, looking for a lighter beer, during the summer months."
"Dark ruby transparency. Some good coffee and roasted malt notes in the aroma. Taste is a bit of a letdown. The positive characteristics of the smell are replaced by a soapy water flavor with only a slight roasty aftertaste. Thin and tingly mouthfeel."
"O: While this beer is brewed to style, there are a few minor flaws that could be addressed: Aroma is overpowered with coffee: I would have liked more of the malt character to shine through. The coffee is good, but I believe that balance is important. Flavor is also overbalanced with the coffee, almost to the point where I believe I'm drinking a cup of coffee and not a beer. M: I believe that with an increase in malt character/presence that the body will greatly improve."
"On the islands, on-tap, I'd give this a 4.25."
"Quite dark and opaque with brown edges. Not much of a head formed after a hard pour, but there was a thin skim of tan bubbles coating the surface. Good retention for what's there, a bit of streaky lace too. Roasted aroma, nutty, hint of cherry skins, malty, bit of chocolate. Moderate bitterness, same flavours as in the aroma. A bit of hop flavour towards the end. Short linger of roast, malt, and fruity hops. Smooth, well integrated carbonation made up of fine bubbles. Slightly less than medium bodied, a hint of astringency from the dark malts. Pretty good overall, an easy drinking porter."
"A really drinkable porter, especially if you are a coffee drinker. Extremely tasty,."
"D - I really like this one alot, not as an everyday beer, but definitely as a regular one."
"Pours a very dark brown, with a nice cola colored head that retains OK. The aroma has a huge, gourmet coffee blast upfront, along with some dark chocolate, burnt bread, and a little caramel. The flavor has a little more depth than the aroma, with nice coffee notes initially, followed by some unsweetened cocoa, a little rye bread, brown sugar, fruity esters, and a little charcoal. The mouthfeel is smooth and rich, and drinkability is excellent for a coffee beer. Very solid beer, but I fear the age on this one (I believe it's out of season by a couple months) hasn't been particularly kind and decreased the complexity and intensity of flavors a good deal. I'll have to do another review when this comes out again in the fall."
"D - the shallow flavor and thin feel would not make this a brew that I would reach for."
"While I am generally rather weary of flavored beers such as this one, I think this beer has a lot of character and is certainly worth trying if you can get your hands on some. As of yesterday (4/16/10), there were several cases remaining at the store here in Tempe, AZ...Enjoy!"
"Pipeline makes for as good a porter as it seemingly does a surf break; as if there weren't enough reasons to want to go to Hawaii already. The islands may have maintained a distinctive culture, language and heritage, but as far as I can tell they brew with the same attitude and style as any other paid-up member of the United States of America."
"A deepy roasted aroma is starting to procure from the beer. I like it. It's not a strong aroma at all. A little muted. I just can't get past that bitter aftertaste. Sticks to my teeth. And I love coffee too! WHATUPWITDAT!"
"Overall, I enjoy the Pipeline Porter. It exhibits a great balance between the tradition of the English Porter (the rich coffee flavors) and the innovation of an American Porter (the Kona coffee and creamy flavors). Despite the lack of fullness in the mouthfeel, I would return again and again."
"Drinkability: I could drink this all night for the smell alone as it's great! Flavors are solid and the mouthfeel is good, although it could be a little thicker for my tastes; ABV is quite moderate as well and it doesn't pack too much of a punch. Body isn't overly heavy either, so I wouldn't feel weighed down by a couple. A solid offering and well worth picking up if the opportunity presents itself."
"D: A very good porter, especially if you love coffee and malty brews."
"this beer is very smooth but definitely a sipping beer not for session drinking. great with a burger and fries, or in the morning when you run out of coffee"
"Easy drinking, very flavor heavy session beer. Too bad its only seasonal."
"Grabbed a single of this at Marty's yesterday. Not too much heading on this one, just a thin white lace, and a nice dark brown color. The nose captures coffee that is kept really well tamed. Sometimes the coffee angle can be a bit much for me, but it is perfectly balanced here. Taste has more coffee, again kept in check throughout, and some light milk chocolate. Mouthfeel is on the light side, and really very drinkable. I like the fact that this beer is complex, but not hitting you over the head with any one smell or flavor. I have heard people grumble that this one is contract brewed, but whether that is true or not, this is one tasty porter to be had."
"The flavor is strong (read: harsh) on the black patent malt, meaning strong black coffee taste. There's no sweetness or creaminess. The aftertaste is short lived. Good body that fits the style."
"D-Goes down easily, but due to being so one dimensional, this is a one and done."
"Pours a near black color with ruby highlights around the edges when held to the light, minimal head and lacing. Smell is of medium roasted grains with a presence of medium roast coffee beans, faint hints of cream and earth. Taste is mellow and contains medium roasted grains and medium roast cofeee beans. The coffee is of high quality, but lacks boldness. The roasted grains also lack any real punch. Faint hints of earthyness and cream are present as in the nose. The body is the best part, amazingly medium to full in body, smooth and creamy for a porter... very nicely done. This is a very nice beer made with high quality ingredients, but lacks a little boldness in the taste and scent areas."
"Pours a dark brown with garnet highlights and a fluffy tan head that dissipates slowly. Smells of roasted coffee, hazelnut, slightly earthy hop aroma. I got intense hazelnut when I first poured it, but that gave way to an earthy spicy aroma. Light roasty taste mixed with coffee and hazelnut. Earthy, almost tart or metallic taste mixed in there as well. Lingering coffee and slight fruity sweetness in the finish. Moderate body and carbonation. Creamy/oily mouthfeel. Overall not a bad brew. I could see myself sessioning these easily."
"very smooth and drinakable. A dark beer that could easily be drank in wamer weather, an iced coffee. great coffee flavor, they did the right things to make the coffee stand out."
"Purchased a six pack at Macy's Liquors in WR. Poured into standard pint glasses. Not much head for a porter. Dark brown color. Slight lacing. Smelled like roasted coffee. And taste, that was coffee too. High-end coffee, you can tell. The Kona variety is top notch. Not a lot else going on with this brew though. Not much of a malt backbone, and a somewhat thin but smooth body. An easy beer to drink, but not a beer to eat with dinner due to the intense coffee aroma and flavor. A good bet for an after dinner drink or a dark chocolate dessert."
"I picked this one up today and first my wife took a sip and made a really ugly face and said it was horrible. I tried it and agreed. The aroma was thin but smelled of bitter old cofffee and nothing else. The only detectable flavor was watered down coffee. It wasn't bitter or hoppy, it was just nothing. Very dissapointed in this one. Actually poured it out. I'm glad I only bought one. Lagunitas Cappacino Stout blows this away,"
"D - This is at least as good as my typical morning coffee...probably better. Quite one dimensional in character (if you don't like coffee, this is not for you), but still very enjoyable. This is coffee as it would be in an ideal world where we can all wake up, not go to work, and relax on a lanai overlooking the Pacific Ocean from sunrise til sunset..."
"D- A nice porter for a change of pace. Sweet, but not too sweet. A well balanced porter."
"D - This is really awesome and sessionable brew... A little more rich creaminess and this could be a top notch world class American Porter... Even without that, this is one of the best coffee infused offerings out there today... I would welcome this in my glass any day..."
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Deep black color, though drak red when held to light. One inch head formed and quickly dissipated. No lacing. Smells of coffee and some roasted malt. Tastes like it smells, mainly coffee and toasty malt. Mouthfeel is rather light, not much carbonation. As a coffee lover, I really liked this beer. Not the best porter I've had, but I would definitely recommend to anyone who likes coffee."
"drinkability: definite must for coffee beer fans, wouldnt recommend to people with a preference for more subtle flavors."
"Pours a dark brown color with a small tan head and some decent sheets of lacing. Aroma is nutty, light caramel and earthiness. Not sure how old this bottle is but the coffee seems to be rather lackluster. Taste follows suit with the nose. Dry chocolate at first followed by a light nuttiness, some caramel and just a hint of coffee. No bitterness is really detected. Mild, but pleasant flavor. Medium body with light carbonation. Decent brew!"
"D: Decent porter but nothing exceptional, the aroma and flavors are bit muted. This beer doesn't have that big punch of coffee I was waiting for. I'll take a BBC Coffeehouse Porter over this one anyday."
"D - A good all-round porter. The bitterness of the coffee would make it difficult to have more than one."
"D-this is quite a solid coffee porter, big flavors well blend, smooth and sweet."
"D: This is a surprisingly good coffee porter, especially from Kona. I like the coffee flavor, but there's a touch of acidity to it which knocks it down just a bit."
"D: A solid coffee flavored porter. Nothing really jumps out at me about this brew, but it's tasty nonetheless."
"This brew isn't bad. I was expecting more from it, but not really disappointed. This beer would be easier for me to fully enjoy if I had a small snack to eat every now and then while drinking it, but that's just me. Overall, I say a good beer."
"All in all. This is a decent brew to try at least once if you like porters or breakfast stouts. Reminds me of a poor man's version of Stone Kona Coffee brew."
"D: Really great, I could drink a number of these with no problem, its incredibly smooth and enjoyable."
"D- a very quaffable beer here, not overly impressive but def. a good drinker"
"Drinkability: Pipeline is smooth and tasty, but I was expecting a lot more after the tempting aroma."
"M/D - A fairly thin body which was disappointing. The coffee flavors are great. Overall a very enjoyable beer to drink. Recommended."
"Overall, a good example of a coffee porter available almost everywhere. Not the best, but certainly worthwhile and sessionable."
"D- A decent brew that was a bit of a let down although still very solid."
"D: Pretty good, but not the best porter I have ever had. Certainly has a nice coffee kick to it, which compliments the roasted flavor. Pretty good in general, but does not stand out in the style."
"One or two of these in an evening would be about all I would care to drink. A decent porter for the price."
"12 ounce bottle, a buddy brought some island brews back for me on a recent trip to Hawaii. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch tan head. Head retention is good, and there is a lot of lacing left behind on the glass. Aroma is coffee, roasted malt, and bittersweet chocolate. The taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some hops. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it has decent carbonation but it does seem a bit thin. Drinkability is good, I thought it was easy to drink. I like this beer a lot, it's a good all around brew that I would definitely pick up again if I come across it."
"Despite the weak feel, Pipeline Porter is a delicious roasted coffee porter that is an absolute treat with a dark chocolate dessert. Delicious."
"Liked a lot of the other beers form this brewery, so purchased this new offering at my local beer store. Pours a nice dark brown, slightly off-white head to it, moderate lacing on the glass. Nice creamy mouthfeel to this one, average body to it which fits the style good. Nice roasty flavor and well balanced... coffee malts complimented by some nice hop taste at the end. A nice all around porter, definitely an above average one and this Kona Brewing Company is putting out some solid offerings."
"Into a pint glass, poured black with one finger of khaki head, which collapsed immediately and didn't lace very well. The smell, not surprisingly, was punctuated by coffee beans, vanilla, and molasses. The taste was similar; coffee which dissolved to a vanilla/semi-sweet flavor, and then a very subtle finish. Medium and spritzy. A little too much coffee flavor for me to session."
"Drinkability: Easy drinking coffee beer. Nice, but could use a little more body and pizzaz."
"Definitely not an aggressive, full of roast flavor coffee beer. More like 7-eleven coffee that's been sitting out for awhile. It's not bad but there are so many better coffee beers out there (Meantime, Wolaver's, etc., that I couldn't imagine picking this up again)."
"Overall a good, unique porter."
"Mouthfeel is thin and there is a sizzle from the carbonation. I'd prefer a little more body and a little less bubbles but it's not that far off and doesn't ruin the experience of this beer. This is a solid coffee beer and should be tried by anyone who appreciates the mix of beer and joe."
"M/D - Average amount of carbonation volumes but has a nice velvety medium body. Very smooth to drink whether it is right from the fridge or if it warms a bit. No weird adjunct flavors in this beer, just coffee, dark roasted malts, and subtle hints of chocolate."
"M/D - Fairly light body, as foretold by the weak head and lack of lacing. Enjoyable and I would have it again, but I wouldn't want more than one in a sitting due to the strong coffee flavor."
"Drinkability: This is the best beer I have had from Kona and I wish I could get it more easily here. I could have six. I love the multiple layers of coffee and chocolate. This has a different taste than most in the style."
"The beer pours a dark brown/black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a really nice roasted malt and coffee scent. It's dry with a bit of chocolate sweetness. The taste is decent. It has a dry, bitter, black malt flavor with a mild coffee character. It goes down easy with a touch of caramel malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a good drinking porter. It's dry and roasted and just plain good."
"Mouthfeel is good - what you want in this style of beer. The drinkability is rated pretty high here just due to the great taste. I think this is a winner even among people who aren't 'beer geeks'. It is a lot of flavor and a big beer, but I think it has a lot to keep you coming back!!"
"Drinkability: Heavy on the coffee, but if you're a fiend for the bean like me you'll really enjoy this one. Just like a normal cup o' coffee, I could put a pot of this stuff back like it's nothing. This is easily one of the best coffee brews I've tried for sure."
"D: Very drinkable beer, this is an easy going coffee porter."
"Drinkability: Pretty standard porter fare here. This one is heavier on coffee than most which makes for a tasty experience. Worth a shot..."
"Pours a dark, black with a thin white head. Looks like black coffee. And... This really just tastes like mild black coffee. I know Kona coffee is revered for it's smoothness and natural sweetness but this is so thin. I'm a coffeegeek as much as a beeradvocate and I've tasted coffee with more complexity than this beer. I may be just used to all the BIG beer I drink nowadays but this tastes like the bud light of coffee porter/stouts."
"Drinkability/Final Thoughts - This beer was extremely drinkable! Thinner than expected but it was nice because it allowed me to drink a few without getting full. This beer offered rich coffee & porter flavors without being to rich & desert like, I really enjoyed this one, and I will definitely be having it again. Cheers!"
"Notes: I'm really underwhelmed with this beer considering the fact that I love coffee beers. I was hoping for a kick-ass coffee porter with beefy malts and plenty of chocolate to go around. Instead, I ended up with a slightly above-average porter that kind of reminds me of Flying Dog Gonzo in the way that the profile feels shallow and offers nothing to discover underneath. No need to seek this one out again."
"It was served rather cold and it definitely improved upon warming up. Became thicker feeling. Good abv. Nice to have this on a winter day with a good meal."
"Overall Impressions: Decent porter, but not particularly memorable. The flavor was less than aroma made me expect."
"Overall: An unexpectedly good beer."
"fresh coffee feel porter. a little off of opaque black with a small head, white. not much stickiness. nose of coffee carries over into palate as straight foward coffee... acidic earthy toasted coffee bean. mild hop gives it a geranium floral quality. i can see how this part can make the beer seems a bit displaced. the citrus acid and coffee acid earth. could be a bit creamier. abv sits quite well."
"D - A beer for a coffee lover. A great Porter offering from Kona."
"D - Pretty easy drinker. Nothing jumps out, not really a big beer. But Probably a good beginner beer for BMC folks who haven't had a good porter."
"Appearance is a dark brown almost black with little to no head. Smell of dark roasted malts, dark fruits and coffee. Taste pretty much resembles the aroma that is well balanced with the hops. Mouthfeel is a medium with good body and carbonation. The only thing I found disappointing was no head and lace, but it goes down quite well."
"Overall a real nice coffee porter. I would love to settle down over a sixer of this beer."
" ~ Overall this is a good brew. I'm not sure if I could enjoy more than one or two in a sitting just because of the intensiveness of the flavors, but I do recommend trying to get your hands on a bottle if possible."
"D - This is one of those beers you could absolutely enjoy for breakfast (in fact, I did the other day). Excellent brew by Kona!"
"D - A good coffee porter but all the flavors could stand to be a bit bigger. A great start though and a good breakfast beer! I wouldn't turn this beer down ever."
"Mouthfeel is medium-light, light but coarse carbonation. Not much in the way of a finish. Drinkability is hurt by the fact that this beer (as in, what was in this bottle - may have gotten a dud, but it was only 2 months old. Seriously.) just isn't very good."
"Quaffable and easy to drink just not much more than that. I won't be seeking this one out in the future."
"from the initial pour i knew this was gonna be a great one. the smell of coffee is apparent but the flavor is nicely balanced. this is one of the most drinkable coffee porters i have experienced. it goes down extremely smooth, very malty, not hoppy, with an excellent coffee taste. i was really impressed with kona brewing on this one. this is an extremely sessionable beer and there is nothing offensive about it. this was really good..."
"Highly recommended if you can get it."
"drinkability: a great beer that I will continue to buy"
"This one was disappointing during the pour-light black with brown caramelized edges, this one didn't fizz too much on a vicious pour and even though it eventually built an (okay) head, the smell was all light roasted coffee with a watery edge. Taste was light as well but the coffee flavor that was present was well done, tasty and pungent. Mouthfeel was thin, flavor was on track but derailed by the watery mouthfeel."
"Pours almost black with a fluffy tan head. Excellent retention and lacing. Aroma is of coffee and roasted malts.Body is medium with light carbonation. Taste is roasted through out. Coffee finish,with maybe a hint of chocolate. Nice version of this style."
"D- Goes down really easy. I could enjoy several in one sitting!"
"Love this beer and have bought it many times."
"Notes: This is a very tasty very sweet and easy drinking stout that would make a great session beer or breakfast beer."
"Overall: This would be a terrific porter if it just had less carbonation. Instead, it's above average/pretty good."
"very drinkable, I'll have another please"
"Overall, a great beer for this style, which seems to have many entries who are hop-heavy. It's nice to see a darker beer with a decently high ABV that is not overly hoppy. Solid, balanced. My only regret is that it is not a little blacker and heavier in the mouthfeel."
"J"
"I don't know what I expected out of somebody combining my two loves in a glass, but this was pretty good. Great translucent black color, but I feel like the experience would have been more complete with a lingering foamy head. The taste, simply put, delivers. Exhibits both beer and coffee chararcter. Dark, earthy malts come to mind the same way as espresso, with a surprisingly crisp hop finish that compliments the similarly surprising mouthfeel. Good stuff, and a great break if you ever get tired of Octoberfest offerings."
"Mouthfeel is full and creamy, but also tannic and puckery. Average drinkability, the coffee is a little overstated for me, would like more balance."
"This is a great porter, dark, roasty, malty but still medium/light bodied and drinkable. There are definitely some porters that drink like stouts, and this isn't one of them. It's well carbonated, the relatively low alcohol and strong flavors make this a nice session beer. It's also worth noting how well this beer held up for 6 months the flavors were still strong."
"D: Very tasty, could have a few of these. I am admittedly a coffee lover however, so if coffee isnt your thing, try it, but perhaps just one. A delightful porter."
"D - Impressed with the coffee flavor. Don't drink coffee outside of stouts and porters but tastes like some quality beans were used. Pint was very drinkable. Heavy on the coffee and caramel malts, couldn't have more than one."
"A unique brew that would be quite nondescript without the coffee addition. Yet this is surely REAL coffee in this beer, not some malt derivative."
"Drinkability? It's a good tasting and easy drinking example of the style. Nothing super dooper about it but very solid. I like."
"Drinkability: I could drink this stuff all night; it's great!"
"Notes - Maybe the best coffee porter I've ever had. Mahina means moon in Hawaiian."
"Drinkability: As crisp as this porter feels, this beer would be immensely drinkable if you're able to get it in more than just singles. I think this would serve well as a fall or spring beer where the chill is still in the air, but it's not quite cold enough for the RIS and winter warmers."
"A huge thanks to JaBier for giving me this bottle!"
"I can't even stand a sip of coffee, but put that same taste in a beer and I'm ok with knocking back several. This is no exception. I'm almost all the way done with the beer I was reviewing, and I'm ready to head back to the fridge for another one."
"Overall this was lacking. I was hoping to be surprised here after some of Kona's other beers were above average, but this just didn't do it."
"This was nice. Good balance between the coffee character and Porter qualities and a solid mouthfeel kept this nicely quaffable. One of the better bottled offerings from Kona."
"Nice, black coffee porter! Too bad this is a seasonal beer - I would enjoy it year-round. Aroma is good, but not as strong as I had expected. Pours with a solid inch of beige foam, and the lacing hung around to the finish. Freshly roasted coffee and chocolate malt, medium carbonation, and thick mouthfeel. Minimum hops. Burnt sugar. Reminiscent of 1554, but distinctive. Great with food, with a nice malty, bitter finish."
"D - This is a nice porter with lots of coffee character. There are no noticeable flaws, though the non-coffee malt character could have been stronger. Quite drinkable."
"D - Easy to drink. Though the coffee flavor is not as strong as some I have had in the past, the mellow strenght of it's flavor allows you to have more then just one. Probaby good if you are not that big into coffee in general."
"Dark brown to black with a thin head. Dark roast coffee and chocolate on the nose. the flavor is rich roasted malt and dark (kona) coffee with notes of cocoa. A medium to full body that would benefit from just a touch more creaminess and roundness. A solid, full flavored porter. Too bad it's not year round."
"Overall, a bit of a let down. I love coffee aromas and coffee beers and had heard good things on this one but it lacked in those areas somewhat. Very drinkable but you don't really remember it the next day. Rotation - avail here in TX. Had a couple times now so know that it's not an off bottle issue. I just don't find it that flavorful. Maybe the rare 6 pack or single. Would try on tap at least once. [OR;O]"
"UPDATE: Got word from Redhook, the East Coast brewers of Kona beers that no extract is used in this beer as I had been previously told. Great to hear! I like the beer even more knowing this."
"I used a bottle of this in a short ribs recipe, and the ribs were excellent."
"Verdict: Pipeline is a very straightforward beer: a solid enough, but not amazing, American Porter with a nice coffee focus. If you like Porters and coffee, give it a try, just don't expect a mind-blower."
"This was my first sampling of the Kona Brewing Co. and I was very impressed. Will be picking up the Fire rock Pale Ale later in the week."
"Pours a very dark reddish color body, small tannish head, some lacing and lasting. Strong coffee and chocolate aroma, some roastiness. Strong smoke and coffee taste roasted chocolateness. Watery palate. Smokey roasted aftertaste. As it warms up it tastes worse."
"A very nice porter and the addition of coffee boosts the drinkability and seeming smooths out the carbonation."
"Overall this is an okay porter, good flavors, but gets a little too sweet the more I drink on it, which is okay for one bottle, but I don't think this would be a good session brew for me."
"D: Very good beer. Milky feel and mild flavors make this easy to drink."
"Decent, I would try this if you were just beginning to aquaint yourself with coffee-infused brew."
"My god almost 2 months without a beer review. They're stacking up on me! Great surprise here at a St. Pete convenience store. Pours to a super opaque dark brown with a nice foamy tan head that has some structure. Smell is great coffee smell with some toasted malts and hint of butterscotch with some great earthen hops. Taste is roasted malts up front some coffee in the middle and a bitter like hopped coffee finish. Mouthfeel is a little thin for the smell and flavor of this brew, I expected a little more substance. Another great selection from Kona Brewing Co. Price is right and drinkability is great."
"A flavorful, full bodied Porter. In terms of drinkability, the spiced-espresso flavors are a little too intense for my tastebuds for this to be a sessionable Porter. A unique, well-balanced Porter. Note: ""Brewed by Kona Brewery, Portsmouth, NH for Kona Brewery, Kona, HI"". Wondering if there's a flavor difference between the two. I guess that I'll have to book a flight to Hawaii to give it a try first-hand."
"Pours black with a brown head that quickly dies and thins out. Sweet roasted malt and coffee scents. Very tasty with velvety smooth sweet malt and chocolate, coffee flavors with a little bit of hops in the finish. No bitterness that I can detect. Good lacing down the glass. I'm a big coffee fan, I really like the kona coffee flavors in this. Very drinkable."
"Like other Kona's, it goes down smooth with nothing offensive in its nature. As I get to the last sips, I wish that I had bought more, but the carry out on Kuhio street has more!"
"really liked it, and wish it was more accessible here"
"drinkability - Has a nice coffe taste it. Pretty god, worth a try."
"Pours a clear dark brown with some ruby/purple hues in the light. A thin tan head fades fast but leaves some ok thin lacing rings. Smells of coffee beans, chocolate, roasted malt, and toffee. Tastes big on coffee, along with some roasted malt, a slight touch of cocoa powder, and toffee sweetness and a citrusy hop finish of pineapple. Medium to medium light in body with OK carbonation. Smooth and creamy though a little thin, but still pretty good. Easy to drink, pretty sessionable with lots of raw coffee flavor."
"On-tap at Zekes. $4 for a 12 oz. draft of course. This is less a porter and more just a generic dark ale - in the same sense to sometimes come across Euro dark lagers. There's a subtle roasty character and a light cocoa taste, but for the most part, it's a sort of dark-colored bland beer. I wouldn't try this again."
"This is good but not a top flite porter..."
"D: A sessionable porter. Good drinkability. I've already sent this beer off with some friends. I look forward to having some more!"
"Not overwhelming or groundbreaking by any means, but very easy and pleasant to drink. I've had it once on tap as well and found that experience about on par with the bottle."
"This is a great session porter and highly recommended."
"Picked this one up at the local grocer. Pours a deep opaque brown with frosty head. Smells of fresh brewed coffee and a hint of baker's chocolate. Taste is powerful, black, freshbrewed coffee, the kind that gives you bloodshot eyes and the jitters. I think I wouldn't drink this beer before bed time but definitely a good pick me up."
"An opaque black with one finger tan head that sticks around for a little bit. Light coffee notes hit my nose first, and then some roasted and bitter chocolate notes. The coffee and roasted malts are very evident and up front but not overbearing; this is a somewhat smooth and creamy beer, medium-bodied w/ a little bit of sweetness. Has minor citric hops notes so the beer finishes slightly dry and crisp for balance. Not an excellent porter but one to enjoy nonetheless."
"This is decent for a session but is a tweener - too heavy for a brown and too light for a stout. The first promise gets lost a bit. Still, there are good components to take away."
"Solid drinkable brew that I would recommend to a freind."
"Drinkability- This is quite the drinkable porter, I would love to have it again and I get to as I've got a six pack of the stuff. I could do this any day."
"Well made, everything is in balance. Does not give impression of a porter with coffee added, but all the flavors work together. A good pick-up."
"Strong, smooth taste of coffee and chocolate with hints of something nutty I can't quite identify. Unusually well balanced considering the strong flavor. Pleasant aftertaste which is bitter and short-lasting. Carbonation is a bit strong for my taste. Drinkable, although the alcohol is more prominent than I expected in a 5.4% ABV porter."
"I liked the way this beer smelled and looked, dark with an enticing coffee aroma. It was smooth and drinkable but I did not care for the after taste, maybe because of its strong coffee taste. I like both beer and coffee even mixed but I prefer a hint of coffee. If you like a bold coffee flavor than this porter is for you. I would drink this again but it wouldn't be my first choice."
"D: This isn't the most complex porter around, but it's well executed. Unlike some beers that claim to be brewed with special ingredients, this one manages to walk the fine line between becoming one-dimensionally cloying and the victim of its own marketing hype. A nice offering."
"O- A truly great beer, held back only slightly by the weakness of the nose, but the taste is incredible, with the coffee incorporated so well. I need to get some more of this one."
"A good coffee brew but not as good as I hoped seeing that they push it so had on the label"
"This beer goes down very easy, and is somewhat tasty, but it seem just a bit thin in both feel and taste."
"D. Very drinkable. Light and not overwhelming. By far the best aspect of this beer is the drinkability."
"D - Definitely a go to session beer, but would like to see a stronger hop profile."
"M/D - Medium bodied but just a touch thinner than I would normally want out of a porter. Still, very good flavor profile and easy drinking. An excellent brew."
"D - A very good but light tasting porter. I have been wanting to try this porter for years. Not disappointed, but not as exciting as I thought. Still it's a very sessionable porter."
"This beer has a heavy dosing of coffee in the flavor. A bit much for me, but then again, I am not a coffee drinker. I could see this making a tasty morning beer though. Roasty, bittersweet and creamy all are good descriptors for this beer. I do like this beer and it tastes very fresh and crisp. It is an easy drinking, no worries brew...perfect if you are on island time."
"On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz. Poured into a pint glass. Dark brown body with a nice dense cap of cocoa colored foam. Nice lacing and retention. Aroma is cocoa powder with a big dose of somewhat tart coffee. Flavor is caramelized sugar, roasted grains, solid roasty bitterness, mildly tart coffee, and a touch of dark chocolate. Pretty typical. Mouthfeel is a little thin. More body and a deeper malt profile would make this a great beer, but as it is, it remains just 'good.'"
"Poured the bottle into a glass, nice DARK color, you can smell the Coffee as soon as take whiff, very balanced, good tasting and surprisingly smooth finish."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a nearly black color with a big tan head that retained fairly well. Smells of roasted malt, roasted coffee, and a bit of hops. Tastes of coffee and sweet roasted malts. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for what I expect out of a porter but other that than this is a extremely smooth beer. Not my favorite porter out there but not bad at all."
"Overall: A the mouth feel is astringent and dry. The finish is bitter and lingers on the palate for a few moments. The beer is very well made a nicely blended and very easy to drink. There is a touch of a harshness in the beer. The could be a bit more refined and have a little more coffee flavor. It seemed that the coffee just blended in with the beer. If the coffee could stand out a little more it would be great. I really have enjoy drinking the beer."
"Pours black with a slight head that fades to an extremely thin ring. Nice mellow coffee in the aroma along with some light creamy roastiness. The taste is fairly light, but that nice clean coffee taste is still there and there is still some light roastiness as well as some late minerality. Nothing super special here, but nicely made and enjoyable to drink. Smooth in the mouth and lightly creamy. Nice, and not too terribly expensive either."
"Jet black in appearance with a slight beige head. Roasted coffee smells with a malty, nutty, odor as well. A good beer that is an easy drinking porter. Unmistakable roasted coffee taste. A well balanced beer that is highly drinkable and an overall solid brew. Great for winter days and cool evenings in the spring and fall."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0812"
"The mouthfeel is a bit too thin for a porter, but it has a nice creaminess that makes this extremely drinkable if you dig coffee (and beer!)."
"I find Kona Brewing's Pipeline Porter to be perfectly mediocre, like the rest of their offerings that I've sampled. This one has a nice coffee aroma and taste, but is a bit watery compared to champion-caliber porters I've tried. I think there are better things to do in Hawaii than brew beer, and it shows..."
"Drinkability: More for the folks who like coffee in their porters I would say. I could go either way, but the coffee flavor seemed to overshadow everything as it warmed. Not to say I didn't enjoy it or couldn't have a few pints, but for me it eventually got in the way a little bit."
"In sum, it's not bad and is certainly drinkable, but I was expecting more given the appearance."
"Maybe I bought a bad six of this style. Totally not impressed....could not find the coffee taste, thought the overall taste was thin and watery. Would choose this only if it was the only Porter available. I will probably give it another chance seeing it is available at a good cost at my location."
"HV"
"This is only available at Los Angeles Bevmo's between winter and spring. I usually buy at least two sixers when I find it. I'm still undecided if this is a session beer or not."
"Drinkability: pleasant tasting, but again a little too subtle. The coffee taste especially on the aftertaste is nice."
"Something going on between the carbonation, malts, and acidity of coffee isn't doing it for me flavor and body wise. Not bad by any means, but I would prefer my coffee either by itself or in a more fortified, complex beer with a less prominent place in the overall flavor profile. I think the acidity of the coffee sort of takes over this one."
"7/4/6/3/13 (3.3/5)"
"It's hard to mess up a porter, and Pipeline Porter is just fine."
"The aroma was one of the strongest of any beer that I have sampled and for that I have to give it high marks. The Kona coffee that this is brewed with gives it a distinctly coffee smell. Leading up to the taste which is definitely a heavily bordering on coffee. A very nice tasting beer. Fairly rich, but still medium bodied. Another good effort from Kona."
"Aloha."
"Try it with anything you'd have coffee with! And unlike coffee, it might even go well with a nice grilled strip steak."
"Very drinkable. I highly suggest this one."
"My one complaint would be the mouthfeel -- for such a smooth, creamy beer, I'd expect a little more thickness, and Pipeline tends to be thin. That's good in the sense that the beer is highly drinkable, and not overpowering, but my own taste would tend towards something a bit more robust."
"I can see why it's popular, but it just isn't quite my speed."
"This is the third Kona Brewing Co. product I have tried. They have all been very enjoyable. This might give me an reason to take a vacation in Hawaii!"
"I could probably drink a couple of these in a row, it's not overwhelming, doesn't coat the mouth, but does settle into the stomach and feels heavy. Or maybe I'm just full."
"Not a big fan of porters, but this one is nice. Almost black pour with a ring of brown bubbles for a head. Aroma is coffee with some cocoa and malt. Great flavor. Not overpowering coffee, but it is there, with a good balance of sweeter malts and some bitter hops. Dry finish."
"D - I loved this beer, but I wouldn't drink to many. I have a rough time with caffeine."
"D - I can say that I won't be revisiting this beer anytime soon it was very hard for me to drink this beer stay away unless you like cold black coffee"
"Good stuff here. Certainly not in your face but it does capture the coffee flavor that most brewers seem to miss by either not having enough or becoming too acrid. Very well balanced."
"D: The drink ability is very good. I would drink this every morning haha. If u like coffee, its for you. Has just the right amount of coffee flavor."
"M = Creamy, heavy body, very good mouthcoating. A great luscious feeling beer."
"If you enjoy coffee like I do you will love this beer. A limited release offering that should be available year round."
"D: Pretty solid. This one actually surprised me. I truthfully was not expecting much, but it far exceeded expectations for sure. The coffee is well apparent...just like my cup of black coffee in the morning."
"Pours pitch black with small khaki head, little retention, lacing all the way down. Smell: not particularly strong black coffee, cocoa. Pretty mild. Taste: predominantly coffee, with roasted, burnt flavors, touch of chocolate. Not much in the way of hops. Mouthfeel: there's a creaminess yet it's pretty thin, finishes like coffee. Pretty good for the coffee end of the porter scale, but there are much better porters out there."
"I really like the coffee-stout/porter combinations that are coming out these day. They go well together. This one does a good job of mixing the two. Recommended."
"The mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Drinkability is very good. The combination of interesting flavors and a rich mouthfeel are winners. This would be a great winter time session beer."
"NOTE: One of Wiseman Justin's favorite beers. This review will surely be ammended when he finally gets around to reviewing it."
"A pleasant porter to drink. If the aroma was more robust, and the chocolate milk flavor was toned down this would be a really good beer."
"Poured into a standard pint a deep cola brown with a thin wispy beige head that was gone ver quickly.The Kona coffee really shines in the aroma along with some roasted nut,mollases,and even a passing shot of piney hop,flavors are heavily roasted and coffee-like with some bitter unsweetened chocolate,finishes with some mollases and a bit of earth.Not overly complex but the coffee is nice and it went well with some bbq smoked sausage I had for lunch."
"Not a bad coffee-ish porter at all, though not as rich as other coffee-accented brews I've had - a bit too sweet - not crazy about the smell or flavor of the coffee in this one, though I liked it well enough. Good - but nothing ""great", IMO."
"I like this porter. High drinkability due to its creamy smoothness. Recommend."
"Pretty high drinkability all around. It's reasonably tasty and goes down easy. Should be good with any food that coffee is good with, a lot of breads and maybe some chocolates come to mind immediately. Still a sort of unexciting brew in the end."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a dark black, chocolaty color with a small tan head, decent lacing. Light carbonation. Aroma of coffee and chocolate. Taste is that of Kona coffee (if you know the taste) and chocolate with a slight hop taste as well. No heavy coffee/mocha aftertaste. Mouthfeel is pure heaven, smooth and crisp. An awesome beer. I suggest you try some Kona coffee before you try this beer so you can truly appreciate it."
"This one pours a rich, chocolaty, opaque brown with a thick and fine-bubbled tan head. Aroma is strong and mainly of coffee with hints of unsweetened chocolate. Roast, smoky coffee taste dominates the flavor, which has a subtle undertone of chocolate. Texture is smooth, and finish leaves a flavor of mocha."
"Loved this brew. I want it for breakfast everyday."
"Drinkability: Goes down real smooth, nice in the afternoon after a long day. We'll have to wait and see if the coffee in the beer causes caffeine jitters! Toss this beer in with some ice and blend it up for a nice frappuccino that even Starbucks would enjoy!"
"D: This beer simply didn't do much for me. A good Porter is one of my favorite beers. Throwing coffee into the mix is a clever idea, but is it necessary?"
"Drinkability: Ahh one of my favorite beers. It is the perfect marriage of coffee and porter. Love this with a beef dinner or just sipping after."
"Overall a good porter and a very decent coffee beer."
"Just about a perfect porter."
"Overall, a solid entry into the pantheon of porter - with a little less pronounced coffee flavor, this would be a top-notch brew. Would definitely recommend to porter enthusiasts."
"I figured this beer would be pretty good from reading much about it in the past year or so. Turns out to be a very flavorful Porter without going extreme on the gravities. The beer begins convincing enough with a brown appearance and moderate head formation / retention-- light on the lacing. Firm aromas of chocolate malts and nutty coffee dominate the beer, with only a light detection of piney hops hiding closely behind. Flavors prefer the cocoa and coffee as well, giving the beer a rich maltiness, medium nuttiness with vanilla and toasty notes throughout. The hops balance well but don't interfere much with the delicate Porter / Brown Ale balance. The beer is silky smooth to the palate in a similar manner as an Oatmeal Stout. There are no problems with this beer at all-- likely the best of the Kona crop."
"From the wonderful aromas of coffee in the aroma I was expecting the same in the taste but it's a bit more subdued. Still, it's a good porter and some might find it easier to drink because of the lighter coffee taste. I, however, love the taste of coffee in beer."
"I really enjoy the weight of this beer. The majority of the coffee infused beers that I have had are way over the top. They are good but so rich that you usually just sit down to have one of them. This porter has a good enough balance that you still get the coffee flavor that you are looking for, but it doesn't weigh so had on the belly. The coffee is good up front and then followed by a thin porter malt. good mix"
"Surprisingly good. I mean, I was pretty shocked. There were more Hawaiian brews sitting right next to it on the shelf. I could drink this every day."
"D - No worries there. Very drinkable."
"this brew pours black. I'm in dim lighting so maybe its dark brown. quickly fading off white head. good lacing. it has a delicious aroma! coffee bean, nutty, cocoa bean, amazing coffee aroma! the taste is coffee bean, roasted malts, subtle spicy hop balance, sweet malts. medium to light body, low carbo. A super badass beer! I dig it....My new fave session Porter!"
"This beer pours dark brown with a light brown head. The smell and taste are both primarily coffee and malt. It is the truest coffee taste of any beer that I've had so far, but it's ultimately a bit sweeter than I'd prefer. The sweetness isn't particularly cloying for the flavor of the beer, but it's still prevalent and a bit unbalanced. The beer tends to the sweet end of the spectrum without enough balancing bitterness. It's enjoyable as an occasional treat but too sweet coffee-dominant without enough beerishness from malt or otherwise."
"While the taste also agrees with the earthy coffee it is one that tastes of a black with no sugar nor milk added in."
"drinkable, but not too impressed"
"D: If you like porters for variety, you shouild try it. It was a very pleasant beer in gulps or sips and probably a little less filling than some."
"It's not bad, and I'd recommend it to those not too well versed in coffee porters/stouts, and those looking for something a bit different. But in the Northwest, where coffee and beer reign supreme, I feel like this one falls behind a bit into just a step above mediocrity."
"Basically- it tastes like iced coffee. This is a beer you would have to be in the mood for to drink."
"Feel is decent for a porter. It's a bit thin and watery. Carbonation is very low - it has just enough to keep it from being flat. Drinkability is relatively poor. After awhile it just feels like I'm drinking a cold cup of coffee. And cold coffee isn't exactly the most appealing thing to me. Finishing the bottle was rather difficult."
"One of my favorite porters now, rich with roasted malts and dark coffee overtones and I find very drinkable. Kona's pale ale is my stand by right now and this dark seasonal is right up there too."
"D: This is one of those odd beers that despite its lack of complexity in the taste department, it's still quite drinkable. An interesting beer."
"Jk"
"Overall, I like this brew alot. A great and different porter from what's available in Florida. I had it with a waffle,egg and ham topped with brie cheese and syrup for dinner and it was the bomb. Enjoy"
"Drinkability: A surprising, subtly tasty treat with a reasonably, sensible ABV. I'll have another, please."
"Drinkability is good. This is not too bad and I'd have another, but it's not my idea of a ""porter", even a coffee porter."
"Pours a brownish/black - coffee colored, with a small 1/8 inch head. Smells of beautiful roasted coffee dominates the malts. First sip is pure coffee heaven. Fairly light bodied, carbonated well. If you like coffee and coffee infused beers, you will not be disappointed with this fine beer from out 50th State."
"12 oz bottle. Pours pitch black with 1 cm of thick tan head that diminishes into a thin oily layer. Aroma of espresso/coffee, very strong. Initial flavor is smokey malts. Flavor becomes a little more bitter by the end from the coffee. Aftertaste is all coffee and limited in duration. Light to medium body, limited lacing, light carbonation, and limited alcohol presence. Overall a nice coffee porter."
"The body is between light and moderate. Really would have like to see more body, especially with porters. The watery flavor doesn't help the cause out. Overall would have liked more out of this beer."
"D : It was real drinkable. The smaller than expected coffee flavor helped with that. It's one that I would drink again."
"D- Easy to drink no matter how warm it is outside."
"Taste: Lightly carbonated, the coffee flavors are there but do not overpower. The only slight downside is the perceptable ashy finish. Very low on the hop side, but there's nothing wrong with that. Went really well with a vanilla washed cheese I had."
"easy drinker that has a very nice feel to it. My first Hawaiian beer and I look forward to the next."
"Medium bodied and highly drinkable, I recommend that this beer be tried."
"D: This is a very nice porter, though nowhere near as unique as I thought. I wish the coffee was a little more prominent, and the prune juice scent brought back less-than-pleasant reminders of childhood home remedies. Still, it is easy enough to drink and enjoyable enough that I would have one again if given the opportunity."
"This brew pours a dark brown, borderline black, with a decent layer of light tan foam on top. Smell is largely of roasted/burnt malts, with a hint of coffee behind it. Flavor follows the smell, with the roasted malts being the dominant flavor. Coffee is present and tasty, but not nearly as up front as I would like it to be. More like a standard porter than a coffee porter, but still solid. A little thin on the mouthfeel, I'd definitely like a bit more thickness to it. Very drinkable though, could easily be a session brew."
"Nice. Subtle, but nice. Mild toasty malts, undercurrent of coffee. Not particularly full bodied, but nice enough. Smooth, with a touch of pucker at the end. Overall, a decent beer."
"Pipeline Porter has a deep brown color, with very little head retention. I couldn't get much out of the aroma, which was very dissapointing because I was hoping at least for a thick coffee smell, but nothing. The beer tasted great though, a subtle roast flavor that combined with a coffee flavor that was a little to subtle for my tastes. I also tasted some lactic sourness in the background, not unpleasant though. I would have liked more flavor out of this beer, but perhaps it's beauty lies in it's subtlety, which also makes it easier to drink."
"This is one i could drink winter, summer, fall, spring... all the time. It is very nice and easy to drink. The bottle says limited release, guessing for the winter... so come next winter i will seek some of this out for sure."
"All in all, a good beer. Worth drinking as an everyday beer during the cooler months, but still accessible in the summer. I wouldn't go out of my way for it if I weren't in Kona's distribution zone, but if you see it at the store and want something a little different, I'd say give it a try."
"D: If you enjoy thinner porters with above average ""fizz"" you might enjoy this more. I think it is easy drinking but disappointing needs more body."
"12oz bottle poured into a nonic. The color is solid black with a short, off-white head. The smell is definitely coffee but subtle and not overdone. The flavor is a sweet, coffee porter that again is done very subtly. This is a solid beer and I don't usually like coffee-infused beers."
"Pours Pours black with ruby edges and a nice foamy tan head. Smell is cream and coffee all the way. Very espresso like and very noticeable, but not over the top. Taste is smooth, roasty, creamy and coffee with no burnt, charred or acidic notes from the coffee. Could be a slight bit thicker but as is, it is a very nice drinkable porter. Very balanced and one of the nicer coffee beers I've had."
"D: It was a pleasant brew with a medium body, balanced flavors and clean finish."
"Drinkability - a fine session porter from our 50th state. Mahalo!"
"Drinkability: I could drink this anywhere any time!"
"Better than I expected."
"Not overly complex, but a very nice porter, with high drinkability that makes it a nice session beer."
"Pours jet black with a light tan head. In the aroma, sweet malt and coffee hints. In the taste, small, sweet malt and a nice coffee presence all the way through. A small bitter, yet mainly smooth, medium bodied mouthfeel. Big coffee, nice body, balanced with a nice hop presence."
"d- I feel like this is an excellant after dinner drink, like in the place of an espresso or something. I like it, but was hoping for more."
"Brought out in a frosty mug, which was a shame because it would have been much better had it been a bit warmer. What can you do though. Nice looking stoud with a 3 finger, pitted tan head that had impressive retention. Served to cold to get much of a smell. The taste was big coffee with some chocolate sweetness and plenty of toasted malt. Nothing special about the mouthfeel, pretty average for a porter. Not especially thick or thin. Solid flavor on this one, but nothing out of the ordinary. A nice sessionable porter that I would drink again, but don't think I'd go out of my way for it."
"Thanks to friends Adam and Christina for recommending the beer. I'm glad I could try it. Hawaii may not be known for craft beer, but I think they can pull it off anyway."
"Thanks to gglwebster for the sample."
"The taste is excellent, with a nice malty taste, excellent mouth feel and a great finish. You can definitely drink a few of these at one sitting."
"To be honest, I wasn't impressed much. Next..."
"Not the biggest fan because of how one-dimensional this brew is. Pours black with kakhi, smallish head that has decent lacing. Aroma is fully kona coffee and the flavor is the same cup of joe. Mouthfeel is like drinking a coffee flavored soda. Okay and original."
"D- There are some nice dark malt flavors but they are light and overpowered by the tangy quality. Kona coffee is not something I really drink but I like the unique smoothness that it adds to this beer, I just wish there was more of it."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark black color with a creamy light tan head. The aroma is dark roasted malt and fresh coffee. The taste, much like the aroma, is roasted malts with a bitter finish that produces more of the coffee flavors that were present in the aroma. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy like a good porter should be. Overall, this is a pretty solid porter that is recommended."
"This is a tasty and very drinkable porter. I'd have this again."
"This pours jet black, with one finger of creamy off-white head, which leaves a little lacing as I drink it. The aroma didn't suprise me, and it pleasantly mocha. It doesn't smell like a sharp bitter coffee, and seems to err more towards a rich creaminess, accented with caramel and hazelnut. The flavour picks up on all of this, and revels in a smooth coffee creaminess, followed by a slightly sweet, nutty long finish. Very light carbonation and a perfect body for a porter, combined with what I have already mentioned, makes this a very drinkable proposition."
"Drinkability: I would love to try this on cask, but I'm about done with the six pack I bought. (by done I mean, I don't want any more)"
"with a dry coco finish. Overall a classic big body porter with a great coffee taste!"
"All in all, a great beer that proves to be compelling and highly drinkable."
"Viscosity reminds me of a strong french press. Not as weak and watery as a cup of drip, but not quite the espresso crema that I was hoping for. More quantity of malts to fill out the taste and fill out the mouthfeel would take this to an outstanding beer. Not bad in it's own right, but it could be improved upon."
"Went down very smooth, almost like a nitro-stout (Guinness/Murphys). Best served as an after-dinner drink. Would order again."
"D: A nice beer from Kona, might pick up a six-pack later, a nice, tasty drinking beer."
"Prosit!"
"Mouthfeel is decently thick, not terrific, but very serviceable. Nicely drinkable, I enjoyed it with a BBQ burger and it held up without overpowering either that flavor or the wonderful fries. Solid, dependable porter, easy to drink, but not quite the home run I was hoping for from Kona."
"The first taste brings about a sensation of cold, dark coffee. On second sip, it's not that strong, but it does conjure flavorful java notes. Mouthfeel is medium in body with a good carbonation level and a near lackluster finish. The coffee just doesn't carry through like it should. Drinkability is decent for a porter: it's complex and quite tasty, but not one I'd go nuts over if i came across it again."
"Drinkability: I could drink a bunch of these in a row. This beer is wonderful and easy to get through. It is a decently strong porter that could even be a good session beer. Unfortunately I got this through a trade. I do not know when I will be able to enjoy this again."
"Overall this is a fantastic porter, one of my favorites. This is the first time I've had it from a bottle, I was happy to find it and I bought five sixers of it ;). Try this beer!"
"Thanks to mmmmBEEEER for sharing a bottle. This Porter is a deep dark brown color with a medium thin tan head that has decent retention. Rings of lacing on the glass. Aroma of coffee and hops, plus some roasted grain. Medium body with a nice coffee character. Roasted malt, hops and chocolate flavors are all present. The finish is maintains the coffee flavoring with some burnt malt and leaves a lingering hops aftertaste. This beer is pretty solid all around."
"strong coffee, clean finish. $1.99 for a 12oz bottle from Haggens Beaverton, OR."
"I'd like to have a pound of this coffee every month."
"D: I have stocked up on this, along with DFH 60, Old Rasputin as my go to beers of choice."
"When poured, it was a very dark brown, on the verge of black. No foam or lace to speak of. The smell of sweet roasted malts filled the nose with a pleasant aroma. Also, there was a hint of coffee bean. The flavor was of mild roasted malts and coffee, with a hint of chocolate. Nicely balanced, another winner from Kona Brewing! I'd give it another extra half point if I was in the islands, sitting on the lani looking out at the ocean."
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black color with a thick tan colored hed that has pretty good retention and leaves a bit of lace. Aroma is of coffee of course along with some chocolate. Smell is a bit faint. Taste is of coffee obviously as well with a nice roasted bitterness. I think the coffee presence here is nice. Not overpowering but you still get a nice coffee flavor as you would expect from a coffee beer. I would however, like a little more malt character. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than you would like. Nicely drinkable beer for someone who enjoys coffee such as myself."
"That being said, it is every bit as good and a much better value than the Meantime."
"Personal score- 78/100"
"D- This is very drinkable but for the wrong reasons. It is a bit too bland. The mouthfeel lacks thickness to support the coffee flavor."
"Pours a dark molasses with a small one finger khaki colored head that quickly dies down to just about nothing. Stickiness is very weak, little to no lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell is very oatmeal stout like. Sweet toasted oats up front in the nose with a sweet french roast coffee as well. Sweet caramel malt with some nutty flavors as well. Taste starts with a sweet mocha coffee and a woody vanilla flavors. A slight hop tingle is noticable midway through with a roasted barley in the aftertaste. Medium bodied mouthfeel with a decent carbonation to it. Not as coffee-ish as I thought it would be, still a solid brew overall. Thanks again Chris!"
"Pipeline Porter pours pure black with a tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is coffee. So far, so good. I'm not the biggest fan of coffee beers because they tend to taste like green pepper to me, but this one manages to stay away from that. It has a nice coffee flavor that pretty much dominates, but really is in nice harmony with the porter flavor. Pretty enjoyable, I probably wouldn't buy it again, but it's worth a try, especially if coffee flavored beer is something you enjoy."
"Drinkability is okay. It is a rich beer that that could use so more balance in malt. I still enjoyed the beer but probably won't pay $9.00 a six pack for this ever again"
"The beer decamps the 12-ounce bottle a rich deep brown to black with sparkling ruby highlights, the moderate creamy light tan head, crowns the glass, upon its demise, the lacing forms a surrounding sheet on the glass. Nose has a deep rich coffee aroma, sweet malt and chocolate back it up superbly, Start has a pleasing roasted grain presence, sweet with a nice twang at the back, top is light to moderate in feel to the palate. Finish as a beneficent acidity, the hops delectable, and the coffee like taste carries to the slightly bitter dry end, a fine porter, quite a nice drinking beer this one."
"D: I love this brew and have so in the past...I only wish it was brewed year-round!"
"Coffee aromas dominate -- very pleasant and appetizing. Tastes sweeter than the tap version, but the coffee does a decent job balancing the malt with its roasted qualities. Mouthfeel would be more appropriate for a higher gravity, higher alcohol brew, but it goes down smooth enough. Just a little big for a warm Hawaii afternoon. I'd like to try this on tap soon and see if my memories of the tap version (brewed on the big island) being drier and better carbonated are accurate... Either way, this is one of my favorite beers made in Hawaii, but it's got Kona coffee in it, so it's not really fair."
"Body could be heavier. If the body wasn't as thin and it was a bit more creamier on the tongue this could be a really good beer. Sometimes I find the mouthfeel can really help or hurt the entire beer and I think this is the case here...it hurts it. I wouldn't turn one of these down, as it was still a pretty good beer, but I won't be searching it out anymore."
"Bottle courtesy of CBA: Poured a medium black color porter with coke-like carbonation and a very small foamy head that disappeared way too quickly. Aroma of weak coffee notes with some light roasted malt as well. Taste is comprised of weak malt with some roasted bitter notes and some weak coffee notes. Body is way too watery for the style with some low carbonation. Im not sure if I had a bad bottle but this is definitely not too good."
"EDIT: Had a couple the other night that tasted creamy and sweet. Maybe it needed to sit a while to grow as I picked up one the first shipments of the brew. Tasted much better, so reflective on my score."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin, could use some more body and a creamier texture would really do wonders for this beer. Drinkability is high but its not really a beer that one would want to drink more than one or two. It does start to get better as it warms up so that would be recommended."
"A bit thin. Well balanced, as the coffee is not overwhelming. Very low in alcohol. I fouind this to be very enjoyable. A bit more body and creamy feel could make this outstanding. Nonetheless, certainly worth seeking out if you enjoy coffe brews."
"D- like unsweetened coffee with alcohol. flavor is too much to session, not right type for my taste buds, pretty interesting overall even with its rough spots"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, forming a 1/2"" tan head over the very dark root-beer brown brew. Head fades gradually, with reasonable slow-falling lace. Aroma is light, with dark malt sweetness and coffee apparent only upon working at it. Expect more on a brew that advertises prominently all about the coffee in their brew. Taste is moderate sweetness upfront, with some coffee bitterness at the close, but no real body to either the brew. Mouthfeel is thin, and drinkability is pretty easy, but nothing really makes me want to search this one out again. Was let down here."
"D: The abv is low and the coffee porter flavor is well-mixed, this is a good beer no matter how you look at it."
"D - Very tasty coffee accented beer. Maybe the best beer w/ pure coffee added that I have tasted. I found the coffee flavors to be a plus unlike some other reviewers before me. A bit sweet to consume in multiples, and on the rich side, gut still very drinkable."
"Thanks to Noxious26 for the bottle!"
"D: Really tasty brewtoo bad it didnt have more body. With a bit more mouthfeel, this could have been a decadent treat."
"Recieved this bottle somewhat unexpectedly from flexabull (thank you). Served at just about cellar temperature, into a snifter, from a twelve ounce bottle. Poured a deep brown that looked black in the glass. About a finger and a half of thick, soapy, light tan colored head rose up from the glass with a somewhat vigorous pour. Head retention was decent and some thick lace was left on the glass. Smell: A very pronounced roasted coffee aroma filled my nose, followed by some sweet chocolate notes. Smell was split between bitter and sweet. Taste: bitter rich coffee, smokey roasted malt, and a small hop bite mixed with more coffee in the finish. Pretty smooth and clean porter. Mouthfeel was a little thin and watery with minimal carbonation. Drinkability was pretty good as well."
"Drinkability is good. A very nice easy drinking, yet full flavored porter. Very session worthy."
"Pours a nice clean dark brown color, nice carbonation, quick fizzy little tan head, no sticky lacing at all. The nose is malty, lots of toffee/coffee going on. The taste is of roasted malts, and toffee/coffee, the finish is dry. Light-Medium body. Drinkable, my first Kona/Hawaii brew, not bad at all, recommended."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my shaker glass. Appears a dark translucent brown color with about a finger of tan head that vanishes rather swiftly. Smells of sweet caramel, milk chocolate and roasted coffee. Tastes initially of bittersweet coffee and cocoa, followed by sweet caramel malts. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but still pretty decent with medium carbonation. A well done porter that I would seek out again."
"I like coffee/chocolate porters/stouts a lot and I think this is one of the best."
"Thanks to Talisker for the trade! Pours a deep black with a thin tan head that diminishes to a ring. The aroma is dominated by coffee with dark malts not far behind. The beer is quite tasty for a coffee porter, I still prefer coffee stouts, but this one is very well done. The beer is light to medium bodied and very crisp. This is a very enjoyable beer."
"On tap 2.5 years later, kind of synthetic in the coffee and chocolate and way too much chocolate."
"I really liked this beer. Very interesting and the first coffee porter I have had. I had this in the bottle as well but the draft version seemed fresher and more aromatic. Both were delicious and recommend both."
"D - My first craft beer I had in a half dozen weeks, I loved every second of it."
"Strong coffee flavour with little other complexity or highlights. Nice, but nothing special."
"Overall, the thin mouthfeel is a bit disappointing, but still this is a good coffee brew. I'd like to have my next one with some dark chocolate."
" This beer has huge coffee flavor without the bitter acidity that usually accompanies coffee beers. I wish I had some Kona coffee to drink next to this. The porter flavors are woven seemlessly into the dominating coffee flavors. The mouthfeel is well carbonated, and a bit thin. I want another one, I would trade for this again."
"Average, very dark brown color. Low aroma-mild roast chocolate, no coffee aroma that I was expecting. Deep, rich malty flavor. Good dark chocolate flavor as well-no coffee anywhere to be seen. Very nice body-very full and satisfying. A decent porter but the absence of the coffee is a mystery to me after reading the label."
"drinkability is good. balanced and enjoyable. it's always a bit of a challenge combining a flavour into a beer. in this case, it seems like the porter is a little less robust than it could be, letting the coffee show through nicely. even so, the coffee is not overpowering, seems just right. tasty and quite nice, glad i've got another bottle!"
"Maybe it was the 'Limited Release' on the neck label, but I expected Pipeline Porter to be a better beer. Although it's a good, balanced, sessionable coffee porter, it fails to top Kona's own Fire Rock Pale Ale as far as I'm concerned."
"Doesn't live up to my hopes, but certainly worth a try. And I've never had a true misfire from Kona, who doesn't seem to get credit for what they do - I'll visit the brewery some day!"
"Drinkable and then some. Wow, this stuff goes down easy. A nice little porter from the Islands of Hawaii. Thanks to the parents who didn't disappoint with their stash of gifts from their trip. Thanks!"
"Mouthfeel is light, low carbonation creates an easy drinker."
"Picked this baby up at a bottle shop in Phoenix. The beer poured a deep black hole color with a slight, deep tan head that ran away quickly and left a slight ring around the edge. The nose was a very pleasing roasted coffee with some cocoa notes. The taste was a robust roasted coffee and chocolate bonanza with a good malt backbone to boot. The body was somewhat full as expected but enjoyable all the way around."
"Overall, recommended. There are other coffee beers I'd reach for before this, but I still enjoyed it."
"This is a very nice digestif brew."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability- Reminds me of Full Sail Half Pipe Porter, but not quite as good. Not bad, but I've had plenty of other coffee infused dark beers that have been better. Worth a try though."
"From a bottle poured a very dark brown tending toward black with a fat tan head. Big nose of coffee, chocolate, and dark roasted grains. Mouthfeel medium with an oily coffee bean texture, and flavor is not nearly as powerful as the aroma. This is not bad stuff, and as a porter is decent, even if not quite in the very top tier."
"D: Drinkability is very good, although I'd still like some more CO2 in there. 10 minutes into the beer I can't even aggitate any foam on the top. I could see this being a fun beer to drink on the beach. Cheers!"
"Drinkability is very good. I hope this limited release becomes a regular part of the Kona Brewing Company lineup. I think this beer would be an excellent compliment to a chocolate dessert. Recommended."
"Drinkability: How does a beer that smells so great taste so ordinary?"
"on tap at PB Bar and Grill, a deep dark brownish black beer with smallish head, some decent lacing. Looks pretty good for a porter. The smell up front is cofffee, some sweet malty richness. Taste- Starts off a little sweet, ends up with the bitterness of the coffee. Some chocolate peeks through in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was good, slightly chewy. The problem with this is the drinkability, the coffee becomes a little overpowering. Probably couldnt have more than 2"
"Easy drinking good tasting porter here from Kona brewing. A nice suprise from the islands."
"All in all, it reminds me a lot of my homebrewed coffee porter, which is pretty damn good, but homebrew none the less..."
"D - Overall, pretty enjoyable. A little higher ABV and a thicker body would help it become a more solid porter, but still good nonetheless. Glad I got to knock Hawaii off the list!"
"Extremely drinkable and a natural extension of the coffee stout concept to the porter. I have not been very impressed by the beers of Kona brewing until I tried this beer. About as perfect as a low alcohol coffee based beer can be."
"really an excellent beer, and it would surely be a regular drinker if i lived in the paradise that is hawaii. but i don't, so i take what i can get."
"Easy, enjoyable drinking here...well worth trying."
"Drinkability - An extremly easy drinking porter, definetly recomend to coffee enthusiasts."
"A beautiful pour producing a nice thick cocoa head with a body of blackness. The smell is of roasted malt and hints of coffee. This beer seems a bit too thin for me, almost watery. A bit of sweetness in the flavor with coffee being the most dominant characteristic, but it's not robust. Leaves a nice roasted aftertaste that lingers a bit on the tongue. A nice beer, but I would like it to have a little more hop bitterness and a little more weight to the body."
"I had this beer on tap at the brewery while I was on vacation there. This has a dark ruby color which is very similar to the Black Sand Porter that Kona makes as well. Very little sunlight is able to penetrate the glass. The aroma from the pint glass is extremely powerful. As my nose approached the glass, I was got strong dark roast coffee aromas; almost like an espresso. The espresso flavor was present as well. This beer had a very heavy coffee flavor with a hint of chocolate on the back end. I love how this medium to heavy bodied beer tastes on my tongue. This is one of my favorite Kona brews. Although the bottled beer is not made at the same brewery as the kegged beer, I would highly recommend this beer to anyone that likes robust porters."
"Drinkability: Tasty and bold, the coffee stands out. Refreshing and not too heavy."
"Fairly drinkable, but I agree with another user that suggested this is a fair once-in-a-while treat."
"Opaque dark brown, not much head or lacing to speak of. Coffee is up-front in the smell and flavor, with a bit of bitter chocolate and toast in there somewhere. The coffee has a somewhat one-dimensional and cheap coffee-grounds character to it. Not much hop presence, but it's hard to compete with the 8 malts apparently used to brew this. Medium bodied and moderately carbonated, pretty flavorful for 5.4% abv, and fairly drinkable. Not a bad beer by any means, but not terribly interesting. There are far better coffee beers out there."
"This is very drinkable, yet with the complex flavors one could finish up after just one. It's very east to slowly savor every sip."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not very filling, this is a beer that I could just keep on drinking and drinking. The best comparison I can make is to Berkshire Coffeehouse Porter, which I love. This beer is VERY close to it. IntriqKen is the man for throwing this one into the trade. Thanks again, Ken!"
"Thanks, boolshot, for the opportunity"
"Many thanks to IntriqKen. Prosit. MK"
"Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and very smooth. Not too bad overall, in fact, pretty enjoyable, although I was hoping for a more unique porter here."
"Overall, a good beer that is quite drinkable. Not the best porter, but good to sit around and chitchat."
"This is a pretty good beer, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it great. I would definitely try it again, and have done so on-tap at the Viking."
"I really like the creamy mouthfeel on this beer, it makes it so smooth and drinkable and really helps to smooth out the harsher coffee notes that could have otherwise dominated the flavor profile. I could definitely drink a few of these in an evening, but I wonder if I would be too wired to go to sleep."
"Drinks okay, lacking some style points that prevent this from being a slightly better than a middle of the road porter. Was hoping for more from an old friend from the islands. Still not a bad breakfast or dessert beer"
"Picked up a six-pack from Morry's of Naples in Long Beach. Poured into a pint glass from a 12 oz bottle. Very thin head with a little bit of lacing. Mild coffee aroma as expected with some sweetness behind it. Taste was coffee up front with some residual sweetness and some chocolate. This went down very smoothly. A very easy drinking porter."
"Medium body but lightly carbonated. Not too bad, kind of juicy to be honest. Not sure if i'd enjoy more than one of these. It's good but not something i'd like to drink more than one of."
"By the way, does a beer qualify as being ""from Hawaii"" if it's a known fact that they outsource alot of their capacity to Widmer Bros. here in Portland? Uncertain if this is one they brew here, but I'm wondering if I may have just drank another Oregon beer wihich happens to have a Hawaiian label."
"Get it if you see it."
"Overall, not a bad coffeee porter. It's a nice drinkable brew, but there are better coffee beers out there."
"Drinkability/Notes  Easy drinking flavor with a great mouthfeel. Pipeline Porter strikes a good balance not forcing the coffee to be the sole flavor and yet stopping it from getting lost behind the dark malts. A really tasty coffee porter, one of the best ones Ive had."
"Notes: Sign me up for a six pack a year but thats about it. This is a very smoooth porter. I thought the coffee element needed to be a stronger force and other than the chocolate side of this there is little balancing. Nothing to wipe the slate or make me want to have another pull. Plenty to chew on for a few minutes I'll get back to ya."
"Not a horrible beer, but not one that I'd seek out."
"Pours a rich, dark brown, almost black, topped by a quarter inch of khaki-colored head. Aroma of dark roasted malt, with notes of mocha and dark chocolate. Palate is dark roasted malt up front, with fresh roasted Kona coffee taking over mid-palate and dominating all the way to the lingering finish. Aftertaste is a mildly bitter acidic coffee flavor. Body is smooth and creamy on the finish. I'm not really a coffee drinker at all, but I'm a fan of this beer. Well done, Kona."
"I will try to age some but doubt it will hold up well...still I would like to enjoy these as long as I can."
"12 oz single has ""LOLO"" under the cap..Hawaian for crazy! Nice chocolate ,aroma with black coffee hints, good,. Great looking beer dark brown almost black with a nice sized small bubbled tan head. Flavour has a good deal of the coffee flavour, good too but very little else to show, the malts seem Ok bitter but not great and there is a slight bite of hops. Pretty average for a porter on the palate, thin but not highly carbonated. Over all a nice middle of the road porter embellished well by the coffee."
"wow, this $hit kicks a$$. pours black and beautiful. tan head fades away. coffee in your face! ive always wanted to try their imperial stout; this may be as close as it get ( i missed last time i was in hawaii). pour this in the right glass and it is heaven. it is my new night cap."
"Overall impression: Nice beer - highly drinkable and interesting enough to keep coming back to."
"This is a drinkable beer. Its not real thick or heavy, and is very quaffable. The coffee angle may be a bit overdone, and could give way to some other flavors, but this is a nice porter just the same."
"Saw this one today at the store and figured I had to try a couple. Limited Release Porter made with 100% Hawaiian Kona Coffee according to the label. Poured a jet black color with a nice 1 inch beige head that receeded rapidly to nice lacing. Smell is huge, lots of coffee, hints of chocolate in the background. Taste is all coffee, tastes like porter put through a coffee filter. Just massively coffee tasting. Mouthfeel is full, creamy, nice coffee/hop bitterness in the finish. Drinkability is high, this is a tasty brew, if you see it, give it a try. I know I am gonna go back for more."
