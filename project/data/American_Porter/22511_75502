Grandiose and lovely honey presence in both the scent and flavor. Beautiful blend of flavors here. Roast and honey marry up to form a slightly sweet, chocolaty beer with just enough bittering hops to balance it all out. Silky smooth on the palate. Long lasting aftertaste. Bourbon character is subtle. This beer is all about balance. If any one ingredient stands out, it is certainly the honey. Yet another fabulous brew from Hill Farmstead.","Huhzubendah","Jan 12, 2014"

I was expecting more of a bourbon/vanilla taste and it just isn't there. Honestly I like Everett so much better than this. I've read that batch 1 blows away batch 2, so I'm not going to try to hunt down another bottle or vintage. The complexity is there, but it is a bit of a letdown in my book.

Flavor follows suite - really fine dark chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, oak, bits of minced licorice, some leather. The flavor is really nice also. Mouthfeel: this is where the beer falls apart.

4.21,-5.2,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"a really interesting beer, courtesy of one of denvers great beer men, lucky me. It pours a really dense black, midnight or darker, with essentially no carbonation, a motor oil viscosity, and just a thin film of mocha bubbles around the rim of my glass. the nose on this is heavy bourbon, oaky and charcoaly, with spice notes of cinnamon and clove, a very intense roast, and a summery sweetness amidst all the black thick stuff. the flavor, just like the nose, is bourbon first. I also get really strong cinnamon from this, although I don't think that its an ingredient. I do pick up the honey through the bitter dark malt, and its sweetness is welcomed to lighten things up a little. this is a teeth coating brew, sticky and about as thick as any ive encountered in terms of body. I really wish it had a little more carbonation. not a ton, but enough to get it moving a little bit, but I understand that a barrel can reduce that quite a bit. more would aid its drinkability, but I don't think its trying to be a session beer of course. I love the aftertaste on this, with the bourbon, vanilla, and warming alcohol. this is a beer of impressive quality and depth, not one to be consumed frequently, but one to treasure and share. hill farmstead never ceases to impress me, and although this is amazing, its a level below some of their hoppy and farmy stuff.","StonedTrippin","Apr 29, 2013"

No head on this one, just a mocha-colored cluster of bubbles around the shoulders. What an incredible nose on this beer - Dark, roasted malts as well as red wine notes, followed by bourbon and traces of ethanol at the back. Taste follows nose with the barrel qualities being less intense, thus allowing some honey and perhaps coconut to come out. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body (perhaps a little thin) and virtually still; there's also a little bit of acidity. Overall, a complex and interesting beer.

Vanilla, oak, bourbon, booze, chocolate....honey. Real nice, very aromatic even for a flat beer. Honey up front, vanilla and bourbon barrelesque flavors, a fair bit of chocolate. Very woody beer. Oily, fatty, rich and thick...but flat. A little cloying, just a little. As tasty as this beer is, and man it does taste good, it is sullied by the lack of prickly bubbles of CO2 escaping from this liquid elixer. I get it though, it is hard to bottle condition a barrel aged beer.","pmlondrigan","Jan 19, 2013"

Head retention is decent, and lacing is somewhat spotty. The nose is very chocolaty, with vanilla is a strong secondary aroma. Honey and bourbon are both barely appreciable. The flavor profile is a bit more nuanced. It opens with a rich chocolate maltiness. Slightly woody bourbon notes come next, before a brief slightly fruity honey presence (which I'm shocked manages to come through) bridges to a subtle coffee finish. Meanwhile, a vanilla sweetness lingers throughout. The body, noticeably lightened by the honey, isn't too full. That's especially good given that the beer is essentially flat. The mouthfeel is still a little bit syrupy though.I absolutely love the barrel character Hill Farmstead got into Birth of Tragedy, if they tightened up the carbonation it would probably be pushing towards my top 10 beers.","axeman9182","Jan 08, 2013"

Smells of chocolate brownie batter, coconut, light bourbon, coffee, a bit of oak tannin and some sugary sweetness to tie this all together. The flavor is sweet and chocolatey with a bit of coconut, caramel, roast, warming alcohol, tannin, and earthy hop to provide some balance. This tastes like an alcoholic mounds bar really. Medium to thick body with a non existent level of carbonation and a sweet syrupy sugary mouthfeel.

I didn't really get any barrel character at this point, interestingly.. The taste brings in more of the same, with a seeming fudge component coming in up front. Again, no real barrel character comes through to me, but it doesn't detract from the rest of the experience. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly chewy feel. Overall, a very nice, rich porter. I was a little disappointed to not really get any barrel out of this thing, but it's still pretty damn good.

Subtle yet fantastic nose- must allow it to decant a little bit. Morphs to melted dark chocolate bar. Taste....wow. Very silky, soft, almost like drinking super dark chocolate milkshake. Wild palate. Hilariously soft- almost impossibly soft. Muted bourbon spice, buttery dark chocolate ganache, true French truffles melting. In the finish is mild barrel character. Palate is 6/5. I can see all those people at Dark Lord Day pooping in Port-A-Potties and reeking of BO waiting for 8 hours to try a beer that they think will taste like Hill Farmstead Birth of Tragedy, but sadly is Dark Lord.

The nose on this thing is out of this world, with plenty of bold aromas and a fantastic balance between the base beer and adjuncts on the one hand, and the barrel on the other. The taste is also fantastic, but the barrel pushes the balance just a touch off center. In the end, this is a phenomenal brew and is another chapter in the brilliant imperial porters that Hill Farmstead seems to be brewing up. I would more than love to have this again at some point. Thanks again jbeatty. Whole-heartedly recommended.","Jeffo","Feb 06, 2012"

The taste of the beer had some interesting transitions to it, the beer was sweet up front with some nice bourbon vanilla flavors that got a little funky in the aftertaste. The honey didn't really come through too well but the coffee notes were a good bittering agent here. The mouthfeel was of a typical porter but it was on the fence with a stout. Overall I liked it quite a bit. I would enjoy this one again.","Knapp85","Feb 05, 2012"

Taste is excellent, a great mix of bourbon, oak, coffee and chocolate, the coffee stands out the most but doesn't take over the flavor, very smooth and incredibly easy to drink for such a big. Mouthfeel is a little thin for the style and it's a bit low on the carbonation, but it doesn't really bring down the experience of drinking the beer. Overall, this is an outstanding tasting beer, the only detractors are the mouthfeel and appearance, but pretty great overall.","starrdogg","Jan 19, 2012"

4.04,-9,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Good stuff but the lack of carbonation always takes away from these strong barrel aged beers for me. Love the oak and whiskey use but the spices combine in a strange way to me.","cbutova","Jan 01, 2012"
4.22,-5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"D - I liked this beer quite a bit, but I think I prefer the base beer more, as I like the interesting mix of adjuncts and malt flavors and some of that is masked by the barrel-aging. Still, this is a high-quality and well-crafted beer that is well worth seeking out - but did anyone expect anything less from Hill Farmstead?","MasterSki","Jan 01, 2012"

Some coffee there as well. Flavor integrates bourbon and chocolate quite well. Nicely done, but nothing to really bring it over the top. Mouthfeel is ultra smooth without any trace of alcohol. Fantastic barrel usage, but lacking the final oomph to really make it world class. Still, a great beer.","Thorpe429","Dec 11, 2011"
4.62,4.1,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Thanks Robert! Pours black with a medium, sticky mocha foam head. Nose is roasted malt, lightly charred, with a strange sweet liquor that's pretty interesting, blackberry like. Light coffee and bourbon, vanilla. Pretty tight and integrated with that weird spirit edge. Mouth is pretty thin, opens with dry cocoa powder, light char, unfolding into vanilla, this very unique fruity liquor quality, and a long finish with alcohol and vanilla. Soft up front with a sharp dark fruit quality as it lingers. Very unique brew here, the barrel treatment is awesome.","JAXSON","Dec 10, 2011"
