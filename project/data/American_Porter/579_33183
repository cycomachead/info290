3.56,-6.3,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I love getting a big, quick pour going, especially with the darker beers since the pseudo-cascade is much more visible. This settled into two fingers of thick, rocky, deep-tan head with good retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown (SRM = 44), allowing zero light penetration. Nose had the deep roastiness of coffee, especially my morning brew, which is not for the faint of heart, along with a dark chocolate bitter-sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was definitely of coffee and some dark chocolate. Man, if you like coffee, you will like this, but it was pretty intense. Finish was bitter and dry and I began to contemplate when I would drink something like this. It might go well with dessert, especially in lieu of coffee. It just seemed like more of a novelty than an everyday beer to me.","woodychandler","Jul 14, 2014"

Scents of roast malt, faint roasted coffee and dark cocoa. A typical porter aroma, with a bit more coffee than usual for the style because of the addition of Kona coffee. The flavor follows the aroma. Roast malt, black coffee, toasted malt and some slight nutty flavors with a roasted, bitter finish and aftertaste. The coffee is a bit more noticeable as the beer warms, and adds to the typical porter flavors, though this is still very much on the lighter side of dark in the intensity of it's flavors. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with moderate-high carbonation and a smooth, slightly watery feel. It's nice and easy to drink, but maybe a tad too carbonated and watery for my mouth. Overall this is a pretty good porter, the coffee definitely adds to the porter base, but it has a few small flaws and there are better porters out there.","Auraan","Nov 09, 2013"

3.9,2.6,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 8/14/2013. Pours crystal clear nearly opaque reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, nuttiness, biscuit, light roast, light floral, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and coffee notes; with good strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, nuttiness, biscuit, light roast, light floral, and toasted earthiness. Light floral/coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light roast, and light nuttiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors with coffee; with nice robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice coffee porter! All around good balance and complexity of malt and coffee flavors; with good robustness and very smooth drinking. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 10, 2013"

3.84,1.1,3.5,3.75,4,3.25,4,"I have been wanting to taste more from Kona Brewing for a while, ever since I tasted the excellent Fire Rock Pale Ale. I finally got around to it... This porter is an appropriate dark shade of brown, nearly opaque, with a bubbly head, similar to Cola. The head diminishes to barely cover the top of the beer after a few minutes. There's some remnants that cling to the side of the glass, but not much. The aroma is very pleasing and fresh - like a cafe mocha topped with whipped cream. The taste trumps the aroma... the 100% Kona coffee flavor is one of the most distinct in any beer I have ever tasted! It's quite toasty and towards the tail end of the flavor there's a tiny hint of hops. The beer is very light, borderline watery. The taste lingers for a few seconds in the finish but disappears in a dry fade. In short, it tastes similar to a lightly sweetened iced coffee. Despite some of the negative sounding things in the review, I really like this and will definitely be buying it regularly! I like to always have a beer around that is satisfying, yet somewhat low calorie. This fits that bill perfectly, with the added bonus of the gourmet coffee aspect.","Neorebel","Feb 11, 2013"

The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, though it's a bit on the thin side, this is a highly enjoyable coffee-forward porter. Good times.","TMoney2591","Feb 01, 2013"

Flavour has some creamy and light coffee notes as the mainstay, minimal roastiness. Light caramel and a bit of lactic sourness. Coffee again in the finish, but not in large amounts. Lightly roasty and bitter finish. Body is disappointingly thin for my liking, medium to thin with a light medium carbonation.

The Pipeline Porter is brewed with coffee. My preference would be to have a Porter, then let me add coffee to my liking (or not). So you may like this Porter, but due to the strong coffee properties, it does not get high marks from me. The color is black, the head is thin, offwhite and fades quickly. Aroma is primarily coffee, with some roasted malt backing it up. Flavor is the same, lots of coffee and big roasted malt. There may be a great porter hidden under all of the coffee flavor, but I just cannot tell.","iSip","Nov 22, 2011"

The smell is what throws it off, with the roasted malts being overpowered by what appears to be pineapple; there are definitely strong fruit aromas present, and perhaps a touch of coconut. Weird. Tastes exteremely sweet for a porter, obscuring everything else. Lots of fruit coming through in front of the roasted malt, tinge of caramel, and grassy hops. Kind of tastes like an over-grilled pineapple for lack of a better comparison. The extreme sugar presence is a bit overwhelming in the mouth, but otherwise it has a decent mouthfeel. I would choose other, more traditional porters over this, though it certainly is a unique offering that should probably be tried once just in case it does appeal to your tastes.","eclipse54","Jul 14, 2011"

Very enjoyable taste. Mild, but well done. Definitely taste the roasted kona coffee beans which highlight the flavor profile. A little chocolate sweetness and a tad bit of hop crispness.

The firs one is a smokey porter with a hint of sweetness, the second one is a kona coffee which is mild but then it finishes with that all too famillar cold coffee bitter finish, which doesn't seem to go with porter, overall it seems it's just not the right kind of coffee for this kind of drink as something a bit boulder would probably give it a richer coffee taste and less of that finish.

This one has an opaque dark brown color with a lighter brown glow around the edges and a thin, creamy tan head. The aroma is a mild combination of a light caramel malt sweetness with a smooth coffee finish. The flavor is likewise smooth and subtle, with a nutty sweetness from the roasted malts, and the coffee flavor being noticeable but mellow, much like the 100% Kona coffees I had been tasting around the island. The texture is smooth, creamy, and again quite mild. Overall, this one is smooth, easy, and relaxed with just enough intrigue from the local coffee to make me want to buy more of this porter when I get back home.","devilben02","Aug 03, 2010"

A bit of hop flavour towards the end. Short linger of roast, malt, and fruity hops. Smooth, well integrated carbonation made up of fine bubbles.

The flavor has a little more depth than the aroma, with nice coffee notes initially, followed by some unsweetened cocoa, a little rye bread, brown sugar, fruity esters, and a little charcoal. The mouthfeel is smooth and rich, and drinkability is excellent for a coffee beer. Very solid beer, but I fear the age on this one (I believe it's out of season by a couple months) hasn't been particularly kind and decreased the complexity and intensity of flavors a good deal.

Taste has more coffee, again kept in check throughout, and some light milk chocolate. Mouthfeel is on the light side, and really very drinkable.

Turns out to be a very flavorful Porter without going extreme on the gravities. The beer begins convincing enough with a brown appearance and moderate head formation / retention-- light on the lacing. Firm aromas of chocolate malts and nutty coffee dominate the beer, with only a light detection of piney hops hiding closely behind. Flavors prefer the cocoa and coffee as well, giving the beer a rich maltiness, medium nuttiness with vanilla and toasty notes throughout. The hops balance well but don't interfere much with the delicate Porter / Brown Ale balance. The beer is silky smooth to the palate in a similar manner as an Oatmeal Stout.

The sweetness isn't particularly cloying for the flavor of the beer, but it's still prevalent and a bit unbalanced.

It doesn't smell like a sharp bitter coffee, and seems to err more towards a rich creaminess, accented with caramel and hazelnut. The flavour picks up on all of this, and revels in a smooth coffee creaminess, followed by a slightly sweet, nutty long finish. Very light carbonation and a perfect body for a porter, combined with what I have already mentioned, makes this a very drinkable proposition.","bobsy","Jan 28, 2008"

Mouthfeel would be more appropriate for a higher gravity, higher alcohol brew, but it goes down smooth enough. Just a little big for a warm Hawaii afternoon. I'd like to try this on tap soon and see if my memories of the tap version (brewed on the big island) being drier and better carbonated are accurate...

Head retention was decent and some thick lace was left on the glass. Smell: A very pronounced roasted coffee aroma filled my nose, followed by some sweet chocolate notes. Smell was split between bitter and sweet. Taste: bitter rich coffee, smokey roasted malt, and a small hop bite mixed with more coffee in the finish. Pretty smooth and clean porter.

3.28,-13.7,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Opaque dark brown, not much head or lacing to speak of. Coffee is up-front in the smell and flavor, with a bit of bitter chocolate and toast in there somewhere. The coffee has a somewhat one-dimensional and cheap coffee-grounds character to it. Not much hop presence, but it's hard to compete with the 8 malts apparently used to brew this. Medium bodied and moderately carbonated, pretty flavorful for 5.4% abv, and fairly drinkable. Not a bad beer by any means, but not terribly interesting. There are far better coffee beers out there.","largadeer","Jan 08, 2007"
4.44,16.8,4,5,4.5,4,4,"This is very drinkable, yet with the complex flavors one could finish up after just one. It's very east to slowly savor every sip.","loving44","Dec 30, 2006"
4.84,27.4,4,5,5,4,5,"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not very filling, this is a beer that I could just keep on drinking and drinking. The best comparison I can make is to Berkshire Coffeehouse Porter, which I love. This beer is VERY close to it. IntriqKen is the man for throwing this one into the trade. Thanks again, Ken!","TheManiacalOne","Dec 29, 2006"

3.92,3.2,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"This is a pretty good beer, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it great. I would definitely try it again, and have done so on-tap at the Viking.","woemad","Dec 01, 2006"
4.2,10.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I really like the creamy mouthfeel on this beer, it makes it so smooth and drinkable and really helps to smooth out the harsher coffee notes that could have otherwise dominated the flavor profile. I could definitely drink a few of these in an evening, but I wonder if I would be too wired to go to sleep.","Gueuzedude","Nov 30, 2006"
3.98,4.7,2,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Drinks okay, lacking some style points that prevent this from being a slightly better than a middle of the road porter. Was hoping for more from an old friend from the islands. Still not a bad breakfast or dessert beer","russpowell","Nov 21, 2006"
4.27,12.4,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Picked up a six-pack from Morry's of Naples in Long Beach. Poured into a pint glass from a 12 oz bottle. Very thin head with a little bit of lacing. Mild coffee aroma as expected with some sweetness behind it. Taste was coffee up front with some residual sweetness and some chocolate. This went down very smoothly. A very easy drinking porter.","rgrace99","Nov 20, 2006"
3.23,-15,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"Medium body but lightly carbonated. Not too bad, kind of juicy to be honest. Not sure if i'd enjoy more than one of these. It's good but not something i'd like to drink more than one of.","trep","Nov 19, 2006"
3.72,-2.1,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"By the way, does a beer qualify as being ""from Hawaii"" if it's a known fact that they outsource alot of their capacity to Widmer Bros. here in Portland? Uncertain if this is one they brew here, but I'm wondering if I may have just drank another Oregon beer wihich happens to have a Hawaiian label.","msubulldog25","Nov 14, 2006"

4.29,12.9,3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability/Notes  Easy drinking flavor with a great mouthfeel. Pipeline Porter strikes a good balance not forcing the coffee to be the sole flavor and yet stopping it from getting lost behind the dark malts. A really tasty coffee porter, one of the best ones Ive had.","OldSock","Nov 11, 2006"
3.5,-7.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,3,"Notes: Sign me up for a six pack a year but thats about it. This is a very smoooth porter. I thought the coffee element needed to be a stronger force and other than the chocolate side of this there is little balancing. Nothing to wipe the slate or make me want to have another pull. Plenty to chew on for a few minutes I'll get back to ya.","DogFood11","Nov 01, 2006"

3.78,-0.5,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours a rich, dark brown, almost black, topped by a quarter inch of khaki-colored head. Aroma of dark roasted malt, with notes of mocha and dark chocolate. Palate is dark roasted malt up front, with fresh roasted Kona coffee taking over mid-palate and dominating all the way to the lingering finish. Aftertaste is a mildly bitter acidic coffee flavor. Body is smooth and creamy on the finish. I'm not really a coffee drinker at all, but I'm a fan of this beer. Well done, Kona.","ElGordo","Oct 29, 2006"

3.58,-5.8,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"12 oz single has ""LOLO"" under the cap..Hawaian for crazy! Nice chocolate ,aroma with black coffee hints, good,. Great looking beer dark brown almost black with a nice sized small bubbled tan head. Flavour has a good deal of the coffee flavour, good too but very little else to show, the malts seem Ok bitter but not great and there is a slight bite of hops. Pretty average for a porter on the palate, thin but not highly carbonated. Over all a nice middle of the road porter embellished well by the coffee.","Reidrover","Oct 25, 2006"
4.67,22.9,4.5,5,4.5,4,5,"wow, this $hit kicks a$$. pours black and beautiful. tan head fades away. coffee in your face! ive always wanted to try their imperial stout; this may be as close as it get ( i missed last time i was in hawaii). pour this in the right glass and it is heaven. it is my new night cap.","lflesh","Oct 22, 2006"

4.25,11.8,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Saw this one today at the store and figured I had to try a couple. Limited Release Porter made with 100% Hawaiian Kona Coffee according to the label. Poured a jet black color with a nice 1 inch beige head that receeded rapidly to nice lacing. Smell is huge, lots of coffee, hints of chocolate in the background. Taste is all coffee, tastes like porter put through a coffee filter. Just massively coffee tasting. Mouthfeel is full, creamy, nice coffee/hop bitterness in the finish. Drinkability is high, this is a tasty brew, if you see it, give it a try. I know I am gonna go back for more.","Iguana","Oct 11, 2006"
