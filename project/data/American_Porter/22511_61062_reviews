"Rich, but mellow. Dark in the glass -- a rich, deep brown like a cup of black coffee. (But alas, doesn't get much head and then that fades quickly.) Flavor is robust -- rich roasted grains with a touch of bitterness to finish it. But it mellows out nicely."

"Seem pretty basic to me."

"Way too roasty. Porters are a tough style for me."

"First pour is amber brown, quickly becomes almost purely opaque, dark as night. A solid 1-inch mocha head forms, featuring 100s of tiny bubbles, and while it doesn't stick around forever, it manages to retain itself quite well with lots of sticky lacing. While this should have been drunk when it was much more fresh, the nose still produces ample roast coffee & cocoa notes, leaving no doubt to the sweet nature of the brew. Flavor-wise, it features the perfect amount of sweetness, reminds me of the hint of vanilla soy from a Starbucks drink, closing in on mocha rich. Finish produces that moderately bitter coffee bite, but it all works, in fact, it's perfect. On top of all that, the mouthfeel is unparalleled for a non-BA, sub-8%, porter. Incredible beer. Quite likely the best ""regular"" porter I've ever had."
"Had a 750ml growler last Sunday filled the day before. Simply one of the best beers I've ever tasted."

"Bottled October of 2013.  Probably lost a step or two since then but still a very nice malt backbone with coffee and chocolate influence."

"I feel that great lakes makes a better porter. I do live in cleveland..."

"At Three Penny in Montpelier yesterday.  Shouldn't ask anything else from a porter.  Have had it in the past and thought it had a little too much sweetness, but yesterday they nailed it."

"Such a mindblowing porter. Dark black with a great lacing, strong aromas of coffee and earthy hop bitterness, lots of grapefruit citrus. Taste shows cranberry, dark malts and a really robust dark malt profile, smooth coffee and dark chocolate provoke, a gentle carbonation from the growler. A lingering finish with citrus rind, piny forest with a herbal edge. Very full body with a really rich creamy mouthfeel but also a quite assertive bitterness. Espresso, licorice, black molasses, grapefruit citrus, smoky woody character matched by a creamy body and an upfront bitterness. A very flavourful porter, and matched by its great body and balance, delicious and certainly of the most aromatic and well made porters I've tried."
"This bottle was infected. It poured like maple syrup, and was the slimiest, sludgy beer I've ever tasted. Will have to revisit when I get a non-infected bottle."

"Bottle.  Dark brown with a mocha head.  Nice roasted malt aromas.  Easy drinking with a really good mouthfeel and body.  Rich roasted malt notes with mellow caramel, chocolate, toffee, and expresso undertones.  Honestly, I prefer an imperial stout to a porter 99 out of 100 times.  However, this is a very fine ale and an exception to the rule.  One quick side note, this bottle had a bit of age on it so the hop characteristics were diminished.  This is one HF beer that lives up to the hype..."

"O- So much great flavor going on here. It's too bad this is a hard one to get. Vermonters are so damn lucky. Totally enjoyed it, though it seemed to be less a porter than RIS."
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown/black pour with head reducing to ring of lacing. Sweet, roasty malts, chocolate, coffee, a hint of dark fruit and slightly tart. Finishes with some bitter hop presence. The balance of sweetness, bitterness, tartness and richness of flavor pushes my buttons in the right way. Creamy, viscous and oily mouthfeel but not thick. Very easy drinking. A fine fine porter and an awesome beer. Love it."

"Friend picked this up at the brewery for me. Poured from 750ml growler into tulip glass. Thin caramel-colored head quickly dissipated. Smell was subtle roast malt with hints of chocolate. The taste in awesome... decadently sweet chocolate with balanced flavor from the roast malts. The columbus hops also keep the chocolate sweetness from being too overpowering. Easily my favorite porter."

"O: a growler filled 5 days ago, held up perfectly....wonderful roasty and malty flavors come through throughout....one of, if not the most balanced and well crafter American porters ever!"
""
""
""
"Thanks to Ineedabeerhere for sharing his VT booty. Pours one shade shy of black. Nose is roasty and chocolatey with a hint of lactose. Taste follows nose with a slight smokiness and a light hops bittering at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an even carbonation and a slightly silky finish. Overall, an amazing porter with a great balance and flavor profile. A wonderful American porter."

"Can't wait to head up to Hill Farmstead and get myself a growler of Everett!"

"Overall: My first Hill Farmstead beer and I'm not disappointed. This is definitely an excellent porter, though it's not so much better than some of it's easier to obtain counterparts that it warrants going to great lengths to obtain."

"I snagged a growler of this from the tap room during their anniversary party. Thick, smooth and creamy, Everett is an easy drinking porter. It doesn't have an overwhelming alcohol taste which is good if you plan to drink multiple glasses -- with a slightly bitter taste, this brew is roasty, with a hint of lingering chocolate notes."
""
""
""
"Excellent version of a porter. Bittersweet chocolate, roast and coffee flavors abound. Mouthfeel is just right for style, not super full, but distinguishable from a stout. My second experience with a Hill Farmstead beer, first being Double Citra. Can say I've never been disappointed yet. Wonderful beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall this is one of the best porters I have had. This is a new ""gold standard"" porter for me. It is a very smooth and well balanced beer that doesn't really have anything aggressive, experimental, or over the top. It really shouldn't be anything special in theory-but the quality and class of this brew are top notch."

"The taste is pretty outstanding I would say more impressive than that it just oozes the malt flavor with low roast and subtle caramel in the background with a light spice and very mild alcohol with sligth dark cocoa flavor as it finishes. Overall this is one of my favorites of this style and in the realm of all-time-favorite beers for me, exceptional in every way."
""
"My second time having Everett, but this time I was sitting in a pub with time to kill, and time to fully enjoy this Best Porter Ever beer. Before I was hustling around the Boston Extreme Beerfest from one station to the next and did really get the chance to savor all that this beer has to offer. It is AWESOME!!!"

"Hill Farmstead!!!! Absolutely killing the top 250 list.. Their beers are riddling all over the top of this list.. This Porter beer has a dark tan color with a coffee bean type smell to it... Smooth .. Great taste it has.. They brew such fresh beer.. Not huge on Porter beers but Farmstead is soooo consistent on their great brewing.. You can't go wrong with this beer.."
"Overall, an amazing beer. By no means is this to style, much to strong and much to different, but it is one of the most delicious dark beers I have ever tasted. It is very much like a strong Doppelbock hybridized with a Robust Porter. The flavors are soft and rich, and the bitterness and mouthfeel provide perfect balance. Hill Farmstead has blown me away."

"Thanks csustar001 for the trade! Pours black with a quickly dissipating mocha head and decent lacing. Aroma full of coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malts with just a hint of hops. As far as taste goes, this is the most flavorful porter I've ever had! Chocolate, coffee, licorice, cinnamon, stone fruits, vanilla, just outstanding! Medium bodied with light carbonation. Super smooth and easy drinking. Overall, hype or no, this is the finest porter out there!"
""
""
""
""
"All in all this is the best porter I've ever had. Can only imaging how off the charts this would be BBA. It almost reminds me of a well aged founders imperial stout lite (highest compliment I can give to a straight stout/porter as aged it's my favorite RIS). My first ever offering from HF and it did not disappoint."
""
""
""
"O- A terrific brew, almost perfect for a porter. Highly highly recommended."

"Overall this is exceptional. Is there a better beer out there in this style? Yes there is because I’ve had several other Hill Farmstead and Cigar City but my word this is good. There isn’t a bad thing that I can say about it. Drool. I wish I could get this year round. What a perfect beer. Thanks Shaun!"
""
"Pour is dark brown, almost black, with a thin coffee brown ring. Nose is roasted barley, cocoa, hint of roasted coffee and a bit dusty. Taste has more malt sweetness, lightly roasted barley with strong cocoa, coffee lingers in finish. Full bodies, smooth and creamy with strong carbonation. There is more malt sweetness in the taste, towards the back of the palate adding some nice depth."

"Not 100% sure, but I believe it retails for about $8 for 22oz bomber."
"22 oz. Bomber. American Porter. 7.5 ABV. Jet Black with a hazelnut cream head. Solid malt nose with heavy dark chocolate and medium roasted coffee smell with a sugary sweet end. Almost a sugar in the raw smell. Taste is magnificent. All of the smells are present in the flavor. Light to no carbonation. Rich smooth feel with an even smoother finish. Aftertaste is an exquisite mocha coffee like blend. This beer smacks me in the face with how good it is. My brother in law ThreeLions introduced me to this. It is certainly my favorite beer in this style and might be my favorite beer that I have ever tried."

"Overall this was the best damn porter I've ever had!"
""
"Overall- Sitting here on a very cold snowy day, this is exactly the beer I was looking for. This will keep you warm in the darkest nights. Quite incredible and hands down the best porter I've ever had."
"OVERALL: This is phenomenal. An exceptional beer that really crosses the boundaries between porter and stout, and I'd probably put it in the later category if pushed. Lots of great flavors and aromas with a solid, creamy feel to support it all. Something worth seeking out if you can. Thanks again Rutager. Highly recommended."

"This is one beer that I've been trying to get my hands on for a while after trying it in line at a bottle release. Thanks to the CCB Brewpub for giving me that chance. It lives up to its reputation. An extremely well made Porter from Vermont. Would I drink it again? I sure would! In fact, I ordered another glass."

"This beer is a dilemma for me. It drinks gorgeously, as well as some aged 10% imperial stouts. The body, robust flavors, and beautiful melding of those flavors is extremely impressive for 7.5% ABV. However, that is in a vacuum. The beer in the end is trapped in a weird space between lower ABV porters and big robust drinking imperial stouts."
"First sip, wow! What a sensation. Smooth, rich, intense deep malty, chocolate sweet , coffee, delicious. Very smooth start and finish. Glides across your tongue, very drinkable. Waiter, please bring me more , more , more!"

"O- This is my first HF beer and I was weary of all of the hype, but this was an awesome porter. I had a growler and it had lost some carbonation, so I’d love to try the bottled version. Nontheless, this was a great intro to HF and I look forward to trying more."

"Everett is a damn fine porter from Hill Farmstead. There's a good depth of flavor and the body is spot on. I wish the nose was a little more expressive but that's just me being picky. While I thoroughly enjoy this porter, and would drink it again, I think I'd reach for either Revolution's or Founder's versions first. Six packs help. Thanks again for the sample, Ryan, appreciated!"

"I have never been as big a fan as hill farmstead as others. Granted I have only had about five of there beers. I have never been blown away by any of them. And a couple I have had I think are actually poor beers. The Everett however is a decent porter. There are definitely better porters out there, but this one does the trick. Nothing special at all."

"Pours pitch black with nice tan head, nice lacing left behind. Nose is robust and smokey with notes of chocolate, cream, oats, and smoke. Taste is roasty up front. Roast and chocolate are followed up by some earthy hop notes. Nicely balanced notes here, spot on for the style. Mouthfeel is moderate with appropriate carbonation. Delicious porter, well worth a try."

"Overall: I recently wrote a not-very-nice review about Hill Farmstead's Edward, but I think the Everett is pretty good. It is amazingly refreshing, with crisp flavors that are in no way cloying."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is, by far, the best porter or stout I've ever had the pleasure of trying and I suspect it's up there on all counts. This was the first non-hoppy beer from Hill that I got to try on tap back in the winter at Parker Pie Co., in West Glover, Vt., and did it blow me away. Execution down to a minute detail as has become the trend from Hill. Try it if you can."
"Yes, please."
"I wish the mouthfeel was a bit thicker or a bit more carbonated. Other than that though, no real complaints. A truly impressive porter that lived up to its reputation."

"Best American porter I've ever had. It's the best in the style, no question which is why I give it a 5 overall. Hill Farmstead seems to really define the best of the styles I've had so far, especially pale ales and porters. I'm looking forward to trying some of their saisons and stouts, if I ever get my hands on some!"

"O: I wanted to make my first review Everett because it is my favorite ""shelf"" beer. I can't imagine a more perfect representation of the style. If only Shaun would can this ( I know, it'll never happen.) Seek this beer out whenever it is available. It's not as hyped as the Saisons and limited stuff, but its worth it."
""
""
""
"D: nice to see an American porter on the prestigious top 250 list, especially this high. very tasty shit. certainly one of the best porters I have had, however this mouthfeel and flavor is making me think more stout-side than porter-side. regardless, go get some."

"Black in color with a dark, tan head, 1.5 fingers in height. Bittersweet chocolate on the nose, hint of coffee, then sweeter milk chocolate. Super thick and smooth on the palate with loads of chocolate malt, it’s sweet up front with a bittersweet finish. There is substantial lacing on the glass. Coffee flavors are very present, even though no coffee was used. At 7.5%, the alcohol is well-hidden. I think I am drinking this too fast, - it’s that good. This beer has incredible body for a porter and has an almost oily quality…it could easily pass for a stout. The bitterness from the chocolate malts and Columbus hops really gives it its character. This is an intense porter, but everything comes together magically and produces one of the best porters I've had to date."

"Overall: This is by far the best porter I have ever had in my beer drinking life. I am truly unsure if I'll ever have one that can even contend with this. The smell of brewed coffee along with the smokiness that comes through when I drink this just make Everett an absolute treat to taste. I only bought 2 bottles at Hill Farmstead and right now I am kicking myself for not grabbing at least 2 more. What an amazing beer. Awesome job, Shaun Hill and co.!!"

"O-A beautifully done Porter. Highly drinkable even on this warm summer night. Have had this on tap once before and it was great and having this in a bottle does not disappoint. Wish I had another one to age for 6 months to see the subtle changes that would develop. I have to keep my eye open for the barrel aged version."
""
""
"More dark chocolate, vanilla and dark malty notes. Densely flavorful and super smooth. Finishes with a quite dry flourish. All star porter. Well worth seeking out."
"The depth of flavor that this beer offers without using additives is world class. It is truly a world class porter. The mouthfeel and body of this beer distinguishes itself as a true porter with the proper viscosity. So much roast that you get all the coffee you want without the bitterness or burnt taste. There is some chocolate/sweetness that balances the whole beer out as well. Truly a delight and the best porter I've had."
"Overall: This is an excellent porter - perhaps the best ""standard"" for the porter style that I have had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: Spectacular to say the least. This porter is absurdly complex, impressively balanced and just a delight to drink. Easily the best Porter I've tried to date and one of the more impressive beers from Hill Farmstead. For a beer that doesn't rely on the crutch of barrel aging or adjuncts, this is quite the experience."
"Overall: Very nice porter, a flavor bomb, one of the best I've sampled."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its aroma and its flavoring. The nose gives roasty malts and robustness off the bat, with the taste following suite wonderfully. The latter actually was much more rich than expected, with toffees and caramels giving more thickness, sweetness, and flavor across the taste. This was helped along by a silky smooth feel that left the mouth coated, but also asking for more. The sip was smooth, and everything was really inviting about this beer, making it second in the line of Hill Farmstead beers that we’ve been impressed with. Fantastic for the style, deep, and contemplative."
""
""
"O-Probably my favorite porter I've had. This alone is always worth the trip to HFB"
""
""

"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Poured with a very thin light brown head that clung nicely. Color was a very very dark brown that was almost black and was completely opaque. Came out a bit on the thicker side. Aroma was slightly sweet, but a bit burnt as well. Almost like a burnt mocha with just a hint of malt. Flavor was very similar to the smell. Seemed like a roasted grain, with some sweetness from lactose. A small hint of bitter on the backend, but very balanced. Felt very good in the mouth. Coated extremely well, with a bit of tingle from carbonation. Overall a very smooth and well balanced beer Pleasant to drink, perhaps a bit to sweet to be sessionable."

"Pitch black with a massive coffee tan head that dissipates but retains well. This really looks the bollocks! Nose is roast malt, cocoa, molasses, chocolate malts Taste comprises chocolate malt, light mineral notes, cocoa powder, Medium bodied, soft carbonation, smooth and massaging on the palate."

"O: Redefines a porter for me - rarely have seen this depth of flavor in this style and really enjoyable."
""
""
""
"O: Certainly the best porter I've had... not too light, but has that easy drinking style compared to stouts, but quite full flavoured, too often porters turn out more watery as they try to get that nice drinkability but this one doesn't disappointed... not overly hoppy either, with just a lot of nice burnt/roasted malt profiles blending together... where the typical porter runs around 5% but turns out flat, HF has been able to finally build up the malt profile while raising the ABV, but without sacrificing the style and making it syrupy/sticky/stout like... love it..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: Legendary beer!"
""
"Coming to this tasting, I did not hold ""robust"" porters (Founders, Smuttynose) in high esteem, especially in comparison to Eddy Fitz and Anchor. True, those are lower ABV, but I preferred the less bitter approach taken by them. With time, however, I came to appreciate the boldness of this beer. It is very smooth, an indication of the attention to detail paid by HF. It is complex, not sure I would call it ""decadent"" in its depth though. All told, I'm not sure if this is my fave porter, but it is damn close. More impressive than Eddy FItz out of the bottle (I'd hope so, at $8 a pop)."

"I'm not sure if the ale is more of a Porter or a Stout, but style-police aside, this is a sultry and savory beer of roasted proportions that soothes the sense of taste like few can. Its remarkable drinkability would allow for a greater rate of consumption if its savory creaminess didn't act so dessert-like on the mouth."

"Overall - This is it. World's best porter, and I love porters. Hill Farmstead has it. Absolutely excellent beer."

"On tap at The Prohibition Pig. Pours a pitch black color with an inch of light brown head. Some lacing. The aroma is of roasted malts, dark chocolate and coffee. Maybe some hints of smoke. This beer has a nice roasted malts flavor with some bitter dark chocolate and coffee. Earthy with hints of smoke. Not much of an alcohol presence. Medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. Overall, damn good Porter worth seeking out."

"Nearly jet black, ring of tan head, some lace as well on the glass. Smell is a wonderful mix of roast and chocolate, coffee notes mix with hops give off a nice bittersweet presence, a little bit of liquorice, but such a rich roast that is truly lovely is right upfront the whole time. Taste Is a mix of rich dark chocolate and roasted malts, coffee and a bit of milk chocolate with a touch of anise/liquorice, moderately bitter hop bill here as well, lovely roasted finish and chocolatey aftertaste. Lightly carbonated, full bodied, good feel throughout. This is no doubt the best porter to have met my glass, an absolutely drinkable beer that I would drink as often as I am lucky to encounter it."
""
""
""
"On tap at Torst. My maiden beer there. Pours a dark brown cloudy color with a caramel colored head. Aroma of coffee, chocolate, caramel, alcohol and slight slight spice. Sweet creamy chocolate taste with coffee notes and slight spice pinch. Perhaps a slight vanilla to add silkiness. Love it. Best porter I have had. It gets as close to a stout as a porter will get without crossing the line."

"Pours dark brown color with just a small amount of tan head. The nose is full of roast and slightly sweet dark chocolate. Just a touch smokey. The smell follows the nose closely. Roasted malt bitterness with dark fruit and dark chocolate behind. Lots of roast in the finish."

"Black with a tan/brown head. Great retention and good lacing. Nose has an amazing roast character, milk chocolate and even a hint of licorice. Taste has again a phenomenal roasted malt character, some toasty notes, milk and darker chocolate and the hops are still prominent in the background. Mild acidity. Medium feel, and carbonation could be taken down a half notch. I would worship this on cask."

"If every porter tasted like this there would be a worldwide shortage of porters. Without putting it in a barrel or aging it on bamboo shoots or having ferrets poop in it - well, it's just borderline perfect. Certainly the best straight-up porter I've ever had, & a fantastic beer."

"O: This is truly one of the top porters I've ever had. Its shining points are a layered, nuanced, and shifting malt complexity and an uncommonly creamy and smooth body. Its weaknesses are none."
"Overall, a top notch porter, one of the best I've had in a while. The first Hill Farmstead beer I had was good (Holger Danske), this one is very good."
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color porter with a large brown foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of dark roasted malt with light espresso notes with some light vanilla notes. Taste is a very robust porter with quite strong roasted malt notes with a side sot of espresso and light subtle green hops. Body is super full with strong carbonation, no apparent alcohol and a nice creamy texture. Probably one of the best porter I ever had a chance to drink."
""
""
"Overall: The benchmark American porter."
""
""
"Overall, a very solid porter. My biggest complain is that it's a little over-carbonated."
""
""
""
""
"Probably on the lighter side of medium, but the good carbonation helps contribute to a slightly creamy mouthfeel. A very nicely crafted porter."
""
""
"Overall: Everett is an outstanding porter and certainly deserves its place on the top 100 list. I would kill to have this available locally - a few pints would go down wonderfully well over the course of a football game."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Just a really well balanced porter. Great example of a roasty porter. I wouldn't mind a little more chocolate on the palate but that's splitting hairs."

"O - This is the definition of what a porter is. If you had to choose a beer to define a category this is it when it comes to porters for me. Another solid brew from HF."

""
""
"Overall a world class porter!"

"If other porters even considered moving into the neighborhood, I'd be a hell of a lot more interested in the style. Then again, Everett would kick those lesser porters' asses and make them feel a fool."

"Overall: This is a fantastic beer. This is a porter but almost seems to push into coffee stout territory, and this one pretty much nails it."

"Overall, this is a phenomenal porter. I pulled some strange individual flavors out of it, but they worked together beautifully. Well balanced, easy to drink, and simply delicious; a pleasure all around."

"For a porter this is a nice looking beer. Hazelnut head that produces some sheeting and a thin coating of foam that hangs around for a little while. The aroma reminds me of coffee grounds, dark chocolate and cacao nibs. Maybe some chicory too. Overall the aroma is clean for a porter, no real hop or yeast quality. Dark chocolate, cacao, chalky. Coffee is certainly big. I look for but can not find vanilla. There is a dry bitterness associated with roast. The body is full without being sweet."
""
""
""
"Overall I tried to keep my expectations in check and started with a very critical eye but this beer delivers, this is definitely becoming a perma-want."
"Overall. A very nice porter, probably the best I've tried of the style so far."
"Overall – I am happy this is one of the “easier” to get beers from HF. I will be seeking this out in the future again for sure. An extremely well put together American Porter."
""
""
""
"O - There's some minor room for improvement, but this is still pretty easily the best straight-up porter that I've had to date. Shaun Hill is a damned wizard."
""
""
""
""
"O: a good porter, I personally would have enjoyed a bit more roast and a bit less sweetness, but that is splitting hair w/ a brew this tasty, another great one From hill farmstead, I would recommend grabbing any offering you could find from these guys."
""
""
"I've been reading a lot about Hill Farmstead, and this beer lived up to the hype. A beautiful opaque pour, with an amazing coffee colored head. This beer is big, with wonderful overtones of coffee, dark chocolate, and fresh baked bread. As I drank it and it warmed up a little, I got some subtle smokiness. This beer screams ""WELL MADE WITH INCREDIBLY HIGH QUALITY INGREDIENTS."" I cannot wait to go on a roadtrip to Vermont to try every beer they have available."
""
""
"O: damn solid all around, great example of a porter. HF doesn't disappoint."
""
"O- The keep it simple approach does work for the beer, and it is good. But I don't see this porter as mind blowing as the ratings are. It tasted pretty bland to me. I would have this again and my tastebuds could've been wrecked by this point in the day anyway."
""
"Pours a nice black with a sheet of mocha foam. Smells robust son! Chocolate, coffee, roasted barley, coffee (faint), cocoa powder, graham and more toasted malts. Flavor follows suit with a good earthy roasted character, a strong cocoa flavor, nice bits of coffee nib, and a sweetness I'm surprised at that is transient in nature and does not linger. Great flavor. Full bodied with tight and sharp carb loosely scattered, this leaves your mouth coated and satisfied, yet wanton for the next sip. This is a world class beer, and I think the best porter I've ever had. Sincerely wish I had a clone recipe."
""
""
"Tap at Capone’s and later at Eulogy for RBSG Philly 2011/Philly Beer Week. The pour is midnight with a utterly insane deep mocha head erupting and sitting still for about 30 minutes. No joke. Infinite retention and giant lace of Jesus. Nose is wet tobacco, chili pepper, hazelnut liquor similar to De Molen Heaven & Hell. Taste has some salty chocolate bacon, savory umami, deep and rich baker chocolate and spicy chili pepper. Buttery, full, De Molen imperial stout palate. Wickedly rich. Unfair to put this in the porter category. Definitely the new superlative for style."
""
"O: This is an incredibly decadent treat. Rich and creamy with great notes of roast, chocolate and espresso. This is the best porter money can buy. I will be seeking this out again, and very soon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer poured out as a deep brownish black color with a thin film on top. Not much head on there or any lacing either. The smell of the beer is a mixture or roasted and smoked malts. The taste of the beer gives off a decent flavor of smoked malt that isn't salty which is a good thing. There isn't much in the way or chocolate or other roasted flavors in this one. The mouthfeel was on the thinner side, kinda low in carbonation. Overall this beer is decent in my opinion, I'm not really a fan of smoked flavors but I think for people who are this beer is awesome for them. I was happy to have tried it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's no joke that this is hands down the best porter there is."
"I've never given out all 5's but this is as close as it gets to perfection for me. For a brewery known for its pale ales and saisons to put out a porter of this caliber... Shaun Hill is a master and Hill Farmstead may just be the best all-around brewery on the planet."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is a nice arrangement of flavor but the hops clash a bit with the roast in almost an american black ale sort of way. Also, the mineral component here was fairly aggressive throughout, id rather that not be such a significant presence in the beer if i was to have it again."

"O-fantastic Porter with great balance and flavor, best I have ever had"
""

"O: excellent beer with great characteristics, but not one I would reach for all the time. It's balanced with hoppy bitterness and the sweetness, and a great fall beer. Glad I picked up a few bottles."
"Look forward to more Hill Farmstead offerings."
""
"O - The best porter I'v ever had, easily. Which sucks considering how tough it is to get bottles of this beer. Hype and availability aside, Hill Farmstead is the real deal. Unbelievable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.5/5): With all the insanely good hoppy stuff that Hill Farmstead puts out it can be easy to overlook their ""house porter," Everett. Don't! Here is an American Porter with serious body, incredibly well balanced, deep flavors, a long finish, and a smooth finish (for when you get tired Abner's big, tropical fruit bitterness, maybe). Enjoy it with friends."
"not sure about all the hype around this one. on tap at the farmhouse tap in burlington. pours thick dark brown color, blacker than molasses, but with similar viscosity. short tan head rests atop but fades fast. it smells smokey and earthen, curious malt profile, and maybe some black pepper. its a unique aroma to say the least. the flavor is also quite different from other porters ive has, it starts kind of boozy and mellows into a rich malt roast and there is that pepper like flavor again. the finish is thin and empty in feel, but full of flavors of cocoa and tobacco. so hard to place this one. the booze is not well hidden in my opinion and it felt a bit strong. mouthfeel is right on, its bigger than a lot of porters in body, but it drinks nice and smooth, not weighty at all. it went well with the rare lamb burger, but i certainly didnt think this was the best porter ive ever had. that pepper flavor in the middle is still confusing me though... ill have to try this again in another setting."
"Great balance, flavor, and body. Very well-balanced, robust and delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Everything about this beer is outstanding. It's ostentatiously good, like the brewer is trying to embarrass everyone else-- ""See, this is how much flavor you can get out of these ingredients. Try harder everyone!"""
""
"I told myself I wouldn't be misled by the label or the brewery, but I swear, the contents support the accolades. One of the definitive standards of the style out there right now. Don't let the dirt roads deter you."
"O- this beer is damn good. One of the better porters out there for sure. If your a porter fan it doesn't get much better, this is a must. I need to try more hf. I need to try the ba version"
""
"O: Absolutely wonderful porter, especially given that its readily available at the brewery from what I hear. I could drink plenty of these and drink them often. Another stellar beer from HFS."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is creamy and rich. Certainly makes this a nice sipper for a damp and dark night. Overall, I had pretty high expectations coming into this beer as I consider the standard robust porter (i.e. non-imperialized or flavored) to be one of my favorite styles. Everett met all those expectation and exceeded them in some parts and is only going to make the 100 mile drive to the brewery all the more tempting."
"O-The balance on this beer is out of this world. Also the smoothness is wonderful."
""
"Overall, this beer was every bit worth the ""hype"". All around a solid brew."
""
"O - I could drink this beer every day no problem. It possesses all of the flavors I look for in a dark beer and the execution is nearly flawless. This deserves all of the praise it receives."
""
""
"O/D-One of the best Porters I have ever had. Magical. No gimmicks. Just a round, full-bodied treat. A stalwart of its genre."
"Overall very nice, quite drinkable with lots of great malts that taste great and make me want more with each sip. The booze is mostly hidden, and the earthy hops give just enough bitterness to prop up the malts so they can shine. Almost a perfect porter, delicious."
""
""
""
"O: This is an excellent porter; there is a ton of flavors in this beer and they all flow together well. An extremely well balanced porter, indeed."
""
""
"Bottle. Black pour with a finger of tan foam and heavy lacing. Very chocolatey aroma, light roastiness, a bit of coffee. Taste is bitter dark chocolate, roasted malt finish (burnt toast). Palate is maybe this beers strongest point, very well carbonated, pillowy with a nice lingering finish. Packe with flavors, yet unagressive and velvety. The best porter I’ve had."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. Maybe the best porter (it's really close to a milk stout in my opinion) I've ever had. It's extremely well-balanced and smooth. I'd recommend trying this one if you get a chance. I hope I'm lucky enough to get some bottles of Everett at some point."
"For the style, the feel holds up wonderfully. Velvety chewy mouth with a moderately-full heft to it. This is not an easy drinker, and that's fine by me. Holds up the decadence of the flavors perfectly. The beer is overflowing with rich, malty goodness. Roasted coffee stands out, followed by a not-unpleasant burst of charred bread. Semi-sweet chocolate, cut oats on the finish. Fantastic Porter. One of the best. I'd love to have this one again."
""
""
""
"O: This is really well done. I'm not generally a big fan of any smoke flavor, but the smokiness here is subtle and compliments rather than overpowers the other flavors. A nice touch & not enough to detract. My first Hill Farmstead brew, but I hope the first of many."
"M-very thick and viscous. very velvety and smooth and creamy. very nice."
""
""
"O: A great porter, probably the best I have had thusfar. Drinks easy with a great flavor profile. Lives up to its reputation."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I don't find this to be earth-shattering as the reviews suggest. It's still a solid and impressive beer. Yet another technical masterpiece from Hill Farmstead, but lacking in a certain refinement that their other beers have."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is perfect, straight up. It's silky smooth, a great carbonation level and a perfect balance between bitter and sweet. It's amazing the amount of flavor compact into this beer while at the same time being this smooth and drinkable. Overall this is truly a wonderful porter a great example of the style. Top notch version of an American Porter."
""
""
"O: This is awesome. I think this is a porter/stout (maybe an imperial porter if there is such a category...). Will be seeking for more of this and other beers from HF."
"I'm really curious about this beer, as it smells perfect, but the taste doesn't come close. Where's that subtle balance of sweetness and smoky roast? I still like it, but dang, if it tasted like it smells, it would probably be my all-time favorite porter."
"O - A fantastic robust porter."
""
""
"O - This is an excellent porter. Maybe the best I've had; beating out Founders Porter."
""
""
""
""
"Flavors flow freely in the taste, achieving a pleasant balance while delivering flavor. Roasty and delicious; straightforward and excellent! For a straight-up (non imperial) porter, Everett might be best-of-style. Another winner from HF!"
"This brew is literally the definition of every taste and beer component done to perfection, and balanced so nicely. This is hands down the best porter I have ever had to date. I haven't had every Porter imaginable, but this is a practicaly working definition of the ""perfect"" beer."
"Overall it's a good porter "
"Overall: This was a very good porter but I am not sure if it is world class and with how hard it is to get HF stuff not sure if it is really worth seeking out"
""
"O- This was a damn good porter. Hill Farmstead still fails to dissapoint, so far their beers have all been fantastic. I could easily drink this beer all the time. Easily one of the best porters I've had, right up there with Founders- hard to pick one, Everett might have been slightly better in my opinion. Definitely pick some up if you're ever in Vermont."
""
"Overall: A good porter indeed, mighty drinkable despite the hefty ABV. Probably better than most American Porters, but not up to the standard-bearer: Founders Porter."
"Cost: $8 for a 500 ml bottle, $8 for a 750 ml growler or $16 for a 2 liter growler (plus the deposit)."
""
"This is an exception porter! Right there with my favorite porter, V@S, minus the vanilla. I was going to say that the mouthfeel is where this really shines, but that's not fair to say as the flavor and look are absolutely amazing as well. Clearly one of the best porters made. "
"O: The best porter that I've ever had. They are generally not my style, but the great mouthfeel and complex flavor profile knocks it out of the park. Definitely one I'd like to have again."
"Overall: A great tasting porter thats very flavorful, complex, and overall a really well balanced beer in both flavor profile and aroma. Very well executed mouthfeel. This is my very first Hill Farmstead beer. All I have got to say is WOW... I am extremely impressed with this brewery based on thier execution this of beer. I can see why people talk so highly of this brewery. This is the easily the very best Porter in the world; no other porter even comes close to the bar set by Everett. Seriously!"
"This was just awesome. It's rare that some that isn't ""imperial"" gets a ratin this high, both from me and everyone else. Wonderful Hill Farmstead. Thanks for sharing egrace84."

""

"Poured from super growler (less than 5 days old) into a tulip glass. Huge thanks to fellow BeerAdvocate for going to the HF release party to pick up a growler for me. Pours dark brown with a nice one and a half finger khaki head with beautiful lacing that lasted throughout. Aromas of grain, oatmeal, coffee, and some vanilla. Flavors of grain, wood, some alcohol and chocolate. Gosh, this beer sure reminded me of Founders Porter, but only better! There are some light bitterness throughout the session. Thick bodied with good carbonation. Nice sticky mouthfeel. Though good, wasn’t world class as many beer raters gave it."
""
""
""
""
"O- A unique take on the porter with the smokiness, but the smoke presence was a bit overwhelming. Still good, but not one of my favorites from HF."
"O: An extremely well done American Porter. No crazy flavors or ingredients, but a delicious roasty character and no flaws whatsoever, just like pretty much all of Shaun's beers."
""
""
"O: Worldclass for sure. Different than other porters out there. Drinks much bigger than 7.5% ABV, but not because of booze."
"O: Certainly one of the best porters I've ever had. Fantastic flavor profile, complimented immensely by the rich mouthfeel."
""
"Everett pours a medium bodied black chocolate darkest of browns with a one finger dark beige head. It certainly looks the part. The nose is robust. There are loads of bitter chocolate, lightlly roasted coffee, and more bitter chocolate. It's vibrant for a porter. The flavors lead with bitter chocolate and tobacco with plenty of coffee roast. There's a whole lot of roast, and a whole lot of chocolate. The flavors are strong in this one. I hate using this descriptor, but the aftertaste is robust. I really enjoy this one. It's definitely a full flavor porter. Yet another nice beer from HF."
"O: If you like you Porters full of chocolate and roasted malts, this one is for you. A very well crafted Porter. 4.5"
""
"A delicious, classic, to-style porter."
""
""
""
"O: Nice, rich flavorful porter, good drinkability but I feel a bit less bitterness would make this dangerously easy drinking. Another solid offering from Hill Farmstead."
"Overall it's hard to find fault here as its extremely enjoyable. If it had more notes for earth, wood, it might be perch. Who knows, maybe that would muddle the favors. I'm being picky though as I would never turn this down. One of the best porters I've ever had."
""
"Excellent porter here. Dark brown pour with mahogany tints around the edges, nice finger-plus of fluffy tan head that receded to a thin layer, leaving nice quad-style lacing on the glass. Roasty aroma, scents of dark malts, coffee, toasted grains. Robust and hearty! The taste followed the aroma pretty spot-on, roasted dark malts, pumpernickel, smooth coffee, hearty toasted grains, and just enough brown sugar sweetness to take off whatever edge might have been caused by the dominant roastiness, without offsetting the overall equilibrium. Nice heavy-medium body, tremendously drinkable. Had to bring a 750ml growler home from the source. I don't believe a porter can get any better than this. No nonsense. Exemplary!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots and streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt and some slight cocoa and coffee aromas. Taste is much the same with a medium roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that has a really roasty flavor without being too harsh."
"O: I think I need to try more from this brewery, much more."
""
""
""
""
"growler, on tap, or in bottles, this is THE porter to compare all other porters to. Can't wait for the barrels to mature, because I can only imagine what some bourbon character could add to this beer."
""
""
"Perfect level of carbonation... enough to carry the beer without compromising the silkiness. Very well designed and executed beer."
""
"O- ok, hill farmstead is two for two with me. This is a great porter that exponentially pushes all the flavors that makes up the brew. Absolutely fantastic."
""
""
""
"One of the better porters I've had in awhile. Unless you count the BBXXIII as a true porter. . . this is a very good non bal porter."
"O-a very solid representation of the style, but not my favorite."
"O: How anti-climactic. HF's Everett is one of the biggest letdowns I've come across in some time. The rest of the tasting group bought into the hype with this and rather enjoyed it. But me....nah. It's simply a Porter."
"This is a solid porter. Not sure if it's the hop notes or the burnt caramel flavors I pick up, but it's a bit different than some other porters. Not a bad thing."
""
"O - This has good drinkability. It has great flavor and goes down easy. It has a nice balance between roasted bitterness and sweetness. Overall, I think this is a good beer and a really nice example of the style. I really enjoyed this beer, and I recommend trying it out. I would buy it again."
""
""
"This is unquestionably a robust beer. Anyone brewing a porter should use this as a baseline. Definitely try this one if you haven't already."
"Overall a tremendous beer, my first from Hill Farmstead, and certain to not be my last."
"O: All in all, this is a very good robust porter. With this type of beer you would expect a fullness with a nice roastiness. This meets and exceeds the criteria. Definitely enjoy this one if you like a nice roasty porter."

"An outstanding porter, quite easily the best I've had. While not as robust (read: bitter) as the Smuttynose Robust Porter, and better conditioned than Ed Fitz, both of which make this insanely enjoyable."

"O - Overall this is a very, very good porter. Love the vanilla and everything else that was in this porter. Could drink this stuff all day long! Easily the highlight of the night."

"Drink- ""Thats a good porter"" says GuruDel. He is the porter man and this did not dissapoint in the slightest. Very layered. Very smooth and rich. I would love this closer to CA."

"I haven't been impressed with the Hill Farmstead beers I have had so far, but this was very impressive. At this point I would say it is one of the best porters I have had."
""
""
"Update: Such a different beer from the growler I had on 3/10/12. Much more coffee and roasted qualities in the aroma. More lactose and caramel sweetness in the taste with a strong coffee presence. Very good, but I liked the bottle version I had a few months ago better."

"On-tap at the Reservoir in Waterbury, VT. This is a hell of a porter. The body is thick, like a robust porter should be, but is a pleasure to sip (though you don't have to). In addition to a big mix of cocoa and mocha grains, there are clear notes of maple syrup, molasses, and smoke. Damn, this is good. It goes above and beyond what a good porter tastes like."
""
"Overall: Very nice take on the style. I'd say it leans more English than American. Tons of chocolate and nice depth. Hill Farmstead never disapoints."
""
""
"o - Overall a great beer and porter. Looks great, has a great mouthfeel, and a wonderful nose. Not my favorite tasting porter but certainly still good, and felt like I could have drank the whole bottle myself. Another good beer from these guys; verye xcited for EBF to try some more from them."
""
""
"The beer is dark brown, verging on black, with a gargantuan, soapy, beige head that coats the tumbler with lacing. The aroma offers chocolates, roast, malt, dark chocolates, hints of coffee. Great flavor. Really smooth. Not overpowering or exceptionally bold, but rather, well balanced, easy drinking, and highly enjoyable. One of the best porters I have ever had."
""
""
"I have not tried all of the top rated porters yet, but I have enjoyed this style for a long time and would hold this out as the standard to measure other porters against. This is especially true as this is not enhanced by vanilla, coffee, maple, bacon, or other additives. Everett achieves its great flavor and complexity with just hops, malt and yeast."
""
"I couldnt believe a porter could be this amazing."
""
""
""
"This is a superb beer. I try not to give many 5's, but this deserves a great rating."
""
""
""
"Awesome porter with a rich and dark flavorful feel. More hops than I remember but that balances it nicely. Russian River is the only one off the top of my head that rewlly beats this."

"O: Goes down easy, very tasty, not too filling, well hidden kick, very good representation of style. This was a damn fine porter that I would love to have again!"
""
""
"Drinking a growler fresh from the brewery (filled today). And honestly, it's even better than I remember. I'm upping the taste from 4 to 4.5 and the feel from 4 to 4.25. This is one of the best porters I've ever had."
"Cheers!"
""
"O: Most enjoyable and just awesome! Stoked to have this as a beer that reminds me of home and the wonderful craft beer community in the States. Hill Farmstead is the real-deal and this porter shows that off quite well. Robust. Mature. And just really, really good."
""
"This is one of the sweeter porters I've tasted recently and almost tastes like a smoky chocolate stout. Really good stuff."
""
"Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, robust and chewy on the palate. Excellent example of the porter - I wish I could have this all the time."
""
"Overall: I thin i found my favorite porter. Really easy to drink, a pleasure and top notch. Grab this if you can find it."

"Overall one of the best - if not the best - porters I've ever had. This brewery is top notch - very happy I found this bottle (last one in the shop back in September)."
""
""
""
"Good Porter. Spot on for the style and I prefer the larger mouth feel of this version."
""
"O: One of the best porters I’ve had. Loved the smoky notes that accompanied the dark chocolate, and the mouthfeel was crazy soft, rich, and smooth. Thanks again for the bottle, Patrick."

"I like it. Good, robust mouthfeel."
"D - A top tier slightly assertive American Porter... True to the style with out blurring any style guideline... Excels in all facets... Highly recommended..."
"Anyone remember Carl Everett? Man, it seems like forever ago that the ChiSox won it all with that guy... Anyway, this stuff pours a rather dark black-brown topped by a healthy bit o' light sienna foam. The nose comprises mild roasted malts, toasted biscuit, cocoa, and a touch of coffee. The taste follows pretty closely, with the roast coming in darker, more charred. and the coffee, though still subdued compared to the other elements, coming in a tad darker and more acrid. Everything melds nicely, though, with nothing taking any real stage time from anything else. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and an ever-so-slightly dry finish. Overall, a very nice porter, nothing overtly extraordinary, but a tasty, enjoyable treat."
"O - Perhaps my favorite porter. At my tasting at the brewery we were each given the opportunity to double up on one of the tastings. Given the options including both James and Ephraim, I still went with Everett. It really goes to show that this beer is truly great in my mind. A huge hit from a wonderful brewery."
"The CPJ"
"O - One of the most interesting porters I have ever had. A lot of flavors and aromas not normally found in a porter as well as a body more likely to be found in a stout."
"This beer pours a dark brown to almost black color with a thick chocolate colored head. the smell is roasty and sweet with hints of cocoa and coffee. the taste is sweet malty with a hint of roastiness and coffee hints as well. the mouthfeel is a bit thicker than expected. overall this is a very good ber, but just a little to sweet for the style so thats where it lost points"
"Palate: Nearly perfect for the style. Rich without a ton of sweetness, though it's plenty malty. Roasty, bready flavors roll across the tongue first, followed by smoke and licorice, coffee, roasted nuts. Medium-full body with a bitter, toasty finish that leaves a lingering note of anise. Fantastic."
"O: Overall, I think I might have a new favorite porter. This beer is beautiful and delicious. My only real complaint is on the nose, which I wish were a bit more pronounced. Beyond that, it is great and I'd love to have regular access to this beer."
"O - Very smooth and good. enjoyable."
"This is a very drinkable, full flavored beer. Very tasty and well balanced."
"Pours a deep, dark and chunky brown color with thin but dense cap of brown head, little rings of lacing towards the top. Scent leads with dark and milk chocolate before settling into a long note of roast with some char, the end has notes of fresh ground coffee and dark fruit. Taste follows suit without being too thin or venturing into stout territory. Full flavored on the palate, equal parts chocolate and roast with background notes of coffee and fruit, little hints of spice... very well layered as each presents themselves. Medium to full bodied, good carbonation levels, a little lingering char on the palate. One of the top American Porters that strikes the right balance without encroaching too far on stout territory like many full flavored porters do."
"O - Good beer. Would like to try this from a bottle so see how that effected carbonation."
"Cheers!"
"Dark rich very dark brown body, initially overflowing head. One and a half inches retained thick light brown foamy head after several minutes.Aromas are malty, chocolate, light roast. Thick creamy mouthfeel, rich, some boozyness. Very drinkable but a sipper. Excellent porter.Thanks Steve S. who hooked me up with this and two other HF."
"4.5"
"Beer is medium to light in body, pretty sweet on the lead off but the back palate is all porter all the time. Great little beer, wonderful how the alcohol is there without the beer being boozy, sweet, strong, drinkable...nice."
"A great porter overall, this one really blurrs the line between a stout and a porter. It is not as roasty as some of the best stouts but it's close. What's impressive about this porter is the amount of coffee in the taste without a coffee infusion. Hill Farmstead brews up a dream in a bottle!!!"
"O: Of all the porters I have had this one takes the cake. If I imagine the perfect porter this would be it and if all porters were this well crafted, tasty and drinkable, porters would be among my favorite style."
"Overall this is a very good porter, I would love to have this again."
"One of the better porters I have had recently, truth be told, I'm a fan of bitter dark beers so I can see some not agreeing who like the sweeter more caramelized styles. Russian River's Porter is still perhaps the beer that I find to be my favorite representation of the style but Everett will be one I hope to drink many more times in the future. Truly delicious."
"Overall: A great porter and on of the best I've had, I look forward to trying more of Hill Farmstead beers in the future."
"O: 8/10"
"Overall this is a very good beer. I was lucky enough to get a few Hill Farmstead brews on a recent trip and so far they have stood up to their reputation. I will be making excuses to return in the near future."
"Appearance is near black with a finger of light brown head. The smell contains coffee, cocoa and some light roasted malts. While its` taste has more of those roasted malts, some flora hops, coffee again, bread and a little vanilla. MF is med-full with a dry finish to it. This is a very nice porter and worth seeking out."
"Wonderful."
"If you ever get the chance to try this, do so."
"O: Until I had this beer, I pretty much had sworn off American Porter as a style, but no more. Of course Hill Farmstead is the brewery that revived this style for me, and now I can't wait to have more. Thank you for ruining porters at the same time, because I know no other porters will be as great as this one."
"Oh dear. This is the best American porter I've had in recent memory. Pours a near black with a large mocha head with impressive lacing and retention. Aroma is complex and subtle, a blend of chocolate, roast malt, coffee, dark fruit, mild bitterness, and smoke. Flavor is similar, with roast and smoke providing a strong backbone for the sweet chocolate and dark fruit. Medium thick, with soft full bodied and soft carbonation. Edmund used to be my favorite American Porter. Now Everrett is."
"thick black as night opaque oil color with a nice two inch head that ever so slowly faded and stayed at about a half inch until the bottom. Very nice thick lace down the sides, gooey and creamy, very nice look to it. Smell took a while to warm up, at first was strong alcohol and caramel sweetness. As it warmed some more subtle smells started to come through, hints at chocolate and coffee started to overtake, and the alcohol quickly faded, leaving a very nice overall aroma. The taste followed the smell with the caramel hitting first. Nice flavors of coffee followed, maybe even a hazelnut hint in there, well rounded."
"Drinkability: Super drinkable thanks to nicely balanced flavors. I dig it more than the BA version myself."
"Overall, this is one of the best porters I've come across. For a style I don't like, this beer stands out as a delicious beverage I would be happy to drink again."
"I was aware that Shaun is a master of brewing hoppy beers but I did not realize he could also do other styles so well. This is truly a fantastic rendition of an American porter."
"O - one of the best porters I've had. So much aroma and flavor in this beer without a killer alcohol level. This is definitely a beer I'd love to have again."
"this one blew me away, I can't imagine anyone not loving this beer, search for it boys and girls its worth it"
"Deep roast, mocha and espresso notes, dark chocolate composing the core flavors of this porter. Creamy with a dry aftertaste. Mellow and moderately bitter towards the end. Relatively dry, mellow feel. Pleasantly rich dark chocolate flavors, tasty stuff, but not all that different from local favorites. Thank you Dave for sharing!"
"Absolutely Delicious."
"Aroma is dominated by deep and immersive wood char with cola caramel and licorice. Taste is more wood char, ash, mocha, and the black cookie part of an Oreo cookie. Light and delicate yet robust and flavorful. Beautifully roasty."
"""Nothing man, it's all good. Cheers!"" I lift Everett up, ching ching glasses, and finish the thick bodied porter with a smile."
"Pours a dark brown bordering on black with a tight tan head that sticks around for a while. Smells of roasted grains, coffee and chocolate, licorice and a hint of alcohol. Taste is smooth dark chocolate mixed with coffee and anise with hints of alcohol molasses and dark dried fruits. Velvety smooth creamy mouthfeel, moderate level of carbonation, medium to thick body. This is a fantastic porter! I just wish it were a little easier to come by."
"O: A fantastic Robust Porter, about as close to the ideal as it gets. Big, roasty with lots of depth and complexity, smooth, creamy, drinkable, and above all else, enjoyable."
"D - It's a reference quality robust porter. The only thing that would prevent me from consuming mass quantities is the mounting roast bitterness in the finish. Otherwise, a superb brew that I think surpasses the barrel-aged version. Who the heck said this was too thin?!"
"Thanks to Sean for this fresh growler. Nice dark/black with minimal carbonation with minimal head and nice lacing. The smell is roasty, chocolate, light buttery, syrupy light molasses or maple not sure which. The taste is thick, rich, oaky, leathery, and smoky. Great porter. Great mouthfeel and carbonation. This and Captain Lawrence porters are top of this class. I've had this in bottle and growler a few times and it never fails to impress. If you like porters, this is a must have and even better readily available."
"Damn, I can't get enough of Shaun's beers and this is another favorite of mine. Added to the website as another stellar example of the style."
"D- Overall this is my #2 Porter right now. right behind maple bacon coffee porter. This really surprized me. I knew it would be good but not this good. HAd alot of flavors but they were all balanced soo nicely. Will seek this out atleast once a year."
"D - Tasty, complex Porter with smokey, roasty and chocolatey characteristics, giving the brew tons of depth and minimal sweetness."
"For a robust porer the body seems a bit on the light side, but real nice soft carbonation. Overall this one is simply rock solid. Another well done effort from the Vermont crew. I will always look forward to any of their beers."
"Another impressive offering from Hill Farmstead. Can't wait to go back for more!"
"Medium bodied with a nice balance of roasted malt an sweet silky chocolate notes.  Bittersweet chocolate, coffee/espresso, oatmeL hazelnut and toffee. Pretty toasty but still smooth with milk chocolate notes.  Easy drinking and quaffable with a well masked ABV.  "
"This is definitely the best porter I have ever had. I knew that on the first sip. I so didn't want to buy into the hype, but this beer has it going on. This is an exceptional porter."
"Pours near black with a really nice tan/mocha head and some good lacing on the way down. The nose brings forward coffee and chocolate along with some light roasted malt character. There's a light touch of smoke in the background. The flavor is dominated by chocolate and coffee. Light smoke and sweetness with some roast there as well. Medium body with good carbonation. Nice and creamy. Alcohol is not noticeable. Really solid brew."
"Overall: An exceptional Robust Porter. Highly recommended."
"A very good beer with a very dark color with a slight carbonation creating a tannish head. The aroma of chocolate, with hints of coconut & vanilla. As a porter it has a thickness that matches many stouts. Flavors of coffee and dark chocolate. Finishes with a slight bitterness like burnt coffee. Had it at the Farmhouse Tap & Grill in Burlington, VT."
"4.5 D: This is a very good beer. It's quite robust overall, but no flavor is out of place or too strong. Really great beer that didn't need to be more than 7.5% to be delicious."
"Everett (never name your kids this) came to me looking porterish with a dark shoe shine polish brown look with blackness creeping in. A nice whisp of head up top with slotz of lace here and there. Smell is malt ridden with some smoke and coffee beans underlined with some dark fruit and peat. Taste is a robust porter, this one screams malts and shows em off to. Roasty malt, Smoky malt and probably some others. The coffee comes through and some cocco powder and even a little vanilla under all of that. This is what a porter should be, no bells and whistles. Feel was stepping up from medium and it was just dank, I cant explain it any other way. I coulda drank a shit ton of this."
"O- great porter and a stand out in its depth. I keep saying this about Shauns beers but I stand buy it, they are some amazing brews and as easy to drink as they are fun to dissect into their many pieces."
"Overall this beer reminded me of Cadillac Mountain Stout with a hint of smokiness – no bells or whistles but nearly flawless. Well worth a shot."
"A damn fine way to end the fest for me, this was my favorite of the beers I tried with an honorable mention to the Edward Pale Ale. I'd love to try this again from the bottle."
"D: Overall this is a fantastic beer and possibly better than its barrel aged counter part. Very complex but balanced flavors and when the only real flaw i found is the excessive amount of head, you have a winner. Hill Farmstead continues to impress me with each beer i try"
"O: I simply could not stop sipping this. Rarely do I encounter a beer I could not put down. This is one. Seek this out. It's a gold standard for the style."
"EDIT: Updated score based on second and third bottles."
"O: As far as porters go, I don't think I have had a better one. The mouthfeel is perfect, and the taste is out of this world. Hill Farmstead is brewing some world class beer. Get it if you can. Skal."
"Overall this beer tastes great up front but suffers from the overly sweet finish. I understand that there is supposed to be a bit of that in a porter but it goes too far. Almost milk stout like. Could use a touch more hops to even things up."
"an aggressive pour gave a nice chocolate milk colored head that vanished quick. the smell is super smokey, like a campfire. flavor was more of the same. definitely more of a smokey milk stout to me...the charred characteristics that i normally associate with a good porter are there, but much more in the backseat to the smokey chocolate milk. still an easy drinker and silky smooth. be forewarned if you aren't a fan of the smoke though. i generally agree with my scores from round one."
"This was a VERY impressive American Porter and is definitely in my top 2-3 for the style. It's a robust, complex, easy drinking, and just a flat out flavorful Hill Farmstead offering that kept me completely satisfied until I drained the last drop from my glass. This is yet another in a long line of well executed and kick ass beers from Shaun and company. Well done!"
"D - This was my first Hill Farmstead beer and they've already made me into a big fan. This porter is nicely balanced and yet very complex. Extremely smooth and highly drinkable. Looking forward to trying more from this brewery."
"D - Goes down easy, can really drink a lot of this, highly recommended."
"D: A bit too ashy to be super drinkable, but still a solid beer. Glad to have tried this."
"Growler poured into my Hill Farmstead glass... Pours a dark brown, almost black with a nice medium tan head. Good carbonation, retention is nice, no lacing... Aroma is outstanding, the epitome of what a porter should smell like, perfect coffee, a hint of alcohol, and dark fruits, simply perfect... The taste is equally perfect. Only thing that I wish it had was smoke to come to close to the Captain Lawrence Imperial Smoked porter. Roasted coffee with hints of chocolate, a slightly bitter finish. Did I say perfect?"
"D - This beer doesnt try to be anything but a phenomenal porter. Very straight forward and right on the spot. If you're reading this Shaun, great job on this one. A must-try."
"Poured from a growler on multiple occasions. Deep, rich brown/black in color with tan head that laces nicely. Finish is slightly malty and roasty. My favorite of all the HFB offerings. Its balance of subtle coffee, chocolate and roastiness makes for an amazing experience."
"A marvelous local example of the style. I don't drink as many porters as I used to but if this becomes available on tap, I expect it to become a staple of my palate in the colder months."
