"Not a porter, but a black IPA. I felt like I was tricked into buying a hoppy beer. I dumped it out, tasted like ass and undrinkable."
"Just finished the last growler of the bottom of the keg. Wonderfully hoppy aroma and flavor but no bitter aftertaste. the dry hopping really does come through. Reminds me of a delicious black IPA."
"A lot more tart and bright than I had originally expected. There was a fair amount of hops, but it was nicely balanced with a smooth tongue feel. Not too shabby."
"For a porter. This is waaaaay  too hoppy !"
""
"Lighter body for a Porter but exceptional flavor."
""

"Tan head with a near black body. The aroma is dominated by floral hops. First taste is of floral hops fading quickly to an excellent balance of roasted malts with some coffee notes. Excellent smooth mouth feel, medium body, leaves a nice aftertaste of roasted malts on the tongue. An outstanding hoppy porter."
""
"Pretty good overall. More alcohol presence on the front end than I normally  like but not overwhelming"
""
""
""
""
"Full bodied but leaves quick and clean. Medium-light carbonation. Really would have preferred a more traditional porter, but it wasn't all bad."

"It may not be appropriate to talk of Pop!ping the cap, but that is just what I did. I got carried away on my pour and following the pseudo-cascade, I got the tiniest of overflow. I also got three fingers of dense, light-tan head with good retention. I could smell the minty hops filling the room like a pleasant air freshener. Color was Dark Brown to Very Dark Brown (SRM = 27 – 34) with NE-quality clarity and cola highlights. Between the minty hops and the chocolaty malts, I thought that I was sniffing a Peppermint Patty. Here comes Trick or Treat! Mouthfeel was medium, much less carbonated than its predecessor. Taste was spot-on: minty and chocolaty, one big Yum! This was much more in alignment with what I enjoy from this style. Finish was slightly bitter, but eminently drinkable. The glass was lined with beautiful, sticky lacing and I found myself licking my chocolaty lips while gazing at it. Why must this be only a Limited Release?  Make it year-‘round!"

"A very solid black-ipa/porter.  Attractive with a nice head, hoppy and roasty aroma, easy enough to drink a couple in a sitting.  Sort of blends the styles well, with the taste being distinctively porter, but certainly with some additional hops added for good measure, and the abv tends toward ipa as well at nearly 7% (not a good or a bad thing...)"

"I wasn't as thrilled with this one, which I tend to find more around the holidays than other times of the year.  Something just seems a little off about it to me; maybe the flavor profile just doesn't work for me.  Even so, Avery still puts out a good product, so it's not a bad beer, just not my favorite."

"O - A very, very good beer, and one of the best porters I've ever had. I bought this beer from one of my favorite places because it was on sale. I was not expecting something this great for how much I paid for it, and I might go back and grab some more that were on sale."

"Pours a dark black, smells of roasted grain and hops.  Taste is roasted grain, some chocolate and coffee notes, then hops, citrusy hops that lingers.  Medium bodied and medium carbonation, pretty easy drinking.  Overall, an interesting porter, more hoppy than I expected.  Tasty and definitely worth a try."

"o: A rich and tasty porter. No doubt the name is to suggest more hops than ""foreign"" porters, and that seems confirmed by the level of bitterness."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good, but not great."
""
""
""
"Roast malt dominates, and chocolate is not as prevalent as I'd prefer. Hops clash a bit with the roastiness. Not my cup of tea. Much more of a black ipa than a porter. The char really killed it."
""
""
"O - I understand they are trying to stretch boundries, which I respect. The finish and aftertaste is slightly off, but with time I may appreciate it. Draw your own conclusions on this one."
""
"A very respectable porter that isn't overly rich in flavor or feel yet is entirely tasty and drinkable. Satisfying."
""
""
""
"This beer is suffering from a major identity crisis. It is classified here as an American black ale, the name implies that it is a porter and the label describes it as a black IPA. Whatever it is, it is a only a decent one."
""
""
""
""
"Will not buy this again."

"overall, it's good! i'm a little apprehensive in grouping Avery with sam adams but I do see a similarity in many of their beers. and I love the label on this one!!!"
"O: Easy to drink and enjoyable with a well hidden alcohol making it quite easy to enjoy. Very well balanced, I think of this more of a porter (than an American Black Ale) with some light to moderate hop presence."
""
""
"Overall, this probably isn't my cup of tea, but I'm glad to have tried it. I'll stick with porters a little on the sweeter side."
"Wow, I had high hopes for this one, and my hopes were far exceeded. This is the best Hoppy Porter/ Black IPA/ American Black Ale (whatever you wanna call it) I have ever had, easily surpassing Sublimely Self-Righteous (which is a great beer in its own right)."
""
""
""
"This beer is really interesting. A cross between a black IPA and porter. The hops in this is extremely different for the style."

"Alright, after my experience with their Mephistopheles stout, I had high hopes for this porter from the Avery brewery. It starts out decent enough with the pour-- black as night with a good head and decent retention, but then the aroma warns me of trouble ahead... Hoppy? It's just a hint of hops, but then I'm shocked by the amount of hops I taste. WTF? This just isn't what I expect from a porter, but then I tend to judge porters by Samuel Smith's Taddy Porter and this is a far cry from that. This seems to be an attempt to satisfy the American urge to hop-up everything and it leaves me feeling a little pissed off. Enjoy, hopheads... This one is for you."

"Dark brown pour with tan head and decent lacing. The nose is all roasted malt and coffee with just a hint of hops. The palate follows the nose with hints of caramel and piney hops. The chocolate and hops come on stronger as the beer warms. I really like this, I'm not a huge porter guy so the hops cutting through the finish makes this much more enjoyable"

"Home tasting, 12oz bottle into Tulip. 2/6/14."
""
""
""
""
"The first time I had this beer I was just getting into craft beer, and was a big porter/stout fan who didn't like hops very much. I went in expecting a traditional porter. I did not like this beer then. Now, several years later, knowing what to expect and with a further experienced palate, I can appreciate the well built brew that sits in front of me. Go in knowing what it is and you will probably enjoy it. Go in expecting mellow soft and roasty and you will be disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""

"Could be Avery's best?"

"Overall - I love the style, and this is a fantastic representation and at a great price point!"

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, coffee, bit of citrus. Taste is coffee, roasted malts, just a bit of hops, good flavor overall. Feels medium to full bodied in the mouth and overall, while not as hoppy as other beers of this style, is an easy drinking and enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a lovely take on the black ale style. I was a bit confused when I saw this one list ""porter"" and ""black IPA"" on the same bottle, but after tasting it, I understand. It really is a middle ground between the two."
""
"O - New World is a complex and tasty black IPA. Very good."
""
"O- The label tells you it is a Black IPA, the name is misleading unless you read the small print. I found it to be pretty good. Not quite as hoppy as some, which I find very nice. I plan on getting more. Solid Black IPA"

"The flavor is a little winey to start. Dark roast malt with a fruity flavor and lots of burnt sugar. The typical notes of chocolate and coffee. A malty sweetness that is nicely balanced by the bitter aftertaste. Just enough hops without overwhelming the roasted flavors. Tangier than most Porters. The head is quite excellent, lasting to the bottom of the tall glass."

"O - I enjoy Avery brews. Personally this isn't an ale I'd throw the 'porter' tag on by any means as its more of a traditional American Black ale. Not sure I'd even go with black ipa but it definitely had characteristics of both the porter and black ipa. For me it's quite the interesting and unique beer. Not sure what the release on this is whether it's year round or seasonal, but this was fresh and pretty enjoyable. Not something I'll crave all year long, but something that is worth picking up again. It's complexity and depth character are present and paired with some Avery class it's worth a go for anyone. It is for me anyway."
"O: Even with a few months on it, it's pretty damn good - or maybe it's pretty damn good BECAUSE it has a few months on it? Not sure. Would buy again, though; one of the more successful robust porters I've had in a while."
""
"O-This is one of the first black/dark hop-forward beers that I can recall really enjoying. I'm not sure if this brew is true to style, but I find the flavors really work with and against each other to create a drinkable, wintery, hoppy brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an impenetrable black body with a small tan head with decent retention. Aromas are predominantly roasty and sweet, big on notes of toffee and dark chocolate, lighter on notes of old coffee and charred skillet scrapings. All of these notes carry through taste-wise to the front and mid palate, which are very mocha-like, but the finish is decidedly darker and more charred, and conveys just a hint of vanilla that enchantingly lingers. Mouthfilling, smooth, if somewhat too silken for the boldness of its flavor profile (wow, that sounds snobbish). Very enjoyable . Really, this is an excellent beer."
""
"This one's nice and smooth, the body a nice, deep medium verging on full. There's a good creaminess to it that makes for easy drinking, though crispness isn't neglected."
"Overall: Pretty nice black ale. A little more hop presence like others and some creaminess would have been nice, but I'm happy overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" O: Not really a porter but rather a bit of a hybrid, hopped up ""New World Porter"". Good effort but falls short of a seamless hybridization. Does fit with BA Style = American Black Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- it's thick and malty but has a lot of hops"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, char, and some slight hop aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa powder and herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty and hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that has a nice balance between the roasty, cocoa, and hop aromas and flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
"O – A conundrum of a beer. Huge sweet/milk stout aromas, but has a nice crisp/clean taste. A unique beer. Love it."
"Overall, just not a fan of hoppy porters, but this is still incredibly well crafted. Avery never disappoint."
""
"The bottle claims ""A Pioneer Black IPA"". They're probably right. This is definitely more than a porter. The hops are really intense, but not overly bitter. The malts balance well with the hops. The overall drinkability is tremendous. I could drink a lot of this. It's definitely well worth finding and trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is apparently the ""first black IPA""... though that would be like saying Robert Johnson is the first blues guitar player. Avery was definitely way ahead of the times when they made this style however. I enjoyed this beer greatly. I am partial to hoppy dark ones, and this one is definately worth a try. I would drink it again in a heartbeat."
""
""
""
"Tasting notes would include strong dark malt, light coffee and dark chocolate. The porter was a little on the sweet side. The aroma notes featured chocolate, malt and molasses"

"O - I am not a huge fan of overly hopped up porters, but this one is not bad. For someone who enjoys the strong presence of tangy hops, this would be a good choice."
""
""
"O- Decent beer, I'm not a huge fan of hop up porters, but his one is one of the more drinkable ones I've run across, the 6.7% ABV isn't going to wreck you either."
""
""
""
"High C"
"Overall if you like Black IPA's you will like this. It's a shame it's not a touch more sweet to balance the dry hopped goodness."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this drank a bit more like a porter than a Black IPA, which worked just fine for me. An enjoyable, albeit slightly understated, hybrid."
""
""
""
""
""
"eager to try this ""new world"" take on a porter. the beer pours a dark, dark brown with a light tan head in my sam adams glass. nose hits you with roasted malts, chocolate, and toffee primarily, with lesser notes of some floral hops hiding in there. taste is malty up front, then fades into some hop bitterness; i suppose this is where the black ipa side comes out. not as rich and mouth filling as a porter - somehow i was expecting more in the department. a good brew all around, though i would say definitely more of a dry porter than a black ipa."
""
""
"Overall, while I quite liked the hop flavors in here, there simply weren’t enough of the darker, malty notes--certainly not enough to satisfy this drinker’s craving for a Black IPA. Without this label--i.e. if I were drinking this blind--the beer would actually be quite good, and I would simply assume I was partaking in a good IPA with some light touches of ash. But the contrast confuses my tongue, as does the slightly watery mouthfeel. So while there is much to appreciate in this brew, I think its labeling doesn’t work. Drink it as a straight IPA, then, and enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A hoppier porter. Nicely done and pretty good drinkability."
""
""
""
""
"O) A good, and for the most part enjoyable beer. I don't drink a lot of Porters, so it's not a style in my wheelhouse, but this kind of reminded me of a black IPA. Worth a try...."
""
"Pours a three-fingered light khaki head that fades slowly to a ring leaving a good lace. Black color, faint ruby highlights. Medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Earthy and chocolate nose and flavor is baked-burnt chocolate with lingering grapefruit hop finish. $2.45 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
""
""
"Overall: The beer is a solid, maybe a little heavy for a porter at almost 7%. Definitely worth picking one of these up."
""
"Notes: Overall it's not too bad very drinkable start to finish. Cheers."
"Poured dark brown, opaque, with a cap of tan foam. Some lacing. Smell is chocolate, roast malt, spicy, earth. Taste starts toasty, roasted elements, semi sweet chocolate, sweetness, then a heavy washing of citric and resin and earthy hop bitterness, very nice. Reminiscent of black IPA. Mouthfeel seems a bit light, and the body doesn't hold up well enough to all the flavor. Seems brightly carbonated which goes well with the hop. Finish is clean, dry and the bitterness is lingering."
""
"A good porter, the additional hop notes are very well integrated."
"O: The porter looks great in the glass. The aroma is appealing and the taste is what you would expect from a porter. Nice solid mouthfeel too."
""
""
"Overall: Liked the hop presence and chocolate sweetness. Drinkable and balanced."
"OVERALL: This porter teeters on the edge of the style almost falling into Black IPA territory, but it doesn't fall. It is still a Porter, a very American Porter, but a Porter nonetheless. the 6.7% can also sneak up on you."
""
""
"REALLY GREAT BEER"
"O: a solid porter not my favorite but still very solid..."
""
""
"Overall: while possibly misclassified, this is a very tasty beer. Mixing big hop character with roasted malts is fraught with peril, but New World Porter seems to pull it off."
""
""
"A yummy, heavily hopped porter or lightly hopped black IPA. However you want to look at it, it's a moderately hoppy black ale with an even balance of dark malt bitterness and American hop flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A nice slightly sweeter porter with a nice aroma, mouthfeel and taste. Avery did a nice job here."
""
"O. One of the best porters I have tasted. Highly recommended."
"Dark caramel pour. Easy tan head that slowly dwindled with good lacing. Dark body with noticeable red hints. Slightly sweet for a second before the bitterness and dark chocolate with a hint of coffee came through. The bitterness was long lasting. Medium mouth feel."
""
"O- good hopped up American porter. A little thin but like the drinkability."
""
""
""
"O - Solid porter. More intense roasted malt than some of my favorite porters, but still quite good."
""
"O: I thought this was an outstanding representation of the style and one of the better porters I've tried here recently. Avery continues to impress me."
""
""
"O - Overall this is good beer that I would recommend to others. It is a very unique porter and does some things I feel some people would really enjoy. Given the wide selection of craft beers at present day I feel that one could do better to find more ""classically"" defined porter."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very deep brown color with a finger's worth of head. Aroma is roasty and chocolatey with some citrus and earthy hops. The taste is very good, with a nice amount of hop flavor joining the roast party. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and fairly well carbonated, and the drinkability is good. One of the hoppier porters I've had, and went great with the beef stew I paired this with."
""
""
""
"Very smooth. Oily. Tangy. Well carbonated."
"Overall - not quite a porter, but a very nice black IPA. Flavors work well together, high drinkability – not super original or unique, but I will buy this again."
""
"i'm guessing that the lack of head and its parallel subtle watery quality to the body had something to do with a gas line malfunction/improper setting. who knows? regardless, a pretty respectable offering from Avery."
""
""
"O- Whatever it is, porter or IPA, it's great and that's what matters. I usually take away points for not being true to style, but I feel like Avery's well aware of what they've created in this case."
"So is this a porter or a black ipa? The 6 pack states it to be both. Anyways, pours a dark brown with a beige head that decides to leave before I can even put the glass down. Aroma is bold, very hoppy, I get the black ipa tag. Smells like orange coffee kind of. As much as I would hate orange coffee, I like this smell. An earthy coffee taste at first, followed by some sugar coated orange and bitter hops, closes out with some roasted malt and chocolate. Mouthfeel really works for this porter, thinnish with some decent carbonation. This is a very good porter but, I must admit, the citric component to the flavor kinda is a deal breaker for me, much in the way it is in black ipa's. Everything else about this is really good though."
"Medium mouthfeel and no real notice of the alcohol. I'm not too enamored with this beer because it doesn't do enough to be a good porter or enough to be a good black IPA."
"Overall, this beer's roastiness is almost flawless, and is very drinkable despite its pleasant dryness. The taste isn't complex, but solid."
"O: Not my cup of tea. The hops and malt do not work together in this one."
""
""
""
"O - An amazing porter. Sweet and hoppy. I love a good porter, and this is as good as it gets"
"Overall an excellent hoppy porter/black(brown) IPA."
"O: a winner in my book, it like the out of bounds stout but with more of a hoppy kick at the end i went out on a limb here andpicked up a whole sixer and im sure glad i did"

"But back to the Avery New World Porter. Porters tend to be more consistent than other styles, but the New World Porter has a slight edge. It pours with a black body, tan fluffy head and mellow aroma of malts. The flavor is very smooth throughout with a bit of bitter toward the finish. I think the New World is nicely balanced, with good Porter roast malt flavor that does not overpower, and I like the subtle hops that come through at the end. A few of these could go down on an evening when you are in the mood for a porter or a mellow stout."
""
""
""
"This is more of a black ipa than a traditional porter(although knew that before trying since it was on the bottle). Dark but not black with a lot of hops, a lot more than traditionalporters. A really solid beer from one of my favorite breweries. This is only seasonal and I will definitely look for it again."
"If you like Black IPAs, this is a must. Like I said, if you're seeking a traditional porter, you might be disappointed. But, at the end of the day, this is a pretty tasty brew."
""
""

""

"one of the most hoppy porters ive tasted. really different palate. pours a sexy black color into a wine glass, with a jovial 2 to 3 inch bone white head. smells bitter hops, coffee beans, and musty maps (ala the label). rich and smooth the taste is wayyy more hoppy than youd think, with a nice rounded chocolate malt balance. bitter as anything in the finish and butter in the mouth. this is one of avery's bolder and more memorable beers. almost too much to drink a six pack. huge flavor profile, higher abv for a porter. well done"

"12 ounce bottle, bottled 11/6/2010. Pours crystal clear dark brown color with a nice dense 2-3 fingers of tan head with amazing retention that reduces to a lacing cap. Some nice lacing clinging to the glass as well. Aromas of caramel, roasted malt, light chocolate, bread, citrus, and spicy hops. Some decent aromas with good strength. Taste of big chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, bitter coffee, molasses, light citrus, and spicy hops. Decent amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, chocolate, citrus, and spicy hops. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice and fairly creamy mouthfeel. No alcohol noticed other than a slight warming after the finish. Great balance of roasted flavors and hop character. Overall this is a very nice robust porter. I am pretty impressed on how well this has held a nice hop character after an entire year."
""
""
"Solid porter, easy to drink, but not one of the great ones."
"Overall: I think this is a great representation of an American Porter with an easily accessible price and distribution range."
"Overall, this is a solid porter, but it lacks a few qualities to make it a great porter."
"O: An excellent sipping beer, as most porters are. I found this to be a little too strong on the dark chocolate for my personal taste, but if you like dark chocolate stouts this is a serious contender."
"This pours a nice very dark brown almost black color, there are definite brown edges but its black in the center, this has a very nice foamy mocha colored head with good retention. The smells are of coco and roasted malts, gone are the hop smells mentioned in the other posts. The feel is medium. The taste is of roasted malts and hops, the hop taste and bitterness is definitely present. Overall a decent porter and one I'll try again if I can find it fresher."
"This is a very quaffable beer, which for me is a rarity with something this hoppy. It a nice brew but not sure that I'd label it a porter. Black IPA maybe?"
"Medium bodied, it's not creamy but not overly heavy."
"Overall, I really enjoy this beer. The malt presence is strong but there's still some hop presence which makes this beer incredibly easy to drink. Especially with spicy food. I'd definitely have it again."
"D/O- Whoa, wasn't expecting this at all. The hop presence took this porter to new level amongst many that taste very similar to each other. Bottle says ""A Pioneer Black IPA""...hats off to Avery. Enjoyed very much but probably wouldn't have more than one or two in an given drinking session. Thanks PTMcB!"
"O: A good outing by Avery. This is one that intro craft beer drinkers could enjoy with the moderate roasted flavor and easy drinking body. Experienced beer drinkers will take a liking to the peculiar hop flavor that rounds out each sip. Almost like licking a chocolate covered mint leaf."
"This was ok but not the most notable porter. I prefer mine a little less hopped. Maybe they should call this ""Old World Porter"" as I believe porters were more strongly hopped back in the day of British Imperialism."
"SOLID, NOT A MUST HAVE!"
"O - For a common off the shelf porter it's a better than average one, but not by much. A good beer by Avery, but they have many better ones."
"O/D-The label reads ""A pioneer black IPA"" how can you not love that. I really love this brew. I know all the ratings on Beer Advocate are subjective, but this one is supremely undervalued. I love the hop injection into this style. I am loving porters more and more, and this one just raised the bar again. Very happy to have tried this precursor to the Black IPA."
"On tap yesterday up at the Avery Tap House. I've had many, many bottles of this one, and enjoyed them all immensely, yet have never tried it on tap. I'm glad I did. Poured a dark reddish brown color, with a bit of off white head. Aromas of floral hops, roasted malt and chocolate. On the palate, this one was medium bodied, balanced and drinkable, with flavors of hops, roasted malt and chocolate."
"Over I enjoyed this. I don't know if this is supposed to be an ""American porter", or a black IPA. The bottle says ""black IPA", however it's called a porter and is listed as one on here. The taste straddles the line between the two styles, and regardless, it's enjoyable. I just wonder if the hops profile would have been more pronounced had I not let this sit in my ridge for a couple months."
"Overall a very fine beer here. A good quality well rounded session porter. I would definatly buy this again."
"The nose is a great mix of caramel and juicy, citrusy American hops. On the palate those citrusy hops are also apparent, along with a bit of a piney note and the bitterness from the hops and the beer's rich, dark, roasty malts blend together real nicely. For a beer with so much going on, and so much hoppiness, this stuff goes down real smooth. I imagine it would be a versatile food pairing beer as well thanks to its dual nature as a porter and an IPA-ish beer."
"Overall - a very good beer! Another winner from Avery."
"O- This is brewed very well and I like this new porter/ipa style. Cant say I have had anything bad from Avery. I can finish about 2 in a row. Anymore then that and the dryness gets a bit annoying."
"The liquid was almost black with red highlights and a lofty, foamy, light brown colored head. The smell is strong with piney hops, toasted caramel malt and chocolate. When you take a sip you first taste the bitter piney hops, then the roasted malt and dark choclate take over and there is a hoppy, resinous finish. It feels kind of thick with low carbonation and a lingering, dry aftertaste. I think this was one of the best black IPAs I've had (haven't tried Stone's Sublimely self righteous in awhile though) This is a ""must try."""
"Overall a nice porter, as expected from Avery, nice roasted malts, light but nice hop balance, good bitterness, almost sessionable, overall great drinking."
"Very smooth, flavor hides the ABV well. This is a great porter for those that like hops. Malty sweet yet hop variety in all the right places. Revolutionary black IPA no, good beer, yes."
"I wanna say this was brewed to commemorate the achievements of Columbus, Vespucci, and their ilk, but I somehow doubt that was the case. Oh well. It pours a dark garnet-sienna topped by a half-finger of light sandstone foam. The nose comprises light roasted malts, dark chocolate, light onion, pine, and cedar. The taste does not deviate far from the smell, though thankfully the onion has dropped out, only to be replaced by a stronger pine character and some light orange peel. The body is a light-ish medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, I don't feel the hoppy-ness really jives with the porter qualities at all. It's just kind of a sad excuse for a black IPA with a smidge more roast. Not a fan, myself."
"D: Decent enough but the hops threw me for a loop, not at all what I anticipated."
"drinkability is out of this world - the body might be a little thin but that is ok because now i can drink multiple bottles"
"Big, bold and excellent, nice job Avery!"
"I've also had this beer about 2 months ago, and it tasted like it was from another world and would have been reviewed much higher... an older bottle perhaps where the hops/burnt mellowed out? Not too sure."
"I'd recommend this porter over almost any other CO micro as a go to cheaper option."
"M/D: heavy and rough feel like it's not clean. Drinkability is ok definitely not my favorite nor will I purchase again."
" like they say, "" it's not how you start, it's how you finish."""
"lower carbonation, pretty smooth. I prefer the english style porters better, but still a quality brew."
"D-VERY surprised by this one. maybe because i was expecting a porter and got an awesome ABA or maybe because its really that good."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - As I said, very smoked. Medium bodied and dry hopped. Perfectly balanced bitterness with coffee and chocolate notes. This porter is easily drinkable and never gets old the entire way through."
"New World Porter spurts out the bottle brownish black looking quite nice in the glass. About an inch up of tannish light brown foam that's kinda full, semi stick. Smell is bright earthy hops on top of some chocollate that's more like cocco, roasted malt and a kinda English like yeast as well. Tasting this is kinda great, it exceeds expectations. Tastes of cocco, roast(slight), a nice earthy hop with some pine and semi citrus. This is a great twist black IPA porter, I can disern between the two, a great mix. Some nuts and a sharp hoppy finish. Feel is less than medium with a nice bitey carb that works. If I can find this fresh, it's good for a sixer."
"Overall, not a bad brew, but doesn't even come close to the best examples of the black ipa style (southern tier inequity, stone sublimely self-righteous ale). Would have like to see some fruitier hops, and a slightly sweeter malt character. However, i will probably get this again, if a craving for black ipa takes shape and no subsitutes are available."
"D - This has good drinkability. It goes down easy and the flavor never gets boring. It is a bit hoppier than most of the porters i've had, but I like it alot. I would definitely try this one again."
"This isnt a porter to me. When you see ""Pioneer Black IPA"" on the label everything makes more sense. Very good beer that is sessionable but maybe mislabeled. Its ok Avery I still love you."
"D- ABV is not bad and pretty much subdued with all the taste thats going on here. Pick this up if you see it."
"D - A very drinkable offering that I'm surprised doesn't get more attention. This won't be my last taste of this one."
"Drinkability -- Wow, I'm really impressed. Picked up a single on a whim and this turns out to be an exciting hoppy Porter. Assertive hoppiness and complex roast malt undertones makes for an easy sipper that shames most Black IPA's. I might even like this more than Alpha Klaus, which concerns me..."
"Aroma has a nice citrusy hop scent with a bit of coffee-like roastedness. Head was nice and foamy tan, not quite beige like some black ales have. Taste is pretty roasted but well balanced with hops. The malts don't tasted debittered so I felt like it tasted more like a porter like the name implies rather than a ""pioneer Black IPA"" as the label also states... Overall excellent full-bodied black ale with a nice coffee roasted malt flavor with just a hint of citrusy and piney hops, not too heavy which is nice for a black ale."
"D: This beer is really nicely done. The ABV would suggest a great session beer, however, the flavors are so intense that it works perfect as a sipper. I would definitely purchase again."
"On the other hand this beer would age very well. It's alcohol and antiseptic hop content give this a very decent potential lifespan. I plan to age and re-review this same six pack in a year or so."
"Bottle courtesy of the bearded beer guy. Had this beer a few times a while ago, so when I was told it turned into a hoppy porter, I was intrigued. Poured into a tulip, it pours a dark, dark brown with a thin, light tan head that dissapates quickly. Nice lacing. Lots of hops in the aroma, with pine dominating. Really good! Got some chocolate, mint and pine on the tongue. Really impressed with the mouthfeel on this one, though. Very creamy and full-bodied. Surprising for a hoppy porter! Very drinkable and enjoyable! Will pick up some more for sure!"
"The mouthfeel has small hints of carbonation and tiny bubbles which give you no problem whatsoever to have another sip. Not sure why they call it a Porter in the name and immediately on the packaging it says Black IPA, I don't get it but anyway, good job Avery. Couldn't drink these all night but a couple would be quite enjoyable."
"d - terrific porter, one of my faves."
"I poured this odd beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was black and poured a really nice head It also had great lacing. My hopes were high. The taste started off nice with a great burnt chocolate hit, however it was hopped. A hoppy porter is not my cup of beer. The beer also had a bitter finish like a Engkish Ale. I will not buy again."
"D: this is my third one, so they are doing something right. Like a roasty brown ale, with a heavy dose of hops, nice. Worth trying for a change of pace."
"Dry hopped porters, away!"
"I'm usually not a big fun of regular porters but this one won me over. A beautiful balance of taste, mouthfeel and aromas."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"It has a rich mahogany, wet leather brown. It's dark enough you can't see any light through it. The head is a creamy coco color and laced the glass fairly well as it reduced to a film over this beer. The nose isn't very pleasant at first. Some molasses notes with some burnt tobacco and grain. There are defiantly some hops and coffee notes that stick to the tongue. There is some sweet brown that show up on the second sip. The finish is long! It is longer than I would like but it's flavors change as it lingers which makes it very enjoyable. The lingering flavors make it a slow drinker."
"Lovely roasted and smoked porter with some tasty dry hoppage. Love me a good hoppy bitter porter."
"I found this an elegant well-hopped American porter that doesn't forget about drinkability."
"Overall this beer is complex and adds something new to the traditional porter with the hop aroma and flavor. I enjoyed drinking it but it doesn't exactly fit into the porter taste that I usually look for. I would drink this again."
"Pretty big, in a richness way cuts final score a tad. But the flavors are good and it's an enjoyable beer."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass after sitting out of the fridge for 15minutes. Dark amber color with lots of well retaining and laced frothy latte colored head. First smell is of hop, followed by traditional porter/dark malt smells. Medium hop bitter and dry finish are the predominant flavors, but porter malts give it a choco/coffee aspect and a good body. Definitely not what I expect in a porter, but not bad."
"Drinkable? Pretty refreshing,some sparkle and not very dense while somewhat under-sweet. While it's a "" Not - Porter"" It's still a decent drink with a tasty hops show."
"As usual a good beer from Avery, but I was a bit thrown off by the hoppy taste."
"Pours dark, almost black with at least two fingers of dark, tan head. I get some hops, chocolate and maybe some cocoa on the nose. Tastes are hops at the front, then sweet chocolate and a hop finish. The hops are there enough to notice, but their not obnoxious or like a black IPA. This beer is creamy with a great amount of carbonation. Porters are usually hit or miss with me and this one is definitely a hit. Drinkability is great Nd I could easily kill a few of these, very good beer."
"D: Goes down smoothly. Nice American Porter."
"Its name is very fitting as this is truly an American style of robust porter. The use of the higher AA% Columbus is definitely not typical in a porter although they are using Fuggle as well (I wish I knew what they were dry-hopping with). With a higher ABV the increased hop presence helps tame the sweetness of it. Excellent chocolate and caramel notes. A smooth drinking beer with high drinkability."
"I will most certanly drink this one again allthough not to often."
"A good porter, rather sweet."
"d- i wanna drink this with a huge steak, garlicky mashes potatoes and roasted asparagus, this would pair perfectly. i will definately drink this beer again."
"Another one I've been putting off but am very satisfied with."
"D - I could have a couple of these. Sitting around telling stories with friends these would go over well."
"Lots of cascade hops in this one. A real good hoppy porter. Alcohol comes off tame, the hops and carbonation make it an easier drinking porter. Still has a decent amont of chewiness to it throughout. Me likeee."
"Slightly watery mouth feel, but with a nice and crisp carbonation that encourages one to take another sip."
"Very drinkable with no alcoholic taste at all."
"When I took my first sip, I realized that the smell I couldn't place was the hops mixed with the malty esters. Lots of chocolate and a slight bit of coffee, followed by a lot of sweet hops with a little bit of citrus. Very tasty beer and very sessionable, I'll definitely seek this out again!"
"very drinkable and a very interesting take on the style. highly recommended to people looking for a hoppy porter."
"D - pass."
"D: This beer is very drinkable and can be considered sessionable. It's perfect if you want to drink a porter that has some hop flavors."
"DRY HOPPING! Want a dark, hoppy, sessionable beer? Than this is for you! A damn good porter for a hop fix, rather than a malt fix. I believe this beer fills in a good niche, and hence deserves a spot in my cupboard! I am not a man to buy packs of many beer, but this one would warrant my money! I am a horrid reviewer.. what do the hops tastes like.. err.. well... good. Its bitter than most porters, so move along if that isn't your thing."
"I really like this beer. It's not my favorite, and this is my first ""official"" review, but I could see myself enjoying more than a couple of these. It's a little fruity for a dark beer, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's not overly thick, but there is definitely enough substance to this brew to keep the beer snob inside me quite happy."
"D - You know what? I am digging this porter. I think I might even go on record and place New World Porter up there with the likes of Edmund Fitzgerald and Foothill's Peoples Porter. Yup, it's that good."
"The body is firm. Moderate amount of carbonation. Very smooth finish. Mimicking the scent, the flavors on this beer are hoppy as well. Some light roasted flavors, a bit of a chocolate powder finish. Moderate bitterness. This beer is blended well. I like that it utilizes hops and is different than many Porters in that respect, but it's not leaning towards the ""black IPA"" category. Retains plenty of characteristics of a solid Porter, with just a few minor adjustments. A nice break from the norm. Recommend."
"D: Tasty and smooth. Sharp bitter was a bit of a surprise."
"Poured a finger thick, off-white head that very slowly dissipated as the beer was consumed. The beers color comes across as a dark, dark brown, almost black. Right upfront there is a nice malty nose that is pleasant to inhale; comes up sweet. Along with the malt, there are subtle hints of burnt coffee and a little chocolate that are nicely balanced. The initial sip of malty sweetness and burnt coffee blends well together, however the slightly bitterness that lingers on the back of the tongue is not unpleasant but different. Overall a beer that I would try for a second time if I found it again."
"D- A very unique take on the style. I thoroughly enjoyed this."
"Not my favorite. Not bad."
"Drinkability: It's been about a minute since I've last seen this one around the Atlanta area. This one's a hearty porter that's a bit more hopped up than most. Certainly worth giving a bottle or pint a go."
"Quite the interesting Porter from Avery. Different from most porters I have had which are mainly Michigan brewery offerings."
"D - A little less drinkable than your average Porter, I could probably enjoy a couple pints for sure. I like the dry hop twist on this one, pretty good and worth a try. I might have this one again sometime. Recommended. Cheers!"
"D: A superb hoppy American porter to keep you from getting bored with the same old sweet or midl porters -- grabs with both serious sweetness and bitterness in one package. A really good beer from Avery."
"d - A decent porter. Thought it had a nice smell and a decent taste; would have liked a little less bitterness though. A lower level of carbonation would have helped too. Worth a try and I would give it another shot."
"Poured into a pint glass, very dark brown, nearly opaque. Tan head that was about three fingers thick and retained well. Laced well in additon. Aroma of the coffee and roasted malts primarily. Taste has the bitterness from the malts, coffee flavors primarily. Feel is full bodied with some slight crispness. Good porter from a great local brewery."
"The initial hit is the big roasty malts, with coffee and burnt toast taking the lead. This flavor is followed quickly by a big hop burst that all but erases the malt flavor. The end leaves the good flavors of both the malt and the hops, but from some reason these two flavors don't blend very well IMO. It's a nice idea to ramp up a porter with this many hops, but in this case it's kind of messy, not terrible but messy."
"D/Overall: Nothing wrong with it, but nothing to write home about. Pretty standard hopped porter. I had it for dessert, which is where it belongs."
"It has a great mouth feel, but I wouldn't say it has the best drinkability. I really like Avery, and this beer is pretty good, but not their best."
"Very drinkable for a porter. I am not a porter fan, but this is one of the best I've ever had."
"very drinkable. nice and light and never really gets boring. has enough flavor to keep you occupied. ABV is a smidge high though. not something id stock up on but a nice treat here and there."
"Had it on tap at the Mellow Mushroom. Poured a dark brown, near opaque with a smallish off white head that left a good bit of lace. Smell... hmmm, a bit of roastiness, but very heavy on the hops - citrus / pine - the bartender described it as a near Black IPA which seems fitting based on the aroma. Taste dominated by the hop profile - roasty malts seem to take the backseat, which is kind of a shame (for the style at least). Mouthfeel is a just a touch thin and not too exciting. Kind of an extreme Porter if there is such a thing.... interesting."
"This is one of those times when I can't figure out how porters and stouts differ. Judging this like a stout, it's pretty good. Not great but good. Good malty and smokey aroma and flavor. Good dark color, great mouthfee. ONe to have if you see it at your local."
"Very drinkable. I get a real dry finish from porters, maybe it's relative to the color, but that dryness coupled with the hops makes me want more & more each sip I take. It's like heroin Pringles."
"Hoppy mouthfeel with a lingering hoppy goodness on the palate. Other than that vanilla note, this drinks more like a Black IPA which is fine for me."
"An average porter with a nice, creamy taste (probably more suited for people with a bit of a sweet tooth though). The dry hopping doesn't seem to do much for this beer besides keep it from being too rich. It's probably stronger a few days after production or fresh on tap. Honestly, I'm not particularly interested in how it would taste with more noticeable hops, but it could be quite good."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable."
"One of the first porters I've had, and I was quite impressed. Definitely one to sit back and enjoy."
"Others like this beer and generally I'm a big fan of Avery; I'm just not a big fan, usually, of hoppy dark beers. There are some clashing qualities with this one. It's technically good, I guess, but aesthetically, not so hot. Served with a fine foamy light tan head and some lace. Color is a very dark mahoganey. Aroma is dark ripe fruit, hoppy, malty, roasty. Flavor's about the same. Finish ditto."
"Notes: malt is actually masked pretty well by the hops and bitterness. would have liked a more complex malt profile. pretty dry porter but not bad"
"D- There was something a little off (besides the metallic taste) that just made me say one and done. I will try this at a later date and see if I could get a better bottle."
"D - Overall, not bad, just suffers in mouth feel."
"Overall a nice porter, I was a bit surprised to see that it is 6.7%, hides the booze well."
"D: A very good porter from Avery. I enjoy hop-forward porters and stouts, and this is no exception. However, I feel the hops in this one overshadow what I perceive to be a very tasty malt complement a bit more than I'd prefer. Not exactly balanced, but I'm all for blurring the lines between porter and IPA."
"A nice twist on the style. I love the IPA edge to it. Very good, balanced and easy drinking. Will seek this out again."
"I had heard this was a hoppy porter so I picked it up. Dark brown, light tan head. Smells odd like dark malts and a bit of pine sap. The taste does have a hint of hops but its also robust but the finish is a little bitter. This porter was juts weird, I was hoping for something like alpha klaus."
"Drinkability: Wow. The alcohol is present in the taste, but it tastes so good that it's easy to drink quickly. This is a great porter, and is a perfect example of a balanced beer. No one flavor dominates, but all combine together beautifully."
"Easy to drink and quite tasty."
"D - A very hoppy roasty almost burnt tasting porter- it seems more like an American stout style wise. I like it but would prefer less hop flavor in a porter -even a robust porter. The roasted taste seems to distract slightly lowering the drinkability IMO."
"Darkest brown with ruby highlights and topped with a whipped tan head that leaves sheets of sticky lace on the glass. The smell is fantastic, rich roasty malt, chocolate and loads of fruity hops. The flavors are rich chocolate malt fresh roasted coffee and pine sappy bitter hops all in perfect harmony. Medium bodied and smooth. A big flavorful porter that suits me just fine."
"Pours pitch black with a one finger dark tan head, very nice head color, it looks pretty creamy with some big bubbles scattered throughout. Head really has no retention to speak of but leaves a nice tan cloud coating atop the beer. Smell on this one is pretty straight forward to me, lots of toasty malts and some vanilla. Some chocolate is picked up later to compliment the other scents nicely. I like how the nose is strong here too. Taste is very much like the nose, with more chocolate and less vanilla. Lots of roasted, almost burnt, malts here. Probably the first time I have ever thought of a beer as tasting burnt. It is not a bad aspect, but it is just different for me. This is pretty much just a straight up porter/stout like taste. Starts tasting a lot more chocolatey and a bit like alcohol as it warms. The mouthfeel is light-moderate bodied with no real creaminess. The carbonation is right on here for the flavors. A bit of alcohol warming is present. Drinkability is good. The taste is good, the price is not bad, I don't think any of the flavors will kill this session wise and I wouldn't mind having it again."
"Drink-ability - this fall I have really enjoyed this beer with or after supper. I like that its a porter with a hop finish. Perfect for fall and early winter."
"so if you are in the mood for a hoppy but balanced porter, this is great. if you are a malty man (or woman)...maybe rethink this. for me it was if troegs took hopback and dead reckoning stuck it in a room together, put on some wacka wacka bow chicka bow wow music and this beer was birthed. sound weird?? maybe...but i get it"
"Drinkability - An interesting brew. I think that this beer is well made, but nothing special without the obvious dry-hopping....which at least makes this different and memorable."
"D: An excellent robust porter. One of my favorite Avery beers."
"Again the flavor is dominated by a nice roasted maltiness with hints of chocolate, caramel, burnt toast, coffee, oatmeal, toffee and lots of bitter earthy hoppiness, especially for the style. Smooth, creamy medium body that is very well balanced with a nice bitter dry hop finish that counters the rich, smokey/roasted maltiness."
"Drinkability: Not bad, although I would like a little less hoppiness to grace my porter. A solid try that is overshadowed by bitterness. Okay."
"This is an ink-black beer...thick and opaque. The head is a little too thin, but still leaves a slight lace. Nice smell. Coffee, caramel, nutty, and roasty. The beer has a little piny hops in the background, but the chocolate and malt aroma really drive the sensation though. The taste is balanced, with a good roasted flavor. Moderate sweetness, with a full mouthfeel. There's a lot of highly roasted, nearly burnt malt in the taste. This is a very nice beer."
"overall I recommend this porter."
"Somewhat light in body with chocolate and cinnamon, watery on the swallow, and a return of chocolate on the finish. Good level of carbonation for the structure of the beer makes for an OK feel and drink. Nothing stands out here making for a mediocre brew overall."
"Tone down those essential oils and come a few more miles into porter territory and you have me. I'd try it on tap to see if maybe this one was sitting on the shelf too long or something, and drink it if you handed it to me for free."
"Notes: This is one of the best American Porters that I have had to date, no doubt about it! I will always have a soft spot in my heart for Anchor Porter, as that was the first porter I really fell in love with. I don't think it quite reaches that level of greatness, but it comes really damn close! It smells great, features a full-flavored profile of goodness, and has a really rich mouthfeel that makes it shine. Highly recommended"
"P.S. I noticed that a lot of the less-than-stellar reviews of this beer were all sampled via bottle, and since I have yet to sample this beer from a bottle, my initial suspicion is that it must be drunk from the tap. Much respect to all of the reviewers; your comments are always well taken."
"I love the mouthfeel of this beer. Its not watery as some American porters might be. I prefer porters to have more maltiness and not be lost in the hop bitterness, though."
"Pours a super dark molasses colored brown. Great two finger, tan head, that leaves some awesome Brussels lacing . Nice filmy foam after a couple of sips. Super roasted bread malts with a little watery coffee and soft chocolate aromas. The taste starts with dark roasted malts and some roasted walnuts. The middle gets a strong flash of gypsum dryness in the palate added to some dry chocolate malts. The finish is bitter charred malst and light hops. Smooth yet dry palate make for a easy drinking porter."
"This beer seems like a hopped up version of a porter...even as a hop fan, I don't think it works out too well. The flavors just run together and don't really contribute much..."
"Edit: looking at other reviews, particularly of people I usually agree with, this must be a bad bottle."
"This was a great porter."
"D: A nice, drinkable, wel-made porter."
"d: only one for me thanks. I go for more traditional porters, so not really my style."
"The feel is thick and gritty. Has a burn at the swallow. One of the hoppier porters I've ever had. Damn nice."
"a dark mahogany with a rather small head... a nose mild of malt and molasses primarily, and hops. surprisingly hoppy citrus that carries over into the palate and creates a mild acidic quality. rather english in timbre. not very smoky in taste. a bit leathery. a malty but not overtly sweet beer."
"Great stuff, gotta get some more!"
"Pours a dark brown with light ruby colored edges and has a finger of rich beige colored head that dissolves into a lasting layer around the glass. Very classy presentation. Aroma is full of roasted malts and a lot of smoke. Flavor is piney hop bitterness upfront with some roasted malts and ends up smokey with a light lasting bitterness. Its a light- to medium-bodied beer that is booming with flavor. There really isn't any ""searching"" for flavors in this beer, its all pretty in your face. Just the way I like it. Very well done. The aroma almost reminds me of a light Alaskan Smoked Porter."
"Pours thick dark brown, smallish tan head. Smells faintly of hops mixing with harsh dark malt, and the typical portery sweetness. Taste, is overall a bit thin through. Definite dark and toffee notes. Just not a huge depth there. However, this is a very creamy porter, making for a very pleasant drinking experience. The high sessionability makes it rewarding in my book."
"A good, hoppy porter. Chocolatey, a touch of citrus, and roasty. Finishes dry. The hops is perhaps a bit much for a porter. I guess I'm just used to English porters."
"D-Knowing the abv, I wouldn't have more than two myself. But it's very drinkable indeed. (Goes down smoothly) Do yourself a favor, and go get some of this."
"excellent avery!"
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. No freshness dating indicated on the bottle. Poured the color of cola with a sparse, quarter inch off-white cap that quickly dissipated into a soapy swirl and a broken band. Only light penetration is revealed as ruby highlights around the base of the glass. Some thin spits and strands of lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose suggests, cocoa, toffee, molasses and perhaps a hint of black licorice. Taste reveals coffee, cocoa, caramel, molasses and some hops bittering detectable at the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and a little prickly across the tongue. Very drinkable and flavorful. Flavor profile is a little bolder and more complex than your traditional porter; this is definitely a winner in my book."
"Overall: Mouthfeel is pretty good, well carbonated and medium in body with a bit of oiliness. Very drinkable for how bold the flavor its, I love this porter."
"D: I am marking this one in my beer book. This has to be one of the tastiest porters I can remember having. As mentioned before, I like the typical robust malty porters and shy away from really hopped type porters or stouts. But, if they get the right combination going, I am hard pressed to set the glass/bottle down. This one great!"
"Excellent blend of black patent malt (coffee-ish), chocolate malt, and a generous amount of hops. It finishes with a distinct java flavor and high-alpha bittering hop."
"D - Very drinkable. I;d have this again."
"Drinkability - Drinkability is below average. There are plenty of Porters better than this one."
"taste is great but it doesnt do much for me its just sort of there. the real highlight of this beer is the mouthfeel. my problem with porters is that thick syrupy mouthfeel but in this beer that is not there. i feel biased because i bought this beer because it is my ideal abv. i look forward to making this a standard when it is in stock."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a deep brown color that is pretty solid with light transparency on the sides when held to the light. The head is modest at best but very sticky. The aroma is sweet and has a nice hop smell that you miss in most porters. That alters the taste and gives it more bitterness (to my liking). A little off for a straight porter, but the flavor is nicely balanced. Definitely a good brew, but not over the top outstanding."
"Notes: Good hop character was fine with me and the brew was different yet good. I felt it was not your typical porter and still I enjoyed it just the same."
"This beer is very drinkable - I could get a case of this stuff. Nice."
"D- Fairly drinkable. I don't think I'd have more than one in a session, but still pretty ok."
"This is a dry hopped beer and a very interesting and substantial porter, although I'm not so sure I'm sold on it just yet. The beer is really hopped up for a porter. There are the definite caramel, toffee, roasted chocolate notes, some charred like ash flavors, but this is overwhelmed in part by the leafy hop. There might be an oily or citrus hop quality trying to peak through but it is hard in a porter with a melange of malty qualities. This is a porter trying to be too much like an IPA, and I'm not so sure it completely works. There is a citrusy tanginess on the back end and into the aftertaste that does give it away. The mouthfeel is a touch oily. This is a medium bodied beer, very interesting, just a bit odd to my tastes."
"M/D - Medium bodied and very smooth to drink, although not an amazing beer, still pretty decent and wouldn't mind drinking again"
"D- This beer is super drinkable I think its my favorite porter but with that said it really acts more like a hoppy dark ale with a touch of smoke than a traditional porter. Its flavors are soft smooth and very appealing to me for a beer that I could just sit around and drink."
"O: I enjoyed this porter very much. The dry hopping gave it and extra kick. I will definitely get more of this and immediately jumped to the top of my favorite beers."
"Overall a tasty and well hopped porter."
"Didn't really like this one very much, but it's not horrible. Nothing like the Porters that I like. I probably won't be getting it again."
"To me this is a very well balanced porter. Sweetness and bitterness are both present, yet nicely balanced. I will be buying this again."
"Over all probably the best porter i've had. Much more complex and flavorful than other porters. Reminds me more of a Baltic porter than an American one as this is classified. The hoppiness mixed with rich malt flavors really create something special here. Highly recommend it and look forward to enjoying more in the future"
"Cheers..."
"This is definately a hophead's porter if there ever was one. After reading the description, I had to pick one up. Now I think I might be heading back for six more."
"D-This is one that I will have agin for sure just due to the uniueness and full flavor"
"mouth is quite pleasant and smooth but with a bittering finish. Drinks very easy. Really quite remarkable and earns the name ""New World"". Way to go Avery."
"Overall: This one blew me away, some Avery I like and some I don't care for but this might be one of the best American porters I've ever had. If you have a taste that ranges the whole gamut when it comes to beer, try this. It'll satisfy your hop head needs while still giving you the nice dark malt flavors you'd expect from a porter."
"D: A nice beer overall. Not quite as malty as I like my Porters, but I'm more of an English rather than American Porter fan."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0901-Carl"
"D- New World Porter is another solid beer from Avery Brewing that is definitely worth a shot. Recommended."
"M/D. The carbonation keeps the beer from becoming too heavy and burdensome, but the feel is actually quite creamy and the thickness just right. Not a very sessionable brew, which I don't mind. A couple of these at 6.7% will have me quite content, especially as you will feel the hops lingering after a while."
"This is a black IPA. If it said so, I would have given it a 4.5."
"Very good porter."
"Notes - I have never tasted a beer like this - one that deftly blends the chocolaty/coffee taste of a stout with the hop punch of an IPA. Tasty."
"A slightly above average porter for me. The hops do give it a distinct flavor, though it doesn't stray too far from that classic porter taste."
"Very tasty-Get some!!"
"this beer caught me with my pants down was not expecting to find a dark port that had so much hoppy goodness the smell is nothing but hop but yet the balance of the taste was not to overpowering sill had some malt taste very easy to drink all around a very great beer"
"D-A very good, different porter than I am used to. The hoppiness was to a degree that I haven't seen a lot with porters, so I'm please to see how this beer progressed, and that it was done well."
"Pretty dark brown pour, tan head. Strong earthy aroma some chocolate. Nice roasted malts and mocha with a medium/heavy body. Slight coffee and the hops don't come through too much. Didn't really get the sweet finish. All around very good IMO. Would drink this one again."
"Pours black with a thin head. The smell is surprisingly light given the pitch-black color. The flavor is roasted, sharp with a nice smokey malt sting. The finish is pleasantly bitter but it falls away fairly quickly. The mouthfeel is a little clingy."
"D - Overall pretty good for a porter style."
"Pours black with a good tan head. Aroma of chocolate and toffee, with some caramel and malt. Taste is interesting. Loads of coffee and chocolate, but the hops give the finish an earthy, almost peaty character. Kind of like someone dropped a shot of Islay scotch into the keg. Creamy mouthfeel makes this a nice little beer and pushes it up a few notches."
"The aroma is average for a porter with the requisite burnt malt, chocolate, and caramel. The appearance is dark brown with a slight red hue. The head is sort of smallish, maybe two fingers. The flavor is heavy with the burnt malt taste followed by an astringent hopping. There is some chocolate and caramel in there but not enough to save it. The palate is nice and smooth. The flavors in this one don't seem to come together, they are layered with the astringent bitterness leaving the last impression."
"D - Higher than normal alcohol content. The alcohol can definitely be tasted in this beer. Not that well hidden. Ok. Because of this, the drinkability is slightly lower than I would like. Overall, a very strong porter."
"Notes from 2/16/05"
"3.8/5"
"Mouthfeel is medium. Not a lot of carbonation. Highly drinkable."
"Pours a dark brownish, black color body. Has some head that's off-white, and somewhat lasting. Has an aroma of coffee, maltiness, some roasted elements roasted, some very dark chocolate. A coffee, roasted taste, somewhat watery. Some alcohol taste."
"This porter poured a deep dark brown, nearly black. Atop sits a creamed coffee craggy head. Lots of sticky lacing. Smell hits with sweet chocolate and fruits. Bitter coffee notes as well. Taste follows this lead with the coffee coming to the front of the palate. A definite hop presence as well. The fruits reveal themselves as citric in nature. Mouthfeel is full robust and chewy. I found this brew to be a very solid porter and highly drinkable."
"D- This has a bit more ABV than your typical porters but I thought this gave what I would think an original porter may have tasted like after it was shipped in oak barrels."
"It is a little thin, but very easy drinking for a 6.7%"
"Smooth black pour with a cocoa cream head. Not much lacing along the way. Very fragrant. Sweet chocolate and roasted nuts show up strongly in both aroma and taste. Included in the taste is a spicy hop character that really enhances the flavour. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and fits perfectly with the taste and style. A magnificent porter, one of the best I've had. Avery continues to impress."
"Appearance is good, very dark and tan head. Lacing is very thick. Smell and taste are very good. There is a decent amount of hops, roasted malts, and acidity. Mouthfeel is good, medium body and light carbonation. Drinkability is decent given the style."
"Overall, this was one great porter. I really liked the fact that this did not lack flavor and had nice characteristics of a good stout."
"The balance is very pleasant and the bitterness and alcohol kept at bay. Plenty of body for a porter, it's actually somewhat distinguished for the style. Great list of quality ingredients, and you never doubt the craftsmanship at Avery. Nice porter."
"I don't know what was going on in the nose, but other than that a very solid porter. I would recommend this."
"Ah well, not all of them can be winners. There are much better examples of the style out there. Pass on New World Porter and grab something else."
"This is my second Avery beer. I'm glad I didn't give up after being disappointed by the first one. Great brew and I look forward to trying more."
"M/D = mouthfeel is nice and creamy. Drys out quickly not leaving you with much at all. I may have had this a little too cool, but I did not enjoy this near as much as I remember."
"My,My,My"
"Avery has a winner yet again in my book, I will buy this one again."
"D: I think this is a fine example of a porter."
"D : Real easy to drink and one that I enjoy"
"Drinkability: This is very drinkable. However, it is so packed with smells and flavor that I wouldn't want to process more than two bottles of this in a sitting. It's a lot of taste and think over at one time."
"Definitely recommended..."
"A great, hoppy porter."
"Deep brown color with a thick tan head. Nose of toasted malts followed by a good serving of aromatic hops. The taste again very roasty and rich with some nice bitter hops to keep balance. A dry medium body with good carbonation. This is for sure one hoppy American porter. A very good example and right up there with Anchor and Fullers."
"D - This is a great porter. It is dry-hopped and excellent."
"nice brew: a little darkfruity, a load of hops. i could enjoy some more roasty complexity, though"
" Tasty, smooth, highly hopped and fairly strong."
"The taste delivers on the aroma's promise, with a blast of fresh citrus hops. The malts, thankfully, make their statement here, with big notes of bitter dark chocolate, coffee, and some roasted nuttiness. All that keeps this from a ""5.0 taste"" is a hint of aspertine on the finish. The mouthfeel is at the right thickness and carbonation levels, with a lasting bitter chocolate finish that balances well with the hops. Overall, this was quite an enjoyable beer. I'm not sure why I'm surprised, as I enjoy most Avery brews. The hoppiness might turn some away considering the style, but for me it was a welcome treat."
"This may not surprise some, but this beer has a kick of hops to it. You can smell the hops mixed with the soft layer of cocoa, and it gives the beer a more distinctive taste; coffee, smoke, hops, and cocoa. Mouthfeel is medium-full with a trickle of carbonation hitting the tongue. Me likey."
"You gotta know I'm loving the porters. Avery pleases me with this tasty treat. Pours a midnight black, no light getting in here. Smells like bittersweet chocolate and a whiff of coffe. Tastes like mild baker's choclate well balanced with the hops and a bit of black coffee. Enjoyed slightly chilled in a stein."
"This is a good porter. It drinks smooth and has a nice malty dry finish."
"D - Good beer not the best I have had from this style, but would drink again if offered."
"It was pretty much pitch black, had a nice head on it though. Kinda frothy looking. Smell was of dark roasted malts with not too much hop coming through. Had coffee hints in the taste and the smell. I liked it. Had sort of a heavier mouth feel. Pretty good drinkability."
"I'd recommend this porter. I had mine on-tap at Roman's Pub in Milwaukee."
"A good drinker and a nice American porter from Avery."
"Drinkablity: Interesting interpretation of porter by Avery. Very tasty."
"Drinkability is average, again, just a generic strong American porter. I understand this one has a great hop character when fresh (November), but by March, even under pressure and kept way too cold, it's muted."
"This is a great keg beer and I would like to drink lots at a time."
"D - pretty good I'd say. The hoppiness is definitely a departure for most porters I've had recently it seems like. Would totally drink again and recommend to all."
"Keep up the good work Avery and I'll keep buying it. :-)"
"If you like porters, make like depeche mode and enjoy the silence."
"Avery makes good beers."
"A tasty porter for sure, though a bit disappointing as I expected more from Avery; however, Avery's stout is a bigger and bolder, as it should be in comparison. I would buy this again if I were wanting a very drinkable porter."
"D: very good, a nice coffee roasted lacing provides for a outstanding flavor and great experience."
"Drinkable, but not exceptionally so. There is not much in this porter which differentiates itself from others of the style. I will definitely purchase other porters before this one, as well as trying other Avery products before returning to this label."
"As Air below me put it. I too had it on tap @ Jose Pistolas in Philadelphia. This beer has all the classic porter traits to it. Pours dark brown with a tan head that disappears quite fast. The brown sugar, caramel, chocolate, and smoked flavors all pull through to make this beer an easy one to drink a few times in a row. There is a nice balance with the slight hops that ring through and the roasted flavor present right from the start. Very creamy and smooth. The flavors burst on your palate making it very easy to drink. As said below, it feels like it could be a good session beer but one too many can rock you. I may have had 3 or 4 and I feel that was enough for me."
"Music enjoyed whilst sampling: Bird Song by the Grateful Dead"
"On tap at Jose Pistolas... Pours very deep brown, almost black and when the light hits it you see the shades of ruby-red. Creamy tan head that sticks around for a bit after the first sips and then fades into a ring around the glass- some lacing. Smells of dark chocolate, smokiness, and hoppiness. Mmm, great taste, smokey chocolate, hops, and caramel. Pretty smooth mouthfeel, the smokiness and the hop bite is something nice to have in a porter. Definitely worth a few pints."
"A nice seasonal offering from Avery. Pours a dark roasted brown that fades to a deep brown red when held in front of a light. Decent head that fades to a fine ring. I love the hoppiness of the nose thanks to the dry hopping. Behind that there is some roasted coffee trying to escape. The taste is hop forward that is really well balanced by the roastedness and coffee notes. Nice mouthfeel to it that finishes dry. A really well done porter with a hopped up twist."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This beer is lighter in body that I think it should be, and it lacks flavor too. Alcohol is evident and warms the stomach a bit, lack of flavor and big malt presence allow this small 6% to come forward. Watery for a porter with a bit too much carbonation in my opinion. This beer goes down well, but I don't think that I'll frequent this beer again anytime soon, its just not all that great. Nothing to write home about. There are many better porters out there, however, I guess if I was in a jam and this were it, then I'd go for it. Overall a decent beer, but not worth my time or money to drink or buy again."
"D: This beer is really good. You should try on one. I'm betting it will be a tailor fit, lads and lasses. I'm glad I live in the New World."
"Flavor is more roasted malts with a hint of sweetness. The finish is dry with a lingering earthy hop flavor and a hint of dark chocolate. Mouth feel is creamy and smooth. Overall a tasty porter with a noticeable hop presence."
"12oz. brown bottle served in shaker pint. Poured a deep brown/black with a finger of fine bubbled tan head. Hoppy aroma with some chocolate malt. Medium bodied. Roasted malt bitterness. Refreshing hop flavor. Dry malt finish with some coffee. Lingering hop bitterness as well. This tasted very fresh to me. Nice American Porter."
"D: Tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is one of the better Porters that Ive had. I typically wouldnt pound down several beers in an evening with this style but could see myself doing so with this one."
"Very good a Porter you MUST try!"
"It's interesting to drink this and think about dry hoppy-ness. You really do get that as a strong character aspect."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a deep amber-brown on the pour but appears black in the glass. There is a thin, creamy tan colored head that sits atop the black abyss. The smell is nice; I mostly get chocolate malt but there are also hints of charred coffee, caramel and smokiness. The taste has a bitterness like burnt coffee which balances the sweetness of the chocolate malt pretty well. The mouthfeel is lighter than I had expected with a more aggressive carbonation that I would like. Overall, a drinkable porter that is worth trying but there are better ones out there."
"A pretty good porter, though it didn't quite pay off to the degree I had hoped for based upon it's appearance. I'd drink it again, but on-tap at my local, it would probably lose going head to head with Black Butte."
"The taste was smooth, chocolaty and delicious. In the mouth it was fairly thin but had a nice carbonation to it. It was one of the better porters I have tried this year."
"D: A good porter from Avery, not the best in the land, but a solid beer. I could see this going with a nice steak or a chocolate dessert, will definitely buy again. The map on the label is a great touch as well, very creative."
"An exceptionally smooth drink. Pours a dark clear mahogany color with a medium size tan head. Good lacing and head retention. Smell is mild toasted malt. This beer is all about taste and mouthfeel. The soft pillowy head and smooth mix of toasted malt and bitter chocolate and the balance (I didn't taste hops, but the mildness of the malt flavor is probably the result of balance) make this a very drinkable beer. Had no idea about abv until I read it here, but this is a sessionable beer. Smooth enough to gulp, interesting enough to sip. Knowing its 6.7, just means slow down and enjoy it. When I think of Avery...I think of hops- blasting Maharajah. They can make a pretty good porter too."
"A tremendous porter that is bold, tasty and complex. It pours nearly black and the head is modest but durable, tan in color and nicely lacing the glass. The smell is impressive--chocolate, coffee, caramel, and citrus and berry hops. The taste is equally intricate, with the flavors bursting forth, and the texture is creamy smooth, very delicious. I'm glad I grabbed more than one of this fantastic, fascinating brew that has quickly moved near the top of my list of favorite porters. Well done, as usual, by Avery."
"D: Great for two or so. A bit heavy and big to be drinking several of them."
"Taste: Chewy brew with chocolate syrup leading into a more bitter coffee taste along with some roasted malt. Caramel hint at the end. Extremely silky smooth."
"drinkable i guess, its a decent porter, just a lot better choices out there"
"D: A very drinkable brew, as porters tend to be milder than the heavier stouts, but are still packed with that tasty roasted malt. Good stuff from Avery."
"D: As with other porters and stouts, I'd have to say I'm stopping at one. Maybe if it were a cooler fall night, I'd have a second."
"Pour features the deepest ruby at the bottom of the glass, bold black through the body and a creamy antique head with enviable tenacity. Smell is massive, smokey burnt coffee toffee. This is a very brave porter, with all of the typical characteristics, i.e. coffee flavors, slight caramel, dark chocolate, and a massive dry-hopped finish. Mouthfeel is exactly what one would expect of a great nightcap, and this beer fills this role admirably. It went down very well on football Sunday too. Bravo, Avery. Bravo."
"Could not drink too many of these even though it did taste better as it warmed"
"Pours from the 12 oz bottle a dark black color with a creamy, chocolate milk type of head that builds up to two inches then dies down to leave a slim layer all over the top of the bear. Lacing sticks to the side of the glass all around. Smell is of roasty malt and some cocoa. Taste is a little smoky with some coffee notes, a little bit of black licorice too. Moutfeel is a little strong which I really enjoyed on a good porter. Very impressive porter!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. A nice very dark opaque brown color with a finger widths of head. The head was a nice foam/bubble mix and partially lasted the whole beer. It had lacings down the side of the glass. The aroma initially smelled of coffee with hints of chocolate. It later changed to smell like a sweet very dark chocolate. The very end of the beer smelled of dark grains and oatmeal. Taste was slighty bitter, but was mostly of grains and oatmeal. The mouthfeel was slightly unpleasant until it was almost room temp. It was acidic in the mouth, almost burnt. Towards the end it was much easier to handle."
"Don't get me wrong, it's not terrible, but not one of the best from avery. Slightly above average."
"This brew pours a brownish-black color. The head is a inch and a half in height, frothy, solid, and light tan in color. Lacing is thorough leaving rings all the way down the glass. The aroma is of roasted malt, graham crackers, cream, and a hint of milk chocolate and grapefruit. The taste is quite bitter for a porter. There is some roasted and burnt malt flavors present, but they are dominated by a bitterness that lingers though into the finish and long afterward. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a high level of carbonation. Overall, this is a decent porter, but I do not think I will buy it again. There are so many great porters out there that there is no need in drinking one that is just decent."
"An Ovaltine chocolate flavor comes through in the taste. Coffee and dark raisins are also present. Moves to a slightly tart finish, yet still pretty clean. To note: this was my third dark beer of the day (one stout, one Belgian dark), so my buds may have been a bit tainted."
"Poured black, with a thick and bumpy two-finger head that clung to the glass in thick dollops of murky yellowish cappuccino-like foam and remained well after the brew was finished. Smelled of rich, dark chocolate, almost Tootsie Roll-like sugary chocolate, with mild vanilla and cherry notes and a slight smokiness. The taste was smoky and bitter up front, the hops are more notable than in most porters. Notes of peat and chocolate came through with a clean coffeeish finish. A very nicely crafted porter and the extra hop presence was a nice addition to the style. Recommended."
"D: A nicely hopped up American Porter. Plenty of bitterness provided by the roasting of the coffee and malts along with the dry hopping process. Recommended."
"in truth you could really drink it all night"
"D - Just an outstanding porter. I love the dry, roasty, and hoppy flavors and the big full mouthfeel. This is really complex, but never overwhelming. I will surely have this again. Dangerously drinkable for such a big beer."
"Great appearance here, full lacing all the way down with a bit of head until the end. The aroma is a bit odd however, almost molasses or maple syrup-like with a touch of citrus hops. The flavor could have a bit more malt to it, but the mix of chocolate and Avery hops (similar to most of their hops profiles) tastes great. I'm glad to see this get more distribution."
"D: I like bitter and hoppy porters. Avery should do a coffee version of this for fun. I bet it would be excellent, too."
"D- Pretty good overall, a decent dark beer for everyday."
"This is a dry-hopped porter. An interesting twist on the style. Overall this is a ok beer, but the interesting twist was not for me. The hops fragrance dominated the flavor with none of the coffee or chocolate notes that I usually enjoy from a porter. In the end it turned more into a darker and less bitter APA."
"Good porter. I'd get it again."
"Very dark in appearance. Could not see light through body. Tan medium head dissapated slowly. Lightly sweet aroma of hops. Taste is initially smoky with a bitter coffee finish. No bite of alcohol on the tongue. Mouthfeel is medium full. Very drinkable for a dark beer."
"Pours the color of strong coffee, only the smallest amount of light makes it through, with a thick tan foam at the top that refuses to settle. Smells of hops, some malt. Good hop bite to it, dry finish. Thick, viscous fluid with little carbonation. Leaves great lacing around the glass. Very good porter, wish I had bought more than 2..."
"A very tasty hoppy porter, will definitly be drinking more of this."
"Goes that down easy, it is a nice crafted brew, however, a bit hoppier than I like my porters."
"An interesting take on a porter. The dramatic hops meld well with the classic porter flavor. A nice change of pace."
"D) I bought a 6er, certainly I will finish it, but I won't be buying again as there are too many good beers to be had."
"Good for the style - it just didn't impress me too much. Still, recommended."
"The taste didn't shy away at all though. Big black malts, chocolaty goodness in perfect quantity, some coffee to go with it. The hops are in just the right balance, faint and leafy I think. And also faint is some caramel sweetness. The mouth is pretty good, the body medium and steady throughout, good carbonation, and overall makes out for just a really just a great porter."
"Decent alcohol warming effects take over quickly. Medium to heavy bodied and fairly creamy. Goes down smooth. Pretty heavy for a porter, but I'm not complaining. Wonderful beer."
"Beer poured a dark brown with ruby undertones. The tan head was two fingers on the pour and sustained long after. Nose is somewhat present, of toasted sweet malts. Taste is well balanced between the roasted chocolate malts and the dry hop bitter finish. Beer is sweeter than usual for the style. Mouthfeel is almost perfectly smooth, perhaps because of the amount of time is sat in my fridge. Overall drinkability is very good. This is a very nice porter that I plan on trying again!"
"D - The flavors don't overwhelm, but the beer gets a little boring near the end of the glass. Somewhat filling too. A good example of a Porter, and I'll drink it again no doubt, but I'll reach for other versions of this style over Avery's Porter."
"Drinkability - Not as good as I had hoped. I would have preferred this more if it was less bitter and a lot smoother."
"Notes: A solid porter, but the carbonation levels -- while helping to create a nice head -- seemed to slow me down. I'll bet this would feel great on the cask, however, and would go down much more smoothly."
"The taste, smooth bittersweet chocolate with a touch of roasty malt that gives it a nice bitterness in the end. The roastiness hangs around the mouth for quite a while and gives you sort of a lingering coffee taste. The mouthfeel really makes this great, as the carbonation is low and fine, giving it a smooth mouthfeel."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with no dating system into a pint glass. It had a black color that showed mahogany highlights when against a bright light. It had a huge tannish head from a healthy pour that settled into a constant 1/4"" inch foam with great lacing. The smell was great - roasted malts, coffee and some sweetness (the original sample had a weird piney smell that thankfully wasn't in this one). The taste was amazing. This is exactly what I want in an Am Porter. Great roasted taste from start to finish with some bitter but not too much at the end. Mouthfeel was nice and creamy. Overall this is an amazing beer that I highly recommend. This one will be a player in the rotation for sure (4.5, HR, T, Y)"
"Pours a deep orange-brown color with a thin one-finger orange-white head that dissipates quickly. The aroma conjurs up images of vanilla, molasses, roasted cocoa, dark cherry, and sour mash. Very complex smells in here for a porter. And it's tasty too. Flavors that hit noticeably are nutty cocoa and chocolate with dark fruit. Finishes strong with a bitter coffee sensation. Gotta love the hop content here; it really takes hold and is quite pleasant if you like hoppy beers. Mouthfeel is competent. Overall, this is a very good beer. I wouldn't hesitate to grab a sixer of this at the store, or order a round for unsuspecting friends. I think they would thank me for it. Well done."
"Very drinkable beer."
"That being said, Ill probably take OldEngineOils advice and try some of their other beers. Or just give this NW Porter one another shot."
"A bit more of stout characteristics but whatever the style is its a nice tasty beer."
"This is a highly enjoyable porter, with a smooth feel that's very welcoming. If porters are your thing, you will probably love this. Recommended."
"Finally found another six pack of this here in Raleigh for the first time in six months. Loved it back then and still love it now. Avery boasts that what makes this porter different is that it's dry hopped. This is definitely evident in the aroma. Hops also are not shy in the taste as well. For a hophead like me, this beer is great for the winter months. If I want a dark beer on a cold night and am also in the mood for an IPA, I'll certainly look for this stuff."
"What intense flavors and balance! Probably fits the Baltic Porter style, more than an American Porter, but I can't deduct points for that. Impressive on nearly every front."
"This beer was really not up to par with the usually very high quality of Avery's brews. It is the only bad experience that I have had with beer from this brewery. Go with one of their stouts instead. If you are in the area, the brewery is worth a stop also."
"Tastes dry roasty and potently hopped. Perhaps williamette hops. Finish is ashtray roast. Dry, but with enough a caramel sweet beneath to keep the roast in line. Woody and earthy. Enjoyable winter treat. Md-thick mouthfeel and md-heavy carbonation."
"The aroma of vanilla, coffee, and mint is enticing, as are the flavors that blend coffee, chocolate and rich barley notes. The beer is neither exceptionally bitter, nor acrid. It is robust and full bodied, yet smooth, benefiting from a transparent yeast."
"Overall: This is probably one of the best Porters I have ever had. I was expecting a booring beer with out much taste. Unfortunately, I get that a lot from Porters. What I got this time was an amazing beer. WOW."
"It's well balanced, medium-bodied yet creamy, with a dry finish. Drinkable for the style. I dig it."
"Overall, this is a good beer and should be regarded as such. And worth trying and seeking out if you like Porters, but don't go to the ends of the earth."
"The drinkability is good. A verynice standard porter. MK"
"D - Abominable. Porters should be quaffable. It is bold and potent (as I have come to expect from Avery), but not enjoyable to drink. It's lingering flavors and lack of refreshing palate make this hard to finish. This is the sort of beer that I take one sip, and then I don't want another sip until about two minutes later when the awesome smell makes me think, ""Come on, it must be good if it smells like this."" Sigh. If only that were true. After I drank most of my glass, it became very easy to drink! Yeah, I will pass on this porter in the future. But don't worry, I've got more Avery brews in the fridge!"
"D - Drinkable. A nice porter from Avery, would recommend for sure."
"Thick creamy mouthfeel with multiple layers. Drink 1,2, or 4"
"this is a great porter, EXECLLENT!"
"Pours the darkest of browns, with a slight redish hue. Thin tan head, with decent retention, and a nice lace. Smell is sweet, but roasted, with a hint of chocolate.Body is thin for a porter. Taste is of is rich, with chocolate, roasted coffee, and a nice smooth, but bittered coffee like finish.Liked this one a lot."
"The smell is a bit thin and roasty. Black patent malt, roasted barley. Very dry and light on the aroma. The taste is a little better. Full bodied and roasty. Dry and chocolatey. Only a slight bit of a soured porter taste. Good, but a little bit robust for the style."
"Thanks for sharing Mike!"
"Nice rich coffee/chocolate overtones with some subtle fruit characteristics (cherry mentioned in nose). This was billed as a porter/IPA, but it lacks the hop profile characteristic of an IPA.	A nice example of the style with excellent mouthfeel, full robust coffee/chocolate flavors."
"Overall good drinkability, nicely flavored porter with a good mouthfeel."
"Jen: Okay, so I really only expect the best from Avery every time I pick up one of their brews, so, this being a porter, I was ready for a soft let down. But it never came. The brew smells of toasty malts with a mild smokey background. The taste brings more of the same. A blend of toasted malts and roasted coffee beans with a hint of baking chocolate. This is a very different porter, as it is dry-hopped to give it that little something at the end. This may not be my favorite, but it rose up to the occasion."
"Poured a beautiful dark dark brown with ruby highlights. A huge billowly tan head. Smells of roast and chocolate. Taste is a hearty roastiness, chocolate, coffee bitterness. I didn't find it to have as much hop character as it bragged about. The mouthfeel was medium, but much thicker than sierra nevada's porter. Drinkability was a little less than Sierra nevada's porter due to the thicker feel and 6.7 abv. This is one of the tastiest, and most robust porters I've had. There are many stouts out there with much less character."
"This beer is very flavorful and enjoyable to drink. This is no English Porter as evidenced by the assertive bitterness and upfront hop aroma. I very much enjoyed this cutting-edge American-brewed bastardization of a classic English style."
"D- no doubt an american porter. I love what the dry hopping does for this brew. Creative and flavorful, this is a very enjoyable porter."
"Drinkability- Pretty yummy after dinner porter. I really liked this one."
"Overall a nice average porter...but there are so few examples of this style available that it becomes a ray of sunshine on a dismal day."
"New World Porter is outstanding beer, is one of Avery's best (along with their IPA) and is one of the best porters of any sub-type that I've ever had. Once I saw the list of ingredients, I knew that it was going to be good. I just never dreamed that it would be this good. Highly recommended."
"Poured a very deep brown color with reddish highlights. head is massive, tannish and has good retention. Nice lacing. Smell is dark fruity, chocolately, coffee-like. Extremely enjoyale. Taste continues with the smell with dark fruits, chocolate, coffee to be found. A nice bitterness presents itself at the finish. Alcohol is completely hidden. Very drinkable. A perfect example of the style."
"Avery's New World Porter pours from the bottle a nice near opaque color. The smell is nice and malty, with carmel undertones wafting through. The tasty is malty, with additional pleasantly matched bittering. There is a mild after taste of caramel and hops which adheres to the tip of the tongue. This is a very nice porter. Keep an eye out for this and gice it a try. Enjoy!"
"Overall a very solid brew. Blends the typical porter taste with more aggressive hops. Maybe not what I'd reach for when I get a craving for a classic porter, but a great beer in it's own right."
"Very drinkable for its strength, very nice robust porter IMHO"
"This porter gives a nice balance of roastiness and hops."
"cheers..."
"A bit unbalanced on the dry hopped end in flavor, but still a favorable porter all around."
"New World is dark brown, almost black, with a large, creamy, tan head. Retention is very good. Aroma is of roasted dark malt with hints of chocolate. Caramel is also in the mix and is joined by just an edge of nuttiness. Taste begins with roasted malt, with touches of chocolate, that round into caramel flavors as a sip continues. Nutty flavors also come into play towards the middle of a sip. Sweetness is ample and grows towards the finish. This is a great porter, flavors are nicely layered and evolve nicely throughout a sip. This is one of those beers I see myself picking up frequently."
"A nice beer and a decent porter on a fine day, last drink of the session at the Brick Store Pub, with the Atlanta B.A. crew."
"black beer with massive tawny, creamy head. Sweet, heavy malt/sugar odor. Taste is sweet too, mildly roasted malt. good, normal porter. thick, full bodied. nothing really stands out about this porter but it was all around good and i'd have another."
"Thick head that faded pretty fast. Black. I smelled typical roasty, choclate american style porter undeneath a huge hop aroma. Again there is a porter under all the hops, but the hops are too strong and the subtlety that typifies a great porter is buried. Id LOVE to try this with a lot less hops I think there is a great porter in here its just bittered into oblivion by the hops."
"A different approach to a porter, this one is dry hopped. The smell is very very strong with the hops as you can expect from a dry hopped brew. The taste is good, smokey and earthy. Chocolate and caramel create the background for the very fragrant hops. All in all a good brew, has a higher alcohol content but its pretty well disguised."
"I was not hugely impressed with this beer. It looked nice in the glass; uneven head up top, opaque dark brown down below. There were nice coffee flavors up front, with a definite hop taste on the finish. It's a little unusal for a porter and might take some getting used to."
"Pours a nearly opaque black with a nice tan head that retains well and leaves intricate lacing on the glass. The aroma is incredibly hoppy, with big citrus, pine and resin jumping out of the glass (reminds me very much of their IPA), along with some roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee, toasted bread, and a touch of alcohol. The flavor starts out with a nice roasty flavor, along with some dark chocolate and expresso, citrusy and resiny hops, some dark fruits and a hint of alcohol. The mouthfeel is lighter than expected but in line with the style (this is a porter not a stout after all), with moderate carbonation and drinkability is quite good. A good brew from avery, perhaps a bit hoppier than a traditional american porter but its more present in the nose than in the flavor."
"This beer's downfall is characteristic of the majority of Avery brews: too much booze. I really do not understand how they do it. It actually impresses me that they manage to let the alcohol run the show on almost every beer they make. A very consistent brewery."
"I begining to question why Avery has even bothered to push their standard beers out beyond their local area. This porter for example which I have heard so much about is just a mess. Dark with a good head and lacing to boot. But come on dry hopping a porter this much is not the best idea. It didn't work for Alpha Klaus although the choice of hops here better compliments the porter. I do like the smell of the C-hops but that is not what I want in my porter. While they do not come through too strong in the taste they do take away form what tastes like a very nice robust porter. I would like to try the base with out the aggressive dry hop and I think it would be much better. As it is I would drink this again."
"The mouth is a bit thin for the style. I'm glad I bought this as a single...I'll leave it at that."
"Drinkability: A very sold American Porter."
"Wow, very nice! A very impressive robust porter...its too bad I only got one."
"Dark brown, reddish highlights at the bottom, seems to be clear. Flat head of under 1/2 an inch, creamy bubbles. Sheets of tan lace. Slight coffee aroma, a bit of leafiness. Mouthfeel is lighter but slick, carbonation on the lower side. Different flavor than some, sweet malted milk impression with a fairly pronounced herbal hoppiness that shows up later in the profile. Seems less hoppy on warming up a bit. I like this one OK, the end kind of annoys me a bit in its dry hop character. At least it distracts me a little -- and the finish seems noticeably thinner than the start is."
"Generally, I really like this porter, but it couldbe a little better. While there is nothing wrong with it at all, for some reason I feel that something is missing..."
"D: Crisp finish enhance drinkability and the alcohol is present enough to be warming but not obtuse."
"Overall impression: A very interesting offering from Avery. Well balanced and drinkable despite the relatively high ABV and strong flavors. I wish this one was available year round."
"The balance is good, though the hoppiness (a signature trait of most of Avery's beers) is a little disconcerting at times for this particular style. Nonetheless, the overall effect is one of a smooth and flavorful porter. As for drinkability,this is a heavy-hitting porter with lots of flavor and hoopla about it. I'd happily drink one a day for the rest of the winter. Be sure to grab this while it's available this year."
"Poured a very dark, yet still translucent ruby brown with a minimal head that laced the mouth of my pint glass. The aroma was a very nice blacance of hops and roasted barley. The mouthfeel was full and dextrinous and the carbonation was just right. The robust flavor of chocolate and roasted malts was accompanied by a slight alcohol warmth. The hops were well suited for the style and struck a good balance with the maltiness of the brew. I'd had New World Porter in past years that seemed a little too hoppy to let the roastiness of the dark malts shine through, but this year's batch seems right on the money. I really enjoy breweries that have a diverse catalog of beers and Avery makes a point to cover as many styles as a brewery practically can."
"Comes out of the bottle a deep black color with a modest cream-colored head that dissipates quickly and leaves behind hints of lacing. Aromas of coffee, alcohol, burnt toast, and roasted nuts come to mind. The taste is quite sweet with a roasted character and thick texture. I did not enjoy the mouthfeel or the aftertaste; seemed too heavy in my mouth with an astringent aftertaste. Over time the aftertaste evolves into more of a bread-like aftertaste that takes away from the beer. I think this brew is too rich in terms of 'roasted' and 'smoked' characteristics to be enjoyed more than once at any given time. I certainly did not want another one."
"Very good drinkability and one of the better porters I've had in a long time."
"from the bottle. poured black with with deep mahogany edges with a brown head with lots of lacing. aroma, the caramels came out strong, than came the malts, chocolate, hints of hops. flavor, toffee, caramel, malts, chocolate, dark fruits. a very good beer."
"Full bodied and chewy, this is what porter is all about. Almost as good as homebrewed. Excellent brew."
"This beer pours out black with a large, foamy, light brown head. The aroma is a delicious smelling blend of roasted malt and fresh hops. This smells much hoppier than your average porter. The flavor starts out chocolatey and malty, then turns roasty and bitter. Lots of hops come through in the finish. Mouthfeel is a little watery. Good drinkability. I love a hoppy porter like this, and I wish there were more available to me."
"Awesome!"
"No freshness date. Shows only litle brown head when pooring in and a almost black beer make presentation style like. Nose is very creamy, hazelnut, coffee and flowery hops. Overal a fresh and good impression. Taste shows a full malty and creamy maltbody that has lots of bittercacao and coffee. Aftertaste is bitter roasty and good hops. Mf is very oily and creamy and overal taste is well balanced. The low carbonisation makes mouthfeel even more pleasant. Yes this is a fine beer, bitter, roasty ad creamy.. just as it should be for a porter."
"Overall, a decent porter, but probably not one I will seek out in the future."
"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a towering tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice dry, roasted flavor that boasts of chocolate and black patent malts along with a bitter hop aroma; very nice. The taste is good. It has a complex flavor that extends from creamy chocolate and black malts to a hoppy finish and aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good porter. I love the hop character. It really adds to the already good aroma and taste."
"Another solid brew by Avery. Pours a thick brown, almost black and creamy. Smells of malted and roasted grains. Chocolate and bittering decorate the aromas. Tastes also, chocolatey and roasted, along with caramel, toffee, and coffee. High hop flavors penetrate the taste upfront and ride the beer into the finish. Unique grassyness, pineyness, and esters in a porter. Tastes more like a Baltic Porter, only without the Lager flavors or Noble hops. Although not to style, all hopheads will love it."
"Thanks to Larry for inviting us in on a Saturday and for even giving me an early sample of the 2005 Beast!"
"A creamy yellowed tan head rests lazily atop a black body with gleaming mahogany highlights. The head retention is fairly good, and it leaves craggy rings of thin lace as it slowly dwindles. The nose is chocolatey, caramelish, fruity, roasty, and citrusy/piney-hoppy. It's crisp in the mouth with a fine-bubbled standard carbonation and medium-light body. The flavor is rich with notes of dark, bittersweet chocolate; dull caramel; coffee grounds; and fruity (berry-like, softly citrusy, and with some mild vinous undercurrents). It's solidly bitter, and just a touch acidic from the dark malts, leaving it to finish quite dry with a firm, lingering bitterness."
"Drinkability: I probably won't come back to this beer."
"Avery = how cool. Only drawback is the no bottled date. But a great black / brown edge pour, foamy head ,. Nice lacing. Malty & chocholate aroma, transferred to the taste too! Mini hop bit at the end of the quaff, and a slight sour (old ale?) finish, but a good thing. Full & creamy, had only 2 outside on the deck in 88 degree temp, they still flowed fine !"
"Definately one of the best non-imperial American porters. Almost Imperial at 6.7 % abv."
"This is one really really really good brew. I recommend it highly!"
"Great looking beer, deep ruby red when held up to light. Tight tan head, almost as even and finely textured as nitro poured. Great lacing. Aroma is good, chocolate, cocoa, and coffee. Taste is a big letdown. Hoping walks all over everything else. Hop bitterness is the dominant element. Yea, theres some sweetness, a bit of chocolate, but its all buried in hop bitterness. Not much of a porter, almost like a really half-assed RIS."
"This is a very nice robust porter from Avery. I always have a hard time giving a bad score to a porter on its appearance due to its ability to hide flaws. This one had such a wonderful, mocha-colored, head that was insanely sticky. The deep,near-opaque, body has a burnt-orange tint. The is filled with roasted maltiness and java. The taste is very burnt with a coffee-grind finish. The is a very full-bodied porter that is enjoyable. With all that said, it is just another average/above average porter that you run into often."
"Poured a wonderful deep mahogony with full opaqueness and a cafe au lait head with patchy bubbles here and there. The nose was split between a burnt coffee flavor and hoppiness. The taste was about the same with a roasted flavor in the beginning full of oats and chocolate, the middle was full of fresh hops and the finsh was a burnt grain flavor. Mouthfeel was full and creamy. Tasty!"
"OVERALL COMMENTS: You know, this really doesnt fit the style for a porter, what with all the hoppiness and such and you know what else? I just dont care. OUTSTANDING beer!"
"A big rocky and lacy tan head settles over clear dark maroon/brownish liquid. Hoppy nose with coffee undertones. Initial malt sweetness blends nicely with roasty coffee tones and above average hoppiness for the style. Finishes bitter and dry, very tasty and drinkable."
"Its strange to bombard a porter with dry hopping but what the heck, Im glad Avery went for it."
"Drinkability: Adam Avery has created his own ""New World"" interpretation of a porter, with a creamy mouthfeel and an assertive hoppy"
"An excellent but very different porter. Highly recommended!"
"This porter poured a very dark brown, almost black, with red chestnut around the edges, and with creamy, light brown foam that persisted a long time and clung to the glass. The smell was surprisingly hoppy with bitter, resinous hops, mixed with cocoa malt aroma. The taste was correspondingly very resinously hoppy and malty (chocolate and cocoa flavors) with a rather hoppy finish. The mouthfeel was dry, smooth, and crisp with medium body and moderate carbonation. The malt and hops lingered in the aftertaste. This was a rather nice, and somewhat different porter, with the difference being the hops."
"This brew started with a great head and dark color...smell was a tad over on the hoppiness scale with very little malt quality. Smell was more that of an IPA. Taste equally was more hoppy than expected....malt was light on the front...nice dry finish though. Mouthfeel was slightly harsh which also affects drinkability. Overall a decent brew but not a great representation of the style."
"The taste is a bitter, yet mellow burst of coffee and malt takes over. Again, a touch of hops, but I would not consider this beer to be overly hoppy by any means. The mouthfeel is decent...maybe a bit thin for its style. The aftertaste is also a bit bitter, but does not linger...very refreshing. Easily a session brew in my opinion...another keeper from Avery."
"Drinkability: If you want a porter, get something else. Should be labeled a dark IPA. Would be more accurate, surely. (I know, don't call you Shirley.)"
"Absolutely outstanding."
"Cavernous, cumulus fluff of tightly encrusted carbonation with a huge stick. Almost salty presence on nose, and a soap/oak smokiness with an undercurrent of caramel, A very surprising hop chalk presence is immediately noted on mouth, and the present roast character does not seem to blend well with the former, creating an almost toothpaste flavor; pine essence and black licorice jump around. Cannot recommend this one."
"Very drinkable. This may not fit the usual porter profile but it is a tasty beer."
"addendum: I'm not going to change the review score because this doesn't strike me as a porter. It's damn good though. Beautiful fruits lead into ruby grapefruit. Yeah, yeah I can drink this easily."
"Goes down a little too easy, before I knew it I had 3, and was feeling pretty good :-)."
"Once again, Chris (clvand0) stepping up to the plate with this one. 12oz. bottle poured into a snifter. It poursa deep ruby red color with one finger of head. There is just a touch of lacing. The smell is sweet and malty with lots of coffee and chocolate flavors. Smells almost like a mocha capuccino. The taste is more chocolatey than coffee, slightly sweet. Lots of roasted malt character to it as well. The mouthfeel is decently thick for a porter, and the drinkability fairs well. Another nice Avery beer."
"This beer pours a nice deep dark brown color with a small ring of head over top of the beer. The nose is chocolatey, with a touch of raisiney sweetness as well. Very interesting. The flavor is chocolate, moving towards a raisiney finish. I like it. The feel is nice and thick, somewhat coating in the mouth. This is a nice, chewey porter. The flavors are nice, but I would like to see more chocolatey flavor."
"Overall Impression: Very interesting. One mother trucking load of hops here. Im not a porter fan, so the twist is welcome in my house. Complex and enjoyable. Style schmyle."
"Dark brown with no light coming through. Thick and chunky light-brown head with lumps like oatmeal. The head hangs out for a while and slowly drops down. Sweet and roasty smell, deep espresso and bitter chocolate. Intense flavor with rich raisin, sharp molasses, and bitter chocolate and coffee. Creamy mouthfeel, moderate to low carbonation. A little tannic. Bitter coffee lingers, with a slight hop bitter running beneath. Very rich and intense flavor, but very satisfying. Thanks to Brent for this one."
"Beer poured into the ubiquitous 16-oz logo'ed pint glass. Appeared to be an almost rosy black. some creamy-beige head was present, but dissipated fairly quickly. Brew smelled very nice, a big malt backbone with a hit of ""dry-hopped sweetness"". Taste was really good, nearly outstanding. Brew is rich in complex malty flavors, with coffee and sweet/nutty flavors domminating. The hops provide a nice balance to the brew without distracting from the distinct porter taste. Brew could nearly be called an imperial or double porter! Great mouthfeel and very high drinkibility. Very undemanding on the palate and very rewarding. This was an unexpected gem."
"Pours dark and deep brown color, I can't see through the glass when held up to a light, decent creamy light brown head that leaves good lacing in my glass, has a chocolate and coffee aroma. Dark roasted malty chocolate flavors, full body with a thick mouthfeel, nice bitter hoppy finish."
"A good tasting beer, the alcohol was very prevalent in the beer's flavor. It pours a dark brown in color with very litle head. Lace does from on the glass, but it slides back down in to the beer rather quickly. The flavor was chocolate and malt. Slight coffee flavors too. However, the alcohol taste was just slightly too strong for me preference."
"Pours a deep brown with a hint of red showing thru when held up to the light with a creamy head that settles into a soapy-like finish.Big roasted malt hits the nose as well as some nuttiness and just a hint of cocoa,smells big and bold.Taste is also of deep roasted malt and earth,with some sweetness coming on more as I drink the hops dont come into play much u can tell they are there but not overly done.A big robust porter full of complexities very well done from Avery."
"Mouthfeel is medium, creamy and very clean with a dry, malty aftertaste. Very up-front, bold and complex flavor. If anything, it tries too hard; I like my porters a bit more subtle than this. This is very close to a strong dry stout."
"Backwash: Im very surprised that so many people find this to be so hoppy (or too hoppy); or think it is so stout-like. I found this to be the opposite. Its not as viscous or sweet as Fullers or as hoppy as Smuttys Robust Porter. Maybe it's the technique, or the blend of hops; but the dry-hopping works for me here. A nice blend of the old and the new."
"Not as good as Fullers but still a great Porter. Pours a very dark brown/black with a thick light brown head. Thin, spidery lacing throughout. The aroma is roasty with hops and cocoa. Medium-bodied with a nice blend of roasted malt, chocolate and coffee flavors. The finish is roasty and lightly hopped and lasting. I liked this one."
"Well this certainly was a big and bold porter. The bottle doesn't lie. Apparently dry hopping makes the beer much more bitter? I'm not sure but this was an extremely bitter example of a porter. The smell is almost all hops. The body on this beer was very thick imo. This beer did actually have a good precense of malts to complement the hops. There's a good amount of chocolate and some coffee and caramel in there as well. But the hops take the show and seem out of place at times. The finish is very roasted and hoppy and lingers. Definitely a beer worth trying but not my favorite porter."
"Overall this is a very different/interesting brew. It's kind of an IPA and porter mix."
"It's a bit overcarbonated and abused the mouth. Body is sitting on the light side of the medium fence. I could drink one or two of these, but that's about it."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Pours a dark brown cloudy liquid with a white foamy head. The head stayed for a little while, and there was a fair amount of lace. The smell had a faint amount of chocolate to it. The taste was slightly roasted sweet malt, with a hint of coffee at the end. Not bad. Pretty mild on the hops, and bitterness. Medium body, just the right carbonation. This was very drinkable. Good session porter. Nice offering from Avery."
"I don't say this often, but this might be just too bitter. For the style, for the style! I mean, I like hops and all. But it would have been nice to have a slightly stronger malt character, or even some alcohol esters toward the finish to lend some variety to the tongue. It's an interesting idea, and not a bad beer by any means, but a little too heavy on the hop emphasis for even my SoCal hophead self."
"12oz Bottle no freshness date. Dark brown and clear with a decent looking head which seems to be retaing well. Nice aroma, caramel, chocolate and cookie dough come to mind.Some nice caramel notes in there as well. Medium body with even carbonation and a slightly dry and bitter finish. Flavor is nice also. Bitter chocolate, roasted malt and a slioght smokiness. Overall a damn fine Porter."
"A brown creamy thick head rests on top of a deep brown to black beer. At first I get a fruity fresh hoppy aroma, then aromas of toasted bread, and roasted coffee kick in. The toasted aromas are quite wonderful. This is a thick full bodied porter. Taste of chocolate, toasted biscuits, and a full malt character. There is an aftertaste of burnt malt/ roast coffee. The hop flavor is quite good and quite interesting, with the present roasted notes it is quite hard to tell what types of hops are used, but they are quite noticeably there. The hops add an interesting zing to this tasty brew. This is a very well done beer, and it is quite tasty to boot."
"Tasty stuff."
"ng"
"Drinkability is high and I recommend drinking this at a little over 50 degrees F."
"This beer pours a dark color with reddish hues around the outside edges. It has a small tan head that fades and leaves a small amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is of roasted malts and caramel with a smoky characteristic. The flavor was much like the aroma: roasted malts and caramel with a hint of coffee. Fairly smooth to drink and full-bodied. Good, malty beer."
"When poured, the head was tan and small in size with fine-medium sized bubbles that mostly dissipated. The body was opaque and uncarbonated with a black hue. The nose was that of coffee and some chocolate and the flavor was that of coffee that left an aftertaste. The mouthfeel was very smooth and medium bodied. This beer left a good lacing on the sides of my glass."
"A very nice example of a porter on the robust side of the scale. Poured quite dark, even for a porter. Aroma was dark chocolate, not-quite coffee and a charcoal-ish roasted malt. Full and slightly creamy mouthfeel, jam-packed with roasted malt flavors. Nicely bittered, and, according to the bottle, dry hopped. Finish was strong and clean. Had this with pot roast and mashed potatoes, and it was a perfect pairing."
"Great beer. A little bitter on the finish for my taste, but a great beer."
"Originally sampled on 2 April 2003. This pours black, w/ a small, short lived head. The aroma is roasty & slightly hoppy. Lots of roasted coffee & chocolate flavors in this medium bodied ale. A very nice porter. It was quite enjoyable. Thanks, hopsrus"
"As it is, I thank kbub6f (and TXHops!) for helping me to sample this exemplary porter. Oh, it's good!"
"Update--after a few weeks and the depletion of my stash of New World Porter, I HAD to come back and bump up the score on this beer. I found myself thinking about it a lot--at work, while going to bed, while drinking other beers... The chocolatey, toasty maltiness and the big, pronounced hoppiness are just addictive. This is a REALLY good beer..."
"Pours a deep mahogany brown that is all but opaque. The thick head is a lovely tan color with an abundance of sticky lace, quite decently carbonated. Strong grapefruit hops notes mingle with dark roasted, earthy malts, a most unusual pairing. Taste begins with sharply acidic grapefruit hops, followed by bitter chocolate, coffee, and pine tar notes which linger beyond the end of the taste. The mouth feel is quite smooth. This beer proves that a familiar style can be made quite exotic. Home brewers take note."
"Pours a very dark ruby brown color with a thick and creamy tan colored head that loves to cling to the glass. Nose is sweet caramel and fresh brewed coffee. Medium in body and the taste is sweet milk chocolate followed by notes of bitter dark coffee, tart citrus, and fresh pine. Bitter hop resins remain in a lingering aftertaste. This is a very unusual porter thats also very tasty. Definitely worth a try if you havent had it before."
"I'm surprised at how aggressively hopped this is. I like strong hops. I like porters. Together? Why not."
"This is a gorgeous brew. Crystal clear ruby-black in color with a thick, tan pancake of a head with tenacious lace atop medium to small sized bubbles. The bottle says it's dry-hopped and there is no doubting it. The aroma is predominately grapefruit...lots of fruity hops with just a bit of lavender incense hidden somewhere in there. Mouthfeel is firm and thick. This is a robust porter...Starts with a prominent fruity hoppy sweetness, fading into a sweet roasted malt background with subtle tinges of nickel, and ending in a long coffee and loud, fruity bittering hop finish. Quite rich...one should take some antacid before partaking in this brew. This is not a balanced beer, and it's not supposed to be, but it is well-done and enjoyable none-the-less. If you like IPA's and Porters, try this...it's the best of both worlds."
"A quite deep garnet to brown color, the head spumous in texture, prodigious in size, the lace massive sheets that cling strongly to the glass, both a light chocolate color. Nose is caramel, hop floral and a light bittersweet chocolate sweetness also present. Start is ambrosial; top is middling in mouth feel. Finish is perky in its carbonation, rigorously hopped, droughty malt aftertaste. Avery makes some fine brews if you not tried them, well worth the effort to find and sample."
"You can tell this f'er is dry hopped to an extreme.  It smells more like a Bigfoot than any porter I've had.  I'm guessing bigtime Centennials dry hopping.  The beer looks very nice.  Dark ruby and a wonderful, thick light brown colored head sits on top.  Shows great retention and lacing.  I'm having a hard time getting into this porter.  Usually I like a highly hopped porter (SN, Rogue, Summit, etc,), but this one goes overboard.  The porter qualities aren't allowed to come through much.  Just the barleywine type of hopping.  Very little roastedness or coffee-like tones.  This is not a bad beer.  Just a pretty average but unique porter."
"Easy drinking, session porter."
