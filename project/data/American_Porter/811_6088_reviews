"This one was ok, not great. The taste was really nice, but it was a little too thin for my taste."
""
""
""
"A great dark porter, one of my new favorites."
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel on this is really distracting unfortunately, taking away from some real interesting characters of the beer, but it improves over some time.  Drinkable no problem, but comes off as a lost opportunity to make a better beer."
""
""
""
"Excellent taste!  Smooth and refreshing"
"I love porters and malty beers. This is one of my favorites."
""
"A decent transition beer. Nothing more"
""
""
""
""
"o: A good porter, drinkable and flavorful.  Perhaps not quite as silky as some oatmeal porters and stouts, but the flavors make up for it."

"Just average in my opinion."

"Overall:  The oatmeal brings some subtle notes to this beer.  It goes in a stout more often, but this one is a keeper even though you don't find it in a porter."
""
""
""
""
"O:  A very nice surprise.  Would drink more of this little beauty."

"Got this on a trip to Raleigh,NC.  Good flavor, pours a dark brown color."
"O- A very nice and interesting take on the American Porter.  This is the only Oatmeal Porter that I have ever seen, and I must say I wish that there were more out there!  I can't regularly get this beer which is a damn shame.  Very tasty, too much carbonation and not as much body as I would personally like is what kept this from being a truly outstanding beer in my opinion.  Nonetheless, definitely would buy again if given the opportunity. (3.7)"

"I am a huge fan of porters and this brew is no exception. The appearance is dark dark brown...you would think its black until you hold it to light. The head is a off white...almost tan colored. Smell is just what you expect of a porter, kind of a caramel, chocolate, creamy smell with a hint of bitterness. Taste is just as it smells. Up front you get a nice milk like taste with chocolate undertones with a touch of bitterness at the finish. Very good brew indeed!"

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a very dark brown, almost black, coloring, with chestnut highlights around the edges, and a wispy, thin, clingy, off-white head. Aromas of chocolate, coffee, toffee, and hazelnut, with roasted characteristics to round out the sweet edges. Flavors are chocolate forward, both milk and bittersweet, with a bolt of bitter roasted coffee, cr√®me highlights, and hints of roast throughout. Very balanced on the palate. A dry, light body keeps the drinkability up. The aftertaste is more of the bittersweet chocolate, and the beer has a smooth, dry finish. Solid porter."

"Great balance of roast and chocolate, with enough bitterness to not be sweet, but not enough to seem charred or to overwhelm. Love the rich chocolate character. I could do without the fruity notes."
""
""
""
"Extremely dark brown, almost black. There's a good foamy tan head with a good deal of lacing. It has a bold malty scent, some coffee and caramel hints."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good porter if you enjoy smoke flavor (not my personal taste)"
""
""
""
"Would I change anything about this beer? I'd give it a heavier oatmeal presence but other than that I probably wouldn't do anything."
""
""
""

""

"Would have again; worth trying if you are around where it is brewed."

"Oatmeal stouts and porters are my favourite beer styles so my reviews of these tend to be a little biased. This particular Oatmeal Porter has a beautiful black color and a small head as it should. Smells of coffee, grains, and a little chocolate. The taste is fantastic. I am a huge fan of Highland. This Oatmeal porter is delicious and I would highly recommend it to those who love dark, strong beer."

"O: This is a solid brew, but it really was not what I was expecting. Considering that the name strongly emphasizes the presence of oats, I was somewhat disappointed that I encountered difficulty detecting any distinctive oatmeal presence. Again, this is not a bad brew by any means, but I kind of feel that the oat flavors should have been more pronounced."

"Overall- I haven't had too many beers of this style, but after this one I'm ready to try some more. Great flavor and easy to drink is always a winning combination!"
""
"O- Complex, toasty, warming, awesome."
""
""
""
""
""

"O- Not a whole lot going on with this one but it's a good kind of simple."

"This porter is a very dark brown and exhibits a redness in certain lights. The head is also quite persistent and there is significant lacing. The smell is basic roasted malt. The taste begins with the previously noted burnt hops flavor and has served real malt and sweetness thereafter. Surprisingly light-bodied. Not bad, lighter and more drinkable than most porters."

"Overall: a great mix of roasty, fruity, and bold flavors that finishes smooth and crisp. A great late fall quaff that can be either sipped or gulped."

"I haven't been that into really dark beers recently, but man am I glad my girlfriend brought a handful back from the east coast. This is a fantastic porter. So rich and flavourful. The roasted malt really shines without being overly bitter or dry to the point of disgust. It is just right. The punch of oatmeal goes well with it, also adding plenty of flavour potency without hitting that thin line of excess. I haven't had a lot of porters this year, so I don't have a lot of specific flavour notes to assess. I only got one 12 oz bottle of this particular brew. Just trust me, it's awesome. If you're ever within their distribution area, pick up a bottle."

"Wow, for all of the scent that wasn't there it was apparently sitting in the taste. Tasty charred malt, chocolate malt flavor, touch of coffee and roasted oats. Very well balanced and super amooth this is a nice surprise."

"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a mahogany brown color with a half inch tan head that stayed around for a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. The aroma is nice and sweet, the brew smells like roasted malt, chocolate, oatmeal, and a bit of dark fruit. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some coffee and some bitter hops in there too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's well carbonated and enjoyable to drink. I thought this was a good brew, I'd buy it again. $1.99 for a single bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The first time I had this on tap I really enjoyed it and wanted to try but again. It's just as good as the first time. Really great roasty malt with sugar and bitterness to round out a nice oatmeal porter. This is my first oatmeal porter but I'm eager to enjoy more. Cheers!"
""

"Poured 12 Oz bottle into a Sam Adams glass. Mahogany brown with a longer lasting creamy tab head that leaves nice lacing. Aroma is malty with notes of caramel and a little fruit. Taste is nice with a nice blend of the malt road rinses dialed back by the oatmeal. Has a bit of a fizziness to it but is otherwise nice and smooth."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer was ""advertised"" as very malty with hints of chocolate which I would have liked, but they were a bit too subtle for me in this beer. I wouldn't turn this beer down, but neither would I search it out again."

"Poured from bottle into snifter glass. The color was used motor oil blackish brown, letting in no light. Absolute wondeful smell: Chocolate and coffee mixed with just enough hop scent. Had me drooling when I popped the cap. Very satisfying taste - every scent was present and blended wonderfully. Mouthfeel was a little thinner than I expected but again, the taste and smell more than made up for that. Overall, this is definitely a beer I'd revisit time and again!"
"Pours very dark, with a nice khaki head. reveals ruby redness when held to a light. Smells good, chocolate, and coffee notes, malty. The mouthfell is alot thinner than i expected, but not bad. Its smooth, slightly creamy. The chocolate notes are on the palate as well as the nose but the coffee notes arent that strong. Its malty. Sweet, but not too sweet. You taste the hops a little. Overall: great brew in my opinion. I give this high praises. For the style, it was great. Wonderful with my meal. I enjoyed this beer"
"a deep brown/black pour, finger of tan head, nice amount of lacing. smells of grapes, dark roasted grains, coffee. a wonderful tasting porter. this is almost stout-like, lots of coffee and chocolate flavors, dark roasted grains, the oats are present in the mouthfeel for sure.. you can tell when it's a heavier mouthfeel that the good ol' oat has been involved! medium body, thick fr a porter, good amount of carbonation. an excellent beer for its style. great taste and great feel. definitely an underdog you don;t ever hear about."
"O - one of my favorite porters, preferably on tap. The bottle version is recommended."
""
"I have actually tried this several times, both from a tap and from the bottle. I will say I think it's better on draught."
""
""
""
""
""
"I loved this beer, however I am impartial to porters. Aroma's were oaky and malty, but the mouthfeel was very crisp and refreshing to me. Had a nice, toasty, dark appearance with a one finger head. I'd like to try this on draught. It's been a few weeks since I've had it but i remember enjoying it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This offering pours up a deep opaque black with a nice one finger tan head and plenty of spiderweb like lacing left behind. The smell is kind of faint. All I could really perceive was a kind of nebulous hard to define freshness. Taste is very nice. I picked up an initial malty sweetness along with cola, carame, and coffee. The finish is a nice balanced coffee, and chocolate. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. This is a very nice offering. I'd drink it again easily!!!"
"Poured from a growler I picked up in Greenwood, SC at Corley's Market. Pours an almost jet black with ruby highlights, nice rocky tannish frothy head with lacing ringing the glass after every sip. Nice roasty aroma with a faint spicy hop background. Taste is medium bodied with a silky smooth finish from the oats. A little subdued for a porter in my opinion, but nice maltiness with hints of chocolate and caramel, some hops detectable on the back end. Silky smooth and easy to drink. I think I will have another."
""
""
""
"O: A solid no-frills hoppy porter. This isn't a world beater, but I'd buy a 6 pack of it given a limited selection at a store."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The alcohol in this beer is pretty well hidden and the lighter body/flavors makes this beer easy to drink. Enjoyable flavors with just enough complexity to make me want to have another of these."

"O - a tasty hoppy, sweet porter. Not bad."
"I seem to forget about Highland when I'm in the beer store, but am always happy each time I come back to it."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"overall a very enjoyable porter. one of, if not the best, of highlands year round offerings."
""
"O: This oatmeal stout just missed the mark. It did not have much sweetness or grainy, dark roasted bitterness and coffee-like flavors. And, the hops just did not seem to fit the malts. It was not a bad experience, but it just did not work together for me. But, the tasty oatmeal did go some way toward redeeming this beer for me. It is a good and solid offering in the oatmeal porter and stout style, but it just did not make it to the top tier."
"Overall- Pretty good, a few tweaks could really bring this one over the top. Oatmeal character could use a little more uumph, but it's noticeable and a nice take on a hoppy porter. Worth trying, and I'd pick it up again if I saw it."
""
""
"O= This is a great beer. I love a porter and I love oatmeal stouts. This is the best of both worlds. The sweetness is a little different but this is a nice mix. Seek this beer out."
"O: Excellent oatmeal porter ‚Äì nicely blended give great flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
"Dark brown, medium head, medium retention. Some lacing. Charred and acidic aroma with elements of dark fruit, mostly prunes. Tart and dark with some roast toward the end and a generally clean finish. Medium body, high carbonation. Drinkable and certainly not a bad beer. However, it will have a hard time standing out."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured from bottle into pint glass. A nice deep brown, nearly black pour with a generous 2 finger tan head. Smell was very coffee up front with a bit of chocolate and wood quality. Taste was where this was a bit disappointing. Comes off very strong coffee and a bit metalic. Almost no oatmeal quality IMO. More like a stout than porter. Taste is somwhat distracting with some burnt wood notes. Feel is a bit dry and stout like with some cream at the end. Overall- It's an okay/average beer. The taste was the biggest letdown. Too metalic and woody. Heavy coffee like a stout. Worth a try, but I won't be back-"
"Overall I'm not in love with it, but I don't really have anything negative to say about it either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- very drinkable porter, even sessionable. Not quite as strong as I prefer but would try it again."
""
"Overall ‚Äì It had a really nice look and smell, but the taste was a little too dry and simple with a mouthfeel that could use some more thickness. While not bad it is a brew I wouldn‚Äôt go to on occasion."
""
""
""
"Pours an almost jet black, nice tannish frothy head. Nice roasty smell. Taste is medium to heavy bodied, great silky smooth texture to it. A little subdued on taste, but nice maltiness with hints of chocolate and caramel, some hops detectable on the back end. Smooth and easy to drink, great drinkability."
""
"Almost a black pour, it is covered by a fading tan head. Mostly roast focused nose where biscuity, but burnt dark malts lean more towards chocolate than coffee. Nutty and leafy/earthy on the palate. The oatmeal contributes a certain roundness on this semi-thick ale with moderate carbonation. A competent dark ale, but more like a stout than a porter. Lacks a little maltiness. Finishes clean."
""
""
"This is a decent porter with some really good characteristics, but it's also a little bland in the flavor department (probably the most important aspect, in my opinion). It's worth trying, but it's not one of my favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I think this beer is ok, I picked it up in a mixed 12 and will enjoy the remainder but probably wouldn't spring for this again."
"Overall damn decent beer. Of course I tend to have an affinity for smooth drinking porters. Oats and a bit more of a hopping than you'd expect are what set this one apart. Would gladly have this porter again, it's quite nice."

"O- a very well made oatmeal American styled porter. Definitely recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not exactly thick and savory. Better flavor as it warms up, more malt sweetness and hop bite. Good roasty noes and nice hop balance. Not a classic example, could use a bit more malt character. Quite a good brew nonetheless."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a dark brown with a one inch white head, that leaves behind some lace. Smell is chocolate, biscuit, carmel, smoke, and some tobacco. Taste is the same intensity, with chocolate and carmel coming threw most, flavor is simple, but tasty. Body is medium for its size, nice carbonation, not dry, and drinkability is good. This is a nice porter, not earth shattering."

"O - Solid porter, and was great with my meal. Kind of a lighter version of Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Porter."
""
""
"Overall Impression- Maybe its just me, but I couldn't find much oatmeal at all in this one! Very sweet and roasty but just couldn't find this characteristic. Would say this is a nice Porter and very well balanced. Recommend if available!"
""
""
"Overall: It's a solid oatmeal porter, better than average, but nothing amazing."
""
""
"Overall - This was my first brew from the Highland Brewing Company thanks to a good friend of mine who brought me some from out of state (thx Wendell!). I was impressed with the drinkablity of this brew as it wasn't too bitter, not too heavy, and promoted a nice roasty, chocolaty taste throughout. Might be a little better with more of an oat profile, but overall a very nice brew!"
""
"Overall: A solid porter. I've had a billion of these going back probably 15 years, including many $8 pitchers poured into plastic cups at Hell in Chapel Hill. Seemed like a good choice for the UNC-Duke game. Glad its distributed in VA now."
"Overall, pretty decent. Not quite as roasty and chocolatey as I was expecting based on the nose but a decent interpretation of the style."
"This is a very tasty porter and possibly one of my favourites in this style."

"O - I've been wanting to try this one for awhile and Deuane was able to hook me up...this was a very drinkable porter...the hops were surprisingly forward, but the oats kept everything happy"

"Pours a very dark brown, has a big thick head to it. This has a great roasted coffee and chocolate taste, seems to have a moderate level of hops. Average level of carbonation with a thick, full-bodied feel to it, very filling. A nice porter, it looks and tastes like a great example of the style, without being too strong with hops or alcohol taste. I would definitely try this one again."

"O - Nice and easy drinking Porter, could use more robust flavoring and mouthfeel"

"Highland Oatmeal Porter has an appearance typical of a good example of the style. I particularly enjoyed the complex aroma, in which I detected sweet cream, malt sugar, cinnamon, some hop, and lightly toasted grain. What really surprised me was that the taste was a lot hoppier than I expected for the style and the aroma as well. I would have awarded a higher score if not for the lighter body and a bit of a metallic/oxidized off flavor in the finish."
"Oatmeal Porter is a good release from Highland Brewing Company. It‚Äôs relatively simple and straight forward. But, it has a nice flavor and is all-around pretty impressive. I‚Äôd prefer a little more body, but that‚Äôs about the only complaint I have. It‚Äôs good stuff. Definitely worth checking out."
""
""
""
"O - Very good porter from Highland with ABV well hidden, smooth and enjoyable overall. I would highly recommend it."
""
""

"O: Overall, pretty good. I'd even recommend it for parties or company or such. That is to say, where I don't see my self seeking one out to kick back with, I'd pick up a six-pack to share."
"O: The smell is my favorite part, the taste is pretty good too. I'd like it a lot more if the mouthfeel were a little better. Would probably have another if I came across one."
"O- I really like this beer. It doesn't always seem to have that metallic note to it, and that's why I docked it a .5 for the taste. I will revisit another bottle and change the score if better. Either way, this is a pretty tasty porter."
"Ignoring the diacetyl notes: This beer is rather one dimensional and a little thin. It's pleasing, overall. I'll try it again, and I'll probably be back to edit this review if the off flavors aren't there next time."
"Overall: I really enjoy this beer when I'm in the mood for a porter. I'd recommend it to a friend."
"12 ounce bottle, no bottle date. Pours crystal clear dark brown color with a small fairly dense 1 finger light tan head with good retention that reduces to a thin lacing cap. Aromas of caramel, chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, oats, and some spicy hops. Some nice and decently strong aromas here. Taste of big roasted malt, chocolate, oats, spicy hops, and caramel. Nice amount of bitterness present on the finish; with lingering notes of spicy hops, caramel, and chocolate. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly nice and creamy mouthfeel despite slightly high carbonation. Decent balance of flavors as well, but spiciness seems to take the prominence. No alcohol noticed except for a small warming after the finish. Overall a solid and drinkable porter, but definitely not memorable."
"Roast and chocolate carry to the taste of the beer, particularly up front. More of a baker's chocolate follows and with a light bitterness to conclude. Feel is a bit thin however to really pull it off. Offers a pleasant lingering finish. Overall decent though a bit thin and unassuming."
"Overall (3.5): Maybe I was expecting too much from this beer, maybe it was old or I didn‚Äôt have a great bottle. Either way, it was decent. I bet this would be a satisfying session on cask, but I wouldn‚Äôt go out of my way to buy a sixer of this. Not bad, not great."
"O- Pretty good porter. Seems to have a little more bitterness than some other porters."
"Drinkability is pretty good, a tasty stout with a nice hop snap, I always dig the English nobles."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice creamy and silky texture towards the finish. Carbonation is moderate. Overall it was a pretty solid beer that I really enjoyed. Very nice roasty bitter character with a great mouthfeel."
"Thanks to Illudium for the sample!"
"Overall, a solid brew that is drinkable anytime, including breakfast."
"O - Meh. My roommate brought this home with him after a visit to NC and I was interested in giving it a try. It is drinkable and has a few nice qualities, but not overwhelming or memorable."
"Pours a dark brown with a thin off-white head that fades to a slight haze. Subdued aromas of chocolate, toasted oats, coffee, and roasted malt. Taste is close to the nose, nice flavors of chocolate, caramel, and roasted nut. Very nice and drinkable. Mouthfeel is smooth and fairly creamy, with a medium-thin body and good carbonation. Overall a very solid Porter, the oatmeal adds a very nice creaminess."
"Overall: smooth, not a lot of aroma. Its an ok porter but not going to be getting this one again."
"{revisited in June 2013}"
"OVERALL: There was no bottle date on this one, so I‚Äôm not sure what to think. In any case, the beer I have in my hand is nothing worth remembering. It‚Äôs not off-putting or anything, there just isn‚Äôt anything to remember. Too mild in flavor and aroma. This would need some serious beefing up to bring it on par with some of the top example of the style. Avoid this one I‚Äôd say."
"Overall a very solid beer. Probably not quite as good as some of the others I have had from Highland."
"I like this one, nothing like a good porter on a rainy summer day."
"A good beer all in all but I don't like the sherry notes it's providing, it dominates a good portion of the taste. But overall it is a solid dark brew."
"Bottle poured into Samuel Adams Perfect Pint glass provided a dark almost black color with aroma of malt. Roasted malt, oats, and chocolate with some coffee flavor. One and a half finger beige head dissipated rather quickly without leaving much lacing. Excellent porter with wonderful flavor, smell and finish. A lucky find at my local Kroger supermarket."
"O - A very nice porter and not too filling."
"I used to drink this often when I lived in upstate S.C., just found it today in Destin. Pours dark brown into a pint glass. Thick head with really sticky lacing. Sweet, smoky, malty, milky nose with a touch of cappuccino. Taste is sweet up front with a full malty, espresso punch and a surprise of hop bitterness. Full, milky mouthfeel, not too carbonated, with a slightly bitter aftertaste. A good all around porter."
"Eminently flavorful and redolent of vanilla, and chocolate roast malt, Highliand Oatmeal Porter is silky and medium-bodied on the tongue. Topped with a rocky persistent tan head and dripping with roasty malt character, this porter was slightly sweet and finished on a dark chocolate note. Hop character is present, but very well balanced with the roasty malt profile."
"This beer is quite dark, even for the style, as only a smidgen of red appears at the bottom of the glass. The head didn't stick around for as long as I would have liked, but I'm not going to ding the beer too much for that. The smell is a bit faint, although I do detect some sweetness, almost certainly from the oats. The taste is not as sweet as I'd suspect, however, as I get a lot more roasty (almost smokey or even chalky) malt than oat sweetness. With each passing sip, I get a some hop bitterness, although not a large amount. I enjoyed this brew, but a little more sweetness from the oats would make me enjoy it a lot more."
"It‚Äôs the ideal, full flavored porter, I‚Äôm not really sure why it‚Äôs not considered a stout."
"Medium boded and very roasted, almost burnt tasting with an overly carbonated mouthfeel up front. Slightly smokey with hints of chocolate, caramel, nut and of course oatmeal. Slightly watered down and a bit too bitter for my liking with a dry finish. Decent but not something I would seek out again."
"O: Everything could work together a lot better. This would be better if it were bigger beer."
"A fairly average porter, nothing incredibly special but worth drinking a 6-pack of. Give it a shot."
"This one pours a deep brown with a tiny head that doesn't retain very well. The aroma is a bit hard to coax out, and when I do I get some oatmeal sweetness and some roasted malts. The taste on this is fairly interesting. I'm having this very fresh, and the hops are fairly prevalent, interacting with the sweet oatmeal and roasted malts in interesting ways. It never quite smooths out to a nice porter taste though, it just stays pretty jumbled. The mouthfeel is pretty light and highly carbonated, and the drinkability is alright. Overall, I think this one's a bit confused. Not the best beer, but still servicable."
"Very smooth, rich and approachable porter. Sweet and dark chocolate with oatmeal, coffee, toasted nuts, and some earthy notes of hops make up the aroma. The taste is mild chocolate, roasted coffee, oatmeal, sweet caramels, notes of vanilla nd nuts. Very smooth, creamy, mild and approachable porter. The drinkability is very high. Easy to drink. Delicious and well balanced beer."
"Really liked this one, very balanced flavor."
"O: This is tasty, albeit not super complex, and it's easy to find here and relatively cheap."
"I think this is a pretty standard quality oatmeal porter, nothing amazing, but good none the less."
"Overall I thought this was a good porter. As far as porters go this one was on the lighter side of the spectrum but it still retained those good porter flavors, just lighter then most. What I liked most about this beer was it's look and drinkability and the only thing I would tweak would be the thickness. I might be inclined to get a six pack on a warmer summer day when I want something darker but still light and drinkable, but I don't think it is sold in Michigan so I doubt I will be getting more anytime soon. If you like porters then this might be up your alley, just think drinkable not robust."
"It's too light in color, too thin, not chocolately enough, undercarbonated, too dry. It just doesn't taste as full in flavor or body as I would have wanted. Not bad, but undeserving of this aggregate score."
"I really like this beer a lot. I could drink it year round, I'm glad I picked it up in TN when I was there. I'd get it again if it were in the Boston area. Thanks to the guys at Beardon Beer Market for the recommendation!"
"Enjoy!"
"Brown head with with nice head retention. Beer is dark brown, almost black, slight highlights of red when held up to light. Full-bodied and richly-flavored while still being smooth. Not as intense as many other porters. I think the presence of the oatmeal mellows it out. I would like to see more Porters with an Oatmeal presence, like Stouts (My Favorite), ...I like it. So far the best I have had from Highland"
"Overall this is a once try for me. It need more of everything; taste, smell, etc... What it has is good though and its easy to sip and mindlessly enjoy."
"This beer pours a dark brown with reddish edging against the light. Decent tan head that was not retained for very long. Slippery lacing. Roasted malt smell, faint herbal grassiness. Taste was pretty average for the style. You do pick up the graininess of the oatmeal but it isn't the star. Mixed in was a grassy hop presence and some bittersweet chocolate. Mouthfeel was thin and semi-dry. Overall this is an okay Porter. I would have liked to seen/tasted the oatmeal profile a little better."
"Poured a mostly clear brown. Seemed light in color but is dark brown in the glass, with thin khaki colored head, spotty lace. Smell: herbal and leafy hopping, light roasted grain, tannins. Taste: solid herbal hopping with slight citric acidity, just a little chocolate syrup, oatmeal. Decent hopping, but not particularly interesting."
"A little more roasty burnt malt flavor than I was expecting from a brown oatmeal porter, but a nice drinkable beer. Slightly high alcohol for a session beer but not overly so. Very nice porter."
"O - Very drinkable beer here and one that was revisited several times that night. Nice surprise from a brewery I really don't know all too much about."
"Despite the dryness of this one, it really is a pretty drinkable porter; really got to fight the urge to pound this one. Another strong effort from the always reliable Highland brewery."
"Overall, a nice beer, and ridiculously drinkable. I was 1/3 through the review when I realized the glass was 3/4 empty. Can be fairly inconsistent in bottle format, but nice nonetheless when you get a good bottle."
"The beer appears a deep, dark shade of brown with about a half inch of light tan head. Ample lacing is visible throughout the glass. The aroma brings malt, lightly roasted. The flavor begins creamy, roasty, and malt forward but takes an unexpected turn with a blast of hop bitterness in the back half. While not entirely unpleasant, I feel that the hop presence is a bit overdone and detracts from the roast, chocolate and oatmeal flavors. Speaking of oatmeal, the presence of oats is rather subtle, and could stand to be brought to the forefront a bit more. Overall, a decent beer and worth a try."
"Poured dark brown with a slight red tint and had a creamy light brown head that lasted throughout and had excellent lacing. The aroma was robust with roasted chocolate malts, a sweet yeast and had notes of dark chocolate, oats and coffee. It tasted mildly sweet with a nice coffee note at the start and ended with a sweet-bitter chocolate flavor that had a mild coffee undertone and just a hint of hoppiness that stayed with you for a nice while. Mouthfeel was medium to full in body and creamy in texture with a soft carbonation. Overall a extremely good tasting Porter."
"Poured black with deep ruby hues in the light. Light beige head that yielded nice lacing. Aroma is very straight forward: toasted biscuit, some burnt grain, hint of toffee, and coffee. Rather one dimensional but still good nonetheless. I don't really have much to say about the flavor, aside from it tastes just like how it smells, with a little bit more sweetness than roastiness. Smooth and well carbonated, but not too prickly. A nice everyday drinker."
"Thanks to wahmaster for bringing some of this stuff up from Virginia to share."
"D: The lack of oatmeal character in this beer was quite disappointing. It really lacked the usual smooth and full mouthfeel that oatmeal provides."
"Overall, an interesting mix. Seemed to be a cross between a roasted porter, and an oatmeal stout, which I would assume it what they were going for with this one."
"D: A drinkable beer, but not one worth seeking out. If you like over-roasted coffee then you might want to give it a try."
"Easily drinkable for me because it was easy to go down without such a big taste. Although because of this, I'm not too quick to pick it back up. I like a bolder flavor in my dark beers."
"O - A darn delicious porter. Would be quite sessionable if the ABV dropped 1%."
"Pours a near black color with a deep tan head that falls slowly to a thick blanket. The nose is light roast, some chocolate, hint of molasses and you can get a sense the smoothness of the oats. The taste is Rich and sweet roasted malt up front. Really smooth and wet to begin with then the slightly dry roastyness comes in. A little char on the aftertaste. The body is medium and silky smooth. Carbonation is south of medium. Overall this is a smooth and tasty porter."
"D - Pleasant, easy sipping porter with unique character."
"After an aggressive pour, this brew ended up about a 3/4 inch tan head that quickly receded to half that, with some thick, sticky lacing left behind on the glass. Pretty dark looking, almost black with nice red hue. Aroma is nutty and grainy, some chocolate and a slight bit of coffee with a touch of hops. Has a real malty backbone, nice roasted profile with some nutty characteristics noted, possibly the oatmeal giving it this unique twang. Biscuity malt feel to it, thick on the mouthfeel, nice smooth after taste with a touch of bitterness. Some interesting hoppiness shines through on this one as well, bit of christmas tree pine blends in with the light and dry bakers chocolate flavor nicely. Carbonation is just about right, bit on the high side but it accents the beer well. Nice aftertaste noticed, slightly bitter with a touch of hops. Overall, this is a good beer, full of flavor, nicely balanced."
"Deep, dark brown (but not really black). The tan head leaves thick rings of lace down the glass. Smell of sweet malts, roasted grains, a bit of coffee-like bitterness. Good flavor. Sweet, but not overly so, roasted malt. Coffee, cocoa, chocolate are present but not overpowering. Creamy smooth, full body but not as heavy as an oatmeal stout. Smooth, highly drinkable porter. Thumbs up."
"Drinkability: The beer was very easy drinking, and would be willing to go back for more."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a New Belgium globe. Half finger of toffee colored thin head with very little retention. Aroma is on the light side but consists of milk chocolate, some oatmeal of course and a hint of brown sugar. At first taste my impression is that the beer is too thin, but then I remember to concentrate on the taste. It's much drier than I would have thought. The beer is described to be very malty, but I'm not getting the same impression as it doesn't balance well with the bitterness really. Roasted chocolate on the palate with a touch of bread. Mouthfeel is too thin, but even with the lack of carbonation and balance the beer is one I might pick up once in a while if I'm in the mood for a porter and the choices aren't remarkable."
"Overall, slightly disappointed by this one given my friends' review. It's very atypical to any porters that I've had with ""Oatmeal"" attached to it, and it's highly carbonated, yet thin body is unappealing. It's taste isn't the worst; it just doesn't have the loving taste of a microbrew."
"Verdict: This is a great beer for nearly all beer drinkers. Those who fear venturing into porter territory will be pleased to note this beer's subtle qualities and flavor provide a well balanced taste and little mouth pain in the finish with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Therefore, this could be a star candidate for light beer drinkers but lacking to one or two who prefer bolder flavor. Being a porter fan myself, I'd say that this is certainly an excellent candidate regardless should it be available in your supermarket to try. You've got nothing to lose. A- (4.15)"
"D: a smooth drinking, filling porter. A little too filling and the carbonation made for some excess belching"
"D: The beer is quite drinkable because it isn't that filling and doesn't have a high amount of alcohol content. Drinking more than one of these at a time wouldn't be that difficult."
"D--Very solid for its style. What can I say, I have been spoiled by big beers, but certainly very decent beer..."
"m/d-overall, a bit thin and watery, but not over the top. easy drinker, but leaves a bit to be desired. not the thickness that I'd expect from a beer with the word oatmeal on it."
"D: An average porter... despite the acridity, it does manage some level of smoothness, but overall not something I'll be picking up again anytime soon."
"D - This is a nice porter. Drinkable for sure. Get some drink some!"
"Drinkability: This beer is super solid -- the weight isn't very heavy and the ABV is quite moderate at under 6%, nothing wrong with making this one a session beer; the slight sweetness balanced with the nutty and roasty flavors would also make this a great after-dinner beer; hats off to Highland, this is a great offering."
"D - I wish that I was not tasting at lunch....I would have ordered another one or two. A very good and drinkable beer"
"D - Light for a porter, I would say drinkable because of its medium body, easy to go down, one of the better Highland Beers"
"D - This is a fairly acrid porter, verging on a stout. I don't detect the positive characteristics usually given by oatmeal. Not a bad beer, but not a great example."
"D: On vacation last year to the Smokies, my wife and I drank tons of Highland stuff, and for that, the brewery will forever be nostalgic to me. In the two 12-packs that we siphoned down over the span of our awesome vacation, the Oatmeal Porter was one of our favorites (along with the Black Mocha Stout). I will definitely revisit this brew again from time to time."
"Aroma. The perfect balance of roasty roasty malts...love it. Notes of some semi-sweet chocolate, oats and rye. As the glass gets lower, it appears to be a deep deep brown color with a streak of burgundy. Taste consists of sweet roasted malt (maybe some lactose?), brewing licorice, and a semi-bitter aftertaste. Light to medium bodied beer. Okay. Very impressive porter. I would consider this a session beer. And would love some more of this. Thanks again to 'cwguy5' for this extra!"
"Very drinkable porter, I could see this one getting me into trouble. A great choice if you're in the mood for a dark beer, but don't want to go all the way with a stout."
"Edit: I find myself coming back to this porter all the time. It is fast becoming my favorite American porter."
"OVERALL: Smooth and easy to drink for a Porter. Not being as oily and creamy was a plus in my book. For someone who prefers the hops and bubbles of an IPA this one is outside my comfort zone, but was still a very good beer. A challenge every once in a while is a good thing."
"d - A very easy drinking porter that focuses a lot on its roasted malts. Very solid, would definitely drink again."
"D- Could drink this all night. It's an ideal session porter. Very enjoyable!"
"D- This is a good but not great one for me. I enjoyed it, but it just lacked a certain punch."
"D-Ok. Easy drinking mild beer."
"D) Good drinkability. Good example of a easy-going porter."
"Very drinkable. A very nice brew."
"Another happy encounter at the Mellow Mushroom in Greensboro, NC, this one has a dark black brown appearance with a decent light tan head and great lacing. The aroma suggests a very mild chocolate yeast. Kind of weak but pleasant for what you can sniff out of it. The flavor offers a slightly sour charcoal malt and yeasty lime. It's medium bodied with very tiny carbonation, somewhat silky with a dry charcoal, sweet licorice finish. I don't get much toward the oatmeal idea, mostly tart, tangy ideas. It's pretty drinkable stuff though, a tad thin, but generally a good porter very much worth a try."
"M- Maybe a bit thin and over carbonated but its still pretty enjoyable."
"It isn't. It's slightly sweet but it's actually quite good! I was getting down for a second. Has a good sweet chocolatey flavor that is rounded out with a bit of a good bold coffee taste and dark roasted malts. I'm actually really into this one. Thanks to the oatmeal, the mouthfeel is very smooth and silky. It's a bit thick and syrupy, but overall, it's really quite nice. Definitely one I'll enjoy drinking and would mind stumbling over a couple more of these."
"Overall, I was a fan of this. Another good offering from Highland Brewing."
"I am not convinced that this is truly a porter and not a stout, but I enjoyed it very much. It seems like it would be tint on the boarder of porter/stout guidelines."
"medium mouthfeel, medium carbonation, light."
"All in all, this is a decent brew. Not great, but just ok. There are many better in the style. It's a good solid beer if it distributes to your area and you're looking for an easy drinker. Otherwise, don't bother trading for this brew."
"I guess I could drink this... but why bother?"
"Pretty hoppy for an oatmeal brew, lots of pine-needle bitterness. Roastiness accentuates that and it lacks the creamy smoothness I have experienced in most of the other Highland offerings I have had (Gaelic, Black Mocha and Cold Mountain). I dont get much oatmeal in the mouthfeel or flavor either. Ok beer, but far from HBC's best by a country mile."
"A decent porter. Nothing to throw rocks at."
"The best Highland beer I've tried to date, this is a better than average Oatmeal Stout. I'm looking forward to trying their mocha stout now..."
"Overall, a fairly average porter. Decent drinkability. I didn't really get the oatmeal part of this."
"Pours a deep brown from the bottle allowing for a single finger of ecru head. The aromas are nott too telling for such a flavorful beer. The taste explodes with coffee, bittersweet chocolate, nuts, and oats. The flavors are many and all complementary of one another. The taste of this porter is big on all fronts and pleasant all the way down to faint taste of alcohol that gives the porter its warming effect. The bittersweet chocolate finishes the beer on the pallet. This porter has a richness that I expected more from a stout but the brew is not thick. The balance in the flavors is mirrored in the body and the overall drinkability of the porter is really good."
"D - Nice and smooth. Knocked back 3 in fairly quick succession and could easily have downed the other 3 with no trouble."
"Drinkability: A decent enough porter. While there's nothing that makes this porter stand out in particular, it's altogether well-rounded and a pleasure to drink."
"Good stuff. Lots of scents and flavors, a crisp mouthfeel, and not overpoweringly alcoholic, I'm glad I've got 12 of these."
"It seems like a good basic porter offering. Not much more, or less."
"Overall, a very nice porter and one that will make its way back in my fridge many times."
"Overall, I love this porter. It got me into the style and for me it will always be a go to porter. I highly recommend this beer."
"D-This is a really nice, deep, somewhat complex beer and I'm glad I had the chance to try it. It held up pretty well to being paired with a cigar."
"D: Love this beer, but could only drink a few at a time because they are so filling."
"Pours a dark brown with beautiful ruby highlights when held to light. Smallish off white head dissipates quickly. Smells of chocolate, roast, citrus hops, and licorice, mmm. Taste is chocolate up front, some dark fruit and licorice midway melding into a citrusy roasty finish. Creamy smooth mouthfeel, light carbonation and medium body. Great drinkable porter here! If these were more available to me I would buy them all the time."
"D - This would make a superb session beer but the complexity would make it difficult for me to have several in a night"
"That this bottle is fresh is confirmed by the rather aggressive hop character up front. Fresh citrus with a moderate bitterness and a little orange dominate the palate, almost covering up everything else there is here. There's some dark chocolate bitterness, along with a roasted grain character. In all honesty, though, the hops are what dominate the beer, covering up the oatmeal even.As I drink this, and my palate gets used to the hop character, I'm struck by how excellent the roasted grain bitterness is, it's pretty spot on for my palate, strong but not overshadowing everything else. Not as nice as it smells, this beer has a nice finish, dry and roasty with the hop and grainy bitterness working quite harmoniously. A touch overcarbonated, which results in the expected oatmeal smoothness being taken away, this beer is solid. At a relatively low ABV, this is an easy drinking porter, one I'd love to try on cask. Despite my dislike for overly-hopped porters, this is still very enjoyable"
"Average in the extreme."
"On tap poured into a Highland pint glass at the Mellow Mushroom in Asheville. Dark brown, almost black with 1/4 inch that quickly dissipates to a slight cloud on top. Some lacing throughout. Nutty roasted almond smell. Hoppy bitterness is evident with a black cappucino presence, but not overly thick or heavy. I like to have one or two of these on occasion when going out for dinner but I don't like it enough to buy a sixer. All in all it's a decent beer from a good local brewery."
"D: The mouthfeel is what really does it for me in this beer. The taste is a little less polished than some others I've had, but it's still a great example of a smooth, roasty porter."
"quite drinkable. if i had another bottle, it would be in danger."
"Beautiful dark rich color when poured from the bottle. About an inch of foamy rich head as well. You can smell the dark roasted malts in this one and just a light touch of hops. First taste gives an initial nutty/chocolate taste which slowly melts into a coffee like aftertaste. Lightly carbonated to perfection as the mouthfeel is great. Wish I would have bought more than one of these in my mix pack."
"D - this is an extremely drinkable beer. Very nice flavor profile, well-balanced...just a solid porter. Definitely on the sweeter side of the porter spectrum, but it works really well for this beer. I really wish Highland was in Missouri, so far I have been really impressed by this brewery."
"Good flavor, good porter, but not terribly robust..."
"The other Highlands were weaker, but this one shows merit. I usually don't go out of my way to get a porter, but this would be a good choice."
"Its a good porter for your money"
"I look forward to trying more from this brewery."
"Served from tap into a standard pint. Pours a dark dark dark brown almost black with a one finger light tan head. Maintains nice lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of nutty and malt notes. The flavor was of coffee, oatmeal, and malt. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very nice porter. The flavors were quite a nice blend and none were overpowering as to mask the other. Glad that I have been sending this out to quite a few of my beer traders as extras."
"Mouthfeel was full and rich, slightly slick from the oatmeal, I guess. Decent carbonation. This is an easy to drink beer. One I'll buy again & again because it is so easy to drink."
"Poured from a brown bottle into a SA perfect pint glass. It appears a dark brown color that has some pretty decent clarity and a dark ruby red color when held up to the light. Head appears a finger strong with a nicely tanned color that doesnt retain all that well but clings in patchy lace about the glassware. Nose is a mixture of dark grains that present themselves with notes of coffee and a smokey burnt grain character. Taste has a smokey burnt grain character a bit like coffee, dark chocolate and some of the grainy character comes through a bit sweet before the bitter dark grain finish that has a noticeable amount of alcohol warmth for less than 6%. As it warms, there is some fruity character that comes out in the flavor like dark skinned fruit, a bit like plum or raisins. The nose also includes some dark burnt grain sweetness like molasses with a very faint touch of hops. Medium body is quite smooth and moderately carbonated. This ranks up there as very drinkable with a nicely balanced aroma and flavor profile. I would have no problems drinking this on a regular basis."
"Highland never fails to impress"
"Pours a big three finger plus head without much effort, mostly fine microfoam with just about average retention, light tan coloration, excellent stickiness to the lacing, coats the sides of the glass. Not quite black just the deepest brown possible to cross into full opacity, glimmer of orange at the rims, muddied appearance overall. Molasses, caramelized brown sugar and honey take the lead in the nose over the ground coffee, dark chocolate elements, the oatmeal is very dry and does not spread broadly, unprocessed grains, orange peel, it's actually more rough and tumble than expected, not necessarily for the worse. Full-bodied, steely and close to immobile, the carbonation tentative like it's on a work release program. Coffee, milk and dark chocolate, mocha, black licorice, oatmeal and a touch of rye. Red grape, cherry, apricot fruit with a stripe of orange citrus lend moderate sweetness. Floral hops breeze by close to the finish. Does smooth out at the end, however, this is no casual sipper and you have to focus to get the last few sips out of the glass."
"forgot how good this homer is...."
"d - great session porter."
"Really easy to drink due to the lighter body--flavor and mouthfeel could be more robust. Not really impressed."
"This beer is pretty dark. After I poured it the head lasted for only a minute or two, and was only a few millimeters thick while it lasted. This has a fairly coffee-like bitterness to its smell, which surprised me since it's an oatmeal porter, which I've always heard helps to smooth out the flavor. The other big smell coming through is some sort toasted malt, very pleasant. On drinking I get a lot of that coffeeish malt flavor, but also some vague smoothness on the after taste, which I suppose might be from the oatmeal. This is a tasty beer, but it might be too heavy to have more than a few in a single session."
"I avoided this beer for years after one ill-fated night that involved lots of this and lots of mead, and now that I've finally given it its long-deserved second chance, I feel kind of bad. Any malt-lover should seek this out, and even those of you inclined to hops; it might surprise you. (For the record, I count myself among the hopheads' numbers.)"
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a brunette with a tan head that went away pretty quickly. The beer had a earthy slell to it. The brew had a tiny bit of a coffee taste but not too strong. Slightly bitter finish but again not too much. I liked the beer and will buy again."
"Overall: Overall it was a very good beer. I'm always found of a good porter though, so I will admit I am biased. However, this beer really delivered for me, which was nice considering the last few I drank disappointed. If you like porters, give this one a try."
"D- This is a very good porter. I'm a big fan of oatmeal stouts and this oatmeal porter just adds more drinkability to a typical oatmeal stout for me. Its medium bodied and very drinkable-the flavor is pretty good-but has a ho-hum tendency to it-making it a hair under ""good"" for me-but everything else about this brew is great. Looking forward to trying others from this brewing company."
"Strong taste of black malt and dryness as typical for an oatmeal porter. There are some hops present in taste, but mostly dark roasty malts with a bit of malt sweetness. There is a very dry crisp finish. A nice porter, but not my favorite. Relatively smooth, high carbonation."
"Overall, this is a very good beer from a brewery that always impresses me. It's very flavorful and very drinkable and would make a great session beer. I'm lucky to live so close to Highland Brewery because they make great beers, and this is just another example as to why."
"Pours a very dark ruby-brown with a light tan bubbly head that leaves a slight bit of lacing behind. The smell is of molasses, brown sugar, figs, dark malts, and a twinge of chocolate. The taste generally follows, with the malts playing a larger role, the chocolate coming through (in a bittersweet way) a bit more, the molasses and sugar floating a bit more into the background, and some oats climbing their way onto the stage. The body is a hefty medium, the carbonation is just right, and, though a bit chewy, the brew flows easily and smoothly across the tongue. Overall, a very tasty, highly drinkable brew."
"A very nice porter! Well worth checking out and grabbing a few bottles."
"Boring, bad, light tasting. Blah."
"D - Superb drinkability; a most righteous offering, indeed. In my opinion this is the best Highland brew of the ones I've tried & nearly the best porter I've had. Recommended."
"Drinks fairly well-no hang ups in this smooth porter."
"drinkability: sessionable stout, like the black mocha better, bit this is also good."
"Overall, this Oatmeal Porter is taking steps in the right direction. I really like all of the flavors that were presented as well as the fairly high drinkability, I just wish they had amped up the flavor a little bit more. All told though, this is a pretty good beer, and my first from this brewery."
"Medium body with a slightly chewy texture. Warming with light effervescence on the tip of the tongue at the start. A good session brew, not too heavy or thick."
"Buy Again? Yes"
"D-this is tasty with a great mouthfeel. a very solid porter especially with the low amounts of alcohol."
"Highland Oatmeal Porter pours a very dark brown with a tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is malty and roasty. The flavor is also malty, roasted flavors and a touch of chocolate are most noticeable. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth. Very drinkable."
"Overall, a smooth, solid Porter."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a dark brown color with a reddish hue, small biege head with a touch of lacing. Aroma is sweet malts with a hint of roasted, oats, chocolate, and vanilla. Flavor is roasted malts, chocolate, vanilla, and oats. Mouthfeel is medium, creamy and finishes with a decent amount of bitterness. Very good, smooth, very drinkable and tasty."
"Poured out nicely. Small layer of head but it dissapated within 30 second. Smelled nice. Had the hints of the sweet oats, but with the toasty backdrop of the roasted chocolately Porter characteristics. The oats fit better in a lighter stout beer, as they seemed to battle with the deep roastiness for my attention. Overall, a good beer. Well crafted. Would be great with some pineapple upside down cake ala mode.... speak of the devil! I love Christmas."
"D: On a cold night this beer really hit the spot. Really great beer. Had a few of their beers recently and I have been impressed."
"Dark brown, tan head. Smells like chocolate, and dark roasted malt. Hops are faintly detectable smelling it. Tastes roasty and with some coffee like bitterness to it. Very little hop bittering. Very well balanced. Somewhat filling I guess, but good enough to drink all night. One of me favs"
"Served on tap at home into a pint glass. Had some issues with a Duck Rabbit Brown keg, exchanged straight up for this Highland keg. Almost black in color, with some slight tints of red. Nice foamy head with lace that sticks to the glass the entire time. Great malty flavor but not overly sweet. Some chocolate flavor but not over done. Carbonation is just right and the beer is quite smooth. I was hesitant to switch to this without really having had tried it before but I am glad I did. This is a really good beer that is quite drinkable. It probably won't be on tap long at my house."
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Dark, ruby in color. Short tan head formed and almost immediately disappeared. Smells of roast malt with hints of chocolate. Tastes the same, with roasted malt and some coffee or chocolate. A bit of a metallic after taste. Mouthfeel is light to medium and very smooth. Not much carbonation. A tastey beer and very easy to drink."
"This is a heartburn beer.... way too boozy for its' abv... you'd think it was an 8percenter...."
"A very good porter, very drinkable and easily sessionable. Highland makes very good brews!"
"Pours a deep, dark-chocolate brown with a bit of amber shining through around the edges and a head that is both cream-colored and texturally creamy. Not much perceptible on the nose other than a mild roasted malt sweetness. The flavor is much more pronounced, and although the lactose-like sweetness is dominant, the roasted, coffee-like nature of the malts and a bit of the earthy oatmeal come through as well. Also, even though the sweetness is the primary component of the flavor, it is not overpowering or artificial. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but overall this is a solid, easy-drinking porter."
"D: A unique and delicious brew with a nice wrinkle on the style with a soft feel, sweet and bitter flavors."
"D: Low ABV and very tasty. Full mouthfeel slows you down just a touch but I could drink this a bunch."
"The oatmeal rounds out the malt in the mouth and the finish dry malt with a hint of choclate."
"Decent brew by a decent brewery."
"drinkability is good. a very smooth and satisfying porter with good concentration and just enough richness to sustain the roasted malts. a very tasty porter. cheers!"
"Definitely one of the best porters I've tasted!"
"D: Decent, but lacking in any sort of unique character."
"This is a good beer. I love the pronounced hops that aren't overbearing in combination with the dark roasted malts."
"Drinkability: As far as I can remember, my first and only oatmeal porter. The oatmeal adds body that helps to push this one into the grey area between porter and stout porter. Overall, a nice drink."
"D: Not a really great beer, perhaps it lost something in transit from VA, but not a favorite."
"The best for last of the variety back. This porter has hints of cinnamon, malts and a slight metallic twang. Pours to a barely translucent deep brown with a small to medium foamy head. Taste is a classic porter with sweetness and bitterness going head to head but neither winning out. Nice balance. Mouthfeel is great. Good viscosity and the carbonation gets the taste stirred up but no more. A little thinner than a classic stout, hitting the style right on. I like this brew. I will be drinking more of this one."
"Drinkability is good for a porter. Although low in abv most porters are so sweet they just don't go down quickly or in big bunches. This is one I could drink plenty of."
"Decent beer, but not worth writing home about."
"This is a pretty good beer, easy to drink, just enough flavor and character to keep you interested, but nothing overwhelming."
"Pours opaque darkness with a shallow loose light tan head that fades fairly quickly leaving stringy patterns of lacing behind. The smell is timid, lightly malted. Lightly carbonated and light bodied the mouth feel cleans up quickly. The roasted malt and coffee flavors suffer from the lack of body. This one isn't far from style, just loosing my taste for porters lately."
"Bottle. Pours a dark, clear brown with a thick tan head. Aroma of sweet malt mostly and some toasted malt notes. Flavor of light sweet malts, some roasted notes and toasted malt but mostly just sweet malt. Hmm, not really a fan of this one. It wasn't bad but it was very sweet. To me, it was more of a brown ale than a porter."
"D: Rather quaffable and tasty. Perhaps a tad to heavy to be a session beer, but it's still really good."
"Asked for this in a recent trade with fsvan and glad I did. This is the third beer of a six pack and I will definitely seek out this one again in a future trade. Poured into a Sam Adams Sensory Glass. Nice looking beer, head dissipates to some nice lacing on the glass. The Smell is minimal at first, but gets better as the beer warms up. Definitely some roasty smells going on. Taste is very nice. Bitter but I love bitter in a Porter with coffee overtones. Mouthful and drinkability also receive high marks. This is my first offering from Highland Brewing but it won't be my last. A very good porter."
"Drinkability: Above average, but it's nothing to write home about. Seems a little light and less flavorful than I'd hoped, especially for the oats that don't seem to be doing enough here to balance the bitterness."
"M&D--Mouthfeel's fine, though a touch watery. Drinkability, again, is not that high for me because if you're going to get near six percent you gotta pack more of a whallop. Either that or or tone down the abv so I can throw back a few of these without feeling it. Would make a fine session ale in that case, but right now there's just too much bite in that dog--and not enough teeth."
"cheers..."
"Ordered a bottle at Patrick Sullivans in Knoxville, TN. Poured a nice black color with a small tan head. Certainly stout-like in appearance. The aromas were great, full of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, etc. Nice and smooth flavors of the above but with hints of vanilla. This is a super drinkable porter that still packs a lot of flavor. This is the first beer I've had from Highland and I cant wait to try more of their beers."
"D - Very drinkable and surprisingly complex. It has a great malt profile that borders on becoming a stout, but never become quite that roasty. The finish is excellent with a great blend of dark malt and enough hops to keep it balanced."
"a good porter overall. unlike MANY i try, there is not much dry charcoal and there is more sweetness. easy to drink."
"Drinkability is quite good. This is a very flavorful porter that is really easy to sip. I could easily have a few of these in one session. Good stuff!"
"While this offering missed the mark for me slightly, it was close enough to make me interested in trying a few more of the brews they offer."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a nonic Imperial pint glass. This porter appears a deep chestnut color with about an inch of thick ecru foam. Smells and tastes of rich roasted grains, caramel, milk chocolate, a touch of coffee beans. Creamy and chewy with ample carbonation. Really nice."
"This is an excellent Porter and the best of several good beers I've had from Highland. Seek it out."
"A dark DARK brown with a one-finger white head that left lace patches. An oatmeal malt and light bready malt arises from the brew, along with some sweet malts but it is all faint and a little odd smelling...?...Coffee and roasted malt taste prevelant in this medium-bodied beer that has some smoothness and sweetness to it. Overall, this is less sweet and a more dry, heavy porter that gravitates towards being a stout. Finishes dry thanks to the above flavors and is added by hints of bitter chocolate and hop bitterness is subdued. This is a good porter but I like my porters to be a little more balanced and mild so I don't think I'd session this."
"all in all, not a bad brew. I could definitely drink a few of these in a row, but at the same time, it's just lacking a bit of pop to push it into the realm of impressive. Definitely solid with some nice roasted and cocoa notes, but the creaminess and fullness I was hoping for just falls a hair short. still solid and worth trying, but didn't blow me away by any means."
"Could benefit from some more oatmeal body"
"D: Not my favorite porter but does have a very nice mouthfeel."
"D - Overall, a good porter, and I love the smell. But where did that alcohol come from? Throws off an otherwise great beer."
"D: I could probably drink a few of these right in a row, but I'd want to go slowly, just out of preference. The beer opens up as it warms, so starting with one at fridge temperature, you have as long as you want to enjoy it. But it's so smooth you could easily guzzle the stuff."
"A pretty interesting concept, I can't ever remember having a oatmeal porter, although it now seems perfectly reasonable. This is another really hearty beer from Highland. I've had 2 of theirs and liked them both quite a bit. I'll have to try and get my hands on more, and soon."
"One of the best porters out there. I was truly surprised and will be seeking out this one again."
"D: This is a great porter. I could easily drink a few of these back to back. I am not a huge fan of porters, but would seek this one out if it was available in my area."
"Drinkability: Either or - session or sipper. If it's really cold out side - session - but not too big of a porter to not be enjoyed in a pleasant climate."
"D - It's pretty easy to drink, but seems a little style-confused. This is my second bottle so I know it's supposed to taste this way. No major knocks, although the aftertaste gets a little fatiguing."
"Notes: I've had lots of Oatmeal Stouts before, and I really love what the oatmeal adds to the sweetness and the smoothness of them, and fortunately it does the same thing to this Oatmeal Porter. This is a really fine brew for such a small company, and it makes me proud to live in North Carolina to have such fine, local beer as this readily available. If you ever come to the North Carolina area do yourself a favor and pick up a six-pack of this stuff; you won't regret it."
"M: very smooth and mellow from the oatmeal. Very bright, creamy, and robust. Good carbonation level."
"This is so incredibly creamy and smooth. It slips down the throat so velvety. My tongue appreciates this beer. Wonderful. Like the smell, the taste on this is weak. I can see what they were trying to do, but they fell short on accomplishment. Hints of roasted coffee, very bready. It's a decent flavor, but nothing that knocked my socks off. Having said all that though, this has got to be one of the more drinkable porters out there. Great mouthfeel. Nothing terrible or astringent about it at all. Recommend."
"D - Another solid brew from Highland. I can't say I've ever been disappointed with anything I've had thus far. This oatmeal porter is certainly no exception. Smooth and flavorful, this went down quite easily."
"Tried this one on tap at Delaney's Irish Pub in Spartanburg, SC. I am ashamed to say this is my first beer by Highland. Not huge in to the porters, but this one was pretty good. Pours a dark, dark brown with tan head. Aroma was nice and sweet...really came alive as the beer warmed. Has a great taste, sweet and chocolately without much bitterness. Not a huge body, somewhere in between your average brown and stout I guess. Good drinkability for a bigger beer as well. Good beer all around! Looking forward to giving their other beers a try."
"d: I'd never heard of this until I pulled it out of a box from joepais. Thanks Joe, this was damn tasty."
"Pours a very dark brown, damn near black. Surprisingly there are quite a bit of hops in the nose. Taste is slightly bitter hops with some roasted ash as well. Medium on the mouthfeel. Quite an easy drinking beer. Very sessionable, but not overly complex at all."
"D - I scored it high, because if you are enjoying a pint or two of this at your local watering hole, then it is very drinkable, however if you are planning on drinking more...it isn't the best for high quantity."
"D - This is a very drinkable porter. The balanced flavor works well and isn't overwhelming in any one area."
"D: Very nice home grown porter. I have always been impressed with Highland and this beer is no exception. There are no overbearing characteristics with this beer. Mellow and very enjoyable from the very first sip to the last."
"This beer pours dark black with a small offwhite head that quickly fizzles away. Smells of sweet malts and oats. Taste follows the smell with roasted malts and ends with bitter chocolate. The mouthfeel is smooth and nicely carbonated. Drinkability is moderate. Overall a solid porter but not something I was crazy about."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Very nice feel."
"Poured to a dark chocolate brown with a hint of ruby at the bottom of the glass, a thin tan head that disippated quickly and little lacing. Nose is malty choclate with a hint of oatmeal. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, leaning only slightly to the watery side. Taste is a satisfactory follow-up of the nose, and the finish, though nothing spectacular, is tasty and of medium duration."
"Drinkability is good. A very pleasant experience and well worth a session."
"Overall, a very good dark beer. Easy to like if you enjoy darker beers."
"date consumed:	28 Nov 2008"
"Pours nearly opaque, with a thin frothy tan head. Aroma is the typical roasted malt aroma of a porter, but with a minimal amount of the sour aroma and taste that many have these days. The flavor is similar in the fact that it is very roasted, but not to the overroasted point, which is where I think the sour acidity comes in. Chocolate flavors throughout this one from the malt. The hops are more prevalent thank expected. The history of the porter tells us that the beer originated when train porters would essentially order beer ""suicides"" that included whatever was on tap--- can't really remember why they thought this was a good idea... anyway, this tastes very much like someone mixed a great stout, and an american IPA... very good porter... the biggest gripe I had with it was that it seemed a bit thinner than I had wanted- especially since it has the added oatmeal."
"Highland OP is all about oaty smoothness. Soft roasted malt and gentle coffee with mild char are the predominant flavors. Hints of blackberry. MUCH smoother and a nice change of pace from more aggressive porters."
"Feel is more scratchy or ""cat tongue-like", then the velvet type of qualities I associate with oatmeal beers. Soothing in a numbing sort of way. Negligible alcohol. A definite dryness on the tail end that consumes the finish & lends itself to more stoutly comparisons(& room for one more bottle)."
"Good solid body but not too heavy."
"silky smooth mouthfeel is excellent and this beer is verrrry drinkable."
"Bottle: Poured a clear black color porter with a medium size foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of dry coffee notes with some subtle black chocolate. Taste is a mix between some chocolate note with some dry coffee and lightly sweet notes at the end. Body is a bit thin with some average carbonation. Very well done overall apart from body too thin."
"Definitely a good porter that attempts to capture the style. Probably not one of the better ones that I've had but still worth a shot."
"Overall this is a solid porter that's a tad smoother than most thanks to the oatmeal. Worth a shot."
"This is a nice drinker - recommended!"
"Drinkability: OK, better as it warms"
"D: This is a highly drinkable beer. It's well made and balanced in most ways."
"D - I had to restrain myself from drinking the rest of the growler before reviewing this. Very fine beer. Favorite porter as of yet. Will have it again and again."
"D, notes: Full but drinkable. I enjoyed it."
"This is my first offering from Highland, and I am thrilled to try some others."
"I'll drink this one again when I find it - if it isn't available in Athens, GA, we are missing out."
"M/D - Full bodied and very creamy, rich, and smooth. Very easy drinking and a great example of your standard American oatmeal porter."
"The flavor was quite good, as the oatmeal blended smoothly with roasted malt, chocolate, and a crisp, peppery mineral finish. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and refreshing, with a bit of a metallic twang that out-competed the earthy hops at the finish. Overall, though, this was quite the solid Porter. The oatmeal was done properly, and it complemented my meal nicely."
"I thought I had had this on tap in the past and enjoyed it. I typically like the Highland offerings I have had. I will try to give this one another shot at some point because I am worried I got a bad bottle."
"Thanks, William (dukew456), for bringing this from South Carolina...it seemed no worse for the wear, despite the long journey and a couple months stowed away."
"A great dessert beer; the thick, smooth mouthfeel endowed by the oatmeal is simply one of the greatest pleasures in the world. It's truly a wonder that the practice of using oatmeal in brewing ever could have become endangered."
"M/D: Not as smooth as I thought it would be, full bodied, carbonation is slightly high but gives a little crispness to the feel. Good drinkability. Easy drinking beer."
"The appearance was pretty normal, black with a tan head and a bit of lacing. The aroma gave off black-roasted grains and coffee while the flavor follow the same line with black coffee and grains with a smooth oat delivery. This tends to remind me more of a smooth Irish stout than anything, since the grain profile is heavy on the burnt flavors instead of chocolate or toffee. Still worth trying."
"D - Great fall/winter session brew."
"Pours a not quite opaque dark brown with a decent head that lasts as a thin layer. Aroma was a nice amount of chocolate and brown malts. The taste was brown malts with notes oc cocoa and slight espresso. The beer is medium bodied with decent carbonation. This is a very decent porter, just not one I seek out that often."
"A very deep brown toned body fills the glass hosting a two finger biscuit tan colored head with nice retention. Nose is bready and rich with toasted malt, soft coco and some dark nutty minerals. Enters the mouth with some zesty roasted mineral notes and quickly brings with it creamy waves of coco based oats. Equalls a nice robust feel while being extremely smooth. Mouthfeel is soft richness and pleasant. Excetionally drinkable."
"Overall- Tasty. creamy and warming. A good porter, reminded me, a little, like Troegs Dead Reckoning.(Thanks Mike!)"
"Medium-bodied and delightfully mellow, Highland's Oatmeal Porter is extremely tasty, refreshing, and drinkable."
"Now I really want to try their black mocha stout!"
"D- This beer is very drinkable but has nice depth of flavor. Finally some found just the right amount of peat malt to put in a beer. It accents the other malts but doesn't taste like a first aid cabinet fell into the pot."
"Edit: I was uninformed enough to not expect the hoppiness in this style. It put me off, but appears to be true to style--I have adjusted my review to reflectmore accurately the this accepted in this style and less my own preference within the style"
"Oatmeal Porter is another good beer from Highland. I've become very impressed with this brewery and the more I sample from them the more I like. Thanks again for the sample Mike!"
"EDIT: Was probably WAY too nice when I was a Highland fanboy. Still love the stuff. Just adjusted the ranking away from bias."
"D - I'm glad to have gotten to try this brew 2 times."
"D: Very easy to down these, as ""oaty"" brews often tend to be. Ideal for a 'half-session,' perhaps, and well worth looking into."
"D - This is an easy to drink porter it has a good mouthfeel and taste worth trying if you get the chance"
"Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz bottle. The beer poured a dark brown, forming a 1/2 inch mocha head, and leaving light lacing behind. The aroma was a mix of chocolate and roasted malts. Nothing complex but very appealing. The taste begins with a good chocolate flavor up front, followed by a good amount of roasted malts, and then concluding with a hint of oats. I think it could have used a bit more oats in the taste and nose. Mouthfeel was thick and smooth. For a porter, this had full flavor and body, along with a good alcohol level, making this a very drinkable ale. Overall, I wasnt dissapointed but not suprised either by this beer. Good porter, but nothing special to set it above the others."
"Overall, this brew is very nice and enjoyable. Give it a shot. I think you'll like it!"
"D - Heavy, but not overly so, it would make for an easy beer to have a few of. Bitterness is usually what deters me from making brews like this a session beer, but the bitterness in this works well with the flavor and isn't overbearing."
"Highly recommended - more enjoyable to me than Highland's Black Mocha Stout. Great thanks to cjohnson."
"Thanks to MuenchenerKindl for this one. It pours a black color with brown hues around the edges of the glass. The head is one inch in height, light tan in color, and recedes slowly into a nice cap of lacing. The aroma is of milk chocolate, vanilla, graham cracker, and cream. The taste is like the aroma, but bigger. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with appropriately low carbonation, and a silky texture. Overall, this is a great porter. The oats really come through in the creaminess in both the taste and feel. I would love to have this available in Minnesota."
"Pours black with a small off light tan head. Nice lacing on the surface and sides. Roasted/burnt malt aroma with a chocolate note. Nice dark malt profile. Coffee. Lingering bitterness mostly from the malt but some herbal hops. Just a touch of sweetness. Medium bodied. Pretty drinkable porter. Not too heavy. Nice overall."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a goblet. It had a nice deep black color to it. I poured a 2 finger head, which was a nice cream color. It lingered for the right amount of time. The aroma was a little sweet with hints of roasted malt and chocolate. The taste and feel of the beer were good overall, it was creamy with the malt really coming out and I think that I tasted a hint of vanilla. It was full bodied, smooth and easy to drink. Overall, a very good porter, but not one of my favorites, but this is not to say that I wouldn't drink it again, becasue I would and I would recommend to anyone."
"This is a nice, somewhat different, somewhat harsher than normal for the style porter. It is easy drinking and balances a good amount of flavour. An easy recommendation."
"First off, let me say,....I like this porter a lot!! It's got everything you could want in a beer. Hints of dark chocolate, with a slight porter smokiness. Very drinkable indeed. It poured with a quarter inch head, and leaves a slight amount of tracing. It is very hoppy for a porter. Definitely some bite. Very slight taste of alcohol, but at 5.8 abv, thats expected. Two thumbs up."
"Easy to drink, but messy."
"Highland's staple (as I understand it), and worth that designation. Creamy and soft, maybe a little too sweet, but a unique offering."
"This was really nice. Pleasant flavor, very drinkable."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice porter to drink a few of, but it doesn't seem like a beer that would really want to drink much more than 2 or 3 of due to its heaviness."
"Overall, this was an incredible porter. It's not heavy, yet it's bursting with flavor. Very easy to drink."
"A solid Porter from Highland with a nice roasty feel and a great balance between the bitter and sweet notes. Tasty and easy drinking, it's a solid recommendation!"
"This a slightly above average porter that doesn't have an apparent oat profile one would expect from an oatmeal porter. I also am slightly disappointed with it appearance scent and taste. However it has an interesting and innovative mouthfeel and drinkability that make up for those shortcomings."
"Another good porter, nicely balanced very drinkable"
"Pours just slighty less than an opaque black with a nice thick frothy beige head and some nice lacing as it empties. Smell is somewhat subtle, but deliciously of oatmeal, chocolate and roasty malt. Somehow feels a bit light bodied, but smooth and perfectly carbonated. Pretty easy drinking, and a nice dry chocolatey taste with the smooth oatmeal presence definitely there. Kind of like a liquid oatmeal chocolate chip cookie with a good bitter and sweet balance. Definitely a good beer and worth getting if you can."
"D - Very easy drinking. I would have another if I had one, will keep my out for this one again."
"On tap at the Brick Store Pub. Hoppy porter. Stouty in finish. Lots of lace fresh, Highland beers are coming to the taps here.Smooth, though not creamy it is about-average mouthfeel. bittersweet chocolate. Roast here. Fine as a porter as listed, does not compete with the several RIS, and that's fine."
"Thiis review is for a bottled version but I have had this on tap at the McGregor Ale House in Cary, NC. Very enjoyable, predominantly malty, and great body. I am enjoying the heck out of the Highland line-up and the Oatmeal Porter is no exception. Even though it's just a little bit rough around the edges, I'm finding that I am really enjoying that in my beer lately. Call me crazy but it's a nice change from the ultra refined macros or the centuries old refinements found in the Belgians. I'm diggin' it and looking forward to some more!"
"D_This is a good if not overly complex porter and one which I would drink more if available."
"D - as I said, this tastes great (at least on tap)! Would definitely drink again. Just delicious."
"Very tasty beer. Not too heavy, but it will stick with you. And that wonderful malt profile is very unique, at least in my experience."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. A tasty oatmeal porter that is very easy to drink."
"D: Taste doesn't quite live up to every other aspect of this beer, but very nice and easy drinking for a porter. Probably my favorite beer I've had from Highland so far as it doesn't suffer from the oversweetness that some of their other brews have had for me."
"Poured as a very rich black with decent beige/tan head. Smell was of unsweetened chocolate which was very nice not to much. Mouthfeel was middle of the road. Really kind of smooth for a porter. Flavors were more chocolate and almost a little smoke or roasted malt. I thought this was a pretty decent beer overall. Especially since it is from Asheville, NC."
"Pours very dark with a nice fluffy head into my Imp Pint. Light aromas of dark chocolate and caramelly sweet malt. Flavor really takes off from here - very roasty and chocolatey. This one has a nice light body - not too thin. Finishes nicely with a lightly bitter and dry finish. A very nice brew for sure. ONly complaint would be a bit too much carbonation for my liking - and I even gave this a good pour and let it sit a bit."
"Thanks to barefootbrewer for the sample."
"Poured out a nice deep mocha-coffee color. Creamy head with long retention, sticks to the glass rim. Smells of malts, cocoa, slight coffee. Sweet flavors, chocolates, malty. This beer is suprisingly more carbonated on the mouthfeel than it actually looks like it would be, giving it a suprisingly easy drinkability. It is the little brother of Sam Smiths oatmeal stout. good beer easy to drink."
"This is a solid offering from a solid local brewery. I had it along with a Guinness beef stew (broke with convention and did NOT order a Guinness...) and it was ideal. One word to describe this beer overall: wonderful. Pleasant, enjoyable, smooth, silky, easy -- a great dinner companion."
"I had one of these. Could have had more, but not too many more."
"Drinkability- It was alright for a change but not a beer I would consider too much if there were other options."
"Overall- I think this is a very nice brew. It is a little more mild and smooth than other porters I have experienced in the past. I would say it is the most easy drinking one yet. I could easily down 2 or 3 of these in one sitting with no problems. There is not alot of complex action on the tongue and somewhat one dimensional, but in this beer, I don't think that is a bad thing. Very nice and I will be back for more!"
"Overall, very tasty. Excellent mouthfeel and great balance."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark brownish black color with a light tan head. The aroma is dark roasted malts, caramel, and chocolate. The taste much like the aroma is dark and roasty with some sweetness in the middle and a dry roasty and bitter finish. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is recommended. The aroma was a little faint and both the aroma and taste could have kicked up the flavor a little, but still a solid Oatmeal Porter. Recommended."
"Dark black with a creamy cocoa head. Smell is soem roasted malts. The taste is oaty (what a surprise) and not too strong. The drinkability was pretty good, I could see my self knocking back three of these in a sitting (if I had them). Decent porter but nowhere near my favorite. Still a solid beer."
"The warmer it got, the better."
"I'm more impressed with Highland's efforts with each beer I sample!"
"Prosit MK"
"Thanks again, Dave!"
"I have GOT to make a trip to Asheville one of these days..."
"Pours a nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy off-white head, some nice small islands and sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, nice touch of toffee/chocolate/caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, then the dark tones come into play, and very malty. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a tasty Porter with a nice twist, recommended."
"D - Very drinkable but slightly on the light side compared to most American Porters."
"Presented almost black with a ruby hue and a heavily lacing brownish head. Smells roasty with a little chocolate. Tastes roasty, a little cocoa, lots of hop bitterness. The oatmeal is a nice touch. Smooth in the mouth with a light body. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability/Notes: Highland's Oatmeal Porter is very drinkable. Rather different than most Porters' due to the oatmeal addition which lends a smoothness to the overall flavor profile of the beer. Nice and malty with a dark fruit and caramel quality but also has enough hops to give it a really nice bittering quality as well. Your typical Porter roastiness is rather light but does linger long after the swallow. A very easy beer to drink and since it finishes rather dry and is somewhat light in the body it easy to put a few of these back without a problem or getting board. Would make a pretty decent session beer though it would be on the high end at 5.8% abv. Definitley a beer I would get again if available in my area. Glad I was able to pick some up with on the OBX. Recommended. Seek and Enjoy."
"D: A very drinkable offering from Highland. The balance of this beer is great, and has enough in the flavor profile to keep you coming back."
"Pours out a very nice rich brown, the color of cola, with a thick tan head. Aroma is strong and stouty, with overtone of coffee and smoky hint. Flavor is fairly rich, mouth-filling, has strong burnt-coffee taste, with just a little bitterness. Smooth, pleasing, good for sipping and savoring."
"Light feel,yet full,smooth and juicy make for good drinkability. Tasty beer wish i had another."
"This is a decent porter, and worth a try if you've never had it."
"Creamy biege head piles up on top of a almost black but brown beer with red edge highlights. Great nose with roast and light spice of the hop blend together extremely well. In the taste, the roast and chocolate with light coffee go done extremely smooth, creamy in fact from the oatmeal. Only drawback really is a bit thin for the mouthfeel but excessively drinkable. Very good beer, and if this makes sense--it's almost a lawnmower porter. Clearly a porter with clear style characteristics but light and drinkable enough to be a session beer and tasted great in spite of the southern heat where I drank most of these. A very good beer and one that is a beer that the geek and a newbie to craft beer could both share."
"Had this right after a Fuller's and thought it compared pretty closely. Dark and near black with good head and lacing. Smell was of roasted malts. Chocolate and the oatmeal is noticeable. Taste was well balanced with oatmeal and chocolate. Slight bit of coffee in there and a touch of vanilla. Mouthfeel is lighter to medium. Very smooth. A session Porter for sure and one that comes at a good price around here. I need to stock up on this stuff, though on-tap it's better."
"This beer poured a black color with a big rocky tan head. The aroma is sweet and malty. The taste is roasted and sweet with some coffee flavors. The oatmeal doesn¬ít stand out, but seems to linger nicely in the background. The mouthfeel is full and a bit oily. Overall, this is a robust porter that I find a delight."
"Drinks easy, espcially for the abv, a solid porter"
"Overall, a nice beer. Creamy and smooth mouthfeel. If this beer were a touch less sweet, the drinkability would be unbelievable. That being said, this beer is certainly one to have again, perhaps when the weather turns cooler."
"D - I want to keep some on hand at all times. This was a very easy drinking beer and I enjoyed it very much"
"The beer is blessed with a solid mouth and posses an easy drinking feel. My first beer from this brewery, great start. Well done!"
"The one thing I'm most sad about is not seeing more of a contribution from the oats. A hearty mouthfeel would do this beer really well. Even still, I'm happy for the opportunity to try it."
"Drinkability: super smooth, easy to quaff, and nicely refreshing for the style. This is a clear session beer that is not your standard ale."
"For the record, I love this brewery. This beer proves it. The beer promises what is stated on the lable. It offers everything that is good in a porter with the uniqueness found in the Oatmeal Stout. Best of both worlds. The beer plops into glass, sounding even rich and malty. The pour delivers a dark brown hue with ruby light emitting. The tan head retention prevents me from pourin the entire contents into my glass. The aromas are a soft chocolate, coffee blend with a mild lactose sweetness and mellowness. The flavors are rich with the same chocolate / coffee notes found in the aroma with a complex, smooth sweetness from the malts / oats blend. A mild coffee bitterness blends nicely with a medium hop balance. The feel is a bit heavy and velvety on the toung and palate. Finishes with a lingering chocolate flavor and coffee bitterness. This beer is very non-offensive, yet offers a lot of variety and intrique. Hats off to Highlands again!"
"Crisp and dry, porter wise, this would make for a good drinking fall/winter brew. Hope it has a nice price ¬ñ say, around $8 a sixer."
"D: This is a good, very original porter, nice to finish out my night at BSP with, but is just a little heavy, sour, and roasted."
"Overall I wasn't too fond of this beer. An oatmeal porter sounded interesting but it really didn't amount to anything special..."
"Deep, ruby reddish brown in color with a decent sized head. Soft, cocoa and malty aroma. Nice malty flavor. Very smooth with a nice cocoa taste to it. Nice lingering bitterness-very much like bakers choholate. Velvety and creamy mouthfeel. Exceptionally drinkable beer. Quite enjoyable. Liquid chocolate brownies I say."
"D: A solid effort. A great choice for dry stout fans."
"Mouthful is very creamy like a Oatmeal stout, but with the distinct porter flavor. Very interesting. Goes down very smooth. I could easily session this."
"Dark with a slightly red hue with some light passing through. Head was low but with decent lacing. Nice aroma sweet then smoky. Taste not that complex. A little hop taste but mostly a smoked malt and a taste of oak at the end. Mouth feel was full for a porter. Good drinkable beer."
"Pours out a deep black/brown with slight red hints, and a nice off-white head that fades. Nose is roasty malts and a surprising amount of hops, with good sweetness all around. Taste is some chocolate and burnt malts, and a bit of strange ash flavor on the finish. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both slightly above average. Not the best, but a solid brew."
"Drinkability: Always enjoyable, I can't believe I haven't reviewed it previously"
"Dark brown color with some red hints. Tan head that drops quickly but leaves a film that leaves sticky spiderweb lacing. Smell of cocoa and mild coffee. Taste of light chocolate with a faint bitterness in the finish. Little thin on the mouthfeel. Overall a nice brew. Glad i decided to try it."
"Very drinkable. A good lighter dark beer that doesnt offend at all. Would definatley pick up a 6er next time in NC."
"Very nice drinking porter. A little extra body would make it even better."
"Pours a coffee color with a bit of red tint, a nice looking porter.Not much going on in the nose, I don't usually seem to get much from porters but I do detect some toasted malt and slight hops. Light toasted malt and coffee on the palate with a bit more hops than usual in a porter, I think. This beer definately improves as it warms and the toasted malts and slight burnt flavor come through more."
"Not a beer style I get to partake in that often, just doesn't seem to be that many unique ones where I buy my brews. I wouldn't turn this beer away, but I won't go looking for it either."
"Very drinkable brew. The hops were a big surprise at first. I would drink the crap out of this if it was available locally"
"I don't know if this beer has improved or my tastes have, but this is one fine example of an easy-drinking oatmeal porter. Creamy, smooth, well balanced and tasty with a terrific aftertaste, this is a heckuva beer and praises to Highland for making it so!"
"I generally like Porters but don't drink alot of them for some reason. Maybe I'll make a point to in the future. This was a nice beer. Good balance and flavor."
"Overall an easy drinking porter. Could use a bit more of a complex grain profile however. Thanks to brentk56."
"D - due to the light body, this one drinks really smooth."
"Poured a deep dark brown on the edges and almost black towards the middle. Small cream colored head gave way to some nice lacing. Smell was dominated by a roasted malt, smokey hints in there as well. This tasted thick with a rich caramel, and chocolate flavors. Very filling indeed. Smooth going down but very full bodied. Excellent dessert type beer. Has a nice dry hopped finish that rounds it out nicely. Fine offering from Highland that has found a place in my fridge!"
"thanks goes to OldGrowth for this. poured dark brown to black with a nice tan head that left some lacing. aroma, coffee, roasted malt, chocolate, brown sugar. flavor got a big chunk of of dark chocolate and roasted malt, honey, had to let this get to room temp. before I got a hint of hopes. nice bitterness at the finish."
"Mouthfeel is silky smooth but a litttle too thin to hold all the flavor up. I like the roasted and coffee tones and aftertaste is mild and pleasant. This is definitely quaffable, just not supurb. I'm slightly disappointed but am still very high on Highland."
"Overall a very drinkable porter. Goes down very easily. Recommended."
"Highland Oatmeal Porter was a decent beer. I would recommend giving it a try."
" Overall, drinkability is this brew's strongpoint, easily enjoyed, no obnoxious qualities; a solid brew definitely worthy of enticing a beer drinker to seek out more offerings from the Highland Brewing Company."
"D: Close but no cigar to this beer, the flavors just don't come out enough."
"This beer poured a very deep brown, pretty much black color with a slight tan head that ran away quickly and left a floating island in the middle. The aroma was pretty much all malt and a touch of sweetness. The taste is a good melting of malts and chocolately goodness. There is also a tad bit of hop bitterness to round it all out and make for a strong mouthfeel and a very drinkable beer."
"Tastes like a coarse oatmeal stout. Starts out with bitter, roasted malt that gets mellow and grainy near the middle and ends on a linger bittersour node that tastes like good health."
"Another good local brew!"
"Its good to find a yummy porter brewed locally."
"The dry style is quite drinkable. No stickiness, and its actually quite refreshing."
"I will keep this one in the refrigerator rotation for the forseeable future as it is readily available here - nice brew!"
"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date. The beer is black with plum highlights, plenty of carbonation, and is topped with a two inch tan head that leaves decent lacing. It smells of green hops and chocolate at first, but there are also notes of roasted/coffee malts and, of course, oats. The flavor consists of oats, roasted, chocolate, tobacco, and coffee-flavored malts, with a delicious combination of green/piney/citric hops that leave a medium bitterness, complementing the malts quite well. Initially, the medium body is almost prickly with carbonation, but it becomes smooth, almost silky later, and leaves a medium finish. Overall it comes across almost as an imperial stout light and is a quality beer with a body that is fairly light considering how big and flavorful the brew is."
"Flavor is chocolate, roasted malts, with the oatmeal definitely making its presence felt. An almost metallic toffee sensation occurs in the finish. This is a more buoyant porter than some, not heavy, a little watery, but it delivers well enough."
"The taste is excellent with some light bitterness from added hops. The light burnt malts really come through as well. I detect a nice bitterness in the mouthfeel, which is very full bodied. An excellent example of the style."
"Drinkability: The experience was a bit amiss, as the lacking flavors and near-watery body left me unsatisfied and wanting."
"Nice beer. Many thanks to AutumnalDave for the sample. Pours jet black with a monstrous tan head. Awesome retention. Smooth, sweet aroma of oats, chocolate, and surprisingly hops, of the citrus and floral varieties. Full bodied and full flavored with oats, nuts, sweet malts, bits of baker¬ís chocolate, and a sip of coffee. Creamy and rich yet accessible as can be. Very drinkable."
"It's an ok porter. There are others I like a lot better. Given the choice, I'd pick something else."
"Drinkability: A solid, easy to drink porter No real complaints, but there are better beers in the style. Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for the bottle."
"Watery brown with mahogany highlights A short tan head of fine bubbles builds and recedes quickly leaving no lacing and only a few trace bubbles on the surface. A vigorous pour could not muster any more foam. No carbonation streams are visible. A powdery chocolate, cooked oatmeal, and medium roasted coffee fills the nose. The coffee notes lead the way, balanced with an oatmeal creaminess. There is a watered bitterness throughout and a coffeeish note trails through the finish. The chocolate is only minimally present. Medium to light body, but lacking any heft, everything is low profile. Minimal carbonation. It felt small. This was a fair to middling porter that lacked distinction."
"This may be my favorite beer (to date that is, life is too short with so many beers yet to sample). It's nice to have a regional beer with so much going for it. Appearance is chocolatey black with ruby tones.The nose immediately picks up the earthy, organic oatey overtones that don't overpower the roasted chocolate malts. Mouthfeel is substantially chewy and smooth thanks to the aforementioned perfect balance of oats and malts. Drinkability is what sets this, and really all Highland beers apart. The heaviness that one may find in many porters is not found here despite the heartiness supplied by the oatmeal. These characteristics add up to one exceptional brew. Cheers to Highland from across the mountain."
"Thanks again."
"This beer has a much more flavor than any other porter I've had. A great beer from NC."
"I enjoyed this beer. Not my favorite porter, but very quaffable nonetheless."
"This is a pretty drinkable beer. It didn't blow me away but a good tasting brew and a good session brew."
"The mouth rushes with hints of the toasted oats, coffee and chocolate. A moderate carbonation supports the flavors and carefully directs them to appropriate portions of the tongue. The finish is medium, full of the chocolate malt and soft bitter tones."
"Notes: This a great style of porter I have had porters before but not this style untill now. Lace lines the glass all the way through. It's also very drinkable. I could definately scarf down a few of these. Cheers"
"well worth a try.."
"This is definitely one apart from the others in terms of porters. Extremely pleasant beer; try and get some if you can. I know I'll be back to thebeerninja soon for more."
"Last swigs: Thanks to BA Jredner for the qatmeal stout. This went well with my veggie and cheese late night snack."
"D: The more I drink this beer the more I love it!! Thanks to blackie for this one, would love to get some more of this stuff, awesome porter."
"Nice crown head on top of the black body. A good amount of lacing. Typical aroma for a porter: coffee, burnt, toasted, but little in th eway of hops. Didn't smell much that would label this an ""oatmeal"" porter. I would've expected a little more bread/dough aroma. Taste was good, but not great. A nice little bit of coffee in the long finish."
"Drinkablility: I was not fond of the flavor having such a metallic taste to it, but it was good everywhere else. so average."
"Drinkability: this beer is very surprising from what i'd though it'd be like. It has elements that I remember from other porters/stouts that I thought was strange but they do it well. Really unique I think. It's neat. This beer seems like it'd go really well with chocolate maybe a cigar on a nice brisk night. I must commend Highland in Asheville for having the guts to do such a different brew in this region. I'm not quite crazy about it though. I'd have to be in a wierd mood to want it again."
"I've had the chance to sample several beers from Highland, courtesy of NClifestyle, and I've dug everything these folks do. The Oatmeal Porter is no exception. Rich black with mocha-ring head. Full, deep roasted flavors without an burnt or scorched notes. The oatmeal designation lead me to expect it to be more dense and malty, but I don't know that I got a lot of sense of the oatmeal. Nonetheless, it was a substantial and satisfying beer, with some lighter notes to keep one interested."
"Aroma was pretty low intesnity though I didn¬ít give it very long to warm I¬íd stille xpect more aroma than this. Faintly roasty with a bit of green tobacco. Deep black with a quickly fading mocha head. Fore is roasted malts and coffee..no real chocolate notes though I get hints of darker fruits. Palate is a bit thin and it rolls into the flavor which makes the finish slightly watery. Highland might be the one brewery that has beers I really like a lot that aren¬ít porters or stouts. I thinkt he Tasgall is very nice, but the Porter and Stout, to me, were lacking."
"Dark pour..light tan head rests for a bit and leaves ok patches of lacing. Aroma very light..some roasty malts and a pinch of hops, but very very faint. Roasted chocolate malt flavor..some burnt/smoky character settling into the relatively thin body. I wasn't too taken aback by this one..there are much better widely available porters out there."
"This isn't a get-drunk beer; this is an exceptional porter that should be enjoyed with a steak and friends. Don't eat the friends, lol. Excellent, possibly the best beer I've ever tried. I wish I could take this beer to every company that makes a porter and say, ""This is how you make a porter."""
"cheers..."
"The beer pours a very dark brown with hints of amber. There is a sizeable frothly off-white head that holds well and laces well. It smells of roasted and nutty malts. There is also some sweetness balanced by some bitterness in the smell. The beer really shows its strength in its taste. Initially you can taste the roasted malts. This is followed by some sweetness but is balanced nicely with bitterness so that the sweet character is not overpowering. The beer finishes with a slightly nutty character possibly hazlenut. The beer has a good thickness and carbonation along with some dryness that complements the beer nicely. This is also one of the smoothest beers available. Overall this is a fantastic regional beer that I will reach for again and again."
"Overall - a very tasty product from a reliable, creative brewery. Highly recommended."
"A nice offering from Highland."
"A very good porter for those who can't get enough of them. I will pick this up in the future."
"Overall: A nice, smooth porter with a solid roasty character. I'd like to try this one with a nice steak."
"11/16/13 bottle - still gorgeous with a dense, rocky mocha head. very solid porter with plenty of rich, balanced flavors of cocoa, malt, and toffee. the perfect twinge of midpalate sweetness. pleasant moderate mouthfeel, light carbonation, drying roasty finish. a classic that stands the test of time, and always worth a purchase. not gonna change any scores, but i feel more of a 4.0 mouthfeel these days."
"I could certainly put my fair share of these away... entirely inoffensive beer with an incredible oaty flavor... definitely one of my favorite ""bang for your buck"" beers."
"This is another solid beer by Highland. If your looking for a good porter this is it. A very dark color. Thin head. Smell is of roasted grains. The mouthfeel and drikability on this one are both excellent. I have bought this beer on several occasions and will do so again in the future. I love the taste of oatmeal beers."
"I go back and forth on this beer, probably because I have had a bunch of them. It was in the very early rotation of craft beers 4 years ago or so. I had been turned off of it lately, but this bottle was great. I'll be sure and drink some in NC over the holidays"
"Overall, this is one tasty porter. If I could get it around here, it would probably become a regular resident of my fridge. Recommended."
"This is currently my favorite NC brew. It's a great session beer that doesn't kill the tastebuds, nor does it fail to give you satisfying, solid flavor. Good to have around all of the time."
"All in all a very drinkable brew. I have a friend in Asheville who drinks two Highland Oatmeal Porters every evening and now I understand why: it's a light, smooth, tasty drink that invites another. Again, thanks to mntlover - I'd never have had a chance to try this regional pleasure."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a smooth carbonation that works quite well. I could easily sit down to a few of these as it's one of my favorite styles...but I do feel there are better porters out there that I would probably choose first. Thanks to kmpitz2 for the opportunity."
"Appearance is dark purple-black with a small head. Minimal lace. Smell is dark malts, caramel and coffee.Ok I guess oatmeal too.. Very nice. These are all apparent in the taste too. Excellent quenching mouthfeel. Quite smooth too. Methinks highland pretty good brewers. One of the better oatmeal porters/stouts I have tried."
"D: Very, Very drinkable. Now that is readily available in my area is becoming my standby beer. Somehow this beer fits any situation for me. Had one last night around a campfire and the same evening over a nice meal with my wife."
"-UF"
"Drinkability: Pretty easy going down. Very well done but nothing too exciting. It takes an awful lot to impress with Edmund Fitzgerald readily available. Recommended."
"Drinkabilty- A good porter for sure. Definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability: fairly bland flavor and not very exciting, but the aroma is good and the mouthfeel is awesome"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" tan head above the translucent dark burgundy/brown brew. Head is frothy and hangs around, with nice lacing. Aroma is lightly of dark grains. Taste is dark malts, rounded out by the oatmeal character. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, as you would hope, and drinkability is nice as well. Nice brew, very sessionable porter, for sure."
"OVERALL COMMENTS: A thoroughly unique brew, and empirically worthy of at least a taste should you ever get the opportunity. Always thought that Oatmeal would do well in a porter, and after this brew, I can see I wasn¬ít wrong."
"Black in color with a healthy sized tan head. Clingy scatterings of lace were left on the side of the glass as a small cap of foam remained. Light roasty aroma with a sweet maltiness lingering about. Some light coffee as well. A bit mild but inviting. Roasted malts and a mild dark chocolate upfront. Sweet malt notes and some bitterness are there. Finishes on a lingering roasty note. Great flavors but it needs a bit more of them. Medium and creamy mouthfeel works well. Easy drinking stuff that goes down quickly. A solid brew that is very sessionable."
"The oatmeal gives it just enough body to thicken it up a bit and make this a very rich and full porter. A damn good sample if I must say so, yet another brew I will have to find if I am in NC in the future."
"Bomber provided by GCBrewingCo. Thanks for the opportunity. Pours a 1/2 finger brown-tan head over a very dark brown liquid. Very dark mohogeny brown when held to light. Nose is chocolatey with a touch of molasses and some alcohol. Some dry rough hoppy, like the middle of a piece of dried out driftwood (freshwater) that's just been cracked open. Taste is mostly chocolate with noticable coffee-ish roast beneath, as well as bitter/sour (perhaps from black patent). There is a rough grassy near the end that's a bit combative, but a re-emergance of the chocolate in a more syrupy tasting form fights it off. The mouthfeel isn't as smooth and creamy as I was expecting, perhaps because the coffee and hop put an edge on the beer. Medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Although the beer leaves my mouth dry, I'm left with enjoyable memories of sweeter chocolate. Not a tremendously complecated beer, but definitely enjoyable."
"Pours almost pitch balck, but with some light sneaking around the edges. Thick foamy head that first receded to a cool looking cap, then to a pretty thick film. Nose is a bit of coffee. Taste is a strong kick of coffee beans. Can't really find the oatmeal (that comes through more in the full and heavy mouthfeel). Dark chocolate flavor also leaves a dry feel in the mouth. Little bit smokey. Fairly drinkable, but it would burn my taste sense if I stuck with these all day."
"Overall, another fantastic beer from Highland. I really should have bought more of this stuff when I was in NC. I haven't had a single beer from this brewery that I didn't like."
"A very dark brown beer with rich mahogony highlights. Has a small creamy light brown head. There is a rich malty aroma with a light chocolate note a bit of coffee in the background. The flavor starts with a good promising roasted malt character. This robust goodness is short lived however. The finish is a nasty metallic aftertaste that sticks to your teeth and gums. Removing any joy you were getting from this brew."
"Relatively drinkable, but probably won't have another one tonight."
"Drinkability - a fine treat supplied by merlin48. Great stuff!"
"The beer is very easy to drink with no hint of abv. A nice overall beer that I would buy if in NC for sure!"
"Taste of subdued smoky chocolate. Sweet malt but a drier bitter finish, coffee and hops. Medium bodied. Not going to bludgeon you over the head, an understated porter. Creamy and sweet. Not bad. A session beer to be sure. A good winter fallback?"
"This brew pours a very dark brown to black color with a finger of head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is definately full of oats and chocolate with a small whisp of alcohol. The flavor is even better than the nose. There is more roastedness, giving it an almost coffee finish. The oats are more subdued and there is a nice chocolateyness in it as well. I like it. The feel is moderate with a moderate carbonation on it. The flavor is really what makes this brew. Very tasty. Very easy drinking and smooth. Enjoyable beer."
"Pours a dark black that shows ruby red highlights if held to the light and a thick tan head that dissapates quickly. Smell is oatmeal, brown sugar, molasses and a light roasted malt scent as well as a light citric hop smell. The taste is somewhat sweet with flavors of oatmeal sweetened with brown sugar (this could be a breakfast beer) as well as some dark roasted coffee flavors that segue nicely into a roast malt/hops bitter finish. A well built porter that can stand up to the winter months. The mouthfeel is slightly thin and chewy and the drinkability is fairly high because of this"
"Easy drinking, but disappointing overall. The advertised chocolate malts just aren't present in enough quantity to balance the hops."
"Very dark opaque color with brief head. Good dark roasted malty aroma, good roasted malt front, almost coffee flavor, with some hops in the back as the ale goes down. Body was substantial without being heavy, very drinkable. Long roasty aftertaste, pretty assertive for the style. A solid porter and one I would seek out again."
"What a disappointment this stuff was. It poured very nicely. Almost black. The smell, however, wasn't vey impressive. Much too hoppy for the style, I felt. The taste, too, was too hoppy. Bitter even. I was not impressed with this beer. The mouthfeel was the right weight for the style, but that is about where the pleasantries for this one ended. Maybe I got a bad one, or maybe this stuff just isn't for me. Either way, I didn't care for it."
"Poured with a thin tan head on top of a nearly opaque black body. Smells of weak coffee with hints of dark fruits. Slightly sweet smell overall. Taste is of dry oatmeal with a touch of toasted malts in the background. There is a bitter finish as well which goes well with the dry initial flavors. Mouthfeel is good but nothing to write home about. Drinkability is really good and I¬íll certainly pick up another 6¬íer at some point in the future. Overall this is a good easy drinking dry porter."
"Mouthfeel is chewy and a little heavy, body typical of oatmeal brews. Tastes like a blend of two really good beers, a combination that works well together but not necessarily combining into a third identity. A worthy attempt, thanks to AKSmokedPorter for sharing."
"Brew pours to a fairly close black color with a nice sized light tan head that has good retention and leaves nice rings of lace down the side of the brew. The aromas of this brew are of roasted malts that have a sweet smell to them. Also has aromas of coffee and maybe caramel, possibly where it gets some of its sweet aromas? The taste is very balanced, has a nice roasted taste that is intermingled with both coffee and chocolate highlights. Also has a sweetness that seems to break away to a slight hop taste. This is a very smooth brew; this would be an excellent session brew! Best brew I have had so far on my business trip to NC."
"Had this on tap and it was smooth, easy drinking, and tasty. The review is froma bottle I brought home. Milk chocolate and roasted malt aroma. Dark brown colored beer with a caramel hue. Small cream colored head fades quickly to a ring leaving little spots of lace. The oatmeal was hard to taste in the draft version, but not here. Flavor is mildly sweet with some dark roasted malts, but dominated by that dry ashy oatmeal flavor that produces a slightly bitter finish. Smooth mouthfeel, kind of dry. Kind of like oatmeal stouts little brother, sweet!"
"Cheers!"
"Pours a dark brown with no light coming through it. It sports a sandy 3 cm head on top in the pint glass. The aroma is roasty and sweet with scents of molasses and brown sugar. Very appealing to the nose. The flavor starts with a touch of coffee followed by big roastiness, grainy caramel, toast, and some nice chocolate malt flavors. It's nice and sweet with more molasses and brown sugar notes. This beer is one of those beers where the line between a porter and a stout is blurred. They call it a porter, but it could just have easily been called a stout. Granted it would be just a mediocre stout, but is an excellent porter, the distinction is still slim. Whatever you call it, I call it good. A nice, full bodied beer with lots of sweet maltiness to satisfy a BA."
"Tap pour yields such a thick, creamy head I had to ask if it was nitro-tapped-it wasn't. Brilliant, deep, dark brown in color, good head retention with moderate lace which soon dissapears. Aroma is fully of charred, creamy malts, cocoa, a lite coffee note, and a sweetness that I assume is the oats. Taste profile same with more complex malts, molasses/brown sugar, and a mellow, but pronounced fresh hop taste. Roast/toasty aftertaste with a bit of bitterness left on the tongue. Medium bodied, very smooth, highly chuggable, and very tastey. Who said that North Carolina is beer hell?"
"Another from the monk. Thanks from across the river my man!"
"Very nice porter to drink. Well balanced and full of flavor."
"Sampled at the Sophisticated Otter in Johnson City, TN, this brew came out opaque burgundy brown under a one finger tan head with good retention and great lacing. Mild roasted malt greets the nose, while the mouth is light and very prickly. The opening is a bit watery, with some caramel malt, both sweet and smooth. There's also a touch of roasted nuts, and a slightly espresso bite, building not during but after the finish, than fading back into wateriness. Ultimately disappointing."
"Thanks to AKSmokedPorter and BIF 8.0. A solid porter, with the oatmeal adding a nice dimension to the sweetness. A nice porter, and one I'd enjoy having again!"
"This beer looks perfect with its deep and dark brown color and thin creamy tan head. Almost black in appearance. The aroma is somewhat complex with deep and dark roasted chocolates, tannic hazlenut, and sweet and soft black licorice. Enticing. Flavors are well received in the mouth and the beer goes down very smoothly. Rich tasting. Soft roasted buttery notes gently coat the tongue. Medium bodied and low in bitterness. This is one excellent ultra smooth beer."
"I've had oatmeal stouts before, but I do believe that Highland Oatmeal Porter is my first oatmeal porter. My first beer from the Tar Heel State--hopefully the first of many--is a good one and is an easy recommendation. Cheers to WOLFGANG for the bottle."
"I'd rank this up there next to the Fuller's London, but far more assertive for the hop lovers. =D"
"Pint at Barley's in Knoxville."
"Very nice dark brown with a thin light brown head. Roasted malts and sweetness are strong in the nose with a bit of chocolate. The flavour is well-balanced between the malts and the hop bitterness. Dark malts really shine through, with coffee and chocolate dominating. There's also noticeable bitterness from the dark grains, but without the astringency that oftens accompanies it. The body is quite full, with a silky smoothness from the oats. Carbonation was relatively light, very appropriate for the style. I'd love to give this a try on tap."
"This is a well done porter that has pleasing complexity. It seems thinner toward the finish, which adds to drinkability."
"From the bottle pours a deep brown liquid with ruby highlights around the glass. Nice off white creamy head that stayed for quite some time. There was a nice amount of lace on the glass. The smell was of cocoa powder, and chocolate. Taste was first like a light roasted coffee, followed by some modest hop bitterness, but not too much to throw it off balance. This was a pretty smooth beer, as the finish was well rounded, not too sharp or dry. Seemed to be a bit too much carbonation, and it was a little thin I felt. Overall though, this was a good one. First time I have had oatmeal in a porter, and it seemed to work. I would certainly look to have this one again."
"Overall: An ¬ìOatmeal Porter¬î ¬ñ a terrific slant on a Porter, it¬ís such a great idea that I am amazed that no-one else has done this, maybe they have, I just haven¬ít heard of ¬ëem. Thanks to AKSmokedPorter, a true Gentleman a great BA, for this one. I wonder what Big Dog thinks of his??"
"Drinkability: Not one of my favorite porters. Something about it made it hard to finish the bottle, but I couldn't pinpoint it."
"Drinkability is pretty good but wit such heavy burent bitter notes it is somewhat one-dimensional, grows on you as you down it thought."
"All and all, a very tasty beer. Very refreshing and it goes great with food."
"WOW!!! This is one truely amazing brew. I never thought that this was going to be this good. There was nothing about this beer that I didn't love. The color was an awesome black, with a thick tan head that stuck around for quite sometime. Talk about head retention, this baby was off da hook! The smell was malty, mixed with some hops, and hints of chocolate. The taste was similar, but was more in the area of chocolate, which is a plus for me. Also, this was one smooth mama jama. It was creamy and oh so smooth on the throat. Bottom line, if you like good beer, you need to drink this. If you like crappy beer, then drink this, so it will convert you to good beer."
"Notes: I could certainly quaff a few pints of this, nice to see a long smoothness in a porter rather than the harsh crispness that some do have. A choice pick if you can get your hands on some."
"12 oz bottle. Poured deep brown with reddish tints when held up to the light, decent head that didn't stick around, and not much lacing on the glass. Aroma is roasted malt, and hops. Taste is more of the same, but I'm missing the creamy smoothness of oatmeal. This is more like a regular porter but with alot more bitterness from the roasted barley and hops. No bad but nothing special for me either"
"Pours nice black,with fluffy tan head. Smell of coffee,oats and malt goodness.Tastes of roasted malt oats with right amount of carbonaton to tingle the tounge. Hops kick in to add citrusy flavor and just the right kick to finish of this great brew. Nice medium bodied porter not as chewy as some others but taste is wonderful. Drinkability is excellent very good brew. Haven't had bad beer from this brewery would recommend trying one if you can."
"Its very deep brown body appears as black in the pint, but reveals deep mahogany highlights along the base of the glass and brilliant glints of ruby through the wide part of the body when held to the light. The short and frothy head of tan foam drops readily, but manages to maintain a full surface covering and leave some spotty lace. A roasty edge, some bittersweet chocolate, and a small bouquet of floral and citrusy hops greet you in the aroma, but fade almost as quickly as the head has dropped. Fortunately, both remain to a certain extent. The body is medium; and it's very fine carbonation leaves it crisp on the tongue before warming to become somewhat creamier and smooth across the palate. The flavor is rich with a distinctly roasted character that lends a bit of acidity before it warms to reveal the bittersweet, dark chocolate and almost-burnt-sugar caramel character beneath. It's well grounded by its solid bitterness, and it finishes dry but with a long-lingering note of dark chocolate that's left in the aftertaste. This is a beer that really needs to be enjoyed at, or just below, cellar temperature - so don't just pull it from the fridge and pour. I'd love to try it in cask form."
"Thanks AKSmokedPorter."
"I've loved this beer for years."
"Really smooth brew, not usual for a porter. Great lacing on the glass right to the last sip and exceptional mouthfeel, the low carbonation helps no doubt. Very nice color and the flavor was outstanding. I wish I had picked up some more as well as some of the other Highland brews. If they are anything like this one, I'm definitely missing something. Maybe next time..."
"The taste is very smooth. The oatmeal stands out with the dark malts and coffee coming through. The oatmeal confused my mouth. It kept waiting for the stout bite that never came. Carbonation is on the low side, which makes it seem even smoother. A really nice and intersteing variation on a porter. Get you some."
"This is another unusual, but fine offering from Highland. It pours a dark chocolate color with a pretty rocky tan head and loads of lace. A sweet malt and hop aroma fades rather quickly. Chocolate and coffee flavors mix with wood and smoke. The hops produce a mild citrus and light spicy bite. Oatmeal grain flavor and texture are noticeable. The alcohol is present, but in the background. Good on a cool evening with a hearty stew."
"The mouthfeel is good but the real winner is the drinkability. Although the flavor could be heightened, it is tasty enough that I could have a few of these in one sitting. Unfortunately, it's the only one I have :-( Thanks Loki for the opportunity to try this very good beer!"
"Pours black ruby in color with a thin and creamy light tan colored head that, despite being small, has a nice retention. Nose is rich chocolaty malts and coffee with a touch of smokiness. Medium in body with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Taste is sweet roasted malts and dark bread followed by notes of unsweetened chocolate, oatmeal, and toasted nuts. Some flavors of bitter coffee and a touch of hops come through towards the end. A very nice oatmeal porter. Thanks to Loki for the sample!"
"A very nice and drinkable Oatmeal Porter with great mouth feel from the kilt wearing Scots at the Highland Brewing company."
"Another intriguing and interesting beer from the Carolina's..thanks again to Kipp..another winner..."
"Overall, I enjoyed this one quite a bit, but the citrus hop flavor seemed a bit strong for a porter. I'd be glad to drink another, though."
"Pours a deep chestnut brown topped by a two-finger tan head that displays excelent retention. As it gradually fades, it leaves a thick sheeting on the glass and leaves a thick layer of foam atop the beer. I can smell sweet roasted malt and caramel coming off this beer from two feet away. The caramel notes become more intense as you lift it to your nose, backed by some oatmeal notes and some hops. A bit of chocolate is in the aroma as well. Very nice indeed. The taste is high on roasted grain and coffee, with a bit of bitter cocoa powder mixed in. Good bitternes on the finish, but a bit of a burnt aftertatse. The aroma promises more sweetness, but the beer doesn't deliver, as it is a little on the dry side. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, with perhaps a bit too much harshness from the carbonation. The drinkability is pretty good, as the aroma and mouthfeel make up for the average but enjoyable flavor profile. This has the potential to be a great brew with just a little harmony between what the aroma tells your mouth it will taste and the flavor profile. Just a bit more residual sugar to add a touch of sweetness would make this much more enjoyable. But overall, a fine beer."
"Muchas gracias to johnrobe for this one. My favorite of the Highland brews (so far). Pours a very dark brown with a medium and pretty tan head. Little lacing. Aroma of coffee, chocolate and nuts. Medium bodied with a nice roasty blend of chocolate and espresso (which would be a mocha I guess). Finish is a little nutty and a little hoppy. Pretty good."
"""Oatmeal"" porter? Got to hand it to Highland, it's a new one on me! I've never been to North Carolina, but if I ever go, I'll know what to drink. I tip my hat to Uglyradio for the trade."
"Poured nicely on tap dark brown with ruby tinge,nice tan colored head wich went away quickley.Smelled very much like roasted malt with chocolate also prevalent.A little more hoppy than I expected with some fruity character to go with chocalty taste.A little thin in body and mouthfeel for me,but it went down pretty easy."
"This brew pours a dark, dark brown with auburn highlights around the edges where the light comes through. A light tan head develops nicely but ultimately reduces to a cap. In the aroma, some citrusy hops announce their presence along with roasted malt, and what smells like sweet bread...I assume it's the oatmeal. Citrusy hops appear prominently in the taste as well but don't overwhelm, as a host of dark roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate flavors permeate your tastebuds. The mouthfeel is, well, ""soft"" (I can't think how else to describe it...the brew is not rich enough to call it creamy). A highly quaffable porter, very well done! I expected the oatmeal to cause this to be a somewhat sweet porter, but this has more in company with other well-hopped porters like SN."
"Much more pleasant than many other hoppy dark beers such as Anderson Valley Oatmeal Stout -- Highland just seems to be better balanced and not over the top on hops."
"On tap @ Barley's Taproom, Greenville, SC. Dark brown with ruby hues. Creamy tan head with good lace. Chocolate malty and sweet dark bready aroma. Roasted bitterness is nicely balanced by a hint of oatmeal sweetness. Medium bodied mouthfeel. Good quaffability. Nicely done and definitely worth a try."
"Good beer...Support Highland Brewing Co. if your in the Asheville, NC area."
"Walnut rimmed black under a sticky tan head. Toasty and fruity hop nose more indicative of a Pale than anything else. A draught is a subdued roasted malt that finishes long and hop flavorful. Coffee beans and dark chocolate are there, but definitely not first seat as you would expect in a Porter of this hue. Nice hairless texture thanks to our buddy the oat. A blind tasting might conjure the idea of an American Amber with lots of ass. After the initial shock to the senses you'll find a unique Porter that's really quite tasty and hophead friendly."
"Thought I'd give this a try, and I'm glad I did. This unique porter pours a dark, dark brown with a sizeable tan head that has some nice lacing ability. The smell is of roasted malt and hops. The taste is pretty comparable to the aroma, with the hops taking precedence as the beer warms up a bit. More of that oatmeal flavor comes through, as well. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth and is a pretty easy drinker for the style. I look forward to trying more brews from Highland."
"Decent porter. A bit hoppy and has a really faint thin burnt bitterness towards the end. Would be better if it were more balanced with the malt. Great moutfeel, though. Really velvety. Nice appearence, really dark, good tan head tops it off."
