"O: Like the balance here, freshness and hopping with the light dry nature of toasted chipotle peppers against a sweetly roasted porter malting that is light in character allowing the chipotle peppers to be better exposed and balanced. Nice lingering peppery spicing lasts awhile, is easy drinking, very enjoyable with a good smoked nature, hopping and balance."

"Had the same beer from a bottle at room temperature and it was phenomenal!  The peppers come through much clearer when the beer is at room temperature.  The pepper taste is nice, but not sinus clearing."
"Great tasting beer. My girlfriend likes it and so do I. I really want  to try this on tap."

"Love this porter. The chipotle flavor mixes well with the porter and has just a touch of heat on the back side. I always enjoy when I find a few of these."

"O-   I love the stone smoked porter series- pretty much all of them.  I also love chipotle-but this beer is much more aggressive than the others in the porter series.  The heat from the peppers lingers on and on-which is a good thing-but it covers up the real complexity of this brew."
""
"3.5 D:  I like this version of the beer quite a bit.  If only they buffed up the smoke."

""
""
""
""
" Overall â€“ Ah a somewhat decent porter, but the hot pepper sorta throws me off and makes it not really a nice sipping brew and not one I will come back to.  I much prefer the standard or the vanilla over this, but if you like spicy things then this may be up your alley."

"Overall: A pretty good twist on an already great porter. Good roasty malt taste with a nice kick of heat from the added pepper."
""
"Pours a nice deep reddish brown with a one finger head that quickly dissipates. Not much smell to the beer but definitely has a porter smell. Tastes is typical of a porter but very much light bodied and the pepper is subdued with just the slightest of burn at the end. You can taste the smokiness and the pepper but it is very easy on the mouth. Not a lot of body and a bit watery. Overall an ok beer that you could drink easily."
""
""
""

"I found it quite enjoyable. Don't consume with other hot food, or the characteristics will probably be lost. Might go very well with some nice honey-BBQ'd chicken, pork, or veggies."

"O: smoked jalapeno flavor is prominent above all else rather than complementing the other flavors"
""
""
""
"Dated best by 8/9/14. Poured into a goblet, a very dark dark red, slightly translucent. Very thin off white head. Aroma was smoky, with a hint of dark chocolate. Flavor was smoky, but also spicey. Mellowed out, and then pepper kicked back in with a hint of heat. Interesting flavor, definitely an acquired/desired taste. Felt thin, not overwhelmingly so, but with a bit of carbonation tingle. Overall definitely a sipper. Unique flavor, not in a bad way, but unique."
""
"O - This beer is remarkably well balanced - especially for a pepper-infused brew. The medium body and relatively low ABV make it perfect for a summer sip on the porch. Also, while the chipotles definitely provide some heat, this too is just right. Well done, Stone."

"Picked up a bottle on the recommendation of the beer shop guy. I tend to be disappointed by Stone but took the recommendation. Good looking beer with a good smoke smell but seems a little off. Flavor is okay, but certainly not great, similar to smell there was something a bit off. The late bite from the peppers in interesting but not enough to change the fact that this is just an average porter with a twist."
"O: I liked the spiciness that the chipotle lended to this beer, but felt like it had too much iodine. I would have enjoyed it better if it had more smoky flavors."
"In general, a bit too spicy and light on the roasted malt quality."
""
""
""

"Overall, this is interesting, well made and a bit of a novelty."

"This American porter is decent enough. It comes across better with its dark malt porter character than its chili beer aspect. Mild and approachable as both a porter and a chili-flavored beer, so it should appeal to a wide audience that may what to try or indulge in both styles. Still, it may let down hardcore fans of either style with generally low-key aspects of either type of beer."
""
"The beer is dark mahogany with an off-white head. Aromas of hickory, smoke, roast, char, cacao, peppers. Nice flavor - everything comes together nicely. Peppery heat is there, but doesn't overwhelm or fatigue the palate. Chocolate and roast with some earthy hop character in the finish. not something I would have regularly, but this was a fun beer. A good candidate for sharing a few ways."
""
""
""
"D: Have had this before a few times at the brewery and it is always fun to try but not my favorite by any means. Not that it is a bad offering and I am sure this has great food applications like a Chili or BBQ sauce. But I think the Chipotles tend to overbear the thinner Porter at times and would work much better in a thick hearty IRS instead. If I had to choose I would stick with the original or Vanilla Stone Porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's not a bad beer, but a bit hot for me. I do like their porter, but as mentioned, this is too hot. That said, I assume a pepper beer should be hot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - drinking this on its own, but this would be a great pairing for some BBQ meat. The spice is subtle, and the chipotle flavor is big. It melds a lot better with the base porter then it would any other style IMO."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Two years ago, I had the Vanilla Bean Smoked Porter...which I didn't like. This on the other hand, I do like. It makes want a big ol' bowl of chili to pair it up with. It's no Schlenkerla Marzen, but what is?! Nice work, Stone."
""
"I've tried chile bears before, but was never impressed before now. This blows them all away. Who'd have ever thought a porter could be classified as a good summer brew? Yet, the spice makes it so."
""
""
""
"Pours like a dark brown ale but tastes like a porter. The flavor from the smoked malt gives this brew a phenolic taste, and paired with the chipotle peppers turns out to be a pretty interesting brew. I drank this with cheez-its and it was amazing."

"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, amber-highlighted chestnut coloring with a tall, foamy, frothy, bubbly, light tan head. Aromas of subtle smoke, chocolate, coffee, and a subtle pepper spice. The nose is fairly light compared to what I was preparing for, I guess. Flavors are more pepper forward, with spice and a subtle heat, followed by chocolate and mocha notes, subtle roasted bitterness, and a subtle creamy highlight, as well. The chipotle flavors are a nice twist on the base beer. The beer is light and smooth in mouth, has a steady flow of carbonation throughout, and leaves a very decent lacing along the glass as you drink. Chipotle and chocolate aftertaste, with a building heat as you go. The finish is smooth and slightly dry, and that pepper heat continues to linger. Solid brew."

"O: I do like this beer quite a bit, backed down peppers would have made it exceptional."
""

""
""
"The dark brown body was clearer, and lighter looking than what I typically expect from the style, but it was nice looking, and had a one finger thick, beige colored head. The smell of the beer was quite smoky, and smelled like really dark roasted coffee mixed with caramel flavor. There wasn't much chipotle pepper in the smell, but the flavor was right up front in the taste. It was a lot spicier than I was expecting, and the flavor of peppers was all over my tongue immediately. It was backed by semi sweet chocolate with hints of almond. The pepper never relented throughout the taste and lingered on in the finish. The beer felt thinner onn the palette than was the norm for the style, but when your tongue is on fire from the chili pepper, who cares. I love the peppery boldness of this brew."

"Pretty decent take on a chille beer, but was hoping for way more. Way better than crime no matter how you slice it"
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is good modestly thin body and moderate carbonation leave this on the thinner side for porters. Moderate amounts of heat from the peppers give this a nice kick."
""
"Poured from 650 ml bomber into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted on 5/31/2014."
""
""
"I though the flavors went well together. I liked how the pepper hung around without being overwhelming."
""
""
""
""

"22oz bottle. Pours a blackish dark brown color with an inch of very light brown head. Some lacing. The aroma is smoke, charred wood, spicy peppers and earth. The taste is the spicy chipotle peppers upfront as well as some charcoal and smoke. Some peat as well. Finishes with the heat of the peppers and nice mellow spicy aftertaste. Hints of dark chocolate as the beer warms. Light mouthfeel with alot of carbonation. Just like the Vanilla Bean one it is a nice variation but the original Stone Smoked Porter is still the best to me. Still this is a good Porter that isn't overly spicy or hot. Overall, worth trying at least once."

"As advertised, especially on the palate, this smoked porter is generous on the chipotle. As it warms it may be just a touch too much so. Yet tasty nonetheless."

"I'm a sucker for spicy pepper beers. The smoke really compliments the pepper. I'd definitely drink it again with some BBQ food."

"Honestly, I probably won't get this beer again. Not that it was poorly crafted, rather I did not find it refreshing and the with the heat on the back of your tongue, it just felt plain weird."
""
""
"I think I would have enjoyed this more, if they used a hotter pepper, perhaps a harbenero"
""
"Oddly disjointed yet it has bright spots, this beer hits you in parts, sweet malt, smoked malt, hops and chipotle. I was hoping for a more integrated spicy smokey BBQ effect. The chili pepper flavors which I often don't enjoy (typically when serrano or ancho chilies are used) are completely masked by the hops and the capsaicin in turn masks the bitterness and alcohol. Malt is rather clean despite the fact there is little to no drying effect."
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown pour into a glass measuring cup (lol). Even a slow pour produced a pretty substantial head, off-white, simmering down to a patchy foam. Aroma of bready malts, smoke, some vegetal notes from the chipotle. Pretty much what you'd expect. In the taste, roasty dark malts, toasted bread, smoke, charred wood, slight dry heat from the peppers in the finish. [Interestingly, when I used this beer for a caramelized portobello reduction, the spice came out significantly.] This was a medium bodied beer, fairly good for the style, even if it's a style I'm not a big fan of. There's no way I'd be able to drink a bomber of this myself, and even for one small glass, I'd really have to be in the mood."
""
"D: some tasty stuff. especially if you are in the mood, which I feel like you have to be with a spicy brew. but this one is hitting the marks and goes down good. pass."
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a good beer to drink for a while if you enjoy the hot pepper beers."
"Overall, this is a good addition to the smoked porter variant line up. Not quite as good as the vanilla version, but still very good."
"O: outstanding representation of American porter style with the added bonus of smoke and chipotle. Very refreshing brew!"
""
"O: Much like the standard smoked porter from Stone, this is very nice and easy drinking. The peppers bring a big punch of flavor to the party. It borders on overpowering the rest of the brew."
"A nice take on this classic beer. The chipotles showed nicely which doesn't always happen in beers like this."

"O: wow is there a lot of heat in this thing"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The peppers definitely provide a nice distinct angle on the base beer. They work nicely with the light smokiness and help to dial down any residual sweetness. The 5.9% abv makes this quite quaffable as well. Solid limited release"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Really just a smoked beer with hints of heat from the peppers. I am happy that I was able to try this. I am not sure I would buy this again to drink, but would like to try to cooking with it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied, well carbonated brew with a Chipolte flavor, as well as building heat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, decent smoked porter, the peppers tend to get a little overbearing by the end of a 22oz bottle."
"I'm surprised I like this one so much less than the Vanilla Bean Smoked Porter -- I guess the vanilla just added a lot more depth for me. This beer has a beautiful pour and great mouthfeel, but that's about where it ends. The taste of this one just isn't quite doing it for me. I don't mind the level of heat, but I wish Stone would tone back on it to focus a bit more on some roasted characteristics or something along those lines -- maybe a chocolate sort of flavor. Like I said, I can definitely get the similarities of this beer with Vanilla Bean Smoked Porter with the beer's base, but I guess the chipotle just doesn't add as much to the base as the vanilla bean did for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's a good beer, nice smoky flavor, a beer I would drink with a spicy dish. I eat a lot of spicy foods but this one gets no one near my level of tolerance. A little pricey, I paid $2.99 for a 12 ounce bottle which equals $18 a six pack. Unless I can find it cheaper somewhere else, probably won't purchase again."

"I poured this into a standard 12-oz mug. The beer is very dark--completely opaque--with a small but lasting head of tan foam. The aroma is great--wonderful maltiness, with a light smokiness, and a sharp scent of chiles. Taste mirrors this. There's a good black patent malt flavor, but it doesn't dominate, and lets the smoky flavor come through well--a nice subtle smokiness I should add. The phenols are not overpowering. The chipotle taste is more apparent in the aroma than to taste, but there's still there if you look--especially at the finish. The body is a little thin and watery, the only downside to this beer. Otherwise, very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this hits all the right areas for me. Porter, smoked, chipotle peppers, sitting on my deck in the rain, smoking a duck at high noon! Does life get any better?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass."
""
""
""
"Just like the smell the taste was just of the smoke, with a hint of the pepper. Everything was just muted, with no tastes popping, which I am hoping was just the beer being too old, and not the taste of the beer. I would not rule out oxygenation as the culprit to me not liking the taste, but overall it was just not a good experience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- and interesting take on a porter. The base beer itself is pretty good, but I feel like it needed a little more smokiness to match up with the pepper flavor. As I'm finishing this, the pepper is becoming more noticeable in the palate. Definitely worth a try and might go well with certain foods"
""
" Overall: Really tasty, nicely integrated pepper spice. I've had spicier, and more flavorful, but in terms of overall balance and integration for a pepper beer best I've had thus far."

"Overall this stuff is pretty interesting. It's got a lot going on but like I find with all chilli beers, is a bit too obscure to want on a regular basis. I say try it, just think twice on buying a bunch at one time"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The chipotle was a nice, fun addition that added a slight bit of heat to the palate throughout the entire course of the beer. Overall, though, I'd rather just have the regular Smoked Porter. At the end of the day, Stone has created an elegant porter with plenty of nice smokey and malty flavors - why cover it up with chipotle?"
""
"Experimenting with extra flavors in an already superior brew proves here to be fun, but not an improvement over the OG. Appearance is the classic porter total solar eclipse. Thick head, of course. Olfactory stimulation of the expected sort: smoke, roasted malt, with latent jalepeÃ±o. Feels mighty nice against the gums. Bubbly smooth but creamy dreamy. The taste is complex, with the roasty toasty malt porter delicious coming initially, and the Mexican chili busting thru on delay. Swell enough for certain, but I'm daydreaming of ol' Stone Smoked Porter."
"D/O: Strong all-around, but for a chile beer this version of Stone Smoked Porter is particularly effective. Favorably drinkable due to restrained but detectable chile presence, it is more than a novelty and never a chore to drink. Beware of this beer when it is available on cask service--legend has it that heat varies widely."
"I like chili beers, but this just didn't mix well together."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very interesting beer! I like the spicy aftertaste as this makes the overall porter much more interesting. In terms of what makes this a porter though, I basically just get the smokiness. Not as much of the robust, rounded sweetness that comes with a typical porter- I'm thinking of flavours such as dark fruits, caramel, coffee, chocolate. It's dominated by the chipotle pepper which is the point of the beer. It doesn't overshadow the relative lack of porter characteristics in my opinion. But the fact remains that the flavour profile is different and I won't begrudge it for that. (4)"

"Bought at Bev Mo. Pours a dark brown with a tan head. Smells are slight chipotle, coffee and overall roastiness. Tastes is roasted, a little coffee. A touch of pepper comes up after a bit, delayed response. Well carbonated, maybe too much. Overall pretty enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This is a fun beer. It's good, but I'd like to see the chipotle play more of a backing role instead of the main attraction."
""
""
""
""
"This is great. The base beer is great, of course, and the chipotle just adds to it. I might prefer it if it were a bit hotter, but the mellowness is charming in its own way. I hope to actually see this on a shelf someday."

"A great porter, dark with large retained creamy head. Moderately smoked aroma. The mouthfeel is creamy. A substantive smoke taste, chocolate malt, the hot pepper in the background. Satisfying and enormously drinkable. ALtogether a tasty spicy mix.From Lueken Liquors."

""
""
""
"I'd never tried a beer with hot peppers before, so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. It's far from eating an actual pepper, but the spiciness is unmistakably there. Not bad, but it doesn't really elevate Stone's standard smoked porter any. Surprisingly, smoke may be the faintest of the flavors to be found here. Stone Chipotler Smoked Porter is a novelty worth trying for the curious, but not something I would relish to have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a good smoked porter. It isn't surprising that Stone would bring out a quality one."
"Stone's chipotle treated Smoked Porter pours jet black. A finger's worth of caramel colored foam finishes of the look. Head retention is just alright, but the beer leaves a respectable amount of lacing behind. The nose has aromas not-too-sweet dark chocolate, light smoke, and a decent bit of chipotle pepper. The flavor profile leads off with a lightly roasty, bittersweet dark chocolate taste from the base beer. The peppers come in next, filling in the space usually taken up in a beer by the hops. The heat provides a very nice balance to the beer's maltiness. It also transitions nicely into a faintly smoky finish. The body is nice, a little bit full but not as chewy as I might find from a more straight ahead, 100% malt driven beer. The carbonation is nice and subdued. I'm pleasantly surprised at how much I found myself enjoying Stone Smoked Porter w/ Chipotle. I expected to enjoy the vanilla bean variant more, but that's far from the case. Then again, I've also enjoyed the other pepper beers I've had from Stone, so I guess I can just add this one to the list."
"Overall: a surprisingly good beer. I had some reservations, but the brewers used a light touch when adding the chipotle, and I think it paid off well. Balance and drinkability are great; I would definitely have this again."
""
""
""
"Overall one of the better pepper inspired beers yet strictly novelty. One and done."
"O: I like the original smoked porter by stone so naturally I would like this one as well. The chipotle pepper adds a little extra complexity to an already complex porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is very nice- medium light body, light carbonation, and a little chile spice. This is an awesome beer. I wish that it were available year-round in a six-pack, as I would buy it frequently. Highly recommend."
""
"Overall, it's a decent beer and the peppers match with the smoke decently."
"O --- I really love this beer! I'm sure it go well with BBQ, but it's solid by itself."
""
"O: Drinkable, tasty, and enjoyable. Would have again, but probably wouldn't buy. Tentatively recommended."

"I enjoyed this one more than the vanilla, though porters aren't really my thing."
""
""
"o - great version of the smoked porter. i paired this with some ribs and that was a great idea!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Another very good variation on the Stone Smoked Porter. I think I like the vanilla variation a tad better, if only because I enjoy the flavor of vanilla more than that of chipotle peppers, but I think this one shows better execution. I hope Stone continues to offer both, if not year round, then at least as seasonal releases, because they're both great alternatives to the OG Smoked Porter."
"[O] Apparently this beer has been around for a while but this is the first year its been bottled - and it's in competition with the vanilla version for a chance at another bottling run...Stone - Get your shit together and bottle each. They are both fantastic."

"Pretty nice, but i prefer the original, although i would happily drink another one (at $6 for 12 oz. i only bought one)."
"Overall - Stone Smoked Porter has always been one of my favorite porters, and I feel that the chipotle peppers are a wonderful addition. I had this one poured from a bottle into a snifter glass. Can't wait to drink another!"

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 9/26/2012. Pours crystal clear very dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger dense khaki head with excellent retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing rings cling down the glass. Aromas of chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, toffee, smoke, chipotle pepper, light coffee, and light herbal hops. Damn nice aromas with great balance and strength. Taste of chocolate, caramel, smoke, roasted malt, chipotle pepper, coffee, toffee, citrus, and herbal hops. Light amount of citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, chipotle pepper, light coffee, citrus, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance of classic porter flavor with the chipotle peppers; the heat does start to build up in the back as you drink, but it just fine with me. No cloying flavors on the palate at all after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed on the finish, unless the peppers are masking it. Overall this is a highly excellent porter! Fantastic flavor balance with the special ingredient; very smooth to drink despite the pepper heat build up. Highly enjoyable offering; I hope it makes a comeback around here sometime."

"O - good beer. Could see this going with a wide array of foods which is a plus, yet it was not as intense as I was expecting."

"O: Really great pepper beer. The rich dark malts balance with the light peppers. Tasty and enjoyable. Mole anyone?"

"O: Best example of a chile infused beer that I can recall tasting. Perhaps because the base beer is of such quality. A good fall beverage."

"Stoneâ€™s Smoked Porter is a very good beer. I canâ€™t say that the addition of chipotle peppers improved it. It didnâ€™t. It does make for an interesting beer thatâ€™s pretty good. I do like it. Nice experimentation thatâ€™s worth trying."
"Stone Smoked Porter with Chipotle Peppers pours out a deep brown with a small head. The aroma is malty and smoky with just a hint of sweet and smokey peppers. The peppers become stronger on the nose as the beer warms up. The taste is very good, it's got the strong smoke flavor that the original beer has, but complimented with some smoky and slightly sweet peppers that provide just a bit of heat to the finish. The peppers actually bring the smoke more to the forefront than the base beer I feel, and it's better for it. The mouthfeel seems fuller than I remember the base beer to be, but that might just be faulty memory. The drinkability is great. Overall, this is a great treatment of a solid beer. It's just really tasty."
"O: I feel much the same way about this beer as I did about the vanilla smoked porter. The chipotle starts to run away with the show, and it could do with a bit more carbonation to give a little dimension to the mouthfeel. That being said, I liked this beer just a bit better. The chipotle is more of a natural compliment to the smokey flavors, rather than being at odds with it like the vanilla seemed to be."
"M: Medium bodied, with pretty low carbonation."
"Nice porter. True to style and with that delectable smoky spice element. Recommended. 4.0"
""
""
"Indeed it does smell of a quite nice blend of chocolate malt, smoke, and chipotle peppers. I have a special fondness for combinations like this, it reminds me of a good mole sauce. The flavor is a bit more complex than the nose, it also contains a fair amount of coffee and herbal tobacco flavors. It's got a good gentle warming heat from the chile that is neither too strong nor too weak. A very solidly constructed chile beer all around!"
"O - a smoke bomb with the chilli heat complimenting rather than stealing the spotlight, very well done"
""
"Was hoping for a bit more of a chipotle kick. This tastes fairly similar to the regular smoked porter."
""
"Pours a near opaque black with very light tan head that retains fairly well and laces nicely. Nose has quite a bit of pepper smoke on it, plus a hint of ""green"" from peppers - a vegetal or almost herbal quality. On the palate is just a tingle of pepper heat, roasted malt, silky smooth body, and some bitter chocolate. Finish is roasty and peppered with a dancing tingle of heat on the palate afterwards. One of the mildest pepper beers I've had."
""
""
"o: Smokiness and heat from chipotle peppers are upfront as advertised. The peppers are strong but not overly so. I enjoyed the flavor. So many times I've had beers which are flavored in a certain way and it is barely detectable to me. I would not necessarily seek this out again but it was enjoyable."
""
"I'll have another."
"Overall, the flavors seem a bit subdued and washed out. It's decent, but I was expecting more. I do like this a bit better than the vanilla version."
"O: This is a solid beer. This isnt anything I would go crazy about getting, but I would sure try it again."
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a dark brown, appearing black in the glass. One finger medium brown head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of toasted malt, chocolate with a hint of smoke and an undefineable vegetable component. Flavor is a mellow mixture of toasted and smoked malt, dark dried fruit and chocolate, finishing with nice hot pepper and smoke. The pepper is distinct, but deftly done. The base flavor is most like the English export style of porter. This is very well integrated with an excellent balance of flavors. Nice medium to heavy, creamy body. A great smoked porter."
""
"Stone smoked porter was one of the first beers I had when I broke into the scene and it blew me away. Solid malt foundation with signature grassy hops and an interesting wildcard in the chipotle peppers. The latter not being overdone, complements the vibrant smoke, bitter coffee, and semi-sweet chocolate oh so nicely."
"Overall nice, good malt flavors, smoke, etc, with a light chipotle heat, nice overall flavors , they all blend well with great flavors but still drinkable and nice long finish."
""
"O - I think I'd rather just have the smoked porter. The peppers don't add enough flavor or heat to really be worth it to me."
"Overall: this is a great BBQ beer, and for a smoked beer this one is well balanced. Definitely enjoyable but limited to one or two pints in a session."
"Overall, a very nice take on the normal smoked porter. The pepper addition is well thought out and executed nicely."
"This is a pretty disappointing beer. The peppers dominate rather than compliment the beer. The roasted malts and the smokiness don't get a chance to shine here as they should. If you love peppers then this is great albeit unbalanced. I'll stick with the regular smoked porter."
"(O)- Overall, I like this take on the regular smoked porter. Well integrated without taking over the base beer. Instead, the chipotle is integrated well into the beer and adds a new dimension to the overall smoked quality. Well done."
""
""
""
"I'm really digging the flavor the chipotles give this beer. Very roasty beer producing a modicum of heat that intensifies the more you drink it. This beer would pair extremely well with anything at a barbecue...or a Burger King."
""
"M - A very tasty beer, and the clear winner of the mini-smoked porter competition. Its tasty and the burn is oh so pleasant, but like ordering a sandwich with what you believe to be hot jalapenos peppers and instead receiving those lame mild peppers, I found myself wanting more burn!"
""
""
"O: $4.50 for the bottle, you can't really beat it. Delicious porter that stands out against its competition. I preferred this to the Vanilla Bean version, and overall I think it was better than the original."
"O- An interesting combination that worked well with a black bean and chorizo burrito. Not sure I would want it on its own."
""
"this is a great chipotle ale.. one of the tastiest ones i've had.. i do however enjoy the spicyness, which this beer lacked. i think the fade to black this last year was what i was looking for in an ale like this."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not too great but worth a try. I like the vanilla been one better."
""
""
"A pretty interesting offering here; however, the chipotle peppers are a bit much, really taking over this Porter's other natural flavors."
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with red/brown highlights with lots of tan head. Subtle bits of smoke and spice, as well as darkly roasted malt, an appealing nose for sure. Taste follows with smoke and distinct spicy afterburn. Slight coffee, but hops are lost among the rest. Not for everyone but I kinda like it. Spicyness is a tad over the top and overshadows the beer. But about midway it tones down and it was more enjoyable. Mouthfeel is good and overall a good interesting beer."
"Mouthfeel is good, high medium to full bodied. Carbonation level is good. Starts off pretty smooth, but the flavors kind of stomp on that after a little. Peppers provide a nice unique aspect here. The heat creeps up on you. It's not vicious but it makes itself known. Balance is key here and it's got balance. The addition of the peppers make Stone an evil genius. The heat makes you want to drink more and more until it's gone, which makes it drinkable as all hell. Nice unique beer. I have one more, curious to see what some age does to this one."
"12oz. bottle served in a nonic. Pours the color and clarity of cola with a dense, two inch, khaki-colored head. Head eventually settles into an eighth inch cap - some spots and strands of lacing are exposed; however, they exhibit poor retention. Nose expresses smoke and chile peppers with a slightly sweet character that manifests between the smoke and spice. Taste follows nose; however, the flavor profile is a bit more watered down than implied by the nose - the smoke and chiles intermingle nicely without overshadowing one another. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with an easy, even carbonation. There's a little residual heat in the mouth and at the back of the tongue if the brew is given the opportunity to linger and warm. An interesting interplay of smoke and spice; however, I still enjoy the original offering to the variants. That said, I wish I saved some of the vanilla bean variety to blend as I think it would have created an interesting montage of flavors."
""
"Overall a very tasty and interesting beer. Far superior to the Vanilla bean version."
""
"O- I really like the pepper addition to this beer. Adds another layer of flavour to this brew."
""
"Pours a mid-black with a two-finger milk chocolate brown head. Solid lacing for the style. Roasty and smoky aroma. Big roasted malt notes, a bit of roasted chocolate, and of course, a good smoky vibe to the nose. Flavor follows. Roasted malts, roasted chocolate, and a bit of coco sweetness to start. A hint of bittering hops before a smoky finish, not over assertive, but lives up to the name of the beer. Pleasant smoke notes. At the very back end, nice chipotle notes. Not spicy, but minor heat and very tasty. Great variation of the tasty smoked porter. Very good smoke and chipotle profile while maintaining nice drinkability. Very hard thing to do and Stone nailed it."
""
""
""
"I'm really impressed by this version of the Smoked Porter. The chipotle peppers turn it up a notch, though at the same time it is still remarkably easy to drink. I enjoyed this much more than the vanilla bean version and I have to say it's better than the orginal too. Recommended."
"Overall, this is a uniquely dry beer from Stone."
""
""
"Blackish, deep brown color with a fine creamy head that leaves behind only a few spots of lace. Smoky, dark chocolate and chili aromas. The chipotles obviously work well with the mild smoked malt character of the base beer. Flavors of bittersweet cocoa, slight smoke, and subdued pepper that leaves just a hint of heat way down deep in the throat. Medium bodied and tingly with some dryness in the finish. Quite subtle in the pepper department, but I imagine this would go great with certain food."
""
"maybe the best chilli beer ive ever had. its got all the same great characteristics as the regular smoked porter, but the chipotle pepper adds a lot in my opinion. the pour is lovely, excited and invigorated light brown head on a dense dark brew. the smell is where the peppers really bring something special. they compliment the peaty smoked malts with a spicy roundness that really makes me want to drink up. the flavor is not hot at all, rather as the label says, its like one of those fine chilli chocolates, where the pepper adds flavor and not heat. such is the case with this, very complex finish on a decadent beer. feel is great too, smooth and rich, dancing on the tongue from front to back sweet to spice. i really really like it, and used it as a secret ingredient in a buffalo meat and heirloom tomato chilli that was sensational. this beer is fabulous!"
"Poured a deep chocolate brown with a bit of deep ruby showing thru when held up to the light,a thinner light beige head atop.Smoke and molasses really come into play in the nose,the chipotle provides mild smoke and heat.The body is a tad thin and doesn't hold up that well to the fuller flavors.A bit earthy upfront with light smoke and lightly sweet molasses notes rounding it out,the chili's come in the finish and after taste.It's not bad but it's not nearly as good as the standard smoked porter,the vanilla was not anything earth shattering either."
""
"O: Overall this is a very good example of the chipotle enhancing a beer rather than overpowering or dominating a beer. This is enjoyable but definitely not a beer that I could have over and over again - not sessionable and not one I want to have multiple times."
""
"O: This is a great example of a pepper beer, not overwhelming but just enough to add to the base beer."
"I tried this beer when it was fresh. It was a mess. Somehow, a little bit of time has allowed to chipotle to really fuse with base beer. Nice backing spicy smokiness. Well done sirs, well done."
"The flavor profile starts off with a hint of sweetness, quickly overcome by the smoke notes and a mild chile spice on the end. Itâ€™s lightly spicy and an easy sipper, in spite of or because of the kick at the end. Warms well and opens generously. Iâ€™d like to try the vanilla version of this one and I hope that this remains an option."
"Overall: I enjoyed the mix of smoked malt with the smoked peppers. Definitely interested in another given the chance."
"O: I've read some negative reviews and heard some bad things, but this one really worked for me. Stone recommends a scoop of vanilla ice cream with their regular Smoked Porter, but I'm thinking backyard BBQ with this one...."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Gotta say, I'm a little disappointed in this. Started off good in the smell, but even that didn't last, & seemed to carry the challenging parts of the flavor components without the reward. So abrasive in some ways, flat in others."
""
""
"O: Not the best stone or porter I've encountered, but it's good. I expect porters to be lighter than their stout counterparts, but I'm not a fan of that grassy sense. The notable trait of this beer is it's moderate roasty/spicy sense, that would go great with certain foods. By itself, it's far from my favorite porter, but it's a hell of a lot better than anything domestic. I would recommend based on price and food pairing."
"M - Medium body, creamy. light carbonation."
""
"Overall, I was surprised that I enjoyed this one more than the Vanilla Bean version. This carries the right mesh and mix of smoke and spice. Usually pepper beers are just a mess, but this one comes off very well. It was more a pleasure to drink than the vanilla bean version. I like it."
"Medium bodied with a spicy, peppery kick that compliments the smoked/roasted malt without becoming too hot or overpowering. The meaty smoked malt flavors still dominate with hints of burnt toast, charcoal, BBQ, bacon, coffee bean and dark chocolate. There's some sweeter malt and lactic cream for balance. Hints of lighter chocolate, caramel and toffee before more peppery heat shows up in the finish. The peppers are nicely integrated into the flavor without taking over and killing off the characteristics of the base. Peppers become more prominent as it warms but it's still nicely balanced and really tasty."
""
""
"O/D-This a toss up between the Vanilla Bean SP or the Chipotle Pepper SP. I wasn't expecting to like this one as much as I did. Chipotle is just enough. It take the base beer hostage. I enjoyed this a bunch."
""
"O: A decent beer. All the flavors seem to work, but in the end, its just not that exciting of a beer."
""
""
"Pours a thin light brown color fairly opaque, with a large frothy tan head that is slow to recede leaving a ton of heavy lacing. Smells mostly of smoked malts with not much pepper in the nose. First sip starts sweet then quickly turns up the heat with the chipotle pepper leaving a slight but welcomed burn. Pretty good balance here as neither the smoked malts or the pepper overpowers the other. Throw in some chocolate notes too that just add to the overall complexity. The beer is blessed with a creamy mouthfeel adding to the experience. Very nice indeed."
""
"If you like smoke, then this is one to try."
"Overall, nice. I hope they make this available again."
""
"Pours dark black with a hint of ruby. Good head and nice lacing through consumption. This chipotle version definitely enhances the smokey aroma - its impossible to miss as you raise the glass,to your face. The hero is the flavor. Enhanced smokey flavor with some subtle spiced chocolate notes up front but then the kicker is the spice that lingers well on the very back end. The chipotle really kicks in late - not even fair to say its on the backend of this train - the best of the chipotle comes well after the caboose. Well done."
"It doesn't take long before this totally wears out its welcome. Hot, dirty, extremely dry, and bitter in unrelieved rotation. Interesting for a taste, but not drinkable. From the 12 oz bottle."
""
""
"Decent, the pepper flavor seems to slowly be a bit too much or perhaps this beer has become too clean. Flavors seem not to fully mesh but all in all it works."
""
""
""
"Overall this beer doesn't do it for me personally in the flavor department. I'm a huge fan of smoked porter but the peppers trigger a strange mental fixation for me. Honestly I was surprised at how nicely the peppers compliment this beer though."
""
"Overall this is a pretty smackable beer that you are going to love or hate. I believe one is sufficient for a session. Give it a shot if you are into spicy foods and porters!"
""
""
""
"O: Pretty decent. You really have to be in the mood for chili beers, but if you are... this is a good one. The flavors are there and the spice is spot on. It's not too powerful. I'd drink this beer again."
"Pours a black tea brown with garnet highlights and a 1 inch cap of dense light tan foam that stuck around for a few minutes before leaving a sticky coating of lacing around the glass. Greets your senses with a firm dose of smoky, spicy pepper. The base beer is clearly noticeable too with that unmistakable peat smoke riding just ahead of a bitter chocolate and dark roast malt. Carbonation is fairly modest providing a near creamy mouthfeel that combines with the smoky, roasty, vegetal flavors to suggest a great pairing with bbq'd meats. You might expect a dose of spice from the chipotle peppers but I think this is coming through more as a slight warming/tingle on the palette. I'll be seeking out the Vanilla Bean version soon for fair comparison but a beer this good will be hard to top."
""
"O- I like this better than the regular smoked porter. just enough pepper to give it some spice and a touch of heat."
""
"M: It's medium. A smooth medium, that surrounds the mouth."
"O- I really am enjoying this beer. Was a bit hesitant with the chipoltle peppers as an ingredient. Frankly I usually dont like chili beers. Well done!"
""
""
""
"Poured from 12oz bottle. Pours a dark brown/black color with a medium, light tan head that goes down quickly. Scent is very similar to the regular smoked porter...peat-like smoke with some lovely roasted malt and chocolate. A little bit of coffee and mild chipotle aroma. Taste is...mmm yummy. At first I get roasted malt with chipotle. Very slowly and steadily it transforms into smokey, chocolatey, with a little bit of heat on the tip of the tongue and in the back of the throat. Lovely mix of toasted malt, smoke, heat, pepper flavor, and chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is a fantastic version of an already fantastic beer."
"Overall: I'm a fan of the chipotle addition. The base beer is good, and while this version doesn't blow my mind, I do think it's an improvement (or at least a worthy digression)."
"The palate opens with a rather excellent blend and balance of smoke, roast and the peppers. It's been a looong time since I've had the base beer, but it really does shine through here. Smoky, robustly roasty with the smoke and roast forming a bit of a continuum while managing to bypass being ashy, this is really nice. The chipotle manages to find its own niche and adds an enjoyable accent to the beer. Mildly fleshy, very mildly spicy and a moderate smoke character from the peppers are present. The cocoa and chocolate come through right before the finish, lending a mild sweetness. Drying, roasty and delicately smoky and spicy on the finish, this beer is medium-light in body, moderately carbonated and rather excellent on the palate. A thoroughly enjoyable beer."
""
"O - the peppers work very well with a terrific base beer."
""
"O: I personally like it. It's a well made porter to begin with, then add in the smoke and the chipotle peppers and it gets a fantastic complexity. I could see where some might not like the intensity of the peppers on the palate, but Stone often goes bold or goes home and this is no exception."
"Taste-Roasted coffee,smoky, subtle roasted peppers provide a ""tingly"" bite. Very flavorfull with a sneaky spiciness and subtle warmth. Very tasty. Yum!"
""
""
"O: a nice addition to Stone Smoked Porter and the peppers seem to play and mix a bit better than the Vanilla variant. I hope this one comes back as it's a treat."
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style with carbonation being a little above average. Overall, I thought it was a pretty good beer. The peppers gave it some really good flavors, even if they dominate a little. I felt like they gave this beer a little more of a smoky flavor, something I always feel the base beer is lacking. Pretty nice version of the beer overall."

"A nice variant, but the original is still better."
"Overall, a good combination from Stone. The flavors get along really nice and would definitely have it again."
"o - Overall a very good smoked porter, but not as good as the vanilla version. A bit too much heat from the peppers for me, but if you like beers with pepper and/or smoked porters it is definitely a good example of both."
""

"Man, I had higher hopes, not to set the bar too high. This ended up being really underwhelming."

"D - Very drinkable. The chili peppers is a nice addition and I like the bit of heat it gives the beer."

"Again, I like this a bit better than the base beer and on par with the vanilla bean. The chipotle adds an appreciated element to this beer and surprisingly, smooths it out a bit too."

"Nose of vanilla and smoked peat with rich chocolate and roasty characteristics. Taste is less smokey than tradition Smoked Porter. There are hints of smokiness with roasty, chocolatey notes and a thread of spice. The spice tastes like jalapenos, but a little mild and slightly smokey as well. I'm having this with a steak and it is awesome."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma has a lot of chocolate, as well as some earthiness and smokiness from the chipotle peppers. The flavor follows suit. I get some light heat from the peppers, as well as some chocolate and roasted malt. The heat lingers for a while after drinking but it doesn't overpower the other notes. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
"Smells like cardboard again. Hello oxidization! Peppers in the back, but man is it unpleasant. Taste follows suit: cardboard and more cardboard before chipotle peppers finish things off. Body is too thin and overcarbed again. Bad, bad, bad. Avoid!"
"Pours a deep amber to black in color with an off white head. In the aroma, a coffee like roast and a faint not of smoke and spice. In the taste, coffee malts and a small sweet smokiness, and ends with a spicy and earthy chipotle peppers. A spice like bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dryness in the aftertaste, and a chipotle spice on the lips. This porter seems to sweet for the spice, lacking in the nose, but a big burn on the lips."
""
"Damn - got much better with age, I assume it mellowed out, not a bit spiced beer fan.  Originally rated it 2.75, now I would say easily 3.5-3.75 range.  Mild spiciness, full bodied, minor chocolate notes."
"had the vanilla. love peppers, although not a huge fan of chipotles. vanilla and chipotle tasted the same. i got no 'heat', no pepper flavor or smell. the smell is BAND AIDS, just like the vanilla. does anyone know why? ever chewed on a band aid?- long story. or maybe just a sick one. but i dont find these beers pleasing. and it tastes like BAND AIDS, too. looked beautiful with the spotty lacing and rich dark color, but just doesnt do it for me."
"Much better than the vanilla version. The pepper really comes through but isn't overpowering. Great compliment to a steak. A good creaminess to it with a bit of roast as well. The mouthfeel is a little light but still a solid beer. Smell has pepper coming through. Appearance is dark brown with a cream tan head."
"Overall I have been searching this out for awhile and glad I did. The peppers are worked in wonderfully to give it a touch of heat while keeping the smoked porter up front. Well done and I can see why this is one of Greg's favorite beers."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, loved this. Don't like the BA classification. WIth the amount of chile bite in this, this is chile beer. And with a try."
""
"Poured into a tulip, off white colored foam, and its black. Held to the light there are milk chocolate colored edges. Aroma is...well smokey. Actually it smells just like chipotle peppers and smoke. Its nice but not complex. The flavor is similarly un-complex. Lots of chipotle pepper, smoke and earth. On the back end there is a hint of heat. Pretty rich mouthfeel, kinda lucious. In the end this is a pretty tasty beer, a great experement, a great beer experiment, just not a great beer."
""
"O: An interesting beer. I wouldn't sit down and drink six of these at one time, but it's worth a try. Drinkable."
"Overall, I have to say that Vanilla wins this competition by a landslide. But, with that said, this Chipotle version is really complex and pleasant. Love the aroma complexities and the lingering light heat and spice on the finish."
"This brew is pretty (spice wise) harmless, but still tasty. One of Stones better creations. I'm not a smokey brew fan, but this one is done quite well."
"Notes: I noticed on BA that there is a Stone Smoked Porter with Coconut. Now THAT I would be interested in!"
""
"Overall, glad I tried it but I wouldn't be picking up 6-packs of this, even if I could."
"O - I had this and the vanilla version on draft at a Stone event awhile ago, and remember liking this version quite a bit more. The bottled versions confirm that (though I enjoyed the bottled vanilla more than the draft version). I appreciated the subtle roasted pepper heat, and it worked very well with the base beer."
"Overall really enjoyable beer, rather dig this take and angle, would like to have this often actually."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a dark cola brown with a small tan head that has decent retention and leaves a good amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is fairly smoky with a bit of coffee, pepper, and a slight vegetal note as well as some light vanilla. The taste has a slight smokiness with coffee, some pepper, and light cocoa. Medium body. Low carbonation. This was much better than the vanilla version. The chipotle peppers seemed to add some more smokiness."
""
""
"O: Not bad, honestly I liked this better than the standard smoked porter. The regular smoked porter is overpoweringly smokey. The pepper and heat elements in this helps balance out all that smoke. Despite having said that, there really isn't much else to the beer. Very simple but also tasty and balanced with what flavors it does have."
""
"My first thought was that it was a heavily carbonated beer, then I realized that the tingle I was feeling was largely from the little bit of chili bite. Plays across the palate very well, and that little bite at the end with just a touch of heat is very well executed. Overall, I'd say this beer probably suffers from elevated expectations more than anything else. Worth checking out, but nothing mindblowing."
"Overall, this is a good attempt at mixing chiles and beer, but I would like the chiles to be a little more pronounced."
""
"My rating: B- (Worth a try, especially if you are new to spiced or smoked beers)"

"i dug it, it was tame IMO, but well executed."
"D - Very drinkable and tasty."
"Low B"
"M&D - an acquired taste that hits two targets in my taste spectrum, beer and spice. The tastes really are spliced perfectly. This beer would make awesome chili, or be perfect for many cooking applications"
"The chipotle peppers are very well integrated, while definitely noticeable they do not overwhelm the base beer. A bit pricey."
"Palate: Chocolate and smoked pepper up front, followed by peat smoke and charred malt. The peppers intensify the smoke flavor without adding much in the way of heat. There's a fair amount of pepper flavor, and it tickles the throat a bit, but I find myself wanting just a bit more heat. It's a tasty beer nonetheless, and the chipotle works well with the base beer. The finish is ashy, smoky, moderately bitter - very different than the vanilla bean version."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a 1 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted, toasted, and smoked malt along with some cocoa and very slight pepper aromas. Taste is of roasted and smoked malt, campfire, slight cocoa powder, and some mild chipotle pepper flavors. There is a mild smoke aftertaste and a fairly tame pepper heat in the back of the throat with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some solid aromas and flavors that show a nice integration of the chipotle peppers with the base beer. Much better than the vanilla bean version in my opinion."
"Overall, a really subdued and balanced chili porter. I expected a little more heat and less subtlely from Stone on this, but it definitely worked well. The peppers do well to highlight the smoke of the base beer and temper it with some spice and sweetness. I definitely prefer this over the base beer, but not as much as the vanilla. I would certainly try this again, especially since it was priced reasonably."
""

"Pours black with a solid quilt of tan foam and leaves nice billowed lace. Smell carries the smoke and chipotle peppers very, very well. Makes me want a mission style burrito from my local Neato Burrito with a healthy helping of pork. Taste is a quality merge of smoke, chipotle, porter and leather - a really tasty treat. Medium bodied with reserved carbonation and semi dry finish. Really nice beer. Certainly my fav of the two."

"Very drinkable and worth a try!"

"Well worth seeking out"
"O: everything I love. Smokey, spicy, and portery! Wonderful beer!"
"Pours a dark brown with a beige one and a half finger head. What a beautiful aroma, smoke and chipotle come through very clearly. This brew almost smells as though your nose is placed over a grill as chipotle peppers are roasting without the heat. Opens with pleasant smokiness jointed by accents of chipotle pepper, smoky,roasted malt with a touch of sweetness joins in and then the finish is smooth and silky. Just a bit of mild heat lingers on the tongue courtesy of the chipotle. Medium-bodied, with a slick, silky mouthfeel. This brew is a dream pairing with barbecue, and I can't wait to try it with grilled fajitas. Possibly one of the best American-brewed smoked beers available and a great example using an added ingredient to highlight aspects of the base beer. The added chipotle is incredibly successful in highlighting the base smoked porter. A marriage made in heaven, indeed!"
"Overall it was a good beer. I'm not a big pepper beer fan, but this was a good version."
""
""
""
""
"O - Hard to miss when you're starting from the Stone Smoked Porter, and the Chipotle Smoked Porter delivers. The heat cuts through the richness of the porter, and the chipotle blends seamlessly with the smoke."
"Overall - A nice change of pace for this brew but honestly, its a great beer but i prefer regular stone over this. The peppers kind of hide the smoke, cocoa, rich malty flavors. Im not saying it ruins it, or does work well but man, that is the main flavors i look for when i drink the porter. This is for sure worth a try, and one of the best peppered porters out there."
"O - I originally tried this beer on Sunday. I liked it so much that I brought one home. I think porters and stouts are the way to go with pepper beers. The big flavors are complimentary."
"O: $2.50 for a 12oz bottle is silly, but I had heard good things about this beer, and to its credit, it lives up to them. I'm happy I bought this."
"T: Unfortunately, the flavor isn't nearly up to par with the smell. A prickle of carbonation upfront followed by flavors of day old coffee, a touch of smoke and a bit of pepper heat on the finish. Leaves a dry and earthy peppery taste on the tongue, but not a ton of chipotle. Mouthfeel is a bit weak."
"O: I hate the way this beer smells, but it's a very good tasting beer. You can really taste the Chipotle peppers and it works quite well, imo (and I don't even like spicy food in general). Very unique."
"Hard to match the original, but this is definitely a nice variation. The chipotle is certainly a good pepper choice for this beer, and I'm glad they didn't skimp on the spice."

"Smooth mouthfeel, a bit hot on the back end if you're not used to spice but much more tame than I would have imagined stone going for, more chipotle!"
"12oz bottle $3.99 I'm not a huge fan of Stone Smoked Porter but I thought I'd give these a shot. Looks identical to the regular version, black, mocha colored head. Smells a little smoky and rubbery, odd. Flavor is a good mix between the smoke and the chipotle pepper. My only complaint is that there isn't any heat from the peppers."

"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch tan head that didn't stay around for very long. There's also a small amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, chipotle peppers, smoke/peat, and some coffee. Taste is similar to the aroma, the brew tastes like roasted/burnt malt, bittersweet chocolate, chipotle peppers, coffee, smoke/peat, and a bit of caramel. The heat from the peppers is noticeable but not strong, however with that being said it's still a tasty brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little creamy with moderate carbonation. I think this is a good overall beer, I liked it."
"Really like the chipotle flavor and feel going on here, a great level of spice."
"O: an interesting smoked porter, that is well balanced and has a slightly spicy pepper kick on the finish. All the flavors work well together here. Not a bad brew. Better then I expected."

"Pitch black body in my glass pours with a thicket of tan head forming nicely, fine even lacing left behind. I'm always excited for a new chipotle infused brew. This just happens to be in one of my standby favorites from Stone. The nose has those classic dark malt characteristics dark chocolate, roasted malts that hint at coffee, with a hidden layer of mild smoke. In addition in this one we get the earthy smoked jalapeno pepper character. The flavor rides on a current of dark chocolate like roasted malts and finishes on the dry classic powdered chipotle flavors found in the earthiness of roasted jalapeno peppers. I find it to be a dry excellent version of a classic stout, the bottle wants me to decide on Vanilla or Chipotle peppers I want both in bottles. Variety is the spice of life. Just enough heat in the back end this beer will probably cure a cold, not that it has medicinal qualities but the peppers are so well infused it's hard to pick them out individually. Classic smoked pepper beer with enough heat to let you know what your dealing with but doesn't ruin the palate with each sip. Awesome medium bodied smooth velvet like texture with an earthy dry finish , well carbonated no complaints in any department I will be drinking more of this awesome offering."
"12oz Bottle from Julioâ€™s Pours a solid dark brown with brilliant garnet highlights and a huge fluffy mocha head that persists forever. Smells of spicy pepper, caramel, chocolate, and smoke with little to no hop aroma. The aroma is heavy on the smoke. The taste is a nice mix of chocolate smoke caramel and a small bit of pepper that never gets too warm. The smoke and pepper mesh nicely together amidst a chocolate and caramel backdrop. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet creamy almost syrupy mouthfeel. I liked this one a lot better than the vanilla version. Nice beer!"

"Stone might have just started bottling this fine brew, cause I've never seen it in a bottle before. Pick it up and give it try if you can. Cheers!"
"Good, great even. I think this beer fits nicely into the Stone, sorta theme of aggressive beers. Wouldn't mind having this again in the future."

"D - Nice chili beer. I'd have this again, as it strikes a nice balance between smoke and chili."
"At the Haymarket Brewery you can buy 4oz samples of the guest beers on tap...that was awesome...first place that ever allowed that!!! The Stone Smoked Porter with Chipotle Peppers poured a dark brown with a tan head and laced throughout the drink. The smell included smoke, roasted malts, and pepper. The taste followed suite...started with plenty of smoke, malt, and earth...then the peppers take over and provide a zip of spiciness which cleans the pallet. The mouthfeel was medium body smooth finish....not much carbontation to note. Overall was a neat beer and a lot better than I was expecting. Definitely recommend this beer."
"O - Overall good beer, worth checking out. May not be for everybody, especially if you don't like smokey/spicy beers."
"O-very good beer that I would have time and time again"
"O - Well this is as about as drinkable as you can get for a beer with peppers in it a little spicy for me but its still a good beer that I'm glad I had the chance to drink worth getting a pint if you ever see it around"
"Stone Smoked Chipotle porter â€“ dark as night, good head. Smokey, chilli flavor smellâ€¦definitely roasted. Good salsa flavorings and bit to it. Not as much smoke, but it has some chipotle heat to it. Even body, good carbonationâ€¦worth checking out if you are into the chilli beers."
"D - This really sounds like a good idea, the dark character of porter and the moderate level of smoke in Stone's version should work perfectly with chipotle, but somehow it doesn't come together as well as I expected it would. The chili character is relatively subdued and it doesn't have a lot of impact on the base beer. It may increase the perception of smoke a bit, but aside from that it does very little until it shows up in the finish. Overall I would prefer the original version of this beer to any of the specialty aged versions that I have had so far."
"O: I love stone's creativity. I rated this for what it is, a smokey porter with the creative addition of chipotle. Not a beer to drink regularly but its the type of beer that you look for in your beer drinking travels to keep things interesting. Happy to get a chance to try this one."
"Overall - An interesting attempt to introduce something new to brewing, but I wasn't really buyin'"
"Drink- I didnt like it. Just way too different and spicy. Worthy effort!"
"Pours a very dark brown with a touch of off white head. Chipotle smoked beer, mmm. Sounds so good when it hits your lips. Um wait. Where is the smoked num num? There is nothing on the nose other than roast and a bit of chocolate. Well naturally it must be in the taste. Wrong! WTF? I chastised Stone before on the vanilla version tasting like cheap shit vanilla extract. I figured there would at least be something of that nature here. Hell no. I've been duped yet again. Fuck off Greg Koch and Stone. You make awful beer and you've fucked me over too many times."
"O-I really wanted to try this one when I saw it on the board at Kickbacks and at first, the juxtaposition of flavors seemed to have my palate a bit muddled. But with each sip, this one grew on me. I enjoyed this one. It wasn't outstanding, but it was a nice twist on an already good porter."
"Overall, this is an unimpressive porter. Weak, muted flavors. It's just not well-brewed. This is a strange failure for a brewery that I often give high scores to."
"Real interesting brew. Nice lacy mouthfeel. Light carbonation. Recommend trying, but not an all time favorite. I appreciate what they did here going out on a limb."
"As much as I am a fan of Stone Brewery there are a few brews that I just don't like. Previously, I have tried the smoked porter and have found it a bit on the heavy handed side, too much smoke, not enough roasted malt. All this changed tonight with the Chipotle Smoked Porter on cask. First, the smokiness was dialed back considerably. Appearance was what was you'd expected in a porter. Dark, opaque, the head retention was a bit lacking. Aroma was also in line with the style. Roasted malt and mild dried fruit. The flavor was spot on with a chocolate malt roast to start and complexity from the chipotle peppers giving it a slightly smokey, somewhat leathery quality. Particularly interesting was the mild back end burn. Medium body and very soft mouthfeel. A nice twist on a porter."
"From the other reviews I didn't see many people describing the intensity I tasted so it's possible it was just an off cask."
"drinkability: great beer, but I reaslly want all the way around"
"Mouthfee/Overall: This beer is between light and medium bodied, with fairly fine carbonation. Reasonably smooth drinking. Overall, the chipotle adds something positive, for sure. I like it, and I'm not even a huge smoked beer/rauchbier fan."
"O: Wish it was a little spicier, but the spice lingers in an awesome way. It kind of sneaks up on you. Sweet bitterness, smoky, spicy. Awesome!"
"Probably my favorite out of Stone's smoked porters. This is a very earthy brew and the flavors work real well with each other. The smoke isn't the strongest but again, the flavors work well."
"O - So glad a get a growler of this. Very interesting ans well done porter."
"Finish: Burnt roosted dark malt with a little hot spice or heat in the throat"
"I really liked this beer. The chipotle is there, but it does not add any heat. It is to enhance the overall smoke and add some depth to it. A really nice and enjoyable beer."
"Taste, thick, good spice kick, but not so much that it blows all other flavor components out of the water. Mouthfeel stays chewy, you get the hoppiness of a Stone porter enhanced by the spice of the peppers. Then the chewy goodness extinguishes the heat and this interplay continues all the way through. Tough to find, but not all that pricey. Drank at Blue Palms back in January 2011 after the RS party."
"D: So glad to have been able to try this. Texas Ranger, when fresh, has an edge on this but this is in no way a slouch!"
"Drinkability -- I feel like I eated the purple berries. Had I not been prepared with a glass of water this would have been difficult to get through. There is a slow and forceful burn in this beer, but it's good! Challenging, yes, but the smokey base beer is really accentuated and elevated by the chipotle pepper addition. I'm thrilled that I got a chance to try this versiou, but I don't seem myself having this on a regular basis. Or possibly ever again."
"D: Overall the spiciness of the peppers makes you sit back and sip on this one, it is something that I enjoyed as my first cask experience. very interesting brew will leave me with some good memories. not something I could drink everyday."
"D-this has an interesting array of flavors that to me don't taste good togther. they stand alone and lack integration. the finish is rather harsh and makes it hard to drink."
"D: Not always a big chile or smoked beer fan, but Stone has done well with this one. Not overbearing in any fashion, and actually pretty enjoyable."
"The beer was paired with some grilled cheese tomato soup and a traditional reuben."
"I expected this beer to be kinda awful because I couldn't imagine a beer brewed with chipotle peppers to be good, but it was."
"A little surprised to see this guy pop up 'round here. It pours a deep, dark ruby-tinted sienna topped by over a finger of dirty ecru foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, chocolate, hot peppers, and molasses. The taste holds notes of roasted malts, molasses, light cocoa powder, oaky smoke, and a light pepper heat. The heat and smoke compliment the darkness nicely. The body is a hefty medium, with a moderate carbonation and a pretty dry finish. Overall, a real treat, a pepper-ed beer that neither overdoes it nor underdoes it. Nice."
"Na zdrowie"
"The mouthfeel is not too creamy, but features a nice medium body. The carb could be turned down a touch, and that would make this beer into more of a meal. This is pretty drinkable for a smoked beer and even more drinkable for a pepper beer. But, for an American porter, it's not up there with the cream of the crop. Still, I'm glad to have had the chance and I did enjoy more than one pour!"
"I didn't find the pepper overpowering, as it could have been, however, I don't think I'd ever go for seconds. This was a truly unique beer and one I'd be happy to see on shelves around me."
"This offering is medium to light bodied with a modest level of carbonation. The peppery aspect of this brew is too potent for me. A burning heat sensation is left inside the mouth which is excessive and hurts the drinkability. It is a strange hate love feeling I get. I like the way it tastes but hate the way it burns. The burning feeling forces you in for another sip which calms the sensation for a bit before it intensifies in heat. Keep the same flavor but bring down the level of heat from the chipotle. I dont know if that is even possible, but that is exactly what this brew needs in order to be amazing."
"Had at the Stone Tap Takeover in Charlotte. Served from tap into a tumbler. Poured dark dark brown with a minimal off-white head. There was no lacing evident throughout. The aroma was comprised of smoked malt, spices, and subtle malt. The flavor was of smoked malt and chipotle that actually builds heat as it sits on your palate and after. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a very nice change to the regular Smoked Porter offered by Stone. I really enjoyed the flavor combination of smokey and spicy. I wouldn't drink this spicy food however as the heat does tend to get a little much if you allow it to sit for too long."
"Drinkability: With the standard Smoked Porter and the Vanilla Bean version, I really must dare myself to try and stop chugging them down. With this one, well, one was more than enough."
"A decent beer but a pretty boring show of chipotle."
"The spicy nature of this beer works because of the contrast with the sweetness of the base beer, and the way it seems to mesh so well with the smokiness... I really enjoyed this beer"
"Pours near black with almost.no head or lacing. Nose brings forward a pretty good amount of chipotle alongside some roasted malt and hints of coffee. Smoke in the background. Taste brings the peppers forward while the smoke and roast characteristics remain in the background. Good feel--I like he heat on this. Drinkability is okay given the distinctiveness of some of the flavors."
"The chipotle sneaks up on you in the this beer. Its definitely not a chili forward beer at all. Its just a really nice background of the chipotle and then it drops off and gives way to the roast / smoke of the base beer. A very good use of chilis in a beer."
"The pepper is kicked down a notch in the flavor, and the smoke is kicked up a bit. I liked the balance it had in the aroma a bit more than the flavor, but it is still delicious. Nice medium to full bodied mouthfeel, with a bit of prickly carbonation."
"(26)"
"Pleasantly dry finish to a porter that has the right carbonation. I couldn't keep going with many of these, but certainly I could take down more than I could with the Smoked Porter."
"Picked up a growler of this and almost immediately felt the need to bust it open. Pours a beautiful black with with a little dark brown head that fades. Smelled of chocolate, chipotle, and barley. I thought it had an incredible taste a near perfect balance of ingredients with enough of a kick from the peppers to keep the taste-buds happy. It's def not the thickest porter but still has a good medium body to it. Ultimately I would put this on par with bootlegger's Black Phoenix, which was also exceptional."
"Stone has always been one of the breweries that I've respected. This beer might have thrown them to the top of my list. I am proud to say that I was fortunate enough to drink this beer. Great job Stone! You really hit the ball out of the park with this one!"
"Was a bit let down by this one. Out of draft that chipotle is super present and is what makes this beer fun to have. The cask, or at least the cask I had killed the chipotle flavor almost all together."
"D: drank amazingly good for a spicy smoked porter. It is the best spicey smoked beer I've had so far. I will seek this beer out every time they brew it. I know it pretty limited and brewed once a year I think. I hope they bottle it one day."
"Taste/Mouthfeel: Taste has all the makings of dark roasted malt/caramel giving way to those chipotle peppers. Being a salsa guy here in the desert southwest, love that spicy tinge at the back of my throat. Even though I liked the taste and feel, I don't see myself having this special brew often."
"D - I think I've made my point."
"The heat build-up could certainly be a bit too much for some people, I'd think. I like it, though. I'd love for Stone to put out something like this on a semi-regular basis. Very good."
"Drinkability- Nice beer that I enjoyed quite a bit. Like I said earlier I love Chili brews but I have to sort of have the right mindset. This was perfect in this opening night situation. Not a hell of a lot different than the regular Smoked Porter but a treat none-the-less. Thanks much Mike!"
"Though a challenge to drink, I appreciate the experimental nature of the beer. Unfortunately it's one and done for me."
"Had this at Pazzo's in Lexington. Pours a dark brown/black color with an off-white head that hangs around for quite a while. The aroma doesn't have a lot of the spicy chipotle in it, it's mostly roasted and chocolate malt with a touch of smokiness. Smells good. The chipotle comes through big time in the flavor. It's quite spicy in the back of the throat and on the tongue. The background has a nice roast and chocolate malt character and there is a moderate amount of smokiness to it as well. But the chipotles take the main stage and give off quite a bit of heat. I got a pint of this and wished I had the opportunity to have a half-pint. The body is fairly thick, but I had some trouble with the drinkability due to the heat."
"D - I was a little skeptical initially, but this one really won me over. The peppers provide zest, spice, and some heat, but its not overpowering. Even so, I'm not sure if I would make this a session brew. Another interesting beer from such an imaginative brewery."
"medium to light body, some overall smoothness with astringency in the finish, plus light phenols and a moderate carbonation that was tingly upfront."
"I am really happy I had a chance to try such a rare treat from Stone. Steve Wagner was at the dinner and said that every batch is different since they use peppers from their garden and we definitely got a hotter batch. I am glad we did :)"
"Opaque as the standard smoked porter made by Stone, good lacing was left on the glass as the beer was consumed. Semi-sweet chocolate aroma, a pinch of peppers. The flavor has two stages to it. The first part is sweet like chocolate and molasses, the second part is created when the chipotle peppers kick in to add a zesty kick of sizzle. A unique creation by Stone, matched well with the BBQ Fondue I had."
"I am not even going to break this one down, as I had this on cask and even the bartender said that something had gone crazy (not necessarily in a good way) with this particular one. It was over carbonated and had an insane amount of pepper in it. After a couple of sips and finally a good gulp, the back of my throuat was sizzling like the urban legend of the kid who ate pop rocks and coke. They vouched that a previous keg was not so peppery, but I don't think that I would care for this combination any ways. I had the brandy barrel aged version of ths smoked porter and that sweetness with the smoke is a much more logical combination to me."
"D- A very interesting beer. I think this thing would go great with spicy food, especially for someone that likes the heat. Not exactly a session beer unless you enjoy peppers. I found it very interesting."
"Overall this porter goes down really smooth. The chipotle moderates things very well, greatly contributing to its balance and drinkability."
"Flavor was roasty and smoky with just a mild heat on the back of the tongue and throat. Quite tasty and very easy to drink."
"I tried this on Cask and it poured a lovely medium brown. There were no significant smells to distinguish. I honestly couldn't find any chipotle flavor beyond the general smokieness of the beer, but hey, it is a Smoked Porter!. Nonetheless I found the beer quite smooth and refreshing with superior mouthfeel and drinkability."
"Not particularly drinkable as the hotness persists a bit much, but very interesting."
"Drinkability: Needs to be sipped if for no other reason because of the heat factor, but otherwise ""yummy."" Very drinkable."
"D: My first beer ever on cask, and I really enjoyed it. Served at about 55-60 degrees, I'm estimating, the temperature really brought out the flavours of the beer. A very interesting beer, I think it's even better than the original Stone Smoked Porter, a nice addition to the Stone lineup."
"Stay away by all means"
"Stone, the next time you make this you need to put in a lot more chipotlÃ© peppers, this could work really well if properly spiced. I have added Â½ a dried chipotlÃ© at bottling time to each 22oz bottle of smoked porter and that is definitely way too much, but something like a ratio of 1/16th to 1/8th of a chipotle per 22oz bottle would probably be nicely spicy. In the end, I did notice, if you drink a lot more other beers, you can finally taste the chipotle flavors and not unconsciously think that you got ripped off by the Stone guys ;-)"
"d - definately not going to be the next thing i go out and try to get a hold of, but if you live in san diego it's definately worth a try."
"better? i dont think so."
"Recommended, but not quite as good as I was hoping."
"D- I think it is good just in proportion. I think a 1L growler of this is the most I would be able to drink."
"D: Go big or go home and Stone knows this. I would like to see this beer with four times the chipotle presence it has now. This beer was good but I wanted to go toe to toe with a Stone Chipotle beer. The chipotle was too light and was completely lost within the sausages I had for dinner."
