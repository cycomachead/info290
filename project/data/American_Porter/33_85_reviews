"Great dark beer. You can taste the coffee"
""
""
"Overall. I like best heartier richer malts, but as a lighter milder porter this is really tasty."
""
""
"O: A bit of a let down for the style. Checked bottle and is almost ten months old, should have checked at the store. I am told that coffee is much more prevalent fresh."

"o: An excellent coffee porter, highly drinkable and flavorful.  Warms well too."
" overall it's my second favorite coffee beer behind coffee bender.  I'll buy this again"

"Love this!   Drink and be merry. Sláinte!!!"
"If you love beer and coffee, look no further. Excellent offering."
""

"A very drinkable coffee porter, but I've had much better."
"Overall, it's exceptional. If you love coffee, you will love the coffeehouse porter from BBC!!!"
"Not much to add in summary, other than that this brew is good and an absolute bargain at around $4 a bomber."
""
"Had it on nitro, very smooth and delicious."

"Pours a dark brown with a coffee colored head. The scent is pure espresso with some sweet creamy scents coming through. The taste is all about the coffee with very heavy bitter flavors of espresso and sweet cream coming through on the end. Very delicious."
""
""
""
"O- Overall this a pretty decent porter.  Not much complexity to it and can come across as a hair thin."
""
""
""
""
"Have had it in bombers and draft, draft seemed to be more consistent because this beer often sits in shops fridge's for a while."
""
""
""
"O - Definitely one of the better coffee porters I've had, and an excellent representation of the style (which, if you've tried anything else Berkshire makes, shouldn't come as any surprise.)  Something I will recommend and pick up again."

"Overall: A really great beer that I would highly recommend. A easy drinking coffee flavored beer that doesn't beat you over the head with anything. Outstanding. 4/5"

"O - Full disclosure: this beer has two things working against it. This is my second beer of the evening. The first was a Peruvian Morning with huge coffee smell and taste. This beer lacks compared but still has its own merits. Second, this bottle was purchased in Massachusetts about ten months ago. I may have held on to it for too long. It is decent but not as good as the score indicates. i will revisit given the opportunity for a fresher bottle and a cleaner palate."

"Overall this beer is really drinkable but nothing extraordinary as it seems pretty two-dimentional. I do really like the beer though. For being so simple it tastes pretty good. I wonder if this is an older bottle as it may have be better fresh as we all know lots of flavor fade with time especially coffee. I still am glad to try this but it isn't anything I would seek out again."

"O: You wanted a coffee porter? You got a coffee porter. I plan on bringing a few of these bad boys back with me to NY and then to NC to enjoy with a few of my friends."
""
"O = This is a favorite that I hope to revisit over and over again. Would it be wrong to pour this in a coffee cup in the morning and enjoy it at 7 a.m.?!? As far as food pairings, I'm not quite sure what would stand up to its richness, but maybe a slice of pecan pie or a sweet/spicy barbeque sauce on top of baby back ribs?"
""
"O - good stuff. Recommended for porter heads."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, surprisingly good."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I liked this a lot and will keep it ""in stock"" when I can find it. What I enjoyed is the coffee flavor not dominating - well-balanced, very smooth flavor profile, tasty warm or on the cool side. Nice beverage."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was excellent and i will readily have this beer again."
""
""
"Highly recommended for fans of thick, chewy, dark ales. This porter packs a huge dose of flavors to tickle your taste buds, all wrapped together in a silky body that really is a sensuous delight."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep black with a small tan head that fades quickly. Smell is coffee, roasted malts with a hint of chocolate. Taste is coffee and the roasted malts with a touch of bitterness, not overpowering or heavy. Lighter mouthfeel with average carbonation for the style. Very clean and smooth. Overall a very good porter that I would buy often if I had access to it."

"M: surprisingly thin considering the robustness of the nose"
"O: I am a big fan of this beer on-nitro - it does not appear to suffer the thinness of the body that others observed when being poured on nitro (it was just downright creamy). Lovely flavors of coffee come through but are not overpowering (even had a buddy that does not really like coffee agree that this one was great)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"You definitely need to know before you drink this beer that it tastes a lot like coffee. Coffee is the first thing you will taste, a little dry and bitter: that being said, is that why you bought the Coffeehouse Porter in the first place? Lol. Other than that when it pours you get a tan head and its got a great porter/coffee smell. Unfortunately I was drinking it at a colder temperature than I would have liked and I was also STUFFED when I drank it but I will definitely go back for another bottle of this"

"Food Pairings: flourless chocolate cake with some kind of vanilla bourbon cream. really thick hearty stew made with a porter preferably. Fondue."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: My quintessential coffee beer, the coffee is the star of show. Its an awesome brew, especially on draft, highly reccomended and something every MA resident should try once."
""
""
""
"O: This is pretty good, although a bit more sweetness might help balance out the dry coffee flavors."
""
""
""
""
"O - tasty beverage. I got this as an extra in a trade, but if it were available locally, I would graba couple regularly. If you want a beer that's almost more coffee than beer, this is a tasty choice."
"O: A nice, roasty porter with plenty of coffee flavor. Fairly straight-forward which is a good thing in coffee beers. Very good price point at $3.99 a bomber, as well. Recommended for the coffee beer lovers out there"
""
""
""

"Overall: Good but not the best coffee flavored beer i've had. It did go well with the pancakes i had for supper."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a pretty good brew. I'd definitely prefer Founders Porter to this one, as founders has more than just a coffee flavor. With that being said, I do like this and I may pick up a bottle in the future. 4.49 for a bomber isn't such a bad price nowadays. Berkshire Brewing has a winner on their hands with this one."
""
""
"O: Straight up coffee porter without the tendencies of others...no smoke or burnt notes really, lighter roast character. I prefer a 'darker' tasting coffee porter but this was decent stuff."
""
""
""
"O: Overall, it's a fantastic beer for a cold night. It is pretty much exactly what it sets out to be which is, after all, a coffeehouse porter. Super-drinkable and a great after dinner type of drink (In lieu of coffee)"
""
""
""
"Overall-- a very satisfying porter. I'll be seeking this one again."
""
"There is almost nothing objectionable about this beer. The body could use a slight amount more oomph. This is a touch too ""watery."""
""
""
""
""
""

"The beer pours a deep black brown with a nice finger-width sand-dune-tan head that fizzles slowly away to leaving light clouds and strings of lacing on the glass. The body is too dark to tell if it’s hazy or not, and it also perfectly masks carbonation bubbles, making it a lovely thing to look at. The beer smells in the medium range of potency with nice roasted coffee sitting somewhere in the French roast range. Malts are obviously also present, tending to nice roasted notes that confuse themselves with the coffee aroma, just as they should. Slight caramel and toffee notes are also present and faint leanings towards burnt bread. The beer tastes wonderfully rich with coffee flavors and astringency. The taste opens as slight sweet caramel and then blossoms into roasted heaven with heavy coffee and roasted malt notes. The bitters come nicely off the close of the taste and linger in waves in the mouth. Mouthfeel has just a whisper of effervescence but is velvety and chewy on the tongue with a perfect body to it. Overall this beer is a terrific example of a coffee porter, and is very drinkable and pleasant. The folks at Berkshire know how to do malts, and they do them well. It doesn't really pair well with smoked gouda; though it does bring out more of the smoke in the cheese it cuts right through the coffee taste of the beer. Try this beer, though, it is a tasty malty treat that will go well with a warm fire place or a cool crisp fall day."

"o: nice! very good beer from an unheard of brewery (at least for me)."
""
"O: I wouldn't say this is a session beer with it being over 5% abv but this was a great beer i could imagine myself drinking this after a good maybe pairing it with deserf I would have this beer again and recommend it"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very tasty brew and my first from BBC. Looking forward to trying more of thier beers in the future."
""
""
"O: This is a very tasty beer and very well priced. Definitely pick this one up if you get the chance."
""
"O: Just average and nothing special. I think it might be a bit too old and I'm missing the coffee. Might try it again."
""
""
""
""
"O- the ba'ers on the site are right. This is a cup of Joe that doesn't let down. I live the coffee grind/dry combination that makes this brew stay true to a black coffee flavor. I need to do a dance off of coffee beers"
""
""
""
""
"This is a smoothe beer, but disappointingly thin and one dimensional. There are some very appealing tastes here, but overall it falls somewhat short. Check it out if you love coffee/espresso, but I don't think it's as good as it is made out to be."

"O - Fantastic"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a decent coffee porter, better than most."
""
"Nothing horrible with this, just kind of run of the mill. I like my coffee stouts to have more coffee and the thin mouthfeel also detracts a bit, but all in all it's still an enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, while the initial aromas were very promising, the actual flavors didn't quite live up to promise. The coffee and ash flavors did remain potent during the transition, but much was lost in the sugars, and the grapefruit-y hops didn't mesh well with the coffee. The beer is by no means unpalatable, but could use a bit of tweaking to emphasize the proper flavors."

"@ The Gaff in Waltham. Pours to a thick creamy permanent head and ample lacing. Aroma is coffee, malty, more coffee, creamer... Flavor is coffee, malts, and a tinge of hops. Mouthfeel is medium-full and very much stoutlike. Overall, a very good coffee porter. Good choice."
"O: Great simple coffee porter. Coffee isn't overpowering but of course it's still quite strong. Mouthfeel is off the chart, super creamy and smooth. Goes down easily."
""
"Quite nice."
""
""

"Coffee porters and stouts are one of my favorite subcategories of beer. This one is a really solid contender for me. I liked this beer on all counts. Another winner from Berkshire that’s local, affordable, and tasty."
""
"Overall, one of the most well balanced, flavorful, and smoothest coffee brews I ever tasted. This is a fantastic brew!!"
"O - Probably my favorite local beer, made even better by the nitrogen tap. Really well balanced and fresh tasting coffee porter at an awesome value. 22 oz bombers sell for under $4."
""
""
""
""
"This beer may become one of my on-tap favorites."
""
"D: Certainly not amazing, but very, very solid. Coffee isn’t as big as I would have liked, and it is also less robust than I anticipated. Preconceptions aside, this is very okay & drinkable porter with a nice bonus addition."
""
"O: A delicious porter that I would most certainly buy again."
""
""
""
"O- The flavors are good, maybe not as coffee-forward as it could be. I also don't get the lingering that I want out of a beer like this. I miss it too quickly."

"Nitro tap served in a tumbler pint, the beer is jet black, with a creamy, dense, thick, biege colored head that looks solid and delicious. Cream and coffee aromas, with a hint of bitter dark chocolate that blends everything together very well. The beer has a good roasting to the palate, with a heavy coffee character, slight mocha highlights, and a very subtle hopping that cleans up the end of the brew. Very smooth body from the nitro, with a light overall feel. Clean on the glass, as well, and very easy to drink. Slightly bitter aftertaste, but very mild, and the beer has a smooth, creamy, and easy finish. Decent brew that is ridiculously easy to drink."
""
"This is currently my favorite beer. Every time I go to the Horseshoe Pub, I am tempted to ignore the other 79 offering and just order this flawless beer. Bold, rich flavor. No bitter aftertaste. Nice roasted notes, without being overpowering. And yes, I like the fact that it will kick you in the butt if you drink it too fast on an empty stomach."
"Such a fantastic beer. It may be due to the nitro-tap, but I gotta give this beer a perfect ""5". Everything the style should be."
""
""
""
"Overall - Just a middle of the road porter for me, at 4 bucks for 22oz though i can't complain, definitely worth it if you ask me, but far from world class."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A really solid, well-balanced coffee porter - perhaps the best coffee porter I've had. Has a mellow coffee flavor that complements the rest of the beer quite well, without taking over. It's like adding coffee to a smooth, mellow porter. Impressive."
"I'd drink it again, but I think this beer has a bit of an identity crisis - the base porter is neither a rich and roasty robust porter, nor is it on the sweeter, more caramel-heavy end of the spectrum. And while I think it has some flaws, part of me wonders how much of that is due to the base recipe not particularly aging well in this day of double coffee this and triple imperial that."
"This is a solid porter. I don't get a lot of coffee flavored ones so this is a nice change of pace."
""

"Poured into my Duvel 20 oz giant tulip. Poured this almost pitch black beer aggressively into the glass and got huge dark tan four inch head, that hung on around 5 minutes, then settled into a bubbly film, lots of webby lacing. Smell is roasted coffee, dark malts, little whiff of raisins, and some dark chocolate. Taste is mainly the roasted coffee, kind of one dimensional in a pleasant way. Body is thinner than expected, with plenty of carbonation, on the dry side, and very easy drinking. This is a nice tasting porter."
""
"Actually didn't like this as much as other Berksire's I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

""
""
"Still, this may be the perfect coffee beer."
"O: Great porter. I think it could have benefited from a bit more alcohol to round out the flavor and add more of the warmth I tend to expect from porters, but still a well done beer."
"(D)- Not bad, but i feel this definitely has some off flavors."
"(O) It's good, but it's got a weird smell and flavor (amongst all of the notable and good flavors) that I can't figure out. Almost like a bit of funk in there. It's weird, but a pretty good brew."
"This is a very solid beer. I am really glad I had the chance to try it...after all, it has been on my wants list for some time. Well worth the wait!"
"Taste like Chocolate Coffee Chocolate. A nice brownish head. Smells like Chocolate Coffee Chocolate. Enough said."
"O - Like Jim Carrey, I've had better, but I'm not going to complain about the money spent on this one. I don't know if I get the A- average that this beer seems to get from the rest of the community, but maybe we can chalk this up to a bottle that's slightly off. I also bought a bottle of their RIS and I'm looking forward to cracking that soon."
"O - Not bad, decent flavor for a coffee porter. Got through it easily enough."
"O: Outstanding porter. Maybe a bit better on tap, glad I finnally reviewed my favorite porter."
"Cheers!"
"O: a great porter, definitely one to have again. Berkshire really hit the marks in term of flavors with the malts, hops and the coffee."
"Overall -- This one has some sentimental value to me, being the first beer I drank at my first Dark Lord Day (out of a spent McDonald's cup - O how naive!) Really quite nice. One of the better year-round American Porters, and the coffee flavor is added quite nicely. If you like coffee-infused beers, this is a must try. The end."
"Moderately heavy body (7/10) & well carbonated. Crisp bite with the carbonation makes it an easier heavier brew."
"O: Excellent, robust, flavorful porter whose taste profile is exactly as advertised. Best berkshire brew yet. Will definitely buy again."
"I was disappointed with the mouthfeel at first until I remembered I was drinking a porter, not a stout. The taste is similar to other coffee stouts I've had. So the body here is very nice. The label says ""rich"" and if by that they mean ""silky smooth"" then yeah, spot on. I usually define it as ""full-bodied"" so this is a bit less than that. Again, it's not a stout so no issue here."
"O - I did not have high hopes for this beer, but this porter gave me a awesome experiance that I may just drive the 2 hours to get again. My only regret is having a small fridge to not stock more."
"Chewy full body with a blast of deep toasted coffee flavor that lingers over the roasted dark malt notes into a slightly acrid dry finish. Although the beer is pretty roasty with a ton of coffee flavor, it is never overwhelming or one dimensional. Again, there is a subtle lactic cream presence that smooths things out and provides fullness to the plate. There's also dome bittersweet dark chocolate as well as some oatmeal, caramel and hazelnut flavor. Toward the finish it becomes more bitter and acrid but overall it's nicely balanced and easy to drink."
"Smells a bit like cups of fresh coffee and cocoa side by side with a healthy dose of roasted malt. Taste is more of the same, plus hints of bittersweet chocolate and tart cherry. Lengthy dry roasted finish. Great balance of aromas and flavors. This is perhaps the best coffee beer I've tried."
"Very good coffee stout. Excellent cold on a hot summer day. Will have more."
"Straight forward coffee porter - quite tasty, but unexceptional compared to its peers."
"O - Solid local offering. I think this is the best of the Berkshire line-up that I have had."
"Drinkability: Surprisngly refreshing. The addition of coffee flavoring makes this suitable as a dessert beer."
"O - This is a diamond in the rough. Very near to a cold cup of freshly roasted coffee with a shot of chocolate."
"Very good mouthfeel. Thick and substantial."
"overall this a great local brew; very flavorful. wouldn't put it up there with the best of the best, but definitely worth a try."
"(22oz bottle). Pours dark brown with a large tan head that quickly fades. Aroma of chocolate (tootsie roll), coffee, and some caramel. Taste is roasty bitter with a sweet malt backbone. Thin to medium bodied with an oily texture. Finish is roasty bitter. Decent beer that is very easy to drink"
"O: a very good coffee porter."
"The feel of this brew is at times watery but it is modestly carbonated and for the most part medium bodied. The alcohol is just at the right level where a bomber is finished and is not a chore to do so. The outstanding factor of this brew is most definitely the smell, if only the taste was as good as the smell. I think a little tweaking of the recipe is needed and this would be a great brew. As is, it is a solid brew that I would enjoy again for less than $5 a bomber. Are there better coffee porters out there? Yeah, but in this price range probably not."
"An awesome beer. I wish I could get this in the south!"
"In general the freshness of all the BBC brews are a huge advantage to other beers that have to travel through huge distribution systems. A fresh smooth thick remainder of lace from a imperial pint glass."
"O: For a coffee porter, I'm not sure there is much better. The nose reminded me instantly of Damnation II. I'm a huge coffee fan and I find too many coffee/beer is completely lacking flavor and often over-roasted. This had a great medium-roasted, lightly bitter, earthy taste that I love in coffee. I think the perfect balance of hops, sweetness, and slight dark fruit finish make this a memorable porter. For $3.99 and somewhat local, it's something I'll definitely be buying again."
"Great price for the 22oz bottle, less than $5. Definitely pick this one up again."
"D: A solid coffee porter. Certainly can't beat the price (about $4/bomber). I usually pick one up every time I'm in the MA/CT area"
"Cheers!"
"22oz bomber purchased at McKinnon's in Salem, split with BA CheckMate. Pours a dark brown to black body with a thinish film of light tan head. Aroma says chocolate covered espresso beans. Coffee is immediately noticeable, with some toastiness and dark chocolate notes. Medium bodied with full carbonation. A bit of a sipper, though one sip definitely invites another. Solid - much better than their other porter."
"D - this is a very good coffee porter. Loads of the Deans Beans dominated the flavor, but it was delicious - almost like drinking an iced coffee. If I lived around Deerfield, I would make this a frequent purchase. Good stuff!"
"Overall a wonderfully tasting Porter. All of the components in this brew worked together very well giving you an extremely well balanced beer. A great representation of the style."
"Drinkability - I really enjoyed this Coffeehouse porter -well blended and balanced with just enough bitterness from the coffee,I would definitely have this again."
"Notes: A very solid beer, and one of BBC's best offerings. It can occasionally be found on nitro tap at some of the local bars, and holds the distinction of being one of the only beers I truly enjoy in this format. The fresher you get it, the stronger the coffee taste seems to be."
"D - This beer is very drinkable...less than 4$ a bomber. I couldn't drink too many coffee flavored beers at once, but if this is your style...I'd highly recommend it."
"Excellent, almost along the lines of Pisgah Valdez."
"A well built easy to drink coffee porter and a definite recommendation. Another solid brew from Berkshire. Haven't had a bad offering from them yet."
"This is a very good coffee porter."
"D - Light enough tasting to drink a few, but taste may motivate me not to."
"Overall, a nice coffee porter, but nothing completely memorable or outstanding. The coffee is definitely the dominant flavor. Not something I would seek out, but pretty nice either way."
"Pours with some frothy dark tan head. Deep brown cloudy body. Smells of sweet carmel, roasty coffee, some roasted malts, a touch of burnt malts. Tastes sweet at first, then carmel, some black coffee and a slight bitterness on the finish. Medium carbing, medium full bodied. I try this again later this year to see if this changes again."
"(85)"
"D- Just... decent. Nothing amazing, nothing special. Drinks like what you'd expect from a run of the mill beer. Pretty disappointing leading me to believe this is the third old bottle from a certain package. Can't tell for sure, but if this is the standard coffee flavor and aroma I won't be searching it again."
"Drinks smooth and quicker than most porters but nothing really to worry about with an ABV just over 6%."
"Overall, a nice coffee porter. Lots of solid flavors and not overly roasted. I dig this one. Pretty drinkable."
"It didn't have quite the coffee profile I had expected. The bottle was best by 6/11/2011, so I don't think it was a freshness thing. Coffeehouse Porter was a tasty brew that I'll definitely drink again and my dad said it was ""really good"" too."
"It's a very good porter. A nice combination of coffee and the robustness of a porter. Easy to find, and easy on the wallet. Another good beer by BBC."
"WoW. Just an outsatnding Porter. Dark black with a thin Mocha head. Aroma of sweet coffee and toffee. Taste is spot on. Sweet coffee and mocha, but not in an sicky sweet way. Flavor fades to a slight bittness that enables one to sip again. This is a great after dinner beer or just a nice casual sipper. I am really impressed with the overall balance between the coffee flavors and the drinkibility. A great brew."
"This beer seems to perk me up slightly as I sip it. The feel of this beer is pretty creamy but smooth and seems to slide down with little effort. Some interesting flavors come out in the aftertaste but does not linger long."
"D-Drinkable. This one has grown on me since the start of the drinking process. Great deal at $4 a bomber. Oh so much coffee. Delicious and one of the best deals around. Love it."
"D- This was one hell of a porter. I personally thought it was fantastic tasting and I would love to get my hands on this in the state...Berkshire Brewing are you listening?? I want you in the state of Indiana. The ABV was well hidden till the end but still didn't come out strong which was nice."
"D: Good."
"D- I could drink this beer all night, and never want for anything else"
"22oz bomber. No Freshness Date. Pours a deep, deep dark brown. Thin head. Fantastic aroma. Great rich smell of coffee beans. A bit of malts and chocolate in the background, but this beer basically has a huge coffee aroma. Big taste of coffee. Sweet with a slight espresso/cappuccino flavor. One of the best offerings from a really solid brewery. At $3.99 this Porter is a beer you must have on hand as much as possible."
"A huge start that had me so excited, then a let down. Still a solid beer worth trying but it could have been so much more."
"This is an all around good beer with plenty to offer the senses, great balance and easy to drink."
"Overall this is a great brew - especially with the nitro tap at Sunset. Don't be put off by the ""coffee"" - this is the way a porter should be; a little sweet, a little chocolate, a lot of dark, malty goodness."
"Overall: wonderful."
"Pours dark brown with a soapy head. Dissipates fairly quickly. Smells heavily of coffee and brown malts. Tastes similar, but with enough carbonation to keep the body light. No alcohol detectable, but enough to get a slight buzz after the bomber. I enjoyed this beer, and would serve it slightly below room temperature next time. I like a thicker body on my dark beers; chilled and carbonated I'm not a big fan of."
"Poured into a New Belgium glass black with a two finger off white head. Minimal lacing and retention. I can't get anything from my nose being allergy season. The taste is of slight dark chocolate and a dark carmel flavor. The coffee comes out in the aftertaste and causes a good amount of dryness. It does feel a little thin in body. But that doesn't take much away from the drinkability."
"Drinkability - Incredibly drinkable. Goes down so smooth and feels fluffy and weightless. I want another."
"D - very drinkable beer, perfect for the fall/winter months. Nice one to start or end the day with."
"D - Really nice coffee porter from within the commonwealth. Always good to support local brewers and its made all the easier when they put out a really good product. This is a classic BBC offering."
"This was smelling great, drinking good and going down easy."
"Bottle, pours a dark brown with burgundy edges and a creamy tan head. Nose is some fresh coffee beans, cream, a bit of roasted malt. Flavor is roasted malts, just a really nice, smooth coffee bean presence, maybe a touch of vanilla. Moderate carbonation, fairly thin, but comes across as creamy from the head. Extremely easy to drink. Berkshire rules."
"Drinkability: Smooth, easily drinkable, and enjoyable. As a longtime fan of both beer and coffee, I enjoyed this one. Thanks to monsterzero for the opportunity to finally try BBC's CP."
"Beer is medium to light in body, lighter than expected, and has a mild sweetness on the front end. Its nice and drinks easy. The coffee flavors are OK, not great. Its a little bitter from malts, overall its an OK porter."
"Impression: Would love to try another of these, this time at leisure in better setting."
"The aroma might be this beer's best attribute; having had an Espresso Yetti several days ago, my rating may be somewhat jaded when it comes to its flavor."
"drinks great if you are a fan of coffee, which I am. lacking a bit of body and could be a bit more complex, but a solid beer for novices and geeks alike."
"Mouthfeel is pretty average medium body with a nice low carbonation level. Overall a nice enjoyable desert beer and definitely something I'll have again."
"Had a pint on nitro at the Wild Colonial in Providence, RI. I dont know if the nitro was the best option for this beer. I was certainly smooth, but it didn't have a character that I'd rate as an A-. Yes, there was a tasty mix of dark-roasted coffee and chocolate, but at times it just seemed dull on my palate for such a highly-rated beer. Still a fine beer, but I've had better coffee porters. There just isn't enough porter flavor."
"Overall, very decent. The coffee flavor is true to the bean, and carries pretty well throughout the beer. At some point, you'll tire of it. The bomber is the right size -- 12 oz is too little, but a 6 pack is too much. Worthy of a try."
"Dean's Beans? Clearly there is no shortage of clever coffee company names. This brew pours a shiny obsidian topped by about a finger of ecru foam. The nose is shockingly dominated by coffee, with added help from chocolate, roasted malt, graham cracker, toffee, and nutmeg notes. The taste is very similar, though the coffee is somewhat toned down a bit, leaving the roasted malts to come further to the fore. The body is a slightly hefty medium, with a light carbonation and a fairly velvety feel. Overall, a solid porter, with a delightfully balanced coffee flavor. This should be the benchmark for future attempts at such a style."
"I'll concur with others that this is a great example of coffee porter. The only drawback is that coffee flavor is the only thing this beer really has going for it; there are no other grainy flavors coming into the mix to speak of. Luckily for anyone who enjoys coffee, that's the only thing keeping this beer as merely very good and not exceptional."
"The pour resulted in two fingers' worth of mocha-brown head with great retention. Nose was just like fresh-brewed coffee. Dean's Beans, indeed! Color was a deep, dark brown, allowing only a little light to penetrate. Mouthfeel was on the thin side with a chocolaty coffee taste on the tongue. Finish was surprisingly light with a bit of vanilla intermingled with the coffee flavor. Great lacing throughout."
"Overall: Drinkable and not chewy, this beer does not produce an overly dry feeling or the syrupy sweetness found in some similar beers. This is a fine evening porter and a good dessert beer."
"D - $3.99 for a bomber. This is a solid go-to for me and my buddies who went to UMass."
"D: An ok beer, but I don't feel the need to have it again."
"drinkability is great. nice balance. good complexity. a little extra depth and character from the coffee. good stuff!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, pretty tasty and drinkable stuff. Thanks Russ!"
"I had this on draft at the Sunset Grill on a recent visit to Boston. A 95 degree day was probably not the best day to have a coffee porter but given that it was very good. Very dark color with a dark head. Good coffee and malt flavor with a very thick mouthfeel. I think I hope I see this again during the colder weather sometime."
"Light body, but chock full of roasty and sweet coffee flavors. Crushed grain flavors are there, and seem to play a main role in all three of the BBC beers I have had so far. Reminds me of Honey-Nut Cheerios with a fresh cup of coffee. Fairly sweet, but that is offset nicely by the heavy roast. Good brew, simplistic but tasty and very drinkable."
"While I maintain this drinks more like a stout (especially given the mouthfeel), it's an enjoyable beer nonetheless. The coffee is assertive yet never oversteps its bounds. Worth a shot."
"D Easy drinker but not a fantastic brew. This is an OK beer but I don't think I will seek this one out in the future."
"This was poured into a tulip and shared courtesy of Andrewinski1. Pours black with about a finger of head that dissipates quickly. Decent lacing on this guy. Picked this up and put it to my nose and I'm onslaught by coffee. Fantastic. Rich malts and hints of chocolate linger in the background. Taste lots of bitter espresso, and again, roasted malts. The finish tantalizes my taste buds with hints of cocoa. I know this is a coffee porter, but the coffee is actually a little overpowering. I wish it was a little more subtle. The body is a little more light than what I would generally expect from a beer like this and the carbonation is a little more than preferred. I do wish this was a little heavier. Fair enough to drink, but not one I love."
"D- Nice porter overall and the coffee just adds another level of enjoyment to it. Another great beer from a surprisingly good brewery."
"Drinkability: On nitrous i could drink this all night long. It is definately a beer to be enjoyed at night time when you are planning on staying awake. I've had it in the bottle before and i wasnt as impressed as i was on draught. From the bottle i felt like this beer tasted more like coffee left on the burner too long, but i really enjoyed the nitro draught and will definitely be coming back to get it again."
"13 oz pour at Sunset grill, Brighton, MA. Jet black, but with noticeable nitrogenization. Dense off white head, as it should be. Coffee and port aroma with a hint of vanilla. Heavy up front, but not the creamy, tounge coating feel reminiscent of brew on nitro. Coffee with some alcohol noticeable. Improves considerably on warming. Mouthfeel is somewhere between a stout and porter."
"Coffee and porters make such an innate pairing because they share similar and complimentary features. There is definite overlap between the two: the smokiness and roast, the level of aromatics, the dark and decadent flavour, a drinkability that is both sensual and gratifying. Want more proof? Pick up a bottle of Berkshire Coffeehouse Porter."
"It's a good dinner beer, if I were into food pairings, I'd always have this on reserve."
"This is my first beer from Berkshire Brewing Company. I look forward to trying some of their other offerings. The beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is strong coffee. The flavor is roasted malt with some coffee. The beer has a mouthfeel that is a little thinner than expected and it has medium carbonation."
"I don't really mind the bitter, relatively acidic character of this beer (I *do* drink my coffee black), and it does quite a bit well. That main, creamy chocolate/coffee/roasted malt flavor that carries both the smell and the taste is really nice. Still, I'd say this isn't the best porter around, nor is it the best beer from Berkshire Brewing Company. I will say though, I'm pretty interested in trying the nitro-tap version of this beer. It sounds like a good fit."
"Taste of this beer is extraordinary. One of the best coffee porters/stouts I have ever had. Lots of coffee but not overpowering. Smooth milky coffee flavor that is not astingent in the least. Some mocha comes through. But it's the mild, yet significant coffee flavor that really makes this beer stand out. The flavor complexity comes simply from this great balance of coffee flavor. Mouthfeel was also exceptional. This beer is a stand out. Will look foward to finding it in the future."
"D- easy to drink, definitely would drink again, not a top 2 pick but a top 5 out out of my favorite dark beers."
"D - Not bad. For a porter it was pretty good. Semi-sessionable."
"Not overly bitter, not overly sweet, but very easy to drink."
"Flavor is just as expected. A very nice porter with lots of coffee flavor. There's a slight sweet sugary aftertaste...vanilla maybe? Theres a mild bitter bite in the mid range of this taste, but definitely not overkill...infact it compliments the flavor very nicely! Medium body, mild carbonation, very good coffee flavor. Very good porter from Bershire!"
"BBC is favorite brewery of mine. I'd opt for their more balanced (harder to find) Drayman's Porter. -Cheers!"
"D: A good porter overall, and well-served as a dessert drink. However, I found the final third of my bomber to be a bit more than I wanted. A pint would've sufficed because of the chocolatey sweetness."
"D - Quite. Yes indeed. 4.0"
"The taste is so smooth and wonderful. It's not too sweet and overpowering like a lot of beers with chocolaty tastes. The coffee is perfect (Deans Beans baby!). I could drink this all day. I enjoy it a little bit on the warmer side because the coffee taste becomes more prevalent."
"The beer is well carbonated, and the alcohol is well hidden. The beer has a medium body, just right for a porter and it won't be difficult to drink the entire bomber."
"Exceptional, and one of the best porters I can recall having in some time."
"The fact that I can buy it just up the road, for $4 bucks a bottle makes it a ""No Brainer."""
"D - It is definitely a beer to bring to a gather for others to try. Not necessarily one to have three or four pints of in an evening but as someone who has been turned on to coffee porters, this would be a start. Read many reviews on how it would be paired up well with a dessert...I might wing it and try it for myself."
"D: Another great offering from BBC. If you're looking for big coffee flavor, this beer is for you."
"Dark brown with a nice foamy off-white head. Smell is faint of coffee and slight chocolate. Nitro-tap is excellent for this beer, the head tastes like espresso foam. The tastes are simple but great, coffee, dark malts, dark chocolate. Coffee is excellent in the aftertaste. Nice hop addition, maybe citrus and grassy? Nothing over the top about it but it's just great and easy to drink. I've had this in the bottle too but it's definitely worth trying again on nitro-tap (which I think Dive Bar permanently has), great in either version. Great price for this too. I've had lots of Berkshire's beers and I'd say this is easily the highlight of their lineup."
"Mouthfeel is a little on the thinner side then I usually like in a porter, but it makes it a little more of a sessionable beer. Overall I liked this beer but it wouldn't be my first choice of a coffee flavored beer. The coffee was pretty strong, but good if you like coffee flavored beers."
"A: Lots of sticky espresso-like foam that is clinging to the sides of the glass, the beer is dark brown to black in color - 3.50, S: Powerful aromas of coffee as one might expect given the name of the beer, lots of speciality malts involved including what I perceive as black patent and chocolate malts, a little bit of charring to the beer - 4.25, T: Following the lead of the nose there are tons of coffee and espresso flavors as well as some roastiness and a little baker's chocolate, subtle dark fruit sweetness such as dates or plums, a little citrus bite comes through all the malts - 4.25, M: Medium bodied and slightly silky - 4.50, D: All around a very enjoyable beer and one I'd gladly drink again - 4.50"
"D: Just great, I always get this when it's available."
"In short, this is an excellent brew from Berkshire. Smooth, flavorful, a little lacking in the coffee department, but oh so drinkable. I also think this would be a great beer for introducing friends to the craft beer scene. Very approachable. I'm also glad this beer is stocked near my house. Definitely pick some up if you see it."
"Overall it's a nice coffee beer. I've had ones with better coffee balance, but this one I can still drink as a porter and be pleased about!"
"Drinkability: I was burned out of coffee beers but this one is outstanding. I love how the flavors unravel as they cross my pallate. This a complex and enjoyable beer to sit with. I will look for this in the future."
"Thanks Mikey."
"D: At 6.2% ABV and with such a deep roasted malt and coffee flavor, you likely wouldn't session this porter or start moving to other beer shortly after. However, as a dessert beer or accompaniment to a chocolate and/or vanilla dish, something with berries or dare I say, with breakfast, this would be a great brew to have on hand."
"Overall: Good to try once but thats about it."
"Found this on tap at The Riverview in Brattleboro, VT. It's a solid dark brown color with a big fluffy oatmeal head and gobs of lacing. The aroma is a nice tart molasses coffee and the flavor follow suit with an obvious sharp but somewhat floral hop overtone over a chewy sweet malt molasses base. A pretty velvetty feel with modest but fair carbonation. Some raisin and caramel notes. Very nice and reasonably drinkable for the style."
"D: Quite good, one of the selling points of this beer. Never overpowering in any sense, and rather yummy overall."
"D - Very drinkable for a coffee porter. You could drink more than one."
"Overall, this is one of my favorite coffee brews, mainly because it's tasty & affordable! Highly recommended for all you coffee & beer lovers out there."
"Goes down nice and easy."
"O- Not what I was hoping for in this one. Not a session beer. One and only."
"It pairs remarkably well with oatmeal, brown sugar, banana, blueberry pancakes....Featured on the future Thru-hiker Hostel and Brewpub. Coming to trails near you once we get it together."
"D- a very sessionable beer. great flavors that aren't too overwhelming, with a nice subtle carbonation make especially drinkable for a porter."
"22oz brown bomber - no bottled on/best by date, purchased at Leary's Fine Wine (http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/2678) on 10/14/09, drank on 10/15/09. Vigorous pour into a tulip produces a light tan 1 finger head, dissipates to leave a very thin tan head over a black body. Huge coffee, black malt nose. Coffee dominates the taste followed closely by those dark roasted malts, surprisingly sweet with just a hint of espresso like astringency. Very smooth, medium/full body, mild carbonation. A very tasty coffee beer, one of my new favorites, great for breakfast or dessert, I will be buying this again."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass. Black appearance, with a nice tan/caramel-colored head that laced spottily. Strong coffee aroma, intertwined with caramel, toffee, and woodiness. The taste was sheer bliss, like someone took an iced coffee, dumped some caramel and bittersweet dark chocolate flavoring in it, and spiked it with alcohol. The finish was smooth, with a nice lingering coffee aftertaste. The body was smooth and medium, which when combined with the flavor certainly makes drinking a few of these possible."
"D = This is a really easy drinking beer for as strong as its flaovrs are."
"Very dark brown with a chestnut hue. The pour produced a one inch cap of tan foam that coated the glass. Sticky lace, good head retention. The aroma was malty, caramel and toffee with some roast and coffee, but really seemed one dimensional or flat. Moderate bitterness with plenty of sweet malt. Roast hit mid-palate and it ended with caramel and toffee mixed with light hops. Coffee lingered in the finish. Medium bodied with lowish carbonation, decent texture. A solid porter, but the coffee didn't add a lot of character and the hopping seemed to be on the conservative side."
"This beer remains in my file of ""go to beers."" It is multi-dimensional while straight forward, and has a full flavor without being overpowering or too big. This is one of New England's best beers."
"Even mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, good body for the style. Average drinkability for me, could be more complex."
"Served in a standard pint. Poured a deep brown with some light penetration around the edges revealing ruby-red highlights. Half inch, dense off-white head (excellent retention) exposed thick, concentric bands of lacing as the brew was consumed - incredible legs. Nose was coffee beans - nuff said. Taste follows nose, with the addition of some chocolate notes in the mix. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and extremely creamy with a pleasant carbonation in the back to round it all out. Easy drinking and quite flavorful. I thought this brew was decent in the bottle and good on tap, but nitro really brings out the character of this beer. Top notch."
"Drinkability: I've always been a fan of Berkshire's offerings, simply because at a price of $3.49, you get a high quality brew that doesn't break the bank. I haven't been dissapointed in anything these guys have done and this one is no different. A perfect example of how coffee and beer can be combined to make a robust, bold, yet enjoyable session beer. I wish I could wake up everyday to this in my coffee cup. Another great outing by one of the most slept on brewers in the country."
"Overall: Good but not great. Not my cup of tea. Or coffee."
"Poured a dark brown color with an average brown frothy head. Nose is a bit faint and skuny with moderate roasted coffee aroma. Taste is flat. Where is the coffee? Mouthfeel is roasted malts with really no other flavors at all. The slight skunked flavor tends to creep out a bit in the end. I think I may have had a bad one so i wont kill it on ratings."
"Pours a dark, opaque brown with a light tan three finger head that dies down rather quickly. Head is pretty thin and fizzy looking. Very light lacing is left on the glass as it is consumed. Smell is of strong coffee beans, as displayed on the bottle. Definitely picking up on some chocolate, maybe citrus and roasted malts too. Taste here is very interesting. Lots of coffee up front with some roasted malts and chocolates in the background. It also has some hoppy bitterness/citrus to it which adds a nice element to the brew. Beer leaves a coat of coffee on the tongue and reminds of the after taste of a nice black coffee, some citrus in the after taste too. Mouthfeel is good, light to medium and smooth, no alcohol taste in this beer at all, good carbonation too. Drinkability is good here, nice and light with a good coffee taste, its like a coffee russian imperial but lighter in feel, more sessionable, coffee taste would get old after a while though. Very good pricing on this one too."
"D/Notes: one thing I noted here was how the coffee flavors were really wavering in and out in strength. Sometimes the coffee was strong and overwhelming, and sometimes it was subtle under the citrus hop. Very interesting, and a good pair for a salad with feta soaked in adobo sauce and whiskey."
"drinkability - Mmm one of favorite beers and it was intereting to find it on nitro tap."
"A really good beer, i love how this beer is not very sweet. The dryness and the coffee bitterness lends some harshness that brings down the taste a little, but a great coffee porter overall."
"Nice drinking coffee beer. It doesn't rise above the pack, with nothing to set it apart, but a very solid, pragmatic example of the style."
"Pours thick and black, almost stout-thick. Head had nice retention, and some great lacing over the course of the beer. Smells like an iced coffee almost, kind of sweet, kind of coffeeish but not. Tastes like a mellow coffee blend - on the sweeter side but not overbearingly so, but not like one of those harsh jamaican blends. Lingers nicely on the palate, very well carbonated. On the mellower side of porters, not a lot of roasty bite behind it, which in this case works to its advantage. Very drinkable, especially as the night goes on. A high quality coffee beer."
"it's an easy favorite for some late night breakfast people ,pancakes at midnight ??,you bet. cheers.."
"D - This is a very good coffee porter. Well-balanced and delicious."
"D: A very good porter than is a half-step below BBC's Draymans Porter but still very good and with a solid coffee presence that provides a dominant, but not overwhelming note."
"D - Coffee. Plain and simple. If you love coffee, you'll love this beer. Could I drink this all day? Yes!"
"I like this beer but it would be a once in a while beer for me."
"I love this beer and definitely buy it more than the other BBC releases at least 3 to 1. No complaints, just an all around great coffee beer."
"D - Can't see drinking much of this at once, but can imagine it being quite decent to go along with a chocolate based desert or ice cream. Might pair well with a char-grilled steak too, but I'd stick with desert offerings with this one."
"Overall: Outstanding drinkability, good basic flavors. The coffee aroma is much stronger than the coffee flavor. Overall lighter than many other porters but that contributes to the great drinkability."
"This is a good porter, nice mouth feel with a pretty stander yet good flavor."
"Very drinkable. Good balance between the coffee and porter flavors. Hops add a nice edge. My first experience with Berkshire Brewing Company is a good one. As a fan of coffee, I'll be looking for more coffee flavored beers."
"Thanks to Reagan1984 for including this in recent trade. Not sure if I have encountered a coffer porter, so I am excited to try it. Pours a very dark brown (its not quite black, and is almost a deep ruby red around the edges where the light peaks through). A nice thick tan head rests atop, and leaves solid lacing as you sip it. A nice bitter coffee aroma awaits in the nose, its backed up by a faint roasted malt, but coffee is the dominant player here. First sip follows suit to the aroma, a very nice bitter coffee flavor as well. While I have never had a coffee porter, this stands up to the coffee stouts I have had, in terms of a good coffee add. In this case, the coffee flavor is front and center, and almost overtakes the beer. Rather thick for a porter, which made me wonder if you poured this for someone, and didn't tell them it was a porter, if they would assume it is a stout. Had this early on a Saturday, and wished I held it until the end, it would be a nice way to cap off a hearty meal in the winter."
"Thanks to brothercannon for bringing this back from VT for me. Poured from a 22 ounce bomber bottle into my nonic Imperial pint glass. This porter appears a translucent dark chestnut color with barely half an inch of creamy ecru foam. Nose is of brown sugar, semi-sweet chocolate, and medium roasted coffee beans. Flavor consists of mildly bitter coffee, roasted grains, and a touch of vanilla. I would have liked a fuller body and a bit more carbonation, but this is only a minor gripe. Overall, this porter is quite tasty and drinkable."
"Final Thoughts - Nice job by BBC. I think I might prefer this out of the bottle more than on tap. Never the less, good entry in the flavored porter genre, and usual good effort by BBC."
"Overall an average coffee beer that could be much thicker and much roastier. It seems like a lot more could be done with 6.2% abv."
"HV"
"This beer is robust with a low level of carbonation. The mouthfeel is a bit thin."
"Pours a somewhat murky black/brown with just a thin ring for a head. Smells like a nice, mellow, good quality coffee with a touch of cream and sugar. A hint of toffee throughout as well. On the tongue there is a good deal more roastiness, even char. Chocolatey and fairly rich for the style, but dry as it should be. The coffee comes through with a darker roast and the cream is still there but more subdued. Either way, it marries well together. Rich and smooth in the mouth, and quite pleasureable all around."
"Another solid beer from the Berkshire Brewery. Fantastic coffee porter that beats out many of the same ilk. Pours a nice smooth dark brown to black with 2 finger full dense head that retains good lace & lets off a nice dark roasted black coffee aroma. Smooth feel with mildest of carbonation and a good bitter dark coffee with nut malts, and a hint of cocoa & hops. Not too sweet, which is great in my book. A great way to spend 22oz...or more!"
"Good coffee porter."
"Drinkability: Pretty good. Nothing about this beer is absolutely amazing, but then again there's nothing bad or even remotely negative about this beer. Good drinkability."
"Overall its a solid coffee beer that I will probably never be able to buy in MN. Its not the most amazing, but it isnt terrible either."
"A nice American porter may lie underneath, but though I love good coffee the coffee here just doesn't do anything particularly great for me. It drinks easily enough though the 22 ounces was more than enough for me. A nice porter, in the end, with a nice citric balance, and the coffee part isn't ""bad", but not the rich coffee type I prefer in my coffee-flavoured beers."
"Drinkability- I think I'm a bit spoiled when it comes to these coffee brews. I love coffee. I love coffee beers. BUT I love them both intense. This namby pamby subtle stuff is for other styles, not coffee beers. If you want a subtle coffee flavor, add more roasted malt but don't tease me with the actual use of coffee. Cup O' Joe, Coffee Bender, Péché Mortel, Bells Java Stout - all great coffee beers with BIG coffee flavor. That's what I look for and this falls short. Big thanks for the opportunity Mike!"
"Very, very drinkable... I like it and will be back..."
"Aroma is what you would expect from a good coffee brew. Roasted coffee and smoked/roasted malts. The flavor is surprisingly bold for a beer that isn't ""big"" Very flavorful for a porter. Definite coffee in the flavor with chocolate up front. A little watery in the body but that is as expected for a porter. Once again Berkshire produces another fine crafted brew."
"D - Just not exciting for me."
"D - Very drinkable beer. Smooth, creamy and delicious flavor comes from the coffee and slightly bitter chocolate. I'd certainly start the night with one of these again. Especially on a cold, windy winter night, like it was when I slowly sipped this one."
"This is a great coffee porter and though the taste doesn't quite live up to the promise of the aroma, I'm really enjoying this one. Recommended."
"This is a great version of the porter. Havent had a coffee porter (unless you count Founders Porter) but I really enjoyed this one. Easy drinker and glad to have this one. Thanks Doc!"
"Appearance is typical nitro look big cascading head with a dark brown almost black color of the beer . The aroma is incredible smells like black coffee with a back of porter chocolate/roasted malts . The taste is the same as the aroma black coffe with bitter chocolate roasted malts and sweet undertones . The mouthfeel is almost stout like in thickness but the taste is definetly porter . This is a great winter beer good for a cold day ."
"D: A pleasant sipping beer, the coffee really stands out with a robust finish. I'd like a little more porter to step in behind the coffee but that's just my opinion."
"This is a fairly drinkable beer. Goes down easy and tastes great. Definitely a desert beer or one to have while sitting in front of a roaring fire. I don't think this is one I'll keep coming back to, but I really enjoyed it."
"All in all, one of the better iterations of a coffee porter. A bit on the light side, and it strays away from the sweet side of the spectrum, but does so delciously. Savory, espresso-y, and deliciously drinkable. If this were readily available out this way, it would most likely be a fairly regular purchase."
"Goes down smooth and easy. Good drinkability."
"I have had this several times from the bomber, and on tap was a nice experience for sure. Became much more flavorful as it warmed- it was served slightly too cold for my taste. Nice clean coffee flavor with some chocolate folded in were present in both the aroma and taste. Nice substance to the mouthfeel, but still incredibly drinkable. Its not too high ABV- and seems like it should be higher for the amount of flavor and body it packs. A real treat to have this one on nitro and I will definitely seek it out again in the future."
"D: Goes down easy. Too easy! I was done with this before I'd finished typing the review. Loved the interplay between the coffee and chocolate. Would love to try this on draft!"
"This is a great local alternative to Founders Breakfast Stout. While I don't think it's quite at the same level as its distant cousin from Michigan, Coffeehouse Porter is a great value."
"Out of a 22 oz. bomber this beer was a dark color that was nearly black and can only be seen as a brown up to sunlight. The head was tan, two fingers thick, retained itself well and laced well to. The aroma was very appealing, roasted malt and roasted coffee with hints of bittersweet chocolate. The flavors were similarly dark, rich coffee like a mocha with dry, roasted malt and some earthiness. The finish was crisp too. The body was medium and the mouthfeel smooth making it very drinkable and sessionable. Impressive as Porters go and one of the best coffee hybrids I have tried to date."
"6/3/6/3/14/3.2"
"Decent, but the lack of body and flavor depth compromises an otherwise pleasant brew."
"Notes from 2/3/06"
"D- It's my favorite porter and my favorite BBC brew. It's tasty and smooth. I highly recommend it. From my experience it is best from a nitro-tap"
"I never drink coffee but i really like it went its incorporated with beer. Pours a dark down, with a off white foamy head, thick lacing follows the beer down. A pleasant roasted coffee aroma, with some chocolate and caramel hints. Has a medium body with a bittersweet coffee flavor and goes down very smooth. Overall a very good use of coffee flavor in this porter."
"Deep, dark brown with a creamy tan head and great retention. Smell is quite nice. Chocolate and grain with excellent addition of coffee. Taste is the same. Nothing too exciting but a well rounded flavor. Coffee isn't too over the top and a good compliment to a Porter. Good creamy smooth mouthfeel with a slight bitterness in the finish. Very drinkable stuff. I'm a coffee fan so this one does well. Simple but very refined. Not much wrong with this brew."
"This beer wasn't crazy, it was smooth and low key. A good beer. I have nothing bad to say about it, but nothing exceptional either. I think that you will enjoy it and I plan on trying it out of a bottle as well if I see it around."
"Solid coffee porter - not quite as interesting as Tyranena, but preferable to Mill St."
"I'll certainly be coming back to this one and would choose it over a Guinness every time."
"Pours a three finger light tan head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Deep mahogany color. Roasted coffee nose. Light-medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Flavor is sweet roasted coffee, smooth but finishes as burnt coffee, still very drinkable. $3.94 for a 22oz bottle from Ruggeri & Sons Greenfield, MA."
"D: This is a good brew and would be much better if it had more to offer in the aroma area. It is great in taste and really represents the style well. I dig this beer and wish I had good access to it. Drink it up. Don't be fooled by the somewhat cheesy packaging and put it in your basket. Serve and enjoy."
"Pours a deep dark brown with beautiful deep ruby highlights and a fluffy mocha head that sticks around fora little bit. Smells of roasted grains, lots of coffee, some chocolate. Taste is of chocolate and coffee. Smooth creamy mouthfeel medium to thick body. If there ever was a sessionable coffee porter this would be it. One of my favorites from Berkshire, I'm surprised I'm just reviewing it now."
"This is a very good porter. Definitely recommended."
"D - The thin mouthfeel actually makes it feel less heavy and more drinkable but overall not exactly what i'm looking for in a coffee porter"
"M/D - Full flavored and medium bodied. Very crisp beer. If you love coffee drinkability would be a five. I knoceked it down 1/2 a point because the coffee is just too dominating for my liking."
"drinkability: good"
"Drinkability gets docked only because I'm not sure how often I'd want to go this route with my porter... but it's a great coffee forward beer. Fans of the huge Imperial/Double stouts with coffee should give this one a try when they want something that's an easier drinking experience."
"D: Very drinkable for a coffee brew. There are a lot of coffeebombs out there that could learn a good lesson from the balance and smoothness of Coffeehouse Porter. It leans towards the sipper end of the scale, but an easy beer to drink."
"The drinkability was impacted for me because of the mouthfeel. However, overall, this is a beer I would like to have again because of the scent and taste. I'm willing to look past the consistency for this one."
"Overall, this is an excellent beer. Very drinkable, rich but not heavy."
"Overall not a bad one at all, though this needed to be a little fuller to play with the big boys. A solid lighter offering with the coffee brews."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Easily sessionable and great coffee flavor. Not overwhelming, but just really enjoyable."
"D: 6.2% won't hinder this easily quaffable brew."
"Drinkability: If you're a coffee fan ... this is for you, period. A really great, tasty, complex, coffee-flavored brew with a manageable abv%. If I had ready access to this, I'd drink it in the morning before I went to work ;)"
"M&D: Medium to thin in body, an easy drinking brew which you could pound. Coffee beers are right up my alley and this one is on par, or in very close running with the best."
"22 oz. bottle, unfiltered and unpasteurized. This is essentially Drayman's Porter with ""natural flavor added;"" the flavor being an extract of Dean's Beans organic coffee made specially for Berkshire Brewing. The beer pours a deep, dark maroon (blood red when held to light), with low carbonation and a two-finger beige cap that recedes after a few minutes, depositing several wisps of lace. Roasted coffee and dark malts first jump to the nose, quickly followed by milk chocolate-covered espresso beans and a touch of nutty yeast. Tastes of iced coffee up front, followed by roasted malts, then come the floral/spicy hops. It has a mild bitterness along with a lightly sour or acidic note from the coffee and a backing of black malts. Fairly light in body, with ample, lightly-tingly carbonation and a dry, coffee-flavored finish. Pretty good porter here - definitely adds another dimension to the Drayman's, but perhaps I was expecting exceptional. Regardless, this is a tasty brew that I would gladly revisit."
"Drinkability is nice. A good subtle coffee flavor that is not too overpowering. One of the most balanced and tasty coffee porters I have ever had."
"Pours medium brown with a small 1/16 inch caramel colored head. Smells of rich coffee dominate the aromas of roasted malts. First sip is coffee, coffee, coffee, followed by a nice tasty bitterness. That coffee taste balances well with the malt, but the coffee dominates and everything else is just playing a supporting role. The malt backbone is surprisingly lighter than expected. I would love to have an imperial version of this really good coffee porter."
"Had a pint at The Other Side Cafe this past Friday evening. Dark brown color with a thin wispy white head. Roasted barley smell. Taste was very unique, as it has a very distinct coffee (almost cappuccino) characteristic blended into that hearty porter flavor. Very nice. The only knock that I have against this beer is that it has a very thin body. I have had it a few times at Deep Ellum which serve it on nitro tap. That seems to give it much more heartiness. A bit on the watery side for my liking. But on the flip side, I could see myself more easily drinking these than the heavier nitro version. A nice, well made version of a porter with a welcome flavor twist."
"Pours dark brown with a huge tan head. Awsome huge oroma of coffee and sweet malts. Nice balance of coffee, toffee, and chocolate flavors, sliding very smoothly into a slightly bitter finish. Medium mouthfeel, Hedium high carbonation. Excellent local beer"
"Served from 22 oz bomber into a pint glass."
"D - This is one for coffee and porter lovers or those who may wake up with java and finish their day w/ porter. The flavor is a nice juxtoposition and stays drinkable as the sum of the parts don't interrupt or intrude on the others strong points. It is so drinkable to me, I just kept sippin' for about an hour- the flavor stayed smooth the whole time. I love the roastiness or should I say how the roastiness is so well balanced. The craftsmanship is great and the blend of coffee in the beer is the epitome of restraint. Since Dean's Beans don't overthrow the quality porter in this excellent coffee flavored ale. I would love to get my hands on more since I enjoyed every drop. It took me back to Silverback Gorilla coffee ale. Thanks again TheManiacalOne!"
"I had this in the morning with some breakfast on my back deck on a easy Sunday morning. It was truly a wish you were here moment that was accompanied by an excellent beer. I hope the east coasters here will keep trading for this. It is a very good beer."
"Pours a dark brown color with mahogany edges, 2 fingers of foamy coffee tan head has good retention and some nice lacing. Smells mainly of coffee, with some roasted malt, and even some citrus, but not much. Tastes of roasted malt, a touch of caramel sweetness and a big coffee finish with a hint of grapefruit or something tangy. Medium in body with lots of carbonation for a porter. Smooth with a strong bitter finish as well as a touch of acidic notes. Lots of coffee flavor but not much else. The higher carbonation and tang in the finish seem a bit off and take away a bit."
"22oz bottle purchased from Charles Street Liquors in Boston. I don't have much faith in the freshness of most of their products, but hopefully the BBC gets rotated quickly. At least I got their refrigerated product. Pours black with little head. Nice lacing. Strong coffee aroma. The flavour has a decent tang to it (hops?) with coffee in the aftertaste. Pretty nice."
"D - Very nice, subtle coffee porter. Even if you are not a fan of coffee (like me), you will most likely enjoy this offering."
"My first taste of Berkshire and I really like what they did with this porter. The coffee is really well integrated and it's obvious there's a solid porter underneath. Can't wait to try some more from Berkshire. Thanks for the treat Derek!"
"Drinks good, coffee porters are hit & miss to me, this one isn't great, but pretty good, a bit too dry for me"
"Poured a very dark brown/black color with a nice tan head that had some lacing down the glass. The head stuck around for a while before finally settling to basically nothing. The aroma was of sweet yet bitter roasted malts and a strong coffee smell with hints of chocolate and caramel. The taste delivered exactly what the nose indicated. Very deep roasted malts with a strong coffee flavoring followed by hints of caramel and chocolate. The mouthfeel was very thick and velvety which made for a really drinkable porter. This is definately worth a try."
"d: Big thanks to DrDogbeer for this extra. Yeah thats right, a growler for an extra! Who does that?!? Thanks Tom! We all enjoyed this one very much. This is certainly a stellar porter."
"Came with a thick creamy inch-thick head atop a dark brown beer. Aroma of roasted coffee was mild but the roasted coffee flavor was dominant and delicious. Real full-bodied, creamy texture with bold espresso and coffee flavors. Bit of a smoky aftertaste - paired perfectly with smoked beef tongue canapes. Would highly recommend to go with any dark, smoked meat."
"Borderline sessionable - satisfying yet not filling. Solid."
"Each new porter I try taps in to the versatility you have in creating porters. This is great beer that pours a darker brown with an off white head. The scent of coffee is apparent at first pour (or right after the bartender pours it for you). I was skeptical in mixing the flavors of a porter and coffee, but Berkshire did a phenomenal job making these two bold tastes mesh together."
"poured from 22 oz bottle into Sam perfect pint glass. Pours a dark brown with off white 1/2 "" head. Settle quickly. Not a ton of aroma at firs, but as I get the glass half empty, WOW!~I get a ton of espresso w/ chocolate aromas. Strong. First few sips taste like coffee! I have had many coffee flavored stouts and porters, and this may be the one where I get the most coffee flavor. As the beer warms, I get more chocolate and coffee flavor. It gets richer as I drink. I must remember to serve this one at cellar temp! Tons of flavor and it gets better with time. Semi slick mouthfeel, with medium body. Another great beer from the guys at BBC. Gotta pick up a couple more of these."
"Drinkability is good. A pretty nice coffee beer. Not too overpowering with coffee flavors, which I like in this style. Tasty enough, but not heavy or overpowering... easy and enjoyable to sip."
"The smell is coffee, and caramel. The beer poured thin for a porter and kind of light in color. I held a nice caramel head about a half an inch thick. This beer has an excellent balance of coffee flavors, a lot of toffee, and no metallic flavor at all. The smell matched flavors with hints of caramel, sort of mild smell overall."
"22oz bottle in pint glass. minimal head, and a dark deep amber color. this beer is highly carbonated. the bubbles coat the inside of your mouth with a velvety sweetness. a very pleasant coffee flavor. it is nicely balanced, very smooth, and very drinkable. subtle woody tasting hints also come out. this is a favorite of mine since i first tried it. for my tastes, a perfect balance of sweetness, maltiness, and bite."
"Nice creamy feel to it, nice and semi-dry. Could have one more but not much more, I don't know if I will be able to sleep. Night-night."
"22 oz bomber. The brew pours a solid brown color with a finger of tan head over top that falls to a half finger. Clarity is moderate and there are few bubbles hitting the surface. The aroma is solid coffee with a milder chocolage and a hint of caramel sweetness with a hint of creamyness as well. Pretty solid. Flavor is very nice. It hits first with a mild ground coffee followed by a solid roasted malt that lends notes of bitter chocolate followed with a mild pine hop, that moves into a nice bitter mocha flavor. I enjoy how the coffee bookends the rest of the flavors. Mouthfeel is moderate with a moderate carbonation that works well with the brew. Overall, I am a fan of this one. I really like how the coffee blends with the beer and doesn't dominate it. It has a nice balance throughout. I've enjoyed this one every time I have had it and this is no exception."
"Overall: Great controlled use of coffee. Wish I could get it in Indiana."
"A dry finish with moderate carbonation, and a lingering aftertaste of coffee, along with a noticeable alcohol warming, but almost no heavy alcohol flavors make this a great drink for breakfast, or with a hearty dinner of game meat, or beef. I highly recommend this beer to anyone who likes coffee, or beer with mild upfront roasted character."
"Very nice."
"Nice thickness but smooth. Medium, not a choker. Quite good. Nice to drink. Feels good and has mildly bitter flavor. Not obsessed with bitterness. Easily drinkable."
"Great coffee porter will drink it again"
"What this beer lacks in complexity it more than makes up for by doing what it does surprisingly well. This is a great coffee beer and though smaller than many I've tasted, it is also more drinkable."
"Drinkability is moderate, higher for coffee fans, this ranks close to Founders Breakfast Stout in terms of the bitter coffee grounds essence, alcohol is not perceptible and this porter is well-balanced, solid beer worth trying out"
"Poured a deep, dark brown in color with just a finger of fluffy tan head that had decent retention. Aroma was fairly subdued; dark roasted malts, coffee, and dark chocolate with just a bit of hops. Taste was much like the aroma. Dark roasted malts and some chocolate were present at first but quickly joined and then overtaken by coffee. The coffee flavor, which was pretty great, lasted into the finish balancing out what sweetness there is in this brew. Without the coffee flavor I would find this beer too sweet. Mouthfeel is good, medium+ body thats quite creamy. Drinkability is quite good. I would certainly recommend this brew."
"Seems a bit thin, carbonation is low. Alcohol is well hidden, is there really any in here? Certainly this is all about coffee, but not a bold, roasty, bitter experience. This one is very smooth, and so easy to drink. Very nice."
"While I do not drink coffee, I did enjoy this beer and would recommend it to coffee lovers"
"Pours a very dark ruby brown that is almost opaque. Some head falls pretty fast. Nose is faint with roasted coffee. Not overly strong, but fairly present. Flavor is very, very good. Strong robust roasted coffee flavors. Long lasting aftertaste. Feel is thick on the liquid and pretty damn silky. Extremely drinkable. So glad I dragged this back from Boston to Brooklyn."
"Pours deep chestnut black with reddish-black highlights. Decent tan head that settles quickly, thinning to a lace around the rim. Smells very malty with cooked nuts, chocolate and black coffee. Starts sweet and finishes drier, if that makes any sense. Has a thick taste, starting with mouth rolling malty sweetness followed by coffee and chocolate malts. These flavors dominate the hops, which come forward after swallowing. Serve this one at cellar temps or slightly warmer, as these flavors get lost at fridge temps. Carbonation does it's job, delivering aroma and amplifying the body, and doesn't make itself a vehicle for belching. Very drinkable on a Christmas Eve."
"Very drinkable, but a tad too modest in all categories. They could stand to ratchet up the malt so you can detect something in the nose. A mild brew that is enjoyable nonetheless just not overly exciting."
"A very dark porter served on tap at Eli Cannon's in CT. The aroma was strong with coffee, not unlike Founder's Breakfast Stout. Honestly this is very similar to Breakfast Stout, except with slightly less body and less malt richness. Even so, this was very good, and I'd get it again."
"D - Glad I was able to try this one. A nice coffee twist on a porter."
"D: A very likable porter with a well-managed 'coffee' character. I've tried some other coffee porters and found them to be either so dominated by the dark roastedness of the beans or, worse, not having any more than a fading hint of coffee. This is right in the middle: a coffee porter with other flavors and aromas intertwined. I like it, I recommend it and I'd have it again...maybe for dessert."
"Poured a very dark, clear brown-amber capped off by a thick and creamy caramel coloured head. Left large lacing clinging to the glass. Even the appearance is tasty and rich. The nose is dominated by strong, dark, roasty coffee malts. Light hints of caramel comes through as well, sweet, rich and full nose. No hoppy florals or fruity esters are noticeable. The taste is very proper to what I expected from a coffee porter. Coffee flavor is strong, roasty, sweet and quite like black coffee. No hops flavors. I lost the caramel from the nose, but picked up a bit of cocoa. The bitterness is mild in the mid/after taste. Dry finish. Very light warming. Very full and heavy in the mouth, low carbonation adds both to the heaviness and the coffee-esque qualities. Not entirely complex for a porter, but it's really quite tasty and richly flavored and well done as a 'coffeehouse.' It's too rich and dry to drink many of, but really tasty and smooth, inviting to drink a few."
"A little too sweet to drink a whole lot of, but a nice treat. I'd definitely split a bomber of this between two or three people, though."
"I was hoping for a pleasing, pleasurable porter. What I got was a deep-dish dessert with a mighty fine cup of coffee chaser. It is as advertised. The ABV is actually downsized but more present than expected, yet it drinks like a tasty daydream. And it got better and fuller as we got closer to the end. It's most certainly a do-over, should I ever get the opportunity."
"Nice thin layer of creamy head when poured into a glass. The head eventually comes downs to a swirly lace. The smell of it is amazing. It reminds me of a solid porter infused with Starbucks Coffee. Kinda tingly going down with enough carbonation for a porter. The best part about it, has to be sweet coffee taste. Two things in this world that I can't go without. Coffee and Beer! I wish I could get it in a 12pk."
"A very smooth malt with a coffee taste that lives up to its name. Nice lightish medium body and quite refreshing considering all the heavy smoked porters on the market. The chocolate and coffee work well together with right amount of bitterness. Brilliant beer for a leisurely loaf in the evening"
"Wow, this one took me by surprise! Highly drinkable, the taste and body of this comes through not only for coffee lovers but those fans of good Porters in general. Another very solid brew from Berkshire."
"Mild coffee in the flavor, mixed with a caramel toffee element in the middle. Dominated by malt. Not harsh or especially roasty at all. Finish is dry, and there's a mild astringency from the coffee. Fairly mellow feeling and light bodied for a Porter, with a good level of carbonation. Seems to take cues from Sam Smith Taddy Porter. One could finish a bomber pretty easily due to it's mellow nature."
"Pours a dark color with a tan head. Aroma is very strong and rich with a nice, powerful hint of roasted coffee. Also smells very creamy. Taste is very rich and roasty upfront with a decent, astringent coffee finish. A second sip confirms some chocolate upfront that fades to a roasted coffee aftertaste. Yum. It's like someone poured a pot of coffee into a decent porter. This beer would be something good to drink in the morning. Has enough of a caffeine kick. I like it."
"Pours a nice clean dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice fizzy tannish head, some nice sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is malty, big dose of coffee/caramel/toffee, and slight vanilla. The taste is malty, lots of coffee/toffee and caramel, slightly sweet at the beginning, the finish is a little bitter. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is my first Berkshire and I must say it is very delicious, highly recommended."
"I have in the past put a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream in the glass and found it to my liking"
"Lingering aftertaste. Get this while you can and drop it like its hot."
"My first Berkshire beer and what a first impression,poured into an imperial pint glass a deep dark brown with a hint of ruby a pillowy slight off white head atop a creamy froth after it settles.The coffee shows thru wich was expected along with some molasses and milk chocolate with a slight earthy presence.Coffee is prevalent on the palate but not overbearing almost like a mochachino coffee blend with a late earthiness wich made me wanna drink more.A big smooth creamy mouthfeel just enhanced the flavors of this beer,a damn fine porter one of the better I have had in quite awhile for sure."
"One of my favorite brews from one of my favorite brewers. Im not a coffee drinker, but I find the coffee flavoring in this beer delicious. Well worth a try."
"As a coffee lover, this beer was spectacular. The coffee aroma and taste was sharp and explicit. I am not sure how much that would attract one to this porter however. But, seeing that it is porter, I am certain many will be drawn to this drink. It had a great, thick flavor. It's appearance resembled a dark, roasty coffee. And the coffee flavor was very well developed. It was not so strong, though, as to make one feel you were drinking something from your local cafe. Like I said, it might not be for everyone but I feel many porter lovers will want to try this unique drink."
"All around great beer. Great smell... full of taste and complexity. Definatly one of the best beers I've had in a long time."
"Drinkability: The chocolate and coffee blend together to create a very nice mocha element"
"Should have picked up more. Doh!"
"Bomber poured into a pint glass. Very dark brown with a medium-sized head that persisted fairly well. Coffee aroma, not anything else. Strong coffee taste, like a dark roast. Pretty smooth. I think it comes across exactly as advertised, although I think it was more coffee than porter."
"I also had this on nitro at the Amerherst Brewery and it was not as good. Lace, and licorice. I think the nitro definately cuts down the taste."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich and bitter black malt scent along with a mild coffee presence. It's quite dry and earthy. The taste is good also. It has a smooth black malt and coffee flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry and earthy with a fine coffee residue. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. There seems to be a split opinion on the coffee flavored beers. Personally, I like them. This is a damn good porter. The coffee only enhances the malt profile."
"Bottom line is that if you like porters and coffee you would not be dissapointed with this brew. I wouldn't call it a session beer because it very rich and I could only find 22 OZ bottles, and at $5-7 a bottle it is a great special occasion beer!"
"All of you coffee lovers out there need to seek this beer out."
"Pours very dark, with only the merest of nut brown highlights when held to direct light. Dusting of a head that leaves pretty Brussels lace. Aromas are dark and rich -- they're simplistic coffee and chocolate notes, but they're pleasing. Thick tastes crowd the palate -- roasted coffee beans, a bit of dark chocolate, and a sweet cream note that leaves an overall impression somewhat similar to coffee yogurt, but in a good way. Mouthfeel is creamy, with medium carbonation and a bit of acidic sourness, and it all works very well. Overall, this is excellent stuff. One of the better attempts at mixing coffee with beer that I've had."
"Unusual to have a 'coffee porter' but this works perfectly. I find porters much more clean and refreshing than the heavier stouts and this is no exception. Very enjoyable."
"Black in color with no head and very little cascade. Rich, dark aromas of coffee and roasted nuts waft up from the glass. The first sip says it all: bold. intense and deep flavors of coffee, chocolate and mild hops. The mouthfeel is good, not overbearing, but pleasant. I couldn't imagine having more than a couple of these as the flavors were pretty intense."
"Tasted good. Coffee very present, but not the best cuppa. Again, some chocolate, roast malts, and some sweet candied fruit going on. Not the greatest mouthfeel, but creamy. I wish the finish were less sweet, more dry. Certainly goes down easy, though. Probably the best porter I've had from BBC, and if I could find these bottles locally, I'd be on this fairly regularly, especially for dessert!"
"D: I could easily drink several of these in a sitting (if they were in 12oz and not 22oz bottles, very smooth, drinkable beer."
"and I like it."
"Good stuff overall, but I personally like the smell much more than flavour of coffee, so while I was surprised that I did enjoy this one so much, I would have again but on a limited basis."
"This one doesn't do it for me. I think the flavor that I interpret as hazlenut turns me off to this one. Its the same flavor I found in Rogue's beer too and I don't care for that one either. This might be okay for some people, but I think it needs a healthy dose of toasted malts to kick this up and balance it out more."
"D: Not one of my favorite coffee brews but not a bad beer. Its hard to get the flavor to be rich opposed to sour in these coffee beers and Im not sure this one accomplished that."
"D: A very good well made intense coffee tasting porter. The best of the Berkshire beers that I have tried."
"Drinkability: Flavorful and balanced."
"This bottle is supposed to be pretty fresh, but from the other reviews I've read - there is something wrong with this. I could drink it if I had to - but I don't. What a shame as I was looking forward to this one very much...."
"D - The bastard love child of a straight American Porter and roasted Guatemalan Coffee beans. Extra points for balance and originality. Very drinkable, if not a smidge cloying after getting through half a bomber. Still, a quality product."
"Drinkability: very enjoyable porter. Easy to drink and worth seeking out on draft."
"Very easy drinking drank this 22 very easily coud drink another. Very enjoyable porter. Give this one a try!"
"I'm really starting to love this brewery."
"One of my favorite BBC offerings, highly recommended."
"Drinkability: A very nice after dinner/dessert beer that I would most likely sip on but would not make a session out of it."
"A very solid porter. The quite complex tastes play around with the tongue, yet it goes down very smooth."
"Dark and rich in color , somewhat lacking in the coffe aroma but when you taste it ...it's in there. Not to much or to little of an expresso taste so as to not overpower the beer. Extremely smooth and rich for a porter. A nice coffee flavor that lingers long after you swallow the beer ."
"One of my favs . Will be buying more of this . Cheers"
"Notes: If you're a coffee lover, this one is for you. They did a real good job infusing it into this brew."
"Nearly black pour with mahogany around the dges and a lively tan colored head that leaves lacing everywhere, points for the lacing. Smells delicious. Taste is much like the draymans porter I had the other day that must be the base for this beer, with some tweeking--the addiction of the cofeee is not as overpowering, and seems to do this brew right. The flavor is present, complex, and adds dimension that balances out the unfermentables, makes it taste more like a porter (the roasting factor) than the drayman's, and an odd milkshake cream kind of flavor is present as well in the mix. As I continue to sip I can taste a bit more of the earthy malts and unfermentables behind the coffee flavor than I'd like to here, and even a tad more hops wouldn't hinder the flavor either, but overall, delicious enough to make even those who might not like porters want more. A hands down delicious brew especially compared to the run-of-the-mill drayman's. Mouthfeel is quite fine here, quite thick and full feeling, but more carbonation burn than the drayman's kept this from a five. Overall, this brew makes it clear why BBC has such a cult following, and will lead me to try more when I'm able."
"for my BA annv."
"Can't believe I've lived in Deerfield for seven years, and this is probably the 2nd CHP I've ever had. What an idiot I am. As the name suggests, it is a virtual parfait of coffee houseness. What one might expect walking into a coffee house where there were just a bunch of nobodies sitting around doing nothing other tan drinking coffee. Deep caramel and vanilla tones, highlighted by a slightly bitter aftertaste and a faint hop kick. Lends or tends itself more of a midday drink rather than an early evening starter. However, I found it very enjoyable, regardless of the time of consumption."
"An excellent porter, and something I'll definitely keep buying, though somewhat understated for coffee flavor."
"poured from a 22oz. bottle almost black with a tan two finger head that stayed fairly well and a good lacing to the finish. smell is like coffee ice cream. taste is slightly bitter coffee. mouthfeel malty smooth, good carbonation. nice to have for a change of pace, nice coffee taste thats not to weak or to strong."
"D: I'd say this beer is quite drinkable, as its subtle flavors and large roasted coffee taste make it one to experience again."
"Berkshire Brewing's Coffeehouse Porter is a taste treat. It pours inot the bottle a nice dark color, with a very nice tan foamy head. The smell is coffee and sweetness. The taste is coffee through and through. The mouthfeel has a rather bitter tang which sticks to the tongue for some time. An enjoyable brew. But only if you like coffe with a bitter kick."
"Pours a very dark mahogony with a medium sized tan head. The head leaves almost no lacing and the only light I could see thru this was when put up directly against a lamp. The smell is coffee,chocolate, and roasted malt. Not as pungent as I would have thought. The taste is very creamy with coffee,chocolate, roasted malt,and some hop bitterness. This is a very good tasting beer. The m/f is medium with all the flavors mixing OK, just a tad too hoppy from my tastes,but still good. A damn good beer that will keep those winter nights warm."
"I really enjoyed this one. Flavorful malts with a little bit of a creamy coffee flavor to it. It also has a very smooth aspect to it, making it very drinkable. Best enjoyed slowly... if you can help yourself. Recommended."
"I found this beer quite drinkable, and would definitely consider getting it again, or picking up a six of it. Though the beer is predominantly coffee in taste, I did not find it over powering, and there is the subtle chocolate that keeps things interesting. After a bitter winter day this would be a nice drink to have around the fire with a few friends."
"I've tried this one a few time and it seems to get better every time i revisit it. Pours a nice black with nearly no light getting through at all. There is also a nice half inch white head with exceptional retention. Aroma is very reminiscent of beers such as Founders Breakfast Stout or Peche Mortel in the dark burnt coffee. Youn can really smell those coffee beans in there. Taste was very similar to the smell, but not nearly as harsh on coffee flavors like the beers mentioned above. To be honest, I did not pick up on many other flavors, maybe a bit of chocolate, but either way it works quite well. Mouthfeel is lighter then I had expected, but it does make it all the more drinkable. If it were any heavier, it might border on being in the stout family. I would let this one warm up a bit as the flavors and aromas pull through even more. I've been sort of tired of porters for a while now, but this one really hits the mark with me. Once again, Berkshire Brewing achieves a winner. Cheers"
"If you like coffee, you'll like this beer. I think it needs a bit more body but otherwise it's a very tasty, easy to drink brew."
"Big coffee aroma dominates with hints of roasted malt buttressing the aroma signature. If you like coffee this smells great. Dark brown to flat black with a nicely clinging/lacing thumb thick tan head that is mostly lasting. Fore is coffee galore with some mild sweet cream/malt....matching roasted malt and a smooth roasty finish. Simple, but tasty and fun to drink. Thanks to Jason at Knightly Spirits in Orlando."
"On tap at Bukowski's. Inky dark with a thick tan head. Served too cold...needed to let this set for more than a few minutes before the true flavors came out. Aromas of dark roasted malt and fresh coffee. Maybe a burned caramel sweetness. Flavor was initially dark and roasted sugary sweet. ""Oaty"" coffee finish. Somewhat over-carbonted. Finish was dry and laden with coffee. Medium body...expected a fuller mouthfeel. Still, it was quite drinkable."
"Smell was of coffee of course, with some alcohol undertones. The taste was again coffee and had a slight bitterness to it. I do have to say that this is one of the most balanced coffee beers I've ever had. It is a ""coffee"" porter, but it is extremely well done. I drink a lot of coffee stouts and sometimes the coffee is overbearing and takes over the drink. Not in this one. The coffee is blended very well. This is a very good porter. I just wish some stout brewers would take note of this and harmonize the coffee in their stouts with the rest of the ingredients the way Berkshire has accomplished it in this porter. Highly recommend, more than worth the effort of finding."
"Had this one again recently and enjoyed it even more than the last time."
"D: I think I could drink this beer as often as some people drink coffee. This is just a tasty, easy-drinking, enjoyable beer. It's also the type of beer that could be a pounder or a sipper."
"Nice porter, a very drinkable beer, I highly reccomend this beer."
"Poured very dark, almost black, with a creamy tan head that lingered well, leaving behind nice lacing as I enjoyed this brew from BBC. Aroma is of, surprise, coffee! As well as chocolate, roasty malts...very raosty. The initial taste was a big coffee flavor, then comes the very roasty maltiness, dark chocolate (somehwat bitter) but then ends slightly dry. Not much of a finish to speak of, at all. Mouthfeel is mildly oily, slippery, medium bodied, and not too carbonated at all. I would chalk this one up as very drinkable. Excellent offering from BBC."
"Cheers!"
"Coffee and beer, pretty much the only things I ever drink (and H2O, but obviously both have plenty in them). This pours dark and thick. The aroma is very expresso, a hint of caramel and smokiness. Not much indicated this is a beer. The flavor delivers that nicely. A hop kick bursts through the coffee and sweetness. It rounds out the intense flavors. The creamy goodness went down extremely quick. I wish I could get more of this on my coast."
"Appearance is a very dark brown, with about a quarter inch of foam at the top. Lasting head with a burgundy tint. The most evident aroma is of chocolate covered espresso beans. Tastes are roasted coffee and a mix of sweet dark chocolate and bitter baking chocolate. Smooth, yet heavy mouth feel -- like sipping a high-quality espresso drink. So drinkable, I think it could replace my morning cup of Deans Beans! Its definitely more enjoyable than an iced coffee would be on this hot summer day, which is saying a lot for a heavy porter. I love this beer!"
"A terrific dessert beer."
"Poured a dark brown with yeast floating throughout that leaves a thin tan head that disappears quickly. The smell is chocolate, bittersweet cocoa, espresso, and some vanilla bean. The taste is surprisingly like a milk stout, it mirrors the nose with a vanilla wafer crisp taste complimented by a bitter espresso hop bite upfront that is fantasticly smooth. This is another top notch brew from the BBC."
"D - high for those who like the coffee taste in their porters/stouts, otherwise it may be a bit sharp"
"A hoppily aggressive Porter with a ton of fresh coffee beans and nutty profile. My favorite BBC offering to date. I'd gladly grab a growler of this tasty brew."
"I could drink a few of these!"
"Cheers!"
"D- another highly drinkable offering from the boys in south deerfield"
"A tasty brew that is very drinkable, I just wish it had a little more staying power and was slightly more robust. But I guess that would change the style to a robust porter."
"Drinkability: Goes down sooo easy for a porter... very impressive."
"This is my first Berkshire Brewing Company beer and it's an absolute doozy. Since I'm not a coffee lover/drinker, I sometimes feel as though I'm not giving coffee-added beer a fair shake. No problem here though. I'm able to recognize wonderful beer when I drink it and Coffeehouse Porter is unquestionably wonderful beer. Thanks to MuddyFeet for the bomber."
"Fairly creamy body, though it is still on the thin side of creamy. A very nice porter. I would drink this often if it were available in my area."
"Dr: High. This porter is silky smooth, thin bodied and full of flavor."
"Drinkability: Couldn't have this one all night long but 20oz or so would be just fine."
"Mouthfeel is slightly thin with the bitterness winning out over the creamy coffee richness."
"Thanks to ppoitras for this beer as part of Secret Santa '05. Coffee in porter is something I very much want to play with in my homebrewing (though I haven't yet). This is good, but it seems like it just doesn't compliment the subtle porter character but instead dominates it. Still, fairly enjoyable and I'd give this one a try again."
"Disappointingly thin body -- watery. Disappointingly simple flavor, surprisingly similar to iced coffee, really. I wouldn't recommend this beer. I don't know them, but I know there are better coffee-themed beers out there. That said, my girlfriend's sister, who is completely indifferent to beer quite liked this one. I guess that says something. I don't agree with Jason's 1998 comment that BBC should stay away from porters, though, because I quite enjoyed their Drayman's porter."
"The taste is great, very smooth....the coffee doesn't come to the fore immediately which is pretty cool. The hop notes are pleasant and not sharp...they accentuate the coffee bitterness which is the way it should be for this style. Good to the last drop of the 22 oz bottle for sure."
"Ahh, this is such a quintessential beer for the snowy season. Nice carbonation and a big head tops off the dark brown ale. Not much light squeaking through. Roasted malt is the main attraction here for sure. A super rich beer, creamy and frothy, with lots of roasty, chocolate, nutty undertones. The coffee beans definately play a large part in this beer, but does not steal the show. I like how this beer remains balanced while it includes such a strong ingredient. Hop profile is slightly spicy and adds a nice bitterness, although a good deal of the bitterness comes from the burnt malt tastes. Excellent smooth mouthfeel. A nice, warming, fireside beer for cold weather."
"Overall an excellent porter. I'd drink it again... soon I hope."
"I have to admit, I am not a coffee drinker at all. Love the aroma of it, hate the taste. But this beer was very enjoyable. A little lighter in body than you're average porter, but still delicious. Recommended to coffee and non-coffee drinkers alike."
"Had this at Bukowski's, Boston on tap. Pours a black with a caramel/tannish head. Leaves great lace down the glass. Smells like coffee, tastes roasted malty, coffee, chocolatly, but is very drinkable. Mouthfeel is also good. Not much of a bitter end."
"Drinkability is decent not great. Actually was expecting more richer body and stronger coffee flavors. Thank goes to B&G BIF from goodbyeohio."
"A coffee lovers porter. It gets better as it warms balancing out the strong coffee with more of a ""traditional"" porter flavor. Definately worth a try."
"A good dessert/breakfast beer. Nice and satisfying."
"Thanks to goodbyeohio for the trade. For a guy who cant stand coffee I sure like it in beer. Very dark brown color with a medium thick and foamy dark beige head. Thick lacing that doesnt move much. Strong roasted coffee aroma with a nice dark malt undertone. Medium-bodied with a tasty bitter coffee flavor. Strong roasty character with some sweet malt and smoke. The finish is pretty soft but retains some coffee bitterness. Overall a pretty enjoyable brew."
"poured into a glass, really nice chocolatey head....the smell is really amazing. the taste is great, initially, almost perfect....after-taste quite good, but perhaps just a little bit too sweet. overall: GREAT, the only possible minor criticism I have is the sweetness"
"well said and worth repeating. agreed."
"Mmmmm...coffee beer. Deep mahogany with amber hues, thin ivory tan lace lingering atop. Obviously some coffee in the nose, with hints of caramel and burnt wood. I drink my coffee black, so I enjoy the flavor on this one. Has some lingering dark fruit flavors as well, notably cherry, to balance the bitter black coffee and the astringent hops in the finish. Black, burnt, and malty. Has an odd plasticy thing going on too, which is off. But otherwise quite good. Smooth and rather creamy. Niiice."
"Bottle courtesy of MuddyFeet."
"The alcohol is never noticeable; and it delivers and impressive balance of coffee flavors, roastiness, and underlying bitterness. Very nice!"
"Thanks Pete!"
"poured with a foamy tan head with a dark dark brown black color, transparent. dry roasted grain with some coffee in the aroma. a well brewed and balanced porter, nice combination of flavors. definete coffee aftertaste, just a nice porter and very smooth at that."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slick with an active carbonation. A notch down on the carbonation would make this smoother. I find myself finishing this bomber quite rapidly...a tasty porter for those who enjoy coffee as well. Definetly one worth looking into. Thanks to MuddyFeet for this one."
"Second review...Appearance is dark choclolate brown, small head but great lacing quality. Smell is a beautiful coffee and malt with the taste following with just the right carbonation. A rich flavor, but the mouthfeel enhances it more...dry, almost a tad light...very good for a 6.2 abv. Extremely easy to drink...smooth, but with enough carbonation to fight off any oily quality."
"Pours pretty. A nice tall head that becomes a nice lattice in a couple of minutes. Looks black against a white wall, mahogany when held up to a bare lightbulb. Smells like coffee, a little bitter at first with carmel to follow almost instantly, and hints of a dry red wine. Coffee scent remains bitter and carries into the taste. I like the robustness of the coffee and am not sure how to have that without having the coffee step on the other flavors. Taste is coffee, carmel, more coffee, and finishes with a dry red wine, coffee, and carmel liqoirice(?) taste when sipped or in small mouthfuls. Tastes and feels nice. A good tug looses some of the flavor and you get sort of a stale coffee aftertaste. Sort of... it is a very enjoyable beer."
"A nice mouthfeel, this one coats the tongue and warms on the way down. A very good example of a coffee beer. I'm very glad that I had a chance to try this one."
"Mouthfeel is medium-heavy and creamy, making it very drinkable. One of the better coffee-beer blends that I've tried, I quaffed a whole bomber without much effort. Thanks to ppoitras for this sample."
"A clean dark brown beer with ruby highlights. Has a big bubbly brown head. The aroma is coffee... real coffee. With a hint of malt sweetness in the background. Taste... Have you ever eaten a chocolate covered esspresso bean. Well it's not called coffee house porter for nothing. I have had many beers touting coffee character. This is the real deal. This is as close to a shot glass of esspresso dropped into a glass of porter as you can get in a brewed beer. Yes this is also one of my favorite brews and a top fav from this brewery."
"Beer is good. Happy coffee beering."
"Drinkability is good. Coffee notes overpower to some extent but a very solid drinking brew. Had to fight my wife off to get my far share of this bomber."
"Very nice. Another lovely selection by the Beer Wheel."
"Overall, this beer is pretty smooth with that creamy BBC touch that I really like. This is a nice porter."
"Pours a deep brown color with a fluffy head that leaves a nice lace. Aromas are a mix of expressos and coffees with hints of chocolate, dark fruits and a slight tone of smoke. Flavors start off initially smokey with bits of coffee and expresso. There is an underlining flavor of chocolate with a nice sweetness and almost vanilla like tone that lingers throughout the brew. The finish has a nice molasses flavor following with some more powerful coffee tones and a slight bitter finish that rounds things out but keeps it very drinkable. The mouthfeel to this brew was nicely creamy and medium bodied which led to this being very very drinkable. A fine example of a porter."
"Okay, coffee is not my thing, but this beer isn't flawed in any way. I'd predict that if you enjoy fresh ground coffee, you'll enjoy this beer very much."
"On tap at Bukowski's. Pours a very dark brown with a heavy, dirty tan head. Served a little too cold, so I let it warm for a bit. Smells of light roasted coffee, semi-sweetish malt aromas, with a little homebrew twang. I wish it had a stronger coffee aroma. Tastes of roasted bitter coffee throughout. Meaty, semi-sweet chocolatey malt underneath. Finish is bittersweet. Medium-bodied, with a creamy feel. Nice beer, but I'm not sure how clean the tap was!"
"Tastes like carbonated, alcoholic coffee; all with a smooth, malty finish. It pours a very heavy, pitch black color. A nice thick, creamy head formed on the beer, and lace coated the entire inside of the glass. The aroma is of chocolate covered coffee beans (hmmm, a favorite). The flavor is heavy Colombian coffee, thick and rich. The alcohol is present, but is hidden way behind the coffee. Matls and chocolate also come through. I want to say hops are present, but they are hiding out of fear of the coffee. The mouthfeel is heavy. Also, kind of like real coffee, I am not sure my stomach can handle more than a couple of bottle of this stuff, just way to rich and acidic from the coffee."
"Comments  What to send your Seattle BA Buddy? Why, coffee beer, of course. Thanks to Carmen for this welcome and thoughtful gift."
"Need you ask this is one drinkable brew. Divine."
"Godly pillow of full-on root beer float goodness calls for me to lay my head on it, an eternal sleep awaits. Pitch black hue, cant see a thing. Coffee/toffee roast on nose immediately with a resonating huskiness of flaked oat. Big mocha and coffee blast is excellent, savory on the mouth, with chocolate and roasted malts in a meaty background. Trailing roasted characters, combined with a medium body and the coffee undertone lead to a highly drinkable brew."
"All in all, the range and strength of flavor, combined with the smoothness, makes for a winner in my book of warm winter brews."
"A very good bew but couldnt not have more than one in a sitting...great with a chocolate desert or perhaps a dark flavored ice cream...all in all a very nice brew...especially to sip on after dinner"
"On-Tap at Redbone in Somerville (Boston). This is a dark brown/near black brew with a nice head of espresso-coloured foam that lasts. The aromas are of COFFEE, as well as roasted malts, chocolate, and a bit of hops. The taste is very espresso-like up front with some nice roasted malt notes in the middle anda very coffee/chocolate like finish. The mouthfeel was creamy and smooth as all hell and the drinkability was damn good as well. One of the best coffee beers I have had. Excellent stuff."
"Tastes like coffee, no surprise here. Surprisingly easy to drink and very smooth. I'll order this one again in the near future. Nice Fall beer, well worth a try."
"Can't thank ppoitras and BIF 11 enough for this one!!!!"
"NIce tasting porter very unique with the strong coffee flavor. They actually put coffee extract into this brew. Strong espresso smell followed by nice roasted malt scent. Very smooth and tasty. Very dark brown almost black color had a nice head tanish cream left a nice lacing in the glass. I enjoy a strong flavored beer and this was a great choice. Almost reminded me of a stout but much lighter. Really easy to drink and very enjoyable. I would have this beer any day of the week."
"It's amazing how one's tastes can change over time. Only a few years later, and although Imperial IPA is still my favorite style, Dark Lord has won me over to stouts. It no longer surprises me that there are so many stouts in the top 100."
"Wow. Great beer. Very dark in appearance with a great aroma to boot. If you like coffee and beer, this is a marriage made in heaven. The taste is perfect and the mouthfeel is well above average. It might be difficult to drink many of these, though I have never tried more than 2 at a sitting. If you have the chance to try it, don't miss the opportunity."
"Overall: I was pleasantly surprised as I wasn't expecting such a good beer. Very good blend of a traditional porter and robust black coffee. Anyone who likes coffee but was scared off by Bell's offering should try this one. You will not be disappointed."
"This gorgeous beer was a deep, translucent brown with a tan head. The aroma was dominated by coffee notes, as was the flavor. This was a nice full-bodied porter, but it sacrificed the complexity for the rich coffee flavor. It was good, but I was hoping for something along the lines of Bell's Java Stout, which has a strong coffee component but also has some other flavors to maintain interest."
"Basically it is what it says. A coffee flavored porter. Its not a bad beer by any means, but when I taste a coffee flavored beer Im expecting Starbucks or better, this is like Maxwell house instant."
"22oz Bomber Best Before June'04 Deep dark brown with some faint light coming through at the edges. Nice foamy head that seems to be lasting awhile. Aroma of dark roasted coffee some roasted malt and a slight hop presence. Mouthfeel is medium and finishes a bit dry. Overall not a bad porter."
"Full bodied and smooth, light coffee like bitterness. For this black coffee drinker, it's a favorite. If you're not a coffee drinker (and I mean coffee, not sugar and cream with a touch of the black stuff) then you probably won't like."
"Had this brew while visiting the Tavern at Old Sturbridge. Must say that on a cold snowy evening this porter was fantastic. The color was a deep brown almost black with a nice light brown head. The taste was of coffee with mild hints of chocolate. Medium full to full bodied beer with low carbination is aptly named. It is a brew that is excellent for those cold winter nights. Hope to be able to track more down in the Albany area!"
"Interesting brew. On the one hand very aggressive taste and appearance, although I'm not sure yet about the after taste. While the drying aspect is ok, there is some bitterness which is not normally my favorite thing. Despite this good brew. I will picking up another bomber to reassess."
"Overall a nice Porter that is aptly named. And like that cup of joe in the morning this porter becomes addictive the more you drink it. Somehow the thin body seems to work very well with the very coffee taste profile."
"These folks make very good beer. I enjoy them a lot. I enjoy stouts, and I enjoyed this beer as much as I have any other stouts. Lighter than most I have tried. I could drink several (22-ouncers) of these."
"This was a nice little pick-me-up during the W. Mass. Brew Tour, although we sampled in plastic glasses. Pours...you guessed it; black coffee with a light tan head and some sticky lace. The aroma is, of course, mostly coffee, with some malt and hops. A substantial caramel sweet malt body and abundantly hopped with fairly sharp spicy and mild citrus bitterness. Chocolate notes and a hint of camphor astringency. This is a highly gulpable brew!"
"This porter poured a black color with good brown foam. The smell was coffee and malt and cocoa. The taste was coffee, sweet malt, cocoa. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy. The body was medium-full with modest carbonation. This was a very nice coffee porter. The more I drink this beer, the more I love it. Very consistent, very easy to drink!"
"Thanks to BigDeb for this Caffieneious offering."
"Not being a fan of coffee i was alittle reluctant to try this.I bought it in a 22oz brown bottle to be sampled with friends.The coffee flavor wasnt noticable until the 3rd taste but seemed not to stay.It was thick and creamy with a decent head.The two coffee drinkers i sampled it with loved it.I think it is a taste to be acquired."
"Pours an opaque black; tan head, not very sticky. Cappuccino and chocolate aromas. Slick, creamy mouthfeel; doesn't have the tendency to dry out the mouth the way many stout and porters seem to. More robust coffee and chocolate in the taste with some caramel maltiness. Hop presence isn't overt but keeps the sweetness in check. Not a particularly complex ale, pretty straightforward, but very tasty and ridiculously drinkable for a porter."
"Pours very black with only the barest hints of light getting in around the edge with a nice big, creamy tan head that subsides too quickly but does leave a nice lace behind.  Great bitter, roasted coffee aroma along with some nice roasted/burnt malt smells make this one very appetizing.  The brew starts off with some nice chocolate tastes that overpower the coffee to start with but gently yield to it as the brew tails off the tongue and leaves a nice bitter coffee/burnt/roasted flavor on the tongue.  This brew is a little thin for the style but still remains very drinkable and is definitely something I would try again."
"750ml brown bottle with two brewers clanking pint glasses and the ""Dean's Beans"" logo smack in the middle. Clear freshness date. Very dark, nearly all black with a beige smooth head. Black malt and ""cold coffee ground"" aromas. Extremely creamy and smooth. Slight taste of earth and some definite coffee flavours that leave a ""day old coffee"" aftertaste -- not very pleasant at all. The malt tries to come through but is murdered by the Dean's Beans. Their cries unheard in the blackness of it all. Reminds us of waking up late and not having time to make fresh coffee so you microwave what's in the pot from the previous day and are surprised by a pretty harsh cup of joe. Perhaps Berkshire should stay away from Porters, especially coffee ones."
"More coffee than beer this one is.  Has a nice head to it.  Even the aroma is almost pure java.  A little too robust even for a robust style."
