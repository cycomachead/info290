"The sum is better than its parts.  Can't explain how easy this is to drink.  You'd never believe it was a sipper if you didn't read the bottle first.  Could easily pass for a drink for kids."
""
""
""
""
""
"The cherries tie in a nice subtle sourness that how well with the rich deep malts. Unique an delicious."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good sweet stout (very sweet!) and a great dessert beer. Since the cherry is a little over-the-top, find someone (or a few people) to share it with."

"Poured from bomber into tulip during #bottlecherwednesdays at Beachwood BBQ. Nearly black in color with brown highlights at the edges and a tan head. Smell is cocoa, roast coffee, medicinal cherry, and hints of booze. Taste is sweet chocolate and toffee, followed by hop, coffee, and tart cherry bitterness. Medium body, creamy texture, moderate carbonation, semi-dry finish."
""
""
"O: A very, very good beer. Personally not a big fan of the cherry, but would drink again if it were a tad cheaper—I paid $16.99 for this bomber."
""
""
""
""
""
"Lots of bitter chocolate, some cocoa, dark fruits and almonds. Super dry. Not sure if there is supposed to be sour cherries in this but I don't taste any sourness. Very smooth, low carb, short finish. More dark fruit flavor started to come out as it warmed considerably."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  A nice twist on an already great beer.  faantastic flavors and the cherry is subtle instead of being over the top.  If you like imperial biscotti break there's no reason you shouldn't enjoy this beer."

"OVERALL/DRINKABILITY - I don't like Evil Twin.  They make silly stunt beers.  Just not for me."
""
"O: this is damn good surprised how well the cherry compliments the chocolate roast most fruit beers the fruit tastes on a sickly cough syrup quality this is damn good very impressive."
""
""
"Overall:  Wow!  What a beer!  Strong, massive, awesome, flavors of roasted malt, dark chocolate, sour cherries, a touch of coffee, vanilla and almonds!  Delicious!!"
""
""

"Overall a stellar beer - I have had Imperial doughnut and that was too sweet for me, but this was just bang on.  very balanced.  Haven't had the regular yet, but I have a bomber, and if this is what I have to look forward to, then I am really excited for more!"
""
"Pours black not much of the foamy stuff. Nose is is chocolate espresso fruits. Tastes like a dark chocolate-covered cherry. Feel is somewhat creamy medium. Overall, good. But I'd rather the regular better."
"22 oz. bottle from Wed., 12/31/2014 (Niciu 3rd Annual NYE Party) shared by Mr. Richard Hartogs of Better Beer Authority lore, unknown brewing/packaging dates, poured into plastic cup, drank over ~30 minutes"
""
"22oz. bottle served in a tulip.  Pours one shade darker than cola with a loose, 1/8th inch mocha-colored head that quickly disperses towards the shoulders.  Only spots of lacing are present during the tasting.  Nose is roasty and chocolatey with a suggestion of lactose and cherry sucrets and a faint metallic quality.  Taste follows nose - fortunately, the cherry notes are less medicinal and the metallic character present in the nose is no longer present.   There's also a nice cocoa quality to the flavor profile.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a mild carbonation, a light acidity and a slightly oily texture.  Overall, a decent imperial porter, but not worth the price point.  Not something I would recommend for extended cellaring."
""
""
"Enjoyed from the 22 oz bottle, this interesting ""porter"" pours a thick blackish brown with a thin dark brown head that dissipates to a thin ring and spotty lacing.  Nose of fresh black coffee, rich dark tart pie cherries, chocolate, and dark roasted malts.  Flavors follow the nose with chocolate and coffee on all sides, some crème brulee qualities on the back blending with tart cherries.  Smooth, slick, and creamy with mild carbonation that has a light souring on the aftertaste.  I loved the doughnut which was a milestone for me personally, this one is solid, yet it is hard to beat the doughnut break."
""
""
""
"I don't know if this keg was mislabeled or something but I am not getting a lot of the flavors other reviewers are getting from this beer. It tastes like just a pretty decent roasty porter with a light sour cherry on the finish. Didn't really get any vanilla or anything resembling a biscotti flavor, glad I didn't buy an expensive bottle of this at a shop somewhere."
""
""
""
""
"Great beer. Pours a nice thick consistency that's dark as oil. Little to no head. Tastes a bit bitter, but it's complimented by the sweetness of the beer. Great mouth feel. Medium carbonation. Overall awesome beer."

"Tasty on a cold night by the fire."
""
"Overall: A good sipper whose alcohol isn't apparent and made more quenching by restrained sweetness and cherry tartness. Typical roasted coffee flavors take a back seat to some interesting chocolate notes."

"O: An exceptional beer. Very delicious with an interesting mix of flavors. Definitely worth checking out."

""
""
"O-This is one of those beers that I don't actually like very much, but I have to give high scores because it is well made and tastes like it should taste. The looks and mouthfeel are impressive, in particular, but I just don't really dig the flavors of this beer. I recall have having the same reaction to regular Biscotti Break. The cherries add some complexity, but I don't think they make it better. Oh well."
""
"Medium to full bodied with mild carbonation. I can't believe the beer is 11.5 % abv. There is no detectable alcohol in the taste or the aroma. That is a sign of a well made beer."
""

"this is a nice twist on the original biscotti break, with the cherries added. they do a nice job of picking up on the dark chocolate notes in the malt, and of giving the finish a little tang. very michigan cherry, tart and sweet at the same time, dark red, and perfect for the richness of this brew. nutty and dark like it always is, the cherries add a little fruitiness to the nose that makes this distinct. the booze seems a little more exposed aromatically than i remember it being in the base beer, but it seems appropriate this time of year. the cherries are an accent in the flavor, still well behind the memorable almond milky dark chocolate roasty boozy viscous semisweet base beer, but they add quite a bit to the finish, where the body of the beer seems to get a little thinner (which i welcome), and which seems to get more amplified as the beer warms up. definitely appropriate for the holidays, but share this one, there is a lot of beer in this bottle!"

"Let's be real here; this is a good beer. But at the end of the day, some people are black coffee drinkers while others are a teaspoon of sugar and a liter of cream. And in the perfectly fine bad boy that is Biscotti Break, someone poured in a heavy dose of Paula Dean shitty creamer. Again, Raul knows that there is a good beer here, and for those that like sweet Porters, Raul says, hooray! But for the main man, meh."
"O – Good, but I wish it kept the more forward almond, biscuity flavors of the base Imperial Biscotti Break.  I also would like more of the cherry flavor present, since that is the namesake of the beer.  Still, a solid Evil Twin stout, and that means it’s pretty good."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Another stellar offering for the cold holiday season.  Would pair well with a cigar, or as an after dinner settler."

"22oz bottle. Pours a pitch black color with very little head. Some lacing. A lot going on in the aroma here. Coffee, chocolate, dark cherries, caramel, roasted malts, and cookies. Sweet and boozey. The taste is chocolate and coffee at first followed by dark cherries and some sweet cookies. Cocoa powder, roasted malts, and a touch of nuts. Very sweet, as expected. Finishes with the coffee and cherry flavor with some nutty cookies. Fairly big alcohol presence. Very little carbonation. I liked Imperial Biscotti Break alot and Doughnut Break not as much. This one lies somewhere in between the two. Overall, sweet and boozey Imperial Porter who's price tag may stop me from buying it again."

"Nice big robust stout, chock full of good flavors... Cherry and Coffee play leaf roles as nut and chocolate support the cast. It never gets too sweet and finishes just great at 11.5%. Really I don't gloat to often for any one thing. I would be doing a dis service to not drive home how easy it is to drink at such a huge ABV. Very light and velvety feel. Only real knock is the bitterness which is a tad excessive. Otherwise a danm fine brew~"

"Tasty with lots of cherry.  I regret not having had the regular Biscotti Break for comparison.  The cherry seems to hide most of the base flavor.  But I certainly enjoyed it  The alcohol is very well hidden."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel was thin and watery, with mild carbonation, a chewy, thick body and a slightly bitter sweet finish that had a light tart nip. It trails off more like a burnt coffee than a porter or stout and overall was a great beer, a sipper to savor to try to maximize the flavors."
""
""
"O- for a porter, this one is loaded with flavor and super drinkable, given the ABV.  The cherry addition is subtle, but compliments the chocolate/coffee flavors nicely.  While it doesn't match up to the aroma of regular IBB, the flavor is just as complex.  Very well done.   4.5"

"The beer is a deep dark brown, nearing black, with an oily beige head that clings to the walls of the snifter. Aromas of roast, chocolate, coffee, cherry, fudge, dark fruit. Less of the biscotti comes through in this version. Cherry character with a robust malt profile. Thick and rich with a healthy amount of chocolate. Cherry sweetness with chocolates, like a gourmet candy bar. Not up to the level of Imperial Biscotti Break. Still, tasty."
""
""
""

"Very nice beer, even if the flavors are a little different. My overall take here is of dry Scandanavian licorice complemented by cherries- which my wife thinks is a bit like cough syrup, but I like. Don't get her wrong, she doesn't mean overly sweet and medicinal, just that the licorice and cherry combo reminds her of those flavors. Not me, and everything mellows and harmonizes a bit as the beer opens up as it breathes. It ends up becoming downright silky, with a persistent fruity cherry background and roasty licorice and malt notes throughout. Quite pleasant."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours dense pitch black color with a 2 finger dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, tart cherry, toast, dark bread, fudge, vanilla, light nuttiness, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and light-moderate tart cherry notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, fudge, toast, dark bread, vanilla, light nuttiness, light tart cherry, and roasted earthiness. Light cherry tartness/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, fudge, toast, dark bread, vanilla, light nuttiness, light tart cherry, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and light-moderate tart cherry flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial coffee porter! All around great complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and light-moderate cherry flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
"Overall: Man really disappointed here. Is Imperial Biscotti Break even the base beer here? My expectations were a rich sweet dessert beer which the front delivered, but the finish killed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O: Overall, its good, but it doesnt have that magical perfect combination of flavors that the regular IBB has. If anything the cherry takes away from the other components. This is one case in which I certainly prefer the base beer over the variant. Still very much worth a try though."

"Although this beer was good, it was a little too sweet for me. The cherry flavor was noticeable and was nice and tart but there was an underlying sweetness that was too much and almost ""artificial"" tasting. I liked this beer but wouldn't seek it out again."
""
"I thought adding cherries to Imperial Biscotti Break would make it even more of a beast, but this variation is surprisingly easy to drink. Rich malts, with chocolate, and lots of cherry. But as much as I enjoy cherry, I think the original is more remarkable."
"The tart cherry addition distracts from a great base beer."

"The vanilla and cherry and off-balanced bitter roast notes put this is my least fave of the biscotti I've tried. Great beer, but great competition."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is outstanding. The base coffee stout is already delicious, and the added cherry is there just enough to add to the brew. Cherry can be a tricky flavor, but this is nicely done and not overwhelming."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer drinks a little more than an American Double/Imperial Stout compared to an American Porter given its fuller body and richness of the flavors but is still extremely easy to drink considering its strength as it hides its alcohol very well."
""
""
""
""
"This is an excellent imperial porter. It hits every wicket; it's balanced; it doesn't overemphasize any particular flavor. I think a little more cherry would help differentiate it more, but it's very good. Try a bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Now that its warmed a bit I'm smelling mostly black coffee, anise, a little sourness, and alcohol. My first sip had some pretty noticeable cherry, but since then its been kind of off and on, and still never really as strong as that first taste. I'm getting some coconut now that its warmed up, more alcohol, tiny bit of tartness, some dark fruit, hint of smoke. Pretty ashy/roasty finish with a touch of bitterness that's gone quickly. I think this is one of the few strong dark beers that is better colder."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very disappointed."
""
"Poor lighting but very dark, likely dark brown to nearly black. Some laces. Major notes of dark roasted malts, some hops and dry fruit. The taste follows the nose with similar characteristics with some bitter smoke/char. Very smooth for the malt/hop profile. Very nice and highly recommended. The cherries are a little muted."

"O. An interesting Take on the style. If the cherry was more prominent and tasted more natural (ex. New glarus offerings) it would be even better."
""
"O: It’s not often that I’m really impressed with a beer – especially one that has this kind of reputation behind it – but this is something noteworthy. A warm, dark, outstanding ale!"

"Poured into a Reuben's Brew snifter. Pours a very dark, nearly opaque mahogany brown with a half finger fine light brown head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of toasted malt and chocolate with hints of vanilla, very similar to the regular Biscotti Break. Flavor is sweet toasted malt, mild chocolate, vanilla and a perfect light touch of cherry juice in the finish with has a slight hop bitterness. Medium bodied with a pleasant creaminess; nice mouth feel. The Biscotti Break family of porter/stouts has been consistently great tasting and this one keep up the tradition. I had some trepidation with this variant because I'm not a fan of sour flavors in stouts or porters, but other than a mild and well supported tartness, the cherry in this was well balanced by the chocolate flavors. Impossibly well covered ABV, requiring careful sipping because this is as tasty, but not as cloying as a chocolate covered cherry."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A good beer, but falls way short of the regular Imperial Biscotti Break. Worth a try if you see it, but not worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-loved the combo of flavors in this stout, cherries really worked well"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Interesting variant. Sours cherries certainly add some complexity. Flavors are still pretty balanced. Tartness helps counter the sweetness a bit too. Having said that, I really don't feel like it's an improvement overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall good but not great, very little cherry, even seems to have detracted from the original."
""
""
""
"O - Overall I was quite underwhelmed by this beer. Really felt it was a syrup step back from the great base beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I didn't know what to expect but this was good. Buddy of mine poured from a larger bottle. I always forget the size - just never large enough generally. This poured a nice dark color with small head and medium carbonation. The chocolate lay malt smell hits you right away and the taste follows through. But it is the cherries that work- it is mild and not overwhelming and makes this stand out. This was a surprise as I generally hate cherries but it works here - perhaps they are only meant to mix with beer. I also have that in common. Two thumbs up for a unique beer that is very good"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D - The base works really well with the cherry flavour. Too easy to drink and seems pretty well put together."

"O - This was disappointing after how good the regular Biscotti Break was. Overly sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A great stout."
"Mouthfeel is very nice- full bodied, well carbonated. I love evil twin; I love imperial biscottiw break; Natale is just not quite as good as bourbon barrel but still awesome. Everything works better when this is warmer."
""
""
""
"O - Sweet and heavy, hint of cherry, could be more."
""
"I'm not really sure what was done with this beer, but the cherry infusion really takes away from the taste, body, and overall togetherness of the beer. This just isn't a very good version of this beer."
""
""
""
"I enjoyed this version more than the original. The addition of cherry, while subtle in the flavor and aroma, seems to perfectly balance the bitter notes of cocoa and black coffee in the base beer."
""
""
""
"O: the original was better, IMO, but I must say I was pleasantly surprised with this beer. The sour was more of a compliment than a whole new component that barges in and takes over the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: Worth the purchase if you're into bigger beers, but not if you're just coming for the flavor addition."
""
"This is a little more of a departure from the original Imperial Biscotti Break than the name might imply but still really tasty. I don't think I'm alone in trusting Evil Twin and Westbrook (where this was brewed) when it comes to stouts and this further confirms that my faith is well-founded. All around excellent. I suspect the flavor profile will fade with age so get it while it's fresh! I'll be enjoying my other bottle in the near future."
""
""
""
"O - Overall, I like regular biscotti break way better than this one as the cherry makes this slightly metallic and tart. The cherry just doesn't seem to fit in here well at all."
""
""
"O- very enjoyable beer."

" The taste is great is is thick but not syrupy it has a fruity and roasty combination of malt and cherry with light almond-like nuttiness and subtle cocoa with mild burnt malt and light alcohol in the finish. Overall I was pleased to try this and would recommend it to those who enjoy a big malty roasty ale, it is sweet but the cherry adds more in the way of acidity than pure sweet fruit it is drinkable, almost dangerously drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is great. Creamy heavy body works well with mild carbonation to give this a smooth rich feel."

"(O)- It is just so sweet. A bit hot too. Definitely an enjoyable one to try, but probably one and done for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a phenomenal stout but even more a fabulous beer, and I guess I'm a tad disappointed there was no cherries to be found but who cares when you love it this much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - not a bad porter. Shade boozy for the style, but nice complexity and mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Having just re-visited the IBB last night, I am amazed at how different this beer tastes (and I note that it is called an Imperial Porter rather than an Imperial Stout); this beer hides the alcohol much better, has more complexity and I just love the cherry on top"
""
"T: Coffee and rich dark chocolate notes meld with a sweet and almost sticky cherry note. Hints of nuttiness, baking chocolate, just a hint of booze and a lot of cherry. Finish has some burnt brownies and intensely dark chocolate bitterness. I enjoyed this one, but to me, it's nowhere near as good as the original."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This was a lovely beer -- very smooth. It was beautiful in the glass -- dark, with a rich, light brown head. I smelled the cherries, and tasted them too at first. However, I wouldn't characterize them as ""sour"" cherries. They weren't sweet either -- they were just ""there."" Overall, the taste/smell of the cherries was very subtle -- just enough to counteract the beer's roasty bitterness (an excellent quality for someone like me who has a low bitterness tolerance). Very enjoyable. That said, as I progressed through the beer, the cherry taste diminished (almost entirely by the end), and the roasty bitterness took over. It was very good, but I let RichardMNixon have the last sip."
""
""
""
""
"This really is an exceptional beer. It actually is better than the regular version. The cherry is a beautiful compliment to this sweet and luscious beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a really great beer, but a hard one to put into words in a review as all the flavors just seem to meld with one another. Not really better than the original, but definatly not worse either."
""
""
""
""
""
"Post-script: D'oh! Turns out this IS a different base beer. Listed as an ""imperial porter"" instead, that explains the light-bodied feel. Still a pretty good beer overall, if only a bit underwhelming for the the price of a bomber."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A most excellent IBB variation."
""
""
""
"o - Overall I compared this a lot to IBB as that is easy to find and cheaper and honestly, it is also better. Don't get me wrong, this is a good beer, but IMO it doesn't smell as good and the mouthfeel is not as great as the IBB. Splitting hairs on two great beers here, but considering the money I dished out for this, I would definitely go with the normal IBB next time."
""
""
"Overall - Not an improvement on Biscotti Break. Disappointing, but decent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Man, these guys have outdone themselves with this one. Very nice. Great example of everything you want with this particular style of beer, then adding their own little twist on it. Would be really cool to put one of these away for a couple years and see what it's like."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This was a nice interesting variant but I definitely preferred the regular Imperial Biscotti Break over this. While I definitely enjoyed this, I probably wouldn't spend over $15/bomber on this again. Definitely worth the try though, just don't expect anything mind-blowing."
""
""
""
""
"O: a well-done stout, not as similar to Imperial Biscotti Break as I'd expected. Had a lighter feel and the cherry character is quite distinct. The cherry flavor was more tart than sweet, and added an intriguing element to the beer. Worth a buy."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A solid, balanced beer that's not overly sweet."
"O- Just as big and awesome as Imperial Biscotti Break. Pricey but worth the money."
"The body is huge, rich and thick, a little crisp but that giving way to smoothness, even making it a little more lush. There's a little dryness that comes in to balance everything out into a creamy sort of finish."
""
"overall very very good. I slightly prefer the regular one though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A cherry on top indeed. Very reminiscent of a chocolate covered cherry. Very tasty for a sweet stout. Very easy drinking and alcohol is masked quite well."
""
""
"Overall (4.00) - Interesting combination of flavors. The acidic and cherry combination is what makes this beer unique to me. Has a pleasant alcohol feel but the overall effect doesn't do much for me."
"Overall a very fun and enjoyable beer from Evil Twin. It's not a Bourbon County Cherry killer, but it's a much easier drinking one for sure."
""
""
""
"Excellent beer, but I'm wondering if the release of this beer is more of a marketing ploy than anything else. It really doesn't seem to taste that much different from the regular version of this beer, and while that's fine, I guess I just don't see the point."
""
""
""
"I liked this much better than the regular Imperial Biscotti Break, but not as much as the regular, which may be my favorite Evil Twin brew."
"All in all this one caught me off guard , I was up in the air if I was going to like it or not and I fell in love with it , I can't wait to try one a year from now"

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. I loved the base brew and honestly im just not digging this iteration. The cherry doesnt really stand out that much and the not so desirable attributes are characterized more so than the enjoyable parts. Strange to see a one-off with simply just a cherry addition drag the base beer down a couple levels instead of make it better. I would take the normal imperial biscotti version over this all day."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The cherries and base beer really go well together. Doesn't seem like the IBB base beer, but who knows. I liked them both."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Black with a small creamy head on top. Rich roast, an air of cherry underneath, dark chocolate, burnt sugars, and faint biscotti cookie notes. Huge, thick malty flavor: espresso, dense chocolate cake with cherry drizzle, some vanilla. The cherry is never too much, it seems more of an accent, which I appreciate very much. Pretty heavy in body, moderately carbonated, and slightly drying. No booziness to speak of. Good in small doses."

"Overall a very solid variant on a very solid beer. I've never been a huge cherry fan however this one's flavors compliment the roastiness and adds nice depth."
"This is a fairly interesting beer, not a bad beer by any means. It is not Imperial Biscotti Break, no way josé, but on its own it is a fairly interesting imperial porter. The cherries aren't really strong, but that's okay. It adds a ""cherry on top"" (har har) to the otherwise interesting Evil Twin base stout. However, it is not worth the $16 asking price, no way no how. Damn Mikeller."
"On a side note, the regular IBB is also amazing, but this had the twist that made it a 5/5 for me and that one was missing that extra added bonus to it."
"Damn I say this is mighty fine. Settle this in bourbon and you got a contender for GI Cherry. Extremely delicious and very calming with no problem finishing this myself. Actually liked this better than the recent release of Velvet Merkin at the same price. I love cherries and appreciate all brewers putting extreme pounds into the fermenting process and I want to say thank you. A winner for me and there sure is a cherry on top."

"Can there be such thing as too much complexity? While the standard Biscotti is flawless in its simplicity, the addition of cherry to the mix adds balance but it also distracts from the purity of the stout. Its a great variation that's certainly welcome in my glass, its a shame that the standard version came along first."

"O/D-A pricey buy but pretty tasty. I think carrying the same name as it's predecessor hurts it for me. I would like it better if I didn't know how good the base beer was. This is a downgrade from the normal Imperial Biscotti Break but it's still a cool brew to try."

"Overall- Good beer and solid. Slightly above average in comparison to many of the imperial stouts I've had. Worth at try but wait for it on tap. I would not splurge for the bottle."

"O - I'm a pretty big fan of IBB and love the moderate sweet with the coffee bitter. I opened this at about 51 degrees, so it wasn't like I needed it to warm up to get those cherries: ultimately, I actually had hoped it was just a bit sweeter and a bit more cherry-forward; what I'll do in the future is a side-by-side with regular IBB: that might ultimately help to discern that cherry flavor a bit more. It's a damn good beer nonetheless."
