"The smoky smell of BBQ  and jerky is too unsubtle and overpowering. This type of beer is not for everybody."
"O – An excellent smoked beer.  Lots of aroma and flavor with a solid base robust/American porter.  Very much in balance, perfect next to a campfire or with some smoky meats."
""
"There is no doubt that this is the best smoked Porter that I have ever had. Literally a perfect beer. Pours nearly black with a small layer of tan foam on the top. Smooth mouthfeel and incredible smokey taste. I'm somewhat biased as I am partial to smoked porters, but this one is hands down the best I've ever had. Beautifully balanced, it's a wonderful evening treat."

"Been collecting for awhile. 2008 2012 2013 2014. My own retirement present. Ya. That good!"
"2014  version. First pour: bomber into a tulip glass. Second pour: into a pilsener glass to try to see more (color, carbonation). Pours very dark, almost opaque black. 1.5 in thick tan head that retains nicely. Leaves thick, clinging lace as it receded. (This pilsener pour had a much larger head, that collapsed with a very nice visual effect from the bottom up.  Also, if I backlit the pilsener, I could see a very dark red color behind the front-lit black.) Smokey aroma, as expected from the name, with a faint meaty bacon or ham note. A bit of a boozy smell, even though it is only 6.5%. Pleasant aroma, but not the traditional beer-like. Smokey flavor on initial taste, with a mild bitterness lasting into the aftertaste. Thick, creamy mouth feel. Almost no carbonation visible in the tulip or in the feel.  The smoky bacon is there in the taste, but the smokiness is more subtle than I was expecting. With backlighting in the pilsener, I was able to observe light carbonation. The malt backbone of this beer is well represented, but still, the overriding taste is smoky and somewhat bitter. I would have expected more of a malt-forward taste for a porter, but I do like the taste nonetheless. I have two other bottles that my intention is to drink one per year and see how it ages. I'm looking forward to see how this very good beer changes with age."

"An American classic - what a beauty."

"Excellent taste, great aroma, and very smooth."

"Cheers -"
"Flavor varies from year to year. Over all this is the Smoked porter to which all smokes porter should aspire to."

"on tap at the brewery. get’s a couple of points for style and originality but i can’t help but think of smoked fish when i taste this beer"

"2011 Vintage. Smooth and balanced smoke, some chocolate."
""
""
""
"It's got a level of smoke that I'm looking for but the porter is a bit lacking compared to the likes of Founders or Edmund Fitzgerald."
""
""
"Red/brown colour. Smell: smoke, chocolate, bit of dryed dark fruits. Taste: same, with a touch of citrus. Guess the acidity is a result of aging (from 2012). Classic, indeed. Very recommendable."
"Yum! A mixture of smoky, creamy, chocolatey delicious goodness.  Balances out more as it warms.  This is what smoked beers are all about."
""
""
""
"Simply amazing. Smokiness is there but not overpowering and doesn't have that enormous alcohol taste of most beers you age"
""
""
""
""
""
"2012 bottle.  Liquid bacon. Some smoke, but balanced out well with the sweet malt backbone.  Pretty good."
"Tasted like a burnt hotdog, smoked taste was off putting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Russet brown, laced tan head. Surpising. Peaty malt, slightly salty oil, liquid smoke. Dissipating smoke and sweet malt. Meh"
""
"I really liked the smoked aspect of this beer. But I felt that outside of that, the beer was fairly flavorless and a little watery. I feel like that could add more richness and fullness to this beer without having to sacrifice the smokiness. Still, I don't regret purchasing this beer."
""
""
""
"almost like rib smoke flavor, bitter and smoke aftertaste"
""
""
""
""
"I am not a huge smoked porter fan but this was decent, although I think I preferred Founders Smoked Porter better."
""
""
"Overall, this is at least my standard for Smoked beers. I see its labeled as an American Porter on here, uh...okay, no worries, but this is more than just an American Porter and ages wonderfully."

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and i thought it was a very nice example of the style, it had just about everything that I look for in the style and while it was pretty heavy on the smoke it never became too much for me to handle and it still retained some nice drinkability, it was smooth, fairly crisp, a little creamy, just a little dry on the finish, not too filling and the taste did a nice job of holding my attention, one glass is a good amount for me, but if it was just me I think I could take out the whole bomber without it starting to wear on me and I think it makes for a good Winter seasonal.  What I like the most about this beer was how true to style it was, it was just what i expect from the style and no aspect seemed out of place.  What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I disliked or would change.  I would buy this beer again, especially if I'm in the mood for a smoked dark beer and i would recommend it to anyone who likes the style, if you like Smoked beers this is pretty much a must try.  All in all I was happy with this beer and just a little impressive, I see why this is one of the most popular American Smoked beers, it just does a good job of delivering the smoke with a nice Porter showing up in the background.  So far this is my new favorite beer From this brewery and i think it's one of the best Smoked Porters I've had.  Good job guys, this was one tasty Smoked Porter, keep up the hard work."

"Medium full body, medium to medium low carbonation."

"Lots of rich flavors, a great smoked American (!) porter, especially considering it's one of the most accessible on the (international, even) market."
""
"Refreshing flavor, grows on with more sips than one."
""
""
"Amazingly the smokiness is still very much present, although unfortunately most of the porter flavours have perished so it ends up tasting watery. Quite the opportunity though, to try this old a vintage."
""
""
"Overall: very impressed. This is the second smoked beer I tried, the first was Epic Smoked Porter. Hands off this was far better than Epic (the Epic smoked porter was still outstanding!) The smoke is more assertive yet not overpowering."

"Drinkability: This beer is my go to for the love of beer. If you don't like porters, or smoked beer stay away. if you like smoked porters, this is the one. Stone is close, but not as good."
"O - finally got to try it and it delivered. I have an affinity towards smoked beers, and this is top notch. I'll definitely buy this if I ever see it again."

"Poured from 650 ml bomber into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted March 2013."

"This is a bottle from the 2011 bottling. I worried that I had let this one cellar too long, but I was gladly mistaken. It pours with a black color and a thin, fizzy, light brown head. The aroma lets you know that it is a solid porter at its base, as there is a dark, roasty, bready sweetness, and the smoke adds a wonderful complexity rather than masking everything else. The flavor is so wonderfully meaty, with the smoked malts being much more assertive, although the smoke still doesn't overpower the sweet and roasty characteristics of the porter. Medium bodied and having a light carbonation, the texture supports the flavors nicely. Overall, I'm a fan of smoked beers and I'm a fan of porters, and this blends the two well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"It is dark in color with a nice head. A great smokey charcoal taste. It is smooth with a bitter finish. It is one of the best smoked porters I have had. I compare all smoked porters to this one."

"It's an outstanding smoked porter."

"Overall: It's very clean, the salmon smoke character is very unique and outstanding, porter backbone is barely noticeable. A very interesting example of the style and good representation that the smoke can do some unique and superb shit."

"Overall - Great smoked porter, AK goodness. I wish the porter base showed through a bit more but quite good as is."
""
""
""
""
"Heavily smoked malty without being too in your face or abrasive. A rich, deep dark cocoa feel balances the smoke out nicely with some hints of yeast and hops on the back end. Certainly something I would pick up again when on the West coast."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I traded for this beer a while ago and forgot I had it. I probably waited just a bit too long to crack it open, but I think it held up pretty well. Generally, I don't go for smoked beers, but this one is very nicely done. The smoke is subtle and a bit player, not the star of the show. I would prefer if the sweet flavors were a little more aggressive, and I find the feel to be a bit thin, but it's still a really nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a bold and complex beer. There are an amazing amount of flavor and aroma layers to peel back, especially considering its a conventional strength beer and not an Imperial porter."
""
"O-If you like smoked beers this would have to be up there. I enjoyed it and will try it again"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Porters make great smoked beers, and this proves it."
""
"Alaskan Smoked Porter commands a huge amount of hype, and manages to surpass it in every way. The sweet base porter with notes of dark chocolate and dark fruit combines so well with the huge, but not overwhelming notes of campfire and smoked meat, the drying finish being the brown gravy on top (cherry doesn't work well in this case). Truly a treat, and not one this beer drinker takes lightly, enjoying every last sip."

"A great beer. Rich and smooth."

"22oz bottle with a Bottled On Date of 09/10/13. Pours a dark brownish black color with an inch of light tan head. Lots of lacing. Great smokey aroma, almost like smoked salmon. Lots of charcoal, earth, smoke and small hints of black coffee and dark chocolate. The taste is more of the smoked malts and charcoal. Almost a bit meaty. Earth, smoke and bitter dark chocolate at the finish with some black coffee notes. Very little alcohol presence. Velvety mouthfeel that is on the lighter side. Overall, one of the best Smoked Porters I have had. Extremely well made with a great smokey taste."
""
""
"O - Wonderful smoked porter. Nice use of smoke. Many times the smoke is overpowering but this one is just right in my opinion."
""
""
""
"This has been on my wish list for several years and it lived up to every whisper of hype I ever heard about it."
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid smoked porter with a some great dark malt and sharp roast flavors."
""
""
""
"A dark brown beer, with an average beige head. In the nose there is smoke, light peat and chocolate. It is a medium bodied beer, with a low carbonation. In the taste there is meat, smoke, brown malts, whiskey malts. The aftertaste is light smokey, malty and light coffee. A nice smokey porter."
""
""

"Overall a really well done beer from Alaskan. I don't like beers with an overwhelming smoke presence, but this one suits my fancy just fine. Thanks to kangarooadam for the chance to try this one!"

"O - 4.00 - I like it, but I don't know if I'd rate it as high as the other guys here. The Bruery Smoking Wood blows it out of the water. This one is less well balanced and more smokey."
"Excellent and perfectly crafted Porter, great balance with bold flavors and still with great drinkability. It lived up to my expectations."

"Overall - I've been waiting to try this one for quite some time and this brew has met my expectations (and beyond). One of the best smoked beers I've had to date. Well executed brew overall."

"22 oz a year old bottle. Pours dark brown with creamy, beige head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of lox, coffee, dark fruit and vanilla. Body is full and crisp. Taste is of smoked malt, coffee, chocolate, vanilla, dark fruit and herbal hops. Finish is long, bitter-sweet. This brew made a trip to Alaska worthwhile. The brew was even better fresh on tap at the brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of the best smoked beers on the planet and easily the best I've had from America. The smoke is restrained and in good taste but the porter underneath that alder wood is fantastic. I'd recommend Alaskan Smoked Porter to anyone in the craft beer scene whether new or an old timer."
""

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, 2011 vintage. Pours pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, light coffee, light char, smoke, toast, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roasted/dark/smoked malt notes with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, light coffee, dark bread, light char, smoke, and roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, light coffee, dark bread, toast, smoke, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of dark/roast/smoked malt flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic smoked porter. All around awesome balance, complexity, and robustness of roasted, dark, and smoked malt flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."
""

"O: a beautifully balance beer with great complexity."

"Bomber poured into a Unibroue tulip. Thanks Cheesemoose! 2011 vintage. Deep mahogany body, almost black. Off white head, low retention, clear lacing. Aroma dominated by caramel malt, smoked malt, bacon, teriyaki jerk and a touch of vanilla. Taste follows suit with the aromas. Nice to see a low abv porter still taste great after a couple years!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As someone who hates the sensation of overly smokey beers, so this has a nice flavor profile for someone of my palate. I would definitely try this again, and it would be interesting to try a fresher bottle for comparison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Just a great Smoked Porter and an enjoyable beverage to enjoy after a day in the Alaskan wilderness."
""
""
"O: Really an excellent smoked porter. I'm a huge fan of smoked beers, so this is right in my wheelhouse. I've been fortunate to have this many times and it never disappoints. I'd love to see how this develops over a few years, but I can't keep it in my cellar for longer than a few months at a time."
"O: A beer with wonderful wood and smoke characteristics that makes this porter both unique and interesting. The touchstone of smoked beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an extremely well-balanced smoked porter. Its smokiness is prominent without being overwhelming and blends VERY well with its malty characteristics. Embrace the smoke!"
""
""
""
""
"O: the smoked porter by which all others are judged; big, smoky aroma and flavor; the smokiest beer I've had... wow! Pretty wild that I stumbled upon this in Denmark, having been to the brewery in Juneau, but missed it on that trip. I actually saw it in a couple of shops, which seemed nuts..."
""
"This is good. I look forward to enjoying it my meal upcoming."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a truly fine and impeccably well crafted beer. Easily my favorite smoked beer and I have easy access to Surly Smoke. Where Smoke is just that, a true smoke bomb, this one artfully blends the smoke flavor with those of a classic robust Porter. Exceedingly drinkable for the style and it is a joy to have a whole bottle to yourself. Recommended highly to fans of the style, but I believe every BA should try this once. Cheers!"
"O: this was great, so good, just needs at least a year to sit.... (not so?-)surprising hoppiness in this version... had a 2008 a couple weeks ago, hops all but gone, smoke and thick-but-clean malt in superb concert... this brew's definitely a ""porter"" - should've bought a few more bottles"
""
""
"I've been stalking this beer for years. I finally picked up a bottle a couple months ago in Milwaukee. It's a good looking smoked beer with a fine aroma. The nose seems more subdued to me compared to some other reviewers, but I left this beer in the glass a long time before sipping. That said, there was an initial blast of smoke (more like charcoal), but several minutes later I'm picking a lot of vanilla (from oak mabye?) Almost too sweet at first (more milk chocolate than cocoa) but drier than I expected, which I actually enjoy. It's so tasty and dry it's gone for I know it and I'm a bit sad. I shall find some more...."
"Overall - Flavor notes that I may not be grizzled enough to appreciate. However, it's without question that is has Alaskan influence and transports the drinker to the great outdoors."
""
"O - Smoked beers aren't something I seek out but I must say, this is one of the most enjoyable ones I've had and would be glad to run across it again."
""
"O: Bar none this is possibly the best smoked beer I've ever had. Everything comes together in a perfect harmony. It's very smoky, but in such a way that it perfectly compliments the flavor profile of the beer rather than just challenging the palate. Eminently drinkable. A perfect pairing with smoked and grilled meats (obviously), and also a wide range of desserts. This would not strike me as a great cellaring candidate, but by all accounts it does very well with a little time under its belt. I'm going to have to see about that."
""
""
"Whenever in the mood for a smoky brew, for me, nothing else comes close."
""
""
"It's OK Alaskan, you did your best. You did a great job getting smoke on the nose and on the palate… but there are just better longer lasting smoked beers on the market. However, I like it. I would like to see this with double the ABV, a little thicker, and a tad less carbonated. Past that, bottoms up!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a great porter and a great smoked beer. Very complex and flavorful for the abv, if this was year round it would contend as a fridge regular. But since its not, it will be a winter favorite of mine for time to come."
"Overall - I don't know that this is a porter so much as it is a classic Smoked Beer, as the smoke character dominates the entire flavor profile (unlike Stone's Smoked Porter where the roasted malt character is clearly present). This is very good, but as a porter it doesn't quite cut it. I enjoyed it, but I'm divided on whether I'd buy it again; the price is a major turn off."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - great smoked ported. Now that I can't get Stone easily, this can fill my needs for any smoked porter craving I may have"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good beer and a must try if you love heavily smoked beers. However, after all the hype about this beer, I was disappointed."
""
"Even though its smoky like hell, this beer is extremely drinkable. Maybe not everyday drinkable, but I would purchase more than one bottle at a time. That is if I could find this beer in my part of the country. I would love to age a bottle or two to what age will do to this beer. I doubt Father Time will counter this beer's thick smoky taste."
"Very, very classy. Amazing integration and coherency."
"O- I always wish i could write my reviews before seeing the score. I wouldn't say it's exceptional, but I would say it's one of the best porters I've had thus far. I would recommend it to anyone who is experienced in the style. I'd really like to see what cellaring would have done. Overall though, goddamn good beer."
""
""
""
""
"There's smoked beers, and then there's this! This is really intense but flavorful if you give it a chance and the right mindset. This would go really well with game meat, smoked salmon, or simply paired with a cigar. Fans of whiskey may enjoy this one as well. I would welcome this on any cold evening, just as people in Alaska would when escaping from their own harsh weather. It's a beer with atmosphere, for sure, just definitely not for every occasion!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A superb brew and one i'm glad i finally got to try... i have another bottle which i'll keep for a couple of years to see how it ages... highly recommended"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very tasty easy drinking beer. The smoke held up nicely after more than 3 years."
""
""
"Overall a real treat. I've had this several times in the past and have been wanting to get it in my smoked style rotation. A great selection for something in the lower octane category with loads of flavor and yes smoke! I dig it."
"Overall - The best smoked porter ive had. Such a smooth yet big flavored and unique flavor. Balance is great, alcohol is masked and the pleasure is a+ everytime i get to enjoy one of these. Nothing else is quite like this beer, world class, a must try."
"It really is smooth, feels nice and creamy. Recommended. My favorite from Alaskan by far."
""
""
"This is interesting, but nothing I'd like to have again to be honest."
"O - an outstanding example of malt smoking in a very approachable porter, this would go great with a medium rare steak or other red meat"
""
""
"O - overall a very tasty smoked porter, very solid flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Easily the best smoked beer I've encountered. Sexy, smooth and luscious."
"This is not a remarkably rich or decadent porter. That was clearly not the intention; instead, this is nicely balanced and very drinkable. I would drink a lot of this, if I could get it (nope)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not that i've had a lot of smoked porters, but I've had enough to know this is a great one, probably the best i've had. It's a definite must try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Worthy of a try."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very tasty exceptionally drinkable smoked porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - would certainly get again to share with friends, but I'm not sure if it's worth too much beyond the novelty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A smoked beer to try for sure."
""
"O- just as last year, smoke, smoke, and more smoke. Other then that there is a weird acidic copper twang. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, i've learned my lesson and wont be buying it again next year."
""
"Overall - As a smoked beer, it's pretty good if not a bit underwhelming. As a Porter, it is excellent! Though I still prefer Schlenkerla Rauchbier as my goto Smoked Beer, it is still a great all around beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: Great beer. Excellent porter. A sipper, because the meatiness is so heavy. I would drink again and recommend, but only if you like bacon."
"O - Even with an average mouthfeel, still a delicious, well-crafted brew."
""
""
"From tap: This pours a dark roasty cola color with tight foaming all around. There’s an aroma of lightly smoked malt with a brisket-bacon finish to it. For a smoked porter you know what you’re getting into. The beer has a big roast flavor up front with a mild bitterness that matches wit hthe roast and smoked notes. I find it simply delicious."
""
""
"O: If you like smoke in your beer - this could be your Nirvana. If you don't like beers with smoked malts - avoid!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is just a lot of fun. I love how the palate comes across as so varied for this style, and it is real easy drinking. What a lovely brew, wish I could get this all the time."
""
""
"O - Maybe paired better with a cigar or something. I think its a pretty well done beer, but its misleading to me calling it a porter. I'm rarely in a mood for a beer like this, but I would recommend it to friends who enjoy the smoky flavors more."
""
"Big thanks goes out to kkipple for sharing this one during the One Year Anniversary of My Wreck Tasting! 2008 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Crooked Stave ‘Crooked Line’ tulip. Poured dark brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, smoke, roasted malt, bread, and smoked meat. The flavor was of sweet malt, smoke, smoked meat, bread, and wood. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. This is probably one of the older smoked porters that I have had to date, so I was happy to see the smokiness sticking around. However, I have a feeling it might have lost a bit of its edge. All of the right flavors for the style were there, but they just didn’t seem to mix together as well as I would have liked. The aroma was still quite nice though which was definitely welcomed. Worth trying if you get the chance, but I would likely shoot for fresher if you have the option."
""
""
"A beer like this, you might expect a huge, more stout like beer. This isn't that, but rather a lighter, full flavored porter."
""
""
""
""
"If this beer were an album, it would be Leonard Cohen's Various Positions. His voice, at this point, is slightly raspy, but still incredibly soothing, and it's an album that can be played over and over and over all through the evening. It's a perfect fit for a cool winter's night."
""
""
""
""
" Bravo!"
""
"O: This is a pretty solid beer, but for sure not one of those ones that I would go out of my way to get. I really dont get the obsession that I have been seeing lately though."
""
""
""
""
""
"If you are new to beer, particularly craft beer, you should ignore this review. I'm a huge fan of dark beer and almost nothing else, so if your range is limited to the mass market breweries, you are not likely to enjoy this beer as much as I am. From my perspective, it would be like comparing coffee to water."
""
""
"O - The best I've had by Alaskan. Curious to see how it taste on tap...and with food."

"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a tulip glass, 2012 edition. This pours a dark brown, pitch black in the middle with a large foamy mocha colored head which leaves a lacing. The smells are quite nice, a nice camp fire smokey smell, a little roasted malts under that. The feel is medium with higher carbonination. The taste is good a nice smoky camp fire in a bottle, the smoke is definitely over the top, along with a little bitter roasted malts under that."

"O: Definitely one of the better smoked beers I've had but unfortunately I'm not a huge fan of the overly smoky beers. I like a more standard english porter like old engine oil with a nice complimentary smoke flavor. This one is basically an experiment to see how much charcoal they could add. Definitely a must-have for the smoked beer/rauchbier fan, however. Possibly the best of the style and honestly somewhat confusing why this is classified as a porter."

"O: good stuff. But I am a fiend for porters and this has just the right amount of smoke. My life is better having had it. A little hoppier than I am used to from a porter but it works."
""

"Body approaches black, medium & noticeably bubbly head develops with a slightly aggressive pour and hangs around a while. Smoke is mild on the nose with the roasted malts and coffee notes coming through more predominantly. The smoke is very easy on the palate as well. A good malt/hop balance and a touch of bitter coffee and dark chocolate to boot. I'd like the feel to be a bit thicker as opposed to the thin & bubbly feel I got, but on the whole I think it's quite a good beer. The smoked varieties aren't for everyone, but porters have proven to be very good when smoked and I think plenty of folks might find this or Stone's worth trying."

"Review from 2/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a deep orange amber approaching black. Nice moderate tan head. Looks beautiful in the glass with a long lasting head. Smoky toasted malt with slight chocolate aroma. Flavor is roasted malt, chocolate, faint dark fruit and hops, all overlaid with wood smoke, but very nicely done. A very nice smoky porter, and one that is commonly available in stores without much in the way of good craft beer; a bottle of this has saved me on trips with access only to boring chain store beer."

"Overall - A solid beer here. It's impressive to make such a balanced smoky beer. Well done."
""
""
"Overall - I don't love smoked beers. This is good, but too light for the smoke. Something to back up the smoke and balance it would be nice."
""
"Appearance is dark brown with a finger of a light tan head atop. The nose on this comes across with smoke(not a big surprise there), cocoa and a few spices. For the taste, I note black licorice, more of the smokiness, roasted malts, a small amount of chocolate as well. Mouthfeel is pushing towards heavy with a medium carbonation level. All in all, a damn fine porter/smoked porter. The smoke is not for everyone though, some friends and spouses may be scared off."

"2002 Alaskan Smoked Porter - Poured into a Duvel glass. Nice head from an agressive pour, pours dark brown with a medium tan head. Light smoke and char on the nose. Much of the smoke has faded from this thing - just a touch on the finish - this thing is nice, smooth, round, with a lot of balance. No signs of oxidation and the mouthfeel is creamy with a slight bit of sweetness. This thing has really held up. I picked this on up a few months back after an Alaskan event where the brewery brought bottles from their cellar, signed by the brewers. I suspect this one has been well cared for since bottling. This is a great cellar experiment and has definately held up - would definately try again if I found one that had proper cellaring."

"M: Medium bodied."
"this beer is much more than I had expected. many of these smoked beers are way over the top with the smoke character, and make them difficult to go back to for a second or third. this one no doubt is a smokey beer, but has a really nice chocolaty backbone that is a pleasant compliment to the smokey flavors and aromas"

"O - mild but deep flavor and a good feel would make this a solid choice"
""
""
""
""
"Overall - not a bad brew at all. Interesting and good-tasting."
"Cheers!"
"Starts with a pleasing sweetness but the thin body leads to a sharp finish. More of a dry Stout flavor with a dose of smoke, and hopped like an IPA. Not my favorite smoked beer. From the 22 oz bottle, the 2011 edition."

"High B"
"O: a delicious smoked porter. it's subtle when it needs to be and punches you in the mouth when it should as well. this beer could use a limited release vanilla sibling."
"what a great smoked beer from my friends up North, being from Canada I don't have many International friends North of the boarder, thanks Alaska for making a kick ass brew and thanks Rutager for getting it into my glass"

"Dark brown to black body topped by a medium thick creamy tan head with lots of lacing. The aroma is full of smokiness with subtle hints of malt, coffee and chocolate. The flavor is smokey and malty with a touch of roasted coffee. Medium to full bodied, smooth and slighlty dry."

"I would almost say seek this out, but deff say to try it if you see it for sure. I almost passed it up, but glad I got one."

"O - A very well put together smoked porter. Gets better with every sip."
"D - Another great beer from Alaskan, as I've yet to be disappointed by them. This one has done well with some age on it, and would likely benefit from some more."

""

"Pours black with maybe some lighter hues around the edges. A large beige head leaves quite a bit of lacing. Nose has some smoked woods and avoids the rauchbier 'meatiness' I had expected. A bit of char, burnt bread and bitter chocolate are secondary. Taste again has these wood-smoked malts at the forefront, with light burnt bread and bitter chocolate notes only in the periphery. A little thin in feel, but taste certainly makes up for it - smokiness is there on the palate and well into the finish. Drying, with minimal (if any) sweetness to contrast. Delicious and somewhat unique to me in terms of the smoke flavour, certainly wish I had more bottles to put away."
"A good brew that hits the style well. Wouldn't buy it again though -- smoked beers really aren't my thing."
""

"M - Light to medium body, moderate carbonation."

"Very nice reddish brown head, dark and robust. Smells like it was made in a BBQ pit! Smoky and roasted malts are all over this one. I love the taste I am going to use this to marinade stake with this and just skip the smoking process all together. Goes down nice and leaves a great roast malt taste behind. Great beer."
"O: a pretty good smoked porter. Not terribly complex, but lots of tasty smoked flavors and aromas."
""
"The original smoked porter. Meaty, smoky, chocolatey, toasty, roasty, and down right tasty. There’s a reason this inspired so many spin-offs. A truly great beer."
"O: When it comes to smoked beers, I prefer Big Smoke by Russell and Storm to this one."
"Seriously, it goes from kinda gross to excellent and worth the hype with just 5 minutes sitting in the glass. Don't rush."
"Overall an impressive smoked beer that had a ton of flavor with a very nice blending of the smoke, so it did not become too overpowering on the taste buds."
"2009 vintage bomber served to tumbler. The beer pours a deep black color with hints of ruby brown edges in the light. 2 finger tan bubbly head that fades to a thin film, good retention, average lacing. The nose consists of a strong roasted barley, cocoa, and smoke. Towards the end of the glass the nose becomes less smokey and more chocolatey in character. The flavor begins with a strong smoke character followed by the chocolate, roasted barely. Hints of fig, raisin, and even oak. Mild bitterness. The smoke begins to dominate the palette as the beer warms and finishes. Medium bodied and medium/light carbonation. Smokey. Overall, the smoke dominates. It doesn’t dominate to the point that you think you might be sucking on a charcoal briquette but it is strong. Still one of the better smoked beers I’ve sampled."
"O - Very unique and enjoyable beer experience. Almost like drinking scotch!"
""
""
""
"an absolutely amazing porter! pours near black with a reasonable tan head. huge nose. smokey as anything, lots of chocolate malt roasted heavy, and some alcohol tang. flavor is equally smokey, bornerline rauchbier, but the body is bigger here. this is expresso a little, but also some unexpected hop bitterness as it concludes. mouthfeel is fantastic, close to full bodied, strong, and carbonated a little more than most porters are, which gives it a more delicate feel. overall one of the better porters ive had in a while, very smoked. certainly the best alaskan beer ive had. gonna be gold with a major spicy chille con carne!"
"Overall: This brew is a fantastic example of restraint. Many other smoked beers go over the top with their combo of smoke and sweet malt that it ends up tasting like brisket. This one lets the style be what it should be while getting a nice assist from smoke. Great brew."
""
"O- This was decent, but not as good as Yazoo Sue. I did like the '02 vintage better for being smoother and fuller in body with bigger flavors. I would definitely drink this again, it just wasn't spectacular and didn't quite hit my expectations..."
""
"O: This is fantastic with more than a decade of age on it. Much better than when new, and with no signs of going over the hill any time soon. Love to try the same keg another decade from now."

"O- Glad I spent a few bucks picking this up at BevMo!, well worth the price."

"Overall, best smoked porter I have ever had. Highly recommended."
""
""
"Smell is of smoke, roasted malts, and dark fruits. Taste is even more forward with smoke and definately comes in with roasted malts and dark fruits. Basically the nose meets the taste but the taste is a little more definate. Really good Smoke Forward. Nice!!!!"
""
"Overall - Well anything can be better, but I am not sure how!"
"Overall Impression- Not sure how the current Alaskan Smoked Porters are but this one could have used a bit more body to it. This could have been from its date of over 10+. Enjoyed the aroma and taste big time nonetheless! I suggest you getting some of this now and aging it (I will be)."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- i loved this smoked porter as it was nicely balanced with the smoke and malts, will age 2 more of these"
"Definately one of the best smoked porters on the market. This is worth keeping one around for aging as I could imagine the flavors melding nicely."

""
""
""
""
"Overall: A tasty smoked porter. Not very complex. Very drinkable."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is perfection, with a medium-full body for a porter, carbonation a bit on the medium-low side, and a somewhat lingering and very pleasant aftertaste. Very smooth and creamy. So delicious and goes down so easy. I wish we got this on the east coast; it’s definitely one of my favorite beers of 2011."
""
""
"This is overall a well done smoked porter, where the smoke is very present, but not overdone. Perfect for new year's eve by a wood stove in the woods, where I happened to enjoy this brew."
""
""
"As a porter fan, I had to give this a try. I'm glad I did. It's a bit different than what I usually like about a porter as there is almost no sweetness, but this is a full-bodied and full-flavored beer. I'd love to have another two bottles, one to age and another to pair with food, but I've savor the one bomber I've got while its fresh."
""
""
"Overall: A very good smoked porter. Undertones of dark fruit add some nice complexities. Would go great with some smoked salmon."
"Overall: Great porter. Nice balance between the smokiness and porter. I think this beer is a great choice for someone who is new to craft beer, but also something the beer geeks can enjoy. Recommend it!"
"O - I'm not a fan of smoked beers, but I do love a good porter. This is an amazing beer. The smokiness is just really well balanced and integrated with everything. This is world class for sure!"
""
""
"O - A pretty good porter. I don't find it to be stellar by any means but is still worth a try. I'm not always a huge fan of smokey beers because the smokiness can become overwhelming. However, this beer does a good job of holding the smoke in check."
""

"A smoked beer is something I'm rarely in the mood for, but this one is probably the best of the style I've encountered so far."

"This is a really good beer. So many smoked beers are just about the smoke. This one has a strong porter base that allows the smoke flavors to dance on top of it, without totally obscuring it. Mouthfeel is divine."

""
"(D)- This is a great porter. And an even better example of how to properly add smoke flavor into a beer."
""
"O: Definitely like it, but not as much as I was hoping. Can see why people do enjoy this beer though."
"Had this beer at my last tasting. This beer pours a nice dark brown to almost black color with a thin tan head. The smell is smoke up front followed by a nice roasted malt character. The flavor is very similar but the smoke is nowhere near as prominent as in other smoked porters I have had (this is a good thing) the smokiness is followed by a little bit of roast. The mouthfeel is fairly dry and moderate carbonation. Overall a good beer and I would love to make me some chili with this beer."

"O - I was impressed with how well this Smoked Porter held up...I know this is one of the better smoked porters out there, but for three years this one still had a lot going on...I wouldn't mind trying a fresh bottle"
"O- solid beer that is worth trying out each year when it comes out. Not my cup of tea for everyday, but its a good beer. I'm going to have to try and find a couple more smoked porters now."

"Poured into a 20 oz giant Duvel tulip. Pours a very silky smooth black, with a 3 inch light tan head, some attractive lacing. Smell is different than any Porter I have smelled hands down. Smoked bacon, burnt expresso, and some smoke gouda cheese. It kind of works, wouldn't recomend to everyone. Taste is crazy dry burnt coffee, over cooked bacon, and over done hot cocoa, but in the most complex way. How is it so enjoyable, because I for some reason can't wait for the next sip. Body is perfect for the ABV, with plenty of carbonation and drinkable. This is a beer that I have been wondering about the hype and I understand it now. This is nuts, I am glad I am at this point, because 6 months ago I wasn't ready."
""
"O: Exactly what it is marketed to be. Couldn't drink a lot of this so I'm glad I've got 8oz and not a whole bomber."

"O: Lots going on here, good hops presence along with as that comes with a good porter, nice balance. Smoke acts as a great enhancer."
""
""
"Verdict: Smoky, woody and bacony. Pretty great blend going on here, nice bitter kick at the end, could use some aging, very interested to see how this turns out in a year."
"O= This is a great beer. I was offered a case when I bought it and I'm starting to think I may need it. Blend of all things great porter and smoke. I'll be picking up a lot more of this."

"Opaque, nearly brown black porter with a hint of ruby tint. Tightly bubbled light brown head that is an inch high singular shade that lingers nicely. Light smoke, chocolate, and black licorice in the nose that is very subtle. Smoke pops into the mouth clearly with burnt toast, and the taste of charcoal like the burnt edge of bbq. Chocolate, malt and a bit of hop tingle backs up the smoke. Mouthfeel seems a little light, but, overall, an excellent beer that's a joy to drink."
"Overall- A good porter. Im thinking it would probably taste a little better with some age to it, not too much. Overall really good though. Complex and subtle at the same time, just wish i wasnt semi sick while driking it."
"O. My reference smoked porter is New Glarus' Smoke On The Porter. This isn't quite in its league but it is still pretty good nonetheless."
"Overall, this is a spectacular beer, highly recommended to anyone who likes porters or stouts."
"WOW, wished I had a closet full of these."
"2012 review of a 2002 vintage: Smells like fruity, smoky molasses. Carbonation is almost gone. Taste is like a smoky sherry, with some light molasses and coffee. Very interesting, but prefer it fresh. Maybe this is too aged."
"I love smoked beer and this one delivers. I only wish there was some more sweetness here, but nonetheless, I am still enjoying it. A great beer that doesn't have an abv that ends your night after one or two."
"O: Very tasty and actually nicely balanced. Who knew!"
"Like It? For Sure, This Is Quite Good"
"O- In my opinion this is the best smoked porter out there."
"Overall: A solid beer. The first impression does wonders. I will age a couple of bottles for a while."
"A different take on a smoked beer but a good one."
"WOW...great year 2009...just ordered a case from Oregon 6.99 a bottle, plus delivery, my son living in Anchorage and working part time Mo0sses Tooth Brewery turned me on to this beer...Damn good beer with an aftertaste that never gets old, if you can find some then Drink it !!!"
"O: Excellent example of a smoked ale here. Goes well with smoked meats."
"O - I really like this beer. I live in Indiana and happened on a bottle of this on a brief trip to Lafayette, CO."
"Mouthfeel is solid, well carbonated. Overall very solid"
"D. My first alaska beer and damn good. One of my favorite smoked beers."
"O - this is excellent"
"D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. As mentioned in the last sentence of the mouthfeel, I think they key to this beer is the balance. It has smoke, but is kept in check by the coffee, sweet chocolate, and slight saltiness. Not one specific aspect of this beer overwhelms the mouth, but rather it comes together in a succinct package to just be a tasty beer."
"just not a fan of the smoked beer, but if youre into it this seems to do the style well."
"D - WOW, what a beer!!! Those who are wondering about 2008 and 'if' they're still drinkable...THEY ARE! I picked this up at the Meto-Market in Kirkland WA...full shelf available. Well rounded, starts out dominating with the smokiness and finishes the same way. No complex flavors but definitely a very good beer, since there are plenty left down the road where I live, I think I'll get another one soon (now perhaps :~) BEER HEAVEN!!!"
"O: I really enjoyed this beer and since I live so close to Oskar Blues I plan to purchase this beer again on a return visit. This beer went very well with my barbecued pulled pork sandwich and if I wasn't driving I would have had another. It seemed to age well, although I haven't tasted a 2011 Alaskan Smoked Porter to compare."
"O: This is an amazing beer, far better than I had ever hoped it would be. The only drawback is I will probably have to wait a couple of years before I'll get ahold of one again."
"Poured a coffee brown with a moderately lacing beige head. Aroma of chocolate, dark malts, and light smoked wood. Roasted malts in the taste, chocolatey. Honestly didn't get much smoke on first sip, but after a quick palate-cleansing, there was a definite smokey, ashy character going on, so it's a good thing I tried again, and properly so (God knows what I drank before it). Also a very subtle plum sensation barely detectable, I thought. Nice, not quite full-bodied, and quite drinkable."
"Thanks Dane for the chance to try this one. It's easy to see why this one is a classic and I'll definitely be searching out other vintages in the future."
"Pours black with a nice brown head. I know that is no description, but really, thats what it looks like. The nose is smoke integrated with light, creamy chocolate malt. Yum. The flavor is fantastic. The smokiness is super smooth, rich and well integrated. Nice, lightly sweet malts. The word here is balance. Lower carbonation with a smooth, slightly creamy body. This is not the best porter I have ever had (hello Edmund Fitz), but the smoke integration is so nice on this beer. Definitely worth seeking out."
"If I would have had this years ago, I would have thought this was a smoke/bomb. For a heavy rauchbier drinker this is mild. Good, well made. The aromas are weaker than the flavors of the smoke though. Quality porter with deep dark chocolate and coffee and well balanced with Smokey malts. This is a great beer for new smoke beer drinkers."
"Future outlook: Got in a trade from (?), and doesn't come here, so not likely to have again anytime soon. Didn't really mean to stow this beer away for so long, but it seems to have come out of it's ~3 years slumber with flying colors."
"Very well balanced and tasty."
"The 2008 vintage bomber into a pint glass. Pours dark to point of black with 2 fingers of foam no lacing, and rim of foam in the edge. Smells of malt with some good smoky notes. Taste is robust with good smokey balance. Very good beer and one of the first aged beers that I have had."
"O: Its like a ""comfort beer"". Rich, flavorful and easy to drink. The smoke flavor is just right; present in richness but not like the bottom of an ashtray."
"OVERALL: Can’t believe this is the same brewery that makes that Baltic porter. This is a really tasty brew and well worth checking out. The palate could be a little bigger, which would give the flavors that backbone required for a perfect score, but that’s a minor issue. This is a flavorful and well crafted smoked porter that everyone should get the chance to try. If you see it, don’t hesitate. Thanks again akbeerfiend. Recommended."
"The brew pours a cola-brown hue and is capped with a very short-lived tan fizzy head. Lets get the smoke element out of the way first: Initially smoke is apparent in both the aroma and flavor; it immediately subsides to mere nuance on the palate, with the olfactory tuning it down shortly thereafter. The smoke contribution is in the range of smoked salmon, and is fairly mild as smoke intonation goes; it is not brutal like, say, hickory or campfire smoke, it has more of a soft subtlety. The flavor shows quite a bit of luscious dark fruity character along with a chocolate impression that strengthens on the finish. The nose suggests dry woody notes, port-like oxidation, soy sauce, and tanned leather, with some of the leather showing up on the palate as well. The feel is just too thin; it does not make for a bad mouthfeel, but it is far from the potential heights of enhancement that I envisage. Overall, it is still one of the more impressive handlings of the smoked element that I've encountered in a beer."
"Overall this beer is exceptional IMO. Great depth and flavor with excellent, balanced smokiness."
"T: There's some nice smokiness upfront followed by some roasted malts. The smokiness is nice and subdued and works perfectly with the malts. There's a faint hit of sweetness as well on the finish."
"Note: enjoyed a vertical tasting of this beer at the Savor. The older vintages had little carbonation and tended to have more smoke aroma and taste."
"Flavor was of an excellent malty porter with a bit of smoke. I wasn't sure I'd like a smoked beer, but I had no issues with this one. I picked up the bomber on a business trip to Denver. If I could get it in Indiana, I'd be happy to drink more of this."
"Wow - a whole lot going on in this brew, but it all comes back to the chocolate malt, whether it be from a swing by the fishy seashore, or a traipse through the wild northern forests. A very fine porter that rams home that outdoors-y feel."
"Overall, an outstanding beer. One to seek out, try fresh, and squirrel away a few for cellaring."
"A really well done, highly smokey beer. Often times the smoke can run amok and ruin a beer. Alaskan was really able to incorporate it well here, though."
"O: After having this fresh one I really wanted to see what a 10 year old bottle felt like. They say it holds up like a champ so hopefully I'll know someday. I like what they do with this beer. Could have easily drank this bottle by myself."
"Overall a good American smoked beer, but it could be improved imo."
"I was informed that this beer has won more medals at the Great American Beer Festival than any other beer, quite an accomplishment."
"O- Rather disappointed with this brew. I will try to buy a newer bottle to compare, but was looking for much more depth. The smoke aroma & taste is done very well, but that all you really get. Easy to drink, but a bomber gets kinda boring about a 1/3 through. Needs much more malt presence to fill in the voids."
"Overall - This is actually my first smoked beer that I've had, so I don't really have any standard to hold it up against. It's tasty and quite adventurous for those who aren't familiar with this type of brew. I would probably buy this again if I could find it in Florida and I would share it with some fellow brew heads. Purchase on sight..."
"Alaskan Porter pours a solid black, not even a hint of brown at the edges. It seems less intimidating than a big stout though. There's an easy four fingers of light caramel head on the beer, splitting my glass in two. Retention is very good, amd thick rings of lacing are left circling the glass. The nose is good, but a little bit too much smoke and not enough porter for my taste. There's some espresso notes for sure, but smoke is easily the star of the show. The malty base beer shows up more in the flavor, coffee and chocolate notes abound to open the beer. The smoky quality slowly creeps into the picture, like an oncoming fog, until there's nothing left but a pleasantly smoky finish. While the carbonation is nicely understated, the body could stand to be a bit more full/rich for such a malty beer. Alaskan Smoked Porter takes a tasty base brew and adds just the right amount of smoke to change it into something new and unique without overpowering the beer."
"Pours a dark brown color with red hues around the edges and a slight off white head which leaves some lace. The aroma is of big smoke, like being at a bonfire, there is also a hint of coffee and maybe a subtle dark chocolate there. The taste again is big smoke, the taste again is like a campfire but then it is balanced out by a chocolate and cofee taste. There is a little more to this beer, a nice balance with being true to what it is. The mouthfeel is creamy and lightly carbonated. Overall it is a solid beer, it isn't just all smoke with no substance underneath it. Well worth a try."
"O - Not in the same league as the Schlenkerla but nonetheless a very nice smokey ale."
"Mouthfeel isn't as stellar as the taste.  There is a distinct lack of carbonation that I like but the beer finishes very dry which doesn't work to well.  There is also an out of place bitterness like old coffee or a cheap chocolate bar that isn't great.  Good thing this one tastes so good because the flavor of this almost full bodied beer distracts from the lackluster feel.  I can easily put this in the top smoked beer category.  Well done and worth buying, I'm going to try and age some if I can hold out."
"O: A great smokey porter; a bit subdued on the smoke side but that is due perhaps to the age but nonetheless this is a smooth and delicious beer"
"Overall. Fantastic smokeyness that's really strong but still pleasant. Bit of a novelty maybe? Wouldn't want to drink often, but nice as a treat. Will enjoy a vertical tasting when I collect a few years."
"Overall I really like this offering from the big cold state. I tend to trade these away because there is quite a following.... on second thought I think I will drink the remainder of these. A must try!!"
"This has a fantastic aroma and a great taste. It is not very powerful, either. It goes down easy."
"O: The smokiness didn't work well with the other flavors here, it just takes over and really dries out the mouth."
"Overall, this is a pretty good smoked porter. I've had a few of the style and this holds up pretty well. A smoked porter should be smoky, and this one is."
"Always impressed with a good smoked infused beer though not my favorite style. This porter blends a full bodied flavor and drinkability. Comes off slightly sweet and heavy so a full bomber is a long night ahead."
"2009 bottle. Pours a dark, dark brown with a large creamy head. Nose is nicely smoked malt, some charred bacon. Pleasant. Mouth is very thin, some very nice smoked bacon flavors. Toasted malt, perhaps a touch of coffee. Some light sugars there. Pretty nice beer, not the greatest smoked beer I've had, though I love this style and certainly could drink this one whenever. Just a touch thin, which is my only real knock on this."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a big 2 inch tan head that fades to a small cap. Nice rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smells of roasted coffee, unsweetened chocolate, campfire smoke, and a earthy wood smell. Very nice to sniff. Taste is similar with smoked malts in the front followed by subdued coffee and slight cocoa powder flavors. There is a woody essence that lingers in the mouth after each sip. Mouthfeel is a bit disappointing. Very low carbonation leaves the beer very thick to drink easily. Overall, this is a great porter with a great smoky taste. I am glad I have a few other bottles in the cellar to enjoy later on."
"O: All in all, this beer doesn't lie at all, it is definitely smoked. One of the most smoked beers I've ever had. Good to try if you like the smokey and roasty flavors."
"Pours a slightly hazy, brown color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and great lacing. Smells of roasted malt, smoke, sweet malt, and slight hop. Fits the style of an American Porter. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of smoke, slight roasted malt, sweet malt, slight hop, and slight coffee. Overall, the best offering I've had from Alaskan Brewing. Good appearance, aroma, body, and blend."
"Thank you chugalug06 for the trade!"
"This is a great aged beer. The true flavor and smoke really pop out. I'm going to seek out some '09 and '10 to cellar. Sweet!"
"D- This beer has a great smoke flavor with the support of to roasted dark malts and hops that work together. The great flavor hangs on the tongue and breath after each sip."
"Pours a very dark brown and is nearly opaque. Good off white head with a bit of lacing and a good collar as it goes down. The nose brings quite a bit of smoked malt and a bit of meaty bacon. There's also a slight amount of roast. Flavor is dominated by smoke and meat with a nice roasted malt backing. Medium body with a nice dry finish. Waited awhile to try this and it did not disappoint."
"mouthfeel is good. i initially wanted a bit more, but i think the medium body keeps the smoke from getting too heavy. good drinkability results!"
" Thick, creamy mouthfeel with moderate carbonation and a lingering roasty, smokey finish. Smooth, really well balanced and very easy to drink, this is an outstanding smoked beer."
"O: overall a nice, drinkable beer, I will seek this beer out again."
"Overall: A great beer -- I love the big robust smells and flavors and how it stays true to the term ""smoked"" from the title and makes sure it's there in every sip. Not a lot of breweries doing these at the moment, but this one is doing it right. Cheers to them."
"D/O- Drinkability is incredible which you wouldn't expect from a smoked beer. The smokiness is well balanced with the porter. Quite possibly the best porter I've ever had. Thanks to TATURBO for hooking the up keg, bringing it back from Arizona."
"overall, this is a really nice beer. Very roasted very smoky very nice"
"D- Quite easy to drink, tastes are pretty well balanced but a bomber was enough, the smoke flavors prevent this being a sessionable beer."
"This is certainly an unique take on a porter that delivers in the area of taste. I'll be sure to hold onto my 2007 bottle just for comparison down the road."
"The CPJ"
"It is a dark and smooth liquid with a creamy head. I know this next comment it going to throw some off, but the first taste had me saying ""bacon?"". Apparently, this company grows their malts for the beer in a smokehouse. The first taste borders overwhelming, but the rest of the beer is smooth and delicious. By the second sip, the smokiness serves as a fulfilling backdrop."
"Beer is medium bodied, mild malt sweetness up front, strong midpalate and late palate smoke but with a moderate finish. I have decided after drinking several smoke / rauch beers in the past year that the secret to a good one is to not finish dry. The bitterness from the smoke and the roasted malts on a dry finish would have ruined this beer for me...I think. Some rauch / smoke beers do finish this way and it's suffocating. This beer finishes with a medium body, not wet but definitely not too dry. Makes it an enjoyable beer overall. I'd have it again."
"The bottle is 65.1cl brown glass, with a single, simple label that has no clear indication of brewing date. Pouring it, the beer is a dark brown with a light beige head that fades to mere ring. It smells of oak, the smoked salmon, and dark malts. It tastes like pork fat and smoked salmon, with a light coffee like maltose taste beneath it all. It has a crisp bite, with an airy hint of the smoked taste lingering. It drinks easily, especially with other, stronger flavours."
"D: A very nice beer overall that I enjoyed."
"Drink it pretty good, no real abv kick, creamy and rich but not heavy, decent carbonation and a nice balance but touch of salty/briny taste, a slight sticky finish but dries decently."
"Good beer but a great Porter. Recommend anyone who can try this brew."
"Full finger's worth of deep brown head, some froth but lots of much larger bubbles as well, about average retention, the lacing much more impressive with broad, sticky streaks that just don't go away. Black liquid, still also comes across as very clean and without any haze at all, you gets some metallic reddish-orange at the glass bottom and rims. ""Smoked"" is absolutely truth-in-advertising, the smoke is deep, broad and energetic, brings out a woodsy side as well as dried herbs, coffee bean, cocoa, anise, there's some caramel in there but sweetness is not a main goal here, more orange zest than any cherry or berry fruit, as you adjust the smoke seems to even bring out meat fat or beef jerky notes. Medium-bodied with a super-firm mouth presence, glues itself in place. This achieved even as the carbonation brings muscular kick and scrubbing action. The smoke doesn't have the same complexity here, the trade-off might be that the tongue can register the sweetness in the plum, cherry flavors. Coffee bean, mocha powder, bittersweet nibs, some vanilla bean too. Its earthy side comes out more here, herbal matter helps add to overall balance, mineral water too. As you'd expect, the smoke still outlasts the other flavors."
"I was very happy to finally get to try this one. It was as good as I expected and hope to get some more of it."
"Peat, smokey, woodsy, a little bit of malt subdued by the power of fire. The mouth is stretched by the smoke, throat scratched, like a cat going down clawing. Maybe not quite that intense, but it is a very nice smokiness that rolls down and stays there. Little bit of chocolate maltiness hiding in the background. Very good beer. Looking forward to that 2008."
"A delicious smoked beer with lots going for it. Plenty of flavour and pizazz."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being a little below average. Very nice mouthfeel overall for the style. Drinkability is excellent, I love the flavors and the alder wood smokiness it has. Everything integrates fantastically in it. I love this beer, it's easily my favorite smoked beer and just a great beer overall. Wish it was easier to get, but until then I'll continue to try and clone it at home."
"Brought this to a dinner with friends where we were eating some pretty hearty winter type food. Potatoes, mac salad, burgers, chili, that kind of thing. Smoked porter fit right in with that kind of a meal, which is a testament to how good this thing is despite its pretty intense smoke flavor. Looks like an average porter, and when smelled all i got was the smoky namesake. However, the taste was something else. Not as intense as a real Schwarzbier makes this far more drinkable and suitable for food. Even alone this beer stands up to a lot of porters and stouts i have tried. There is a real depth of character that opens up as it warms especially when paired with something meaty. I liked the coffee notes at the end, but was glad they weren't overpowering. Felt surprisingly light for a porter as we drank it as well. A rare porter that I would go back to."
"D - for something so assertively flavored and heavy-going, this is quite drinkable, but more for easy sipping"
"Nice, simple and very easy to drink smoked porter."
"overall i remember the last bottle i had being more refined maybe it was an 09...maybe time would do this some good...still a very interesting beer"
"This beer pours a rather dark brown color with an ecru foam on the surface. The smell is of cocoa and moderate smoke notes on the nose. The flavor has the smoke notes but it is fairly toned down on the flavor. There is a bit of char on the palate that is weak but noticeable. The malt and chocolate helps out the gorgeous mouthfeel that exists right now. It's nice and smooth and highly drinkable."
"D - Superb drink for any occasion... such as waking up in the morning. Really, an excellent beer with nothing bad to say about it."
"The smoke flavors were really complex and very well balanced with the malt notes. Very drinkable and definitely a seasonal I will look forward to again, especially at a pretty reasonable price."
"This brewery and brew are definately new to me me and looking forwards to it and it pours a rich dark cola hue with nice carbonation that leaves behind a creamy two finger head that slowly recedes to leave a few islands of froth here and there and a rim of lacing,the smell definately reminds me of a cold winters night next to the smokey woodfire with also some aromas of crispy salty bacon and some light dried dark fruits,the mouthfeel is light-medium bodied but very easy going and averagely carbonated which allows the flavours of smokey bacon,a tinge of aniseed/liquorice,dark malts and a dark fruit hoppy bitterness right at the finish all to mingle ever so nicely and could drink more than the one of and look forward to my next sampling from this brewery."
"D: Currently on vacation in CO and I couldn't be drinking a better beer to fit the mood. Very happy to have the opportunity to have this, I hope to bring some home and will gladly drink it whenever given the opportunity."
"Full bodied, so much so you can practically chew on this beer. This beer has a huge smokey flavor with hints of bacon, charcoal and barbecue but it also has a creamy lactic presence mid-palate that provides excellent balance and complexity. Hints of silky chocolate, toffee, coffee bean, wood and more smoke. The balance, complexity and well masked ABV make this beer extremely quaffable. Although, it is one of the smokier beers I've had, it's not a complete smoke bomb. Even if you don't like this style and/or rauchbiers I still recommend that you give it a try. Excellent!"
"From bomber to a pint glass. This beer pours deep brown almost-black, with an inch thick, creamy chocolate shake colored head that dissappears almost immediately. Smells of campfire roasted meat, smokey delicious goodness. The beer is not over the top bold, coffee, charcoal maltiness with lots of smoke. Crisp clean finish (surprising and unexpected). Dry and the after is very consistent with the start. This is a fantastic beer. Instantly transported to camping. This will be my go to beer with meat and an excellent campfire sipper. Absolutely delicious!"
"Drink- Very very tasty. I had the 09 before and it made my gout flare up the day after but after losing 100 pounds I think I will have to try to find more smoked porters or baltic porters to try."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bomber into a pint glass. This beer pours an almost-black, with chestnut highlights. It has an eyelash worth of thin, creamy tan colored head that very rapidly disperses. The beer has a nose heavy with the smokey oak/wood aromas, as well as sweet molasses/caramel, and some bitter roasted notes. The beer has a bold, bitter coffee flavor, with smokey under- and overtones. It also has a malty backbone that the other flavors spring from. The beer has a sharp and crisp finish, despite the robust and round flavors. Very dry in mouth, but aftertaste is just as bold with the smokey and coffee flavors as the initial taste. This beer seems to have two separate blossoms of flavor...fantastic! Very easy to drink, especially on cold winter nights."
"My hopes were high for this one since it reviewed so well, it kept up to the hype and I would certainly enjoy another!"
"D - This is one of my favorite beers out there I could drink this all day long this was a fresh bottle but it gets better with age this is one beer that everyone should go and get and have at least once"
"Outstanding smoked porter. Had the 2010, poured a super dark black with a good caramel head that receded slowly to great lacing. Delicious smoky smell, tasted strongly of smoked malts, great mouthfeel, thick and rich. Exceptionally drinkable, very glad to have another bottle of this in the cellar."
"Very smoky, but yet oh so delicious, This baby is smooth and I could really see myself sipping on this on some cold winter nights. Really glad I had the opportunity to give it a try."
"I was lucky enough to try this with a couple BAs last night. It poured a perfect black with a thin, dark khaki head. Welcome to the smokehouse. It smells like smoked ham. Tell grandma to forget the ham for the holidays. Give the family a pint of this! This beer is loaded with pork, in the best of ways. It smells and tastes exceptionally liked smoked meats. What a beer. It drank very smoothly and had the perfect consistency for a porter. This beer was amazing. Glad I got to try it. This puts the Beer Geek Bacon to shame."
"M/D: Medium body with a creamy mouthfeel. Very little carbonation. Very drinkable beer, though I don't know if I would call it sessionable."
"I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. But I do enjoy the roasted and smokey notes found in this porter."
"This is a terrific beer indeed, but I prefer Yazoo's Sue to this(probably the homer in me)."
"A delightful smoked porter. The style won't suit everybody but is a favoriate of mine and this is top notch. I would love to do a side by side with Left Hand Smoke Jumper, though I might need some assistance."
"D= Very Drinkable IMO, I had no problem with the bomber wish I had another."
"Ok, time for the reveal: Alaskan Smoked Porter 2010. I was able to try a few year old vintage of this at a homebrew meeting, but fresh it is a completely different beast. I remember the previous bottle having a cherry or dark fruit note to it that I'm not getting here. This is good stuff."
"Drinkability-Plenty smooth, but I can't imagine more than one per session. I expected nothing different and there's not a thing to change here."
"Alaskan Smoked Porter is one of the best smoked beers that I have ever had. Maybe the best, and with great balance and no trace of alcohol, it is very drinkable."
"Very drinkable. Quite a tastey brew. Highly recommend picking one of these up."
"Mouth is on for a porter. A bit bitter and astringent from the roast, but not too much. I'll enjoy this 22oz."
"D-This is a very solid contribution from Alaskan, and is now something I will look for each November. Well done."
"2010 version. Appearance is EXTREMELY dark brown...not black, but very dark brown. Scent is delightful with nice roasted scents. I get some smoke and campfire. I also get slight bacon aromas. Taste is awesome with initial hoppiness immediately followed by roasted malt flavors. I get some burnt toast with tasty chocolate and an impressive balance of smokiness. Very tasty porter. Mouthfeel is fairly light...I feel like it would be more delicious if it was thicker. But then again, being this light could be a good thing. Drinkability is high."
"O - When you need a smoked porter, you need a smoked porter, and tis is a good one."
"Having the 2009 vintage on Thanksgiving day 2010. Poured from a 22 oz. bomber. Dark as a moonless night with a superior head and lacing that lingers (among the best). This is a well balanced porter with the alder smoke complementing the roasted malt. The smoke never overwhelms but is present throughout. The finish is slightly bitter, leaving the hops and smoke with the last word. A nice, warming beer to have on a chilly day. Very enjoyable!"
"Had a bottle of 09 and it was great . Smoky but not overpowering and on the dry side on the finish. What I liked about this beer is it is not huge in flavour ( and ABV) profile but rather a well balanced porter that happens to be smoked. You can drink it as stand alone but it really shines when it is matched with food such as Cassoulet. Great beer that defines the style in North America"
"Smooth and creamy on the palate, with a sharp tangy smoky awesome flavor, bacon. Not very sweet,the malt balance is just right. The best American smoked beer I have tried by far. Wonderful!!!"
"Overall this is an exceptional porter that hits all the right notes. A beer fit for a knight."
"I think if it were to be aged about 6 months in a bourbon barrel it would add a deeper complexity and would I probably pay $20 for that bottle... I wonder if I can do that on my own???"
"D - This is a tough one - if it weren't for the compelling curiosity to try another round of weird, liquid cured meat, the latter half of the 750ml bottle would be at risk of going to waste (although realistically, that would never happen - no matter what the beer). But the fact remains, the meatiness is in there, and because of that I couldn't help but keep pouring until the last drop."
"D: A solid porter, though I've got to say this one really needs to warm up a bit to be appreciated. Paired well with a BBQ chicken pizza."
"Ah, this is definitely one to let warm up before having a go at it. Regardless, drinkability is really good. I would drink this regularly, if I could (I'd also have fun aging it). Recommended as a fine after dinner mint."
"well. review cut short by son..."
"I have been waiting for this one for Years. And I also had 4 other Alaskan Brew's shipped my way too."
"I love this beer. It was the first smoked beer I had and now I call it a gateway beer since it turned me onto smoked beers. Everything is about it great from the smell, to the color, and to the taste. This beer is a definite recommendation for anyone who loves porters and wants to get into smoked porters. I'd be interested to age one and see how it tastes in a year or two."
"D- Not too bad. Pretty easy to drink. I think if it was a bit thicker I'd really like this one. I could drink this again, but I don't think I'd reach for this one all that often."
"I really love this stuff, one of my favorite American porters and easily my favorite smoked beer."
"D: A very very good beer. This is probably one of the best smoked beers I've had. The flavors work so well together, this may be the best porter I've had."
"Highly recommended!! By far my favorite brew from Alaskan-"
"2009 vintage, about a year old, sideways label. Sampling right after the '10 version to compare. Pours much the same, impressive head, deep brown, see above. Aroma however instantly jumps out as being different. Less of a straight forward roasted malt, although that is present, and more of a nice mellow fruityness developing. Added complexities in the flavor profile as well. Really, really nice. Age is good. Nice mellow sweetness, fruity, raisin; reminds of darker ales from Belgium. Smoke and wood in the finish, perhaps a bit more pronounced. Maintains a voluptious and soft mouthfeel without being too thick, and perhaps a bit chewier a year later. Essentially, every area of this beer has improved age - I can't wait to try some more vintages next year."
"On tap at Old Chicago Westy in a shaker glass. Pretty dark brown with decent head and lacing. Smoke on the nose and first sip was all smoke. Since glass was cold and the brew was too cold, too, I let the glass/brew warm a bit. After a few minutes, still got the smokiness but was able to pick up malt with a little chocolate. Drinkability is good to great; this is my favorite brew from Alaskan."
"Drinkability: If you're looking for a smokey porter, you won't be disappointed by this one. I'll probably pass on another as porters are out of my preferred wheelhouse, but there's no denying this one has big smokey taste."
"D - I like it. Big, robust, smokey flavor but a sweet finish that guides the beer toward a balanced end. I'm excited to see what happens to this beer with some age on it."
"Drinkability: Very interesting. Would work great as marinate or brine. Reminds me of camping... I love camping.. I love this beer?"
"Drinks: like a fine cigar. I still think Schlenkerla does a better rauchbier, but Alaskan comes damn close with this one."
"I cannot begin to express how perfect this beer tastes to me."
"A classic--you can't call yourself a beer geek unless this beer has touched your lips. If you are into all things smoke or a lover of Porters, it's a must try. The brewers suggest drinking it now or aging it for several years; we prefer drinking it fresh."
"D - Well rounded, starts out dominating with the smokiness and finishes the same way. No complex flavors but definitely a very good beer, if I hadn't gotten it while on a trip across the country, I would get it again, but sadly it's not readily available where I am now."
"D- Fairly high, this is a very tasty beer. Not as good as Capt. Lawrence's smoked porter but at least in the same ballpark. I'd buy it if I saw it in my local store. Great smoked beer. Worth seeking out."
"I would probably buy this beer again with the intent to age. This bottle is about a year old, but it might be worth seeing where it goes. I like it now, smoke beers aren't my bag, so I'll take it."
"This has a surprisingly light body, and would be a very easy drinking porter if not for the intensity of the smoke. I really want to drink this again with a giant grilled rib eye so I could have some food that can stand up to this beer. Nice job, very enjoyable."
"D: A solid beer, and one of the better smoked beers I've had. I wouldn't mind something with a little heavier body, but it's quite nice the way it is."
"Jet black with no head an medium head retention. Aroma is combination of slight malt sweetness and light smokiness. Medium carbonation on the front end. It begins lightly sweet with chocolate notes. Smokiness builds in middle but only a moderate extent. Tastes like liquid brisket. Medium mouthfeel, consistent with style."
"Drinkability: A very good beer. The smoke is present throughout, but not overpowering. The porter portion is very rich and thick. Would only do one at a time, but wish I could find this closer to home."
"Drinkability: While the beer does go down pretty smoothly, due to the strong flavor of smoke it is not a beer that I would drink a lot of at a time. Good to finish off one bottle, but no more than that."
"D: this beer is something special. I have tried and enjoyed many smoked beers. but have never experienced one that so flawlessly delivers the smoke balanced with the base beer. I can see why this wins so many awards."
"If you see this and haven't had it then you need to buy it without a moment's hesitation. This is an absolutely fantastic porter."
"Thick rocky head, dark brown to black in color, lots of small streams of visible bubbles - 4.00, S: Tons of smoke, strong mesquite, as well as dark bitter baker's chocolate, I also pick up some bacon and espresso - 4.50, T: Like the nose there is significant smoke on the palate, I also pick up some slight sour which seems out of place, quite a bit of charring and ash, gritty dark malts with some chocolate and burnt coffee - 4.00, M: Thick and heavy mouth feel - 4.50, D: Very nice and very drinkable smoked beer - 4.00"
"D - this is a really good smoked porter. This one has been on my radar for a long time; I am glad I finally got to try it, and on tap taboot."
"1 is not enough. I hope to procure a 10' vintage for comparison soon!"
"2001, opened 10/2011: Holy moly, what a treat. Still plenty of carbonation and a HUGE aroma of sweet cocoa, caramel, smoke, espresso, and dark fruit. The smokiness really dominated the flavor and took on a salmony quality."
"This brings out mixed emotions for me. On the one hand, I'm sitting here looking at it quizzically...while gulping it down like there's no tomorrow. Even among smoked porters, the cocoa puts this one in a different league & helps keep the smokiness from lifting off through the roof. Overall? Very good beer. But you'll forgive me if I won't have another for a long time. I mean, after I finish my wife's glass, too. What?"
"Tastes of smoked malts (duh), fruitiness, chocolate and some bitterness."
"This is by far one of the best smoked beers I have ever tasted. When describing this to friends I tell them to imagine a bar-b-que in your mouth. Everything from smoked salmon to ribs, steak and mushroom on a skewer, this beer delivers wildly on the nose but really kicks in on the mouthfeel. Take as much time as you need letting it work across your tongue and down the back of your throat. You have just had the BEST Alaska can offer."
"overall - very drinkable at 6.5%. smokey flavor is nice. just not a huge porter fan..."
"D: This was a very smoky beer, but it's incredibly well integrated with the other flavors. The result is a fantastic and complex brew that's not difficult to drink, but much better to sip. Tons of boldness and depth, especially given the relatively low ABV. I'm curious how this is fresh, but I'm more curious how it is with 10+ years on it. Great beer."
"drink is good in the sense of it is something different to drink every once and a while. But besides maybe with a bbq I coudnt imagine having this on many other occasions"
"d - I thought this was a great porter; to me it was one of the highlights of SAVOR. I loved the smell and it also had a well balanced taste. Would love to have again."
"Drinkability: I'd had the pleasure of trying this beer once before, courtesy of a generous BA at the 2010 Sexual Chocolate release. That beer was like drinking liquefied, charred beechwood ... and it was also a 2006. I'm amazed by the difference two years can make on this beer, and love that you can get such a range of flavors out of it. Want your smoked porter to taste like bacon? Set it down for at least 4 years. Only prefer a twinge of smoke? Better keep it fresh. But, hell, at 6.5% you can afford to do both in one evening. The best smoked porter I've ever had and (from what I've heard) one of the best if not the best out there, this is a must try if you like the style, and if you don't - like I didn't, at least, prior to this one - you should give it a shot anyway. Stellar."
"D: I'd be happy to drink this anytime. Solid."
"Pours a beautiful dark brown, nearly black color, with garnet highlights and some creamy tan head. Very smoky aroma here, almost campfire-like, bacon and roasted malt. Flavors of roasted malt, chocolate and coffee blend nicely with the smoke. Still the standard for smoked porters."
"On a positive note this made for a mean chili. I won't be drinking this again but will be buying it to it in a pot of chili. The smokiness pairs nicely with meat and spice."
"Dark brown, basically opaque with a light tan head that fades to a thin ring and thick sheets of lacing. Aroma is very sweet, slightly metallic and rubbing alcoholish with strong smoked malt aroma. Body is light medium full with mild carbonation. Flavor is much better than the aroma, very smoky and silky smooth. Strong milk chocolate and roasted notes, very little bitterness or hops. Not the best porter, but overall an extremely enjoyable smoked beer."
"this is a damn fine porter, I can imagine that a cask version of this would produce tons more aromas and flavors. Very complex and delicious."
"What a magnificent beer! The nose is delicate and smoky, earthy and chocolatey (more chocolate than I remember other vintages being) , a little bit of green/grassy fire. Roast, chocolate, a mild coffee note are all present, Age brings out the sweetness/ caramel notes. The palate opens with a blend of sweetness - caramel, coffee, burnt sugar - and roast with a hint of smoke. Earthy bitterness is present. Not as acidic as the 07 was. Fantastic, long-lasting finish. Scores stand."
"- Overall this is one of the best porters I have had. The flavor is almost perfect, and the flavor that sneaks up in the end is even better.... Alaskan does it again."
"Price is decent, you can usually get into it for around $6. Its just a straight up porter without any extreme tricks (other than being extreme before there was extreme beer I guess)."
"Cheerio!"
"I was really looking forward to this and sadly came away pretty disappointed."
"Quite drinkable."
"D: despite the prominent smoke, age definitely mellowed out the intense smoke of a fresh batch, very enjoyable despite light mouthfeel"
"Pours a nearly opaque black-brown with about a finger of tan bubbly head. Laces very well, very thickly. The nose has a healthy dose of smoked ham, along with some dark malts, molasses, and charcoal. The taste generally follows, with that smoked ham really taking center stage (and boy, is it ever tasty!). Along with that, the dark malts and charcoal are the most prominent, with the molasses, brown sugar, and subtle bitterness hanging around in the background. The body is quite medium, with minor carbonation and a smooth, borderline watery feel. Overall, a very tasty and very highly drinkable brew, especially for those who dig both porters and rauchbiers."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D-This was a great to finish out the night, but I couldn't imagine having more than a pint of it. Very rich and filling."
"D: I'm glad I tried it and I was lucky to find a 2008 on the shelf, but it's a little too one-dimensional for me -- I wish the malt and chocolate flavors which only peek through had more power. Glad I tried it though."
"This beer is like silk. So smooth and creamy; I'd like to wrap up in this next to the fire. Subtle carbonation throughout. The cocoa and coffee comes out a bit in the flavor as well, and leaves a bit of a charred flavor in there as well. The smoky character comes out in the backend, leaving a roasted aftertaste. This is not overpowering with smoke, rather, there is a great balance with the Porter flavors and smokiness. Well done. I'm gonna store away the other 2 bombers I got of this and try them in a few years or so. Recommend."
"Comes out of the bottle a deep opaque coffee-brown with an OK beige head. Rich, smoky aroma has an odd vinyl-like component to it - odd yeast? Hops?. Smoky, coffee-like flavor has a strong hint of molasses. Texture is smooth, fairly tingly and quite lively."
"Lighter in the mouthfeel but at 6.5 it is acceptable for the style. Highly drinkable also because of this"
"Mouthfeel is medium-full with a creamy amount of carbonation."
"Drinkability: All I can really say is this could possibly be the quintissential bbq beer."
"D: Enjoyable with a rich roasted and smoky malting that was very smooth going down. The smoky nature is perfect in bringing out a sensation of a fireplace burning amidst an Alaskan wilderness. A beer perfectedly suited for, and by its environment bringing that Alaskan feel to the lower 48 for those to enjoy its majestic pleasure."
"D: This could work very well with certain meals, it's not really something I would want to drink a lot of on its own."
"Drinkability: Not hard to drink at all--not even one to sip, really. Drank a glass of this this over the course of an hour or so waiting to get my bottles. Pretty good--not sure I'd seek out another in a trade, but I'd definitely drink it again if the chance came up. As a disclaimer, I'm not really a huge fan of the smoky taste and haven't had too many smoked beers, anyway, so this is a new style I'm getting into. That said, seeing as the taste wasn't particularly smoky in and of itself, I'm not sure that this particularly affected my review :)"
"Very good, but it falls just a little short of greatness when compared to something like the more potent Sue (Yazoo's cherry-wood smoked porter)..."
"D: intense on the smoke and peat taste. if you like those, then very drinkable on a crisp day."
"D- excellent, awesome example of the innovation on my favorite style"
"Overall I feel I misjudged this beer. I first had it many years ago and was put off by the flavor. Over the years my palate has changed and this is truly a world class beer that deserves all it's rewards...and then some. Excellent porter and an amazing beer all-around."
"Have had this sample of the 2006 vintage ASP in my possession for over 3 years now... For at least the past 2.5 years, it has been in the fridge, but before that was being kept at above cellar temps, as high as 85oF but usually in the mid-70s for say, 4-6 months. Major demerits for me. Pours just shy of pitch black in my snifter and is topped by a permanent creamy brown head that fades somewhat but always retains a cover and very thick, clingy, just-a-bit-too-wet-and-thick-to-properly-lace collar (it sort of melts down the side of the glass as the beer is consumed.) Big, sweet, rich, robust notes of leather, dark fruit, carob, coffee-soaked bubblegum, Jolt cola, with all of these wrapped in a sturdy blanket of smoke and campfire goodness. Some meaty, salty notes as well. Condensed maple syrup. The faintest tang of citrus struggles to escape, but is coated in the heavy tar and treacle notes that anchor this beer as close to the earth as possible. The beer is much less intense on the palate than I expected based on the nose; the nose is heavy, almost overbearing, thick and virtually like liquid in the nostrils--you feel it filling your nose, like drowning. But the flavor, while big and rich, is not nearly as heavy or imposing as I thought it would be. All the hallmarks of a robust porter, with subtle spikes of cola, leather, maduro cigar/tobacco, black cherries, and a clean woodsy note, distinct from the also present smokiness. Fresh balsa. Burning sea driftwood (think salty smoke.) The finish is gentle and kind--a comforting level of smoke that sits so well in the mix of this very tasty beer. Never gets to coffee in the flavor, despite what one might expect for the style. Instead, it's bark and billows. As it warms, the alcohol speaks up a bit on the nose, sharpening some of the acridity and coaxing out the edginess of the citrus hop notes, and on the palate evoking notes of dark rum. I am not disappointed by this beer--let me be clear. But it is not as complex as I expected. Sort of the hype syndrome--where you hear or read how great a movie (or beer) is and then when you see (drink) it, you can't be completely objective and rate it lower than if you'd just waltzed into the theater (or bar) not knowing what to expect. Can't help but think that if I just stumbled across this without knowing from day one (and every day since, as it's been in my possession for over 3 years--calling to me as I fought temptation) that it was the holy grail of smoked porters, that I'd have flipped shit over how awesome it was. Instead I enjoy it as a great beer that is pleasing, but is not rousing my inherent beer geek fanaticism. This is not a proclamation of overratedness. Far from it. This is great beer that I'm pleased to have had the opportunity to try. Thanks to Jabocu for the trade/sample (all those years ago!)"
"Pours a very deep and dark jet black color. Nose is roasted dark malts and chocolate with a bit of smoke. Taste has a strong smoky wood and charcoal flavor with roasted malts, dark fruits, and bitter coffee.Medium mouthfeel with low carbonation. Find this to be quite different from Stone's Smoked Porter but it was interesting though."
"Pours dark brown with an off-white head. The aroma is lots of smoke with some roasted malts. The flavor is heavy omn the smoke but you also get some standard porter characteristics like dark malts. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation. I really like this beer, but if you are not into smoked beers, this is probably not the beer for you."
"D: love this stuff -- really need to try it with the ham someday"
"2007 version: Poured a very dark brown with a nice tan head with decent carbonation. The smoke flavor was very detectable, even on the pour I smelled a little. Smelled of perhaps a smoked meat, some coffe and chocolate behind the smoke. Tasted the same as the smell. Smoke behind some chocoloate and coffee. Thinner bodied but a very good Smoked Porter indeed!!!"
"Drinkability- Excellent, I loved it. Very nice smoked porter"
"Drinkability- I can't see myself drinking these all night."
"D-i am not a fan but the intent is to bring smokiness and it does, it has a nice taste of sweet malts with a solid mouthfeel."
"OVERALL very easy drinking if you like the style. This was my stand by at the Red Onion Saloon when the had it on tap, but now that they don't, it's an occasional treat."
"Pours a near black, deep dark brown with nice rich, creamy dark khaki colored head. Great retention, lacing sticky at the top of the glass, then very little towards the end. Scent is of earth, smoke, wood with a background of dark roasted cocoa and coffee beans. Flavor is a reverse of the scent with rich dark roasted coffee and cocoa beans up front backed by a wonderfully earthy smoke and wood flavor. Body is light for the style with some grainyness to it. Excellent beer from Alaskan and a pleasure to drink a beer with such an earthy charachter. Many smoked beers end up tasting like pure liquid smoke or even worse, bacon. This beer got it perfect."
"650ml bomber purchased by my dad at Khoury's Fine Wine & Spirits in Las Vegas, Nevada. Appearance is blackish and stout-like with a bubbly, dark brown cap. A few dots of lacing on the glass, good head retention. Smell is faint, charcoaled smoke and leather, not as strong as a baltic porter. Black chocolate in the taste, some roasted malt, and burnt berry fruit. Big blast of spice and bitterness from the hops, followed by smoke and ash flavours. The chalky, parched aftertaste has very little sweetness. Mouthfeel is velvety and oily. Smooth dryness in the finish. A satisfying brew with a little less character than I expected. Good stuff overall."
"I would also like to try it fresh to see how the year or so worth of age this bottle has on it has affected it."
"Vintage 1998 - This 11 year old vintage was a complete mess, it lost all the smokiness and roasted flavors. It tasted like soy sauce and after a few sips got introduced to my sewer system."
"Overall:"
"D: I love smoked beers, this is nicely blended and rather tasty. Goes down easily, lighter body and ABV make this a beer that I would sit with for a bit."
"D - Drinkability is good. Alcohol is hard to pick up which helps it go down a little easier. The smoke is strong in this one. If that's your thing, you'll like this. If not, let it age a while or drink it pretty warm. Some complexity comes through as it warms. A 22 ounce bottle seems about right for this one. It gives the opportunity to experience the full range of flavors going on here. All in all, the Smoked Porter is a good smoked beer and I was stoked to get one from a fellow western BA member. Now I'm intrigued as to how the flavors would develop over time..."
"Kudos Alaskan"
"D: I'm just thinking that although this is pretty good, if you werent prepared for the onslaught of smoke, you would be in trouble with an entire bomber."
"I think the previous bottle may have been infected. I eventually got another bottle, this one of the 2009 vintage, and it's drinking very well. Less savory/meaty than I remember, but still plenty of smoky goodness. Mouthfeel is still a little thinner than I'd like, but good."
"Overall a great smoked beer. I can't see myself ever having this in a regular rotation, but as a once in awhile special beer this is fabulous. Sit by a warm fireplace when snowing outside and really enjoy what this beer is about."
"D - The taste of Porters will always be underwhelming to me, because Edmund Fitzgerald is my favorite Porter to date, but this is a great beer, just can't see myself shipping for this when I can get the Edmund Fitz"
"Glad I got to try this absolute legend in the craft community. Thanks for the goodness, Alaskan - this is one amazing beer."
"*Strongly influenced by fellow tasters"
"The beer is medium-bodied and well carbonated the drinkability suffers a bit from the overly strong smokey-sweet aftertaste that just doesn't seem to go away (not in a good smokey way, but a kind of weird sweet way, no real description for it). Overall a good beer that I'm glad I got to try."
"Overall: This is one of the best smoked beers I've had. The smoke is very noticeable but you don't feel like you're drinking a campfire. I think the porter can stand up to the smoke and the dark chocolate and coffee flavors complement the smokiness. No off flavors. Would definitely recommend this one."
"the finish is a bit surprising, something that looks and tastes so burly is actualy much lighter bodied than you might expect which lends to its drinkability. the smoke hangs on to the very end but the malt sweetness gets more of a chance at the tail end of the finish to shine through as well. it is no wonder this beer is so awardwinning, it really is a great one and fun to age to compare the differences (at 2.89 a bottle there's no reason not to stock up around here). i look forward to the new release each year!"
"The 2009 Alaskan smoked porter pours a jet black color in the glass with a chick tan froth. The brew is dominated by smoked malts ( however not over smoked like a rauchbier, but balanced and elegant), slightly blackened bacon, subtle timber, fresh espresso, & dark chocolate. Great mouthfeel and a long finish. A great beer that I'm definitely going keep in my cellar...esp. since these beers can age with elegance."
"Other comments: OK, finally tried this beer. One I have been curious about for a long time but just never seemed to run into in stores or bars for whatever reason. Then I found a bottle of 2008 at The Beermongers (Portland, OR) and snapped it up. It did not disappoint. A great beer that definitely deserves its acclaim. I'm definitely going to try to find a couple of bottles of 2009."
"A good porter: very tight, clean smoked malt flavors. Could be a tad chewier in the middle."
"On tap and from the bottle, disappointment is a word this beer does not know! This wonderfully made porter is dry, roasty, and chocolatey with medium carbonation, a drinkable, light/medium body, and balanced hop bitterness. This would be great on its own. But the alder smoked barley blends in with enough strength that you know this is SMOKED porter, while still allowing you to enjoy the other flavors of the porter."
"D- I've had a few brews that claimed to be ""smoked"" but so far this one wins. Huge flavor and very drinkable."
"Notes: Man, I usually like smoked beers, and I usually love porters, but this version of a smoked porter just didn't sit well with me. I thought I was going to like it based on the aroma, but was a bit underwhelmed by the flavor profile. However, the mouthfeel of this beer was a major let-down. It just didn't offer near enough in the way of heft to let the flavors shine as brightly as they could. A bit disappointed considering all the hype surrounding this brew."
"M/D: Robust and nice carbonation feel in the mouth. Smell was stronger then taste but very easy to drink and could get you in trouble."
"D: A very drinkable beer. Alaskan brewing hit the nail on the head with this one!"
"Good, but as good as it's made out to be? Difficult to say."
"I have had this several times. Most recently at a BA tasting thanks to armock. I also enjoyed several of these on a recent trip to Montana. I always enjoy it, but it is not among my favorites for smoked porters."
"Well I had Stone Smoked Porter(good, but not very ""smoked"") and this beer would have to be the true definition of a Smoked Porter. Pretty much liquid campfire. To the point, where it was not very enjoyable. Tasted like smoke, barbecue sauce, soy sauce, and a little meaty. Don't think I'd recommend this one, but if you like smoke, then go for it."
"The ABV helps the drinkability here. The smell is great, but the intense smokey flavors in this beer may be an acquired taste. I would recommend cellaring this for a couple of years to allow the acidity to lessen."
"I have a bottle from 2008 that I can't wait to try as well. I'll do a review of that one when I pop it open."
"Drinkability: With its relatively lighter body and good balance, this one is just that much more drinkable and it can become quite difficult not to grab a few bombers and drink yourself into a stupor on the couch. It's a beer I'm always happy to have regardless of vintage or time of year it happens to be."
"Brought a 2007 back from my Summer 2008 trip to Alaska. Drank it 2 September 2009. I had it on-tap in Juneau at the Hangar. Wanted to compare it to the bottle. Still great!! The flavors might be a little less intense than on-tap, but the aging made this much smoother. With the fresh, I thought 22 oz would be enough. With the 2007 bottle, I could have swilled this all afternoon. Still black color, nice size tan head and thick lacing. The smoky smell and taste still dominate over the malt and coffee and there is still a smoked salmon type of flavor lurking around there somewhere. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. The smokiness is just right. Drinkability is better than I remembered with the fresh...just a great beer."
"Overall, I'm glad I got to try this much-talked about beer. There is some good flavor here, and would be great with some chocolate dipped bacon...for a smoke beer, it holds its own."
"Smooth lightly carbonated porter couldn't think of anything better with a nice juicy steak."
"D - Easily one of the best examples of smoked beers on the market. Quite tasty, complex and extremely drinkable."
"If you get an opportunity, save some of this each year for a vertical tasting. You'll notice some incredible, delicious changes as the beer ages."
"Overall, not bad, but a little too smoky for me. Probably one of the most smoke flavored beers I have had. I am glad I am not the only one drinking this bottle, as it would take work to finish this bomber."
"I really enjoyed this beer. Thanks to Ben for giving me a chance to try a beer I otherwise would have no business trying. I will definitely seek this out in the future, and would be glad to have it again."
"D: Very, very, very drinkable. A truly wonderful beer. The accolades are well deserved. My hat is off to Alaskan Brewing Co."
"In the range of smoked porters, I'd rather have an East End or Stone, but this is still worthy once it warms a bit."
"Drinkability: it's incredibly tasty, but definitely not a session beer. My example was pretty highly carbonated, so that added to a filling sensation which would limit how much of this you could drink. That said, the taste really makes me want another."
"D - Pretty good beer."
"D - I found this to be a very drinkable, delicious offering. Great, complex combination of flavors and a pronounced smokiness that doesn't overpower the other flavors completely. Really enjoyed this beer and will hopefully try it again."
"D: Overall, this is a very nice beer. Bested paired with sharp cheeses and smoked or grilled meats. A perfect beer to pair with the aforementioned foods and pretty decent on its own too."
"Pours out black with tints of dark brown. About a 1cm inch tan head that stays around for a while. The smell is amazing - basically just like a barbeque, or liquid smoke. The taste is dominated by that smoky roasted malt flavor and then becomes slightly bitter on the finish. Aftertaste is pretty much just like smoke. As if you'd melted chunks of snow on a campfire, made it into water, and used that water to brew a beer. Though...it's not as crazy smoked as a traditional German Rauchbier. I think a lot of people would have trouble drinking lots of this, but I could definitely drink several and be happy."
"Pours a dark brown, to almost black. The head was about a finger's width with a tan to medium brown color. The smell was almost a sweet smoke. It was really an interesting smell. Never smelled a beer quite like it. The flavor was a very intense smoke, with a hint of sweetness, I presume from the malts. It was a strong flavor... almost all smoke. Just a hint of the malt flavor. I couldn't detect any hops flavor, but perhaps just a hint of fruitiness. All in all I quite enjoyed it. I'd get it again for sure."
"D - This is a great smoked porter at the top of the category for me. The way the attention to keeping the smoke high in the taste without overtaking the the spice of the hops or the flavor of the malt is great. I can't wait to taste this beer again now that I have had it aged and fresh."
"anyway, this is at its core just a simple, easily drinkable yet flavorful beer. i liked it quite a bit."
"It's a robust smoked beer, and certainly something to be reckoned with. Quite full of smoke character, but elsewhere it just feels a tad thin."
"I found it heavy going, but managed to finish the bottle, cheese and crisps helped me see it off."
"D. Very well balanced beer. Smokiness is not overpowering. I probably would not want to have more than 1-2 of these in a sitting. It is a very tasty beer though."
"I have never had a smoked beer that I liked - until now. A tan head faded after the pour but was quite easy to regenerate. Ring had staying power with medium carbonation in a cola-black brew. Not much lace to speak of. Yes, there was the smell of smoke but it wasn't overpowering; call it gently smoked. Some cocoa and coffee to a lesser extent. Taste was equal parts smoke and bitter-sweet chocolate porter. This beer tasted quite good with nice balance and a clean aftertaste. Astringency held in check, overall it drank like a good flavourful porter with a smoky backdrop, quite nice, I recommend you try this beer if you get a chance."
"You don't have to love rauchbiers to enjoy, much less appreciate, Alaskan's Smoked Porter. How they capture the distinctive qualities of a smoked beer and still manage to show off a robust, flavour-packed porter I'll have to leave it up to the brewer to explain. One thing I can tell you myself - it's worth spending every cent you can afford to stock up the cellar with it. Smoked beer is an important remnant of traditional beer making and this is indeed a very special beer."
"Overall, a quality beer. My only gripe is that I wish the flavor was as complex as the aroma. Just seemed a little too one dimensional as the smokiness overshadowed much of the beer."
"Drinks pretty nice. I definitely recommend aging this beer for a couple of years as the campfire seems to mellow a bit yet the carbonation holds firm. Also, in my bottle there was no oxidation present at all. The only thing that sets this back a little for me is that the smoke/campfire taste can grow to be a little much if you're trying to finish the bomber on your own, even after aging to mellow it."
"Overall, probably the best smoked porter I've had to date. Flavor is interesting and unified. Smokey quality adds an interesting depth to this beer. A must try. I would love to pair this with some sharp cheddar cheese."
"Easy to drink and enjoyable, I wish this was readily available in the midwest, I would drink this regularly."
"The taste is up front smoked stewed prunes (with a burnt character but no caramelised quality), fairly sweet. This quickly loses most sweetness and becomes more bitter and burnt-tasting in quality with a hint of bitter chocolate but light on the chocolate taste. It soon tastes mostly of burnt leaves and twigs with hints of black pepper and smoked prunes, mostly burnt and bitter. The feel is fairly smooth and creamy, and overall good. Over time, it kind of grew on me a bit, and it's good, but it is, except for the smokey flavour, a bit thin and bland in character."
"This for me is not a session-able beer, and I could only knock down one or two per sitting, but very enjoyable especially if you love peaty/smoky scotches as I do."
"Overall I would say this is a great porter, the smoked malts really add a nice character to the beer. I will be buying more of this."
"A low abv and a well-controlled smoke flavor make this very drinkable."
"This is not a daily sipper, it needs an occasion... like a raging forest fire."
"D: Pretty good. A little too smokey, maybe another year and it would be more to my liking. All in all though a very solid brew."
"Overall this beer didn't disappoint. The nice thickness and sheer amount of smokiness set this apart from other smoked porters I've had - definitely worth a shot."
"Easy drinkin..could really knock back a few."
"Pours a dark brown with faint reddish highlights on the extreme edges. Thinnish tan head dissipates almost instantly. Smells like a forest fire. Charred wood and burnt plastics meld with some chocolate and roast. Taste is chocolate and roast with that smoked burnt wood character. Carbonation is ample almost prickly, body is medium, mouthfeel is creamy smooth. Great smoked porter. Lots of smoked/burnt character. This is not something I'd drink everyday, but it's a nice sipper."
"A good brew although I was expecting more."
"Buy it, forget about it for a few years, profit."
"22oz. Rather dark brown almost black pour. Not a huge dark cream colored head. It did last a while though. Roasty malt, peat some bitter chocolate aromas. Tastes quite similarly. Earthy, peaty malt with quite a bit of coffee and smoke. Some hints of chocolate throughout. Medium bodied lively enough to not be creamy. The bittering is what sets this apart from just an average or good porter. Nice roast finish. Drinkability is pretty good, the bite takes away from this just a bit. Worth trying."
"This is a fairly drinkable beer, but I don't think that it would be good for more than one in a session. I think that the smoke would become too much."
"D: The edge in drinkability went to the 05 which was super smooth. Both vintages were extremly drinkable though. I would say drink at least one fresh to experience that unbridled smoke. Excellent."
"D - Quite easy to drink, very plesant. Let it warm up a bit and try it with some smoked meats."
"D: Medium heavy on the alcohol, and pretty good for a smoked beer."
"Pours black color with some ruby tones. Almost no head. Smell - very smokey malts, some chocolaty notes, quite nice. Taste - strong smokiness hits at first, followed by some hoppy betternes, finishes pretty sweet with some raisiny fruitiness. Well ballanced, smooth. Medium body. Very rich. It's drinkable, but by the ebd of the bomber it just became too smokey for me. But overall it is a very good brew."
"A very nice beer. The smokiness is very present and bold, but doesn't overpower the beer like many rauchbiers. The nice roasty malt melds perfectly with the smokiness. Love it."
"I'll have to try this one again, someday."
"I enjoy a smoked porter, but this one was overpowering on the smoke smell & taste. Don't know if the aging make the smoke taste so overpowering . I'd like to try a fresh bottle to compare, too bad I can't get it here in Central Florida. Because of the overpowering smoke taste I experienced with this 2 year old, I would not recommend aging this one."
"Complex standout beer with 2006 the best."
"The smoke is unmistakable. It is overwhelming- too much to be pleasant. Hiding beneath that though are some notes of chocolate malt and roasted flavors, but the smoke is taking center stage. A bit much for me really, but I would be interested to see how this develops over time (this was 2008 vintage). The over-smokiness really took away from the drinkability. Slick mouthfeel- this was a bit tough to drink more than a few ounces of."
"M/D: The feel is sugary and creamy with a bite on the tongue. The drinkability is good and is something to savor not gulp down."
"I've also had the 2007 version, which I would rate a little lower, as the smoke really dominated that brew. My recommendation is drink this fresh rather than age it, as the smoke will tend to dominate over time. Of course, if you can't get enough of all the smokey goodness, simply disregard what I just said."
"D - Excellent and easy to drink and very enjoyable. Can't wait to try some aged. More flavor comes out as it warms up"
"Brown medium sized head. Color is pitch black. Aroma is smoky, coffee, chocolate. Starts with a lot of roasty coffee, chocolate, but not much smoke. Smokiness develops, becmong stronger throughout and lingering in the aftertaste. Finishe is bittersweet. Would get this again."
"Overall: great experience"
"8/4/8/4/15 (3.9/5)"
"Would definitely try again, and the drinkability on this pretty good but I'm good after one glass."
"Overall. I really think that I like this beer. I was unsure about drinking a smoked beer. But hey, give me some smoked pork sandwiches and this beer and I will be in heaven. The mouth feel is creamy and slightly carbonated. The finish is surprisingly bitter where it allows the drinker to find the hops in this beer. I like that there decent balance between the smoke and the beer, well it is kinda heavy on the smoke. I feel that the beer could have more flavor too it. Other than that it is a really good beer."
"D. I could drink this all day...literally. This is one beer that lives up to the hype TOTALLY. The absolute best smoked Porter I have ever had, bar NONE!"
"D: Very drinkable. The bomber was done before I knew it. Very nice flavors all blend well and it certainly lives up to its smokey title."
"Outstanding, even this young a vintage, and a clear demonstration why this beer is the benchmark for the smoked porter style, and even rauchbier generally. Intensely drinkable, since I like intense beers."
"M&D - it was drinkable, smooth and easily sipped, but the flavor was just too much at times, i was unprepared for its aromatic and flavorful girth, would compliment any sort of BBQ dish perhaps, i let this one sit for over a year, maybe that was a mistake"
"D - I could tolerate the smoked flavor but I know it isn't something I'd actively try to get my hands on. Definitely drinkable."
"tastes is mindblowing dark fruit, roasted malts, a huge smokey presence. the smoke that is so coy and teasing in a good scotch ale has come out of its shell and is putting on quite the show in this brew. I bought this beer as a novelty, i thought i would drink one, and trade the rest, but damn that or the 6 i bought only one made it back from california and its days are numbered."
"Pours dark brown to black, with minimal head and little retention. The aroma is one of this beer's best features, all roasty, smoky, and peaty. Thin hit yields quickly to a big meaty taste. This one could stand up to just about any food you could pair it with. Finish brings a faint roasted chocolate flavor, but the peatiness is what I take away."
"Merry X-Mas everybody!"
"Notes: I guess I was really spoiled when I started drinking beer. Frankly, I can't find a Porter I like more than Edmund Fitzgerald, and lemme tell you... I've tried."
"Cheers!"
"Good beer verging on great is the bottom line for me. This side of Germany there isn't quite the smoked beer culture, so seeing such a prominent example of a smoky, flavorful beer is great."
"Gets better as it warms up. For me, it takes a few minutes for my taste buds to adjust to the smoke and then the beer tastes better and better. I prefer this to Stone Smoked Porter - the only other smoked beer that I can buy with regularity."
"2008 vintage. Poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a heavy chalice. An appropriate amount of head. I tend to pour more gently as I'm not a big fan of big head. A good looking color, perhaps a little darker than most porters. About the amount of lacing that was expected given the pour. The smoke aroma was quickly apparent upon pouring.The smokiness seems to cover most of the usual porter aromas. The smoke is obviously the first thing you taste, but is followed by the traditional porter roastiness. This beer did not have as much body as is my experience with the style. I could drink a couple of these in a row, but suspect my palate would quickly tire. A fine beer, I'm glad it comes around every year."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, sweet up front, leading to an all out smoke filled attack on the palate. Mild notes of bitter cocoa, and mineral earthiness are abound."
"Good feel and drinkability with a moderate ABV. The intensity of the smoke does diminish with exposure as the taste buds adjust. Rather pleasant."
"2005. This is an incredible porter. Pour is black with brown bubbles one could consider the head. The aroma is smoky and heavy with malt. The taste is perfect. Smoked malts do not overwhelm the light coffee tones, but are very well balanced. Smooth and thick enough to enjoy repeatedly."
"D: They say the smoke serves as a preservative and you can age this low ABV like big beers or wine, which will smooth it out a bit and undoubtably work to aid the feel at the same time. I think this will be an excellent porter with a year or so on it."
"Best Smoked Porter in the world."
"Notes: Last years (2007) smoked porter was not as good as this years beer. I remember last years offering as having a bit of an acidic quality (at least in the bottle that I tried). This year that is gone. A highly recommended brew."
"I am usually very fond of Porters but this was not to my liking. I thought it was too dry and too sweet. It looked chocolaty red and smelled like a woodsy mocha coffee but the taste really killed it for me. All I can say is try it if you must try everything but not worth seeking."
"Drinkability is good if you can handle the 6.5%. You won't notice it right away. Good tasty beer."
"the subtle layers are smooth, balanced and continue to impress with every sip. best smoked porter or smoked beer i've ever had"
"I have another veritcal ready to go!"
"A solid and extremely smoky porter that could use some aging. The beer pours a nice black-brown with a healthy head, a pleasant surprise as I wasn't expecting much. It smells like a smokehouse that makes summer sausage and smoked salmon. This flavor and smell would probably smooth with age, but I know very little about cellaring. The taste is mostly smoke with some sweet chocolate or coffee, struggling to make it through the thick haze of smoke. I imagine cellaring for a long period would allow the other flavors to brighten up and smooth out the smoke. The feel is good, bubbly and mouth-coating. Drinkability is high despite the oddly flavored smoke, but it still detracts. I'm going to pick up another bottle and hide it away in my storage with a note that says do not drink for at least one year."
"As I said it reminds me of good times with my grandfather god bless his soul. It is a smoked beer that is truely smoked. I love it and crave some more."
"I think it might have benefitted from some aging to mellow a bit."
"2005 bottle thanks to Eric, shared over some Turkey and Pumpkin Pie. Pours a deep black with a mocha colored head. The aroma, wow! Smoked bacon, wood chips, beef jerky, and a forest fire. The taste was more of a porter, though the smokeyness did come in. A burnt malt and some sweet fruity flavors comes through. The body was a bit thin, but overall quite good. A really unique beer that goes great with food and the holidays."
"This is my first smoked porter, so I don't have much context within which to review, but overall I'm pretty impressed. Very dark brown with big tan head. Smell and taste are primarily of campfire smoke and dark chocolate. The smoke is great. This is a great beer for a cold night on a ski trip or for sitting around a campfire. With fairy low ABV, you can finish this bomber no problem."
"22 oz bottle year 2008. Pours a nice darkish, tan head,some lacing.over a black body...nose of malts and smoke, only minimal hop aromas....tastes of malt initially, then smoke, finishing with a nice hop. Pleasant, although not outstanding mouth feel. Nice balance and it seems to meet the style. I'd like to store a few to taste its evolutiion."
"This brew was crisp, smooth, and not too heavy on the tounge. I would definitely drink this beer again, but am having some trouble deciding if I like this one better or Stone's Smoked Porter. Hmmm ..."
"Drinkability is good. Not my favorite porter but definately the best "" smoked porter "" that I've had. Easy to drink a bomber of."
"Drinkability is good. A little to much towards the stout side, but overall its good."
"Alaskan Smoked Porter is one big porter not intended for the weak. It's good on its own, but this might be one of the better beers to cook with."
"Love the drinkability."
"Pours an extremely dark body. Small head, off-white, quickly diminishing. Very smoky flavor. Not mesquite. Some malts. Fizzy flavor. Smokey & somewhat malty, dusty. Very good flavor. I can see this going great w/steaks and bbq."
"Purchased this beer as I waited for a flight at SFO. Way better than the crazy expensive meal that I bought with the beer. Great color, and the smoked, peated malt smell is very pleasant. Pours thick, with a cappucino colored head. One of the few smoked beers that I could drink more than one at a sitting."
"D= A really great porter that I will gladly try again. Complex yet still very drinkable. I have a bottle from 1999 that I need to crack open soon to see what nearly 10 years can do for this beer."
"D- I would definitely have this one again, of course this could be a particular bent toward smoked beers."
"Tasted this beer at several different bars in Alaska in their large bottles. Pours dark amd smokey.Taste, well, this beer is misnamed. It should be called a ""burnt porter."" The taste of ash in the beer predominates the overall flavor. The ash leaves an aftertaste in your mouth that lingers for several hours. I was very dissapointed and would rate this at most as a D."
"Pours a deep, dark brown with red tones. Thick, tan, enduring head that conceals the true smell of the brew. Had to tip to unveil a woody, whiskey, sweet, aroma with hints of chocolate and an overall smokey essence. First taste felt like a mouth full of flavorful but not so overbearing liquid smoke. As stated by many other BAs, the taste mellows out to reveal an ultra smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Very well balanced and much more complicated than my uneducated palate will allow. Awesome smell, awesome taste, awesome porter. Saved an even better rating only for if/when I get to taste some of this stuff aged."
"black with no head. smells of carmel, whiskey, smoke and malt. first sip is of delicious smoke flavor. the smokiness mellows out with each sip. it is incredibly smooth and drinkable. there is a mellow sweetness hidden in the flavors, pretty malty, but balanced great."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and thick with a spicy finish and ample carbonation."
"D - I find myself taking massive gulps from my glass and the bomber is almost gone in the time it took me to write this review. Yeah, it's drinkable."
"Thanks to howl1309 for the opportunity to try this one. 2007 vintage poured a deep brown with red highlights around the edges. Thin, soapy, off-white head; some lacing, no legs. A smoky character dominates the nose, as well as a hint of chocolate malt. Taste is beef jerky, smoky and slightly bitter at the finish. Chocolate is disguised in the mouth. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and effervescent with a light burn throughout the mouth. An interesting brew, but all and all, not to my general liking. I definitely needed help with this bomber."
"Drinkability - Solid, but not fantastic. The smokiness overwhelms a bit too much, and I was expecting a bit more with as many medals as its won."
"2007 vintage- pours a dark cola with quickly dissipating beige head. Nose- sweet smokiness and some dark fruits. Taste- initial wave of smoke, then blends into a fairly light bodied dry porter. Not much heft to it. Carbonation is on the high side. Finish is quite bitter. The smoke really makes the beer, otherwise would be a pretty boring porter. Drinkability is good."
"Drinkablity: A classic from Alaskan Brewing Company. Flavors evolve with as the beer ages."
"D: For the style and amount of smokiness, it's very drinkable. I wouldn't mind substituting this for water for the next 5 years."
"Smooth and well balanced. Unlike some smoked beers, this one isn't heavy or dominated by the smoke. That could be due to the age of the beer. I wasn't surprised that it went well with smokey BBQ ribs. However, it married well with the sweetness, spice and heat of the sauce."
"Drinkability: Would probably go great with certain meals or a good cigar, however two of us split this bomber and neither one of us wanted anymore of it."
"taste is thick and smooth, campfire smores just not as sweet, dark and milk chocolate, some coffee, creamy vanilla, nice and not overpowering smokiness, ends slightly dry and a little bitter with a definite smoke aftertaste."
"yeah, I'd buy a case of this. Enjoy if you get a chance."
"Re-review: had 2009 edition that I got at South Bay and shipped back on 11/10/09. Same scores and just as good. My prior review had some age so the smoke was more prevalant on this one. Bought a 2nd that I'm going to age for a few years (if I can) and see how it turns out."
"One thing though, I wish that they would just give smoked porters their own category."
"D: I highly recommend to the beer geeks. next time I will let it age a few months instead of days and ensure it's much warmer upon opening and then drinking. After reading other reviews, I can tell the beer was not given enough time to breath and perhaps the glassware difference hid some of the vanilla or chocolate flavors."
"Tasty, but the smoke flavor is a little overdone and just too strong at times, overpowering all other flavors."
"Serving info: 22 ounce bomber 2007 edition, thanks Pebkac for another fine gift. Pours dark mahogany, lovely tiny bubble, creamy dark tan head and then spotty lace. The nose here is pleasantly woody, smoky and of dark malts. Smooth, smooth mouthfeel, luxurious and fine as it crosses the tongue. Notes of the expected smoke, but its subtle and not of the ""hit over the head variety"". Also, dark malts, vanilla, malted milk, quite yummy stuff. Great balance and again smoothness, full flavor and well crafted porter porter, too bad this is not widely available in my area....Lived up to the hype."
"Pours a thick black with a small mocha head. Aroma is sweet chocolate and smoke. Flavor is light chocolate, roasty and big time smoky. Finishes long and mostly smoky. Medium bodied, rich texture. I really don't get the whole ""smoke"" concept."
"I really enjoyed this beer for its complexity and uniqueness. Most of all, the smoke flavors perfectly complement everything else the beer has to offer. Sampling at warmer temps is the only way to go, for that's when the beer really shines."
"D- This one is a sipper, not for the alcohol, but for the intensity of the smokey flavors"
"2007 vintage. black with a nice tan head that hlds well and leaves very pretty lace. nose is smoky of course... alderwood for sure, and i could swear i smell salmon too. notes of chocolate, coffee and vin. what the nose suggested is expressed in the taste in a very complex, well balanced manner, and followed by a touch of hop that produces an nice, dry finish. silky, medium full body. really a fine, fine beer, and a serious joy to drink. proper with smoked meats and nutty cheese, but i can imagine the smoke being a little too much for some after a few beers. too bad this is so hard to come by around these parts. maybe i'll have to take a trip there next summer. thanks alaska!"
"A classic from Alaska Brewing and a beer I look forward to every winter. Simply American craft brewing at its very, very best."
"Very smooth and tasty with great drinkability."
"Notes: This just became one of my favorite smoked beers. Wildly drinkable with a smoke character that is unmistakeably present, but also not terribly overpowering and allowing some other flavors to shine through. Gold Medal winner, and deservedly so. Recommended."
"Pours black, but dark brown when held to light. Light tan head with decent retention. Smell is obviously of smoke, but I also got some vegetal aromas as well. Taste was roasty, smokey, and some vegetal tastes also come forward. Was not really what I was expecting. Worth a try."
"M/D - Very creamy and full bodied. The taste is very strong which I feel limits the drinkability a touch, but a very good porter."
"D:Great smoked porter. There is certainly no mistaking the smoke."
"On liquid smoke."
"I have been transported to a stream of wild, smoked salmon. Wood chip smoke clouds dance over the palate and remain active beyond my expectation. Grizzly bears barbecue sausage, over charcoal lit with newspaper, and slightly overcook the links that are a little too close to the flame. For a moment I am sharing some herb with a nomadic Mongolain tribe, enjoying an aged Puerh Tea, then awaken to notice a small fish has found her way onto my toasted, everything bagel. A small serving of chocolate syrup sleigh-rides between my vocal chords and I'm hooked. May I remain in this wilderness, and enjoy possibly one of the tastiest, smoked beers for the rest of my days? Yes...I believe I can."
"Overall- Smooth easy drinking porter. a good dinner beer."
"Tasted on 6/6/08."
"M/D: Very comfortable on the tongue, smooth, a little creamy. Good drinkability. A very balanced beer. I don't think it was anything mind blowing, but I could easily drink this all night long."
"D: NICE beer, an excellent dessert beer, highly recommended."
"D- on its own, it is worth a try, would benefit greatly along side a rack of ribs or some smoked salmon."
"Overall, not very complex (chocolate and smoke), but it's fun. The aftertaste was a bit off, otherwise this would be higher."
"M/D- Carbonation levels are good but it's fairly viscous for a porter overall. It's overall a pretty mellow dark beer with a unique twist to it. Really good, went with the roast and potatoes tonight."
"The aroma is smoke, bread, caramel, nuts, slight coffee, earthy hop aroma. The taste starts smokey, moving to a sweet caramel feel that again moves to more sweet smokey bitterness, the body is a bit watery but balanced nicely in the overall finish. I paired this with some smoked pork, green beans, and sweet potatoes."
"a bit of campfire topped of with a standard porter. It's decent/good, but it's no Schlenkerla, in terms of genuine smokiness. Perhaps more quaffable, but not as exhilarating. Deep Brown Color with dark head. Nose is smokey with roast malt in there. Nice."
"Pours an opaque dark brown with a black center. 1 finger of foamy/creamy dark tan head has good retention and leaves behind some nice lacing. Smells of smoked sausage, roasted malts, chocolate, and a touch of grass. Tastes of caramel, smoked bacon, molasses, and earthy hops with a subtle roasted coffee and grassy hop presence in the finish. Medium in body with good carbonation, smooth with good smoky tones but not too intense and a crisp finish. Well balanced and easy to drink and not too heavy. Very enjoyable."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, forming a 1/2"" dark tan head over the opaque dark brown brew. Thick head mellows nicely, with plenty of sticky lace. Aroma is hearty sweet malts with smoke running through, a bit light on intensity. Taste balances dark grain sweetness with the smoke, and comes together very nicely. Mouthfeel and drinkability are superb. Always glad to enjoy this one."
"Great beer, happy to finally taste it."
"D: It's SO smoky, I kept thinking of what to drink it with next time. I came up with grilled Hamburgers, or BBQ ribs. I am probably going to substitute liquid smoke with this in my Salsa Recipies. Yummy."
"D: This is definitely one of the better smoked beers I've tasted and probably the most drinkable."
"D: Easily drinkable and a good change of pace."
"Thanks for sending me a real winner here Dan!"
"d: Lives up to its reputation as a great smoked beer. Wish I had some smoked gouda! Good stuff, but I still think I prefer O'Fallon Smoked Porter (could be my Missouri bias though)."
"The last time I tried this brew, I was in Vancouver, and just happened to find it by accident while travelling over the border in to Washington. I enjoyed it so much then, that I had to have it again. Poured in to my Portsmouth Brewery tulip glass a completely black color, with a good looking tannish white head. Literally no light is penetrating this one. Aroma is hard to put a finger on, as it is light, with some peat smoke, but not a whole lot else. Taste is full of interesting flavor. The smoke is such that it almost reminds me of smoked meat, or beef jerky. There is also a nice background of chocolate, and a somewhat bitter finish. Mouthfeel is heavier then I remember. I could probably finish a couple bombers of this, but will lay down my other bottle of it to age for a little while. I have to say that my second experience with this is as good as the first. Many thanks to Smokingmex for the opportunity. Cheers"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, nice kick, very good representation of style while adding the smoked element, if you're in the mood for the smokiness this is a good beer to drink for a long time."
"I could sip on this all night while enjoying some country ham and biscuits with red eye gravy... Its fabulous!! Well done, Alaskan!!!"
"Poured almost all of a 22 into an oversized pint glass. Pours a dark , but not quite opaque black (dark ruby translucence on the edges when light shines into the glass). A finger of dark tan head of tiny bubbles that turns into a lasting covering. Little lacing. The aromas going on here are marvelous: rich but not overwhelming smokiness, earthy peat, subtle chocolate notes. Has the smoke meat characteristic that a Rauchbier has but to a much smaller degree. Taste is smoothe and savory smoked malt that leaves an almost tanginess. This meets a strong roasted malt backing that comes together in a very unobtrusive complexity. This has such an impressive richness from the smokiness, but is amazingly drinkable. I would no doubt open another of these if one were in my possession. Highly recommended, especially for those fond of Rauchbiers. I could drink these any time of year. Perfect for winter or a cooler summer night in front of a campfire."
"D- I like this beer. It is too smoky to drink a ton of but really tasty overall."
"D- Picked up a few bottles in Vegas for a road trip through Utah. Now I'm out, ""town"" is 15 miles down a mountain and I feel like crying. Soon I will be back in Vegas to pick up more of these tasty treats to bring back to NY."
"A really easygoing smoked porter, not as overbearing as ones from Bamberg can be sometimes."
"D: This is a smooth, easy to drink beer. It is surprising that the smoke isn't overwhelming."
"2007 vintage. 22oz bottle poured into an imperial pint glass. Pours a . The aroma is dark and roasty with a good dose of smoke. The taste is dark roasted malts up front, with a lot of smoked flavors, a little bit of coffee and a bitter smoky finish. I was a little surprised by the lack of body in the mouthfeel. The carbonation is right on, but the body is a little thin. Overall, this is a really solid brew that is definitely worth seeking out, but I don't understand all the hype surrounding this particular offering."
"All and all, this is a good beer. I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I might, but it is very drinkable. If these came in six packs I would probably have 3 in a sitting. It's a little spendy and I might opt for a certain other smoked porter at half the price."
"The smoke flavor is not obtrusive at all, the bittering hops however, are (in my oppinion). The combination of smoke and chocolate maltiness made me sit and sip this beer for about an hour. I like it alot."
"I'd love to have this one while camping. I can just imagine a chilly evening, sitting around a campfire, sipping on this one!"
"I have wanted to try this beer for years so lets hope it lives up to the wait. As far as porters ho this is beautiful with a jet black body and an inch of dark tan head that fades to just a skim in a few minutes. Leaves a solid ring of lace. Nose is smokey sweet with meaty malt notes and hints toffee and over ripe plum. Smokey notes enter the mouth with waves of layers of wonderfully meaty dryness. You really notice the lack of sweetness up front but this is not a bad thing in this case. The smoked richness is even and well balanced throughout the palate. Hidden within this brew are some dark dry grape notes that show the signs af possibility for this beer to develop and age well. A dry bitterness paints the mouth entirely and creates a pleasant mouthfeel. Nicely drinkable."
"overall, i could easily drink a whole big bottle of this by myself, but would love to share with friends."
"D- Quite enjoyable and something a bit different too. It's a great experience in a bottle. I wouldn't mind getting another one of these and I probably will. I'd even have a second one in a night."
"2007 22oz. Bottle - Pours deep rusty brown with a small 1/8 inch, dark for tan head. Average lacing, slightly under carbonated. Smells of smokey malts, sweet almonds, liquorish. First sip is smooth, smokey, malty, followed by pleasant bitterness. As is warms, the complexity increases with tobacco, coffee, caramel, and chocolate slipping through the smokey malt. Not over smoked, not under smoked, this one gets it right. Very Drinkable"
"Mouthfeel is md-thin, but with a creamy character. Carbonation is a bit stronger than I would have liked, but I swirled strongly to get rid of it."
"Drinkability - Exceptional. This would be fantastic with smoked salmon. I will need to have some with the next bottle. Try this if you can. It does not disappoint."
"D = This is very drinkable, but I think the flavors are still not as belnded as they could be. I will be interested to see how this one ages."
"Poured into a snifter. ASP is onyx in color with a rich tan head. Low retention rate, with some mild lacing. Very sweet aromas. Breakfast cereal malts, and a lot of smoky characteristics. The smokiness is definitely on. Some bacon and smoked salmon flavors, tied together with some great roasted malts. Perfect carbonation level. Nice rich mouthfeel, but not heavy at all. A very nice change for me, but I think its a little too hyped from the beer community. Definitely worth a try but I didn't find it to be amazing."
"I might save one in case the smokiness mellows out with a little time."
"This is easily the best smoked porter I've had. I only wish it were more easily available to me. I'd really like to buy a few more of these and put them away for a couple years."
"D: Pretty complex beer, and one was enough for me, I'd like to try some of the other years to compare it to this one though."
"Very nice beer. The smoke isnt overpowering but still at a very good level. Very nicely done. Bought this one in Vegas. 2005 edition, It would be interesting to see how it compares fresh, but the bottle indicates it can be aged for years, and it seems to hold up well."
"This is a damn good beer that I could make a great session out of."
"I am going to cellar quite a bit of this to see how it ages over the years."
"I like it, but it's a bit too smoky for me to have more than once a year or so."
"This is one of my favorite beers. If you are a fan of smoked meats, Islay Scotch, or the way your clothes smell after being around a campfire, then this should be a no-brainer. Highly recommended."
"I enjoyed this beer. I wouldn't consider it a daily drinker, but it is definitely worthwhile if you can get your hands on it. Very interesting, and notable beer."
" F- If your a fan of any campfire cookout or just sitting around the campfire feeling this beer will take you away on a journey to a fall evening sitting around a campfire with friends shooting the shit..A great share and I can't recommend trying this enough..Hats of to the folks at Alaskan brewing! This is an outstanding brew.."
"D: Easy to drink, not too strong. The smokey flavor is clearly the focus but there's enough other flavors going on to make this pretty good. However, I didn't really feel like the beer got better the more I drank it. Easy to drink, especially because of the manageable alcohol, but I'd have to taste more in this style before I really called this a keeper."
"2007. Pours pitch black. No light escapes. Big, brown head, fades, but maintains a good collar to the end of the glass. Aroma is rich, smokey and complex, with lots of dark malts, some faint dark fruits, and a bit of chocolate. Smoke is big, but very smooth, backed by a real nice, rich maltiness. Not too sweet. Hops are subdued, and not apparent, except in balance. Aftertaste is quick, clean and softly smoky. Really nice, with some great notes from the alderwood."
"The worst part was realizing this was my only bottle and that I'll need to stock up so that I can enjoy more in a few years."
"Fresh Alaskan Smoked Porter delivers an incredible mixture of typical chocolate and roasty characteristics normally found in a porter, enhanced by the smoke. The smoke reminds the drinker of pork barbeque and beef jerkey and delivers a incredible treat upon the palate. As the beer ages, however, it reaches a whole new level of complexity. None of the depth contributed by the smoke is lost. It is only enhanced by the emergence of other flavors. Even though this beer was incredibly tasty at two years, you have to think that a three or four year vintage of this one would be even better."
"Pours a very dark brown in color. There are ruby highlights around the edges. Smell is smoky, dominating the underlying malt. This is more smoke-forward than I imagined it would be. Almost has to be paired with food while drinking. A little thin on the mouthfeel. For a smoked beer, this is very well done. Would like to have some cheese and sausage to eat while drinking."
"Finishes sweet and silky with minimal dryness. Medium bodied. This was a great beer. I have been wanting this beer forever and am glad I got a chance to drink this one. Very nice. Subtle smokiness and overall deliciousness. My 22oz was gone in about 15 minutes!"
"The flavor is unlike any porter I've come across. Alaskan BC is completely unabashed about matching the ""Smoked"" advertised on their bottle with the level of smokiness in the brew. The palate is hit with a TON of beefy, roasted, and smoky malts, as well as chestnut, mesquite, pepper, chocolate, oak, and lots of earthen hops. Mouthfeel is perfectly carbonated, with a medium body that sits well on the palate and finishes smooth & strong, with a definitive smoked bitterness. Overall, I was quite pleased with this one. If only it were distributed somewhere near NC...looks like I'd better move to Alaska."
"Medium bodied, super smooth and slightly creamy. Wow this is so easy to drink. I can have this day and night and probably never get sick of it. So well balanced and just the right amount of smoke. Excellent."
"Drinkability/Notes: Been wanting to try this beer for a while now and glad I did. A really tasty porter that is not run of the mill. The smoked malts really up the ante with this one. Has most the characteristics of your standard porter then the smoke hits and kicks it up a notch. Sorry for the Emeril reference. Anyway, wish I could get my hands on more of this. A very unique beer that is highly drinkable. Definitley recommended. Seek and Enjoy."
"Notes: I think this would be great to cook with, in fact I poured a bit onto a piece of chicken anda pork chop to marinate, hopefully some of that flavor comes through on them"
"Drinkability: Yes... it will be easy for me to finish this bomber. I'll be looking for another to cellar and see the effects of aging."
"Very charred and smokey. Not BBQ Smoke, but black, out of the fireplace smoke."
"D - It was very good..and I enjoyed it thoroughly but I wouldn't want to do a smoked beer all the time..overall it was nice though"
"D: Man oh man, if only Alaskan Brewing shipped to the east coast, this would be a regular addition. It's absolutely fantastic."
"I am hoping that I got a bad bottle because I got this for a celebration and ended up pouring most of it out :("
"Pours out deep black with brown edges and little ruby hints. Slight brown head. Nose is liquid smoke and bacon bits with malts, very much like a rauchbier. A bit one-noted smokiness, but damn it's a wonderful smokiness. Taste is pure smoke, with slight chocolate malts, more smoke, and subtle sweetness. Mouthfeel is good, foamy, and... smoky. Drinkability is great, this is one of the most drinkable smoked beers I've had."
"Alaskan Smoked Porter pours an extremely dark brown, which borders so closely on black as to be indistinguishable. A large mocha head is kicked up before slowly recing to a fine film, and leaving some fingers of lace behind. The nose is rich and tempting, hinting that the marriage of smoke and porter has been a fruitful one. Abundant smoky campfire aromas, mix in with cocoa and leafy hops. A light graininess and hints of wood also linger, but the smoke is the dominant force here. The first sip is greeted by a nice smooth smoked chocolate flavour (if such a thing exists). Caramel, smoked sausage and wood combine in ways I wouldn't think could be so pleasurable, while a light sweetness and slight hint of sourness provide a delicate balance. Medium body and carbonation is par for the style. Weird, but fantastic. Had it a few years later on tap in New York and it was still on fine form."
"22 oz bomber, 2007 release. A: Pretty opaque dark brown with some amber in there. Small amount of head but it retains very well, some lacing. S: Smoke of course, chocolate, coffee, darker fruit, some faint earthy hops. T: Nice subdued sweetness on the front, coffee, burnt cocoa, a very long, smokey, dry finish. M: Pretty perfect carbonation, smooth, sticky yet nicely crisp. D: I could drink this one all night long. I grew up in Idaho and I love sampling whatever beers I can't get on the east coast when I come here, but it does leave me with a lingering sadness that I won't be able to pick up wonderful beers like this every week. Fantastic balance in this beer. For a thick smokey brew it's insanely drinkable."
"D: Again this is a beer I've had more than a few times and it never ceases to amaze me how much i enjoy it. A bit less than a 'perfect 5' because not every mood calls for a big husky, smoke-flavored beer, and after a while it can just a bit overwhelming. But, it's world-class overall, and one I highly recommend. At just 6.5% ABV, it drinks like a much bigger sipper without all the repercussions."
"Thanks to magget for this brew. Served cellar temperature, into a pint glass, from a twenty-two ounce brown bottle. Pours out a deep brownish black color, with some ruby highlights when held up to the light. Two inches of creamy, pillowy, mocha brown head formed, and just seemed to hang there. Great retention. Thick head left creamy trails of lace on the glass. Aromas of extremely smokey malts, some wood, and a touch of bittersweet chocolate filled my nose. Different, but in a good way. Taste was quite unique and as good as the nose. More smokey malts, some charred wood, a small tinge of chocolate, and maybe just a bit of smokey bacon. A little bit of tingly carbonation was noticed on the tongue and throat. No noticeable alcohol here. Mouthfeel was a little thin in my opinion. With all of the heavy flavors it almost seems it should be a tad thicker, almost chewey. Pretty decent drinkability. Would like to try an aged version of this as the bottle states""Enjoy now or age for several years"". Overall: Awesome."
"d: Many thanks to tayner for the chance to try this one. I'd be curious to see what some time in the cellar did to this one."
"Mouth feel is thick with slight bubbles, but otherwise creamy. Finish is good and dry, very drinkable for its class. Really good brew."
"D- Alaskan brewery never disappoints and they do not with this one either. This is a very good Porter and would be enjoyed even by those who do not typically like dark beers. I wish I could drink it more often, but it is a limited release and only comes in the larger Pint bottles. This is not bad in itself it just means it coasts more, but it is well worth it."
"Average drinkability on this one. The smoke theme may be overdone, and the ABV is a little high to be sessionable. Still a very unique and enjoyable porter, for a glass or two, but probably no more than that."
"I had high expectations but lower results than expected. Would only go back to this if it were a different years release."
"Best beer from Alaskan Brewing Company I have tasted yet, but I am expecting big things from their first bottled version of the barleywine, highly recommended, I will be putting some down for a year or two in my cellar, grab some before they are all gone, most places near me sold out already"
"drinkability: high"
"Thanks again for the trade, JDV."
"Dark with thin tawny foam that recedes quickly, leaving a narrow translucence at the surface of an otherwise opaque black beer. The feint caramel notes first detected rapidly gives way to the strong smoked aroma that makes this beer famous. The flavor evokes bacon, smoked fish, and tangy extra sharp cheese. It makes me crave crackers, but I am having Thai noodles, which are not the best pairing. Over the course of the 22 oz bomber, I grow accustomed to the smoke and the beer warms, revealing some coffee or chocolate more common to a porter, but these flavors are subdued, perhaps still masked by the smoke. For me, and probably most people, this is not an everyday beer, but it is a tasty, interesting brew and with the right pairing, it will surely make an enjoyable experience."
"D: a true sipper, amazing for the style, but it's so intense, I had a little trouble finishing the bottle, one would be enough for me for quite a while"
"D: An interesting and tasty porter beer from Alaskan. I have only had this beer fresh, in the same year as the vintage, but would like to try it aged, it is always very good fresh, and I'm glad to have this available to me in CA."
"The mouth feel was thin which I seen in quite a few porters. It was nicely carbonated and left a tingling in the whole mouth. It was a very solid porter and I would recommend highly."
"Many would argue that this is the best beer made by alaskan. I think it depends on the vintage. I am way too stingy to crack my 05's so I cracked an 06 for the review. Pours thick and dark as usual, and reeks of smoke. Thin head of a light brown color. Incredibly malty at first with the thickness of an imperial stout. The alder smoked malts come out with vengeance in the early finish and mostly just smoke and malt flavor in the aftertaste which seems to last for minutes. The smoke flavor in this beer is incredibly strong, its like drinking a burning log cabin. you can literally taste the difference between the alder smoked malt and other rauchbier. The 07 vintage is significantly less smokey and less hop flavors, hopefully it ages to be better. to really taste this beer get your hands on 06 or earlier vintage. truly unique."
"a bottle of the 2006 vintage a year later. still smells like it's been smoked, however it is not AS noticeable in the taste. the beer also seems thicker than when it was fresh borderline stout thick overall the year has done this beer well, i'm excited to see how this vintage matures further."
"Bottle bought at the Van Ness Bev Mo in San Francisco. Poured black and kind of grainy looking, but still kind of clear. Head small and spiderwebs nicely. A textural beer, like a river at night. Nice smoky flavor, which i assume is the alder smoke. Whiff of alcohol and burnt grains before i take my first sip, then im hit with a smack of malt and chocolate with subdued but ever-present smokiness. Not a rauchbier-like beef jerky flavor, more of a campfire smoke. very nice. medium bodied and grainy texture....but smooth drinking. its fantastic."
"Mild carbonation and surprisingly easy drinking. In the past, I've only had samples at the GABF. It was nice to be able to sit down and really enjoy a full bottle. This is a really great beer."
"Awesome!"
"Drinkability: Ashy but palpable. Nicely smoked. This beer gets so many good reviews, but I thought Lefthand's Smokejumper was way better. This type of beer would be tough to drink copious amounts. Give it a try."
"Nice job on the smoked malts. This is a rare smoked beer that is in good balance. Overall, a great tasting and drinkable porter."
"Drinks pretty darn easy. maybe I'd get tired of this after a while due to the smokeyness, but I'm not sure. This would pair great with Mississippi Mud Pie or BBQ, glad I finally got to drink more than a few ozs of this"
"Mouthfeel was thick and chewy. I would imagine that there are folks who genuinely love this beer."
"D - This is a very good beer. It certainly is worth a try."
"Pours a nice dark brown/black color, some carbonation, little fizzy creamy tan head, some sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is malty, slightly smoked/roasty, toffee, and caramel. The taste is awesome as usual, malty, smokey/roasty, nice touch of toffee/caramel. The finish is slightly dry/bitter. Medium body. Very drinkable, another awesome vintage of this great brew."
"First sip reveals a wonderful smokey flavor, blended well with hints of chocolate & coffee. Slight hoppy bitterness lingers, carrying the other flavors along with it. Light carbonation, smooth and satisfying. All around, just an awesome beer."
"D - My roommates got me this one, I had been looking for it for quite some time. I was excited to have - that usually means that I leave the brew in disappointment. This was an exception. Normally, smoked beers are too gross. They have so much negatives that I can't see the positives. This one is over the top, but it is not gross. I wouldn't want to drink more than a bomber in one setting, but this is GREAT for food. Spicy food. Would wash down a burrito in no time."
"Smoked/Rauch brews are hit or miss for me, but this one's a hit. I think the porters do better than the lagers. If you like this, seek the O'Fallon, which is the only one I like more."
"Comment: I'd read the accoladed this beer has received and looked forward to sampling it. I was not disappointed. It will join the beers I try to keep in house for occassions that would benefit from a special Porter."
"Very dark brown with a smoky aroma. Tastes of licorice, leather, a bit of coffee and chocolate, and lots and lots of smoke. Maybe a bit too much smoke, but the word's on the label so I guess I can't complain. Smooth and creamy on the palette, leaving a bitter smoky aftertaste. I don't think I'd drink more than one, or maybe finish the bomber at most, but that's not a bad thing. One of these goes a long way."
"Overall this beer is just oversmoked for me. The smoke is so overpowering. A little over the top. The bitter hops counter act the smoke. You really need to be in the mood to drink this smoked beer. Tonight I was not. An above averate porter for special occasions like roasted duck or smoked pork. Even some smoked cheddars would be good with this special beer."
"Personal score- 83/100"
"Pours a very black, and dark color with a brown head that lingers on top and sticks around for a good while. Smell is of a rich smokiness that punches through your nostrils. Taste is heavy on the malt with the smokey aftertaste. Great carbonation on this one and a lingering bittering aftertaste."
"Pours very black with a brown hue and cocoa head. Smells of huge smoke, almost smoked salmon like, and very roasty. Taste is sweet malt, very huge roast, toasty, chocolate and delicious. Smooth as silk in the mouth and off the charts drinkable. A must try experience."
"Highly recommended. A great smoked porter - better I'd say than Stone's."
"Very nice and well-crafted, if not as fantastic as I hoped for. Certainly worthwhile."
"Pours a thick dark brown color, thin brown head settles fairly quickly. Smells just the right level of smoked, along with some faint sweet aroma. Taste is smoke, some faint bakers chocolate, maybe even a bit of coffee. It lacks any hint of soy sauce that i've picked up from other porters. Mouthfeel is somewhat thinner than i was expecting, but not bad. Finishes nicely, just the right amount of aftertaste. Drinkability is good, flavor is unique. If you've had a rauchbier, and were expecting more of that flavor, you'd be dissapointed. A very nice beer, a great end to a long day at work."
"2007 vintage. I have an 04 in the closet I cant wait to drink."
"I'm not that big on smoke beers, but I can surely appreciate and enjoy this one. I'm not too sure what the age has done to this bottle. It seems to have aged fine even though the modest ABV would hint otherwise. I would definitely be open to trying this again."
"Overall, this is a very good beer, although perhaps not as good as some would argue. Given the substitutes, I'd rather have Stone Smoked Porter, as I feel it's easier to find and the taste is more robust. Have a try for yourself and decide."
"Worthy of it's world class status, this is a supremely enjoyable smoked porter. But the fact is, the smoke tempers it's drinkabilty, in that as good as it is, I don't want to have to many of these in a sitting. Still, I was worried it was to early to bust out of the cellar, but it turns out that it's already rounded off nicely."
"Poured from 22 oz. bottle (if I did my math correctly) into a pint glass, ""2005"" on label. Pours black, no signs of highlights at all, just plain black. A creamy, mocha head develops quickly and settles leaving a layer behind for the remainder of the drink and leaves decent lace. Smell is of smoke, as expected, mocha, and caramel. Taste is on track with the smell. A nice blend of smoke, coffee, chocolate, and what seems to be a small hint of honey. The ""smoke"" aspect of the beer is very enjoyable. Low carbonation leads to a smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Overall a very drinkable beer. Not really my style but I was very impressed with this."
"All in all, I'm glad I tried it, but I won't make it a habit."
"d - easy to drink but remaining full bodied. A wonderfull porter. One of the best ive had."
"Beer was served from 22oz bomber bottle, like any porter there was not a lot of head, scent was strong and distinct of smoked wood...very fitting given the popularity of smoked salmon in alaska"
"Bottle courtesy of Hogtownharry: Poured a black color porter with a quite big foamy head with some good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of smoked malt is dominating with some dry roasted malt notes also noticeable. Taste is dominated by smoked malt with a well balance mix of dry roasted malt. I enjoyed the fact that while still being a smoked beer it was well enough balance to enjoy other aspect (i.e. roasted malt). Body is quite full with some medium carbonation."
"More kudos to Edgelow for the bottle."
"D- It's a very good beer, enjoyable, but the smoke may be a bit too strong to drink a lot of it. I'd recommend trying it, though. And pair it with some beef jerky. A match made in... the woods."
"Drinkability- This is such a good beer! I honestly cant think of a better beer to sit down with some cheese and crackers or anything Bar-B-Qd. Its such a fantastic Porter I wish I could regularly get my hands on this stuff. Definitely in my top 5 beers."
"Pours the darkest brown without hitting black possible, very light tan head. Smells incredible, like hickory or mesquite smoke and just a hint of the malt reminding me this is a beer and not beef jerky. Taste is almost sweet with the smoke pushed a bit more to the back than the aroma. Somewhat creamy, but not as much a non-smoked porter. Wins me over as I love anything smokey tasting. Finished great with a nice whiskey."
"D - This is a tough call. Does the intense smokiness hurt the drinkability or add another layer of flavor to the brew? I'm digging it right now. Adds a whole new level of robust to this beer."
"I was curious about the shelf like of AK Smoked Porter and tried the 2006 again on 7/15/13. Faded, but still drinking fine."
"Drinkability is top notch. This is an excellent smoked beer. I would have a tough time picking a favorite between this and Stone's."
"This was a good beer overall but I would have liked to see the flavors come through on the palate as strongly as they did in the finish. For a pairing, I would highly recommend a plate of wild Alaskan smoked salmon."
"2005 bottling. Pours brown-black with crimson and scarlet tones. Small but solid creamy, dark tan head; thin but present lacing. Aroma of liquor (dark rum), woodsmoke, black tea, dark fruits, salt, and alcohol. Mouthfeel is relatively light and mildly carbonated. Flavor is dominated by thick, woody, sappy smoke  molasses, chocolate, and coffee take a back seat. Sourdough undertones throughout. More smoke in the finish; sour and bitter aftertaste."
"The head was creamy, but not overly large. Overalla great quaff."
"Smooth and creamy but a relatively clean dry finish. I definitely prefer Stone as far as smoked porters are concerned."
"Overall, smoked porters are my favorite style so the points are skewed a bit, but I think I have found the paragon of the style. There is definately a mineral edge to it, and that puts it over the top. I need more of this or I need to move to Alaska."
"Big frothy head on top of a beautiful black/brown brew. The aroma is unmistakable. Smoked fish and campfire goodness, even some bacon thrown in. It is incredible and wonderful. Hits your tongue in a smooth wave of smokey-charcoal goodness that rolls over the tongue, never bitter, just a satiny taste of the great outdoors and I loved it. A tatse treat that is very drinkable for anyone who is open to a unique brew experience. This is as enjoyable a porter as I think I've ever had."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. The carbonation of this beer is very intriguing. It definitely did not produce much of a head, but it doesn't taste that lightly carbonated. Who knows? Overall, this is a very, very good beer. Extremely drinkable. Definitely recommended.."
"This has to be one of the most interesting porters I've ever had. Great roasty notes dancing the tango with the smoky malt flavors. Really good beer. Warms up well too, this is one to have on had at all times durring the colder months. Pairs nicely with food too, almost any kind of red meat dish would be perfect. I had it with some pasta with roasted red pepers, yummy. Hats off to the brewers."
"Wow what a beer. I have to say I was skeptical of what one person called fishy beer but I was won over immediately. That smoked salmon smell is powerful and appealing once youre over the initial shock. Thank fully the smoke is only accent to the malty goodness. This is a serious beer, not a gimmick."
"This was a slow-drinking, very flavorful beer that needed a food complement for me. I was disappointed by the lack of carbonation. I think a little more would have really helped the appearance, smell and mouthfeel. Perhaps I had a bad bottle? Still, it was definitely worthwhile. I want to try the 2006 now."
"Drinkability - I thought this was an absolutely fantastic beer. It is extremely drinkable, unlike many smoked beers in my opinion. I could drink many a pint of this beer. Blew Stone Smoked Porter out of the water in my opinion."
"This was a hard one to track down for a while, but worth the search. It has the aroma of smoked fish, and the taste is the same. Still light enough in alcohol to drink a 22oz. bottle and be ok. It is one, if not the best smoked beers I have ever had."
"Drinkability: One could imbibe on this for quite a few pints"
"Overall, a delightful beer. Obviously well made and well thought out. Quite impressive. Smoke is not as overpowering as others I have had, and that is a good thing. Ages well. Good with BBQ."
"Picked up a 22 oz. bottle (2006 vintage) on my last trip to Seattle and managed to get it back to Boston in perfect shape. The smell blew me away when I first poured it, it was like a campfire in my nostrils. I loved the smell. It poured with a nice dark brown appearance, like most porters. The taste wasn't as pronounced as the smell, but you could definitely taste the smokiness. This is a beer that one should drink with a nice bbq meal, or else by itself in order to truly appreciate it. I wish I brought a few more back with me to age."
"D: a very delightful beer that would pair well with a barbecue; smokiness limits drinkability to one or two in a sitting. Reminds a lot of a smoked marzen but with slightly more malt complexity and coffee flavor."
"Thanks to Talisker for the trade! Poured a deep black with a thin head that quickly diminished to a ring and left no lacing. The aroma was of dark malt with just a hint of smoke. The smoke in the flavor was just right; not at all overbearing and in perfect balance with the malts. The beer light and the alcohol was very well hidden. This is an extremely enjoyable beer."
"The brew is medium bodied, which is not what one would gather from appearance. Slick, smooth and soft presence on the palate; semi-full mouthfeel. Excellent texture. Taste is a great balance of smoked malt with a semi-sweet chocolate finish. Not too overbearing like some porters can be. No slouch either. Drinkability is excellent for the style. An excellent brew that I'll seek out in the future. Recommended."
"D: This is one of the better smoked beers I've had and is on par with the Spezial Rauchbier Lager that I had recently. This takes the lead because I prefer darker beers and the heavier darker flavors work a bit nicer with the smoke."
"This beer is great but I don't think I could muscle through more than one on account of the intense smokiness."
"Mouthfeel was thin to medium. Carbonation smoothed out as it warmed."
"D - Overall there is really nothing like this. It is a superbly put together brew and I can now see why everyone raves. Would love to try some older vinatge to see if some more complex flavors come out."
"M/D - Medium to full-bodied, the slight watery taste sways it toward medium-bodied but the full flavor brings it towards full-bodied. The carbonation is low and the roasted malt adheres to every inch of the mouth. I enjoyed the whole bomber and I could have another, but the taste can become one dimensional. The roasted, smoky malt is the overwhelming flavor, and it's good, don't get me wrong, but it can get a little boring. It's drinkable, but hey, it's a Porter. Not the most drinkable I've had, but it's a great version of the style. For a 2 year old Porter, it's aged extremely well."
"Not a bad experience to crack open this beer as an Easter treat an hour or so after a late breakfast of pancakes. This makes an excellent after-meal beer. I've got a couple more bottles of this that are a little younger, so I'm glad to see that this is a beer that seems to age well."
"This one poured a deep brown with chestnut edges. The thin, fine bubbles settled to a solid ring that produced some spotty lace. The aroma was full of smoke, but while it was assertive it wasn't over the top. Behind that were caramel and chocolate maltiness combined with a bit of charcoal. Moderate bitterness with flavours of semi-sweet chocolate and restrained smoke. Notes of roastiness, nuts, and caramel rounded things out. The finish had some lingering smoke and a hint of sour cherries. Medium/full bodied, a little dry with lowish carbonation that contributed to a creamy texture. This stuff was easy going down. I'm glad I have another bottle!"
"Pours a clear brown/red, nice colour to the edges, thick brown head forms, lace rings, good retention, looks like a porter. Smell is nice, sweet, toffee, chocolate roast, smoke, pretty well integrated, smoke is nicely balanced. Taste is caramel, roasty bitterness, chocolate and coffee, bit of beef jerky smoke, light bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium to thick bodied with low carbonation, quite nice, maybe a touch too much smoke in the flavour for me but pretty nice to drink. Thanks a ton Russ!!"
"This beer is probably not for everyone, or for every day. However, you won't know until you try it, and scotch drinkers may find the peaty-ness of this brew quite enjoyable."
"drinkability is great. balanced and enjoyable. the smoke is obvious, but not overpowering. very nice."
"Poured into a pint glass from a bomber, 2006 edition. Very dark with a small, rapidly dissapating head, some lacing. Aroma, as expected, was very smoky. Flavor was a mixture of chocolate and coffee with the smokiness always in the background. Very light mouthfeel, went down very easy and smooth. Tasted great with the salmon I grilled too."
"Great example of the style. It's not something I'd drink all that often, but it's a great brew for when the mood hits. Well worth seeking out a bottle."
"Thanks to Timmcd64."
"D: I can't say that I'm blown away by this, but I could certainly see myself drinking this as a session brew."
"D: One of the best beers that I've ever had. I'm not sure how often I'll be drinking it since it's a bit heavy. I paired it with fajitas and it was a fantastic match."
"Cheers2Beers"
"D - This is one seriously excellent beer although it resides on the fringe of the Porter style due to the big smoke character. I personally like the smoke, so I'm cool with it, but others might be turned off. That said, big satisfaction means big marks. Perfect for a chilly evening, and light enough to enjoy a second after the first disappears."
"Not an everyday beer in my opinion, but very good. I would certainly drink this again. Might try it with Mexican food."
"probably something I wouldn't mind picking up now and again if it was local, but other than that just another good beer in the pack."
"this was the 2006 ""vintage"" - I liked it quite a bit and will get it again."
"Many thanks to dmeadows and b0ldfacelies for sending me samples of the 2005 bottling of Alaskan Smoked Porter. This looks beautiful in my nonic, all the darkest brown there is (which basically means it's black) with a lovely mahogany halo ringing the bottom edge of the glass. The head is surprisingly modest (or maybe not so surprising given the age of the bottle), and is a sandy ecru color; it's noisy and doesn't stick around for very long. Before the head completely disappeared, however, I detected faded wisps of alder smoke, very much like the way one's clothes smell waking up in the morning on a camping trip, with the embers of the previous night's fire still clinging to everything. There are also some slightly sour, but full and chocolatey nonetheless, aromas from the dark, black roasted malts. These qualities persist in the taste as well, with the chocolate becoming decidedly more pronounced, along with a slightly sour, earthy mineral flavor. The smoke, mind you, is of course the highlight of the taste. But at this age (one-and-a-half years, at least) it has become pleasantly muted. Enough to let the drinker know that this porter is indeed brewed with smoked malts, but it's not here to make you feel as if you chased a smoked-ham and smoked-gouda cheese sandwich with a swallow of bong water. No, this is some subtle, nuanced, well-crafted smokiness that most likely has improved since its fresher days (this is the freshest sample of Alaskan Smoked Porter I've yet to try). Medium in body, full-ish on the palate with a dignifed smoothness that seems to have emerged due to its stay in the cellar. Overall, this is a fabulous, paradigmatic porter. I'm very glad to have more bottles stashed downstairs. By the way, this paired extraordinarily with some spicy black bean quesadillas."
"D: Very good smoked porter, wish this was easier for me to get on a regular basis"
"Drinkability is great if you like to be outdoors around the fire drinking dark bitter beers."
"Oddly, for such a great flavor it is fairly simple. Just loas of smoked wood and toasty goodness. Kind of a burnt oat bread thing as well. Slight hop presence gives it enough hop bitterness to round out the flavor. Medium body that has a slight dry edge to it. Makes my tongue feel a bit like sandpaper actually. Way too easily drinkable."
"So with this review, it should be noted that I am not a ""fishy"" fan at all. So I will age most that I have and see how they do over time."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The body of the beer is on the lighter side. The beer never seems to be actually thin. The carbonation is slightly more than medium. The smoked aftertaste seems to last forever. This is a dam tasty beer treat. This beer is welcome at my house and in my glass any time!"
"D--- I feel a little disappointed because I had high hopes for this. I would enjoy trying it again if I had access to it. This was a batch of 2006."
"A very interesting beer to me since I haven't had many smoked beers. Not overpowering in its smokiness, but since I love barbeque this hits the spot. Recommended!"
"Wonderful and unsurpassed in it's class."
"Drinkability: This beer is the best beer ever!!!! everything about this beer is great. I would travel anywhere to get this beer on cask."
"This beer is a very dark color with just a hint of light coming through. There is a small tan head and a little bit of lacing. The smell is very smokey. The taste is heavily smoked and there is a hint of smoked salmon that is typical of these smoked beers. The beer is very smooth and thus is an easy drinker. This is the best smoked beer I have had. I may have to trade for another sometime."
"This was the 2005 version."
"Big thank you to mcallister for theis great Xmas present. He even wrapped it! 2005 Edition, 6.5% ABV. Solid black appearance, with a thick tan foamy, rocky head. Great head retention, which was suprising since the beer is over a year old. Aroma of oak, vanilla, chocolate, roasty malt, with a nice whiff of campfire. Nice chocolate like malt flavor, hints of fruit, and smoke. The smoke comes in at the end, and seems to be the perfect amount, not overwhelming. There is some bitterness, but everything seems well rounded. Still a good amount of carbonation left in this, along with a nice medium body. More smoke and chocolate comes through as it warms. This seems to be a smoked porter that is done to perfection. What an enjoyable beer! Very drinakble, as before I knew it, it was gone."
"The beer arrived a deep rich brown with minimal head and almost no lacing. The smell that hits you is of smoke, roasted malt and trace hops. The taste is of smoke, glorious smoke. I am assuming they use alderwood because this tastes just like NW smoked salmon. The background notes are of toffee, coffee maybe some dark chocolate. Very nice with a wonderful aftertaste. The smoke hits you in the middle between the sweetness imparted by the heavy hand of the malt and the hops at the end. truly a wonderful tasting beer. Mouthfeel is somewhat thick, a little creamy. highly recommended"
"D: This is one to savor on a cold evening around the campfire. I love the smoked beers and this one perfectly balances this element to a tee. Extremely drinkable for a single serving and a must try for those adventurous souls who love to try something different!"
"This is the 2005 AK smoked porter consumed in september 2006 that I'm reviewing from notes. Pours a really dark brown with a tan 1 inch head. The smell is smokey and meaty, like a slim jim with some malt in the background. The taste has light smoke up front but balanced by a complex smokey/winey finish that is more subtle than the start. Creamy mouthfeel with a very dry finish. Balanced and interesting, but hard to live up to its cult following."
"This is probably the best smoked beer I've ever had. I don't tend to be a big fan of smoked beers, but this one blew my socks off! If you can get this, you'll definitely enjoy it!"
"This is a defininte buy if you can get it."
"Very balanced flavors of dark chocolate, black licorice, smoked pork, and other dark fruits. Not the most complex beer I've tried yet very nice and easy to drink for a smoked style."
"The beer had a thin light tan head over a near opaque, slick liquid. The head left some appreciable lacing. Had a mildly smokey roasted scent, but far too weak. The taste was full of enormous smoked flavor, almost meaty. There was a slight chocolate note, but very obvious. It was also just a bit vinous. The mouth was pretty light, with low carbonation. An excellent beer that I would like to see on the East Coast."
"2004 vintage. Very dark brown with some garnet highlights on the edges. Brown head. Light lace. Dark chocolate, vanilla, and smoke. Amazing. The smoke is not the main player here. The flavor is like sex in a glass. Some smoke, chocolate, vanilla, ash, marshmallow, and lightly bitter. Rich on the palate. Bamberg aint got shit on this."
"I only wish that this porter would have been better!"
"Drinkability: Smooth and tasty, I find this easily sessionable and perfect for a cold night."
"Drinkability: While entirely delicious, the strong character makes it hard to drink a lot of this in one sitting. A glass or two is enough for me. It's thoroughly enjoyable stuff, though."
"Thanks to kmpitz2 for the taste and autumnaldave for the harassment!"
"Overall, this is a fabulous beer. All elements are balanced with each other; every element is high quality in and of itself. It's got a distinctive smoke character that you don't find in many other beers, and certainly not in the progenitors of the style. This is certainly the best American smoked beer I've had, and it vies with the imports for ""best in the world"" status."
"D - Good, but the deep smokiness might be a bit much after awhile. That said, this is an excellent beer and well deserving of the ranking that it gets."
" This was a nice porter one I could easily see using as a session brew."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Not quaffable, but very, very sippable."
"I would probably try this beer again with an appropriate food pairing rather than drink it by itself."
"I assume with time the smoke would moderate and allow the rest of the beer to be tasted. I do think stone smoked porter is a much more balanced off-the-shelf version of this style."
"This is a very fine beer and immensely drinkable. I am pleased that Luchman was able to provide me with a second bottle, as one is just not enough. Seek this one out."
"A very good smoked porter. They didn't go overboard with the smokey character, and I'm glad for that. It still stays true to the excellent style that is a porter. Highly recommended, but definitely a sipping beer. Paired very well with some smoked sharp cheddar!"
"I love this stuff. Highly recommended. It's obvious Alaskan cares a lot about this one."
"D: Very drinkable. In the past 2 weeks Ive acquired 3 bottles of ASP and frankly I could go for some more."
"2005 bottle. Deep dark brown with red and black hues and a thin dust-colored head; not an exceptionally thick porter as it is relatively translucent to other beers in it's genre. Some smoked malts and peat on the nose and mouth, an average amount for a smoked beer, nothing too extreme. Skunky bitterness tells me perhaps this bottle is a bit overripe, but it's former glory still shines through. The body is too flat and....underfermented??? Is that a word? Seems like there's too much wort still hanging around in the body of the beer. A good porter but not great like the barleywine."
" The smoke is quite apparent, but there is some malt in the background. At first, there is smoke, then just as the porter peaks its head around the corner, the smoke caves its head in with a bat. This beer actually reminds me of Lagavulin. Very smooth mouthfeel. The smoke diminishes as the beer warms, allowing the porter to come through. Good drinkability, this would be perfect to have while grilling, and I would have another one as I ate whatever it was I grilled."
"I love this beer. Among the best Porters Ive ever tasted."
"2011 version - purchased in Rock Springs, WY. Surprisingly, still agree with all my notes above - I wasn't so bad as a noob. A classic with lovely fresh smoked balanced against an already quality porter. 4/14/2012"
"THE BLOODHOUND FACTOR: Peaches, as of late, has taken full control of the hoser-bowl, drinking hers and Benjies' samples. She found this brew most enjoyable, albeit the smoke aroma put her off at first. Good dog..."
"Beer poured a very dark brown with a good two fingered head that is sustaining quite well. Nose is of alder wood smoked malts, very pleasant and not overpowering. Taste is of chocolate malts blending into a blissful medium hopped finish. Mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth and creamy. Drinkability is very good. This is one of those beers that will be part of the rotation of my favorites!"
"This is a very wonderful drinkable porter and I highly recommend it. I may go back and grab a couple more simply to put in storage for a while. Very well done!"
"Taste; the smoked flavor is a bit more defined than it is in the nose, with the coffee and chocolate coming out nicely. Some dark fruits emerge as this warms, and finishes with a little bit of a hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and a creamy, and has a very good drinkability."
"This is the 2005 version. Very dark brown, almost black color with a tan head that quickly disappears. The smell is smoky; I get oak and some hickory definitely a hardwood. There is a sweet dark fruit smell in there too. The taste is toasted malts, more of the smokiness, and some dark fruits, like prunes. The mouthfeel is medium, creamy not chewy. There is a biting carbonation. There is a slight bitter aftertaste but the smokiness lingers the most. Very drinkable and tasty."
"Glad I got to try this one. Enjoyable and worth trying, though I've had several others of the style that were richer."
"D: What a porter. What a smoked beer. I would like to age a bottle of this for a couple of years to see what happens."
"Cheers!"
"2005  version  would cellaring help intensive the brew?"
"Mouthfeel is good... but more important are the complex flavors that arise all over the palate.... chocolatey, roasted malts... nutty, slightly sugary... awesome. Rich and dry. Wow."
"Does it sound like I'm raving yet? This is a fantastic beer. I owe orrshow big thanks for getting his folks to bring an extra bottle of this one for me. Needless to say, if I see it again I will be buying it."
"Wonderfully drinkable after a nice light lunch on a cool Alaska afternoon."
"Tastes delicious. Rich and smokey. Some smokey sweetness, like the mild sweetness of smoked salmon. Smoked salmon, chocolate, coffee, toffee. Touches of fruity yeastiness, spice (black pepper and nutmeg?), and minerality. Balanced. Creamy mouthfeel. Unusual, interesting, and really good."
"Yeah pretty much spot on. Not too smoky and not fake smoky like that Stone version. This is really best drinkable just below cellar temps the colder it was the less it was and the room temp was just not cohesive enough everything really seemed too sharp. The look is great nice black body covered in a tan head. The smell is a dull wet smoke with tannic touches and a addition of roasty malt. The taste comes out smoky and stays smokey only in the back finish does the porter part pop. I think the base beer is pretty good on its own and the nice smoke gives it a unique twist. This is a little bit thinner than I thought it would be but still holds enough to support the cast. A 22 is good enough to fly solo or share. It would be nice in a usual rotation."
"It might be too heavy to drink multiples of in one sitting, and the flavor is definitely not something most would want regularly, so I have to dock the drinkability points just slightly. But still, whenever you do quaff this one, you will be drinking and very much enjoying one of the finest porters ever brewed."
"Taste: The smokiness is subtle, but adds to the porter flavors nicely. Coffee and roasted grains, very nice. This is an extremely easy-to-drink beer, one that I could see laying down for a while or drinking fresh, either way, fantastic. I did like the Stone Smoked Porter better, but this one comes very close."
"Bottled sample. 2005 vintage. Black in colour with medium carbonation. Aromas of wet maple wood, along with both vineous and dark berry fruits. Alder woodsmoke is the dominant flavor here, along with notes of mild chocolate and other roasted malts. Medium bodied, which was a bit lighter than I had expected. It lacked a bit of caramel malt and chocolate flavors for my taste, but the smoke flavor has great potency. It would be interesting to do a side-by-side tasting with this and the Stone Smoked Porter."
"Nice head, opaque body, plenty of lacing, great smokey nose. Unfortunately the taste is to be blunt ... yucky. I love this beer normally, so I thought I'd try a aged version. Either something is wrong with this bottle or the age did no favors. It tastes very sour, and as expected has little of the smokiness. Mouth is still very nice. I hope something is wrong with the bottle rather than just a bad side effect to the age. If I try another aged bottle and it tastes different I will edit this review."
"A bit overrated in my opinion. I don't think I'll go out of my way to get this one again. Hopefully the one in the cellar will do better after a year or two."
"KEGS AND EGGS!"
"This is one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had."
"A masterpiece."
"If you like smoky, you'll love this one ! Cheers!"
"This is a 2005 bottle. I have another one and a 2004 in my cellar (read: cabinet). The pour is an all but opaque dark brown to black with a one and a half finger head. The nose is filled with smoky aromas of wood and peat, as well as roasted malt and chocolate. The mouthfeel is on the thin side of medium bodies and it's a bit rough and prickly, but the negatives are all fairly minor. Sweet caramel malt and fruit join the smoky flavors in this tasty beer. I have a seafood allergy so I don't know whether or not this tastes (or smells) like salmon. I can tell you this though, if salmon does, in fact, taste like this beer, I'll wish I could eat lots and lots of it."
"This is one fantastic porter! Poured black as ink with a 1.5 finger khaki head that hung around for a while. The smell is very good. More smoke present in this one that the Stone smoke that I had a couple of days ago. This also seems to have a heavier presence of chocolate in both smell and taste. There also seems to be a little bit of caramel and coffee beans. It's subtle, but there. The taste seems dry and roasted. The smoke presence in the smell is present in the taste, but mildly so, I feel, anyway. But then again, I drink Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier like most people drink SNPA. Mouthfeel is smooth and very gently carbonated. Overall, I was very pleased with how this tasted. I fabulous beer."
"Brownish black topped with a thin frosting of tan head. Head fades away quickly. Highlights of smoke, meat, and sweet fruit in the nose. Taste is well balanced. Sweet, smoky malt with hints of chocolate and subtle hops to even the beer out. Carbonation is pleasant. Very easy to drink."
"It's what I have expected. Surprisingly so. A solid, well-balanced, heavier than normal, rich, porter. Alone, without the smoke, would warrant a big-time review. With the smoke additions, it's nearly perfect. Lots of chocolate, powdery, roastiness, light coffee, and milk-stout flavors that have melded well over the past few years. The smoke doesn't only add another flavor on top of the porter flavors, it becomes an integral part of the brew. Difficult to detect where the porter ends and the smoke begins. The perfect camp-fire brew. Bold to the taste, and silky to the touch."
"Cheers!"
"2003 vintage bottle. I poured this beer into a tulip glass for maixmum visibility and aration. The beer poured a deep black color with a bright brown foamy head but it was not very thick and it actually disapated rather quickly. The aroma was a fantastic mellow roasted smell. Chocolately and toasted coffee. The taste was mellowed but very pleasing to my lucky taste buds. The taste gives you more of the toasted coffee and chocolate notes but also a bit of bitterness. After I let this sit for awhile to warm up a bit, I got some caramel notes in the aroma and taste and I noticed a wonderful swirling efffect on the limited head. Nice thick body but I find this beer to be very drinkable."
"Flavor is nicely balanced. Flavor is round and malty, slightly spicy. Roasted malts are restrainted, and the finish is firmly smoky and bitter. I don't really detect any hops though, the bitterness seems to come from the roasted malts. Agressive carbonation scrubs the tongue, and the flavor doesn't linger very long. Drinkability is good."
"Thanks sharing Mike!"
"The beer had a very classic, porter appearance with a thick darkness and a thin, but long lasting tan head. The nose featured the an underlying smokey scents along with some hints of chocolate and carmel. Other small complexities linger in the background; AK Smoked Porter has an awesome smell to it. The beer's flavor matches the nose: an initial mouthfull of dark chocolate with a finish of smokiness. Allowing the beer to roll around the tongue, I received a surprising bitterness at the finish. A lot to discover here as well. The mouthfeel on this beer ended up being surprisingly creamy and insanely drinkable. I could sit down and drink these all evening without blinking an eye. I'll be picking up more of these from Liquid Solutions quite soon."
"(Special thanks to xcjetta for providing this sample.)"
"Drinkability - not as complex as the '03 and much smokier. Still tasty but I like the '03 better."
"Edit: After having a couple of bottles of the 2008 release, I find it is the smokiest fresh SP in many a year and I'm super excited as to how this one will age in the years to come. Even the mouthfeel seems to be more luxurious and silky. My score has been adjusted accordingly."
"An exceptional smoked porter, had on tap at O'Briens. I am admittedly not a huge fan of porters in general, but this is definitely in the top rung amongst this style. The scent is smokey, as is the taste. Fortunately, the taste is also a bit sweet and a bit bitter on the finish. This all adds up to a very balanced, and VERY drinkable porter! Tasting notes include chocolate and the obvious smokiness. After reading some of the reviews on here, I was worried that this would be too syrupy, but in fact the carbonation is spot on, and the beer isn't heavy at all! Highly recommended for fans of this style."
"I can surely see why this is a well received beer and although I don't see myself drinking this with much regularity, I will certainly consider this a treat worth indulging in when opportunities present themselves."
"Ill be honest I dont appreciate the style, but there is definitely a very nice little flavor progression here and you seem to get different aftertatstes based on how large a sip you take. A very large sip leaves a more porterish aftertaste while a small leaves more smoked flavors. Its a very interesting beer."
"Obtained this 2005 bomber in a trade with BigLove a little while back. The beer inside was dark brown while pouring and black after settling in the pint glass. The head atop the opaque body was light beige in color and one finger thick. While the looks were good, the aroma was otherworldly smoky, underlain by a chocolate smell. The smokiness was also unmistakable in the taste, but it was far from overwhelming, and permitted chocolaty sweet and lemony sour flavors of a very well made porter come through. The hops were also present with a citric bitterness. Mouthfeel was chalky and dry, while still being silky smooth. No hint of harsh graininess in the aftertaste, just smooth long drawn out smoke. After tasting this spectacular beer, I wish more brewers would start experimenting with smoked malt. I would love to get my hands on more, as this would be phenomenal with more age on it, as the layers of flavors merge. It was still a world class beer as it was."
"Sample from a 22oz bomber from 2005. I can say that I've never really tasted a smoked porter before this one. I still like the Stone version but damn I am mad I didn't team this one up with the pulled pork I made last weekend. The appearance is a black with a nice brown head which disappears over time while leaving no lace even after a second pouring. Taste is coffee, roasted, smokey goodness while being a super smooth beer. This is a perfect beer tonight as a little snow comes down and I read ""Beer School"". I am psyched to have received this in a trade and thanks to BA for that one."
"D- without a doubt, this is a sipper instead of a gulper. ABV level is moderate at 6.5%. Still wouldnt recommend for session drinking. Eye opening and refreshing. Must try brew, especially for porter lovers."
"A 2004 bottle opened after one year. We're in the PNW so the nose reminded me of an exquisite smoked salmon dinner. The smoky nose is FULL. Color is dark brown with a true porter 1 inch head. Subtle touch of caramel at first taste then the smoky hops envelope the taste buds with a somewhat fruity finish. I enjoyed this with a med-rare BBQ brisket. The choclately flavors came out back and forth when I would take a bite of the steak, and then again with the porter. I need to try this with a smoked salmon dish. I've had it with a regular King Salmon and I still enjoyed it better with the brisket. I have another 2004 bottle I'm aging."
"This is a good beer and a good porter. Looks good, smells good, tastes good and has a good feel. It doesn't really get past that point, though, and the sweetness is a bit more than I want so it makes me less likely to have another. With the 22 ounce bottle, that's a given. But it is still another impressive brew from this brewery."
"The mouthfeel is nice and firm. Extremely easy drinker. I wish they had this one in Chicago. Well done indeed!"
"All in all, a truly great smoked porter."
"I'm not normally a big fan of smoked porters, but this one will change anyone's minds. Deep, rich color. Decent head retention, but this beer is all about it's strong unique flavor. Not a beer you want to drink every day, but a great occasion beer. I like bringing one of these on a boys fishing weekend. Perfect beer to drink after catching some trout."
"A total winner in my book. If only it was more available. Deserves the status it has achieved."
"Maybe my expectations were too high for this beer. I was thrilled to pick up three of these in Portland, last November. There was a light roasted aroma with, of course, a smoky and a bit of oak aroma. I had expected a more powerful smoked smell. Virtually no head, no matter high hard I tried. Heavy smoke taste, which covered up any other flavors. This was good, but not great. This beer is definitely made to pair with something from the smoker."
"Musings: This is a tough beer for me to drink in quantity. The smoke flavors are way to extreme for me. It's a solid porter, but I enjoy a more drinkable one - slightly dryer and not as smoky."
"I'm not sure there is really anything I can say about this beer that has not already been said. It had been a while since I've come across this gem. We compared this with Stone Smoked Porter in a vertical tasting during halftime of the Super Bowl. Now Stone makes an outstanding smoked porter, but it left me almost wanting to dump it in the sink so I could get on with drinking the Alaskan. So velvety and rich, with a smoke bite almost that of an Aecht Schlenkerla beer. Dumbfoundingly good."
"admittedly not my favorite style; i have yet to run into a smoked porter that i really love. but a solid, well-balanced beer."
"Drinkability is a highlight of this one. A unique well done smoke flavor which isn't over loaded and a smooth body makes this one go down easy."
"Pours a very dark brown color, with ruddy, mahogany highlights at the edges. The tan head is tall, creamy, thick and dense. Looks fantastic! Its moderately roasty, lightly bitter, but somewhat sweet and wow, the finish is very chocolaty and delicious . The nose is lightly roasty and slightly more chocolaty, but overall, is only mildly aromatic. The head never really subsides, so retention is fantastic, and as expected, dense, thick foam coats the glass. Would like to try this on draft,"
"This one just came in the mail from Liquid Solutions, it's been a long wait. 2005 Version. Pours leaving a short, one centimeter thick head of brown/tan foam. The overall color is dark, but some light penetrates giving it those reddish hues. The smell is not overpowering, mostly hints of toasty/burnt coffee. Taste is very rich and dry. The flavors of toasty coffee are present, and its doesn't really seem that smoky. Finally in the finish I get the flavor of campfire smoke, just a hint. Bitterness is at a moderate level. The mouthfeel is nice, full body, semi-thick, nice carbonation. This is one of the most drinkable beers I have ever had. Its not the best or most complex, but its perfectly well-rounded. Many smoked beers over do it so I was glad that they were subtle. I have one more but I don't think that's going to be enough..."
"Truly an exceptional brew here. Pours a deep black with tan lacing. You definitely pick up the smoked peate malts right away when you take your first whiff. Taste is remarkable - smooth with mild smokiness done just right. This baby had cellared enough to mellow oh-so nicely. The truly beautiful label trumpets this real winner from Alaska..."
"Pours an opaque black with a tan head and some sticky lacing. Aroma is smokey with some bubblegum -- like sweet charcoal. Palate is lighter than expected with an unusual lingering hop presence. Flavor has a sweet start leading to a tart metallic middle and a (for a porter) crisp finish. Overall, I was not impressed. Maybe expectations were high. However, I did not find this porter to have well balanced characteristics."
"very smooth mouthfeel, and a damn good beer. impressive work from the boys and girls at alaskan. the numbers work out a bit higher for the stone mostly because of my cursed sweet tooth. but this is a porter not to be messed with."
"Mouthfeel is good, this is a porter so you expect low carbonation, but this could do with just a tiny bit more fizz to round out the strong flavors. It's got just the right thickness - (I think it's even a little thicker than some of Rogue's stouts) - to be far less filling than a stout, easy to drink, great with a meal. What a great offering from Alaskan Brewing!"
"Opaque black body, creamy off white head with no stick. Smells of earth, smoke, cheese. Malt up front followed closely by a smoke and smoked gouda character, goes down smooth with really no hops or bitterness to speak of. Slight roasted malt tinge but not much. Nice mouthfeel, though a little weak. An interesting and enjoyable beer. Paired well with some Stilton and beef stew. The smoke is robust and interesting but very well balanced. Absolutely one of the better smoked beers in memory. Much more balanced than many others."
"22 ounce bottle. 2005 and 6.5% ABV on label...thanks AKSmokedPorter for the wedding present."
"Someday I will visit Alaska until then I've had this experience."
"Body is big, oily, chewy, and extremely smooth. The smoke is subtle enough to really make this an easy drinking beer that would pair famously with BBQ food."
"A credible beer, a good porter, a good smoked beer, but I'm not sure why this is getting such high reviews. Maybe we just got an old bottle, but this beer left me with a terribly bitter aftertaste that just would not go away. Admittedly smoked beers are not my favorite style, but my husband, who loves smoked beers (such as Ithaca Gorges Smoked Porter) concurred with my opinion. For me, this one is not one worth going out of my way for."
"Drinkability - This one goes down really well, a really solid porter all around. I will definitly have more of this one."
"Wood smoked malts produce an excellent beer when executed as well as this one. Similar to the Bamberg rauchbiers, but the smoky note here produces smoked salmon characteristics, as opposed to the barbequed meat noted in the German rauchbiers. The smokiness is also a bit more retrained here, resulting in a very good drinkability. Definitely, the class of American smoked beers and worthy of its reputation."
"Smelled like salami. Strange smell for a beer, but it works in a strange way. This was the first time I tried it, and most likely the last time as well. Unique but not my style."
"Over all: just a great beer"
"The mouthfeel is velvety smooth and rich. Only has a light bitterness, and the finish doesn't provide a lasting sulphuric flavor like so many other smoked beers I've had. Easily the most drinkable smoked beer on the planet! Believe the hype!"
"Alcohol very well hidden and while not my favorite style, very enjoyable."
"Black beer with moderate tan head. The aroma is immediately smoky but you get some roastiness too. The alder smoke is not as heavy-handed as say hickory smoke or even beechwood (isn't that what rauchmalt comes from?)...it blends nicely with the roastiness. The flavor is good:. There is the smokiness, a little malty sweetness, and then a good dose of roasted bitterness and some hop bitterness too. This is well-done and a clear American classic, but the mouthfeel seemed a little thin and I think the beer could have been a tad more aggressive wrt maltiness and/or malt complexity without hurting the smoke profile at all."
"I'm surprised at how well this holds up with aging. This sample is four years old and other than a slight degradation in the aroma (which vanishes before the glass is empty), it could have been brewed yesterday. I would not advocate aging this beer. It is near-perfect; drink it immediately. Time won't improve it."
"One of the great beers of the world."
"The mouthfeel is moderate that suits this beer well. I love Rauchbeers, and this brew does an outstanding job of giving a distinct smokiness that is well balanced by the maltiness and allows the complexities to come through. This is a delightfull beer to enjoy on a fall evening while eating a hardy dinner."
"The flavor is slightly roasted and smokey, with a light but very noticeable mouthfeel. A breath out the nose after swallowing brings a coffee aroma. This beer gets smokier as it warms, gently lulling the drinker into a state of well-being, like a soft-spoken playboy in a padded leather chair in front of a roaring fireplace."
"It pours darks as night, with the slightest tan head. Its a foreboding darkness in liquid form. The smokiness is evident from the first scent. Its not subtle but its also not intense. Slight maltiness breathes through the powerful smoke. The taste is very unique. Of course, the smokiness is the first thing that hits you: almost a woodstove cedar flavor that could warm a ski lodge. The flavor lingers. It takes a few sips to get find enjoyment, but then its a very pleasant porter. This is the finest smoked beer Ive had. If you fear getting oversmoked like I did, give this a try. It might change your perception."
"Price per quality? ehhhh its good but c'mon."
"Overall, this style isn't my favorite, and so I'm trying to review on the style. Based on that, this beer is definetely a winner, even though I'm not likely to spend a lot of time with this beer. But I appreciate what it is, and that is good."
"Very tasty, not too filling, and not too rich. If it were available regularly, it'd replace Black Butte as my daily drinker, even with the higher price tag."
"This beer pours a very dark brown with a light brown head. The head fades quickly leaving a thin layer of foam and a good lacing. It smells smokey. It also smells like wood. The first time I had this beer I thought was like a campfire. I still think it smells like that. Not much hop aroma. I can detect a roasted malty aroma, but just slightly. This beer tastes strongly like smoked wood. Almost like I have a fire log in my mouth. Only not quite so strange, or gross. Behind the smokey wood flavor, I detect some maltyness. As with the aroma, I dont taste much in the way of hops. This beer has a bold aggressive smokey flavor. It is full bodies. It leaves a woody, smokey aftertaste. It is carbonated very well. This beer is very good, but I dont know if it would make a great session beer. Although the alcohol content is not too high, the aggressive flavor might not agree with a night of drinking. This beer is definately a winner. Do not pass it up."
"Wicked good."
"I don't know what else to say about this beer except that it's fantastic. I've had it on draft, and this review is based on a 2004 vintage bottle, but it doesn't really matter -- it's firkin fantastic no matter what. It is so goddman creamy and chocolaty, but then the subtle yet ever-present smoke adds a haunting depth of flavor that nothing else could provide. Add this to the fact that it's fairly well-hopped, and the balance of this beer is mind-blowing. A legend and deservedly so -- go out and try this, even if you don't think you like smoked beers."
"Cheers!"
"2004 edition. Interesting smokey taste and aroma from the unique wood used, well carbonated, perhaps a tad too much. Salt. Intense. Bit of bitterness in finish. Good with grilled meat and fish. Black of course. Quite a nice one and an easy, medium mouthfeel drink."
"A thick and nicely carbonated chocolate coffee chunk. Melts ever so briskly. The finish is roasted and mildly hoppy just the way I like it. I couldnt ask for much more than this in a Porter."
"the smoke . . . . the smoke"
"dark and impenetrable by light. cloudy film of murk rests atop this brew. foreboding. aroma of barbecue char and encompassing malty goodness. flavor ventures into a fishy realm, mildly.. leads into the big rauch smokiness (less than a german, more than most americans) which is nicely balanced a twice-burnt sugar flavor. perfect foil for the smokiness but adds to the overall character of fire, smoke, and beer. goes down very very smooth and represents true mastery of a style. suprisingly sweet in the finish, with mild roasted nut and slight fruit left. what a spectrum of flavor."
"Drinkability and Notes  Easy drinking because of the interesting flavors that change as you drink. A quality smoke beer, one of the best I have had, but not without flaws, I wish I could get this around here."
"GABF2004... Poured a nearly opaque, dark brown color with a tan head, that left light, sticky, tan lacing on the glass. Roasty, smokey meat, and cocoa in the aroma. Burnt wood, roasted and chocolate malts, and light alcohol in the finish. 2004 vintage."
"Thanks to cvschaller for sharing."
"Much more smoky in flavor. Lots of wood smoke flavor as well as meaty flavor. Much more like a Rauchbier this time around. Still not my favorite style, but I can appreciate that this one is pretty good."
"Drinkability is enormously high. This is a beer connoiseurs delight and really is an awesome beer paired with some smoked meat."
"This stuff is fantastic. I took on a bottle of the 2004 vintage on July 1, 2005. This is a void in deep space black. Not too bubbly, which really enhanced the mouthfeel and drinkability. Wonderful smokey taste, touch of bitterness, just overall fantastic beer. This went really, REALLY well with BBQ hamburgers. The smoked porter is now a regular for the cookout season. Give it a try."
"A wonderful beer, an American classic."
"Wonderful smoked aroma. Thick, black body with a tan head. A rush of dark, smokey, roasted flavours. Full of coffee and bitter chocolate. Some dark fruit flavours, a hint of sourness. Bitter and satisfying end. Thick, wonderful mouthfeel and IMO extremely drinkable. One of my all time favourite porters."
"Pretty much the definative smoked porter IMO (haven't had a chance to try Rogue Smoke, however), and one of my annualy anticipated beers."
"Drinkability: Very well done beer to style. Subtle sweetness controls some of the bolder flavors. Also the alcohol is well hidden. This beer does not have the flavor to hide more alcohol, so they've done well by not making a really big beer."
"Man, the folks at Alaskan Brewing Co. were not fooling around when they called this one a SMOKED Porter; the smoked character of this beer is pretty impressive. But, more generally, the beer is great all around: rich, thick, and very flavorful. Also, its surprisingly drinkable for a beer this rich and smokey. Ive heard a lot of good things about this beer and every word of it was true. Highly recommended!!"
"Drinkability: This is a great smoked porter that has a soft and enjoyable smokiness."
"Slàinte!"
" I think this beer is every bit as good as I expected it to be. The flavor is good and strong and very memorable. A pleasant surprise after some of the other smoke beers I've tasted and heard about. My only regret about this beer is that I don't live on the West Coast where it's readily available seasonally. I'd definetly reccommend it."
"form the bottle.to start off I am not a big fan of smoke beers. but this on was pretty good. poured dark brown to blac with a light tan head. aroma, smoke, malts, dark cheeries, dark chocolates as it warms. flavor, light smoke, malts, molasses, and a hint of apples. not to bad"
"Pours a dark, opaque brown with no head to speak of. Just a touch of white as I'm pouring. The aroma is full of smoked malt. Smells of bbq and peat come through. Tons of great smokiness in the flavor that lingers on the tongue. Hints of chocolate and coffee too. This would be great with a nice slow roasted or smoked pork. This is a very smooth beer. The mouthfeel is velvety and creamy. Wouldn't mind just a touch more carbonation. This is very tasty, it's hard keeping my hand off of the bottles I have left!"
"Excellent porter, wonderful smoked beer. Smokiness is well managed, with good presence, almost perfectly balanced with the maltiness. Killer nose, I could enjoy this beer without even taking a sip, but that would be depriving myself of greater joys. Savor this one..."
"Drinkbaility and Overall: Not a bad porter, but I think it may be a little over-hyped. The rauchbier feel to it kinda dampens the fun of a porter. It's still tasty, and one that's worth trying, but not one I'd drink all the time."
"Feel: Overly crisp. Medium feel with a dry lingering ovetone. Did my tastebuds evolve or did this beer become more like a soda? Miniscule point: ABV is 6.5%."
"This is wonderful beer to finish the day. The beer should be served towar the warm side of cellar temperature. This brings out all of the character. Now that it is in 22 oz. bottles one is plenty. Slow sips to savor the deep flavor."
"I buy a case every year and rotate the stock. I recommend everyone keep enough of this one in their beer collection to allow tastings at various times."
"I felt the same way about this one as I did the Stone Smoked Porter. They both taste like finely crafted beer but it's just a style that doesn't work for me."
"Alaskan Smoked Porter is good beer. Bulking up the body would help immensely and would turn it into something special. I can see how some just love it though. This a beer that I'll buy whenever I have the opportunity to do so. 2003 edition."
"Pours a deep black color with no head but when held to the light and tilted towards the mouth theres a decent carbonation level visable. Slight smoke aroma-almost a sweet black currant smell. Big malt flavor upfront with a healthy touch of smokiness. Great inky/oily flavor. Theres a well rounded softness to the whole thing-very well balanced. Great body-well suited to the overall flavor and feel of the beer. A very drinkable and enjoyable beer. I think the smokiness might get to be too much after several beers but thats just my opinion. Thanks a million to skyhand for the awesome trade. I had major doubts about ever being able to try this beer. Ive heard about it for many years."
"I'm not one who usually likes smoked beers, but the flavor and feel of this one gets me going hardcore. Somewhat big beer, and bigger on flavor. Bacon burps."
"Nice dense creamy head on a dark color showing light purple notes when looked at against the light. Great smell, everything I expect from a smiked beer: A deep smoky character, making me dream of bacon, mixed with notes of chocolate and fruit, with light hints of orange and raspberry. The taste keeps up with the great smell; the smoked character gets away from the bacon aspect to get closer to plain smoke and chocolate. The fruits appear later and stay in the aftertaste: no raspberries anymore, but oranges get combined with fresh notes of lemon. The mouthfeel is quite round, and enjoyably light wihtout being thin. It emphasizes the smooth and melting chocolate character, as the smoky aspect develops in the mouth by small poofs. A great drinkability for the style too."
"P.S. It annoys me that the brewer (like a few others) distributes this in the UK and Japan, but not the rest of the USA! Come on now!"
"I must try this with Mexican and BBQ!"
"An amazing beer experience."
"Had a bottle of this at Rich O's Public House. Pours a very dark color with a fluffy head that dies off quickly but leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is sweet and malty, but has a nice smoke character. The flavor is not at all what I expected. The smoke in the flavor here is wonderfully mixed. Some chocolate and coffee on top of the smooth smokiness. Drinkability is great and the body is full. I'll be having this one again."
"Pours an inky black with a beige two finger head that is quick to depart, nice lacing. The most striking feature of this beer is the huge nose; smoky hardwoods, charcoal bitterness, sweet caramel. Taste is much like aroma, smoked salmon and roasted malts which become more pronounced as the beer warms. There is a pleasant ""campfire"" quality reminiscent of a fishing camp in the Great Northwoods. Full bodied and a little creamy, this bomber didn't last long. I think this may be as close to a comfort beer as I can get."
"2004 edition. 22oz. bomber poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep midnight black color with three fingers of medium tan head. There is a good amount of lacing left down the sides of the glass. The smell is nice and smokey, and has a good amount of chocolate and coffee. Did I mention the smoke? Yeah, it's smokey. The taste is also smokey and chocolatey. A hint of espresso, and guess what? More smoke! I'm the kind of person that wants their smoked beer to be very full of smokey flavor, so this beer certainly didn't disappoint. The mouthfeel is very thick and strong, yet smooth and delicate. The drinkability is fantastic for a smoked beer. I heart this beer."
"This beer departed the bottle a very dark brown color, with ruby hues at the edges, and with a 3-4 finger head. The nose was very smokey, but a sweet smoke. Roasted and chocolate tones came through behind the smoke. This smells very nice. Not overdone, but still enough to know this is a smoked beer. The flavor was also a well balanced smoke and malt explosion. This beer is really not all hype. Its a good good beer. It was moderate to thick on the feel, with some smooth and creamy tones. I'm glad I have a bottle of this in my cellar for future consumption, as I will gladly drink a whole bomber of it."
"Black it would seem, maybe it is just a really dark brown hue. Either way the liquid looks yummy. The head was tan in color, rocky in texture. At the summit the foam was two-fingers in height. Head retention was good; it slowly faded to a clumpy cap. A few more moments later the cap broke apart to a bubbly collar, fairly thick. There was some subsequent lacing; it was unorganized and tattered but not widespread. The appearance is pleasing. The nose is smoky, it is not on par with Aecht Schlenkerla but in fairness I dont think it was brewed to be that loud. Actually the smoke is balanced perfectly with healthy charred/roasted malt. Okay, maybe balance isnt the proper wording because the smoke is a tickle louder. The smoke doesnt offer that typical bacon/sausage aroma; it smells woodier than anything with hints of smoked cheese. There are also hints of chocolate, coffee, peat, and even some vanilla. Rich campfire after-burn and the well rounded finish. The potency is only moderate, this sucks; I wanted it to scream at me. Deafen me with its aroma. It doesnt. Damn! I love what I smell, I really do. It is very inviting. Almost perfect. The palate is lovely. Like the nose the smoke has plenty of company in the form of roasted malt. As brewed, it is more Porter than Rauchbier. Lovely. Other Smoked Beers have disappointed me, not this one. I can see why it is so highly regarded; it is the perfect marriage of two styles (that is now considered just one). The smokiness, like the nose, is wood. Campfire residue ah, the memories this beer brings back. The malt provides some sweetness but the finish is largely dry. Chocolate kisses are semi-sweet. Coffee beans as well, more akin to espresso though. Hints of vanilla laced with caramel. Soft fruitiness too, kisses of cherries mainly. Light acidity. Hops offer the slightest bit of herbalness. In the finish the straight smokiness returns to complement the various roasted qualities. I enjoyed this Smoked Porter very much. Im obsessed with smoke and while this one is not out of control in this regard, it is brewed with obvious care. It is very well done. This 6.5% abv is hidden. I dont think the palate could be approved upon; its that delicious. A tickle fuller than medium in body, the carbonation is moderate and natural. The mouthfeel is very fitting for this beer, it is not too filling or too heavy but there is enough bulk. It is hearty but pliable. Enjoyable. To ask if this beer is drinking is insulting. Havent you been reading? Drink this beer with cheese and sausages. Drink this beer alone. Either way it is great. So often beers that are legendary end up being disappointing, this one wasnt. I understand the hype. This is a quality beverage. It is worth seeking out. I purchased this bomber of the 2004 edition on-line from Liquid Solutions."
"Served from a 22oz bomber, provided courtesy of trbeer, thanks! I've been waiting a while to try this one. Pours into the pint class an impenetrable dark coffee colored concoction, capped with wisps of pale tan head. Aroma is like sitting in a smokehouse, rich and thick and woody, with a slight hint of malt sweetness and hop. Flavor is perfectly smoked with a nice hop bitterness blending perfectly with a slight tartness. Easing back into the wood fire smoke, you gradually approch a smooth malty middle with just a bit of dark chocolate and the finish leaves you with just a hint of smokey bitterness. It's like when you bit into the best piece of smoked beef jerky and you gotta have more after the first taste. Delicious stuff, medium bodies and highly drinkable, probably the best smoked porter I've tried."
"The taste is where the real change comes in. The disappearance of smoke and hop flavor allows a nice mellow malt to come through. I think I enjoy this more after a year or so as the smoke flavor is not as overpowering. There is definately a more alcoholic bite. Still smooth and rather enjoyable."
"2004 bottle,pours and almost ink blank but I did see some ruby near the bottem of my glass with a thin mocha head,wow what aromas going on smoked meats,unsweetened chocolate and some earth what combination.Big and bold tasting as expected big dose of alder smoke and unsweeteded chocolate with a dry earthy/nutty finish.Wow complex and big my first stab at this leaves me quite impressed will get more in the future."
"This was from a 22oz 2004 edition bottle sampled on 12/17/04. A small light brown head formed over the almost pitch black body. It left a decent bit of lace before disappearing completely. A thick smoky roasty malt aroma hits the nose first before notes of chocolate come in from the background. It is also a bit sweet with caramel malt. The taste is very similar with a big does of smoky goodness over a dark chocolate backdrop. Very roasty with a bit of earth bitterness in the mix. As expected the finish is another smoky filled delight. Overall the smoke and chocolate sweet malts balance out quite nicely. Body is medium and creamy. Goes down smooth and I could definitely make a session out of this brew. One of the best smoky beers I have ever had, give it a try."
"Pours almost black with dark brown edges. Frothy head, reminiscent of chocolate milk. Initial smell is of, well, smoked meats. Smoked salmon, beef jerky, tobacco and some leather. Taste is pretty good - lots of roastiness, little bit of chocolate - finishes with a strong smokey flavor, perhaps a little much for my tastes. Excellent mouthfeel, silky smooth. Drinkability takes a hit due to visions of smoked salmon that I get with every sip. Based on my experience with smoked beers, smokier and more flavorful than a Stone Smoked Porter and much more balanced than Rogue's smoked offering."
"This is a genuinely special beer. Unlike the usual downwind-from-a-forest-fire palette rape of most smoked brews, this beer is a marvel of subtlety, balance and control. Don't want to get too far ahead of myself, but I'm not sure ""masterpiece"" is hyperbole in this case. Might be the must-have of the season."
"From a brown bomber, it pours dark brown with a trace of red showing through when it's held up to the light. The tan head is initially quite active but diminishes quickly. The smell is noticeably smoky, but subtly so. Also detectable are hints of chocolate and, to a lesser extent, licorice. It's certainly inviting and the taste lives up to the aroma. The smoke and chocolate flavors are nicely balanced by just enough hop kick. Damn, this stuff is smooth and goes down like mad. Why did I wait so long to try this beer?"
"I only picked up one of these, am I mad?, I am very seriously contemplating getting back down to Costa Mesa this weekend and investing in a whole Case of this stuff. SUPERB!"
"Overall: I think if you like really burnt imperial stouts, you'd probably like this one."
"1996, Smoked Porter. Appearance, dark with a semi opaque appearance. head indicated a medium amount of carbonation. Mouthfeel, was medium. taste, was smooth with a mild smokiness present. Additionally, a distinctive taste of mild hops is present. Smell, I detected a mild hint of smokiness, as well as hops. Overall a wonderfully aged beer despite the total amount of investment in patience (1996 minus 2004 = 8 years)."
"Thanks Pope!!!"
"This is a beer that I have been waiting for a long time to try. There are many great things about this beer. It looks delicous sitting in my Alaskan Brewing Comapny pint glass. The nearly black body and brown head are just begging for me to stop admiring the beer and start drinking it. This is my first smoked porter, and I have nothing to compare the beer to, so many of my descriptions may be of the smoked porter style instead of this beer itself, but I try to be objective regardless. The smell combines maltiness and a smoky smell. Malty goodness also powers the taste of the beer. The smoky taste is very clear, especially in the aftertaste. However, I cannot shake the connection I make of this beer to meat, having taated many smoked meats, and I find this slightly off-putting. The beer is also, in my mind, over-carbonated, approximately the same as soda. But, despite my criticisms and dissapointment in tasting this very hyped beer, I still feel that it is a tasty brew. It is one of those beers that is good every once in a while, but that once in a while I am perfectly cool with having several."
"2003 Edition. Opaque black/brown with a brown sugar colored head. Great wet campfire aroma, mixed with chocolate notes. Malt dominates this beer and the smoke isn't overdone. Hops are in the background, there is some bitternese, but flavor and aroma are not notable. Smooth and very drinkable, I really enjoyed this."
"Drinkability/notes: A legend among beer connoseurs, and as I see it, rightfully so. A beer that is likely to exceed all but the most unreasonable expectations. Thanks to BA Hardtarget for sharing this superb beer."
"Well it lives up to the expectations. Cellared this for over a year, the smell is strong of grilled fish and roasted bread. Hints of mocha/coffee. Pours a lighter black with hints of ruby, the head is phenomenal then settles to about an inch. The taste is light crisp and refreshing, the sweet caramel and coffee is not overly powerful and a slight citrus hop is detectable and blends the two together, perfect for those rainy days. Medium bodied and highly drinkable."
"The beer after disemboguing from the 22-ounce brown bottle takes its rightful place in my glass an Atramentous color with a mastodonic tan head that is spumous in texture and the residual lace a thick coating upon the glass. Nose dominated by the bittersweet aroma of toasted grain, sweet malt at the back, crisp and fresh to the senses, with the start sweet and thick with malt, the top full and rich in its feel to the palate. Finish is masterfully acidic, the hops authoritarian in their spiciness, very dry and long lasting after taste, to me this is one of the top 5 porters in all of Beerdom, hell it might even be number one."
"thanks garthwaite."
"Thanks to skyhand for the trade. 2003 Bottle: The beer is an almost opaque dark brown color with a thin light brown head. Thin and sticky lacing. The aroma of course has a strong smoked character, along with malt, soy sauce and coffee. Medium-bodied and mellow, with flavors of coffee, cocoa and malt underneath the smoke. The finish is dry and lightly bitter. I have been waiting awhile to get my hands on this beer and I was not let down."
"Opaque deep dark brown with a quickly phasing out light brown head. Forget some chocolate over your fireplace, put some bacon to medium fire, cut a slice or 2 of smoked ham, mix it all up and take a big sniff. Its mostly light, pretty much all about the smoke figures, but seems well done and balanced. Body is mostly light with moderate carbonation which could be less intense. Very mild acidity on the tongue, leather, herbal characteristics. This is not as good as Id hope. Dark roasted malt, licorice, molasses, very dry coffee lingers. I must say Im much more keen on the smoke focus in the aroma than the a little of everything on the palate where I lose the fire and woody characteristics that I love. I prefer a calumet or revenante."
"The flavor impact is highly affected by the smoke character. It is the first thing you notice and the single most impressive characteristic. Along the way the coffee and chocolate make their presence known, but only as subtle partners to the lovely smoky flavor. The feel is truly porter-ish, that is, somewhat less full bodied than other styles, but good for the style. Excellent drinkability for this style."
"4.5"
"Start with a damned good porter, mix in a soothing smoke presence, and you get this unique benchmark of the style. It's very simple, and that plays well with the crafty balance between the two chief elements. The smoke knocks it just a bit off center and helps to yield a wonderfully drinkable medley. I've heard a lot about this, and it's well-deserving of all the praise. So now I'll be the one talking it up."
"I eagerly look forward to 2004's alaskan smoked porter, and hope I can restrain myself enough to lay down a case for more than two months."
"Taste: A touch more bitter, hops are still fairly fresh."
"Simply fantastic."
"As Alexgash mentioned, on-tap at Marcellar's in Idaho Falls. What a great beer store/bar. ""Do you have any AK smoked porter."" Only on tap was their reply. Anyway, a smoke tinged black color with a nice light tan head. Mild smokey aromas made their way from the chalice but were matched by rich coffee and chocolate/vanilla malt aromas. Taste was full and smooth with great porter characteristics and a mild sweetness. The smoke comes through at the end and adds a brilliant complexity and fantastic campfire flavor. Great drinkability. A beer worthy of its hype."
"On our way up to the Tetons, chaduvel and I were lucky enough to find this rare gem ON TAP at Marcellar's in Idaho Falls. What luck! Served in a Kasteel, wide tulip glass, the body was a beautiful smoky black with an ashy light tan head. I let it warm up a little bit, and smells of campfire, roasted amaretto coffee, some bitterness and more meaty smokiness came forth. Taste started with sweet, smoky malts, with light fruitiness lurking. Moved to light roastiness as it went down the hatch and finished dry and roasty. Velvety smooth and quite drinkable. Not as smoky as Stone's SP, but just as good, if not better."
"BIG thanks to weefishheads for the help on this bottle, and a 2003 I'll coddle with selfish glee."
"2003 - It is a beautiful black with ruby highlights. the aroma has a good smokiness to it with some dark fruits. The fruitiness is evident in the taste with notes of raisin and plum and some bitter chocolate that finally explodes into smokiness. A real fine smoked beer. It is mellow despite the smokiness and stands up well to a fine cigar."
"Nice drinking Smoked beer..very good."
"The beer pours a deep black color with a thin dark brown head. The aroma is great! It boasts of black and roasted malts, but mostly of smoked wood. The taste is also great! It has a rich, dark, smokey flavor that lingers on the tongue. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This beer is really good. I love the smokey flavor; something rare in beers. It works well with the stout style. It goes down smooth; a real good beer."
"Like to thank AKSmokedPorter for the hook up! Thanks a lot bro!"
"Very dark brown beer that borders on black. Topped by a thin, dark tan head. Aroma is definitely smoky, but with nice amounts of roasted malt character and a bit of sweetness as well. Flavor also has a really nice smokiness to it. This is no subtle smoke like some beers. This one is smoked-salami smoky. There's also a bit of chocolate flavor and a touch of sweetness in there, then a good dose of bitterness on the finish. The flavors trail off, leaving a nice long, complex aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, bordering on watery, but at the same time smooth. I can't help but think that a more subsatntial mouthfeel would complement the robust flavors a bit better. It's almost as if the body of the beer is at odds with the flavor. Drinkability is decent, but I wouldn't call this anything near a session brew. An almost mystical brew from my ""wish list"" that I'm glad I had the chance to enjoy. Thanks, Bill."
"Well, it's nice to finally give this beer a try. It's certainly a great taste, rich and just the right amount of smokiness. Quite good, and one I'll have again in future years!"
"I had a hard time restraining myself with this beer as I was torn between the desires to gulp it down on one hand and savor it on the other. On the bottle it states ""enjoy now or cellar for a few years."" I'm already puting in my order to clear the shelf of BevMo's remaining stock so I can do both. A fabulous beer."
"Very dark. Ruby highlights flashed occassionally, but this was dark enough to be a stout. The head was weak and dissipated quickly. The aroma was smoky, but it wasn't overpowering. I'm not a big smoke fan, so this was a positive. The smoke actually worked nicely in the beer as it melded with the malts nicely. Smoked chocolate and a bit of pear flashes as the beer warms."
"I picked up a botle of 2002 vintage from a cooler in Eugene a couple of weeks ago. I had been looking forward to trying this beer for a couple of years and I was disappointed. It was a dark chocolate brown color with a big frothy, coffee colored head. The lace was decent. The aroma and taste were pretty smokey from alder wood. This smokey factor tiggered an association with salmon (also smoked with alder). I do like the smoked salmon from Yachats, Or., but I wouldn't like it in a glass.There was also some vinegar in the aroma and a little bit of concealed caramel in the taste. The finish was dry and not very tasty. I found the smokiness to be too overpowering. I liked other Alaskan beers I've tried, but this one just didn't taste good to me."
"Thanks Genaro!"
"Appearance: Deep dark ruby brown almost black with a suprsingly thin tan head very nice lacing is thick and even. Aroma: Was expecting more peated malts but this beer serves up very nice smoked meat tones of the Bamberg Germany tradition nice. Flavor: Tops this one off complex but the smoked meat characteristic is soothing and it complements the toasted malts doesn't barrage the palate I think it's excellent hands down the best rauchbier out there. Some sweet fruit tones peak through the smokey flavor but this beer is tasty and well worthy of all the hype. Mouthfeel: A bit thin for a porter but it's still medium bodied with a reserved carbonation it ties it together nicely in my opinion. Drinkability: Excellent very easy drinking complex but incredibly drinkable in my opinion, more so than it's German counterparts."
"Pours extremely dark brown -- appearing almost black in the nonick -- with a moderate, quickly diminishing brown head. Big malty aroma that adds to the flavor. Rich, full mouthfeel with a smoked taste that reminds me of eating smoked salmon. Very smooth, not bitter at all, it is none-the-less difficult to think of downing a bunch of these -- not because it isn't good, but because its so, well, rich. Like a good cheesecake or something -- you like it, but can only have so much. 2002 vintage sampled."
"The brew pulled into my mouth thick and velvety, but felt somewhat thinner as it rolled off my tounge. This was suprising, again considering the stout-like appearance. This thinning, combined with the dry crispness of the flavor, and perfect carbonation, made the beer extremely drinkable. I will be picking more of these up. Now for the later vintages..."
"2002 Vintage: 6.1%ABV. This brew is quite different than the 2001 version. It is still a very dark opaque black colour, but the 2002 versions has a smaller tan head that dies quickly. The aromas are much smokier than the aromas of the 2001 and the porter characteristics are not as noticeable to my nose. The taste is still quite smokey as well, with the nice roasted malts characteristics of chocolate and caramel flavors coming through nicely again. The mouthfeel seems a bit thinner on this sampl,e but that actually makes the drinkability better. I think I would score this the same as the 2001. It was very different, but still nice and imminently drinkable and enjoyable!"
"Overall, this is an outstanding smoked beer. The first time I had this beer some time ago I was unsure what to think of the smokiness, but it grew on me with every sampling. I thoroughly enjoy this one."
"Black with a medium tan head. No lacing. Huge smoke aroma, just like a Rauchbier. Reminds me of the Aecht Schlenkerla brews. Also has some good roasted malt aroma. Flavor is complex, smoked malts, roasted sweet malts and subtle chocolate and coffee flavors. Smooth body and overall a nice brew. Way more smoky than Stone's smoked porter. Nice brew!"
"Pours a very dark amber, with a visibility into the light of less than an inch and a half. Builds a struggling and fleeting darker tan head. On the nose is chocolate and amber malts with an underlying and not overpowering smoked character. Taste is bold of sweet chocolate and nut over a roasted malt, with the robust but not meaty smokiness lingering far into the aftertaste. Much more complex taste than i expected, and certainly enjoyable. The mouthfeel is subtle and silky, and not heavily carbonated, even for porter standards. More bold and interesting than other Alaskan brews I've tried."
"Medium bodied with a smooth creamy mouthfeel. Not a style I'm used to drinking and don't think I could drink more than one at a sitting, although this one went down pretty good. Looking forward to trying more smoked beers."
"A very smoky aroma wafts from my glass. This is just intensely aromatic. The taste reminds me of smoked salmon (sans any fishy component of course). Any signs of oxidation are clearly not evident, which makes sense as smoke is a good anti-oxidant. This is much lighter on the palate than when it is fresh. There is a smooth malty character in the background that is dry and meaty. The smooth smoke phenolics are dominating in this beer from start to finish."
"Quite an interesting and enoyable beer, one that I'll make an effort to return to again and again, to see if I can pull out more from it. As for this big, beautiful bottling, I had quite a time."
"While my first jaunt into this unexplored (for me) and exotic landscape was pleasurable and enlightening, it will take much further and deeper exploration for me to become accustom to the wild and adventuresome terrain. Surprising, unique, enlightening, and educational this territory will have to be revisited once my experience increases."
"ng"
"Update  Had a 2004 vintage in 2004 (imagine that). I picked up a lot more of the smoked flavor and enjoyed the easy-drinking nature of this beer. I still rated the Stone a tad higher for its complexity, but man oh man if there ever was a session smoked beer this is it."
"2002 bottled edition- Very, very dark brown color overall with deep ruby highlights within its realm of dark fog when held up to the light. Thin cocoa brown head that subsides quickly and leaves clear spotty lace. Smell has lots of good sweet roastyness to it, deep and rich, thick sweetened chocolate layered on top of heavily roasted malts, small hops and a hint of smokey woodish earth lightly showing up as it warms with a note of coffee in it. Taste is smooth and roasty sweet, light bitter sweet chocolate, lightly tangy sweet roasted malts. Well rounded and soft, a small amount of hops pleasantly keeps a nice bittering bite and balance over the roasty sweetness. Some coffeeish senses along with a gentle effervescense of smokeyness sneaks its way past the roasty sweetness as well. There's some dark fruity bread chewyness that reminds of a x-mas favorite of mine, a dark marble rye-cinnamon-cherry bread that makes it a pleasing memorable experience for me. Its not overly complex, it has very subtle qualities and when served at the desired warmer temp the smokey characteristics become a bit more noticeable, but never enough to overwhelm. Feel is smooth and creamy, medium, close to full body, lightly chewy aspect with a sticky roastyness covering the tongue and mouth in the finish; my favorite part of this beer, or for any porter for that matter. A very smooth drinkin' porter that goes down pretty easy. Its not quite as bold or rich as some, but its a definate keeper; worth the effort of finding and a must try for all."
"599"
"Notes: Wow, a tasty little porter, to be sure. Find this to be quite different from Stone's SP -- gentler, smoother, sweeter. A *huge* thanks goes out to my mom for bringing this back for me from her recent trip to Alaska. Wish this were available down here in LA."
"Notes: This was the 2001 bottling. Last year a friend in Alaska sent me 2 bottles, I set one down in my 'wine cellar' (a dark, cool corner of the basement) for a year, it came thru it's years rest with flying colors. Pair it with cheese, rye, smoked sausage or country ham."
"Thanks weefishheads.."
"A nice one. Lovely sausagy/hammy aroma and flavour, coupled with some nice roasty/ashyness, some nice chocolate and caramel flavours linger about aswell. A tasty, yet quite subtle smoked porter, evenly balanced, with some nice roasty bitterness in the finish, i liked this very much, delightful."
"A very good smoked porter."
"1999 bottle - Black color, medium head. Smoky aroma. An intense smoky flavor. Beer is made with ""alder smoked"" hops. Very malty, very intense, yet mellow smoky flavor. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is smoky and malty. Amazing beer. Smooth taste."
"Originally sampled on 17 January 2002. Break out the smoked sausage, the perfect beer to accompany it is here. Alaskan Smoked Porter is beautifully smokey. One whiff makes you think you're in a great deli, loaded w/ good smoked sausage. It pours jet black w/ a tan. It has a little bite on the tongue, but it's quite enjoyable."
"Mouth is roasted and smoky with a rich BBQ flavor and a rich barley body. Finish is mildly hoppy and sweet with a touch of smoky acid."
"2002 Vintage. Black in color with a thin, dark tan head. Aroma has a woody smokiness to it, very campfire-like. This sweetens as you become accustomed to it, taking on a more chocolatey malt character. The first sip is a really intriguing burnt malt flavor -- never had anything like it. This smokiness persists pretty much throughout the entire sip, but takes on an interestingly different character at each stage, manifesting itself in the mildly chocolatey mid-palate, and in hop finish, and lingering pleasantly in a long aftertaste. Body is creamy in texture, but there's enough tingle from the carbonation and bitterness to make it go down easily. A surprisingly drinkable beer. Bravo!"
"Pours very dark, almost black, in color with a foamy tan colored head that sticks all over the sides of the glass. Nose is roasted dark malts and chocolate with a bit of wet wood. A full-bodied brew with a smooth and creamy texture and a slightly warming alcohol presence (bottle lists the abv at 6.1%). Taste has a strong smoky wood and charcoal flavor throughout, but there are additional flavors layered behind the smokinesssweet malts towards the front with dark fruits and bitter coffee following soon after. A very nice brew. Pair this with some aged smoked cheddar cheese, and youre in for quite a treat! Purchased from Liquid Solutions."
"There was little detectable hop bitterness, but the abundance of roasted barley imparted its own bitter qualities, as well as some chocolate and coffee flavors. A very clean profile, though not noticably different from a standard porter. A 22oz bottle is the perfect serving."
"Drink  My wife tried to pour her class down the drain, and I grudgingly stopped her and offered to consume hers for her. I just do not get the hype. This is an expensive beer that does not give me anything worth the money."
"A big thanks to Davo for sending this my way."
"This beer tastes like a porter should with an added bonus of a unique smoked flavor that is excellent with foods: BBQ, Smoked Salmon and cheese. This beer is lightly carbonated which is a plus in my book but unfortuantley has a thin head because of this. I seem to recall more intense flavor when originally sampled that age seemed to dim, if your not a fan of smoked beers than aging it might be a good idea for you. This is the one of the best tasting beers I have ever had the only downside is that it isn't a session beer. One or two does it for a sitting, you don't want to drink too many of these."
"A successful foray into the realm of the smoke-flavored beer. I will definitely keep my last bottle and let it age for a few years."
"Again, thanks to my flat mate for a sample of this beer. Kind of pours like motor oil with no head. Very little carbonation in this one. The taste is of course smokey but mild. I would have to say it has just enough smoke flavor. Any more would through this out of balance. Malty and sweet with that warming feeling as it goes down. I believe this one could use some aging as the alcohol is a bit pronounced. A good beer that I want to try again. This bottle was from the 2002 batch."
"Drinkability & Notes: Not as legendary as so many of the aficionados said it was. A sound porter as a whole with a thickly line smoky backing, smoked cheese and meat would be the obvious pairing … why not try a contrast pairing of a grilled venison burger topped with soft pungent goat cheese and lime accented mayo … did me just fine."
"I was upset when I noticed the bottle said 2001 so this brew was a year old. A very dark porter, looks like a black Imperial Stout. Head retention was poor and lace was very sparse, perhaps this was due to the age? Smell was roasty and smoky as was the taste, mouthfeel a bit spritzy. Decent drinkability. I guess this isn't my favorite porter but I wish I had noticed the label."
"Had this fresh on tap at the Celtic Bayou for the first time (go figure).  Jet black in color with a pleasing tan head.  Bringing the glass to your nose brings odors of smoke and autumn (dry leaves and the like).  Smoke flavor was surprising well balanced with the rest of the beer and wasn't in your face like I had anticipated.  Other noticeable flavors were some sweer chocolate, fruits, and a slight port-like character.  Lots going on here and the smoke just serves to enhance everything.  Mouthfeel was very nice with the only ""negative"" thing being that the smokiness made me drink it more slowly.  Definitely worth seeking out."
"2001. Quite black in color with only a sliver of clear brown visible at the base of the glass. Pours a pillowy, deep tan head that holds well, eventually drops to a good collar, and leaves some excellent lace. The smoke is clearly present in the aroma. It's satisfying - much more like burning wood than dry leaves, or cigarettes (as some smoked, and even roasted barley tinted, beers can be). Much like the smell you pick up on yourself while camping. When combined with the earthiness and grassiness of the hops present, the aroma is like being out in the wild. It's slightly sharp, but not too acrid; with a delicate, ""woody"" taste. The smoke is backed by a lightly sweet, dark chocolatey maltiness and the aforementioned hops. Surprisingly, it's smokiness is continually noticeable and enjoyable. With some smoked beers, the smoke is mainly found at the outset, and then lost. The body is medium-full with a moderate carbonation level. The mouthfeel is nicely creamy. The flavor is softly fruity, and mainly chocolatey, with a lingering sherry-like character, some hops, and a really nice soft smokiness in the finish. Very well balanced, but also assertively hoppy! Very enjoyable; even comforting in a way. Quite complex, not just with the smoke adding an exciting layer, but within the beer itself. Quite rich, and very rewarding. Absolutely worth trying - even for the person who doesn't normally like smoked beers! This one is quite unique!"
"Thanks for the reaquaintance, jreitman."
"Very dark, just a little ruby light transmission at the bottom of the glass. Great soft head, slowly breaking bubbles and a good inch thick for quite a while...mild aroma, a little molasses. Smoky impression in the taste, combines with malts of coffee impression to give a woodsy taste, almost like coffee around the campfire in the morning. Smoke isn't overpowering. Nice lack of sweetness to me and the carbonation is well-done, neither flat nor over-charged. Aftertaste is pleasant, like a good Kenyan bean coffee, and with a slight fluffy impression. May be a little bitter to some, but I loved this! Many thanks to fellow Minnesotan BeerAdvocate Bighuge for the bottle."
"Had the 2000 and 2001 vintage.  Alder smoking is very apparent in the 2000 from the bottle, not so much from tapped 2001.  Just like drinking a vat of smoked salmon rubbed with dark malts.  I'm goin to save some of the 2000 for later.  Goes great with any type of wild meat and rich fish dishes.  Not a chugging brew for sure."
"Pours very, very close to jet black.  Lovely creamy brown head that laces the glass as I drink.  Smoked salmon and a little java on the nose. First impression as I taste is, ""Oh, this is a beauty.""  Very nice subtle bitterness and some great black coffee taste.  Very mellow and smooth.  Great roastiness.  Smoke is the main player here.  Not as dominant as I've had in other beers (like Batch 5000), but very, very nice. There is very nice balance between malt and hops in this medium bodied porter.  Neither is neglected, but rather both can be savored in this classic."
"An excellent smoked porter with the ""smoked"" flavor evident on the nose and the palate...Dark black in color with a nice soft head light head...I love the character in the body of this beer....the ""smoke"" flavor is nicely done and not overbearing at all, but I'm left wondering what this would taste like minus the ""smoke""..I think it would be a top notch porter even without it..(and personally I could drink a few more without the smoke taste)..still this is an excellent beer I feel fortunate to have tried.."
"Lovely lovely stuff here, bought 6 bottles from Belmont Station a few years back(I'm on the East Coast)...wish I had stashed a few away for safe keeping. Nice n' smoky, very well made...just wish it was more widely availiable!"
