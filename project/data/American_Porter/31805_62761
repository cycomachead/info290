The nose is initially spicy coffee-forward, but the maple sweetness comes through much stronger as the beer warms. The taste carries forward distinct maple sweetness, bacon smokiness, and coffee bitterness, while maintaining the integrity of a solid porter base - a very unique and enjoyable experience. Despite the heavy handed flavor profile and nearly-still body, I'm impressed by this beer's drinkability. The mouthfeel is rich with flavor, but isn't quite as heavy as a stout and despite the adjuncts, there is still some roasted malt in the finish that reminds me this is a porter.

Medium mouthfeel and sticky maple throughout with that nice smokey and salty bacon in the back finish. Overall, a pretty interesting porter.

It's different than Mornin' Delight in that the body is quite a bit lighter in this beer and the coffee tends to contribute more of a bitterness than actual flavour here, but the maple syrup is proportionally strong in this beer. The best comparison I can make is that this is a baby Good Morning, which is a compliment to both beers. Its hard to think of a brewery that does flavoured porters (and adjunct beers in general) better than Funky Buddha. Cheers!","Stevedore","Feb 05, 2015"

Beautiful aroma of smoke, chocolate, big maple syrup, coffee. Whoah. Flavor is big time maple syrup,big smokey bacon, coffee, light cocoa notes, roasty malts. Yep. It's all there. Medium bodied, creamy but not imperial stout heavy. Very easy drinking and really nice dessert. This lives up to the hype. Stoked to try the imperial version at Huna day.","BMMillsy","Jan 16, 2015"

As stated in an earlier review, sometimes this beer can be a little off but when it's on it's amazing!  The MBCP served at the release party at the brewery on 1/10/15 was the best I've had.  The coffee, maple and hint of smoke blended perfectly with just the right amount of hop bite for balance.  I went back to the brewery the next night and it was as good as I remembered.","ELS","Jan 12, 2015"

It's rather well balanced, though the flavor is a touch empty at the beginning and the base porter doesn't really seem to be important in this beer. It's mostly an adjunct show. Still, it was tasty and everyone quite enjoyed it. Would be very interested in trying this from the bottle. Thanks again Doodler! This was a fun treat.","Jeffo","0"

Fresh cooked breakfast, bacon fat, smoke, fresh brewed coffee, maple soaked pancakes and a bit of milk chocolate. Flavor is less intense but still good. Strong on the bacon, good robust coffee and ends in a sweet maple note. Very low carbonation. Even texture has that greasy feel mixed with warm sweet coffee and the feel of sticky syrup.

4.49,-0.2,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall: This is my first Funky Buddha beer and I gotta say that they nailed that authentic maple syrup aroma and flavor. Toppling Goliath is the only other brewery that can captured that maple syrup flavor and aroma in a beer. Great balance in reguards to the flavor profile and aroma from this beer; everything is well integrated. Funky Buddha has some great finesse that is showcased with this beer. This beer has bigger maple flavor than CBS, but it does not quite make it to the level of Toppling Goliath's Mornin Delight and Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout. So this is my 3rd favorite beer that is brewed with maple syrup as a brewing adjunct. Fantastic job Funky Buddha; I will be seeking out more of this beer. No doubt about it.","4DAloveofSTOUT","Beers"

Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, maple, bacon, smoke, and coffee aromas. Taste is much the same with maple, coffee, and smoke flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

The taste is really good too. A very bold maple taste the leads into a nice coffee taste and is finished with a smokey flavor. There is not too much bacon flavor for those people who are put off by that aspect. The looks are nothing special.

Anyway, this stuff pours a brackish black-brown topped by a half-finger of off-tan foam. The nose comprises rich cocoa, caramel, maple syrup, molasses, and Reese's peanut butter cups. Everything is richer than the thickest fudge I've ever had. Da-amn. The taste pretty much brings in more of the same, producing a veritable liquid version of a hot fudge sundae smothered in rich caramel sauce, with a tall coffee to drink and a side of maple-smoked bacon. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a fantastic beer, one I wish I could encapsulate in a candle or a spray or a spread or something, any way to keep it around as long as possible.","TMoney2591","Feb 16, 2013"

The smell on this beer is incredible - it really smells like breakfast as the coffee and maple are both very present and combine in an amazing way. Flavor is also top notch - the coffee really comes through on the front end, and it melds into a fantastic authentic maple syrup finish. The beer does an excellent job of not being too sweet while incorporating a number of different flavors. My only complaint was that I didn't get much of the bacon here. Mouthfeel is the only real knock on this beer, as it was noticeably thinner than a beer like this should be. It took away slightly from the experience, but not so bad. Overall, this is a top-notch, unique beer that absolutely lived up to the hype. It's got probably the best maple flavor I've ever had in a beer and works incredibly well.","starrdogg","Jun 04, 2012"

Had an aroma of coffee/roasty malts, maple and faint smoke. The coffee aroma was definitely more overpowering than the more subtle smoke/maple. The taste was that of black coffee, maple syrup and slight/faint smoke. As the beer warmed, the smoke and maple came out significantly more to create a more balanced "breakfast in a glass." Medium in body with low/no carbonation. Appropriate for a porter, though the flavors would have been even more enjoyable with a thicker mouthfeel. Overall, a great "concept beer" that was done very well. I would have preferred the maple and smoke to be a bit stronger to match the coffee flavor and balance out the beer a bit but I still enjoyed it as it was. I still think the Last Snow is a better porter, though seemingly not as well known. When you are drinking this beer, make sure you let it come up in temperature as that is when it really shines.","MsRif","Jun 04, 2012"

Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured pitch black with a half finger slightly tan off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate, and maple syrup. The flavor was of sweet malt, maple syrup, coffee, caramel, dark chocolate, and a very subtle smokey note. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this brew was just plain excellent. The flavor on this thing was crazy good. Maple syrup was the star of the show, but definitely not overpoweringly sweet as you would expect allowing some more of the sublte flavors to come through. The aroma just gives you a small hint at what is about to explode on your palate. Really glad I finally got a chance to try this brew and would love to do so again!

In so many ways this brew reminds me of the conglomeration of different beer styles that makes up Bullfrog's Gothika.

Scents of maple, vanilla, smoke, chocolate and a robust coffee presence make for a world class aroma. The taste does not disappoint, though it doesn't quite live up to the promises of the fabulous aroma. Fresh coffee and maple syrup are blended to perfection, with some chocolate and vanilla notes coming in behind. I actually thought this beer was higher in alcohol. Highly drinkable - I could sip this all night. In fact, that's what I did.","Huhzubendah","Feb 01, 2011"
4.68,4,5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"D-I would love this beer all day everday. Its small enough to have several of them, but has enough flavor to be able to enjoy several of them. Not much bacon, but a great beer from South Florida, breaking the shell of a beer wasteland. BOOM","drink1121","Jan 30, 2011"

4.97,10.4,4.5,5,5,5,5,"This was the best beer at the festival, it was the most drinkable out of all the big stouts which were being poured (Hunahpu, Big Bear's Imperial Stout, Swamp Heads Midnight Oil Treatment, and several other stouts/porters). Just a fantastic beer!","ScooterShooter42","Jan 28, 2011"
4.4,-2.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"The smell of this beer is... wow. It reminds me of breakfast. coffee and maple eminate so wonderfully from this beer. I didn't pick out the bacon so much but it didn't even matter, it was that good. For a brewery that has only been open since November; they certainly can brew an amazing beer. I loved that it had so much flavor but as soon as it was gone; it was gone. I had an IPA right after it and there was no lingering taste at all. drinkability was good, it was definitly a full-bodied beer with a ton of distinct flavors, one was enough for me as it was on the heavier side. but it was a great one!","Twiztidstyle","Jan 23, 2011"

4.44,-1.3,4,5,4.5,4,4,"D - A truly fantastic beer, best maple beer I have had to date. Would highly recommend and drink every chance I get. For their next trick, I hope they add some subtle smoke to it, to make it match the name.","AgentZero","Jan 22, 2011"
4.33,-3.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This is a very solid beer, but everything I got from it was very nice coffee porter with a little bit of smoke. While smelling and sipping, hoping to get some bacon, I might have caught a little whiff but never in the flavor. And I completely forgot about maple. I didn't catch maple at all...at all.","a74gent","Jan 22, 2011"
4.54,0.9,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"D - This was quite good, although the richness of flavor would make it hard to drink a ton. Still, I'm impressed - great coffee and maple flavors that are well-attenuated. Would love to have this one again.","MasterSki","Jan 22, 2011"
4.3,-4.4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"32oz Florida growler poured into Matilda glass, thanks again karl! Pours black with brown edges and a creamy tan/white head with very nice retention. Smell is sweet maple right off the bat, lots of coffee, a nice smokey, fatty bacon, followed by a porter malt character. Taste is lots of strong flavors that somehow dont overpower each other. Maple and coffee up front, finishes with a good strong porter malt base beer, very nice. Some roasted and chocolate malt but not a lot of hops. I expected there to be more of a smokey malt flavor, but the "bacon" is subtle, which is probably for the best. Too much bacon would ruin the beer. A bitter coffee finish with a maple aftertaste. Medium bodied with a fine light bubbly carbonation and creamy mouthfeel. I thought this beer was going to be gimmicky but it is actually an excellent beer. Very balanced and just as described, my only thought is that this beer could use a bit more smoke to add to the complexity. I look forward to trying more funky buddha beers.","nkersten","Jan 21, 2011"
4.76,5.8,3.5,5,5,3.5,5,"This is really good, and close to being world class. The name throws me the most and without the bacon reference I would have probably rated higher as going in I was expecting more smoke or some salty pork so I feel a little let down, if that's possible. I would certainly drink this again and recommend it highly. Just forget the name going in.","jrallen34","Jan 19, 2011"

4.65,3.3,4,4,5,4.5,5,"Drinkability is great! Funky Buddha has managed to pack a lot of flavor into a 6% beer. This is dangerously sessionable. Abuliarose and I will have no problem finishing off the 32 oz growler in front of us. I really wish these guys were closer to New Hampshire. I'll definitely be seeking out more of their beer in the future. Highly recommended. An exceptional American Porter.","sisuspeed","Beers"
4.92,9.3,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Overall I am quite impressed. It sounded like one of those beers that puts a bunch of stuff in but falls apart in the process. It's actually really, really well done. Wish I had more.","abuliarose","0"

4.94,9.8,4,5,5,5,5,"This is a blessing from the beer gods. This one has so much aroma and flavor it's crazy. The name says it all. You get the coffee in the aroma, the maple in the flavor with a little bit of bacon, all topped off with a great malt balance. Only available on draft so if your in the area I suggest you pick it up now.","dimenhetfield","Dec 18, 2010"

4.49,-0.2,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"An unexpected treat from jedwards. Pours the color and clarity of cola with some ruby red highlights around the edges and no head. Big coffee grounds character in the nose, with a hint of chocolate that gives it just a kiss of a mocha character. Taste reveals dark malts and a big maple syrup character, some earthiness and quite a bit of chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, with a pleasant, even carbonation. This is an outstanding American Porter. Incredibly flavorful and oh so drinkable. I must have more.","Jwale73","Nov 16, 2010"
