In the nose anchor porter produces a fantastic balance between sweet and malt while retaining the nutty richness expected in a porter. On the tongue this porter matches it's nose by creating a balanced sweet nutty malt that finishes with a fantastic bitter flavor on the tongue. In the mouth the presence of strong carbonation dominates leaving a smooth refreshing finishes that lingers with the delightful tickle of carbonation. Overall Anchor has delivered a top of the line Porter that masters appearance balance and mouthful. It is definitely in contention for my top Porter.","lsiberian","Jun 23, 2014"

Its got an advantage in the drinkability aspect for sure but, does it? I like the creamy texture of a ""typical"" porter. I don't know, loses character points but gains for originality. I'm confused. I think I need another beer. Cheers.","Emnmarko","Mar 12, 2014"

Aroma is dark fruity malts, more malts, and maybe a whiff of floral and earthy hops. Nice sweet malt complexity in the aroma, and the taste doesn't disappoint. Raisins, dates, cherries, some milk chocolate, coffee, and cola flavors but the dark fruits carry the day. The mouthfeel is silky smooth and a bit chewy, some hop bitterness on the finish but this beer is a vehicle for fruity malts, with the hops just keeping things from becoming too syrupy. Nice example of a ""robust porter"" from the BJCP style guidelines, almost approaches a sweet stout in flavor if not in body. A touch of bitter grain lingers on the palate. This could be my favorite Anchor beer. Its quite consistent from batch to batch, maybe the hops are more pronounced on rare occasions. Malt complexity along a sweet vein (check out Brekel's Brown for a different take on malty complexity).","CalgaryFMC","Sep 08, 2013"

The head lasts for quite some time and is rounded up by a thick wall of lacing. Light roasted malts and coffee come through, mild fruits and banana bread aromas are mixed in as well. It has a medium-to-light mouth feel(leaning more towards medium) and is sharp at first, light and crisp. It envelopes your mouth with a thin layer of creamy malts, the hops are hidden and the fruits flavors come out as it hits the sides of your mouth.

Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, chocolate, molasses, dark bread, raisin, light roast, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark bready malt and light roasted notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, molasses, chocolate, toffee, dark bread, floral, light roast, raisin, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, chocolate, molasses, dark bread, light roast, raisin, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Awesome balance and complexity of dark and bready malt flavors; with good roast/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent porter! All around great balance and complexity of bready and dark malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 02, 2013"

This is the standard by which I will measure every porter I have from this point on.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Jun 26, 2013"

Sierra Nevada porter has more of a bite and isn't as smooth as Anchor. It has a dark robust flavor and bitterness. A great beer for anyone who enjoys the darker malt side.","itrainedcold","Jun 07, 2013"

The smell is not as strong as other porters, there is subtle hints of malt and earth which are pleasent. The taste is a very smooth and well balanced porter that has a clean finish. Beer starts with a sweet caramelly malt that slowly turns in slightly bitter. The mouthfeel is medium body with smooth carbonation. Overall it is one fine porter.","WoodBrew","Feb 01, 2013"

Black as pitch with a tan head settled on top. Not much in the aroma department. This beer starts out smooth, then an abundance of flavor hits the palate: anise, molasses, burnt sugar and almost any brown sweet thing you can think of. It was too much. I was hoping for a Porter that would be more easy drinking than statement in your face beer. Worth a try, but the ODell Cutthroat Porter is still standing as my favorite Porter.","iSip","Dec 18, 2012"

This beer if smooth and sweet without being cloyingly so. I attribute this to the addition of black malt which provides the ashy and acidic flavor. This beer is also nicely hopped, like a good American porter you can taste them (northern brewer hops in this case) through the malt. Upon closer inspection I find no red highlights that commonly accompany many dark beers (through the use of roasted un-malted barley).","Theheroguy","Oct 20, 2012"

The body was a very dark brown color with moderate visible carbonation. The nose had definite notes of roasted malts with hints of smoke, coffee and mild chocolate. The taste had a lot of the coffee that was apparent in the nose. There were also some notes of chocolate and vanilla. This was a really well-balanced beer. The bitterness and malt really worked in concert with each other. The carbonation was moderate and really went well with the flavors in the brew. The body was perfect as well, it wasn’t too thick or thin. The finish was pretty quick with the same coffee flavor. This was definitely an awesome brew, especially for a cold night. I would definitely have this one again.","mgironta","Sep 16, 2012"

There are plenty of dark roasted malts along with those flavors of chocolate and coffee. It also tastes a little sweet up front with some back end bitterness. These flavors are very well balanced.

Usually porters are all about coffee and chocolate bitterness, but i love the sweet rye base flavor of this one together with the more subtle usual porter flavors. It gives more body and balance to it then any other porter i've had (quite a lot). So for me this one is the benchmark right now :) Highly recommended!","Arno","Aug 17, 2012"

I'm also noticing a metallic flavor that I don't recall the last time I had this. A bit of warming up may be in order reveal the full flavor profile. Warming does indeed reveal some dark fruit and alcoholic warmth. On the whole, this is a very drinkable, balanced porter with a delicious finish to boot. A quality offering from Anchor.","MaximalC","Apr 21, 2012"

One of the best smelling porters I have so far come across. A sweet and rich flavor that aroma totally hinted was coming. Chocolate and caramel, some dark fruit, creamy, with a great roasted finish. A nice creamy medium bodied mouthfeel to this. Move over Black Butte Porter, there's a new porter in town!

Head is about one finger tall, off white in color, head recedes to a patchy film, leaving a few strings of lacing. Smell is of rich sweet malts, and dark fruit. Taste follows the same path of being rich and sweet without much roasted character. On the front of my to hue I get dark fruit, I also get some toffee, just a subtle touch of roasty flavor in the finish. I am not a frequent porter drinker, but my usual is Black Butte Porter, which seems colpletely different to me, they seem to be to different stylistic approaches. I do like this interpretation of the porter by anchor though. If you crave a strong, deep sweet beer with less emphasis on the roasted flavors, this is the one for you.","gkunkle","Jan 28, 2012"

By the Beard of Zeus! The glorious dark color and creamy topping was tantalizing. I was very pleased with it's drinkability. Porters and BA ratings are both new to me so I'm not sure how to rate and hesitate rating with any ""5's"". I'm not sure I have the discernable palate and ability to identify key notes as many BA members do, but I believe an earthy and slightly coffee flavor was detected. Subtle sweet/bitter taste.

Quick note on them: An amazing store, lots of brewery name beer glasses, lots of hard to find brands like Deschutes and DFH, tons of imported 750ml bottles including some Trappists, AND they sell single beers. Anything from NewCastle to Red Seal Ale. An excellent way of trying beers you wouldn't be able to drink a six-pack of. Back to the beer. Beautiful black color, looks lovely in a snifter. Just a few points off perfect. I couldn't get much flavor besides the roasty malts and yeast. Forgive me if im wrong. Either way amazing beer. ill defiantly pick up more. I would buy a sixer of this even though it would take me a while to finish it due to a queue of lighter beers, but every time I see a CostPlus I won't think twice about a picking up a single to enjoy by a fire.

The head stays around for a long time, and there's a lot of lacing left behind on the glass. Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and some dark fruit. The taste is similar to the aroma, but the dark fruit flavors (plum, raisins) and bittersweet chocolate flavors are the strongest, and some burnt/charred malt flavors are noticable too.

Pretty much jet black to onyx colored liquid, sliver of dark zinc orange at the bottom, The nose is much more sour and penetrating than many of its ilk, as if it wants to show sour milk next to the powdered cocoa and caramel. slight pickled quality to it, the more you sniff it the more you realize that it has a lean, semi-defiant attitude that almost wants to play down any roast to toast as well as plum, cherry, apricot scents and leave it all to the standoffish malts to win the day. In the mouth the sourness doesn't try to hide, lemon and orange front and center, herbal streak there too. Hard breakfast pastry character to it, not soft like a croissant but not entirely charmless either. Loads of cocoa powder and cofee, heavy duty, coats the peach, apple, pear fruit close to fully. Has a distinct personality, something I'm willing to accept readily, still not a beer that seems interesting in crafting a fully enjoyable experience.","farrago","Mar 11, 2011"

4.73,15.4,4.5,4,5,5,5,"Poured a dark brown color with a nice thick tan head from a 12 oz stout bottle, with no ABV or freshness date. Good head retention with the beer turning pitch black once poured completely. The aroma is mainly malty, with hints of nuts, caramel and yeast with faint aroma of hops in the background. The taste is roasted malts/nuts with lingering chocolate and coffee aftertaste. Hops make their presence felt in every other sip, but otherwise it is a beautiful, silky rich blend of nuts, chocolate and malts which coat the palate. The taste definitely gets better as the beer warms up. The lacing is very good; everything about this beer leaves you wanting more. This is, in my opinion one of the finest porters available. Very high drinkability and is definitely a beer which I can have anytime, anyplace. A must-have for every porter lover; VERY highly recommended.","CaptDavyJones","Dec 14, 2010"

Robust burnt smokey malt flavor balanced with a very smooth and sweet chocolate. Expresso flavors are abundant. There is just enough hop biterness at the end to balance. The roasted sweet malty flavors are allowed to do their thing. Great thick creamy chewy mouthfeel makes it satisfying without being too heavy. Goes down nice without being a gut-bomb.

A thick looking beer with a thick, tight cream/tan head about an inch in stature. Pokadot spots. Scents exude roasted malt, chocolate, coffee grinds, cream, and a bouquet of hops to round it out. Dark fruits with some warming, kinda rotted, nothing large though. This is a nicely rounded porter for such low strength, Up front a mix of vanilla/cram and roasted malt, followed by chocolate/coffee, finished with dark fruit and licorice in the end, although minimal. All in all a tasty treat. The body is built up for the low ABV output, that for one is impressive. A silky body thats a strong medium build and slight carb in feel. A very respectable porter and my favorite offering from this brewery.","BARFLYB","Nov 10, 2010"

Head slowly collapses to half its volume within minutes. Thin, concentric bands of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Not much happening with the nose - some faint, roasted malt character and perhaps a hint of lactose sweetness. Flavor profile expresses light, roasted malt, a hint of cocoa, a slightly metallic character and perhaps some nuttiness. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lively, effervescent carbonation. All and all, not a bad porter, but carbonation is a little too assertive, approaching fizzy, and the flavor seemed just a little off.","Jwale73","Oct 31, 2010"

This is one of the very few porters that really stands out as stylistically different from a stout. The roast character is quite subtle and only really comes out in the finish. Dark sugar characteristics dominate with a spiciness that seems to be more in line with what a porter would have traditionally been expected to taste like.

Lots of chocolate up front. Hop bitterness comes mid-taste and remains throughout the swallow. Full bodied with high carbonation, this is a rich brew. The aftertaste is largely hop, but sweet carmelized sugar comes through as a balance. The bitterness lingers long after the sweetness dissipates.","Anthony1","Aug 09, 2010"

4.38,6.8,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bottle, home. Excellent porter, one of my favorite hometown beers. Anchor Porter pours a very dark shade of brownish ruby, nice highlights in the light, transparent but for the color. The head is big and creamy. The aroma is a mix of chocolate, coffee, roast, plums, molasses, mild booze, some porter ashiness, dates, blackberries, toasted granola. The flavor is smooth and rich. It's intense for the abv with a lot of roast, dark fruits and brown sugar/molasses/caramel. The hops give just enough bite to reign things in. It's one of the best porters around, in my opinion, and it's relatively cheap and well-distributed - a testament to Anchor's success.","popery","Apr 10, 2010"

I really like the cocoa aspect of this porter. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, nice carbonation and no warming. A nice coat of hoppy roasted malts is left on the tongue. Very appropriate for this taste. Drinkability is awesome here, the taste and price of this beer rule for the quality of it.

While pouring it, it almost has the classic stout nitro effect to it where you can really see the bubbles rising. I was a little dissapointed with the smell, but it's still better than average. You can detect there is a lot to the smell, but it's just not very strong. A bit of a smokey smell, burned malts, and hints of some chocolate and coffee followed by some hops at the end. The taste took a huge jump. Still has quite a bit going on like the smell, but much, much stronger. Very malty, roasted with coffee and chocolate and has a nice hop afteratste. Wonderfully balanced and put together. The mouthfeel is good, it has a good bitter finish from the hop, and the carbonation is perfect, very drinkable.","AndyAvalanche","Nov 30, 2009"

3.3,-19.5,4,4,3,3,3,"Pours the darkest of dark browns with a big puffy tan head that is taking its time dissipating. The aroma is of a rich pumpernickle bready malt, light roast and caramel malt. The taste is of a caramelt malt, toffee and very buttery. A roasted malt flavor runs throughout the profile. Very full body with soft carbonation; malty sweet. This is a very thick porter. Too thick in my opinion. Make a beer this thick, call it a stout. Not a big fan of thick porters, especially with this flavor profile, no need. Overall, a big porter with a big caramel/buttery/roasted malt flavor. Too big for the style. I feel porters should be a bit more crisp and refreshing. This is just heavy and buttery.","Gmann","Nov 25, 2009"

There was a little hop bitterness too, which served to blunt the sour edge a bit. I was unable to perceive any appreciable chocolate flavor. The feel was medium bodied with good carbonation.

Rich malty initial flavor that leads to a well balanced bitter aftertaste that has roasted and burnt malt, caramel and a bit of hops. My only complaint is that it occasionally seems slightly medicinal as it warms. The smooth, medium bodied texture is basically perfect. lighter than a stout but not at all watery.

Here's the earlier note, edited for my latest tasting:   I'm on a bit of a porter run lately, ever since someone (thanks CB!) left one in the fridge. So I dug a bit deeper into the BA recommendations and pulled Anchor Porter off the list (since I knew I could find it here). The reviews mentioned a definite hops presence... something I had not yet tasted in a porter. So I bought some and tried it. Definitely different--unique (in a good way)--and drinkable. A tiny bit more carbonation than normally seen in a porter and helps bring out the flavor, IMHO. Deep brown (to black, with red/mahogany highlights) in the glass with a massive head of tan foam (like its Steam Beer cousin) that provided a nice lacing throughout. Roasted (without being smoky) malt in the nose and initial taste, but the fruity hops flavor kicks in almost immediately and really softens the smoky roasted flavor. It's like two beers in one. And the rich flavor of the porter is perfectly balanced. Very enjoyable. Very drinkable. Another ""hit"" on my list thanks to the recommendations from BA.","tugdriver7","Sep 13, 2008"

The head is modest but a nice brown and it does retain and lace around the edges. The smell is delightful. This is sweet biscuity malts, chocolate, molasses, and caramel. The consistency is medium bodied, very creamy, and modestly carbonated. The carbonation is just right in that it's not over the top, nor flat. The taste is good, but I will part company a little with many of the reviewers in that the hoppy and almost citric bite detracts from the dextrin sweetness of the malts and the chocolate and caramel flavors. There might be some fig or apricot (what I call heavy fruit) flavors but only a tinge. The chocolate comes through as things settle a bit. The beer could be considered balanced, but there may be just too much hoppiness in there for what I was expecting. The taste is a small let down from the wonderful aroma of the beer. As for aftertaste, this is quite mild and the drinkability factor is good. One could have quite a few of these without worry. The ABV is light enough that you could indulge.","albern","Jan 25, 2008"

The faintest ruby highlight makes it through the beer when held to a light. The aroma is moderately roasted, a little chocolately, and moderately sweet. The flavor is moderately roasty, slightly sweet, and has medium-low hop bitterness. The finish is quite smooth and leaves a blend of sweetness and roasted malts on the tongue. The carbonation is moderate and body is medium-full. Overall I thought this was a well done porter. A very nice beer to look at and the flavor is not overdone in any way; everything compliments each other, I especially like the bittersweet nature of the taste.","uwmgdman","May 22, 2007"

Blast of citric hops is the comparative advantage; they also lend a unique herbal medicine-flair.

Spotty, scattered lacing. The big aromas that come out first are of chocolate, molasses, and toasted bread. Some roastedness comes out a bit, but it isn't all that prevalent. Some underlying fruit and cookie dough. The flavors in this blend so fluidly that it takes some concentration to pick out the flavors. Starts off with a bready pumperknickle flavor and dark chocolate with hints of cane syrup. Some ale fruitiness is present in the middle and this rounds out with a dry and bitter finish, thanks to the PNW hops. Some citrus and pine lingers on with nutty flavors.

4.2,2.4,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"The pour into my Fuller's nonic raises a quick-settling two-finger plus head. It seems to find comfort at one finger, and stays there for a while. The head is a darker tan, and very creamy looking. Leaves sudsy lacing that elongates down the glass more than most beers. The color is fully opaque. The head does manage to finally come down to surface lacing, so I can't give quite a perfect score. The nose reeks (nicely, though) of molasses, caramel, and brown sugar, with definitely sweet chocolate notes. Reminiscent of a milk stout. The taste is not as markedly sweet as the nose would suggest. Rather, it feels balanced, with the addition of some acidity. Rich in dark fruit tones and chocolate, the beer then ends in a slight, lingering coffee bitterness, with sharp acidity running throughout. Very nice, although I would personally like to see more chocolate. The mouth is medium, with fine carbonation. A tad more body would be appreciated, but it's still very nice.

The taste is medium sweet robust, the toasted/charred malt is very present and pleasing along with the presence of a hops that come to the front toward the end in a very supportive role. The finish is rounded off with a sweet coffee flavor. The mouth-feel on this one is a little milky and less crisp than most beers I drink, which is still pleasant, how ever I think I could only drink so many of these because they seem to sit a little heavier in my stomach than that of most quads even. This is a tasty beer maybe because of the lack of crisp carbonation it seems to be a little too heavy for me, but honestly its a very enjoyable beer. Personally I could do with a little more strength too, but that really doesn't turn me off. Get some.","mmcave","Oct 22, 2006"

It goes down nicely and has a roast flavour to it, but not a burnt flavour that you can find in some porters.

Taste is truly full, deep roasted malt, sweet malts, with detectable layers to the malt profile (pale? caramel? chocolate)... Finishes hoppy in a suble way that simply balances out the sweetness but doesn't linger long. Finishes extra dry. This is such a smooth tasting beer, and paired excellently with a good burger. Mouthfeel is bright, minimal carbonation, full tasting, and shouldn't be any lighter, but just thick enough to satisfy--not watery like a guinness.

Aroma is heavy on the hops and malt, perhaps a bit of coffee and bitter chocolate. The taste is heavy hops and alcohol, with the maltiness powering through. Aftertaste of malts and chocolate continue, but is very mild and balanced. A creamy yet somewhat bitter brew that confused me a bit. I would say that the mouthfeel is creamy and low carbonated and that the drinkability is high as far as porters are concerned.

Moderately carbonated and shows good proteins and retention. Smells unmistakenly chocolate and coffee with a light toffee sweetness and a mild lactose softness. Tastes boldly of bittersweet cocoa, columbia coffee, roasty and toasty. Lightly hopped for balance, but not flavor. A soft sweetness lingers into the aftertaste. Has a full, rich, soft feel to the mouth with a lightly roasty bitter finish. The acidity seems a bit high, combined with roastedness and a light scrubbed carbonation, are the only factors keeping this beer out of my top 10.","BEERchitect","Feb 18, 2006"

Aromas of coffee, caramel and earthy (almost like compost) hops. Earthy pine bitterness from the hops is the first thing I notice about the taste. A caramel malt sweetness climbs aboard after rounding the horn with a metallic bite at the finish, which is followed by an espresso roast aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel for the most part with a satisfyingly dry finish. This is simply a superb porter -- one of the best I've ever had. It's pretty rich for a porter which shaves a couple points off the drinkability for me, but damn fine nonetheless. Damn fine, indeed...","orfeu","Feb 17, 2006"

The malt flavor is full and sweet. Hints of coffee and chocolate with a nice dry bitterness. It's almost a bit tangy also, different than many other porters.

After about 5 mins the head sinks down to a small cap. Dark bitter chocolate malt dominate the nose with hints of coffee there too. After first sip the choc/coffee maltiness linger with some kind of astringency that almost leaves me tasting something that reminds me of mint. Carbonation if just about right on being just enough.

Smells like the typical porter, of dark chocolate and roasted espresso beans and malty with a slight bitter tinge. Smell is much weaker than the taste, which is a mirror sense of the smell only deeper and more complex, finishes sweet after a bitter beginning. Bitterness is similar to that of a shot of straight black espresso, but falls off into the malt and sweetens. Mouthfeel is watery thin yet slick and syrupy on the tongue thanks to the low level of carbonation present in this brew. Drinkability nothing special, marks with other porters in my book, a little above average. All in all a nice take on the American Porter.","danielocean03","Jan 18, 2006"

The taste is even better. There is chocolate, more like bakers cocoa. actually its like chocolate covered cherries. Licorice, molasses, and sweet vanilla.

Pours a forbiddingly dark brown, sealed by a solid inch of clingy, sandy brown head that lasts a while. Aromas of roasted barley, dark chocolate, and sweetish raisins/toffee are offset by a smooth mocha coffee bitterness. Rich roasted malt flavors up front. Smooth, chocolatey, perfectly sweet, with a hint of smoke. Very nice. Sweetness is near-perfectly balanced by a big wave of hop bitterness. I can almost taste the resin through the roasted coffee. Finish stays bitter, but with latent milk chocolate and toffee sweetness. Medium-full bodied with a smooth feel. One of the best porters I've ever had.","alexgash","Jul 11, 2005"

Roasted malts and toffee maltiness dominate the aroma, with a bit of dark, ripe fruits thrown in for good measure. Ripe fruitiness similar to dates and figs hits the palate first, quickly followed by a chocolately, roasted maltiness. Moderate bitterness that blends very well with the dark malts.

Smell is sweeter than I would have expected. First noticed is the caramel and toffee and little bit of dark fruit. Chocolate and a hint of coffee are also present, with a faint whiff of alcohol. Taste is very rich and creamy. Bittersweet chocolate and coffee are first on the palate, along with some roasted grain. Then comes that toffee and caramel sweetness to finish things off in a creamy, sweet, yet roasted manner. Hints of bitter hops peck at the tongue, but never fully show themselves.

Very smooth from top to bottom. If this one's around and I'm looking for a dark beer, this will be my choice next time.","Backer2004","Mar 26, 2005"

This beer has an incredible thick and heavy yet very smooth mouthfeel. It has a very strong bold taste that really opens your eyes. Some hints of coffee and bitter chocolate are apparent. This beer should be savored, but as each drink continues to get better and better, you'll quickly find yourself in front of an empty glass. Wonderful for a cold winter night, I could drink several of these without ever getting tired of them. Excellent porter.","jasonpeckins32","Mar 24, 2005"

The beer itself leaves a nice lacing after a quite enjoyable swig of chocolate, bitter sweetness. My only slight issue with this offering is that it is a little on the high side for carbonation, but that could be because the serving temp was a little on the low side.

The taste was pretty good, but was missing an extra kick. The chocolate notes were great, and mixed well with the almost sweet nuttyness, but it needed something else to push it over the edge. The mouthfeel was incredibly lucious and creamy, just like a porter should be. I love my porters, and tonight I got to try the Smuttynose Robust Porter. It's definily better than this one, but this is also a solid choice.","santoslhalper","Mar 06, 2005"

A subtle yet complex flavor that is quite drinkable. Well worth a try. Cheers","sinistermadman","Mar 06, 2005"
3.33,-18.8,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"The beer pours very dark and similar to a stout. However, the toffee-colored head does not retain itself as well. The lace is quite sticky and sticks to the edge of the glass. The aroma is of toffee and vanilla. the flavor has just a mild hop kick, but is nicely balanced with the malt. Also present is a very mild chocolate teaser and an unfortunate (but slight) burnt rubber taste. The mouthfeel is just slightly bitter from the hops, but has a very pleasant and satisfying heavy feel. this would make a great beer to introduce a dark beer to someone. Nothing overwhelming, but very mellow and balanced.","MuddyFeet","Feb 10, 2005"

Hints of chocolate,cinnamon and licorice. Big roasty malt flavor. Somewhat grainy. Subtle chocolate in the backround. Theres a ""hashness"" I have always found to this beer-its very slight and underlying but its there. Not unpleasant just a certain characteristic of the brew. Never found it in any other porters. Maybe its how the roasted malt comes thru? Wonderful body. Very full for the abv. A classic beer like almost all the other Anchor products. I havnt had this for ages-need to get it regularly.","lackenhauser","Feb 03, 2005"

Roasty malts up front with a fruity sweetness and grapey winelike aroma. Bitter hops detectable too, as are notes of sugary plums and berries. The head still hasn't shrank any and I still haven't taken a sip... Nice well balanced and full flavored taste. Toasty malts are there but don't hog all the space. Plenty of room for the bitter hops. Complex flavors. I'm picking up on root beer, creamy milk, sweet plums and other fruits, and maybe just the perfect tiny hint of chocolate. Smooth and creamy medium to full mouthfeel. This is a great example of a session beer that is well balanced yet complex and interesting at the same time. A great example of a porter.","twelvsies","Feb 02, 2005"

Finish is clean and the mouthfeel is good...really a little too thin for me, though. Drinkability is quite good.

4.6,12.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"here's what i love about anchor brewing: they don't try to brew anything weird like dfh or over the top like stone (not that there's anything wrong with either of those things), but rather, they concentrate on simply brewing world-class, damn tasty brews that are very faithful to their respective styles. the anchor porter is no exception. it pours a dark as hell brown to black colour with a big ole foamy off-white head. the aroma is off chocolate, malt, burnt wood, earth and a touch of caramel. simply solid and good all around. the flavour is spot on for a porter: it's big but not huge nor overwhelming. there's also a nice creamy texture to this one. the creaminess is mostly chocolate in nature and is complimented by a nice dose of burnt/roasted malt flavour. caramel is intermingled here and there as well as a touch of coffee and alcohol. spot on flavour, for the most part. i really have no complaints about this brew whatsoever. it may soon become a regular in my fridge.","SixpointJMH","Sep 27, 2004"
4.27,4.1,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Nice velvety brownish head, dense and lasting, on a very dark purple/mahogany color. The smell is complex and interesting: some fine chocolate trufle, some vinous notes of porto, and hints of overripe red fruits. The taste reproduces this complexity: chocolate and coffee have a deep effect on the tongue and the palate, being very smoky and roasted. A certain saltiness bites the tongue and makes this beer reminiscent of the sea(?), light hints of coconut announce the more fruity aspects of the brew together with sweet notes of citrus. Mouthfeel is great, sharp and consistent. Greatly robust and woody. A bit doughy. Nicely hoppy too. A pretty intense experience. It's like this beer were saying ""there'll be no white flags and no peace talks"". It doesn't let up. This is a beer for fighters, hunters and lovers. It probably doesn't fit in my favorite beers category, but I can definitely appreciate its qualities.","tjd25","Sep 21, 2004"

Nose is toffee, coffee-ish and roasty malts; slight hoppy undercurrent, but predominantly malty and rich smelling, with a slight notion of toasted marshmallow. Roasty malt astringency hits the palate first, then the dark malts and light berry notes kick in, and finishes off with a slight hop dryness and further suggestions of chocolate and coffee. One of the better domestic porters out there. Flavors meld together well, especially at cellar temperature. Very smooth and enjoyable. Subtler carbonation is appropriate for this beer. I've done some vertical tastings between English porters and American counterparts, and I always seem to prefer the aggressive roasty maltiness of the domestic porters.

The big thing was the chocolate though. The head was a pillowy/frothy beast that lasted a long time and left a nice impression on me over it. The taste was another good part to the brew.

First thing that hits the nose is the toffee and caramel. Perhaps a hint of butterscotch as well, but very faint. Taste is superb. Nice roasted malts make up this brew. Some toffee is also present, but not much. It's also very smooth and creamy. Probably rivals the Taddy Porter for one of the best porters out there.","necoadam","Apr 04, 2004"

It smelled like a chocolate milkshake...very malty and sweet and wonderful. The taste was very similar to the smell, no surprises when it hits your toungue. It is all malt out of the gate, chocolate kicks in about midway through, and I believe a tiny hop presence asserts itself as you slide into the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is very creamy and thick. The carbonation seemed a little high for a porter, but I didn't mind it at all...it contributed to a wonderful beer.

Flavor, wow! more smoky, sweet molasses rush the palate; subdued coffee in the middle becoming more pronounced; markedly nutty--chocolate and hazelnuts?--marzipan even??--; coffee and cream finish, with just enough hops dancing around to hold everything together.

4.05,-1.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,"It opens with a distinct wallop of malts on the nose. Slight hints of fruit are there, but the roasted malts soon overwhelm any other tastes. Bitter at first, it evened out over the course of the mug. Sample pours with a creamy head that didn't hang around as long as I would have liked. Taste was dominated by the malts, the roasted grains lending rich character to the beer. Mouthfeel was awesome. This beer has an incredible natural carbonation. Drinkability was good, but I'd have a hard time downing more than two or three of these at a sitting. It's a fine beer to appreciate, but the malts would begin to overwhelm me over time.","Dubblebock","Nov 03, 2003"

This beer is black with a hint of ruby light that can be seen when you hold this up to the light. Aroma is rich with dark carmel malt and a touch of chocolate. Taste is rich and smooth which begins with dark sweet malt that is covered in a dry chocolate which balances perfectly. The mouthfeel is perfect as it gives this brew a smooth creamyness during the initial taste and also adds a bit of flavor to linger on the tongue which makes you want to take another drink. Very high drinkability as this is a very flavorful session beer that goes down well with only an average level of alcohol.","RenoZymurgist","Oct 25, 2003"

I didn't know what to think, so I collected my senses and ""took in"" the situation slowly. I could smell something nice, kind of caramel-like, or like toffee. I suspected it was her perfume? I mean she looked rather pleasant despite the foaming, so why couldn't she have toffee perfume on her? I don't know why, but I felt I should lick her to test my theory...so I did! My mouth was instantly filled with a rich syrupy flavor of the same coffee (and maybe chocolate too?), that I'd smelled. It was simply wonderful! I felt I was transported to Heaven, but realized a moment later she had slapped me on the head and had started runing away. I ran after her, my tongue wagging like a hot dog...I wanted to drink all I could from her chocolaty chalice! But she was faster than me and got away. Now, whenever I wanted to be transPORTERed to a better place, I think of her and the pamphlets she left on my doorstep as she ran away leaving me longing for her. She was in a class by herself.","BeerBard","Oct 24, 2003"

I like this porter. Not the greatest I've had, but it's good. I think I prefer this from the bottle, and next time I get it I'll review the bottle, but this was still good.

Subtle smooth bittersweet chocolate as well. Super smooth taste is a combination of the same bittersweet chocolate and snappy hop bitterness to clean things up. Carmel and toffee sweetness also add to the flavor experience. Sweetness and bitter hop smack seem perfectly balanced to me. Just the right touch of roasted bitterness as well. Sharp bitterness and soothing chocolate finish, with hints of toffee as well. Tastes and smells erupted as the glass sat a bit. Medium to full bodied.Very good beer, and one worth trying.

Very complex, with herbal, lemon notes, cocoa powder, dark chocolate and olives, cherries, and some smoky/peatiness. On palate, that west-coast dryness matched with deep, wine-like flavors of chocolate covered cherries, cocoa, bitter chocolate, roasty espresso, fruit (plums, cherries). Mouthfeel is silky smooth.

The taste is a complex blend of roasted malts and residual malt sweetness, with the faintest touch of hop bitterness playing off of the malt flavors. A full mouthfeel was very welcome, although if it hadn't been served so gosh darn cold I would have appreciated it more. Personally, I would have preferred just a touch more hops, but that might make it out of character for a porter.

The mouth has a lot of body, not syrupy, but full. The taste evolves a bit from a still tinge of chocolate bitterness at first but as it warms it becomes sweeter.

A really rich, wonderful mouthfeel. I've not had a lot of interest in porters, but this opens a new door (to my refrigerator).","BitteBier","Feb 16, 2003"
4.65,13.4,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"pours out dark brown with ruby hues. tan head; lots of sticky lace left over. aroma of dark fruits, black malts, and molasses with some alcohol notes as well. malt flavors consisting of figs, ripe fruits, molasses, hints of chocolate, and roasted coffee flavors. gentle hop and spice flavors add to the complex and layered profile. extremely smooth and easy drinking. just plain delicious....bordering on decadent! one of the best porters i've ever tasted. this ranks right up there with those awesome baltic porters....and this may be the best american porter hands down. highly recommended and worthy of all praise.","budgood1","Feb 15, 2003"
2.96,-27.8,4,3,3,3,2.5,"Judged to be a classic by many, this beer really doesn't do much for me. Between the homebrew twang, the alcohol bite, metallic and fusel alcohol notes, it leaves me with a sick taste in my mouth. It would be exceptionally rare for me to drink more than one of these, as there are much better porters readily available.","Mitchster","Feb 13, 2003"

4.38,6.8,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This may be my favorite porter. I think I might like it a bit more than Fuller's London Porter. The nuttiness comes in as it warms, but I might trade a little of the sweet for a little more nut. I do like the balance, though. A great, yummy, comforting beer.","kbub6f","Feb 09, 2003"
4.2,2.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This was a very solid porter. Pour was pitch black with a nice head and a ring of tiny bubbles at the bottom of the glass. The aroma was a sweet almost candy like smell sort of like black licorice, with roasted malts. Taste is sweet at first like chocolate, followed by a smokey, earthy flavor. The mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth. This brew was very easy to drink, too bad I only have this one.","Bruiser81","Feb 09, 2003"
4.3,4.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This is a damn delicious porter. It's black, with a good inch of thick tan head. Aromas of dark chocolate, coffee and charcoal were easy to pick up, even in the bar. Mouthfeel is quite slick with little to no carbonation. Flavors of very dark roasted malts, lots of coffee and cocoa powder precede a slightly bitter finish. Very tasty and by far one of the better porters to be had out there.","IrishRedRock","Feb 08, 2003"
4.25,3.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"The Anchor Porter pours a dark almost see through tint, untill you hold it up to the light. She has hints of deep ruby when held to the light, and the head is light brown hue. With the first whiff of this one, I am getting a major nose of chocolate malty sweetness, enough to make my mouth water. There is also a nice hop aroma that comes through the sweetness to form a really good overall very enjoyable aroma. It is very sweet to the tip of the tongue, as it fist touches. What complements the dark and chocolate roasts is a fruity effervesence that dances along the old taste buds. Very unique and well done. Another master piece by a wonderful brewery, my hat is off to Fritz Maytag. This beer has a nice full body that helps carry all the flavors with each sip, and at the same time delivers a really drinkable porter.","WVbeergeek","Feb 02, 2003"
3.98,-2.9,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"This is a smooth porter with roasty and carmel tastes dominating, and then a dry bitter coffee finish.

Fruity, then earthy, then bitter and dry, coffee, sweet berry, and a hint of lime.","Delirium","Jan 27, 2003"
4.37,6.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"After years of enjoying this beer out of the bottle, I recently tried it on tap and was astounded at how good it was. It pours a nice dark brown with just a hint of ruby. It has a good-looking tan head that sticks to to the sides of the glass. The thing that was noticeable about the porter on tap is that the hops really kick things into gear. It has a wonderful creamy mouthfeel and goes down like silk.","mickeymac","Jan 26, 2003"
4.52,10.2,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Aftertaste doesn't hang around long, or perhaps because it is such a tight blend of flavors there is nothing distinct to make a lasting impression.","Brewzzle","Jan 26, 2003"
4.22,2.9,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"This beer poured black with a very slight twinkle or dark red when the light is right. A thick tan head that slowly subsided, sat on top. Initial taste revealed a slight bitter taste that road the palette from front to back. As the glass emptied, a slight lacy foam followed the liquid down. While drinking, a hint of liquorish could be smelled along with a hint of dark roasted coffee. The taste slightly lingered leaving behind a dark caramel aftertaste. The body was silky and somewhat smooth. Definitely a good drink that I will buy again.","Kunsan90","Jan 22, 2003"

Still, another solid beer from Anchor.","CharlesRiver","Dec 03, 2002"
4.07,-0.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Pours a nearly opaque black with a thick, cakelike omnipresent tan head. Very complex aroma with port and brandy-like characteristics, as well as some soft chocolate, vague coffee, vanilla and milky scents. Mild carbonation; slick, creamy mouthfeel. Flavors of raisin, coffee, and dark chocolate, with ripe grape and other sweet dark fruit. Very rich, ideal for sipping on a cold winter's night. A definite winner.","doerickson","Nov 29, 2002"
3.69,-10,4.5,3,4,4,3.5,"Pours a black with garnet traces when held up to the light and has a modest tan head. Light aromas of sweet fruit and a hint of chocolate...but it is very faint! The taste reveals a nice blend of hops on the nose and tapers off into a light chocolate and malt. Other than the hops, there is nothing here that really sticks out as it is a rather mild blend, but quite enjoyable. The mouthfeel is that of a medium bodied brew and finishes slighty sticky. Pretty decent brew! Cheers!","BeerAngel","Nov 28, 2002"
4.67,13.9,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Black in color with a thin, moderately creamy, dark tan head. On opening the bottle, the first whiff has a rubbing-alcohol like quality to it, odd for such a moderate beer. Alcohol soon fades into the background, and is replaced by a grainy, chocolate-malt scent, with slight coffee notes whichs sweeten into something more toffee-like as the beer warms. In the mouth, this beer has a malty body with subtle notes of fig and a citric acidity from the hops. Dry finish with a very niec burnt grainy aftertaste. Quite a nice porter -- matures well in the glass.","mzwolinski","Nov 27, 2002"
3.48,-15.1,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"While this is not a particularly wonderful beer. It isn't undrinkable. However, I feel that there are better porters out there that cost less per 12 oz. bottle.","Zraly","Nov 26, 2002"

4.2,2.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours to a deep brown color, with a creamy light brown head that lasts.  With every sip it leaves a nice lace-work down the side of the glass.  It has a wonderful roasted malt aroma, with a bit of burnt coffee.  The flavor is rich, with a strong roasted malt flavor, coffee and chocolate notes.  The mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied, rich, and slightly sweet and bitter in the finish.  Overall, I think this is a wonderful Robust Porter with many complex aromas and flavors.","BeerBuilder","Nov 07, 2002"
4.03,-1.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This porter has a good, thick mouthfeel with nice toasted malt and carmel notes right up front. Semi-sweet hints of toffee are mixed in their also.

3.85,-6.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"As I write this, again I realise I drank it too cold. The flavor really improved as it warmed. A very dark black beer that pours thick with a nice light tan head, but which soon evaporates to almost nothing but a brown ring around the top of the beer in the glass. No lace at all. Intense nose of burnt well-roasted barley malt and caramel in the mouth, with an aftertaste that reminded me so much of a vintage alcohol enriched fruit-Dundee cake. Lovely. Has a really dry finish - akin to many other good Porters I have had. But the roast flavours are still there lingering around for a good while after as though they are waiting for a tip! Drank better as it warmed up - I am always guilty of drinking dark beers straight the fridge (which is strange for me being a Limey), I must refrain from this practise. Don't normally drink Porters, but this is a good one that I really enjoyed.","TheLongBeachBum","Sep 25, 2002"
3.31,-19.3,4,3,3.5,3.5,3,"This porter poured a deep brown, almost black color. The tan head didn't stick around too long, but some lace resided in the glass. This beer exuded a huge licorice aroma that was, to me, kind of annoying. The coffee and roasted malt flavors were present. The mouthfeel was fairly syrupy, also. Anchor doesn't produce a bad porter here, but I don't think I'll be trying it again any time soon.","Jon","Sep 15, 2002"

Rich aroma of caramel, coffee,  alcohol and a vey slight smokiness.  Strong roasted malts flavors dominated the taste, begins with malt sweetness, toasted malt flavors, finishes with earthy notes and a mild sweetness.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy.  A very substantial porter.","Pegasus","Jul 14, 2002"
4.24,3.4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Virtually opaque, but a tinge of deep garnet around the edges is discernible.  The initially thick, beige head settles into a moderate, but very dense & lace leaving layer.  A combination of sharp, black patent & mellow chocolate malt hits the nose at first.  Light fruitiness, toffee & dark caramelized sugar ensue, & become more pronounced as the beer warms.  Deeply roasted black patent & chocolate malt dominate the flavor at first, but quickly give way to dark crystal malt sweetness & well formulated hop bitterness.  The body is relatively full for a porter and almost rich, while the mouthfeel is dextrinous, but not cloying at all.  Finishes bittersweet due to the combination of roasted grain bitterness & unfermented sugars and dextrins.  Anchor Porter straddles the boundary betweenn a robust porter and stout...  I've forgotten how good this is.  I was lucky to get a well - handled 2 month old six - pack, however.  Anchor does not travel well.","marc77","Jul 01, 2002"

Upon tasting, I find no acetic (vinegar) taste present.  That's a good sign.  I do find some pleasurable tastes.  Sweet chocolate, molasses and hints of bittersweet chocolate and java.  It seems like the sweet notes override the bitter notes in this porter.  Or maybe they just don't blend correctly.  But I've had many a better porter than this.  It is not bad by any means,  but I prefer more hop notes and roasted quality and bitter tones.","Bighuge","May 14, 2002"
4.08,-0.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"This is a big ol' beer, rich, full and rewarding. Sweet dark malt aroma, pleasing dark tan head. Roasty, smoky flavor with trademark American-stout-style hop oiliness. I got hints of grasses, greens, and herbs. This might sound odd but I thought it excellently complemented the aftertaste of the dark green vegetables I had earlier in the evening - beans & peppers. Would like to try it while nibbling on crisp fresh pea pods. Nourishing and authoritative, with a wonderful burnt finish.","Thrasher","Apr 28, 2002"

Nothing fleeting, sweet and increasingly roasty malt presence front to back. Hops were very understated to me, just barely present.
