"Sometimes you don't want to mess around with flavored porters. Sometimes you want a smooth and somewhat robust Porter that's traditional and satisfying. Look no further because this is the Porter for you. As the description says, it's definitely not a stout and is a straight shooting Porter that will satisfy any beer snobs palette. Smooth mouthfeel, dark and robust flavor, I want one now that I'm writing this review. Go out and get yourself one."
"O-Despite living in Colorado for nearly all of the my legal-drinking-age-life, I don't think I have ever tried Cutthroat until now and I'm sorry that I haven't. It is a nice drinking porter that provides a solid, if somewhat simple, flavor and nice drinkability."

"I am glad bottles finally made it to Texas.  I can never have enough good porters in the fridge.  I will certainly have to make room for this one.  Highly recommended."

"Classic example of the style. Even better when you can get the nitro draft!"

"From the bottle, a rich dark brown color with a light tan head (about 1/4 inch) dissolving to a lacy foam in about a minute. Light malty slightly sweet aroma with a hint of something maybe earthy or charcoal. Toasty malt flavor with notes of coffee and molasses. Very lightly hopped. Pretty mild overall with only a slight bitterness. Very drinkable, not sure about the 99 from Bros."
""

"Not bitter at all. Very complex for a porter."
""
""
"O: yuuuup"
"Quite a nice and definitely an enjoyable beer, one that went down quite easily despite not being just as good as I had been hoping going in. The taste was a little basic perhaps with the roasted malts and cocoa seemingly dominating without overpowering. A solid effort but I'm not confident it's a beer that I'm likely to pick up again."

"Good Porter. Not outstanding."
""
""
"For me? A sucky porter."
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a ruby highlighted, brown to black coloring, with a foamy, fluffy, clingy, tan head. Nose of bitter coffee forward, with a cream and cocoa highlight, and hints of roasted notes. Flavors of bitter roast coffee, chocolate highlights, roasted notes, and hints of char. Dry, smooth bodied, with a roasted and bittersweet aftertaste. Dry, smooth finish. Extremely easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Cocoa, toasted, nutty malt, and a touch of roast form the aroma. Nutty malt dominates. Flavor reveals a base of lightly roasted malt and coffee, with toasted nuts hitting mid palate, and a lightly bitter finish. Dark cocoa hints weave throughout, but aren't as evident as I'd hoped. There's a light acrid bite."

"I enjoyed it rich and def smoky"
"This is probably my favorite porter.  Rich, smoky, roasty and very drinkable thanks to the low alcohol content.  Goes great with beef dishes and is one of my go-to beers in the winter.  Definitely give this beer a try, you will become a fan very quickly."
""
""
"A dry, dark chocolate beer with smokey notes and a medium-light body and smooth texture."

"Aroma is roasted chocolate and coffee malts. A little bit of alcohol. Surprisingly sweet. Hint of bready malts. Appearance is a dark brown with a big light brown head. Literally one of the most impressive head retentions I’ve ever seen. Lots of lacing. Taste is the same as the aroma. Creamy, roasted coffee and chocolate. A little bit of smokiness as well. Despite the creaminess, it remains a little thin for my taste. Overall, a solid porter. Nothing out of the ordinary."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown.  smallish had but great aroma. Nice roasty notes with some coffee.  Taste has great roastiness and smooth dark chocolate hints.  Smooth, drinkable.   Mouthful is slightly creamy yet crisp.  Some hop bite at the back end.  Well done porter Odell!"
"Overall this is a good beer to drink and relax with. With a low ABV of 5% it's a good drink to eat with and talk with friends."
"Great body on the nitro, smooth as a baby's head."

"When pouring the beer I could smell the chocolate and coffee flavors and got excited. I have had stouts that I absolutely hated, so I've stayed away from stouts and porters. However this and Sam Adams Cream Stout is making me reconsider. When tasting it, I got the same chocolate and coffee tastes that I got in the smell. It drinks fantastically smooth and made me want another, so I drank another."

"Recommendation - Easy to drink a six pack and well worth it."
"Had on nitro, very delicious.  Lots of roasty malt."
""
""
""
""
""
"Good for after a days work and even at a BBQ with a steak."
""
""
""
""
"Smooth American Porter with a bit of bitter in the aftertaste. Pours smooth with a small white head that remains on the rim of the pour. Aroma of chocolate malt and nuts. Lighter than expected from the deep brown color. A nice finishing beer for the day."
""
"A decent porter from Odell, I prefer mine a little more sweet, the bitter finish lingers a little long for my liking. Gets better as it warms, probably won't buy again but wouldn't turn a free one down..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the better porters I've had - the taste is a bold as many stouts and it is only the lower ABV that points to a porter - worth seeking out if you can find it in your area or can find someone to trade it with you."
""
"A fine, flavorful porter that has some nice, deep and complex flavors. A little lighter in feel than some porters, but the taste and appearance really hits the mark. Smooth and alluring."

"Home tasting, 12oz bottle into Tulip Glass. 12/23/13."

"Overall: I was recommended Deshutes Black Butte over this beer, and I have to say I defiantly prefer this beer. I haven't found a ton of great porter in the mountain west."
""
""
""
"A superbly balanced Porter and that does not mean it is hopless, even with just 17 IBUs. Perfect execution that is hard to beat."

"O: A porter for the stout lover. This beer is perfect for those times that a stout might be a bit much, but you still want that roasty stout flavor. I love grabbing this one when I want a beer with dinner."
""
"Poured from bottle very dark brown with a slightly tan 1 finger head. Can pick up hints of good roast coffee smell. Head dissipates relatively quickly to a thin ring that has pretty good lacing in the glass. Medium carbonation. Has a medium-heavy mouthfeel, that sticks with you for a while like a good stout should. I get a slight bitter chocolate on the front with a nice semi-dry roasted coffee on the back. Very nice example of an American porter that most stout lovers will enjoy."
"Odell Cutthroat Porter pours a pitch black color with a long lasting and lacing head. There is a nice roasted aroma, lots of coffee aromas as well. The taste is very robust, strong and creamy roasted malts, with good hints of coffee and chocolate. Full body, full flavors. Overall a world class porter, fantastic flavors, one of the best out there."
""
""
"I would certainly have this again given the chance. The depth of the roast malt usage is quite nice but it is not super decadent like a lot of Stouts and dark beers nowadays. Drinks and refreshes while maintaining a dark roast flavor."
""
""
""
"The beer is near black with a dense khaki head. Plenty of lacing coats the walls of the pint glass. The aroma brings chocolate, roast, hints of vanilla and perhaps a touch of coffee. Really smooth and easy drinking. Light chocolate and roast. It would be easy to go through a few of these in a session. A solid example of the style. Tasty."

"Crispness gives just enough without going overboard for the style, while moderate carbonation is consistent. It gets quite a nice smoothness to it overall."
"12 oz bottle pours opaque black with good tannish head and lacing. Good meaty and smokey porter aroma. Taste is dark roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and a hint of bacon. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with a drying finish. I have a fondness for porters and this one is very well done."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied. It coats slightly and finishes slightly dry."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a pretty awesome beer lots of taste however the smooth feel and drink-ability made me want another after I drank the first one so fast."
""
""
""
"a good sessionable dark beer that clearly knows which way the tide flows"
""
"If you like porters as a general style, then you have got to try this. This is one of the better examples of this style I have had in a long time. I will say that it's hot outside, and a porter might not be your first beer of choice. However, this is a great offering from a seemingly legendary brewing company. Well done, Odell. Cheers!"

"12 fluid oz. dated 9/12/11 ap: subsiding head, dark reddish brown. sm: vinous, chocolaty. ta: confirms smell. Deeply fruity. mo: thin-medium,, thin-oily texture carbonation average. ov: very pleasant, fruity porter. Different to many british porters which emphasise roasted malts."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"A really excellent porter. Not my favorite, but definitely up there with the greats as a super tasty, light, balanced, and perfect example of the style."
""
""
"O: a pretty good porter, particularly if you like porters that are loaded with dark malts and use hops just for bittering."
"Overall: This is on my top two for porters. Such a robust and well crafted brew."

"O: A superb AMerican porter which serves both your sweet tooth and appetite for roast. A great classic American porter."

"This poured out as a nice deep brown color with a light tan head on top. The lacing is great just like many other Odell brews, there is also a solid retention as well. The smell of the beer has an earthy roasted aroma with some chocolate aroma and grass in there. The taste of the beer is chocolaty with a earthy bitterness and yeasty finish. The mouthfeel of the beer was medium bodied and smooth, nicely carbonated as well. Overall this beer is very nice, great sessionable porter, well worth looking into."

""

"This beer looked great and smelled nice but the taste was pretty average. Easy to drink though."
""
""
""
""

"O: Surprised by this one, I'm not sure I've tried it before and I've seemed to always pass it over since Odells arrived in the area last year. Good stuff for the porter lovers."

""
""
""
""
""
"o - overall this is a big porter. extremely full robust flavor profile. i like my porters to be a bit more subdued."
""
""
"Pours dark, black in the center and brown towards the edges. A nice off white head and good lacing. Aroma is rich and roasty; dark chocolate, light roast coffee, a little bready. Flavor is pretty similar with a dominating roast throughout that is continually evolving; starts of with the dark chocolates with some coffee hiding out underneath, but things progress the flavor tend to trade spots and a nice light roasted coffee grinds takes the forefront with the dark chocolate hiding out underneath. A touch bready I suppose, a touch of brown sugar too. The roast can provide a touch of mild bitterness to it as well. A medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel. Overall, a fantastic porter here. With my newfound appreciation for english porters this one is sitting right towards the top of my favorite porter list."
""
""
""
""
"If I could get this more often I would buy it all the time, but sadly Odell is not in Texas yet. Hopefully that will change."
""
""
""
"Dang this is a stereotypical very good porter that was a hair's breadth from being great. Served a little cold with a smallish tan head that slowly settled and lots of lace. Color is a very hazy dark garnet brown. Aroma is classic cocoa, malt, roast, coffee. Flavor is likewise standard high end porter, like nose, hint sweet, good carbonic tang, some astringency and spot on bitter. Body is almost faultless - there's a suggestion of bandaid that just barely throws it off kilter. Carbonation is perfect. Finish is like flavor, of average length, and super drinkable. Wish we could get it in Wisconie."
""
""
"Overall: A very good take on the American style Porter. Nicely roasty and robust while still going down pretty smooth and easy."
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: The Odell Brewing line-up of offerings are always on my shopping list. This is my first time trying their Cutthroat Porter and I will definitely be going for it again in the future. A very well-rounded beer and great example of the style. There is so much flavor packed into this brew."
""
"D/O: Surprisingly flavorful for a 5% abv porter, this dark contribution from Odell is mostly masterful. As good as the flavor is, it takes a few unexpected turns with detectable acidity and possible off-qualities of fermentation. Not a perfect example of the style, but there are some serious flashes of brilliance demonstrated here."
"D - Very drinkable. Nice balanced american porter. Good mix of flavors and just the right amount of body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A nice, easy to get, example of a porter. Somebody said something about a Cutthroat / Black Butte tasting in one sitting. Personally I like the Black Butte a tad better, but this is a VERY CLOSE second."
""
""
""
"Classic American Porter here. Dark brown with a tight-bubbled head of tan foam. Smoooth. Milk chocolate, coffee, brown sugar, and caramel. A nice dose of floral hop flavor plays off the malt beautifully. Rich, but easy to drink in gulps thanks to the dry finish. Just a touch of tannins keeps it quenching. Right there with Edmund Fitzgerald as the quintessential American Porter. Enjoyed on tap at the incredible Odell tasting room."
"Overall, this is definately one of my new favorite porters. it is well balanced and the folks at O'Dell's did an excellent job brewing this masterpiece."
""
""
"Overall this beer is delicious. Extremely sessionable especially for its style. This beer is always a solid standby, especially the nitro draft version."
""
""
""
"O: Good-looking beer. Damn good Porter."
""
"Dark brown body with little light getting through with aa single finger tan head. Aroma. Flavor is excellent and may be the best porter I have had and includes roasted malts, smokey notes, burnt toast with a smooth chocolate malt flavor. Light to moderate carbonation and on the heavier side of medium body. Odell is becoming my favorite brewery. So many of their beers are top of the line and full flavored."
""
""
""
"Overall - A decent try, but there are others in the style that pack the same flavor profile and have a way of making it linger. Value-wise, at the 9.99/6pk here in AZ I'll be moving on from this one..."
""
""
"O - like it. Couldn't have but one or two but was enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Having this and Deschutes Black Butte back to back and I have to say although its close the O'dell is my favorite. Smoother finish but more bitter than Deschutes. I wonder if anyone else is comparing these two the same way. Take the Cutthroat, Black Butte challenge!?!"
""
""
""
"Overall a very nice porter, and well worth picking up."
"O: Solid porter. Not overly complex, but well done and easy drinking."
""
"Excellent - a superb porter. The balance and body are fantastic; the roasted malt flavour and bitterness seem perfectly tuned. Lovely beer - grab one if you come across it."
"O: A solid, somewhat non-robust porter that is remarkably drinkable. The reasonable abv helps."
""
""
""
"Odell is really taking this whole beer thing to town..."
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with a lower level of carbonation makes this easy on the palate, but feels a little stagnant. Resultant mouthfeel is smooth, though a bit turgid. Dry close."
""
"Overall a slightly passive tasting Porter, with that being said it is still quite delightful to drink."
""
""
"Nitro, gotta love it."
""
"The mouthfeel is on the thicker side for a non imperial version of the style with carbonation being on the lower side. Overall I thought it was a pretty solid beer of the style. Very flavorful and easy drinking beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a pretty darn good beer. Check it out if you haven't ever tried it before and want a super solid porter at a reasonable price."

"Overall: I really enjoyed this. One of the most flavorful porters I have had in a while. The flavor was spot on and with a great amount of it. It wasn't imperial but very full bodied. The beer reminded me a lot of a milk stout with its creaminess, chocolate notes and lack of bitter finish. I would love to have some more of this."
"Real dark with real tight carbonation. Two-finger tan head. Sharp looking beer. Lots of roast in the aroma, with some coffee. Tastes like its smells - lots of roast with some sweetness underneath that resembles a stout. Real enjoyable beer, and perfect if you can't decide between having a porter or stout. Seems like a hybrid of each."

"An excellent, very drinkable porter. Personally I'd prefer it a bit thicker but overall this is very good and I wish I had access to Odell in FL. Thanks to ShawnBGP for including it as an extra!"

"What can I say? It's rich, flavorful and easy to drink. I could see myself drinking this with breakfast and not feeling ashamed."

"Odell Cutthroat Porter: It’s hard to review a style of beer that you do not drink regularly, as there is no benchmark to compare to. I really enjoyed this Porter, so other brands will be tested. The Cutthroat Porter is black in color with a tan lumpy head that fades but laces the glass well. The aroma is banquet of stuff: roasted malt, toffee, vanilla, coffee, cigarette butts all coming and going. How do they pack so much into one beer? The flavor is very similar, lots of roasted malt, yeast, spices, coffee, and chocolate, all evenly distributed. I was having pizza with the Cutthroat, which did not go well together, and when I hit a hot red pepper, my beer review had to end. I could taste nothing else but fire. Anyway, I had enough time with the Odell Porter to learn that Porters are a wild ride, greatly enjoyable, and the Cutthroat will be tested again and again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Flavorful and smoky. The latter adds a unique take on the porter. I enjoyed it and will have another."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - for a year round, readily available offering, this one's hard to beat. A solid, complex, well built, easily drinkable porter. If you have the opportunity, give this one a shot on draught."
"American clone of British classic style...Drink it fresh!"
"O - A light crisp beer. Something I would not really purchase again but an average porter."
"D - a bit dry for a porter in my opinion, but not bad. The earthy coffee and light smoke works well with the chocolate and dry caramel."

"Overall, I love this beer. So drinkable and so enjoyable. Best served on a cold evening with good friends."
"this is a fantastic porter, shouldnt be surprised from odell... pours a THICK dark brown with a small mocha head. smells like a coffee milkshake with a strong roasted backbone and a slight alcohol tinge, dark chocolate, and a bit of sweet. tastes like much more than a standard porter, huge profile complimenting the nose. full bodied and mellow as it warms. drinkable despite the full body, might become my go to this winter. yum yum yum"
"dark brown with a nearly black look to it and a nice two inch head of tan. The aroma was loaded with chocolate and rich roasted malts. Big sweet profile here. As I go in for th first taste I am over whelmed with cocoa and rich dark tones. Nice touches of molasses and rich sweet flavors that carry over into a huge sweet finish. Big body on this and a great easy drinking feel."
"Drink- A very tasty porter. This was warm, malty, and roasty. Very smooth and easy to drink. Up there with Deschutes and Great Lakes."
"O - A fantastic porter that gives you a perfect bitter-sweet balance. Easy drinking and delicious. A sessionable porter for sure."
"Overall impression: Nice drinkable porter - medium mouthfeel isn't too heavy, so I could definitely drink several."
"This is a solid porter...it seems as though it will be more roasty and harsh than it actually is in the taste. The creamy, coffee finish is quite nice."
"I made a mistake. Cutthroat is a good, drinkable porter. Just goes to show you not to judge a book by an off bottle."
"O: Gave it extra points because it's right up my alley. Flavors are fairly mild but are well balanced and combine to make a great porter. This is more of a ""real"" porter in my opinion, unlike some other porters which are thinly veiled stouts."
"12 ounce bottle, best by 6/10/11. Pours crystal clear dark brown color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense tan head with very nice retention, that reduces to a fairly thick lacing cap. A nice amount of lacing clings to the side of the glass as well. Aromas of toasted malt, caramel, chocolate, nuttiness, molasses, and a bit of spice. Very nice aromas here with excellent strength as well. Taste of big toasted malt, chocolate, caramel, molasses, spices, and nuttiness. A fair amount of bitterness on the finish, with a bit of lingering notes of chocolate, toasted malt, caramel, and spices. Very nice balance of flavors as well. Medium carbonation and body, with a nice creamy and smooth mouthfeel. No alcohol noticed on the taste or finish as expected for 4.8%. Overall, definitely an excellent and well made porter that I wish I could get on a regular basis."
"Overall: A good version of a porter. Not exactly what I was expecting, quite watery (not weak at all). Not too creamy, fairly smooth. Very drinkable as the drink progresses. High carbonation. I would drink again."
"Light to medium bodied with decent carbonation, this is one very drinkable porter. The body is a little watery and has a very sessionable quality but still has a slight stickiness. The carbonation is not overly apparent which is very important in this beer, as more carbonation would really harm the flavors."
"I've been realizing there are a lot of Porters very similar to each other and this is just another one. Great beer none the less."
"O: From the bottle, give the glass a bit of a swirl to get rid of excess carbonation. All in all, a nice refreshing porter. Nothing special but nothing wrong with it."
"O - Great brew, but even better on Nitro.... Awesome brew Doug."
"O: Very well executed in every regard. Tempted to give it an A+ even."
"I really enjoyed this beer and will drink it again when I can. I was able to get a few on a trip to Colorado, since we cannot get these in Indiana."
"Overall a great drinkable porter, nice dark malts, coffee, chocolate, vanilla, caramel, as well as creamy flavors, dark and robust, malty, yet very drinkable. I personally would have liked a touch more on the hops, but otherwise great."
"Thank you chugalug06 for the bottle in a trade....there better be more of these in the future!!!"
"This was a pretty solid, but unspectacular, Porter from Odell, with a decent depth of flavor to it and an overall sturdy drinkability. This one would do right by you if you were in a dark beer pinch."
"We sampled this one at the Odell Taproom with some friends, a few Saturdays ago. Not much to distinguis this one from the regular tap version. Poured a nice dark brown/black color, with a creamy beige head. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt and light coffee. On the palate, medium bodied and hollow tasting, with flavor s of dark chocolate, roasted malt and cocoa."
"O: Odell knows how to make beers! Really really solid brew. I think the Deschutes Black Butte is better though."
"I expected more out of this beer given how good their IPA was. To me it seemed to be good, but not great. Certainly something I wouldn't come back to here in Socorro with Black Butte so readily available."
"Overall I'd have to say that this is one of the best American Porter's out there today. It's got just about every flavor I love in a porter, yet it's not too sweet and is incredibly well balanced. I love this beer and wish with all my heart it was distributed here."
"Overall: A good solid porter."
"Taste is great but a strong beer."
"Overall: A very pleasing beer. Odell writes that the Cutthroat Porter was inspired by the classic London porters; which is a very good thing in my opinion. Cheers!"
"Overall a strong traditional example of the style, decent price, solid brewery behind it, ya its a recommender"
"o-I enjoy this beer on nitro, actually prefer it on nitro. Good stuff."
"When poured, the dark ruby tinted brown beer settles very dark. A fingers worth of off white head sits briefly, leaving bubbly lacing. The nose is a bit hoppy with some roasted malts and a bit of espresso. The taste is following suite. A subtle mocha/espresso taste is noticed surrounded by a bit of hop presence and roasty malts. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and has a bit too much carbonation for me. However, it is pretty smooth and drinkable. Overall, pretty go porter that is drinkable and well-played on pretty much every angle."
"Good example of the style. A little more roast than most other beers labeled a porter. Has some wonderful subtle qualities that keep me coming back to the glass."
"Current batch says 4.8% abv on the label. From a recent 5280 Magazine marketing idea of six different beers they claim are ""Colorado's Best"" in a six-pack, including a can of Dales Pale Ale along with the five bottles."
"Overall- Good beer. I use to really like smoke in beers and have gotten out of that as of late. Still a good beer but I may stick with their IPA and Myrcenary. 3.5/5"
"O- overall I think this beer is just above average for the style. I would prefer it to have a bit more bite on it."
"O: % alcohol this one is almost sessionable at 4.8%. The flavors don't disappoint. Another solid craft brew from Odells."
"Overall I really enjoyed this one. Could see this being a session beer, when quantity didn't mater."
"Taste keeps up with the smell. Even amounts of spice, bitterness, chocolate, and coffee. Nice roasted quality. Hard to tell this is a porter and not a stout."
"Overall-average, a nice beer"
"3.5/4.5/4/4/4"
"O - I could have a couple, but not my first pick."
"Finish: Roosted malts and the little coco sticks around for a bit"
"D/O- Flavorful and relatively low in ABV, Cutthroat screams ""drinkability"". No arguments from this kid. My first brew from Odell. Thanks kawilliams81!"
"Overall - Very good drinkable beer, but lacks a little in complexity and balance."
"Thanks to my buddy who brought it in from Colorado. Poured from 12oz bottle (no date stamp) into pint glass. Pours a deep dark brown, not quite black with a thin pale khaki head that fizzles away quickly and leaves drippy lacing. Aroma is subtle with a little wafting roast nuttiness and some sweet notes. Flavor packs three strong components: roast malts (more like burnt bread than coffee), powerful sweet flavors, all offset by some strong hoppy bitterness. This porter has normal porter body, but an odd twist...almost like a lactose smoothness that could explain the sweetness as well. Overall a good above average porter!"
"A solid beer all the way around which I will be drinking again. I think I'm more of a fan of my previous nitro-tap review/experience with this beer... it gave it such a big creamy mouth feel and head, while really adding to the already notable smoothness."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"The mouth is firm, good heft. Smooths out in the end with a creamy finish. Dry cocoa powder, sweet gingersnaps, and mild lactose-like sweetness rounding it out. I dig this. Wish I had it locally. It's a different approach to the Porter, more of a sweet hybrid, but I liked it a lot."
"Drinkability: Because the body and taste aren't too heavy, I could have a few of these."
"Overall, this is a rich and thick porter, with lots of roasted malts. Good flavor profile, tasty and satisfying. Well done."
"D -- Solid offering, definitely worth the pickup."
"Drinkability: Man! i could drink a 6 pack by myself in one sitting! This is a fantastic porter! I really enjoy this porter. It is almost a toss up between Black Butte Porter and this beer for my favorite porter!"
"drinkable - very."
"Great porter. Strong coffee scent and taste complimented by a light aroma of chocolate. Decent head and lacing, complex and robust flavor starts with bold coffee tones and ends on a pleasant bitter note. Very smooth; it almost feels light. The color is very dark and rich. Great after a cold day trout fishing."
"D: A porter that doesn't make a fuss about identity but is simple and tasty, very drinkable and just feels right. A winner in my book."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Lots of carbonation, almost too much. Drinkability is pretty good. Too bad this isn't available in OH. Good thing Edmund Fitzgerald is better and readily available."
"Cellared for 24 months and pours black with a two fingers of ecru head. The aroma is rich with notes of coffee and sweet malt. There is a little astringency on the nose as the fizzy head reduces. The body is thin with and the flavors are A-typical. Great coffee notes and bittersweet chocolate. The flavors are great and the aromas are great teasers; the body is just a little shy of great. This is a good sessionish beer at 4.8%, I just can't get over the thin character."
"Dr: At this price range and availabity (in CO at least), it's hard to do better."
"This is a very good porter, with all the elements that a porter should have. Nice to know I have a few bottles in reserve for later."
"Black bodied beer. Thick crop of light brown froth on top has good retention. Lace comes in blotchy pathes all over. Aroma is very chocolatey and roasty. Flavor is very smooth and enjoyable. Tootsie roll center with milk chocolate and light java notes dotting the landscape. A little roasted malt bitterness lingers. Lightly carbonated and medium bodied. This one is solid."
"Notes: This beer, for being lower in ABV, has a very full bodied mouthfeel. It almost reminds me in a way of what I would call an ""imperial dark mild."" Cutthroat is a very tasty brew, and quite sessionable. More, please!"
"D - very easy to drink."
"I carefully decanted it from the bottle into one of my favorite glasses to be able to take in the aforementioned color. It was beautiful - a deep dark brown with caramel highlights at the edges. My slow pour left only wisps for a head. Nose was deep and rich, very chocolaty, not so much coffee. Mouthfeel was medium and the roastiness was immediately notable on the tongue. Now, it really tasted like coffee! Man, this was a great pick-me-up on a slow afternoon. Finish was slightly bitter, not from hops, but from the roasted malts that were used. I love coffee and this was right up my alley, but it may not be for everyone."
"This is another amazing beer that my girlfriend picked out. It has an amazingly strong flavor but not overpoweringly bitter or malty. Smooth!!! I consider this a session beer for myself. Relatively low ABV and for people who like to drink craft brews and porters!! GREAT BEER ODELL BREWING COMPANY!!!"
"Drinkability: If you like your porters dry, this one's for you. A low abv%, easy drinking, silky smooth and light porter, this is one solid brew. This is a dark beer for a situation one wouldn't normally reach for a dark beer in. Seriously, I could put down a six pack of this in the heat of the summer (and not a Virginia summer ... we're talkin' a good ol' fashioned south Georgia summer) without even thinkin' twice about it. Very good drinkin' here."
"Very good drinkability. Tasty, not too heavy, and a good porter."
"Thanks, welosiped, for the opportunity"
"This beer pours a dark brown nearly black color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into sticky lacing. The aroma is of milk chocolate, roasted malt, vanilla, and a hint of coffee. This is a very attractive aroma. The taste is milder than the aroma. There are some nice roasted malt characters with some chocolate and coffee in the far background. The mouthfeel is slightly lighter than medium bodied with agressive carbonation that doesn't work well with the style. Overall, this is a good porter that I could drink again. I like the taste and aroma, but the texture and carbonation do detract from the overall pleasure."
"D- Very drinkable. Sipper. Rich."
"D- This is one enjoyable porter. One of the better ones."
"Pours a very dark brown with a short tan head and a bit of lacing. The nose brings some roasted malt along with chocolate and coffee. The flavor isn't quite as integrated as the nose, with the coffee and chocolate not mixing all that well with the roasted character. Overall, however, the feel is quite good and this ends up drinking quite well, and I love how Odell has quite low ABVs on many of its regular offerings."
"Clocking at 4.8 (according to label, not BA) ABV, this beer is something you can session. The complex flavor, and light alcohol, make an exceptionally drinkable brew. This is, in my opinion, the gold standard for American Porter. It will always hold a special place in my heart and liver."
"Drinkability: Absolutely drinkable, perfect session beer to enjoy with lower ABV and stout qualities."
"D= Very drinkable, with an ABV that makes it easy to drink a few. The slight oxidation note was not welcome, but this was still a great beer that I would gladly try again (I bet it is amazing fresh on tap)."
"Good start to the porter quest."
"The carbonation was but intense, the only thing I wasn't ecstatic about. Aside from that, the body was on the light side for a porter. As it goes down, it seems to gain weight. The finish was chalky and begged another sip. Awesome porter, thanks Odell."
"I have pointed out more mistakes than better qualities but this is one of the most flavorful beers around at its ABV."
"D= This is what really stands apart in this porter. Super easy to drink. It's got just enough flavor to keep you guessing and not enough to make you wanna switch to something lighter. A great brew."
"D: Very well balanced and easy to drink."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Medium bodied, super smooth and creamy. This beer really had a great mouthfeel and it felt good going down. It doesn't seem too heavy which contributes a lot to the drinkability. Great example of a porter and one I would absolutely try again."
"Maybe it was just my sample or palate, but I didn't think that this was a world-class American porter"
"Drink: Very easy to drink, especially at only 4.8ABV. Wish I could get it in California."
"D- This was a drinkable porter which I wish we carried in Indiana. There are more flavorful porters I've had but this one does it for me as a session porter."
"A great sessioner, perfect for the cold months."
"Medium bodied, smooth, creamy. and nicely carbonated. A really nice Porter which I could drink over and over."
"A nice porter, but for my personal tastes, I would like a bit more sweetness. Still a good beer that goes down well."
"Drinkability - I would say that this is quite drinkable all around. Not too strong, good complexity, and not too filling or lingering. Easy to come back to several times."
"Drinkability: Great example of an everyday, sessionable Porter that relies more on a smooth overall balance than going the overly roasted route. While not one of my absolute favorite Porters, this may be the most drinkable one I have ever had. Another winner from Odell."
"Overall, this beer is a ton of roasted malts. It has some decent flavors and I think it is fairly good. However, this is a porter you need to be in the right mood for. Relatively drinkable."
"Delightful, tasty, and easy to kick back. I'll take that."
"D: A wonderful porter beer. Low alcohol, tasty, what's not to like."
"Mmmm, porter delight! roast is there, sweet chocolate is there and smooth toast rounds out the malty trio. Mild bitterness is the perfect, dry ending to this well brewed nectar. Fruit is kept low and the beer has a crisp feel to it, I am glad they kept the ABV below 6% as it makes it extraordinarily drinkable. Body seems a little thin at times and gives off a slight astringency, but pretty minor complaints as this is a very nice porter. I would love to have this available locally, for sure."
"Poured a very dark brown to the point of being black with a creamy one fingered tan head with lots of sticky lacing the entire glass. Dark robust coffee, malt and coco aromas. Bitter sweet chocolate with smokey hints on the palette with a metallic bite finish. Lighter than most for a porter with decent carbonation. With winters snow just around the corner, would drink well after a day on the slopes."
"Bonus-Had a chance to try the Nitro-Cutthroat on tap at the brewery. If I could give a beer an A++ this would be the one. Unfortunately I did not take any notes."
"Drinkability - Very nice porter. Well deserving of the grade. To me, very sessionable porter. I could easily drink the whole pack in a night(maybe not for everyone though). Nice porter to kick back with, and enjoy the evening."
"Drank this in a pint-style glass from the bottle w/ 9/28/10 as the date on the side. Pours w/ a 1 finger mocha-head that remains for awhile. The color is what is expected of a porter, dark w/ a hint of reddish-black on the edges. The head quickly reappears after a small swirl, also. Lacing is noticeable as the head recedes. The smell, again, is what is expected of a porter. It has chocolate, coffee, and a hint of licorice. Nothing is overwhelming about this beer, though. It isn't too much of anything, and I like that. The taste is black, chocolate, and possibly coffee malt. Again, it is just right. This beer might become one of my staples, if I can find it nearby in SoCal. In fact, I think that I will have another w/ some rosemary and garlic potatoes."
"Nice session porter with a consistant flavor profile through and through."
"I've been impressed with every Odell beer that I've tried. This is a great beer - fans of the style should certainly check it out. Nicely balanced taste and off-the-charts drinkability."
"D: Very flavorful and balances. Smooth and easy to drink."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, but hits a better note than most stouts. Perfectly attenuated without the gimmicky use of nitrogen. Smooth and silky, making it seem like a much lighter beer. Very well played by Odell in my opinion."
"D: A bit rich at times for what it is but a pleasant, drinkable porter"
"Rich, thick texture, yet still incredibly drinkable. Hard to believe how quickly this beer disappears from my glass. Huge thanks to Wendall (wkcyr4) for sending this one my way."
"Interesting beer. I would like to try it again but maybe not after having a sweeter maltier beer."
"Mouthfeel clings. Good bitterness, great roast feel to the malt bill. Drinkable, a little pricey, but a great label."
"D- So good, so smooth, so malty. Excellent session beer at only 5%. It's so damn good, I had another one with a corned beef Reuben and onion rings. Cutthroat on nitro may be the absolute best beer to have with bar food."
"D - Not hard to drink. Just seems it could be more."
"Pours near black with very little light passing through. Enormous off-tan head retains well and is still creamy, almost like espresso crema. Nose has a lot of roasty malt and smoke aromas, perhaps like a smoked meat of sorts or a faint reminder of rauchbiers. Some chocolate too. On the palate there's a good roasty malt flavor with enough hops for some balance, fudge/chocolate, a medium to light body, and a smokey sweet finish."
"D - a damn fine porter. one of my favorites. got a bit better after it sat out for about 10-15 minutes and the carbonation settled down. nice and warming after a night of snow shoveling, could have another 2 or 3 of these (if i had them)."
"Overall: A great session porter, worth a try if you have any interest in this style at all."
"D: One of the better porters I have come across. Great chocolate, coffee, and malt flavors and at a low ABV, a great beer to drink a few of in a night."
"D- I wish I could get more of this, I'm not a huge porter fan, but I'm doing backflips for this beer. Very awesome!"
"Drinkability - 5.0/5.0 - excellent beer if you just want to have a beer and not get lit after it."
"D: A damn fine porter. Good flavors all around. A winter session beer, for sure, but would be nice all year. Odells continues to amaze me with the quality of their beers."
"Overall it pretty much lived up to its reputation. It could do a few things better, but all around a solid brew."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into an oversized snifter, the label reads 4.8% abv. This beer threw me for a loop at first as it's not your average porter. It's certainly an American porter, but instead of just throwing thick chocolate and coffee notes at you, it holds a lighter, more complex taste with smoke, maple syrup, cocoa powder, bitter espresso, and grilled meat standing out. I also detect sweet cherries, leather, and whole grain bread crust. The aroma also brings out dry leaves and molasses. This is one heck of a complex porter, and light enough to make a great session beer. Damn."
"Solid presence of both malt and hops. A classic American porter."
"Thanks for the extra!"
"Drinkability - What an awesome porter. This is the beer that gives you a roasted flavor with hints of chocolate and coffee. Not harsh, slightly sweet with a semi-dry finish - Extraordinary!"
"a tad grainy on the palate but otherwise well-bodied. average drinkability."
"Drinkability? This has always been a favourite Porter of mine and to have it on tap was and is a real treat. Very quaffable!"
"Conclusion: This is a really well crafted American Porter...straightforward and delicious...not tons of depth but it's a great example of the style and is super-drinkable and full of flavor. Paired this with some nice Mimolette and some buttery crackers...the fruitiness and richness of the cheese went perfectly with this beer."
"Overall this is a top porter for me. Pretty similar to Boulevard's Bully! Porter [my fav]."
"Overall - A supremely well balanced porter... definitely recommended..."
" Over time this has replaced 90 shilling as my favorite beer. It does not leave you full and can drink several and not get tired of this. If this was an RIS it would be too big I think. It is perfect the way it is. this was the beer that got me into the bigger stuff because of the body and weight of the beer. This still has it but it is toned down but it has all the ingredients that makes it stand out. Why I like Odell beers so much. Very simple and good beers."
"Thanks to russpowell for padding my Odell resume with a good one. :)"
"This is an excellent Porter from Odell (whose offerings I always enjoy very much) and an excellent beer in general. For what it's worth, I used two bottles in a big pot of chili over the weekend and it turned out great. I had a bottle with the chili and I'm enjoying one by itself now, and both times Cutthroat Porter was a standout."
"I'm bummed that Odell beers are not readily available in my area."
"This is a great example of a dry American porter."
"Overall, this is a wonderful example of the style, I only wish I had mor than a 6 pack to enjoy. Highly recommended and I will be seeking out more!"
"The beer had a medium body with good carbonation. The beer was extremely drinkable, smooth, and creamy. Overall a top notch beer and possibly one of the best porters that I have had to date."
"This is a long time coming. As a former resident of Fort Collins, I've been drinking Odell's brews for quite some time but this classic I've just been drinking and enjoying but have never reviewed. Here it is. This beer pours a Cuban Coffee brown with a rich dark toffee head that leaves a substantial amount of lacing for a Porter. The aroma can only be described as decadent. Dark chocolate, mildly astringent espresso, heavy cream, hot chocolate and whipped cream. In most beers, when I say that the flavor is exactly the same as the aroma, it's almost a negative thing. Like they show all their cards before the hand is played, but with Odell Cutthroat Porter it exactly the opposite. This beer is beautiful. Its like a DDR party in my mouth. Milk chocolate, espresso, sweet cream, a hint of baker's chocolate and heaven. The mouthfeel is just a wee bit light for me. I wish there would be just a bit more body to it but honestly this is really just nit picking the beer. Odell's brewery has made, in my opinion, the best American Porter and possibly one of the best Porters produced in the world."
"M + D: Smooth and somewhat creamy medium body, with a nice sparkling carbonation to go with it. The mild alcohol content makes it a great session choice, and I'd gladly accept it as one - I only wish it were available in these parts!"
"Overall, very happy to see this as on nitro-tap. Porters aren't my absolute favorite style, but this one was pretty flavorful and had a spectacular mouthfeel. About as sessionable as you can get."
"Drinkability= OH HELL YES. This would be a candidate for the ""you can only ever have one beer again, pick one"" scenario."
"D: A solid Porter, dark and delicious. Not my ""go to"" porter, but a big flavor for only 5%alc. One I will drink again for sure. (I have another 4 in the fridge!!)"
"D - You can have more then one with no problem. Great taste and great tasting."
"12 ouncer allowed to warm up for about 30 minutes, ""070209"" etched by a computer on the label. Best before dating? Pours dark dark brown, near black with some dark ruby highlight shining through the gloom. Dark tan head, creamy, frothy and then down to a tiny bubble film and leaving splattered strands and fine spots of lace after a bit more then a gentle swirl. The nose is the first highlight for me. Rich notes of dark chocolate are noted in prominence. Full flavor porter, more chocolate noted on the tongue, along with dark malts, and then a moderate drying hop presence late. Smooth on the tongue. Very enjoyable brew. Nice job here by Odell."
"The label on this one is also absolutely amazing, a really nice looking woodcut. I wish I could get a poster of that."
"Very drinkable - chocolatey but not overly so. This one ""disappears"" too quickly if not ""careful"". A delicious, well-crafted, well-balanced brew that I probably like more than the individual parts show. A great example of an American Porter. If it were available in my area, I would grab a six-pack for a ""sessionable"" brew with character and great taste!"
"The beer is deep black, with a thick hot-chocolate brown colored head. Thick, chunky lace, foam lasts right to the end. The aroma has lots of roasted malt, some cocoa, and coffee. The taste is great, just as expected. Roasted coffee, with chocolate malt - perfectly matched the coffee/chocolate/cream in my dessert.. Full body, but not too thick or heavy, clean dry finish. Smooth and filling mouthfeel, good carbonation. This is a good porter, but the setting, mood, and food pairing made it great."
"Nevertheless, one of the more enjoyable porters I've had."
"Have been drinking this for awhile, had the opportunity to try it on nitro at the brewery. Pours a deep brown, almost black color with about a finger of chocolate colored head. The nose is a bit smoky, with a slight oak smell along with burnt sugar and and a hint of dark chocolate. On the first sip, taste is quite similar to the nose, with the oak being the most prevalent flavor. Suitably bitter, a good taste for a typical American porter. Mouthfeel is full and bright, which makes this a surprisingly refreshing beer. I'd say the overall drinkability is pretty good, and this is one that I'll continue to buy."
"Large light brown head, well carbonated. Color is very dark brown, almost black. Aroma is chocolatey sweet and roasty. Flavor is coffee and chocolate throughout. Like a bitter vanilla latte (says A). Medium body. Aftertaste is sweet, chocolatey. Alcohol slightly noticeable towards finish as it warms."
"Note: Recently this beer has been featured on nitro in a lot of places. The nitro really masks a lot of the flavors, I highly recommend drinking this one from a bottle before trying it on nitro."
"Overall a good beer that I find myself buying over and over."
"Overall: Thanks to mentor for this beer. I really liked it. Lately I have been hard pressed to find a porter that was great. This one was."
"Thank you again Odell!"
"poured a black that no light can get through with a three finger tan head that rises and runs away scared. the smell is burnt malt, coffiee and hops. the taste is smooth and creamy, the flavors that jump out first are bitter choclate, expresso and wood smoke, the middle is chared malt and the after taste is smoke and a light piney hops kiss. this is a world class porter that i long to have access to all the time. thanks to coldmeat23 for sending me this in a bif"
"Very good."
"A very good beer that I will be seeking out again."
"D - This is probably the best 'American' porter that I've tried. Very drinkable, yet complex enough for the jaded porter enthusiast. Balance of malt and hops with clean finish make this a winner."
"D - this is a perfect session beer, especially since it is under 5% ABV. This is a very easy-drinking porter and is enjoyable throughout its consumption."
"Drinkability - This is my go-to beer. Fantastic, one of the reasons I love Odell's so much."
"Thanks to howl1309 for the opportunity to try this one. Poured a deep brown with ruby highlights around the edges. Off-white head with some sticky strands of lacing present during the session. Nose is cocoa and roasted coffee; not bold, but even. Taste follows nose with the addition of a smoky character. Flavor profile was somewhat flat. Mouthfeel is between light and medium. Fairly easy drinking and flavorful for a % abv."
"Great beer!"
"Note label says 4.8%"
"D: Good, not a bad porter at all."
"Received this in a trade with Redhaze. Thanks! Pours dark chestnut with an okay head and some sloppy lacing. The head fades to a thin ring after a bit and sticks there. Smells roasty and creamy with a slight burnt sugar aroma. The taste is amazingly full flavored for 4.8%, with boldly flavored roasted grain, vanilla, cream, and sweet malt. Smooth and creamy in the mouth, this a delicious porter."
"One of the best looking porters out there. A masculine tan head that slowly strings its way down the glass as the blackness ebbs. Roasted dark chocolate characterizes the aroma as well as the taste, which also includes espresso. Palate is completely balanced and full-bodied. One of the best session porters you will find. Not only does this ale taste great, but you might just feel like more of a man for drinking it."
"A mighty fine porter in my opinion, and a surprising blind purchase."
"Tastes potent and complex roast with soured character, likely from black patent. dry chocolate, not quite baking cocoa. Noticable earthy hop flavor with some grassiness. This intensity of these is nearly comparable and melded quite well. Beneath these is a sour from black patent that is tamed by a comparable cream character. This beer is quite nice. Md thick mouthfeel has some silky and some dextrinous qualities. Moderate carbonation is nice. Overall, I find the flavors in this beer work well together...well done."
"Pours black with a nice smallish creamy beige head. Smell is roasty, coffee, cream and a bit cardboard like. Taste is smooth and roasty with a dull chocolate flavor along with a slight cardboard and metallic component. Faint hops in the end that linger a bit. Slightly full bodied with soft, yet crisp carbonation. Nice porter overall."
"The beer is pretty much a deep brown colour and it has a nice big head, but a little bit of retention. A lot of carbonation. The nose is chocolaty and sweet. The beer has hints of chocolate and some sweetness, followed by a weird after taste that I'm not too fond of. The mouthfeel is a bit watery. Pretty drinkable though."
"D: Smooth, yet robust. Exceptionally easy drinking."
"Highly recommended...I wish it was available locally. This could be a go to beer."
"D: Not the best porter out there but i'll drink this again"
"D-One of my regulars i reach for this quite often when i want a porter, affordable per sixso i love keeping it around"
"drinkability is pretty good. nice balance, interesting malt profile. i like the lighter chocolate/nut/vanilla thing that's going on, but the cardboard sneaking around the edges takes away a little. i can see the potential though, so i'll be looking for another of these to re-evaluate."
"A real nice and drinkable porter. One of their better rews in my opinion. Rich dark brown color with a frothy tan head. Lots of roasted malts with some coffee and chocolate as well. Mild hops round it out nicely. The flavor is again very roasty with a nicely blended hop variety. Medium body with a dry finish. Crisp and refreshing. This is my idea of a perfect session brew. Goes well most anytime."
"Great session beer. May fill you up quickly but good to drink."
"M/D: Grainy feel but not heavy, sweet but not bitter at all. Very drinkable for the masses not the best though."
"Poured an opaque black with a nice half inch foamy tan head that quickly dissipated to a thin ring with nice lacing. The chocolate malts hit you first with a nice roasted scent. The dark chocolate comes first in the taste followed by some roasted malts and some nuttiness. There is a slight bitterness in the finish but still smooth. Mouthfeel is velvety and smooth. Not to thick or chunky which makes the drinkability very nice. It was a little thin and I would have liked a little more body for the style but still an amazing porter."
"D - Overall, this is a pretty enjoyable Porter. It would be very good if the flavor was punched up a bit. It could definitely be stronger on all characteristics. Very drinkable, though. I wouldn't pass up if offered, and would buy again."
"Poured a dark brown, pretty much opaque, with red-brown edges. Sticky yellow-brown foam, good head retention with plenty of lacing. Roasty aroma, lots of phenolics, nuts, cocoa, quite malty. Bittersweet chocolate and roast up front, malty mid with balanced bitterness. Finishes with lingering dark malts, toffee/caramel. Medium bodied with lowish, creamy carbonation. Just a bit of tannin dryness. Now this is a solid american porter. Great stuff!"
"D: Perfect Porter for a heavy meal. Nice session beer too. I will be revisiting this one."
"D: Very tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, excellent representation of style, this one is definitely up there among my favorite porters, it's one that I could drink quite a few of over the course of an evening."
"Prosit, und Zum Wohl, MK"
"Rich roasted flavors accentuated by chocolate and coffee. Hops mingle with the mouth but more or less stay in the background. Very smooth in the flavor and the mouthfeel. Excellent drinkability as it's a tasty brew and would be easy to session."
"Overall, another good porter. It could possibly be a little bolder, but I like its smoothness and easy drinkability. I wouldn't change a thing."
"This beer is good, but I just can't get past the feeling that it tastes like a diluted really good beer."
"Best before date of 4/15/08. Nice dark color with a solid, dense, creamy head that is quick to settle to a fine ring. Smells of dark roasted chocolate. Taste is similar to nose but transitions to lovely coffee flavors as it travels to the back of my mouth. Aftertaste doesn't linger too long but is silky and pleasant. An enjoyable porter and great session beer."
"D - A nice, easy drinking porter. I'd prefer the Deschutes Black Butte if both are available, but you can't really go wrong with an Odell choice."
"D - I'm very, very impressed with this one! I like all of the roasty hearty bran and whole grain flavors, and the gritty fullbodied and dry finish complements those flavors perfectly. Nice!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and easy drinking with a nice punch of carbonation. Not an extremely robust porter, but a tasty one all the same that goes down easy. Yet another solid brew from Odell. Too bad this isn't available around me, but if it is around you grab some when you're in the mood for a porter!"
"d: despite its appearance and smell, it sure goes down easy. Very smooth, average alcohol, very drinkable."
"Very impressed. Not usually a fan of porters -- this is the best one I've had. A great fall & wintertime beer."
"Into a pint glass, this is an awfully dark porter, black but for a dark ruby hue, a tan head exploding from the bottle, a fully two inches of bubbly, frothy fluff, leaving behind chunks behind on the glass. The aroma is pretty good, chocolate notes and roasted malts evident but nothing much else. Dark malts of roasty goodness in the taste, chocolate and coffee notes, lots of bitterness here, and dry, a bit astringent to a degree, fairly smooth and full bodied but could be more so for both. In sum, a pretty good porter and quite drinkable."
"Any friend who brings a good beer back from an out of town visit, suddenly becomes a good friend -- thanks Brad. After sampling many Porters on this particular night, this one takes a back seat compared to other American Porters we had. The malts take a chocolate-heavy malt character, with undertones of Columbian coffee, buttery pecans, and milk sugars. The hops certainly balance the sweetness, but do little to bring flavors and nearly no aromatics. The beer is lighter in body and color; reminescent of Engish-type Porters. The roastiness is very smooth, allowing the beer's body to become more apparent. The beer is thin, but malty; making it very easily drinkable. Nice beer, just on the lighter scale of most Porters; especially American varieties."
"I haven't wrote a review in ages, but rest assured I have not given up good brews. Cheers!"
"Fantastic, yet standard, porter form Odell brewing. Picked this sixer up in Fort Collins, Colorado and brought a couple bottles back to Minnesota as a stellar example of an American porter. Pours beautifully into a Odell Cutthroat Porter pint glass. Opaque black color with brown highlights and a cream colored, rocky, velvety head with good lacing. The smell is nutty, yeasty and full of coffee and chocolate. The taste is wonderful, with milk chocolate, dark chocolate, coffee, and nutty flavors with some dark fruits and a juicy hop bite. The mouthfeel is full and creamy, with velvety carbonation. What I particularly like is the absence of sourness present in so many more pedestrian porters. Fantastically drinkable, would be great cold on a summer day or cellar temperature any other time of year."
"A nice tan head pours and sticks around for a little while. Once the head disappears, a nice lace stays present. It is a nice dark brown color. The smell is of coffee and roasted malt. There is also a nice smell of chocolate present. This tastes like sweet coffee and dark chocolate mixed together. A nice combination that is not overpowering. The mouthfeel is a little bubbly for me, but not too bad. This is a very good beer."
"Drinkability- I'll pass on this one if I ever see it again."
"Poured from a 12oz. brown bottle with a freshness date of 7/9/07. Served in my shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a very dark brown/black color with about a finger of tan head that leaves minimal lacing on the inside of the glass. Smells of lightly roasted coffee and malts, as well as some bread and chocolate. Tastes of bitter roasted coffee and bittersweet cocoa. Sort of like a chocolate malt. Rather smooth and creamy in the mouth with a surprising touch of alcohol considering the label states 4.8% ABV. Finish is dry and slightly bitter with medium carbonation. A really good porter that packs a lot of flavor. Definitely worth a try. Wish I had more."
"Dark black with brown edges and a smell like coffee, very nice. The head was a like a creamy blanket lying on top of the beer. I was told that along with Easy Street Wheat, this is Odells only unfiltered beer. The taste was roasty and also a little smoky like grilled meat. Mouthfeel was very creamy due to the nitro and it was appreciated but I wonder what the beer was like naturally and why the need for nitro? I liked this beer mostly except for the smokiness. I am also not sure if I like nitro, what is the point, cant they just cask it? The cask IPA I had at Odells was so creamy I cant imagine a better mouthfeel."
"Got in trade with Bort11 - thanks! Poured from a 12oz bottle with a date on the label but don't know if bottling date or best by date (why have a date if you aren't gonna label it?) into a pint glass. It was pitch black even against a light. It had a two finger tan head that slowly settled into a thin film. Good lacing. The aroma was roasted and chocolate malts. The taste was excellent. It was well balanced and had a good bite without a too bitter finish. This is a style that has moved to my top 3-4 and this is a great example of that style. I've enjoyed all the Odell's I've had but this is tied with Easy Street as my favorite of theirs. Also had fresh at brewery during my last trip to Ft Collins and it was awesome! Not available here in Texas so will have to trade and ship more. Highly recommend (4.5, HR, ML, Y)"
"Mouthfeel was very carbonated and medium in body. A bit too much for my idea of a fine porter."
"D: Incredibly rich and thick for a porter. The mouthfeel of this beer makes it seem bigger than it actually is. Very tasty and satisfying indeed. A well carfted brew."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer, and in all actuality it is a good example of one end of the Porter spectrum. I reviewed the Bells Porter before this one which was a lot more drinkable due to the malt balance. The roast is a bit harsh for my palate on this one, but it isn't out of style. I would drink this beer again as it is pretty decent."
"Medium body, moderate carbonation. Maybe a little thin, could have a bit more body for my taste. Balance seems good. As the label states, it's more like an English/London style porter than the American style it's listed as. Drinkability is good, I could see having a few of these in a sitting."
"Bottle courtesy of Beerandblues2: Poured a pitch-black color porter with a nice medium foamy head with great retention. Aroma of chocolate malt with some nice roasted notes is really enjoyable. Taste is dominated by the chocolate malt with again some nice roasted malt to balance and light hops at the end. Body is quite full but could have been creamier IMO. I have to admit that this is very well done and would be nice as a session porter considering the low alcohol %."
"Pours a nice clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice one finger creamy tan head which hung around for awhile, some nice islands and sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is of sweet roasted malts, slight hops, mocha/toffee/caramel. The taste is very nice reminds me of a stout really, malty, nice touch of toffee/caramel. Light-Medium body. Very drinkable, I really like this one, highly recommended."
"Wow, I just checked out the alcohol on this; this beer drinks way bigger than it is, not because of the alcohol (which is quite hidden), but because of the concentrated malt flavors. I could have easily been convinced this was 8% alcohol. This is my kind of beer, full of flavor, yet ideal for a long session of drinking. This had the telltale signs of being a great beer simply by the fact that before I knew it my beer was gone."
"D - This may be one of Odell's best beers. Great flavor."
"This is a good effort from Odell."
"Darkish carmel brown, almost black in color with a one inch beige head. Smells of chocolate, coffee, and sweet malt. Sweet and rich in taste with notes of roasted grains. This beer goes down smooth. I prefer the nitro to the standard draft or bottle. I would put this one on my top tier of favorite beers. Other words that describe Cutthroat Porter on Nitro are creamy, frothy and yummy. A great beer that I got from the source at the tasting room of Odell's in FC."
"Mouthfeel contributes to the imbalance, and leads me to tire of this after a bottle or two. Solid porter, but not my favorite."
"D - Very nice porter with excellent drinkability. I wish i could get it here."
"2 bottles acquired in a trade with jhammerly"
"Overall a very drinkable, sessionable American Porter. Recommended."
"D - I will drink this beer again, and again, and again. This is an excellent beer and something I will be picking up each time I'm in a town that has it."
"Finally finished the ones they sent me. Not a porter fan, and they ALWAYS send a friggin porter. Anywayz, this one is a good quality porter. Pours dark translucent brown with a hint of mahogany, lightly carbonated. Head is creamy, thin, a little lacing. Nose is very toasty, coffee-like, alcohols are peaking through actually. Taste follows well, a lot of toasted maltiness, coffees, slight sweetness, but the alcohol is still there. Doh! Yeah, was pretty decent otherwise."
"Drinks very easy, I think I like this better in the bottle than draft, but will have to take some notes next time I have it on draft, classic american porter IMO"
"Amazing porter. I love the sweet and bitter mix they achieve."
"Da solid porter, glad I was able to try it and I will enjoy the other two that I received."
"This beer is a dark brown with a thick tan head that recedes quickly. The smell is of toasted grain. The taste is of oatmeal. There is also a slight smokey character to this brew. The mouthfeel is good for the style. The drinkability is good. This is a top ten porter for me. Reccommended."
"Good drinkability, it has a lot of high points to it, but just lacks in the taste department. I'd gladly have a couple in a sitting though."
"A decent enough porter with good flavor profile. I just wish it was a little more body."
"The glass is drained and so too this review will end. Cutthroat Porter imported to PA via my traveling brother. Odell pleases the palate again."
"This is a good porter, tons of flavor for something so light. If it were available in Southern California and I was craving a porter, this would do just fine. Nice example of a brown porter."
"Drinkability: A session porter - nothing unique or complex going on; just good drinking beer. Like other Odell's offerings, the flavor seems a little underdeveloped when compared to the bigger offerings of other American craft porters. IBut the smoothness of delivery and the balance of the beer are definitely worthy of return trips."
"The sweet, dark roasted malts dominate this one..with some bitter chocolate and coffee, and a little dark chocolate also. The body is simply too thin to carry the flavors effectively. It goes down alright, but the lack of anything unique and the weak body would probably discourage me from drinking this on any regular basis."
"Roasted malt, chocolate, some very mild burnt grain notes and an even milder smoked elelment. Dark brown body holds a mostly lasting thumb thick and creamy tan head. Fore is roast-bitter with an almost lactose/oatmeal creaminess, mild chocolate notes, faint coffee and some trace candy caramel notes. Pretty tasty and well done."
"-UF"
"12 oz bottle poured into an Imperial pint glass. Rich black color. When held up to the light only a single spot of ruby red shows through. Dark tan head, only about a finger width, and recededs quickly. Light lacing around the edge of the glass. Smell is a robust chocolate malt with a little bit of mocha coffee around the edges. Taste is very full, much like the smell. Finishes clean, very little after taste. Not too complex of a flavor, pretty strait forward. Mouthfeel was a little too light. I like my porters to have a bit more substance to it. Overall, this is a very tastey porter and very easy to drink. I think it can session pretty well."
"Kudos to Odell--I shall never underestimate thee again. This is arguably the best traditional porter brewed in Colorado."
"A very nice porter and quite easy to consume. Definitely a good example of the style."
"Mouthfeel is smooth but not thick. Light carbonation but just right. That is to say there is not too little nor too much. Great session beer."
"This is a highly drinkable porter. Many thanks to bditty187 for this one."
"Aromas a litte pale for a porter, a little hops, coffee, sweet roastiness, and a little chocolate. Wow, flavors explode however. A bit slick on the tongue giving the sense of coffee and chocolate. Mild hops balance out in the end, this is very well done. Haven't had a porter in a couple months and this one reminds me why I love the style so. Carbonation is straight on, just enough to give a slight crispness to the brew, but nothing overly filling. This is my first try from Odell, and I will definitely give the rest a shot."
"Drinkability is good a very solid porter from a solid brewery. Want to thank BGC BIF and babydoc for this bottle."
"Appears dark chocolate caramel cocoa with ruby highlights forms a tan head leaves even streaks of full lacing. Aroma has herbal hops and a bit of some grassiness dark chocolate creamy tones with a touch of coffee soft layers of dark roasted malts slight acidic tart character to it. Taste has doughy chocolate flavor with creamy malt ball highlights light cappuccino character herbal grassy hops seems fluffy like an oatmeal stout great session porter. Mouthfeel has a creamy texture even carbonation extremely smooth medium bodied porter. Drinkability, Odell has become one of the prime prospects from Colorado a defintie must stop if ever driving through like I have in the past, sessionable...the definitive version."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" tan head over the clear dark burgundy brown brew. Head hangs on well, with heavy coating lacing. Aroma is sweet, yet exhibits plenty of coffee as well. Taste follows the nose, with sweet malts upfront, overpowered eventually by dark coffee bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth over the tongue, although perhaps a tad thin, and drinkability is very nice. Good one here..."
"Tastes like a classic porter, perhaps a bit more stout. Roasted coffee, chocolate, and malts. I thought I tasted some sweetness although I did have champagne and other, um, drinks as well. A good beer to start a night as it awakens the taste buds."
"So, this one is a little wierd. At first I liked it, but as it went along, it tasted too much like I was chewing on a tree. The hop choice doesn't do this beer justice as it's got a nice backbone ot chocolate, roast grains, coffee, and black walnut. Could have been a contender...as it is, I'll pass."
" A very nice porter, almost a stout."
"Smooth and creamy, this would make for a good session brew, for just a couple with a steak dinner."
"A nice if unbalanced porter."
"There is a slight watered down that kind of makes the beer easier to drink. But also limits a greater taste. Overall this is a good section beer."
"Pours up very nice deep brown with reddish undertones. Full frothy head about 2 fingers that sticks for a long time. Smell is vibrant, mocha and toasted malts with some hops. This one has a full taste mirroring the smell of toasted malts and mocha very nice. Creamy feel adds to the robust body of this porter. I really liked this one, one of the better porters I have had."
"Overall: Man, this is a good drinking porter. Well balanced with good flavor and a nice progression of flavors and smells throughout each glass."
"Poured a nice black color, much like dark espresso. Coffee is also what the smell reminded me of, burnt coffee to be more exact, also some chocolate flavor. Taste was very good nice smoky roasted coffee flavor with a nice dry finish. This is an awesome porter in my opinion and could drink quite a few of these."
"This has a nice chalky chocolate taste; charcoal dusted fruits with bitter stems and sour skins. It's alive with carbonation. Easy drinkin' porter that rolls around the palate like bouncy, smokey cherry bombs."
"from the bottle, poured a ruby brown with a light tan head. aroma, some chocolate, malts, coffee, and some hops. flavor, roasted malts, bitter sweet chocolate, with a touch of dark fruitts like plums. not to bad of a beer, I just might buy some more of this"
"Wow... I didn't know what I was missing. Tastes much better with the ability to smell. ha!"
"Overall, this is a well balanced porter - maybe a tad on the sweet side. This is a great fall back beer that I find myself drinking often."
"On tap at Barleys. Some floral and citrus hops with roasted malts. Vary dark brown to black. Full, lasting, tan head, with good lace. Light roast flavor. Little bitterness. Fruity. Pretty thin. I think this is supposed to be a robust porter. Somthing is wrong. I may re-rate some day."
"OVERALL COMMENTS: Just what Id expect from Odell  a good, solid, slightly hopped-out porter that I can get locally fresh. This beer, however, can be hit and miss; two batches can taste like two different beers."
"I toured the Odell Brewery with brewmaster/owner Doug Odell personally doing the honors. If you get to Fort Collins, it is worth your time. A beautifully set up, organized and well-run first class operation! Bins full of imported English malts, a huge variety of hops and all the bells and whistles. They make wonderful beers, ales, stouts and this Porter: In appearance it is an almost black brown, with a mass of coffee au lait foam that is sticky and long lived. It has the aroma of roasted Arabica coffee with rich cream, and dark malts. Body is medium, carbonation perfect for the style. Initial taste is of black coffee, slightly bitter, but balanced with enough malt to keep it in line. There are enough hops, and hints of toffee, basil/mint and burnt sugar. Finish is pleasant enough to cause one to want more. Would go well with a strong, spicy cuisine. Excellent!"
"Drinkability: Very high. Low alcohol content makes this a good choice for a session beer IMO, although one might get filled up. A recommended try if it is available. Purchased 6-pack on 4/5/05, bottled on date 12/10/04 (hard to read). Still plenty good."
"The presence of a metallic taste in 4 of the 6 pack is an indication of a problem in the production of this beer IMHO"
"I've had Cutthroat Porter on more than an occassion, and have been impressed. The last batch I bought was kind of off too, so I think it's where I'm getting it, not the brewer's fault."
"Really kick-ass porter."
"Overall this is a damn fine beer. Too bad someone else drank the other two beers for my BOM box. Now I have to find a way to replace them."
"this is an interesting brew worth trying. It's clean finish makes it quite drinkable."
"This beer, more than most, is a perfect example of why I prefer porters to stouts. What I actually prefer is a beer that lives in that netherworld between the two styles. In other words, a thick, rich, creamy, roasty, chocolatey, hoppy, drinkable beer that improves as the bottom of the bottle approaches. I just described Cutthroat Porter to a 'T'. Odell has reason to be proud."
"Drinkability is high. I could have many of these on a cold winter night...if only I lived in CO."
"Odell Cutthroat Porter was served from a 12oz. bottle. In a pint glass, the beer appeared nearly opaque, but on closer inspection with backlighting, it was a lovely ruby-brown hue. It was topped by an attractive fine light tan head that left very nice lacing. The nose consisted of luxurious creamy milk chocolate and creamed coffee notes. On the palate, this beer presented an excellent dry roasted coffee and cola malt base, accented with root beer sasparilla and nutty almond, and finished with a well-done bitter finish. Deftly crafted, this beer didn't rely on massive flavors to impress. I really enjoyed the dryness, flow, and balance of the flavors. As such, it drank quite well. The body was appropriately full and carbonated for the style and flavors. A solid and finely honed porter. Big 'ol thanks to prAna for making this review possible."
"Pours a pitch black with a creamy tan head. Just like a cutthroat trout...errr, maybe not. Still very nice looking porter. Smells of sweet roasted cocoa beans, with lurking bitterness. Taste starts with roasted bittersweet cocoa/coffee malts. Nice wave of bitterness comes in and balances quite well. Finish is coffee bitter with lingering chocolate. Creamy, full mouthfeel makes for a smooth, satisfying, easy drinking porter."
"The beer pours a deep black color with a thin off-white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It's full of black and roasted barley; very rich and dark. The taste is good. It is very dark. It has real black malt flavor. It is dry on the finish, but goes down smooth. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good porter. I prefer a larger, darker head, but this was fine; a good drinker. This beer had lots of blackness to it. You gotta love a brew that works a niche like this beer does."
"Pours out a jet black color with a medium tan head that reduces to a thin layer but stays throughout the whole sitting. Uh waiter I'll have a extra strong coffee black hold the cream and the sugar, and add a touch of chocolate and hops and you get this porter. Smell is straight up coffee and a little bit of chocolate. This is medium to full bodied brew, very smooth to drink and enjoyable. I'd like to thank Nick(ColoradoBeerman) for hooking me up with this and a whole array of Colorado brews."
"One of Odells finest. I used to get it fresh in Fort Collins before golf at the ""link n greens"" course right across the street from the brewery. Dark in color. Not much head. Very sweet but balanced with other flavors. Smooth for a porter. Wish I had one now. One of the better porters I've sampled. One of the best beers from the best brewery in Fort Collins. Oh the other breweries....New Belgium...Anheiser Busch...HC Berger...BigHorn..."
"This one showed up in the January BOTM shipment. Pours a deep, dark black with an off-white, almost caramel colored creamy, frothy head. Lacing is thick and beautiful. Aroma almost strictly of rich roasted coffee beans, with a hint of dark chocolate. Rich body holds a well-rounded flavor of coffee, anise, and very slight hop bitterness that becomes more pronounced on the finish. Overall a very good beer, but I'm not quite agreeing with the hype on this one. An excellent porter, yes, but I still prefer mine a little bit sweeter."
"Awesome richness in color-damn near black with miniscule hints of amber if you look closely. Super fresh roasted coffee aromas-in fact, the aromas are like having the freshly roasted bean in hand. In the mouth you can almost get the oils from the roasted bean. Again more coffee, and a little sweet cream, with a near perfect dose of bitter-boy is this good! Bittersweet chocolate and sweet malt chime in as the beer warms. This is a highly drinkable, complex, and very delicious porter!"
"The palate is attacked by dark chocolate and an impressive array of roasted malts. Coffee flavors are present along with caramel and toffee. A pretty aggressively hopped porter as well. Excellent!"
"Dark black in color, nice lasting creamy off-white head that leaves a sticky lacing in my glass, roasty chocolate-coffee aromas. Roasted burnt chocolate coffee flavors, nice bitter-sweet flavors, good roasted bitterness in the finish. Medium body with a full, soft and creamy mouthfeel, I am really impressed with this brewery so far, a great porter."
"One of those beers that really pushes the right buttons for me...I would call it one of my favorite porters..."
"This went great after my campfire grilled chicken and seasoned waffle fries at the end of busy day of hiking."
"Thanks to jaybeerman for the bottle."
"Completely black color, with a full and frothy cocoa-colored head. Aroma is sweet and chocolately, quite roasted, rich, deep, dark. Intense coffee flavoring! Full body, decent texture, a clinging finish. A dark character dominates the flavors, but it's never too better and entirely quaffable. Not a porter for the namby pambies, and a treat for this porter lover. Hats off to Marc77 for the trade!"
"Acquired via trade. Pours a light mahogany color with a ruby-red halo. Thick foamy tan head that lasted pretty well, and nice lacing. Aroma of roasted malt and coffee. Flavor is sweet, mostly malt with some chocolate and cocoa lingering. I felt everything was a little on the thin side though. Mild hops in the finish, but overall the beer was a little too soft."
"Poured a dark brown color with an off white head. The lacing formed perfect rings around the glass and there was good carbonation. Roasted malt dominates the smell with a hint of chocolate hidden deep. This beer is pretty tasty. A malty sweetness at first sip with a good full mouthfeel. The finish had more bitterness than other stouts I've tried, but is wasn't bad. This beer was balanced well. I would drink this one again."
"This is a very good porter, one of the best that I have had for quite awhile. I can't remember if I have tried this beer before, but I will certainly have it again."
"Black hue with minimal reddish highlights, opaque smallish beige head, quick to fade to a bubbly residue, spotty unorganized lace. Pleasant nose, mellow chalky chocolate, smooth roasty malts too. Lovely palate, dry roasty/chalky malts, chocolate notes with mildly aggressive hops that rush the finish with a great flurry. Delicious. The body is a touch thin in spots, equally slick, as it is chewy. Medium body. Not as tasty as Bully! Porter but Id gladly quaff this one again. Good stuff. Try one."
"Notes: Profound in character, Odell’s was aiming for the middle ground between Porters and Stouts … good stab at it. A more than decent Porter it is, I’m quite fond of this palatable brew."
"A good example of style, Cutthroat Porter from Odell will satisfy any craving for a World Class Porter."
"This is a deep dark beer with a heavy chocolate malt aroma on top of a foamy tan head and sea of black beer.  The initial taste is of sweet chocolate malt followed by a huge roasted malt flavor and a light bitterness in the finish.  This is a quality and very drinkable porter.  The body is just heavy enough."
"Nice, creamy tan colored head that lasts fairly well. Very deep, almost black in color. Strong aroma of sweet chocolate malt. The flavor bursts into your mouth with a good level of carbonation and a light/medium body, full of rich roasty notes. There's not much in the middle but it finishes with very light coffee and toffee notes and a swirl of hop. The finish is soft, and gently flows away leaving a dry bitterness and lingering roastiness."
"Pours a nice blackish color with a thick creamy tan head that leaves a nice lace all the way down.  The smell is all burnt malt with the slightest note of hops.  The flavor starts off with the burnt malt flavor and then the sweetness of the malt comes through to balance the burnt flavors.  As the beer finishes the hops become evident and leave a slight bitterness in the mouth.  The beer is smooth and very drinkable.  This is a real nice example of the style.  Very smooth and great full flavor.  Thanks to Jaybeerman for the sample."
"This is an awesome porter, a must for porter fans, like me.  Smooth and velvety full-bodied mouthfeel.  Plenty of rich chocolate and coffee flavors, nicely balanced with bursts of hops.  Funny, it's geographically brewed between the East and West coasts.  Stylistically, that makes sense, since it fits between a drier, maltier Eastern style and hopped-up, bigger Western one.  Thanks jaybeerman for the beer!"
"Deep red hue and nice clarity is evident when this beer is held up to the light.  The initially thick, tan head settles and thins, but has excellent retention.  Earthy and floral British hop nose is accompanied by a dark chocolate - like aroma from the roasted grains.  Along with the chocolate malt, there's a hint of black patent sharpness in there that works quite well.  Medium bodied with an excellent balance of roasted grain and hop bitterness.  Dark chocolate flavors persist throughout the sip.  Finishes with a tingle of hop bitterness and subtle sweetness.  Not overdone like many microbrewed porters I've had.  Complex flavors meld nicely in this brew, and it's neither too rich nor too mellow.  Cutthroat's a very drinkable and enjoyable porter."
"Pours with light brown, two-fingered head, fades slowly and leaves a even lace. Medium carbonation and body. Nearly black color. Nose is the normal malty/hoppy-ness of a porter, starts malty and hoppy and finishes with a nice mostly malty bite. Very fresh - brewed 12/13/03. The ABV is 4.5%."
"Smooth, balanced, roasty porter with a long chocolate finish. The best I've had."
