"Smoky, chocolate, smooth excellent porter"
""
""
""
"Overall: A classic porter for me. This one is robust yet very drinkable and notable for its clean lager-like caramel flavor that blends nicely with the roasted notes."
""
""
""
""
""

"Exceptional porter. I've heard people compare it to North Coast's Old Rasputin but I have to say this is better. Smoother, more complex hop character and a wonderful mouthfeel characterize this brew. Inky black with a tinge of ruby red at the edges, it's a beauty to behold. Very bittersweet, malts and hops have good balance. Haven't been disappointed in any of Great Lakes beers thus far."
""
"Toasty and smokey. Dark and elegant. Very tasty."
""
""
""
""
"3/29/15 (Bottle) - Black thin pour, minimal tan head, mild carbonation. Chocolate dark roast coffee aroma and taste, very pleasant. Texture light and thin, light carbonation, nice clean taste. Overall very good beer."
"Edmund Fitzgerald is an unassuming and easy drinking porter. I tend to prefer a more assertive flavor profile but had no problems here. Solid stuff that could possibly serve as a an introduction to dark beers for the uninitiated."
""
""
""
""
"Dark garnet color approaching black away from the light.  Thick tan head that clings to the glass.  A strong roasty, nutty aroma continues to the bittersweet taste, with hints of creamed coffee and chocolate, and nice hop bitterness in the background for exceptional balance.  Creamy and fairly full bodied for the style.  A very solid porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Actually tasted like the lines weren't cleaned at this bar so don't know if this will be accurate. Surprising citrus flavor but taste and carbonation seemed flat so will blame it on dirty lines"
"Very flavorful porter with a little bit hops the shines through and mild chocolate coffee finish. a good dark beer to break someone into dark beers who previously felt they were to bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark black cherry red color; minimal head; lacing is present, but not much.  Taste is cherry, chocolate, raisin, a faint hint of liquorice.  Excellent porter.  Enough hops to balance out the warmth of the malts.  One of my faves."
""
"Great aroma, mouthfeel and taste, this could be my favorite Porter ever"
"I remember this being one of my favorite porters/stouts, but today when I reviewed, I was a bit underwhelmed. It didn't taste exactly like I remembered. Mainly I don't remember it feeling so watery. But it was still great. I would highly recommend this to everyone."
""
"Overall: The best porter I have ever tasted by far. It just blows everyone else out of the water."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is worth revisiting if you find it on cask."
""
""
"Good straight from the refrigerator. But much, much better just a bit below room temperature."
"Pours a deep, dark brown with tan head which quickly resolves to a fine lacing. Smells of dark chocolate, roasted malts, milky stout type aroma. Taste is sweet malts forward, chocolatey, roasted  nice balance with hops mid taste, a hint of salty soy sauce, with a hint of citrus/pine without being jarringly bitter and a clean, dry finish. Medium bodied with mild effervescence, very smooth and. Increases in complexity as it warms. Overall, great representative of this beer variety, price point is good for such an incredible beer. Adding this one to my list of great, easily quaffable beers."

"Years ago had this unknown for the first time and it has never left one of my top beers especially for the price you can get such a quality beer. Not too overwhelming and easy to drink but great flavor. Probably the most smoky smelling and tasting beer I've had. Essence of chocolate, cocoa, coffee along with a caramelly, sweet backdrop. Settles nicely in the mouth. Really good beer."
"On tap at Ashley’s, Ann Arbor. Pours nearly black with red at the edges. Rocky head that sticks all over. Aroma: coffee, creamy chocolate, caramel. Taste: roasty and creamy sweetness with chocolate and coffee notes plus a mild but balancing leafy hop undertone that hints at citrus as it fades. Medium-full bodied, chewy/full texture, dry finish."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Has a  coffee, dark chocolate and dark roast malt taste with a bit of a caramel note too. The best porter!! Excellent and smooth."

"As a shining light in the darkness of a night on the great lakes, so to does this beer reflect a light house serving as a beacon for the lost and weary.  Sliding off the cap, I'm met the with jovial and familiar scent of hops and malted goodness in a way unique to the kind folks at the Great Lakes Brewing Co.  The beer pours like silk but reminds one of primordial ooze, and as such nourishes as a delight strewn from the depths of mother earth's replenishing fluids and karma.  You've had beers and black lagers and other assorted alchemy from micro-brewers across our great nation, but a porter like this ultimately becomes sacred and holy.  Bless Edmund Fitzgerald, and all of his noble servants."

"Dark but light enough for Amber to shine around the edges of the glass.. A/T feels more a mix between an Amber and porter.. caramel, slightly roasted malt, earthy herbal tea bitttnerness.. Good beer glad I have five more."

"Such a nice coffee and milk chocolate medley that lingers...tight porter"
"O: Toasty, with nice flavor. Will be getting a six pack of this soon."
""
"If I had my eyes closed I could not tell it was a porter. Plain."
""
""
""
"Enjoy!!"
""
""
""
"O: excellent porter style, very flavorful"
""
"Overall a terrific tasting porter! Nice amount of chocolate and coffee and roasted smokiness!"
"Without a doubt Edmund Fitzgerald is one of my top 3 or 4 Porters. Almost completely black color with some ruby tints. Very smooth across the tounge with smokey coffee, carmel and dark chocolate prevalent. Blend of flavor is perfect. Understated and not overwhelming. In my opinion this is Great Lakes best offering. If you love porter...this one has to go on your bucket list."
""
""
"Overall: This was a very good beer, I'll seek this one out again."
""
"Everything about this beer is bold and that's what I like about it yet it's not too much of anything or too overwhelming. Well balanced and complete doesn't lackntoo much only leaves you wanting another.'"
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with a major espresso note, but not too bitter or overwhelming"
""
""
""
""
""
"MMMM this one is good every time.  Nice full body and taste when in the mood for a porter or stout but low enough abv for when I don't wanna get too F'd up.  Ed Fitz everybody!"
""
"A classic porter from Great Lakes. Reviewing from draft served in imperial pint glass. Pours a deep, dark coffee color with a tan head. The coffee and bakers chocolate notes are apparent from the nose on this, and come right through from the first sip. There is a reassuringly medium body here - with appropriate carbonation. An excellent porter, which does a fine job of providing roasted notes with a solid hop profile underpinning everything to keep this lively."
"Just didn't like it very much"
"One of the great porters.  Roasty and not heavy  feeling."
""
"Excellent. Complex smoky, chocolate, coffee notes. One of the top 3 porters I've ever had."

"I suppose this is basically what I think of when I picture the quintessential American Porter.  Unfortunately, this type of beer really isn't for me.  There is more of the roasted, burnt coffee type of bitterness than the bittersweet chocolaty taste that I was hoping for.  Just not for me."
""
""
"A good porter, but not up to Founders Porter standards. A little thin... nice roastiness, good hop profile"

"This has been a staple in the beer fridge.  Malty but not overly sweet.  At this ABV it could easily be sessionable, but I can only take a little bit of a porter/stout at one sitting.  Very or?well-balanced, easily available - what more could you ask for?"
""
""
"The perfect Porter...enough said!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thanks to @Brewski. This porter poured a deep midnight oil!. With an almond colored head that dissipated quickly. The Aroma is that of sweet malt and chocolate. the taste is a little bitter sweet with the hops coming through at first and the sweet malts finishing it off. Overall a very complex and delicious beer. Everything I hoped for"

"This is a great beer. As others said.....very dark, almost black with some ruby undertones. Smell is of charred coffee and chocolate. taste is exception, with some caramel thrown in their and finishes like some dark bitter chocolate. So so so so good. Never heard of it before, but ""The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald"" by Gordon Lightfoot has been one of my favorite songs since my dad played it on his stereo years ago when I was just a boy. I can't wait to share one of these with him."

"I can see why the rating is what it is.  There is a lot of interesting things going on here, and overall it's yet another solid beer from Great Lakes.  There's just something about it in the end that made me downgrade it against the BA calculated score, and it has to do with the back end of the taste in offering I had.  I definitely need to have this again to verify my thoughts on this review."

"Aroma was alcohol & hops. Very bold flavor. I tasted an oaky flavor making me wonder if this beer is aged in a barrel. Overall a very good beer."
""
"Went to a Bdubs and low and behold Edmond was on draft. Poured in a pint glass cool but not frosted.  Nice lacing and just a wonderful flavor of  roasted malt and chocolate. It poured a deep dark almost black color. Wife had one as well so u know it's good"

"The Rest:  A really nice Porter, here.  More chocolate than coffee and a little light on carbonation, but very enjoyable none the less."

""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - a truly fantastic porter, probably the best I've ever had, and I'm impressed with the accessibility. Delicious and inviting, robust enough to hit the spot, yet light enough to have more than a couple, Edmund Fitzgerald strikes a great balance and is a beer all beer lovers should try."
""

"Very smooth porter. I get a slight smores flavor. Sweet, chocolatey and roasted. Probably one of thw few dark beers I like ice cold. For some reason it brings out the milky sweetness."
""
""
""
"Edmund Fitzgerald pours a wonderful deep cola brown with a thick fluff crown of light tan . The aroma is that of bittersweet chocolate and dates, and a touch of something like black cherry. The flavor is phenomenal, especially for a low ABV porter! An initial burst of dark cocoa and dash of chocolate gives way to a grainy base. There is a mouth feel that is soft, much like chocolate mousse. The entire effect actually is a creamy, dairly like one. The mouth feel is rather light, it's not very strong or syrupy at all, but as I mentioned it has a great taste, leaving nothing to be desired. A great anytime beer for dark brew lovers."

"Bottle was 3 days past the best by date, so I will need to revisit this one."

"O: Pretty much everything I look for in a porter.  One of the best ‘standard’ porters out there in my opinion.  Always a pleasure to drink.  Glad I finally got around to reviewing it.  Highly recommend.  4.5"
""
""
""
"One of the best porters."
""
""

""
"O: This is just a good, solid porter. Whenever I meet someone who doesn't yet know what a porter is, I introduce them to the style with this beer. It generally changes expectations as to what a porter should be."

"Poured a dark brown-reddish color with a nice tan head. Smells how a porter should with some chocolate and coffee notes. I always enjoy the beers Great Lakes comes out with. I definitely recommend this beer to anyone that enjoys porters. If you don't have Great Lakes in your area your missing out!"

"An outstanding porter. Is it the best I’ve ever had? I’m not sure. I’d have to go back through lots of reviews at this point, and I lack the motivation to do that right now! Right now, I can’t think of many others to put in its company. Big shout out to ShroudOf Doom for the opportunity to try this!"

"O:  Thanks to ShroudofDoom for giving me two bottles of this, since I hadn't had it (along with a few other beers).  This is some tasty stuff, super easy to drink and fairly sessionable.  Makes me wish we got Great Lakes.  The best porter I've had that isn't retired or a one-off."

"Was super excited to try this one, as I love a great porter and this beer has generated tons of love.  Ended up being quite letdown with this it though. Pours black with a khaki head. Aroma is roasty with dark chocolate, fruits, and some coffee. Also there is a good dose of sweet sugars. Flavor followed suit and was completely derailed by the presence of a high concentration of sugars. Seemed to me like the recipe is a good one but there was an issue with the brewing process. A heavy mouthfeel. Overall, thought this had glimpses of being the great porter everyone makes it out to be but derailed by some intense sugars. Maybe I will give this another shot in the future but for now I will stick with the amazing Founders Porter for my porter fix."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Yeah, I can see why this is a highly coveted porter. Wish I had more, but I'm sure I'll see this beer again sometime in the near future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The smell is rich with sweetness and some grains. You also pick up on some bitterness in this brew. The taste is rich at first with some bitterness at the end. This is a real nice balance brew. There is nothing over powering in this brew. The mouthfeel is nice. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.5 out of 5. I would get this brew again."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"It had rich flavors of coffee, chocolate, and vanilla. There was mild bitterness and lingering toasted oats flavors. It had a medium body which is nice for the alcohol content. It was very smooth, silky and light all at the same time. Really good porter."
""
"Great Lakes makes some good stuff, I have yet to try anything that I didn't like from them. Add this to my Great Beer list!"

"I really wonder about the age of this bottle, and the intended flavor. There's a significant stale taste, that only builds as the bottle warms, and that's really ruining it for me. I'd like to try it again, possibly on tap, and see if maybe it's supposed to be a hoppy porter, drank fresh."

"Overall - The Legendary Edmund! Not the best porter I've had, but it's up there, and I can see why it's been one of the standard bearers for the style for as long as it has. Drinks somewhere between Rogue's Mocha Porter and Mad River's Steelhead Scotch Porter."
"One word...awesome! Another great beer from Great Lakes. This porter was poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Nice roasty, sweet smell you would expect from a good porter. Poured a great dark brown/ black color with a good, lasting tan head. Taste was complex, malty, and dark chocolate flavored with the roasted barley really coming through at the end. Nice mouthful of beer, but after two you would be full. Overall, this is an awesome porter that I definitely recommend."

"Solid beer, easy to drink, hits all the high points of this style. This was my first great lakes beer and I was impressed."
""
"Black in color and yet it will yield to a slight bit of light when held under scrutiny. A half inch of khaki colored head appears on top. Brussels lacing. Aroma of slightly smoky robust dark malt. The front of the palate is bitter,dark malt and toffee. More robust dark malt and a smoky bitterness is in the back of the palate. The fade is a residual dark malt,coffee and a toffee fade. The mouth is a bit thick and chewy with all of that rich,dark malt. There's a lot going on here."

"Good, not great. Would be a 5 except for the slight harshness. A good sit by the fire on a cold night when I'm stuck working out of town in Cleveland beer. After effects are tough with this one if ya know what I mean. Mildly hoppy and a strong finish."

"To say that this is one of the most beautiful pours I have ever seen is an understatement. This ale pours a very dark rich mahogany with a thin off white head that leaves a gorgeous silky lacing. The aroma is that of lightly brewed coffee, European dark chocolate, and toasted malts. The nose is lighter than expected but quite delicious none the less. The flavor follows the nose perfectly but with a greater intensity. It begins with coffee then gives way to sweeter chocolate and malty notes and finishes with a just slightly bitter coffee bite. My only complaint is that the body is so light. II'd love to have these flavors coat the palate and last far longer than they do. Great porter! Worth every accolade it has received."
"Just had this brew. Pours deep, deep brown bordering on black. Light does make its way through the sides of the glass creating the glow of brown. Light tan head, this beer creates a beautiful sticky spotty sheating down the glass. Not really dark enough for my eye but the lacing makes up for this. The aroma brings scents of chocolate, bitter bakers cacao, roasty notes, and clean yeast. Does not really jump out of the glass. The flavor is fairly basic, but that is a strong point. Cocao, chalky notes, clean un-bitter roast, and coffee. Nice porter. The mouthfeel is basic, medium to full bodied, moderat carbonation. Overall the strength of this beer is that it is perfectly unremarkable. That sounds bad, but it isn't."

"O- This is an awesome porter. I just turned 22 so haven't been in the craft game long, but I'm stoked to take a trip to Cleveland this year to watch the Indians and Browns. Definitely going to hit up GLBC's brewery, and if the Browns repeat history I'll probably be stumbling out of there. Cheers!"

"O: Ehhh, pretty good. Not my favorite porter, but a combination of some pleasing properties. Nice ability to drink, doesn’t strike me as too heavy or filling. Reminds me of a double, without the fruity funk. I guess I’m more of a stout guy, I just wish it were chewier and bigger. Very enjoyable overall."

"Deep brown color with 2 fingers of tan head. Aroma is very strong and sweet featuring molasses and brown sugar. Flavor is also very sweet like the aroma, with a hint of chocolate. On the lower end of the carbonation scale, but still has average mouthfeel. Overall an excellent porter."
""
"Overall: This beer packs a ton of flavor for 5.8% abv. Not quite as robust as the Founder's or Smuttynose Porter's, but the flavors and aromas blend extremely well and it is a perfect session beer. If you're a fan of beer, regardless of style, I highly recommend this. Barley, hops, yeast, and water. World class indeed!"

A fail-safe option at any time, and readily available. If you're a porter fan and haven't had this bad boy, what are you waiting for?"

"The beer pours a dark, coffee brown with a small head of medium sized, tan bubbles and a middling retention. In body, the beer appears clear but nearly opaque from its darkness, slight hints of ruby and garnet can be seen when held to the light, but no particles seem to be present. On the nose, the beer smells of toasted oatmeal bread, rich caramel sauce, soft burnt popcorn, and fresh coffee beans moving into instant coffee mix. Light dark chocolate can be sensed from time to time in the nose, but the overall impression is of instant coffee, toast, and caramel sauce. On the tongue, the beer tastes smoothly sweet with a nice roasted bitter finish. Just a touch of acidity and a little hop bitters can be sensed in the beer towards the finish. In flavor, the beer begins as burning caramel sauce, working into light roast coffee, caramel malt, and a touch of herbal bitter hops. Light burnt popcorn flavors can also be sensed. The finish is of a middling length and is herbal bitters mingling with burnt black malt, touches of coffee, and just a hint of dark chocolate. The aftertaste is nearly non-existent. In the mouth, the beer feel on the light side of full-bodied, with a very smooth, silky mouthfeel that is just gently chewy. Carbonation is middling with a soft prickly scrub on the palate. The mouth is left a little wet with saliva but only a soft astringency on the tongue, and little else. Overall, this is a nice porter. I could put a couple of these back on a cold winter’s day and be happy, and this would pair very nicely with a thick stew or shepherd’s pie. It’s not my favorite in the style, honestly, but I think that is because it is so classically “a porter” that it doesn’t stand out much to me. I would have this again for sure, but I don’t know if I would buy it again."

"Poured from a 12oz bottle. Smell%3A  Sweetness%2C chocolate%2C coffee beans%2C roasted nuts. The smell gets better as the beer warms. Taste%3A Sweet dark chocolate%2C slight coffee flavor. Not as smokey of a flavor as I had hoped. It's a solid beer. Glad I bought a six pack. I feel like I'm missing something that might take another beer or two to pick up"
""

"If you are looking for the body/feel of a Founders Porter you may be disappointed. However, the thing I like the most about this beer (outside of price and availability) is that I dont know of any other beer that offers the flavor at this ABV and thinner body. Smokey, roasted malts with chocolate and coffee. You can drink an entire 6 pack in an evening and not only enjoy the hell out of it, but not regret it."

"Pours out dark as night with a finger, beige head with pretty good retention. Smell is a little malty, seems to be some coffee in there, and I think I sense a TINY bit of sweetness. Taste is dark fruits, nice coffee, and a little bit of hops in the background. Mouthfeel is light as is to be expected for a low ABV beer like this so it seems to be right on target. Overall this is a very well put together beer and is a great example of a low ABV porter."
"Overall - An enjoyable porter but I've had several are are in this same flavor zone so it doesn't really stand out from the crowd to me."

"After my last tour in Afghanistan, I was stationed in Ft Knox, KY. A friend of mine lived close by in Dayton, Ohio. It was there that I first found Edmund Fitzgerald Porter. This beer is why people die of alcoholism. It is totally addictive and a tribute to American ingenuity. On my way back to New England, I bought 5 cases to take home. WITHOUT A DOUBT, this is the best porter in the world! Thank you Great Lakes."

"An excellent brew, not my favorite of the GLBC year-rounds but solid nonetheless. Pours a rich, dark brown verging on black with fluffy tan head that's quick to dissipate. Sweeter on the nose than one might expect, with milk chocolate and caramel malts giving way quickly to lightly roasted coffee. Not a terribly strong aroma. The taste follows the nose more or less: chocolate, caramel, roast malts with a slightly bitter coffee aftertaste that does quite linger as long as I want it to. It's nuanced and complex, but I'll agree with a previous review who called the flavors ""muted"" somewhat. It just doesn't have that big punch that I want in a porter. Still, a well-balanced and very enjoyable beer."

"Similar to Founder's Porter, but perhaps a little more intricate. Outstanding. Recommended!"

"Pours a dark body, light tan head. Retention and lacing is good but expected a little bit more. Aroma of wood & bitter-sweet chocolate. Flavor has a nice smoky, roasted taste with some burnt malt. Finish is strong on the mix of bitter-sweet and dark chocolate. Well balanced and well done."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: For many, this seems to be considered ""THE"" porter. There is a great variety of Porters out there but this seemed to live up to the hype. Despite the rather heavy flavor, this brew is easy to throw down, perhaps a session porter? I think yes."

"O - Outstanding porter - one of the best there is. This brew is in the beer of fame for a reason."

"Feel: medium body with well chosen low carbonation."
"one of the classic American porters here, a longtime staple of great lakes brewing. best on tap, it pours nearly black, not as thick as some, but impenetrable to light and sporting a cool inch of khaki head on it that leaves prominent lacing as it sips. massive dark roasted barley flavors, dry and bitter, with generous hops for the style. the ale yeast marries the grain perfectly, and its a really smooth a robustly flavored result, almost smoky, almost cocoay, almost charred. I really like the combination of depth of flavor and drinkability in this beer, which is only medium bodied, quick finishing for a porter, and ultra smooth texturally. well enough carbonated, this coal colored porter is a standby in colder weather for me, creamy and satisfying. definitely the beer by which all other American porters should be judged, it is spot on in every aspect. also great on a hangover!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very good porter, but not one of my favorites. While I like the very slightly-bitter forward flavors of the beer, I didn’t love it. I prefer my porters to have just a little less roasted, smoky bitterness to them. This beer is nicely crafted, it’s just not one of my favorites."

""
""
""
""
""

""

"Pours a brilliant black with clear ruby highlights. A medium tan head. Aromas of dark chocolate. Taste begins with some espresso, then dark chocolate, with a mild grain middle, and a smooth earthy finish. Mouthfeel is good. Overall an excellent porter."
""
""
""
""
"When people ask what the difference is between a porter and a stout, this lacks the strong roasted malt quality that a stout does. To me, this is a benchmark porter and one of my favorites along with Smuttynose and Anchor, though it is a bit lighter bodied than both. Overall, a solid, really well-crafted brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very good porter that beats most porters that I've had. The beer is fairly easy to drink and session-able as well as available all year, which make it worth a six-pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A well crafted, if not terribly fascinating, robust porter. I would absolutely recommend this beer to almost anyone--it's a pretty safe and solid bet with lots of flavor for the ABV, making it an excellent sessionable choice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a really solid beer that didn't quite live up to the hype. From what I'd heard, this was an astonishing porter, and while I'd never turn one down, it didn't quite blow me away. Lovely looking cola color. Slightly smoky taste and a slightly thin (for a porter) but lovely mouthfeel. Hints of coffee, chocolate, and a bit smoky. Not super bold but nicely balanced. This is a really easy-drinking porter that you can share with your non-porter-drinking friends."
""
""
"O- A very nice porter that I would put near the level of Founders and Bells."
"This is a very tasty porter that's easy to drink. Well balanced. Just wish it was available in New England. Got this bottle on a recent trip to PA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's an excellent porter, but far different than the porters I love. I think the only miss is the burnt chocolate taste I've come to expect for a porter. This would be a different food pairing, almost closer to a dessert type beer although not quit that sweet. So basically, I really haven't decided on the niche for this, but its not the fall eating chilli type porter that I expect from the class. That said its a very well put together beer."

"O: I first had this beer on a long layover in Cleveland and it was the one good thing about that trip. Now that I am having it again, it is still a solid and welcome beer. Now, if I could only convince my province's liquor board to stock it regularly, I'd be golden."

"Poured a deep clear brown with ruby tints where the light gets through. A nice slightly foamy tan head sits on top throughout and leaves substantial lacing. The aroma is incredible, with notes of bitter chocolate and coffee. The taste replicates it and adds a nice subtle hops kick on the finish. The mouthfeel is just right, not too thick or thin with a nice crispness on the finish. This is a great porter, both bottled and draft."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Almost black in color with a medium light tan head and nice lacing. Aroma is faint but full of cocoa malts and coffee notes. Flavor is smooth and creamy with cocoa malts, light coffee, and very little bitterness. Medium mouthfeel with light carbonation and crisp finish."
""
"Poured into a pint glass. Black with red edges. Smells like burnt coffee and dark cocoa nibs. So well balanced with big smoky coffee flavor and hints of bitter dark chocolate and caramel. Blend of hop bitters, roasted, burnt malt, and just right carbonation. Very sessionable and very good. Perfect for a chilly fall night."

"Usually I drink the IPA from Great Lakes, but will try all their beers now. This one makes a powerful statement for a good full bodied stout. Strong coffee/chocolate flavors at the outset with a nice mild sweet end. Nice light brown head (shared a finger with the dog and he like it, too)."

"On first taste: I have to admit, this is my second try at this brew. The first, it just didnt stand out to me (was tasting a tons of beers that day). But I can say now...I agree with most others on this brew. It is a water mark for porters....if someone were to ask me for a standard porter; I would give them this. Its just thick enough....just deep enough...just enough malts and hop bite. It wont change your life...but it may change the porter you drink :) and the drinkability is awesome....six pack worhty for sure..."

"Superb chocolaty and burnt coffee flavors. Just the right amount of bitterness. Maybe just a bit thin in the body, but that's the only shortcoming. Not quite as bitter and more sweet than many porters. I can see this beer as going great with food. Very easy drinking, making this as good for summer days as winter. A very solid drinker. Did not let me down."

"o: A good porter, perhaps one of the best of its type for summer drinking, although porter is not usually a warm weather go-to style. I suppose as one other reviewer noted, the under 6% ABV makes this an exceptionally flavorful yet relatively sessionable porter."
""
"Overall: A fantastic example of the American Porter style. I wish I could get this in my neck of the woods. Under 10 bucks for a 6er of this is one of the best values I've ever seen. If this was available in New England I'd be buying this as my go-to porter."

"174 calories per bottle at 5.8% ABV. Anticipated a nice dark beer and found this to be a nice choice, not far from a typical Guinness - however it's porter style instead of a dry stout which makes this slightly 2nd choice for me. The taste is very dark and robust with a slight bittersweet twang at the end. A fan of dark beer and this one is average in it's class and far from disappointing - would buy again."

"This thang a lil sweet like my baby mama when I first met her; but unlike said BM, this thang don't make Raul want to go to Aokigahara and ""off"" himself.

"Overall - a flawless porter that goes perfect with BBQ!"
"Had this beer on tap last night at a local bar, to be quiet honest i have not explored to much into porters yet. Im mainly and IPA/Lager drinker but I was having a conversation with the bartender and different styles of beers and she pointed me to this beer. I was amazed at how smooth it was with slight after tastes of roasted coffee and chocolate. This beer alone has made me this twice about porters."

"Overall, this is a pretty awesome everyday porter. Great coffee and dark malt flavors. My only criticism of this beer is that the feel is slightly thin and watery compared to other porters and stouts. I would definitely drink this regularly if my regular bar was in the distribution footprint."
""
""
"Medium mouthfeel, lighter than other porters. Subtle carbonation. Roasted malt , roasted coffee with a slight toffee taste and no bitter aftertaste. Velvety smooth. Quite quaffable and delicious."

"High B"
"Pours very very dark brown with a two finger off white head. Smell is very smokey,earthy, some coffee, some wood, some slight vanilla. Taste is also very smokey, pepper, peppercorn, slightly nutty, some chocolate and vanilla. I get a small amount of hops in the after taste. Has a great smooth mouthfeel without being thick. This porter is so drinkable but loaded with complex flavors. A staple of GLBC"

I couldn't ask for a better example of what fresh, quality ingredients can do! I will take a six pack of this home any night that I need to quietly contemplate anything."

"overall: Did a blind test with Founder's Porter, Bells Porter, and Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald. This slightly nudged the Founders (which was a lot smokier and hoppier), as it was just smooth as you can get in a porter. Highly drinkable, perhaps my favorite porter. This is a well crafted amazing beer, too bad it's from Ohio, I wish I could call this a Michigan beer!"

"This is awesome! I should have invested in a 6-pack of this during my stay, but I had too many beers I wanted to try. This is exactly like a hearty stout without being nearly as heavy on body or senses, yet still tenfold in flavor. Not sure how they did it, but I think the well rounded carbonation, as well as the excellent ingredients they're using here, helped it out. While I'm glad I get stuff like, say, Black Butte Porter out West, I want more of these sometime!"
""
""
""
"Overall, the best Porter out there. It has a blackish/caramel brown color. It smells like roasted malts with a hint of chocolate. There is a perfect combination of roastiness, maltiness, and bitterness. It isn't too thick and isn't going to knock you off your feet. This is the definition of a Porter to me. It makes it really tough on everything else that I try."
""
""
""
"A very nice Porter. The appearance is a dark brown similar to molasses. The head on the beer is also similar to molasses in the sense that it is a thick, dark and tan head. The beer has a very natural and the taste has traces of dark chocolate and coffee which are very apparent. Uniquely this beer has good carbonation for being such a dark beer but it compliments it well."
""
""
""
"O- be of the best examples of an American porter out there. Smoky, chocolaty and silky smooth. This is probably my favorite everyday porter and one that I'm glad I can get very easily."
""
""
"O: A very good porter, was not expecting this after trying the IPA from this brewery, very imprressed, solid and well balanced."
""
""
"A great Porter! Appearance- dark, rich molasses brown. The beer has a thick, dark and tan head that adds to the overall experience of the exceptional beer. The naturalness of the beer comes through very clearly and dark chocolate and coffee noted are very apparent. The carbonation is lively for such a thick, heavier brew, but compliments the beer well."

"I didn't recall as much floral hop character, but it makes things interesting. The roast malt and coffee are kept in check fairly well. Would like a touch more chocolate. The underlying fruity notes are nice."
"The first smell is a smokey coffee, and then subtle chocolate. The taste is wonderful. The creamy flood of coffee and chocolate are well-balanced, but in some way individually bold. From start to finish, it is an overly enjoyable experience. This is how a porter should taste. I would definitely get this again."

"12oz bottle, pours dark brown - nearly black with a tall, frothy everlasting tan head that eventually falls leaving a ton of lacing at the top of the glass. Aromas are smoky, with roasted malts, and baker's chocolate. Robust flavors of roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, caramel, and smoke, meld together with perfect balance. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, definitely a world-class American porter. I always love going back to this one time and time again."

"O: Great beer. I have underestimated this beer for many years... but no longer. This will be my go to porter from here on out. Super good/10."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is going to be my go-to porter. Easy to get, easy to drink, easy to appreciate. For a porter, it packs a quite a bit of the complex character and the flavours I love the most in general- chocolate and coffee especially. I can get it for $7.49/6pk here in Madison, WI and there's no question that's one the best values I've come across. As for beer aesthetics, the only thing that it could possibly improve on is small potatoes- if it were a bit more creamy and fuller bodied, it would be perfect."

"O- good porter with nice roast and semi sweet notes. After having Founders the other day his doesn't quite stack up to it but still very good."

"Don't know why this is so highly rated. This one is to the par but not that good."

"I bought this beer because I couldn't find anything else that looked appealing at the small store I stopped at. It was one of the few beers they stocked in the Porter or Stout category. I'm glad I did purchase it. It pours very nicely with just the right amount of head. The smell is superb and gives hints of chocolate and malt. I found that the taste was slightly behind the smell but not far. It still has a great taste and a nice chocolaty finish. I found this beer to be a great go-to even when other Porters or Stouts are available. I think I will add this to the ""grab it if they've got it"" list for my wife when she makes her trips to the store for me."

"Appearance was chocolate brown with a finger of tan head. There was little retention of the head and only a minimal amount of lace remaining on the glass. Not much of a nose to this offering, maybe a touch of roast. The flavor was roasty, but not quite what I would term robust. There was a very interesting combination of dry bitterness and sweet milk on the finish. A solid porter, but not the best around."

"Pours very dark reddish brown color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense khaki head with nice retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, toast, toffee, light coffee, light citrus, and earthy hops. Aromas are a nice balance, strength, and complexity. Taste of milk chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, toffee, toast, coffee, cocoa, and light herbal. Light amount of roasted coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, caramel, toast, roasted malt, toffee, coffee, and light herbal on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance of robust flavors with nice roasted malt complexity; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic porter! Fantastic roasted flavor balance and complexity, with some nice hop balance; and extremely smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering, cue up Gordon Lightfoot!"

"Black body with some deep red highlights when held to the light, mocha coloured head with good retention and lacing. Nose of dark chocolate, roast and hops. Palate has more roast, light smoke, bitter dark chocolate and hoppy finish. Lingering bitterness and roast prevails. Medium full feel, medium carbonation. A standard for American style porters."

"In conclusion, this is a very nice beer, but hardly world class. My favorite porter is still Founders' Porter. Now that is world class."

"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark, almost black coloring with chestnut highlights under light. A thin, light, filmy, off-white head quickly settles into a surface coating. Aromas of rich cocoa and baker's chocolate, with an undertone of roast coffee. A very rich and balanced nose. Flavors ride a sharp, crisp body, with roast coffee in the forefront, supported by bittersweet chocolate deep in the backbone. Very light, crisp body propelling the flavors across the palate. The dominating bitter from the coffee and chocolate holds strong through the aftertaste, with a touch of milk chocolate dipped at the end. Smooth, crisp, clean finish to this well balanced, well crafted brew."
""
""
""

"Pours an opaque very dark brown with glints of cola brown around the bottom edge when held to the light. Coffee and a bit of cocoa on the nose. Thicker consistency, but too much carbonation too quickly. Big coffee flavor. Some lactose, but not enough, in my opinion. The coffee flavor is nice, but the coffee acidity is barely tempered by the creaminess. The carbonation tends to overpower the lactose feel and flavor. It's ok. I was excited to get the chance to try it again. I'd had it several years ago. But, more recently, there's been quite a bit of hype about it. I don't feel it's lived up to it."

"12oz bottle. Courtesy of mike67. Pours a deep dark reddish brown with a medium brown lasting creamy head. Aroma and Taste of rich dark roasted chocolate malt, some caramel and liquorice notes, and yeast with some bitter notes. Palate is a rich full body, slightly oily with good carbonation. Finish is of roasted caramel malt, dark cacao bitterness, some hops bitterness ending with some lingering dark chocolate notes. Overall a great tasty and all around solid porter."

"Overall a solid porter i wish i had more of,not really filling but very drinkable."
"Edmund Fitzgerald pours out a deep brown color capped with a small head. The aroma is nice and roasty, with chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt. The taste is excellent, it's got such a strong and well-balanced coffee and chocolate aspect that calls back to my first introduction to porters and stouts. To bring that kind of flavor intensity after how far my beer journey has progressed is impressive to say the least. It doesn't go beyond the base porter flavors of roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate, but it does it so well. The mouthfeel is spot on, it's medium bodied and the carbonation level perfectly compliments the flavor. The drinkability is very good. Edmund Fitzgerald is just a world-class porter. It doesn't venture outside the box of what a porter should offer, but is so refined that I can't help but wonder how any other porters sell in areas that Edmund Fitzgerald is available."
""
""
""
""
"Lovely porter, here. Great balance, great drinkability, and overall just a great beer. Anyone looking for a top-of-the-line porter should look no further (unless they haven't already had Founders Porter). Great price, easy to find, and more than enough to fulfill your dark and roasted malty needs. Give this one a shot and thank me later."
""
""
""
""
"O: A superb example of an American semi-robust porter: big dark fruit and roasty notes without being over the top, finished with American hoppiness. I enjoyed this beer, and I wish that I had gotten a chance at this a long time ago. Superb brew and deserving of the love it gets."

"Final Thoughts: Definitely worth a try if it's distributed in your area. The aftertaste is reminiscent of a mocha and lingers for a while. Would I drink it again? Maybe, it's not first on my list of go-to porters."
""
"O: A wonderful beer, the atmosphere that I had created, the gordon lightfoot song was perfect, might have made it taste better, but it is a great porter and its wonderful that its in tribute of the late Edmund Firtzgerald. I love Michigan even though this is made in Ohio. Have one nao."

"This is not the type of porter I normally go for. It's more American (and slightly more steely/bitter) than I prefer, although it is certainly robust enough to be enjoyable for what it is. Could be something off with my bottle, or off with me. I will say that having read more into the reviews of this (and some comparisons), I would order a Founders Porter over this any day of the week. Does that mean Founders' is objectively better? No, just that I prefer it."

"O: Even though this beer is not as good as I remember it, it remains in my mind an excellent porter and one of my favorites in this style."
"Update: 11/16/13... I had three of these tonight after picking up a six pack, and I have to say that this doesn't taste like I remembered, but more like I figured it should, given the fact that it's a porter. First of all, the flavor is lighter than I remember. There's also more carbonation, and there's a smokey character to it that I don't recall getting. It's still a really tasty beer, but really not nearly as awesome as I initially thought. Maybe it's because I got it on tap the first time, but yeah. For a porter, it's on-point. With a name like Edmund Fitzgerald though, I'd expect it to be a stout... really heavy, thick, and high ABV. Definitely one of the best porters I've had, but it's not what I remember. I will repeat again saying that this is a great sessionable porter with a nice smokey twist. P.S., I've found out why this beer is called Edmund Fitzgerald. I'm an idiot."
""
"O: Another nicely done beer by Great Lakes. This is a tops porter in my opinion. It's not anything that will blow you away, but it is definitely solid and nicely brewed. A fine beer."
""
""
"O- Very nice and drinkable. A thoroughly enjoyable porter that is perfect on a colder winter night with a fire going....or any other time for that matter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Aroma focuses on chocolate and roasted dark malts. Flavours are smooth, with the caramelized malt sweetness balancing vanilla, coffee tones and a dry bittering hop & oak tannin finish."
""
"Cheers"
""
""
"D: High. Not overwhelmingly good, but better than I remember it being the first time around. Very smooth, almost velvety, with no overwhelming chocolate or coffee flavors (although strong coffee smells). A great example of what honestly isn't my favorite style."
""
""
""
"Overall: Really nice porter, and can understand why it is so world renowned."
"Deep brown colour, one finger of off white/tan head, lightly lacey. Smell is fairly roasted, malty chocolate, coffee and lightly smokey, a bit of bitter hop in the nose but mostly a big roasted malt. Taste is roasty and bittersweet, chocolate, coffee flavours, fairly big hop bitterness, a bit of pine in the aftertaste also. Creamy, medium-full body, medium carbonation. This is a solid porter I would certainly revisit, I expected a little more but was happy with what I got, good stuff here."
""
""
""
"Overall - A tasty brew with some nice roasty and chocolate flavors. Easy drinking and good."

"I have been contemplating getting this beer ever since I had gotten into craft beers. And at long last, I finally get to try it!. Poured from a bottle into a lager glass. Pours the darkest brown I have ever seen from a beer, with a quarter finger worth of tan head. The head seemingly only half forms at first, but comes through in the end. Leaves a decent amount of lacing, mostly in the bottom of the glass. Smells of dark fruits, slight vanilla, toasted malt, toasted caramel, and slight coffee. The taste hits you with a strong coffee flavor upfront, followed by a hit of burnt malt and dark fruit. Finishes with a medium bitterness. The mouthfeel bring a ton of dark cherry into the equasion, and adds an even heavier bitterness. Reminded me of a Dunkel. Overall, this was a good porter, but I wouldn't choose it over Gonzo."

"O Really nice porter, everything was pretty nice. This is a great off the shelf beer that I would drink all the time if distributed here."
"Taste: Slight roasted bitterness with a nice complimenting sweetness. Not the plum sweetness but more of a malty sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ov: Truly the best example of an American robust porter. I haven't come across a porter that rivals this one. Closest challenger is Founder's Porter."
"O - Decent porter. I've had this once before, and remember it being better the first time."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is very good. For something that has really good flavor the feel is only medium which is nice, not too easy to do for a lot of porters I feel. The carbonation level is very good and there's a nice clean bitter finish from the hops. A really wonderful porter I'm glad I finally got the chance to try it. Great representation of what's probably my favorite style of beer. Top 5 for me, I wish it distributed to my area."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very tasty and balanced American porter that show appreciation for the roasty sweetness of a larger porter but the relaxed 5.8% ABV to keep its drinkability rather high. More please!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is really tasty! I like the way it plays across my tongue. This is really balanced I highly recommend for others to try."
""
""
""
"O - I could drink this all winter. I may like some of the smoked porters more, but after that this is the best porter I've had in a long time."
""
""
""
""
"O: Like I said, I think this is a great baseline American Porter. You really can't go wrong if you pick it up."
""
""
""
"overall a great beer, tasty and interesting. that said, also a bit of a letdown, but only because it comes with so much hype. a fantastic porter to be sure, and one i'd welcome in my glass anytime, but i'm not totally blow away."
""
"This is a really good beer. Definately give it a try."
""
"Poured from 12oz bottle into porter glass. Deep black/brown with a thick tan head that dissipated quickly leaving a good amount of thin lacing. Smell is malt, chocolate and roasted barley. Taste is surprisingly sweet compared to the smell; if it weren't for the smoky character I would believe this was a stout. Mouthfeel is creamy and full. A delicious porter."
"O - Very awesome cool weather beer. Goes great with a hearty meal or just as a desert or sipping beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Really, really nice beer. I can see why it's so highly regarded. Really nothing I can find here that I don't like. The only negative I can come up with, and i'm stretching for one, is the lack of flavor complexity. This is really more of a personal preference, as I really enjoy barrel aged beers that pull out hints of vanilla, bourbon, coffee, etc. I'm getting less complexity here, but the beer is spot on for what it's meant to be. For me, this will now be the Porter against which all others are judged. Excellent brew, and a fantastic way to end my night. I'll definitely be buying this again."

"Overall this is a great tasting Porter that was quite easy going down and had an exceptional bold robust flavor, making this one hek of an enjoyable drinking experience…"
""
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a dark black color typical of a porter. Overall, a pretty typical porter, where there is nothing unique compared to others (like some porters have strong coffee tastes). However, this porter is very well done. Great malt taste with just a hint of hops and chocolate that all blends together very well. It is definitely one of the better porters I have had, and I would highly recommend it."
""
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours dark brown with a long lasting tanned head and nice lacing. Aroma is of bready malt, coffee, vanilla, cacao, chocolate and dark fruit. Body is medium and smooth. Taste is of bready, toasted malt, some earthy hops, coffee, vanilla, chocolate and dark fruit. Not as good as on tap but still wonderful brew."
"Overall a solid American porter. Well-crafted and enjoyable."
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Really nice balance of flavors and it really goes down smooth."
""
"Drinkability: A great porter, possibly the best I’ve had to date. So rich well mixed and earthy."
"O - Truly a fantastic porter. Might be the best I have had to date. Others that come to mind are the Taddy porter and the London porter. Worthy of the praise."
""
""
""
"Very dark brown pour, decent lacing. Excellent scents of chocolate, malt, and licorice. Reminds me why I love porters. A little more charasmatic than Bell's porter, but a bit more acidic too. Fantastic coffee, chocolate, and roasted malt flavors. A marvelous porter, would never hesitate to recommend this to anyone searching for a good porter."
""
"O) This one deserves all the praise it gets. A fantastic Porter that any craft beer enthusiast should try. Highly recommended..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Pleasant beer all around. Fairly simple, yet a little different from most and good."
"This is easily one of the best brews i have had in my lifetime. Sitting around a campfire on a chilly summer day, and this beer warmed my stomach. The mouthfeel of this beer was dark chocolate and coffee. It was the original taste of this brew which initially made me fall in love with it. The deep taste which consists almost strictly of a darker coffee flavor and aroma strikes me as the type of beer that i would legitimately consider drinking for breakfast as a pick-me-up (i say that without feeling like an alcoholic). And being from Ohio, i feel a strange attachment to this Cleveland spawned porter, I have pride that Ohio has created one of the greatest beer i have ever had."

"I haven't had many porters over the last several years but wanted to try this because of its fine reputation and I wasn't disappointed. Very balanced elements of roasted malted, coffee and chocolate flavors with hops to balance. This was medium bodied so you could enjoy a few without feeling overly full. The price and the ABV were both reasonable. IMO this is a very good porter."
""
""

"O- Probably wouldn't buy again, nothing special, nothing to warrant the price or the high ratings."
"O - An excellent example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is a black color with a short tan head. The nose is chocolate, roasted malts, coffee and vanilla. Taking a sip of this and I taste coffee, roasted malts and black licorice. Mouthfeel is medium, finishes with a smooth texture. All in all, a very fine porter to be sure. One of the best ""off the shelf"" porters from recent memory."
""
""
""
""
"O- An amazing low-grav porter. Could use a little more aroma, what's there is very nice, just needs to be a little bolder."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark amber with a small off-white head. Smell is roasted malty chocolate, very light. It is medium and crisp on the tongue, there are smokey, darker tones, but most of it is sweet cocoa powder and coffee beans. There are earthy hops but they are kept well in check."
"Total: 4.28 / 43"

"O: If you want proof that a light(er) beer can satisfy as well as some of the big, bruising behemoths in the beer world, look no further than this bad boy. Not only that, it's hella drinkable, to boot! I'll definitely be on the look for this one in the future."

"Drinkability is good, a very solid American porter. Flavorful, stronger yet smooth. Classic, and well deserved of the reputation it earned for Great Lakes."
""
""
""
""

"O: This beer is very enjoyable and very sessionable, I could and would have more than one of these in a session. I really enjoyed the flavor and it just looked delicious, though I was hoping for a slightly stronger aroma."
"O: Searching for a great everyday Porter? Look no further. This is textbook stuff, folks. It's a classic for a reason - it's well priced, easy enough to find, and most of all it's God damn delicious. A cornerstone of the craft movement."

"Taste/Mouthfeel great full flavor right up in the front, a good sipper w/o being overwhelming this sipping is for savoring as the abv is but a kiss amidst a semi-sweet malt with a nice roast coffee finish. Overall, a nice full and rich porter very well done."

"Single 12 oz bottle given to me by a friend. Served into a stemmed glass. Dark brown body with a great sized tan head. Nice aroma of cocoa powder and chocolate milk. Flavor was spot on also. Dark chocolate, licorice, and just a hint of root beer were flavors that all melded well together. The mouthfeel was a bit thinner than other porters I have had recently, but conversely it made this beer even smoother to drink. Lastly, this beer had one of the smoothest finishes I have had with a porter. There was no roasted aspect left on your palate at all in the end. A very clean finish. Really great brew - I am glad I got this bottle as a souvenir from a fellow beer geek."

"This is just a darn good porter all around."

"O- Great beer, nicely balanced, complex flavors, and spot on the style. The 5.8% ABV makes this an easy drinker and sessionable to boot. If you run across this one give it a try."

""
"O: This porter is fantastic. The taste is complex, flavorful, and balanced. It is exactly what I want in a porter."
""
""
"Really wonderful porter. Nothing overly surprising, but everything is done very well. The flavors are balanced and up front. I am a big fan of this beer. I can see why it is a former GABF winner."
""
""
"Overall, a very good porter. Don't find it often around here, but worth getting a hold of occasionally."
"Delicious."
"This is a great porter. The flavor is balanced and it's easy to drink. I will definitely get this again."
""
"Pours a dark molasses color with a light tan head that is achievable with a moderate pour. Aroma is a blend of black coffee and bittersweet chocolate in similar measure. It tastes similar to its smell, though not quite as pleasing. The roasted coffee flavor overshadows the chocolate notes that I prefer, and both of those have a healthy dose of hops to compete with, which I find to be fairly high for a porter (though it does segway fairly seamlessly into the bitter coffee flavor). The last time I had this I thought the hop presence was way too unbalanced, though this serving has a lesser disparity than I remember. Carbonation is pretty lively for a porter, and a slightly sticky residue persists on the lips. This brew is flavorful to be sure, but it fails to take advantage of the aspects of porter that I most enjoy, leaving me ultimately a little disappointed. No disrespect intended, but I can't really justify the very high esteem in which this beer is held by many."

"Edmund Fitzgerald has a great blend of rich flavor and drinkability. It's smoothness makes it a year-round, even hot-summer-day chocolate/coffee beer."
""
"Pours dark brown with reddish edges, with a small head. There's a strong roast aroma, with some nuttiness and slight chocolate. The taste re-enforces the roasted, nutty aspects. The body is fairly light, with moderate carbonation, and it drinks quite easily. A solid, well-made porter."
"O - Edmund Fitzgerald is a top-notch American Porter. Highly recommended and I'm glad that this is now available in Virgina. Will definitely have again."

"Mouthfeel: This beer is right where I would expect a porter to be rather easy drinking in comparison to a stout but a bit on the thicker side when next to most brown ales."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An ideal Porter. Must try!"
""
"On tap at Owen and Engine in Chicago. Pours a dark cola color with tightly bubbled head and good lacing. Aromas are rather subdued with notes of chocolate, coffee, dark roasted malt, and a hint of bacon. Taste is cocoa, espresso, mild hop bitterness, with some smokeyness. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with dry finish. A very nice subtle but complex American Porter."
""
""
""
"Pours a deep dark brown/black color with a half finger cream colored creamy head. Smells of rich roasted coffee and chocolate. Flavor follows with bit sweet chocolate balanced by earthy, roasty coffee flavors and light hops on the finish. Very rich and robust, thick mouthfeel, with medium carbonation. Yeah, this is goood."
"The beer pours a nice deep cola brown with hints of red when held up to light. The head was thick, creamy looking with lots of retention and lingered for quite a while. The smell is toasted and roasted grain with a hint of coffee and chocolate. The beer tastes chocolatey and grainy up front with hints of a milky creaminess. The middle rounds out a bit with some cola like flavors and the end finishes burnt, smoky, and crisp. There is just enough hop presence in the flavor to balance everything out and provide enough bitterness. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy yet light. The carbonation is at a good lower to medium level. Okay, this is a fantastic American porter and I have never had it before. This is actually my first try and wow is it ever delicious. I have only had two beers from this brewery but both seem wonderful. I love it."

"Cheers to Chadquest for hooking this one up."
""
"Poured this into my deschutes snifter. Head expands like crazy, it is thick and sticky, light tan in color. Retention is good, almost too good as I haven't been able tiger anything but foam just yet. The smell is of roasted malts, a touch of citrus, chocolate. Taste comes in clean and fresh at first, then I get roasted flavors, some nice sweetness, a touch of smoke, hop bitterness. This is a really well made porter, especially if you prefer smokey/roasty over thick/sweet. I rather enjoy it."

"Medium bodied, slightly watery around the edges, but with a gentle, though substantial, carbonation that almost makes this feel like a nitro-tap beer. Result is a very smooth mouthfeel and a well-flowing beer. Finish is semi-dry."

"O - I used to live in Cleveland, where I drank this beer all the time. I don't drink this one enough anymore. A delicious brew, and at $7.99/6 pack from the local Fresh Market, you'll be hard pressed to find better value for money. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Definitely on the higher end of the porter scale, a recommended beer, especially if you like smokey chocolate/coffee tastes. For maximum impact, warm it up from the fridge pull prior to digesting."
""
"O: didn't stand up to the hype. Just a roasty coffee porter that definitely uses black patent or other high roast malt to give it a burnt coffee flavor. Easy drinker but not a standout. Could prove useful for those that aren't used to bolder flavors."
"O: One of my new favorites. I was not expecting too much, and I was blown away. This will certainly be a repeat buy."
"Overall: Like I said, I don’t have a lot of experience with the style but something tells me this one can be classified as the “benchmark” of porters. Outstanding in every way. I wish this came in a 1/6th keg on the east coast, as this would certainly bless my dual-tap kegerator. The 5.8 % ABV makes this pretty darn sessionable. Well done Great Lakes, well done…"

"I haven't had many porters over the last several years but wanted to try this because of its fine reputation and I wasn't disappointed.

"Man, what a beer. This has enough flavor to hang with the RISs, but doesn't have the sugar to reduce the drinkability. Pretty roasty for a porter, but the fruitiness really lets you know this isn't a stout. I wish we could get this in CT - it would be a regular purchase. Thanks, Dan!"

"This is everything I want in a porter. It’s not overly roasted or hopped, or too heavy in body. It’s a very drinkable dark beer that you can enjoy a number of and not fill up on. And definitely let it warm just a bit, as it’s even better 10 minutes or so out of the fridge."

"O: Its really a solid overall, it was just a little light for my tastes if we are talking about porters. I think it’s a bit overrated after seeing the ratings."

"Overall - Solid beer in every way. I'm not the most experience porter drinker, so maybe I'm missing some of the nuances. I will need to research the style further..."

"Notes: phenomenal and my favorite American Beer. This beer reminds me of Fuller's London Porter which reminds me of Edmund Fitzgerald. The smokiness, coffee and cocoa make for a toe curling concoction that is irresistible."

"One of the better porters I’ve had and worthy of its high marks and ranking (#84 Top Beers - United States, #3 American Porter at time of review)."
"Overall: Great porter, not too sweet but leaning more on the bitter side but not overly so. Very drinkable beer. Looks great, smells great, and tastes great."

"This was the first beer that got me into this style and others alike, i wouldn't be doing it any justice if i described it as being anything less then awsome! The taste is quite malty with an almost unsweetend coffee flavor followed by an exceptionaly hoppy finish. 1-2 finger head. this beer is definetly good down to the last drop. If you appreciate a great Porter i urge you to get on deck with this one."
""
"Overall, this is a great beer, and I think I would put it up there on with the best, despite what some people may say. I was a skeptic at first, but I am pleased to say the least."
"12oz bottle thanks to SpdKilz, appreciate it man. Dark black color, good head. The aroma is smoky sort of, dark malts and a hint of smoke like a burnt match, average. The flavor is better, roasty porter with a hint of chocolate and coffee. I'm not sure why this is a top beer, tastes like an average porter to me."
"Even with some age this is a great porter. Glad I got the chance to try it out."
"Drinkability: It is a very tasty and solid porter. It is a fitting tribute to its namesake."
"O - Such an easy drinking, wonderfully complex porter. Great example of the style. A real treat."
"A superb porter. Edges out Founder's, which I also tried tonight in a head to head competition with E.F. The color is not fully opaque and shows hints of root beer redness at the bottom of the glass or when held to a light. Rich pour with a frothy head that subsides pretty quickly but leaves an intricate lace. Smells of dry spice, chocolate, and herbal/mint undertones. Taste is just great: coffee, spice, a hint of vanilla, and slight, hoppy mint. No unwanted fruitiness or sweetness. Finishes slightly dry after a spiky carbonation really opens the beer up in the mouth. Can't say enough, really. The mouthfeel is great with an effervescence not expected in this style of beer. This is on the top of my porter list so far. If you like a fine porter, look no further."
"Cheers!"
"TASTE- so delicious. i was craving a chocolately coffee porter and that's what I got. Overall an amazing porter..."
"Overall- A very impressive porter that doesn't skimp on the roasted grain, but keeps things very interesting with the semi-sweet chocolate and vanilla. These notes seem to morph every sip. This is a well made beer, and a fine tribute to the titular vessel."
"O - This is a great example of the style. And fit the mood of a rainy night."
"Great porter; Great Lakes does it again"
"overall - this is the best porter i've had the pleasure of drinking, I have had other porters that were good, but none exhibiting the balance that is displayed in this product. Will have again most definetly"
"Very tasty and drinkable porter. This is so easy to toss back multiples bottles without craving something else. It makes for a nice go to porter, especially as a chill hits the air this time of year."
"Overall, Edmund Fitzgerald is one tasty American Porter – I’ll have another…"
"Overall an excellent porter I will look to grab again."
"This is a very fine beverage, a real bargain and readily available in my area"
"O- I like this a lot, I prefer more chocolatey porters but this is fine coffee based one"
"Light body with a lot of carbonation, prickly on the tongue. Pretty easy to drink with a smooth roasty flavor without too strong a lingering aftertaste. Very good porter."
"O: This is a really good Porter, glad I've still got another couple bottles from another trade. This is right up there with Black Butte in my opinion, just a roasty, chocolatey, drinkable porter."
"Overall: From my limited tasting of six Great Lakes beers this is my favorite—It may be my favorite from Ohio. This is a very, very nice rich and complex porter. I am certainly glad I got a six pack and am looking forward to the rest of them. This would be a fridge staple if it were distributed locally. I think this one may be a small step below Firestone Walker’s reserve in my overall porter list."
"Overall - Truly an outstanding beer! I was not a fan of Porters at all, but after trying out this beer when a co-worker recommended it to me, I can say that I'm very willing to try more Porters in the future. Another great beer by Great Lakes Brewing!"
"This is the best porter I've ever had."
"O- Very good, I appreciate that the hops don't overpower the malt bill. Certainly one of the better American Porters I've had."
"O- great porter. Another really tasty beer from great lakes. Loof forward to trying more of their beers."
"Cheers!"
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a dark almost black body with not a lot of head, that lays down quickly to a thin lace. The smell is of roasted malt and coffee. The taste if of chocolate and the roasted malt gives it a nice rich flavor. The hops are a little present. The mouth feel is very nice and rolls off the tongue real nice. Overall, i'm not a big porter fan, but this one is good."
"One of my favorite examples of one of my favorite styles."
"Overall: Easily one of the best porters I've ever had.. How is this the only Great Lakes beer I've had to date? I need to fix that.. I'm really looking forward to picking up their Russian imperial stout when that comes out."
"O: Good beer; nice porter. Still, not as astoundingly good as, say, the Dortmunder Gold. Recommended, but not anything to seek out."
"Overall: This beer is a thinner version of Deschutes Black Butte. I really love this beer, but I want a dark beer to be a litte bit heavier. It does have a nice complexity to it as well. Bravo Great Lake Brewing Co this is a delicous Porter!"
"Overall: I had heard lots of good things about this beer and yes it was good. Sadly I was slightly disappointed due to the hype built up around this beer. Still good and I would seek it out again if I was in the area."
"Overall, this is one of the better porters out there, especially if you like coffee. Aside from the thinness (which I might be making up), this beer is awesome. Could see this as one of my staple porters."
"One of the better porters available, and one that I keep stocked in the fridge year round. One of the best offerings from Great Lakes, IMO"
"Overall, a great porter...might surpass Smutty Robust Porter for me but it's close."
"O - yeah, this is a good porter, I've known that for awhile, now I have a numerical score for it."
"Overall a top-notch Porter, one of the best I ever had. Glad I bought a 6 pack of this one."
"Good beer, one of the better porters I've had."
"Speaking of light, it’s hard to get that frikkin’ maudlin Gordon Lightfoot song out of my head ever since I looked at the label. While a six minute earworm may not be a big deal to you, that can register as well over a half hour in dog minutes. Nonetheless, a tasty beer, just don’t look at the label"
"Edmund Fitzgerald pours not quite stout black, with just a sliver of cherry highlights peeking through from the bottom of the glass. The foam that caps the beer is light tan in color, and falls just short of two fingers in height. Head retenetion is well above average, and the beer leaves a fairly good sized ring of suds stuck to the inside of the glass. The nose is a bit weak, and almost reminds me of a milk stout. It's very heavy on milk chocolate, with only a cursory appearance from a coffee aroma. Fortunately, the smell didn't begin to do Edmund Fitz justice. The flavor palate, is all chocolate and coffee, but it's... just about perfect. A not overly sweet chocolate flavor takes the lead on each sip, before a slightly bitter, perfectly roasty note of coffee comes in to close things out. The two couldn't be any better balanced. The body is pleasantly full and chewy for a beer that falls short of 6%ABV, with a low-moderate level of carbonation that fits the beer like a glove. I'd heard a lot of people call Edmund Fitzgerald the best/one of the best American Porters out there, and after having my first I totally get that. This is the rare beer I'd find myself buying on a very regular occasion if it was distributed in these parts."
"A little disappointed after the hype I have heard about this beer. Not enough big time coffee/chocolate/ or even roasty flavor. Not deep enough. Not creamy enough. Good, not exceptional."
"O – I don’t drink porters all that often, and I have grown to consider Stone Smoked Porter the best all around. This was pretty exceptional."
"O: Awesome porter. Extrememly well balanced and tasty through and through. This beer does Cleveland Proud"
"Pours black with thick, tan to brown head and great head retention. The aroma explodes with dark roast coffee and chocolate notes, with a hint of resinous hops lurking in the background. The flavor is even more roasty, brimming with bitter espresso beans paired with a slightly sweet chocolate aspect. Earthy and complex but with lighter, citric brightness coming through as well. Full body and big, chewy mouthfeel for a relatively small beer. That's what makes this beer so great I think, they've packed all the flavor and complexity of a ""big"" beer into one that only packs a moderate ABV punch."
"poured a near pitch black with a finger and half of cocoa colored head. sticky lacing was left all down the glass as the beer disappeared. smelled and tasted of light roasted malts, slight coffee, bittersweet chocolate and nuts. mouthfeel is silky smooth with a medium body and good carbonation. overall one of the best porters out there. everyone should experience this slice of heaven in a glass."
"Lots and lots goin' on, old school, new school, all of it good. Brain just hurts a bit trying to catalogue it..."
"O: exceeded expectations, ive got a bottle in the cellar for a few years down the road and cant wait to see how this puppy ages"
"Overall, just another run in the mill average porter... nothing more, nothing less. TOOOT TOOOT all aboard the Hype Train. Joke"
"It is a refreshing porter, but it did not provide enough smoothness to compliment the rich flavors."
"O:I've not had many porters yet. This was part of a sampler pack and turned out to an excellent surprise. I will probably be drinking this agian soon."
"O: Excellent Porter to measure others by. Another delightfull beer from Great Lakes."
"Overall this is a solid porter that I keep going back to over and over. Very much available in my area, and a fridge staple. Low ABV makes it great to have several on those cool fall PA evenings while sitting around the fire telling stories, or eating smores."
"O: A great porter. Some porters are borderline stouts but this one draws the line nicely. Not too heavy but still has all the great porter aspects. Not really smoky either like some porters which makes me happy."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I love Great Lakes, and I love Cleveland. That being said, I don't personally feel that this beer is the ""be all, end all"" within the style. It's really good, but I prefer Founders Porter even if this one is more true to style."
"As it warms, the bitterness does get a little more aggressive, but it's far from overpowering. Outstanding example of the style."
"O: I've been meaning to try this for awhile now after hearing nothing but good things about it and it doesn't disappoint. I'd recommend this to everyone"
"O- A good porter overall. Could have more depth and a fuller feel. Glad I tried, but wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"My go to as far as a regular porter or easier drinking sixer goes when I'm around the Ohio area to pick some up. Not my favorite beer ever, but absolutely top notch for the style."
"Overall, this is certainly one of the best porter available. When you can get this brew you should."
"D: if you can get your hands on it, get some. what american style porters should try and smell/taste/feel like."
"A dessert beer that stands up well as a beer. The flavor combinations of roasted coffee and chocolate remind one of a mocha without the overly sweet sense that many mochas have. When I think of dessert beers, I often think of beers that work well in ice cream floats or beers with a very fruity flavor. This doesn't fall into either of those categories and it seems to be in its own category."
"Pours dark and opaque. Strong roasted character in the nose, like coffee and dark chocolate. Taste is similarly bitter, good roasted malt taste, and some chipotle too (without the heat). Mouthfeel is good, a little too crisp for my liking but maybe I'm craving these flavors in a stout?? Overall this is delicious stuff, a great porter and my favorite to date."
"O: worth the money! Buy this and include it in a tasting as an example of a nice parade of flavors."
"O - Decent Porter, but taste doesn't live up to the smell."
"O - Really damn good porter, I'm not the hugest fan of the style but this and Deschuttes Black Butte really have given me a better appreciation for porters in general. Would definitely enjoy having this again!"
"This is from Great Lakes Brewing Co., and takes it's name from the infamous sunken freighter. I'm hoping I sampled a bad batch because this tasted like it was dredged up from the bottom of Lake Erie! Way too bitter and hopped up, foul aftertaste! It was not ""skunked", the aroma was what I expect from Porter. I can't even come up with a constructive criticism on this one!"
"O: Exceedingly drinkable, top class porter. I would love to have regular access to this."
"O: An awesome porter. IMO doesn't hold weight to Deschutes Black Butte but that's just my opinion. Easily the 3rd best porter I've had. Stands up to all the hype I've heard."
"Great Lakes, I cheers you regardless..glad to have this beer again, for it is a drinkable and tasty beer."
"O-If it was fresh my overall impression would be better fo sho. I do like this beer very much yet was not super impressed. Very glad to have tried it."
"Not quite pitch black, but almost. One finger of sturdy tan head, extra foamy in texture. No lacing left behind, however. Medium thick yet creamy in texture, no complaints about the body. Smells of roasted coffee and dark chocolate. To further elaborate, it smells of really *well* roasted coffee that hasn't been pushed all the way to burnt black, and really *good* dark baking chocolate. Taste follows the nose, but also includes a hopping note that comes across as almost a sort of light psuedo-woody and bark tone accent. Which actually fits quite well in line with everything else. I'm really impressed with this one! Easily one of the best American Porters I have ever tasted."
"O: Just awesome. For a porter this is hands down the best I've ever had. So completely drinkable and delicious. None of the overt sweetness that some porters have. Flavors are distinct. Really just flat out terrific."
"Overall: Thee is nothing negative to say about this beer at all. Other than the fact that I can not get it in my state. Just a great beer, and I would buy over and over again."
"Overall- I really liked this porter to be honest, I didn’t know what to really expect with such a high rating here on BA and the somewhat hype surrounding it, but I was pleasantly surprised. I think it really deserves its rating as it has a nice creamy medium mouth feel to it where other porters I have tried are much more watery. The aromas and tastes are spot on for a porter, the latter being very well balanced. Overall a very enjoyable porter and I will be searching this one out again, maybe pick up a six other than just a single bottle this time."
"This is a perfectly balanced beer, smooth, great tasting! One of my new favorites for sure!"
"World class porter in my book."
"wasnt excited to try this beer. Its readily available to me, and the only reason why I get to try it is because is was an extra. First off, solid brew. Have not been uber impressed with most of the GL brews, this one, makes me re think that opinion. For a porter, really robust flavor. Nice and bold, and easy to drink. Looks great in a glass, holds the taste very well, very easy to drink. This has made me re think how much I am impressed with GL beers."
"Overall, a good American porter. Solid roasted coffee and sweet malt flavors, but lacking a little in the aroma. A great porter for the price though. A real bargain."
"O--I'm not usually a porter guy, but this is one that I could really enjoy on a cold night...not that we get many of those in Miami. Very complex, but retains enough light body to be a real sessionable beer."
"Drinkability is king with Eddie Fitz. It's simple and delightful and I'd probably down a six pack myself if I didn't fear chastising from the girlfriend."
"Textbook porter - rich, hearty, flavorful, yet thin and smooth enough for easy drinking. Totally worth seeking out. Now if I could only get that damned Gordon Lightfoot song out of my head..."
"Overall: Very good porter one of the better ones I have had. Very well balanced flavor profile very nice subtle flavors and great drinkability"
"OD- I love porters, I especially love this one. I could drink it for days. Wonderfully balanced and, to put it simply, I will choose this over and over."
"Porters as a class continue to underwhelm me. I know this is at the top of the class for porters but I just don't get it. To me, porters are the red-headed stepchild of Imperial stouts. this is drinkable per se, but I sure won't miss this sixer when its gone."
"Fantastic American porter, probably the best, though I haven't tried them all, obviously. Went great with some mild bleu Kentucky Rose cheese from Kenny's Farmhouse Cheese (Austin, KY), which provided the requisite funk and creaminess."
"O - This GLBC brew is a very very good porter. It has great character as most GLBC brews do. I recommend this to anyone wanting a quality porter. I've turned friends from someone who hates a Porter to someone who asks for one every experience. Great brew."
"It would be nice if the alcohol content was a little higher but if nothing else, it keeps the cost down and makes this an affordable six pack that I think I will buy again."
"D - this is a luxorious porter. Very rich and extremely chocolaty. I really enjoy a coffee flavor in my porters, however the chocolates work really well. Awesome stuff, one of the best porters I have had."
"Overall: Very good porter, a little too much for my taste but still another classic product from GLBC"
"O: Really enjoyable porter. Pretty complex flavor profile from a beer ringing in at 5.8%. Don't know if it's the best I've had, but it's right up near the top. Skal."
"This is a very enjoyable porter that has a very nice malt profile, good smoothness, and very solid balance. Edmund Fitzgerald does what a good porter should do on every front, and the coffee-leaning taste profile is a special treat for a coffee appreciator like me. Well worth the purchase."
"O- It seems like everytime I have a Great Lakes brew I am blown away, and this certianly follows that train of thought. Awesome porter."
"O - I am very appreciative of this beer i received in a trade and glad i have four but will most likely not seek this one out for the future, im not the biggest fan of the style unless they are much bigger. i really wanted to see what all the fuss was about, can't elaborate, get over it, loss of words."
"Poured into my dfh snifter, pours a deep dark black/brown. Pretty much opaque, thin pour thickness, nice fluffy off white head and nice retention. Smell- milky mocha, some faint coffee grind. Taste- bittersweet chocolate, some bitter coffee flavors, a slight smokiness to the malt, overall just a really solid offering. Mouthfeel- nice tight carbonation that makes for a great finish. Drinkability- for a 5% beer, this has tremendous flavor and is just a really solid porter."
"O - Highly recommend this beer! Great Lakes knows how to brew a great porter!"
"O - delicious beer that I've loved again and again. Can't wait to down my next one!"
"A really great porter that any porter fan should try for sure. First time having it but I will seek this beer out again and again."
"O: I just can't understand the high ratings for such a mediocre Porter. This isn't the first time I've had this beer either. Very watery with almost artificial flavoring. On the plus side it is very easy drinking and probably a nice gateway beer."
"I'm not certain this is the best porter I've ever tried but it's definitely right up there with any of the others (top three for sure). The light body keeps it going down easy and the drying finish keeps you sipping. Well-balanced and flavourful; you can't expect much more out of a porter. This is the kind of beer I wish could always be in my fridge."
"Edit: Bumping the score up a bit after my second encounter with this beer. More smokey char and a really nice, balanced flavor. If this ever makes it to the Triangle, it could very well become a favorite."
"O- A very solid porter and just great. It says to serve at 55°F and I would really recommend drinking at that temperature. I did have it cold a few months ago and it was not nearly as good as it was warmed up."
"High;ly recommended for anyone who is in the look for a good peorter"
"O - While the beer is named after a ship that sunk in Lake Superior, this porter will never bottom out in my opinion. From now on, I'll head straight to those black 6 packs with their odd violet label anytime I feel like a remarkably solid showing, probably."
"A pretty porter with a little bit of a red glow to it. Head isn't very large and once it fades, not much remains save a thin patchy layer and a ring. Aroma is deep. Smokey, malty, and roasty with some hops sneaking out from underneath. Notes of caramel, cocoa and yes, cream. Taste is yummy. Smokey hickory, malty goodness, sweet caramel, and lightly bitter with some chocolate. Mouthfeel is solid. Medium body, good drinkability, nice level of carbonation. All around a quality porter that I foresee getting again."
"I'm not a big porter fan but this is phenomenal. It pours dark, as expected. And it smells of that chocolately coffee aroma. The taste and mouthful, though, is what sold it for me. It's a beer that doesn't taste like a beer. It has just the right amount of carbonation mixed with that dark, heavy and chocolate-coffee tastes. Top 5 beer for me for sure."
"This beer poured out as a dark brown color, not too much light getting through it either. The head was good looking, it was pretty thick with a tan color it it. The smell of the beer was roasted and musty. It's got a little fresh wood sweetness to it also. The taste of the beer was probably one of the better porters I've ever had. I was very impressed with the flavor for sure. The mouthfeel was smooth and had a medium body to it. Overall this was a very nice porter all around."
"O: an A porter. my first great lakes offering hopefully not my last."
"O - Easily one of the better porters I’ve had and is one Great Lakes better brews. Fantastic beer!"
"O: Really good, deserving as its status as one of the top American Porters. Nice chocolaty flavor with a bit of coffee. Great mouthfeel."
"Great porter, but I think I actually liked it from the CO2 better as it has an edgier character to it. Still, a great, great beer that you can sit and drink all night."
"O: Excellent porter, one of the best I have had for sure. Lots of flavor and really drinkable."
"A very easy drinking example of a porter. I wish this was available in CT."
"D - Outstanding. This beer carries a high rating for a reason, it is one of the finest porters to ever grace my palate. Highly recommended."
"O- This is the beer that got me into craft beer three years ago and it is still a fantastic beer. I can never go wrong ordering this one. Such a roasty and robust porter, really an outstanding porter."
"O – This is a very nice porter and a fine example of its class. It is very drinkable. Flavors really come out as it warms. Nice."
"O- this is awesome. Truly the best porter in the world."
"This is a good one!"
"Another review I wrote because I had nothing better to do. Okay. Here we go, maaaan: Tastes are bonfire smoke, strong American hops, marsh water/bogwater, old tobacco, pithy wateriness, beer-soaked pumpernickel bread, dark and kilned malts, charred wood, frozen fudge, herbs and sage insense."
"Overall this, Founders, and Bells porters are my favorites of the style. This beer goes down very easy, and is pretty refreshing even on a hot day. I could definitely put down a few of these in a session. One of the best of the style."
"Overall, an outstanding porter that really hits the spot even on this very hot Texas evening. Highly recommend and worthy of the hype. Had this a bunch when living up north and at beer fests so glad to finally get a 6 pack from my buddy Ummagum - many thanks! Rotation - after my move back to Indy (good fucking bye TX summers!!!!) this will have a home in the rotation for sure. [R;Y]"
"This is one of those beers that, after getting one in a trade, I'm going to be sad every time I walk by the beer shelf and don't see it."
"OVERALL: Average at best for the style. Not sure why this one gets all the great press. The bottle is within the best-before date, but perhaps this one has faded faster than the bottle dating machine thought it would. Something I’ll have to try again at some point in the future, but as it is now, this one is highly overrated."
"A very satisfying example of the style - quite different from my other favorites of the style, this is certainly their peer. A shame it isn't readily available out here."
"Overall-I have a bad track record with Porters. I don't like them for some reason, I consider them watered down stouts. I've been drinking this beer for not too long and i'm starting at the 1/3 full glass. Beautiful lacing left, and just delightful. This is a world class beer. So easy to drink, tasty and refreshing. I was going to give 4 of the beers out of the 6 pack to one of my friends who loves Porters, but I'm definitely only giving him one now."
"Overall - I'd say this is a very solid Porter overall. Actually one of my favorite of those I've tried so far, especially in that it's very drinkable and not overbearing, with just enough flavor and porter-ness to woo you. I could actually see myself drinking multiples of these in a session if I was just in the mood for something dark/roasty/complex, without the heavy chewy oomph of a stout or double/imperial stout. Very nice indeed. 4.0 out of 5.0."
"A solid beer. I bet I'd appreciate the second one more."
"O - This porter deserves all the hype it gets. Its a very good example of an American porter. The flavors are spot, the mouthfeel is amazing and its very drinkable. Thanks Jeff!"
"Overall: This is a pretty good porter, but I've had better, and it is far from my favorite from Great Lakes. Still, it is worth sampling and is refreshing on a hot day."
"This beer tastes veryyy similar to my favorite the Black Butte. A great beer and glad to know some people on the midwest have a comparable Porter!"
"O - Awesome beer. I have no complaints. One of my top 5 favorites. Definatly worth a shot."
" Overall one awesome American Porter.One of the best out there in my opinion.Everybody should try this beer atleast once."
"An amazing amazing beer. Even though I align myself with IPA's as a beer standard I would definitely get this again just for the sheer flavor."
"This is a super drinkable porter. Tops. Should make a pit-stop in Cleveland sometime to try it on tap."
"Overall: A very good brew. One of the best American porters out there."
"A very good Porter but not quite as robust as the Founders or Smuttynose offerings. I’ve been wanting to try this for years and glad to finally get a hold of some."
"O: Extremely drinkable beer. Overall, I liked this beer on tap a little better than out of the bottle."
"O - Wish I had many more of these porters. Excellent example of an American Porter."
"drinkability: above-average porter, consistent in taste and body, abv is adequate, and the underlying flavors complement rather than overpower, very drinkable."
"Overall I am a bit confused by this one. I have been told by many that this is the holy grail of Porters, but I have to disagree. It is a good porter but not at all a great Porter. Thanks to xanok for the extra."
"D-Above average porter but didn't blow me away like I was expecting. I was really psyched for this one. Maybe I need to set my standards a bit lower. For the price, this beer is a steal, but this is nowhere near as good as say....Smuttynose Robust Porter."
"Pours deep rich brown with some reddish highlights. One inch light brown head falls slowly. Minor lacing. Smells toasty, Chocolate, some coffee. Taste is Similar to nose. Chocolate, coffee, toasty a bit of caramel sweetness. A bit of bitterness on back end. mouthfeel is nice. Medium body, medium carbonation with nice level of activity and smoothness. Overall a real nice brew."
"O-My favorite porter(might be my favorite beer). At 5.8% abv many can be consumed. I like everything about this beer."
"so why the 4.5? the dryness just seems a little much."
"O: A delicious porter. A lot of interest in the flavor, just wish that the aromas could keep up with it. Without a doubt, I will buy it again."
"A well crafted, flavourful, and perfectly balanced porter. I have never really got in to this style, nor have I had many interpretations of it. This explains why my mark is lower than the average. I would love to revisit this in a year or so when I've had a chance to have had more American porters. For now, however, it's quite satisfying."
"O - This is a solid example of an American porter. The flavors are spot on and it is easy to consume. I just wish more breweries would brew porters just like this one."
"A tremendously good porter. So glad I can get a hold of these fairly easily. Bought a six-pack, so I can drink a couple, age a couple and see how that works, and maybe use a couple as extras on trades when I'm finally a grown-up member of this site."
"The nose offered faint tones of coffee beans and chocolate. The taste is wonderful. Rich chocolatey malty sweetness, then a nice earthy, woody flavor and a nice dry finish. This beer is a perfect example of a classic American porter."
"Overall, this is one of the better porters I've had. It's straightforward, yet very enjoyable."
"Cheers..."
"Pours a deep dark brown, with red mahogany highlights. A 2 finger head that turns into a fine thin coating over the top of the beer. Smells of deep rich roasted coffee, chocolates, roasted nuts, and toasted malts. Rich smoked wood flavor on the tongue mixed with chocolate and bitter coffee beans. Light to medium body, sweet and delicious, tastes like a dessert cake. Best porter I've ever tasted."
"Light mouthfeel that is very drinkable. Excellent Porter."
"O: One of the best, if not THE best, porters out there. True to style with a well-refined flavor profile. My second favorite GLB beer behind Eliot Ness. Despite the somewhat thin feel up front and through the middle, the roasty malts and chocolate finish really combine to make this beer absolutely outstanding. If you're a fan of porters/stouts, there's really no way you can go wrong with this one."
"Very grateful I got to try this beer though. Thanks again Isaac!"
"Overall: Great ""no frills"" beer. Pretty much the best of the style I have had with nothing added to it. All of the natural ingredients shine through and I am thoroughly impressed. I would make this a regular in my fridge if it were available in my area."
"O: Definitely needs to be served on the warmer side. Could use less carbonation as well. A very good average american porter."
"Overall is is damn good, pretty much the best porter I've ever had."
"O: Superb. Drinkable. 4.5"
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the balance between the sweetness and the smoky, roasty qualities. The nose was also huge, with all of the necessary aromatics making their presence abundantly clear. While the basis of this style focuses on the deeply roasted malts and those other dark flavors, this beer integrates a genuine smokiness to it, but does not allow itself to become overpowered. This remains exemplary for the style, while adding a uniqueness of flavoring."
"Well-balanced, and a really smooth, robust, and easy to drink porter."
"Quite dry for a porter. Tasty and well made. The astringent finish detracts a bit from the drinkability."
"Overall, I liked this porter. One of the better ones I have had. But for me, this still falls short of my favorite of all time, Founders."
"Pretty solid porter, not as impressive as i expected. Similar in flavor to Troegs reckoning but a lot better."
"Not that it needs to be said again, but this is an outstanding beer and easily one of the best examples of the style."
"O - Quite a delicious beer. I could have another in the same session for sure. This would be a great after dinner beer, or a meal all on it's own."
"D: Very nice. Tough to put back at dinner, but as i mentioned. the desert aspects were highly enjoyable."
"Overall-Incredible smooth. this is a world class porter but i poured it into a pint because this is as session-able as any beer out there. Simply amazing and it is the beer that got me in to craft beer."
"O - a very nice example of an American/robust porter; not the most robust as the malt is gentle and cushy; well done"
"Would be best in the winter months. Great with Steak."
"Overall this is a great porter with a big profile yet a rather modest ABV making it a perfect session brew. Very highly recommended."
"A vigorous pour yields 3 fingers of tan head, about the same color as the top of a cup of hot cocoa.  Beer is extremely dark brown, almost black.  Smells are coffee, some cocoa, a touch of smokiness and roasty malts.  Tastes pretty much like the nose, coffe, chocolate, a little smokiness, delicious.  Mouthfeel is heavy, a lot of body.  Drinkability is good.  Great beer, I'm very disappointed and surprised that Indy doesn't get Great Lakes but northern Indiana does.  "
"Overall I really like the sample from glbc, a very good example of a Porter. I could do a session on this one and not feel overly full."
"Pours a medium tan head that recedes pretty quickly and leaves some residual lacing around the glass as i sip. Held to the light, it shows some ruby red hues but for the most part is opaque dark brown. Smell is off coffee with some roasted nuts on the back end. Taste is similar to the smell with a bit of chocolate malt showing through as well. The roasted malts in this make a good appearance and some hop bitterness comes through to balance out each sip. Mouthfeel seems a little on the watery side and carbonation is in the medium range which makes it pretty enjoyable. Not the best i have had but it's up there."
"Very smooth and creamy on the palate. Flavor lingers for a long time. Something I didn't expect from a 5.8% beer. Pretty basic, but very enjoyable porter from Great Lakes."
"O: Excellent, very tasty and highly drinkable. It's definitely my favorite porter and probably in my top beers of all time."
"Overall, a very well-crafted porter - one of the best I've had."
"I've had this from the bottle and on tap and either way it's one of the best beers I've ever had. I especially love enjoying this beer with a good reuben or bag of chips. Great Lakes is always lacking on label design (not that it matters), but it's an amazing brewery and this is my favorite of their beers."
"Pours a dark black with the slightest edges being clear as the glass empties. Tastes slightly roasty with a chocolate and coffee like finish to it. Drinks down very smooth and you could probably put down a 12 pack of these no problem. Very nice porter."
"D: Definitely a top notch porter. Very balanced and complex. Easily could drink several of these. Seek this out"
"Overall-I throughly enjoyed this beer"
"Pours a pitch dark brown, two finger khaki colored head that fades in a minute to a thin layer, leaving rings of sparse lace. Smell: bakers chocolate, whiff of smoke, moderate roasted grain character, greenish earthy hopping. Taste: unsweet chocolate, caramelized sugar, roasty with a slight astringency, robust earthy hopping. Creamy feel, medium bodied. Nice porter. Best by 8/4/11."
"(12oz botte courtesy of Alpar!). Pours dark brown with tan head. Light carbonation bubbles. Aroma has load of chocolate, coffee, caramel, vanilla and some florals. Taste is roasty bitter with a sweet malt backbone. Thin bodied with a creamy texture. Bitter finish. Nice porter."
"O- This beer is dominanted by a silky smooth, creamy, sweet chocolate flavor. It is a very nice porter and I'll be back for more. It goes very well with bbq!"
"O - Now I finally understand why this one flies off the shelves around here. Drinks excellent with perfect balance and complexity between the coffee and chocolate tastes. Relatively low abv only increases the drinkability."
"Just grab some, and do not hesitate to grab a twelver as you will definately be drinking them in rapid succession !!! LOL"
"Overall very nice and drinkable beer."
"This was had from a bottle, and poured in to my Sam Adams Boston Lager glass. The appearance was dark, almost black. This porter had the smell of dark chocolate. The taste was just the way it smelled, dark chocolate, coffee flavors. This is a great porter. A smooth brew, some hops flavor at the end. This is my favorite porter so far."
"O: a really good porter to be sure. i thought everything was good overall."
"Bottle pours a black color with a tan head. Has a medium mouthfeel. Tastes like chocolate upfront, caramel/roasted malt sweetness, then finishes with chocolate that makes me want more and more. This brew really makes one wonder if it is really brewed with chocolate or not. Easily one of the best porters I've ever had."
"overall - A great porter. I recommend it to many."
"8.0/10"
"Pours a very dark but not opaque dark brown/crimson red with a small 1 inch tan head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Decent rings of lace on the drink down. Smells of roasted coffee beans, milk chocolate, roasted malt, and cinnamon. Absolutely amazing smells from this beer. Tastes of espresso, bittersweet chocolate, roasted malt, and cinnamon sticks. Very mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. Good carbonation with a slightly watery mouthfeel. Overall, a very good porter that I am happy I got to try. I would get this again in a heartbeat."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and slick, with a pleasant medium body and a smoky coffee finish that aids the drinkability as well. The beer lingers on the palate but isn't sticky or anything - it works great. Drinkability is fantastic due to the good balance of flavors and solid mouthfeel, along with the low abv. After being told this was 9$ a six-pack, I am stunned - this has to be one of the best deals there is."
"This is one damn fine beer, the first porter to compete with Anchor in my book. The beer pours with a tight small head and a hazy ruby color. The aroma is vanilla and mocha with strong chocolate notes. The aroma is simple but pungent and very effective. The flavor is at first roasty coffee with plenty of vanilla with some chocolate and some berries. This beer besides all of its vanilla and chocolate remains dry and the hop bitterness shines through very well. The texture is creamy and silky. Just a showboat of a session beer."
"Pours an amber reddish brown. A bit of nice off-white head that retains nicely. Smells very nicely of coffee and roastiness. A nice sweet backbone as well. Tastes roasty and very malty. Lot of caramel and sweetness as well blends nicely with a bit of bitter from the roast. Nice solid mouthfeel and very drinkable"
"O - The porter to end all porters. I am often disappointed by porters because I would simply prefer their beefier cousin, the stout, but there are few beers better than this. It smells and tastes amazing, and the feel for this style is spot on. Really quite brilliant. Drinks very easily, and is even better on draft at the taproom."
"Overall: One of the best porters I've had. Very hard not to down these in big gulps."
"D- This is regarded as one of the best porters out there and I am inclined to agree. Solid representation of the style, albeit on the hoppy end of the style. Definite recommendation."
"Really nice before a meal...especially nice after. Top notch."
"This beer looks outstanding: firm 1 inch+ light brown creamy head, very dark ruby brown body, with lacing sticking all over the glass. Pleasant, chocolate aroma. Taste wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be from the smell. Medium creamy, soft mouthfeel. Read the description on the bottle after my evaluation, and it certainly matches the taste: bittersweet, chocolate-coffee. I could drink a few of these."
"D: One of the most drinkable porters I have had the opportunity to imbibe. Excellent sessionability. A solid brew here...seek it out!"
"D- I could drink this great beer all night. This great of a smell and taste for a sessionable beer is hard to come by"
"The beer really goes down easy. It's not overly alcoholic so you don't have to stop at just one; and as easy as this is to drink, you wouldn't want to."
"As a retired sailor, the song brings tears to my eyes, but I loooovvvve drinking this beer. My aggro pour produced two thick foamy fingers' worth of deep-tan head with fantastic retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown with ruby highlights. Nose smelled like a milk chocolate bar or better yet, putting your nose into a tin of cocoa powder. Suddenly, I was transported into my late maternal grandmother's kitchen where she let me make my own chocolate milk as a kid. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, not quite creamy, but close. Bittersweet, not so much, but chocolate and coffee were definitely in evidence on the tongue. Jesus, I could drink this all day, especially when it's cold and damp out or the chill rain beats against the windows. If only they would begin CANning ... Finish had a smoky quality that reminded me of the burned out home in Montreal that we passed each day on our way to the Metro to go to Mondial de la Biere in 2002. Really smoky. Man, that song has me waxing maudlin. This is so good that I begin to wonder why I never reviewed it until now. Try some if you can get it!"
"Body and mouthfeel are pleasantly full and also perfectly carbonated. The flavors don't excel in any one shape or form, but this is just a great simple extremely drinkable and sessionable porter."
"D: Goes down pretty easily without too much lingering bitterness or roasted malt flavors. Overall this is a good--but not great--porter."
"I truly did not want to give straight 5's on this one, but every aspect of this beer is truly exceptional...it is far better than I remember it. I had hoped, at one point, to find a beer that I liked better than this one...I'll keep searching, but now doubt I'll ever find it."
"Serving type: 12oz bottle"
"T: Roasted malts, bittersweet coffee, brown sugar, a hint of hops and unsweetened baking chocolate. This is a fantastic porter. Without a doubt one of the best I've ever had and infinitely drinkable."
"Best porter I have had!"
"Overall: This was what you could call a ""session porter"" as annoying as I find the ""session"" term. Easy to drink, a good example of a porter, and for the one non-beer drinker we had, she liked it."
"Drink is quite good. For a porter, it's pretty spot on for style and flavor. For any beer in general, it's definitely a hit."
"One of Great Lakes' strongest beers, that's for sure. Really is one of the best parts about Ohio."
"Overall - It's been a couple years since I've had an Edmund Fitzgerald and I can honestly say I did not appreciate it enough. This is truly a remarkable beer, certainly the finest porter out there, and one of the great American beers. Cheers."
"One of my favorite GLB offerings and prob one of the better porters I have ever had. If you like porters this is an excellent choice."
"D- Overall this is a Nice Beer. Thought the 1st sip was too smokey but 3 or 4 sips in it all blended quite nicely. WOuld get this again or recommend it to someone for sure!"
"Pours dark, near black with dark brown edging. There's a fingers worth of creamy head. The nose offers espresso notes with some cocoa and a touch of smoke. The taste is very roasty up front with some coffee cocoa and smoke taste. Yummy stuff. The mouthfeel is pretty thick and creamy with a tight crisp carbonation. The drinkability on this one is high due to low ABV and a high quality taste."
"This beer pours dark brown to black woth only a small amount of light making its way through around the edges, there was no head to the pour, and the beer had lower than average carbonation. the smell was roasted and semi sweet very rich smell. the taste is full and roasty with a hint of coffee. the mouthfeel is medium body and undercarbed. this is a good beer and is pretty drinkable"
"Well worth the grades and reputation and worth seeking out."
"12 oz bottle my buddy found in his beer cellar. I gave the beer some slack on being slightly under-carbonated as it was a year old + in the bottle. Aside from that it was a quite enjoyable beer. Looks opaque and black. Little brown head. Both the mouthfeel and smell would be greatly enhanced with more carbonation. Aroma is chocolaty and sweet Tastes super malty, with a deep chocolate flavor. Remarkably smooth. This particular bottle reminds me of English beer, served slightly warmer and slightly less carbonated. Worked well as a desert beer. Great example of an American Porter."
"D: Best porter I've had, no question. Smell and mouthfeel iare amazing, and taste is right up there. Looking forward to drinking many more."
"Whats great about this beer is the taste pure and simple. Its exceptional with the hint of coffee and chocolate in the malty porter taste. Great Lakes really hit the nail on the head with the flavor of this beer. Its not overly bitter but instead has a complex taste that you will learn to crave."
"You want to try this beer!"
"Still very good drinkability and a good solid beer from Great Lakes."
"Another fine offering from Great Lakes..."
"Taste is very well balanced, light chocolate and caramel alon with a nice light hop bite on the finish rounds this out very well. Mouthfeel is rich an creamy. Very easy drinking afternoon beer."
"Notes: Great beer. Almost perfect. Deserving of its awards."
"Pours a deep black with a nice 1 finger tan frothy head. Smell is a great combo of light chocolate and breakfast blend type coffee. On tasting I am pleased with the smoothness of the mouthfeel, not weak like some porters, really bordering on more of what I find in stouts. Carbonation is readily apparent but doesn't become overbearing. Taste is exceptional. Perfect blend of the light chocolate and coffee roast present in aromas. Some biscuity goodness is there as well. This is a beer that solidly deserves it standing as one of the best representations of the porter style."
"D: I would drink this all night, but it's my only bottle. This beer is sooo awesome. I will now be looking for a clone recipe."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Easily drinkable because of its consistent taste. A little tang on the tongue that ties in perfectly. If the color purple could taste; it would taste like this."
"D: Not 'filling' as many stouts /strong porters can be, so drinkibility is very easy. Very delicious, and would pair great with a dessert, or by itself. Felt like it would be a great autumnal beer, but was great in winter too, and probably year-round."
"Pours a dark black with a one finger tan head. Nose is very bright with roasted malt and coffee auromas. Some bakers chocolate and smokiness. Taste is burnt malts upfront, bittersweet coffee and smokiness. Mouthfeel remains medium heavy, smooth and creamy. A well crafted ABV makes this a pretty drinkable beer for it's style."
"This is a very nice porter and one of the few good beer selections available in West Virginia."
"This is a very solid porter, but its a little bit sharp/astringent, I'm assuming from the roasted malts. Still, relatively drinkable, great aroma, and quite tasty."
"D - Any easy drinking porter! Nice one."
"Drink - I enjoyed this beer. Good flavor & tight."
"D - I'm not actually a huge fan of this beer. I bought a sixer of it a while back and never really felt like drinking another after having one. The finish just leaves too much bitterness for me and makes me want to brush my teeth."
"Drink- Damn! What a good little beer. Balanced, flavorful and was gone in a flash."
"Overall a very well done and easy drinking beer. I really enjoyed the balanced and smooth flavors. If this was a local I could definitely see myself drinking this quite often and I am glad I had the chance to try this."
"Don't really have all that much to add to the thousand some odd reviews that it already has. Great look to it. Looks exactly like a porter should look. Nice aroma. Great taste. I might drop it a bit on the mouthfeel. But, the drinkability is really good. Like I said, I don't have much to add to a long standing, well known porter like this one."
"I enthusiastically give two Schlitz for Edmund Fitzgerald Porter. This is the best thing coming out of Cleveland."
"Overall: great porter that's not too heavy and could probably drink a couple and not feel so full. Very well balanced."
"The CPJ"
"D - Superb drinkability, I've never been too keen on Porters until this beer. Probably as perfect as a Porter can get for me."
"D: This beer is dark enough to satisfy any malt craving, but cool and refreshing enough to drink in any weather. I'd love to have several of these while tailgating before a football game on a cool fall afternoon."
"Drinkability: It's good, maybe great, but not what I'd call outstanding. It doesn't give me an overly heavy feeling, which is good. It's a good representation of the style. It would be a great after-dinner beer to drink with a block of swiss cheese. I'd drink a couple of these."
"D-crazy drinkable. Had many on tap!"
"I haven't tried many porters, can't imagine any bettering this one."
"Conclusion: the memory of this beer will be favorable only because the Bears beat the Seahawks. This was more like a sessional porter. I easily drank a six-pack during the game. I would reach for this if I wanted a non-sipping porter."
"Taste kicks off with tons of nutty malt with a tinge of smokiness that balances nicely. Hops kick in at the end, and are not overwhelming, just a pleasant finish. Mouthfeel is thick and full overall making this a more drinkable beer."
"A good straightforward porter, although I'm not as impressed with it as others. The drinkibiliy is pretty good on this one and the balance is nice. Overall, a very solid beer."
"Overall just like last time I had this beer I ended up thinking about how great of porter this is. This brew had everytIhing I look for and want in a great porter. This beer has become a regular in my fridge and is one of my favorite porter. Great job GLBC."
"One damn fine Porter"
"Drinkability - -= This is a very well blended and balanced porter and am impressed with the way it's flavors are more prevalent as it warms up a little- very well made porter."
"Good flavor and extremely drinkable. If you have not had this, I suggest you do."
"Had this on tap from Stoney's in DC as well from 12oz bottles poured in a pint glass in the past. Pours a dark, roasty cedar brown color with fleeting glimpses of a ruby sheen. The aroma is a pleasant balance between chocolate and dark fruits. A rich, dark belgian chocolate base is softened by some juicy prune and sticky raisins. Medium bodied, lightly carbonated mouthfeel. The flavors are much drier than the aroma suggests, and the body may be a touch thinned by age. Dark, dry chocolate flavors with a bit of smoked ash coming through on the back end. More chocolate and a smidgen of prune linger in the final smack with a gentle kiss of minty hops."
"This is a really nice porter. It is a little bit lighter in terms of taste (though heavier in terms of MF) than the Payback porter I just reviewed, I think that on the whole I like it better. This is definitely a beer I would like to try on draft, and if I ever make it to the midwest I will go out of my way to do so."
"Great Lakes- Solid Work."
"Drinkability: This is a lower ABV beer with no overbearing flavors, so this has good drinkability. But I cannot get it in Utah."
"D- Not an an every day beer for me, but still real tasty"
"D - A highly drinkable porter with great depth and character. Plenty to keep me interested and a great, light ABV to boot."
"Drink - I really enjoyed this beer, it's got lot of flavour but it isn't too overpowering. I could actually drink a few of these over a night; it would make a decent session beer."
"Great Lakes nailed this one! If you can only pick one beer to represent the style, Edmund Fitzgerald is a no brainer. Recommended, it's perfect for someone new to the craft scene, or veterans."
"Drinkability silky, very well put together a tremendous example of a smoked porter."
"Note: * In reading other reviews and descriptions of the beer, this is probably molasses, but with very little molasses experience, it resembled aforementioned caramel and butterscotch."
"Chewy medium body that's on the fuller end with lots of silky chocolate and roasted malt flavor. Slightly acrid and overly roasty but their is a lactic cream presence that smooths things out. Hints of milk chocolate, oatmeal, licorice, hazelnut and subtle hops with a dry finish. Well balanced and very quaffable. We have a winner here."
"Poured from bottle into NB globe. Dark opaque brown with thin tan head, decent lacing and good retention. Smells of raw pale malt, light coffee, caramel, spicy European hops. Taste is lightly roasted malts, caramel, semi-sweet chocolate, just enough hop bitterness in the finish to balance. Medium bodied with a medium carbonation. I think porters are very drinkable and this one is up there with the best. Refreshing and flavorful."
"D: A great porter. Very drinkable for the style."
"D - very easy to drink. flavors arent overbearing but are complex enough to keep you interested. a yummy brew indeed"
"The low ABV and the smoothness make this a very drinkable brew and a very good sessions beer. In my opinion this is one of the best porters around. A must-have for every porter lover, highly recommended. One of my favorite Great Lakes brew."
"D: Quite high, very nice beer. I'll be having it again and again and again."
"Drinkability is good. This is a very nice porter, worthy of more. Yay 6 pack! :)"
"A bit watery, not too complex but it sure is simple, clean and tasty."
"Overall: Fantastic. This is what porters are supposed to be."
"I usually like a hop presence in Porters, but this does rich chocolate and coffee so well I hardly notice its absence. Very smooth and a rich treat, possibly for the times you don't need or want to pull out the high octane Stouts. I want to be able to buy this beer here."
"Pours into a brownish almost black body with a tan head. The carbonation is decent, while the retention and lacing are excellent. The smell is chocolate, coffee, toffee, caramel, and some hops. The taste is chocolate followed by some coffee, toffee and than some hops come into the taste with a hint of citrus and a nice roasted dark chocolate aftertaste. The bitterness and sweetness are very balanced. The creamy smooth taste of this medium to full body beer gives it a nice mouthfeel that makes you want to drink more than one. This is the best porter I have tasted and is highly recommended."
"D-This is a very good porter. Never seen this in the PNW so I was glad to have the opportunity to try it."
"Drinkability - This is a great Porter. One that I'm going to try again and again. Very easy to drink and very pleasing to the eyes and taste buds. Can't wait to pick this up again. A real excellent experience when sipping on a cold night. I believe I could set a few of these back without even batting an eye. Not filling.... just good all around."
"Pours jet black, tall tan head. Smells like mocha beer frappe. Tastes like a superb, rich stew of coffee beans and roasted malts. A smooth hop finish keeps the balance about perfect. Feel is great, drinkability high. This one doesn't even need broken down any more - it's an outstanding beer."
"D: Excellent beer, could have more than a few. Try this treat!"
"Drinkability: I would definitely request more after the first pint. This beer is easily one of the easiest drinking porters I've had."
"D: A standby when I'm in Ohio; I always make sure to have at least a pint of this when I'm in town, with six-packs nearly requisite during the winter months. Well deserving of its great reputation, and a must-try for all beer lovers."
"D- Very good, very drinkable. As the alcohol content is not high, this is easily a repeatable cool weather brew- when it's too warm for a heavy Imperial Stout, but too cool to NOT have something darker!"
"D- Very drinkable. On a cold night i could pound this back like nothing. Very tasty."
"Drinkability is excellent for this brew. Due to the ABV being relatively tame it has all the characteristics for a session beer. The taste is pretty inoffensive and allows for this beer to be easy to partake in."
"Drinkability - A very good beer. I have a soft things for porters and was excited to try this. This is not a letdown whatsoever. Glad I have a few to age and a few more to drink."
"What a spot on porter. I'm thinking this is an American one. Not strong enough in terms of alcohol or flavors to be any other kind. It is sessionable, which excites me for a Friday night. I'd like another one of these. I think I know the style enough to even grade this now."
"Can't help second guessing myself when I suggest this is ""almost"" perfect (on every point). Could it be just a little creamier please? Needlessly nitpicking at this point. I would by a sixer, nay, a CASE of this in a heartbeat."
"D: Right up there with Founders Porter & Anchor Porter (so far my top two porters by a fairly wide margin), and definitely one that I will pick up again. Thank goodness I can get this at my local Meijer!"
"Drinkability - A little on the thick side. It would go well with a hearty meal such as steak or ham."
"Overall- Great porter, is it really one of the best in the world... maybe. But the price point for a beer of this calliber is excellent. This beer does not dissapoint, especially for 9 bucks a six pack!"
"D: Very drinkable. This is a very solid porter but it doesn't overpower the tastebuds. This would leave me coming back for more."
"I wish this were sold where I live. This is probably the only porter I could ever find myself wanting to drink all night."
"D-- Easy to drink and a nice porter. Quite complex and well balanced. Easy to have two of these. A beer I would drink in the summer pretty easily."
"Special thanks out to spinrsx for the Great Lakes trade, you've made me a fan!"
"Drinkability: I found this to be a very drinkable porter. Great Lakes has some very good offerings, and this falls in their category of well-done, medium ABV, drinkable beers with some character."
"Delicious beer.  Fairly rich, but highly drinkable. I'd seek this out again."
"Dark with ruby highlights shining through. Nice tan head, faded away quickly, sticking to the glass. Mild aroma of carmel, roasted malt, chocolate. Aroma and taste got better after a few extra minutes of warming. Taste is smooth and exceptional. Not as thick and heavy as Founders but just as tasty. Roasted malt, chocolate, coffee and hops. Very carbonated and light on the tongue. High drinkability and tasty porter."
"I'm sure this is an excellent beer to people that like American Porters. I am not a fan of the Porter, but that said, this a very drinkable beer. It is quite bitter, and of course very dark, but it is very smooth and not to heavy. I would suggest this beer if you are a fan of the American Porter."
"The taste was a as robust as the smell indicated. It was somewhat bitter and smokey, but overall the sweet chocolatey malts balanced things out. It was medium bodied, creamy and maybe a bit too carbonated. Very drinkable, especially when you factor in the low ABV. Three thumbs up!"
"D - Good drinkability for the style. I don't generally session porters, but if I did, this would be a worthy candidate."
"I feel it would have been much better had they used a British hops like Fuggles instead of the American, probably Cascade. I personally prefer more maltyness in my porters and less bitterness."
"D: I could easily throw back several of these."
"D - Well, I'm almost done with this growler, and kind of wish i had more. Under 6% ABV, tasty, not too heavy. It's really fantastic. This beer stands the test of time. From the first time I sipped it to now, this remains one of my favorite beers and by being nearly perfect in every way, it holds up to every beer I've ever had."
"Served from bottle into Dogfish Head Signature glass. Poured basically black with a two finger tan head that subsides to one finger slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma is comprised of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and caramel. The flavor is of roasted malt, chocolate, caramel, and slight cream. It has a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this is just what I needed after a night filled with mediocre beer. This one is truly excellent. I really wasn't expecting much going into this one, but it definitely has surprised me. Nicely balanced flavor and aroma going on in this one. This is definite must try whether you are ticking the Top 100 or just want to try an excellent brew. You won't be disappointed."
"D: A really good beer, a great representation of porters. Not surprising from Great Lakes, in my experience they make all their beers really, really well. Definitely worth checking out."
"D- A nice porter, relatively easy to drink as well. Would get this one again."
"This is a heck of a porter. Helped my balance, too."
"This american porter has an excellent roasted aroma and chocolate start almost coffee finish taste. Very nice body to this porter. I wish it had a thicker head to it. The carbonation is makes for excellent mouth feel. I wish I could find this beer on draft in the Philadelphia area."
"Poured into a pint glass with a dark brown body with light brown edges when held to the light. Two finger frothy khaki-colored head that has very good retention and leaves good lacing on the glass. Smells of coffee, chocolate, molasses and some spice. Taste is a great balance of cream, coffee, chocolate, and brown sugar. Not overly sweet, bitter, or roasted, just right in every flavor. Light body due to medium to high carbonation but still something I can chew on. Great beer in every aspect, and it could go well with any meal or situation. Would have no trouble convincing myself to keep this on hand."
"This poured black with two fingers of brown head. This was more drinkable than the Gonzo, but it is a little less strong, so maybe plays into it a little bit. This is the coffee variety, as opposed to being more chocolaty. For a porter, this is very crisp and carbonated. When I toured The Great Lakes Brewery in 2008, the tour guide told me this was his favorite all-year-round beer. I don't know if this is my favorite beer, but I could easily drink this any time of the year. Great beer!"
"D: Exceptionally smooth and rich, but approachable enough to be a session beer. Truly world class."
"D - Would definitely have another."
"D - With the trend of American porters being hopped-up almost-stouts in disguise, this is a good example of that, especially with all the hops in the finish. That's fine if that's what you're looking for, but I like to see less roasting and sweeter/maltier tastes throughout with only enough hops for balance in my porters. Even so, I could drink two or three of these and be happy."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable indeed. A nice alternative to heavier beers when you aren't willing to sacrifice on flavor."
"Moderately thick on the tongue, but a clean aftertaste. This is a great drinking beer and an excellent expression of the American porter style."
"D: Good. Nice porter flavors and pretty easily drinkable."
"D - Exceptional! I could have a few of these."
"D- 5.8% makes it perfect for anything, such a lovely drinking experience! My favorite beer."
"D. Very drinkable. A buddy brought a couple sixers of this to a party recently - I'd almost forgotten what a wonderful beer this is."
"Almost-black in body with mammoth off-white head. Smells of coffee, light chocolate, raisins, tang, and slight molasses. Tastes of raisins, light chocolate, tang, prunes, coffee, and cola. Medium-bodied with light carbonation. A tasty, rather refreshing porter that is drinkable in any season."
"At just under 6%, I could drink this all night. A truly great beer."
"This is just a classic example of the style and you can never go wrong drinking some of these."
"D- This might be the best aspect of this beer. Low enough abv, great taste, nice and smooth. Would of liked the body to be a little more full, but this was the best porter I've had."
"It's a split decision whether it would go better with a rich German chocolate cake or a crock of braised short ribs; either way, this is one choice American Porter."
"This is one of my all time favorite beers. You may call me biased because I am from Cleveland, but Great Lakes Brewing Company is one of the best out there. They know how to brew amazing beers."
"O: A good straightforward porter, although I'm not as impressed with it as others. The drinkibiliy is pretty high on this one as the balance is perfect. It's not a session beer by any means, but it's as close as you'll come to sessioning a porter. Overall, a solid beer."
"Poured from the oottle into a pintglass a dark brown with a thick tan head that tried to stay around for the lenght of the beer but slowly faded to nice lacing. The smell is chocolate malt roasted barley and a hint off coffee. Taste is bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt, small hop presence but maintains an american porter taste. Mouthfeel is smooth not as creamy as some porters. This is a very drinkable beer very well balanced and very well crafted beer."
"Overall: Nothing I can say that hasn't already been said. Its the definitive American porter. Smooth, creamy, tasty and sessionable. Its a little beer with a big personality that gives its bigger stout and imperial porter brothers a run for their money in the flavour department."
"D - This is so drinkable, that it is slam-able. About as easy drinking as it gets."
"Maybe the best porter I've ever had. Man do I wish I could get this regularly."
"This is a beer that I liked more as I was drinking it and appreciating its subtlety. I also dig the very creamy mouthfeel, and highly drinkable. Maybe even a sessionable porter!"
"Drinkability: Best porter I've ever had. The brewmaster who put this together is a demi-god of brewing."
"Without a doubt the best porter I've ever had; it's a shame I have only one left."
"D - Drinkability is good on this brew with lower ABV that is manageable and good flavors. I can see how the smokiness might tire out the taste buds though."
"Overall a great porter from GLBC will definitly make it part of the rotation for this winter."
"D/O- One delicious beer. I don't know how many of these I'd want in one sitting but I'll tell you what, if there was a Eddie Fitz only brewfest I would be in heaven...so whatever that means. GLBC is sooo underrated."
"very high. Best Porter I've had IMO. Alcohol isn't TOO high and with a great taste and availability, I'll definitely be trying this again."
"D - A very easy to drink beer and could easily be a gateway into the more robust beers and styles. A great flavor and light feel has me drinking this beer a bit faster than I have anticipated and it's a good thing that Great Lakes delivers these in 6-packs as this could easily be drank for an entire evening. Fantastic."
"On tap at City Tap House. Pours a dark brown color with a caramel colored head. Has an great aroma of light roast. Has a sweet roasty taste with gentle bitters. Thin to medium mouthfeel. Excellent Porter. I will look forward to having this one again."
"D: Very good porter, totally solid. I'm glad it's so easily available here. Can be savored slow or had in numbers as well. Great."
"D: Goes down great. The flavor alone will have you coming back for more. This is a fantastic Porter! I will defiantly be buying more of this regularly."
"D-Wow, revisiting Edmund was a great idea. I've had it in bottles countless times and on-tap (think it had been on-tap a little too long)once but all those times never really impressed me that much. This time it was like a totally different beer: complex, easy to drink, and just downright enjoyable."
"Overall: A very solid beer. I will defiantly be revisiting this one."
"Poured a deep, dark black color with a thick brown head and generous lacing. Smells of vanilla, roasted malts, chocolate, and a twist of coffee. Tastes of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, caramel, vanilla and general goodness. Mouthfeel is very thick and nice. Drinkability is fantastic."
"D. I find this to be a very average Porter. I wouldn't like another after this one. That flavor of burnt grains or burnt coffee just isn't doing it for me."
"D: One of the best porters I've had, but I dare say that I still think that Black Butte Porter has an edge over this one. I know the line between stouts and porters is almost nonexistent, but this tastes more like a weak stout while BBP has more of that fruity, spicy character. This is still a wonderful beer, semantics aside. I wish I had more to drink."
"Overall, one of the best porters I've ever had, if not the best. A really great offering that I wish was available around here."
"pours a black as night color with a 2 finger tan/cherry head,beige sticky lacing clings to the glass..smell is coffee ,roasted malts, toffee toasted bread,some citrus hops ..taste is coffee and brown sugar , mix that with some hops and roasted malts .throw in some spice ,nutmeg and some toast and you have a nice porter..mouth feel is silky smooth,creamy has lots of roasted flavors with good carbonation..drinkability is great its a silky smooth porter"
"This is, in my humble opinion, the porter by which all other American porters should be judged. It's that good, and it's a perfect representation of the style. And at such a great price point (on sale here for $7.50 for 6) what more could you want?"
"D- A very easy to drink stout, and full of flavor at the same time. Balanced almost too perfection. I love this stout and found it to be an acquired taste. I don't see how anybody could be offended by a finely crafted beer like this."
"D - Great tasting beers are easy to drink. This is no exception. One of the better porters I've had in every category."
"This is my first official review, as previously stated this is also my favorite beer. If it's a little off, sorry, only practice will make it better right?"
"D: My go to... what can I say this is an A+ beer for me."
"Drinking Edmund Fitzgerald might have ruined me for all other porters."
"Super drinkable and a wonderful example of the style. This is a beer that I had been hearing great things about for quite some time but had never tried, and I am sure I will be getting a lot more of it from now on."
"The beer pours a partially transparent dark brown with twinges of red shining through. A super light tan half finger of foam. Smell is of good coffee grounds most heavily. Other aromas include oak and faint burnt cocoa notes. Caramel and Butterscotch notes also entertain the nostrils. The taste is of weak coffee, char and caramel. In spite of the burnt notes that are apparent throughout there is a subtle sweetness that comes from the caramel notes and turns out to be quite pleasant. The feel of this beer is a bit watery for my liking. It's not really all that bad, but it feels with the flavors that it should be a little more viscous. The carbonation is pretty good. None of those factors hurt the drinkability which is pretty nice. It's a very solid porter."
"Bottom line is this is the best porter I've had by a mile. The fact this has that much flavor and isn't an imperial is just amazing. Those loving the Weihephaner hefe for having flavor of low alcohol well rejoice as this beer puts that one to shame!"
"Good taste and good mouthfeel make this a solid choice to sit and sip on at the end of the day."
"good beer"
"D. Drinkable. This is what you expect a Porter to be. Super smooth, but very flavorful. I like my Porters and this is probably one of the best."
"Drinkability is better than average, but not great. I'm not really sure why this beer gets so much love. Founders Porter blows this one out of the water as does Sierra Nevada's offering. Too bitter and thin with a faint (yet noticeable) metallic taste. Maybe this is just a bad bottle. If the second bottle I have is different I'll re-review. Not a bad beer by any means, but not all that great."
"D - If I ever need a porter and it around it will probably end up in my fridge more often now. Overall exceptional brew."
"Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald tastes like a caramel mocha cappuccino. It is only slightly sweet with rich coffee flavors, some acidity from the roasted malts, and a healthy dose of bitterness that made this as well balanced as it was delicious. I don't think one could do much better than this beer, although if there is a fault, I would've liked a bit more caramel and chocolate making it more dessert-like"
"Spot on for an American Porter; I would love to pair EF with a full slab of dry Memphis ribs."
"D- EF is as drinkable as it gets for a stout. Massive flavor, but reasonable taste makes it incredibly drinkable. There is full reason for the brew to get the reviews it does."
"D: Excellent drinkability. This is tasty, complex, and the alcohol is completely hidden. I would drink this again and again. A very nice alternative to a stouts that get so much hype."
"The finish brings out some bitter flavors, mainly from balancing hops and the bittersweet roasted malts."
"Drink well my friends"
"D-gets slightly more bitter as the drink goes on, the taste stays so its great all the way through!"
"Pours a very dark brown, clear when held to the light, ruby highlights, one finger of head. Nose carries bittersweet note of malt, fruity hops, a stout-like aroma. Sweet malty start morphs quickly to bittersweet chocolate. Finish is coffee-like in bitterness with a hint of tart/fruity sweetness in the aftertaste... apples, I do believe. Thick, chewy mouthfeel. Surprised by lower ABV... Carries all the sensory effects of a weightier brew, except the alcohol content."
"This is the best porter I've had, bar none. I would recommend this to any beer lover."
"D: One of the best beers I have ever had, easy. The only thing keeping me from having another is because this is such a thick beer that is best savored. Could imagine it with a roast, BBQ, dessert, or as dessert."
"D: Tasty, phenomenal balance, easy to drink and goes down too fast."
"A: A hard pour down the center of the glass results in a solid half inch of head with some serious retention, head is also thick and clings to the side of the glass, color is dark brown with deep crimson - 4.75, S: Initial whiff is loaded with lots of powdered chocolate and cacao, some tootsie roll and latte smells are also evident along with a dark fruit sweetness, hint of coffee in the depths of the nose, very nice aroma -4.50, T: Flavor is heavy on the charring, lots of specialty grains including chocolate malts and black patent, flavor favors the dry side rather than the sweet side of the spectrum, lots of roasted grains, there is also a nice citrus hop bite present - 4.50, M: Medium to heavy bodied, slight grittiness on the tongue - 4.00, D: An extremely drinkable Porter, excellent example of the style - 4.50"
"very drinkable and and a fantastic example of the style. certainly lives up to it's reputation which is rare imo. worth seeking out."
"D: A very pleasant and drinkable beer--loads of malty goodness"
"D - Drinkability on this one is superb. A very easy drinking porter that I look forward to session in the upcoming months."
"Probably the best porter I have had till date. Honestly, I have found this style to be a little disappointing but this one is very good!"
"Dark black brew allows only a glimmer of light through when held to a light. It generates a nice 1"" of creamy light raw umber head that leaves a thick layer of lace on the glass as it settles. Nose is a nice mix of peat, smoke, molasses, dry and sweet at the same time. Mouthfeel is moderate-heavy bodied with a crisp carbonation that cuts through to keep it from being overly thick, but it is maybe a bit too fizzy. Taste follows directly from the smell and adds a good dose of starchy raw grain, kinda like chewing on uncooked oatmeal (I mean that in a good way). Tasty and drinkable, a great porter."
"D - I enjoyed it. It would be a nice winter beer."
"EDIT - I've come to view the thinner body as a plus rather than a minus. I miss being able to get this regularly. I will always drink this while in the Midwest."
"D--This is one of the best examples you will ever get in terms of a straight up American Porter. Great flavor and balance. A must try if you enjoy the style..."
"O: Solid beer, but not exceptional. Pretty typical experience for me with Great Lakes."
"Molasses up front barely sweet but extremely smooth - nice carbonation hits in the back, then finnishes slightly bitter, with coffee notes. Very nice."
"a sessionable delicious porter. could drink many of these over the course of a night. my favorite porter to date."
"The aroma is mild and slightly sweet with clear roasted malt and chocolate notes. Flavor continues the nose with a stronger roasted malt character, nuttiness, sweet bread and a touch of sourness. Carbonation is high, helping to lighten the beer overall. This is a well rounded mild porter, quite easy to drink."
"Wow. I have never had a porter like this!"
"Overall this is a very nice porter. A very under-appreciated style."
"D: delicious and smooth. not sure how many i would want to drink in 1 night but not absurdly heavy for a porter, very drinkable"
"Drinkabilty - On top of being one of the best of porters, and being avabile to me rather easy, this is almost always in my fridge. Near perfect, might be overall the best brewed beer from great lakes, if you like porters, you must try this"
"D: This is a fantastic porter. I am a fan. If Sam Smith's Taddy Porter is the prototype, this is a good imitator."
"Overall this is an awesome beer. Just wish it was more available. If you like Samuel Smith's Taddy porter. You will love this."
"Cheers..."
"D-smooth and easy to drink for sure one I could drink several in a night."
"D-Overall a great beer that I would definitely buy again."
"As far as porters go, this is top notch. I'm very impressed by the drinkability here."
"A really robust and smooth porter. A pretty much perfect example of the style."
"Overall: Great Lakes strikes again. This might head the list."
"The Catalyst,in Santa Criuz had Anchor Porter on tap before you could find it in bottles. I had many pints there. Out west, Black Butte was awesome Porter, and now, back to the midwest, there's Edmund Fitzgerald."
"Overall drinkability is good, I can easily down two of these in a sitting, maybe three or four if I can mix things up a bit in between."
"Overall I found this more enjoyable than another acclaimed porter of the English variety, Samuel Smiths Taddy. It will take an exceptional brew to prevent this from becoming my benchmark for the style."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. The color is a deep brown with a nice reddish color when held to the light. A finger and a half of light brown head with some nice lacing. The smell is a nice malty flavor that peaks your interest. The taste is a nice roasted, smooth malt flavor with some slight chocolate milk flavor. A slight coffee flavor hides in the background and can be noticed after every sip of this wonderful porter. The feel of the beer is really smooth. It goes down with a little alcohol bite. It has a nice drinkable feel and goes down well."
"DB- Smooth, easily gulped porter. Flavor is spot on for where I see this style at this point. Roast malt here is especially splendid."
"Pretty nice porter. I was expecting alot more from it after seeing it's high ranking and I was a little disappointed. Mouthfeel was to bubbly and thin and a little watery."
"D- Very drinkable, I wouldn't mind having a sixer over a relaxing night."
"Drinkabillity: tasty, and more than the sum of its parts. Very much enjoying this beer."
"This beer is a great example of a beer that is delicate and subtle in its tastes and doesn't rely on punching you in the face with massive amounts of flavors. Not that doing that is bad, it's just nice to have a balanced"
"D - Extremely drinkable. This is a very well balanced beer and the low ABV makes it extremely easy to get through several bottles."
"Overall: This is one of those rare beers that defines the style. Awesome and then some!"
"Pours a clear, dark brown/amber color. 5/4 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, alcohol, vanilla, dark citrus, and slight hops. Fits the style of an American Porter. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Strong bitterness and sweetness qualities are well balanced. Tastes of roasted malt, slight coffee, hops, slight dark citrus, slight alcohol, and slight vanilla. Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, blend, and complexity."
"D: Goes down wonderfully for the style. I couldn't ask for a more drinkable smoked porter."
"The dryness is a really nice experience, continuing the pleasant ride that the smooth, medium body delivers. The taste, the body, the wash and the low ABV all make for a beer that you want to come back to. My nonic drained rather effortlessly. Once again, the hype about Great Lakes' beers seems well-deserved."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by roasted malts. Taste is of coffee, malts, maybe a hint of chocolate, slight bitterness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a good quality brew."
"D: Very nice, I could easily drink a few of these in a row. The alcohol isn't necessarily hidden, you can defiantly feel it, it's subtle."
"D - Very drinkable... i wish i bought more of this as it's not something distributed to ct.. but glad i tried and would strongly encourage anyone to buy this..."
"Notes: I had an extremely high expectation for this porter and it surpassed every expectation I had. An extremely drinkable beer, very heavy so your not going to drink a lot of them at one time. A great dessert beer."
"I don't know if it's just a phase but i was really into porters is a wee lad, and then moved on, the sweetness was crushed by the west coast ipa invasion. But, on that note, this is some tasty stuff. I've had this for some time, but drinking it before the pull date, but just couldn't pull the trigger on a porter night, i'm glad i did. Deep dark pour, great nose with deep roasted malts. Taste was a nice coffee/ chocolate balance throughout to the finish. Very light mouthfeel, but very drinkable. Good stuff."
"I still recommend the Dick's Lava Rock Porter as my all time fave."
"All in all, I wasn't impressed. However, maybe it's just my inexperienced palate."
"D- Perfect, but dangerous for the mere fact that because it is perfect I could drink this all day long."
"Drinkability: Hands down my favorite porter and for a long time, it was my favorite beer. This is a world class porter and I will be putting it back on regular rotation."
"d- not sure that i could drink more than one of these in a sitting, but it's not this beer, i think it's porters in general."
"D: Wow. After having tried Founders offering as well, I don't know which is better, but a side to side tasting is probably in order."
"Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter pours a mere disk of creamy foam over a deep dark brew. The nose is pleasantly sweet with a definite note of liquorice. Up front the flavor is toasty dark malts, the barest note of fruit and the liquorice again, balanced with subdued herbal hops. Mouthfeel is light, crisp, and semidry. Altogether, a super drinkable brew- sure, it's not as asserive as a lot of American style Porters or as heavy and malty as the English- but everything about it encourges another sip."
"Drinkability -- I've been disappointed with Great Lakes before, but this one is quite good. a great, easy-drinking, (nearly) sessionable porter. If you're looking for big roast flavors without a high abv, you could do a lot worse than this."
"D: Very nice porter and easy to drink. Generally well balance, although I thought there was a touch too much bitterness come through from the coffee towards the end. Still, I had no problem drinking this one and would enjoy another if available."
"D: Robust in flavor yet low bodied. Just as a porter should be. Overall a delicious beer and the best porter I've had."
"Black colored beer with a rapidly fading tan creamy head.Aroma is chocolate.Taste is chocolate malts,smoked malts,coffee and sweet cream.A very good beer that is flavorful and drinkable.Good from first to last sip.I would recommend and purchase again."
"D- great porter, super flavorful and really easy to drink. Paired wonderfully with a nice bowl of chili."
"Great Lakes is a brewery for whom I have established a high estimation. Now that it is available to us here in the East, this is a factor that will improve the beer drinking quality to all who know of it. Now, let us drink a toast to the brave souls who sleep within the rusted hulk of the Edmund Fitxgerald. Hit it Gordon...."
"Pours a dark coffee color with a mocha bubbly head that soon dies to about 2 mm. Aroma was there, a mix of roast, sweet mocha, and malts. Taste had a slight maltiness and sweet mocha/cocoa to it, overcome with a roast bitterness at the end. Excellent body, probably the best of all the porters i've had so far. Not too thin or too thick, a perfect balance. Not too strong in any category, so you could have one or two of these anytime."
"I wish this was available in New England. A well crafted brew that shows not everything has to be bigger and bolder to be better."
"Nice thickness for 5.8%, carbonation is good. Very drinkable, light and flavorful. I've had many porters that were too watery, or that were over the top. This avoids those pitfalls completely, a very stellar example of a porter done right."
"Man...this is easily one of the easiest drinking, most flavorful porter on the market. The complexity and flavors borderlines on double stout levels...highly recommended and well worth any hype it receives."
"D: Excellent beer. Very drinkable. Goes down easily despite the richness."
"D - Fantastic. Readily available nearby, and in my rotation. Hats off to Ohio, they actually did something right. ;-) :p"
"Notes: This is pretty much my go to American Porter. Great Lakes for the win."
"Received this one as an extra in a somewhat recent trade. After hearing so much about Great Lakes over the years, this was my first opportunity to try one of their beers. Pours a nice mahogany color, with a pretty nice caramel colored head. Roasted malt, coffee, bitter cocoa and a somewhat dry finish."
"Notes: I really can't think of any reasonable complaints or criticisms...Really awesome beer and extremely drinkable. I need to trade for this one in the near future. Thanks again Ryan!"
"M/D: the mouthfeel is good, if not a bit on the light side. The drinkability is decent, but I would rather drink just one of these with a meal or desert and switch to something else."
"D - I must admit this was my least favorite Great Lakes Brew when I lived in Cleveland and drank it regularly, but now that I don't get to enjoy it often I have gained a much deeper appreciation for it. It really is rather complex and super tasty, a beer everyone should enjoy at one time or another!"
"Tastes even better than it smells. This really is a wonderful porter. Bitter cocoa, coffee and roasted malts. Also has a nice sweetness to it. This is one highly drinkable beers, hard to put down and just sip on."
"This one pours a deep, dark brown/mahogany, with as big a head as you want to create. Head retention is decent, and lacing is good. The taste is pure porter - toasted grains and chocolate malts. It finishes creamy and chocolatey. As I have drank 12 of these alone in one night (poor turnout of lesser men at the party), I have to say the drinkability is high."
"Overall - a pretty good porter, a slight flaw in the taste, but otherwise a great beer for causal drinking, I'm quite happy with it."
"Bottle courtesy of jprime. Slightly reddish brown pour with a thin veil of foam. Aroma is quite hoppy, smells like an american barleywine. Hops, molasses and rich malts. Taste is quite sweet, old hops, and more molasses. Palate is thin and sticky almost no carbonation. Somewhat disapointing."
"It is too bad I can not get this beer here locally or else I would buy this pretty constantly. Definitely one of the best porters that I have tried and I would recommend everyone to try this beer."
"I greatly enjoyed this beer and wish I had another. It went great with breakfast!"
"This is good stuff! I will definitely purchase it again in the future."
"D - A great blended brew in my book. One of the better porters that I have had so I highly recommend this brew. I am glad that Great Lakes finally came to Minnesota and started out with this as one of their brews. I will purchase this brew again!"
"Love this beer, this 6 pack was my first sampling of it and i was greatly impressed with the taste and the aroma. i HIGHLY recommend this beer to anyone looking for a dark porter to enjoy. 2 thumbs up!"
"One of my favorites out there, and among my top two or three favorites in this style. Highly drinkable, you'll almost always find one in my fridge. And its from my hometown- what more can you ask for!"
"Recommended!"
"Poured deep brown to black. Foamy tan head that dissipated quickly. Thin lacings that don't last. Sweet chocoalty aroma with hints of toasted malt and coffee. Smooth, velvety mouth feel. Sweet dark malty taste in the beginning followed by chocolate flavors and finishing with a hint of coffee. Very drinkable."
"While I am a big fan of imperial porters, regular porter has never been my favorite style but if Edmund Fitzgerald could be found nearby that would change. It's worth the extra effort (read shipping charges) to obtain."
"D - easily drinkable, but the lightness of the flavor would probably make me grab something else."
"Incredibly easy to drink with excellent balance between being smooth and syrupy this is an amazing medium-bodied beer. Really really tasty! Will DEFINITELY be drinking more of this!"
"Quite drinkable, although not something i would attempt sessioning. Then again i might feel differently come fall or winter. Paired nicely with the aged gouda and crackers. Will enjoy revisiting this tasty porter. Worthy of its reputaiton."
"Overall, I wish like hell I had access to this all the time. Would be a perfect fall/winter time session porter."
"Intermediate carbonation combined with a slightly too-thin body doesn't quite reach optimal fullness, which is literally my only complaint with this excellent beer. A light coffee aftertaste lingers for a bit and makes me keep coming back. My first beer from Great Lakes has set the bar high. This outstanding offering almost tops Founders Porter as best of the style in my book."
"Thanks to Dennis for bringing one down for me to try during our Mexican dinner with Tengwall."
"D- Really enjoy this beer, is what i will most likely compare all porters to for now on, not my favorite style but definitely my favorite of the style that i have had so far"
"My choice: try the Gordon Lightfoot story song-inspired brew (trust me, it was inspired more by that Canadian siren's sonorous elegy (yes, men can be sirens too...equal rights and all...) than the namesake ship and its misfortune) from a bottle or from the tap. Well, I'm enjoying the CK today, so draught it is. It pours a clear dark garnet-brown with about a finger-and-a-half of foamy ecru head, which takes a while to completely die out, leaving decent alcing behind as it does so. The nose is coffee, molasses, bitter dark chocolate, dark malts, and a light breeze of hops. The taste sees a return of the coffee, bitter chocolate (this time in powder form), and the hops, heavy on the floral notes. What's new is a small appearance from a light maple syrup. The body is medium, tending toward the lighter end but not committing, with a lightly moderate carbonation and an ever-so-slight mouth coating. Not a bad porter in any respect, but nothing really that special, either."
"So drinkable, now I understand why the liquor stores are always sold out."
"I know my description could be applied to many beers of this style, but this is better than almost any porter I've had. All the flavours blend together perfectly. I find some porters just have less flavour than stouts for whatever reason, but this one seems to have all the flavour without as thick of a body."
"Great Lakes is certainly one of my most adored breweries, period."
"This is a model porter. It is distinguished by its robust malts and its chocolate/coffee flavors, but nothing is so big that its out of balance. I could drink this all night. I have had this beer at least a dozen times, and this is the first time I've sat down to reflect a little and write about it. Glad to finally confirm that one of my hometown craft brews is indeed a winner. Very glad."
"thanks to my cousin Ryan for smuggling this back from KY."
"D: This beer has an excellent level of drinkability; I could easily have more than one of these in a sitting."
"Well done."
"Description doesn't tell the story of just how subtle, balanced and tasty this is. Recipe is from before the hops boom, so don't look for Storm King orange bite, but better for it. Definition of great American porter."
"D: I'm enjoying this one. It's a standout porter; highly recommended for the style."
"The flavor also has roasted coffee and chocolate, there is also a light amount of hop bitterness. There is some sweetness, and some bitterness which balance each other out nicely. Medium bodied, properly carbonated, and a bit of a sweet aftertaste. Nicely drinkable, and well made."
"really good drinkability, i could pound a sixer of these in a night, no problem. i will definatly be revisiting this one really soon and suggest you do the same. very rich and flavorful. anyway you look at it, you cant go wrong with great lakes."
"D- This is a drinkable porter. To be honest I do not see why this is such a highly rated porter or beer in general. It is not the most well made porter like I have heard others say. Oh well to each their own. Couple of these and I would switch to something else."
"Overall, one of my favorite porters and I will miss it when I move out west in the fall. A great example of the style."
"Mouthfeel is supremely good, full, creamy, carbonation soft. Dangerously smooth. Drinkability is extremely high and the relatively low alcohol level is very welcome!"
"D: Good ABV, a beer that is quite good that needs proper time to warm to be fully enjoyed. Good price as well, a porter I would love to come back to."
"D= Great brew. Excellent Porter but doesn't quite live up to the Black Butte porter. Prolly my second favorite porter to date and I may come back to it time and time again when the Black Butte gets boring. Worth seeking out."
"Overall, a classic porter that's more English than American, BUT, it does those roast-y malt flavors found classics such as Fuller's London Porter REALLY well. And the sentimental value can't hurt either."
"overall: thanks to BitterPoetMadMan on youtube check out his beer revews for sending this my way! well crafted exactly to style guidelines a great beer I want another one or 20 but sadly I only have this one."
"This is truly a great porter. Superior to many pricier and higher ABV brews."
"D- A good beer that lacks a little flavor but goes down well. Can be a little overpowering after more than two. Decent all around."
"I was really impressed by this beer. Big time roasted and smoky flavors but enough sweetness to give it some balance. Lots of flavor for a below 6% beer, very impressed. Highly recommended."
"Overall, I was really hoping for a WOW and I didn't get it with this one. Really good beer....yes but not a WOW for me. Darn."
"Drinkability: Very smooth, easy to drink Porter that does everything right. That said, by playing it safe, it does not quite hit the stratosphere."
"M & D: Dry, and medium bodied, yet has a velvety mouthfeel that makes this porter unique. It's clean, but very flavorful and easy to drink. It's worth trying, and is very sessionable for the style. No matter what the temperature is, I could drink this all year long."
"This is a good porter, not my favorite, but I wouldn't hesitate to buy again."
"Extremely easy to drink. This is one well-balanced and tasty beer; I could drink it all night."
"Drinkability is pretty good. It goes down smooth, and is tasty. A good session porter. Not as complex as others I've had but all around a great brew that's certainly worth a try. I will be having this again."
"Great porter. Good balance between the sweet malt and the hops. Great Lakes did a phenomenal job with this one."
"This beer pours almost pitch black. I held it up to the light and saw a bit of redness. The head is big and fluffy and recedes to a quarter inch fairly quickly. The smell is of roasted malts and chocolate. This beer tastes great. I love the coffee and chocolate flavors which blend with the roasted malts to create an almost ideal porter taste. I thought that there was good mouth feel, and good carbonation, but I thought it could have been just a little more full bodied (maybe I'm just being a bit picky). Good drinkability as well. Great example of a porter."
"This is very drinkable and very solid. This is what a Porter should taste like!"
"I had tried this porter several years back and was not impressed. I'm vey glad I tried it again. Will drink it much more."
"This is one of the best American Porters I've ever had. It definitely belongs in the Top 10 for the style. Highly drinkable."
"D: Good after dinner drink. Not too rich to make you feel full. Nice substitute for coffee. Pretty high on my list of porters."
"This is an awesome beer. Worthy of the hype and awards? Maybe, but I'll have to revisit after exploring some more porters."
"Basically I felt that this brew was good but overrated. Highly recommend."
"Been wanting to try this one for a while now and it didn't disappoint. Highly recommended."
"It has a tingly, vegetable taste. Smooth. Bubbly. It's a porter version of the burning river. Great for the winter time."
"All in all this is a nice porter and one that I will come back to for the excellent flavor and low price. I gave a lower mouth feel, primarily because I would have liked the porter to be a bit thicker bodied. Definitely worth buying if you like porters."
"This is easily my favorite porter. Good go too beer."
"The drinkability on this porter is exceptional. One of the best porters out there. I could drink this beer for breakfast."
"D - tasty, easy to drink, low ABV. easy to enjoy a few at a time"
"This is an excellent beer and proves itself worthy of the reviews it receives. Not one aspect of this beer disappointed me with tons of character but not so overwhelming that you are limited to just one. Great beer!"
"D - I am really impressed with this porter. Got this one in a trade and would love to try this again."
"Pours a deep, dark, clear brown with a small tan head. Smells of toasted hops, coffee, and a slight malty sweetness. The flavor has lots of chocolate and toasted malts up front with a nice hop flavor balancing the finish. Nice full body with a dry finish."
"D - Thank you sir can I have another!"
"I freakin' loved it. Got it from my family who lives in Ohio. Black, smells great, toasty flavor, very short period of mild bitterness at the end. I was impressed by just how smooth this stuff was. Now if only we could get their stuff regularly here in Eastern PA, life would be grand."
"I have been wanting to taste this porter for a long time now, and finally had the opportunity at a recent tasting near my home. From the small tasting, I knew it was imperative that I get myself a bottle. I purchased a bottle today, chilled it tonight, and had it while watching a Phillies game. This porter pours a dark ruby color, which turns to almost black when fully emptied into the glass. Carbonation is minimal, but apparent (more so than I would have expected). Aroma is fantastic, smelling of dark chocolate and malts. Smooth at first, a bitterness becomes apparent after swallowing. Not overwhelming in the least; pleasant and enjoyable. Definitely one of the best porters I've had to date."
"D: Awesome. I think I've finished whole six-packs on my own before."
"Taste does a good job of balancing roasty malt and sweet chocolate flavors. Leafy hops have a prevalent role in the flavor and are helped out some by the roast in the bitterness department. Milk Duds candy comes to mind as it warms up a bit. Does not lack in flavor or body, it has a nice creamy feel. One of those beers you just do not want to end."
"D - This is a good beer and it is easy to drink. One of the best porters I've had but after drinking Black Butte the past week while in Vegas this one really can't match it. I would pick this up again if I wanted a porter and didn't have access to Deschutes."
"M/D- Rich, medium bodied and silky. very drinkable and another beer i'm dissapointed is unavailable in CT."
"Overall - An absolutely fantastic example of the style. Wonderfully flavorful and balanced. Will buy again and I'll be sure it's a staple in the fridge. Pretty good with port wine cheddar."
"Moderate finger's worth of tan, eggshell color, fair mix of bubble sizes, swift denouement down to the surface, small streaks of lacing left behind. The liquid is a mostly blackish brown with a patina of metallic orange around the outside. The nose has an excellent balance between roast and sweetness, coffee bean, milk chocolate, licorice, butterscotch, cooked oats, cherry and blackberry fruit, the hops do not reveal distinct scents, however, do condition the texture in your nostrils, lending dry bite. Medium-bodied, firm and displays good thrust in getting from start to finish. More roast in the coffee and mocha flavors here, more granola, oats and bread grains as well. Orange zest makes an appearance now and then. Smokehouse wood notes obscure some of the cherry, plum fruit. The carbonation is moderate, no fluffiness added just a slow mixing of the flavors. Metallic nuances linger at the end and extend the complete presence."
"For a porter, this beer certainly has a lot of bite to it. But considering it only clocks in around 5.5% ABV, you can have quite a few of these before your night is done early. Sure, this is definitely a bottom-heavy beer with most of the flavor notes kicking in near the end, but if you're looking for a well-done porter that sticks to a style without any real quirks or superfluousness, then this ship-wreck of a beer is for you."
"O: Let down."
"I can literally say that this was one of the three beers that got me into craft beer. Thank you, Great Lakes."
"Pours dark brown in color with some redness and lighter brown hues around the edges. More than 2 fingers of creamy tanned head appear and retain very well. An abundant amount of lace clings all around the glassware. Nose is quite grainy with notes of chocolate and suggestions of citrus hops through the end of the aroma. Taste is a well blended combination of grain, bitter chocolate, hits of coffee, citrus hops and alcohol through the body and lingers in the finish as well. Feel of this beer is medium to light with a light amount of carbonation. This is a very drinkable porter that is quite balanced and a very enjoyable mix of flavors and aromas to be had."
"Spot on for the style and very tasty. I really enjoy a good porter and this one ranks right up there with some of the best."
"Edit 12-14-10: The consistence of this beer is amazing."
"A damn good session porter. I like SN and Kona in terms of non special to the extreme porters, but this one is definitely one of the best in its style."
"D- One of my favorite porters; easy drinking and tasty."
"Great lakes has great products! Look them up"
"overall in my top 3 porters"
"D: This is a delicious and satisfying example of an American Porter. Heavy roast balanced against a nice hop profile."
"Strong coffee flavor with a hint of dark chocolate and some smokiness. Well developed malts and pleasant hop afterburn. Creamy smooth carbonation on the palate. A very good example of the porter style."
"Despite a good amount of carbonation, this feels smooth, thick, chewy. If this heavy, smooth, roasty beer is a porter, then I have no idea what the difference is between a porter and a stout. Not that I'm complaining."
"Near black, held to light = garnet, with a smallish, light tan head that shows good retention but doesn't leave a ton of lace. Aroma is great: roasted malts, rich chocolatey-ness and heavy caramel notes. Taste is a nice, chocolate sweetness; roasted tones are there; the sweetness is balanced by a dry (smoky?) finish with a bit of an unexpected hop/citrusy bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with some fairly high carbonation. A very enjoyable porter."
"This is my favorite porter to date. Founders porter and great lakes edmund fitzgerald. I want the Fitz because great lakes does not distribute to my area so it is my favorite out of shear want. Pours a black tawny with a minimal head. Big coffee on the nose and semi sweet chocolate. Nice dark chocolate bitter finish. It is very creamy , smooth, with a slight velvety feel. Amazing"
"Consumed: 3/11/2010"
"This is without a doubt, one of the best porters I've had in quite some time - maybe ever. To say this would make a great session brew and getting a case of this is a must. Easy going, yet has enough bawls to fully satisfy a big beer appetite..."
"D: Hell yeah. Not so thick that it is a chore, could easily go through a few of these in an evening. Tasty."
"Was eager to try a Great Lakes beer, so when a friend ordered one of these at a local DC bar, I told her I wanted half. Was pretty impressed. Had an above average look and smell, definitely a good looking porter. Taste was of coffee and chocolate, with some earthy toffee notes. Mouthfeel was just average. I'd have this beer again, either for dessert or as a session beer."
"A very Solid Porter for the 6 pack format. This one along with, Founders,Deschutes, and Anchor are the 4 best buys there are in the land of porters. well done Great Lakes."
"Pours a clear and bright mahogany color topped with a creamy one finger tan head. The frothy head gives off a bold roasted malt aroma. The flavor full of both roasted coffee and sweet chocolate. The body complements the taste with a thick and heavy feel and low levels of carbonation. Smooth and velvety drink brings on a slowly fading finish which leaves behind a sweet malty taste."
"D: The creamy feel to it makes you wish every beer went down like that. The flavor notes are great and not overwhelming at the same time. I could definitely go for another!"
"Overall: Definitely the best porter I've had, and one of the best beers period. It tastes great, goes down easy, looks and smells great. Just a fantastic well-rounded beer that proves beer can be just as enjoyable as a nice dessert."
"D: I am almost 3/4 of the way through a growler and I wish I had more. What an amazing beer!"
"Pours a dark ruby-tinged sable that is somewhat translucent with a decent pale tan head. Aroma is strong and smoky, mainly of fine roast coffee. Flavor is like a fine mocha, slightly sweet and with a firm molasses undertone. Texture is smooth, tingly and edgy. Definitely worthy."
"It had been years since I had this beauty, but was eager to try it again now that Great Lakes is in North Carolina. Served to me in a pint glass at Custom Home Pubs. Appearance was typical of a porter, dark and moderately carbonated. Decent nose, not a lot of overwhelming aromas, but very subtle. The taste is unconventionally smooth for a porter. I'm not a huge fan of porters as a style, but I could drink this all day. Perfect balance and mouthfeel. Highly drinkable and quite possibly the best porter I've ever had."
"Wow Great Lakes is a very, very good brewery that I am now just trying. This brew is a world class porter, which I could session all night long. This is one of the best porters I have ever had, and has renewed my interest in trying different porters. Awesome."
"This is a great beer, plain and simple."
"The mouthfeel is so smooth and creamy with the right amount of carbonation. Almost chewy, but not quite there. This beer goes down so easily and is something I will buy many more times."
"Very drinkable. I used to rate the Scandanavian porters the highest but this is pushing the bar pretty high."
"A fine example of a porter."
"D - Highly drinkable porter as it is nicely balanced and there are no overpowering tastes that would begin to resonate. Not a fan of porters, but this one is very nice."
"Poured into my glass this one offered almost no head or lacing to speak of. The color was so dark brown that it was almost black. Smelled a little bit chocolatey, malts were there and barley. There was also some smokiness to the smell. The taste was good very good. The taste was how it smelled. The malts were there and smokiness. A little bit too boozy of a taste. It was a very good beer and I would drink it again, but not more than one at a time. But I still rate it high because it is a very good beer. Just not my style."
"Overall I wish I could get this in CA. Oh well. I will just have to trade for it."
"This case just came in the beer distributors yesterday and I grabed it and sure glad I did as this is one of the Best Porters I have ever drank they have really pulled out a great one here. If you can get it do it is worth every penny it cost I totaly recomend this one!"
"D - Wonderfully robust porter. Not much room for improvement, here."
"D: This is definitely an excellent domestic porter; one of the best I've ever had."
"Extremely drinkable, but I'd rather just savor them for special occasions."
"Delicious creamy texture, very smooth. I have no problem drinking it again."
"Drinks like a champ, nice and dry, smooth, not overly sweet. To be honest, I'm a little surprised that such a hoppy porter ends up working out so well, I would never have imagined. At this pricepoint, I need to be seeking Great Lakes stuff out from online stores more often."
"This may be the architypical American porter. Not much head with vigorous pour. Well moderated roasted malt flavors and balanced hopping. Finished a little dry. Not a beer that knocks your socks off, but solid and well put together on all counts. GL's consistency in production is another positive aspect."
"This beer is a a work of art, a must try from GL."
"This beer drinks really easily...this finish cleans everything out enough for me to keep wanting to drink"
"I love this beer. I don't say that very often, but this has so much to offer. Great Lakes BC, you have my respect and support for as long as you make beer this good."
"Pours a dark cola with a lingering khaki head that laces lightly. Just enough light gets through to let you know that this is a sessionable beer rather than an overwhelming one. On the nose the roasted malts are huge, raisny, molassasy, dissolving into a toffee finish. The flavor rolls smoothly from cola, to dark roasted malts, with a juicy hop bitterness at the end to wake you up a demand another taste. A perfect session."
"d- amazing beer. I could drink these all day and night"
"D: not complex as RIS but has the same flavor profiles, which is a good thing for me because RIS's are hard to session, but these have been a staple in my fridge for a long time. and will remain my favorite always available great lakes beers."
"another solid offering from this brewery. almost pitch black and clear with mahogany highlights when held to the light. light brown head head. dark toffee/caramel in the nose with some chocolate and dark fruit underneath. dark bready sweet chocolatey malts are balanced by an underlying smooth hop bitterness and just a touch of roastiness. finishes almost dry. medium bodied. carbonation is a little on the light side but not problematic in this beer. very drinkable, a very flavorful beer that keeps the abv reasonable."
"D - Great beer. One beef I've always had with this beer is that the mineral character gets a little distracting. Still, it's a very enjoyable beer that is well worth the money."
"D - as far as porters go, it doesn't get much better than this, especially if you want to have a few in one night. A staple porter for sure."
"Revisted this beer since it is brand new to the market. Best before date of 10/05/2010. I will bump up the taste score from 3 to 3.5 but otherwise my original ratings stand. The score increase is because this time I picked up more subtle flavors. Definate C-hop flavor that gives more of a bittersweet aspect. Still many porters out there that are better than this."
"Tested at room temperature in the big pint glass I see classic dark mahogany color, semi-opaque, with a big frothy light brown head and good lacing. The aroma offers tart cocoa malt and touches of mango nuttiness. Quite nice. The taste buds say yum to more of this burst of malt & coffee bean bite, dry charcoal wood, some herbal hop, and even some banana mango hints. Just a fine mouthful of flavor with a decent medium body that offers a bit of a silky resinous feel with effective but subtle carbonation for a perfectly drinkable and delicious porter. It obviously stands on its own but would pair well with cheese or other edibles for sure. Another beauty from Great Lakes!"
"d - I really enjoyed this porter. It had a great creamy coffee/chocolate taste that seemed to get better as I drank it and it warmed up. At 5.8% ABV this is a wonderful beer that doesn't have a high ABV and I will definitely be trying to land more of this."
"Pours a dark brwn with a silky head. Nice lace and retention. Nose has roasty malts, chocolate, coffee, molasses, toffee and dark pitted fruits. Taste is a nice balance between sweet cocoa, cherries and plums over bitter hops, roasted malts and molasses. Medium body is nicely carbonated."
"D: very solid beer. exactly what i would expect from an outstanding porter. not extreme, but textbook of what I think a porter should be."
"The mouthfeel was not too thick or too thin in my book. This glass went down pretty easy and I can see a good session of this fine porter on a cold winter's night. Great Lakes is one of my favorite breweries and Edmund Fitzgerald Porter is one of the best offerings. Good stuff."
"D: Honestly, this is one of the best porters I've ever had. A smooth brew with a good mix of coffee and malt flavors and a great nose. Also, at 5.8% abv it's fairly sessionable and could easily serve as a replacement for a RIS on a night you can't afford to be light-headed after one beer. I highly recommend trying this one."
"Mouthfeel is a bit lighter than I expect from a highly rated porter. Also, I found it a bit overcarbonated. Decent drinkability. Goes down smoothly & easily. This is a really flavorful session strength porter."
"Taste is also heavy on the malt, dark chocolate and iced coffee smack the palate as well. Feels very smooth and creamy on the tongue. Not too heavy, just about the perfect body. A moderate alcohol content makes this a great brew to have a few of."
"Highly recommended to anyone who likes porters or stouts."
"Drinkability: I would def have this again and recommend this to those who seek a solid porter who is nicely balanced with coffee as well as malts."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a Unibroue tulip. Best by date of 4/3/10. Beige, sizable head sticks around for a while atop an almost black body. Some soapy lacing slides down the glass and some oily resin sticks on the glass telling me this one has a nice hop bill. Aroma is of coffee, some chocolate malt and some toasted malt. Taste is mildly sweet with obvious coffee and chocolate notes. Very, very smooth to drink, nothing off-putting whatsoever. Even better as it warms...Amazingly easy to drink and I can see why this beer has the reputation that it has..."
"Thanks Mark!"
"First thought is here is a Porter that combines all the characteristics a Porter could possibly contain. Roasted, bitter and burnt. Chocolate, cocoa nibs and coffee grounds. Vanilla, brown sugar and roasted graham. All these flavors hit you each time you raise the glass and play ping pong with your palate. Taste score may have achieved perfection with a better mouthfeel to complement it, as is the feel is good but doesn't achieve the silky, creamy smoothness of some other great Porters. Would buy again."
"D - I can see why this porter is on the top 100...a great example...I love the change it goes through as it warms...it shows its complexity...solid offering from Great Lakes"
"Pours a dark brown color with small amount of light brown head. Smell is slightly smoky, roasted malt,and bit of coffee. The flavor is roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate. It finish off with nice hop and dark roasted malt bitterness. Creamy mouthfeel with medium carbonation."
"The beer pours dark brown with an off-white head. The aroma is basic porter, roasted malt with a little bit of coffee. The flavor is more of the same with roasted malt, chocolate and coffee. There are also some hops to stop the beer from being too sweet. Creamy mouthfeel. A very good porter."
"Overall, this porter is ok, but doesn't live up to the hype, let alone me a top 100 beer. There are too many better, fuller more flavorful porters to keep drinking this. Having said that, getting a fixer at Whole Foods for $7.99 makes it a bargain, only if we rated that."
"I'm usually not a fan of the porter style. I wouldn't list it in my top 10 styles, maybe not even the top 20, but this beer is amazing. Maybe I just haven't been drinking the right porters. Its sweet and completely smooth. Finishes without an aftertaste. Medium body and there is a roast character in the back of the palate that lingers (not as an aftertaste, just lingers). This is really an amazing beer and the best porter (by far) I've ever had. Great connectivity and mouthfeel, drinkability high."
"D: At 5.8% this is exactly where I would want a porter to be. Huge flavor, yet very drinkable and the abv is never noticed. Perfect!"
"D: Very good I would drink this again."
"Overall a great drink. Compare with Samuel Smith's Taddy Porter, invite the friends, tell them to bring cheese and crackers. Or better yet, serve fish and chips."
"D-this beer is extremely drinkable and tasty, a great mouthfeel, one of the top porters out there imo."
"M/D: The feel of this beer is incredible. Smooth and silky, and yet, the carbonation content does not appear low. The texture of the beer is still fairly light. The mouthfeel follows the trend that this beer lays out from the beginning. Complex, well balanced, and not overpowering. Everything about this beer is enjoyable while staying subtle. This beer is a reminder that phenomenal beers do not have to be barrel aged, brewed with brettanomyces, or over 10% ABV. Very nicely done, Great Lakes."
"This is my first beer from Great Lakes and I'm glad to have been able to try this one. This is a porter I could drink a few bottles of in a sitting. It's a nice change of pace from all the Imperial porters and stouts I usually drink. Very good beer, and one that I will use to compare all other american porters too. Nice beer!"
"This is an excellent porter that represents the style very well. Could almost stand as a benchmark beer against which many other porters should be judged."
"Drinkability- I've only tried a handful of beers that rival this in terms of drinkability, especially on a cold winter day. This beer achieves a rich, complex, well balanced flavor without being overwhelming. Just what the doctor ordered."
"Drinkability: Very good. I could have many of these in a row simply based on taste. I feel like it would take many pints to really figure out and appreciate some of these interesting complexities. Plus it's only 5.8% which lends itself well to drinking."
"This is my third from the variety pack of Great Lakes and one of my new favorites. Probably the best Porter I have ever had."
"Drinkability is great. A very enjoyable, well-balanced beer."
"The A grade is well deserved. Buy this as soon as possible if you haven't tried it yet."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a smooth roasted malt scent along with a creamy chocolate aroma. The taste is great as well. It has a wonderful roasted malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry with a slight hint of chocolate. It's extremely smooth and easy drinking. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine porter, but I was expecting more."
"this smell was good, sniffed some chocolate and a little coffee notes, the sight of it was dark brown. the taste is delicious without being to thick. the carbonation was very good for a porter because usually stouts and porters are a little flat and that's ok. but the drinkability is good also, i wouldn't abuse it though, because i like the taste as a sipper."
"OVERALL Wow. I don't often give 5's, but I am here. Very easy drinking, smooth, and packed full of flavor. Excellent, and in my view, sessionable brew. I could have several of these, no problem."
"The feel of the beer is really smooth. It goes down with a little wisp of a alcohol bite. It have a nice drinkable feel and goes down well."
"All in all, this is a good brew if you like some of the hoppy taste masked behind some watery / coffee flavors. Good beer to try once."
"Pours a dark reddish mahogany with a a creamy tan head, mostly diminishing, with a fine long lasting lacing. The aroma is of coffee, caramel and roasted malt. Very creamy and full bodied; a rich feeling on the palate. Great long lasting finish, leaving a slightly burnt malt taste, but crisp and very mellow. Nicely carbonated. A great accompaniment to any hearty fare, including steak, burgers, brats, or stew. or to use when I simmer my ribs."
"Sessionable like none other. I've had pours, bottles, and kegs of this. One of my favorite beers in the world - nice way to spend a Saturday, drinking this from the source."
"Bottle. Complex roasted malt aroma. Pours black with a large tan frothy head that lasted with good lacing. Medium to heavy coffee and chocolate flavor with a medium to heavy complex dark sweet finish of moderate3 to long duration. Long lasting mouthful."
"They suggest on their website pairing the Fitzgerald with BBQ ribs, which I think is a brilliant match, and I would add to that any other grilled, smoky foods. Remember guys, match like with like. The nice smoke and roastiness on the nose and palate of this beer make it a natural match with dishes of similar profiles."
"Overall impression: Excellent porter. Another winner from Great Lakes."
"Drink this beer no matter what your tastes are and you won't be dissapointed."
"Outstanding drinkability. Satisfying and tasty, this lives up to the hype. I've yet to have a better porter. I'd love to have it again."
"D- This is a totally drinkable, highly enjoyable porter. To me this is the benchmark fo the American Porter style."
"This one is scary it goes down so well. Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter is an excellent beer with great drinkability, and I recommend it to every beer lover."
"D - Drinkability is exceptional. Fully enjoyable from start to finish. Easily the best of the style I've had. Highly recommended."
"Try this beer. There's not much of another way to say it. It's a high quality brew at a very reasonable price. One of the top porters."
"Very tasty overall, I've had this beer several times and each time I'm impressed. Would definitely buy again."
"Drinkability: This beer didn't start out too hot, but it got smoother and tastier throughout the session. There are better porters out there, but this is a solid representative for the style."
"Soft and silky mouthfeel, heavy and good. Drinkable as a session beer, maybe one of the best porters out there."
"Mouthfeel is bittersweet. A bit bubbly and the body is relatively thin."
"Happy Holidays!"
"Overall- wonderfully drinkable for such a dark beer with a nice balance between earthy hops and bittersweet malt. Dark roasted specialty malts shine in this brew and leave a great chewy chocolate/coffee aftertaste. This brew is best as it warms and if you dont believe there are hops in it just wait until the first burp! Another winner from GLBC!"
"Overall, one of those beers that I love, but always pass over because of the easy accessibility. Well I finally reminded myself to pick up a 6-pack and it was definitely worth it."
"d: Absolutley lives up to it's reputation, a damn fine porter."
"Such a good beer. In fact, I can think of very few bottled porters that even come close. The only way one could make this better is by puting it on nitro!"
"Hope to taste a better one than this. Doubt I will. Get it if you can. Thanks Great Lakes. Nicely done!"
"Bobsy thanks a lot for this great beer."
"Maybe I got a better bottle or maybe my palate has changed in the past two months, but regardless, I enjoyed this a lot more than last time. Upped my score accordingly."
"overall an extremely well-done porter"
"Mouthfeel is very chewy and filling. Very smooth in body, super easy to drink. Really great porter, it lives up to expectations."
"The beer is medium bodied with a crisp mouthfeel. The abv is low and the flavors are well balanced, making this a very sessionable brew. I have been waiting to try this beer for a while now, and I wasn't disappointed at all, thanks Craig."
"D: I thought this was a geat porter. Long lasting flavor, slightly sweet and just a little bitter. A couple more and I'm good."
"Drinkability - I easily could have had another one of these, and it went fantastic with the meal (meatloaf). A great beer for a great evening in a holy place of beer."
"D: It is solid and worth going back to as a regular beer, but i am not sure if I would really go out of my way to get it"
"Pours a deep dark brown, almost black color with a thick, lingering tan head. Nice aroma with chocolate ands dark fruit flavors initially, followed by floral hop aromas. Taste is chocolatey with a mild sweetness but balanced with a slight bitterness. Medium-bodied and creamy and easy to drink. Very enjoyable."
"D: Highly drinkable though still a bit light bodied even for its style."
"Taste is cedar and smoke, roasted malt and a light hop presence. Goes down nice and creamy, smooth."
"(D)- A fantastic porter that is the epitome of the style. Great smoothness with a rustic feel from the nuttiness. Creamy and lightly sweet. I could easily put a few of these down."
"I think if they cut the carbonation down just a slight bit, the beers flavour would shine a lot more. The mouth feel is the only part of the beer that isn't top notch. My first beer by Great Lakes, and certainly not my last."
"D - A great American Porter that worthy of it's ranking."
"Another amazing beer from Great Lakes, who is right up there with the likes of SN, Dogfish, Victory, Bell's, etc. Excellent porter. You know Hemmingway would drink this at the typer all night long."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a deep opaque black with ruby highlights and a creamy white head. The nose is roasted coffee, toffee. The flavor follows the nose with some dark chocolate thrown in. The finish is dry. Nice creamy mouthfeel, medium body, average carbonation. A damn fine porter that I could drink all night."
"D - Great. It could go great with some food because it has enough flavor to stand up to a lot of stuff, but it's just awesome by itself. I haven't had one in a while, and I've had a bunch of really good porters in between, but coming back to this now just makes me realize how great this is."
"D: I'm glad I was able to pick this one up. A great balance of flavors and a nice mouthfeel help this one out big time. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this one again."
"I would dare to say Edmund Fitzgerald (the beer, not the ship) is a little over-hyped, though it's clearly one very good porter. I sat and sat with it wondering if it was ever gonna push through my own personal Top 100, but I'm not tasting anything that would place it there. Still, it's a wonderful beer, and I'm glad to have tried it."
"D: Very good porter - strong roasted, smoky chocolate character I would expect from a porter. Didn't get much coffee in the taste, but I'm okay with it. Good beer..."
"I picked up a six pack of this for my dad because he is kind of an Edmund Fitzgerald buff. He's been to the museum ect. and we both agree that Gordon Lightfoot's song is one of the best pieces of music ever recorded. Anyway this is also damn good porter. Poured into a mug it is almost black. Maybe just a little translucent reddish color comes through. Very nice. The taste is very complex, bitter sweet chocolate, roasty malts a little biterness from the hops, dry coffee like finish. More flavors come through as it gets warmer. I usually like beers that are lighter bodied with a bigger hop kick. I drink one or two of theese and I feel like I've eaten a pan of brownies. I like a beer like this once in a while and I haven't come across a better one. If you are a porter fan, I can't see you finding anything wrong with this beer."
"D - One hell of a beer. This will definitely be a regular in my rotation."
"This is a very good year round porter."
"Nice job guys!"
"A drinkable porter that has a ton of malt flavor. Chocolatey and decadant. A very solid offering from Great Lakes."
"D - Oh so drinkable. I was just going to have one, but that did not happen. Went down well and left me wanting more."
"Hats off to great lakes. This is the only dark beer I've had that satisfies me like an RIS, but lacks all the alcohol. An excellent sipper when you want all the flavor but don't want to get drunk. I can sip on these all night....and I just might..."
"I have been consistently impressed by Great Lakes, and this was no exception. This is exactly what a porter should be."
"Very dark brown pour, almost a ruby/mahogany when held to direct light. Coffee and chocolate scents are most notable. Also some roasted nuttiness with smoky overtones. I really like the smoky coffee flavor that dominates. The sweetness is similiar to burnt/caramelized sugar. Just enough bitterness provided by the hops for a surprisingly crisp finish. I really enjoyed the bitter finish of this. Pretty low ABV allowing you to session this through multiple football games."
"Drinkability: This is a very solid and drinkable beer. I have really enjoyed this one. It is definitely a go to porter, especially considering the price. I shall definitely pick this up again. Something that I actually enjoyed the thinner mouthfeel when it came to drinkability (even though that's not what I go for when it comes to mouthfeel)."
"D - This is probably the best Porter out there, a style that I have begun to love, and this one is one that will get a clone as soon as I start homebrewing"
"Drinkability is superb, I could easily drink several of these anytime of the year. Overall this is a top notch porter, Not overally complex but surely one of the best porters that I have had."
"Awesome porter. Very good brew."
"F: A dry Irish stout taste finishes up the taste as well as more roasted and chocolate tastes. The sweet start it had really dried off on the finish. The earthy charred roasted malt taste really comes out on the tongue and helps the finish. As I swallow its got a nice chocolate milk taste with touch of coffee. More bakers chocolate finishes it up with a nice touch and then it clears off the palate leaving it beat up but wanting more. The low alcohol content really turns up the drinkability."
"The mouthfeel is good. Perhaps a little too much carbonation. The drinkability of this beer is great, and I could drink this beer all night."
"This is hands down the best porter I've had yet. The mouth feel is big, but not quite as big as a stout."
"Notes: Once again, my pursuit of Great Lakes brews has not let me down. In fact this one surpassed my expectations. After reading many of Buckeye's reviews (as I'm sure many have) of GL I knew I had to try them. I agree with his assessment of this one in particular. An excellent porter."
"D: I could drink these all days, not even the slightest bit of heaviness."
"This is the best porter Ive had the pleasure to taste. It is one of my go to sessions from one of my go to breweries."
"D - This is quite a drinkable porter. Great roasted flavors, light in body, very smooth going down. Seems like a great beer for food. The smokey and roasty flavors would complement nicely."
"Drinkability: Excellent porter. It's one I really enjoy, and it goes down smooth. Easy to drink, and one you could have more than one of. Wish it was available where I live."
"D - Very high. This beer keeps you wanting more."
"D: Easy as a porter can be."
"Was extremely surprised to find this Porter of a treasure at Eulogy Bar in Philadelphia. Girlfriend ""Lady M"" truly enjoyed this outstanding depiction of a true-to-the-style classic. Great stuff... Easily drinkable without being cloying or overbearing. Would definitely cop this more often if it were more readily available in NJ... Recommended..."
"This is a great porter that I have to put on my list of must have beers once the winter starts to set it."
"Flavor isn't as roasty as one would expect from the aroma. Flavor is just a bittersweet and this bittersweet element hangs around in the aftertaste and comes back in the beer burps. Yes, I operate under the opinion that the flavor of the beer burp is part of the tasting experience. Some tangy sourness in there too, but its minimal. No diactyl. Body is neither overbearingly heavy nor chewy. It goes great with fast food or beef or mexican food (outside of chicken dishes)."
"Really smooth and oily. A great mouthfeel. Not one that I would drink a lot of in one sitting, but a really great porter and beer overall"
"All 4's, and 4+'s..."
"D: Excellent traditional porter... doesnt try to be extreme with any of the flavors."
"Overall, I am really enjoying this beer. It packs a lot of flavor that most porters don't do. It is rather filling though, so this bottle may be enough for me. I would definitely love having access to this one. Well done."
"This is simply a great porter."
"D: A good porter. I imagine it would pair well with certain cheeses."
"D=very drinkable, though sweetness of malts can get old for some."
"D - Easy to get if you live in the right area (which I unfortunately don't), and with the low ABV make, this an easy and delicious drink. The bitter hop finish dries off the tongue and makes you want to take another sip."
"Overall a solid American porter, it doesn't get much better than this for this style."
"D - Tasty and not too ABV. I would love this as a session."
"D - I could drink this all night. Great flavor, smooth mouthfeel, and just enough ABV to remind you that your drinking a dark beer."
"Overall, this is a strong porter...one I could drink many of and not get tired of it. It is standard, but maybe a bit more body and chocolaty character than most English porters. It's an American micro, right? So why not pump it up a bit. Anyway, this beer tastes great, is relatively true to style, and stands out as a solid porter."
"This beer poured a very dark brown with a barely perceptible auburn tinge and a small dark head. The smell is mostly some deeply roasted malts with some melted chocolate and caramel notes. The taste starts off with some molasses that gives way to some mocha while avoiding some of the bitterness normally inherent in the style and making for a lighter beer than you would expect from the look of the beer. The mouthfeel is satisfyingly thick and chewy with a moderate amount of carbonation. This is a great version of the style that doesn't necessarily stick to the strict formula but still manages to maintain enough hallmarks of the style to be a good interpretation of it."
"D- beers this roasty I can't drink too many of, or too frequently, but this is pretty great. For the style, and for me, this is pretty drinkable."
"I had a lot of expectations for this porter. Ultimately, this beer didn't supplant Bully! Porter as my favorite beer of the style. Bully! Porter has a lot of roasty bitterness and contrasting hop bitterness in addition to a similar malty taste profile. So while Edmund Fitzgerald is less complex, it is a very, very fine example of the style on its own right. This review may be tinged with disappointment, but the truth of the matter is that this porter is one of the best. If Great Lakes would be so kind as to distribute to Missouri, then I would buy this semi-regularly."
"A hum the tune of the great song that goes with this beer as I pour it into my pint glass. Dark dark brown almost black but, some red can be seen when held to the window. Nice cap of mocha colored head rest gently on top of my glass. After sinking (oh bad choice of words) there is a fair amount of beige lace sticking to all sides of the glass. The aroma is coffee and caramel. roast malt and a hint of hops. The flavor is fantastic. Coffee, malt, vanilla, and a nice sharp hop bite to round things off. Pefect medium body that makes it oh so drinkable. Just the right amount of carbonation to livin things up. This is a great porter. I love this style and this is definately tops amongst my favorites."
"M/D: Surpassingly nice body, relative to other porters I've had. Could call this one a stout, maybe? Goes down creamy smooth and has low carbonation. Very drinkable."
"Pours reddish dark brown that light can barely penetrate. A finger of creamy head sits atop, and lasts through most of the glass. Smells of roasty malts, chocolate, and creamy coffee. Those also dominate the flavor, and as it warms a bit, I get some raspberry, smoke, and earthy black olive. Mmm, the taste of the coffee in this beer resembles that from high quality beans, so I might describe this as a lighter alternative to bigger breakfast stouts. At less than 6% (not noticeable) with slightly more than a medium body, this one packs a ton of flavor. Too bad it is not more widely available because I would recommend this to any fan of porters and beyond. Great representation of the style from this solid brewery!"
"An interesting, yet easy-drinking porter. Would definitely recommend."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is smooth, velvety, and with just a slight touch of bitter. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium. This beer is wonderful it holds all the characteristic of a really good porter. I enjoyed every sip."
"My second GL beer and another winner. Thank you Great Lakes for coming to Philly!"
" Get Some!!!"
"Exceptionally drinkable and well flavored... this is just about all you can ask for from the style."
"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a deep black/brown around the edges. Nice tan head that leaves good lacing behind. The nose of this beer smells mostly of roasted coffee. The taste is at first of bittersweet chocolate, there is also an abundance of roasty coffee flavors, and they flow very well together. The mouthfeel is medium heavy with a nice creaminess to it. This brew is extremely drinkable, I think I'll go have another."
"Poured into a pint glass. It pours black with a nice brown head that left partial lacing as I finsihed the beer. The aroma is mostly notes of coffee, molasses and chocolate. The taste starts off with a somewhat creamy mouth feel. It has a rich roasty and sweet malt flavor. More tastes of coffee and chocolate with some bitterness that starts in the middle as stays till the end with chocolate dominating. A very nice porter. Another good beer by Great Lakes."
"An absolutely fantastic beer, I wish that this was available in boston."
"Ultra smooth, creamy mouthfeel with a slight tingly carbonation in the end. The bitterness and the yeastiness make it a slow drinker, otherwise a fantastic beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The texture is smooth, without ever reaching a rolling carbonation that could better exhibit the flavors. It falls almost flat right before the swallow. The rich, prominent character overall makes this a beer a classic, bold Porter."
"drinkability: overall a great beer and one of the top porters on the market"
"D - very high. I am generally not to huge on porters, but i dig this one. Maybe i am coming around, or perhaps this is just a really well done beer."
"In another rating, I reported that a different porter beat Eddie Fitz hands down. But after a second sampling of the old lake freighter, I'll concede that the only difference may have been aroma. Otherwise, the Great Lakes entry is an excellent porter. Nuf said. (BTW, Founders porter was the other)."
"D- My favorite Porter on the market. Have had over 100 of these in the lifetime."
"5.0 D: This is a very fine dark beer. I must say I love it."
"Drinkability - Superb. Everything a nice porter should be - flavorful without being overbearing, nice mouthfeel, all around top notch beer."
"D- Great beer makes for great drinking."
"Pours a dark brown, with a nice tan head that kind of falls back to a dense ring. Leaves only a little bit of lacing. This one looks pretty normal for the style. The smell comes up with coffee, chocolate, with a moderate sweetness. There's a bit of dry fruitiness in there, too. Again, kind of normal as I would've expected for the style. The taste comes on strong immediately with coffee - roasted barley flavors. There's a note of bitter chocolate - heavy on the roasty bitterness. The sweetness is kind of minimal, but present, barely able to cut into the coffee flavors. The taste all seems to be contained in the first sip, and very little seems to change as I get further into this beer. Mind you, what's here is good, nice and interesting, nothing is really off about it. Towards the end I started to notice a kind of bready, yeasty flavor - maybe some light esters, which don't do too much for me, but again, this one seems right on track, but not quite outstanding. This one is full, but the carbonation provides quite a sting - which actually leads to it feeling a bit thinner. But kind of nice I'd say. This one is good, but not great. It's nice and enjoyable, a beer you could probably enjoy quite a bit. I could really see myself drinking it again, if the price were right, but I wouldn't expect to be wowed by it."
"light to medium body, smooth overall, punctuated w astringent and acidic flashes, along with phenols. mild to moderate carbonation is otherwise creamy."
"It's a joy to drink and it's a pity I only have one. It's a virtually flawless American porter."
"I poured into a Detroit Beer Company pint glass to very little tan head. It is very dark but not quite black. If I hold it to the light I see a burgundy glow. I smell roasted malt and maybe a hint of coffee. Sweet malts up front with bitter coffee on the back end. Yummy. There is very little carbonation as expected. I like this stuff. This is my go to beer at the local sports bar that has little selction."
"D: Easy, good. Could put down a few of these, I think it has some great options for food pairing as well."
"A solid porter. Easy drinking and with a lower end ABV you could easily have a couple with no regrets. Not overly smoky or bitter, just smooth."
"Wonderfully drinkable. I am sad to report that this is my only bottle. One of my favorite Porters.. Glad to have had the opportunity to try this."
"D- nice drinkable beer for a porter the taste helps the overall drinkability"
"12oz bottle. Dark brown with a medium beige head. Dark chocolate and caramel aroma. The flavor has a definite roasted coffee edge, but is balanced by sweeter chocolate and malt flavors. Medium bitterness and fuller malty character. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Solid stuff with a good mocha flavor going on. Very drinkable, but not a true session porter really. One of the better porters out there that I have come across, but not really distinctive except that it nails the style without flaws."
"I liked this beer quite a bit, but don't understand what the fuss is about. A very good porter? Yes. A great one? Only maybe."
"D- Definitely one of my favorite porters. Hopefully I can find some more on my upcoming trip to MI."
"D- Easily the best porter that I have had. Very drinkable with a big robust flavor that is surprisingly refreshing. The alcohol is nowhere to be found which makes this something I could definitely drink plenty of."
"Yet another epic winner from Great Lakes."
" A great example of a Porter one of my favorites."
"Overall a very good beer. Happy to have tried it & impressed that an American Porter can stick in the BA Top 100 in this moment of big, bad, kick-ass brews. Salut!"
"Drinkability- One of my favorite porters. Also quite sessionable."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied, moderate carbonation, and a wonderful smoothness. Excellent all around, this beer drinks with the best of them."
"Drinkability: This may be my all-time favorite porter."
"D: I have enjoyed this beer for many years, and find this to be a very tasty and drinkable porter. Not quite a session beer, but one can put down a few bottles or pints if I find myself at the GLBC brewpub."
"A really good porter that I would gladly drink if it were available in CA. It was good as when I tried it in Cleveland 3 years ago."
"A nice flavor and more available on tap at bars than the stouts I am reminded of like 8 Ball, which is another bargain-ish stout. But neither is that close to Anderson Valleys oatmeal which is more pricey. I've found though that Edmund wears thin for me after one pint."
"D- an exeptional brew, prob. better classified as one of those ""stout-porters"" i've been hearing about, but well within guidlines of an Am. porter & being on sale for only $6.99 a sixer it's a def. win/win situation"
"I will start by saying porters are not one of my favorite types. However, this is a very muted and not overly coffee-flavored porter, so it suites my needs well. Dark brown blackish color. Smell of coffee and chocolate. Flavor is very good and drinkable, unlike many porters that overdo the coffee. The low ABV makes this a very good session porter. Not one for those who need big flavors."
"I wanted to like this beer after enjoying the blackout stout so much but i dont think i will buy again. This is my 5th out of a sixer and i still have the same impression as when i drank the first one a week ago."
"D: Pretty good. I can see why the Philly area is excited to get Great Lakes in the area soon."
"M - Medium to thin. Good carbonation level."
"Drinkability: a little chewy to be called a session beer. I don't think it's a refreshing beer exactly. It could be called soothing. I find that these must go down easy because the glass of beer seems to get empty quickly, and yet I don't feel like drinking several more."
"Overall: This is by far the best beer that Great Lakes makes out of their regular lineup and may be one of the best made porters in the US. I enjoy the Blackout Stout but at 5.8% Abv, this porter is highly sessionable."
"D - everything ends up coming together pretty well in the end, going to need to let this one warm up a bit more next time, overall a good porter worth having again"
"Drinkability is good. I liked it, and would revisit it occasionally if it were locally available."
"D- Ok, but almost too complex to make a session out of it. The almost puckering acidity is definitely worth the experience, but not for a session. EDIT: second bottle (not infected) had tremendous drinkability, would make session after session out of this one."
"Very smooth. sharp but not excessive carbonation on the tip of the tongue combined with a creaminess on top that gently coats the roof of the mouth with a fluffy layer."
"D--Classic session porter with enough flavor to remain interesting. Not something I would necessarily reach for when I am only having one, though. This would be a great introductory porter."
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Appears very dark murky brown with about 1/2"" of light brown thick foamy head. Head persists for a while, leaving foamy cap and spotty lacing. Aroma has notes of sweet caramel malt, toffee, chocolate. Taste has flavors of roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, dry earthy hops in finish. Mouthfeel is full up front but seems thinner in finish. Silky smooth mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Easy to drink. Very tasty porter."
"D: Nothing really stands out about it, except that it all tends to meld together quite well creating a very drinkable porter."
"Poured this into my favorite beer drinking glass, not tasting glass like many of my reviews since this is one of my standbys. Pours a dark brown hue with a light caramel head. This one always takes 2 or 3 pours to let it's massive head settle. The smell is strong with coffee, vanilla, a little dried fruit. The taste is heavy with coffee, vanilla, bittersweet chocolate, and a bit of smokiness. The mouthfeel is fairly crisp for the style, no real detectable stickiness. This is a very drinkable beer, I like to alternate this with a PA or IPA. Another solid beer from Great Lakes, which is also a price winner averaging $7.99 a sixer around here."
"Poured to caramelish head that was probably about 1 finger. Head didnt last long. But the porter left rings with every swallow. Brew was almost black in color with a slight redish tint. Had a slight sweet smell of chocolate. Also of coffee and smoke. Tasted very good. Slight alcohol notes. Also a strong coffee, caramel, and smoke. Left a sightly bitter aftertaste in your mouth. That aftertaste also left a strong smoke flavor. Felt good in the mouth. I thought the carbonation was about right. Ive been wanting to try this porter for a long time. I finally found it by luck.(I wasnt really looking for it). It was well worth the wait."
"D: A good example of the style. Not a flavor I really enjoy, and I feel it would benefit from having a thicker body. I am glad I had this, but there are a couple of locals I would prefer to this one."
"It may be a bit too decadent for excessive drinking, but it is definitely a delicious porter which is certainly at the height of the style in the US and the rest of the world."
"The beer poured brown in color in the newly purchased logo pint glass bought at the college bookstore. There is a light wispy head. The nose is a pleasant coffee aroma. Roasted malt and creamy attack of coffee and malt. Somewhat bitter at the finish, with hints of smoke in the aftertaste. This is a good beer and a pleasure to drink, but I was surprised to find it among the Top 100 on this site. Perhaps I need to start sending out some of the great local beers from here to build their reputation."
"Overall impression is a wonderfully rendered porter with some pep. Quite yummy. Headed to the basement to get another bottle."
"Yum... Color was just what I expected, nice cola color with a ringer left until the last. Smell was great, of course that malty malt filled the nose with yum... And I got to tell ya, it tasted yum, outstanding. Or as we use to say in the Corps... Out-&%$#&@@%$-Standing. Enough said. Malty with a slight bit 'O the hops on the back of the pallet. Yum... Mouthfeel was above average. What an easy beer to drink. Please sir, may I have somemore..."
"Smokey and quite roasted, the porter packs a healthy chocolate punch up front, which melts into a bitter smoke/coffee flavor that lingers after swallowing. The brew feels thick, smooth, and substantial, but the carbonation seems prickly. I found it slightly too bitter after repeated tastes, and could not handle more than one in a session."
"D - Almost four months after its preferred ""enjoy by"" date, and this still holds up extremely well. Very nice multi-faceted porter with lots going on. I will need to get more of this in the future!"
"This beer is clear and very dark ruby in the glass - nearing black. A thick and sticky tan head sits on top of the liquid. Aromas include toffee, licorice, coffee, hearty smoke, cocoa, and bread - great smelling beer. Taste is bready and smokey to start, followed by cocoa notes and some molasses. Finish has an earthy bitterness and long lasting roasted coffee flavors. Carbonation is fluffy and smooth in the mouth, and the beer is medium-full in body. Drinkability is very good on this ale for me, but thats probably because I enjoy dark chocolate, black coffee, and smoked foods. This is a great example of an American Porter - has to be included in my top five."
"drinkability the perfect porter goes down very easy and is perfectly balanced"
"This beer is quite drinkable. I can see how some would question having multiples, but I think it is good enough that you may have more than one and definitely good enough that you will probably want to have it again, should you like porters."
"D- I have to say I'm not the biggest fan of this style but this beer is quite exceptional. Definitely worth a go and if you like porters than a must try."
"Drinkability: Really high - such a solid porter. Probably the only one I would keep on hand on a regular basis. Love it."
"Pours unspectacular black with a small amount of light tan foam. Smell is spectacular and perfect, very earthy with coffee and grain a' plenty. Taste is good, with dark coffee flavor and hints of chocolate and grain. Feels greet and is an absolute treat to drink. A little heavy for multiple bottles, and while I had no problem finishing my glass, I don't know how many more I could have in a single evening."
"D: Pretty good porter that didn't disappoint. Good beer for it's style. I don't know if this brewery will ever be available in MN."
"I'm not sure about this beer. It smells amazing, but the flavor doesn't seem to live up to the smell too well. Overall, a decent porter."
"D: Amazing. Thanks to Great Lakes for having an ""Enjoy By"" date. This will definitely be a favorite."
"I will remember this beer for a long time, if you get the opportunity try it."
"Drinkability: Apparently well-loved and received, but a tad too much burnt malt flavor."
"This is very drinkable. This is one of my favorite porters."
"Side Thoughts: GLBC is a godsend in an area that is lacking in good beers. This is a wonderful beer, and I applaude their effort at making a high quality beer in each and every beer."
"On tap at the Tally Ho! Tavern in Bethlehem. Appears a dark black color with about a finger of creamy tan head. Smells and tastes of rich roasted grains, caramel, milk chocolate, cocoa, and bitter coffee. Very fresh tasting. Medium to full bodied, creamy and satisfying with medium carbonation. This is a great porter, check it out if you have the chance. I've had this in the past, but only out of the bottle. This is really nice on draft."
"A drinkable porter - very tasty."
"Have had this in bottles and on tap at the brewery. It pours a very dark brown, almost black color with a nice creamy tan head. Beautiful looking beer. The smell is also amazing, coffee and chocolate. The aroma is not too strong, just perfect. On first taste, it is of a medium thickness and tastes just like the smell. It is delicious! The aftertaste is strong of coffee. You can also taste some hop bitterness. This is an incredible beer! I love Great Lakes, and this is one of their best. Drinkability is high, but I couldn't have too many of these in one night. Do yourself a favor, and enjoy one of these!"
"Very nicely attenuated beer, this is a fine example of a Robust Porter."
"Medium-heavy body is creamy smooth like thick chocolate milk. The sweet cocoa is balanced by a touch of bright bitterness that could be hops or could be roast. In any case, the sip finished clean and leaves you wanting another."
"D - Exceptionally drinkable and balanced. Smooth, rich, and complex enough to remain interesting."
"Overall this is a delicious porter. It is very drinkable, I just wish you could find it in MA."
"Excellent drinkability. An excellent porter with exceptional flavor, not too stong on the abv so its easy to enjoy a couple, and it doesnt wreck your palate. Looking forward to having a couple more of these!!"
"A hearty mouthfeel, more than enough body for a porter. And how easy it went down. A great beer."
"I could drink these all night. Tasty stuff right here. Someone send me more."
"D - This is a very good beer that I really enjoyed and could drink a number of thes in one sitting worth finding to try"
"D: High. This is a great porter and my favorite from Great Lakes so far."
"I have grown to really enjoy this brewery out of Cleveland. I have yet to find a poor beer from them. Here I was thinking that I would have a hard time finding quality beer in Erie, PA. Not so, not so."
"D: This is one of my favorite beers, ever. Porters don't get much better than this."
"Again mouthfeel is spot on for a porter, medium to light bodied with a pretty pronounced, sharp carbonation. This adds to the drinkability for me a lot."
"Poured into a pint glass, just after the freshness date. Black with reddish hues near the bottom and sides, with a cream colored head that retains well, but not too much lacing. Smell is great - chocolate, toffee, caramel, with mild phenolic background. Taste is hoppy up front, but then warms up to a bitter/coffee background, and definitely some cream on the way down. Someone before described this as being very ""balanced."" Indeed it is. This is a great brew all around, especially if one needs a break from RIS's, as someone mentioned before also. With the low ABV, this is most definitely sessionable."
"D: This beer is lighter than I expected it to be. Not a huge beer, but big enough to be a good sipper. Pretty good for someone who is looking from a break from a big RIS, but doesn't want a lager."
"Great beer all the way around. Wonderful taste and body. Amazing drinkability considering the body and huge flavors. A staple at my house, good anytime. Don't hesitate. Best American Porter I've ever had. Outstanding."
"The feel is thick and creamy, almost like chocolate milk. It is hella good, even if a tad sweeter than normal."
"Okay, this is the last review of Great Lakes mixed case brews, and I saved my favorite for last, Edmund Fitzgerald Porter. Also happens to be a nostalgic little song from my youth as the 8-track tape containing this song was the first ""album"" I ever purchased, but I digress. The beer pours a nice deep, not quite opaque brown color with a nice light tan head that sticks around the sides of my glass quite nicely. There is no visible carbonation. The smell is of bittersweet chocolate covered cherries and toasty burnt toffee with hints of dark toast thrown in. There's almost no hops aroma evident. The taste mimics the scent with a very slight balance of lightly citrusy hops in the dry finish along with a touch of fading burnt chocolate with a slight alcohol presence. The feel is somewhat thinner than expected perhaps solidly in the medium range? This is a nicely drinkable beer, however, nothing overwhelming, nicely balanced and very tasty."
"From the bottle into a pint glass. Very dark, but still brownish. Big, chinky, thick head and thick lacing. Very attractive. Aroma of roasted malts, slightly smokey with a trace of hops. Very well balanced taste between the slightly bitter hops, roasted malt and almost chocolate sensation. Only slightly bitter so as to offset the cooked grains/malt. Medium bodied but very rich in flavor. Medium carbonation at best. Easy to drink and actually somewhat smooth. Enjoyable."
"It has been several years since I have tried a porter (the last time was Sierra Nevada's interpretation which I also found highly drinkable). It is still winter, and this quaffable porter is the perfect ale."
"All in all I highly recommend this stuff. It's cheaper than comparable porters like the aforementioned Flying Dog Gonzo Porter, which is about the same price but comes in a four pack rather than a six. And while it usually matches Bell's price, Bell's porters can't really compete here."
"Pours a pretty dark brown with an off white head. Roast, coffee and chocolate aroma. Chocolate, coffee, slight blackberry flavors. More carbonation than some for a porter. Still almost creamy though. Also a little more of a hop bite, and finishes crisp and clean. Could drink a ton of this no problem. All in all a real good porter, would recommend."
"D: Extremely drinkable beer, this is certainly a winner and one of my new favorite porters. The flavors are all mixed to perfection."
"Little bit of coffee up front, some toffee/butterscotch, but the main flavor carried is a grizzled cocoa flavor that just sits pleasantly on the palate. Hooray for chocolate burps! The dark roasted malts are just sweet enough to make for a very pleasant experience, but not so sweet as to be cloying and in the way. Slight hop kick at the end, but not much to that department. This is all about the chocolate. Overall pretty simple, a little thin without anything amazing happens. But it is a very easy drink, and the simplicity works in this case. Were this available to me, it would probably be a regular go-to beer. I wish we could get this here."
"D - Excellent for style, could go for a few more!"
"Big thanks to sholland for this one. Cracking the bottle i get a strong wiff of chocolate. It pours deep brown with receeding head that leaves lots of spotchy lacing. Smells of bitter chocolate, light coffee, and toasty almonds. Taste is coffee and bitter dark chocolate with a light hop presence that strengthens into the aftertaste. Could use some better blending of the taste and needs some thickness but overall a solid brew."
"a winner!"
"Definitely wish this was available here. One of the best American Porters I've had in a while."
"D- I would pick up a growler of this whenever possible."
"M/D - easy drinking smooth beer, very nice example of a porter that i'll look for again"
"D: Pretty high, hard to detect any alcohol, easy to drink"
"D- At 5.8% this one is quite sessionable and the great balance of flavors make this one a winner. While some porters come flat this one delivers and is worthy of all the praise. I just wish I could buy cases of this in my area."
"I definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a nice strong beer with distinct chocolate and coffee flavors."
"D - this is a very easy drinking beer for as ""big"" as it is."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and consistent, but a bit thin."
"This is how a porter should taste. Great Lakes, you've done it again."
" If not in actual ABV%, then by taste, is this too strong to be a session beer. It's not that tha alcohol comes out of nowhere, but the bitterness precludes this beer from being enjoyed at a fast pace. This isn't spicy or warming but rather, it's level of roasting is pretty much as good as it gets. The hops add a good level of depth to this and overall, this is a great beer for fall or winter. A worthy choice *out of the 8 beers I picked up on the run) to finish on..."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a very dark shade of brown with slight red highlights that are barely noticeable; the beer almost appears black. The beer has a nice creamy off-white head that leaves gobs of lacing on the glass. The nose is a nice smoky, roasted malt bouquet that seems slightly sweet. The flavor is a perfectly balanced, lightly smoked delight that is never harsh and goes down smooth. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a chewy carbonation. Overall a very drinkable beer and probably one of the better porters I've had."
"Notes: altogether a good porter. perhaps a little more carbonated than i would have liked, but its solid"
"This beer is very nice to sip on but I would not drink more than 2 back to back in a sitting as near the middle of the second one the afterbite is very powerful and the roastiness of the brew is intense."
"Mouthfeel is creamy from a nice dense head and slightly effervescent. Very pleasent, I think I'll have another..."
"Will be drinking both these 6 packs tonight"
"This is a solid porter, there is no doubt. The dark roasted coffee is done very well overall and is another great offering form Great Lakes that does not disappoint."
"The drinkability on this is relatively high, other than their oatmeal stout, this is my favorite beer in Great Lakes' lineup."
"D: Very drinkable due to the low ABV but still extremely flavorful and tasty. One of the best American Porters out there."
"Drinkability: An absolutely great porter worthy of a hearty winter's meal such a beef or pork roast, beef stew, or chili."
"Adhering to the Rheinheitsgebot can't hurt, as this 5.7% porter soon proved itself quite worthy. The pour was a good dark-honey/ruby-brown with a thin but retained lacey head and a mild malt aroma with roasted cashews(!) An initially sharp bite turns to a smooth and then flat carbonation with black licorice hints. A nice contender in the porter circles. Not my favorite, but definitely one I would be happy to enjoy anew."
"Overall a beautifully crafted porter. Looking forward to trying more from Great Lakes."
"A little bit different from what I was expecting, though. I was told that this was a good example of a good mico robust porter, but it tasted like it had some definite brown porter influence to me. I could have done with some more roasted flavors, but there is a sweetness that I have come to enjoy and identify with brown porters. Closer to Sam Smith's taddy porter than to a dry stout, let's just say."
"Infinitely drinkable. This, along with Anchor Porter, are benchmarks for the style. Never be without this one, if you love porter, and really, who doesn't?"
"(D) Fantastic! Pour me another! Potentially a good ""dark beer"" to introduce to ""light beer"" drinkers."
"D: Soooo good. You don't necessarily want more than two, though or your palate starts to sag."
"date consumed: 29 Oct 2008"
"D: I love American Porters, and this is definitely my favorite. Great Lakes puts out a lot of wonderful beers, but in my opinion this is their world-class standout."
"O: A superior porter, one of the best I have ever tasted. I can drink a number of these and not get tired of it. It goes down quite easy."
"I have never had a beer from Great Lakes and this one didn't let me down. Pick it up, it's worth it."
"Poures very brown to black with a large creamy light brown head. Aroma starts bitter and changes to sweet, chocolate, roast, and coffee. Good lacing and retains a small head the entire way. Body is a little thin. Oily mouthful. Unsweetened chocolate, coffee, and a great hop finish that leaves a sweet aftertaste. The malts become more prominant as this beer warms making it even more enjoyable.I love this beer, I keep a bottle or two on hand most of the time.THE BOMB!"
"If I hadn't known the ABV, I would have guessed less. Excellent value. Purchased this on sale for $6.99 / six. Comparable and inferior porters were being sold for $10.99 / six."
"D: I don't believe I've ever had such a drinkable, flavorful porter."
"Drinkability is very good. I don't see why this wouldn't be a perfect session beer. Great Lakes is a name which I greet with high expectations and thankfully this Edmund Fitzgerald was able to live up and perhaps exceed the standards that I have come to leave GL with."
"D: I despise coffee, yet I feel like I could drink most of a sixer of this stuff. That's saying something."
"Taste follows right along with the nose in in the deep roasty/smokey and chocolate presence buoyed by a lively carbonation and a pleasant light bitterness on the finish. A very smooth beer to drink and enjoy yet feels a hair thin - maybe it is just me. I would love it if this was a local brew."
"The taste then leads into a balanced mouthfeel that is interesting to say the least. There are times when you almost forget that you are drinking a porter and note a stout because the complex pairing of the malt and the coffee notes often bring to mind a nice coffee stout. However, there is a bit less creaminess to this porter than might be present in a stout and there is a smoothness that will keep you coming back."
"I'm so glad this beer is almost always available - it almost makes me take it for granted."
"(rated Sep 17, 2008)"
"Drinkability: High. This beer tastes great and goes down wonderfully. While it's still a little on the heavy side, it's easier to drink than some stouts because it doesn't sit very heavy in the stomach. I love this beer and can't wait to get some more."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Small bit of head, maybe 1 finger that disappeared rather quick except around the edge of the glass. Smells smokey with roasted malts and a hint of chocolate. Taste roasted malts and a bit of sweetness at the end. Mouthfeel is great, slight carbonation and medium bodied. Drinkability is high, very easy to drink porter. Leave you wanting more."
"The drink is perfectly-carbonated, medium in body, and highly quaffable. Edmund Fitzgerald is an outstanding porter that I'd certainly buy regularly if 'twas available in my marketplace. Many, many thanks to Dr. Brad for giving me the opportunity to give 'er a whirl!"
"Overall, I'm glad I gave this a second try. This is much better, as expected."
"D: Super drinkable porter. Despite low ABV, this doesn't feel weak at all. EFP used to be my ""go to"" porter back when I lived in Michigan. Brings back fond memories of drinking at Ashleys in Ann Arbor."
"Porters are one of my favorite styles, but this one is one of the best I've had. Great roasted flavors pull through, but don't leave the burnt bite at the end. Some nice cocoa flavor, but not sweet. Very smooth and creamy, but with a crisp mouthfeel. This beer is plenty drinkable. Highly recommend."
"D- It's a really good drinker. It had a great flavor without being overwhelming. I could put back a couple in a single sitting and come back to this when I'm in the mood for a regular American porter."
"A good beer for a rainy day, but not the best porter i've ever had.(out of a total of 3, ya thats it!)"
"I absolutely love the flavor. Very rich and aromatic. A unique beer while still falling under the name of Great Lakes Brewery. Maintained a nice and frothy head even though it was just in the bottle. I'm still more of a fan of the Dortmunder Gold but this one is a great choice as well if you're going with great lakes."
"Overall, not my favorite beer ever, but I'd choose it over a lot of other options. In my opinion, pretty good, but nothing I'd rave about. Perhaps I got a bad batch or something, because - reading other people's reviews have showed some very different impressions than I've gotten. I'll try this again some time, and see if it's different."
"Pours a deep dark brown color, lots of ruby highlights when held to the light, foamy one-finger tan head fades into a thin ring around the beer, spots of lacing down the sides of the glass. Lots of milk chocolate and coffee on the nose, slightly charred aroma. Some bitter black coffee flavors, some chocolatey sweetness, all nicely burnt around the edges. Medium-bodied, somewhat creamy with pretty active little bubbles. This is a great American Porter, something I'd want to have in the house often."
"If you like any of the following: hops, chocolate, coffee, porter, or beer then you should agree that the Edmund Fitzgerald is one of the most satisfying pints you could ask for. And if you like any of those things, and have yet to try this beer, then I suggest you do. You won't regret it."
"This is sooo smooth - a little light but one of the best!"
"D- Very drinkable and nice beer, I'll seek out again."
"Bottle thanks to Daniel. I've been waiting for this beer for some time! Pours a dark black with lots of ruby colors coming through when light shines in. A medium light brown head. The aroma is very nice; tons of chocolates, roasted malt, and loads of milk coffee. A very nice flavor; lots of sweet and rich roasted malts, some nutty aspects, light milk coffee and chocolates, and all of it is well balanced by a smooth hop finish. A creamy and full mouthfeel. Excellent."
"Drinkability: One of the better porters I've ever tried, and rating to style brings this one way, way up. I'm not a porter man, but this is a damn good beer. 5.8% abv? Nothin' doin'. This is one sessionable beer, and a well-made one at that; great flavors, great aromas, nice appearance ... give it a shot."
"Notes: This is one hell of a porter! It looks great, smells great, tastes great, and feels great. What the hell else could you possibly ask for? By far, the best porter I've ever had. This one will be a staple in my diet from now on, no doubt about it."
"D: Soooo smooth and very drinkable. Flavor profile is incredible. I could see a wide variety of beer drinkers, from geek to guzzler, enjoying this one."
"Has more bold character but still amazingly drinkable. They served it too cold at the brewery. This beer really doesn't start delivering the goods until it warms up nicely. Enjoy!"
"Drank straight from the bottle on a Sunday night. Pours dark brown with a hint of amber. Smells really good; like chocolate, roasted nuts, a little mocha, and other dark brown, strong foods. The taste is the same as the smell, to the T. Strong nut, mocha, and chocolate taste. Very tasty and very smooth. The beer was smooth and consistent all the way to the last sip. This was one of my first Great Lakes Beers and it has definitely turned me on to this brewing company as well as to this Porter. Really like this beer."
"Poured a dark brown / red color with a medium sized, tan head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of roasted malts, bakers chocolate, light smoke, and a bit of caramel malt. Taste was sweet chocolate, more caramel, fudge, roasted malts, and some nuts, but really reminded me of a tootsie roll."
"This beer pours very dark brown with slight hints of amber. A nice almost foamy head that stuck around until the last sip. The aroma was one of the best aspects of this fine porter. Almost overwhelming Chocolate/Espresso aromas with a hint of smoke. The flavor of this matched the taste - fantastic blend of chocolate, espresso, smoke flavoring that really left me wanting MORE! It was almost stout like. Mouthfeel is of light carbonation, and smoothness. I could sit down with this one for an evening!"
"D: Very drinkable and highly sessionable."
"D: This beer is very nice. This is absolutely the best drinking porter I have ever had. Just so easy to drink. the flavors are very nice, aroma is good, feel is great, its pretty. This porter is balla. If I had local access, absolutely would keep this as a session. Drink it if you can."
"Great beer, will have another one .... you should try it."
"D- A very tasty pick. Easily one of the best porters. Get you some."
"Hats off to Great Lakes Brewing..."
"This beer pours a very dark brown color with slight ruby highlights around the edges with an inch of creamy head on it. The lacing on this beer is impressive and stayed for the entire beer. The first scents are of coffee, chocolate, and roasted grain. The smell is comforting on this cool evening. The flavor profile is spot on when I think of a porter. I get loads of dark roasted grain, caramel, coffee, and a slight chocolate taste, and a touch of hop bitterness as well. The mouthfeel though I think has a bit much carbonation, and could be toned down a bit. I am not really bothered by it, but I think it could be toned down a bit. The drinkability is very nice and would be a great session porter."
"A very nice porter. Right up there with anchor as one of the best porters made that is not in the imperial style and not aged in oak. Very good beer."
"Poured in to an English pint-style glass, the color reminds me more of a deep, black stout. Aroma is slightly alcoholy and definitely burnt. The taste is roasty and chocolatey. Overall, this is a great beer. I'm glad I had the opportunity to taste this one."
"Poured from bottle into tulip glass. Pours black with deep brown edges. Off-white head with good retention and lacing. Smell seemed to be a bit muted, woke up a little as the beer warmed though. Smells of dark chocolate and coffee grounds. Taste was good. Some deep burnt grain, touch of grass or straw, some bakers chocolate and the dominant flavor was coffee. Mouthfeel was fine, a little on the light side, almost a touch watery but fine. This was a very drinkable beer. I think the thinner mouthfeel helps out with that along with the reasonable ABV. A very nice beer."
"Overall: Very good beer...not the best porter I've had...but a try beer for me."
"Dark brown/black color with ruby red highlights and a huge, fluffy, tan head. Nice retention and good lacing on this one. Nice roasted malt aroma, and plenty of hop character in the nose. Bitter chocolate throughout, coffee, toffee, burnt caramel and nice hop bitterness on the finish. A bit astringent, but not overly so. Flavors start to open up as it warms and gets better with every sip. Thick, creamy mouthfeel, average carbonation. Probably the best porter I've ever had. Very nice. Great Lakes does it again."
"Future outlook: Repeat business imminent."
"Very drinkable. Outstanding brew all the way around. Very enjoyable."
"This is one of my favorite beers, I find it very drinkable and although a heavy brew i still find my self being able to drink 2-3 and not feel full."
"Glad I followed the ratings system here to try this one."
"A good, complex beer, but the hops, though flavorful, are a little overdone for a Porter in my opinion, American or otherwise. I'm a little bored with the idea that what makes any style ""American"" is dumping an assload of hops into it."
"A full two fingers of rocky tan head easil reaches the top of my maudite goblet. Body is a true stout blackness. Nose is big and toasty with tons of chocolatey malt, a bit of meaty smoke, soft and attractive. I am quickly reminded of why this beer gets so much praise. With first sip you get many lovely layers of delecious complexity. Coco, dark fruit, rich malt carmel, and dry minerals all come so smooth and easy for this beer. A bit of fruity souredness is there on the mouthfeel but not harsh, actually very good. It then turns considerably thick. Very nicely drinkable, sessionable porter."
"This is one hell of an easy drinking porter. The flavors are delicious, well-balanced, and easy on the palate."
"Overall a very smooth and drinkable porter."
"D - this is one of the best porters I have had in a while. Simply delicious. I'm sad I only have one, as I'd love to just drink these more and more as fall continues to arrive. Highly recommended"
"This what happens when a brewer doesn't try to reinvent the wheel and just makes a damn good beer."
"A damn good Porter - I always come back to this beer after trying other Porters - it never disappoints. Dark brown in the glass with a medium tan head that slowly recedes to a thin film that stays with the beer until finished - very nice. Roasted coffee, caramel and tree bark smells. Most of these smells carry over to the palate with a bitter chocolate note becoming prominent on the back end. This is a highly drinkable beer - having three or four in a night is not a problem. My bench mark Porter and my favorite beer from Great Lakes."
"Drinkability - Definetly the best porter I've ever had, extremely impressed by Great Lakes now! Flavor was amazing and I really enjoyed the chocolate and coffee combo, well blended. Looking forward to more Great Lakes!"
"D: One of my favorite GLBC beers. It still tastes a little thin to me to considerate it to be an exceptional near, but one of the best porters I've had regardless."
"that being said, this beer goes down very easy. good aftertaste. the malts stay with ya on this one. and i mean that in the best way. a good porter, not the best ive had. but still good."
"D Goes down like water. Decent stuff, though I'm not a huge fan. However, if I was in the mood to drink 9 porters in a night, this would work."
"The drinkability is sky high. A sipper that goes down easy and is a pleasure too drink. Highly recommended. I will be drinking this beer for years to come. I would really like to try this Porter on draught or even better on cask."
"Like a fine bitter chcolate I wouldn't want too much of this as it is kind of a tastebud overload. But a few would be fine."
"This beer pours black with a short head that leaves nice lacing on the glass. Smells of coffee, chocolate and malt. The taste is is coffee and chocolate and bitter roasted malts. The mouthfeel is creamy and nicely carbonated. Overall a great easy drinking porter with high drinkability. I could drink this all night."
"d - this is one terrific porter"
"It's just the taste I couldn't get into! I must be the only person on Earth who isn't wildly raving about this beer. The porter I had previous to this one was Sixpoint's Carob (aka Black Market), and I liked it much, much better. This seemed more like a hop-head's porter--which is cool, just not my style. Having said that, this very well may be a beer too under my amateur radar, one I taste five years later and do a complete 180 review of."
"Heard this one was an award winner so I gave it a shot as soon as I saw it. Out of the bottle this one was a genuine black with a tan head. Sticky, creeping lace all over the glass and good retention of the chunky cap. Sweet nose unlike most American Porters, milk chocolate, caramel and hints of vanilla. Complex flavors, milk chocolate again, 'dark' fruit, hints of coffee and vanilla with a hoppy bitterness at the end. Good mouthfeel, creamy and smooth. Slightly lighter body than most of this ilk and low carbonation combine to make it very drinkable. After doing some homework on this beer after the fact I am of the opinion there's good reason to believe this is the best American Porter in the US and certainly in the top five."
"Overall: excellent"
"Thanks to blisscent for the opportunity to try this one. Best by 12/1/08 indicated on the bottle. Served in a tulip. Pour was the color of cola with a 1.5 inch rocky, effervescent, tan head that eventually settled into a soapy skim. Some lacing, but weak legs. Lots of tiny bubbles adhered to the bowl of the glass. Nose was chocolate malt and dark fruit. More chocolate malt in the mouth as well as a slight hops bittering, but no fruit detected on the palate. Mouthfeel was light-bodied, watery and quite effervescent. Easy drinking porter. Flavorful, but a little weak for my preference."
"D- A very nice solid porter. A solid example of the style with a nice balance of dryness/sweetness."
"Bottle Artwork - The ship the beer is named after is seen sailing on a dark rough night at sea... Ominous and mysterious like the beer itself... Nothing too exciting, but the bottle and label match this beer well..."
"Pours a very dark brown color with a small yet tight tan head; settled into a ring. The aroma is of semi-sweet chocolate, stale mocha, and a touch of raisins. The taste is more of bitter chocalate, slightly burnt black coffee, vanilla, and raisins. The feel is well bodied, chewy, with softer carbonation, finishes dry with a roasted malt bitterness. This drinks very well for a porter. It has an easy drinking mentality with stout body. Best by far of the Great Lakes brews. Very well made."
"D: It is fall, cool, and this beer is perfect. Get some"
"Pours a solid brown with dark ruby highlights when held to the light. Smallish tan/white head that laces the glass all the way down. Aromas of cocoa, roast coffee, chocolate, and some restrained hops in the back. Smells wonderful! Taste is a roasted chocolaty coffee and citrus hops. I taste a bit of dark dried fruit towards the end that fades into a roast bitterness to finish. Creamy and oily mouthfeel. Great porter, I wish I could get this one locally!"
"D: Pretty high for a porter. Fairly light bodied, but strong in taste."
"D: Better than many since cherry and dark fruit flavors are nice and subtle."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a dark brown, with a creamy light brown head. Smells of chocolate and coffee, and tastes about the same. Good medium to full body with a creamy feel. Taste sticks around, which is nice. Very nice intro to GLBC. Beer Club favorite for March 2008 tasting."
"D Not high on drinkability for me."
"D-An excellent porter, but unfortunately I only bought a single."
"D-I wouldn't mind having a fewe more of these. Very nice porter."
"Solid take on a porter. A bit too heavy on the coffee flavor for my tastes, otherwise well drinkable."
"The lighter mouthfeel is what keeps this from a stout...it is that tasty! Great brew from GL!"
"I'd drink this all night, wonderfull stuff!"
"This is a great beer with a nice smooth mouthfeel and finish. Could drink these all night."
"Amazing beer. This would be a regular in my fridge if it were only available here. Maybe someday.."
"This is a great beer; a solid porter with a great balance of fruit and darker flavors."
"This is a memorable porter with a distinctive flavor. It has a dark black-coffee color with a slight head that laces nicely on the glass. The aroma is subtle roasted chocolate, which carries over to the front of the palate. Nicely carbonated, with a smoky chocolate taste that builds to a robust coffee bitterness on the finish, followed by a bitter aftertaste that lingers in the back of the mouth. Rather drinkable for a porter, but the carbonation slows it down a bit. Overall, a very nice porter."
"Dark brown in color with a nice frothy sheet of head on top. Taste is roasted malt, some chocolate and coffee. There are surprisingly quite a bit of hops present. Medium mouthfeel with a little bit of bitterness. Great beer, very sessionable."
"Drinkability: Porter is not my favorite style, but according to the style this one is very drinkable, definitely would fit into any rotation on a night of drinking."
"A golden brown head complements this extremely opaque beer. The smell is your typical porter, lots of malts with coffee and chocolate undertones. Taste is very good. Malt and coffee dominate the taste, with a rather bittersweet finish. The beer was somewhat heavy and very smooth with only a slight fizziness. Overall this beer was excellent and is a definite recommendation to a fan of porters. Would definitely drink again."
"Overall: A very tasty, well-balanced porter for those looking for a non-extreme, but well-crafted beer."
"Fantastic porter, robust and full absolutely awesome. Pours a thick sticky black with a creamy tan head that lasts. The aroma is filled with dark malts and just a touch of floral hops, it is rather mild especially compared to the flavor. Once you dig into this robust porter the flavor immediately grabs you. Malts o' plenty round out the dominant flavor consisting of coffee, chocolate, and plenty of roasted malts. The floral hops become slightly more hidden beneath the intense flavor. Mouthfeel is filling and creamy. One of my favorite local brews that satisfies on tap as well as poured into a glass straight from the bottle. In my opinion this is one of Great Lakes Brewing Co's masterpieces."
"Pours a deep nearly black color with cola brown highlights and mahogany edges. A nice fluffy khaki head holds on nicely. Smells of chocolate and toasted grainy bread, burnt caramel and toffee, with a smooth full roasted balance. Taste starts off with a nice round roasted malt flavor, building with dark toasted whole grain bread and bitter chocolate. Finishes with burnt wood and some roasty bitterness. Feel is medium bodied with smooth carbonation. Kind of a slick stickiness at the finish. Very tasty. Easy to drink a lot, but full and flavored enough to be satisfied without having much more."
"M/D: not too thin for a porter and pretty easy to put down. Only a faint trace of alcohol. I could drink me a few of these."
"Opinion: This is a pretty darn good Porter. The ashy finish turns me off a little, but it isn't overpowering. I like some of the other American Porters better, but this one sure isn't bad. I would definitely drink it again."
"One of the best porters I've ever had."
"D- when im looking for something thats hopless, this is going to be one of my first choices. i could easily kill half a sixer or more in a single sittting."
"D: This beer is once again amazing, a little worse for wear when sampled out of the bottle but still a fantastic beer. Dangerously drinkable and would have scored higher if I had not already had this one on tap."
"Nice job on this one, very quaffable without being boring."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Smokestack goblet. This beer pours a dark espresso brown with just a thin beige head that subsided into a just a thin line along the edges of the glass. The aroma is chocolate, coffee and vanilla. The taste is wonderful. Full roasted malts and chocolate in the front with the astringency of coffee coming out on the tail. The mouthfeel is great. Much fuller then most porters, feels almost like a stout. This is an extremely drinkable porter, probably one of the best I've had."
"drinkability - Great Lakes have good stuff. Real nice porter. Would buy this again if it was in my area."
"Edit: With the last sip, the hops come across as a bit oily or gritty tettnanger-like. Nice combination."
"Opaque body, the head tinted with tan. The aroma is big on power, lots of semi-sweet chocolate and mild roasted coffee notes. Great flavor too, very well rounded and goes down easy. Again, semi-sweet chocoalte with a roasted edge. At times, it reminds me of licking chocolate cake batter off the mixer. I'll have another please, but I'll need to drive 30 miles to find the (rare) store that carries these locally."
"Now this is a sessionable porter. I am unsure whether I like this or Anchor Porter more in the American Porter category. Amazing stuff. I'm usually hesistant to buy a whole six pack of something I haven't really tried but I'm really glad I did with this one. The only thing that bums me out is that I have to make a trip to Illinois to get it. We need this stuff in Northwest Indiana!"
"Me thinks that Saucya sent this baby to me, so thanks!!!! Pours a dark, dark brown out of the bottle into a shaker pint. Nice aromas of chocolate and burnt malts. Flavor is nice and rich for a porter. Good amounts of chocolate, some sweetness and very smooth dark malt finish. Medium to full bodied and very drinkable. Good session porter!"
"D- What an awesome porter, i would buy a case of this come the winter time if this was available in NJ!"
"D: A nice drinking porter, rich, dark and respectable."
"Pours out a dark redish brown, light tan head and great lacing. Nose- powdered chocolate milk, red fruits and faint roast. Taste- medium to light bodied with relatively high carbonation. Figs, raisins, dark chocolate and burnt toast. Finish is quite burnt. Initially I thought this brew was light on flavour but grows on me through the course of the bottle and it warming up. Very nice porter and I lift my glass to Gordon Lightfoot for bringing back memories on his haunting song whilst enjoying this fine porter."
"Overall, a porter with a well balanced flavor profile, worth seeking if you are a fan of the style."
"Enjoy by date of 10/19/08. Pours a nice dark caramel color, smells of caramel. Tastes of bitter chocolate, coffee. The bitterness balances out the flavor. Not a heavy mouthfeel, greater than your typical macro brew but nothing heavy. Very nice taste and very drinkable too. An exceptional brew."
"Nice strong roasted barly, strong bitterness present, little astringent aftertaste, wonderful creamy feel that helps you savor it. This one really satifsies. This is a solid porter and one I often compare other porters up against. Not sure why more micros don't make classic porters like this."
"goes down smooth and has a slight creamy texture to it. Nice balance of flavors. One of my more favorite beers from this brewery. Pairs great with any Randy Newman album...WOW!"
"D - A surprisingly sessionable beer. The roast isn't too strong."
"D - You could could a few of these back in an evening, but this is a very heavy beer, so you couldn't drink too many. Has enough flavor complexities to keep the drinker from ever getting board of the taste. A very solid porter,but would like to see better lacing, perhaps just a bad batch.... Will try another."
"Highly drinkable. Wish I had more than one!"
"D - I could drink this all night"
"D: I passes this up on tap once. Never again."
"12 oz bottle: Pours an almost opaque black color with little to no head. Aroma is deep dark chocolate and a light coffee note as well. A nice roasted caramel malt characteristic as well, but I'm not really detecting a ""bold hop presence"" as it says in the description. Taste is wonderful that's where this beer comes through. Lovely chocolate and roasted malt characteristic as warming on the body and the coffee flavor comes through. Aftertaste is really good as well with a lingering chocolate/coffee taste that makes this a really nice porter. Overall, Dang this stuff is good. I would buy it again in a heart beat."
"Notes: Outstanding. This porter is one of my personal favorites, with a wonderful balance of flavors and drirkability. I would highly recommend this as a stand alone drink or even pairing it with your favorite chocolate."
"Overall a drinkable beer and one of the best porters I have had to date."
"D - I could drink this all day long."
"Pours an extremely dark brown color with a nice brown head. Has a really attractive roasted malt aroma that begs you to drink. Flavor is malty blend of chocolate and coffee that is nicely balanced with a significant hops presence. The mouthfeel is very pleasant and the drinkability is very high."
"I love dark beers... but the ones that I taste and have a desire to session are few and far between. At nearly 6% that would be a helluva drunken session, but here's to a beer that is great at what it is, non-assuming, and just fantastic. A favorite."
"Really a great porter, a strong addition to an often overlooked style."
"The beer has a medium to heavy mouthfeel, and on taste alone a very high drinkability."
"D - A superior brew. Ridiculously drinkable, extremely tasty, well that's about it."
"The body is moderate with a light carbonation. This is just an off flavored beer. You could say it's little fishy."
"Thanks John.."
"D- Very solid brew and really easy to drink."
"D : One of my favorite porters to have."
"I was initially surprised at the level of carbonation, but pleasantly. Not too much. Nice dry, roasty nut maltiness with a moderate sweetness. A ""parched"" aftertaste similar to that of black coffee. This beer sticks around your palate for a while - thankfully, given how much I enjoyed it."
"D - Drinkability is very good. There is nothing in the beer that is completely overwhelming making for a great all around beer. Alcohol is hard to detect. Highly recommended brew if you can get it."
"A tasty take on the style."
"Thanks to saucya for this one! Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Dark with a small head that fizzles away quickly. Aroma of roasted malt, chocolate, and that's about it. While the aroma lacks, the taste makes up for it quite a bit. Tons of chocolate and roasted malt, with a little bit of sweetness in the finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium. Drinkability is quite high as I could definitely put down several of these with ease. Not exactly a complex beer, but fuck, who needs that all the time? Overall, this is a solid, pleasurable beer."
"Drinks too easy, there would be no problem sessioning on this. A very well put together & tasty porter! Supposed lack of freshness didn't hurt this beer at all"
"A very good porter. I only wish it was available in my area."
"This is probably my favorite staple brew from the GLBC and is just a damn fine American Porter, chock full of roasty notes, lip smacking sweetness, and easy drinkibility. It's always an easy recommendation for this one."
"D- Pristine to the style."
"12 oz bottle. Pours very dark, looks black til you hold it up to the light and see some hints of ruby, 2 cm of a light tan head that is slowly diminishing. Aroma is malty, bitter chocolate, dark fruits, and some coffee as it warms. Initial flavor is sweet chocolate and coffee. Flavor ends similarly, but with some malts and hops to complicate the flavor, let leaving it balanced. Some lacing, limited carbonation, medium body, and limited alcohol presence. Overall a drinkable beer and the best regular octane beer that Great Lakes puts out."
"D: This is a very nice porter in the English tradition, not very hoppy, this is a malt dominated beer. Any fan of darker/roasty beers should give this a try. Another great one from Great Lakes, I love this brewery."
"Excellent brew. I'm glad I bought a 6 pack."
"D: As sessionable porters go, this is near the top of the list. I could easily drink a few of these in an evening and I would seek it out."
"D: Opened my eyes a bit, I will try more porters. Very drinkable."
"Very drinkable. I'd like to have more, but they're not available in my area, I received a six pack from a friend who used to live in Cleveland."
"Pours a nice dark brown/nearly black color, although with little head and a bit of lacing. Excellent scent, a nice burnt grain aroma with mild coffee hints. Excellent taste as well, a good porter with wonderful coffee overtones and a nice partly bitter aftertaste. Goes down nice, a good porter overall."
"D: Very good drinkability. A nice, roasted taste that was complimented by a nice, smooth mouthfeel. A nice session beer."
"D: very smooth. Perhaps the most solid porter that I have had. Great representation on the style."
"D_One of the best porters I have had. thanks to pimpp for the opportunity to try."
"Really great brew..."
"Mouthfeel is superb. Lingers with a decent roasted bitterness for a quite a while. Medium bodied, though I do think it is a little bit over carbonated. Overall amazing beer."
"drinkability is decent. this is thin in body for a porter, but the flavors here are concentrated enough to provide excellent complexity. a solid porter."
"Drinkability as good as anything you'll find for the style; I could drink a sixer, though the last two might be pushing it."
"M/D - Medium bodied creaminess. Lightly carbonated. Very drinkable porter."
"Nothing objectionable here and goes down smooth. A good porter but I personally prefer Anchor."
"Try this beer, and you will understand porter."
"I'm revisiting this after way too long. This beer, IMO, is as close as you can get to perfection for the style. Smoky, chocolatey, and roasty in brilliant balance, with a light caramel presence, a little bit of a green hop character, a little licorice and fruitiness. Exceptional nose IMO. The palate is roasty up front, with some dark chocolate, a little coffee and a faint hint of smoke. A little caramel comes through on the mid-palate. Drying, roasty and with a little licorice on the finish, this beer is a little bit like The Abyss. Medium-light in body with an acidity that's a blend of grain, roast and carbonic acid, this beer is marvelous on the palate. My original scores were way too low, this is, IMO, the best porter out there."
"Moderately astringent ending, but very drinkable. Rich and full body makes this an easy one to have disappear when you turn around and look away for a second!"
"D - great tasting, highly drinkable porter."
"Overall one of the better porters I've had, very drinkable and an exemplar of the style."
"D, notes: Substantial but easy drinking. This is clearly a great beer for many reasons: complex, well balanced, excellent taste, much character."
"Taste & mouthfeel - Drier than the nose suggests. A hint of caramel is present beneath flavors of dark chocolate, coffee and toast. Very silky and smooth with a medium body. Coffee-like dryness in the finish. One of the better porters I've tried."
"Edmund Fitzgerald pours a very dark, almost black color with nice ruby highlights when held to the light. The large, tan head sticks around for a while and leaves a lot of lacing in its wake. The nose is mostly sweet coffee. The taste starts with rich, roasted malt with a long, bitter aftertaste. The carbonation is a nice, medium level though the beer felt a bit more watery than I would have liked. Overall, this is a very drinkable porter. I could easily have a few of these over the course of a night."
"It has good drinkability I could handle a few of these a night"
"Drinkability- Normally I would give this beer about a 4 or 4.5 on drinkability, but this time I have to give it a 1. I couldn't even finish this one. No more of these today. Shame on you Brixx Ice Company, shame on you. Cleanliness is important with tap handles. I guess some bars are only in it for the swilling needs."
"d- easy to drink, a good sipping beer, will def have this one again"
"I've had some other unbalanced porters recently that had TOO MUCH roasted aromas and tastes. Not the Fitz. Just enough to make it taste like a porter, but not too much to make it a one pint only affair."
"Dark brown pour with a slightly transluscent look to it, giving it a ruby tint. Nice tan head. Chocolate and coffee roast dominate the aroma as to be expected here. Flavor is solid, with a standard roastiness and bittersweet chocolate like flavor, but the body is a tad thin. Nicely balanced beer, good flavor, and enjoyable, but could benefit from a bit more body. Very much worth trying."
"I am rating this beer for what it is -- a sessionable porter. It's not going to be mindblowing, and nor will be an entirely unique offering. It is the type of beer that invites you to toss down three in a couple of hours. Maintains a robust porter taste in your mouth for 30 minutes after the bottle; but doesn't overpower you during drink. I am very happy to see this beer in the Top 100, despite the fact that it's not a barnburning 11% stout. This is a pure porter; what comes to mind when one thinks a standard, rich afternoon beer. Top quality."
"D- It's great to see a top 100 beer that is not so extreme. I've gotten tired of giant bash your face in stouts and imperial porters where I feel like i've been hit by a freight train after each sip. This is a welcome break from that complexity and just brings to the table a simple, good porter. Definitely an excellent session beer, I would not hesitate to seek this out again and again."
"D= I really love this beer and would go out of my way to have more!"
"A fine porter for sure."
"D - A very nice porter indeed. I would drink this on a very regular basis if it was available here."
"D-Very drinkable, smooth and just the right amount of carbonation, probably the best Porter I have tasted so far."
"HV"
"Maybe a little too much carbonation for me, but otherwise, nearly perfect mouthfeel. Medium bodied, on the light, but it should be. Super long finish wiht the coffee sticking around forever. A more drinkable porter I could not imagine."
"Eventhough porters are not my favorite style, if more of them were like this I would probably change my mind. A pleasure to drink and worth the trip to the beer store."
"No flaws in this one, very drinkable, but the slight drying of your tongue after each drink would catch up with you after a while."
"This beer had a beautiful color in the glass, deep brown and tan. Its nose primarily featured a strong coffee presence. The taste also had strong coffee notes with chocolate, and cigar toward the end. Also a distinct malt flavor, very tasty. A lot of depth to this brew, many layers. Another great beer by Great Lakes Brewing Co. I'm beginning to really like this brewery!"
"Pours dark brown with a medium brown stiff foamy head. The aroma is huge with coffee with creamer and chocolate. The flavor is full of coffee and choclate with big time bitterness. Creamy mouthfeel. Average carbonation. This is really a wonderful beer."
"I am now a porter drinker if I can get 'em like this"
"D: quite drinkable, goes down easy."
"Pours a very dark brown that shows clear when help up to light. Minimal nose that isn't really that impactful. Very coffee toned on the flavor with a thick malt presence. Feel has an excited carbonation and the liquid is about standard. A very nice brew that I am glad to have been able to try."
"Medium bodied and silky smooth. The right carbonation for the job. This is a nice sipper to savor, and would go well with most chocolate or vanilla desserts. Really a great weekend/vacation breakfast brew too, now that I think of it."
"Best beer I have from Great Lakes along with their Blackout Stout, wish I had a case of these to get me through the next cold weeks of February, highly recommended, cannot wait to try more of this soon, no doubt about it that this one belongs on the top one hundred list"
"Pours a light black with deep ruby highlights. Nice white/light tan head that retains quite well with great lace. Nose is amazing and smells of roasted malt and some coffee bean. Taste is probably the best american porter I have ever had. Lovely roasted malt with some great coffee bean and slight smoke flavors. mouthfeel is great but could be a touch thicker. Incredibly drinkable and one I will most certainly revisit. Awesome! mad props to mike for including two of these as extras, and that wasnt even all of them! Badass."
"cheers!"
"Very English-inspired. I still can't get over how big the nose is without huge bubbles to carry it. Seek and consume."
"Drinkability: A quality, well-balanced porter that's full of flavor and easily drinkable."
"it looks awesome though, and is decent, especially for the price. ($7 for a 6pack)"
"D- u know what it iz."
"Not a big fan of the style. Porters always remind me of watered down stouts. But this is one of the better ones I've tried. It has enough flavour and robust malt to satisfy."
"thanks to barefootbrewer for sharing this top 100 beer with me."
"This brew poured a thick oily black with a ½ tan colored head  unfortunately it didnt last long. The aroma is sweet and malty with caramel and molasses notes quite apparent. The taste is bold with roasted flavors and coffee flavors noticeable. The mouthfeel is quite full, but not chewy. It supports the flavors quite well. I think this is a very enjoyable porter that is one of those brews that is very compelling."
"It's not the most complex blending, but it's flavorful, well integrated, and robust. If you're a porter fan, not to be missed. I do wish it had a bit much more of an aroma to it; mainly malt and some coffee notes."
"Drinkability  very drinkable, I could have a few of these."
"I will be keeping this around my beer fridge constantly now. Very nice."
"D- I wavered on the drinkability of this one. At first I thought it was great, as I workled my way through I kinda thought I was done with this one, but when I reached the end I thought that was good I could go for another. Having said that I decided to go with the 4.0 becasue int he end I guess it is good."
"The beer pours a jet black with a very faint garnet glow when held to a bright light. The head is moderate, tan colored and leaves nice lacing. The aroma is highly malty with a hint of earthy hop and rather complex; chocolate, roast coffee, and caramel sweetness. The flavor is intensely malty, initially chocolate malt and roast coffee, then bittersweet with an earthy hop flavor and the roasty flavor returns after the swallow. The body is medium-full and carbonation moderate. The beer is rather smooth aside from a slight hop/acidic prick at the swallow. Overall all around a great porter, definitely recommend if you enjoy porters, one of, if not the best porter Ive had."
"Overall really great porter. I am a fan"
"Excellent porter, like I previously stated...best I have ever had in my short time in the craft beer world. I loved the lore that is the Edmund Fitzgerald, ""The lake it is said, never gives up her dead...", and I love this porter."
"The best porter I have ever had, period."
"Smell asserted itself nicely with plenty of unsweented cocoa. Very little, if any coffee or caramel, or any of the other nuances that typically accompany one another in a beer of this sort. This one seemed to me to be nearly exclusively unsweetened cocoa powder with a bit of roasted grain hiding in there some place. I didn't find the smell of this particularly complex, but it was pleasant nevertheless. Taste was mildly sweet with the cocoa from the smell asserting itself in the taste, as well. The sweetness quickly waned and turned pleasantly bitter, then a lovely dry, roasted cereal grain flavour. This is a nice porter. Mouthfeel is neither too heavy nor too thin. Quite drinkable. If you enjoy porters you should certainly have a go this."
"The drinkabilty on this is great as I have to say this is one porter that is balanced very well and one that I could drink repeatedly. This is something rare as most porters leave me only wanting 1, maybe 2, but this is one that I could easily see myself drinking again and again."
"Great beer in the winter. Could drink a few of these, which is all one would really want out of a porter."
"Overall: A fine example of a style that is difficult to do well."
"Drinkability- This is a great beer and I cant imagine not being able to sit down and guzzle a six pack. Its got everything a Porter should have. Solid beer that I cant wait to have constant access to when I move back home to Chicago. Deschutes Black Butte does now indeed have a replacement! Thanks again to BeerTruth!"
"D: Just a damn good porter. Very tasty, sessionable, and a staple in my fridge."
"D - Great beer, you can never go wrong with this one."
"D - I really regret that I only got two in the trade and will be working out future trades for much larger quantities..this is a beer that would make me consider relocating"
"Pours jet black with a light tan head. In the aroma, a big roasty malt, with hints of cocoa and caramel. In the taste, roasty malt, a nice coca presence and a nice ending hop presence too. A smooth bitterness, medium body mouthfeel and a roasty malt and cocoa aftertaste. Fantastic porter, nice hop presence."
"This caramel black colored porter from GLBC of Cleveland Ohio is remarkable. So often porters are dull and sludgy, but not here.Rich lacing, pleasant nose, and an exciting quaff. Taste is toasted-full without any rough edges. This is a porter that is full of life and soul. Bravo."
"Pitch black liquid with a thick tan head. Little retention and no lacing. Sweet chocolate malt and good porter smell. There's a slight hint of piney hops lingering. Chocolate porter taste that leaves a dry taste on the palate. Nice big malt chewy feel. A great porter. Definitely worth it."
"D - I probably couldn't find a more drinkable dark ale. This is a world class beer through and through. One of my favorite styles and Great Lakes nails it. This is a classic American porter w/ excellent drinkability."
"Pours dark brown with a quarter inch off white head; just like a porter should. Aroma is filled with roasted dark malt, coffee, and chocolate. The flavor is pretty damn good. Roasted malt and coffee lead this bad boy off and they're followed up by a bit of chocolate and a tiny touch of caramel. The aftertaste features the chocolate more prominently. There is a bit of detectable carbonation on the tongue and it has a medium to heavy body. All around a great sessionable beer."
"Hear me now and listen to me later, BUY THIS BEER NOW GIRLYMAN!!!"
"Wow. This could be my everyday brew."
"This is the first beer I've had from Great Lakes Brewing Co and so far I'm impressed. Really good flavors but not too overpowering."
"D: Great. I could have a few of these quite easily."
"The taste is big roasted and caramel malt and chocolate notes with a nice thick mouthfeel and light carbonation. More sips in and there's a mild infusion of hop bitterness that takes the edge off the sweetness a bit and it does a nice job of it. Wonderful bitterish aftertaste going on here. Wow. Tasty as heck but so damn smooth drinking and for me, someting I'd consider quite sessionable. I can't get over how nice the chocolate is in this Porter and how well all the flavours work together. I just found my new favourite example of the style, me thinks. This is one that certainly deserves to be sought out! Thanks again, Dave!!"
"D- I can't help but drink this one fast and wish I had more in the fridge. The perfect tasting porter in my opinion."
"It has a deep color that is nearly black, and poured a modest head into my pint glass. The aroma of chocolate and coffee was readily evident before tasting, more so upon consumption. I found it rich and enjoyable, but not a beer that I would have a few of in a row. Its flavors are strong, and can be balanced nicely with a clean ale before or afterward to highlight its distinct aroma and taste."
"As for drinkability, if someone gave me one i would certainly drink it, but for me, this one is quite forgettable with so many other wonderful choices out there. just average in my opinion. I would choose Black Butte Porter by Deschutes every single time over this one."
"This is a very drinkable beer. The alcohol is really not noticeable. It was a nice break from the Impy stouts I have lined up. In the past, I have not really cared for portersthere is always some sourness or metallic flavor that I cant get past. This, though, was outstanding and will be a new favorite."
"This is my now go-to porter. Can't go wrong with this one."
"This was my first time trying this on tap and it was incredible."
"Exp 12-26-07, purchased at Merchant's in Dearborn recently. Very dark, black with cherry edges when held in a very bright light. Initial half finger tan head wafted away leaving a ring around the glass and a few errant bubbles. There did not appear to be a lot of carbonation but there was decent lacing. The smell was very chocolately, mocha, toasted almonds, chocolate biscuit. Rich chocolate taste, malt, well balanced bitterness with a lingering, dry, dark chocolate latte finish. Not a hint of astringency. Swirling and even putting the glass down enriched the tan ring around the glass with a fresh supply of bubbles although, again, very little by way of visible carbonation. Overall, a rich taste, full flavours, a full body without being overbearing, very drinkable. This porter certainly lives up to its growing reputation as one of the best, what a treat."
"Was able to try this one on tap last evening while as Slows. It had a nice black color with ruby and brown highlights, a nice sized dark tan head that had nice retention and left a fair amount of lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma was nice, a little bitter probably from heavy roasted malts? While also giving off scents of coffee, chocolate and dark malts. This is a very inviting brew, possibly the nicest aromatic porter I have had. The taste is simply fantastic, nice slight bitterness mixed with flavors that match the nose. The malt flavors here are simply incredible, they flavors that they give off play perfectly together. Slight carbonation also plays nice and the feel is medium. This is probably one of the finest beers I have ever had so incredibly easy drinking, take that with a grain of salt because Porters are my favorite brews. I have been waiting for a long time to give this a try since I have not been able to find it in NY. I was not disappointed to say the least, what a delight. Now how can I get some of these in NY."
"Pours a complete black with nice 1 finger light brown head. Smell is very strong roasted coffee. Taste is phenomenal, roasted coffee with dark chocolate that leaves a great bitter coffee after taste in your mouth as if you just had a handful of chocolate covered coffee beans. Most impressive brew! Mouthfeel is extaordinary, smooth as silk as it warms with great drinkability. FFF Alpha Klaus: step aside Edmund Fitzgerald coming through. An absolute must have."
"Pours almost black,with a thin tan head. Just a bit of retention,and a nice lacing. Aroma was malty,with roasted coffee,and dark chocolate. Body was thiner than I expected,and a bit fizzy. Taste was roasted coffee,chocolate,and a hint of sweet dark fruits. Awsome! Highly recommended."
"I'm just gonna start off by saying that I loved this beer! The appearance was awesome, it basically poured out a black color with an inch or so of light brown head. The smell was solid, some malty scents, maybe almost coffee like. The taste really hit the spot. Nice carmelly/maltly deliciousness. I really liked the mouthfeel; there wasn't a lot of carbonation and I was fine with that. Overall drinkability is huge on this one. The mouthfeel and taste comebined make it a great one that I could really go to town on."
"D: Nicely drinkable."
"A. Very dark, light does not penetrate the middle areas. S. Very nutty, woody smell. T. Taste is nearly perfect, hard to believe but it is. Warm and nutty but true to a porter style, taste is just perfect for this style beer. M. Round and robust, has a great feel. D. Nearly no head at all on pour, drinkability is incredibly smooth, one of the best of breed."
"D: This is an excellent porter, no doubt about it. If you haven't tried it yet, what are you waiting for?"
"Thanks goes to OWSLEY069 for this in a trade"
"A top of the line American Porter. Well crafted and highly drinkable. As far as I'm concerned, the benchmark for quality for the style."
"This is an excellent beer. I haven't drank a lot of porters, so I am definitely not doing it justice in the description. Well deserving of it's ranking, and if you can get it, you should!"
"OK, this is one serious brew. You don't drink this so much as you chew it ha-ha! I had this on draft at the Winking Lizard in downtown Cleveland. It is dark: more black than brown and very cola-like in appearance. It has a wonderful smoky flavor that is intense with chocolate undertones. This actually went very well with the Caribbean jerk chicken wings I ordered. I have had this in a bottle b4 but it is much better on draft. Pick it up if you want a serious beer that will hold up to big meats/spices or the next time you are in ""the mistake on the lake"" for a ballgame."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a smooth roasted malt scent along with a creamy chocolate aroma. The taste is great as well. It has a wonderful roasted malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry with a slight hint of chocolate. It's extremely smooth and easy drinking. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine porter, but I was expecting more. It's a fine session beer and probably in my top five porters of all time."
"Pours an extremely dark brown with a nice two finger light khaki colored head that dies down to a thin layer. Stickiness is crazy good, sticks all over the place. Smell is of dark caramel malts with a fresh french roast coffee odor. Nice nutty smell with a rich dark chocolate malt in the nose as well. Taste is a light coffee like malt with a bit of a milk chocolate flavor to it. Has a bit of a hop bite to it which is balanced out well with the caramel malt flavor. Aftertaste is coffee with a bit of cream and sugar with some smokey woody notes. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a dull carbonation. Haven't had too many porters, but I would have to say this is the best I've had of the style. Only the third I've had from this brewery and I really look forward to more from them."
"Drinkability- This is one of the most complex brews ever from GL and one of my all time fave Porters , You just can not go wrong here folks."
"Nice heavy body, but not too heavy. Just a great all-around porter. I highly recommend this one."
"Drinkability: Nice robust porter, extremely well-balanced and easy-drinking. Nicely complex."
"This porter was overall really good. I think if it had been poured more skillfully, and allowed to warm a few degrees first, that I may bumped up the appearance and smell ratings a tad. I will order this one again when I am bowling, as it is one of the alleys best offerings."
"Overall this is a pretty damn good porter. I'll for sure have this one again."
"Overall: I had heard a lot about this beer so was quick to snatch it up when I saw it. It is quite possibly the best porter I have ever had. It is so big and bold. very stout like, but the creaminess is what makes this one shine. Great Brew!"
"Almost black opaque pour with a huge chocolate milk head that dies kind of quick but laces nice. Smells of ground coffee, sweet malt and a hint of hops. Tasty brew. Delicious roasted coffee, sweet malt, and a bitter finish. Medium in the mouth with nice carbonation. Sessionable indeed."
"*If one gets the chance, GO TO THE BREWERY. Their beer is good in the bottle, but if you get it brewery fresh it will make an atheist believe in God."
"Dark brown color with a good finger and half of tan head that is loose but sticks around. Very nice bitter dark chocolate and coffee with some ripe dark fruits in the nose. Rich, assertive chocolate malt flavor, coffee settles in the background and lasts the duration. Hop fruitiness is complimentary and nearly reaches a citrus level. Dry, chary roasted coffee and bitter cocoa rounds out the pleasant finish. Flavors are consistent from the start. Medium mouthfeel offers a good carbonation that builds some froth. Highly drinkable...these dont last too long in my fridge."
"D: Good on a cold winter evening. Some alcohol, but well masked."
"Pours an opaque brown color with a building tan head that rises and falls faster than a soviet empire. Smell is slightly smokey, with some hops, and cocoa. Taste is a little different than the smell with some dark chocolate flavors and bittering hops. Moutfeel is carbonated and gives a little kick toward the end."
"D - This is an outstanding porter. Great chocolate taste."
"Drinkability: This beer is worth seeking out for porter lovers. I would drink this again if I see it on my travels."
"Overall: I was expecting more from this beer, especially because of all the good beers I've had from Great Lakes over the years, and since this has won numerous medals. I guess there was a reason I've passed this up numerous times in the past....won't be picking this up anytime soon, but it's worth a try if you like the above flavors."
"I'm glad I finally got to try this beer. It really lived up to its reputation."
"D- solid porter ide want to drink over and over"
"Overall- An easy porter to chug. Goes down too easily. 7 or 8 would make for a pleasant evening."
"Bottle. Poured a dark brown color with a medium light-brown head. Strong lacing. Aroma is very coffee-like with hints of roasted malt and chocolate. Mouthfeel is nice. Flavor is heavy in coffee, with a chocolate and malty finish to it. A very nice porter."
"The taste is just as good as the aroma. Coffee seems quite present to me with a nice slightly bitter and dry finish. This would work as an excellent after dinner beer which one can relax with. Easily the best porter I have tried."
"This is a lovely drinking porter that I cannot wait to use in my porter based beef stew this fall. This will be good sleeping weather drinking."
"Poured 12oz bottle to pint glass. Two fingers of tan head rise over a coffee like body. Head leaves nice lace and a halo behind. Smells of coffee and caramel though somehow fairly sweet and unidemensional. Flavor is metallic and sour, finishes with a lingering bitterness that has absolutely no roast character. Lace remains on the glass very nicely as I drain it. Big disappointment as this beer flavor and texture is watery."
"Aroma dominated by up strong up front maltiness. Choclate, toffy, and malt combine to give a very fragerant aroma. The front end comes out in strong fashion; hints of choclate, malt and burnt coffee and java smooth into a nice warm middle and slightly bitter finish. This is a very complex porter; I would like to see more hop bitterness, however. Otherwise, this is a very good porter."
"This is another amazing beer from Great Lakes Brewing Company. I am more and more convinced that this is one of the more consistant brewers out there. I have yet to be dissapointed by any of their products. This is a superb porter."
"D: A good session porter, a bit pricey in this neck of the woods, but a good choice if you are in an area where this stuff is readily available."
"I got this bottle of Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter at Capone's Restaurant out-side of Norristown, Pennsylvania. Big selection of beer to choose from, great for a guy like me still trying to finding his way."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable for a porter, in fact one is hardly enough."
"Pours a dark brown, nearly black color with a solid tan head on top. Looks fantastic. Nose is fairly smooth roasted malt, with some light chocolate and coffee hints. Taste is incredible; coffee, roasted malt, chocolate, some spiciness, light prunes, the list just keeps on going. A really delicious beer. Body is solid and full, with good carbonation. I've had this before and amazingly, I wasn't that impressed. I remember thinking it was pretty bland for such a renowned beer. I now rescind such thoughts, because this one was outstanding. One of the best porters I've ever had, one that I'll have at every opportunity."
"D- Very good dark beer. Could drink several of these over an evening."
"The taste packs some major malted chocolate notes, as well as spice, coffee, and (again) a hint of hoppiness. Nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is a bit overly carbonated for a porter, but the medium body is crisp, surprisingly refreshing, and leaves a decent lingering coffee aftertaste. This tasty Great Lakes brew drinks easily and has complexity to boot, making it not only enjoyable, but pursuable as well. Cheers to the Land of Cleves!"
""
"Dark brown, ruby read pour with a huge frothy light tan head. The smell is rich chocolate with light roast, a tad bit of coffee towards the end. The taste is absoulutely a lot of chocolate but a bit more roast than most porters. Also in the taste is caramel sweetness. The body is farily thin with a definitely watery characteristic, I would prefer it just a touch more full. The flavor stays interesting all the way till the end and doesn't get too monotonous like I would describe the Avery Porter."
"Pours a nice clean black color, nice carbonation, nice small creamy tannish head, nice dose of sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is malty, slightly roasted, a good dose of toffee and caramel. The taste is malty, slightly roasted, a nice hint of vanilla, and lots of toffee/caramel. The finish is slightly dry. Medium body. Very drinkable, a very tasty porter, highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel-wise it is creamy, smooth, and decadent. A real pleasure on the palate. As for drinkabilty; some of my friends and I took a keg of it on spring break this past semester and it is impossible to get sick of. I could eat this stuff on my cereal in the morning. Another example of why I love all things Great Lakes."
"Taste is burned/roasted with coffee and chocolate. The dark malts give a maltbitterness. Also some bitterness of the hops, which are earthy and mild. Great balance! Body is medium. Aftertaste is dry and roasted. Drinkability is high and mouthfeel is smooth."
"Pours a solid black with mahogany hues, a decent half inch head that dissipates quickly, no so much lacing. The aroma is of coffees, cocoas, chocolates, dark malty goodness. The taste is similarly full of malts, dark, chocolates, coffee, some leafy hop and a good dose of bitterness. The mouth is medium full, good carbonation and velvety texture. In all, its a good beer, but can't quite see anything past 'good.'"
"D: Overall a fantastic beer and a great testament to the style. I am in love with what GLBC is brewing. Highly Recommended."
"Overall, a good choice for a relaxing evening. IMHO, it was very diverse and I feel as if it would be enjoyed with food as much as by itself on a crisp autumn eve. Very nice indeed."
"Probably my favorite porter-even though I may be biased based on its brewery location."
"Easy to drink, a very impressive porter that justifies the waiting."
"Eric"
"This is an excellent American-style porter. I really like the hop flavor along with roasted grain tastes. It's quite good."
"This brew is full in body and makes a great brew to sip on a cool Ohio spring or autumn evening."
"Mouthfeel is nice and clings fairly well. This is a very very drinkable beer and an easy beer to make a session out of. I really recommend it."
"One of my favorites, so far."
"This is a great porter. Pours dark brown with very thin tan head. The taste is very chocolate with some coffee flavoring with a refreshing almost minty hop aftertaste. Its very good. This is the most refreshing drinkable porter I've had. I recommend it."
"Wow, what a beer. This porter pours a dark brown with a nice coffee colored head. Good lacing. Smell is roasted coffee and chocolate malts. Taste is more of the same with the coffee dominating, with perhaps a touch of cherry and hops. Very nice. Mouthfeel is full, creamy, and captivating. Porters are not amongst my favorite beers, yet this brew is one the best I've had. Outstanding indeed."
"Poured out a near pitch black color crowned by a thin tan film. The nose was unmistakable roasted coffee which came through in the taste as well. Big roasted coffee flavors, hard to distinguish much else. Mouthfeel was cola like, but also slightly creamy on the finish."
"This one got much better as it warmed. Served with a nice head that subsided but had lots of lace. Very dark almost opaque. Noticeable fruity hop, which is not what I personally like in porters. Nevertheless a great beer. Full rich mouthfeel. A bittersweet finish. But so much going on."
"Starts out smooth and silky going down, and then turns semi-bitter (burnt roasty taste) with a slight sour note at the end. I have no complaints about any of the Great Lakes Brewing Co. beers I have tried thus far."
"Got two bottles of this, one courtesy of jasonm, the other from unclejedi. Thanks again guys!"
"Poured into a pint glass, pours a dark blackish red with a carmel colored head that leaves a fat lace on the glass. Smell is roasted malts with sweet toffee and chocolate. Taste is very amazing, you can taste the malt, barley, chocolate, coffee with a nice bitterness to it this is how I enjoy my porters simply amazing. This is one damn fine porter, one of the better ones around and very enjoyable after a nice dinner."
"Very drinkable and at 5.8% ABV seems to be a nice session beer."
"RERATE: Much more chocolatey than I remember it tasting last night, coffee is only really in the background in the nose, but present on the finish. This is an awesome session beer, but it's definitely a porter-- drink it in the wrong mood and you'll just be craving a Blackout Stout instead."
"Poured a solid borwn in color that did allow some light to seep through. However, the light was very thin and weak. Slight tan head that receded to a thinner film. Nose is malty with some bits of smokey wood rising out of its depths. Flavor is quite nice. Not overly done with the smokiness but just the right amount that it holds up well without wearing out the tastebuds. Little bits of licorice candy as well. Heavy peated malts too. Medium mouthfeel that thickens as it warms. Too bad I only have one bottle of this beer."
"A very nice change up from your AIPAs and APAs. Works well as an after-dinner drink or just lounging around when you only want a couple drinks in a night."
"i go back and forth with the drinkability... i want to rate high but i want to rate lower... it's REALLY easy to drink, but so filling, i couldn't imagine going overboard. sounds like naptime to me. but if you're looking for a great porter with great tastes, look no further."
"overall this is a ery nice brew, prolly one of the better porters ive had i really enjoyed it"
"Great beer from a great brewer. Should be called the great beer brewing company. Pours your standard black with sizeable tan head. Aroma of chocolate, coffee, and nuts...very enticing, and mellowed out quite a bit. Roasty flavor including chocolate and coffee and a hint of raisin. Finishes with a nice bitter coffee flavor. This is one excellent porter."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, sticky, slick, semi-dry in the finish with roasty, cocoa, espresso, and cream running nicely along the tongue."
"Pours a deep, black color with some burgundy evident when holding it to the light. Creamy tan head and very nice sticky lacing. Smell is nice but somewhat subdued, with a nice malt aroma, roasted and chocolate. Deliciously malty, again primarily roasted and chocolate, with a slick, creamy mouthfeel, almost chewy, and an appropriate level of carbonation. I will seek this out again."
"The beer was in a 12oz. brown bottle with a freshness date easily viewable. I then poured the beer into a freshly cleaned 16 oz. American Pint glass from Alcatraz Brewing Company. The appearence in the glass was nice. Very dark brown, almost (merely) black, with a mocha-coffee-like color head that was the size of half my pinky. The head slow goes as one continues to drink. The smell was definitley complex. As this is my first experience reveiwing please take heed. I could definitely smell a sweet aroma as well as a rosted scent. Very complex and inviting. The first taste, a cocoa flavor jumped through immediately followed by a hint of frutiness. A breadth of flavor on the first try. The mouth feel was very filling. The carbonation stayed all the way through and down. Definitely a drinkable beer. I see it as almost like a dessert beer. Respectfully worth having one or two."
"Feels light and smooth. Sourness puckers the mouth a bit but contrasts greatly with the roast."
"Overall, an excellent beer (better on-tap than in bottle)."
"Poured a deep dark brown with a nice reddish ruby tint to it. Nearly opaque but enough light came through to show off the red tones to it. Hige pillow like cream colored head was very slow to recede and when it did left behind a large amount of gooey lace on the glass. The smell was very strong of roasted dark chocolate, which caught me a bit by suprise. As it warmed some more sugary, caramel like tones started to come through. The mouthfeel was a little thin, watery which is my only complaint, I expected a bit more of a robust feel to it. The taste itself was very nice. Suprisingly hoppy on the back and very well balanced with the roasted malts. Main flavors here were more of a roasted coffee and sugar, with a ever so slight hint of chocolate, nothing like the smell which was dominated by it. Overall this was a nice sessionable beer. At 5.8%abv very drinkable and very smooth. I would not turn it down if it were offered, but I still feel there is some room for improvement."
"One of my all-time favorites."
"A great beer... wish I had more!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This is an extremely smooth porter. One of the better American Porters I've tried thus far. I could drink a couple of these in a sitting. Overall, nice offering from Great Lakes. It's not my favorite beer of theirs, but it's probably in the top five."
"A very dark pour with a 2 finger tan head which falls quickly leaving lots of lacing. Smells mostly of roasted malt with some chocolate & coffee. Tastes much like the smell with a little extra lingering coffee. A medium to thick mouthfeel and is very drinkable. I like this porter, it's very good. I'm looking forward to trying it on tap soon."
"As with most all of GLBC's well-balanced intentions - clean, crisp & easy to drink."
"Overall this is a great Porter. I'd definitely buy it and drink it again if I could."
"What a delicious porter! This beer pours a near black, with just a slight hint of ruby red in the corners. Has a nice, creamy head that refuses to go away. Very Guiness like in appearence actually. Smells just like a porter should. Dark roasted malts and chocolate, coffee, and just a bit of smoke. Taste is very warming burnt coffee and chocolate. Very thick and chewy. A wonderful beer to have on a chilly night."
"Yes, sir. This is a fantastic porter. I make sure I never run out of this stuff. Highly recommended."
"This is a very drinkable porter. It is not too bitter or overwhelmingly roasty. Very nice."
"D - Nice porter. I really like the beer. I could have two or three in a sitting."
"EDIT 10-30-07: The head starts out great and still maintains a hearty collar throughout. The smell is fantastic with much more of a chocolate and black malt flavor coming through. I'll leave the taste where it is, though I was REALLY close to bumping it up. My notes above are pretty close to what I'm getting tonight. The mouthfeel still feels a bit thin, but it's really not too bad. All in all, I really suspected I had some bad bottles before, and I think this confirms it. Thankfully I was able to have this on tap and knew not to give up on it. I'll be looking for more."
"This is one of my favorites from Great Lakes selections, possibly one of my all time favorites as well. My mouth begins to water with just the first smell from the bottle. Pours to a creamy full head. Smells great chocolate dominates the overall smell. This beer taste very much like it smells and the strong roasted malt flavor sticks around for a while."
"An extremely well-made beer that is the perfect example of the style."
"D - A superior porter that I could drink daily."
"The taste is very chocolatey and very coffee flavored. Lots of big roasted malt. Hints of licorice towards the end. This has a very big chocalate finish and aftertaste as well. Medium to full mouthfeel, very drinkable and very tasty."
"Leaves the bottle a somewhat translucent brown/black color. Shows some ruby red highlights when held to the light. Pour creates a faily tight, 1/2"" tan head which disappointingly fades quickly to a thin web-like wisp. Pleasant, but quite restrained aromas of bakers chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, dried dark fruit and coffee beans. Found the palate to be leaning toward the thin side; just a tad watery. Flavor shows off a bit more intensity than the aroma did with semi-sweet rich notes of dark chocolate, French roast coffee, roasted malts and burnt caramel candy. Some faint hop flavors sneak in to invoke some slight bitterness to tame the sweetness. Overall a bit tame but very well balanced. For an everyday porter Anchor would still be my call."
"D - Excellent selection - I very much wish that I had another."
"This is a highly drinkable porter, possible my overall favorite. Recommended for anyone not familiar with the style or looking to branch out."
"This is an almost perfect porter, my only complaint would be the exteme smoothness makes one forget that this is supposed to be a hardy beer. I'll try it at room temperature next time to see if the flavor is a little more pronounced. Overall my choice right after Bells and Anchor Steam for a porter."
"This beer is a good example of the style, though not too exciting."
"One of three porters that qualify for the mark of perfection (Bells and Mill St. = other two). Since Bell's has been pushed out of my grasp by the stubborn beer barons of Illinois, this has become my ""Official Beer of Winter 2007"". Besides Pere Ubu, Cleveland's only contribution to American culture."
"This beer pours black with many hints of amber. There is an ample off white head that holds for a while and laces but dissipates down to a thin film by halfway down the glass. The smell has a strong roasted character with some sweetness. The taste is nice starting out with that roasted characteristic and then finishing with sweet chocolate notes. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly less than would be desired but not bad at all. The carbonation is smooth. Overall, a good porter. Certainly enjoyable."
"Overall, a tasty, solid example of the style, and something I'll keep buying. It's not fantastic, but is a solid fridge beer for chilly nights."
"This is the best porter. This is one of the first micro's I ever drank, and it made me think that porter was my style of choice. I was wrong, for the next few years I tried as many other porters as possible and no other beer came close to Edmund Fitzgerald. A delicious roasted chocolate and coffee taste with all the flavors in perfect balance. If you ever visit GLBC in Cleveland there always seems to be atleast one person in there that has driven hundreds of miles just to enjoy this porter."
"The beer pours black with mahogany highlights with a tan 1/2 finger of head. The foam leaves behind a godd lace on the glass. The aroma is very fruity, ripe fruit, and chocolate. The flavor is chocolate and coffee. There's a good sparkleing of carbonation on the tongue and the mouthfeel isn't too heavy. I like this better than any other porter I've had."
"cheers!"
"Creamy mouthfeel but just a hair too thin for perfection. Still, this is easily my favorite year-round American porter I've had to this point. Love it."
"The Edmund fitzgerald porter, is so smooth and flavorful. a very beautiful color and the head has a cream color to it. the beer has a hint of chocolate, especially dark chocolate but it is not over powering. i would defiinetly recommend this beer"
"D: The low abv and range of flavors going on here make the drinkability good. I'd say this is good for sessioning."
"D: A nice porter that is sure to be a favorite. Very easy to drink, yet fairly complex. Get some!"
"quite possibly the best out of about 300 beers (note:later edit)that I've tried. An all-planet selection first teamer - best porter. And GLBC possibly boasts best american brewed German lager(dort), and best american octoberfest and vienna(elliot ness/my#1). at least for what I've tried. Top-Notch brewery, top-notch beer. THis porter is the standard."
"D- It is very nice just think the coffee in the aftertaste is a bit to strong in coffee for me. Other than that it is a really nice porter."
"This beer is great - better than the Blackout Stout. Appearance is dark with very abundant tan head (over-ran the rim of the glass). Aroma is very rich coffee. Taste is more coffee along with a burned malt taste which is truly excelllent. Mouthfeel is full, with flavors lingering mid-point on the tongue. This beer is highly drinkable and very good all-the-way-around."
"A superior porter..."
"Mouthfeel was a good combination of smoothness and zestiness. Medium/thin bodied. I will find this one again."
"A friend of a friend brought this wonder of a porter back from Ohio for me. Oh, how I wish it were available in this area. A must-try."
"D: I am lucky to have this beer in my refridgerator at all times! This is consistantly ""Spot On"" for the style. This beer isn't over the top and is what a traditional porter should be. Highly drinkable and almost addicting! Eddy Fitz is one of those rare brews that you can savor while drinking as a session beer!"
"This is an astounding Porter. Very complex with can unexpected locorice flavor and a very thick body. If you like dark beers you must try this."
"Very nice roasty porter from Great Lakes. Pours very dark, almost black, but with dark orange highlights. Almost no head retention and spotty lacing, but nice head to begin with. Smells like roasted grain for the most part, but their is a nice complex winey smell on the finish. Taste starts immediately with roasted grain and then becomes more creamy with some plum pudding flavors. Very dry as a porter should be, slightly winey finish, delicious. The mouthfeel is smooth and has a little creaminess to it, but is just a tad lighter than I'd like. Very dry, a quite carbonated. Quite drinkable- nice flavor, smooth, and balanced creaminess."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: I honestly drank 3/4 of this while writing the review before realizing how much I have drank. It goes down very smooth and makes me want to have quite a few though it is a filling beer."
"this is an excellent beer that very much blurs the line between porter and stout. highly recommended, and a fridge staple."
"D: As excellent as its reputation, a highly drinkable and savory porter. Nice balance with bold, likable flavors. I would love to have this often and strongly recommend it to others."
"Oh yes. I'll have another, please..."
"Overall an exceptional brew!"
"Need to have this one with friends to see if I may be missing some of the nuances. Could probably rate higher."
"A beautiful dark brown, almost black, body with great dark tan/medium brown head. A decent head dissipated till a fat ring remained around the edges of the glass, this ring left some light lacing in clingy patches down the sides. The aroma was sweet roasted malt with chocolate covered cherries. The taste was similar to regular Edmund Fitzgerald, but with a more pronounced chocolate flavor that intertwines with cherries followed by a slight tartness from the cranberries. There are many different flavors going on this glass, but the overall experience isn't lost on just one pronounced flavor. All the flavors blend together well. Smooth medium bodied mouthfeel and good drinkability due to the fact that the cherry and cranberry flavors are nice and subtle."
"The pour is a a dark almost black ruby red with a noble tan head. Aroma is very elegant with roasted malts and chocolate. Flavors are VERY well balanced with deep malt presence with a nice bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth leaving it very drinkable. Overall, this brew is an excellent porter specimen. I look forward to trying more brews from Great Lakes Brewing."
"GLBC's website lists 12 medals won by this beer. It deserves every one."
"Bottom line: A damn fine porter."
"This beer is amazing... i went to a brew fest at Penn State University and tried it for the first time. I went back to their stand 4 times to get more. Absolutely my favorite porter ever. EVER. Only problem is, the only place they distribute in PA is in Pittsburgh... a long trip for philadelphians like myself. But anyway, about the beer, excellent coffee and chocolate flavors... not a thick porter, it kinda had a light mouthfeel. Just like one of the other reviewers wrote, i could drink this beer everyday."
"A solid porter. Another great bear from GLBC. If you like porter I wouldn't pass this up."
"I could drink this beer every day. Perfect session beer, under 6%. Full of flavor. What else do you want?"
"I have to admit, this brew is one of the better porters out there (but I'm sure someone will chastize me for saying that!)"
"The drinkability is not beat, This is truly a best of class brew.Prosit und Zum Wohl, Many thanks to McAllister for the oppertunity to try this great brew. MK"
"The mouth is full and complex, moving from a light, creamy wave capped by sweetness, to a bittersweet, semi-dry coffee/chocolate finish. It's an extremely well-rouned and drinkable stout, yet still offers pleny of flavor. One of the best American Porters in the land in my opinion."
"Overall, kind of an average porter, with an interesting complexity and boldness, but does little to please the palate. Nicely light bodied as well, so I could drink in the summer too."
"Overall a superior porter. Extremely drinkable and sessionable. Perhaps the best porter available."
"Ruby-hued, shipwreck dark brown body with a thick, tall, dense, cocoa brown head. Beautiful. Dark chocolate and cocoa dusted over molasses, dough, and spicy hops. Bursting with sweet and roasted malt right out of the box. Toasted, roasted edge up front gives way to slightly sweet and chocolatey malts. Roasted coffee and hop bitterness are there the whole time and really come through in a slightly warming finish. Very good. Medium bodied with a smooth, bottle-conditioned feel. Excellent."
"Pours a nice dark color with a thick head. The sweetness is not to overpowering and is very welcomed. Overall and enjoyable porter, but personally I have a problem drinking more than 1 of these in a given night."
"Drinkability: I'm not a porter man but I found this to be drinkable. If you love porters you will probably enjoy this beer."
"Drinkability: Great complexity to this porter"
"This is one of the first actual beers I've had. The appearance to me was good. From what I've read it looked like a Porter ""should"". Smell was aromatic and better than a typical mass brew that I am used to. Taste was excellent. It took a minute in my mouth to register what flavors were there. It had a coffee, chocolate hint. Mouthfeel was pretty decent, mild bodied. Drinkability is definately there. Not to heavy on the stomach. My overall stance on this beer is that it is definately my favorite for now."
"D: Tasty, very easy to drink, only slightly filling, excellent representation of style and an all-round excellent beer."
"The Taste is true porter... creamy and just the right amount of hoppiness. A chocolate finish with just the right amount of sweetness finishes it off well. The taste hangs with you for quite a while making this beer a hard one to forget!"
"Bottle. Pours dark with just a hint of red. Tan foam which disipates quickly. Taste of burnt coffee and malt followed by a chocolate linger. Great feel and flavor from start to end. Easily drinkable. I have to remind myself to slow down and enjoy. Opps, too late now. It's gone."
"This beer poured black as could be with an airy head that disappeared as fast as I could pour and left no lace. The smell is smoky and with an almost sour quality. The beer tastes chocolate and smoky with hints of roasted coffee. The taste dissipates fast with little after taste. The beer is creamy and smooth and finishes clean. I was not really impressed with this beer. It is a little weak in flavor and a little on the flat side but it also has some nice qualities. I would defiantly give this beer another try if I run across it again."
"Pours with a thick light tan head ,a very deep ruby red hue,can barley see light through it. Smells nutty,roasty,chocality,slightly burnt,very complex aroma.Tastes sweet,nutty,like black coffee,with a burnt aftertaste.A nice rich mouthfeel,a fruity taste followed by a burnt aftertaste,a clean,dry finish.A very good porter,well balanced, and very enjoyable."
"By far the best porter I've had to date, and one that lives up to all the hype... My first perfect score."
"Drinkability: This is a beer I could drink all day. It takes a while to drink it because I don't need to take large sips in order to get its complexity; the complexity is just there so less is required to drink."
"D-Fairly drinkable, with a nice balance between the many flavors. Each bottle reveals a different characteristic, making it interesting."
"Drinkability is probably the best of any porter I've tried. Typically this is not one of my choice styles but I would love to have Edmund Fitzgerald constantly in my refrigerator."
"A very drinkable sessionalbe porter. I liked it the first time a tried it and i like even more today."
"I like this beer and will drink all 6 out of the pack today."
"I have had this beer numerous times over the past 15 years or so. However, I have never really gotten to sit down with a pint and think about it till now. I am always at my sisters in Cleveland or somewhere and its just ""around"" for drinking. Nice appearance-chocolatey brown with a very thin tan head. Low aroma-roasted/cocoa like with a mild, sort of caramel trace. Good roasted flavor-has a slight, pleasant burnt tinge to it. Very nice indeed. Bit thin for me in the body. Very, very drinkable porter. Its nice to sit back and savor a beer that isnt ""big"" or ""double"" for a change."
" It's a rich mahogany in color with very substantial creamy head. Rich rroasted malt aroma with notes of espresso. Full bodied with moderate carbonation it feels very smooth. the best part is the taste This is a rich malty concoction with a perfectly balanced undertone of bitterness that lingers and precludes any cloying aftertaste. You can't go wrong with this brew and it is priced better than many many inferior brands."
"D: I love this, and am gonna have to have my relatives send me some more. A truely amazing porter. If I had this readily available near me I would buy it all the time."
"Pours a deep dark brown with ruby red highlights, topped by a two-inch, creamy tan head that takes its time retreating to about the half-inch level, leaving some creamy, sticky lacing along the way. Aroma of rich roasted malt, with notes of mocha, dark fruit, and dark chocolate. Palate is up front with toasty, roasty malt, with a bit of coffee, plum, and bittersweet chocolate. The creamy body is almost perfect - not unlike that of malted milk (although, 2% malted milk). A delight to drink, this went beautifully with a slice of chocolte beet cake. Wish I could have brought more than one bottle back from my trip to the Midwest."
"Not heavy or big on alcohol but right up there with the best American porters I've ever had."
"Taste - wow...Quite possibly the finest porter I've tried on this side of the pond. I whish they had Massachusetts distribution."
"I've been looking forward to trying this for a while, but I it seems a little over-rated. My first bottle was merely average, but I have had a couple more that were a little better... adjusted scoring as necessary."
"I tried this beer at a Brew Expo...it was much better there...I think it was from a keg. I tasted a bit of vanilla at the expo and it was lacking here. Word to the wise: definitely let this brew warm-up. It rapidly changes character with a little warmth (true of lots of beers I reckon). Though I was slightly disappointed, this is one good brew."
"Drinkability: This is a great porter. If this is what it tastes four months past the recommended drink by date, I can't wait to pick up some more."
"Overall: Hands down the best porter I have ever encountered. The flavors are all in perfect harmony, and it is dangerously sessionable. If you can find a tastier porter, please tell me what it is and where to get it immediately."
"Poured to a dark, opaque brown with thick tan head and great lacing. malty aroma of nuts, chocolate and toffee. The taste was more of the chocolate and toffee. Body was a tad on the thin side, but finish very smooth. Although I had this on a warm summers eve, it was a most enjoyable beer."
"Very drinkable and comforting."
"God bless Great Lakes for this beer."
"Many thanks to justcas and July Secret Santa BIF 2006...My tastebuds are bowing in your honor."
"Full bodied and dry, all it all it was very tasty and Im looking forward to the rest of the six pack and many more down the road."
"I was looking forward to trying this beer and it was worth the wait. It poured a very deep brown and had a tan head. The smell is roasted grain. The taste is borderline stout. This is a hard hitting porter. Oatmeal flavors are present. This is a smooth beer . A nice roasted aftertaste. The drinkability is high. I just wish this beer was available in NC. This is a damn fine beer."
"Poured very dark brown, almost black with a tan head that receded to a ring around the glass. Rich smell of cherries, cocoa, some espresso notes, molasses, and currants. Amazing smell, especially for a regular porter. Roast coffee upfront, before leading into cocoa and some hoppiness, then some of the dark fruit comes through before a dry coffee finish. Medium carbonation and light to medium bodied, pretty slick and oily on the tongue. Really a joy to drink, I wish this was easier to get here in Iowa."
"Drinkability: A solid porter, that remains sessionable despite a nice depth of flavor. Not terribly complex, but graceful in its simplicity."
"Drinkability is good, but it's hindered for me by the dry and roasty barley at the end."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle, this Porter has a dark and rich color, more along the lines of high potency cocoa, then say coffee. The beer gives a foamy tan head, that is not too thick. The Edmund Fitzgerald has a very mild odor, but what it lacks to the nose, it makes up for in the mouth. It has a very smooth drinkability, that fills the mouth with bitter coffee tastes and complimentary tones of sweet chocolate. This porter goes down smooth, and is a great member of the Great Lakes family."
"drinkability: rather high"
"Pours a dark black with a red tint when held up to a lamp, and a light tan head. Smells burnt with some smoky tones and chocolate and coffee hints. Other sweet notes come through. The taste is powered by a smoky feel and plenty of sweet notes for some balance. It has a bitter beginning with a long smoky aftertaste. Good mouthfeel, the heavy smoke flavor doesn't mask the other tones that fill this beer. This is a great beer, my favorite from great lakes. Enjoy!"
"D: Drinkability is quite high on this offering from Great lakes. Very tasty porter--one of the better, more smooth ones I've had."
"Bottle courtesy of Sammy: Poured a deep black color porter with a medium off-white foamy head with minimal retention. Aroma of light coffee and roasted malt is less dominating then expected. Taste is also dominated by light coffee with some medium bitterness form the roasted malt. Body is about average with some creamy aspect. Not sure why this is rate so high, I can think of quite a few porter that are at least equal or better then this."
"D - Outstanding drinkability!! I wish I had the opportunity to hammer this in large quantities!! Thank you mlh1227!!!!"
"This was the first beer I've tried from Great Lakes. Very good example of the style."
"D: Not as complex as I had hoped. For the reviews, I expected more. Much better porters out there IMO."
"Nice porter from Ohio, completely recommended."
"I will definetly try a fresh bottle to find the original tastes...these tastes seemed a little off."
"Served in a pint glass, the porter pours dark brown with some tinges of red depending on how I hold the beer up to the light. There's an inch carbonated tan head that lingers on the glass for a long time. There's also a nice layer of lace that remains on the glass while drinking it. The aroma is mostly chocolatey, with some roasted malt and hops in there too. It tastes like semi-sweet chocolate, coffee, and hops. It has a nice bitter aftertaste too. It has a good medium mouthfeel to it, with just the right amount of carbonation. It finishes great, and it's very easy to drink. It has just the right amount of bitterness and sweetness to it, it's one of the best beers I've had. I'd recommend this to anyone to drink, it's another excellent beer by Great Lakes."
"D: Very drinkable. One of the best of the style. Overall a very good porter. Nice balanced flavors, excellent consistency."
"Pours a nice mahogany color with a tan head. Quite nice looking, really. I didn't pick up much from the smell (maybe my nose wasn't working) but there was the predictable dark roasted aroma that comes with a porter. Nothing significant there. The taste, however, was yummy. Some nutty notes along with the roasted malty flavor, and a bitter finish. Overall, a tasty brew that I've enjoyed more than once before. The mouthfeel was fine, and this is an easily drinkable porter."
"Feel is just medium bodied with a clean finish which adds to the drinkability. There is a softness to the feel that is stunning. Velvet."
"Well done, a must try...best porter I have had, period..."
"Near pitch black body. Roasty and chocolate aroma with big chocolate flavor. Very smooth and almost a little chewy. A bit thick for me to want to drink a few more. A great porter, although overrated IMO. Ranks right up there with my other favorites, Anchor Porter and Middles Ages Duke of Winship."
"Black in color with a half inch beige head. Smells of hops, malt and oatmeal. Rich and creamy in taste with an oats and grains finish. Aslo hops in the aftertaste. Good lacing on the glass. A great beer. I fear that I am being conservative with the rating, because, as I have had many more since first trying the beer, and also had thge opportunity to visit the brewery and been hooked ever since."
"Very fine example of an American Porter, the only letdown was the smell, and even that wasn't too bad."
"A near perfect porter."
"This tastes so fanastic I can't believe that it's only 5.8% ABV! What a great session porter."
"The more beers I drink from Great Lakes, the more I'm impressed with them. Quality brewery."
"I cannot figure out what Great Lakes puts in the water, but no matter what I've had previous to drinking this, I always want to go back to them. They never go overboard and everything is overly drinkable, including this one. Dark rich pour, with a decent head and some lacing. Some chocolate, not overbearing, almost milky. Few hops at the end, quaffable as hell. Feels awesome on the palate and the best news, WE up here can get this for $6.99 a sixer in the grocery stores!!"
"Still the beer was drinkable and a good American Porter. I like Great Lakes a good deal, and this was a good beer keep in mind. I still feel it could have been better."
"coffee flavors. smooth chocolate. the hops fit in quite seamlessly. it's not a complex brew, but the balance and dexterity is nice"
"Simply excellence !!"
"Damn, did I mention this is good? ..certainly one of the best porters I've had to date. I wish all breweries made an attempt at brewing porters & stouts this great..it seems like too many settle for ""alright"" and end up with a watery, forgettable brew. This one, however, is exceptional. A must try."
"Drinkability: A fine crafted porter, this is a beer Ohio can be proud of, balanced, with all the attributes a great porter should. Thanks to tyrawlings for the beer!"
"Overall: An excellent interpretation of the style. Smooth flavors that are done well and not overdone. Everything about this brew is exceptional, and the same can be said of this brewery."
"Pours black with thick and creamy tan head. Mostly diminishing, but it leaves some noce lacing. The aroma is coffee, chocolate and caramel. The flavor starts rich and roasted - chocolate and caramel, and it ends with some piney bitterness. Medium body, mouthfeel is light."
"Body seems thin, carbonation not as impressive as it looks.But overall a well crafted porter. I could drink a few of these."
"This outstanding porter pours a dark brownish/black, yet remains fairly clear. The head is small and creamy and dissipates quickly. The smell has a dark and full-bodied aroma of chocolate malt. The taste is similar with a bold taste and a creamy roasted aftertaste. The hop bitterness is medium and isn't too overpowering. This beer has a very well balanced taste and was quite enjoyable. The mouthfeel was medium/thick with medium/low carbonation. In summary, this was an excellent and hearty beer that is very drinkable and has taken it's place as one of my favorite dark beers."
"An easily drinkable smooth porter that everyone seems to recommend including me. Delicious."
"Nice user friendly porter here at a low alcohol level too. Flawless porter that is very coffee like. It is good but not my favorite beer style. An excellent example of the style."
"I'm not sure why it's taken me so long to write a review for Edmund Fitzgerald - probably because I don't have a hard time remembering how good it is."
"Very dark brown in colour with red highlights. Medium carbonation. Strong aromas of dark chocolate, cold dark roast coffee, and the slightest suggestion of earthy hops at the tail end. More chocolate and dark roast coffee in the mouth, with additional flavors of dried fruit, brown sugar, and a touch of lactic sourness. Good body and a lasting finish. Complex, but perhaps a little muddled at the end. Still a very good porter."
"My favorite GL brew to date..."
"Color is nearly black but you can see all the way through if held up to a light. The head is a modest one-half inch that fades pretty quickly but leaves a nice ring. Wonderfully strong aroma, robust toasted coffee with chocolate notes, very inviting. The flavor is also quite intense but does not match the sweetness from the aroma. Strong roasted coffee domintates, and the flavor doesn't change much from start to finish. Very dry, slightly bitter overall. The mouthfeel is semi-thick, has a nice smoothness, and is quite sharp on the carbonation for a porter. Drinkablity is superb on this one, it's not alcoholic, and there are no-off flavors, i just wish the taste had the same cascade of flavors as the aroma did...."
"overall a fantastic porter. the few times i've had an ""ed fitz"" it's always fantastic, and i always look forward to the next."
"Black with tan head. Just what you would expect in a porter. Sheets of lacing are left behind after each sip. Smell starts to let you know that this isn't the typical porter though. It would be easier to list what I don't smell in this beer. It has that typical smoked smell but i also note cherries, coffee, chocolate and sweetness. Taste lives up to the anticipation from the smell. I really pick up the chocolate notes in the taste. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. This is the most drinkable porter that I've had in a long time. I wish I had more than the one lonely one left in the cellar."
"1//2 gallon growler filled at Pizza Plant Walker Center in Williamsville. Deep dark transparent blood red, crowning thick onion-skin froth. Roasted coffee and burnt sugar aromas, with a pale scent of dates. Perfect baker's chocolate and roasted espresso flavors wash over the palate at first with earthy, bitter hops clipping through the middle. Mild citrusy hops show at the finish and a lovely dark-roasted coffee taste lingers afterwards. Smooth mouthfeel; moderate carbonation and medium body. Utterly drinkable; my growler will be empty in no time. Outstanding porter."
"PS. I had Great Divide St. Bridget porter the other day. It's just one notch below this one."
"a fine beer... easily sessionable."
"A deep dark brown color, with a beige colored head forms and laces very nicely. Chocolate and roasted malt comes through, a wonderful aroma. The taste is incredible, the chocolate and coffee flavors make you savor every drop of this beer. The mouthfeel has some lite carbonation and is slightly watery, but it is still very creamy and very smooth going down. This is a very drinkable that has incredible taste. It is nice to see a non-imperial dark stand on its own."
"Strong malty aroma with a touch of mocha. Deep black with a thin bubbly head. Sweet and approachable flavor palate, but I hate to say it I am not as impressed as I thought Id be. There is a wateryness to the flavor in the finish that is impossible not to notice. A very decent porter, but I think it is highly overrated. Just doesnt have enough ass to it. Needs a lot more roastiness and less chocolate creaminess."
"Pleasantly, this porter isn't too roasted. In the stout to porter scale of roastiness, I like my porters to be further away from stoats. Hopiness is not overdone but complements the overall taste well."
"D - A very drinkable beer, and a very buyable beer. Good with food or good alone. I think it would even make a good session beer."
"Medium body fits the flavors perfectly. A nice, sessionable porter."
"Pours a dark red/brown, red edges, medium tan head forms, laces nicely with good retention. Smell is nice and roasty, coffee/chocolate, some cherries, some more bittersweet chocolate, as a porter should smell. Taste is super chocolate roast, with some coffee, vanilla, and bitter chocolate in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Fucking fantastic porter, would drink anytime and anywhere. Thanks DrJay!"
"Poured a dark ruby/brown color with less than a inch head of almost tan colored foam. It did dissipate fast, but it did leave some rigns around the mug though. When I first popped the cap, a nice aroma of hops came gushing out. When I poured it, the hops still remained, but in the background of dark roasted malt and coffee beans. I noticed in the front of the pack where those coffee beans and roasted malt flavors and then those bitter hops came out at the end. Not too bitter though. Bascially it tasted like smelled, but better. Gets better when it starts to warm up. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy and those bitter hops don't seem to want to go just yet. An excellent porter that is brewed only 30 mins from here, talk about drinking local. This is a beer that Porter lovers would enjoy over and over again. I wish I hadn't kept putting off trying this beer for so long. Good work Great Lakes!!"
"Pours a deep brown, nearly opaque with a tiny bit of dark amber around the edges, with a light tan head. Smells is mainly dark caramel with a bit of hops, but could be stronger. Nice complex flavor, with roasted and chocolate-ish malts, a nice profile of slightly herbal and bitter hops, and a long aftertaste of burnt caramel flavors and some nutty/earthy tones. Mouthfeel is very well balanced, perhaps even slighly thin for the style and ever so slighly astringent. Hearty, but refreshing. Overall, a quality brew."
"D- This beer not only has good complexity in the malt bill but the flavors are so crisp and clean. They also flow from one great flavor to the next from start to finish."
"Dark in color - black to go with a brown complexion. Has a small amount of head, but stays for a while with the body. Can taste a bit of chocolate and espresso to the flavor. One of the better porters I have had in a while. Will finish the 4 pack and get some more this weekend. Enjoy!"
"beer is very enjoyable and drinkable year round."
"Overall: Definitely worth all the hype it gets. For me, it's not as incredible as Alpha Klaus, but at a fraction of the price it's nearly as good."
"Taste; really nice roasted coffee flavor to start with, followed by some chocolate malts that is balanced with just enough hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice smooth carbonation. I was sure this wouldn't live up to the hype, but this is definitely one of the best American Porters I've ever had."
"The body is nice and robust, and not too dry. A gentle carbonation sooths the tongue. Has a nice earthy finish. This is THE perfect session beer for a ""dark beer"" drinker."
"This is a well crafted porter. Nothing flashy here but very solid. Very smooth and easy to drink."
"Drinkability is excellent on this, a very solid porter."
"Drinkability- A perfect session beer. I use this beer to educate my friends into quality beer. I've had stouts that beg to compare to this porter. Simply the best."
"Well-balanced and complex in both the flavor and aroma departments. A solid porter."
"Drinkability- Was not as impressed as I thought I would be, but still a decent porter for sure."
"I really enjoy the mouthfeel of this brew as well. It is full bodied, and has a good amount of carbonation as well, there could be a little less in my opinion, but it is not overcarbonated. I would definitely buy this brew again. It is well worth the money and is quite easy to drink."
"Damn what a fine brew. This beer will probably ruin any other Porter that I try from now on. It will be on my grocery list every week for a very long time."
"Notes: Another fine beer from the GLBC.One of the better porters out there."
"A good porter. Mouthfeel is nicely full but not sticky. Amazingly drinkable and at 5.8% ABV you can easily have a few."
"A medium+ body and lighter effervescence. This is a great beer. Get some and enjoy it. I wouldn't even share this it is so good."
"A friend of mine gave me the rest of his six pack. He drank one and said it was nasty. I generally like porters and stouts so I grabbed it from him. Plus, it was free and I rarely turn down free beer. Pours black with nice head that recedes only a little. Smells sweet and has a nice aroma of chocolate and roasted malts. Mouthfeel is smooth and lightly carbonated. Has a pleasant hoppy aftertaste. I really enjoyed this porter, the malts and hops are perfectly balanced. My friend made a mistake giving this up. I'll be enjoying every last drop of the five beers I have."
"I think Great Lakes Porter is the best Porter you can get in the midwest, maybe even in the US. Excellent balance between hops and malt. Sweet, carmel, chocolate flavors. Not too harsh astringet or ""burnt"". Smooth, creamy rounded mouth feel. Just enough hops to complement the malt and not compete with and /or overwhelm like many others. Squeeky clean. Gotta have it!"
"Another very good beer from the folks at Great Lakes."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: A great full bodied porter. I have yet to experience a bad beer from Great Lakes."
"As for taste, in one word... indescribable, but i'll do my best. It is rich and roasted with hints of coffee, nuts, and chocolate. Mouthfeel is light considering it's bold taste. This goes down smooth, and leaves the drinker longing for another sip. I recommend this to anyone who loves a rich American porter, this is truly one of the best."
"It definitly is a full-bodied beer, but I wouldn't call it heavy. It has a nice mouthfeel, and is very drinkable as well. My glass was gone before I knew it, and what I wouldnt give to have more of these sitting in my fridge."
"(Let's be honest, if I don't drink it tonight, I'm going to drink it tomorrow and go buy more.)"
"This was a great Porter. Of course I like the style so that doesn't hurt and the White Sox were racking up double digits on about 17 TVs around me and that too might have artificially heightened the experience of this Porter. But it had a nice head that lingered and laced, an aroma that set-up the chocolate, coffee and toffee malt flavor. It went down fast and then I moved on to another Great Lakes product; the Elliot Ness, in keeping with the Chicago theme."
"another winner from Great Lakes."
"Deep coffee color and thick khaki head. Absolutely delicious. Charred coffee, rich mocha, chocolate, and caramelized sugars make up the aromas and taste. Texture is chewy and rich. The hops add the necessary bitterness to balance the malty sweetness. Finish is dry and leaves you thirsty for more. Uber drinkable."
"As one would expect from a porter, E.F. pours a dark-brown, almost black color, with a slight tannish head. It is very dense and opaque looking. Smells of roasted malt and chocolate. Toffee and nut are also present. Not terribly strong on the nose though. Very full flavor. Malt is strong on the tongue. Chocolate and a slight hop presence are also there. Very bold and sweet. In the mouth it is full, sweet and pleasant. There is a bit of post-swallow bitterness. Holds well. Although I am not a huge porter fan, this beer impresses. Nice full and sweet flavor that remains pleasant in the throat. One or two are enough for me. Porter drinkers will probably love this one."
"Drinkability: I personally don't find many porters to be session beers... but this one is"
"Dark brown in color with a fluffy tan colored head. The head draped casually on the side of the glass as I drink. This beer poured, and looks closer to a cask beer than any other Ive seen. The nose has espresso and milk chocolate notes. The flavor has the espresso and chocolate along with more roast malt overtones. There is a lot of alcohol heat on the finish. The mouth feel is very full and rich. The drinakbility is only medium due to the heat."
"Drinkability -- This is a porter to savor. It's excellent after dinner. I could easily drink a few of these in one sitting. I think I'm going to try to have this one on hand at all times."
"Pours black with a very thin tan head. Smell is very nice- chocolate and berries. Taste has a lot of roasted malt with bittersweet chocolate, espresso, and berry flavors. Some tastey hops kick in for the finish. This is a very good beer. Mouthfeel is full and this is very drinkable. A wonderful porter."
"This one turns out being super-easy to drink. Tasty and fun! I recommend to ANYONE!"
"...of course that's what is expected from a Porter that meet all of the criteria for the style. But does meeting the style mean that a perfect 5 is deserved? No. The beer needs that 'something extra' that it lacks; making it a very, very good beer. But, not a great."
"Hands down best porter i've had to date...which isn't exactly saying a whole lot, but nonetheless it's damn good."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable considering the strong taste and weight of the brew. I could go through several of these in a sitting."
"This brewery makes so many fine beers and their porter is also worthy of recognition. The beer has a deep brown body, with ample thickness and a clump of dark tan head. The smell immediately lends itself notes of molasses and cocoa powder, mixed with some assertive hop bitterness. Flavorwise, the astringency of the roasted malt is balanced by a sweet toffee flavor and the beer stays firmly within the porter style, although it has whispers of Baltic porter strength and substance. The hops are outstanding and give it just enough life to keep it irresistibly drinkable. Reminds me of Storm King, with a little more finesse and a little more class. Even better as it warms to room temp. A great sipper."
"A great example of the porter style of beer. Keep up the great work Great Lake Brewing!!!"
"Pretty drinkable, not as heavy as I expected, went great with my steak!"
"I was not going to rate this beer because I'm not fond of the taste of porters or stouts so it would not be fair to rate those style beers. After drinking this beer and liking it which that in its self tells you just how good this beer is. This beer after every swollow left me wanting more. Good mouthfeel and drinkablity outstanding. I wish I could put my finger on the reason this porter did something for me whereas other porters did not."
"side note. great brewing company motto, ""beer first, earth a very close second"""
"Can't wait to have another. Actually, I did have another on reserve but used it to marinade my pork chops for the grill. Excellent... just with I had a third."
"I knew this one was a winner from the minute it poured out of the bottle. A wonderful black color with a milk-chocolate head that seems to last forever. The aroma smells strongly of roasted barley, but some other sweet malt notes sneak through as well. The flavor backs-up the strong roasted smell with an immediate assault on your tongue. At the same instant, tons of coffee and caramel flavors arrive. However, the roasted malt is the dominant factor by far. The mouthfeel is outstanding. Substantial, but not quite so thick as to confuse it with a stout. Overall, I'd say it is perfect for the style. This is a very drinkable beer, but only for those who are fans of the roasted malts. Otherwise, it will likely be over-powering."
"This is one of the best out there. Black with fringes of ruby. Smells of coffee, burnt caramel. Tastes divine. Bitter, strong malt clobbering you up front with subtle sweetness backing it all up. Mouthfeel is amazing, almost like it was nitro-poured out of a bottle. Foams up if you swish it around. I could drink this all day."
"Pours black, dark mahogany highlights. Tan, three finger head retains well and will leave patchy lace. Roasted chocolate malt, caramel, and american hop aromas. Light carbonation and medium body give it an ultra-smooth mouthfeel. Burnt chocolate sweetness and black patent burnt flavor, followed by coffee, and a dry hop leaf aftertaste that leaves the finish residual sweet yet perfectly balanced."
"Great Lakes could not brew a bad beer if they tried. This is a true beer drinkers beer. Be forewarned if you aren't a fan of strong beers though, this one will kick you in the pants if you aren't prepared for it. The taste is at the same time both smooth and full, with a strong aftertaste of hoppy goodness. It's a beer that begs to be savored at the same time as it begs to be emptied so you can order up another. Deep and dark in color, with a decent frothy head, other porters aspire to be so good."
"Pours an opaque black color with a large tan head. Big coffee aroma with subtle chocloate tones The taste is huge with coffee and chocolate everywhere. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a great beer. Too bad it is not available in my area."
"OVERALL COMMENTS: Another outstanding brew from Great Lakes  its everything you ever wanted in a porter and less (mouthfeel!)."
"Alternately dry and sweet maltiness up front. Morphs into strong roasted coffee bean flavors. This is like porter's greatest hits. Smoky, sweet, creamy and bitter. Coffee and chocolate and damn smooth. It has it all. Really like this creamy mouthfeel. Easy drinker and this one was well worth my trip to Cleveland all by itself."
"Typical porter appearance, black and lightly carbonated, but that's the only way in which the Fitz can be described as less than exceptional. Easily the best scent, managing to smell like actual coffee, not burnt coffee. Taste is the same, coffeeish but in a sweet way as well as bitter, very smooth, nice finish. It has the second-highest ABV of the six, but you'd never know. One of the very best beers of any kind, and easily champion of the porter-off."
"It pours a nice dark dark brown with a head that resembles a thick and creamy root beer and not the normal dark ale heads. Aromas of nutty chocolate, and an ever so slight charcoal smoke. So slight I had a hard time finding it, but it's there. The flavor comes with malt, chocoalte, bbq grill and corn flakes. I know I know, ""CORN FLAKES?!"" So help me god they were there. The mouth feel was very pleasant, light and smooth very enjoyable."
"Poured a jet black with a tall creamy tan head that rose quickly and spilled a little -- very active carbonation for a porter. Smell is beautiful, roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate with a light hoppy bite. Tastes amazing -- sweet chocolate, rich coffee with a light hoppy finish -- Delicious. Body is rich but not sticky, just right. A real treat. Almost up there with the Black Earth Porter from Great Dane. Definitely a porter fan from now on. Could drink these all day. Solid offering from Great Lakes. Highly recommended."
"[This was yet another brew from the ""Midwest Beer Barge"" trade with TikkiGodxxx - a good chance to try some fine brews that aren't normally available in California]"
"Drinkability: Overall, a very good porter. I'll definitely drink this one again."
"Drink: Perfect"
"This is a good quality porter. Not my favorite, but certainly one I will revisit. Any fan of the style should give it a try."
"Mouthfeel is rich and creamy, fills the whole mouth. Excellent porter. Thanks to Brent for sharing this beauty."
"It has been a long time since I have had this beer and I was pleasantly suprised when just tried it again. I don't remember this beer being as good as it tastes right now. Goes to show how palates change over time. This beer pours a dark brown with a light brown/tan head. The head slowly disipates to thin layer that stays around for a while. Mild lacing. The nose is of chocolate, malt, hops. The taste is chocolatey, malty, big caramel flavor on the back of the tongue. It has a nice bitterness to it is well. Good mouthfeel, medium body and carbonation. It is a very drinkable beer. I'm going to start picking this up more often. I highly recommend it."
"This is a nice beer that gives one the full flavors that might be expected in a stout, but less filling with a pleasant, mild drinkability. Would be a great pairing with something off the grill."
"This is one tasty porter!"
"Nice summer thunderstorms outside, good time for an Edmund Fitzgerald. Since my power only just came back on, the beer is already at perfect serving temp. Black body, nice big khaki head that stuck around. Nice smoky aroma, but not overpowering like in some porters. Plenty of room for some chocolate and coffee aromas to come through. Smooth velvety mouthfeel, carbonation is just right. There's nothing that really knocks my socks off about the taste, but it's just so well balanced and satisfying. Slightly roasty, some mocha and a little bit sweet. Nice bitterness to balance it. Very nice."
"Here's my one issue with the Porter . . . this 5.9% porter and the 9% Stout/Barleywine did not seem to much different. I actually prefer this to the latter. Very smooth down my throat and great mouthfeel. Appears thick and dark, almost like a stout. Better tasting as it warms. Not my favorite for the style or brewery but a good choice nonetheless."
"Side note - I talked my barkeep into a 2nd sample of this as I enjoyed the Chocolate Chip Ice Cream made with Edmund Fitz, and dunked each spoonful into the sampler....wonderful!"
"The drinkability of this beer was unbelievable. I thought the balanced flavor was perfect and my glass was empty in no time."
"Black colour with ruby/brown highlights topped by a thin, light brown head. Chocolatey aroma with some caramel and a slight grassiness. Dark chocolate, malty flavour, dryness from roasted grains is apparent starting mid-way through. Hop bitterness is restrained, but there is some bitterness from the grain as well. Medium carbonation combines very well with the medium/full body. The finish is on the dry side, with a lingering roasted bitterness. Very nice porter and one that I'd love to find on tap at some point."
"D- pretty decent. it would be tough to drink this all night because as of late i have started to favor high hopped beers, but as far as porters go, this is where its at."
"Amen, brother..."
"This is by far my favorite porter and from the tap it is simply perfection in a glass."
"D&N: I've yet to try something from this brewery I haven't really enjoyed, and this is no exception. Very well balanced, easy to drink, nice and mellow. Super beer."
"Pours a deep dark color with a light dark brown head. The smell is full of roasted malt, chocolote and caramel. This beer tastes wonderful. Very nice and chewy malt flavor with a pleasant aftertaste. A little bit of hop bitterness comes through, but mostly it balances the very malty base nicely. This one is delicious."
"12 ounce bottle. This beer pours out black with a huge tan head. The aroma is caramel, chocolate, and most of all coffee. Roasted malt flavor. Coffee, vanilla, chocolate, and oak flavors. There is a nice spicy hop flavor, and the finish is bitter. This is how a porter should taste. Full mouthfeel. Medium carbonation. This is an amazing porter, and at $5 a sixer, it's an amazing value too."
"12oz. bottle: This beer pours an opaque brown. There was a bit of a tan head that died off rather quickly. Nice big whiff of chocolate to the nose. Also some notes of roastiness and nutiness. The taste is somewhat chocolate sweet, with a nice bitterness to it also. Very smooth and drinkable. Thanks, Jay!"
"Pours a very dark brown out of the bottle, allowing very little light to come through. Light tan head quickly dissipates, yet is easily recreated with a little swirling. Smells of sweet malt and chocolate, well balanced with the hops, very pleasing. Perfectly carbonated, not too much and not too little, producing a very nice mouthfeel. Taste is of sweet, chocolaty, earthy maltiness. Slight hop flavor, and just the right amount of hop bitterness to offset the malty sweetness. Finishes well, with a little sweet bitterness lingering after the swallow. My favorite of the Great Lakes sampler I acquired, as well as my favorite porter of those I have tried so far. One to buy again."
"Taste: Superb flavour. I am completely enamoured with this thing as I reach the end of my plunge. ( Mouthfeel: ) Perfect texture. Smooth, rich chocolate that is at precisely the correct pitch to jive harmoniously with the beans. Hops are perfectly blended into the flavour scape. A balance that is tightrope worthy. A dark and rindy, bitter and smokey fat lady sings her storied part. This one earns the clout! I pine for another."
"complex and a winner overall. cant believe this is an old standard out in the midwest."
"Nice thick and substantial mouthfeel. Extremely easy drinker to boot. Way to go Ohio (as the Pretenders say)."
"Ahh yes, the beer that set me straight as far as Porters go. Great Lakes could almost straighten out Richard Simmons given the chance! This one gave me a whole new outlook on the style and set a new personal best. Pours very dark, almost as black as their Blackout Stout. Head is not overwhelming but appears as a beige specter hovering on top. Delicate lacing is on the sides of my glass. Smells of coffee, chocolate, and faintly of hops. Tastes like coffee, toffee, roasted marshmallow and bittersweet dark chocolate! Mouthfeel is fine, actually great! I could drink these forever."
"This is the beer that got me into GLBC. I remember ordering several of these in a row the first time I tasted this, simply because they were that good."
"A great porter to enjoy with a meal or just for the sake of drinking good beer."
"This is certainly one of the better porters I've had. Easy to drink, complex and quite smooth."
"I like Great Lakes. This porter pours a real nice dark brown color with little dark red highlights around the sides. Nice thick tan head floating on top. Smell is a bit hoppier than most porters I'd say, but there's also a strong roasted malt smell and a hint of sweet chocolaty scent. Taste is again a bit hoppier than most porters, kind of hits you up front and then comes the malt. There is a nice sweetness to this beer but it's really subtle and you have to pay attention to notice. Mouthfeel is smooth but maybe a little watery? I don't know what to think of this beer. On St. Patty's day I drank one of these for the first time, out of a bottle too, and thought it was fantastic. Maybe that was just because I had a Guinness right before that. So I went out and bought a couple bottles and brought them back to Mass with me and these ones don't seem to have the complexities that I initially noticed. I wish I could get some out here but it doesn't come here unfortunately. Don't get me wrong, it's a good porter. But I originally thought it was living up to all the hype as one of the best but the next two bottles haven't quite been as good as the first. Weird. I'll try some more sometime."
"pours a very dark ruby color, almost black, with a nice dark tan head. Smell is charred, charcoal like, very burnt, but yet very chocolatey at the same time. Taste is sweet caramel malts, backed up by an abundance of chocolate, and a slight biterness and earthy hop flavor. smooth in the mouth and very drinkable, a top notch porter, one that should be admired by all."
"Dated August 26, 2004. Dark and clear chestnut, but held to the light you can catch a bit of ruby. Khaki dusting in a ring. Wonderful aroma, thick chocolate and coffee with a bit of hops shooting through. Nice and dark! Smooth and silky, barely feel the carbonation, but not flat at all. Chocolate and hoppy flavors, bit with a snap in there... but yet smooth. Very nice and highly enjoyable! Thanks to Brandon/Pissky for this gifted brew!"
"Great Lakes continues to impress me, and this is not only no different, but I don't know if they make a better beer. I want to try the Blackout Stout, as seemingly that may be the only one that can rival Edmund Fitzgerald."
"Its been a while since I had this one. It pours a deep brown color with a slight ruby hues. There is a finger of head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is full of roasted coffee tones, with a slight chocolate in there as well. The flavor is very full, starting with a blast of coffee, fading really quickly to sweet chocolate, finishing slightly bitter. The feel is nice moderate to slightly thick. Overall, I really like the flavor and feel of this one. Everyting works very well together. I dig it."
"Deep mahogany color with medium mocha colored head. Wonderful chocolate/roasted malt aroma-not coffee scented, which it shouldnt have, but is still nice to not bee there, and worth a mention. So many porters swing to the stout way, and leave their roots behind. Back to the beer Blend of chocolate malt and roasted flavor. Chocolate flavor rests below the heavy roasted taste, which dominates the drink. Very light on the plate overall. Almost 1 dimensional where the roasted flavor is all you get for the most part. Although, there are different levels of the roasted malt in the taste, there should be something else there that isnt which would help with the body and feel."
"Mouthfeel is damn near perfect for the style...a nice medium body with small bubbly carbonation. I'd have to say this brew is incredibly drinkable...easily sessionable. Yet another super tasty, enjoyable brew from Great Lakes..one of my favorite midwest brewers!"
"Huge thanks to my friend Praneel for bringing me a mixed six pack of Great Lakes beers which included two of these world class porters."
"Mouthfeel is thick and grainy. A good stout, I've tried it before on tap. Quite drinkable but not a Top 50-caliber beer, in my opinion. Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for the chance to try this one in the bottle."
"Drinkability and Overall: I absolutly love this porter. One of the best I've had to date. The wonderul flavors and seductive aromas make this beer dangerously drinkable. This is a phenomenal porter that just doesn't quit. I love it."
"Pours dark black with a nice creamy light brown head that leaves a sticky lacing in my glass, roasty chocolate and coffee aromas. Roasted burnt chocolate, brown sugar and coffee flavors, good roasted bitterness in the finish. Medium body with soft and creamy mouthfeel, this is one of my all time favorite porters."
"A fine porter indeed. I haven't had a porter in months and this was a fine choice to rekindle my interest in the style."
"The generous use of malts combined with just the right amount of hops and carbonation make for a perfectly full mouthfeel, and a very drinkable beer."
"A last swirl - it easily awakens and sends up a dying coating of fine bubbles (great C02 level). A great Ship to go down on. We will cross again!"
"Slàinte!"
"Pours the darkest brown with a healthy two finger head, the remnants of which endure to the end. Aroma is roasted malts and bittersweet chocolate. Taste is what you would expect of a good porter ( chocolate, coffee, a bit smoky at the end) but with more hop balance, creating a wonderful aftertaste that begs for another gulp. Good thick mouthfeel, this is a beer I can (and on occasion have) drink all night."
"Nearly black with a thin head that sticks around for the entire beer. The nose is quite amazing. Lots of roasty, chocolatey, coffee-like notes right off the bat. Some hints of grape and caramel are noticeable as well. Taste is incredible. There is a certain smoothness to the beer. The malts are quite varied. There seems to be some roasted malts, along with some caramel malts to balance out the black patent. Very good ratios for this American Porter. Mouthfeel is quite bubbly and has just the right feel for a porter. It's not too dry and it's not too sweet. This is truly a great beer that can be enjoyed in many circumstances!"
"This brew is a black colored creation, with red/brown light hues. Small brown head leaves sheets of lace in its wake. Excellent chocolate malt scent. Taste features delicious chocolate malts, tone of roaste also come through, followed by excellently blended bitter hops. Full creamy mouth. Im not the biggest porter fan but this one was amazing."
"This was from a 12oz bottle sampled on 12/17/04. This can out of the bottle looking a deep brown that was almost void of light passing through. A top the body rose about an inch worth of tan foamy head that disappears fairly quickly leaving some rings of lace. A strong roasty malt aroma was first noticed before the chocolate malt set in. Very rich in the nose. Coffee was also present. The taste was a mix of bittersweet chocolate over a roasted malt and coffee. There was a good amount of earthy bitterness present as well. This ends on a slightly bitter roasted coffee note. Mouthfeel was about medium but fell a little short but was still creamy and rich. Good drinkability here as the mix of flavors keep this interesting and well balanced. This is definitely up there on my porter list. Thanks to clvand0 for the chance to try this great beer."
"Pours a deepest brown color with a light tan head. Good roasty malt profile with all the coffee and chocolate notes one tends to expect from a porter. Fairly hopped, which is a nice addition to any porter. Aggresively roasty, slightly fruity and mildly hoppy; makes for a beautiful balance. Wickedly drinkable. Probably Great Lakes best offering, in my opinion."
"I'm glad this beer is becoming more and more readily available. And I just heard the rumour it's going to hit the NYC market soon too."
"This is one exceptional porter. The best I've had. Pours a very dark, almost black with a garnet tinge when held up tp the light. Head is tan, thick rocky and holds up well. Leaves a nice lace on the glass. The smell is roasted coffee and maybe molasses. The taste is very rich coffee and dark cocoa with a perfect balance of hops. Carbonation was perfect. Mouthfeel thick and creamy. drinkability is dangerously good. You gotta try this one."
"My wife picked this up for me in Wisconsin when I asked for Lakefront! Well, it worked out good."
"This is now one of my favorite porters that I've ever had. I actually brought out one of my many beer books to look up the definition of a porter and it fit perfectly. The appearance was a dark brown/black not totally opaque. The perfect ammount of carbonation. A few trails up the glass after pouring. The smell of it is a combination of a chocolate/coffee/sweetness. The aftertaste is mostly chocolate and long lasting. Mouthfeel, is smooth and thick. You know you have a good porter when you want to savor and drink this beer slowly to enjoy every second of consumption. I'm quickly becoming a very big fan of the Great Lakes Brewery."
"This is a really good brew. Try it, even if you don't like porters."
"This is a very nice example of what a porter should taste like. This baby is pitch black and is dripping with roasted barley taste. I could pick up vanilla and coffee undertones. The only thing about this beer is that it is almost a little too intense for a porter. The flavors would not be appreciated by rookie porter and stout drinkers. All-in-all, this is a fabulous roasted, nutty, porter that is a fine example of the style."
"I really enjoy this porter. Leaves decent lacing on the glass, has a choclatey sweet aroma, slight roasty hint in the aroma as well. Taste is very well balanced between hoppiness and maltiness, almost like a struggle on your tounge. The Maltiness and roasty flavors come through in the finish. It's not as if I could taste hops, but I could tell they were there, ya know? I could see myself drinking this beer all night long..."
"I've had some good brews from Great Lakes Company, so I had high hopes for this one. Pours a dark brown color with a medium tan head that sticks around and leaves some nice lacing on the glass. The aroma was very strong with roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate. The flavor was just how I like it: thick body and extra malty. Has a nice chocolate and coffee flavor and is extremely smooth."
"12 ounce bottle. Add some oats and roasted barley, boost the body and this would stand as a well as a stout. Very well done."
"All the tasty porter flavors are here, with a very complex mix of bitter and sweet malts. The bitter coffee and sweet toffee malts just ooze over your tongue. A very faint hop is in there somewhere, but not much. Given my choice of food and attitude this evening, the GL porter is exactly what I needed/wanted. The porter has a very full body. It finishes dry in your mouth, but leaves a bit of the clingy malts in there as well. Well worth a few, which is very difficult, given all the high quality taps at the restaurant."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle with a creamy looking head over a glass of dark brown beer. The aroma is roasty with a bit of alcohol sweetness to it. The taste is full of crisp roastiness with chocolate, toast, caramel, and ending with a touch of floral hop flavor. It has a medium body on the palate with a clean finish."
"This is what I think of when I think of a porter. Gold standard status for me, just wish I could get this regularly."
"Thanks to wyllder for this exceptional brew! Poured almost black with a beautiful light chocolate head taht lasts...nice lacing. Smell is rich...malt...coffee...chocolate. Taste likewise is malt, coffee, chocolate...balanced with a nice hop presence throughout. Mouthfeel is a tad chewy....with a dry casting produced by the hopping. Smoooth on the drinkability scale...road trip to Cleveland???? Great brew."
"Deep garnet in color when held to the light, a strong toasty, chocolate/carmel aroma and a taste that always satisfies with multiple taste overtones (especially a subtle semi-sweet chocolate flavor) keeps me coming back for more. The mouthfeel is as close to velvet in your mouth that I could imagine. I can sip on these all night long, actually I have! Alcohol content is not too high to prevent quaffing a number of these beauties. An outstanding American porter. If you favor deep, dark, flavorful brews try EFP, you'll be glad you did."
"Not that good."
"Very quaffable porter here (the fact that it's past due really didn't affect the taste, although I'd love to try a fresh sample), but I probably wouldn't travel long distances for it again (I got this in Wisconsin). But if you see it somewhere, don't hesitate to grab a sixer or two for those cold days ahead. Just be sure to check the date!"
"Light-bodied. Moderate carbonation. Easy to drink. A tasty, right down the middle and out of the park home run porter."
"I waited a long time for this beer, and was not disappointed. It was black, sun blotting out dark. Nice choco head. It could easily pass for a stout, with a rich coffee taste. The hops sang out with each sip, which was a pleasant surprise. This was a great beer, porter or stout."
"This beer stradles the border of stout and porter. I don't get too hung up on style. This is one of my favorites. A must try for lovers of porter and stout."
"Pours a dark brown with a nice 2 finger off white head and excellent lace. Reddish colors appear when held to the light. Smells of wonderful roasted malt with chocolate and coffee. Taste is very good. A nice sticky swet malt with nice coffee flavors. Nicely balanced with the hops. It's not heavy at all like I expected it to be. I could drink lots of this."
"Drinkability is great also, i could down quite a few of these on a night."
"Drinkability/notes: A superb porter; it manages to distinguish itself in a style noted for excellence. Superb on a dark and cold afternoon. An elegant rememberance to those lost on that long ago day, November 10th, 1975, requiescat in pace."
"i like this one, and it's what all porters should strive to be, although, they almost never are and so i generally avoid the style."
"Very drinkable; Very yummy."
"I would not rank this beer as my top pick of porters but this would go wonderfully with a spicy seasoned London broil with some garlic mash potatoes."
"All in all, good porter but not my favorite from the bottle. I'd buy this if I was thirsty for a darker beer and they did not have any other porters."
"Pours black as night with a small head that gives way to a slight lace ring around the glass. Smell is slight burnt, roasty with a hint of powdered cocoa. Taste is. Well, taste is kind of plain. It has an exceedingly subtle flavor that even after a few sips I can barely name. Roasty malts, burnt chocolate with a lightly beautiful aftertaste just lingering on the palate. Mouthfeel is absolutely beautiful. What is it about most porters just going down smooth? Drinkability? Up there, you betcha. I could sip this one all night. Too bad I've only one bottle to keep me warm tonight."
"Drinkability: The first Great Lakes offering I experienced back in high school over ten years ago, and probably what converted me to a GLBC lover. I drank loads of this growing up in Ohio and attending college there as well, and still would if only it was available in NC."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1 1/2"" of tan head over the mahogany brew. Head was long-lived, and lacing was excellent. Aroma is deeply of coffee malts, with some sweetness and chocolate malts to soften the edges. Taste is follows the nose, with the coffee flavor lingering on the palate, but not in a bad way. Mouthfeel and drinkability are excellent. Man, these brews out MI way are almost worth a visit..."
"Another big o'THANKS to mattcrill for the bottle!"
"Pouerd out dark brown in color... appeared black due to bar lighting. big and mean coffee colored head. 2-3 finger thick and creamy. lacing left rings down the side of the pint glass. smell was extremely roasty, nutty and slightly sweet (chocolate) Taste corresponded with smell. Big roasted malt character was the most noticible. Mouthfeel was thick, and creamy. Not a very bitter brew. a very delightful beer. i enjoyed it greatly."
"this porter pours pitch-black with a dark brown loose head that lingered well. lacing was very little. smell is a chocolate-coffee assault. taste is of semi sweet chocolate and coffee with some buttery hints of toffee. dry finish. mouthfeel was slightly thick but not syrupy. very little carbonation. an awesome porter with a high drinkabilty. excellent example of the style. could drink a lot of these."
"This fine beer looks like a good porter should - extremely dark. No way you can see through that glass. The smell is also excellent and typical of a good porter - a delicious roasted chocolatey aroma. The taste is also fantastic. All in all a superb brew."
"Comments  Thanks to garthwaite for sending me not one, but two of these babies."
"Sampled on tap at the brewery. This gorgeous brew is a deep dark brown that approaches black with a thin lasting, sticky tan head. Smeet aroma that immediately gives notice of the quantity of chocolate malt & roasted barley used in this brew. Additional hints of chocolate covered cherry, roasted coffee, & a touch of both floral hops & campfire ash. Once in the mouth, this is absolutely delicious. A brief initial wave of bitterness is devastated by a huge, complex dark malt portfolio. Roasted coffee & bittersweet chocolate balanced beautifully by flavors of dark fruit & English hops. Medium bodied with a pleasant velvety mouthfeel. Long lasting bittersweet dry finish. Fresh on tap, the drinkability on this one is through the roof."
"This is without a doubt the best porter I have drank to date, and being that porter is one of my favorite styles, I've tried a good many. This beer came in a pint glass, through which I could just barely make out some translucency in the beer. It had a wonderful off white head and a rich, chocolaty aroma. The taste starts out with a tease of sweetness, which then becomes a complex blend of chocolate, malt, and slightly roasted flavors. This is one beer that I absolutley cannot have just one of. I would bring my wife to the pub to be my DD, but she likes this as much as I do!"
"Wyll-"
"Now this is a porter! Pours a deep black, light brown if held to the light. Good, lacy, long lasting, light off yellow head that clings to the side of the glass. Smells sweet, malty, and chocolaty. Taste delicious. Has that great porter taste, sweet and slightly hopped in the aftertaste. Malty and sharp flavor. Very drinkable and smooth, especially for a porter. A top notch brew."
"ng"
" I highly recommend this beer, but due to the intensity, I can hardly drink more than one. Easily my favorite porter!"
"The drinkability is actually fairly low on this one. Such a complex and fine beer that only one is enough. Enough cannot be said for drinking this one just about cellar temperature, because a beautifully delicate sweetness appears that makes the package absolutely undeniable."
"Final Thought: I love living in Ohio and having this beer available, clearly one of the best porters and beers available in Cincinnati."
"Like a master juggler keeping several balls in the air effortlessly, this splendid porter nimbly melds multiple elements into a fascinating progression of flavors. With nary a wrong turn, it meanders and winds from one tasty station to another. It's gutsy, but as full as it is, I defy anyone to drink just one, unless that's all you have on hand, which would be a real shame. The name is a memorial to a lost ship and its crew; the beer is a tribute to the artisans who crafted it."
"Black as night with a beautiful tannish head that leaves a great lace clingingto the glass. A sweet caramel candy smell follows as a coffee like taste is amazing. I absolutely loves this beer, too bad it doesn't make it out this far East. Certainly a world classic in the making. If you can find definitely buy it."
"A creamy tan head sits atop the dark brown liquid. Garnet hues shine through when struck by the light, and stick lace is left behind as the glass is emptied. Chocolate, coffee, and roasted aroma. Starts sweet with some caramel, then leads to dark chocolate flavors followed by roasted coffee and bitterness. Light citrus hops make a brief suprise appearance and round things up. Full-bodied, creamy, and velvety smooth. Well balanced, highly drinkable, and complex. Very tastey!!"
"This beer had very little head but smelled of a traditional matly porter. It's appearance was relatively dark, although not stout depth. The taste is the real kicker with this great beer, it is deep with hints of chocolate and tobacco that remain in the background of the rich porter taste. Highly recommended as a porter, easily the best beer made by Great Lakes."
"A very rich and thick mouthfeel made this brew extra pleasant. Very nice beer. Go GLBC."
"Pours a nice deep dark brown with a twinge of ""metallic"" orange color. Creates a real nice head about a pinky's width that settles down after a couple minutes. Leaves some lacing on the side as I drink it down. The smell is what first brought me to this beer. The coffee aroma makes me think I can have this for breakfast. Fabulous taste and mouthfeel with a nice little kick of spice at the end from the hops. Mouthfeel I feel is kinda light, which adds to it's drinkability. Drinking just one leads me to want another. Well crafted porter that I will definitely get again. Not sure why it has been sitting in my beer fridge for two months."
"Pours a very dark brownish color with some reddish highlights and a tall and creamy tan head with a nice retention. Nose is rich milk chocolate with some underlying aromas of fresh brewed coffee. Medium to full in body with a creamy and silky texture. Taste begins with sweet roasted malts along with a touch of dark caramel followed by a bit of a smoky and woody flavor. Some acidic coffee and a hint of citrusy bitter hops are present towards the finish. A marvelous porter. This was my first beer from Great Lakes, but hopefully not my last! Thanks to faernt for the sample!"
"Pours a dark deep brown liquid with some ruby highlights around the edges. The head is a wonderful tan color. The foamy head lingered for more than half of the glass, leaving a fair amount of lace on the glass. Smells like chocolate, and roasted espresso. The taste is immediately a roasted coffee, followed by a dry chocolate note. There is a modest amount of hop bitterness that seems to be in perfect balance. The carbonation was perfect. I felt that it is just a bit thin, but not enough to discourage. This would be a good session beer. Yes, I would love another, but unfortunately it is the last in the fridge (for now). Overall, this is a fantastic porter, easily the best one I have had to date. Great Lakes continues to wow me, particularly because they are consistent time and time again."
"There's a definate feel to it, though not as much as I thought there'd be, which makes for a very downable beer. Porter heaven. Forget about the Browns, the Ed Fitz is where it's at."
"Overall: I'd heard many good comments about this beer, and was able to give it a whirl thanks to the largesse of a friend in Cleveland. It has lived up to its reputation."
"many thanks go out to bighuge and zap for procuring this beer for me getting it to me safe and intact."
"I think the astringency I got in the mouthfeel turns me away from having multiple ones, but I would definitely enjoy this beer again, as long as I can find it."
"The mouthfeel is medium to light compared to beer I've been drinking lately, but I find it very much on style. It's a drinkable session beer"
"706"
"This is the tastiest porter i've ever had. The roasted, toasty flavor is just as addicting as the nutty undertones. And there is a really nice hop finish, which is really nice to see in a port. The mouthfeel was good, and it would have been better if not for the carbonation that was lost in the re-pour. I rated the score accordingly, which I may adjust when i drink this beauty again, without glass disasters hopefully. Do yourself a favor and get a sixer of this beer."
"Quite black as a porter should be, but with a suprisingly large, creamy, off-white head. Slightly sweet flavors of coffee with cream come through a mild hop bitterness, with only minimal carbonation. A delicious porter, and another reason why Great Lakes is a great brewery."
"While taking a respite from college for the weekend, I was shocked to find this beer in my dad's fridge mainly because his idea of exotic is Newcastle Brown... Maybe he's getting better... I can only hope. Poured (seemingly out of place) into a Dale Earnhart Jr. pint glass, this beauty was a nice dark brown with a decent sized tan head. Lot's of chocolate aroma in this beer and the taste doesn't disappoint. It has a nice woody malty flavor with some small hints of chocolate and the alcohol gets brought out as the beer reaches room tempature. At room temp. this beer is simply sublime. I will surely pick up some more Great Lakes products when I'm home as the only brew of theirs i can find here is Burning River."
"Nearly opaque and with a sizable head of mostly loose bubbles. Cookie dough in the aroma with some cocoa notes and roasted malt. Medium bodied and smooth. Great mix of flavors, coffee, roasted malt and a slight hop bitterness. Great Porter and a good session beer at that."
"Pours with a prodigious light brown head. A very dark beer that has deep red hints to it when held up to the light. Aroma is of roast coffee, and lightly sweet, with a strong chocolate malt presence and a bit of astringent roast character, though this is fairly muted. The light sweetness is here in the taste as well, though the dark malt character tends to mute it out. Roast malt notes with hints of coffee and a good chocolate presence round out the middle of this beer. Definitely a great example of a porter, the burnt malt character is fairly muted. Does not have as much of an acrid burnt malt finish as some, it is fairly smooth and drinkable like a good porter should be. The medium body helps the drinkability, though it has so much flavor packed in it I would not recommend pounding this one, nor would I want too as this beer is just too enjoyable. This one is nice and creamy. It has a bit too much burnt malt flavor, if the burnt character was balanced more towards the chocolate side of the spectrum this porter would be perfect."
"Medium-full body is nicely presented and makes this all the more enjoyable. An excellent porter that I may soon see added to my regular purchases."
"Thanks to CRJM for the bottles, another winner!"
"Opaque, sticky beige head. Roasty aroma, toast, coffee, chocolate, the breakfast of champions to which we add a good touch of hops. The flawless velvety, silky medium body melts the flavours together perfectly. Dark molasses and black chocolate/coffee are balanced by more roastiness than most and a solid bitterness. Remarkably well executed, just as I awaited from past experiences with Great Lakes. An equilibrium in the porters world."
"I've had the honor and pleasure of having this from the source back in Oct. '03, and I honestly have not had a finer porter, and I've had my share. And I will say without a doubt this is one of the best bottled porters on the market - a stellar ale indeed!"
"Basically blackish-brown in hue with ruby highlights where the light penetrated the sides of the glass, a finger of beige head tops off the beer in a lovely fashion. The head does fade to about half a finger quickly but the remainder holds excellently. Consequent lacing was webby but very prevalent. As a whole this is a great looking Porter. The potency of the nose is fantastic for a Porter, toasted malts, caramelized sugar, and a hint of roasted almonds, chocolate, and coffee. The individual aromas rarely stand-alone, it is an orgy of smells all focused on a common mission, create an inviting aroma indicative of a Porter. Mission accomplished. The palate is marvelously well rounded; upfront is a bite of citrusy hops that briefly charges ahead of the other flavors, the rest catches-up quickly. Roasted malts impart flavors of coffee and chocolate, toasted wood at the finish. I love the charred taste; it would be a great match with tangy BBQ or hickory-smoked steak, maybe even a gamey seared hen. Medium-full in body, it is rich and filling, a touch creamy, the carbonation is moderate and very soothing. The mouthfeel is good but just above ordinary. Obviously this is one drinkable beer. The aftertaste is big and charred. Awesome! Edmund Fitzgerald Porter is great; I cant say it is that better that Fuller's London Porter! They are both dandies but this bad boy is nearly flawless! Thank you PhantomVodoo!"
"It pours a dark bown color with a small tan head. The beer smells of carmel and roasted malt. It's got that sweet smell to it and you know it's got the malts. The taste at first is the roasted malt a sweet coating of the mouth warms you up. Then a distinct hoppy taste finishes the drink. Overall a very well made porter one of the best for sure."
"Classic porter that would stad up to anyhting that the UK would brew. Would sell very well with true porter lovers in the UK."
"A very smooth but flavorful brew. A fine example of a porter."
"Most importantly, this is very easy to drink. It's fairly complex and very tasty."
"Well thats 3 Great Lake beers tonight, a real ménage-a-trois of crackers that I would not mind having again. Cheers to BigHuge for delivering another winner from Great Lakes to Long Beach."
"A very dark brown with a nice thick foamy head and lacing. The head fades after a minute but the lacing is still there. Smells of raosted malts. Sweet smelling and strong presence of a chocolate/nutty aroma. The taste is that of a delicious blend of chocolate and coffee. Smooth body and a nice blend of all the flavors including a hint of hops to add to the overall make-up of this brew. Great aftertaste and a very drinkable porter. Another salute goes out to the Great Lakes Brewers!"
"A very memorable porter. I happen to have a GL Edmund Fitzgerald pint glass and made full use of it when sampling this porter. Everything about this beer was above average compared to all the other porters I've had in the past. The best part? It's still distinguishable as a porter instead of a wannabe stout. I'll be back for more!"
"A quality porter well-deserving of it's reputation!"
"Finally!! I get this review down after several bottles of this wonderful beer. Despite its dubious origins (Cleveland) and the fact that it gets Gordon Lightfoot stuck in my head, Edmund Fitzgerald may well be the best porter out there, and this is absolutely one I'll have again!"
"Stuff tastes good though. A smooth transition from malts at first gulp to a slightly tangy hops touch as it goes down. It sits in the mouth pretty nicely, the tang from the mellow hops giving it a little pop to the tastebuds. A nice beer all around, one I will definatly drink again."
"Again, thanks to MotoRacer36 for this brew!"
"Note: after many more bottles (and most of its serious competition), I still consider Edmund Fitzgerald to be the world's best American porter. 8-5-09."
"If you can get your hands on this one, do so. Rock on Cleveland, you make some fine beer there..."
"Thank you PhantomVoodoo for this bottle"
"Another great beer from an outstanding brewery. Pouring this beer results in a solid black body with tan foam. Chocolate aroma and nice lacing add to the experience. Taste and mouthfeel are very good. Roasty, coffee, and chocolate tastes with a very nice, creamy mouthfeel. Very nice."
"Just a great beer. Berry-black with a beige head, slight see thorough capability. Beautiful mint and milk and dark chocolate flavors give way to a clean dry finish. A classic from Great Lakes either in the bottle or,even better on tap at the brewery."
"Pours very deep ruby-brown, with a medium rocky tan head, medium diminishing to leave bunches of lace. Aroma is strong - roasted malts, big chocolate, and some coffee. Flavor is very smooth chocolate, with some bitter coffee in the finish. Medium-full bodied, slightly creamy mouthfeel."
"Small head on the pour,aroma was faint, really had to dig but there was a little chocolate there,taste however was very bold,nice chocolate taste fills the palate with a coffee aftertaste, little bit of a chewy texture, distinct currant taste comes on to mix with the always present mocha flavor,towards middle it gets sweeter, almost like hershey syrup. This is really good stuff. Would have rated it higher if there had been a fuller aroma."
"Almost opaque dark chestnut pour, beige head disappeared in aabout a minute with minimal lacing. Nose is inviting, dark fruits overshadowed by coffee and chocolate. Mouthful is medium bodied. Taste mirrors the nose, and improves as the glass nears room temperature. Overall excellent brew. Deserving of its reputation!"
"Great taste, above average mouthfeel is noticeable a good 5.5 years later bottle. Great example of American porter, with good roast and chocolate malt,drying finish."
"This beer is quite deserving of the reputation it has and did not dissapoint. Deep dark color with ruby edges showing through and a cafe au lait head with little lacing here and there. The smell was dominated by notes of very sweet raisins and just a hint of day old coffee and roasted malts. Taste was full of sharp bitter coffee and kiln roasted grains but it was mostly a coffee taste that dominated with the nice scratchy porter finish due to a good addition of hops and a balanced carbonation. Well done Great Lakes!"
"Overall, a fine porter. Chocolately with a nice hop balance."
"I went lower on drinkability because, sadly, this beer didn't agree with my system. Two of these and I felt queezy, one and I'm OK. Too damn bad for me."
"Pours into the glass a dark black with reddish highlights which are particularly apparent in the light. A thick, foamy, tan to off-white head nicely caps the beer and adds to its already inviting appearance. Smells of roasted malt and coffee. Not unexpectedly the taste is also of roasted malt and coffee, with a bit of bitterness in the finish which nicely balances the flavors. Smooth, medium/full bodied, and highly drinkable. Overall a very good beer which I look forward to having again."
"I drank three in Indy and brought the rest back on the plane with me. No sharing with family, just hoarded for myself. I'm finishing one of my three even as I complete this review. Edmund Fitzgerald Porter is one of the best porters I've tasted. Incredibly easy to drink and velvety smooth, it's a must-find for any lover of a good porter."
"The taste is very nice. You get just a hint of burnt malt followed by a very smooth, almost sweet, wave of chocolate and coffee. Hops show up but are not overly intrusive. Mouthfeel is medium. Thankfully they don't overcarbonate this bad boy. A very balanced porter that ranks tight up there."
"Impressively rich. A touch of sweetness leads dark roast espresso, bittersweet chocolate, & a bit of plums. A very subtle touch of smoke leads to a dry finish. Balanced hop bitterness executes on a dime without being overbearing. Dark roast flavours linger. Rich & full bodied, smooth, with moderate carbonation. An amazing accomplishment in brewing."
"Pours out a murky, almost completely opaque brown. Small, nicely defined head that dissipates fairly quickly. Smell is sweet chocolate and coffee overtones. Taste is smooth and silky, reminiscent of a complex stout, its more famous and available cousin. Lots of chocolate presence intermingled with a smoky coffee and raisin bread feel. Very drinkable. A delight to behold, instantly one of my favorite porters.."
"Excellent moderate mouthfeel, for me textbook for the style; it really added to the beer as a whole. A rich and drinkable beer, an excellent version of a pub porter."
"F"
"Damn good porter that makes me want a rib eye like right now. Deep brown in color with amber tinges on the borders-aromas of cafe au lait, some milk sugar aromas as well. Full bodied and expressive in the mouth with delicious roasted coffee bean flavors and a fine balace between bitter and sweet malt. This beer has a built in affinity for red meat, and one can practically taste a meaty element in the beer itself if one thinks hard enough."
"Pours a dark brown with slight ruby highlights. Beautiful long-lasting, creamy light tan head. Sticky lacing trails down the glass. The aroma consists of chocolate malt, roasted coffee and a touch of vanilla. The mouthfeel is smooth and medium-bodied. What the aroma alluded to remains true in the flavor. Chocolate, roasted coffee and dark brown sugar all reveal themselves before a dry middle. Cascade hops mark the start of a long rewarding finish. Wow, what an amazingly delicious porter!"
"Dark black color. Small head. Aroma is chocolate and coffee. Small head. Aroma is chocolate and coffee. A full-bodied porter. Malts are roasty, chocolate and coffee. Slightly bitter. Nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"A huge thanks to AKSmokedPorter for hauling this back from Ohio for me. ""Ed FiP"" (as my fellow BA's/frat brothers call it) has done me right."
"Along with Kalamazoo my favorite midwestern micro beers,this beer is one of the reasons why.Pours a deep creamy brown with a very creamy off white head.The aroma is very coffee-like with some bitter chocolate notes.The taste is also very coffeeish with some slight earthiness, very creamy tasting.A smoky backbone to this makes this a great complex example of the style."
"Aromas of roasted coffee, water and skim milk. The palate features a creamy texture with flavors of burnt things. Dry. Weathered, seasoned wood emerges later on the nose. Simple, foursquare flavors of browned starch. Drinkable if forgettable."
"Pours deep chestnut... almost opaque, but a little light passes through. Has a 1/4 inch head that has good retention and leaves behind patches of lace. Aroma is slightly understated, with the presence of chocolate, malt, and some herbal undertones. Flavor is bold and beautiful... combining malty sweetness, some chocolate, coffee and a light herbal bitterness. Has a medium to full body that is smooth and creamy. An top-notch porter in my book!"
"A dark, dark brew. Hints of a ruby red gem in the light. Truly porter-like in terms of body -- a beefy, bold flavor packed into a medium to full-bodied brew. A slight burnt aroma with some toffee and chocolate. Bit chocolate flavors for a beer brewed, as far as I know, without an adjunct of the same name. Very slight hop bitterness that blends in with the naturally big malt flavors. This is one of the most drinkable, flavorful, well-balanced porters I can think of. Good stuff."
"This brew poured a medium sized head of medium sized light brown bubbles with a semi-opaque brown body. It has a mild malt aroma with the coffee flavor of a stout. It was smooth yet had a bit too much coffee for a porter. This would be better classified as a stout."
"Deep brown hue, tan and well formed foamy head, excellent retention and a fair amount of lacing. Dark roasted malts on the nose. Roasted malts, smokey and licorise flavorings noted off the top. Medium bodied, a touch bitter, pleasantly malty, well balanced, some hops towards the end, with a dry finish. Superb flavoring, great character, superb session porter, defines what a porter should be"
"Definitely a fine session porter, and a refreshing change from those that are too heavy on the maltiness, over-hopped, or too sweet."
"Many thanks to 'Realale' for lugging this brew back from Michigan for me!"
"This beer has a very blunt chocolate/coffee taste on the front. A roasted flavor accompanies the mix but its not nuts. The hops are definitely there and save this beer from being too sweet and then they make this beer what it is- A truly great porter! It finishes dry and sweet with more roasted flavors. Very dark and pretty thick. Hats off to great lakes."
"Recomended!"
"Taste: well, I am impressed. Somehow, Great Lakes has managed to create a beer that tastes so connected to its appearance and aroma, which is rare. All of the notes in the nose appear in the taste, slight bitterness, but fades to a malty sweet goodness quite quickly. VERY full bodied, and the mouthfeel is outstanding. Hops, malt, roasted barley make their way into your senses and do not let go! Truly a shining example of the porter style, and the only drawback (drinkability) was affected by its carbonation level - a little much IMO that detracted from the incredible taste and body. Otherwise, a prototypical example!"
"Expertly balanced, and consistently awesome. This is excellent stuff. Since Bell's has been so inconsistent, the once awesome Bell's Porter that I so fondly recall has been replaced by the Edmund. This is what Bell's Porter used to taste like back in the day. Heavenly stuff folks. Top porter in it's class, bar none."
"My kinda session beer, Gordon Lightfoot would be proud!"
"Originally sampled on 10 November 2002. This beauty has a roasted caramel aroma; a dark brown color w/ a two finger tan head. Lots of complex roasty/toasty/tasty flavors, almost like a dry stout. In my book this is a very well done porter and was definitely worth trading for"
"Still an excellent porter, and one which I'd greatly appreciate more, if it were available in my environs."
"This beer poured a dark coffee brown, almost black color. It was topped off with a creamy light brown head. Immediately was overwhelmed by the rich roasted coffee and bitter chocolate aromas. Smells great. The taste is toasted and roasty, bitter, spicy and dry. Very drinkable. Hop bitterness is there, too along with some caramel. All the flavors intensify as the the beer warms up. An excellent beer for a rainy night or anytime."
"Taste sails along in roastyness, smooth at first, then the waves begin to pick up with sweet tinglyness, darkening up, a surge of bitterness through hops and ends into a light lingering smokey feel, woody, coffeeish finish. Moderately dry port to starboard, through and through. Feel is full and heavy, proudly bittering dry right on into the depths of finishing. Much like the ship, this beer sets sail but sadly never ports again. A bit disappointed in this porter being a fan of the great lake and the story of the Fitz. Was hoping for more weight and robustness. Still a very decent porter and won't turn it down for nothing. The bell tolls for thee, Edmund Fitz."
"I had this one in a 12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep black with 1 finger of light tan head that dies down quickly. There is a bit of lacing on the glass. The smell is a roasted coffee smell, very pleasant. The taste is full of coffee, toffee, and caramel. There are a good amount of hops to balance out these flavors. The mouthfeel is very heavy and thick. At only 5.8%, this is a very drinkable and enjoyable porter."
"A chewy and creamy body complements the well-balanced flavor that this fantastic porter provides. This beer deserves all the accolades it receives. It is now firmly ensconced in my private top beer list."
"A nice representation of the Fitzgerald!"
"This beer pours a very slightly hazy very dark brownish red with a large dark tan head. The mouthfeel shows a slight firmness. The smell is sweet smoke with a faint coffee aroma. The taste is smooth toasted malt with a coffee-like bitter finish and a slight underlying sweetness. This is a very smooth porter with a pleasant lingering coffee flavor."
"Medium-full body and an almost perfect carbonation level combined with the taste, make for one very drinkable beer. Great Lakes does it again."
"In size, creamy in texture, the color a light chocolate brown, the residual lace a thick clinging sheet. Toasted grain lots of malt and to me a sweet black walnut aroma noticed, a fine sniffer at any rate. At the front sweet, the top slender in its feel to the palate, finish has a splendid hop spiciness, the carbonation mild, with the aftertaste droughty and lingering, a fine porter."
"This was my first experience with a porter and it impressed me during the first bottle. The color is very dark, a deep brown with reddish tints, and the head, though small, was creamy and dark tan. This brew is all about taste. My best adjective for this is complex; the flavors are well balanced, but there are a multitude of impressions from a single gulp. Coffee, chocolate, bit of hoppiness; did I miss nutty? Though I'm used to lighter beers, I'll come back to this nice recipe from GLBC."
"Great lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter: Hell yeah, on tap, this is one remarkable beer. “really terrific” is my note, and that describes it very well. Not much to look at (probably a bad pour) Smooth flavor, this was a nice easy drinking (but sweet) beer, that I’d recommend to anyone. I’ve got not many notes, but I like it."

"Damn, I think I have found the perfect porter. This beer is poetry in pouring, that settles out with a black almost opaque hue. The head settles out nice and thick just the way I like it expressing a milk chocolate color, that is resiliant and almost everlasting. Clings to the glass like it's holding on for dear life, this beer leaves an amazing lace on my glass. Containing hints of chocolate, coffee, and other dark roasts this porter has it all. You realize that the aroma and appearance isn't all this beer is made of, the taste is built up to so nicely that this beer has already been a journey of the senses. Initially the this beer dances around the sweet tooth in my mouth, to balance out in the swallow to a nice smooth dryness that soothes and nurtures my senses. This beer on tap is dangerously drinkable, due to the fact that not only can I drink alot of it, but it is like liquid crack without the negative effects. Bottom Line: Great Lakes = Great Beer!!!"
"This is the best porter I have had to date. It's not too sweet so I can definitely enjoy a few of these or more in a session. Try this if you like porter, or want a first taste at what a great porter should be."
"Going for another!"
"Poured from a bottle that appears to be dated enjoy by 15 Jan 03. Opaque black in color with a nice creamy brown head. Some reddish, mohagony hue in head along the side of the glass and beer itself. Aroma most notably presents heavily roasted malt (nutty) and coffee scents. Awesome flavor. Nutty, heavily roasted malt and coffee flavors. Fairly neutral, meaning not overly sweet or bitter. Exceptionally well balanced. Hops show in the end, but finishes very cleanly. Excellent, creamy mouthfeel. Exceptional drinkability for a beer of this magnitude. Overall, still my favorite porter. It was one of the very first porters I tried and I'm often disappointed upon trying other porters because most just don't match up to the Edmund Fitzgerald."
"What a porter!!!! I'm moving to Cleveland...this is a big porter....a ton of hops but it has the malt to balance it perfectly....Nose is dark chocolate...coffee....and leather....body is perfect.on the thicker side of medium...creamy....taste is dark cocoa...even a hint of dark fruits....and a nice...very nice hop finish....this is the way you make a porter...maybe the best I've had...a dandy.."
"Dark java color, some ruby-red light transmission at the bottom of the pint glass. Close to 1/2 an inch of tawny tan and creamy foam that laces pretty nicely. A little acidity to the aroma. Flavor is slightly smokey and nicely malty, a sense of sweetened coffee with a squirt of lemon and a finish of nice hop and dark roasted malt bitterness. Senses of treacle and semi-sweet chocolate in later sips. Feels like they use American hops here. No wimpy ""brown"" Porter this, a good and complex one. Excellent on tap..."
"Thank you PhantomVoodoo for sharing the wealth."
"This is another well crafted brew from Great Lakes and a textbook porter. The color is just shy of black...light is just barely able to escape its surface. It sports a tan colored head that reduces to just a cap but leaves a fair bit of lace. The aroma is of dark roasted malt, molasses, and a whisp of sourness (the kind which is much more pronounced in Sierra Nevada Porter, I believe due to a healthy hop presence wafting through the dark roasted malt). This brew is chock full of dark roasted malt flavor (reminds me of a dry irish stout, but with a lighter mouthfeel)...some dark roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate, plus a hint of citric hops. There's just enough sweetness to take the edge off the bitterness without competing for your attention. A very tasty brew."
"A rough pour will bring up a full inch and a half head of densely creamy tan head. The body is a very dark brown - not quite opaque as mahogany highlights can be seen at the base and rim of the glass - but basically ""black"". The head eventually drops to just a collar but leaves some nice lace. The aroma is nicely fruity, chocolatey and coffee-ish - almost candyish (chocolate covered cherry?). Very welcoming! The body is firm with a very fine and gentle carbonation that's creamy in the mouth. The flavor starts with sweet and fruity notes amongst a deep roastiness, becomes more chocolatey as it crosses the palate and into the swallow, and then unleashes an intense coffee character that includes flavor as well as roastiness and bitterness. Amazingly, some citrusy hop flavor appears out of nowhere and lingers along with a mocha character and some bitterness in a long finish. Really well balanced, very drinkable, and complex. I was quite impressed with this beer. Well worth seeking out."
"This is a great porter. It is not a sweet porter, but rather a big, somewhat dry porter. It exhibits coffee and dark chocolate aromas white a nice roasted flavor. It has a wonderful head and a dark, almost black body. Great Lakes sells this in a sampler pack, which is good, because I don't have to choose which one of their beers to buy. Another beer high on my personal best list from Great Lakes."
"If I had to pick one beer to drink for the rest of my life...this would get serious consideration."
"Cheers to jtw5877 for the trade. It's goes against my principles to associate with anything from Cleveland, OH. That being said, this is a very good beer.(jtw5877 is from Canton, so he's ok.)  Deep black color, amber hues. Tan foamy rich head, covered the beer to the bottom, laced nicely.  Smells were sweet roasted malt, slight roasted bitterness. Taste was smooth sublte hops, very slight, and a sweet roasted chocolate backbone. Very smooth, lightly carbonated. Rich and creamy feel. A mix of sweet chocolate flavors, and roasted bitterness linger. A very pleasant, surprisingly good porter."
"Greater than the sum of its parts. This was my introduction to the Great Lakes line, and I don't know if they can top this. Hints of coffee and somewhat dry, consistently good flavor throughout."
"Okay, we got to have this on tap for a change.  It poured a nice dark brown, almost black color.  Had a descent light tan head.  Aroma had elements of coffee and malt.  The taste also had malt and coffee with some chocolate.  A little lighter then most other porters I have had, but still a good beer."
"Nice, deep black color. Very dark. Good tan head that leaves good lacing on the glass. The aroma is a little mild, and you pick up citric hops over the rich malt aromas. The taste starts off rich, with a coffee-like (not as much as some others, but still there) and caramel/toffee mix of the malts. This is lightened up a bit by the ample hops. The beer is surprisingly light and drinkable despite the richness of the flavor. An easy drinking example of a porter that's basically a stout light."
"Pours a deep dark brown with a medium head. Dark roasted malt flavors abound. With enough hops to make it just right. A great beer from Cleveland. Dark and delicious, a superior porter. GLBC always comes through. I'd recommend this to anybody who likes porters."
"Notes: The brewers of GLBC can not do any wrong, an eye-filling brew. This is the proper way to craft a traditional porter ... drink and learn."
"All's well with this primo porter."
"A dark almost black, chewy, chocolatey, well balanced version of a porter. Hard to find fault with this one."
