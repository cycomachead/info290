"Quite possibly the best thing Sam Adam's has ever made. Sweet, syrupy and thick with heavy hints of maple syrup, meaty smoke, malts, almond, marzipan and touches of coffee and chocolate. Definitely want to drink this one when you're cold."
""
"I thought this was a great porter. I appreciate drier more roasted porters with more hops. I can also appreciate a sweeter porter like this one. The maple syrup is easy to detect. This would be a great desert porter."

"O: This is like having a maple bar in drinkable form. It has maple syrup in it, according to the label, and you can tell. There's quite a bit of complexity too. This is a great porter."
""
"This pours a dark brown color with a foamy beige head. The aroma is very malty with hints of maple and pecan. The flavor is thinner than expected but rather interesting. There are some very nutty tones with just a touch of maple shinning through. Not my favorite Sam Adams brew yet has an interesting flavor for the ingredients."

"Slightly less than OK. I got it as part of a mixed seasonal 12- pack (I'm a sucker for mixed 12-packs to try out a few of a breweries' different offerings) , otherwise I tend to stick to IPA's and other hoppy types without really trying a broader range of a brewer's styles. So while I normally retch at the thought of a pecan/maple flavor beer, I tried it anyway. It turned out as bad as I had feared, with the taste being an artificial-flavor rendition of maple and (lesser) pecan. Turrible from Sam Adams. I still enjoy several of their other less bizarre flavors. It's very possible that I just don't appreciate this style of beer."

"12 ounce bottle, best before May 2014. Got this bottle from a friend last weekend. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a dark ruby red/brown color with about a half inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice and sweet, it smells like maple, nuts/pecans, and roasted malt. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some caramel, chocolate, coffee and a bit of smokiness. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit syrupy and creamy with moderate carbonation. I liked this brew, and if you like sweeter tasting beers then I would recommend it."

"Pours a deep rich ruby red-brown in color with a very thin off-white head. Some spotty lacing is seen. The aroma is of roasted malts, toffee, maple syrup and nuts. The taste is about the same with slightly more aroma of the above ingredients that the actual taste. Still great flavor for sure. Perfect carbonation for the type. No harsh or bitter aftertaste is noted."
""
""
"Appearance has a dark ruby brown color supporting a thin dissipating head leaving fair lace. Smell of maple, coffee and dark caramel malts. Taste has the dark malts, flavor of coffee and syrup with a nice balance of hops. mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. Overall a nice twist on a good porter."
""
"Taste starts out with a malty front, pecans follow with a good sized presence, finishes with a lingering caramel sweetness, not much of a hop balance so this porter may be a touch too sweet for some but it's not overly artificial tasting either, body is fairly decent with a slickness to it, soft but ample carbonation lend an almost creamy texture."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Tasty enough. Needs more hops and malt even. Not enough bitters and sweets. Sips more like a Black Lager than Porter. Just build upon what is currently here and there you go. But nonetheless, a tasty beer you have to sip quick before flavor dies. Not a bad sampler to have two of in a 12-pack seasonal box."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with a slightly creamy beige head, slowly fading and some lacing. Aroma and taste of sweet malt, roasted caramel and some pleasant maple syrup flavor. Palate is a medium body, slightly creamy with mild carbonation and a bit sticky. Finishes with a sweet lightly roasted caramel and a bit of nutty pecan maple syrup ending. Overall a good drinking and flavorful brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall nice flavor, sweet dried maple-coffee really hits the intended mark. Easy drinkability. Intriquing and different."
""
"overall a good porter. the maple and pecan are unique. but are very subtle and pick up at the end. the coffee over powers the chocolate which is out of balance. but i was impressed with SA and this porter. its no game changer, but a good quality porter. i would buy it again but, my go to porter is and always will be Edmund Fitzgerald. cheers!"

"355ml bottle. Nonic glass. Pours dark brown in color, with mahogany tints to the light. Tan head leaves a thin layer on top as dissipates. Some lacings are left. Aromas of sweet roasted malts, caramel notes, hints of syrup & dried nuts as well as coffee & chocolate hues. Flavor profile -as expected from aromas- displays caramel & roasted notes, chocolate & coffee infusion touched by herbal sweet syrup. Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Silky palate & dried mouthfeel. As it warms, maple syrup increases & lingers into a sweet finish in combination with arising dried nut sensations. Sweetness reaches the edge of cloying but slightly roasted notes & nuttiness hold it back. Interesting Porter that makes me miss a hot Pecan Pie!!"
""
""
""
""
" Overall I give this a well-deserved 4.5. From the brown head and great scent, I knew I was in for a treat. And right I was! The taste's combination of maple,coffee,and chocolate is bar none in my opinion.What a tasty trio! I will certainly buy this brew again."

"Overall a decent porter. Not sure it's great spring selection. IT would be tasty at Thanksgiving, or as a winter ale."

"I was impressed by this Sam Adams offering.. I only wish it were available in six packs as I would by it often during the season."
""
"O: Decent, worthy of a drink, but not something Id go to frequently. The sweetness comes off as artificial, and more traditional porter notes would be appreciated."
""
""
"I'm glad Sam Adams came up with this. I only wish they had it in more places. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"O - Can anyone say ""breakfast""? This is what I think IHOP would serve if they sold beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Strong maple/malty smell, nothing special as far as looks or mouthfeel. The flavor started out nice, but the more I drank it and as it heated up a touch, the sweetness became too cloying to drink and borderline unpleasant. Would only recommend drinking promptly straight out of the fridge, I guess."
"As the name implies, strong whiffs of maple and pecan greet you upon opening the bottle. Slightly sweet, the warm rich tones amplify an overall pleasant appearance. Quality taste reflected in strong caramel tones was only offset a little by - at times - too much sweetness."
""
""
""
"Taste-Toasted malt, short little stab of sweet maple marked with a nutty roastiness. Nice balance and flavor. A nice match for a slice of pecan or pumpkin pie,"

"On par with what I expected of a flavored Sam Adams brew. Maple and pecan could really be amazing if done well in a porter, but this is weak and a bit artificial."
""
""
""
""
"Samuel Adams continues to set the bar for microbrews as far as I'm concerned (even though it's hard to think of them as a microbrew any more.) Nonetheless, this Maple Pecan Porter pours a beautifully dark Guinness-esque color while emparting a tannish head that has decent staying power and lacing all the way down. The nutty aroma mixes well with the hops and compliments the strong porter. There's also just about the right mix of malts, maple, hops (I wish I had more than two from the variety pack to partake.) Overall, a great beer. The kinda beer to enjoy slowly and in larger quantities than two..."

"O: Worth a try . Interesting, but the nose is better than the taste. Recommended."

"Poured into a tulip glass. Pours a dark brown with a thick, light tan head that dissipates slowly. The are aromas of malts and a little nutty from the pecans. The pecan smell is more intense than in some other pecan ales I've sampled in the past, which works well for this porter. The flavor is very pecan with hints of coffee and maple as well. The pecan is the star of the show here. The body is medium with light carbonation. This beer drinks very well and the finish is only slightly dry. This is excellent porter by Sam Adams, that I highly recommend!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer provided no surprises- everything you'd expect from the name of the beer is exactly what you'll taste. A good beer, though. Another solid offering from the Boston Beer Company."
""
""
"The Verdict: Not bad. The maple syrup sweetness assaults your tongue at first, but the rest of the flavors begin to emerge once you recover. Nice combination of ingredients."
""
""
"Overall: Well done. I didn't even realize this was in the variety pack and got excited to try their iteration of a porter. Pretty outstanding. Nothing puts it above and beyond any of the others I've had, but it's definitely not bad in any category. If I had had this blind, I wouldn't have guessed Sam Adams made it. They should try making more dark beers. Have the nerve to sell it in six packs man!"
""
"Overall: Not bad, but I have had better offerings from both the maple and pecan perspective. The maple shows up at the end of the beer, but does not shine all the way through. I think having this flavor a bit more present, would make me enjoy this more. Not a bad beer, but certainly disappointing and one I would probably pass over."
""
"O: Rich and decadent concoction of maple goodness, coffee and chocolate. The nuttiness brings out the natural flavors to compliment the sweetness. Sweetness almost breaches the point of cloying but holds back."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The name sums it up."

"Overall - It is a really good beer."

""
""
"save your pennies and move on this stuff is poor"
""
""
""
""
""
"The malts come forward in the taste but the maple is quick to penetrate the senses with the pecans more behind the pack and still a good smoky quality. Mildly bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The beer is awesome and has great flavors that work well with each other. It has the sweetness of maple syrup and the bitter roasted notes that you expect from a porter and pecan notes. The only downside is that it's a very unique flavored beer and the sweetness from the maple syrup can become overwhelming if you have more than one. If, however, you choose to have one to relax or just to taste it, it's so worth it."

"O: I'm glad the maple pecan doesn't overwhelm and become cloying but I wish there was more roasty malts and overall body"
""
""
"Overall: If you love Porters and have a sweet tooth, this one is for you. Part of me is really scared that Sam Adams may stop making this beer. I only had one bottle and have craved a second ever since. This would never leave my refrigerator if it were available in 6 packs."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a dark red/black with a small off white head. Smells of some coffee, but it almost smells if maple syrup was dumped in the beer, but it doesn't ruin it. Tastes initially of coffee very strongly, then finishes very nicely with the maple syrup, very nice contrast and balance. Beer is very lightly carbonated, and for a medium body, goes down nicely and could possibly be sessionable. Overall a very good beer."
""
"The Rest: Body is just on the thin side of medium and drinkability is very good. This is the second beer in the sampled pack that I've been quite impressed with."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability- I thought it was pretty good. I probably wouldn't buy it again but I would definitely drink it again."

"Pours a mahogany body with a big tan head that dissipates pretty quickly. Aromas are overwhelmingly sweet and reminiscent of a table full of steaming flapjacks and hot pecan pies with a hint of roastiness and autumnal earthiness. Tastes like liquid toffee on the front palate, with the sweetness building with notes of maple syrup on the midpalate, before a woodier, earthier elements make the presence notes. Bitter pecan skin comes out on the finish, but not enough to make you forget that this is a super sweet, dessert-like beer. Overall a fun novelty."
"-pairs well with some roasted candied pecans"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a maple beer that stands out. I have had several that have disappointed, but I really like the flavor of this one. The pecan adds an earthy touch to mellow the sweetness. Tastes great on a cold spring day."
""
"Pours a black color. One inch head of an off-tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of roasted malt, nut, sweet malt, hint of yeast, slight hop, slight dry hop, and a hint of pale malt. Fits the style of an American Porter. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, dry hop, hint of hop, slight nut, and a hint of yeast. Overall, good appearance, aroma, feel, blend, but slightly cloying in sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not much of a porter, this is more of a gimmicky beer (and not a very good one, at that)"
""
""
""
""
""
"overall an interesting and flavourful brew. albeit slightly cloying. i can only imagaine this as a perfect beer for a lumberjack. it's like liquid breakfast if you fancy your pancakes with real maple syrup. and bacon. or ham."
""
""
""
""
"Ugh! Something wrong with this beer."
""
""
""
"You really could drink this for breakfast. Hash browns, sausage and maple pecan porter! The best beer out of the Sam Adams winter 2012-13 variety packs."
""
""
""
""
"Not my favorite style, but this one is not bad..."
""
"Overall the sweetness of the maple character dominates here as the malt depth is otherwise a bit thin, yet not in a bad way per se as the maple is interesting in itself. Nice drinkability and the preferred offering in a 'spring thaw' mix pack."
"O: One and done. I expected more from the inclusion of pecans and didn't get it."
""
""
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt, toasted nuts, earthy wood, and some maple aromas that come out more as the beer warms up. Taste is much the same with sweet praline pecan and maple flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some nice maple and pecan aromas and flavors that work well together."
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely sweet all the way, and not something I'd want often, but tasty. I thought both the maple syrup and pecans were well represented and authentic without being too over the top."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A good take on the Porter style. Nicely dark and creamy with a nice twist from the maple syrup and pecan."
""
""
"0) Overall a decent porter. I just wish that it would have bolder flavors that advertised in the name - ""maple"" and ""pecan""."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall this was pretty good, however It didn't meet my expectations for uniqueness, I thought the pecan was not really present but regardless this was not too bad. Would never turn one of these down and would have another one for sure. Worth a try for everyone."
"O- Not half bad. I especially dig the aroma."
""
"Overall: I was really hopeing this beer would be better, but I am a little disappointed at Sam Adams for a lack of flavor. I will probably not buy this one again."
"Very tasty. Meets my criterion that if you are going to brew a flavored porter, you need a good porter to start with. The additional flavors are flawlessly integrated."
"I would definitely drink this beer if I bought the sampler pack again but don't think I could have more than two due to the mixture of flavors."
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, ruby-brown coloring with a thin, filmy, surface coating of off-white head. Aromas of rich roast and subtle smoke, maple sweetness, and a coffee backbone. Flavors are roast initially, with a sweet blend of maple cream and nutty rich following. A subtle mocha backbone adds to the sweetness, but also provides enough of a bitterness to keep the beer balanced. Smooth in mouth, the dryness of the coffee combats any cloying characteristics. Roasty, sweet aftertaste with a smooth, clean finish. This is a well put together Porter, with a good combination of sweet characteristics that work well within the style."
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: This one really needs to warm up quite a bit before drinking, but the carbonation still gets in the way of this beer. It prevents you from really savoring the flavors of what should be a really good dessert beer. I think I would probably try it again if offered on tap to see if the mouthfeel gets better and in turn, the beer improves."
"Final Thoughts: Two years ago I would have thought Maple Pecan Porter was the bee's knees, but since then my palate has been exposed to a plethora of imperial beers that have matured it very quickly. However, I think Samuel Adams has the right idea here making a very approachable and unique beer for new comers to the craft world. Although Maple Pecan Porter may be semi-bland to some of us, it is still a deserving beer of any craft-lovers glass. Would I drink it again? Yes."
""
""

"12oz bottle, best by July of this year. Body is deep chestnut with a beige head. Sweet aroma of toasted pecans and maple with some dark malts and chocolate. Tastes are also sweet with plenty of toasted pecan and maple syrup balanced with chocolate and coffee notes as the bottle indicates. Thin-to-medium body with moderate carbonation. Overall, I like it for what it is, but it's a one & done for me - I couldn't drink another one of these right now."
""
""
"One of my favorite Sam Adams beers. Very pleasant taste and feel. Drinks extremely easily. Only wish it had more alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, SA Maple Pecan Porter is a deep mahogany in color with a monsterously frothy off-white head. The nose is definitely malty sweet - maple, caramel, brown sugar, chocolate and toffee. The taste reflects the porter nature of the beer; light, sweeter notes are complimented by darker, drying notes of burnt chocolate and coffee. Mouthfeel is light to medium in body with a whip-cream like head and less than active carbonation. Overall, not a bad beer but not SA's most impressive either."
""
"O - I like this beer for its uniqueness, and true-to-name flavor. A lot of times you buy a beer that is called something it is everything but. In this case, you get what you ask for."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall, I enjoyed this beer more than I thought I would. The flavors really go well together. However, the sweetness limits the drinkability for this beer. It is not something that I would want to drink more than one bottle of in a single sitting."
""
""
"I was the most excited about this of any beers in the spring mix. I wanted it to be better, because I just love maple, but it fell short of lofty expectations. pour is nice, medium density brown with a red glow when held to the light, and two inches of khaki head. the nose is really sweet, like breakfast syrup. the nutty vibe is amazingly fresh, roasty, and rich. unfortunately, the maple syrup taste like the artificial crap, not the lovely nectar the region is known for. its too sweet, brutally thick, and just not as pure is it probably should be. again, the pecan component is very well done, and is the saving grace of this porter. the feel would be great without all the residual sugar because the body is nice and full and the carbonation is pleasantly bright. I wish they would give this one a do over. too sugary to drink more than one of, and while I didn't dislike it altogether, the maple syrup part just didn't work out."
"Mouthfeel: This is a medium bodied beer that is tasty yet easy to drink this could be the best Sam Adams that I have ever had, way to go Jim Koch."
""
""
"Overall, possibly a good dessert beer, or with cheese. But rather thick."
"I'm usually not into super sweet beers, but I tried to be as objective as possible with this beer. It starts out quite nice, but falls apart into cloying sweetness toward the end. Overall, however, a solid beer and very enjoyable with brownies. :)"
""
""
""
"Overall: good, but sweet. If you are in the mood for a sweet dessert beer, this could be for you. The sweetness isn't cloying or sickly or anything like that, but it is just a bit more than I'm looking for in a porter."
""
""
"12oz bottle with a Best Before Date notched at July. Pours a dark mahogany color with almost no head. Virtually no lacing. The aroma is nutty with sweet caramel, malts and earth. The taste is nutty with maple syrup up front followed by malts and earth. Almost cloyingly sweet, but its not too surprising given the maple syrup. Bit of a hazelnut taste at the end. Sweet maple syrup flavor throughout. Light mouthfeel . Pretty thin for a porter. Overall, nothing special but not a bad beer."

"O – Not bad. An interesting idea. It is a little light, and has a lingering but not unpleasant sweet aftertaste. Glad I got to try it, but I won't seek it out in the future."
""
"This is quite a novelty but I can't see drinking it again. From the Spring mixed twelve pack purchased at Albertson's supermarket in San Diego. So that means I do have one more to drink."
"Cheers to Sam Adams on another great idea !"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Pretty good start to the mix pack, it's a solid sweet dark beer. Looking forward to the next one: IPL"
""
""
""
"Pouts black with hints of brown. Some foam on top but mostly gone. Nutty nose that really grabs the pecans. Like crackerjacks. Taste opens syrup sweet with some nutty malt mixed in. Little over sweet. Faint hop close. Not much like a porter. Just ok."
"This is a lighter bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. The alcohol is hidden quite well but I gotta admit that the flavor profile here is a bit of a train wreck. For something described as a pecan maple porter, I didnt get much pecan or maple flavor and this was more like root beer or birch beer than a porter. It lacked any significant amount of grain quality and seemed to be just too artificial tasting. Not a fan of this one."
""
""
""
""

"Sammy A has another good one in the maple pecan porter is a decent beer and I'm glad to have a chance to try it. The beer pours a near opaque ruby tinted deep deep amber. The beer is lacing quite nicely with a creamy slight off white head. The scent was the weakest of this beer...I wanted more...hints of sweetness and malt. The taste was pushed by sweetness the pecan was a bit slighted. The mouthfeel was light to medium body with smooth carbonation. Overall a taste ey to drink porter...nice job!"
"O - As far as what it is trying to be I think it works. Slightly oversweet and the maple overpowers the other flavors a bit, making it feel almost one-dimensional. Still an enjoyable beer, though. Kind of surprised it is in the spring selection because it tastes and feels like something I would want after an autumn hike or in front of an early winter fire."
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: A novel idea that doesn't quite work as well as it could. Still a decent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - The pecan and maple are both readily evident and while I enjoy the maple character quite a bit it is really overly sweet and one dimensional in the end."
""
""
""
"Decent beer for the price. I'd drink more of it, but not something I'd regularly seek out."
"O: This was a decent offering for a specialty porter."
""
""
""
"The feel of this beer is has a bit of smooth feel and a nice body to this beer. Not heavy but a bit bigger then the typical medium beer there is some great interesting things about this beer that makes it a great beer."
"I'm thinking this brewery really knows how to make a porter, but the only two I recall having are in variety packs (this, and the one for Christmas time - which is a great one)."
""
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours dark brown with foamy beige head. Aroma is of bready, nutty malt, hints of hops and dark fruit. Body is full and smooth. Taste is toasted, nutty malt, maple syrup, chocolate, hints of earthy hops and dark fruit. Finish is medium, coffeeish. On a sweet side, but should be good with right food."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Samuel Adams perfect pint glass. Pours a clear darker shade of copper with a thick, light tan head that dissipates slowly. Some lacing retreats down the side of the glass with the head. The are aromas of bready malts and very nutty from the pecans. The pecan smell is more intense here than in some other pecan ales I've sampled in the past. There are also hints of coffee and maple in the nose. Like in the nose, the flavor is very pecan forward and the malts are bready. There are those hints of coffee and maple as well, though these are not strong hints. The pecan is the star of the show here. The body is medium with light carbonation. This beer drinks very well and the finish is only slightly dry. This is an excellent beer. Samuel Adams has come out swinging with this one and hit a home run."
""
""
"Overall: I had prepped myself for what was to be a flavored porter, though, I had hoped for something just a bit more restrained, if you will. Sure, it is better than those flavored Saranac porters, though!"
""
"O - A very great offering from BBC/SA. This is not a beer you would want more than one of though, and I'd really like to have one of these with breakfast one of these days. Affordable, and solid. Definitely worth the try."
""
""
"Aroma like a sweet stout, but bready. Poured a clear ruddy brown with off white head. Head lasts under a minute with spotty lacing of glass. Taste is sour, biting. Burnt pancakes! No pecan hint at all unless they used burnt nutshells! Was it maple syrup or the bark of the tree they used? Another drainpour for me!"
"I enjoyed this, I bet it would go great with a doughnut or some bacon. A touch more body would help this immensely. I would buy this as a stand alone sixer"
"O- Best one of the pack, in my opinion. Easy drinking, decent beer."
"O - Good beer but nothing special. Too light for a porter in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured this WONDERFUL beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was dark dark amber color. The head poured tan and creamy piling up way above the rim of the tumbler. The smell was luscious with maple oozing out of the glass. Taste was everything I hoped for. Rich, a little sweet and with a fantastic maply pecanny finish that I really liked. Wish I could get this in a 6 pack instead of that mixed 12. I will buy again if I can ever find it by itself."
""
""
"O: A successful gimmick beer - this is a showcase for the maple syrup and pecan qualities, nothing more, nothing less. A bit too sweet for my tastes, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy this."

"O- A pleasant experience overall, provided one doesn't mind a thinner porter, but this brew is definitely one that will be returning to my 'fridge rather frequently."
"O/D-Too bad for that metallic/tinny flavor. Its pretty cool and I respect how both the syrup and the nut are on display here. I'm not struggling to find the two flavors that are present in the beer's name."

"Great dark crimson / purple appearance with awesome head. Roasted coffee, nutty, maple syrup aroma. Smells great. Smoky, chocolatey taste. Not as sweet as you would expect. You can definitely taste the maple and pecan. We wish the amounts were reversed with more maple and pecan and less smoke and chocolate. Smokey chocolate porters are a dime a dozen. This almost becomes something unique but falls short. Despite that, it is still enjoyable. Little bit of a burnt taste. Overall, better marketed than it tastes"
""
"Mouthfeel is pretty good, slightly thinner than I'd normally want in a porter. As thin at it is, it's still smooth. Lacks a the complexity to push it over the top to be great. Pretty drinkable though, I'm digging it. A good porter, could be great if it had just a little more."
"Overall- A little too much sweetness and not quite enough roastiness in a porter for me. Not really my fave of the Sams."
""
"Overall: Little sweet for a porter but nice finish. I can tell you this after dinner this brew is a maybe but to have it with dessert probably the best idea. Salud!"
"O - A worthy try, but ultimately a little gimmicky. Not a great porter by any means."

"Publix Supermarket - University Palms - 12 oz bottle - part of their ’Spring Thaw’ Variety Pak. Deep, dark brown pour, initially frothy khaki colored head that leaves plenty of lacing. Aroma has a brown sugar and maple syrup/butterscotch quality. Flavor is very pleasant. Nice maple accents, not cloyingly sweet, hints of baker’s unsweetened chocolate and the finish has an mild old-silverware tang. Medium texture, with a slightly thicker mouthfeel. I like this one very much."

"Really an interesting and unique flavor profile here, and as I am a particularly big fan of maple, this is easily one I'd purchase again, given the chance."
"Overall - Out of the Spring mix pack, I was most excited to try this one. Unfortunately I came away disappointed. Too much maple sweetness, not enough pecan and/or porter qualities. Drinks much closer to an oversweetened brown than it does a porter. Fair brew, and to Sam Adams credit they nail the bottle's description with decent accuracy, but they fail in describing just how cloying it becomes; it's just too rich to enjoy more than half the beer."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, best before July 2013. This pours a mostly clear dark mahogany brown with a mid sized tan head with decent retention. The smells are quit nice, a load of sweet maple along with some pecan, roasted nuts, and toffee, seems like a fine dessert beer. The feel is medium. The taste is quite good, the maple gives this a slightly smoky flavor along with the nuttiness. Quite a tasty treat from SA."

"O: Overall I thought the beer was nice...for a porter. I got some maple but I felt it was buried behind the roasted flavors. I didn't get pecan at all. I felt robbed in these respects. It's not a bad beer by any scale, but it just didn't seem to work. I would enjoy drinking it as a porter, but I probably won't be buying it again. I can get nearly the same experience with any run-of-the-mill porter out there."

"Pours a dark brown with a foamy off white head. Smell is sweet, maple sugar, pecans surprisingly, and some malt. Taste starts sweet with maple sugar up front, pecan comes in and finishes smooth and malt. The pecan is strong in aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel, could be heavier, more of a nut brown feel. Overall sweet, interesting flavor, worth checking out, not your typical porter."

"This was a nice addition to the spring mix-pack. It has a really solid flavor profile. It's rich, complex, deep, delicious. Not only is this incredibly flavorful, but it has great drinkability as well. I probably won't buy the mix-pack again, but I certainly wouldn't turn this down. I truly enjoyed it."
""
""
""
"It pours a very dark thick brown color with a tight creamy head good retention. I don't get a whole lot from the smell but it is ok. The taste is very maple and very pecan I feel like there may be a little vanilla in there as well. The body is slightly better than average with good carbonation. I like this beer but I am not in love with it. I would like to try this on draft."
""
""
"This porter was ok. Nothing to spectacular. It would probably be good with a burger or some sort of comfort dish like potato soup or chicken pot-pie."
""
""
""
"Would not have given this beer the title of a porter if I was going off appearances alone cuz it's wildly reddish with lots of clarity. Other than that, it's solid."
""

"If this beer was a tiny bit less sweet, it would be one of the better Sam Adams offerings. It even feels sweet somehow. I didn't let that ruin it for me but it brought it down from what this Porter could have been. I did like how the pecan and maple flavors weren't overly artificial feeling."

"Samuel Adams Maple Pecan Porter ---3.5/5"
"RJT"
""
"O- A solid porter in my opinion. Sam Adams so widely available and hard to beat for the price. I picked up a variety 12 pack for 12.99 and have enjoyed everything in it so far."
""
""
""
"O- it's not bad, but re-enforces the issue that you need to be careful when screwing with maple because it can get out of control in a hurry"
""
"On the lighter end of medium bodied with a combination of dry roast, sweet malt and pecan notes. Again, I'm only picking up the faintest bit of maple but the pecan stands out a lot more than in the nose, especially in the finish. Slightly smokey and acrid up front with some toast, burnt malt, coffee bean and oatmeal but this is balanced by sweeter notes of caramel, toffee, hazelnut and some biscuit. The roasted pecan flavor lingers long in the finish giving an otherwise mediocre beer another layer of flavor."
""
""
""
"i tried this pecan maple porter at a beer fest like 2 years ago, and i liked it a lot then. i was pleased to see it pop up in this sam adams variety pack i just bought. it pours a deep crimson-black. the smell is a little smokey and earthy. the taste in the bottle isnt what i remember from the beer fest. it is a little weak, has a little watery finish. i wish this beer was as rich as i remember. i like my darker beers a little more flavorful, although this beer isnt bad- i just wish it was richer."
""
""
""
"This is a geek murky beer. The carbonation is a bit on the high side. Just a touch of maple in the nose. Not a particularly sweet beer. Some maple and pecan. Roasted malt bitterness need balanced. Good retention. This isn't something I need to revisit."
""
""
"O: I'm glad that I only got two of these, and that someone drank the other one. It's good, but just too much. Too sweet, too many competing flavors. It's a good concept, but I think it's just rather poorly executed."
""
""
""
""
""
"A very likable beer. The main reason that I bought the Spring Thaw case, and the quality is redeeming. This was my last one. Time to plow through some Alpine Spring and Boston Lager."
""
"O-Interesting enough...all the flavors just don't seem to come together as nicely as I had hoped but it has some interesting dimensions to it."
""
"If it were not for this faint but there smell and taste this would have been a real winner. With these issues it is knocked down to okay plus."

"Light roasted malt up front. Nutty, pecan-ish flavors come on as the malt transitions to sweet and maple-y. Milk chocolate and licorice show up. The maple sweetness is dominant, but not overbearing. Pecan nuttiness and a some woody bitterness into the finish. Lingering sweetish roasted malt and vanilla. Medium bodied, with a nice, creamy feel. This beer is what is says it is, that is for sure! If you like strong maple and pecan flavors, this beer is for you."
"This surprised me. Their variety stuff is always hit and miss with me and I didn't have a good feeling about this one but it's quite good. Pretty well balanced also."
""
"O - It's definitely on the sweet side, but a very nice porter."
"O: This porter has some really nice flavors going on. The maple syrup goes well with the malts and the pecans add an added dimension. Throw in the usual chocolate and coffee notes of a porter, and this is one solid brew. Easy to drink, and not too overboard. Solid"
""
"Overall it's good, but gimmicky. Sam Adams best beers tend to be more simplistic and straightforward. A good sampler pack selection tho."
""
"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and an ok example of the style. the maple syrup and pecan are really nice but the Porter base is lacking a little and I wish it had more roasted flavors and aromas to it, so it isn't the greatest example of an American Porter, but other then that it's fairly true to it's name. This beer had good drinkability, it was pretty smooth, with some nice flavors to hold my attention, I could drink two or three of these but I think after that the sweetness would become too much. What I liked the most about this beer was the taste, the maple syrup and pecans showed up very nicely and they were the highlight of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it wasn't bad, but there was too much carbonation for the style and it got to be a little prickly. I would buy this beer on it's own, I don't think I would buy a lot of it, but it would be nice to keep in the fridge during the colder months, and I recommend this beer to just about anyone, unless you have a nut allergy. All in All I enjoyed this beer, I thought the American Porter base could be improved on some, but the maple syrup and pecans seemed to carry this beer and made it pretty enjoyable. Good job Samuel Adams, this is one solid beer and it's my favorite in the Spring Thaw pack, I like the concept of this beer and I think with a stronger Porter base this could be a really good beer, thanks for another enjoyable beer."
"Pleasantly surprised by this one. I admit I was afraid this would be a little one-dimensional and overly-sweet, but was surprised by something that is sufficiently complex and balanced. This actually tastes quite familiar to me...porter is always a holiday mainstay for me, as are Swedish nuts. Sam Adams basically took both of my favorite winter flavors and conveniently combined them for me. My only gripe is that this really feels like a Winter beer and would have been well-placed in that mix pack. It strikes me as a little bold and heavy for Spring...but then again, with several months until anything resembling Spring here in New England, I've got plenty of cold weather left to enjoy this one!"
""

""
""
"Overall: Not impressed with this offering. It's not Cranberry lambic bad, but I can't think of another Sam Adams beer that this beats out. Maybe it is on par with the winter lager but.... eh."
""
"Flavors here are as advertised, if you are a fan of maple and pecan then this would be a good beer for you. For me it was a bit too sweet. Tough to finish a whole beer."
""
""
""
"O - This is a nice flavored porter. In general, I don't like pecans but it was good in this beer."
"B-"
""
""
"Interesting combination. This beer is dark, brown, and is capped with a tan head. Delicate lace. The smell is interesting and assertive: lots of pecan, backed by maple...like a maple sugar cookie with pecans. The taste is sweet and just a bit smokey. Sugar...lots of sugar. It boarders on being too sweet. The beer is balanced with a nice roast and slight bitterness. Full body. Interesting, but not as appealing as I trout it could be."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not as good as I had anticipated but overall not bad. Isnt something I would seek out again and not really the highlight of the mix pack. Reminds me of their hazelnut brown ale."
""
""
""
"Pours a pitch black color with a thick, very creamy, tan colored head. Excellent retention and lacing. Smell is of dark roasted malt, coffee, and maple. Taste is similar, there is lots of dark roasted caramel notes up front with a coffee like bitterness. This fades to a mild sweetness of maple syrup, and finishes with a nice clean and crisp taste. Medium carbonation, full body. This beer is pretty easy to drink, however its slightly off balanced towards the sweet side. A little too much syrup flavor for my tastes I think. Also the mouthfeel is slightly oily from the pecans I would imagine. Overall a decent beer to try, definitely better than most."

"Well, it pours a dark brown/red with a nice tan head with very nice lacing. To me it smells a little bit like teryaki Sauce. Looking past that it does carry aromas of chocolate. There is also a bit of maple, but I detect no pecan. The taste is chocolatey with some coffee, but the finish shows signs of maple syrup and pecan with a bit of wood. The hops are almost undetectable. It is a bit overly carbonated for this style of beer, but the mouthfeel definately gained some body from the addition of the maple syrup. Its good, but not great."
""
""
""
"I bet this recipe could be replicated with VT maple syrup and a solid malt base. It's just too thin."
""
""
""
""
"Quite impressed with this beer. You can really pick up the maple and pecan flavors but its done in balance. You can either drink a few of these or use it as a dessert type of beer. Good job."
""
""
""
"A nice change of pace. Certainly good and I’d definitely have it again."
"Maple Pecan Porter pours a black color, with a very small lacing head. There is a strong smokey pecan aroma. The taste is on the sweeter side, strong maple flavors, with hints of a nutty pecan, on a smokey malty backbone. Good full flavor and easy to drink. Overall a very good blend of different flavors."
""
"OVERALL: This beer is on the sweet side, but it tastes very good. Maple, nuts and roast is just a winning combination. Re-released in the holiday mix pack, this beer is easily the standout from that assortment, which also included a hoppy lager and new Belgian white."
"Poured into a pint glass. Appearance is very dark with a mocha head. Malty, sweet smell. Very Nice lacing. Just like the smell this is a very sweet beer. Taste like pecan pie in beer form. Has a thick mouthfeel. Overall a beer I wouldn't mind trying again but not something I would look for again."
"12oz bottle purchased as part of this year's Spring mix pack. Pours a black body with ruby red highlights and nearly an inch of light tan head. Dark chocolate and espresso notes comprise the aroma. Flavor reminds me of dark chocolate covered espresso bean, with caramel and nut notes. Medium in body and carbonation. Not bad, albeit a bit on the sweet side to my taste."
""
"I'm a big fan of this beer and would love to see it hit their normal lineup. Not sure if it's going to be a seasonal or rotator."
