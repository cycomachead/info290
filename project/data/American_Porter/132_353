4.43,14.8,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"12 oz bottle from BevMo. Dark brown with a small light tan head. Aroma of chocolate, toasted malts, a bit of caramel and coffee. Taste is bittersweet chocolate, toasted caramel and coffee grounds. Backed by a resiny hoppiness that comes through as slightly acidic. Medium bodied with a light texture, dry finish and slightly higher than average carbonation. Could have easily been richer but they kept it drinkable. Love the low ABV.","loubar","Mar 23, 2015"

3.71,-3.9,4,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Brew pours a very deep mahogany with some ruby-highlights. A good 3-finger foamy beige head is seen after the pour that lasts a good while before settling down to around 3-5mm. A decent amount of lacing is seen when sipped that sticks to the inside of the glass. The aroma is of roasted malts for the most part with a light hint of coffee I believe. More going on with the taste but the mocha is very light actually as I was expecting more of that flavor. Does have a light hint of nuts along with the coffee. The finish is slightly bitter and hangs around for a bit. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation. Overall it isn't a bad Porter as I had better for a cheaper price though. Had better though.","BeerWithMike","Feb 20, 2015"

The look and smell are great but there is something really offputting about the second wave of tangy, sour flavor once I waded through the initial coffee and chocolate notes.  Not sure if it's just the batch I got or whether that was part of the plan.  I'll manage through the six pack I picked up but there are a lot of coffee or chocolate porters I prefer to this one, generally something a little sweeter.","Aleks_P","Jan 02, 2015"

Pours moderately hazy very dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger fairly dense and rocky tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big chocolate, cocoa, caramel, coffee, toast, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt with light hop presence; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, herbal, light pine, light nuttiness, and roasted earthiness. Light earthy pine/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, herbal, light pine, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice flavor balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and moderate hop flavors; with solid robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good porter. Good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and moderate hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 07, 2014"

Also taste all that was in the nose. Mouthfeel is nice with lots of carbonation for this low ABV Porter. Overall this isn't a bad beer but it really isn't anything I would go after again.

It pours a little thinner than most porters with a nice mahogany color. Nice head retention and the carbonation looks right for the style. Mmmm, that's nice. The first wave is the coffee and mocha rush followed by a smooth almost toasted caramel/oats finish. I would almost swear this was made with oats and coffee. The mouthfeel is right on as well. Overall, totally worth the wait, and the money. I really think this is one of the best self-proclaimed coffee porters i've had in ages.

They just seem to throw a bunch of ingredients together and hope for the best, and not only that but a hodgepodge of different things to try that shouldn't be like that. This is a mocha porter, it should have more chocolate, more coffee, no burnt or acrid flavors, no smoke (although a little would be OK if it blended well which this doesn't), too many sharp not so great flavors that don't blend well, eh.","jlindros","Mar 09, 2013"

There was also something fruity, a dark fruit in the aroma but I couldn't put my finger on what exactly it was. The taste was sweet with malt up front giving way to a strong coffee bitterness that lingers for quite a while. I really liked this beer!","clemtiger8202","Sep 13, 2012"

Aroma of coffee and dark malt, light hops. All the porter flavors are there; dark malts, very light smoky malts, a bit of coffee. Nothing stands out. No off notes, but kinda boring.","LiquidAmber","Aug 03, 2012"

Quite bitter with tons of roasted malt and coffee ground flavors. Some bitter dark chocolate, a bit of earthiness, maybe some slight malty sweetness. Meh.","womencantsail","Jul 30, 2012"

It's a little creamier than some other popular porters, which is something else I appreciate. Last time I visited the Rogue alehouse I had the Hazelnut Brown and followed it up with this - tasted exactly like a chilled hazelnut coffee. Lovely!","TheRealBigC","Jul 28, 2012"

While the flavor profile contains many elements of a typical coffee porter--roasted dark malts, coffee, cocoa--there was a definite herbal presence throughout, very reminiscent of a black tea, presumably from the hops used. This gave a dry and somewhat bitter finish. Medium body, nice balance, not too coffee-y, and pretty drinkable overall.","Rifugium","Jan 10, 2012"

A dark creamy head of froth sits on top that dissipates some, still leaving a pretty decent layer of head as the beer goes down. Sticky lacing. The beer smells of bitter chocolate and roasted malts. The taste of burnt malts and a bitter cocoa taste is present. Also a biter hop presence to finish. The mouthfeel is just abut right for a porter. Overall this beer doesn't stand out as exceptional, yet at the same time it's not overpowering from Rogue, which makes me like it.

The taste is good as porters go, but we feel it falls short of the other great porters out there. Overall if you like strong coffee in your beer you will like this beer.

There is a light coffee bitterness on the front of the palate followed by some faint chocolate taste that accentuates the coffee, not sweetening it. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean, dry in the end, but a nice pleasant coffee bitterness in the aftertaste.

Similar to other observations, I noticed a distinct metallic/musty smell. Pretty thin mouthfeel. The rich, malty, toasted barley flavor was the high point but it didn't last long and was eventually overtaken by the bitter coffee/mocha flavor. The coffee/mocha flavor made for an interesting taste during the first few sips but eventually it was all I noticed and boy did it linger: I still taste it now. I didn't note what I consider hops balancing out the beer but I am fairly new to analyzing complex tastes and don't quite notice all the subtleties yet. It might be well paired with a red meat as it is not too filling and bitter but I don't think I would have a craving for this like some other porters.

Mouthfeel is a bit thin and watery, seems a little one-dimensional with just a bit of dark malt really showing anything worthwhile. I am glad I finally found this as a single, I have been avoiding a full sixer for years due to the absurd price and my lack of love for the house Pacman yeast.

3.64,-5.7,3,4,3.5,3,4,"Poured a medium-amber, hues of dark buckwheat honey, white head that faded quickly without a trace. I thought they had mistaken this for the Rogue Amber, which was on tap also, but a quick waft told me this was indeed the Mocha Porter. A light hazelnut/toasted almond aroma blended with less than assertive coffee beans and an almost bock-like malt character in the background. Faint earthiness as well. The mainstay of the flavor department is a nutty cocoa flavor than seems rather muted, giving more of the stage to the light brown sugar and caramel backbone. The coffee flavor just dies. Not really what I wanted from this. The body is rather thin for a porter. I feel like a porter should have a fairly robust body (ie Flagship Porter or Fuller's) but this is pretty weak. However, it makes for a highly drinkable beer. It's not bland, nor is it thick and settling in the stomach, which makes for good, easy drinking. I would love this beer with a Garbage Plate.","DmanGTR","Feb 19, 2011"
3.68,-4.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Rocky froth of tan head over dark, cloudy brown beer. Body is cloudy with interesting swirls. Not sure where those come from, but it's fun! Aromas are acidic, milk chocolate, and mild breadiness. Flavors follow with bittersweet chocolate, dry roasted coffee, floral acidity. A bit cloying, but not so much that the beer is ruined. Medium mouth and the carbonation feels just right. Smooth and easily palatable. The bomber didn't last too long!","washburnkid","Feb 19, 2011"
4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Well the mouthfeel is watery and overall it is a bitter dry beer. At first, the flavors of mocha, burnt coffee and chocolate comes in and tickles your palate then it goes away rapidly.

4.42,14.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours inky black, all but opaque. Moderate tan head with creamy, fine bead, moderately good retention, and some lacing. Smells like roasted malt, with notes of coffee, chocolate, and dark bread crusts. Very slight hint of chocolate. Perfect for the style-quite roasty, but doesn't cross over into burnt malt flavors. Up front, the roast is very coffee like, though on the back end, a pleasant chocolate note shows through. The flavor and aroma are quite good on this one, but it's the mouthfeel that makes this so damn drinkable. Silky smooth on the palate-it's the kind of beer that leaves you excited for the next sip.","SFrankBrew","Feb 17, 2011"
3.54,-8.3,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a lovely dark, dark brown, with a foamy, airy, light tan head on it of about an inch and a half. Very faint aromas of coffee and milk chocolate. On the initial sip, the beer is dry, with roasted coffee flavors, and a malt background that remains just present enough to balance the bitter flavors. In mouth, as said before, the beer is dry. Very crisp and light, which is surprising for a Porter. The aftertaste is all bitter coffee, and the finish is quick, with the slightest coffee linger on the mid-tongue. Pretty sessionable beer at the low ABV, but personally, I look for a little more body and a little more booze in my Porters. Decent beer, nonetheless.","GarthDanielson","Feb 16, 2011"

A creamy, dark tan head slowly faded away, leaving some thick lacing around the glass. The aroma was made up of dark chocolate, roasted malts, some light vanilla, and also some freshly ground coffee notes. The flavor included notes of mocha cappucino, light roasted malts, milk chocolate, followed up by a quick, hoppy finish. The mouthfeel was light to medium-bodied with a decent amount of carbonation.

From opening this bottle i cought whiffs of chocolate milk and toffee. Once poured the coffee and dark chocolate seem more apparent. Taste is good, malty and semi sweet with toffee and coffee notes. Doesnt sit on the palate too long which could be good or bad depending on personal style preference. Doesnt leave a bad after taste or linger on flavor, a decent trade off i suppose.

The beer produces a huge tan head that slowly goes away, but never really quits. It's a really good looking porter, really does this glass justice. The smell is very good, and probably could be great if it didn't have such an interesting mix and so much going on. It's the hops that actually stand out the most, but at the same time it's pretty malty. It almost smells like I would say coco more than mocha and even a bit of a coffee aroma to it as well. The taste is quite good, but a bit more bitter than I expected. It has more of a chocolaty (mocha) flavor than they aroma. Again, it has a big malty taste to it as well with dark coffee. The coffee flavor could also be espresso pairing with the hops, that would explain the bitterness which ends with a bit of an earthy taste. I think that some of the ingredients could have been measured a little different and the flavor would be outstanding, but it's still very good. The mouthfeel is good, as stated earlier just the slightest bit more bitter than I would have liked. Less bitter in the beginning when it was a bit colder, finishes dry and pretty full bodied. This is one extremely drinkable beer. Any beer drinker should be able to finish a 22oz bottle without problem.","AndyAvalanche","Feb 22, 2010"

Pours a very dark brown, almost black color with a two and a half finger head that looks pretty creamy on top but very bubbly around the sides. The head is a nice tan color and has better retention than most other beer. It leaves medium lacing around random spots of the glass. Smell has a lot of roasted coffee and malts in it but overall is kind of weak. Some chocolate is found also. Taste is big on the same things as smell. Lots of roasted malts, coffee and chocolate, although not as much as an RIS. It is a nice lighter version of these flavors and much easier to drink. This beer definitely has the same cocoa flavor of the chocolate stout but not as big. All of the Rogue beers have a similar key flavor to them but I can't describe it, I just feel it once it hits the tongue. The beer tastes a bit watery at times but not overly. The mouthfeel is good on this beer as well. There is definitely some creaminess to it along with a good amount of carbonation. A nice roasty flavor is left on the tongue well after I take my sip. The body is medium but on the watery side of that, it's just hard for me to like coffee/chocolate beers with any watery feel to them. No warming at all hear to speak of. Drinkability is good, the beer tastes good, the price was not bad at all, there really are no off flavors or alcohol so this one could definitely be sessioned reasonably.","cbutova","Nov 11, 2009"

Very dry, but at the same time not roasty. Not much malt sweetness, just dry. A lot more hop bite than I would expect, too. Another user compared this to Guinness. It's not creamy like you'd expect Guinness canned to be, yet it also lacks the punch of Guinness Extra Stout. It's not terrible, definitely not offensive. But from Rogue, I would expect a lot more.

Low carbonation when you look at it, but it is quite noticable in the mouth, so I guess there is quite a bit of carbonation hidden by the dark color. Roasted malt on the nose.

The light body, again, does not make this feel light a porter but instead more of a dark brown ale. I think the fact that this beer is dubbed a "Mocha" porter makes it even more disappointing due to the lack of chocolate flavors and aromas. I think this beer would pair nicely with spicy foods, but would not choose it as a stand alone beer to drink. Even with the food pairing at nearly $10.00 a six pack I would spend my money on other porters in the future.","Jekster","Feb 09, 2009"

Light to medium-bodied, curiously bitter attack with the hops front and center. The dryness impedes the spreading wide of chocolate powder and roasted coffee bean flavors.

The coffee and chocolate flavors were very faint in this pour -- I swear I remember them being more powerful the times I've had it from a bottle. The overall aroma and taste is still roasted-coffee-chocolate-esque, but this time it was more of a generic roasted maltiness, and I remember the chocolate standing out more in the past. Still a very good porter overall. The color is a very (very) dark brown only if held up to light -- appears nearly solid black otherwise, with about a 1/2" very light tan head.

You can really smell cocoa in the nose, though the coffee half of the mocha equation is far more muted; it's more a roasty aroma than anything resembling Starbucks. There's little else aside from a very slight sourness. The flavor switches the equation initially, producing a solid medium-roast coffee flavor and roasted barley to go with a complementary cocoalike second banana.Incidentally, the high hopping rate seems to do little until the finish. Apparently the beer is weighted heavily toward bittering hops (little aroma or flavor hops), as the sides of the mouth seem to be abuzz with this roughness without contributing much resiny flavor. The hops are surprisingly muted by the bitterness of the dark grains until the finish, where the hops finally come through and wind up dominating the finish.","Rootdog316","Mar 02, 2008"

Got better as it warmed, and towards the end of the beer. This is a decent porter. Not one I'd crave again, but it's certainly not bad if you like porters.

Finish is a nice combination of hop, and roasted coffee flavors. Somewhat sticky mouthfeel, but not unpleasant at all.

Before the finish it is actually quite IPA like with the citrus/pine hop flavor. I think they should have just left the mocha outa this one, the hops are quite pleasant. The mouthfeel is a full-medium body with a creamy/foamy carbonation and a dry finish from the coffee.

You got the classic porter flavor, very tasty but the coffee flavor of this brew really stands out. It's almost like they brewed a fantastic porter and flavored it with coffee.

I was expecting a little more sweetness, but this isn't bad at all. Definitely one to sit back and enjoy. Nothing spectacular, but still a very solid porter.

The smells of oak-like chocolate flavors were very unique to me especially by the balance of the sweetness and woody textures. However, the taste was radically not that mocha-like, but it was still quite good with subtle balances of bitter and sweet flavors. Its high carbonation made it really drinkable.

Smells sweet and chocolately, not at all offensive. Taste is good also, somewhat dark and burnt tasting, very sweet as well. For a porter, very drinkable and smooth.

3.23,-16.3,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"It poured pitch black with about a two finger head that quickly dissipated to about a quarter-finger head. The smell is very characteristic of a porter with undertones of burnt coffee. The taste didn't really floor me, and the somewhat pleasant and almost sweet taste of the beer gives away to an aftertaste that was a little too bitter for my liking at first that seemed to become less bitter as the beer warmed. Overall, I ended up enjoying it quite a bit more than I thought I would when I took the first sip. I can see what some people like about this beer, but to me as a fairly new beer drinker it didn't seem to have the depth that something like Gonzo Imperial Porter or Southern Tier Porter. I couldn't imagine myself drinking more than one of these at a time, as it seems to sit a little heavy in me. I'd say it's a fairly respectable porter that I was able to find at a fairly cheap price of about $1.75 a bottle. Decent beer aside, I can't imagine picking it up again unless I'm short on money and really want myself a porter.","TheTrevor","Oct 13, 2007"

The head subsided to a thin pad, leaving splotchy lacing about the glass. I was hoping for a bit more head retention...The initial aroma of the beer is hoppy - a mostly piney scent with subtle citrus tones. The spiceyness of the hops does not linger, however. The aroma is also rich with roasted malt and chocolate notes. Roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate dominates the flavor, but there is also a hint of coffee. Burnt notes are also intermingled. The hops do not come through in the flavor quite as much as in the aroma, although the flavor is still pleasantly bitter and finishes dry and clean. Overall, the flavor profile is quite balanced. Solid medium-full bodied beer is almost a bit chewy. Maintained carbonation well but seems almost a bit more effervescent than should be for the style - although it does aid in smoothing out the body and bitterness. All in all, a good porter and worth trying.","crizmo2352","Oct 10, 2007"

This, however, was very, very good! $4 pint at Charlie Mopps on Roswell Rd. Poured absolutely black as ink with dark red edges and khaki coloured head that vanished in 45 seconds or so. Smell was candy sweet with enormous caramel, chocolate, and sweet espresso. Taste was all sweet malts and caramel with a fairly dry roasted cereal finish.

3.56,-7.8,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Gave this brew a try last evening for the first time which is a little surprising to me since Porters are probably my favorite beer type and most of the other Rogue offerings have been very good. The brews pour was very nice, with a color of either dark-dark brown or black as it was not letting much of any light through. It had a nice sized large bubble tan head that had very good retention and left lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is a little different than I was expecting as it did not remind me as much of coffee as I was thinking but more of chocolate, roasted grain scent with hops mixed in. Over all a good smelling brew just not what I was completely expecting. The hop flavor is noticeable very quickly with a break to a roasted to slightly burnt grain taste. The one thing that I notice is a slight acidic feel and I would imagine that would be from the hops and slightly burnt grain flavors mixing together? The finish is a little dry which goes well with this offering. Thinking about it, I wonder if what I was figuring as being bitterness from the hops was more from the malt grain. Either way it is a solid brew from Rogue, probably middle of the road. I would definitely get it again in the future as it is one of my favorite types. It is not as good as the Shakespeare stout and will have to try the Chocolate Stout over the next few weeks to see how it compares; I know the style is different but... Again, a very good brew, interesting flavors with nice character.","Stimack","Apr 16, 2007"

Palate is a bit thin. There is some molasses in there. Finishes smoky, slightly lactic, and with more roasted flavors. The lingering aftertaste is all astringent coffee and Pacman yeast.

This beer is made with a veritable smorgasbord of malts: Northwest Harrington, Klages, Crystal, Beeston Chocolate, Black, Munich, and Carastan malts.

Hints of malted coffee rose to the top after a stir, but otherwise I didn't notice much. Could this have been my fault? Entirely possible, as I hope to give the aroma another shot in the future. Tasted nice. Strong coffee notes with chocolate and some wood. That bitter coffee finish was great, in my opinion. Sturdy mouthfeel and nice drinkability for a "mocha" porter.

Though the first sip (and the sediment of the last gulp) was strong, once my taste buds got acclimated to it it tasted watered down. Not that the flavoring of each wasn't a nice rich dollop from the bucket, it just wasn't nearly strong enough for my liking.

Burnt, chocolatey-coffee (as one might expect) is the big presence here, tending towards a more earthy smell. The taste on the front is very nice. Well balanced, malty, chocolatey, almost like an oatmeal stout. The back is not quite as nice. It tends to be a bit astringent, with a pithy and over-burnt taste overriding. The aftertaste follows this lead. The mouthfeel is good all around, quite smooth and full, except that it leaves a bit of a dry chalky feeling after all is said and done.

Smell is really northwest hoppy and resinous. A narrow aroma profile, not one that invites me to taste and enjoy. Taste is smooth up front, creamy, with a dry roasty, unsweetened chocolate and powdered cocoa flavor making a strong showing, good f lavors here and unique. The hops are certainly there in the finish and intense, but the malt has good character and holds up. Finishes dry. Mouthfeel is tangy carbonation, medium-full in body. On par--not a watery porter. Drinability wise, it's kind of drying, and it has some noticable bitterness, thought it is a great version. The northwestern hops really competed once I started drinking it alongside a burger which is not uncommon for when I'm drinking a good porter. But here, the beers body was overshadowed and now I was tasting just the hops, which competed with the food and was disapointing. Would be better with really spicy meat or bean burritos maybe. So this is a stand alone-drinker due to the excessive love for northwestern hops. Glad I had one.","Liquids","Jul 29, 2006"

I first sighed at the site of the huge head that was forming from a slow, careful pour. But like a small child, it was uncontrollably hyper and then just flat out crashed. No lacing even. Nose is fairly hoppy, though slightly repressed for Rogue. Hops a saving grace for the mouthfeel, lending it a slight crisp, bitter roundness in the mouth. Aroma otherwise relatively flat in contrast to other highly reviewed porters I've recently had. Mouthfeel a little over carbonated in my opinion. Almost, but not quite creamy. Average finish. Flavour becomes more syrupy than anything as it warmed. Taste like some coffee was stirred in there, but doesn't seem to genuinely blend into the beer. You can find some malt in there if you look. Still a nice beer, but fell a little inferior to other big name American porters and not one of my favourite offerings from this great brewer.","biegaman","May 13, 2006"

Easily an inch tall sprawl and with some true grit. Delicate shreds of lace adorn the glass. Prissy looking. The nose is chocolate heavy. Mocha I guess. There is even a little bit of hop sting underneath. Overall, light in olfactory stimulation. The finish is strikingly dry. The taste that comes before it is strikingly weak. Just some slight powdery chocolate followed by this pronounced bitter and dry ending. The coffee aspects only add to the bitterness while contributing little to the flavour. This feels severely unbalanced. Mouthfeel is light. Drinkability suffers due to the lopsided nature of this one. Alright.","SupaCelt","May 13, 2006"

I could certainly make short work of a sixer, too bad I just bought one bottle (which is the only downside to mixing a six-pack in those liquor stores that allow it). However, it does seem possible that as you move through a sixer, it may fill you up just a bit. An excellent beer from Rogue. In comparing it within the style, I liked it a bit more the Stone Smoked Porter and the others that I’ve tried.

3.88,0.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The Rogue has come to Alberta finally, and this Mocha Porter came in the 6-pack. The label is simple and typically ugly/lovely according to your preference. It shows the Rogue gentleman with his fist in the air and a mug of beer in his hand. Right from the get-go I could tell the head was around for a solid and full experience. A dense and light chocolate/red-coloured foam gathers on top of an intensely dark brew, near solid ebony with hints of sapphire edges when held to light. A dark brew, in both liquid and foam. The head became chunky and left viscous lacing that stuck tenaciously. I like what I see so far. A sturdy porter aroma: roasty, a little salty and with plenty of meatiness akin to beef or ham. The difference here between Mocha Porter and some other local styles I have had seems to be the malting: this is less sourish and less smoky. The dark malts hint at more creaminess, more coffee. Very dry with hints of hot dog aroma. Some hopping in the back, barely detectable. Beef, fresh ground coffee, soft black licorice and some charcoal. Very appetising, if not exceptional compared to most porters I have sampled. Solid, not outstanding. The first sip reveals a very firm and dry body, with medium carbonation. The first taste is creamy dark malt, bordering on tobacco or licorice, followed by a middle and finish that are extremely dry. The hopping combined with the roasty malts really dominates the aftertaste, leaving a puckering bitterness. The hops are there, but only in presence--the flavour of them is hard to discern behind those malts. Youch. Some of the bitterest malting I have had in a beer. A lovely array of flavours, but the coffee taste really DOES dominate this beer. This is like chewing a mouthful of coffee beans and then having a sip of water. Reminds me of Yukon Brewing's Espresso Stout, with more dryness. Dark chocolate and coffee and charcoal. Actually not overly complex, but definitely not dispassionate: the flavour is exactly what one would expect--full on coffee bitters and dark malts. A wonderful porter, though I'll say it again, porter is never my first choice. Drinkable...to a point. Gets a little dry after a couple. Nice to have available, and something I would pick up again. Rogueish charm.","Cwrw","May 03, 2006"

Chocolatey overtones. Thick mouthfeel but smooth. As the beer is left to sit the mocha taste becomes stronger and sweeter. Starts and remains slightly hoppy. I was expecting sweeter, especially after having had their chocolate stout, but I still liked the unique flavor.

This to my novice tongue, seems to be right on the cusp of actually being a stout. Either way though, it tastes great and is one I will revisit. Mouthfeel is creamy and good.

Unfortunately, the malts suggested by the aroma did not show up as prominently in the palate as I had expected. Maybe I'm being a little harsh here, but it seemed like the malt taste was too weak and gave way to the hoppy finish too quickly for a robust porter.

Substantial hop bitterness comes in and makes for a lasting bitter finish. Surprisingly drinkable as well. Not my favorite porter but definitely worth recognition.","thechaacster","Aug 10, 2005"

Thin light khaki head come up for a moment before disappearing into the darkness. Aroma is not shy. Big semi-sweet chocolate nose on this one. Citric hop smell peeks out from beneath the big roasted and mocha character. Carbonation is a little higher than expected, which breaks up an otherwise near oily mouthfeel that is not too far removed from old coffee. Chocolate flavor is more bitter than portended by the aroma. Coffee flavor is present as well, but I wouldn't necessarily call it a mocha flavor. Roasted grain comes through well. Finish is highly roasted with some bitter citrous hops coming through, leaving a lasting dry and bitter aftertaste. Interesting porter.","BeerFink","Jul 22, 2005"

Medium body makes it fairly drinkable, I don't know about sessionable, but I could throw back a few.

3.88,0.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"12 oz bottle obtained from the Sanctuary (Iowa City) in June 2005. pours a thin yet fine light brown head over a very dark mohoganey colored liquid. Smells roast, cherry sour, vanilla, coffee, and alcohol. I smell hops...they are there but I can't tell the particular character beneath the alcohol Citrusy, I think. Perhaps the hops are part of what I preceive to be alcohol on my nose. Taste is roast coffee with some chocolate and ends very roast at the end in the form of sour (black patent?). A caramel in the middle carries a nice transition as the initial roast settles and the sour roast rises. Md-thick mouthfeel and mild carbonation work well for this beer. It gets a sharp tangy carbonation on the tongue as the cherry sour comes in, but neither is so strong as to be lifted to an unpleasant level. Whatever that alcohol/hop smells is, it's a taste in the aftertaste that rises up through the throat and batters the back of my tongue. The chocolate gets stronger in both the smell and taste as the beer warms, which is good, as the roast was beginning to hang in the mouth.","mentor","Jun 16, 2005"

It pours a jet black color with no light penetration whatsoever (the first sign this is an awesome brew) and with a 1.5 inch brow head that leaves intricate lacing all the way down the glass. The smell is roasted and chocolate malt along with some coffee and raisins. The taste- where to begin, this is a very complex and intriguing brew. Beginss with a roasted malt note, followed by a dark chocolate flavor that lead into the big coffee taste, very much like a mocha (albeit a very, very dark one) from a quality coffee shop. The coffee flavor, while prevalent doesnt overwhelm the brew as i've seen in previous cases and leads into a bitter roasted malt/hoppy finish that lingers on the tongue. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy like a porter should be but slightly less so than a stout, also has a crisp carbonation thats just right for a porter.

When you first sip it, there is no taste that immediately jumps out at you...but once you hold it in your mouth for a few seconds it starts to tickle all of your taste buds with a rich chocolate-stout taste. After it has been swallowed, it lingers for a good long while until you take another sip and the process is repeated. A great beer for sipping, and for someone who is into stouts and would like to try a new take on them.","Toddv29424","Mar 07, 2005"

Smell is earthy with chocolate, hops, and a bit of coffee. Could use a bit more aroma. Flavors are of coffee, chocolate, and earth with citric/floral hops that leave a fairly hefty bitterness. Notes of ruby red grapefruit come through in the middle. Lots of hops - good ol' Rogue. Slight mouth numbing/chest warming from the alcohol and the body is medium and smooth. Would make a nice session beer.","mmmbeer","Mar 06, 2005"

Beer is color of molasses with no real highlights and obviously no visible carbonation. Rich, smooth smells of roast barley, pumpernickel, and raisins covered in baking chocolate. Paradoxically, these aromas seem to sweeten with warmth. Not to blast anything about the smell, but where's the mocha? Coffee does seem to be more forthright in the taste... rich bitterness of plain black coffee abounds, with a finish like bitter greens left to caramelize too long... charred iron skillet flavors. Carbon. Flavors are integrated but lack development. Mouthfeel is firm and moderately sticky with tingling carbonation; persistent bitter aftertaste; heavy finish. Drinkable, but a bit too aggressive to be sessionable, and not quite curious enough to encourage exploration. Solid, yes. But also--at least for non-coffee drinkers like myself--one-dimensional.","NearerMyBeerToMe","Oct 03, 2004"

The black lacquer body is full and silky and paints the glass with elegant lace. The alleged mocha property is either deliberately muted or merely implied. Its certainly not a core, defining characteristic, which is instead derived from darkly roasted (if not charred) grains. The finish here is this beers most alluring asset.

3.73,-3.4,4.5,4,3.5,3,4,"Rogue Mocha Porter was served from a 12 paper labeled bottled. In a pint glass, the beer was nearly black (back-lighting revealed a deep ruby tone), and was topped by an ample and persistant light brown head that left excellent sheet lacing. The nose yielded a well developed mocha maltiness that was cut through by a cola-like sharpness. These notes were carried through into the taste, which offered an effervescent mocha-cola malt profile, which became more chochlatey in the transition to a nice choco-cola bittered finish which left long-lingering coffee notes. The body seemed a little thin for the character of the beer, and the carbonation was certainly over-fluffy....which would explain the nicely persistant head. Despite these flaws, Mocha Porter was a enjoyable beer, and would make a fine session brew.","HiroProtagonist","Jul 30, 2004"

Similarly, there is no significant hop taste, only hop bitterness masking whatever malitness there may be in this brew, combining with the strong roastiness of the malt to present a broad, outspoken, bitter taste profile, with lingering charcoal and coffee. The beer is dry, perhaps a little prickley, with no sweetness to speak of. The lack of hop taste and aroma fits with the traditional form of porters, but considering the revision of porters in the Northwest, I miss these features, and feel they could round out this beer, making interesting what is now a rather mundane beer.","Crotor","Apr 01, 2004"

Very malty aroma with chocolate....smells like lactose, like a milk stout There's also just a tinge of sourness in the aroma (but not in a bad way) which comes from the generous use of PNW hops marrying with the dark roasted malts. SN Porter has that same quality in the nose. Lots of bittersweet chocolate and espresso in the flavor with a slightly mineral finish. An abundance of dark roasted flavors makes me think there's some roasted barley in there, but a quick check of the Rogue website proves me false.

Tall bitterness and roasty flavors hit first before mellowing out into a distinctive sweet creaminess that cooperates with a serious dose of tasty hops for a taste that lingers long. The mouthfeel is chewy and, in my estimation, perfect for a porter. What carbonation there is adds a nice dimension. The drinkability is fantastic, but this is certainly an indulgence for me.

It had a taste that was very similar in many respects. A strong Coffee taste leading to a strong choclate taste. Fantastic. It was everything a Porter should be.

Flavors brought to the table are a creamy zing of coffe esque chocolate covered tones with a slight burnt finish nice porter maybe a little disappointed for not following the pattern of most west coast brewers with the hops.

Very chocolatey at first, but it does lead into a bitterness that at first is not bad, but builds throughout the glass. The mouthfeel is pretty nice, very bubbly and light.

Anyways, the taste is almost like a espresso shot with chocolate undertones. The alcohol in the drink is evident, but not overbearing. There is some evidence of fruit in the initial taste.

After waiting a few minutes for the head to dissipate, I finished the pour.  The head retention on this beer is great as well.  I enjoyed the rocky, dark tan head for several minutes, and it left a very thick lace on the glass and kept a fairly thick ring around the edge of the glass througout the entire beer.  The body of the beer is dark brown.  The aroma is of sweet chocolate and some coffee notes mixed with a hint of hops aroma.  The taste is a kaleidescope of flavors that seemed to change with every sip.  From bitter hops, to dark chocolate, to coffee, to roasted malt, then sweet chocolate.  This beer had very complex flavors that were extremely enjoyable.  The mouthfeel was good, but not a thick as I think the beer deserves, as a thicker mouthfeel may complement the wide array of flavors better.  The drinkability is also fairly good.

The body is medium with a gentle carbonation and a silkiness in the mouth. The flavor is hoppy up-front, followed by dark bittersweet chocolate and some limited cocoa, then a flash of hop flavor and a solid roastiness which leads to a dry finish. There's some lingering roastiness and an earthy/mineral character (probably from hops), as well as a very slight astringency which doesn't seem bothersome. The balance is definitely more towards roasty bitterness than malty sweetness! This is a beer that's best enjoyed at cellar temperature where it's full character can be appreciated.

4.13,7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Very dark, with a little yeast chunkiness. Nice multi-size-bubbled head, 1/4 of an inch of persistent dark foam. A sweetened coffee aroma -- no surprise there. Nice multi-dimensional taste, a warble between the java flavor and alternate notes of caramel and toffee. Very nice (a little overdone) hop acidity also adds to the complexity and balances impressively. Quite a handful in the mouth despite not very full body. Very good Porter to my tongue.","ADR","Jun 27, 2002"
4.3,11.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Virtually black in color, but when held to light this brew exhibits a deep garnet color and excellent clarity. The beige head is thick, rock and well retained.  The combination of chocolate malt, dark caramel sweetness and toasty malt notes make the aroma quite appealing.  A light citrusy hop nose is perceptible towards the end.  The flavor is bittersweet overall.  Caramel malt & residual sweetness hit the palette at first, but are ensued by mellow chocolate malt, a bit of deeply roasted black patent sharpness, and assertive but clean hop bitterness.  The body is just a tad shy of providing a good foundation for the big flavors. It finishes w/ a strong roasted grain and hop bitterness, while a sugary sweetness lingers on the tip of the tongue.  Mocha Porter is a unique and flavorful robust porter.","marc77","Jun 16, 2002"
3.92,1.6,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Fairly highly hopped offering from Rogue, which is not atypical for the brewery.  Nice thick body with complex malty flavor.  Not bad, but not as smooth as some.","beernut7","May 08, 2002"
4.18,8.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"These coffee style stouts/porters aren't my thing but this is a dandy....black with a tan lace that lines the glass...not a huge aroma but some nice sweeter type coffee notes...very creamy mouthfeel.  A sweeter mocha style and thick...A heavy porter...Boy you catch the hop bitterness big-time on the long finish (Just as I prefer on this style)..immediate taste is a sweeter mocha taste, but followed by that deeper hop finish...a pretty amazing beer.  Like I said, not my bag of tea(err coffee) but I must give props to an extremely well made beer.","ZAP","Apr 26, 2002"
4.45,15.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Very dark brew but the faintest hint of light does get through.  Very creamy brown head with depth and moderate retention.  There is a thick chocolate aroma.  Very much like mocha (surprise).  I also get a nice roasted malt aroma on the nose.  This is my kind of porter.  I like a hoppy porter that also exhibits the chocolate and roast qualites without fail.  This is it.  Similar to the SN Porter.  I thought this had a good hop load and indeed it does.  I looked up the IBU and it is 54.5 using perle and centennial hops.  But this really accentuates the great porter traits in my opinion.  I still get great mocha, coffe, bitersweet chocolate and roasted malt tastes.  Very good porter.","Bighuge","Apr 12, 2002"
4.16,7.8,5,4,4,4,4.5,"This could easily pass for a stout, but as such wouldn't score as well. As a porter, it's incredible. Deep black with a tan head, it is well named with chocolate coffee tones. Good beer.","aracauna","Apr 01, 2002"
4.2,8.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The pour creates a very dark black color, with a very nice fluffy, creamy, foamy dark tan head. Notes of chocolate, mocha coffee, and hops in the aroma. The same can be found in the taste mocha, notes of chocolate, with nice hop balance. Overall I enjoyed this one very much! An excellent Porter!","WilliamPhilaPa","Mar 25, 2002"
4.02,4.1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"On tap. Not cask but a fresh keg. The head dissipated almost instantly. Mild and smooth with a tasty burnt undercoat, set askew by typical West Coast hop bite. Ends up tangy for a porter, with a thin mouthfeel. I found it sharp but definitely not fizzy. This is pretty good, but just shy of greatness in my book. Not as mocha-ey as I was expecting.","Thrasher","Mar 12, 2002"
4.23,9.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"On cask and at cellar temperature this beer sported a huge, creamy, dark tan head that was like a dessert in itself. Thick and luscious with obvious coffee and chocolate notes it was hard to live up to my expectations when I finally got to the beer. Carbonation was mild and I didn't get the spritzy taste that others have commented on. Rogue's northwest hops cut through the dark roasted malts and left a subtly out of place bitterness on the palate. Temperature definitely mellowed this porter and  brought out it's unique qualities. A very good porter, but different, true of most of Rogue's brews.","QXSTER1","Mar 07, 2002"
3.14,-18.7,5,3.5,3,3,2.5,"Deep dark brown almost black in color.  Huge foamy, dark tan head that lasted all the way to the bottom of the glass followed with lace all along the sides. Chocolate, coffee, and hops aroma.  Dark roasted mocha, malt, bittersweet chocolate taste with plenty of bitterness from the hops.  Nicely carbonated body that feels slightly thin and watery.  Finishes very hoppy and slighty on the dry side.  Above average bitterness for a porter and not quite as sweet as most..  It was more acidic than bitter, like the rind of a grapefruit.  Good, but not what I was looking for in a porter","ThreePistols","Mar 01, 2002"
4.85,25.6,5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"pours out dark as night and a nice looking tan head develops which sticks around to the end of the glass.  i worked up the sediment left at the bottom of the bottle and added that to my glass also.  smell is a delight of roasted coffee, chocolate, and hops.   the first thing i thought of after smelling it and taking the first few sips was how similar it is to summit great northern porter of st. paul mn. but after having a few more sips i'd say this is a bit more complex and a just a bit smoother.  taste is a combo of bittersweet chocolate and hops with some vague coffee notes that linger on the palate quite a long time after consuming.  bitter beer face never made me smile so big!","budgood1","Feb 19, 2002"
2.56,-33.7,4,3,2.5,2,2,"The roasted malt was huge in this beer, and right on, but the bitterness and effervescence were way to aggressive in a porter, in my opinion.","hooligan","Feb 06, 2002"
3.7,-4.1,4,4,4,3,3,"I guess I'm out of the concensus here.  Yes, there are nice chocalate/roasted coffee aroma and flavor undertones.  And I'm surprised that there aren't more mentions of it's high hop bitterness.  These are all good things.  But they just don't seem to meld together the way I would expect from Rogue.  The mouthfeel is spritsy(?) with all the components competing against each other instead of complementing each other.  Still very tasty, just not great.","pbrian","Nov 29, 2001"
4.84,25.4,4,5,5,4,5,"Mocha Porter indeed! Lovely chocolate tones...I love to swirl the thick sediment at the bottom & dump it into the glass...like viscuous mud!","beerluvr","Nov 06, 2001"

5,29.5,5,5,5,5,5,"Very bold with tons of coffee/dark chocolate notes.  Be sure to check for freshness, however, because this beer goes downill fast with age.","Brent","Mar 08, 2001"
4.62,19.7,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"This is one of my favorite beers.  You really couldn't do a much better job of capturing a mocha flavor in a beer.  The taste and drinkablity are great.  Smouth mouthfeel and it finishes pretty clean for the abundance of mocha taste.  All in all a highly drinkable beer.","Murph","Feb 16, 2001"
