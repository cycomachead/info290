"Dark tan froth atop a charcoal black brew.  Smells of dark chocolate, charred wood, currant and milk chocolate deep down.  Caramel sweetness up front backed by a slight toastiness, a hint of floral hops and nutty right down the middle.  The aftertaste lingers metallic.  Medium to heavy in body and smooth all the way.  A tasty ride albeit with an annoying bump or two in the road."

"Solid traditional porter. Aroma reminds me of oatmeal, sight is black brown with a white head. I love ballast point all around, very creative style and I love growing up in San Diego"

"Overall - An interesting porter, though I'm not completely sold on it. The grainy/grassy notes it displays doesn't quite work for me. That said, I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another go, maybe with some age on it."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass.  I wasn't sure what to expect from this porter.  I have seen it described as a desert in a bottle and I guess that could be accurate but I think this beer can be used for many different occasions than just a desert beer.  I picked up some coffee, chocolate, and vanilla in the nose.  Taste was great!  Light chocolate and roasted coffee with a hint of vanilla.  It ended dry with roasted coffee.  Very delightful.  I do not like a hoppy beer and the hops were definitely there but it was very well balanced and the hops were welcome and blended very well.  I will seek this out again and set aside a bottle for a nice fall evening ."
"so glad these guys have their beer all over town finally, so many good ones to choose from, and it has been fun to drink through the available lineup. this is a great porter, a little more simple and straightforward than some of their other offerings, but of equal quality no doubt. maybe an oatmeal porter, as this has a lot of body and froth, and an almost creamy feel to it. there is some sweetness among the dark malt depth of this one, but its not a caramel malt thing, more of a chocolate going on. amazing it finishes as dry as it does, considering that middle sweetness. very little yeast profile to this one, which i suppose is part of what makes it an american style porter, but its almost like it needs more descriptors in the name, because its pretty interesting, american porter just doesnt seem to do it justice. a great after dinner beer, a great winter beer, a great morning beer, and a great beer on a hangover, versatile in its appeal, and dynamic in its flavor, although it is indeed less nuanced than some of their hoppy beers. this one doesnt have much hops, but they arent missing. it has a fresh baked character, warming, and really just a true example of the style. wonderful on tap, no bottles for me yet."

"Lovely balanced flavor of dark malts and a clean, crisp, but dry hop finish. The hoops are not overpowering but for a Porter they do come up stronger."

"O: A well-crafted, relatively dry porter.  Allowed to warm for about 15 minutes it nonetheless improved with further warming, with both the strength and the complexity of the flavor increasing."
""
""
"To me the beer missed the mark. Nice start, but the lingering aftertaste killed the overall experience."
""
""
"Chocolate brown color with ruby edges.  There is some roasted notes and also some faint smoke in the nose.  The body is about what I’d expect for the style.  The roast profile is very nice and there is a good combination of bitterness coming from both the roasted malt and the hops."

"Has a decent amount of yeast and hops that blend in nicely with a heavily roasty, cocoa cereal grain feel. Certainly worth having again if you like Porters."
""
""
""
""
""

""

"A very solid Porter, and I'd say in the San Diego style- a nice hoppiness pairs seamlessly with the smooth roastiness. The mouthfeel is downright silky and the beer overall is extremely well balanced. Piney hops play off of chocolate and lightly roasted grains with a fairly deep, bitter finish where the roast and hop bitterness intermingles. Quite well done."

"The bottle's description of 'hop-forward porter' is spot-on. The hops are certainly present but, not overpowering, making this a unique porter. A solid effort."

"The mouthfeel seemed to be a tad chalky at first; this initial sensation dissipated as a comfortable maltiness slowly replaced it to make for a wonderful balance at the finish. This is a substantial and filling porter that has me hook, line and sinker. (Sorry.)"

"Food match: The mocha flavours make it good as both a dessert beer and a roast game meats, hard cheese beer. My ideal meal to go with this (not eating meat because I am a vegetarian and all) is a grilled portabello mushroom sliced and served on Soba noodles with Kecap Manis drizzled heavily on top."

""
""
""
"Poured a blackish body with two-finger tan head that left a lace ring on top of an aroma comprised of roasted and smokey malts, spicy hops and minor sweetness. Very smooth, easy to drink, but not in a slick, watery way, the taste itself being of roasted coffee, some caramel sweetness, touch of dark fruity hops, all blended well together for one great porter. Mixes sweet and roasted malts along with hops for fruit notes and crisp finish for balance; this is a well-assembled porter and very affordable compared to others."

"Looks like a porter, smells like a porter. Heck, it even taste like a porter. Really, the flavor profile of this beer isn't all that complex, but it is extremely well balanced and wonderfully creamy. I would have no problem ordering several of these at a bar."
""
""
"Overall a very solid porter, delicious!"
"O-this is a wonderful porter, definitely one of the best i've had. the flavors are all strong and great and yet it remains a slight uniqueness to it to set it apart from others that i've had. definitely something that i'll suggest to others. SO GLAD BALLAST POINT IS NOW IN MARYLAND!!!!"

"Overall, quite drinkable without a wow factor. Drink not review!!!!"
""

"Poured into pint handle with deep black colour with cola hue when against light. Rich mocha head and lots of lacing. Aroma has coffee malt with a very faint citrus note that's hardly discernible if too cold. Flavour is coffee/cocoa and roast beef and a slight caramel body. Bitterness at the end but good length and clean finish. Mouthfeel is moderate carbonation with mild body tending to slightly watery. Still, it's lip-smacking at the end and I really like this porter. Not complex but well balanced and tasty."
""
"glad I had 1 though. To style."
"OK but I wanted more body, less vegetal character and for the bitterness to come from roast instead of hops. Comes across close to an IPA/Porter hybrid."
"O-- Really nice, easy to drink and feels bigger than what it is. Lots of roast and that is good. Good casual drinker that is not 10%"
""
"O- A nice porter, it's heavy on the roast which I'm personally a fan of, very tasty and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"This beer had a lot of character and was fairly easy to drink. No major flaws, just good flavors. Would have preferred more alcohol and fainter hoppy bitterness, but still a really good beer."

"O - An amazing porter, extremely drinkable. As good and smooth of a porter I have ever head"

"D/O Drinkability is at least fair. Overall this is a good porter. 4.0"

"22oz bottle, pours dark brown/mahogany with some ruby red at the edges of the glass when held to a light. Foamy beige head holds good retention and leaves some spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas seem a little muted with hints of cola, toasted grain, molasses, chocolate and faint anise. Tastes are bolder with complex notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, anise, char, smoke, pine, burnt caramel, coffee, and cola. Medium bodied, smooth, and creamy, finishing somewhat bitter and dry. Overall, nice take on a west coast porter, perhaps. Nice balance between malts and hops with great complexity."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass a deep dark chocolate brown with ruby highlights a nicely formed 1/2 finger tannish colored head atop.Earthy aromas with some bitter chocolate and mild molasses,it's an American porter that's for sure.Starts out semi sweet with caramel, molasses,and cocoa notes, than a rush of earthy smokiness takes over in a lingering finish.Top notch,I would even say a standard for the ""American"" style of a porter with it's big hopped up earthy finish,just great."
"I like this porter quite a bit. It has depth and character,with a roasty coffee flavor that never descends into being a hop-bomb. It is still no GL Edmund Fitzgerald or SS Taddy Porter, but it is a fine IPA, and at $4.99 for a 22 oz bottle, a good buy as well."
""
"An absolute must-try and comes highly recommended."

"Review #500"
"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, best by dating is unreadable. Pours slightly hazy dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger dense khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some decent lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, coffee, bread, nuttiness, light citrus, and herbal hops. Nice and very well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of chocolate, caramel, biscuit, roasted malt, nuttiness, slight coffee, citrus, and herbal hops. Light coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, nuttiness, biscuit, roasted malt, caramel, coffee, and herbal hops on the finish for a bit. Fairly robust flavor profile, with very nice balance of flavor. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Alcohol is nicely hidden with hardly any warming on the finish noticed. Very easy to drink. Overall this is a damn nice and well balanced porter. I really have nothing to knock against it. Really enjoyable stuff."
"Not complex just an average dark beer."
""
""
""
""
"A pleasantly full-flavoured porter, with a small wink to the traditional style with that wee tang, but this show is for the new world fans - big, chocolaty, restrained in booze and oh-so-sweetly balanced."
""
""
"O - Very nice porter. Borderlines on too much char, but this is roasty and tasty with a very nice, creamy mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours a deep brown with a large head. Great lacing. The aroma is heavy on the roasted malts, with an almost smore-like effect going on the background with some toasted malts, chocolate, and a bit of sugar sweetness. The taste is also very roasty with coffee and malts, with a bit of vanilla. It's got a very full flavor though, setting it apart from the pack. Smooth at first and finishing prickly, thanks to the easy-drinking mouthfeel yet fairly aggressive roastiness on the finish. Overall, this is just a very well-done porter. It doesn't really offer anything new on the flavor block, but is just a high-quality and well-executed porter."
""
""
""
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the brew pours dark brown with an inch and a half frothy tan head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. Aroma is roasted malt, bittersweet and milk chocolate, nuts, and some coffee. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like roasted and burnt/charred malt, chocolate, nuts, and a little bit of coffee. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's very smooth and easy to drink. I like this brew a lot, I'd definitely buy this again in the future. It's a nice, easy drinking, tasty brew."
""
""
""
"Overall - Tasty yet forgettable. The hint of dark fruit is nice but the flavours don't really pop. Still an above average beer that I would drink again - I just wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
""
""
"O – A very solid porter. Looks amazing, and the mouth feel is almost perfect. It is maybe lacking a little depth, and I found myself having a lingering want for “more” out of this beer that never came. Still, I have bought it before, and will most likely do it again, as it’s one of the better American porters currently available in my area."
""
""
""
"This pours a dark roasty black with some light sneaking around the edges but not much. In any dimly lit bar I wouldn’t even notice. Heady topping of foam releases a glorious aroma resplendent of coffee (dark and regular roast) and dark chocolate. Flavor is all coffee and cacao nibs with a slight bitterness on the edges. Warms well and remains drinkable. Not hoppy but the hops give it a bite and sharpness that I gladly welcome."

"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a very dark, blended brown coloring that is black in the depths, with a thin, frothy head that is a good, darker beige coloring. Aromas are light and effervescent, with a good coffee background giving rise to some dark fruit and nutty sweetness. Rich nose, but avoids overpowering. Flavors are smooth and robust, with a dark roasted coffee bitterness highlighted by some cocoa bittersweet. Some woody and earthy characteristics give the beer a more rustic feel, and the smooth body has a significant crispness at the end to really keep the tastebuds interested. A smokey, nutty, and tangy sweet aftertaste, with a slightly lingering finish. Good porter."

"O: Solid porter, very easy drinking and tasty. Another good beer from Ballast Point."
""
"Bottle: Poured a dark black color porter with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of light green hops with some light roasted malt notes is quite pleasant. Taste is an interesting mix between some green hops with light bitter notes and some roasted malt with light dry aftertaste. Body is quite full with light creamy notes and good carbonation. Nothing over the top in this beer though well brewed and easily drinkable."

"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of roasted malts, some coffee. Taste is strong coffee up front, roasted malts, very mild hops. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall if coffee is your thing, an enjoyable beer."

"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. Deep brown almost black appearance with 1 finger of dark tan head that fades quickly. Spotty lacing at best. Smell of coffee, toffee and rich malts. A bit of chocolate and some earth tones with pine. Taste is similar to the nose with a nice mellow hop ending that is not too bitter. A bit of coffee in the taste. Not much complexity. A decent amount of carbonation adds to the feel to go with the silk and cream of a good porter. A little on the dry side. Overall- A solid porter that is not spectacular but also not lacking anything. I was wanting a bit more sweet, malty flavor that just didn't come through. More flavor came through as the beer warmed however. Another good effort by Ballast Point, I will have another at some point- Pretty tasty-"
"I haven't found a Ballast Point beer I don't like. This beer is another reason why I've quickly grown to like their entire lineup."
"O: Disappointed with this beer. The appearance and smell had me so excited for the taste, only to be let down by a watery drink."
"Overall: easy to session, consistent in presentation. Not too bitter, or sweet - pairs well with a burger."
"A good solid porter here. Nothing of note, but definitely worth seeking out."
"I really enjoyed the Black Marlin with my chocolate dessert. It was a great pairing. I miss the time from when I lived just up the hill from their home-brew store. I was really sorry to hear about them no longer distributing to New Jersey."
"O - I guess I anticipated too much for this beer. Everytime I get a west coast porter I expect to crack it open and taste a Firestone Walkers Reserve, but I guess they all can't be that good. This beer was first bland to me, so cleanse your palate! After I did I felt way better about it. Very sweet on the sugars, something you don't see too much. Its almost a Belgian influenced porter, which is probably why it took me so long to figure it out. Not the best, but not bad either. Check it out, and definitely check out Sea Monster, which is basically this 3X. Cheers!"
"D - Rock solid American Porter... Above average for the style... No complaints here... I would drink this again in an instant... Nicely done by Ballast Point..."
"A nice porter, comfortable to drink, the flavours aren't huge, but easy to settle on."
"O: Ballast Point's Black Marlin Porter is just that: a porter. It's not special in most any way, yet it passes the style profile test. I wouldn't turn one down, but won't seek it out or ask for it by name."
"03/20/2012 tasting - On tap at the Linkery in San Diego. Dark brown with a ruby glint. Long raspy taste, a lot of charred malt. Big nose of charcoal and very bitter. The whole experience is blackened, roasted, and darkly bitter. A little bit sour with all the black barley. Not as decent as I reviewed last time."
"O: This is an excellent porter - nice and roasty but dry and bitter offsetting the roast."
"O - I liked this Porter quite a bit it has a good taste to it and has a decent body this one is worth checking out"
"Good porter; really solid all around, the feel lost it for me a bit but it didn't affect how I feel about this beer very much."
"Overall an excellent value to an excellent beer. Few porters can stand up to the gusto of Black Marlin. Despite the tasty nature of Sculpin, this is my favorite Ballast Point offering to date."
"Overall this isn't quite as good as the BA version but is still an excellent porter. A definite recommendation."
"O - One of the best porters I have had to date. Possibly right behing Edmund Fitzgerald."
"Black Marlin Porter is not a beer you'd throw back. In fact, I'm thinking of having the bottle stuffed to hang in my cellar. Few brewers can emulate the balance and restraint of classic English examples while at the same time providing a breadth of rich, decadent flavour. This is one American offering that won't grate among the senses of purists. Thanks Martin!"
"I cant believe these brews are still lying around not complaining though and it pours a dark ruby hue with nice carbonation that leaves behind a creamy two finger head that slowly diminishes to one finger and a rim of lacing just like a nice cappicino,the smell is burnt toffee,roasted chocolate and some dark fruits aswell,the mouthfeel starts off light but ends fuller and has tastes of roasted chocolate,burnt toffee,molasses,dark coffee,cinamon and is finished with a nice hit of hops to balance any sweetness first encountered and overall i really enjoyed this porter as the mouthfeel is thicker than most other porters but still very sessionable and i would buy again."
"Really nice porter. You can unlock a lot of flavor if you can let it warm up. Where'd my bomber go?"
"O: Overall, I found this to be pretty enjoyable, even if fairly simple. It goes down easy and is fairly well balanced, though a bit on the sweet, malty side. I expected a bit more of a hop presence, as eluded on the bottle, but that wasn't a dealer breaker for me. Solid, but unspectacular."
"Serving type: on-tap"
"O: This a very nice porter with a nice full body. I could drink this all day."
"Poured a 2"" light mocha colored head. Clear burnt umber brown body with slow moving bubbles. Smells of sweet malt. Taste has the malt and also coffee. It's quite light and enjoyable to taste, lighter than I'd expect in a porter. There is a lasting finish which I'd say builds into a dark cocoa flavor. So although not a powerhouse it has many redeeming qualities as a porter."
"O: Good. This is an incredibly drinkable beer. A very solid offering from a good brewery, but I have to admit that it's not too distinguishing."
"O - Solid brew, definitely will be in the rotation."
"Sampled this one on tap at the Ballast Point Brewery/Home Brew Mart in San Diego. Poured a very dark brown, nearly black, with a small brown head. Aromas of roasted malt, dark chocolate and toffee. On the palate, this one is medium bodied and nicely balanced, with flavors of coffee, dark chocolate and roasted malt."
"O-For me this beer was all over the place, but it tasted pretty good and I'm glad I got to try it."
"D: This is a really enjoyable porter. It doesn't blow you away with unique flavor but it's a pretty solid beer overall. It is well balanced, has good flavor and it very easy to drink."
"O: Really enjoyable and comes across ""lighter"" than some porters. The hops play a role but not like other west coast porters, here they support and round out and balance the roastiness. If I see this beer I will drink it again."
"Pours an almost opaque dark brown color with a nice 2 inch beige head that fades to a small fluffy cap. Nice rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smells of roasted malt, coffee beans, and bittersweet chocolate. Taste is of roasted dark malt, bitter coffee grounds, and cocoa nibs. The bitterness that lingers on the palate is of coffee grounds. Decent carbonation but a little flat and somewhat thin bodied. Overall, this is a pretty good porter for what it is but nothing too special."
"Rich inky black looks nice, little head. Aroma is lovely chocolatey mocha. On the palate, however, there is a coffe-grounds bitterness that detracts from the overall enjoyment of what is otherwise a rich, flavorful, creamy porter. That burnt aspect would have me look for another porter when I want that style."
"It's a shame. I was really looking forward to tasting this and it's possible it's beyond optimal date. In these cases I usually exit my review without saving and review again if I get a fresh bottle. But Ballast Point doesn't date their bottles so I can't assume that it's not fresh (other than getting good reviews from others). If a brewery does not date their bottles then they're going to have to deal with bad reviews on aged beer."
"I need to get my hands on some sculpin but this is a point for Ballast Point!"
"One of my favorites. Don't pass this one up"
"P.S. DO NOT GRAB AN OLD BMP. I've had several older bottles and I can tell you, FRESH IS BEST. If you review a bottle older than 8 months you aren't tasting a very good BMP. My opinion of course, but an educated opinion for sure folks."
"Generally I don't seek these types of beer out. But...It was actually pretty damn good."
"Drinkability: With the way Ballast Point is brewing, I'll keep reeling these beers in. Haven't had a bad one yet, and the Black Marlin Porter is another trophy in their already impressive lineup. Big fan of porters and this one is an outstanding example. If you haven't had this yet, get your rod & reel ready and cast that line! This is going into my regular rotation!"
"Mouthfeel is quite smooth and slick. Doesn't leave a coating at all, and isn't syrupy in any way. Very easy flowing beer without being watery. Drinkability is similarly great, as the beer is enjoyable from start to finish, and incredibly easy going down. Abv of 6% is admirable for the amount of flavors in there. Fantastic beer, and should probably be touted a lot more than it is. I find Sculpin everywhere, and rightfully so, but I wish this one was distributed just as aggressively."
"T: While this may not match up to some of Ballast's other darks like Victory or Sea Monster, this is a solid porter and worth trying. Some nice roasted malt and coffee going on in here along with a bit of dark chocolate that isn't overly bitter. The bourbon barrel aged version of this is a keeper."
"Overall: A tasty and well made American porter."
"rich depth of aroma that doesn't quite obtain with the flavor profile"
"D: Good deal of flavor and roastediness packed into a 6.0%abv package. Drinks bigger and fuller then expected. Not necessarily the drinkability of a table porter as noted on the label but ill trade it for a bigger and fuller experience with less volume anytime. A bomber sits about right."
"D - At about 7 dollars a bomber it's not really the first beer on my list but would love to drink it fresh at the brewery someday. Also wondering why this beer isn't available in 12oz bottles, this would mean cheaper prices and a solid staple in my fridge. Solid porter!"
"Good, but maybe just a little too American for me."
"The drinkability of this brew shines on me."
"Totally drinkable. I'd buy a six pack of this if I could. It makes an excellent cold weather brew."
"Thin mouthfeel for a porter for the booze smell it also goes down really smooth. I'm not overwhelmed by this beer."
"Its a lighter pretty solid Porter but nothing to write home about. I wouldnt mind buying it again if in the mood though."
"Drink ability is good, I didn't have a problem putting it down. Taste is good so I wanted to finish it."
"D- This is a good offering from a good brewery. Thanks again to Jason for hooking me up with this one and a ton of other goodies from Hawai'i that I can't get here."
"D-The overwhelming amount of carbonation is what makes it hard to drink."
"I'm going to go ahead and blame my low scores on a bad bottle. This is something I would like to revisit given Ballast Point's shining reputation."
"Above average carbonation and nice drinkability."
"D: I guess the fact that my wife (who is generally not a fan of beer) grabbed the glass from me and ran downstairs to play Soduko while polishing it off rather quickly speaks volumes as to its drinkabitity (which is only 6%). I WILL be getting more of this stuff.... if for no other reason, to have a brew to split with my lovely wife."
"Chad"
"Bottle. Pours a really dark brown almost black color with a nice 3 finger light tan head. Roasty coffee notes mixed with a nice milk chocolate aroma. Very creamy medium mouthfeel with some carbonation. Nice lace on the glass as I drink this down. The taste is pretty smooth and balanced with a nice balance on sweetness and roast. Slight leather taste in the ending but actually ends pretty dry and clean. As I had this in bottle I didn't get the nitrogen effect that it would have but I can imagine this would be one creamy porter."
"D: This is a nice American Porter, easy to drink, not a ton of alcohol. If you like a nice roasted porter with some hops bitterness, this is for you."
"Since when are marlins black? and also this beer is a dark brown not black, with a mild tan head. Coffee, rich malt, also a creamy vanilla.. Taste Wow surprisingly sweet, Big malt profile, some really coffee almost tobacco flavor. This is also pretty damn smooth for a porter, I like! pretty big amount of carbonation. Def gonna start buying this porter more often."
"Poured from a 22oz into my new Chimay goblet. Color-wise, a mix of cherry coke and coffee. About a finger of light brown head died fairly quickly, but persistent bubbles keep building from the middle of the glass. Not much lacing. Probably the wrong drinking vessel for the beer. Smell lots of dark chocolate, sweet dried red fruit, some Sherry like notes, nuts. A bit of maple syrup perhaps. Light on the mouth, good creaminess. Tastes of bitter chocolate, sweeter than a lot of porters, with more of that dried fruit and nuts flavor. Finished quite easily, with a medium length bitter finish."
"D: This beer by Ballast Point is a frequently-overlooked member of their standard line-up, yet it deserves top billing--right up there with Sculpin. It comes across as significantly less dry than most regular porters, distinguishing it as a beer with versatility in food pairings and as a good gateway selection for introducing new palates to the joys of dark ale. It tastes strikingly of chocolate; I don't know if chocolate is an ingredient, but they could call this a chocolate porter based just on the flavor alone."
"Drinkable to the nth degree. One of the best porters I've had based on it's appearance and layers of flavors."
"Solid beer from Ballast Point, but nothing world-shattering."
"D - Good porter, a little too carbonated for both my liking and the style, but it's tasty none-the-less."
"Overall, I really haven't had a bad beer from this brewery. Great job by them once again. Well balanced and drinkable. One of the best examples of the style I've had in a while."
"4/4.5/4/3.5/3.5"
"This is a drinkable porter. It would go well with chocolate or any caramel dessert or perhaps beef. I was a little disappointed that the built-up hop flavor was so subtle."
"Took a bit to blow off the metallic taste but once the beer warmed up I was rewarded with a rich mouthfeel and a big rounded porter that had quite a bit of hops to back it up. I liked the bigness of the beer as some porters are thin and have a short finish."
"this has tons of flavor and a nice lower ABV making this quite easy to drink and a lot of fun. i would love to have this again."
"Drinkability: An above average porter that is an easy sipper. Not a beer that blows me away, yet one to easily sit and relax with."
"D: Good drinkability with a moderate abv of 6%."
"Regardless, I like this beer. It lacks the alcohol presence and dryness that many American porters display. This almost seems like a blend between an American porter and an English milk stout."
"D: Flavors come out as it warms up."
"Aroma is rich and smoky with tones of quality roast coffee and molasses and just a hint of unsweetened chocolate. It pours a nearly black opaque sable with a fairly thick and somewhat persistent light tan head. Mouth-filling taste has flavors of good coffee and molasses with hints of licorice and toffee. Texture is exceptionally smooth with a good firm tingle. Definitely work catching."
"Pours your typical dark brown (maybe a tad lighter than typical) with a tan head. The noise has good chocolate malt present with a bit of alcohol and a bit of hops. The taste is very well balanced. Using more hops than normal for the style keeps the beer balanced longer on the palate. The malt takes a bit longer to make its presence felt than other English style porters (my favorite style of porter). The finish tends more to the chocolately side then roasty that lingers around. One of my favorite American style porters I have tried."
"I've now had the pleasure of trying 3 Ballast Point beers and all of them have been great. PLEASE start distributing in Florida!!!"
"D: A solidly drinkable American Porter."
"D - I could drink this while playing cards or such."
"Drinkability: Decent, but I'm not racing to blog/tweet for my friends to try this one. Maybe my bottle was a little off? I'm sure my next beer from Ballast Point will be better."
"D: Very impressive porter from Ballast Point and a pretty good deal to boot. Seek this one out -- it has hoppy characteristics of a ""robust porter"" like Smuttynose's version, with a little more roasted malt and sweet chocolate presence like Founder's brew."
"Opaque chocolate brown with a finger of tan froth that recedes to a collar after a few minutes. Big chocolate malt aroma with a light leafy hop character buried beneath. There's also a smattering of toasted nuts and charred grain. The taste mirrors the aroma; chocolatey, nutty, moderately roasty. Medium bodied, slightly chewy with a nougat, roasted grain and coffee finish. This is great stuff, nicely balanced and rather quaffable."
"D - Wow just so damn delicious, I loved the wonderful smokiness of this beer, hands down one of the best Porters Ive had, and I highly recommend this one. I could easily drink 4-5 pints of this wonderful brew. Very very good, I'll be buying this one again for sure. Cheers!"
"Appears a pitch black color with deep ruby highlights to the edges with a big tan head head forming thick. Lacing is fine and even with scattered lacing around the sides of my glass. Aroma has bitter coffee notes with toasted coconut creaminess with a touch of dark coffee in the finish with sweet cream. Flavor is full of robust dark roasts with creamed coffee accents and dark sweet chocolate notes. Mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied dry roasted malt creamy base goes down easy and smooth on the palate. Drinkability overall is nice, a good solid porter I'm down with this brew but I love my Great Lakes and Founders a bit more than this great example."
"Overall, a really good porter. Not the best in the class but in top third. The aroma and flavor dropped off during the session but still went down real easy. Recommend. Another really good one from Ballast Point. Rotation - not avail here in TX so got from South Bay thru Milt. If here, would be worth a bomber every so often. As is, definite on-tap while visiting out West and maybe some more shipped. Need to have another to decide for sure. [OR;OT;ShM]"
"D: Very tasty beer but a lingering creamy mouthfeel along with burnt undertones will make this porter a single..."
"This is drinkable, but far from my favorite porter. I will drink this again, but will not go out of my way for one."
"Overall this is a nicely crafted American Porter that is quite sessionable. Recommended."
"Pours a dark brown with a nice mocha head, although not too much lacing as it goes down. The smell is very nice and complex, with some dark chocolate, bits of coffee, and a few dark fruits. A little bit of smoke there as well. Taste is very similar with a slight hop bitterness. Medium mouthfeel with a bit of a creaminess. Very drinkable."
"Ballast Point makes one the beers tied for my first favorite beer: Sculpin IPA. The other is Bell's Two Hearted Ale. Together they are my beloved fish beers, so named because of the fish on their labels. My second favorite beer is Boulevard's Bully! Porter. Ballast Point, with Black Marlin Porter, has a ""Fish Porter."" No one cares about this significance but me, but it is my review so hush up. Ultimately, I don't love Black Marlin as much as I had hoped, but it is a very fine porter that I'd love to be able to buy where I live. Paired with the right meal, this porter will surprise you."
"This is a porter that goes down smooth and effortless, in other words, a drinker."
"Very easy drink. No harshness whatsoever and just a slight aftertaste on the buds. This is a great Porter for anyone wanting to break into the Porter style. Another well balanced, great drinking brew from the San Diego crew."
"Overall, a terrific brew. I wished I bought a couple of these. Very easy drinking and delicious. All of the pieces come together to make consumption a great process. Another good one from these guys."
"D-this has a pretty nice taste to it that brings a good malt center balanced with a nice sweetness, the mouthfeel is smooth and relatively creamy but the body lacks for my taste. the carbonation towards the back of the throat also burns a little, otherwise a great beer!"
"Drinkability: An above average beer from a brewery that typically provides above average offerings (and some truly stellar offerings). This is a porter that's characterized by a lot of earth and a few strange yeast contributions that - thought unique - may perhaps be off putting to some. It's definitely worth a try however (especially at a mere 6.0% abv), though I don't see it becoming part of my repertoire."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. The only thing I don't really like is the carbonation level. Other than that, a very solid, complex, interesting beer."
"Jam-packed with flavor and very drinkable, too drinkable if there is such a thing. Ballast Point gives the American Porter respect."
"Got it on tap, poured into a Standard Pint glass. Looks pretty good. Poured and close to a black color, extremely dark brown with dark amber highlights. There is a small tan colored head that goes away pretty quickly and there hardly any lacing to it, just a couple of random specks left on the glass. The aroma is pretty good. Smells of sweetroasted, toasted malts, coffee, and bittersweet chocolate. Slightly smokey with a very slight aroma of maybe dry hops. The taste is a little of a step up from the smell. Has similar features, but the hops stand out a bit more in the taste than the smell. The smokeyness is a little harder to distinguish in the flavor, but tastes and feels very well balanced overall. It's full bodied but the mouthfeel is very good, very smooth, a very drinkable porter."
"Sample at Alan's HSC initation. Thanks Rogueone for sharing! The beer pours a very dark brown color with a medium thin beige head that dissipates steadily. Spotty lacing on the glass.Nice roasted coffee aroma with notes of chocolate and malt. Medium body with flavors of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate and hops. The finish is dry and roasty with a mildly bitter hops and coffee aftertaste. Pretty enjoyable from start to finish."
"D - A solid effort, but nothing to seek out. I've had lots of porters that were worse, and lots of porters that were better. This is a nice dark beer, with decent flavor. I would drink it again, but it wouldn't be my first choice."
"D - Very good. This would be my ideal attempt at homebrewing a porter."
"Flavor follows the nose with spicy chocolate notes most prevalent. Finishes with a lingering malt structure of moderate length. Medium to full bodied and offering a good carbonation level keeping this beer more interesting than the tap version which glosses over too quickly. Easy drinking with a bit of a coarse chocolate texture on the finish, otherwise quite smooth and well constructed for its 6.0%."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth. Good carbonation making this an easy drinking porter. Hops work well in here and the only thing I'm not really digging is a lingering bitter roast on the finish. I haven't had many west coast porters but this is quite tasty and I wouldn't mind drinking it again. Cheers to Ballast Point."
"Very sessionable and easy drinking. Could drink this very often."
"Definitely a beer I would like to have more of and I am looking forward to trying more offerings from Ballast Point."
"drinkability is good. very mellow, easy going and flavorful. a solid porter; quintessential for the style."
"The mouth is somewhat creamy, but there is a bit of carbonation in this that makes it a touch bubbly. Flavor is very chocolate forward. Plenty of bitter roasted nuttiness mixed with the sweet chocolate makes this absolutely a treat to sip! Some wine characteristics are in there, but very subtley. This is a wonderful Porter from an excellent brewery. Everything I've had from here has been top notch, and this is no exception."
"Medium body with light to moderate carbonation, nice dry finish to it. This beer goes down very easily, and one can sit with for a while."
"Pours nearly black with tan head. Nose has a bit of a smokey, woody note with roasted, chocolate, and coffee notes. Palate is in line with the nose, especially the roasty flavors and some smoked wood. Chocolate is not sweet. Finish is somewhat dry also."
"Drinkability: Recommended. A top-notch porter, really. It's hearty, pleasantly malty, and a sheer joy to drink."
"D- A bit above a session beer and I could of drank more. This one is now on my radar for a bottle purchase to compare. Not mindblowing, but solid."
"It's very easy to drink this tasty porter."
"Overall- An excellent session beer. I could drink this one all afternoon."
"Drinkability- very drinkable, thoroughly enjoyed it"
"if you like a chocolate dominated porter then this one is for you...it's not just one dimensional as far as the chocolate goes...the coffee and hops hide in there and pop their heads out hear and there"
"Could drink this all night!"
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle poured into a nonic pint glass. The porter appears a dark chestnut color with about two fingers of ecru foam. Nose and flavor are of medium roasted grains, caramel, a touch of vanilla, molasses, mild cocoa. About medium bodied and amply carbonated for the style. Worth seeking out."
"(And, as I was once taught in my early wine tasting education many years ago, and somewhat paraphrasing...""you must taste bad beer to understand and appreciate good beer."" Again, just my opinion."
"22oz bottle into a DFH signature glass pours an almost opaque black with a nice frothy off-white head that lasts as a thin layer and leaves great lacing on the glass. Aroma is a nice amount of brown malt and slight cocoa. The taste is a nice amount cocoa blending nicely with brown malts and a hint of coffee and a nice hop balance. The beer is fairly light bodied and quite smooth and refreshing. This is a very enjoyable porter."
"Overall a very solid beer, a nice sessionable porter that does the style justice. I would revisit this one for sure."
"Overall- An excellent session beer. I could drink this one all afternoon."
"Pours a deep brown with a slight tan head that dissapated pretty quickly. Smells mildy of charred malt, licorice, coffee. Moderately strong taste of charred malt (which is the strongest). licorice, coffee, a bit of chocolate. Decent mix of flavor, but the charred taste stands out a bit too much. Not a big deal, but the overall taste is a bit mild. Very drinkable, though I've had better porters. A good offering, but not Ballast Point's strongest. The Victory at Sea Vanilla Coffee Porter, now THAT'S a porter!"
"Overall a nice suprise. I mean, I will always love Ballast Points IPAs and 3 sheets, among others, but its nice to see them produce a style they are not necessarily known for as well as this. Ballast is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries out there. Good stuff and great consistency from these guys. It was a blast to have them up here for GAKBBF, and I hope they make it up next year. Its only 3,767 miles, or is it 3676? something like that..."
"Rich and full, creamy mouthfeel, very satisfying. Very enjoyable beer and highly drinkable because I like the style and I could have several of these without getting knocked down."
"Notes: Straightforward, simple, well-hopped American Porter that drinks very easily. I would recommend this to anyone who would like a nice and mellow porter to give them an idea of the style."
"The aroma is dusty and chocolaty with toasted malt and metal. The appearance is dark brown with a large head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is a little thin. Overall not too bad but not too good either. This is pretty much a standard average porter."
"Mouth: Black coffee, slightly sour roast, some charcoal. Lacks some sweetness and body. Very dry, maybe a little astringent. Overall just seems a little watered down."
"Nearly full bodied and creamy on the tongue with a somewhat oily and fruity finish. A really nice example of the basic american porter."
"D - This was a good Porter, complex and tasty with the body I would expect, however, since it is not distributed here, I do not think I will search it out, but if I am somewhere and see this, I will not hesitate to drink this again"
"Flavor is as advertised from the nose with brown sugar notes and roasted malt dominating. Again the hops are not what I would call assertive. I get some faint hints on the finish with a little bit of an herbal presence but nothing more. I dont mind this as I like malty porters but the label claims assertive hopping and dont find em. The ABV is completely hidden and this beer is VERY drinkable. A nice brew for any time of year. check it out if you see it!"
"Poured a very dark brown with some tan foam and nice lace on the side of the glass. The smell of roasted malts and also a hint of smoke and chocolate filled the nose. The flavor was of roasted malts, chocolate and smoke. The only set back for me, is that it was a little to bitter. The over bitterness is what made this porter not one of my favorites. Overall, it had a nice pleasant flavor, the color was right, but, the over bitterness was the main turn-off!"
"Charcoal smoke and barley dominate the taste of this excellent porter. It's a pretty good looking beer with a fading head that leaves some lacing. The liquid is a deep dark brown with light cola coloring on the edges. The nose gives the first taste of charcoal smoke. Some hops also come through without overwhelming. It smells like a dry porter, if that makes sense. The flavor has some initial chocolate and caramel, but the wonderful charcoal flavor establishes itself quickly and knocks down the sweetness. There is a mildly bitter finish, possibly with citric hops but I can't quite taste them in such a roasty beer. The alcohol is used beautifully. It warms up the whole palate, like a good Imperial Stout or something. American Porter is a middle-of-the-pack style for my preferences, but I am really enjoying this Black Marlin. Maybe, it's just that porters often surprise because I don't expect to like them, or maybe I'm just better at avoiding bad examples."
"The drink is light-medium in body with very good carbonation and drinkability."
"D - The difference between and good Porter and an AMAZING Porter is the bitterness. I just cant enjoy something sweet for long. This is one of the better Porters out there."
"D - An average porter - no more, no less...it is pretty standard in most aspects. It just doesn't 'wow' me, it is well made and has no real flaws, but lacks any complexity to put it above average drinkability for me."
"Overall this is a treat. A very well done American Porter that's worth a shot."
"From a 22 oz. bottle purchased locally. Aroma is malty, almost like a burnt raisin. A little sweet. Pours like black coffee with a creamy tan head. First is the dark caramel raisin flavor followed by some toasty malt and dark chocolate with a little roast in the finish. Some hop character, but subtle in the background. Very balanced and drinkable. Smooth mouthfeel with a fairly dry finish. I really enjoy this beer."
"I poured this big beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer poured a black as night color with a nice head. However the head soos diapreared for good. The lacing hung on great though. The smell was nice and roasted dark coffee smell with a great nuttty taste attached. I really liked this .Buy again for sure."
"Ballast point recently showed up in Colorado and so I picked this up. Black, whoa, shocking. Smells good and like a porter should but what strikes me is the flavor. Robust and strong flavor, almost like a stout, very nice. I may need to buy another to make a final judgment but this was cool."
"Ones enough."
"Drinkability: This is an excellent porter that represents the style perfectly. The combination of spices, maltiness and fruit make this one a sure bet. And at 6.0ABV, this one goes down like a dream."
"Another drinkable beer from B.P. could have had bolder flavors but pretty damn good."
"Notes from 1/14/06"
"A tasty roasty and hoppy porter worthy of a try."
"Nice dark brown/black pour with a cream colored head. Earthy roast malt aromas. Tastes similarly with coffee and mocha tones. Solid medium body. Slight creaminess. Finish a little smokey with nice coffee and hop bitterness. Well balanced and drinkable. One of the best examples of the style I've had in a while."
"Not a bad beer. This one would work well with a beef stew. Another above average offering from a good brewery. Try it if you like porters."
"Smooth and delicious with a nice balance. This is a very good example of an American-style porter."
"D: Tasty especially if you're into the smokier beers, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, it's a good beer to drink for while if you're looking for a smoky porter, but there are some better ones out there."
"d. While it's thick and a bit heavy, I could easily drink a few of these. Smooth, balanced, incredibly palatable, and not too far from perfect. I'm definitely regretting not bringing another bottle back with me. One of the better strong porters I've had, this is definitely worth picking up if you have the opportunity."
"overall, i was disappointed in this beer. i'm not sure what my expectations were, but they were obviously too much. this beer was easy enough to drink, but i wouldn't seek it out."
"Overall: eh, worth a try"
"A very impressive porter from Ballast Point. One of the better one's I've had in a while, at least among porters that were not aged in some sort of wood (like a Jack Daniels barrel for instance)."
"a stand up porter. i had a chance to try the barrel aged down at ballast point and it was great, but it just goes to show you barrel age a great beer and what comes out is magic."
"Overall a fantastic porter that I am lucky enough to have on a hand pump. Another great beer from BP, they keep churning out winners. I would drink this again in a heartbeat, great beer."
"Taste is a very nice balance of coffee with the slightest hint of hops in the end. Malts are very obvious throughout giving a toasted flavor to the brew that is very enjoyable. In the mouth its medium bodied and not as thick as some porters I""ve tried. Nicely carbonated and not chewy or so malt heavy that its a one and done brew. Between the even keel with the flavors and the 6%abv this is a great beer to enjoy several of with or without a meal."
"I had this beer on cask a few days ago, it took over for Stoudts Oatmeal Stout at the bar. I liked its appearance, nice and black, but its flavor was a bit too hoppy still, rather overpowering some of the roasty flavor I like in a good porter, like say, Fuller's for example. All in all a nice representation of the style, and it gets points for being on cask which I love.."
"Overall, Black Marlin Porter is a very enjoyable beer. It is one of the better American Porters that I have tried. Recommended."
"Ballast Point brewed a really nice Porter here. It's a very approachable, drinkable beer. Easily among the top Porters out there. It is straight forward and lacks subtle nuances, but is very well put together. Certainly recommended."
"A pretty good porter, maybe bordering on a stout. It's rather complex, and enjoyable. Recommended."
"Pours a three finger beige head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Black as midnight, no highlights. Light-medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Coffee nose. Flavor is sweet roasted coffee/chocolate with almost burnt coffee finish, nice porter. $5.25 for a 22oz bottle from Yankee Spirits South Attleboro, Ma."
"Body just shy of medium with an average mouthfeel and good drinkability. A good session-style porter."
"Decent Porter from Ballast Point that is fairly robust with a good drinkability. I'd check out another bottle of this sometime down the line."
"Into an imperial pint, pours a pretty solid black, nice inch thick light tan head, a bit of falling, bubbly lacing. The aroma is full of roasted malt and chocolates, some coffee as it warms. Same thing in the taste, nicely roasted malts, chocolates, coffee, toffee, some caramels, quite nice. The body is also pretty good, nice body and carbonation, pretty smooth. Everything here adds up to a very easy to drink, highly enjoyable porter."
"Out of a birthday bomber from my girlfriend, (thanks cupcake!) this brew poured into my glass a deep black with some garnet highlights. Foamy, thick cap of one finger tan head formed and displayed decent lacing. Good retention, got a little rocky after a hot minute. Aromas were of lightly of chocolate, hints of charcoal. Not as deep as the brew suggests. Classic flavors of dark chocolate giving it a semi- sweet character that becomes more pronounced as it warms. Roasted malts, barley, charcoal notes again, really coats the tongue. Syrupy finish. Hops come punching in after, especially with the warmth. Moderate carbonation. Smooth and filling, good mouthfeel and apropos for the style. Good example of the style (and a competitive one!) from the city that produces Sierra Nevada Porter. Score."
"D - Solid porter from Ballast Point. However, I enjoy their hoppy brews a little more. Still, this is a nice porter that is quite drinkable despite a nose that is fairly lacking."
"One of the best porters I have had in a long time."
"Pours a dark brown color with a frothy, light brown head that retains pretty well. Smells of roastiness, milk chocolate, lactose, vanilla. Reminds me of the Robust Porter from Smuttynose which I absolutely love. Taste is more roastiness, lactose, some vanilla notes, hop spice, very tasty. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, slightly dry finish. Great porter and extremely drinkable. Proust."
"Drinkability: Although this isn't classic, I do like the flavor profile the hops bring to the table"
"Almost black with a little root beer color around the edges under light. Tan head that pillows up well, but does not stand for long. Medium aroma of roast and cocoa. Burnt flavors of coffee and chocolate, medium body and a slightly acrid, hoppy finish. At first I did not care much for this beer, but letting it warm up considerably has improved every aspect of its character."
"Cracked open this 22 oz bottle last night because it's been in the fridge too long and needs to be polished off. Once into the pint glasses, you can see it has a beautiful dark brown color to it. Pretty generous sized head that had some staying power. Faint smell was of chocolate. First sip surprised me. This was the first time I had tried anything from this brewery, and this porter was excellent. Lots of flavors of roasted barley, coca beans, and coffee were present. Nice mouthfeel to it, thick enough to be a porter but it was smooth enough to be very drinkable. This beer is a very nice find if you enjoy porters, and I will actively search out more styles from this brewery."
"Drinkability: A solid and highly drinkable porter. Not much risk is taken here, but they set out to make a solid brew, or so it seems, and they've succeeded."
"D - This is a good porter. Yet another solid offering from Ballast Point."
"From a 22 oz bottle this poured a creamy black with a long-lasting tan head and moderate lacing rings. Nose of roasted malts with coffee, chocolate, ripe fruit, and a hint of hops. Mouthfeel medium and very smooth. Flavor is of roasted malts, but three is dry and slightly bitter finish. Very easy to drink and overall an excellent porter."
"D: Easing drinking beer. Interestingly enough...it is better while cold (don't usually run into that)."
"Pours nearly black, with some reddish/brown highlights, small tan head fades quickly, but leaves a nice coating on top of the beer. Great smelling porter. Really rich, dark chocolate smell, roasted malty aroma, and a faint hoppy background. It's tasty...a bit of coffee grounds, some bitter chocolate. Pretty active carbonation, but it seems just right for the style. Creamy, but with some dryness at the finish. This seems like a pretty textbook American Porter, very drinkable, and I'd buy this again in a heartbeat."
"M + D: Light on the carbonation, a decent sized body - not too thin. A touch of chewiness to it and a nod towards trying to finish dry, but perhaps falling just short. While it may not have knocked me off my feet, I find this to be a particularly nice porter, and could see myself having this around from time to time."
"I like it"
"medium light body. the flavors here are very mild. there's nothing wrong with them, but there's nothing significant about them either. very plain and boring. could be thicker, creamier, sweeter, anything. not good not bad, 2.5, middle of the road flavor. not worth the $6 for it, try something else."
"A very good porter, enjoyed at Mondial 2008. Chocolate stouty aroma. Dark, with some lace. Creamy mouthfeel,smartly hopped,a tasty citrus undercurrent of flavour, smooth drinking with coffee and gentle woodiness, gentle carbonation.I wish I could have this again right now back home."
"I really liked the beer and would drink a few more,as soon as I try the rest of the world's stouts and porters. Something I would recommend and enjoyed especially because the brewery is local!"
"I enjoyed this quite a bit. Probably more than my scores would lead you to believe. It's not a bad thing to an above average porter. WHich I think this is."
"Relatively sweet for a porter. The body is thinner than most. Beyond that, this has some very nice (and complex) flavors: toffee, mocha, vanilla, light hazelnut, and enough hop to give a touch of bitterness."
"Not a lot of hops, just enough to balance the sweetness. Dry malt finish with more chocolate. A solid porter. Nothing that blows you away, but very drinkable."
"Black Marlin poured a beautiful dark chocolate black with some bright ruby red highlights along the side. The head of foam was tan in color and close to being 1/2 inch in height. This tan head of foam quickly dissipated into a handful of tan rings and one spot of tan lace around the glass. I thought the color of this beer was just great! The aroma was lightly sour with bitter dark chocolate, roasted malts, a pinch of roasted hops, and a dark fruit hiding in the background. The taste was also lightly sour, but it wasn't a beer gone bad sour. It was one of those good sour tastes. Anyway, the taste was lightly sour with bitter dark chocolate, dry and dark roasted malts, a splash of caramel, a pinch of roasted coffee, and some roasted hops at the finish. If any one of those flavors stood out, it would have to be the chocolate. The chocolate ruled this taste. The mouthfeel was medium to full bodied with a nice dark and lightly bitter aftertaste of dark chocolate, roasted malts, and a hint of roasted hops. As you can tell I enjoyed this Porter very much and wouldn't mind having another one of these. In the end, it's just a great roasted chocolately Porter."
"D: This is a good session porter, flavorful with a moderate abv that keeps the tastebuds buzzing."
"D: A quite good porter beer from San Diego, nothing makes me go crazy, but a tasty, relatively inexpensive session beer."
"D - Very easy drinking beer. I really liked it, but really nothing spectacular."
"Drinks easy, but doesn't quite pull itself together as a session porter, flavor just weren't strong enough for me. A decent, not great porter, my least favorite beer from Ballast Point"
"Pours a dark cola with a big two finger khaki colored head that dies down to a frothy layer. Thin foamy walls stick to the sides of the glass. Smokey caramel malt, charred oak, and sweet toffee up front in the nose. There's also a light floral hop aroma as well. A faint scent of alcohol can be detected in the smell too. Bitter french roast coffee ice cream flavor at first with a smoked wood flavor towards the end. Lemongrass and hops linger throughout on the tongue, very interesting. Dry birch aftertaste with a hint of cocoa and brown sugar. Nice medium body with a smooth texture. Pretty solid carbonation that tingles all the way down. Very enjoyable mouthfeel for a porter. Not being a fan of porters, this beer really surpised me. The Kansas vs. Memphis game just started, I'll be asleep by halftime."
"Drinkability: Great drinkability! Very clean, smooth, and easy to drink. A great Porter from Ballast Point."
"Drinkability - I sucked down every gulp I could out of this bottle. This was incredibly smooth and balanced."
"22 ounce bomber, w/o freshness indication, but the label does give food pairing tips """a great companion to assertive foods"" nice...pours dark dark mahogany, near black, under a nice creamy dark tan head. Also leaves plentiful fine lace. Great looking stuff. Nose is softly of mild chocolate and some dark malt. More chocolate notes, plentiful dark malt, and moderate hop bit comes in late. Rich, creamy, chocolate milk shakeyness. Nice. Great to see brews from BP on the east coast. The more SD, Ca. brewers that distribute to my neck of the woods the better."
"Black pour, medium sized tan nicely lasting head. Smell is rich, highly and well roasted without smelling burnt. Taste is rich, nice body, coffee, rich dark roast. Damn good porter. Perfect balance of sweet/bitter/roastiness, leaving a lasting pleasant roast finish. Hard to beat this porter in my opinion, and well worth getting. This really, really hit the spot."
"Pours a clear cola brown/red, thin tan head forms, leaves a thin layer, and some spotty lacing on the glass. Smell is very fruity, toffee, cola, bit of roast, chemicals, a bit astringent, kind of strange. Taste is similar, very fruity, caramel, chocolate roast, oats and bread in the middle, cola, light spiciness, weird chemical kind of flavour I can't place. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, feels a bit thin on the palate. Not bad, but had a weird fruity/chemical thing going on that I wasn't a big fan of. Thanks for sharing Russ!"
"Tastes much thicker than your average Porter, with quick a bit of burnt flavor. Not as malty as I might have expected from a brew this dark, instead tasting almost dusty. Really a unique brew. I like it quite a bit."
"drinkability is good. it hides its alcohol quite well. a nice porter, but it just doesn't wow me."
"(and having it on-tap again 3 years later, I stand by my original score. Wonderful dark nectar this remains.)"
"Very easy to drink, subtle yet mildly complex, very easy to drink, great example of the style."
"D: Great example of a porter all around."
"D: This is a fine beer, and I would have another. Will buy more as it is a solid porter. One or two at a time would be enough before moving on for something else."
"I was impressed by the depth of flavor and aroma here, but mouthfeel seemed almost watery, seriously detracting from the experience. The aroma at first reminded me of Rogue's Chocolate Stout, with its super-smooth cocoa aroma. But then I also pulled some black licorice and black roasted grains. The taste focuses in more on the seemingly burnt grains, with a slight ash and charcoal taste. Then, like I said, a plain, water-like feel came in the middle of the flavors and made me feel like I was drinking a much lighter beer. Alas."
"D: Delicious, with not too much alcohol! More please!"
"On the pour from the 22 ounce bottle, a black walnut brown tinged with ruby red highlights, the head a large tan creamy delight that very slowly gives way, the lacing a tight skirt to surround the glass. Nose is rich in toasted grain, caramel, hints of coffee and chocolate, simply made my mouth water, start is rich in malt, the toasted grain gives it a pleasant bite, top is moderate to almost full in feel. Finish is benign in its acidity, the hops perfection in their spiciness, sweet toasted malt, coffee and chocolate to the very end, dry, and simply a great beer from a top ten brewery in my books."
"Not the best Ballast Point brew I've tried (that would be the Dorado DIPA), but my favorite."
"Taste follows the nose a bit in the Chocolate, coffee and toffee - all very present. HAs a cola-like fizz on the tongue and a slight sweet and slightly sour creep of flavor up the tongue. Rounds out from dry to very dry with a slight bitterness. Seems a hair thin but not too thin at all - probably just makes it more drinkable."
"Pours a dark brown color, nice carbonation, a little fizzy tannish head appears, not much sticky lacing at all. The nose is malty, some chocolate, toffee, and lots of caramel. The taste is malty, good dose of chocolate/toffee/caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice little porter, might buy it again, we'll see."
"Almost opaque. Thin light beige head. Lacing is minimal. Nice nose of dark roasted malts, char, coffee and caramel. Agreeable flavor with the nice chocolate/burnt malt/coffee thing going on. A nice little ying-yang deal of sweet vs bitter going on. On one side, you've got the sweet caramel malt back bone and some carmelized sugar traits. On the other hand are the intriguing bitter char notes and coffee bean. Overall a nice blend of flavors. The body of this beer hovers around medium and the carbonation is appropriately on the low side. Ballast Point in Minnesota?? I'll take it."
"Mouthfeel is sthin. Tails out towards the end. Nice level of carbonation. Roasted malt and coffee bean notes. Not as robust as it could be, though it hints it could be something more. Slight infusion of milk chocolate. Coffee notes stay on the palate into the finish. Slight leafy bitterness. A very drinkable porter although not one that I'd go running after. Middle of the road."
"Pours into a pint glass a rubied obsidian with a thick and moderately lasting brown head. Well above average appearance. Great aroma. Pungent, consisting mostly of bitter chocolate and citrus hops. Coffee too. It is exactly what I look for in a good porter. Taste is quite nice as well, with the exception of a mild booziness that becomes prominent as the beer warms. Other than that, this beer is just fine. Flavor includes tons of chocolate, hints of coffee, and perhaps just a pinch of vanilla. The roasted dark malt character is deep, pervasive, and unyielding in its intensity. Mouthfeel and texture are very nice. This is a full but not filling beer. It is slick, balanced, and light enough on the carbonation to give it some creaminess. Hopping is well done to create a dry, moderately bitter finish. Very nice. One of the best example of the style Ive had in some time."
"Good overall drinkability too. I really wanted something easy to drink tonight that was a bit roasty and this fits the bill well. Just a good, solid beer in all the categories."
"Pours a very dark brown-almost black with quickly disapearing head with a hit of hops. Tatse reminds me of a good bitter chocolate bar but with a slight hop bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is what I expect in a robust porter-not heavy but not thin either. Drinkability is high as this beer is one that I could have in over aboundance during one our many foggy nights"
"Beer poured a deep brown with mahogany undertones. Head was tan but has dissapated quickly leaving some lacing behind. Nose is malty and chocolately, very nice. Taste is of roasted malts accented by chocolate balanced by a nice bittering hop finish. The flavors get more pronounced the more it warms. Mouthfeel is delectably smooth and creamy, which makes the beer for me. Overall drinkability is good. This is the first Ballast Point beer I have tried and I will be seeking this and their other offerings out in the future!"
"D: Man, pretty boring porter. Bummer because I love Ballast Point."
"Pours a dark brown/black, with a thin head. The aroma is malty, but not overpowering. The taste is sweet at first, turning into a slightly dirty after taste as it finishes. The mouthfeel is a little watery. It is a beer that is easy to drink, but not to complex and therefore not all that interesting, still overall a good beer, and worth trying."
"My only gripe is that it has too much caramel and black patent, which creates an almost buttery sweetness up front, followed by a dry ashy mouthfeel. The body is fairly full for a porter as well. Has only a hint of alcohol flavor, even despite being a drinkable 6%. Overall, it is a very good robust porter. Thanks again to spazaru for convincing me not to give up on this brewery. I will most likely drink it again."
"Drinkability? Oh yeah. This is a nice and drinkable Porter. I enjoyed it more and more as I got to the bottom of the glass. My second beer from Ballast Point, and I am not disappointed. Good stuff."
"Although the Big Eye IPA is a beer to behold, this porter seemed pale in comparison (pun intended). Nothing bad or offensive, but merely an average porter, with below average carbonation, and a sticky sweet mouthfeel. The roasted aromas are all there, as are the thick malts, with an emphasis on the carmel malts. Reminds me of a porter home brewed from an extract kit. Good, definately not great."
"In later tastes I get a creamy milky sweetness buried way beneath the chocolate and roast. Quite nice. Not a complex make-me-think beer but teasing enough to be interesting. Mouthfeel is thick with very mild carbonation. Oily hop bitterness in the ending is grassy and woody dry."
"Mouthfeel is fine, not outstanding, but smooth and easy. Drinkability is quite good, a very easy drinking porter."
"Much thanks to Buckeyenation!"
"Beer is good. Happy porter beering."
"Drinkability: This is probably a porter saved for the summer. The hops do make it interesting, despite being overbearing, as I said above."
"This is among the mildest mannered porters that I have tasted. Very easy to drink I can't thing of anything negative to say about this one. Highly recommended."
"It pours a dark ruby that's not quite black with a big tan head that fades to a ring of lace. The nose has burnt malt, coffee, baker's chocolate. The taste is right in line, with city roast coffee, burnt malts, roasted malts, dark chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate, and a touch of brown sugar and sweet malts. The carbonation was a bit much at first, but I swirled the beer and brought the fizz back to normal. Another good brew from one of Southern Californias most underrated breweries."
"Notes: I've had nice success with this brewer. The porter is pretty average to below average in my opinion. I can deal with a bad mouthfeel if its loaded with taste, but this was kinda boring."
"A tasty brew, here. One that could be drank on any given night. Another feather in Ballast Point's hat, hopefully not the last of their line that winds up in bottles."
"Black Marlin Porter is another wonderful beer from Ballast Point Brewing Company and is one of the best porters that I've had in a good, long while. It doesn't impress by breaking out of the style mold and doing something completely off the charts, but by staying well within the style guidelines and just being flat out more delicious than its competitors. I'd be proud to mount this Marlin above my mantle."
"The taste was a fine melding of roasted malt, toffee and a bitter-sweet taste of the kind dark chocolate imparts. The carbonation wasn't overly done as was perfect for the style. A little chewey and a very ever so slighly dry and smooth on the tongue. This is one of my favorite porters. Since it's been raining here, i'm going to be sipping this by the fireplace."
"That bottle of BMP was not long for this world as I was soon looking at a near-empty glass and wondering just where the hell my beer went so fast. Needless to say, Black Marlin Porter is astonishingly quaffable. A fine porter and worth seeking out."
"Medium body yet very mouthfilling. Also fills the tummy which would make it more of a dessert, than a meal of a beer. I do recommend to Porter drinkers of the Universe...a worthy drop!"
"Some chocolate, nuttiness in the aroma was unexpected. Had a brown ale smell really. Deep black with bubbly mocha head that never really gets organized. Flavor is better than expected from the smell. I expected this to be thin, but it is thick and roasty with a nice burnt finish and ample coffee and chocolate notes. If anything it is thicker than it needs to be for the style. There is still some nuttiness present though, but the flavor is well integrated and complimentary. Nice brew."
"Drinkability: It's boring, lacks flavor and tastes more like soda than beer. You add it up."
"Nice medium body feel. Very clean, quick, and has an easy carbonation thats got some light roasty texture behind its main silky play. Its boldness could be notched up to meet up with the flavor level by a bit. Then we'd have one fine dandy porter. Even so, this is remarkably easy to drink, straight up tasty, and a pretty solid porter all around. Good stuff."
"Rarely seen BUT Highly Recommended."
"A great beer all across the board. My friend highly recommended this one to me and said it had been around for awhile but was just now being bottled. The pour was nice and the beer was near pitch black with a good size brownish head. The smells were nice and burnt with a touch of hops in the scent. The taste was excelent and very drinkable with a very dry chocolaty flavor and nicley carbonated mouthfeel. My only challange now is to find more of this stuff!"
"22 oz. brown bomber with no apparent best before date."
"Overall: this is an excellent quaffing porter. Would be great for newbies."
"Comments  I had this over at AleOhas Derby party. What a great time, with great friends, and of course lots of great beer."
"This porter poured a very dark brown (almost black) color with thin, white foam. The smell was sweet and malty with a hint of cocoa. The taste was malty and mildly sweet with a strong coffee flavor and a hint of cocoa, and a slight bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium body and low carbonation. There was a lingering mild coffee taste. This was a nice, enjoyable porter."
"This dark full-bodied brew presents with a bready malt aroma.  The roasted and patent malts balance off a strong, yet very effective hop presence.  This is a nicely built porter that goes down smooth and give a little kick on its way down"
