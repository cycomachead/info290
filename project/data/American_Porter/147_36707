Nice lingering peppery spicing lasts awhile, is easy drinking, very enjoyable with a good smoked nature, hopping and balance.","beerthulhu","Mar 12, 2015"

Tastes is typical of a porter but very much light bodied and the pepper is subdued with just the slightest of burn at the end. You can taste the smokiness and the pepper but it is very easy on the mouth. Not a lot of body and a bit watery. Overall an ok beer that you could drink easily.","Richardbeerlover","Aug 05, 2014"

Aromas of subtle smoke, chocolate, coffee, and a subtle pepper spice. The nose is fairly light compared to what I was preparing for, I guess. Flavors are more pepper forward, with spice and a subtle heat, followed by chocolate and mocha notes, subtle roasted bitterness, and a subtle creamy highlight, as well. The chipotle flavors are a nice twist on the base beer. The beer is light and smooth in mouth, has a steady flow of carbonation throughout, and leaves a very decent lacing along the glass as you drink. Chipotle and chocolate aftertaste, with a building heat as you go. The finish is smooth and slightly dry, and that pepper heat continues to linger. Solid brew.","GarthDanielson","Jun 12, 2014"

The smell of the beer was quite smoky, and smelled like really dark roasted coffee mixed with caramel flavor. There wasn't much chipotle pepper in the smell, but the flavor was right up front in the taste. It was a lot spicier than I was expecting, and the flavor of peppers was all over my tongue immediately. It was backed by semi sweet chocolate with hints of almond. The pepper never relented throughout the taste and lingered on in the finish. The beer felt thinner onn the palette than was the norm for the style, but when your tongue is on fire from the chili pepper, who cares. I love the peppery boldness of this brew.","rajendra82","Jun 06, 2014"

The taste is the spicy chipotle peppers upfront as well as some charcoal and smoke. Some peat as well. Finishes with the heat of the peppers and nice mellow spicy aftertaste. Hints of dark chocolate as the beer warms. Light mouthfeel with alot of carbonation. Just like the Vanilla Bean one it is a nice variation but the original Stone Smoked Porter is still the best to me. Still this is a good Porter that isn't overly spicy or hot. Overall, worth trying at least once.","PicoPapa","May 29, 2014"

I don't mind the level of heat, but I wish Stone would tone back on it to focus a bit more on some roasted characteristics or something along those lines -- maybe a chocolate sort of flavor. Like I said, I can definitely get the similarities of this beer with Vanilla Bean Smoked Porter with the beer's base, but I guess the chipotle just doesn't add as much to the base as the vanilla bean did for me.","Alextricity","May 01, 2014"

The aroma is great--wonderful maltiness, with a light smokiness, and a sharp scent of chiles. Taste mirrors this. There's a good black patent malt flavor, but it doesn't dominate, and lets the smoky flavor come through well--a nice subtle smokiness I should add. The phenols are not overpowering. The chipotle taste is more apparent in the aroma than to taste, but there's still there if you look--especially at the finish. The body is a little thin and watery, the only downside to this beer. Otherwise, very drinkable.","allengarvin","Nov 15, 2013"

In terms of what makes this a porter though, I basically just get the smokiness. Not as much of the robust, rounded sweetness that comes with a typical porter- I'm thinking of flavours such as dark fruits, caramel, coffee, chocolate. It's dominated by the chipotle pepper which is the point of the beer. It doesn't overshadow the relative lack of porter characteristics in my opinion. But the fact remains that the flavour profile is different and I won't begrudge it for that. (4)","Stevedore","Mar 10, 2013"

3.97,5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Stone's chipotle treated Smoked Porter pours jet black. A finger's worth of caramel colored foam finishes of the look. Head retention is just alright, but the beer leaves a respectable amount of lacing behind. The nose has aromas not-too-sweet dark chocolate, light smoke, and a decent bit of chipotle pepper. The flavor profile leads off with a lightly roasty, bittersweet dark chocolate taste from the base beer. The peppers come in next, filling in the space usually taken up in a beer by the hops. The heat provides a very nice balance to the beer's maltiness. It also transitions nicely into a faintly smoky finish. The body is nice, a little bit full but not as chewy as I might find from a more straight ahead, 100% malt driven beer. The carbonation is nice and subdued. I'm pleasantly surprised at how much I found myself enjoying Stone Smoked Porter w/ Chipotle. I expected to enjoy the vanilla bean variant more, but that's far from the case. Then again, I've also enjoyed the other pepper beers I've had from Stone, so I guess I can just add this one to the list.","axeman9182","Dec 04, 2012"

Pours crystal clear very dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger dense khaki head with excellent retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing rings cling down the glass. Aromas of chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, toffee, smoke, chipotle pepper, light coffee, and light herbal hops. Damn nice aromas with great balance and strength. Taste of chocolate, caramel, smoke, roasted malt, chipotle pepper, coffee, toffee, citrus, and herbal hops. Light amount of citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, chipotle pepper, light coffee, citrus, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance of classic porter flavor with the chipotle peppers; the heat does start to build up in the back as you drink, but it just fine with me. No cloying flavors on the palate at all after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed on the finish, unless the peppers are masking it. Overall this is a highly excellent porter! Fantastic flavor balance with the special ingredient; very smooth to drink despite the pepper heat build up. Highly enjoyable offering; I hope it makes a comeback around here sometime.","superspak","Oct 25, 2012"

Nose expresses smoke and chile peppers with a slightly sweet character that manifests between the smoke and spice. Taste follows nose; however, the flavor profile is a bit more watered down than implied by the nose - the smoke and chiles intermingle nicely without overshadowing one another. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with an easy, even carbonation. There's a little residual heat in the mouth and at the back of the tongue if the brew is given the opportunity to linger and warm. An interesting interplay of smoke and spice; however, I still enjoy the original offering to the variants.

4.2,11.1,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours a black tea brown with garnet highlights and a 1 inch cap of dense light tan foam that stuck around for a few minutes before leaving a sticky coating of lacing around the glass. Greets your senses with a firm dose of smoky, spicy pepper. The base beer is clearly noticeable too with that unmistakable peat smoke riding just ahead of a bitter chocolate and dark roast malt. Carbonation is fairly modest providing a near creamy mouthfeel that combines with the smoky, roasty, vegetal flavors to suggest a great pairing with bbq'd meats. You might expect a dose of spice from the chipotle peppers but I think this is coming through more as a slight warming/tingle on the palette. I'll be seeking out the Vanilla Bean version soon for fair comparison but a beer this good will be hard to top.","BrewerB","Aug 10, 2012"

Scent is very similar to the regular smoked porter...peat-like smoke with some lovely roasted malt and chocolate. A little bit of coffee and mild chipotle aroma. Taste is...mmm yummy. At first I get roasted malt with chipotle. Very slowly and steadily it transforms into smokey, chocolatey, with a little bit of heat on the tip of the tongue and in the back of the throat. Lovely mix of toasted malt, smoke, heat, pepper flavor, and chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy. Drinkability is very high.

It's been a looong time since I've had the base beer, but it really does shine through here. Smoky, robustly roasty with the smoke and roast forming a bit of a continuum while managing to bypass being ashy, this is really nice. The chipotle manages to find its own niche and adds an enjoyable accent to the beer. Mildly fleshy, very mildly spicy and a moderate smoke character from the peppers are present. The cocoa and chocolate come through right before the finish, lending a mild sweetness. Drying, roasty and delicately smoky and spicy on the finish, this beer is medium-light in body, moderately carbonated and rather excellent on the palate.

This brew almost smells as though your nose is placed over a grill as chipotle peppers are roasting without the heat. Opens with pleasant smokiness jointed by accents of chipotle pepper, smoky,roasted malt with a touch of sweetness joins in and then the finish is smooth and silky. Just a bit of mild heat lingers on the tongue courtesy of the chipotle. Medium-bodied, with a slick, silky mouthfeel. This brew is a dream pairing with barbecue, and I can't wait to try it with grilled fajitas. Possibly one of the best American-brewed smoked beers available and a great example using an added ingredient to highlight aspects of the base beer. The added chipotle is incredibly successful in highlighting the base smoked porter. A marriage made in heaven, indeed!","chanokokoro","Jul 07, 2012"

This just happens to be in one of my standby favorites from Stone. The nose has those classic dark malt characteristics dark chocolate, roasted malts that hint at coffee, with a hidden layer of mild smoke. In addition in this one we get the earthy smoked jalapeno pepper character. The flavor rides on a current of dark chocolate like roasted malts and finishes on the dry classic powdered chipotle flavors found in the earthiness of roasted jalapeno peppers. I find it to be a dry excellent version of a classic stout, the bottle wants me to decide on Vanilla or Chipotle peppers I want both in bottles. Variety is the spice of life. Just enough heat in the back end this beer will probably cure a cold, not that it has medicinal qualities but the peppers are so well infused it's hard to pick them out individually. Classic smoked pepper beer with enough heat to let you know what your dealing with but doesn't ruin the palate with each sip.

3.63,-4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"D - This really sounds like a good idea, the dark character of porter and the moderate level of smoke in Stone's version should work perfectly with chipotle, but somehow it doesn't come together as well as I expected it would. The chili character is relatively subdued and it doesn't have a lot of impact on the base beer. It may increase the perception of smoke a bit, but aside from that it does very little until it shows up in the finish.

Previously, I have tried the smoked porter and have found it a bit on the heavy handed side, too much smoke, not enough roasted malt. All this changed tonight with the Chipotle Smoked Porter on cask. First, the smokiness was dialed back considerably. Appearance was what was you'd expected in a porter. Dark, opaque, the head retention was a bit lacking. Aroma was also in line with the style. Roasted malt and mild dried fruit. The flavor was spot on with a chocolate malt roast to start and complexity from the chipotle peppers giving it a slightly smokey, somewhat leathery quality. Particularly interesting was the mild back end burn. Medium body and very soft mouthfeel. A nice twist on a porter.","LittleDon","May 26, 2011"

3.55,-6.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours near black with almost.no head or lacing. Nose brings forward a pretty good amount of chipotle alongside some roasted malt and hints of coffee. Smoke in the background. Taste brings the peppers forward while the smoke and roast characteristics remain in the background. Good feel--I like he heat on this. Drinkability is okay given the distinctiveness of some of the flavors.","Thorpe429","Oct 05, 2010"
3.88,2.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The chipotle sneaks up on you in the this beer. Its definitely not a chili forward beer at all. Its just a really nice background of the chipotle and then it drops off and gives way to the roast / smoke of the base beer. A very good use of chilis in a beer.","drabmuh","Oct 05, 2010"
4.12,9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"The pepper is kicked down a notch in the flavor, and the smoke is kicked up a bit. I liked the balance it had in the aroma a bit more than the flavor, but it is still delicious.

4.73,25.1,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Picked up a growler of this and almost immediately felt the need to bust it open. Pours a beautiful black with with a little dark brown head that fades. Smelled of chocolate, chipotle, and barley. I thought it had an incredible taste a near perfect balance of ingredients with enough of a kick from the peppers to keep the taste-buds happy. It's def not the thickest porter but still has a good medium body to it. Ultimately I would put this on par with bootlegger's Black Phoenix, which was also exceptional.","tbase","Sep 17, 2010"

3.32,-12.2,5,3,3,4,3.5,"Was a bit let down by this one. Out of draft that chipotle is super present and is what makes this beer fun to have. The cask, or at least the cask I had killed the chipotle flavor almost all together.","pastradul","Jun 08, 2010"
4.57,20.9,4,4.5,5,4.5,4,"D: drank amazingly good for a spicy smoked porter. It is the best spicey smoked beer I've had so far. I will seek this beer out every time they brew it. I know it pretty limited and brewed once a year I think. I hope they bottle it one day.","Gobzilla","May 30, 2010"
3.7,-2.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Taste/Mouthfeel: Taste has all the makings of dark roasted malt/caramel giving way to those chipotle peppers.

4.38,15.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability- Nice beer that I enjoyed quite a bit. Like I said earlier I love Chili brews but I have to sort of have the right mindset.

3.8,0.5,4,4,4,4,3,"Had this at Pazzo's in Lexington. Pours a dark brown/black color with an off-white head that hangs around for quite a while. The aroma doesn't have a lot of the spicy chipotle in it, it's mostly roasted and chocolate malt with a touch of smokiness. Smells good. The chipotle comes through big time in the flavor. It's quite spicy in the back of the throat and on the tongue. The background has a nice roast and chocolate malt character and there is a moderate amount of smokiness to it as well. But the chipotles take the main stage and give off quite a bit of heat. I got a pint of this and wished I had the opportunity to have a half-pint. The body is fairly thick, but I had some trouble with the drinkability due to the heat.","clvand0","Sep 15, 2009"
3.99,5.6,3.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"D - I was a little skeptical initially, but this one really won me over. The peppers provide zest, spice, and some heat, but its not overpowering. Even so, I'm not sure if I would make this a session brew. Another interesting beer from such an imaginative brewery.","BostonBrewins","Aug 18, 2009"

4.2,11.1,4,4,4.5,5,3.5,"I am really happy I had a chance to try such a rare treat from Stone. Steve Wagner was at the dinner and said that every batch is different since they use peppers from their garden and we definitely got a hotter batch. I am glad we did :)","GatorBeerNerd","May 14, 2009"
3.78,0,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Opaque as the standard smoked porter made by Stone, good lacing was left on the glass as the beer was consumed. Semi-sweet chocolate aroma, a pinch of peppers. The flavor has two stages to it. The first part is sweet like chocolate and molasses, the second part is created when the chipotle peppers kick in to add a zesty kick of sizzle. A unique creation by Stone, matched well with the BBQ Fondue I had.","DoubleJ","Oct 17, 2008"
3.03,-19.8,4,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,"I am not even going to break this one down, as I had this on cask and even the bartender said that something had gone crazy (not necessarily in a good way) with this particular one. It was over carbonated and had an insane amount of pepper in it. After a couple of sips and finally a good gulp, the back of my throuat was sizzling like the urban legend of the kid who ate pop rocks and coke. They vouched that a previous keg was not so peppery, but I don't think that I would care for this combination any ways. I had the brandy barrel aged version of ths smoked porter and that sweetness with the smoke is a much more logical combination to me.","opwog","Aug 09, 2008"
3.75,-0.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"D- A very interesting beer. I think this thing would go great with spicy food, especially for someone that likes the heat. Not exactly a session beer unless you enjoy peppers. I found it very interesting.","gpogo","Jul 22, 2008"

Nonetheless I found the beer quite smooth and refreshing with superior mouthfeel and drinkability.","HalfFull","May 09, 2008"

3.7,-2.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Stone, the next time you make this you need to put in a lot more chipotlÃ© peppers, this could work really well if properly spiced. I have added Â½ a dried chipotlÃ© at bottling time to each 22oz bottle of smoked porter and that is definitely way too much, but something like a ratio of 1/16th to 1/8th of a chipotle per 22oz bottle would probably be nicely spicy. In the end, I did notice, if you drink a lot more other beers, you can finally taste the chipotle flavors and not unconsciously think that you got ripped off by the Stone guys ;-)","Gueuzedude","Jun 13, 2007"

This beer was good but I wanted to go toe to toe with a Stone Chipotle beer. The chipotle was too light and was completely lost within the sausages I had for dinner.","Westsidethreat","May 06, 2007"
