Good roast taste, nothing burnt.  Robust, smooth but with a slight edge to it.  Medium mouthfeel, slightly chewy.  Perfect carbonation, light hop bitter for balance and a touch of herbal at the swallow.","utopiajane","Friday at 05:09 AM"

Still, there was an emphasis on robust and compared to many Southern Tier dark beers that I've had which are malt bombs, this is at the other end of the spectrum. Definitely a bitter brew, and perhaps a bit lopsided towards bitterness rather than ""robust"" as described on the label. It got better as it warmed up, but only so much. I may try again with a newer bottle and see if it gets more balanced or any better.","damndirtyape","Jul 04, 2014"

For a porter the smell and the mouthfeel were great, but it just seemed pretty ordinary and not very memorable. In this day and age with so many different breweries sprouting up everywhere, an ok beer from a great brewery doesnt quite cut it-for me anyway. I will never buy this again. However, if I am at a restaurant and it's the only craft, I would get it. But that's not saying much.","mitch3114","Oct 03, 2013"

Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, toffee, coffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, floral, and toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, toffee, light coffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, and toasted earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, toffee, light coffee, biscuit, and light nuttiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt notes; with a good sweet/roast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice porter style. All around good balance and robustness of flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 30, 2013"

The taste is where things get a little weird. I'm not sure if it's an over-roast flavor or some sort of coffee addition that adds a touch of acidity that is rather distracting during the sip. After that passes, it's pretty solid porter territory, with a nice strong roast through the finish. The mouthfeel is thin and a bit too highly carbonated, and the drinkability is solid.

3.75,2.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Thanks to EgadBananas for providing this bottle. Poured into a pint glass. Pours dark brown with a quickly dissipating tan head. The beer appears clear ruby red near the edge of the glass. A little bit of lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. Chocolate, coffee, and malt dominate the aroma. It's mildly sweet smelling. There are flavors of bitter chocolate, coffee, and sweet malt. There are some hops, but this is not a strong flavor. The body is light to medium with some carbonation. The finish is dry. The drinkability is high. Overall, this is a very good beer. While not the best porter I ever had, this is certainly recommended.","acevenom","Jun 03, 2012"

Immaculate and unblemished black liquid, the rims form a broad orange circle with yellow at the furthermost parts, transparent thereabouts. The nose presents an attractive spine of hops, herbal matter and pressed flowers before yielding the floor to café au lait, milk chocolate, scones, orange peel and cola notes, so much roast and toast, maybe an undercurrent of dark fruits, steady presence and without rough patches. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is soft and downy which adds to the smooth, creamy texture, effortlessly fills in every crevice of your palate. Sweet yet not sugary, hard to imagine more malty roast, all chocolate, cocoa, mocha, coffee, nuts and breakfast baked goods. The orange citrus, pine and pinch of pepper add moderate contrast. Plum and black cherry fruit make a swift appearance. There’s not a lot of nuance nor subtlety here but there’s consistency and richness in spades. Waves of it, in fact.","farrago","Apr 16, 2012"

On the palate, the beer is crisp, with light, bitter, roasted coffee and earthy undertones blended together on a thin, crisp body.

The taste on the front gives you that dark chocolate and subtle fruit feel, on the back of your mouth it gives you just a little bit of hops to enjoy. As usual most of the beers that I drink I drink while eating something. I believe that pairing beers, especially craft beers is something that is very fun to do. Southern Tier Brewery only has a soup du jour and a pulled pork sandwich on its menu. I had the pulled pork sandwich with the Porter and found it to balance the sweetness of the bbq sauce as well as the acidity of the coleslaw. I enjoyed it and brought home a 1/6 keg of it for my home.","sniper061","Feb 12, 2012"

It's not a heavy beer, and it's on the sweet side rather than the sharp malt bite of comparable stouts. It'd go better paired with a dessert than any entree. As the beer warms up much more, the body fills out a bit, which is good. The berry notes get juicier and the roast profile broadens. But despite it all, this is a porter that missed the mark for me. It feels like an incomplete beer, or even an attempt at another style that fell short and was saved into a porter.","paperbackfoster","Aug 08, 2011"

I also didn't like the sweetness in this beer which really hurt it's drinkability. There was no hop presence in this beer and I think that really hurt it. This beer needs to be more robust, less sweet, and have some hop presence to it to balance everything out. I don't think I would buy this again since there are many better local porters that are readily available to me and I can't say I would recommend it to anyone either, there was just too much shit that needs to be fixed with this beer.

This needs to warm up significantly before any true characteristics come out, and when they did, it did not jive with me. That fruit comes up, it's light like but there, roast mixed with burnt/char, stale vanilla, nuts, chocolate, no coffee. It's a mixed bag, a muffled bag at that.

Taste is inline with the nose - coffee flavoring first, nice bitterness blending in with chocolate - dark bitter chocolate, roasted malts come through to give a nice toasty flavoring and in the finish - the most surprising, but I detected a bit of fruitiness raspberry or blackberry hit the tongue just in the finish.

The flavor is quite well balanced. It doesn't lean toward coffee or chocolate; it's just dark roasted malt here. The end of the taste gets alkaline.

Very nice. Some floral hops also on the nose, which help balance it out nicely. Sipping reveals a rather light body with a mild carbonation and light roasty malt flavor. A bit of baker's chocolate tasted up front as well and some roasted almonds. This one packs a punch with flavor on the finish really, which is rather odd to me.

I just wish this was a little more forceful in the aroma. The flavor is right on with the flavor. Lots of roasted maltyness, followed by a mild caramel and nuttyness. It finishes with a nice sweet coffee on the finish that really takes this one higher than it would be without it. There is just a mild hint at bitterness on the finish that works really well with the coffee flavors. This is a nice tasting brew. Mouthfeel shows as thick with a light carbonation.

There are ruby highlights at the bottom of the glass. There is a very thin tan head that fades quickly to a film. The nose is full of smooth and soft dark malts, which combine to impart a chocolatey aroma with a nice malt backbone. There are no hops discernible. The taste is very smooth. Chocolate undertones with an almost nutty aspect. Not much of a hop presence. It has a fairly nice malty base going on. The first real misstep is in the finish where there is a noticeable metallic element. Other than that, this is a fairly nice, if a bit simple, porter. The mouthfeel is appropriate.

These hops are much more present in the taste, and it's a less than pleasant experience at first: mostly grassy earthy flavors over a thin-to-medium-bodied chocolate and roasted coffee malt base. Mouthfeel is much waterier than I care for. The aftertaste is the most characteristically ""porter-like"" aspect, revealing the balance of malt and hops that the actual taste doesn't achieve.

This might be by design ,but I dont think it works .Fortunatley whats inside the bottle more than makes up for uninspired branding.The head could have been a little thicker, but ill take the blame for that, with a crumby pour. I like the balance in the mouth, nice toasty hints, some sweetness, yet clean and not overpowering. southern tier does a good job with their beers, and this one is no exception.

Pretty celan, only mild amounts of esters, with heaps of chocolate and blackened malt. The flavor opens with a charred coffee maltiness, quickly overtaken by an assertive citrus, piney hop flavor.

The nose is rich and inviting with wafts of distinct bittersweet chocolate and toffee over more subtle notes of coffee. It's smooth across the palate with a medium-light body and restrained carbonation. The flavor is not as rich as the nose suggests it might be, but the same bittersweet chocolate, toffee, and mocha character remains. A delicate undercurrent of yeasty fruit and a splash of grassy hop flavor add some character; and a solid bitterness backs it leading to a very dry, powdery finish.","NeroFiddled","Jan 23, 2005"

4,9,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a traditional dark brown/black color with a light tan head. The head is gone within seconds of the pour, but the appearance is still strong. The aroma is of roasted barley and chocolate malts. The taste also has the same malt character. It is well balanced and low/med bodied. This is a fine porter. It doesn't stray much from the old standard, but if it isn't broken, don't fix it.","WesWes","Jun 16, 2003"
