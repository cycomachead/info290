"Smooth light flavor, not too distinctive"
"Vanilla not overpowering and very nice feel"
"Too sweet.  Too much vanilla flavoring.   Tastes like a soft drink.  Where's the porter?"

"Pretty consistent with name. Good smell and drinkable."

"Smooth easy drinking beer. I liked it a lot."
"This is one of the best Porters I've ever drank. Highly recommend."

"Very pleasent suprise. A very nice, inexpensive, low ABV porter for when I have people over."

"What a nice beer.  I had one of these for the first time at a bar in Philadelphia.  I loved it right away.  It is everything you love about a porter with the sweetness and creamy flavor of pure vanilla.  I wasn't sure whether I was drinking a beer or having a vanilla float... Which I may try with this beer!  I bet if you added some vanilla ice cream to this beer it would be damn good!  Anyway unless your tongue is dead, you get really strong vanilla flavor and a smooth creamy mouthfeel.  I thought it to be too sweet at first taste, more like a supper or after dinner beer, but three down, and they were still tasting great.  I suggest trying this brew."
"Did not care for this porter."
"Look was good, not too much of a head.  Taste was okay in my opinion.  Middle of the line for me."
""
"Not as stout as I prefer however a real easy drinking beer. I rated it overall a 4.75."
""
""
""
""
"Great beer! Very good taste."
""
"Pretty gross. Too sweet and tastes artificial. Very perfumy flavor."
"Seemed like more of a brown ale than a porter. Dissapointing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely underwhelmed.   I knew going in it would likely be sweet, thin, and maybe a bit chemically, but the aftertaste made this impossible for me to finish.   I'm not going back to this beer again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Too thin.  Awful aftertaste.  Vanilla was too subtle, almost non-existent.  Either a bad bottle or a bad beer."
"I am not a fan of this. Maybe it's because I don't have a sweet tooth but it is just waaay too much vanilla for me."
"Nice flavor porter strong vinalla"
""
""
""
""
""
"Sure, imitation vanilla, but it still manages to be absolutely tasty for the style and ABV. Good training wheels for those who fear dark beer."
""
""
""
"Nice initial taste but a slight artificial after taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The rich vanilla flavor gives this Porter a robust flavor!"
"By itself, just a good porter. A sip of this followed by a sip of a good bourbon is spectacular."
""
""
""
"Bought a 6 pack of this because I'm a fan of Vanilla Porters. The cap just about burst off the top of the 1st 2 bottles I opened and the proceeded to pour as as if I just shook the bottles on the way home. So after dumping them I opened the 3rd only to pour a flat beer, tasted and dumped, opened a 4th only for it to explode open. I then drove them back to the store which iI go to often and traded it for something else! Leinies Snowdrift Vanilla Porter instead!"
"Flavor chill but not strong enough"
""

"One of my favorite beers out there."
""
""
"very good.. get the vanilla when its just above room temp."
""
"Lighter porter than some.  I enjoyed the taste and would drink it agin if offered."
""
"Great dark beer. Only issue I have is I don't taste the vanilla. Tastes more like a brown ale in my opinion. Still a great brew!"
""
""

"Nitro version, silky smooth and nice!"
"Great beer. Love vanilla and love porters"
""

"This beer was recently recommended by a good friend. I'd tried and liked other Breckenridge beers before but not this one.  An excellent vanilla porter."
""
"I can really taste the vanilla beans in this one.  This is a nice anght tasty porter"
"Our house beer  Smooth tasty."

"JR - I was expecting more.  Vanilla was very subtle"
"Overall, I was somewhat disappointed in this; worth trying, maybe even a second time, but at this point, I wouldn't recommend beyond that."
"Overall:  This is one of my favorite porters.  It’s got a great balance of roasted malt, brown sugar-like sweetness, subtle hops and vanilla.  Very quaffable and delicious!"
"Very light and delicate.  I wanted more taste.  The head retention was pretty decent.  Had it on tap in a pint glass.  Drank some cold then let it warm up and kept drinking.  Was decent beer with a burger since it was so light.  On the fence whether i will have another."
"A good beer and recommend trying if you can on nitro !  I wouldn't seek it out in bottles though.."
""
""
"Nice looking, not much lacing. A metallic aroma that has me imagining a similar metallic taste. Surprisingly, this tastes much better than it smells, malty with a slight sweetness on the back end. Creamy with medium body and slight carbonation. Overall, I really like as long as I don't associate the aroma with the taste."
""
"Strange cardboard aftertaste. Not a keeper."
""
""
"        Overall, a 4.25  for Vanilla Porter - Breckenridge Brewery. A smooth and tasty sipper ideal for cold nights in."

"V - Medium."

"Vanilla Porter is brewed by Breckenridge Brewery, with an ABV 4.70% This brew pours out a nice dark color with a nice off white head. It looks like cola.  The smell is rich with sweetness, you pick up on the vanilla in this brew.  You also pick up up on some grains and and malts in this brew. The taste is rich with flavor, you pick up on the vanilla in this brew.Vanilla Porter has a nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering in this brew.  The mouthfeel is nice and clean. I would buy this brew again. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out 5."
""
""
"I do not write reviews."
"It's like drinking your dessert. Had the nitro pour at the Yard House. The head was deliciously thick and creamy, I think partly due to the nitro tap. Toasty malts and biscuits with a nice vanilla aroma, not too heavy on the vanilla. Excellent balance and a clean finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"If it was just a standard Porter it would be boring and forgettable. The vanilla is very nice, smooth not over powering at all. Exactly enough so I can drink this six pack and not be pissed that I bought it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ok - felt it needed more"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've had a few vanilla porters and they've been decent but for some reason this one has a wonderful flavor and feel. The smell is pretty generic but as soon as you get taste it you get wonderful notes of an oat vanilla fullness that you'd not expect. It feels fantastic too. Silky and smooth."
"Overall: very good but not outstanding."
""
""
"It has a nice vanilla ending"
""
""
""
"A sweet and light porter with high drinkability. The initial aftertaste is very strongly of vanilla but it doesn't become an issue unless multiple are drank in a short time frame.  Has a nice light and nutty aroma and feels creamy going down. Very drinkable.."
""
"It is of the sweeter porters, but could have a few before the sweetness over powered the palate."
""
""
""
"Easy drinking porter. Vanilla aroma not overwhelming. More than a couple at a sitting might be too much vanilla. But a nice change to heavy porters"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good thick creamy beer"
""
""
""
"Smooth taste with hints of vanilla that do not over-power the malty taste of your traditional porter. Good beer"

"Poured a deep brown body with red highlights when held to light and a thin ring of head. A decent looking porter, but it could use better head formation. Scents of coffee with cream, bittersweet milk chocolate, moderate levels of roast malt, medium-high notes of vanilla and light caramel and bready malt. Overall impression of aroma is of a wonderful porter base with a very pleasant addition of vanilla. True to style, pleasant and enticing, very well done. Flavor begins lightly sweet with notes of sweetened coffee with cream, milk chocolate, vanilla, light caramel and a light roast malt and black coffee bitterness keeping it balanced. Middle is lightly sweet still with notes of vanilla, coffee with cream, light caramel and bready malt. Finish is medium-dry with notes of dark coffee with cream, vanilla, roast malt, dark chocolate and a very light touch of caramel very far in the background. Aftertaste is roast malt, black coffee and vanilla. Overall impression of flavor is of a very good porter base enhanced by the addition of vanilla. Roasty, rich and full of flavor. Very nice. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation and a smooth feel with a light prickle. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a very good porter, true to form and pleasing to drink. Overall this is an excellent porter. The vanilla aids the aroma and flavor of a solid base beer and makes this one a good one. Very highly recommended."

"Pretty bitter. Vanilla is very subtle and buried in the bitterness. Not bad, but not as distinctive as I hoped it would be."
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 7/6/2014. Pours crystal clear deep reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, vanilla, toasted bread, light coffee, cream, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of dark/bready malt and vanilla notes; with solid strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, vanilla, toasted bread, light coffee, cream, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Light herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, vanilla, toasted bread, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Very nice balance and robustness of dark/bready malts and vanilla flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.7%. Overall this is a very good vanilla porter. All around good robustness and balance of dark/bready malt and vanilla flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Deep dark brown, almost close to black. Thin head that leaves quickly until just a thin layer left. Decent lacing. Aroma is malty with just a hint of vanilla, not as much vanilla as I expected. But of course I do not see any bottling date or drink by date. This beer I am sure is alittle older, as I have seen it on the shelf for some time. Taste is nice and smooth with a nice blast of vanilla and a Three Musketeers Like taste, interesting. Very drinkable and smooth, light bitterness, roasted malts and lot of sweetness upfront. Feels good going down, coats the tonque and is a little thick on the palate. Overall, a well balanced, lighter porter."

"This is a great, well balanced porter. For some reason not nearly as good from a bottle as it is on tap. Get it at bar."

"Picked up a 6 pack of this stuff on sale at a local liquor store. Thought I would try it out after a coworker of mine recommended it to me. Deep Brown in color this porter ale offers slight notes of chocolate and roasted nut all that you would expect from a porter. I personally love anything vanilla, I would choose plain vanilla ice cream over any ice cream flavor. That being said I wasn't able to pick up a ton of vanilla until about a minute after taking my first sip, which was a little disappointing. I would like to see more forward notes of vanilla, but that might just be the vanilla lover in me. Over all it's a good beer, just left me wanting more vanilla notes."
""
"O: the vanilla sets this one apart from other porters; I prefer a straight up porter, but keep coming back to this from time to time;"
""
""
"Enjoyed. Smooth taste. Light vanilla flavor."

"One of my favorite out of the bottle brews.  I have not seen it on tap in the Cincinnati area.  Has a good mouthfeel with a rich head to tends to stay when poured.  A pleasant malty rich taste with obviously strong Vanilla notes.   Aroma matches the Vanilla taste....rich and malty."

"Black in color and yet still barely penetrable to light.  A fingernail of khaki colored foam is on top.  Light Brussels lacing.  Aroma is comprised of dark malt and coffee.  When I taste it I initially get dark malt and then a rush of vanilla sweetness quickly dials it the other direction.  The mouth is slightly oily and viscuous."
""
""
""
"Very creamy, can taste the vanilla but not overpowering."
""
""
""
""
"A very good beer with a mild vanilla after tast. Not cheap but fun to try every now and then."
"Now here's a good porter.  The vanilla flavor adds a nice smoothness and mild taste to this beer, and as a result it's not one of the smokier ones out there for those that prefer that taste.  This is a great dessert beer and one of my preferred porters."

"Overall: This is a very nice porter that dark beer drinkers will enjoy. Works best as a dessert beer, I think, because of the vanilla and chocolate notes, though it isn't overwhelmingly sweet. A good find for any fan of domestic porters."

"Sleek dark brown color with a slight creamy light khaki colored froth...  A terrific mix of vanilla, coffee and roasted malt dominate the aroma...  The vanilla dominates the palate but it never comes close to approaching cloying...  Medium bodied...  Goes down smoothly...  A very nice easy drinking well rounded brew..."
""
"Sweet, creamy head. Vanilla flavor is present and the main focus, but not overwhelming. Could benefit from more carbonation, but that might be my personal taste and not a reflection of the porter style."

"Overall - The presentation is probably the best part, but thats pretty hard to screw up, especially with a porter. From there, the brew goes steadily downhill, culminating in what tastes like what would be a decent porter but is so watery it ruins it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very drinkable, dark but not overly bitter porter. Vanilla and coffee notes."
"Purchased in bottle. Pours a 1/4"" light tan head. Dark amber brown body, extremely smooth. Despite being a porter tastes light, but still hoppy. On first sip, I didn't taste anything reminiscent of vanilla, then it got stronger about 1/5 down the glass which stays consistent from there. Definitely tastes of vanilla bean- pure, somewhat sweet, with a sense of woody spice. Great beer for pairing with desserts."

"Pours a very dark amber brown in color with a thin beige head. Some spotty lacing is seen. The aroma is of roasted malts, chocolate with a hint of vanilla. The taste is about the same but is on the weak side. Not bad tasting at all but needs more flavor. Perfect carbonation for the style and goes down easy. Just wish there was more of a stronger flavor."

"I am typically a bigger fan of stouts than I am of porters, but I just had this the other day and it is very good. I always love heavier beers like this from nitro taps because of how unbelievably smooth the nitro makes the beer. I enjoyed this beer after a meal almost as a dessert."

"I decided to try this beer as it sounded interesting from all the reviews.  At first I wasn't a fan, but then it grew on me. It's quite smooth and has a hint of vanilla, nothing overpowering. I'm used to heartier beers, but this was pleasant to drink. It has a nice flavor. I would buy again if I needed something light and smooth to drink with a bit if flavor.  I finished it quickly without noticing and wishing I had another as it went by so fast. It's not at the top of my list, but I did enjoy it enough to buy again."

"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Color was a reddish brown with a small caramel head. Body was a bit thin food a porter. Initial flavor was thin with a slight vanilla tinge, with a strong coffee-like bitterness to follow. Thoroughly unremarkable. Too dry for the style and not nearly enough vanilla. Dry Dock makes a much better iteration of this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice dark brown with a half inch light brown head. Not much vanilla smell at first. After the beer warms up a little I could smell the vanilla. Not much vanilla taste at all. A very dry tasting beer with a dry finish. There is a slight sweet smell and taste. Was a bit disappointed in this one."

"Overall: I've tried a lot of vanilla beers before. Some are good, but most are bad. This beer falls closer to the second category. It has al its eggs in the vanilla basket and that should not be a problem. If you picked up this beer, you do want vanilla, and it delivers it in spades. I would had preferred a deeper roast, a darker color, and a more porter-stout flavor, but for what I got I found it to be very nice. 3.75"

"I would say that i normally rate things on the generous side. Whether it is food or beer, I am more inclined to say, ""eh it wasn't that bad i guess"" even if it should be more critically rated. I preface with that, because that is really saying something when I rate this beer so poorly. I poured rather aggressively and I was absolutely shocked that it produced NO head. Not very little, not less than I'd prefer...NO HEAD. After a few seconds all that was left was a rootbeer-ish foam rim around the glass and that haze that sits in the middle of the glass. To put it in perspective, I literally had to look at the bottle and box to make sure I had not accidentally bought a fancy soda. The mouthfeel is very thin and extremely undercarbonated. The flavor hammers with vanilla and reminds me of a very tasty soda, but not a tasty beer."

"o: Easy drinking and highly sessionable. First beer I have had which had vanilla in its title and actually delivered significant vanilla flavor. Since vanilla is a personal favorite flavor, I'm liking this porter a lot, although the more common porter smokliness or cold coffee or dark chocolate tones which are mostly absent or masked here are fine too."

"Pours a deep amber color with a three finger head the slowly recedes leaving little lacing. The beer smells heavily of malts with very little vanilla. The taste is very malty as well with almost not vanilla flavor, however as the beer warms it becomes sweeter and the vanilla more apparent. Good porter over all in my opinion."

"Overall, a very good porter. The taste is better at 50F+."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a beer that drinks pretty well as a whole, but doesn't really do anything amazing on any of the individual components. Definitely a case of the sum being better than the parts. I can't help wonder if Breckenridge would be well served to blend their oatmeal stout and vanilla porter to improve the body and balance between the sweet and bitter components."

"Colorado definitely has given the world its fair share of small breweries so this was my first sample from Breckenridge Brewery. Overall, I was pleased. The vanilla smooths out the flavor a bit compared to standard porters out there. However, it wasn't very pronounced in the overall flavor as much as I might have hoped. Definitely not a bad choice for a porter, but I wasn't blown away. All said and done, I would buy/order this again but maybe not my top recommendation."

"Overall: Not bad, but not as good as I was hoping. If vanilla was stronger, and the flavor was more rounded, it would be better. Picked it up as part of a mixed six, so I won't have to worry about drinking more of these."

"O: Good, it does everything well but nothing exceptional, I am biased because I've been drinking 6-10% 'ers lately so this feels almost too light, but, in addition, it has a sort of one-note quality"
""
"This is a decent beer. Heard good things about this brewery which is what made me try it. Very smooth for a porter so it is a good introduction beer for someone who typically does not drink darker beers. Light vanilla smell. Was hoping for a more robust vanilla flavor but it is not there. Very drinkable and enjoyable but was hoping for a little more."

"It is not a bad beer at all but it is not great either. It's got a great finish of vanilla which makes me really like drinking this beer. It is an easy drinking beer and goes down really well. Definitely a session beer, I could easily drink a few of these in one session. I could not get a lot of flavors out of the smell but could definitely smell a hint of vanilla. It's an average beer but I would drink it again for sure. I liked it more because It is a colder November night and it definitely feels like a fall/winter kind of beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not a good beer. A lot of artificial tastes here. I guess it could be a good introductory craft beer to show newbies some of the new tastes to find in craft, but too artificial to be considered anything beyond that."

""
""
""
""
"This is my favorite Porter, one can taste the vanilla in every sip. Good beer to drink on chill evenings in the mountains. This brewery is of very good quality and I have never encountered one of their drinks to be below my expectations. The Vanilla Porter is easy to drink and leaves a good aftertaste in your mouth. Definite recommendation for anyone who wants to try something different."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-overall not bad but left a lot to be desired. Not really an amazing porter and not enough complexity to be an interesting variation on the style"
""
""
"The label says Remarkable Vanilla Porter, but I found it was really only one of the three. I could go through all the categories, but if you imagine all those categories for a generic porter you pretty much have this beer figured out. I found it an average porter, but got almost no vanilla and nothing really special from this beer. It is painfully average, so you will not hate this beer, but you will probably not love it either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"As I mentioned above, this reminds me of both Vanilla Coke and French Vanilla Coffee Mate. I enjoy both of these aforementioned products more than the average person... In reality, the porter base here isn't anything special. But the use of vanilla is interesting."

"Mouthfeel: a little thin"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours with a full head and a deep black coloring with the characteristic red undertones of a porter, the head recedes fairly quickly with minimal lacing. There is not much to the aroma, sort of an earthy horse blanket. Thankfully the flavor is not too overpowering vanilla sweet, in fact it's a rustic porter flavor with just a hint of vanilla as well as currant and brandy, despite the 4.7 abv. The mouthfeel is pretty standard for a dark ale, lingering but not too thick/cloying. Overall it's a decent porter but def not in the top tier of the style."

"Satisfying thick creamy flavor with a bit of a chocolate mid/after taste.. Nice flavor on tap which is how I like my beer. It is my go to beer at my neighborhood beer bar."
""
"This is a very pretty beer with a nice thick, creamy head. It's very dark in color and the maltiness is just right. There is only a minor bitterness in the aftertaste which makes it easy and smooth going down. It definitely smells of toasted malts, chocolate and vanilla. A very pleasant smell indeed! This porter makes a real nice adult float with vanilla bean ice cream. One of the best porters and adult floats that I have ever experienced. Will make this my signature go-to adult float beer."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavor was close to what I was looking for when I bought this beer, but it was entirely too thin and watery for my current palette. To say it positively, it's one of the most chuggable porters I've ever had. It doesn't kill you with vanilla flavor, I think the ratio is quite good. It's just kinda weak."
""
""

"I guess a solid porter for the style, but prefer porters with more depth of roasted malts like Bell's & Great Lakes."

"OVERALL: This is a perfect gateway beer. Your friend that only drinks Guinness might see the light in something like this. Obviously not the same style, but something a little more flavorful that they could get into. This will never be my go to, but certainly a good fall back beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A pretty good porter overall. I’d definitely have it again. Not as much vanilla as I would have thought, more of a chocolate milk taste, but it gets the job done."

"This is the Cream Soda of the beer world. I mean that in a good way. This is a very nice addition to a robust chocolate coffee toffee porter with a good layer of vanilla flavor on top to give it a nice rich sweet flavor that isn't overly cloying. I highly recommend trying this out as a good dessert beer. Very well done!"

"It had a weak, tan head that did not last long. (My biggest complaint). Just a bit of lacing on the glass. The color was a classic dark, rich mahogany brown. Mild vanilla-caramel nose and a sweetish malt taste with undertones of caramel, vanilla and bitter chocolate. The mouthfeel is very smooth. It has a gentle finish and hints of coffee in the nose on the swallow. Overall a nice, balanced brew"

I thought I'd be getting a little vanilla kick somewhere in here, but there is almost nothing - the memories of the drink are of burnt coffee, which is never good. I'm thinking I will try it again in the future. For right now though, it's very average."

"This beer pours dark brown that turns black in the glass, red around the edges and a light brown head. The beer has a lot of roasted character, there is also a good deal of coffee in this beer. The vanilla however, is its strongest taste attribute. It is a very vanilla forward brew. There is a little chocolate character to this beer as well. The mouthfeel is lacking, it is a very sessionable beer but I would like to have seen something a bit thicker. It is a solid drinkable and flavorful porter."

"Poured almost black into a frosty pint glass, the pour yielded a thin tan head of about a finger or so that disappeared quickly with just a bit of lacing. The vanilla notes are interesting...they come on late and aren't overpowering, but seem to be very well balanced with the rest of the brew. This is a decent porter...very easy to drink with just the right amount of creamy vanilla flavor. Just a little too much carbonation, but otherwise not too much to complain about. The price for 6 was over 10 bucks here in Maryland. Seemed a little steep for this brew, but again this is a pretty decent brew so I'm not gonna complain much. Cheers!"

"A very good porter - poured dark with a modest head and gave some vanilla smell, but barely. It was easy and light in the mouth and the taste was good. But I kept wanting more vanilla - not dominating it, but just a touch more would have made it phenomenal"

"O: A good porter! Vanilla flavor is underwhelming, to the point where I'd suggest a change in the name of this brew. Nevertheless, it was delicious -- I'd rather have a delicious beer with a slightly off-the-mark name than one with a great name and a disappointing flavor. I'd have this beer again in a heartbeat."
""
"O - Overall decent beer - gave it a 3.0 because it didn't scream ""I must have another"" by any means but was good and not offensive to the nose or palette. I would say a decent starter-porter for those looking to try one."
""
""
""
""
"I love this beer. My new favorite porter I think. Can't wait to try it on tap somewhere."
"O - This is a really nice Porter with a vanilla twist. Coming in tat 4.7% this one would be a nice session brew with a lot of good qualities for the lower abv. One I will come back to from time to time. Cheers."
""
""
"comments: I'm looking forward to trying this on tap if I get a chance. Hopefully I'll pick up that vanilla flavor that I'm missing. All in all, an o.k. porter that I would try again."
"O - It's a good choice for a session porter but the taste is forgettable even while drinking. I really wanted to like it but in the end I felt it was just ""OK""."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A feel there is a lack of vanilla in this ""vanilla porter."" The vanilla is only here to satisfy those with a sweet tooth. While I was once intrigued by this, I will not pursue it any further."
""
""

"Overall- A lovely beer for anytime that walks you through some complexity but none of the flavors are overpowering. This can be a good or bad thing for some but for me the multitude of flavors and versatility makes this one stand out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall - If you're looking for a completely different porter in terms of flavor. It's unique and done quite well, albeit a bit too mild for my liking. However, it's an easy drinker and it goes well with the flavor."
""
"O: I was very pleased with this beer; the smell was disappointing, but the taste more than made up for it; nice change of pace from traditional porters; looking forward to drinking more of these in the future."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"-Overall 3.5: Disappointing. This is a somewhat enjoyable beer, but it is not greater than the sum of its parts. I would have liked more smokiness to offset the sweet vanilla and more vanilla in general. Also, the conditioning needs to be increased. Still, it's a good beer for session sampling and its relatively low ABV makes it good for parties."
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: This is an average Porter. I'm not sure if the vanilla really adds anything desirable but it does set this one apart from others of the style. If it was a little more robust it'd be sessionable because of it's drinkability."

"Brownish colour with ruby highlights, ring of white head, little lace. Smell is roasted and malty, lots of milk chocolate, vanilla and bakers chocolate. Taste is pretty similar to chocolate milk, vanilla and roast malt present as well, mild sweetness and a light bitterness. Medium carbonation, light body with watery points. Nothing really stands out about this, fairly one dimensional porter, could take it or leave it really."
""
""
""
"O: Pretty decent through and through. But by having the title of ""Vanilla Porter", I was really expecting to be able to smell or taste vanilla. I was disappointed that I couldn't. They only hit half of the brew on the head; the Porter part. Other than that it's a great session beer or after dinner beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the aroma. For the style it was actually quite different. They took the vanilla and integrated it nicely, while allowing for more natural sweetness of the malts to collaborate with it, rather than overpower it. The balance was certainly there. The flavoring was almost as good, but the malts were a little rough around the edges at times, making for an ultimately incomplete, less refined taste. Still, this is a nice find and a tasty after-dinner treat."
""
""
""
"Overall- Tastes a bit too much like Yoohoo to wow me, but it's pleasant, reasonably priced, and flavorful enough to pair with something spicy. It's also one of the few readily available porters in my area, so it has that going for it."
""
""
""
"o: not as robust as it should be but a decent vanilla porter. if only founders would do a vanilla version of their porter. until then I shall settle with alternatives!"
""
"Overall: The first time I had this beer it was a real eye opener for me. I didn't realize the kind of things you could do with beer. That being said, it will always hold a special place in my heart."
""
"pours a brown ale with some etching on the surface and when I give a good shake and theres additional bubbling. Up front artificial grape and then the vanilla kinda comes through, but I feel like it is a real stretch. I'm getting the feeling there is something wrong with this bottle. Flavor is vanilla with some nice cocoa and some toasted grains, but nothing particularly special for a vanilla porter. Medium bodied with moderate carb and a dry finish. It is okay."
""
"O - I wouldn't seek this out again, but if offered I wouldn't mind trying. It just isn't a robust porter, and the hook of vanilla is not present enough."
""
"O: Solid dessert beer or breakfast beer. Would pair well with food as sweetness may be overbearing."
""
""
""
""
"Deep brown in color with ruby highlights and a tan head. The head is somewhat fizzy, not as solid and long-lasting as it could be. The aroma is a pleasant mix of malt and vanilla. Vanilla extract best describes the aroma...not quite vanilla bean. Some chocolate and graininess as well. The flavor is semi-sweet, with plenty of malt. Very smooth. Nice body...medium-full and satisfying. The flavor could have more richness and depth, but this is still a decent and enjoyable vanilla porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an average beer that I more than likely wouldn't pick up again. It was, unremarkable."
""
""
""
"O: Well, your enjoyment will come down to one question - do you like cream soda? If so, you'll probably like this too. A one and done for me, but I don't regret trying it."
""
"Overall, this seems to be a rather average porter that tried to rise above via the addition of vanilla beans. A good attempt, but I feel like the base beer wasn't up to par to accept the beans. It comes off as more of a vanilla """brown ale""" than a vanilla porter. I'll enjoy this bottle, but probably won't spring for more any time soon."""

"Poured into a glass mug. Pours dark brown to almost black with a finger length, light tan head. Some bubbles can be seen along the side of the glass, but not many. The head dissipates quickly, leaving only a cap of head atop the beer. I definitely detect the vanilla in the aroma, though this is not strong. I detect chocolate and some coffee and roasted malt aromas. The taste of chocolate and vanilla are very forward here. There is a nice malty backbone that is roasty and mildly sweet. The body is light to medium with some carbonation. The beer is smooth and is highly drinkable. This is a very good porter."
""
""
""
"won't be coming back to this one, maybe vanilla should stay out of my porter."
""
""
""
"O: A little too light for the style in my opinion and the artificial vanilla flavor is a little overpowering for my tastes. The beer is not the easiest to drink and is nothing special in my opinion. Just average and probably not one I would order again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The beer pours a nice and dark amber caramel, almost black at its middle with a cream browned head that starts tall and wheedles down to a half a fingers length, which retains for quite some time. The smell is actually quite weak… I really had to dig to find it. In the end I detected a sweet with caramel malts. The slightest tinge of vanilla can be found, but nothing near what I was hoping for. There is also a slight tingle in the back which seems bready with a slight ouch of fruit. The taste is also underwhelming with vanilla, if it is there, it is in the faint lingering sweetness of the beer. This is definitely a solid porter, though, with a good chocolatey malt taste and slight breadiness in the back of the mouth. The more you sip it the more you think you taste the vanilla on the edges of the tongue, and it definitely builds into an actual vanilla taste by the end of the beer, but it still is not the leading flavor in the beer. The beer is very clean on the mouth, leaving little to no tingle or taste, but the initial sip has a little harsh kick of carbonation but then washes away entirely. The tongue is left with sap-like strings of vanilla streaking over it after the beer has washed down. This is a terrific porter with great subtle tastes, just not the kick of vanilla I was hoping for from something called a “vanilla porter.” Maybe I am just unfamiliar with the vanilla porter style but I feel like you should be able to get more of a vanilla flavor than this beer delivers. I’d call it a vanilla-kissed/touched porter rather than a straight up vanilla porter. This is a great beer but is just labeled incorrectly."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a dark brown, with a one inch white head, that leaves behind a collar of lace. Smell is smoke, vanilla, tobacco, leather, and peat. Taste is similar, dominated by vanilla and smoke, better flavor than smell for me. Body is medium thin, good carbonation, a touch dry, and nice drinkability. This a good Porter, a touch thinner than I expected."

"O: A malty and light beer to quench thirst; great taste, even though less vanilla flavor than a vanilla porter should have. This may be due to a flavor imbalance, in my opinion. Not too hoppy, but a good overall beer."

"Very easy drinking porter. Nice full flavors but really well balanced. Has a great smell to it also, I can really smell the vanilla. But has a more heavier coffee bean flavor on the end of the sip. I'd highly recommend giving this a try if you haven't had this one before and are a fan of porters."
"D - The vanilla was not hard to find in this one...it paired well with the porter base and the low ABV and lighter body made this one very easy to drink"

"Overall a very nice beer. Not as complex as say, the founders porter, but this beer brings a lot to the table. The variety of flavors could make this a versatile beer. It is easy to drink but also very flavorful."
"This beer pours a dark brown with ruby highlights under the light. There's a half inch tan head with lace to the finish. It's aroma is nutty with chocolate and bread crust. The flavor is milk chocolate with burnt wood and vanilla notes in the background. The vanilla becomes more prominent as it warms and the mouthfeel starts thin but finishes like vanilla cream soda. Breckenridge Vanilla Porter is a good brew, recommended!"

"This is a very nice beer. It's complex, balanced, and very enjoyable. The initially the vanilla is so intense and the body so creamy it's like drinking vanilla ice cream. Then, the vanilla settles and the other flavors come to fore where this becomes a very complex, traditional porter. It's definitely worth a try."

"D/O: This porter is accessible, assembled to appeal as almost any beer with 'vanilla' in the name must be. It retains some interesting features; the best of which is the employment of the advertised vanilla. Instead of attacking the palate, it is well-integrated throughout the flavor profile. It demonstrates the ability to blend into the background and still contribute in a positive and synergistic way. Only the smell falls flat, being borderline unappealing but mostly just poorly-defined."
"dark brown pour into a pint glass with lots of fluffy tan head. decent amount of lacing. chocolate and vanilla aromas rise instantly, roasted grains, and a bit of a yeast smell. amazing tasted of roasted vanilla beans... almost like a creme brulee! roasted grains and coffee flavors are a staple for this one. smooth and creamy medium bodied ale with light carbonation. a GREAT sweet, yet refreshing porter."

"In concept, a vanilla flavored porter sounds good, but in execution it seems like not such a great idea. Even though they claim vanilla beans were used in the production, it tastes more like vanilla extract. There's a kind of sour bitterness to the beer that I don't find attractive at all. Without the addition of the vanilla, this would be a run of the mill bland porter, there's nothing special going on here. I wouldn't buy this one again."

"Cola black appearance when poured into a pint glass with a small amount of head. Smells of roasted malts and vanilla. Vanilla hits you immediately but mellows out after a second or two, also note malty and brown sugar flavors too.

""
""
"O: Overall not as robust as I hoped or envisioned. Not a lot of depth malt nor chocolate wise. Flavor was thin, a bit watered down and can be easily mundane if you were expecting a hearty vannila porter. One dimensional and liner flavor, easy drinking, but comes with a meh factor."

"Breckinridge Brewery Vanilla Porter: This porter has the standard black body and tan pillowy head. The head actually lasts rather than thinning out as the head on some porters do. Aroma is subtle, sweet with notes of mellow roast. On flavor, the vanilla really comes thorough. It is a nice complement to the porter flavor. This beer is sweet, smooth and easy to drink. While I am not a big fan of flavored beers, the vanilla in this Breckinridge brew does work well."
""
"Poured in to the Vanilla Porter proprietary glass. The color is dark chestnut. The beer was too cold initially. As the beer warmed up, the vanilla aroma and taste started to really come out. The warmer the beer got the smoother and more complex the taste got. The vanilla is very pronounced but it doesn't feel like it gets in the way of the porter. Its got a nice flavor and it would be a nice beer to serve to a group that has various tastes."

"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a ruby highlighted, vibrant, dark brown that is almost black in the depths. No head on this brew. Aromas are rich in vanilla extract and brown sugary scents. Very smooth and enticing. The beer's flavors are very rich, as well, with a sugary/candied sweetness overlaying the rich, smooth vanilla and buttery backbone. Only the slightest hint of mocha coffee, but it was just enough to bring some balance to everything. Despite all the overly sweet characteristics, the beer remains crisp and clean on a light body. Not cloying, the aftertaste is rich and darkly sweet, with the vanilla making a slight cookie-batter flavor. Slick, quick finish, making this beer insanely easy to drink. Wow...very tasty!"

"Sapsuckers in Huntington poured this in a regular pilsner glass with a small head. The color is a dark caramel but it is clear and translucent. The vanilla bean is prominent on the nose along with hints of caramel. The first sip hits you with the vanilla flavor, slight effervensce, and is not very thick in the mouth. It finishes clean with a hint of chocolate. A great beer and at 4.7% can have a few while watching the Jets attempt to play football."
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is slightly thin, but not bad. The flavor is pretty unique. Strangely, I like it better out of the bottle than poured into a glass. The taste seems more focused and out of the glass I get a dull soapy taste that is not present in the bottle. Also, this beer improves and becomes more complex as it warms. Overall. Good but not exceptional. Fun, but not a must have. Kinda like that girl from college."

"Easy to drink, with low ABV, clean finish, medium carbonation. Pretty disappointing, I’d say, although I didn’t really have high hopes for this to begin with. Lacking in just about everything I love in the porter style. I’d almost say it would be hard to identify it as a porter if tasted blind, so definitely loses points based on its lack of adherence to the style. Won’t be back when there’s still so much more to try."

"O: I had this drink once out of a bottle and was disappointed by it, but this time around I was really surprised by it. I didn't pick up anything of vanilla and so this is why this drink will get bad marks from, it simply promised something that it did not have and if it did it was really muted."

"5-22-06; On tap at Old Chicago in Peoria, IL. Pours with a two-fingered off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a good lace. A deep amber color. Nose is strong vanilla. Starts sweet with the vanilla present but not overbearing slight hop finish. Good carbonation and medium bodied. $3.75 for 16oz."

"Color is a dark brown. Smell is slightly sweet and vanilla is present as it should be. The smell of vanilla is pretty strong. Mouth feel is a little thin but it seems to work with the vanilla. Taste is pleasant and a little sweet. You can taste the vanilla front. It tends to diminish as it remains on the pallet. finishes a little weak. Overall a nice beer considering it is flavored. I think vanilla level is good and does not make it to sweet or soda like."
"O: Well the vanilla is quite obvious on this one. The porter itself, not so much. Personally I thought the vanilla was overpowering and came off in an artificial, chemical sort of way. Drinkable, but not overly enjoyable."
"Overall this is a good porter, I personally prefer more of a full bodied flavor that you might find in a mocha, chocolate or smoked porter. As I continue to drink more of my six pack I think I'll let the beer get more towards room temperature to bring out the flavors to match the aroma."
"If you've never tried this vanilla porter, go do it. I guess if it has a flaw it would be the price, but nevermind that. It's worth it."
"""ale brewed with real vanilla beans"""
"O - Average porter but vanilla is almost non-present. I would recommend it."
"One of my craft beer gateways many years ago. Not a great beer, but easily drinkable and still good for a porter that won't fill me up quickly."
"Poured this one for the Pas game. Fairly standard aroma, nothing special in that regard. Surprisingly light body that makes it exceptionally drinkable. Really fantastic and not overdone vanilla flavor. Very good beer for sitting inside on a cold day while watching football."
"O: ok I bought this in six pack and the 1st one I had yesterday seemed very weak to me, but it was the 3rd beer that day, so Today it was the first, and its so weak ABV wise its easy as hell to slam. so while I like this beer in my rankings of regular porters this one is decent in sweet type porters but not really in the range of the style I like to see it in.."
"A darker beer beer, almost black but more of a deep rich amber brown with a fluffy head. Smells like coffee and vanilla. The vanilla tastes are very subtle and the beer itself is not too big on any roasty flavors, making it very mellow beer. Clean finish with decent drinkable characteristics."
"O: A great beer, better than I remembered. Would buy another six pack of this again."
"O: I would not get it again as a personal preference because of the pre concieved expectations, but if you want to expand your horizon, it is a nice one to try."
"O - A tasty porter with a nice vanilla presence, but the mouthfeel was a tad disappointing. Worth a try, but don't get your hopes up."
"Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and smooth. Low carbonation which is just fine for this brew. Vanilla was strong, but I liked that characteristic and it was balanced well with the other flavors in this brew. I would definitely have it again! Recommended!"
"poured a deep mahogany color with almost no head. smells like vanilla beans, fresh and sweet and potent, faint coffee roasted malt fumes as well. love the taste, super strong vanilla happening, which people have critiqued, but i find it perfect for this beer, a really nice bold falvor without beeing rot your teeth sugary. theres a nice long finish on this one as well, where the flavors continue to evolve. mouthfeel a bit thin for a porter in my book, but other than that a real interesting porter. i could see this in an icecream float! mmm"
"O: I'm a sucker for vanilla, so this really hits the spot. Give me something like this or Dragon's Milk and I'll be happy. I really like the chocolate/vanilla balance."
"Sorry, my expectations were set really high. This is why I am typically hesitant to give out suggestions unless I really understand the drinking preferences of the audience."
"Overall: Good beer, I really enjoyed it. Very smooth and the flavors marry well. Thoroughly enjoyable beer."
"This bottle poured dark brown/black with a thin, tight cream-colored head that quickly diminished. The aroma was of roasted malt and coffee. The first thing I tasted was the roasted malt/coffee flavor; however, shortly into that first sip I was hit with the intense flavor of vanilla bean. That flavor subsided, melding again with the roasted notes into the finish, which was more bitter that I would typically expect from a porter. Overall, this beer blew me away with its originality. I would recommend this beer to any of my friends, especially those that like darker, malty beers."
"Appearance is dark brown to nearly black with orange-maroon tones when held to light. I was expecting a nice whiff of vanilla after opening, but I could hardly smell vanilla at all, just weak roasted malt scents. The taste is roasty malts, nothing complex, with maybe just a hint of vanilla in the background. If it wasn't called a vanilla porter, I may not have noticed it at all. Mouthfeel seemed a bit on the thin side. Not a bad porter at all, but rather ordinary and uninteresting."
"Poured a 3/4"" light mocha head which faded fast. Dark clear burnt umber brown body verging on coffee. The smell is weak and not particularly complex, mainly mild malt, not vanilla. Taste is a very weak and light standard porter but in the aftertaste I'm getting the vanilla. There's either an acidic zing to the finish or a slight bitterness not necessarily from hops. All in all this is a drinkable beer but quite mild and not really living up to the hyped expectations of a ""vanilla porter""."
"O - its not bad, but I would rather have a non-vanilla edmund fitz"
"overall: Was really looking forward to this and was disappointed. Not bad at all, just had high expectations."
"Scent was typical malt, no vanilla aroma. Taste has a hint of vanilla extract note, mostly sweet malt though.Very pleasing on tounge ,does not linger. Not bad overall."
"O - decent, tasty. But I don't think it is what it could be, nor what I expected."
"Overall I'd say the best word for this is disappointing. I've liked other Breckenridge beers I've had, I've liked other vanilla beers I've had and I THOUGHT I remembered enjoying this the first time I had it. I guess my memory was faulty. I really wanted to like this beer. I like that you can taste the vanilla beans as opposed to a vanilla extract kind of flavour, but overall it is just not very well constructed. Underwhelming."
"This isn't a bad beer, but it does suffer an identity crisis. It's sweet enough to not be poundable, but isn't flavorful enough to amaze me. It's not a bad beer, but I don't know when it will be in my refrigerator again."
"I'm getting ready to try and recreate a version of this beer in two weeks and I cannot wait! This beer is roasted malty vanilla goodness. this is one of those beers that I sip, then wait 15 minutes, then sip, then wait another 15 minutes... I usually drink this beer while drinking another beer. I recommend that when you get to the end of this beer, the last two ounces, warm it in your hands to almost room temp. It really comes full flavor then!"
"Medium in body, creamy in the feel. Dark roasted malts are present in the taste, but seem to be pushed back by a sweetness that is not vanilla, and a somewhat strange sourness. Vanilla is there, yes, but it doesn't jump out at you as much as this nearly sour milk taste. A slight bitterness on the back that tingles a little, but doesn't do much else for the character. It does leave a very small coffee bitterness in the linger, but the sourness lingers heavier. Not my favorite, it definitely smells better than it tastes. Could have used a bit more vanilla in my opinion, but maybe thats the root of the strange sour taste."
"O-its not a bad beer, but it seems to be a porter for the people accustomed to drinking macros. Although the tastes are good enough to make this beer a decent pairing with any activity. It at least goes down easier than most porters."
"Overall: Not too shabby for a porter. I know there are better ones out there, but this one is very reasonable and probably would taste better on draft. Can't wait to order a pint when I am out in Denver for the Pats game in December."
"I'm torn in my rating between a 1 (it tastes lousy to me) and 5 (it's one of the most creative, wild beers I've had); so I split it down the middle; the curious should definitely try it"
"Had a pint tonight while having dinner at Birch Street Bistro in Roslindale. Served on tap in a standard pint glass. Dark brown colored body. Not much head for a porter; a bit thin. Smell had slight notes of coffee and wood. I enjoyed the taste, but it might not be for everyone. The flavor of vanilla is very prominent. While I enjoyed it, there was a time or two while I was drinking where I thought I'd like it more if it was toned down a bit. Mouthfeel was also on the thin side for a porter, which was kind of a letdown. An interesting beer if you enjoy unique versions of porters. May be better suited to drink after dinner or with dessert, rather than with an entree."
"Other notes: The vanilla bean was a perfect compliment for this porter. Seldom seen? Yes. Never duplicated? Not yet, anyway."
"Overall, I may have a new favorite pint when I go to Scotty's. It's a shame this is a seasonal fall/winter brew, I'll miss this one when it goes away."
"Overall – The beer definitely tastes better after it warmed up to room temperature in my glass. The flavour isn't cloying in any way and it is actually quite drinkable. Not something I'd rush out to buy again, but it's worth trying for sure."
"I'm sad to say this was a pretty big disappointment. It was promising on first sniff, but just didn't really deliver as it was just too weak. I wasn't looking for an overpowering flavor bomb, but this was much, much too subtle and lacking concentration."
"O: If you like vanilla and you like porter, this would be a good beer to try."
"O: an ok beer, nothing I'd return to"
"A decent vanilla porter, and perhaps I've been spoiled by other world-class examples."

"I picked this up initially to fill a mix a 6pk, and I barely looked at what it was. After arriving home, I suspected that this would be far too sweet for me, but it was actually surprisingly good."
"Breckenridge Vanilla Porter is a dim, dark brown ale with a khaki head that quickly fades to a bubbly ring. The aroma is brimming with chocolate and roast. There is a slight hint of coffee in the nose and the vanilla seems to manifest itself almost as oak. It's medium bodied, smooth and sudsy. The finish is dry and clean. It tastes much like it smells, but stronger, with lots of chocolate and roast. There's a little coffee in there too. The vanilla is not prominent and comes off as oak. There's not really any noticeable bitterness or sweetness. There's a slight, roasty aftertaste. This is smooth, tasty and easy to drink."
"This is a great dessert beer as it has all of the right sweet to compliment something decedent like chocolate cake or the like. This is how a porter should be. I wasn't that impressed with Lucky U, but this one may change my outlook on Breckenridge."
"O: A great vanilla porter. Super smooth and well balanced."
"Overall a good beer. worth a try if you see it. this is my first from Breckenridge brewery and i think I'll have to try a few more by them for sure."
"O: It's alright. 3.5"
"Overall- A very enjoyable beer. A nice change of pace from the run of the mill porters and stouts that are out there."
"O: a pretty good beer although I was a bit disappointed in regards to the vanilla. I'm a big vanilla fan and the main thing that caught my eyes while at the beer store was its advertised vanilla flavor. Don't get me wrong, there is some in there, both in the smell and taste, but not as much as I was hoping for. Nevertheless, a good porter beer that can be enjoyed after a food."
"O - Well, the olde-time bottle does mention that it’s “partakable,” and I’d agree. It’s an easy drinker. However, it’s a feeling that only lasts as long as the alotted 12 ounces do. I don’t know if I’d want to knock back another one. Still, a fine dessert beer or a “unique” beer near the end of a session - I wouldn’t want it up front, though."
"Final Thoughts: I think this would make a perfect intro to porters for people that are totally new to it. Very basic porter thats toned down a bit with added vanilla. But for more experienced porter lovers, this is gonna come up short for you and leave you wanting something more. Not bad a bad beer, just nothing to go nuts about."
"A real nice porter that was tasty and full of nice robust flavors, but my only knock is that it borders on being too sweet."
"Small cap of head over the expected dark browns and rubies. Aromas are prominently chocolate malt that really wafts out of the pour. Flavors are slightly cloying at first. Sweetness from the chocolate and coffee malt are there but then each sip turns a little sour. I'm not sure where that's coming from? Goes from bitter to tangy and back again, which is a little misplaced in my opinion. Mouthfeel is light with low carbonation. Thankfully the awkward sour character really tone down when the beer warms up, but I think I'll pass on this one next time..."
"O: Initially I was going to rake this over the coals. Still not sure I love it, but definitely decent. Let it warm BAs. Let it warm. Still hate the lack of head though"
"This is a bit like root beer for adults. The contrast of the real vanilla and the hops is unusual but tasty. Despite my root beer comparison, this is a beer that doesn't fall into the category of a dessert beer and can be happily enjoyed with a meal."
"It really surprised me to see such a low rating on here. The beer is exactly what I was hoping for and then some. In my opinion, VERY porter like with a lot of vanilla presence. I am glad I bought two bottles cause this is great!"
"B-"
"I don't give a Schlitz about this disgusting porter. I've said it before and I'll say it again here; I need to crack open a Schlitz tallboy to wash this awful taste from my mouth."
"O- Not a bad beer, but not a great beer. It was a pretty forgetable beer. I think they should take the vanilla off the bottle and just call it ""porter"" instead."
"I feel like if the vanilla were more subtle than I would give this a B or B+ but hey..."
"Breckenridge Vanilla Porter pours black, with about two fingers of cream colored foam capping the beer. Head retention and lacing are both present, but neither really impress. The nose is initially downright unimpressive, a weak vanilla presence and some nutty notes that, while not bad, have no place being the centerpiece for a porter over coffee, chocolate, or even caramel. As the beer gets close to room temperature though, a milk chocolate aroma does join the proceedings and redeem the beer a little bit. Unfortunately, even warming can't save the flavor this one. The vanilla that is present tastes like it was added via cut rate flavoring rather than beans, and it's supported only by the taste of toasted nuts, something that should, best case scenario, appear sparingly is a secondary note in a porter. The body is solidly full for being an under 5% brew. The carbonation is right near where it needs to be, but to me comes across as just a touch low at times. I was excited for this one, as I love adding vanilla to dark beers, so Breckenridge's Vanilla Porter is a letdown"
"Cheers & Thanks saramisu!"
"Pours a medium brownish-black with a medium head, frankly, this beer doesn't impress much on first glance. The smell is nicely sweet without being cloying. WRT taste, my wife was all about this beer; I found it pretty good and nicely balanced, but there was a vague bitterness that was a bit false in a beer that is going vanilla. Very good job at minimizing aftertaste though. All in all, not bad."
"This brew pours a brown color with two fingers of head that quickly drop down. The aroma is very nice, there's a very nice, realistic vanilla bean note over roasted malts. The taste has a nice roasted maltiness, along with chocolate notes. But the real star of the show is the vanilla notes, which are very well done. They're not heavy-handed, but instead a realistic vanilla note shines through the other notes. The mouthfeel is nice, it's got a nice, creamy, well-carbonated mouthfeel. The drinkability is very good; however, you have to like vanilla to want to be able to drink this one. Overall, this was a very enjoyable brew."
"a brownish black body that appears quite thin with a thin white head and no real lacing. vanilla toffee and chocolate are in the nose but it all feels very light and subdued. with a vanilla porter you expect a big bang and this nose is a dud. vanilla toffee and chocolate again its a little bit more noticeable in the taste than the nose but it definitely is still lacking and feels watered down. they definitely got the balance of the flavors down well and if they were just a bit more present this would be a very good beer. carbonation is low and works well. overall this is just a decent beer which is too bad because i think if they tweaked a few things here they could have a real beast."
"O: Not a great beer, but pretty good. Certainly drinkable, and might be best after a meal since it tastes so strongly of vanilla. Lacking for complexity, but well balanced, if a bit on the sweet side."
"O - A nice easy drinker, would have this again."
"mouthfeel - creamy, smooth and well carbonated for the style. i like it."
"Taste is vanilla - it dominates the scene- there is a nice porter here with subtle coffee & chocolate notes, but the aftertaste again is all vanilla. It has a very nice creamy mouthfeel, but is too much vanilla for me."
"Overall: Me likey. But you had better like vanilla as it is its main flavor but not too overbearing for me. A nice change of pace beer."
"Notes: A very tasty and well brewed vanilla porter. A good find. Cheers."
"I will start by saying I am rather preferential to vanilla. That being said I did rather enjoy this beer although I will say I wasn’t sure whether this was brewed with vanilla or infused with vanilla. The vanilla is so strong it seems fairly artificial. However, I still liked it overall although the feel left something to be desired for a porter."
"From the Breckenridge sampler pack. Pours a dark mahogany brown, nice little white frothy head to it. Aroma is of very faint vanilla. Taste is really thin, especially for the style which kind of ruins the mouthfeel for me. The vanilla isn't super present, but as the beer warms it shows more. Aftertaste is lackluster and doesn't just come together for me, too sloppy and watered down, and the vanilla feels out of place. The rest of the beers in the sampler pack were good, but I'd pass on this one."
"O- Nice vanilla, coffee and roasted flavors...not the best i've every had but still very good. I will certainly have this again at some point."
"it poured a watered down brown ale color with a very small off white head which quickly dissipated. I didn't really smell the vanilla bean till it warmed up. It was not really porter tasting and the vanilla was very weak I got just old cold coffee aromas. The body was more light to medium, but not very smooth. It was just an average beer all around. I will not drink this again."
"Pours a mahogany brown with a one-finger coffee cream colored head. Aroma of vanilla beans, cream, hint of coffee and molasses. Really big vanilla bean flavor to start. Vanilla cake and melted ice cream like sweetness. Bit of caramel and a hint of roasted malts wrap this one up. This beer is vanilla or bust, but very enjoyable if that's in your wheelhouse."
"D - Not a bad beer with some nice vanilla sweetness; low scores for flavor character but still has a nice balance of vanilla beans and roasted malt"
"Good carbonation, and an average porter."
"A nice beer overall. Definitely unique which I crave. This is my first from breckenridge and I look forward to tasting more of their offerings."
"O: Overall, not a very good beer. Tastes more like a watered down vanilla cola than a vanilla porter.I'd like to have much more presence from both the vanilla, roasted malts, and a creamier body."
"D- Not too heavy, not too light. 3 or 4 maximum."
"Vanilla shows up much more in the flavor and really gives it a fresh bean flavor. I could see it being a bit much for some, there is more vanilla here than any other beer I have ever had. Malts are grainy with unsweetened chocolate. Lack of roast keeps this simplistic and one could argue one-dimensional. Little bit of dark bread here and hops are almost non-existent. I have always enjoyed this beer, but one is enough in a sitting. Unique and tasty, a good combination in my book."
"Pours a dark, yet see through, brown. Reminds me of a coke. Smells of sweet vanilla, a tad bit of coffee, and a bit of malt. Tasting however, i swear I catch a hint of cherry to go along with the vanilla dominated porter. The coffee is present, but very light. There is a slight malt flavor as well. I can catch some hops right on the tail end of the swallow. Starts out creamy, but that is soon dominated by carbonation. Very light mouthfeel. Lighter than I like, but drinkable. This is my first ""vanilla"" brew, and I enjoyed it. If anything, this makes me want to get some of the ""better"" vanilla brews. Over all I would drink this again, probably as a session beer."
"Overall: an okay vanilla porter, but its really lacking. More body, more roastiness, a creamier mouthfeel, and a few other things could help this beer improve. Cheers!"
"Smell is of a typical stout; roasted and slightly smokey. Mouthfeel is very good, I'd say. Nice carbonation and smooth going down. The vanilla aspect is lacking definitely. I can only detect a sweet stout taste, and just the slightest vanilla on the back end. Slightly disappointed in that since this is the first porter I've had with ""vanilla"" tasting notes. The vanilla reveals itself a little more once the beer warms up, but it's still underwhelming. This is a decent beer but once my six-pack is gone, I doubt I will get another."
"O: It like this style of beer and the vanilla is a little over powering but still a nice addition. I would drink this again."
"D - drinkable if you can get over the lack of the true vanilla experience."
"Overall I feel like this beer could be great with a little more body. I love vanilla and the flavors are right up my alley, but it's a bit light. I still enjoyed this nonetheless and it's very drinkable at 4.70% ABV."
"Pours a semi-clear dark brown color with a 1/2 inch tan head that fades to an oily film. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malts and vanilla beans. Taste is of dark roasted malts, vanilla cola, and vanilla extract. This beer has good carbonation with a soda-like crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good porter with some unique vanilla flavors. I would definitely get this one again. My first beer from Breckenridge."
"O: I like it. I'm not sure there's much more I can say about it. If they used real vanilla beans I'd be all over it, but as it stands, I think it's pretty decent for a vanilla porter."
"This beer is delicious. It tastes like a dessert beer, maybe like an eclair with hops! The vanilla is light bot noticeable all the way through. The only criticism is a high level of carbonation which changes the mouthfeel, maybe it's different off tap."
"I was really excited to try this brew until I actually did and wasn't very fond of it. The pour was nice its had a deep dark brown color with a tan colored head. The smell of the beer was lacking something to me... The vanilla. Maybe it's in the taste... Nope, not there either. Where is the vanilla in this? I was so bummed that I wasn't able to get any of that flavor that I probably can't give that much of a legit review. The smell did have a roasted aroma to it though, and the taste had a burnt bitterness to it. The mouthfeel wasn't too thick or anything. Overall just really bummed, I hate when something like this fails to please."
"However if you like vanilla then you would love this beer."
"This was a rather unique porter, but not the style of porter I prefer. It is still well worth trying."
"O: Overall, I am a little disapointed in this one. I certainly won't have a problem finishing the six pack I have, but I also won't be running out to get anymore."
"Overall, a very nice, drinkable, porter."
"Pours a black color with brown hues and a half inch of light brown head. Some lacing. Aromas of roasted malts, vanilla, earthiness and brown sugar. Taste is a big amount of vanilla upfront with a lot of sweetness. Brown sugar as well. Somewhat malty but mostly this one tastes of the vanilla. A bit earthy at the end. This one is pretty sweet but still decent. Overall, i'd get this one every once in awhile. Not bad, not great."
"OK, NOT A MUST HAVE!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. A dark reddish brown in color that let a fair amount of light through. Head was a light brown, less than 1 finger, that only lasted a few minutes. Very thin layer remained that clung a bit. From a distance the aroma was a bit bitter with a bit of alcohol. From up close the vanilla was very prevalent, and was slightly sweet. Taste was a bit of roasted grain, with a small bit of lactose sweetness. Finished up a bit sweeter, with a tad of vanilla. Fairly good in the mouth. A tad on the thin side, but coated fairly well. Lingered in the mouth, and was very well carbonated. Overall a solid beer. Nothing detracting, but nothing phenomenal either."
"Fantastic beer, A must buy."
"I was a little disappointed in this beer simply because I like my porters a little more robust and hearty, but it's not bad at all. If you like really smooth, mild porters then you'll probably enjoy this quite a bit."
"This was an excellent beer. I would gladly have another!"
"Not too cloying, but a little thin for a porter"
"Overall this is a drinkable beer with, as advertised, vanilla hints in a porter style."
"Overall, I liked it. There was a nice balance of vanilla in the beer. I had hoped for something a little heartier, but it was still good. Good blend of malty sweetness."
"Overall, I was impressed how the vanilla flavor was present, but it didn't overpower. Nice beer for dessert."
"O – Really impressed, lived up to the label and the expectations."
"The taste of this brew hits me as a really good brew. I keep coming back to it and buying more when its available in my area."
"D- I could have a few more of these, probably not something I would buy again soon but not bad for what it is. A nice take on a vanilla porter, but not a great porter without the added novelty."
"O- not sure if i would buy a case of it, but its good when thrown in a variety pack"
"O- Nice beer to drink for me."
"This porter is very meh. I can't really recommend this beer to anyone when there are much better porters (non-flavored) out there."
"O/D: It's really light, and packs a decent amount of flavor, but was hoping for something more. The amount of vanilla is just right for the mouthfeel and ""heaviness"" though."
"Overall, the beer was alright. Not horrible, but has a lot of work to do to be good."
"O: ok for a flavored porter, but nothing too amazing."
"It is not too heavy on the vanilla - a good thing... a decent brew... Not one I would look for again, but had no problems going through a six-pack over a few days. I would not have mind it being more robust, however, especially for a winter seasonal."
"D: A little sweet and heavy in the vanilla."
"O) Not great. Decent porter but I think the sweetness from the vanilla does more harm than good."
"At $1.59 for 12oz vs. $11.99 for a 750ml of the Rogue Double Porter, the Breckenridge is a good value in comparison but not nearly as big."
"Overall: Not the best porter I've ever had. The flavours are weak at best and fake tasting. Also, without any of that coffee bite that porters require, its a bit out of style."
"O: I feel the negative reviews are unwarranted. At 4.7%, this was basically a dark session beer for the craft beer junky!"
"Overall- Very nice beer. I certainly welcome this beer to your rotation to mix up the standard porter- Very good vanilla taste."
"First sip is a bit lighter than I expected it to be. There are characteristics of vanilla, a bit of sweetness, but there seems a bit of emptiness to it that I just don't like. From everything on the bottle and the reputation of the brewery, I was expecting a real heavy-hitter. Then again, this is a porter and not a stout. Maybe I'm confusing my categories when reviewing this. As a porter, I guess I can learn to accept this, but as a beer, I would expect better."
"I find this to be tasty and drinkable. Good find."
"I recommend this beer. Try it for yourself, you won't regret it."
"Average, maybe even a disappointing beer. If you like vanilla or cream soda it might be good but over all it is lacking as a porter, it seems to me that breckenridge beers are often a little thin in both body and flavor, this one is no exception. Nice bottle but probably wont come back to it."
"Full of chocolate flavor that follows a very dominate sweet rich vanilla dominator. Very good porter. Not watery, a good roasted profile that includes dark chocolates and a subtle coffee profile. Hops play background music in earthy tones. The scent is very roasted and very vanilla. The body is nice, thick, and creamy. Drink ability? I've found a new favorite."
"Flavor goes straight to the vanilla. Creamy body, feels almost like a vanilla coke. The roastiness takes a back seat here, and likewise, I get no coffee tones. Still, this is a good-tasting porter, and a superb change of taste from the usual. Nice work!"
"Smooth, velvety on the tongue and fairly sweet. Vanilla, clealry present but just short of overpowering. Milk chocolate, caramel, malt balls all picked up. Too sweet for sessionability, but not too sweet to enjoy this one again, perhaps with a piece of pie or chocolate dessert."
"This beer just lacks any standout qualities. Doesn't feel authentic and true to the Porter category. Avoid."
"Overall This is not a well made beer in my opinion.I would not reccomend."
"I was looking forward to trying the vanilla flavor but something tells me there is a better one out there."
"I could have easily enjoyed another during my sitting, since I almost forgot that this was a beer. This won't knock anyone's socks off but after the long week I had, this hit the spot quite nicely. Those looking for a beer with lots of mouthfeel, depth, and various notes won't find much here but every now and then, it's great to pop something open and just marvel and how simply smooth and nicely crafted a beer can be. This certainly fits that bill!"
"Overall a very good porter that lives up to it's name with lots of Vanilla. quite refreshing and good with food."
"I've had this before from the bottle and thought it to be an OK beer. It was definitely better on tap, but not tremendous."
"Overall- My first time having this was with my cousin Mark and it was a great session ale! I will have again but know it is only a 1 a night beer... Unless you are only drinking this one, you could probably enjoyed 2-3 but definitely need to share this 6-pk. Nice!"
"The vanilla and caramel are fine but the base porter needs some work, quite thin and needs some more malty presence. The beer is servicable."
"12oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint. Pours a translucent reddish-brown with ruby highlights when backit. Head is a quarter inch, cream-colored and frothy and quickly disperses into a sudsy film and a bubbly band around the edges. A continuous band of lacing encircled the bowl. Nose expresses malt, vanilla notes and artificial sweetener. Taste follows nose with the addition of some cocoa notes which are somewhat masked by the artificial sweetener quality evident in the nose. There is also a creamy flavor intermingled with the vanilla. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively carbonation (perhaps a little too assertive) and a slightly creamy texture. Not a bad porter by any means, but fairly mediocre, all and all."
"Not sure what to expect with this one. Poured dark brown into a snifter with a small tan head. The aroma was malty with a hint of vanilla. At first it tastes like a standard porter and then the vanila hits you and mellows out nicely. Overall I thought the beer was average. I wouldn't go out and pick up anymore but I'm glad I had the chance to try it."
"O - A nice attempt. Best Vanilla porter I've had. Vanilla tastes real not Vanillan like many others."
"Overall-Won't purchase again. If it's sitting infront of me i'll drink it. Not impressed. Only benefit was using it for a palate cleanser for my Hop Stoopid Ale."
"Ok so this one kind of threw me a bit. The nose up front is just dominated by the vanilla, woody scents, and bold malts. Very different smell here. As you take a sip you get what you would expect from a porter...the chocolates and maltiness but the big bang is that vanilla. Its the star here. Im enjoying this but think its too sweet to have another soon after."
"O- A bit of a let down here. I don't think I'll have this one again."
"a wonderful beer. Dark brown with white/brown head. Smells of coffee and vanilla and malts. Taste just like it smells. The vanilla is so creamy and smooth. This beer hits the spot on a good day and has smooth feeling to it. Its drinkabilty is downright good for a six pack"
"Overall, a very tasty porter. I like the addition of vanilla to a traditional porter."
"A friend of mine gave me a bottle of this brew to try a while back and just decided to crack it tonight. I can't faintly smell the vanilla , but once I take a swig it comes right out and hits you. Its a nice balance. I was afraid it may overpower the beer, but it seems to work very well with the malt flavors. I could probably see myself having a couple of these in a sitting. the beer was well carbonated, though I would have prefered a slight bit less. Overall a nice brew that I would like to have another of someday down the road."
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Appearance is dark and rich, carbonated a litle more than I'd like though. Not much of a head, and very little lacing. Nose is not complex, but has some dark roast coffee and a little vanilla. Not a bad balance. Flavor is also pretty basic. Dark roasted coffee malt, and hints of sweet. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
"O: This kind of strikes me as cheap filler beer for a fridge."
"I may be a sucker for vanilla, but besides the identity crisis, this is a better beer then what the score currently indicates. Too many people comparing it to style could be the ratings only excuse."
"O- A decent brew for your buck, it aint remarkable as the label says but it doesnt disappoint."
"O: The beer is easy to drink, but there's nothing really interesting about the taste that would make me want to try this again."
"I am very suprised by the relatively low rating this porter has recieved on this sight. I guess it just means more for me."
"It's not bad if you like overpowering vanilla and cheap vanilla ice cream, but nothing special."
"The easy mouthfeel and interesting flavor definitely help the drinkability."
"D- drinkable, would prefer this especially on tap, my palate says more hops but I'm sure that's not what they were going for with this one..ill have another, cheers!"
"D-Very drinkable. wish it had alittle more pop or hop..Was still good but wanted alittle more from this one!"
"Final verdict - For the most part, this was an unimpressive beer. Its shining moment is the addition of vanilla. I am a huge vanilla fan, but this bile stuff really turned me away."
"Oh, it smells yummy! Man, my aggro pours are netting me some big heads, like this two-finger gem - light-tan, good retention, sticky lacing as it settles. Nose smelled like a swirled soft-serve ice cream cone: chocolate and vanilla at the same time. I miss ice cream not out of intolerance but simply that I never seem to be able to catch Mister Softee as he tools through my neighborhood in the summer. I am going to practice running before the season begins so that I might actually catch him this year. Color was a deep brown with cola highlights. Mouthfeel was medium and it was in the mouth that I really caught the vanilla. Holy Milli Vanilli, Batman! I remember in HomeEc when we were told to use the extract flavorings VERY judiciously and this was what a batch of my kitchen's vanilla cookies tasted like. Back then, vanilla extract was purported to be alcoholic and so we were swigging it as well as shaking it into the dough. BIG vanilla flavors, both in the cookies and this beer. One of the things that I really dig about the porter style is its ability to take on adjunct flavors. This was like a vanilla milkshake more than a Porter. Dang, but it was really pleasant. Finish was mild, smooth, fairly sweet, but it was vanilla, not sugary sweet, which is what does me in every time. I would not want more than one or two, except as a dessert beer or as an ingredient in a dessert recipe."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, but kind of reminds me of dessert overall. I'd definitely have another."
"D- definately a drinkable beer. as far as porters id reach for a bigger flavor like a baltic or imperial but nice for what it is."
"D- Just fine. This would be > than a BMC however < everything else."
"Strong cocoa flavor. Milk chocolate finish-- lightly sweet. A smooth beer with a rich body and a low carbonation. Very low hop presence. With vanilla being such a subtle flavor, I'm not embarrassed to say that I cannot find it in my tasting. Easy to quaff."
"D- never again it literally made me sick. not saying its bad but it made me sick and im done with it. anyone want 3 more of these?"
"Notes:I have had vanilla porters in the past and i must say this is a very enjoyable vanilla porter from breckenridge.also i would like to add how it laces the glass."
"D - Very tasty porter, vanilla was the amount for me. Not too sweet just balanced right. I would get this brew again, very easy to have more than one of. I highly recommend this brew"
"D - This is quite nice on the mouth. Some really nice flavors working here. It comes off a bit burnt but this is a nice start. Needs a bit more vanilla though."
"DB- Not the most flavorful or rich of porters, feels even thin compared to most porters. The vanilla bean is pretty much the only thing that carries this along."
"D: Very disappointing - almost no vanilla flavor and incredibly thin bodied."
"Overall- an 'ok' porter that offers a different twist with the vanilla aspect, though I think it could have been better utilized here. Nothing bad here."
"COULD be better. I think ""brewpub"" when drinking this (not a compliment)."
"D - I was hoping this would be a really robust flavorful porter, but in the end I was disappointed. I'm not sure if its an old bottle or not but it doesn't really impress me."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very mild, some notes of vanilla. Taste is strong of vanilla, up front and throughout, some mild hops are detected. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a pretty good beer."
"This was not quite what I expected when I tasted it. I was thinking it would be a porter with a vanilla aftertaste, but this has a hardcore vanilla flavor right from the first sip. It took a few sips to get used to, but I do really like it. It poured a dark reddish brown with very little head. It smelled very strongly of vanilla. The vanilla hits you right away. While the vanilla is strong, it is not overwhelming. The aftertaste has the malty flavor of the porter with the vanilla hanging on. This beer is an easy drinker and could be trouble! I think this is a ""once in awhile"" beer, but definitely worth trying."
"D: Flavors are surprisingly simple and light for this style of beer, esp. one infused with vanilla. I found myself taking more sips, chasing the flavor. That's not the kind of drinkability I want. Interesting, but mostly falls short on the porter front. It's just too light on the dark roasted malts."
"From a bottle stamped 05821B. It pours brownish-ruby red from the retro-labeled 12 ounce bottle. The vanilla aromas come on strong but there is a faint hint of chocolate deep within. I might have preferred a heavier body and less sour in taste. The vanilla becomes the beer rather than the traditonal Porter ingredients though."
"D: Strong, but very tasty. One or two per sitting is easily doable."
"Drinkability is ok. At only 4.7% ABV, it wouldn't be hard to drink a few of these. However, the dryness gets in the way and the flavor is a little too ""burnt."" Needs more vanilla."
"I have had this on tap at the Brewery in Breckenridge and its slightly better there, but not by much. If it had a nice vanilla taste and maybe were an Imperial, then this would be an amazing beer."
"An average porter with vanilla that just seems out of whack. I wonder how old these bottles are?"
"Bottle pours a dark brown with ruby highlights when held up to the light. Nice fluffy off white head that laces well. Aroma is pretty much roasted malts, smoke, soy sauce and a hint of vanilla. Flavor leans pretty heavy on the vanilla. Slight nutty chocolate flavor on the end but it leaves a weird lingering taste in your mouth. Rather thin but slick mouthfeel. I was excited to try this beer after I kept hearing about and seeing this beer around now. I bought a 12 pack Sampler and this is not a very good start :("
"Mouthfeel was appropriate and facilitated drinkability. I liked this one, and probably could have a couple, but would not be able to session. Worth a try."
"D: nothing I would turn down but not one I would be sad to never try again. Overall the vanilla is a nice touch but makes this beer very sweet. That combined with the carbonation almost makes this tast like a vanilla coke - I couldn't get that out of my head while drinking this one. lots of belching with this beer - could have done without that"
"Drinkability: Lower-than-average ABV and more than a few interesting flavors make this beer very drinkable. It's not my favorite, but I wouldn't shy away from buying it again, should the opportunity present itself."
"Poured into a DFH snifter and it is dark brown with some light visibility through it. The head was little to none and what was left quickly dissipated. Virtually no lacing exists with this one. Other than the color, the appearance is not stellar. The aroma is malty with some vanilla coming though. Somehow there is a hint of alcohol smell which takes away from the overall smell considerably. The nose is of sweet malts, and the vanilla comes out as it lingers. This vanilla continues to the finish and really takes hold of the flavor. Without this vanilla, the beer would be less than average. The vanilla adds a nice balance to that somehow present taste of alcohol. Overall the taste is rather enjoyable in this finish but the rest does not come together. Carbonation is alright, and the body is not too intense."
"None-the-less it is a solid porter with great mouthfeel. I defiantly recommend this one."
"Not a good drinker for me."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is just a bit over light bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. It does end up drinking pretty smoothly, especially after it warms up a bit. I'd call this beer pretty drinkable, especially since I really enjoy some nice vanilla character. There really isn't much behind it but still, I've had much worse."
"D; One and done for me."
"I was very impressed with this offering from Breckenridge Brewery. This being my first foray into any of there beers I was, per usual, a little skeptical. The beer poured a dark brown with a reasonable head. Initial aroma was of slight vanilla. After the first taste I was reeled in by the accessibility of this beer. I had expected a wallop of over the top vanilla taste, but what I got was so much more. The roasted flavor of the darkened malt came first followed by an ever so subtle wave of vanilla. I find that brewers sometimes miss the mark with flavored beers because they either don't include enough of the signature flavor, or they overpower you with it. This beer found a nice balance for both. My only regret is that they weren't able to capture a slightly higher abv. I think that would have added an additional characteristic to a very good beer."
"D - Could drink a couple of these with the lower abv to it. Nothing extraordinary, but a good drink. Good drink on a cold winter night."
"Drink: Average, an easy drink, but not something you'll be tempted to gulp down."
"Overall-disappointing as I was really excited to try this on the menu, sad that it didn't quite live up to the hype. Try it for something different but don't expect too much."
"Drinkability - As this warms more distinguished flavors start to appear ,slight chocolates with toffees and light Vanilla, very drinkable and will seek out more in the future."
"The beer pours with a finger high head of off-white head. The color is dark brown with hints of deep burgundy when held up to light. The head quickly dissipates, but leaves a nice amount of lace clinging to the glass. The aroma is light, but I get hints of bready yeast, chocolate, and light vanilla. The drink is enjoyable - you get chocolate notes along with vanilla on the swallow. The beer is very light in mouthfeel and you get a slight initial bite from the carbonation. Overall, it's a beer that I disliked the first time I had it (thought it was too thin in flavor), but I enjoyed it more when I had it again a few weeks later. Probably a one and done beer though."
"If you find this. Leave it sit where you found it. Pick up something else."
"Next to nothing for abv and it shows. This is like drinking soda beer or something, but it's a piece of cake. Might even make a simple easy weakened dessert beer for people with training wheels. But it's easily likeable to drink so I'll rate it good on those points, and not hard at all, a very sessionable drinking beer which some might find kind of fun."
"D: I could have quite a few of these. I tend to like porters with a little more body, however, for the style, its not bad. I probably wouldn't purchase again, not because I don't like it, because there are many better porters out there."
"Drinkability - I wouldn't drink this on a regular basis as there are some other porters that are more worthy of your time. It's just too boring as a porter. For me, I'd have more fun drinking porters from breweries such as Tyranena."
"Drinkability: for all that, the beer manages not to be cloying. I had it with tacos, and found that it paired quite well with the guacamole. I probably wouldn't look for this beer, but I finished it..."
"D- Pleasant enough beer with an interesting taste. I like the way it hits my palate. Overall, not bad. Could see sitting and sipping on this beer, but would eventually want to switch to something a little thicker."
"D - As far as vanilla goes this one was pretty good. Kind of over the top but nicely done even better than ST Creme Brulee. The low ABV may suggest multiple glasses but its really kind of a one a sitting beer. Pretty good!"
"D: Very disappointed in this beer. Has the potential to be very good, but it is definitely lacking in flavor and smell. I wouldn't get this again, nor would I recommend this to someone. A one time deal for sure."
"Poured the beer into a beer mug and it pours out into a blackish brown hue with some red highlights in it. It has a thin tan head that disappears quickly and has little retention and lacing, but it has good carbonation. The smell is coffee, chocolate and vanilla, but was disappointed that the vanilla aroma wasn't as strong as i thought it would be when I opened the beer bottle. The taste is a nice well balanced taste of chocolate, followed by some coffee, caramel and than get some hops and finally some vanilla at the end. This porter is well balanced and not too much bitterness, seems to be more on the sweet side. The mouthfeel is a light bodied creamy feel, but do feel it could have a better mouthfeel by being more creamy and have a fuller body, and it is easily drinkable for what it is. I did enjoy the taste of it and would recommend it, but because it is different than most porters some hardcore porter drinkers may not like it."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. The head was very thin and disappeared almost immediately, liquid was nearly opaque. I expected more vanilla scent out of the bottle, but there wasn't much. The taste was very smooth with a fair amount of vanilla (not too sweet or overpowering) and a bit of a coffee edge. Its nice and roasty without any bitterness. This feels and tastes like a much lighter beer with quite a bit of carbonation. I wish it were a little creamier, but overall I like it a lot. Would purchase again."
"""partakable"" indeed."
"While I enjoy this beer, it always feels like it's missing something."
"This has been a long time like for me. It's a solid porter with a good flavor added to give it something different. Very drinkable and a good brew to enjoy."
"Overall- Not bad, maybe a bit artificial in the vanilla, but it is a nice flavor. The sweetness cuts back the drinkability a bit, but it is decent overall."
"This beer was OK but I was dissappointed in it overall. I love porters and the prospect of a vanilla infused porter really excited me. I was a bit let down by this."
"The vanilla works, and combines nicely with what might have been a weakish porter on its own."
"Verdict: This is a pretty average brew, nothing superb. The vanilla is not so subtle in this brew and has a bizarre aftertaste that doesn't sit favorably with me, but the brew is far from unenjoyable. Vanilla lovers should go for this one. C+ (3.1)"
"From a Wegman's mixed six into a pint glass. Porter black appearance with no lacing and a thin tan head. Looked a lot like Guinness. Smell was vanilla and roast coffee. Taste was coffee with a hint of artificial vanilla on the finish. Nothing too exciting or offensive. A good try. Thin mouthfeel and moderate drinkability. Interesting enough to say I tried it but wouldn't seek it out."
"Dark brown pour with a strong beige head that fizzles quickly. The coffee and vanilla notes meet my nose immediately and the flavor is there as well. Strong coffee and vanilla sweetness and a smooth finish. Over all lack of aftertaste. The body is a little thin for the style in my humble opinion, but the carbonation is good. The flavors are so bold and clean, each sip is interesting. If the body was a bit more substantial it would be just that much better. I bought twelve and don't anticipate having any trouble finishing each one."
"D - very vanilla lacks body didn't look appealing."
"Overall it is a nice porter. Maybe too aggressive with the vanilla? I assume that there is vanilla flavoring rather than vanilla tasting notes as a description of the malt."
"Drinkability -- This was...weird. So much of the flavor profile tasted fake: artificial vanilla, artificial maple, cheap chocolate. These things aside, I don't think the rest of the beer would be any better without them. It just doesn't come together. Pass on this one."
"A very good tasting beer, perfect for winter!"
"Though I couldn't drink a few pints of this it is a good solo pint. I can see it doing very well at a christmas party, but wouldn't drink a whole growler myself."
"Drink- It's a big let down. Just wanted it to be better. I'm a little mad the last two beers I have had let me down."
"Drinkability - not a bad brew. It's a little filling, but otherwise pretty nice. Not terribly complex, but nice-tasting."
"Very smooth taste. Not overpowering in the flavor department so it goes down easy. Semi-sweet with the vanilla flavor apparant (says it is brewed with real vanilla bean). Pleasantly surprised with the taste of this beer. Moderate alcohol content."
"Overall this is an amazing beer. The flavor is very good. The smell is a very good partner with the taste. It was a good surprise since some porters have great smell but lack in body and flavor. This didn't disappoint in either area. Also at an ABV of 4.7% this is a very sessionable brew. Great Beer Breckenridge Brewery!!!"
"D: I wanted to enjoy this beer, but the flavors are not to my liking. This will be a struggle to finish and I will certainly not be having it again."
"drinkability: for a porter, it is too light and subdued, the attempt at the vanilla flavor comes off as trying too hard, not terrible but nothing notable."
"D: Really good. Doesn't overpower like many porters allowing me to enjoy more than just 1 or 2 in a sitting."
"Wouldn't buy this again..."
"D: This is a solid porter with a Big Finnish, A good change from the flavord beers that you have to guess at that the flavor. Is it there or not. If you want a Porter have a porter if you want a Vanilla Porter this is a good one."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a crisp amount of carbonation."
"Drinkability: Goes down easy enough, the mild flavors aren't bad, just mild."
"Pretty unimpressive. Not offensive but certainly nowhere near as robust or vanilla-like as I would have enjoyed. Reminds me of vanilla Coke."
"D - Overall not a bad porter, but if it has vanilla as part of the name of the beer, call me crazy, I want to taste vanilla. Overall body of the beer could be better. Sweetness detracts from drinkability for me, but it's not cloying."
"D: Very tasty. The vanilla is pronounced and very nice."
"Overall not bad, a good porter for someone who doesn't like the typical coffee bitterness. Not really one of my favorites, but I could see this being an excellent choice to introduce someone new to the craft beer scene, maybe get a Guinness drinker to broaden their horizon a bit, so I respect that."
"Dark opaque color, with 1/2"" tan head at pour settling to clean face with ring around edge of glass. Dark mahogany highlights around edge of glass. Chocolate and roasted malt aroma, vanilla follows closely, not too much though. Medium mouthfeel, has a slight thickness to it. Malt and chocolate present in beginning. Really find the vanilla on the end and especially the aftertaste. Moderate carbonation. Pick up some dark fruit notes as beer warms. Vanilla and roast picks up with warmth as well. Pretty drinkable for a porter. Sometimes the vanilla seems to hit at a weird point during the drink that strikes me the wrong way, usually in aftertaste or end, as the beer warms the vanilla seemed to show up more in the middle and more balanced in the aftertaste."
"D: OK. This beer is too heavy on the vanilla and too light on the porter. More roastiness and a sharper ""bite"" to the feel would help, IMO."
"D--It's a good drinkability. At 4.70% it's probably the lowest ABV drink I've had in a long time. All of my DIPAs are really spoiling me I think. I don't enjoy this one as much as I do other porters. Too bad, I thought this had potential."
"The flavor is pretty mild too, but there are hints of vanilla which gives it a subtle sweetness. This beer its pretty thick and has an almost sticky quality to it, like the Breckenridge oatmeal stout, this is on the watery side though, very enjoyable and drinkable though, definitely a great beer to have a 6 pack of."
"overall, this is a decent porter, in my glass again? I am unsure"
"This beer pours a dark brown color. The head is a quarter inch in height, and recedes quickly into no lacing whatsoever. The aroma is of roasted malt and vanilla extract. The taste is similar. The vanilla flavor is very artificial, but there is just enough malt to keep in from tasting like I'm drinking a bottle of vanilla extract. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with almost no carbonation. Overall, this is a bad beer that I will be avoiding in the future."
"D - There's nothing subtle or nuanced about the components of this beer - they compete with each other instead of blending and complimenting. Way too much cheap vanilla extract. Bakers know a little vanilla goes a long way and this beer proves how easy it is to abuse the flavor. It's a bowser, and a porter in name only."
"D-- For a low ABV beer it was hard to get through. Not something to pair with food. Desert, yes. I thought it needed more to offset the massive vanilla flavor. When I have had on tap it is more balanced but not as good on tap as in bottles. One is enough."
"MD- A little thin in the feel. This is a easy drinker. I was expecting much more vanilla flavor."
"Appealing brown/red color. Coffee smell with a bit of sweetness. The malt hits your taste buds first, then comes the hint of vanilla bean flavor. Finishes very crisp and clean. The taste sticks around for a few moments which is enjoyable. Exceptional mouthfeel. Drinkability is amazing compared to what i would have guessed, but still keeps its porter backbone. Very smooth and its slight (not overwhelming) vanilla bean flavor will have me buying this again."
"Drinkability: Incredible stuff, almost perfect. I'm not sure how this brew would mix with an evening of food. There is a delicate balance of flavors that might not respond well with food. Overall a great brew."
"I usually don't like Breckenridge beers but I found myself picking up a sixer of the Vanilla Porter. I don't know why, I guess vanilla sounded good for a change. I was surprised to find how easily I was able to drink. There is no harsh bite. The smell is slightly sweet almost like rum cake batter. The taste is just rightin that it doesn't overwelm with vanilla flavor, just enough. I enjoy this beer and wouldn't mind having it again. Peace."
"Drinkabilitly - This is a very nice Porter. I will say that I really like the Vanilla flavoring mixed in. I wish the appearance would have been a touch better. It's the only thing that brings the score down a little. This is another Porter that I would be interested in trying again sometime."
"D: subtle sweetness, nice balance, enjoyable flavors. I've had some flops from Breckenridge, but this isn't one of them."
"Not much alcohol, so that's a plus for drinkability. The biggest problem with this beer is just that it's sort of there - not special enough to justify a return engagement."
"Taste is just not good imo. The vanilla is slightly artificial, and completely overpowers the coffee and roasted notes that were present in the aroma. No hop profile is noticeable. The lack of any other noticeable porter characteristics makes the vanilla become cloying pretty quickly. I rarely ever drain pour, but I only made it through about half of this. Not good."
"Totally drinkable, excellent round body and mouthfeel. Well done Breckenridge."
"I had high hopes for this beer due to the word ""remarkable"" on the label and was wholly disappointed. I expected something of a vanilla latte and got something more akin to baby back ribs. Blech."
"When I'm looking for a porter, this definitely wouldn't be my beer of choice. It's a good beer to try to get your pallet to understand the taste of what people are describing in a beer (especially vanilla). Possibly a beer to take to a tasting as an example, but would be a disappointment as the main beer."
"M - good carbonation level; perhaps a bit light for a porter"
"I didn't find any kind of bottled on / best by date anywhere - perhaps it was a bad bottle? It was bought from a very reputable shop, properly stored. Im willing to give this another shot (if i come across this beer again) and adjust my review if warranted."
"All in all, this is a decent brew. If you like light flavors with an overbearing taste of vanilla, then this is for you. Otherwise avoid."
"This is a drinkable beer; the style is closer to an English mild ale but as a porter it just doesn't cut it."
"D- I was really unimpressed with this beer especially since I'm a big fan of porters. There's a great chance that I won't have this beer again. Was unable to finish it."
"Certainly worth a try, and I suppose the name has nailed the pecking order on the head. Vanilla, then Porter."
"lack of head appears to be due to complete flatness. very thin body. lack of carbonation makes it somewhat hard to drink."
"This beer didn't blow me away or anything, but it's a decent brew that I could definitely session."
"Poured a very dark brown with a fading fast one fingered head with little to no lacing to speak of. Aromas of dark robust vanilla coffee. On the palette this brew was a chocolate, vanilla explosion on the tongue, Awesome! Medium bodied with desent carbonation. Two thumbs up."
"This beer pours with a beautiful, super dark brown (not black, brown) color. The ivory colored head has decent retention and leaves a very nice lacing around the rim. The aroma hits hard with the vanilla with just a trace of alcohol. The vanilla bean dominates the front and finish of this beer with accents of coffee and chocolate. Despite the intense presence of vanilla, none of the flavors are overwhelming or overpowering. One of the smoothest beers I think I've ever had; this beer feels good in your mouth."
"D: It was good and it was what I was expecting for the most part but I give it a good beer grade and it's very good for what it is. I guess it isn't that great because I really just didn't enjoy it as much as I had hoped."
"Pours a dark brown color that has a nice reddish hue to it with a thin creamy head which gives way to very little lacing. The aroma is of big vanilla over hints of coffee and light chocolate. The taste is much of the same vanilla flavor in a big way along with hints of coffee and chocolate. The mouthfeel is a little thin for the close with basically no carbonation. The drinkability is okay, it has a very nice flavor, but it is very sweet, I couldn't see you make it a session beer, but it is a nice change of pace."
"Slightly watery in the feel with a low level of carbonation. Lingering aftertaste of chocolate and seemingly fruity malt blended with alcohol. Easy drinking but not something I would have again. This would be a beer I would give someone who is not a fan of dark beer but wants to be ""eased"" into it."
"D - Upon further review, I will reverse the call on the field (dropped ball) and call it a good catch. It certainly has a time and place."
"It's ok but I wouldn't drinkk too many the vanilla begins to overpower at the end."
"More of the vanilla comes along in the taste, again, never sledgehammer like. Just right. A degree of wood mouthfeel with it, but not heavy on the palate, seems similar to black butte porter, but with some vanilla taking the place of the high hop ratio in black butte. Everything in moderation, this has just enough wood, vanilla, chocolate to it to make for a drinkable porter. Bring the price down though $9 is less than desireable."
"This is a rather easy beer to drink. That being said, there is not much that is really spectacular about it. I would not find myself buying a six-pack of this, but I would not pass up drinking it at a gathering if it was there. Overall, this is an average beer."
"Notes: Interesting tasting beer with a nice vanilla taste. Not too cloying, sweet, and not really artificial tasting. I liked this, but didn't really love it. One that I wouldn't mind every once in awhile, but it doesn't really enchant me."
"Pics at: http://wp.me/pNKWo-1da"
"Conclusion: It reminded me more of a black lager then a porter. I was expecting more flavor and smoother texture. For a porter it was on the lower end of average for me. I might drink this again at a bar if the options were limited, but I wouldn't purchase a 6pck."
"The body is decent. Carbonation level is higher than most Porters, but not astringent at all. This is definitely a vanilla-forward beer. Super sweet. Some milk chocolate noted, and a light roasted aftertaste, but this is really sweet. A decent dessert beer, but that's about it. I hardly could finish the one, let alone have another."
"It really has a nice mouthfeel too... not watery, good substance. A very well put together porter."
"Overall, a very well crafted porter. Extremely complex and delicious. Will definetly be looking for this one again."
"D - Never again."
"D: I'm not sure about this one. Seems like it's trying too hard. I've had it afew times now and still just not sold"
"I was a little worried about picking up a sixer of this, fearing it would be too strongly vanilla, but found this brewery's sampler pack so got to try four different ones. It's not too strong but isn't an everyday beer either. Sessionable."
"Drinkability: Easy drinking if you get past of the poor vanilla extract-like taste."
"D - Surprisingly drinkable. I sat down to have one, I found number two and three followed pretty easily."
"Wow! Thats all I want to say about this beer! Usually the flavored beers are aweful and really do not taste like what you would think they would. This beer, on the other hand is ultimately smoothe and refreshing! This is an amazing brew! Even if you do not like the flavored brews, this is the best I've ever had"
"D - This porter keeps you wanting more and more. I could throw back a couple of these with ease."
"D) Not a porter I will return back to..."
"Full bodied, warming with a light effervescence, Pretty smooth. A very nice brew."
"Overall - very good beer if you like Vanilla."
"D: A Porter that goes down easy and keeps you looking forward to the next sip and leaves you wanting another when it's all gone."
"D: I've been wanting to try this one for a while, and it did not disappoint. For any vanilla fan this would be right up their alley."
"Overall i was not impressed with this beer, very odd flavors and as i mentioned i do not care for the taste of root-beer and i kept picking up on those notes in there somewhere. which i love the flavor of vanilla in general, it is very intense and rich but it was not well mixed in this beer."
"Empty glass afterthought = Left quite a bit to be desired. Very light aftertaste. Olfactory senses feel left out."
"D - this is a pretty decent porter. Nothing too complex, but the vanilla adds an interesting element."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is roasted malt and chocolate with just a touch of vanilla. The flavor is much different. The vanilla stands out with some chocolate to balance things out. I also get a little bit of roasted malt but it plays second fiddle to the vanilla and chocolate. I also get a little bit of nuttyness in the flavor. The aftertaste is strong vanilla. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a deep Black with almost no head whatsoever. Nose is dark chocolate malt and vanilla. Taste is more of the same, but the malt flavors don't seem to be doing anything really interesting. The vanilla flavor is nice, but it doesn't really work without any other interesting flavors or aromas. It is a sweet beer, almost cloyingly so. Very light body, way lighter than I like in a porter. Drinkable, but unimpressive overall."
"D - It's drinkable, not really a bad beer, but just left me wanting so much more... not one I plan to seek out in the future."
"Served from tap into a standard pint. Pours dark brown with a slight red hue with a minimal off-white head. Maintains decent lacing throughout. The aroma is comprised of malt and vanilla. The flavor is of malt, cream, oatmeal, and vanilla. It was medium on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a nice brew. The vanilla note was a very nice touch that toned down some of the sharper flavors present making it quite enjoyable. This one is worth a shot if you get the chance."
"D= I love porters with a passion and I love vanilla a lot.... this beer however is not how I would do it. Too much vanilla and the odd wax taste just doesn't do it for me. I'm happy I tried it so I can have a better grasp of how the flavors would work together but this beer isn't that great."
"D - Well, I guess you can drink it, but I'd rather have a nice ""normal"" porter than this. Not all that great, no desire to drink it again."
"d - An ok porter. Thought the smell was a little bit weak, but had a decent taste and a great feel to it. Might try again but wouldn't really seek out."
"Drinkability is good overall. Its easy drinking and pretty tasty. Certainly one of the better vanilla flavored beers I've had so far. In terms of Porters, I've had better but its still worth a try and I would have it again."
"Drinkability is excellent. This is a very nice beer. Try it if you find it."
"D - Despite its faults, it is paradoxically a very drinkable beer. If you don't mind a vanilla porter that is neither very vanilla-ish or very porter-ish, combined with a low alcohol percentage, then I believe a couple of pints of this could go down well some evening."
"D- I could drink this like water but there is a reason for that."
"I liked it so much that I immediately scoured the internet for vanilla porter recipes. A few months later my homebrewed concoction had finished maturing and was very good as well. I'm looking forward to buying / brewing more of this kind of beer."
"Pours a very dark tea brown, which is surprisingly clear. Off white whipped head patches and sticks to the glass sides. Smell is sweet, milk chocolatey malts. Very pleasant. Taste is a nice wash of mild malts with a definite vanilla backbone, that finishes with a mild bitterness. Nothing over-the-top about this beer, but i think it's tasty and I really like the infusion of vanilla. It's like a candy bar beershake."
"Not a bad beer, but far from a favorite. I don't think I'll seek this one out in the future."
"Easy drinking, goes down smooth and makes you beg for another."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and fairly smooth, but with an average amount of carbonation. This goes down fairly easily, doesn't kill you after one, and goes well with a nice dinner."
"D - aftertaste and sweetness leaves me not wanting more."
"D/O- Unfortunately, I don't think I'd want more than one of these. It's sad but I've had this a few times and I always want it to be good... it just never is. Would like to try other Vanilla Porters out there to compare. Any suggestions?"
"Breckenridge Brewery's Vanilla Porter is one of a kind. I purchased a 6 pack. I just drank it from the bottle. Mouthfull was full and heavy. Very drinkable. Has that Porter after taste. Good with a Burger and Fries. Dont taste the Vinilla. I will drink this beer again."
"Nice flavor, but falls kind of short everywhere else."
" Breckenridge to me is another brewery focusing predominately on the big IPA and Amber market and producing a generic porter."
"In summary, although other reviewers may not have rated this brew all too high, I think that anyone that likes porters, even remotely, should try this immediately. This brew really is that good."
"Drinkability is quite high, but only because this is a lighter bodied, lower ABV porter. I can't say that I would reach for another of these, nor would I seek it out at my local store. Overall, a disappointment, since I'd heard good things about this brewery."
"I thought this was good overall porter, delicate Vanilla Sweetness, not overpowering, roasted malt, not a lot of backbone or hop balance, but good enough to get again, rather flat looking light tan head. I like my Porters Thick and Chewy, but I guess this was expected adding something sweet to a Porter. A touch of smoke would have made this a higher rating. Still another solid beer from Breckenridge."
"I think I'll be having this one again. It is a good one to finish the night."
"D - doable, but other options should get picked first."
"A nice sessionable porter. The vanilla works well and I would actually like to see more beers with it in a larger capacity like this one. All around solid beer that I would have again."
"Pours a derk ruby black-brown with less than a finger of light ecru head that doesn't leave much leacing behind at all. The nose is loaded with vanilla beans, relegating the roasted malts, coffee, cocoa, and caramel to supporting roles, but creating a delicious aroma nonetheless. The taste allows the darker aspects to return to the van, especially the cocoa and malts, while still keeping the vanilla at hand as an able auxiliary force. The lighter sweetness and darker porter-ness balance each other quite nicely. The body is a thick medium, with minimal carbonation and a rather smooth texture. Overall, a very tasty and highly drinkable sweet porter."
"A Dark brown color pour with a small light tan head , short lasting leaving some streeks of lace , Light carbonation . Aroma is roasty with some nutty malty sweetness and lots of vanilla . Flavor is quite sweet , roasty with almost too much vanilla for me , a bit of cream and chocolate , medium body for the style , watery mouthfeel , lingering sweet vanilla finish , drinkable but not really my thing , nothing really wrong with it just coulde'nt wrap my head around it , love your other stuff though ."
"This is a very accurately named beer - it is vanilla and is a porter."
"A decent porter and an interesting variation, but not one I would buy again."
"D: its good i would guess"
"Overall: I gave the taste low marks because it does not truly fit the style. In a blind taste I would never have called this a porter, but some type of flavored lager, or maybe a malty sweet amber. The body of the beer isn't even opaque, but instead dark amber."
"D - Delicious and easy on the alcohol. The sweet vanilla would discourage me from having too many though."
"The pitcher was awesome, we switched to Hercules DIPA afterwards- the pitcher was a perfect amount. Really drinkable, but not the all night drinker."
"Overall, pretty boring to me, lacks in flavor and viscosity."
"mikesbrewreview.com"
"I would agree with the label that this beer is indeed quite partakable. Remarkable however is a stretch and not a word I would use to describe it."
"Overall - a new fave"
"Too sweet for my tastes, i dont like spoonfulls of vanilla sugar."
"Take this beer for what it is... a nice ""treat."" It's not something you will want to drink all night long. But for a nightcap, or change of pace this beer fits the bill. The vanilla taste is not overpowering, it's there, but not so bold and overpowering that it seems fake."
"Very drinkable...I will buy again."
"Drinkability: Tom made the comment that it was not as thick and many stouts and porters, and I agree. It was smooth drinking, and tasty, but it didn't offer anything truly spectacular. Flavorwise I don't think it is as unique as it's made out to be."
"Pours a deep chestnut brown, with a solid tan head of tiny bubbles. The vanilla hits you right up front in the aroma, but there are also underlying scents of chocolate and grain. The vanilla is also prominent on the taste. It is noticeable but subtle at first, but the potency of the vanilla builds, especially as the beer warms. There are also notes of milk chocolate, toffee, and mildly roasted malts. The roasted malts can't combat the dominance of the vanilla, though, so the sweetness of this one makes it drink more like a brown than a porter. It's not very full-bodied, which would generally make me say that this one goes down pretty easy, but the compounding sweetness of the vanilla eventually gets to be too much for me, and I wouldn't want to have too much in a session. As a result, this isn't going to be in the regular rotation, but it is nice as a change of pace."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass. Darrk brown/ruby in color. Off-white finger head faded quickly. Mildly roasty with slight toasted notes. Mild hops and a nice hint of vanilla. Great balance between toasted nut and vanilla. The vanilla slightly dominates up front with almost perfect balance in the finish. No hops present. Slight carbonation, a bit thin bodied. Could use a beffing up here. Overall I enjoyed this porter. The vanilla is not overpowering and lends a nice touch."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a small snifter. No head and no lacing after being poured. Very little carbonation almost flat. Vanilla flavor is all but lost. Very noticeable tinny, metal flavoring. Flat mouthfeel because of lack of carbonation. Very disappointing compared to other times I have had this brew. Flavor doesn't live up to its porter profile."
"Notes: A basic porter with a very nice and welcome addition of vanilla. I recall this being better on tap but it is entirely drinkable and probably my favorite from Breckenridge."
"Not the best, but I find myself attracted to the sweetness of this one nonetheless."
"D - I love the idea of a Porter infused with some vanilla. If done correctly, the taste would be phenomenal. That being said, I think if a different brewery gave this a shot (maybe New Glarus) the result would be much better. This wasn't a terrible brew, but one that should be brewed a little differently in order to be truly great. It was worth a try and I look forward to trying other breweries interpretations of this brew style."
"Wow. I wasn't expecting Victory at Sea, but that was ""Partakable"" at best."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a coca cola brown with a reddish hue, decent frothy light brown head, good lacing. Aroma is roasted malts, nuts, coffee, and vanilla. Flavor is vanilla, caramel and roasted malts, and a touch of chocolate. Mouthfeel is thin for a porter, creamy, and a roasted bitterness at the end. Pretty good, a little too much sweetness."
"D- Decent party beer, better for cold winter. It's a heavier beer; I could also see this becoming filling after two or three."
"D - A fantastic porter - dark and sweet. Very filling, and the vanilla comes on a bit strong, however. Still, I'd have another one of these any day."
"Tastes pretty good. Smooth, creamy, vanilla, coffee, nutty...not bitter at all like I expected on the backside. Not great...but very decent!"
"D - I started out liking this, but by the end of the glass the vanilla/butterscotch flavor of the finish has become very cloying and kind of medicinal. There isn't really that much roast character for a porter, and this almost seems like an old ale to me. No freshness date, so I can't comment on the age of the bottle, but based on this sample, I don't think I will be tring this beer again."
"An easy drinking session porter. 4.7% alcohol makes this easy to drink more than one."
"All in all, this is one of my favorite porters to date. I tend to find porters a bit too watery and almost flat tasting, but this was great. This will definitely be my go-to beer for the style."
" This means it is very drinkable and pleasant; it is the quaffable version of sitting on a fur rug in a snowed in cabin in colorado under a snuggie. It reminds me of all things wintery and jolly; rather than being just another infused porter, it rises above it's competition to the top of the slopes. I would definately reccomend this beer, especially as an introduction into the dark side."
"D: Not bad, overall. The beer picks its theme and sticks to it. The low ABV makes it go down quick."
"Drinkability: Overall a balanced beer. Would go great with some vanilla ice cream."
"Breakfast is served."
"D - very approachable. hats off for taking a dry vanilla bean approach to this porter, in what could of been an overly sweeted disaster. good flavor overall with enough body to hold it's own. not the best, but drinkable."
"This one pours a deep, opaque sable with a fairly thick light tan head. Aroma is smoky and coffee-ish with an overtone of vanilla, a little like coffee with vanilla flavored cream added. Flavor is strongly of fine roast coffee with a sweet vanilla overtone. Texture is very smooth, almost flat and just a little fizzy."
"Notes: Worth trying and maybe someone else will like the subtle notes of vanilla, but I wanted a little more. Do not know if I will be purchasing this beer again."
"Not a bad beer though and I would buy it again. Interested to try it on tap!"
"pours deep brown with red around the edges. no head, just a thin, sick looking collar. smells of vanilla and sour milk. tastes sickeningly sweet, with the overt artificial vanilla taste. has a slight porter taste. much more roasted porter taste than a fresh bottle, but also much more sour and sweet. mouthfeel light and slick, maybe a little creamy at times. drinkability low. i could barely finish this. obviously, this beer is not meant for age."
"Its fine as a session if watery and clear porters are your thing."
"Bottle: Poured a light black color porter with a medium bubbly head with average retention and no lacing. Aroma of light vanilla with some distinctive sour notes. Taste was also dominated by sour notes and light vanilla. Body is really thin with some average carbonation. I don't know if this was infected but it really wasn't appealing to me."
"D: Pretty drinkable, not amazing, I'm still not THAT into this beer, but it's good."
"Hazy dark brown in color. Pours with little head and little lacing. Smell is a very mild roasted coffee, semi-sweet chocolate and vanilla. Whiffs of earth and smoke also present. Taste follows smell with a mild blend of medium roasted coffee, semi sweet chocolate, vanilla and sugar. Does indeed have a smokey and earthy quality as well. Medium bodied, on the thinner side of a porter. Decent beer, best served as close to room temperature as possible to get all the nuances."
"Worth a try, but not outstanding. A little syrupy for my taste, with a touch too much vanilla and an odd off finish."
"Clear, slightly ruddy, dark brown with a small, tan, foamy head that slowly dimishines to a thin film. Smells of lightly smokey, roasted malts with light vanilla. Taste follows suit, but with the vanilla MUCH more noticable. It has a medium-full body, texture starts out creamy, then gets a little syrupy, and then turn dry late on the finish. It's not a very complex beer. Not terrible, but nothing special."
"The mouth borders on thin, but it is silky. This is a once a month desert type beer for me."
"Overall, the beer is exactly what it says it is and I'm very happy with it. Would definitely purchase again."
"Drinkability is like the taste decent but not good enough to make you want to purchase more really. Vanilla is on light side also for a so called vanilla porter."
"Dark dark brown color with some redness against the light. Nice lace on the sides of the glass and swirling on the top of the beer. Almost nothing on the aroma, a faint sweetness that I guess is supposed to be vanilla but it's hard to tell. The flavor started weak but strengthened as it warmed up. A subtle vanilla flavor that isn't really all that pleasant and some mild roasted malt. Also, it kind of sticks to the mouth and given it's less than stellar flavor, it's not a welcome stickiness. All things considered a very disappointing brew, I expected more from these guys and this beer in particular but found it very lackluster. Very unmemorable and lacking any kind of direction. The flavors and aromas that were present were either uninteresting or unpleasant."
"Drinkability - I'm finding I'm enjoying porters so much that I may change my favorite beer type, but for me this is a beer that I have because the combination of flavors sounds interesting, but it's not an outstanding porter. This means that if I had to choose between this porter and another, I'd probably pick the other one. Not because I didn't like it, but because I want just the coffee and chocolates in the porter, not the vanilla so much. It's strictly a personal taste issue - some people like white chocolate, some people like dark chocolate. I like a normal porter but this Vanilla porter was a good experience just not my favorite flavor combination."
"I'd like to try this beer with various foods -- although there is a distinct risk that it would be overwhelmed by a highly flavored food. Recommendation: Pour this, let it breathe and warm before drinking."
"Cola appearance, brown edges, momentary light brown head that left a ring and a wispy centre with no visible carbonation. Smell was more dark chocolate than vanilla, there was a dry cocoa aroma. Tasted more like a vanilla flavoured beer than one brewed with vanilla beans per se. Bitterness lacking and no hop presence or astringency whatsoever. Mouthfeel was a bit silky yet syrupy. As I sipped on, this beer reminded me very much of a flat cola - featureless and uninspired. Finish was equally one dimensional and I couldn't be sure if it conjured up dark chocolate or vanilla extract. If one argues that the chocolate predominates, it certainly wasn't akin to a bakers chocolate as it lacked the bitter edge. Body quite thin for the style. Unfortunately, this beer did not live up to its promising label (which includes the advisement that it was brewed with ""real vanilla beans' - as opposed to ""imaginary vanilla beans"" I suppose?). This is worth a try, if only once."
"D- Not a bad brew, just wish the flavor and nose were a bit more intensified."
"wouldn't really seek it out again though."
"D - I was saddened by this beer because it had such an incredible smell, but the taste wasn't really what I was looking for. If only it tasted more smoothly of vanilla perhaps I would considering drinking again."
"Breckenridge's Vanilla Porter is most definitely not remarkable, as its label proclaims it to be. I love porters and I love vanilla - the two seem a natural match. I would have thought a beer like this would have a werewolf-like effect on me; I expected to start acting all unpredictably, howling at the moon and such. And I'm sure a beer like this can have such an effect - if done right and made well. This example was most certainly not."
"The vanilla flavor really hits in the aftertaste. A smooth and tasty brew with a light scent with a hint of malt. Only 16 IBUs and 4.7% ABV, which was surprising. My wife really enjoyed this one and she's not much of a porter fan. So, would definitely be one we'd get again for universal appeal."
"6oz sampling. Second time trying this porter. Poured dark brown with a slight red hue at the edges of the glass when held to the light. Fairly thin off-white head dissipates fairly quickly and leaves little lace. Aromas are sweet with scents of vanilla, coffee, chocolate, and some mild fruitiness - smells like a vanilla porter. Tastes are sweet with notes of coffee, chocolate and loads of vanilla that seems to be overbearing at times. Overall, it's ok in small doses, but I'm not a fan of the excessive vanilla flavors."
"D- not bad but it is thick and filling. It would be a nicebeer to cook with but im not sure about drinking on a regular basis."
"[As it got warmer more nuances pulled out. Probably needs to be served closer to 60 degrees rather than the 50 I had it at.]"
"Very little head, but a rich, dark brown color. The aroma was vanilla and some alcohol. The vanilla was a nice change of pace from the long line of coffee and chocolate stouts and porters (not that its bad). Feel was adequate for a porter. Drinkability was average."
"Overall: Like I said, this is one for the ladies. I'd rather stick to a truer porter or possibly a brown. BB, can we get a brown with some vanilla in it? I'd try it at the very least :)"
"Drinkability - When paired with the right foods the drinkabitliy improves a great deal. Really enjoyable beer, but by itself the vanilla can become a little overwhelming before long."
"Serving type: bottle"
"~Drinkability was high. If you like flat, chocolatey beers, you could seriously session this."
"Pours dark brown with light brown to grey head. Nose has a surprising smoky roasty malt quality along with the vanilla. Flavor starts out with roasted flavors, some chocolate, but then just like a spicy food dish that builds in heat... the vanilla bitchslaps you in the face and doesn't go away. It's like I'm drinking one of those flavored coffees, but I prefer plain black coffee, and now I'm feeling used and abused."
"Pours black with a small tan colored head. Mostly chocolate aroma, but there seems to be a slight underlying sour funk coming off of the beer, especially when you swirl it around a bit. The taste isn't really anything like the aroma, well other than the chocolate. There is a very nice milk chocolate flavor mixed with vanilla. There is a slight bitterness or tang but it doesn't affect the flavor. It is a really nice sweet milk chocolate dessert beer. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. The drinkablility might be limited due to the uniqueness of the flavors. It goes down easy though. I could definitely go for one of these with some vanilla ice cream or chocolate cake."
"D. Goes down fairly well, not the smoothest. I also drank it in a warm apartment and it is not the ideal style for the weather, but still an enjoyable drink"
"A little to sweet to be a all the time beer or maybe even to have more than one of in a sitting but very good"
"Mouth is like silk with a slight bite at first. perfectly carbonated with a good finish. Drinks easy even at room temperature. good, can't wait to try more from them."
"Breckenridge Vanilla Porter pours a very dark brown with a tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. I can smell some vanilla and definitely some malt. The flavor is roasty, caramel and chocolate and clearly some vanilla. The mouthfeel is a bit too thin. Reasonably good, worth a try."
"I believe this is the 2nd Porter I have tried so far and it was way better then my first. I'm not to fond of the thin mouth feel, but the vanilla in this beer was pretty good. I would recommend to try this beer at least once."
"D- I find this to be quite drinkable. Its not too sticky or syrupy sweet. There is no bad flavor left in the mouth. Its not big, in your face or super complex, just a nice easy drinking smooth porter."
"d - this is a very drinkable porter. It doesn't have the power of a exceptional porter, but it's well balanced and has enough flavor to be enjoyable. Definitely a sessionable porter."
"D - As a afterdinner drink it's very nice. Not a true porter by my opinion but still good."
"D- I would certainly have this again. I didn't find the vanilla fake or overdone but I think it'd be better suited as a stout."
"Not something i would ever drink again. It sounded more appealing then it turned out to be."
"D - vanilla can tend to overwhelm after a few of these"
"A bit too sweet to be really drinkable. An interesting beer to try, but not one I would drink on a regular basis."
"I first had this beer on draft at the Breckenridge Pub in Denver. It had me hooked right away. Since I can't get this beer in MD, I've had a few friends from out of state bring me bottles since. I've come to the conclusion that this beer is at it's absolute best with about 6 months of age on it. The Vanilla flavor becomes perfectly balanced with the chocolaty malt and the beer smooths out overall."
"D) So hard for me to drink. I need some kind of bitterness, something to balance it. Struggled through this one."
"very easy to drink with the low ABV (around 4.7) but the sweetness keeps this one from being a session beer to me....maybe 2 in a sitting would be enough"
"drinkability is good. nice balance, hiding the alcohol well. the vanilla isn't a small role-player, it's clearly the main attraction in this beer. a little too much for my liking, but if you love vanilla this beer is likely going to be great for you."
"Pours a clear dark brown, some orange hues, thick tan head forms, slowly settles to a thick ring, drops some decent lacing on the glass, looks good. Smell is nice, very raw vanilla bean, malty, brown sugar, some light chocolate roast, raisins, more vanilla, pretty nice. Taste is similar, tons of vanilla, chai tea, chocolate milk, light roast, raisins, some earthiness/wood, brown sugar, nice malty finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, sugary body but nice. I liked this, suppose you have to be into vanilla for that. Maybe more of a brown ale than porter, but I thought the vanilla was well done."
"Overall, not somthing I would try again, although I would like to find or make a good Vanilla Porter still..."
"[Drinkability]: Very harsh aftertaste, couldn't finish the rest of the porter."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with good carbonation."
"D: Nice, but not something I would do a lot of."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into my Imperial pint glass. Appears a translucent dark chestnut color with about a finger of creamy light ecru foam. Smells and tastes of vanilla extract, medium roasted grains, a bit of chocolate, sweet caramel and more cocoa and vanilla. Just about medium in both body and carbonation. I would reach for this porter again."
"D: The sweet notes carry this beer a long way and if I ever find myself in CO I'd love to try it on draft."
"Dark brown colored beer with a slowly fading head.Aroma is mostly chocolate.Taste is chocolate,vanilla,coffee and some toasty malts.Creamy and delicious.It seems to me that the vanilla and chocolate are balanced 50/50.Highly recommended and I will purchase again."
"D. Maybe a little too heavy on the Vanilla. Not a beer I could probably want to have more than one of. Not a bad dessert beer though."
"D - I really enjoyed this beer, the look of it says more of a Brown Ale to me, but the taste really made up and was something that I really enjoyed"
"D: Very drinkable. I would love to include this in my next tasting session that I host."
"well, I didn't like it. it just didn't seem like it had a deep and grand flavor. the feel is great, but the aromatics and flavor depth are lacking."
"I eventually paired this up with some locally-made artisanal chocolate (from Askinosie, for those interested) made with sugar crystals and vanilla. Interestingly enough, the vanilla in the chocolate served to (a) bring to light just how cheap the vanilla in the beer tasted and (b) provide the appropriate bitterness to bring the flavors of the beer back into check. In other words, the chocolate showed me just how bad this beer tastes, but actually made it taste better."
"A marvelous beer!!!"
"Drinkability: It's not bad, but nothing that blew my mind. A solid enough drink that doesn't seem to pack too much of a punch in the ABV, so I could probably drink a few of these in a sitting, just not sure I'd choose to."
"Poured a dark clear brown with a hint of redness, with a light tan 1/4 head, Possessed a malty, semi-sweet aroma with just a hint of the vanilla. A little weak for a porter in flavor, it certainly didn't jump out of the glass, again just a subtle hint of vanilla. Thin and watery in the mouth, I expect more heft from a porter. The beer also was underwhelming in the carbonation. Just an average beer"
"Easily drinkable but so are many other beers. Disappointing."
"Drinkability: When I first had this, I had it on tap in Denver at the brewery. It was excellent and one of my favorite beers from the trip. In a bottle it tends to lose something. It is a bit sweeter. I could drink several at the brewery...from a bottle I think one is my limit."
"D: A little overly sweet in a bit of a cloying way. Suggest you let it warm a little."
"Body is on the thinner side of medium. Appropriate carbonation, and a smooth drinker. The taste and smell are decidedly average, but my rating will end up higher than it should be because of the appearance and pleasant feel. It would be hard to put back too many of these before losing interest. If I had to compare it to another beer, I'd probably go with a watered down Young's Double Chocolate Stout."
"I certainly could not drink more than one of these, it is just too much vanilla, not the smokey complex kind, but the sweet overpowering kind."
"Average-at-best..."
"Overall: A new favorite from a brewery I have known and loved since its founding. Keep it up!"
"Overall this wasn't a terrible beer but I don't see myself buying it again."
"Drinkability: At first it was OK, but not exceptional. After a while, however, I was ready for it to be gone before it was and I'm not sure I want more than one. Nor will I come back to it again."
"It got a little better as it warmed up, but I can't say this was one I'd try again."
"Poured into a glass and formed a nice light tan head over a deep brown body, no staying power to the head yet light lacing remained to the end. The smell is sweet, sickeningly so with only a syrupy not quite vanilla odor. No evidence of hops or grain or malt or anything appetizing. The taste is slightly better and yet I feel as though I'm drinking Vanilla Coke's evil twin. Or Vanilla Pepsi's Mini-Me. And they wish to do me harm, They have assaulted my palate with flavors that no human should be subjected to. Yet, I shall persevere to the end, finishing this glass not knowing whether my mouth will taste again. Somewhere in there is a slight flowery taste, lost amidst proto-vanilla, hops maybe. Mouthfeel, well it feels like a porter, thinner than a stout and thicker than a good lager. Drinkability? No friggin' way. If the choice was between this and soda pop then the soda pop would be better choice. Hell, water'd be a better choice. Possibly the first drain pour I've ever encountered, or perhaps this would make an excellent birthday gift for my brother in law. Hmmmm...decisions, decisions."
"Don't drink and review."
"D: A very nice porter with a good mix of vanilla, toasted dark malt, and earthy hops aromas and flavors. Easily their most sessionable on-tap offering."
"Not a bad one to try, though not a great one. I'd give it a shot and it's not something I'd avoid. Overall a decent brew."
"Pours a dark amber/brown color. The amber is present especially along the edges of the glass. 1/4 inch head of a pale tan color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells strongly of vanilla, then some sweet and roasted malt qualities come through, and there are some slight hops noticeable. Fits the style of an American Porter, though an extreme vanilla enriched fringe member. Mouth feel is smooth and thick with an average carbonation level. Tastes very tart up front, which was slightly off-putting, but still not bad. The first flavors are vanilla, then roasted malt and sweet malt come through, and there's a slight hop background. Overall, besides the extreme tartness this beer would have been great, but otherwise an average brew."
"Overall this was not unlike watching Vanilla Ice on his own dating show, things that should never be. Remarkable, maybe, partakable, no."
"Dr: Nope. Kind of like a vanilla Coke, only much sweeter. I'd drink it again if my only other choice was Budlight."
"Decent, definitely more vanilla than porter."
"The first time I tried this beer a couple years ago, I though it was TERRIBLE. But I suspect that that was a bad batch. This one is better, but still IMO not stellar."
"D: This one is just okay. I can understand what they were going for here, and it's a nice idea, it just comes across a little less nuanced than I'd like. Perhaps because the vanilla seems artificial, something just doesn't add up."
"Conclusion: Eh, it's ok...the toasted marshmallow flavors/aromas are quite nice (if a bit odd) but overall there's a kind of ""fake"" artificial flavor to this beer."
"D: Very drinkable on a cold winter evening. It would make for a great sipper seeing it improves as it warms up. Might make for a great after-dinner beer... perhaps even with a cigar."
"D: One or two is tops for me."
"Pours a black brown color, small head, brownish. Very strong coffee aroma, some chocolate. Not very strong aroma. Strong coffee taste, watery. Not a strong coffee aftertaste. Just a good porter taste. Slight vanilla taste. But very watery overall."
"I could pound a few six packs of these and keep coming back for more."
"D: Not my favorite beer. It's certainly light enough for a session, but wanting more porter than vanilla, this one doesn't deliver for me."
"The beer fell down a little on mouthfeel and drinkability. The beer appeared to be a little thick, almost like syrup at times. Lacked some needed carbonation, seemed flat. The beer did give off a slightly sweet aftertaste, which was good. Overall, a good beer, but not the best representation of the style."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a deep, deep mahogany color with a one inch tapioca looking head. The smell definitely has vanilla to it, not a whole lot else is noticeable. The flavor of the beer is very smooth and neutral, allowing the vanilla to take center stage but not in an overwhelming way. Well balanced. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a velvety carbonation. Decently drinkable, I think the vanilla could get old for some but I think that it is gentle and balanced enough to make this a drinkable beer."
"Poured into pint glass. Pours black with a half finger of head. Smells kind of chocolatey. Taste is a mix of chocolate malt and vanilla. Surprisingly light mouthfeel. A little to bold to be very drinkable but 2 or 3 would be the max. Overall a solid brew."
"Future outlook: Decent drink. I won't turn it down if it ends up in my hands again, but I probably won't buy it again."
"The taste was vanilla with coffee. Pretty smooth, There is a vanilla bite at the start, then a malty middle with a slight hop finish. Medium bodied and can feel the carbonation on the tongue."
"Drink: This is fairly drinkable. Dunno if I would go out of my way to drink another. But its decent."
"I don't suppose I'll have this again. The sickly sweetness, almond notes, and cloying finish are bringing back that childhood migraine... I've had good vanilla beers, I love the flavor vanilla... but this just tastes cheap, imitative. Disappointing."
"I was quite taken with this beer, easy to drink and enjoy. I think I'll have another. Would be a great after dinner drink or while watching the game."
"ps. The vanilla taste almost a bit fake, I guess extracty, but its a good beer."
"Personal preference was Sonora Brewers Den Vanilla Porter over this one."
"Breckenridge's Vanilla Porter is not as ""remarkable"" or as ""partakable"" as the bottle boasts, but it is an okay beer. It seems more like a winter warmer than a traditional porter; whatever it is, the abundant sweetness prevents this from being enjoyed too often. If you're looking for a beer to pair with dessert, this seems like a good choice. As a sessionable porter it doesn't quite cut it."
"Notes from: 5/30/07"
"It's a decent beer, I think it could be called a womans porter. But I would if necessay drink best on a cold night, sharing it with your wife or GF. And could be something to pour with a chocolate beer, that would make a very nice mix I think. I'm just not impressed by this beer, but alot of Breckenridge to me seems to fall just a little bit compared to some of Colorado's other beers, like New Belgium, Flying Dog or Boulder Beer."
"Overall, the beer is a success. There were areas of the beer I wasn't 100% fond of but overall, it is a very solid beer that I enjoyed very much. I recommend trying."
"I really wanted to fall in love with this beer. Nothing entices me more then sitting with a tough potent porter on a cold winter night. Unfortunately, what we have is not love. It's a fling, best saved for impromptu meetings when the opportunity arises. There are other porters that I find more appealing, and would rather take a chance moving in with them and having them nag me about the laundry and the dishes."
"Easy to drink if you don't mind the sweetness. Not a great porter, but decent."
"Overall its a good American porter that had a hint of hops on the finish."
"Overall, this is a very unique beer, not something I would want to try again, but I am glad I got to try it once."
"Mouthfeel is decent. Overall, not a bad porter though a little too much vanilla for my liking."
"Nikki"
"On tap at Lindley Park Filling Station here in Greensboro.Poured into a standard pint a deep dar brown with some ruby hue to it,a thinner but well sustained off white head atop.Big sweet vanilla aromas mixed with some roasted notes,flavors are quite sweet up front with vanilla and molasses flavors, there is a decent drying woddy,earthy finish to keep it from being sweeter than it already is.Not bad but the sweetness up front can be a bit much though."
"D: This one is pretty drinkable for me. The only issue is the sweetness level that is not balanced at all. A few would work well as a desert."
"The appearence was the best thing about this beer. It poured a deep brown, ruby red with plenty of fluffy head and lacing. The aroma was surprisingly tart, fruity, with sour wine notes. The taste was very strange. Funky and a bit vinuous -much like a white wine. No porter quality at all. I suppose the vanillia dominated the taste way too much. Very silky body -much like smooth creme. When combined with off flavors, the body was quite nasueating -much like creame gone bad. Couldn't finish."
"I just had this on tap at the Pub at Crestview Hills, KY, and it is way better than when I had it in a bottle a few months ago. Not all BA's will like it since I don't detect any beer taste whatsoever, but what's there is delicious. On tap this tasted just like chocolate milk made with a lot of Hershey's syrup. If I didn't have to drive home I could have sat there all night and enjoyed several of these. As a fan of porters and sweet stouts this is right up my alley- chocolately, malty sweetness that I could drink all night, or even for breakfast. It looks great, but I didn't get much out of the aroma. In my book the texture and flavor of this beer makes it one of my top session beers."
"This porter was a real pleasant surprise. Too easy to drink for sure. I picked up just one - it's time to go back to the store."
"D: I enjoyed the beer, something different. It's good for about two but after that one would get tired of quickly."
"This beer has a dark brown opaque body with a little bit of a red hue depending on the light. Thick tan head that is very frothy foamy and has a lot of staying power. The lace was also impressive. The aroma is mainly vanilla and malt but there is a slight coffee ester to this beer as well. It tastes like almost like a burnt marshmallow at first. It has roasty and chocolate flavor that is predominant with a vanilla after taste. This beer would be a good dessert beer or evening sipper. It has a nice warming feeling to it as well."
"This vanilla porter is easy to drink and not too high in alcohol (4.7% abv) but the richness of the vanilla and malts may make it a bit too much for a session beer. Nonetheless, it's a very interesting porter and defintely worth a try. I just wouldn't have more than 2 in a night."
"Note: as a strange thing i have noticed this beer tastes remarkably good chilled. i tend to lump stouts into the group of beers that taste better at around 60 degrees but this tastes amazing ice cold with the vanilla bean taste being distinguishable and delectable to the extreme."
"Glad I got a six and it will go really fast."
"D: Pretty good...I drank 2 very fast but that was enough. It sure tastes good and is smooth on the mouth but it's filling! It's like dessert in a glass!"
"D: Easy to pound a couple of these. But, the sweetness will limit it to that only. Wierd, but, it really doesn't remind me of a Porter at all. More like a Winter Warmer...ehh, actually ALOT like Winters Bourbon Cask Ale from AB....Seriously."
"D- an unusual porter by my standards, its unique and intriguing taste makes every sip (or gulp) a new flavor expedition trying to find out just what the hell is going on in this beer. bought as a single and 8 rings of lace later, i doubt i'll have the chance to delve any deeper. something i would share with non-real beer loving friends."
"D: As I said before, this beer had an odd flavor, but it was definitely drinkable. Not for everyone, but tasty."
"Pours a light black color with white foamy head. Dessert-like aroma of creamy vanilla that makes the mouth water. A distinct sweetness hits the palate of vanilla ice cream and toffee flavors. Finishes quite creamy with a lingering vanilla sweetness of dessert proportions. Unique in flavor and pleasing."
"Drinkability: Interesting concept but not something I would want to drink on a frequent basis due to the underlying sweetness"
"I poured this beer into a proper pint glass to get the best look at its color which turned out to be a deep almost brown red. The aroma, while a little faint does have a distinct hint of vanilla. As for the taste, it's smooth and creamy. Easily sipped on and enjoyed on a cool October evening. Damn good porter."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is a cola brown color, with nearly no head to speak of. What small head there was left a rim around the glass but no cap on the brew. This seems to be lighter than the average porter. The aroma was of thick malts and burnt caramel. No hints of any vanilla as the name would lead you to expect. The taste was very disappointing as no vanilla to speak of and there was an odd after taste. This brew doesn't measure up to the preset expectation the label gives. There is a flatness to the brew and thin mouthfeel. Not likely to try again."
"D: I did not finish this beer. Why? Because I didn't want to. It is way off, and I want a beer to reaffirm my faith in craft beer. It seriously lacks the ""easy to drink"" factor and that's why I want to give it a low score for its drinkability."
"Taste: Wow that's pretty good. Sweet smooth creamy vanilla dominates the flavor but isn't overintense."
"Pours a nice brown color, nice carbonation, not much of a head, with minimal sticky lacing. The nose is malty, with some nice vanilla notes, and some spice. The taste is sweet, malty, hints of vanilla, and some spice. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a nice brew, thanks Bill."
"Vanilla taste pounds my tastebuds and I love it. Very smooth, very creamy, very sweet. Not really a porter when I think about it, but while some porter fans might hate this I have a distince sweettooth. The hops and spices are minimal but are there. Still, I could see someone easily deriding this beer as too sweet, and I myself couldn't have more than a few w/o starting to get sick of it. Still, a quality beer."
"Swiped one of my girlfriends. :-P Poured a medium bubbly head on a very dark amber. Smell was, obviously, dominated by vanilla, with some sweetness and caramel thrown in. Taste was along the same lines...I wonder if the vanilla is too strong for regular porter drinkers. I found it too be just a tad strong, but it did a nice job lessening the elements of porters that I'm not as fond of. A good brew, but again, if you're looking for a ""standard"" porter, this one's vanilla content might be a bit much."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, a beer I would love to order on tap and have a few of while at a bar with friends. It would be easy to talk about this beer, but it would not stand in the way of talking about other things."
"GC"
"D- While I couldn't drink this all night, this is a fantastic drinker that I'll remember to look for next time I'm at the local pub."
"full body with good carbonation. i like this beer."
"M + D: Fairly standard porter feel - somewhat creamy, but not as 'heavy' as a stout, moderate carbonation. It could perhaps be a little bit smoother, but that's something of an afterthough. It's a fairly solid porter, and while I not go so far as to quote the ""remarkable"" on the label, I would certainly have it again."
"An old favorite from my hustling days. This beer poured out of the bottle a dark brown with garnet highlights visible against light. The head was tan but only a finger thick and short lived. Good lacing. The aroma was semi-sweet, vanilla, toasted malt and hints of chocolate. The flavors were slightly sweet at first with dark chocolate emphasis, then toasted malt with vanilla finally coming through on the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth but oily and slick and an average carbonation. Still good, but honestly not as good as I remembered it."
"Overall, this is a good porter, but not a great porter."
"Was recommended this one by someone at work whom I consider to be a real beer connoisseur, but who has different beer preferences than I do, so I was expecting something good, but not really my thing. However, upon trying Breckenridge Vanilla Porter, I was pleasantly surprised to find a new brew to add to my list of favorites. The bottle opens with a very light odor of vanilla, but otherwise smells like any other quality American porter. Vanilla Porter pours a very dark brown with generous amounts of tan foamy head which gives way to attractive lacing. Flavors of chocolate, caramel, coffee, and hops grace this brew, with a light hint of vanilla that complements this delicious porter without overpowering. This is a creamy, exceptionally drinkable porter."
"This beer fills you up, I would not want more than one in a sitting. It has good flavors but not a session beer. I would pair this one with a dessert near the end of my night."
"D- Drinks reaaal good. sweet stuff"
"Pours dark with nearly perfect clarity when held to direct light revealing the richest garnet coloring I could ever hope to see from a beer. The head is two fingers tall and almond leaving no lacing,which is the only thing keeping this from a perfect score. The nose is soft and sweet with a vanilla pudding aromas. This is a great mix of medium toasted malt in balance with some unassuming dark cola sweetness,subtle vanilla on the tail. The body is full and velvety soft with a light tingly bite that does not disappoint,nice mouth coating sugars. A very nice Porter indeed."
"I was rather surprised by this beer. I figured it would be one of those overly sweet flavored beers, but this really wasn't."
"The taste and mouthfeel are both pretty average however. Its very drinkable in the sense that its thin, sweet and refreshing...what I think of as a nice ""summery"" beer, but not quite as sophisticated in its overall taste as many other top shelf porters I've tried. I think the sweetness tends to dominate a bit too much..."
"A very drinkable beer, but just not my favorite for this style."
"It's not a very complex beer but works well for being a mass produced beer that can be drank at anytime of the year."
"Drinkability depends on ones tolerance for sweetness in dark beers. I found it enjoyable for what it is, but certainly not world-class in the land of porters."
"D - Good cold weather beer that is a pretty solid porter"
"Overall this isn't a bad beer, but it's not terribly good either. I like a bigger thicker porter, this just does not cut it for me."
"D - Tasty, but much too sweet for my tastes. Almost more like a soda than a beer."
"Decent porter considering the odd vanilla powder taste."
"D- I had this beer with a chocolate brownie dessert and it really went well with the chocolate and just seemed exponentially sweet. As I finished the dessert and keep sipping on the brew I realize the mouthfeel is way too creamy. It's a good tasting beer but it's something you have to take your time with since it's so sweet."
"D - An awkward brew to be certain, but not necassarily repulsive. This is a fairly drinkable beer if you can get over the sweetness of it."
"Pours a dark brown into my pint glass. Smells a bit like roasted coffee and vanilla. Tastes like watered-down coffee with a really sweet vanilla aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a little too bubbly for a porter in my opinion. Overall I'm not a huge fan of this one. It's just a little too weak, and the over-sweetness of it would make it hard to drink more than one at a time."
"Relatively thin with good carbonation. 'Partakable', no doubt, but would I seek this beer out again? Negatory."
"This is a great beer. My only real complaint is that the vanilla flavor isn't as strong as I would have expected it to be. It's present, but it doesn't seem to stick out any more than the other flavors. However, this isn't a bad thing. If you haven't had this beer before, you really do need to try it. I look forward to trying other brews from the Breckenridge Brewery in the future."
"Drinkability is decent, I'm able to finish it but certainly wouldn't grab another."
"It seems to be the theme of this beer. It doesn't blow you away, but it's not bad either. It's just there, tasting a bit different, but never really does anything to wow you."
"M/D: Leaves a slimy and alcohol astringent feel in the mouth surprising for only 4.7% abv. The drinkability is quite awful, I have to choke this one down."
"The aftertaste is too sweet and kind of a turn off. The mouthfeel is a little too much on the syrupy side. The flavor is very interesting and worthy of a taste. However, I would find it difficult to partake in another after finishing the first."
"Overall- This is 1 tasty ass porter! Damn shame I only bought 1. Luckily this isn't too hard to find."
"This is very drinkable and would be a great beer to get people interested in ""dark beers"". On the lighter more delicate end of the Porter style. Overall I'm impressed and will definitely try again."
"This was a nice porter that had a lighter body than I expected. The mouthfeel is excellent, making this a great cold weather beer."
"Poured a dark brown, almost black color with a lovely tan head that fell quickly leaving some big bubbles on top of the brew and some good lacing at first that slowly went away as I drank it down. 0Roasted malts dominate the aroma profile, followed up by some chocolate and little hints of vanilla. Taste is right on cue with the aroma. Lots of roasted malts character, some coffee notes, a bit of bakers chocolate, and the vanilla character at the finish. Not so bitter, semi-sweet, nice carbonation. Slick and medium to full-bodied. Probably the better of the Breckenridge sampler that I bought weeks ago and finally got around to this offering today."
"Pours a deep amber/ almost black and a nice light tan head. In the aroma, roasty malt, lactose sweetness and a small presence of vanilla. In the taste, roasty malt, sweetness of lactose and vanilla, although, a bit watery. A medium to light mouthfeel and a sweet vanilla aftertaste. Kind of light, small hints of vanilla, yet a bit watery."
"D - I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. In many ways it isn't very porter-like, but the overtone of vanilla is a lovely component. I'd definitely have this brew again."
"I found this beer interesting and complex, but not really in a good way. Too many negative flavors and aromas."
"Altogether a great beer to have after dinner if you want to end on a sweet note."
"Overall I find it easy to sip and pretty good. The vanilla is really strong in this one, but that's what I was looking forward to. I don't think it's too overdone, and though it's mildly sweet, it isn't sticky or heavy enough to detract."
"Very enjoyable and balanced and very easy to drink."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable for what it is. Nothing too impressive. I've had better vanilla porters. It is still worth trying if you like vanilla in your beer."
"Body on the light side with a bland mouthfeel and undesirable drinkability. Very meh."
"Pours a light brown color with a small head that dissolves down to a fine film. Nose is tons of brown sugar, chocolate, and spices. Flavor is similar, with a stronger roasted backbone, lots of chocolate, caramel, and light dried fruit. Vanilla throughout, and a touch of light coffee. Body's a little thin, with very smooth carbonation. Not bad at all."
"Drinkability: This is a good beer overall. A sipper. It has a slight harshness from the alcohol that lingers but is overall a good drinkable beer."
"This was leaps and bounds better than the Pale Ale I just tried from a Breckenridge mixed 12pk. Poured a dark brown with garnet highlights and a semi- ""chunky"" oatmeal coloured head. Smell was lightly toasted cereal grains and vanilla extract. This was confirmed with the first sip as the vanilla flavour was quite prominent with out being too assertive. Mouthfeel was light and easy to drink. This seems as though it would be a good dark, flavourful beer to drink in the warmer months when folks don't typically drink this sort of beer. Certainly *not* a lawn mower beer, but I could see drinking this easily at a Summer gathering of some sort or another. I was quite pleased with this beer; appearance, smell, flavour, and ease at which it drank. My favourite Breckenridge thus far."
"I don't know if you can have more than one. Its either the flavor or the heaviness or a combination of both. But just 1 thanks."
"Not something I will try again."
"A perfect silky tan head. Not the darkest porter, but a deep redwood color. Nice aroma as well. A well balanced vanilla over a very decent porter. Tasty malt structure is complex yet nice and dry. Medium body with a nice carbonation. A little syrupy from the vanilla. A quality brew, just a little strong on the vanilla."
"Medium bodied beer and drinkable, somewhat smooth, but I probably wont bring anymore home."
"D - Not a bad beer. Sweeter form of a style I love so revisits are possible in the future when I need a change of pace."
"This is a great beer. This brew hits the glass nearly black, with hints of ruby around the edges. Small amount of off-white head. Decent lacing. The smokey roasted malts stand out in the nose, but vanilla and caramel aromas are present, too. Upon sipping, the taste is pleasant - nothing overpowering, with a somewhat woody flavor. The vanilla certain gives it a unique character, but I don't feel totally fulfilled by it - the finish is bitter enough to make it well-balanced but it's otherwise a little limp. The carbonation and mouthfeel are fine, and it's relatively easy to consume."
"Drinkability is nice. I don't think I would want more than one in a seating. The flavors are a bit strong to make this more than a one and done. But it's very interesting, flavorful, and well worth a try."
"D - A damn tasty desert beer. I wouldn't want more than one though. This has the complexity of hot chocolate and vanilla, and reminds me of a good coffee drink concocted by the best barrista at an Italian cafe, but lacks the magic necessary for a truly drinkable brew. The massive sugary sweetness detracts from the drinkability, but this is a really nice beer nonetheless."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"D - Decent I suppose, but I doubt I'll revisit this one. If they make a regular porter I'm sure it is damn good, because all the right makings were here, they just took it a step too far."
"Fair drinkability, I could see myself having a couple of these."
"Beer pours out a deep, dark color with about a finger of tan head. Lacing was decent throughout the drink. Smell was pretty good, definitely can smell the malts and a backdrop of vanilla helps to finish it out. Taste was alright, malty, with a hint of vanilla towards the end, almost tasted a little watery though, that kind of hurt it's rating for me. Overall though, the beer was smooth with light carbonation, and it was pretty drinkable. I didn't care for this beer a whole lot, I probably won't buy it again. It was interesting though to say the least."
"A good dessert beer. Great to drink right after a big dinner. It pours a nice black porter color with a two finger tan head. Right off the bat, vanilla, malts, and spices slap you right in the nose. The taste was very good. almost like a vanilla milkshake with roasted malts, spices, and big vanilla bean flavor. It was very easy to drink. It was thick and smooth. Very easy to enjoy."
"The body is a nice shade of ruby red with an average tan head. Good carbonation. A wonderful vanilla aroma greets the nose, but the vanilla doesn't overpower the taste. You get some nice roasted malt flavors and a slightly sweet finish. Overall a nice variation of the porter style. A good option for a tasting with friends."
"overall, do not waste your time much better beers for the money"
"The flavor is a bit above average, and better than I was expecting. The vanilla takes a back seat to sweet, choco-butter notes and a bit of coffee and dark fruits (think plums and fig). The aftertaste is harsher than should be for a 4.7% ABV, with a resinous, fizzy, bitter finish. Body is on the lighter side of medium, and a touch overcarbonated. Overall, this was a decent flavored porter. I'd probably buy it again someday, but not soon."
"The color is inky black, wit ha half-inch of foamy head. It smelt of licorice and molasses, which kind of anticipated a sickly-sweet taste. However, the vanilla comes in and saves it, adding in some sarsaparilla, and a hint of something else... anise? I dug the mouthfeel, which was creamy, like a scoop of ice cream was plopped in the glass. But this beer doesn't feel right for anything but sipping, and I'd recommend it for dessert."
"I have to admit I was scared when I saw ""Vanilla"" on the label. Imediate thoughts were of vanilla flavors overpowering everything else, but this is not the case. This is a really great beer to introduce people to darker beers. Not too shabby."
"D - Drinkability is average at best. The vanilla is just way too strong in this beer. There is nothing in the beer that really comes close to balancing that vanilla flavor."
"Smells of - guess what - VANILLA, no other notable smells - but it is pleasant - not too sweet of a vanilla smell. Taste of vanilla is very dominant, but there is also a slight hint of coffee. Bubbles are a little more than they should be (in my humble opinion). Except for bubbles, very smooth aftertaste. Is a drinkable brew, nothing outstanding though (I would drink another if I had it)."
"Poured a dark chocolate with just under a finger of head and very little lacing. Had a strange sort of chemical smell to it maybe a little black licorice, my wife said it reminded her of green olives, either way I did not get any vanilla out of it. Amazing first sip tasted exactly like vanilla pipe smoke then a toasted marshmallow followed by roasted malts and more vanilla. I really liked the strong vanilla flavor of this one and would definitely try it again."
"I'm getting very little aroma from the glass - some dark malt and maybe a hint of vanilla, but I wouldn't have been able to identify it without already knowing this is a vanilla . It definitely comes through in the flavour though. Moderately bitter, rather sweet, a bit like a vanilla and chocolate milk shake with added malt. Not really what I'm looking for in a beer, unfortunately. I don't think I'll be interested in drinking another one of these tonight."
"Tasted on 2/23/08."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"The initial taste reminded me of a vanilla/chocolate ice cream cone put into a milkshake. Definitely on the sweeter side of things and it actually has a lighter mouthfeel than I was expecting. The chocolate is present, but fleeting. The same story with any sort of toasted flavors, they are just barely noticeable. The bubbles that are left around the side of the glass feel very thin, kind of like bubbles you blow in milk with your straw as a kid. Makes me wish the head was a little more substantial. A sort of sour milk, sticky/clinging feel is left in my mouth. It's not an offensive taste, and not unpleasant... just a little odd."
"Overall I thought this was decent. Nothing really bad about it at all, just nothing here really blew me away really. I could have had another with a doubt. A solid call but its not gonna blow you away."
"Thin (although as much as I dislike the flavor, I suppose it could be worse if it wasn't so thin!) too spiritzy, again reminiscent of a soft drink. I'll have great deal of trouble finishing this one, and won't order another anytime soon. Sure, you could pay me to drink this, but there are so many better examples out there..."
"Another selection while at Gingerman, Dallas. Inky black appearance in my pint glass. Very thin head. Here's where it all goes downhill. Aroma? What aroma? It was barely perceptable. Don't you think this thing would be brimming with vanilla and chocolate malt? Couldn't detect anything at all. The taste was equally distressing. Only the slightest hint of vanilla and maybe a whiff of coffeee bean (moreso than vanilla bean). It tastes bland. This thing has no balls whatsoever. I even let it warm up and still nothing. I suppose its drinkable if you're into very mild, somewhat flavorless beer. A total snoozefest."
"D - I'm really taking to this one. Very subtle flavors individually, but together they work as well as peanut butter and jelly. Good transition or session beer, maybe. May get just a little too sweet, though."
"Happen to have this with some caramel corn and it was a descent pairing."
"Pours a redish black with a thin off white head. The smell is of roasted malt with hints of sweet and vanilla. The taste follows suit, starts sweet and malty with a roasted finish. The mouthfeel is thinner than expected, a bit watered down for a porter, decent carbonation. This is an easy drinker, not a huge amount of flavor, a bit disappointing, not the best out there. If it was thicker with a better balance it would be a better beer."
"Not a bad dessert beer, if you're in to vanilla. It looks a dark brown with an off-white head. Not much lacing, but there are more important elements to beer. The aroma is of vanilla and chocolate grains. Those carry over into the flavor, along with deeper roasted flavors. The mouth is on the dry side and a little bitter, but smooth enough. Like I said, a decent dessert beer."
"This beer pours a deep dark brown, there is minimal head. Smell is malt and a hint of vanilla. Taste is smooth malts first then the vanilla kicks in and finally a bit of bitterness. There is a long pleasantly bitter finish. This is another of the few beers I find nothing objectional, yet don't really feel like drinking another. I love vanilla, but really have had few flavored beers I like."
"Overall, this is a good solid warming brew that I enjoyed. The vanilla and porter characteristics and balance for a nice smooth taste and texture making it a good drinkable beer. Probably very good with desert."
"Not bad if your into a sweeter almost ""dessert beer"" especially one that has the smoothness of this porter. It is a glassy beer and has nice flavors but the vanilla is a bit too much for my pallet. I am tired of the flavors before I get to the end of the glass. No more then one of these a night unless you want to become a diabetic."
"Poured a deep, deep brown with a 1/4 inch head. Smelled of malt and a little bit of vanilla on the nose. The nose could have been stronger. Taste was of vanilla up front but not as much as I thought but the vanilla stays around throughout the taste and mouthfeel. Overall a good vanilla porter but it was to subtle on the taste for me."
"Glad I tried it once. Would NOT try it again."
"One is OK, more would be too much."
"[Served chilled in a bulb]"
"Overall an interesting selection. I love heavy stouts, but am only moderately interested in porters as they tend to be very bitter when brewers load them up with tons of chocolate or coffee or whatever. Not really a session beer for me, but something nice to sip on. Really warms you up, which I very much cared for on this cold Chicago night. Worth a try, definitely."
"I poured this ber into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was really black with a nice tan head. The smell and taste were sweet with a chocolate hit for sure. For my taste a little too much sweet vanilla though it did smell reall good. I will not buy again though."
" ~ I offered one of these to a buddy of mine a few months ago and he liked it enough to get his own six pack. I would love to try one straight from a keg sometime. Anyone know where I can find it on tap?"
"D: The heavy sweet and bitter limit the drinkability, but it's still a pleasant experience."
"Tastes and smells very similar with a rich but subtle vanilla taste. Fairly easy to drink overall with some noticeable, but light and balancing bitterness. Decent, I thought, and probably worth a rerate, since I've had so many porters since trying this and taking notes on it long ago."
"Pours dark brown. A thinner crème head doesnt stick around long. Uneventful nose. Flavor is kind of tangy sweet, but not overpoweringly so. Thin, but good malt character. A bit too much of a sugar edge, but its not too bad. Feel is a bit thin on the liquid, but decent still. Minor carbonation. Not too bad a drinker. I could go for more than one, but this might be a good beer to pair with food. I am thinking hot wings or some kind of spicy lamb dish."
"not too inspired to write much more than this right now, but i did enjoy this beer and it tasted solid, would have again"
"First try at the Breckenridge brand. Immediately upon pouring one finds the smell of pure vanilla beans. The taste is about the same with very strong tones of vanilla but that true to porter style of heavy with bright finish. Very very strong alcohol aftertaste lingers in the mouth. The pour is dark brown to nearly black. Light does not penetrate except to give the faintest hint of dark brown tones. Lacing was little to none on the small head that was created. Drinkability is fair given the style, it's not bad but yet not overwhelming. The mouthfeel is typical of a porter but with extra flavoring. If you're in the mood for both porter and vanilla and happen to see this then give it a try, obviously. A recommended brew, if at least for a once off try."
"I wasn't sure at first about vanilla in beer but I'm sold. Great job!"
"D - I love that it's not just a vanilla flavor but you can tell they use real vanilla beans. This is a great beer."
"D-Something different.I could and would enjoy 1 or 2 but not more than that.Maybe I'm not used to vanilla in my beer,but the smokey malt taste lets me forget that."
"I am not a fan of vanilla in excess, so I was afraid to try this beer, but the vanilla is balanced in well and this beer is fairly good for what it is."
"D: I liked it...not one I 'must have' again, mind you, but certainly worthy of a try. I like the addition of vanilla as a twist on the staid porter style. Low ABV helps with the drinkability, too - it's not too heavy and allows for either making this a session beer or having one and moving on..."
"Eric"
"I saw this sixer pretty cheep at Specs (under $6) so I thought I would give it a try. At first I thought it was a decent brew, but a little underwhelming. After a few tries I find it a little disappointing though."
"Like Avalanche, not bad, but not one from Breckenridge that I'll pluck off the shelf again, unfortunately."
"This was just a disaster. Besides the appearance, this was just about gross. I dont know what went wrong but something did. Chalky mouthfeel, dry finish. No good. I have five more of these to drink. Great!"
"Definitely a sweet beer, but it is what it is. You either like that or you don't. I found it fairly pleasant. Pours dark brown with a short head that fades. No lacing. The smell is redolent with vanilla, rum, sweet malt and some bitter hops at the end. Taste is similar, and ddefinitely sweet but not overally so- and certainly there are some hops to balance the sweetness as well. Lots and lots of vanilla and some oaky bitterness at the end. Creamy and smooth, I enjoyed this for what it is."
"I have to say, if this were a take on the traditional porter I'd have a real problem with it. American porters, however, have taken great liberties with the style, and this is just a further extension of beer style expression."
"The beer has good body and is definitely drinkable. Not a bad beer overall if you like things on the more ""toasted"" side."
"Meduim to thick bodied,syrupy with a bit a cloyingness. Was too sweet and syrupy to have any drinkability. could not finish this one. Was more like a cough syrup than a beer."
"Drinkability - this is a decent ale."
"I am happy I drank this as it definitely broadened my horizons. Lacks a quality base under the vanilla, but the flavoring itself is pretty well done. That said, I would not buy a six-pack, and I don't even really want another right now. I love pushing the envelope, though..."
"Medium heavy in the mouth department. A beer you would only have a couple of at a time. Not to bad, but I would have been more inspired if the vanilla would have shown through."
"The pours a somewhat opaque brown with red highlights, the head is light tan, creamy and 1 inch in height, as it rapidly dissolves, the lacing forms a thin but complete covering of the glass. Nose has a nice malt sweetness, backed by burnt toast, caramel, and the unmistakable aroma of Vanilla, quite pleasing to the schnozzle. Start has a nice malt profile; the vanilla adding a bit of sweetness and a touch of bitterness, top is light to moderate in feel. Finish has a benign acidity, the hops and vanilla adding both sweetness and a bit of bitterness, a drinkable beer, pleasant to the palate."
"Mouthfeel is pretty thin, and I'd like a bit more body to it. A bit too watery. It's quite drinkable, though, as the vanilla flavor is not overpowering or extract-syrpuy. I think this is pretty tasty, and it might not be the best beer I've ever sampled but it's unique and I'd definitely have it again."
"I'd drink this again, but wouldn't go out of my way to."
"d- the more i sip the beer the more i dislike it, it may be the last one i have, at first i enjoyed it, but the more i drink it, the more i dislike it,"
"Pours out nice, although a little light with very little head and very little lacing later on. Clashing aromas of the usual porter scent with vanilla and what smells like oak cask. The taste also clashes, between a burnt oak (not good) and vanilla (all right if it wasn't for the clash), along with a husky, burnt taste. It's not bad going down, but leaves an odd aftertaste and is a bit rough."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, slightly filling, very good representation of style within the style (while it's listed as an Herbed/Spiced Beer, it probably should be listed as an American Porter), this beer is one I could drink quite a few of until I get too full, but its still very good."
"D: I sampled this first at the Brewpub by Coors field in Denver. It was ambrosia! Peter, my new friend from Australia, and I exchanged raised eyebrows and smiles when we tasted it. From the bottle? The malt is strong, and the beer isn't as smooth and delightful and when it's on tap. Don't get me wrong. I ration this stuff. I can't get in my hometown. But I like it better on tap."
"Smell is weak, but mainly vanilla. Taste is unremarkable. The main flavor is vanilla, with some alcohol taste, but it is otherwise flat. Aftertaste turns a bit like cough syrup. Too sweet for me I guess. Not much carbonation, and mouthfeel is smooth, but thinner than I'd like. Not my thing. Overall, I'm disappointed."
"Personally, I think the beer is overly sweet, focusing too much on the vanilla and not enough on the entire brew. That's not to say it isn't enjoyable in its own way, but it seems overly expensive for the quality."
"Drinkability: Woefully weak and unappealing."
"You can tell this is a strong porter. The major flavor is vanilla, yet you can taste hints of chocolate and coffee beans."
"drinkable?: if you need some booze sure. not otherwise."
"This, to me, tastes more like a less memorable chocolate stout with vanilla notes than a porter--be a vanilla porter or not. Overall it tastes like a beer that just got halfway there--but didn't follow whatever direction it was taking."
"EDIT: I tried this beer again, and I think I had a bad bottle the 1st time. The beer has a very creamy mouthfeel and the vanilla jumps out at you. However, the taste is only OK. Tasted a little like cough medicine and you can only have one of these at a time."
"Big let down"
"Drinkability - It's nice that the vanilla doesn't overwhelm this beer like is the case with too many flavored beers. The sweetness of this beer is a little too much for me, though."
"D - I can't say it is the best vanilla beer ever, but a pretty tasty result with the mellow porter flavor. It might be better w/ a tad more porter in flavor, than vanilla IMO, though. Still very drinkable if you are in the mood for a smore or a porter or both."
"Pours nicely though a thicker head would be nice this would be an excellent candidate for the nitrogen widget, as the head on this faded rather fast. The color shows in nice deep ruby when held up to the light. The vanilla is definately apparent in the smell, and you know that you have to be fan to enjoy the beer. It's perfect as an after dinner beer, sweet, creamy, rich. The vanilla hits first, probably because of the smell, then caramel and chocolate malts follow, ending with a sweet creamy finish. Perfect for after dinner, though a little sweet to drink all night."
"If it's drank too cold it reminds of vanilla cola or root beer. It's not everyday beer material, but still, it's pretty great if you like vanilla. Good freakin' luck trying to pair it with anything but an equally indulgent dessert."
"Brew poured an attractive deep black with a nice clean smooth head. Aromas were of roasted coffee malts and a big vanilla presence was noted. Mouthfeel was great- nice and smooth, cooling to the palate. The taste was not up to par however- the vanilla was way too overpowering and destroyed the nice subtle flavors of the well-brewed malts. This brew would be refreshing if the vanilla was somehow balanced by some hop flavor or more roasted coffee form the malts. As it is now it is too sweet- vanilla should be a note, not the whole symphony. I cant really imagine being able to pair this brew with much of anything- but it may be good for some irish car bomb fodder."
"This was plesant. Appearnce was very dark, like drinking a pepsi. Decent head, didn't stick around too long. Smell was dominated by vinilla, as was the taste, with a sligh chocolate, and a little nutty coffee as well. Not overwhelming, but I would buy again, a nice, differant porter."
"Nice dessert beer, but wouldn't want more than one in a sitting."
"Beer poured a dark brown with little to no head. Nose is a pleasant aroma of vanilla and nothing much else. Taste is unbalanced, very heavy on the vanilla flavoring but not enough hop action to balance this out. Mouthfeel is very nice, extremely creamy and medium bodied. Drinkability is OK, but one is enough as this is too sweet. Fun to try and is worth a shot."
"Really looking forward to this one...after Breckenridge's amazing oatmeal stout, here's hoping I'm not let down. Pours a dark mahogony, almost black. Fluffy white head that slowly settles...beautiful. Smell is porter...hops and malt, coffee and cocoa, and of course, just a bit of vanilla. Taste is very similar, the hops fall to the back, with the coffee and vanilla coming out forefront. Not nearly as much vanilla as I thought, but it's certainly there. Mouthfeel is very nice, a little creamy, not overpoweringly so, very nice. Drinkability is amazing, but I have to admit that may be in part because the beer I drank before this wasn't quite as easy going down. I'll try this one again."
"This vanilla porter poured a deep dark brown. A small light brown head reduces quickly, some lacing left behind. Smell is vanilla cream, some subdued roasted elements as well. Taste is classic porter with the obvious vanilla element. The vanilla seemed to be more of an after taste, I'd have preferred it to be up front.The vanilla seems a bit too sweet, but is tempered by a hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and light. I found this porter fairly drinkable. An interesting brew indeed."
"Appears a cola brown caramel hue head simply billows above the rim of the glass tan light beige head color with great retention lacing spreads evenly around my pint. Aromatics powderd cocoa mild coffee tones vanilla cream air as well good mix mild herbal hop flow pretty straight forward a little ripe fruit notes peaking through as well. Flavor wise heavy vanilla extract tones among some dark chocolate roastiness but the sweetness is too much completely overbears the natural porter qualities hard to detect the hops with all that extract a flowing. Mouthfeel is medium bodied creamy carbonation definitely feels silky on the palate pretty good feel to it. Drinkability is a bit rough with all of that cloying vanilla extract going on in this brew I'm just not into it can't for see trying this one again."
"The beer poured a nice black that showed ruby highlights when held up to light. There was a thin off-white head that slowly diminished. The aroma was was a good blend of chocolate and black malts with vanilla coming through nicely. The taste was vanilla dominating the usual Porter flavors that were lingering in the background. The taste balance provided a nice smoothness that made this a very enjoyable Porter on a hot Summer afternoon. This is a very enjoyable beer that I'm certain I'll enjoy even more this Winter."
"Many of the vanilla porters I've tasted have been over-done with vanilla extract that tends to build on the palate and lead to a nasty finish. This one, however, is at least a little bit more nicely balanced. The vanilla definitely makes it's presence known amidst the mildly roasty, chocolatey, and lightly caramelish character of the malt, but it doesn't cover them up. And it lingers nicely in the finish, without becoming too ""artificial"". The beer is well made and has a good appearance and head retention. As for drinkability, I still think that the vanilla has to hinder it on a volume scale (ie. it's kind of a one and done beer), and I don't think that it adds enough character and flavor to REALLY make you want to have one (ie. along the lines of a Sam Adam's Triple Bock). However, it's still pleasant enough throughout a single glass, and I'd enjoy having one during a night out with the lads or with dinner. I wonder how this might pair with something like honey-glazed wings, or potato pizza? I think it has the potential to work as more than just a dessert beer. Interesting."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. The beer pours a deep brown, forming a very thin mocha head. Very few spots of lace. The aroma is dominated by the vanilla with slight notes of roasted barley coming through. The taste is also heavily dominated by the vanilla. A light coffee/chocolate flavor is present, but most of it is swept up by the vanilla. Medium bodied mouthfeel, and smooth finish. Good abv. and decent flavor can make this a sessionable ale, if you like your beer sweet. Overall, I thought that the porter qualities and the vanilla just were not a good combination. It makes for an interesting flavor combination, but not enough of the porter flavor was apparent. Maybe if a little less vanilla was used? Dont get me wrong, some beer styles benefit from vanilla being added (I love the Vanilla Creme Ale from Blackhorse), but IMO it doesnt work as well here. Just my two cents. Maybe I just need to try it more often, and let it grow on me. To be reviewed again..."
"A pleasant porter with some interestingly pleasant and likable things going on. Not cloying by any means either."
"A very interesting beer. The vanilla is very apparent and maybe a tad over-stated. Has a creamy mouthfeel that is smooth and very drinkable, there is a slight after-taste but its not bitter like some porters are. I got this bottle of Vanilla Porter at Capone's Restaurant out-side of Norristown, Pennsylvania. Big sellection to choose from, still finding my way."
"Pours a deep redish brown color with a moderate cocoa brown head that dissipates quickly. The nose is of dark roasted malts and a slight vanilla note. The palate is sweet upfront, with a strong vanilla flavor that tastes almost artificial. The sweetness gives way to a slightly dryer hop finish, though it remains quite sweet throughout. Mouthfeel is this ...maybe a bit thin for a Porter ... moderately carbonated. A nice beer to sample, or perhaps to enjoy along with a dessert, but a tad too sweet on it's own to enjoy in any quantity. I'd say a little easier on the vanilla bean and a little better malt/hop balance would make this a truly good vanilla porter."
"Good mouthfeel, finish even and showcases the vanilla fullness, just the tiniest hair minty. An okay dark ale, for a robust porter fan I can't recommend but for those looking for different flavors in their brew here's a vanilla bean option."
"My least favorite brew from Breckenridge but have to appreciate it for the style. Maybe enjoy again someday with a good cigar, would make a GREAT partner in crime on that one."
"Pours red-edged dark brown with moderate carbonation. The tan head is quick-to-subside, leaving no trace and only faint lace. Rather cola-like in appearance. The smell is a little weak but pleasing. Nutty caramel and vanilla beans dominate, with toasted bread notes supporting. The flavor is a bit of a hodgepodge. Sweet malts and vanilla develop into a rough grain and lightly-hopped center. The finish features bitter roasted coffee, but this is nearly ruined by artificial-tasting off-notes from the vanilla. Body is light, somewhat limp and lifeless. Easy to drink, but not very well executed."
"The beer advertises itself as never duplicated. After drinking it, I'm not sure it should be. There's definitely room to improve upon it though. A great idea with average execution."
"The beer has a good dark ruby color. A bit light for a porter, but it looks really nice. The aroma is all vanilla. Just like smelling a bottle of vanilla extract, only it's artificial smelling. There is a sweetness to it that I can only associate with artificial extract. The flavor is similar to the aroma seems very artificial. It has relatively high carbonation and almost tastes and feels more like a vanilla soda than a beer. I'm not crazy about this beer."
"A very interesting take on the porter style, and one worth trying."
"Drinkability: Very, very drinkable. I'm not getting overpowered by vanilla like some here. It's not a bad porter...just not exactly what I like in one. Still, it's highly quaffable and pretty accessible in terms of flavor."
"Dark reddish-brown color with a medium thick tan head with decent retention. The lacing is pretty good, it coats much of the glass. Strong vanilla aroma along with some chocolate and malt. Medium body, smooth with just a bit of carbonation. Flavors of vanilla bean, roasted malt and more chocolate. The finish maintains the vanilla theme, with a nice nutty flavor in the aftertaste. Unlike a lot of Breckenridge beers, I would actually seek this out to try again."
"I let this one warm up to about 60 degrees F, and vigorously poured into a tumbler. A nice dark tan head that fades to a film but never disappears. Dark brown beer, ruby when held up to the light. Aromas of caramel and roasty malts, and a hint of alcohol. The vanilla aroma was undetectable at first, but it came through after it warmed up a bit more. A very nice porter, smooth and caramely, with the vanilla giving it an almost cocoa like flavor. A hint of hop bitterness on the finish keeps the sweetness in check. The mouthfeel is outstanding. Perfect carbonation and viscosity, it's like buttah. This beer is pleasant and quite drinkable, with the vanilla only serving to enhance the flavors, rather than taking center stage. Very tastefully done and ""partakable""."
"This beer pours very dark with minimal head. The taste consists of coffee, vanilla, and toast. It has a creamy mouthfeel and is only moderately drinkable. Very good session beer as it didn't mess up my palate like some other stouts and porters. Very good experience with this beer."
"After my first few whiffs I feared this would be one more beer with an add-on flavor in its name that failed to deliver on its promise. After a taste, though, that fear was dispelled, as the vanilla is not only present, but also a surprisingly cogent companion to the rest of the beer's flavor profile. The light character and tastiness combine to make it nicely drinkable. Bravo to Breckenridge for blending the vanilla the way a good flavoring should."
"I really, really like things that have vanilla in them, so take my rating numbers with a grain of salt -- or a vanilla bean, as the case may be."
"This is a nice dessert beer. The sweetness would be too much for me for more than one. I enjoyed this quite a bit."
"I decided to keep going of course, but could not finish the entire glass. This is a rarity for me as I am sure it is with most of you. I have no idea how everyone is giving this such high scores, and I am wondering if I got a bad batch or porters just arent my thing?"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied, nicely carbonated, and very drinkable. Low abv makes this even more drinkable. It's not a beer I'd regularly session, but I could drink a few and be happy to do so. Overall, very nice effort. I like it and would recommend it."
"Drinkability - Light body, sharp at first but went down easy."
"This beer pours a very dark black color that only turns transparent when its held up to the light. There is little to no head. The smell is sweet, and it is possible (with some teasing) to get a vanilla out. Taste is malty with a burnt overtone. Robust, but there seems to be a lack of real diversity in the tastes themselves... all pretty generic burnt-and-sweet notes. This beer does go down quite easily, and I could see myself ordering it a good amount if it was available in my area."
"Super-smooth mouthfeel and deceptively drinkable. I highly recommend this beer. Very unique and enjoyable if you are a vanilla fiend."
"Poured a nice golden brown, but whatever head it had disippated almost immediately. I'd like to see what it pours like from a tap. Bringing the glass to my face I'm immediately hit with the vanilla tones - sweet, but not overpowering. The taste is sweet and full of vanilla flavor, followed by a pleasantly mild bitter aftertaste. Probably a bit too sweet for most, but I thought it tasted pretty gosh darn good. Mouthfeel - a bit more watery than I'd like, but the carbonation made up for it. It was almost like drinking a soda pop that had been left open for about an hour. Pour this, drop a scoop of vanilla on top, and you're golden. As for drinkability - I could see having one or two at a time, but not more than that due to the sweetness. I will pick it up again if I can find it."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with a small off-white head. There's a little bit of lacing, but head retention is low. It smells like sweet malt, grapes/raisins and vanilla. The taste is mostly sweet too, just like it smells except there's some caramel and nuttiness in the taste too (but vanilla is the strongest). There's also a slight bitter grassy hop aftertaste, but it doesn't linger around for too long. Mouthfeel is creamy and a little bit slick, with medium body. Drinkability is OK, but there's a bit too much vanilla for me to drink more than 2-3 of these at a time. It's more of a dessert beer for me. Overall, I think it's decent. Not too bad of a choice at all."
"The pour into my Sam Smith glass raises a voluminous two-finger plus head that unfortunately starts falling right away, but does so with a lot of very large bubbles bursting. The head leaves some very fine lacing. The body is even a little transparent: when backlit, it is a very deep ruby. A very attractive beer. The nose smells very much like vanilla, with definite, though mild, roasted accents. It's pretty straightforward and light, really. Well, on the first taste, I'm quite surprised. This beer really goes over the top with vanilla flavor. It's very sweet, and almost completely dominates the roast that I picked up in the nose. You have to REALLY like vanilla for this to work for you. It doesn't taste like any porter I've ever had, but I actually like this a lot. It would be a bit better if they toned it down some, but I'm glad to see a brewery go crazy with extra flavors sometimes. The mouth is quite smooth, with hardly any noticeable carbonation. This might be too sweet for more than one, but I like it. It could probably make a really killer vanilla beer float."
"I couldn't handle the overt vanilla sweetness of this beer, it tastes too much like artificial flavoring. No balance at all. I'm glad they classify this as an herbed/spiced beer because it doesn't make much of a porter. Not recommended..."
"Overall - Good / Very good. Enjoyable in small doses. Closer to a vanilla/malty treat than a porter - by design. A great beer for a special occasion."
"I really enjoy this beer a lot. Not being a hops kind of guy, this beer works out well for me. At first I didn't know what to expect, and was more or less assuming a classic porter with a hint of vanilla at the end. I was (pleasantly) surprized to find the vanilla aftertaste pretty strong, as I have a problem with flavored beers when one can barely taste the flavoring (most of them). I really like the flavor and all, but the sweetness would get to me after a few of them"
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Mouthfeel on this beer is great. It has a silky smooth creamy feel to it along with a nice full body. Carbonation is low which benefits the porter side of this brew, but the vanilla flavor would benefit from higher carbonation levels. The beer is easy to drink but in my opinion it is just to fickle in its flavor profile for me to want to buy it again. Sure I enjoy it, but I don't immediately want to go out and buy more of this beer. Its so-so."
"Poured from a bottle with a bottled on date of 12/3/06. Pours out a cola brown color with lots of clingy bubbles on the side of the glass. It's topped by a lite brown head about a finger high. the aroma is vanilla spiced along with a taste very similar. Nice roasted malts with a vanilla bean flavor. This is a vice winter warmer."
"Ok, but I dont think I could drink more than one."
"Breckenridge definitely delivers a Vanilla Porter as I would expect a vanilla flavored Porter to be. Its not great, but not bad, and quite enjoyable. I suggest toning down the roasted barley and focusing more on bittering hops. There is plenty of bitterness, but it is too harsh. Also the hop content is nicely understated and could be beefed up a tad."
"Overall, I don't find this very drinkable, and I probably won't purchase this again. I would be interested to know if Breckenridge used vanilla extract or natural vanilla beans when brewing this porter. Based on my observations, I suspect extract. However, I'm not convinced that vanilla wouldn't work with a porter which may lead me to experiment with homebrews using this combination."
"Drinkability: I was a little worried at first, but this is a drinkable beer. A decent porter with some vanilla flavors. However, I will probably stick with my Empyrean Ales' Darkside Vanilla Porter over this as the Darkside is local, cheaper, and slightly better."
"This was fairly drinkable, would recommend it to anyone who likes vanilla cola, which thankfully I do. Unfortunately onesided in presentation, with strong flavours of vanilla overwhelming the rest of this beer. Glad I tried it, let me know if they reconfigure this one and use about 1/4 of the vanilla bean in future versions."
"Deep, dark and black. Topped by a ivory cap thatis leaving a sticky trail all around. Big ol whiff of vanilla, chocolate and malt. Good grief, is this thing rich and creamy, like drinking a chocolate malt shake. It does tend to dry out towards the bottle end. Quite a treat, but for drinkability, its a tad on the sweet side. But I guess when you have a porter, and add vanilla  what do you expect? Id like to have a few more of these, and will keep an eye out for them."
"Not bad, but not great. I'm sure many people will find this beer too sweet. Like Vanilla Coke, most of the flavor is with the vanilla and not so much with the original product. There is very little porter to this beer. Still, it's something some may like so it's worth a try."
"Paid $6.99 for a growler refill at Liquor Barn Hurstbourne"
"D - This is a very unique beer. At first sip I wasn't sure if I'd like it but it gets better as it warms."
"A vanilla porter sounds like something I would enjoy. It's too bad this winter seasonal isn't very good. I have no idea where the fault lies, but the beer tastes fake. Never mind the word 'partakable' along the bottom edge of the label. I won't be partaking of Vanilla Porter ever again."
"D - A very drinkable beer, but I honestly don't know that I could drink a lot of this in one sitting. The vanilla is good but after one pint it leaves me wanting some more traditional beer flavors."
"Overall - I've had this beer a few times, and it never dissapoints."
"Pours a jet black (it is a porter) with minimal head. looks slightly light, definitely not thick or chewy. Very mild vanilla essence. i was worried that flavor would overwhelm, but it didn't. a bit thin on mouthfeel (this seemed to be the trend of this night's session). i think i agree with other reviewers that it is a perfectly drinkable beer,but not one i would drink often."
"Drinkability: A flavorful and slightly sweet drink, without being cloying. Not as bitter or full bodied as I expect from a porter, but a good mix nonetheless."
"Pours dark and thick with a good thick head. There's a whole lot of caramelized sugar in the smell, probably enhanced by the significant vanilla scent. Tastes the same too, lots of sweet caramelly (is that a word?) malt, though it could have some more vanilla. Feels slightly thick on the tongue, which is perfect for the taste, but the vanilla and carbonation work together to give it a delightfully sharp nose as you swallow. It's too thick to drink more than a couple at a time, but that's the only thing keeping me from drinking more."
"This 12oz bottle pours a very clear, nearly black color with deep ruby hues when held to the light. A thin off-white head formed that had little staying power. There are hints of vanilla in the aroma as well as a low roasted quality. I cannot find much in the way of hop aroma. The flavor of the beer is slightly sweet, the vanilla is a nice accompaniment, but not overwhelming and there appears to be a bit of alcohol warmth at the swallow, which is surprising since the ABV is listed at 4.7%...maybe the roasted grains coming in? There is also a little bit of roasted flavor shining through. The hop bitterness is moderate-low, it provides a nice balance, with little or no hop flavor. The mouthfeel is rather full-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a nice smoothness to the swallow. Overall this is an enjoyable beer. I think taste is very good, the sweetness is enough, but not overwhelming, and the same can be said of the vanilla. I was hoping for a little more in the aroma department, that is probably my only, small criticism. The beer has very good flavor, nice smoothness, and just a little warming quality at the end."
"A fairly thick mouthfeel. Nice and smooth, but broken up well by a proper level of carbonation. Very drinkable considering the vanilla flavoring (that is from real vanilla beans according to BB). 4.7 ABV helps with the drinkability."
"D: Very easy to drink with a great flavor and not too high on alcohol. I enjoy the lingering vanilla and it could compliment many foods. Would drink this pretty much anytime but there are alot of much better beers that would come first."
"drinkability takes a big hit, due to the unbalanced flavor profile. one of these is a very enjoyable experience, but 12 oz. is enough for quite some time. it definitely doesn't leave you wanting another right away."
"This brew hits the glass nearly black, with hints of ruby around the edges. Small amount of off-white head. Decent lacing. The smokey roasted malts stand out in the nose, but vanilla and caramel aromas are present, too. Upon sipping, the taste is pleasant - nothing overpowering, with a somewhat woody flavor. The vanilla certain gives it a unique character, but I don't feel totally fulfilled by it - the finish is bitter enough to make it well-balanced but it's otherwise a little limp. The carbonation and mouthfeel are fine, and it's relatively easy to consume."
"Bitterness starts to show more towards the end. Quite tasty though. Would go GREAT with a creme brulee."
"Medium bodied, smooth and easy to drink, A bit sweet, but could go well with deserts or just as desert."
"A whiff of artificial vanilla extract in the aroma. Moderate roasted malt body, a touch thin in the mouthfeel. Light, reserved, aromatic vanilla note in the flavor, not as prominent as I expected. Very little sweetness to the beer, another surprise, as I thougth this would be more of a dessert beer. Really a basic porter, with some light vanilla adjunct notes. Nice enough, but not impressive."
"D- A nice beer to have after a long day at work, but it would be difficult to have more than one."
"Pours into a pint glass with a deep blackish brown body and a solid inch of rich tan head that stays well. Nose holds light vanilla tones with a strong backbone of burnt malt. Enters the mouth with a rich mineral like sweetness. But as that settles you start to wonder where the vanilla is. The palate does have a hint of mineral infused vanilla but the real presence is on the finish. Burnt tar like malt glazes the mouthfeel. Needs to be more balanced to increase drinkability."
"Interesting...but probably not again."
"Medium body, fairly drinkable, but some unpleasant flavors going on."
"Vanilla Porter was dark brown in color with a tan head. The head was medium in size with decent retention and left some lacing behind. The aroma was dark malt, vanilla, and a little chocolate. The taste was full of sweet and toasted dark malts with the vanilla very evident. It is a smooth, medium to full bodied beer with fairly low carbonation. The drinkability is good, but the sweetness would get to you after a while."
"Flavor is definitely vanilla. This is not the world's best porter that the good folks at Breckenridge merely added vanilla to. Rather, the vanilla seems to really finish the base beer. Very good."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass longneck bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Not my favorite from the folks at Breckenridge, but very much what I anticipated."
"So, not my cup of tea. It's okay only if you really don't like darker beers but want to look ""trendy"" and drink a dark beer with sweet flavor and little else to offend, this may be worth a try."
"Dark, opaque. Short head, decent lacing. Looks kind of like a darker Coca Cola. Smell was excellent, roasted malt and a distinct vanilla to it. Taste was vanilla upfront with a malt sweetness you can't miss, not terribly complex. The mouthfeel was far too thin, almost watery. Overall, not bad at all. Not for everyday consumption, but I can see myself wanting one of these again sometime."
"Pours a dark ruby brown color with a short tan head that soon fades into a thin lace. Nose is mostly cocoa with only a faint hint of vanilla in the background. Taste is sweet chocolate malts along with a cream soda like vanilla flavor. The vanilla characteristics in both the aroma and taste become more pronounced as the beer warms. You could do some interesting dessert pairings with this beer. Thanks to allengarvin for the sample!"
"This beer still manages to please, besides a few flaws. This is an excellent beer to let anyone who enjoys vanilla, the chance to try. Definitely give this one a try, at least once."
"No surprise that the aroma from this is pure vanilla bean. The color is dark and smooth. Some chocolate scents are in there too, along with the malt base. I was surprised how thin the mouthfell was. I was expecting something more thick - more of a hearty after dinner beer. It was awful sweet, perhaps great after a long day of skiiing, but I wasn't in love with it right now."
"From the bottle. poured a reddish brown with a tan head. aroma chocolate. malts, nutty, and what elae but vanilla, nice sweetness. flavor was a little surprised that the vanilla came out first, than sweet chocolate the malts and nuttyness where a lttle hard to get but did come out after it warmed."
"This pours with a thick tan head that quickly dissipates into some thin lacing that sticks to glass quite well. The color is a dark brown with red highlights. This brew has a chocolate aroma with strong hints of vanilla. Has a very sweet taste with strong chocolate flavors and a vanilla aftertaste. I thought this to be a great sipping beer,but not one that I could drink 3 or 4 of in a sitting."
"Overall Impression: A bit of a gimmick beer, Im surprised I enjoyed it as much as I did. Its not overdone, but its very close. If you like vanilla, this is your beer."
"Pours pitch black with a short-lived tan head. Leaves a bit of lacing, with no real head retention. Smell is promising although subdued. Normally, my complaint with flavored beers is that the flavor is too obtrusive but with this one its just the opposite. The vanilla, which would do wonders to balance the dark, sharp porter flavor, is not pronounced enough to do the job. A good flavor, and a decent porter, although perhaps in not succeeding as a flavored porter it is left not trying enough to be a good porter. Mouthfeel is thin and a bit...gritty? Not actual sediment but just a vague feeling it leaves me with. Drinkable, it goes down easily and more could follow. All in all, nothing spectacular but not too much to complain about & a great combination of flavors, if not quite balanced."
"scarlet brown with nice solid head. odor like plums, vanilla, chocolates. taste is like a porter with a ton of artificial vanilla flavor added. why would you do this? what a great way to ruin a porter. the roasty malt and choco flavor that i like in a porter was there, but instead of the subtle vanilla flavors washing in and out, its just a major vanilla blast that destroys the beer. not my thing i guess."
"Flavor is loads of vanilla and ice cream. Lots of proter malts--caramel and toffee. Just some slight hints of coffee too. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and watery but holds up well even as the beer warms up. Very nice and smooth porter--easily rink a few of these and make a nice session out of it."
"Slàinte!"
"D: Ok for one but wouldnt want any more."
"It lives up to the ""vanilla"" descriptor, so I can't say I wasn't warned. There is something to be said for subtlety and harmony in beer. This beer does not say it."
"I'd guess that BAers will either love this or hate this. Either you like the imense vanilla flavor and lactose quality, or you hate the weak porter presence. Although I find this beer intriguing and aluring, there are some characteristics that will keep me from buying it again. Smells wonderful initially, but follows up with a sweet-stout character without the stout. A fellow BA described this as soured milk...I can't disagree. The Porter part of the beer falls quite weak and a bit grainy. This allows for the lactose creaminess to become too pronounced and sweet. I would like more chocolate and coffee flavors to come from the malt. This would increase the body and keep the lactose from feeling slick and overly milky-sweet. At times the vanilla tastes like true-brewed vanilla beans, and at times tastes like a plastic-y extract and keeps me confused. I want to like it, but can't bring myself to say it with much confidence."
"I really wanted to like this brew, maybe it was a bad bottle, but this one was just plain nasty. I've got 5 more, but I'm afraid to even open another. I""ll re-review, if I get the guts to try it again...with different results."
"This one pours a dark color with a moderate head that falls quickly, but leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma has a subtle hint of vanilla with some chocolate and roasty malts. Smells good. The flavor is very nice. Lots of vanilla and a smooth chocolate character. Very enjoyable. The body is on the low end, but the vanilla fills the mouth and coats the palate. Drinkability is very good on this one."
"I have sampled the wares of this nice, and generally dependable brewpub while skiing on several occasions, and was surprised by just how terrible this beer was. Its taste was a combo of diacetyl, formaldehyde and soured vanilla cream soda. It was a beer that I literally took about three sips of, and promptly poured out. I have little to say about this beer other than avoid it at all costs. Colorado has excellent craft brews across the state, New Belgium, Avery, Great Divide to name just a few, and even Breckenridge's other styles. You would be much better off to take advantage of those, and limit your vanilla intake to ice cream."
"Pours a very dark brown with slightly lighter edges. Dark tan head quickly fades to a ring without any noticeable lacing. The smell holds scents of coffee, vanilla, bready malts, and just a hint of chocolate. The taste is where the vanilla comes out stronger. It's not overpowering or dominant by any means but you know it's in there. Some coffee and dark chocolate mixes with the vanilla and caramel. Nicely balanced between the vanilla and the traditional porter flavors. Mouthfeel is thinner than I would like for a porter. Since I only picked one of these up while in Detroit I can't have another...but I would if it were in my fridge."
"Opinion: Well, I am not a huge fan of flavored beers, but I just have to keep trying them to keep my palate in check. This one is pretty over the top in the vanilla addition. I guess that is what you would need for a commercial market, but I would prefer that it be more complimentary than being showcased as it is in this beer. It is pretty good overall, but I doubt that I will have to try another one."
"I'd buy it again if they tweak the recipe just a bit."
"I think I'm in the minority on this one. This beer is lovely...the toastiness of a porter and the sweetness of vanilla. I like this combination better than the sweet milk stouts that I used to like so much. The beer pours a very dark brown, bordering on black with little to no head. The aroma is malty, of course, with vanilla (duhhh) but not overwhelming. The taste is sweet with vanilla. I understand why it might be overwhelming to some but I love the flavor, and I love porters. In my mind, this delivers the best of both."
"Dark in the middle, some brown and a little crimson around edges. Small caramel colored ring of head. Smoky roasted aroma, with clear, strong vanilla bean, and some sweet chocolate as well. It's definitely a porter by taste, some bitter coffee malt is there, mixed up with some sweet chocolate and some other almost fruity flavors tried to come through in the end but this beer is really dominated by a smoky, roasted vanilla which clouds a lot of other flavors. The mouthfeel wasn't chewy at all, it was kind of dry. This is a novelty beer, one or two might be a treat, but this is far from a session beer."
"12 oz bottle pours a dark chestnut body topped by a small tan head that quickly falls to a cap. Minimal spots of lace. Aroma is creamy chocolate and vanilla bean. Also, a hint of dark roasted malts and what seems to be oak. Mouthfeel is light medium with a low medium carbonation. Taste is creamy vanilla and chocolate. Very subdued roastiness with some lactic sourness and hazelnut. Unusual, but it works for me. More a brown ale than a porter, but nicely drinkable."
"D: The flavor of this beer is obnoxious, and a bit of subtlety and restraint with the vanilla beans would have been nice. Pass on this one."
"-UF"
"This won't be everyone's cup o'... uh... beer. It's somewhat sweet in a candy-like sort of way. But it isn't bad at all. This would make a great dessert beer for many pastries. I found it to be delightful. While I wouldn't drink a lot of them, it's an enjoyable change of pace. Well worth a try."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a creamy 3/4"" tan head above the barely translucent burgundy brown brew. Head fades gradually, with average lacing. Aroma is roasty grains and lactose sweet. Taste is the sweet dark malts upfront, then the vanilla sweetness kicks in, with a light fruitiness, and all that sugar just hangs around, long after the swallow. Mouthfeel is just too sweet, and drinkability is limited by same. Turn it back a notch, and we might have an interesting, more drinkable brew."
"It's drinkable, but just too heavy on the vanilla - which seems to be a common theme among vanilla porters."
"Mouthfeel is moderate, not real heavy but a sipper just due to the sweetness. I had a sip off a draft a few weeks ago and it was simply wretched but the bottle is not half bad. A curiosity, to be sure, but not sessionable."
"Aroma is very slightly rancid smelling atop a sickly sweetness that might be vanilla, but Im not staking my life on it. There is also a musty roastiness and some mild chocolate and coffee notes. Body is a fairly thick black and it holds a diminishing thumb thick mocha head. Fore is toasted vanilla and roasted malts that impart an acidic bitterness. Chocolate flavors meld with the vanilla to create a hazlenutty/pastry tasting concotion. It actually tastes pretty good if allowed to warm up to room temp, but the aroma is quite off putting. The palate is about right for the style, but barely."
"Drinkability: Not sure what to think here. Pretty decent beer overall, but not real complex."
"Fabulous flavors of vanilla extract, roasted chocolate & caramel malts, big thick creamy mouthfeel, easy to drink. Slightly too sweet to drink all night."
"Drinkability: This is not a bad beer. I expected more from it but it was a nice smooth ale. The tastes are not complicated and nothing overpowering. Plain vanilla porter....nothing extremely special. I would have another one, but I would probably pick something a little more complex if it was available."
"I have no desire to finish this beer. A mistake, even for the curious."
"Drinkability is mixed. I could slam it quick, but the flavour would be overwhelming. I could sip it lazily, exept for the watery texture. The beer rewards a little either way you try it, and punishes either way as well. I think I'll try the next one as a sipper; the pure vanilla flavors shift to the aftertaste as it warms, bringing out the rich coffee and ameretto flavors."
"Color is dark brown with a nice maroon glow. Head is of average height and light brown. Retention is good, a small layer of cream lasts through the end of a glass. Aroma is of dark, sweet lightly roasted malts and a vague whiff of vanilla. Smell seems more like that of a brown ale than a porter. Taste has more of that sweet, lightly roasted brown ale flavor. Vanilla comes into play towards the middle of a sip and adds it's mellow charms. Finish is abrupt. Overall, this is pretty good, maybe a bit on the thin side, and is probably a vanilla brown ale and not a porter."
"Not my favorite style, but it should appeal to fans of real vanilla flavor. One glass was almost too much for me, though."
"drinkability: pretty easy but not very good"
"D - Good drinkability. I like it. All the porter qualities, besides color, are non-existent. Nice flavor, nice change."
"Poured into a pint class, the head dissapeared almost immediately. Vanilla scent is very apparent in the smell, which is nice, but the taste seems to overwhelm the roasted taste of the porter. The two tastes feel out of balance, fighting, rather than complimenting each other. I'm not a big fan of vanilla, so take my opinion with that in mind. A good beer, well brewed, but I wouldn't go too far out of my way unless I had a friend who needed a sweet introduction to porter."
"The beer pours a nice dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a creamy malt scent that boasts of crystal and roasted malts. It also has a mild vanilla scent that adds another level of sweetness to the aroma. The taste is decent. It has a well pronounced vanilla flavor layed over a roasted malt taste. It's sweet with a dry element to it. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer, but I think the recipe needs to be tweeked a little. More crystal and chocolate malts would make this a wicked awesome dessert brew."
"Pours a dark black with just faint highlights of deep red. Somewhat weak tan crown that dissappates quickly. The aroma has a solid vanilla presence, with some roasted malts and toffee, very sweet like frosting. The taste is also very sweet.. Lots of vanilla, toasty sweet marshmallow, butter brickle toffee and a bit of bitterness towards the end. Its quite flavorful, but possibly has too much vanilla and sweetness. The aftertaste of vanilla just hangs on to my tongue. After a few drinks it wears on me and I'm ready for a different beer."
"Overall impression: This might be good for someone who isn't a fan of beer, but to me it was just overly sweet, with nothing to balance it out. I won't be getting this one again."
"The aftertaste has an edge I'm not keen about. An off after-taste of vanilla? Light bodies and modestly carbonated. Overall, the vanilla is moderate and in line with the other flavors. Everything mixes quite well and goes down comfortable until the aftertaste."
"Bottom line: An interesting variation on the Porter style that I find ""not bad"" but...it isn't something I'd buy very often. It's just worth a try."
"Vanilla is one of those things, where a little goes a long way. It seems like they could've used a litte less, brought the roasted malt flavor more to the foreground and this would have been a winner. As it stands now, the vanilla is way too sweet and dominating. I don't think I could tolerate more than one of these in a sitting."
"Medium bodied at best, low carbonation....pretty smooth. Probably a beer I could have one or two of in a sitting. Any more than that might be bit too much sweetness for one session."
"DK: This is a tough one. 12 ozs will be a feat in and of itself."
"Feel is milky smooth and soft on the palate as it quenches favorably well in a medium statured body. Clean, fresh, and well rounded feel and flavors throughout its stay with just the right amount of bearable sweetness and vanilla. Although this did seem a bit overbearing at first few sips but it tended to mellow off some and was no longer bothersome as it grews on me. The little chocolate push in the finish really helped. Although, as well to mention here, this might not be for everone who thinks of a porter and try this stuff. My take is that its a solid, drinkable little porter thats worth trying out."
"pours out of the bottle a dark brown with ruby and crimson highlights. ample tannish head reduces down to a thin coating which ends up leaving sparse lace. lots of choco and vanilla notes in the nose...really smells like a beer one should have on valentines day with your chocolate treats. really tasty...like a liquid milky way candy bar. the vanilla is proportioned right to meld nicely with the chocolate covered nougat maltiness. this is nicely balanced, well crafted beer. the mouthfeel is velvety smooth on top of a seemingly light body. finishes lightly creamy smooth with vanilla hints. really sessionable and not too sticky sweet or cloying. i like it and it's worth seeking out for the style."
"this beer has a little to much vanilla flavor for me."
"Dark brown color and clearish, lets highlights through at the bottom. Skim of a flat head, just dots for lace. Aroma is straightforward, a dash of vanilla but not too exaggerated, especially at first. Mouthfeel seems a bit thinnish to me, not like some others seem to detect, it could use more of a creaminess in my opinion. The flavor is slightly bland, water searching for a flavor, vanilla notes are apparent and not too bad, not as oxidized as some Stoney Creek examples I've had, not as heavy-handed as something like Michelob Celebrate. Finishes a little fuller but with some extra heavy but still hummingbird feeder watery sugariness. Not too bad, if the texture worked out better for me, it would make it more quaffable."
"Drinkability is the main weakness here. Much like other brews of this variety, I doubt I'd ever have more than one or maybe 2. At the same time, I don't think this was ever intended to be a session brew by iteself. It is what it is and it does a good job."
"A worthy flavored porter. Pours out to a pitch black color with a large tan head. Some notes of lacing, and a medium low level of carbonation. Aromas are light, some vanilla bean, mild spice and malt, a touch of granola. Taste was pretty good; flavors of full roasted malts, sweet cream, grains, and some vanilla bean made their way to the palate and matched well. Mouthfeel was medium-full bodied, and had a decent amount of consitancy. Lower ABV and good flavor make this a possible session brew for watching sports. This beer kind of borders on ""Stout-ville", but it's a good porter however you look at it. Give it a shot, this is among the better flavored beers i've had."
" I like more porter, less vanilla."
"D: Good, but the sweetness might get to me after two pints."
"Da nice change to the standard porter. Mild vanilla makes it very drinkabledoubt I could have more than 3, but this is a nice dessert brew."
"Drinkable for 1 or 2 but too sweet past that. Would be great with a brownie. I'd think this would work for me with about 2% more abv. Worth a try when you you sweet tooth is calling"
"Pours a very black color with dark brown highlights. The foam is a nice khaki-tan color. Aroma is toasted malts, molasses, raisins, and cappuccino. The taste is remarkably strong of vanilla, especially in the finish. The aftertaste really reminds me of vanilla bean cappuccino. Quite a unique flavor. Mouthfeel is nice and the drinkability is great as well. I only have one of these so I dont know if the vanilla taste would get annoying after quite a few. I definitly like this one though. Great job."
"This was a good beer but the vanilla wore my palate down after a bottle. I couldn't see drinking too many of these at all. I bet it would be great poured on some real vanilla bean ice cream."
"Drinkability: An ok beer, I don't know if I would get it again, but a nice dessert beer."
"I call this the rootbeers of beers. Every angle of this beer is pretty good. Great pour, thick and heavy with a small cream like head much like a cream soda. It has almost like a dry coal taste from the beginning. This beer is all about the finish though. The heavy cream taste comes through and a heavy vanilla finish. The thing about the vinnila part is its natural mouth feel to it. It has a real vanilla bean taste. Whether it was a extract or some sort of additive used, it still taste how it should"
"OVERALL COMMENTS: Someones got their thinking cap screwed on tight over at Breckenridge Brewing  the beers are improving by leaps and bounds. I might have dry hopped it to add a bit of balance to the vanilla, but why add something and then go to lengths to hide it? This is a showcase for the vanilla bean, and it does wonderfully. Next time Ill see how it is over a scoop of Breyers Vanilla Bean Ice Cream!"
"--update. OK, I've had a six pack. A nice smooth beer. Doesn't linger too long in the back of your mouth. don't drink other beers after this one unless they are big tasting."
