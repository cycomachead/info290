"Taste is a combination of roasty flavors and smoke.  Lots of smoke, maybe a bit too much.  Very slightly tart."

"-  overall a good beer to pair with bbq and anything smoked"

"faint aroma, nothing exceptional...nothing overwhelmingly negative...just not stellar to my twisted palate"
"I probably shouldn't rate this beer because I just really don't like ""smoked"" beers. The smoke in this one isn't overwhelming, but I'd still prefer it to be completely absent."
""
""
"Wasn't overpowering on the smoke side of it... Just gave a nice subtle flavor to the otherwise terrific Porter.  Liked it a lot."
"Nice Rosty taste. Nice dark looks and a great head"
""
""
"Reminds me of chocolate soda.  Thin taste and mouth feel.  Much better porters out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good smoked porter.  Stone rarely disappoints."
""
"Deep amber in color. Strong confrontation with the oaky bourbon smoked scents. The vanilla comes through first in taste, smokey toasty malts finish the palate. Great bear"
""
""
""
""
""
"Best Porter I've drank yet!  Everyone go out and get some"
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, with a light and almost watery flow that has a medium/lightly chewy body, light carbonation and an ashy bitter aftertaste that is smoky and full of coffee and cocoa powder notes. The finish is close to clean, but leave the smoky flavor lingering like a good cigar. Overall a really solid porter that is well priced and always tasty."
""
"Had a pretty good smell, but the taste just wasn't there. Very thin for a porter."
""
""
""
""
"Not very good. Eh, I'll pass"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A really great beer, and I'll surely get it again!"

"Overall - In the past, I've been a little biased against Stone ales (some of their ales are overly hoppy and their marketing campaign is a little obnoxious). Smoked Porter, however, is a winner. What's most impressive about this beer is that, despite the big flavor, it's still relatively smooth (as a fine Porter should be). Yet another bold and wonderful California ale!"
""
"Modest smoked flavor. Not as heavy as you'd expect. Good after taste."
"It's ok. Just OK. meh Stone"

"Beautiful color. Great feel. Love it."
"Great beer, fantastic with dessert"
"Got this one on sale during Christmas holiday. A little bitter for my taste but it was good."
"This may be an unfair comparison but having lived in Bamberg, Germany which is home to two very good smoked beers, This porter was very much like Spezial Rauch Bier in that is slightly lighter in both color and feel. However, I preferred the heft and taste as well as the dark color of the Schenkerla Rauch Bier. This beer was very close to Spezial."
"Pours a dark brown with thin bubbly light brown head. Smoke aroma very prominent. Smoke also appears in the taste, which lingers around. Overall very solid beeer and is exactly as stated, no tricks here. A good smoked porter."
""
"Very tasty, easy drinking... loved it!"
"Picked up a big boy of this offering, had it poured into a stout glass. The color was a dark, dark brown with lots of tan head and lacing. The body of this beer is probably its strongest suit. The taste and smell were coffee and roasted malt, but not as strong as I was hoping for. Good, but not great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really smooth and delicious. I would recommend it"
"A bit to thin for me. I guess I should stick with the Imperial Stouts."
"Good every time I will always grab one of these."
"Not my favorite beer. Stone has many more smoked porters I like better."
"Taste follows nose and finishes with some bitterness."
""
""
"V - Medium."
"At first glance this beer is black and foreboding. A closer examination shows it's really a deep, dark brown with some underlying crimson. The head is a frothy off-white finger of foam that stuck around for a good while. In time, some splotchy lacing remains, as well as a thin cream coating on the surface. A classic porter profile marries with smoke to create an interesting metallic aroma. Reminiscent of a burnt bread slice from the toaster. Faint chocolate notes and trace hops are present too. Very earthy. The flavor is a tasty mix of roast and sweet dark chocolate. There's a nice bitter kick in the finish with a distinct smokiness that lingers. You can almost breathe it in. The texture of the brew is pretty average. Medium mouthfeel with lively but controlled carbonation. Just right. Not overly complex, or potent, but discernible as a porter or light stout with some added flair. It leans toward the bitter, dry end of the spectrum, but never approaches puckering or unpleasant. I've had other porters that are silkier and more balanced, but this delivers in all the right ways for a smoked beer. Quite delicious."
""
""
""
"It was ok, not my favorite"
""
""
"Not a fan of smoked, but probably the best I've had."
"Tastes a lot like Stone's Imperial Stout, just smokier and less on the bitterness.  Goes down surprisingly smooth and has a nice black color."
""
""
""
""
""
"Good smoked porter not the best I have had"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The smoke overpowers everything at first but as I let it warm up chocolate malts blend well and subdue the smoke into a nice balance. My second in this style and looking forward to more. This one mixes nicely with rye whiskey, too! Just sayin."

"Pretty bland, not a whole lot of interesting characteristics. Considering it is made by Stone, you kinda sip down wondering if you're just missing something, expecting it to maybe come out a bit more as it warms, but it never happens. This might be one of the most ""meh"" beers I have ever had and by far the worst Stone. Tastes more like Miller or Budweiser attempted to make C.D.A."

"This is a solid porter. It's not my favorite example of the style, but it's still impressive.  I personally like their vanilla variant better though. It's good stuff, but not elite. It's still one of those classic brews everyone should try if they haven't already."
""
""
"o; Sure lives up to its name!  Smoke in abundance, perhaps the strongest of any similar type.  A most enjoyable sipper.   Have had their Vanilla bean version and enjoyed that, but this one packs an amazing smoky wallup."

"EBD 7/17/14.  Clear dark amber pour (similar to Coke) with a nice garnet note.  Normal head and retention very good lacing.  Nice complex nose of chocolate, light roast with toffee/coffee notes, a very subtle hint of dark fruit and a light smoky character that becomes pronounced as it warms.  Light medium bodied with an almost smooth texture.  Good carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish and in the middle.  The flavor profile is quite nice, balanced - with a smoky skew - and complex.  It begins with roast, then fades into a light chocolate sweetness.  The middle effervesces into a burst of smoke and light hops over a well balanced bitterness.  As it flows into the finish, hints of dark fruit emerge.  The finish leaves you with a nice smoky aftertaste that lingers over hints of bitter dark chocolate."

"O- One of the better porters I've had, the smoke adds a bit of complexity but I remember it being more assertive in that department. Overall, I like it. Maybe drinking it at more of a room temperature would be better as I drank this one slightly chilled (4.07 average)."
"a yummy Porter! I'm not a big fan of Porters or Stouts but this is a great beer! i prefer their regular one over their Smoked Porter."
"Nice porter. Pours a beautiful deep brown with a decent head that has great lacing. Aroma is light. Taste is also light for a porter. Very drinkable. The soke is very light and comes more in the aftertaste than the actual consumption. A slight bitterness at the end. Good beer, one of the better porters I have has"

"I have failed to be surprised by Stone products anymore.This Porter Rocks.I had a Bomber last night .Poured it in my 20oz Firestone glass and watched as the color was a dark brown.The smell was fantastic and I Knew it was going to be a good night.At 5.9 ABV it was just about right for a mellow David Bowie greatest hits night.I would recomend this Porter and any other Stone product.Quality is job One for them.Motley Drunk out."

"Pours jet black with a thin white head and moderate lacing. I picked up the smokiness in this immediately although some seem to not have. Vanilla, toffee, tart cherry, a touch of coffee and a full amount of smokiness that makes bacon ring through my mind. Not much carbonation and the flavors made it feel like I was drinking flat soda (in a good way, for those who deem it possible) towards the end. Very enjoyable!"
""
""
"O: This was a great beer overall. No peat and this is really not a single malt in a pint glass but it does a good job at being very drinkable, flavorful, and remaining interesting to the palate throughout the experience. Mouth feel definitely needs work though but then again who am I too tell STONE how to brew a beer."

"O: As a porter alone, it is fine enough...tasty in its own right, but not something I would reach for over Founders/Great Lakes/Deschutes. As a ""smoked"" porter? I am left underwhelmed. I would have assumed the smoke would be much more robust and ingrained."

"Some thoughts... #1 I love me some Stone... poured from a 22 oz bomber into a snifter (and my wife's stemless wineglass, as we are talking about a dark beer here!). The appearance of this brew was fascinating... a deep black at the top of the glass, with a rich, translucent scarlet around the bottom of the glass. About a finger of a tan head which dissipated quickly. The aroma was overpowered by smoke, with some deep malt coming through as well. Taste was again overpopwered by smoke, with some dark fruit and malt undertones. Mouthfeel was smooth and enjoyable. Though this was definitely overpowered by the smoke (duh asshole, it is called smoked porter...), it chilled out as the glass warmed. Though it is somewhat like drinking a porter in a smoky room, at least it was more like yummy smoking meat smoke, as opposed to smoky bar smoke. Probably won't seek it out, yet intrigued by the chile pepper and vanilla variants. Worth a try if you like your beers dark."

""

"Overall: My first smoked porter and I enjoyed it. Rich flavor for the style, and the price is right. As with most well made beers, more flavor came out the warmer it got. The finish was perhaps too bitter for my liking. Although good, it's not great, and falls short of being top tier for me. I will almost always grab for a more straight forward robust porter such as Founders or Smuttynose over this. However, this will be added to my cookout rotation. Recommended for sure!"

"As a long time fan of Stone ipas, I was very excited to try their smoked porter, it did not dissappoint. This offering pours a very near black color with a thick tan head that quickly dissipates and leaves a nice film and lacing. The nose is robust and roasty. Lots of coffee, dried fruits, leather, and a slight smoky quality. Not as abrasive as in some smoked beers. The flavor confirms the nose. Smooth and rich and roasty. Coffee, vanilla, and chocolate abound and are accented by the slight smokiness. Mouthfeel is rich and luxurious; almost more stout like than porter. This is an excellent beer. Stone does a great job of balancing the flavors without making the smoke too prevalent. Well done!"

"Poured reddish brown into a cut pint glass. A nice head piled up quickly, then disappeared just as quickly with some decent lacing. The smoke was not overt, but was there like a distant fire. Coffee, chocolate, dark fruit and shoe polish dominated the scent. The taste was complex and shifting from sip to sip, slightly sweet at first, then bittering on the swallow, with again a light impression of smoke on the backside. I'd say this has more carbonation than most Porters, but this is not a detriment at all. Overall a great porter, if not a very smokey one, I'm impressed that I'm noticing nuances several sips in. Hats off to Stone, I need to track down the Smoked Porter with Chipotle now."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This to me is what a smoked porter should be. Robust porters aren't usually my thing, but this one was quite tasty and well balanced. Would definitely get this again, and I recommend trying it, strongly. This is my first taste of Stone, and I want more."

"Overall: One of the best porter's I have had. I imagine this is what they originally tasted like in the 1700s. Very drinkable. Is not overwhelmingly heavy, so I could drink a healthy amount. Some more aroma would really bring this beer out."

"O- Stone is my favorite brewery for a reason. All four categories are brilliantly crafted and mix together to create one hell of a Porter here. Each sip shifts focus to somewhere else. The back of the bottle hits the nail on the head by saying, ""Stone Smoked Porter is mysterious, smoky, and verging on utterly decadent"". I'll be having many more times to come."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O.A.: this beer is a good in-betweener, you could spend your time sipping this one for its richness or its a good session porter, not too rich if you don't want to take your time."

""
""

""

"Good, not great beer. The smoking is distinctive but that's the only distinctive thing about it, without that this is a decent, but bog-standard porter. Adding the smoke does kick this up a little and it's worth a try as a result, but this is hardly the definitive take on this idea."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is an enjoyable porter that really improves as it warms (patience is not usually my thing - but it is rewarded)."
""
""
"Big fan of porters, and for the price thought this looked worth trying. Won't break this down much, just didn't like it. If I weren't looking at the bottle I wouldn't have guessed smoked at all. More hoppy than expected, dominated any nuance this beer might have had, and I never got the smoked taste I was hoping for. Had this with smoked ribs as many suggested, big disappointment, dumped it and opened a St. Arnolds. Pluses? Rich dark color."

"Combines its flavor nicely, without being heavy handed nor sugary sweet. Very pleasant and quite unique."
"big malt backbone on this. sweet but just stops short of too rich. some hop balance, a little espresso, mostly sweet though. not as smokey as one might expect, a chocolate flavored smoke, a bitter chocolate or coffee note that seems smokey while being mostly a sweet beer"
""
"Purchased from Sprouts in Poway CA. Darkish brown tobacco in apperance with a whiteish mocha head. Good lacing. Smells smokey, malty, faint hints of chocolate. Mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat creamy. Taste is malty, smokey, choclatey with the slighest bit of coffee mixed in. A very nice porter, prefer this over the Vanilla Bean version."

"I am early in my journey of fine craft beers and this is my first Smoked Porter. The appearance is what I expected it to be, dark and rich. The smell was a bit of a surprise as it was a little more floral than I expected, which I liked. The taste was great with no bitter bite or tongue swabbing after taste. Overall, I think this is a very good beer that I would recommend to someone who is scared of trying a porter for the first time."

"Pours a very dark brown/black in color with a 2-finger thick off white head, BUT doesn't last a long time and settles down to a hin foamy head. LOTS of lacing was seen with each sip that stayed in place. The aroma is complex with a lot going on here. There is coffee, smoke, chocolate and roasted malt. The smokey malt hits your tongue right up front as well as espresso with a hint of chocolate. A slight bitter aftertaste with each sip. ***The more I drink this one the less I like it BUT I will leave my review as it is***"

"Poured a dark brown which was reddish with a black center when held to light. There was a half-finger tan head that receded to a tan ring leaving lacing down the glass. Quite nice, very on point for a porter. Scents of slight citrus peel, roasted malt, smoked malt, dark chocolate and black coffee. A very good porter aroma with a nice addition of smoke, very nice. Flavors of black coffee, roast malt, cocoa powder and slight smoked malt with slight caramel in the middle and finish. Bitter and roasted aftertaste. Very well done, true to style for a porter with just enough smoked character to add complexity. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with low carbonation and a creamy feel. Very good, very much a porter. Overall this is a good porter with a nice layer of complexity added to the aroma and flavor with the addition of smoked malt. Very good, recommended."

"Pint bottle, poured into a traditional mug. Aroma of coffee and chocolate. Poured solid black. Nice light tan head, wavy lacing, and even thick geographic lacing that caked the inner walls of my mug, something I have never seen before. Noticed the smokyness at the nose, and strong flavors of dark chocolate, coffee just a twinge of a rasberry. Awesomely a nice blend of hop bitterness with malt sweetness, could not get over the smokyness. A medium or heavier mouth feel. Overall I was very impressed with this superbly executed porter."
""
""
""
"Has a three finger head with a tan color that lasts for awhile. The smell is faint with smoked coffee and dark chocolate. The first taste that hits my tongue is the taste of smoked oak and roasted bitter coffee. There is hints of dried fruit and little dark chocolate. Overall I'm disappointed with this porter. It's not by any means bad but there are a lot better porters out there."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall...this is a sipper and just try to enjoy it.... the smokyness is a really cool part of this beer and stone did it well...(yet again). get around a bonfire with a few friends and split a bomber. good and easy drinking."
""
""
""
"Overall: Good job bringing the smokiness in without completely dominating the beer. I've had smoked beers before that just tasted burnt and that wasn't the case here. I did not find this beer overly complex though. Good for the style and interesting but would have liked more noticeable hints of other flavors."

"Picked a beer out of my collection to pair with my steak and to later review for my 26th birthday - this was a fantastic choice. Stone Smoked Porter does everything very well and the flavor and mouthfeel are phenomenal. This beer isn't a heavy or super rich beer like an imperial stout, rather is the signature chocolate moose of beers with a delicious yet complex flavor profile and a light, creamy mouthfeel. I could drink this beer all night, and am quite disheartened that I've finished off the bomber. Probably one of my all-time favorites, I better get this again!"
"Overall, this is a decent enough porter but, after being exposed to some of Stone's other offerings, my expectations may have been a little high."

"Into a mason jar from a bomber, pours dark brown with almost half a glass of tan head. Bottle has an awesomely long explanation of the beer on the back which I am too lazy to read right now, but I appreciate the detail and will come back to it. Smells awesome, malty, nutty, wood smoke, musty tobacco - smells like your weird uncle's cabin in the woods. Flavor is so dark and smoky, adequately hopped, and lightly sweet. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and carbonation is light. I really like this beer, and I'm envisioning a number of future occasions where it would be appropriate, most involving outdoorsy activities and large fires. Maybe not for everyone, but I like this beer. Quite a bit."

"O: Pretty good. I've had a lot of the Stone beers in different setting that just aren't appropriate for reviewing. This is my first time really sitting down with the Smoked Porter and I'm pretty pleased with it. Not something I'll go for every time I'm at the bottle shop, but I can't think of many better beers for Fall grilling when there's a slight briskness in the air and a good football game on the tube."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer and I thought it was a pretty average example of the style, there was nothing about the flavor or aroma that really kept me coming back for more, it wasn't as bold and as aggressive as I expect most beers from Stone to be, so to me it felt a little out of place. This beer had decent drinkability, it was fairly smooth and not filling but the flavor didn't do a good job at holding my attention and I think a glass would be enough for me, a whole bomber is a little too much for me and after one pour it started to wear on me. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance, I thought it was very good and it's one of the best looking Porter that I've seen in a while. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was out of place for the style and it just didn't work that well with this beer. I would buy a fresh bottle just to see how different it is but as far as getting a beer just to enjoy and drink I don't think I would get this again, it just doesn't keep me coming back for more. I wouldn't really recommend this beer, it's not really smokey or porter like enough to recommend. All in all I thought this beer was a disappointment, I had high hopes for this one since stone rarely disappoints, but this one just fell flat and it didn't really highlight those porter and smokey flavors and aromas as well as I would like. Better luck next time guys, this beer just didn't do it for me, but I would still like to try the chipotle version of it."

"A really good beer but misses the mark for me."
""
"This is a decent beer, I'm just not too crazy about it. First off the smell reminds me of a smoldering ash tray in a bar which turned me off at first. As the beer warmed up in the glass I enjoyed it a little more. It has a nice smoked nutty flavor with hints of chocolate taffy and mocha, but a little one dimensional. I'm not sure if I would buy this beer again, would like to find something a little richer and with more distinct flavors."

"O: I'm glad I gave this a try. It's not necessarily something I'd work into a regular rotation, but I could definitely see stocking a couple more bombers for when the mood strikes. The clerk where I bought it ""warned"" about the smokiness, but I didn't find it that over-powering at all -- certainly not enough to be off-putting. It fell right in the range I'd expect from a self-proclaimed ""smoked porter."" Another fine product from Stone, reasonably priced a $4.99 for a bomber."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown color with a finger of bone white head. Smell isn't very strong but is mostly roasted malts. Taste is roasted malts up front, with coffee and hints of chocolate. Mouth is very smooth with a little more carbonation than I was expecting. Overall, another great beer from Stone. I don't think I've ever been disappointed by them."
""
""
""
"Overall: A great porter. One I would revisit. Smokiness almost not enough, although better to err on too little, perhaps..."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very solid beer, easily drinkable, not very complex, but complex enough to make it interesting."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This might be a good transition for those looking to move into the darker, heavier beers without being overwhelmed from the get-go. It's a fine porter to sip slowly, letting it warm to room temperature and discover more subtle flavors/aromas, or a good one to quaff straightaway."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very nice experience in a Porter. It has a very good appearance with a moderate head and good carbonation. The aroma is what really makes this beer an experience. A nose fulling experience with good complexity and a nice smokiness. In addition, the taste does not disappoint. It is both full flavored and relatively clean. I can drink a full 22oz bottle and never feel like I'm being overwhelmed; very satisfying. The one potential weakness of this brew is the mouth feel. From the initial aroma, one gets the impression that it should be smooth and silky on the tongue. Unfortunately, after the fine initial experience with the aroma and color, the mouth feel comes across as somewhat watery. However, close your eyes and concentrate on the flavor and you won't notice the weak mouth feel after a few sips. Overall about a 4 out of 5. It's good enough that I keep a few bottles in the back of the refrigerator as a regular stand by."
""
""
""
"The smoked aspect of this porter is well done, with just barely enough to be noticeable, but at no point becomes overwhelming."
""
""
""
""
"Cold 22 oz bottle served in pint glass. Beer pours black, opaque except for a tinge of red, and a medium chestnut head. Aroma is smoky, as expected. Smoke and roasted malt pick up the front of the flavor, too. Smoked flavor is the major player here, but it doesn't overpower the substantial malt bill here. Burnt toast is big here. In the background there are subtle coffee and mocha flavors. Finally, there's a bitter edge to bring out the dry finish. This is a really good smoked porter and worth coming back to again and again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was surprising, did expect it to be as good as it was. Will try to again. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I don't think it's a good representation of the style. IPA lovers would most likely enjoy it if they're trying to branch out to porters and stouts."
""
"O- good beer, but very one dimensional. All smoked malt, chocolate and pine hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Another benchmark provided by Stone. This isn't a knock your socks of porter, but damn if it's not tasty and sets a bar for the style. I'm not a huge porter fan, but this could change my mind."
""
""
"Solid porter."
""
"I would happily recommend this porter the flavors are very complex and I would need to have it several times to identify them all."
""
""
""
"O: A really great porter, one I would recommend to anyone looking for a benchmark porter, or trying to get into darker beers in general. I think its one of the best go to bombers widely available"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I've held on to this one for some time, not sure what to expect as other smoked beers I've had left some to be desired. This was nice, however, as the smokiness was well balanced by the rest of the beer. I would be interested to try this fresh to see how a bit of age has changed it. If only Stone still distributed to Wisconsin...."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I think this is solid. Needs a bit more, aromatically. Tastes good and feels great. I'll be back."
"A solid beer. As easy as this one is to find, I definitely see myself buying this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had this a long time ago, didn't care for it. Had it again recently and loved it. Smoke can be a touchy subject in the world of beer when not left in the most deft of hands (Heller-Trum), but it works perfectly here and isn't anywhere close to overpowering. Plus, only 4-5$ for a bomber? What a steal. One of the best smoked beers I've had to date, for many reasons."
""
""
"Tasty - an impressive effort, though it comes across as more subtle than the other Stone beers I've tried. I'm not sure what effect has resulted from allowing it to go past it's BB date; perhaps a reduction in hop aroma? I was expecting it to be smokier - it appears that the brewers held back on the rauch to produce a brew with a well-judged balance between smokiness and traditional dark malt flavours. The hoppy pine notes that define Stone beers are noticible but take a back seat for a change. However, the overall effect is unique; how many other breweries combine smoked malt and hops the way this beer does? A solid brew with a delicious range of flavours - it goes down a treat. Well worth sampling if you have the chance."
""
""
"Overall/Comments: An excellent complex brew that is done extremely well. Very well balance. If you are a porter fan, this is a must try. Classified as an American Porter at 5.9%. consumed 1/19/2013."
""

"I am fairly skeptical of Porters generally because I feel that they are hard to pull off. The Smoked Porter from Stone definitely does a good job and keeps the smokiness genuine without overdoing it. This is a great sipping beer and very nuanced. Highly recommend."

"Pours from the bottle with a deep, nearly opaque black/brown color and generates a foamy sand-colored head. The aroma is disappointingly subtle, with only a bit of milk chocolate and weak coffee being discerned. The flavor is more what I had hoped for, with some soft, woody smoke, chocolate, and a bit of spicy, herbal hops for balance. The mouthfeel detracts from the varied flavor profile, with a fine, fizzy carbonation that borders on unpleasant. Overall, this is a fine porter with a bit of extra character, but it is is sadly subtle."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A bit chalky/smokey for my tastes, but still a decent beer all around, though this would not be my first choice in terms of smoked ales."
""
""
""
""
"Overall... already said it. Just wondering if perhaps it would go better with a particular meal (BBQ? Fried chicken? Smoked Sausage?) than standing alone... or perhaps I shouldn't have planned on drinking all 22 oz by myself."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"O: Nice roasty porter, not too much char or smoke which I like and a good dose of coffee and cocoa to balance the roastiness."

""
""
""
""

"Aftertaste: Here we go. The aftertaste. What makes the Fate smoked porter good is the aftertaste. That is what makes this one tolerable. The ABV is pretty low on this, under 6%. But as a porter, I expect something a little thicker with a little more flavor. The aftertaste is where you get the smoke flavors. Still not much flavor, but the aftertaste is still here a few minutes after I swallowed. This is good, but not the best offering from Stone. Sorry guys, but Fate Brewing has you beat on the smoked porter."
""
""
""
""
"I might try this again if I had a food that would compliment it."
"Sweet pour - dark brown yet opaque with a solid cream colored head that persists throughout consumption. Mouthfeeel is good but not remarkable (maybe a good thing). Smell is no surprise with dark, rich malts and a pleasant smoked aroma. Taste is consistent with the smell and has a presence of chocolate not immediately obvious via the smell. Nice brew for a cool night."

"O: I might like this with a bbq. I find the soy souce finish too much and overpowering."

"M - Medium body with good carbonation. Finish is quite clean and leaves only a residual bitterness, but no sticky sugars."

"O: I wasn't sure what to expect going into this one but the smoked flavor was not overdone and gave it a nice balance."

""
""
""
"O: A great beer from Stone, a bit weird on the nose but there 100% on the taste and mouthfeel, which is what I enjoy in stouts and porters. Comes at an affordable price, always a plus, yet simple drinkable. Gotta try this with a grilled steak or a fatty burger."

""
""
"My first foray into the big Stone family of Porter's. Needless to say, I was not left disappointed as this beer packed all of the punch and flavor I've become accustomed to with Stone beers. This beer is jet black, offering no discernible light through, and has a thin tan head that lasts until the very last drop. A sweet feel on the tongue is followed by a strong smokey flavor that delivers an uncompromising finish on what the name implies. Would I buy this again? Absolutely. Do I regret missing out on their chipotle porter? Absolutely."
""
"O: Overall a subdued, round palate with no particular strengths or weaknesses. I loved the subtleties of this brew but expected more intensity and strength of flavors especially from a Stone brew."
""

""
""
""

"Falls flat for me. Not a bad beer, but lacking in flavor. Pours a dark brown to black, ruby on the edges, with a small white head. Aroma is rather bland, with only slight evidence of roast or smoke, not much else to detect. Flavor continues with very little chocolate or coffee flavor, a bit watered down in flavor. Cant get much of the smoke here. Palate is thin for what I expected to be a bold porter and the great things I heard. Just okay for me, and wish this had a bit more flavor to it."
"Drinkability: It is pretty solid stuff. It does not necessarily blow me away, and I was expecting something better, but it is very good nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - 4.0 - I guess I was expecting more smoke, maybe something closer to rauchbier levels. But the imperial stouts I've been drinking have about the same char character. I find myself wishing this would just bring the rest of it and go ahead and be bolder and be an imperial stout already. With that said, it's still very well done. And I like the charry aftertaste. If I forget about what it's advertised as and what I wish it would be, it comes out as a really well done beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Excellent porter. Among some of the best I've had, definitely a strong competitor in this category. Stone got pretty much everything right with this one, with almost nothing to complain about. A beer I could happily enjoy every night if I could. Solid 4.5/5"
""
""
""
""
""
"Note: This beer pairs very well with dark chocolate and roasted almonds. Allow a piece of dark chocolate to coat your palate before sipping; the interplay between the chocolate and the beer's smokey malt won't disappoint."

"-Overall 3.25: This is a good drinking beer, but I imagine it would overpower any food you consume with it.

Like getting rid of the bleu cheese hop."

"Poured out a dark brown color with a brief flash head and minimal lacing, smells and taste mostly of chocolate, coffee, and has a very accessibly light licorice / smoke character to it. Seriously, it's really quite light on the smoke for your typical smoked beer. In that regards, it could serve as an introduction to the style for the neophyte....medium body and carbonation, a fairly by-the-books porter that just happens to have an exciting accent of smoke along for the ride. However, I personally have come to expect a lot more smoke from a smoked beer than what has been presented to me in this brew..."
"Overall - Very drinkable, but a little plain/boring. My bottle is a little past the exp. date, but still. A great session beer, but lacking the wow factor that most Stone beers have."
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown, light mocha head. Smoke is noticeable to the smell, but not overwhelming. It's also got a latte sort of fragrance. The smoke works well with the standard porter fare. This beer is quite robust, which I prefer in my porters. This was a turning point for me and smoked brews and even if it's not for all occasions, it's a supreme smoked porter for when the time is right."

"Review from 7/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours dark, almost black. Thin light brown head with little lacing. Roasty malts and light smoke throughout with a mellow roasty faint smoke finish. Not as smoky as a rauchbier or Smoke Jumper, but nicely made and tasty. Surprisingly tasty for a 6% beer. Medium bodied. Worth a revisit."
""
"Picked up a bottle at Woodman’s in Rockford, IL in early 2012 since it is no longer sold in Wisconsin. Pours a dark brown color with off white foamy head. Has a mild smoked scent. Taste is robust yet still sweet with caramel malts finishing with a smoking flavor that delivers a hoppy after taste."

"Solid. Overall a nice beer and one that I can see being a good base to add components to. This one's not gonna blow you away but its a good baseline of what a porter should be."

"I've had this in the past, but I never sat down with a bottle to review it. This is a great porter. Its smokey characteristics are brilliantly well done. I don't feel like I am drinking an ash tray or chewing on a burnt hamburger (win). Stone's standard lineup consistently sets a very high standard that few other breweries meet."
""
""
""
""
"This beer is such an easy drinker that I polish off a bottle before I even notice what I'm doing. A solid tasty dark brew."
""
""
"O- I really do enjoy this beer. I think mostly because the smoke is not right in your face like a rauchbier. It's complimented by the dark malts and the other flavors."

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured into a large brandy snifter. Pours dark brown to black with a creamy tan head that dissipates slowly. As is typical of Stone beer, there is plenty of lacing left on the side of the glass. Mild smokiness could be detected in the initial pour. The nose reveals more smokiness to accompany the dark roasted malt. There's a mild aroma of chocolate and hops. The smokiness is prominent, but well balanced along with the taste of the dark roasted malt and chocolate. The hops are faint in the background. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. The beer is smooth, making this a highly drinkable porter. This is an excellent beer."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - Surprisingly tart on the tongue at first. The low abv allows for a smooth, smoky ride. Imagine coming home from a campfire, the smell of smoke on your clothes - smoking a cigarette after eaten a lightly hot pepper about ten minutes prior. That doesn't make much sense. But it sounds good right now so I'm gonna leave it in the review. Light on the palate, certainly not alcoholic, and easily sessionable. I want to have this out by the campfire."
"Overall- Pretty good example of the style. Very enjoyable."

The hops are milder than other big porters that I've sampled, so the notes center less on black coffee and more on chocolate malt and stewed plum flavors. There is a dash of smoky flavor in the background, as advertised, but I might have missed it if I were not looking for it. Overall, I found Stone Smoked Porter very drinkable and pleasant, a beer that I will definitely pick up again."
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a 24 oz glass. Definitely a good porter, and definitely has a little of that ""smoked"" flavor, but to me this beer doesn't stick out from other good porters as the best. Basically, it was worth a try, but I probably won't buy it over other porters that I think are just as good but available at a cheaper price."
"O - I like this very much, but got spoiled by the more limited variety with chipotle. If you like smoky porters this is a great option that is generally easy to get a hold of."

"On tap at the brewery the beer arrives a dark brown color with rich copper edges in the light. A nice 1/5 finger beige head with good retention and some lacing. The nose is that of roasted malt, chocolate, piney floral hops. Not as smoky as anticipated. The flavor delivers more smoke as expected but not so much that you feel like you're sucking on a charcoal briquette. Pleasant. Again roasted malts and chocolate. Medium bitterness from the piney earthy hops. Finishes clean and smooth with a lingering roasted smoke flavor. Medium bodied and well carbonated. I am typically not a fan of smoked beer, but this has a gentle enough smoke character that it is enjoyable. Good beer."
""
""
"Color is dark brown with a reddish hue when held to light. The tan head has good retention, with lots of lacing left behind. The smell is primarily cocoa, with perhaps a subtle touch of pine as well. The taste begins with sweet roasted malts, followed by a noticeable twinge of hops bitterness toward the finish. There is a very slight smoke taste as well. This porter is a bit more hop-forward than other porters I've had. I would definitely pick this one up again."
"On the lighter side of medium in body and a medium slightly sharp carbonation."
"Poured into my trusty pint glass. Classic American Porter but smoked. Brownish to near blackish beer. Chocolaty and coffeeish beer smoked. The smell was so intriging and the smoked taste led me back to this beer. Smooth beer. Simpily irresistable!!!@!"
"alwaya wanted to try this came in a 22oz bottle , this beer does nothing for me i just drank a smoked beer , and so thats it dont know what the fuss about this beer is but one i wont be drinking again great color too much head and just blah dont see the point of this beer i wonder how it taste with vanilla beans"
""
"Overall I am impressed with this beer as I am with all of Stone's brews. The smoke adds a nice layer to a typical porter and makes this a really outstanding beer."
"A solid beer, and I'd say the price is right, so I certainly plan on buying more someday in the not so distant future."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm not going to whine about this not being robust enough, I'm just going to say it's a solid porter throughout that never overpowers the tongue with smoke notes. Definitely worth a try. I'd get it again - if only because I think it's a fantastic pairing with BBQ chicken."

"O: The first Stone beer I'm not really crazy about. Too sweet, and the malty, smokey sweetness hangs over everything. Underneath there seems to be a nice beer hiding out but any additional flavors are mostly just overpowered."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is an excellent, robust porter, although I'm surprised about the relative lack of smoke. For the style, the points come down a little bit because of the lack of smoke, but as a porter this is very good indeed."
"At 5.9% ABV this is one of Stone’s “lightest” offerings. Parenthesis, only because it pours a dark coffee black with a billowy topping of crème colored foam. It has a light roast aroma, with just a touch of smoke. It’s subtle, nuanced and delicate to the point where it would be easily overlooked had it gone a shade lighter. Flavorwise the smoked malt makes its presence known without being bombastic or assertive. It complements the roast characteristics in a way that makes it a team player, an integral component of this beer’s flavor profile. There’s cacao nibs and a light hop bittering to round out the team, with a little sweetness on the body. It’s delicious and deliciously drinkable and I enjoyed it tremendously."

"O: A very nice and complex porter that has a very nice price point and is pretty easy to drink. Would definitely be a nice fall fireside beer, especially with the smoke character"

"I'll be honest, this didn't satisfy me as I thought it would. Usually when I pour such a gorgeous beer its other qualities are just equally as good, but the smell and taste were underwhelming to me. This beer's flaw, if it can be called that, is that it doesn't have enough of what's already there. The on Randall and Knob Creek vanilla bean version I had had much more character and got more interesting as I drank it. This sort of stayed good but not great. But if you're wanting a mild-flavored and drinkable smoked porter, this is a good bet and it's relatively cheap price makes it an easier choice for a purchase."
""
"Pours a dark color with a cream colored head that leaves some nice lacing. Aroma is of smoke coffee, and caramel. Taste has initial malt sweetness, followed by an interesting smoky flavor. The finish is mildly bitter and dry. Mouthfeel is medium to full."
""
"Overall, I enjoyed this brew a lot. It was balanced, with a good body and complexity without being overwhelming to the palate. It has some flavors and characteristics that I've enjoyed from stouts, but being a porter it was a little less aggressive, which was satisfying and tasty. I would recommend it and have it again, no doubt about it."
""
"Given that its in a 22 ounce bottle and costs more than my regular porters, this beer will not become an everyday beer for me, but its something i can reserve for those special beer drinking days."

"O: Very drinkable. I like that the smoke is present but not overboard. As always, Stone gives a great value. I'm not used to buying bombers this cheap (less than $5)."

"Stone Smoked Porter: Yup, it’s a smoked porter. You can see a hint of color if you hold this brew up to the light. The head is thin and off-white. The aroma is very earthy. Lots of malt tones come through in the flavor, but stay balanced and not too sweet. The finish brings on the smoky flavors and a bit of bitter aftertaste. Overall, I am not a big smoked porter fan, but if you like this style the Stone rendition lives up to its namesake."
""
""
"Overall a pretty good beer. I think the bottle I had may have been a little past it's prime and there was no freshness date. I would like to try a fresh one to see. I think it could be very good."
""

""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall - This is good, and far from your average porter, but the smokiness can be a bit of a nuisance at times, detracting from the porter characteristics in the beer. It'd love to see what Stone could do with the Porter style in a non-smoked form, but alas, this is what they seem content to releasing as their year-round offering. Drink on the warmer side to allow the other flavors to blossom amongst the smokey overtones."
""
"Overall – This is a good brew to some, but I am more of a fan of the traditional porters, so this one caught me off guard a little. This is a great beer to try once, and If you are a big fan of the smoked porters then it would be recommended, but otherwise, there are better out there. Certainly try it though, I'm just not real keen on the smoked flavoring."
""

""
""
""
""
"O - Good beer. I am happy to have tried it, but I probably will not be buying another one."
""
""
""
"O: Definitely a really interesting beer with a good flavor but I personally could not drink a whole lot of this one - just doesn't match my palate as well as other smokey beers. Definitely a quality offering from Stone and a good one to sip on."
""
""
"O: A well made beer overall. A solid porter with an element of smoke to it."
"O-what a great porter. Nice smokey flavors, basically everything you would want for this style."
""
"O - awesome porter from stone. Has the porter 'it' factor with a stone style. I don't think they make an average beer. I could drink this any time. Definitely in my list of top 3 American porters. It's that good."

"22 oz bomber pours a dark cola with good head and lacing. Aroma has a nice smokey nose with roasted coffee, vanilla, and light bacon. The taste really separates this one from other smoked porters - it has a wonderful smokey taste without being raspy. Slight hoppy bitterness balances things out without being overwhelming. Great easy-going mouthfeel reinforces the lack of smokey raspiness, with dry finish. I've had smoked porters that left me feeling like I'd been breathing in campfire smoke for hours on end but not this one! A very nice smoked porter."
""
""
"O – Finally! A “smoked” beer that doesn’t clobber your taste buds with smokiness and nothing else. Finally! A deep and complex thick chewy porter that offers up a lot more than just burnt grain. World class. For comparison, I had an Alaskan Smoked Porter just days ago, and this blew it away. Another hit from Stone. Probably going to become my go-to porter."
""
"O – I had this delicious beer on tap at the Stone Brewing restaurant and it was definitely a highlight of the ones I sampled. It has a distinct flavor and worth enjoying again."

"When I'm in the mood for a porter, this would be my first choice."

""
"Like the name says, this is one of my favorite styles. The memory of this brew is better than this tasting. I can't help thikn this recipe has been ""adjusted"" with more hops and less body than the last time I had it about 4 years back. I prefer the old recipe."
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-heavy bodied, and feels a bit sticky in the mouth. Carbonation is a bit low for the thickness of the body, could be a bit higher and still retain the smoothness and enhance the flow of the beer across the palate. Overall mouthfeel is is fairly smooth and creamy, but a bit higher carbonation would make this less stagnant."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle and served in a tumbler pint. The beer pours a dark, vibrant brown color with a foamy, frothy pale-tan colored head that starts around an inch, but settles into a sparse filmy covering after a couple of minutes. Smells of molasses sweetness, smoke, coffee, and oak on the nose. Initial flavors of sweet molasses malt, smoke, and light roasted coffee, with a bitter overall tone that cleans the end of the palate. The beer is light and smooth in mouth, with a bitter hops, smokey, and coffee finish. The beer leaves a great lacing along the glass as you drink. The aftertaste has a slight linger, and the full, rich flavors and complex palate make this a great sipper."

"A solid Porter, great with food."
"Solid porter. Highly recommended."

"O: So far, the best porter I've tried. All of Stone's brews pack a wallop that brings new meaning to the word GUSTO. I love the smoked aspect of this one. Like they said, great with BBQ."
""
""
""
""
""
"The senses are all sharing their emotions at this time."
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how prevalent the smoke was. It was robust and obvious, but didn’t detract from the beautiful chocolatey inclusions and malts. Additionally, the soft feel helped to round things out on all fronts. If we were going to be picky we would have liked to see more smoke in the aroma, but this is minor. This is a nice twist on a well-executed, and otherwise fairly traditional porter."

"3.5 D: Stone was one of my first loves, but ever since drinking the beers of hundreds of breweries, they don't seem too impressive anymore. Sometimes I wish I had an undeveloped palate again. In any case, this is a tasty, easy drinker."

"O: overall good porter, love the smoke notes. would be great at a bbq"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent American porter. I'm not sure if this is better than the Smuttynose. They are both excellent, and I think I would call this one a tie."
""
""
"A very solid smoked beer, that leaves a bit to be desired if you like more smoke presence, but a great beer in the backbone."
"O- Very solid porter with the smoke flavor there, but not overpowering. Tremendous flavor for a relatively low alcohol content."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style with carbonation being moderate. Overall, it's a pretty good beer. It's very nicely flavored and balances the flavors well. It's very drinkable for the style as well. My big criticism is that every time I have this beer I always wish there was more smokiness to it. It's just barely noticeable, which isn't enough for me. Alaskan Smoked porter is one of my favorite beers ever, I just wish this one was a better substitute for that one."
"Poured vigorously into a 20 oz giant Duvel tulip. Pours a really dark brown, with huge 4 inch light tan head, that takes its time settling into a half inch of bubbles, with a crazy amount of lace. Smell smoked barley, biscuit, leather, and tobacco. Taste is mainly smoke, leather, and maybe some peat. Body is pretty large for its abv, lots of life, easy drinking, and not on the dry side. I am not a huge fan of the style, but this a great example. As always Stone does its thing and thanks for the best by 2/28/12."
""

"O - An extremely good porter. The smoked taste isn't as prevalent as I expcected, but you can't go wrong with this beer."
""
""

""

""
""
"Overall: I liked it a lot. I was expecting something a little different. I am glad to have tried it."
"O- Best beer I've had from Stone, and that's saying something. Great all around."
"Stand by my original weighting. Like this beer a lot. Found it had more stronger, dominant flavors and aromas over Throwback. When compared, seemed like it had a more peat flavor (perhaps like a scotch). Perhaps almost a gamey/meaty taste. However, I would rank the Throwback equally high (perhaps slightly higher in taste)."

"a solid porter that's pretty well balanced but i definitely wish there was more smoke flavor. give this a shot if you're looking for a good american-style porter but go buy some Schlenkerla if you're looking for something smokey."
""
""
""
"Stone’s Smoked Porter isn’t outstanding, but it does display some well-integrated flavors. More like a porter with smoke as an afterthought than a smoked porter."
""
""
""
"The smokiness adds to the complexity and makes this beer well balanced. Medium heavy on the mouthfeel and medium light on the carbination make this a very nice brew. A very nice sipper, that is perfect on these cold windy winter days."
""
""
""
"I think this would pair very well with barbeque, most grilled meats, and most smoked meats. I would serve it a little toward the warmer side to let it be at its best."
""
""
"If you like smoky beers and porters this is a no-brainer. A classic for the style that also separates itself from the pack and one of the many go-to beers in Stone's lineup."
""
""
""
""
"A medium to light bodied porter which is nicely done, but could have been a little more smokier for my taste."

"i hate smoked beers so i was hesitant to try this but this is really good, i will for sure buy this again. a great porter. very reminiscent to the english ones."

"I could definitely taste smoke (hickory). I can't wait to drink one of these again, but with a nice strong cigar next time."

"D: Good. Would happily enjoy or offer to others."

""
""
""

"this beer kicks ass, so damn good! pours black like a starless night and has a one inch lacing tan head. smells like a rauchbier, smokey as a raging bonfire, and roasty dark malty like a sturdy american stout. flavor is less intense than the nose, but its rich in the mouth without being too much. smokey again, with mellow hop bitterness in the finish. i cant do this beer justice in words, but i had the middle ages smoked porter 3 days ago and this absolutely destroys what i thought was an excellent beer. this is epic. so smooth and full bodied, but the aftertaste and the bellyfeel make this one of the best porters of all time. well done again by stone!!!"

"This one is very dark black.It has good carbonation that settles. SMells like roasted smoked chocolate.Taste is nonetheless smoky as well with hints of coffee and roasted chocolate.This is one of a kind if you are into this style of smoked porters.ALso would go well with barbecue.Enjoy."

"Overall this is good porter. Not my favorite, or with the best mouthfeel, but a good tasting porter nonetheless. In fact, as far as taste goes, it's up there pretty high, but the feel takes it down a bit for me. I'll give it one thing, though, it's quite drinkable. And at the ABV, it could be close to a more full flavored session type beer."

"A dark brown color, pretty much opaque with a decent light creamy tan head and good lacing. The aroma is surprisingly vague with just the suggestion of some herbal malt and a whisper of charcoal. No smoke whatsoever. The flavor again does not bring an obvious smoke either but there is a little grassy smoke and more mild charcoal malt. There’s a citrus tartness that nearly defines this brew which surprises me greatly considering it’s a smoked brew. This is a medium bodied brew with tiny bits of carbonation and a near resinous, yet glassy smooth feel. It’s a quality brew in feel but I bought this for a smoke taste experience and it’s so subtle as to really be nothing that warrants a smoke title. This brew is just a decent porter that features grassy hops and tart citrus over mild charcoal malt. Good, but ultimately a disappointment."
"Wow. I finally tried this stuff. Picked up a bomber from Jasper’s in Nashua. Pours like oil, black and completely opaque. Cream colored one finger head that recedes quickly. Vanilla, caramel, coffee, and maybe licorice (?) in the aroma. Full bodied mouthfeel, roasty malt character, chocolate, medium sweetness, smokiness, and just a bit of hop on the backend. This was a great brew, and replaces Anchor as my favorite porter."
"O - Very good porter that I would highly recommend."
"O: I'm a big Stone fan, and this is a winner as are most of their beers. I will certainly try another bottle that's within the brewery's suggested drinking range, though this is doing just fine 1.5 years past that date."
"Cheers!"
"O - Overall a very nice beer. I could see myself drinking this regularly. The best smoked take on a porter I have yet had. I knew I'd be ""overrating"" this beer the second I tasted it."
"O- I think everything about this beer is great, except for the taste. And the taste is by no means bad, just perhaps more one dimensional then some of Stone's other brews."
"Sampled a bottle poured into a pint glass. Appearance is dark with thick, white head. The smell is very smokey with a hint of toffee and malt. The smoke is very dominant in the taste of this beer which is what you want in a smoked porter, however there seems to be a lack of balance. There is a slight estery taste, but it is very subtle and is gone almost as soon as the palate detects it. As the beer warms in the glass the toffee starts to become more pronounced. This beer is good, however I can think of many smoked porters I would reach for before I grab this again."
"Pours jet black into my bruery snifter with a paperthin head that sticks around. Aroma of smoked malts, hops and sweet coffee. Taste follows the nose, this is a really tasty drink, easy to drink, goes down smooth. I could drink a lot of this. Great price as well!"
"O: a great smoked porter, would have liked to see a bit of a better feeling on the palate and a little bit less of an intense baconish flavor, i know it is a smoked porter but im allowed to be picky"
"O - I enjoyed the Stone Smoked Porter, it's another unique beer from Stone. It's brings a little bit of complexity to a standard style. While I like some of their offerings better (they are one of my top 3 breweries), I would have definitely have it again!"
"Overall this is a great brew and worthy of a try. Well done Stone."
"O) At $3.99, this is an excellent value. This beer is an exceptionally good porter and for the price... is awesome. My heart has been captured by Clown Feet's Lubrication, but given Stone's availability and price... this could easily be a close second. I will be buying this again."
"Overall: This is a very good porter. Not my favorite, but it is definitely one that I would drink with regularity."
"O: For whatever reason this felt more balanced than anchor steam. Big on flavor."
"Great balance of sweet smoky. The smoke is not overdone and compliment the beer well. Very nice finish and plenty of flavor."
"Overall this is a very good porter. I like how the smoke flavor is subtle and doesn't overwhelm the rest of the beer. I will definitely drink this again."
"Pours a nearly completely black color, if you look at it at an angle you can see a slight red hinge, has a big offwhite head that actually laces quite a bit. Smell is of sweet sweet delicious bacon, its like walking into an German meat market, i love it. Taste is wonderful, an absolute delight. Has of course a wonderful rich malt flavor and the smoke flavor is really noticeable as well. Mouthfeel is wonderful as well, just a great porter."
"O - A great porter in my opinion, not really a smoked porter, but still very good"
"O: I liked it, don't think I like it as much as fresh, but I do appreciate the direction the beer is going. Having done this, I don't think this will hold up in the mouth beyond a year. I get a lot more licorice like flavor than I can ever remember getting in this fresh, but it's more or less flavor that's remnant of former smokiness. This isn't going to dethrone Alaskan Smoked porter for aging, but I can see it being a worthy experiment."
"Overall, I thought this beer was nice, but not something I would really seek out again. I like porters or stouts with a nice smoky character, but this one was too subtle. The smoke was barely detectable. It was a solid porter though."
"This is a very well made and enjoyable porter."
"Full and rich flavor of dark roasted malts. Coffee-like bitterness attached to the malts that touches all parts of the palate. Very balanced overall, as just a hint of barely sweet dried fruit touches the front of the tongue. Dark chocolate is hidden, but detectable in an off-hand way. The coffee bitterness and mouthfeel is where this beer succeeds. Lingering mouthfeel of coffee and dark roasted malts stays for a long time, enticing you into another sip. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light and airy for such a richly flavored beer. At the same time there is a certain heaviness to it though, probably from the heavy handed use of ingredients Stone is known for. The carbonation is on the higher side as well, giving a little zip to the coffee flavors. This accentuates the flavors in a very positive way, especially for the lighter sweetness that quickly gives way to the bitterness. This is a very good porter, and obviously another quality beer from Stone."
"Drink- I will say it is one of the better in the “smoked” arena. It's just not a favorite of mine. Not gonna bash and give low grade. Still a good beer, because I believe I would enjoy the vanilla variation."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson-brown with a 1 inch foamy tan head that settles to a thin cap. Thin tight rings of lace mark the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt, smoked malt, and some rich dark toasted bread aromas. Taste is of roasted/smoked malt, toasted bread, and some minor cocoa bean flavors. There is an assertive roasty bitterness that sticks around after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a bubbly yet smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good smoked porter from the tap but I prefer the bottled version slightly more."
"Overall, I liked the esters and smokiness and really enjoyed this beer, but not sure it's one I'd come back to regularly."
"Dr: Very drinkable for a smoked beer, but a bit too malty. It's got an average ABV and a high price. I don't think I'd have it again."
"D: Drinkability is pretty good but I expected more smokiness."
"What a fantastic beer!"
"Overall- Great beer hands down, will support this beer to the very end. Well done Stone! Cheers"
"Cheers"
"I let my bottle sit for a couple of months, and it may have been an older bottle, not sure. Judging from a lot of the reviews I'm reading, I assume a little bit of age might have mellowed it out a bit and brought through more of the flavours."
"Overall: A very good version of a porter. Not as smoky as you would expect from the title, but still a good porter."
"Overall - a solid beer. Not overly smokey like some beers of the style can be."
"Overall: A middle-of-the-road porter from a usually exceptional brewery. I can't help but feel that they had the opportunity to make a super-duper smokey porter and instead opted to make something nearly right along the guidelines...oh well. It's solid stuff anyway."
"Overall - A very good porter. Lots of flavor, but still very drinkable."
"O- A good porter, but it didn't quite live up to expectations for me."
"Deep brown colour with some black, one finger of light ta coloured head, some lace at the top of the glass. Smell is of smokey roasted malts, lightly bittersweet notes, black coffee and some sugary caramel and toffee notes. Taste is roasted and smokey, bakers chocolate, moderate hop bitterness, long smokey finish and aftertaste, chocolate and coffee also present in the aftertaste. Medium prickly carbonation, light to medium body, good all around feel. Nice full flavour porter, very drinkable and stout like at points, really good stuff here."
"This beer pours an extremely dak brown to almost black color with very little head. the head that is present is off white to tan in coor. the smell is lightly smokey and roasty but not to malty, which makes me think the beer will not be full bodied. the taste again is lightly smokey which i think makes this beer appealing to a far wider range of people. it is also a little roasty with a thin malty feel to it. this beer is fairly light bodied but it works with the flav ors with fairly ow carbonation. this is a very drinkable beer to break into the smoked beer category."
"Poured half of the bomber vigorously which produces a huge creamy tan head. Settles relatively quick to a point where it's still foamy and substantial, but you can see the beer through it. The foam laces well, and the body couldn't be blacker. Deep black coffee black. Smells very roasty. Smoke and char in the nose. Deep roasted malt flavors. Smoky, with a hint of bitterness. Slight cola and mineral aftertaste, with something that reminds me of toasted marshmallows. A nice carbonation and medium body keeps it from being too heavy, and is superbly drinkable. More hickory smoke and coffee as it warms. A nice after dinner beverage. Finishes dry."
"Really never liked this beer in the past, I could not taste any smokiness in it. They had it on tap and decided to get a small glass of this to try it again and was happy that I did. It is a great beer."
"Really not that smokey to me... at least compared to the german Rauchbier's... just wish this had a bit more smoke flavor... besides that, it's a decent beer. If I drank this beer blindfolded with out knowing what type of beer it was... I would have never guessed it for a smoked"
"Pours a dark brown color that has a nice red hue when held up to the light. Small white head. Scent is chocolate with some liquid smoke and roasted malt. The smokiness definitely comes through in the aroma. Just as it does in the taste. This beer and the Alaskan Smoked Porter are just trademarks for American brewery's attempts at smoked porters. Great smokey malt flavors with a well-balanced chocolate and ""breakfast"" flavor. This beer would go great with some bacon and eggs. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a creamy finish. Drinkability is high. Overall, this beer is tasty as hell...only 3.99 for a bomber, and makes a great marinade for a nice new york steak. This beer is awesome!"
"Tasty but not as smokey as one would hope."
"Overall, this is an outstanding porter. The fact that it is 5.9%ABV makes it all the more impressive. Stone made a nuanced, flavor-packed winner without going into the abv stratosphere."
"Overall a solid good beer. Nothing overly spectacular for me, but very solid."
"I had this one with veal bacon and potatos. Great beer. Really nice work. Might have trouble finishing more than two."
"It's not nearly as full flavored as their other offerings. Decent, but Stone offers many better beers."
"Overall: Probably the best ""smoked"" beer I have ever had and probably on the market. Right amount of smoke that blends perfectly with the other flavors."
"O - Overall a great beer, I prefer a few other porters to this one such as Anchor, and was a little disappointed on the aroma, but for being a brew with the word ""Smoked"" in its name, what more can you expect? Go out and buy a bomber if its in your area!"
"V: A good deal for a bomber at 5.39. However the format will keep me from buying it often"
"Overall, this is an interesting beer, but in my opinion the smokiness should have been toned down a notch or two, as it can prove overwhelming and slightly off-putting."
"Medium bodied with excellent carbonation, this beer sticks around for just the right amount of time. The carbonation really helps this beer's drinkability while also clearing room for the aftertaste to come in at just the right time."
"good and cheap...no super wow factor here just a good brew..."
"Overall this is one of the better porters I've tried."
"Enjoyed on draft at my first trip to the Stone World Bistro. Pours a dark black color with a bit of reddish hue around the edges. Head is not huge, but present with a tan hue and pretty good retention. I got sweet malt aromas with a bit of cocoa powder, dark raisiny fruit and a touch of smoke. Full bodied with a very solid bitterness which follows the Stone style. All in all not as smoky as I was expecting, but actually that works in it's favor as there is balance to be had there."
"Overall, Smoked Porter is a very good, maybe even great, porter. Having it from a growler made it even more special. Four of us split it, two guys and two gals. Everyone claimed to really enjoy it. Fortunately, there is a little left for me to have another pint after everyone had their fill."
"O - The smokiness is actually far more muted than I expected on a smoked porter, but I might be biasing the review by expecting a higher smokiness. The smoke is definitely there, but not inyoface. A good offering that would go remarkably well with a bbqed brisket. I'll revisit this again sometime soon."
"22 ounce bottle. Pours dark brown color with a 2 finger light tan head with great retention that reduces to a fairly thick lacing cap. Some slight lacing sticks to the glass as well. Aromas of caramel roasted malt, some chocolate, and smoke. Aromas are pretty standard for a porter with some good strength as well. Taste of caramel, chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, with some smoke and nutty flavor as well. Decent amount of bitterness on the finish that lingers with coffee, chocolate, and smokey flavors for a bit. Medium carbonation and body. No alcohol noticed in the taste or finish. A decent amount of creaminess is also present, with very smooth drinkability and great flavor balance. Overall, a very nice porter, didn’t blow me away but this is an all around solid brew. Very tasty stuff."
"O: I never knew I would like smokey beers. I tried DFH palo santo once and I DPed it, but after having an east india porter from pretty things, I gained a taste for it and now I'm kinda hooked. I can totally imagine sitting in an old style pub in the 18th century paying a few coppers for a pint of these bad boys."
"O - A truly outstanding beer and example of how all smoked beers should be. Enough smoke to make an impression without overwhelming the palate with smoke."
"O: good smoked beer. I think the style is tough to get right and they did a good job here."
"Black with a giant tan mountainous head. Laces beautifully down my snifter. Classic, familiar roasted malt smell. DON""T LET THE TERM ""SMOKED"" SCARE YOU OFF!! Taste is classic, clean roasted maltiness. Smoke is subdued, not overpowering, slight. A little hop on the end. Flavor is big but with a refreshing, smooth carbonated mouthfeel. Smoke comes alive as it warms. Has a surprising lightness. Excellent porter. The smokiness and bit of hop bite raise the bar on this one. Dry and a little sour/bitter on the finish. This would be a PERFECT dessert beer. The roast and smoke would offset sweetness nicely."
"Pours a dark brown color almost black, with a nice tan to light brown head. In the aroma, faint smokiness, roastiness, and maltiness. In the taste, a small smoke presence and nice roasted coffee. A small hop bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry smoke and roast in the aftertaste. A nice presence of smoke and nice hint of coffee and small hop."
"Overall, this beer is a winner with me and I would reserve it for special occasions as a novel treat."
"Poured from a bomber into a SA perfect pint glass. This pours a dark brown color almost black (especially near the center), good brown foam head, a nice looking porter. The smell is mostly of chocolate, roasted malts, and some caramel, oddly I don't get much smoked smell. Mouth feel is nice, medium thickness with expected carbonation. The taste is very good, more flavor than I expected, here the smoke flavor is present, I taste smoked roasted malts, a slightly burned flavor and there is some hoppiness on the way down, very nice. Overall another great brew from one of my favorite brewers."
"A really flavorful porter with a lot of interesting things going on. A tremendous effort by Stone."
"O: Something I'd like to try again. The vanilla one is amazing."
"O: A great offering from Stone. Maybe not quite my favorite porter, but definitely a good one. For the price, there are better beers out there, but I wouldn't turn this one down if offered to me. A solid B+/A-."
"If you like rich tasting dark beers - browns, porters, stouts, etc. you'll enjoy this, but then again you've probably already had a few of these if your a dark beer lover."
"O: A nice little twist on the style. I like how the smokiness and woodiness are there but not overpowering. Would've liked a bigger aroma and maybe a bit more of a coffee flavor."
"Fuller medium body, nice carbonation, somewhat soft and smooth on the tongue. Drinks nicely and quickly, despite being a darker beer, and the smoke is well balanced with the malty flavors."
"Great stuff, very moreish."
"Serving type: bottle/ and tap"
"I very enjoyable beer if you like this style."
"O: Love this one. One of the best porters I have had. Anytime I see this I will pick one up, it's that good. The taste is very unique. Really enjoyed this one."
"I like how the smoke is brought into the beer without totally dominating the beer. This beer impresses me the most with Stone."
"O - nice from the bottle, just an all around well made beer but way better on tap, much richer and creamier."
"The smoked porter pours out almost like a stout. The liquid looked pretty thick. The color was black and the head was brown. There was some good lacing too. The aroma is lightly smoked and roasted. The taste is a little salty from the smoked malts, but also has a nice roasted quality too with some hops in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is smooth and has a decent body to it. Overall it's not my favorite Stone brew but it's worth trying."
"Overall a good beer and one to share. Bomber is way too much for me. It was an absolute killer match with the smoked wagyu slices I nibbled on while drinking."
"Overall a really nice porter and one of the few smoked beers Ive had. Definitely will pick this up again!"
"Overall this is a solid porter and another great offering from Stone."
"The mouthfeel was medium bodied with a prickly carbonation that scrubbed the sweetness away. I really enjoyed this one and I wonder why I put off trying this one for so long!"
"O: Pretty good, especially for only being $4 for a huge bottle. Another solid brew from Stone"
"Prost!"
"O – A reasonably drinkable porter that seemed to pair well with a slice of cheesecake. I find it to lack the “smoked” feature it so casually advertises – while it is there, I find myself wanting a bit more. On tap it was good but not sure if I would seek this out in bottles."
"I love beers that pour and look like motor oil. The head is thick and sticks to the glass but dissipates quickly. The smell isn't overwhelming, like light roasted coffee that's slightly spicy. Has a silky mouth feel (especially when very cold) and tastes spicier at the back of the mouth as it finishes with a bitter aftertaste. I had this with a slice of 35th anniversary cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory and it worked really well by mellowing out the bitterness with the sweetness of the cake."
"Overall: This is a really good beer, and definitely worth having. I like the recommendation of having it with some grilled/bbq'd food as it would probably be amazing, but it's certainly good on its own as well. Solid flavors and a body that is good as well, but not too heavy and an ABV that isn't going to blow you away, easily one that could be enjoyed for the course of an entire evening."
"Overall enjoyable enough, but rather straightforward; not as complex as other smoked beers I've had (i.e. Surly's Smoke). I won't be going out of my way to get this one again."
"Overall great drinkability, fits in with grilled meats like crazy. I want to bbq now after drinking this, and I like the slight spice finish at the end."
"perhaps if it was labeled just a porter I'd give it a higher rating but the ""smoked porter"" I see on the label has me expecting smoke. Worth trying without doubt and I have to thank liamt07 for my chance at this one"
"The mouthfeel is the best thing about this beer. The moderate carbonation and the way the beer feels on the palate is on point. I just wish the flavor was more substantial. I would like to see an amped up version of this with more smoke and more flavor, such as a Smoked Pumpkin Porter or a Smoked Vanilla Porter."
"Overall this was an awesome brew. I am always a little leary about smoked beers but the flavors in this one melded so well together that it left me wanting more."
"Taste -- here's that smoke! Nice burnt wood and chocolate. Nicely bitter finish. As this one warms, it turns smoother, with the smoked malts integrating better with the chocolate taste. Quite delicious."
"Overall, this is an easy drinking porter."
"Pours a dark brown, light shines through on th eedges quite easily, big poofy khaki head, decent retention. Smell is milder than expected, dark roasted and chared malts are the dominant components with actual smoke taking a backseat and barely making itself known. A touch of earthy hops on the back. Taste brings a nice roasted malt profile, light touches of chared wood and faint chocolate. Again the smoke lacks any sort of umph - ive had beers that contained so few smoked malts they didnt name their beer with that description and they still had more umph than this. Medium bodied, slightly creamy. A nice porter yes - but a weak smoked beer."
"O: Good beer. Had a bottle and broke it out with someone who was a ""huge"" fan. I thought it was pretty simple and straight forward. After 1 bottle I was ready for something else."
"O - This is quite a porter. I wish it was a little more smoky but that might be nitpicking a little."
"Medium to light mouthfeel that drinks very easily. Rock solid porter."
"Overall Drinkability - Decent porter. Could use some more carbonation and more complexity. Good but a little too one dimensional."
"O: Well, it’s my least favorite Stone offering so far – that’s not to say it’s a terrible beer, though. Comparing Stone beers is like comparing the Indiana Jones movies: they’re all good in their own special way, but still, some are just not great. For now, I’ll stick to IRS and Oaked AB for my Stone brews of choice."
"I want to love this beer. Its a classic porter. Poured into a tulip glass. It is dark brown almost black with a little head. More of A ring around the outer edge of the glass. The little ring is strong and leaves pretty decent lacing considering there is so little of it. It reminds me of Guinness. The smoke flavor is overpowering and I think it hides the flavor of an excellent porter. Maybe I will be able to find just a Stone Porter."
"Not really my thing. The high level of smoke and sturdy hopping make this a bitter Porter."
"O - Stone's Smoked Porter is nice and drinkable for how smokey it is and how flavorful it is, too. Overall, a very nice brew."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer. I liked the low profile of the smoke; quite different from most other smoked beers. You cannot go wrong here."
"I was somewhat disappointed with this beer. It's definitely a good beer and had a lot of flavor, but it was just kind of average. Nothing really stood out as being spectacular in this beer. I would definitely drink it again, but there's a lot of other porters I would have before this one."
"Pleasant, very quaffable brew. Tasted at Cueva Bar, on Adams Ave in San Diego."
"Poured into my collector glass at the Porland Spring wine and beer fest. A dark brown/black with a nice espresso coloured foam with great chunky lacing. The smell is smoke times 2. It hits you in the face, but as you wade through it you get to the molasses, a little brown sugar and chared wood. The taste is chipolte that lingers and on top of the coffee notes, a little lime. The mouthfeel is light and smooth with a dry finish. Overall this is a good, easy drinking Porter that is not too sweet and because of the chared wood may pair very well with smoked meats."
"O- Not smokey, but toasty yet this still is a great porter."
"O - Excellent brew! I have trouble really appreciating porters, but this one is easy to enjoy. I also steered away from smoked beers for a long time, but this has sparked my curiosity quite a bit. Might try smoking some salmon with this in the future."
"O- This is a keeper. The chocolate and the smoke are not too overbearing and well balanced."
"MF/O: Lighter body than I expected, bitterness lingers with chocolate. Overall, pretty drinkable stuff right here"
"Overall-This is one of those Stone offerings I always walk by but never purchase. I think It may continue to stay that way. There were some things I liked, but some I didn't."
"O: Really an exceptional porter. Dark, smokey and interesting but with a sunshiney twist."
"One note: the beer had a drink by date of December 2010. I feel like the extra months didn't hurt this beer at all. Not a surprise with a porter style."
"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1 inch head. Good lacing throughout. Smell is rather mild, some roasted malts. Taste is good, malts, some smokiness, a bit of coffee coming through. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
"O-This will be a go to porter for me at any grilled red meat experience; the smoke action is really terrific, hats off to Stone for another great one"
"Overall - Possibly one of my new favorites. It has everything that I like from a dark beer and an edgy (from the smokiness) that puts it above most other dark beers. I'm in heaven. Leave me alone...."
"O: This porter is strong on malt character and light on Hops, as the style usually is. It is not a beer for those sensitive to bitterness. I like it and will have another."
"O: Pretty good smoked porter, they got the smoke level right were it should be, dominant but not completely overpowering (NG unplugged smoked rye). Lots of smoke on the nose but plenty of other flavors come through to balance things out."
"An excellent drinker. A bit less sweet than I prefer, but this brew has enough character to keep me interested."
"Pours a surprisingly big two finger head, I didn't pour it too aggressively. The head is an off white, tan color, and it has some soapy bubbles and some small creamy ones. I can tell the beer is leaving excellent lacing. You cannot see through the body of this beer at all, it is black, but not pitch black, it has hughes of brown and red, which is a little unfortunate for a porter in my opinion. Overall it looks really good, other than that hughes of brown and red. Also, the head has faded more than I would have thought, oh well. As for the smell, it's not really outstanding, I mean it's good, it's what I would expect from stone, but it leads me to think that it's not going to be A- quality, contrary to what the rest of BA says. You get a nice roasted malt smell, but it's not any roastier than most of the stouts that I have had. There are some nice chocolate aromas, and perhaps a small hop aroma as well. Is smells pretty smooth, and perhaps creamy, but overall nothing outstanding on the smell, good, but nothing unique. I really don't know how to rate this on taste, because it is a good beer, all around it's a good beer, but it's really just a little boring. There is nothing wrong with it, but there is almost nothing unique about it in any way. It tastes just like a regular old porter, it's done well, but just very normal. I do get a nice creamy feel to it which is very nice. There are the chocolate and roasted malts in here, and the smallest hop bite, maybe 1 IBU? haha, no but really. Overall I just wish the flavor was more powerful, it's not a very full flavor. I want to give this a 4 on taste because all the flavors are there and it is creamy and smooth, it's just not as flavorful as I would have liked, and it's pretty boring, so 3.5. I have to give it a 4 on mouthfeel because even though the mouthfeel isn't outstanding, the creaminess makes up for it; I mean it's a thin mouthfeel, but at the same time it's creamy. Drinkability is one thing that I will give this beer kudos for, it's a porter, and yet it's not hard to drink at all, it does down very easily. Overall I'm a little disappointed with this beer just because it's not very creative and not very flavorful, but at the same time it's a pretty well done beer and there is nothing wrong with it, so I will for sure enjoy drinking it."
"Finish: Smokey malts"
"Plenty of flavor and solid all the way through. Not really what I would expect from a smoked beer due to it not being very smoky, but it's good and I will get this again in the future. This would be a great session beer, even with the slight astringency in the aftertaste."
"D: wish the smoke was a little more prominent, but otherwise good roasted complexity in this brew."
"overall this is not a bad rauch beer"
"Overall: I think the flavor is very nicely balanced, I do wish the smoke was a little more prevalent in the smell. But overall, a very nice beer."
"O- a nice porter with just the right amount of smoke flavor makes for a smooth tasty porter"
"O: Not really what I would consider a smoked beer. As far out as Stone goes with the hops in some of their beers, it would have been great if they would have done so with the ratio of their grain bill going to smoked malts."
"I really think this is an awesome beer for a few reasons. One, it's drinkable as hell, two, all around well crafted and well priced as far as bombers go, and three, it's a smoked beer, but not overly so, which makes it really approachable."
"O: Just another porter."
"Overall very tasty. I'm surprised at how low the ABV is, most brews with such strong, bold flavors are higher. Very drinkable. I'm sure this is a great beer to cook with."
"Pint at McK's Tavern in Daytona Beach, FL. Review from notes taken shortly after tasting. Pours a very dark brown, basically black, with some ruby edges and two fingers of frothy cream-coloured head. A few spots of lacing on the shaker. Smell and taste are smoked peat, faint whisky note, coffee beans, port wine, chocolate, roasted malt, and a lasting, spicy hop bitterness to end. Rich, fuller than medium mouthfeel, moderate carbonation. Balanced for a Stone beer, though the IBUs are still noticeable. A solid, drinkable porter."
"Pours a very dark brown/black with creamy off white foam that settles down. Laces. Roasted taste, espresso beans. Gritty bitter coffee taste, right up front. Residual harshness. Creamy mouthfeel - very bitter. Flavorful and tasty but difficult drinker. Bitter."
"Pours with very dark body with a big lighter coffee colored head, looks nice. Great smells of malt and smoke. The taste is great with those same predominant flavors jumping out at you while the hops are light. Big thick and full bodied, is lesser on carbonation. At a low %ABV, I'd drink this over and over again."
"D - Great drink for a smoked porter; all the smoke flavors you want packed into a perfect brew"
"(D)- A nice porter. Not overly smoky, but balanced and meshes well into the beer as a whole."
"This is the only product I've sampled from one of my favorite breweries that I cannot stand. I've tried this on multiple occasions while visiting the stone brewery just to see if maybe my opinion would change, but it hasn't. The smoothness of the beer is it's best attribute. The smoky flavor is unappetizing and leaves me wanting to get anything else on the menu in my glass to overpower the flavor. Think I'm done trying to give this a chance and will just leave this off my list of beers I like."
"O: A nice offering, was expecting a little more smoke on the flavor profile, but even without it, I enjoyed it. Love a Stone offering at a lower ABV."
"MF: Tasty and not too heavy bodied for a porter. I'm still pretty new to this style and I think the smoke flavor takes a little getting used to, so I'll probably only have one."
"drinkability is good - i am not the biggest fan of smoked beers but this one has just the right amount of smoke flavor"
"Drinkability - Overall this was well blended and balanced , the flavors work together and I get a smoky aftertaste that reminds me of the charcoal flavor form a rib-eye in fact this would probably be a great pairing with one ."
"Nice black pour, if not a bit watery. Good smell, but where's the smoke? Just kidding, no false advertising puns from now on. Taste was very pleasant, malt and roast all over, with slightly lingering roastiness. East to drink, with just the right amount of carbonation. Maybe the wateriness coming through again. Overall the porter of choice for the supermarket shopper, but nothing that will leave you drooling for more."
"The CPJ"
"D: I enjoyed the subtle smokiness that came through, would pair nice with a gouda."
"Has a medium mouthfeel and a good drinkibility. This is a quality porter and I would definitely recommend."
"D - Not overly smokey (or perhaps normal smokey) for a smoked porter and that might lend itself to more drinkability. However, the well-balanced flavors, especially the hops presence, makes it drinkable for more than just drinkable's sake."
"D - Very drinkable, this beer, with all the taste, is not that filling, and of course, with a lower ABV, it goes down smooth."
"Quite nice."
"I think the reason I had never bought one before is that I usually don't like smoked beers. Often, the smoke dominates the experience with aftertaste somewhere between bacon and ashtray. Stone has hit this one perfectly."
"D- Surprisingly very easy to drink. I love porters and stouts and I will most definitely come back to this one again."
"D: Medium to medium plus (lower notes due to high carbonation)"
"D: Very easy to drink, and I definitely wouldn't mind another. Easy enough to get a bomber of this down by myself, and the smoked flavor adds a facet that sets it apart from many other porters. Will definitely return to this one, particularly if I am cooking something that will match up well with its smoked flavor, and probably even if I'm not."
"Once again, Stone refuses to let me down."
"T: Luckily, the flavors in this one go way beyond the smoky smell. Slight malty sweetness, then bitter dark chocolate and coffee flavors. On the finish, a hint of hops and dark fruit. Throughout the taste, a lot of smoke that almost tastes like smoked meat. It's almost like the smell that you get in your hair when you sleep too close to a campfire. It's not a bad beer, but probably my least favorite of the stone year-rounds. Probably not one I'll go near again any time soon."
"I am pretty sure I liked this more when I have had it previously, as I recall liking it better than I liked this sample. So I won't give up on it. But it just didn't seem to hit too many spots tonight. The bitterness was more than I recalled, and it didn't seem to have the rich malty body I was hoping for. ...But I could be spoiled by Alaskan's Smoked Porter..."
"D: This beer is easy to drink, no doubt about it. It has a lighter body than I would expect from a porter. The cocoa bitterness might get in the way as you drink more, but it's not too harsh. I might buy this again if I happen to find it on sale, but it's not something I would search for."
"D - I'm stumped on this one...the bar had it labled as the regular smoked porter, but I was getting a lot of vanilla notes...I also didn't let this warm up to it's fullest potential...anywho, the smokiness was subtle and the sweetness was at the front...it would drink it again to see any changes"
"Super drinkable. 5.9% ABV? Amazing flavor period. Stupidly drinkable."
"Overall: A really nice beer. The last time I had this was probably 3 years ago and I hated, but now I find it quite mellow and enjoyable with a restrained smoke presence. Good stuff."
"D= Good beer, would only have one pint"
"Overall: A very good smoked porter from the masters at Stone. I'm happy that I have a few more to take care of because it's a 4 hour round trip to get more."
"D - I found this easy to drink. A good rendition of a hard style to nail down by Stone."
"very clean and well structured just not as pleasing as some other favorites of mine."
"Drinkability. A pretty good drinker. Smokeyness is a little much at times, but still goes down pretty good."
"This is an exceptional beer. A dark and delicious brew that pours black with a very light tan head, and displays some lovely ruby tints when held up to a light. The body is full and smooth. Flavors of coffee and roasted malts hit strong on the middle and back of the palate for a very tasty experience. The smokey taste lingers and pleases the palate, and the abundance of flavor creates a healthy thirst for more."
"D- Would enjoy this one again, very easy to drink."
"Overall this beer was more smoky than I remembered however it still isn't robust enough given the ABV. Worth a shot to see for yourself but not worth seeking out."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin, but otherwise satisfying. The drinkability does suffer just a little bit due to the smoke flavors, but that's only towards the end of the 22 ounces. A solid porter."
"From notes at Old Chicago (2002): Pours a deep red black with well formed light tan head and nicely formed lacing. Aromas of roasty chocolate blend perfectly with mild smoky notes. There is a slight spice to the nose, perhaps a combination of the smoke and hops, and a subtle touch of fruit. Great balance of flavors between the sweetness, medium bitter dark chocolate, and light pleasant smoke. Ends on a roasty note with mild smoke and piney hops. Body is slightly creamy and finishes mediumm dry. Very nice drinkable porter. The light smoke adds a really wonderful twist to this brew. Carbonation is nice and prickly up front turning smooth on the the back end."
"22oz bottle. Pours a very dark brown with a thin head. Aroma of smoke, roasted malts and chocolate, but mostly dominated by the smokiness. Taste is a big wallop of smoke. Almost has a slight meatiness to it, but that's in a good way. Also, hints of chocolate and malts I believe, but it is mostly faint. Tasty, smoky and rather smooth for what with the fire flavor and all. Worth buying again for sure."
"I drank it but I wasn't content after doing so. I will have to try another one at a later date because I do like a lot of the Stone beers."
"D: It's decently drinkable...was expecting a bit more to tell you the truth. Certainly a good example of style, but not stellar."
"D-this one goes down slowly but enjoyably. its definitely a porter i'll be recommending to my friends."
"Poured from tap at Speckled Hen. Nice deep dark brown in color with a nice tan head that hangs around. The tan head leaves a very nice lace on the glass. Smell is lacking and is the worst attribute of this beer. But the robust taste of coffee and roasty malt with a nice hop balance makes up for it. Also notes of chocolate and molasses. Also has a great smoke backbone that ties it all together. Very good as would be expected from Stone."
"D- Pretty easy to drink. I'm just not a huge fan of the smoke. Very solid."
"It's a bitter cold evening at the WoodBrew household...just had an incredible dinner...and had a hankerin for something delicious...SCORE!!! Stone SMOKED Porter was a perfect dessert!!! This porter is fantastic the full flavor is perfect against 5.9% ABV. The beer poured into my glass with a beautiful creamy head, which led to perfect lacing just like on a lingerie model!!! The taste has a rich malt character balanced by a nice subtle smoke. I could drink this all night...but not in a binge type fashion. Strongly recommend this to all my hommies!!!"
"D-a really nice beer, super smooth and drinkable"
"A very good example of a smoked porter and another great offering from Stone Brewing. Well made porter infused with very nice smokey notes in the aroma and taste."
"Pours a deep, almost opaque, ruby with a light tan head. Smell is mostly chocolate and coffee with a slight hint of wood smoke. Mouthfeel is characteristically light with the mocha flavor dominating. Slowly gives way to the bitterness, but not too much, and the slight hint of smoke. An excellent example of a porter that's light, easy to drink, and goes great with being snowed in."
"Pours a deep brown with a frothy two-finger light brown head. Awesome lacing and head retention. Not much in the aroma department. Smells of faint smoke in the distance. Flavor beings with dark chocolate and roasted coffee notes. Subtle malt sweetness. A bit of crisp hop flavor kicks in for a short stay until an underlying smokiness finishes off the beer and lingers into the aftertaste. The smoke is all well incorporated in this beer as any I have tried."
"D: goes down easily; I could session this brew. Not a huge fan of porters in general, but this is among the best I've had."
"D - This is essentially a roasted/smoked IPA. The porter characteristics show up early in the nose and taste, but the hops take over and pretty much wipe them out. This is the first porter I can think of where most of the finish is grapefruit, but occasionally chocolate/caramel sticks its head in for a moment. Most American porters I've tasted are really junior stouts. This is a brew that follows the American west coast trend of making it all about the hops. It's not my idea of a porter, but hop heads are likely to enjoy the experience, especially if they also like their malts well-roasted."
"D-Very drinkable, almost too drinkable, that bomber didn't last me nearly as long as I was hoping"
"D - A nice beer from Stone that I wouldn't hesitate to try again. Alcohol percentage makes it a easy drinker."
"D: A good representation of the Smoked Porter style giving out all the flavors that one would come to expect, but not too much of any one aspect. The average alcohol and carbonation make this an easy beer to sit down and enjoy and goes very well with a Texas style smoked BBQ, such as a chopped brisket sandwich."
"D- About 1 or 2 of these is all I could get through (22oz bomber) Would have been better paired with some food but for $4.50 its a pretty good deal."
"This beer pours a dark brown, not quite black, with a one finger super spongy looking light khaki head. I'm surprised that this isn't darker. The foam looks great but the lack of true black isn't what I look for in a porter. It smells or rich, woody smoke and is pretty appealing. It's a little more subtle than I'd like but it is solid. I prefer a good amount of smoke. I'm not getting any of the hoppyness that others have mentioned. The flavors are solid but not awe inspiring. It's a little sweet on the palate and as you swallow you get the char, wood, and smoke. It doesn't really have any coffee to it. I'd describe this as pretty mellow. This drinks exceptionally smooth and is in between medium to full in body. I do like the after taste but again, I'd prefer more smoke. This beer is solid but nothing too special. It's very drinkable though and worth it for the $4.99 per 22oz bottle."
"D - This is quite drinkable. The only problem is the ashy flavor. It just seems to get a bit grating as you progress through the glass. The bitterness and hoppiness were appreciated, however."
"I felt like for a porter it had a bit much of a hops aroma, typical Stone, had this with two other people and we all felt the same. I love Porters but thought this was not a great smoked porter. Color, pour and head were excellent, it's a well made beer but not for me. I Porter is one of my favorite styles, but this I'll probably reach for something else."
"This beer pours a nice dark ruby,mahogany hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a creamy one finger head and some sporadic lacing,i must admit on smell i was expecting it to be really smokey but suprisingly it just has a nice smokey,bacon background aroma to it which allows the other aromas of dark berries and subtle piney hops to make themself known,it has a nice light-medium bodied mouthfeel to it which is perfectly carbonated and really suits the style and the taste is more smokier than the aroma with hints of smoked wood,bacon,coffee,light pine,dark fruits and finishes with a rich bitter chocolate bitterness which definately leaves you wanting another sip and overall its a really nice drop and one of the rare smoked porters than isnt overpowered by its smokiness but you know is always there and could easily drink more than the one of."
"The beer pours a very dark brown color with a large tan head. The aroma is a very nice mix of smoke. roasted malt and chocolate. The smoke compliments the other flavors and doesn't overshadow them. The flavor is more of the same. I get a lot of chocolate and roasted malt, with the smoke mixing very well. The beer tastes smokier than the aroma, but it is still not overwhelming. Very easy to drink. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. One of my favorite smoked beers and a beer that goes very well with barbecue brisket."
"A great drinking porter. Highly recommended."
"Verdict: A worthy porter. Smokey accents are well recognized and the taste is well rounded and robust with flavor. Porter lover? Worth it! A- (4.2)"
"Very drinkable. A pleasure to drink"
"Not as a big of a body as expected so pretty light. The flavors move quickly so it keeps you drinking."
"Drinkability-Highly drinkable, an awesome porter. I might have to keep a bottle of this in the fridge at all times."
"Ice cream like head of four fingers. Had to wait for some time before I could get to the beer. Lace for a week, clings like glue. Color is a 39 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is coffee, chocolate, smoke, toffee, and malt. Taste is very intense roasted coffee, dark chocolate, black strap molasses, toffee, and malt. Smoke flavor and feeling in the back of my throat. Big mouthfeel, chewy, full, thick. This is one of my favorite styles of beer, and this as a good one. Got to have more of this one."
"Very creamy and smooth. ABV is non-existant, and quite quaffable. Not a great intro into the style, but a good smoke beer."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. This is one of the best porters I've ever had. I would definitely recommend trying this. Once again, Stone does not disappoint."
"The smoked character is the standout of both the taste and aroma, but it has a ham-like quality that I try to avoid in smoked beers. I would have used a similar amount of a more well-rounded smoked malt. More smoke, less meat."
"D - This is just a nicely balanced brew!! I paid $4.39 for the bomber I'm sampling from, and i would pay that any day of the week to have this beer stocked in my fridge. Unbelievable complexity...Stone just continues to impress with each beer I sample."
"A nice well made beer."
"D - This has pretty good drinkability. It goes down fairly easy, and is a decent porter. It is not my favorite of the style, but I think it's pretty good."
"Very nice and not bitter. Compared to several other Stouts and porters that we recently purchased to ""try"". For this particular beer it seems that our tastes in the realm of the popular opinion, whether or not that is good thing remains to be seen - because everyone has their own tastes, likes and dislikes!"
"*came back to edit my review because I poured the other half of my beer in the glass thinking maybe my pouring was the problem but it over foamed again, knocks down the drinkablilty, cant drink foam right?"
"Overall, a very nice beer, worth trying when you see it."
"Smooth beer with a slight bitterness, nice smokey flavor - not too overpowering. The smokiness is not very present in the nose. I would say it's a very good representation of the style and a beer worth checking out!"
"Drinkability - This is a Porter that has strong character and flavor. It's perfect for the bitter cold evenings. The smokey aroma and flavor are really prominent and, to some extent, started to distract me. Not a great deal, but some. It's still a great, well rounded Porter. One that I will pick up again and again. I could drink this in moderation with extreme pleasure."
"D: Relatively low gravity beer, weighs in at just 5.9% ABV, and not overwhelming to the palate. I almost wish it was a little heavier to balance out the flavor, but it's still a great beer. If there is such a thing as a session porter, this just might be it."
"I still recommend this one whole heartedly. Give this one a go if you can! Cheers!"
"Flavor is light up front with some a touch of roast and chocolate. In the finish, the intensity picks up quite a bit with even more roast, as well as some hoppiness and slight smoke/char character. The roast and bitterness intensifies the dryness in the finish while leaving a lingering feel. The smoke level is low, and because of this, impresses me most with food (oysters, steak, toast and cheese.) A nice touch to a simple, solid porter base."
"The beer pours a deep amber almsot black color, and yet you can still faintly see through it. The aroma of this beer is caramel malt, and a hint of smoke and roasted malts. The taste is smooth, more caramel then roasted flavor or smoke flavor, yet there are hints of both. The mouthfeel is medium for a porter. This beer is very drinkable."
"22 oz bottle. Pours dark brown with a foamy, tan, long lasting head. Aroma of roasted malt with hints of coffee and chocolate. Medium, slightly tangy body. Flavor of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate and molasses. Finish is long, espresso coffee. Tasty, easy drinking porter."
"Nice bitterness and a good bite to it. Tastes a little thin, but to be fair to this brew I'm drinking it right after an RIS so maybe this is bound to feel like a light beer. The one thing about this beer that I was a little disappointed with was the nose. The smokiness doesn't come out in the aroma as much as some other beers. Altogether though, worth drinking and recommended as a decent example of the style."
"Poured a nice dark brown color from a 22 fl oz bottle, with the gargoyle, ""best-by"" and ABV on the label. Good, solid frothy tan head that dissipates slowly, with excellent lacing. The aroma is predominantly roasted coffee/malts, with a hint of chocolate. Taste is a very good, robust blend of dark chocolate, roasted coffee and malts with a slightly bitter yet perfectly smooth finish making it a highly drinkable brew. This solid, robust porter is highly recommended to every porter lover. Another solid brew from Stone."
"I think stone for this very ""unstone like"" beer. It's a very different porter and a truly interesting experience. Scored as an alone drink and not as something to pair with food. Scores would go up in taste to with the right pairing. By itself this is very interesting but doesn't rank that highly."
"Very nice porter, extremely drinkable. I was expecting significantly more smoke character, and would score this beer higher if the smoke was more in balance."
"I have to be honest. I was drawn to this beer by the price as much as I was by the reputation. Actually, the reputation of Stone is good beer at a reasonable price, so I am right on the money, so to speak. The appearance of this porter is very dark, almost a deep purple when pouring. It produced a thick, light-colored head, which in turn produced a thick patterned lace. The smell was average, above average for porters. Faint hints of chocolate, and coffee can be detected if you strain your nose. But the taste is where this beer shines. The start is full of chocolate and coffee, with a nice full-bodied mouthfeel. The finish reveals a nice light slight bitter smokiness that mingles with the coffee still on the palate. In all this porter is a very drinkable session beer, that would go with just about any meal. Seriously."
"Very tasty beer, lots of complex flavor and perfectly balanced. Not easy to drink more than one of these though."
"Surprisingly light for the color. Not syrupy at all, and good carbonation, leading to excellent drinkability."
"D- Because of it's smoothness, I could drink this brew all night! I recommend this one for sure!"
"Some smoke in the flavor, very subtle and complementary to the overall effect rather than dominating. There is some fruitiness, dates. An easy-drinking session beer, more flavorful than Guinness, somehow the appearance and overall roasted effect keeps bringing up the comparison."
"D-VERY high, the abv at 5.9 is something that would make this a nice candidate for sessioning a porter"
"D - Fantastic. Easily approachable and a fine porter to share with family and friends."
"D - A very nice porter and the smoke adds an extra dimension to it. Get it."
"Taste: Fairly dry (stout-like), smoky, and bitter. Slight smokiness blends with quite bitter chocolate. Burnt licorice notes in the middle. Dark sweet wood. Quite carbonated. Smokiness comes through more at the finish which is dry, chocolaty, a little oaky, and lightly roasty."
"D: It's easy to drink, but not particularly memorable. As earlier, a great intro to smoked beers, but it's not very smoky. A pretty good value for what it is, but not particularly distinguished."
"The mouthfeel is defined by decent carbonation and a medium body. For a porter, this is nice but just a touch on the light side. The drinkability is excellent, mostly due to the fact it's not terribly extreme in the taste department. Let's call that the smoked porter catch 22. I can't imagine one being a 5 in taste and in drinkability. A worthy beer for those who are worthy."
"This is a very tasty, easy drinking, fairly well balanced porter. However, I was looking for more smoke flavors and aromas considering the name of the beer."
"Overall, this is a fantastic porter, and another very solid beer from Stone."
"Drinkability: Another win for Stone. This is an excellent porter with a rich, smoky flavor. It's more sessionable than most of Stone's other offerings, which only makes it better in my opinion. Definitely worth a shot and definitely something I'll have again."
"Of the porters I've tried, this is the best so far."
"Very drinkable, nothing wrong with this beer at all. I would have had another if there wasn't cask Ghandi-Bot."
"Drink Ability: for a porter I can drink this all night. Don't know how I'd feel in the morning, doesn't really matter because I wake up in the afternoon anyway."
"Overall - Nice Porter with a touch a smokey flavor in the background, but only enough to enhance the other flavors."
"I was definitely worried about this being expired, especially at only 6% ABV, but it didn't disappoint. I'm sure the flavors were probably more mellow than when it was bottled, but they still were delicious. Stone is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries."
"Not my favorite porter, but it drinks easily so I'd have no problem finishing a bomber of this."
"D: Don't be fooled by the 'smoked' descriptor here--unlike Alaskan Brewing's own smoked porter, this beer is a versatile, mainstream porter first and a smoked beer second. The phantom of smoke found here enhances this beer without type-casting it as something only to be served when a true rauchbeer is required."
"This is an interesting, light, yet complexly flavored porter. A beer that is more about the taste than the alcohol. Very sessionable."
"Ive always loved Stone and just found another of their beers I can always have in my fridge."
"More cocoa than smoke in the flavor; rich bodied and smooth. The finish is like powdered hot chocolate. Good hop aftertaste, which I wasn't expecting. Overall, a very interesting porter on tap."
"D- is quite drinkable ."
"dark brown with a hint of amber, short tanish off-white colored head. the smell is a robust combination of smokey roasted chocolate. the flavor follows the smells, a nice roasty feel to it with hints of chocolate and coffee. nice carbonation give it an umph but still give you that rich toasty aftertaste. Well Done!"
"Tulip glass pour and I am met with a dark brown ale and a nice fluffy tan colored head. Aroma is truly nice and smoky as it should be. Dark chocolate abounds with some dark fruits and black coffee also. Spicy and bitter in the taste. The taste starts initially as spicy but then throws a coffee tasting bitterness followed by a campfire smoke-like swallow. Works very well. The only thing I really wasn't digging was the mouthfeel. It was rather thin for such a chewy tasting beer. Very easy drinking though the ""smoked"" part of the porter may be a little much for some. Great take on the smoked porter from Stone."
"This beer pours an almost balck color with a large white lead tha laced and stayed throuhout the beer. It smells smokey with a strong chochlate smells. The taste is smoth, lots of choclate flavors, with a nice dry porter flavor. Finishes with a nice bitter licrose taste. A nice full lasting flavor. Overall a fantasitc beer, top porter i ever have."
"D - Great drinkability."
"D - For such a dark one I could keep going with this."
"D-This is a very solid contribution from Stone, but not a favorite among their fine year round and seasonal line up."
"I love Stone beers and I took a chance on this beer on the recommendation of my server. Black color with a tan head. Malty aroma wit with chocolate. Has a nice flavor of unsweetened chocolate, coffee and malt. Just the right amount of smokiness. Not overpowering at all. Slighly spicy, perfect balance of sweetness and bitterness. Full feel in mouth and drinks very smooth. Very flavorful. Highly recommend this beer."
"It is a bit mixed up but overall it is a decent brew."
"22oz Bottle poured into english pint glass. Beautiful dark brown with ruby highlights that you can actually see light through towards the bottom of the glass. Large head with good lacing. Aroma of roasted malts, coffee, alcohol and a little smoke. Taste is a little more smoke, hops, coffee, roasted malts. Very good porter."
"D - Pretty easy drinker, has some nice flavors going on, slightly strong aftertaste but nothing over the top. Kinda comparable to a stout, but obviously a porter. Goes down pretty smooth & normal. Overall pretty nice drinker with some great notes of chocolate and coffee and alcohol all at the same time. Thumbs up. Poured into a pint glass."
"This porter isn't especially thick, nor is it especially malty, but it is quite unique. The malts seem a little restrained, but I suppose that's to let the smokiness through. Also, I have to give them credit for not making the smoke too powerful...if they had, that'd have ruined the beer."
"D - Definitely drinkable, leaves a powerful smokey aftertaste with every sip."
"This is a great beer. I really like the smokiness in the finish."
"D - This is an excellent beer and stands out among the best."
"D - A very good porter that the smoke didn't overtake like some do. Easy to drink and well balanced."
"D: great porter, love the char and smoke."
"Very high. Nice smooth finish, easy drinking porter."
"Overall: Delicious! Not too much smoke resulting in a great balance of flavor."
"Overall this a fine brew, nearing the absolute top class of porters in my book."
" This is a heavy bodied brew but still quite surprisingly pretty high on drinkability. I would definitely recommend this porter to anyone who enjoys great dark beers, or great beer for that matter. Enjoy!"
"D: I can't give a smoked beer a 5 on drinkability because I find the smoky flavors don't quite go down smoothly enough, but this is about as good as it gets."
"A very drinkable smokey porter. A bit more Alc, hops, and mouthfeel would be preferable. not overwhelmingly smokey."
"Beer is medium bodied and has this mild sweetness to start and finishes out with a some nice roast and mild smoke. I really enjoyed this beer and the elaborations on the beer with the different flavors."
"Mouthfeel was good. More ale like than stout like, making this a fairly easy to drink beer. It just wasn't a beer I was excited to drink."
"Salud!"
"Drinkability: This is a big porter and a great beer especially so with the smoke. Easy to drink. That said, bring it on."
"Easy drinking and relatively light, yet complex and balanced. Excellent offering from Stone!"
"Very balanced, with just enough smoke to make it interesting, and pairs very well with smoked meat and an aged Gouda. Started off drinking it by itself but ended preparing a cheese plate just for it with Polder 1-year goat Gouda and Cowgirl Creamery Mt Tam (triple cream). So satisfied!"
"A very enjoyable and easy to put back smoked beer, at least compared to the few I've yet tried. Perfect as an accompaniment to watching this week's episode of Weeds - Stone is 'advertised' in the show!"
"This beer was a bit of a let down for me, but only relative to my expectations. It's a solid, delicious beer that I enjoyed it quite a bit and would buy again."
"Mouthfeel a bit thin for the style. Very drinkable. I will drink this beer again."
"Very smooth, heavy bodied. Nice carbonation for a porter."
"Overall, being a huge fan of smoked beer, I thought the smoke was underplayed by quite a bit. Maybe my bottle had a touch of age on it so it had faded but this is a porter first and a smoked beer a distant second (or maybe not at all?) But besides that, it truly is a delicious porter and I would seek it out again."
"Not really being familiar with the porter style of beers, I am hesitant to rate this too high, since there may well be something much better out there. Still, I am going to give this a 7 out of 10 based on it being much more flavorful than I expected based on the nose, and the drinkability of it. Definitely will have this again, next time, I WILL have some BBQ ready to go with it!"
"Overall: presumably forgettable, albeit highly quaffable. Good stuff"
"It's low in alcohol, it has light body, so you could drink a few, but the question I'd ask myself is, what's the point? Yet, the fact remains that it could be a solid session beer."
"- Overall one of the best porters out there readily available in 22oz. bottles. I was just thinking to myself that too many are all the same... and then comes Stones. Stands out for sure."
"Drinkability - Relatively so. I need to let this beer warm up a bit more but as of now the jury is out. It is a good beer, and I do like a good porter. However, something about the style is just holding me back a bit. Still, I can't wait to try to Beer Geek Bacon beer that I have in the refrigerator. Should be interesting to compare the two!"
"I poured cold and tasted it there, then warmed it up to see the balance of flavor across temperatures. I personally preferred the flavor when on the warmer end of the temperature spectrum. It's more smooth and feels more balanced and is like drinking a regular porter with a treat of some smoke."
"Conclusion: this was a good porter that bordered on a stout. While it was good, I wouldn't be rushing back to drink it. There was something about made me want to move on. I might buy this on occasion or if I was complementing a dessert."
"A decently drinkable porter. I will be getting more. Pairs nice with ""Wicked Sharp"" cheese. Would go well with BBQ chicken."
"Drinkability - If i was told to make a list of 5 porters to drink , this would make it. It has everthing i look for. A great example of a smoked porter. Easy to drink, affordable price and great avaiblity. World class beer."
"There's no reason I wouldn't drink a few of these in a sitting, though I couldn't down them all too quickly. This is a great effort at a smoked beer."
"The beer pours a very dark brown, but has the tiniest of ruby highlights, the tan head is nice and laces well. I detect a wee whiff of smoked malt, along with some chocolate malt and a hint of fresh roast coffee. Ok the taste is a roast coffee with a touch of bittersweet chocolate; the smoke is subtle and does not dominate. The beer is smooth but has a bit of bitterness to dry the back end out, the carbonation is right on. I like this beer goes well with some smoked oysters."
"M & D - It is smoother and creamier than the pour indicates with a nice full body and great carbonation. Lower ABV makes this an extremely easy to drink and repeatable beer."
"Conclusion: Really tasty beer; bold, but balanced."
"Drinkability: This is an excellent porter and another great brew from Stone. Unlike many of Stone's beers, this makes for good sessioning, but mostly makes a great dessert."
"Drinkability is spot on. Perfectly balanced between smokey, roasty, rich, and earthy, with just the perfect amount of sweetness to emerge to complement everything else that's going on. Really well put together beer."
"D_Easily put down a few of these."
"Pours an opaque dark brown with tan head. Head starts of really thick, but as it dissipates it leaves an incredibly thin layer on top. Some spotty lacing. Smells of smoke and roasted malt, though the smoke isn't as huge as some smoked beers. Lots of roasted flavour. Body is thinner than some porters, but it is on the verge of almost being creamy. I expected more smoke based on the name, but still a tasty beer."
"D: A very good beer and the smokiness does not interfere with the roasted deliciousness"
"D - Great porter! Really enjoyed coming back to this one as my palate has developed over the years and I can appreciate it a lot more!"
"Don't drink and review."
"D - Overall a pretty great brew. I mostly have had hopped up beers by stone so its great to see that they have great flavored beers along side of hop bombs. Enjoyable perfect porter."
"Appearance is magnificently thick and rich poured into a clear pint glass leaving a couple...oops, I poured too hard...three and a half fingers of cream colored head with wisps of tan throughout. The aroma is smoky and full of that charred porter goodness that many of us love. The smoke is so well balanced here that it flows seamlessly through the flavor. They do not joke when they suggest barbecue on the bottle. The flavors are sweet and malty up front with the smoke beginning to rise in the mid-palate and by the time that roasted char comes through in the finish the smoke peaks and hangs around like a campfire in the early morning. An interesting beer that should be given a try by anyone, especially those who think porters aren't as exciting as hoppier beers."
"Medium/light body with medium carbonation, smooth with a crisp mouthfeel."
"Tasted great with my stir-fry, though would have tasted just as good with dessert, barbeque, or McDonalds'. Delicious, but considering the price I won't seek this out again."
"This is one of the best beers I have had in a while. This is defiantly my favorite beer from Stone hands down."
"I really like this beer. Plenty of flavour but smooth, silky and easy to drink. A solid and really good beer."
"Pours a deep dark brown with a big creamy tan head. Aroma of roasted & sweet malt, coffee, and chocolate. Taste is chocolate, roasted malts, and some nice subtle smokiness. The body is a little on the thin side, but this still has a nice creamy mouthfeel, with soft carbonation. Overall, this is a very flavorful and drinkable porter, I enjoyed it."
"Great example of a porter"
"Drinkability: It's been a while since I've had a porter (which were my beers of choice for a couple of years). This is a very enjoyable porter that I can easily down a bottle or two in a sitting. Great price for the quality that Stone always delivers."
"Mouthfeel is bang-on - low natural carbonation. A very nice beer to drink - a really mild, subtle smokey profile not at all typical of a smoked beer."
"It's really satisfying and tasty. And at the totally reasonable price of $5.25 a bomber, which I paid, I absolutely will be buying this again. Once again, more proof Stone's offerings are rarely matched."
"The mouthfeel is great, so incredibly smooth it surprised me with that aspect. Not thin in body at all, it's full and delicious. Makes it drinkable as hell because it goes down so fricken easy, I Like it, great representation of a porter"
"M/D: Very drinkable and smooth. Good beer, not the best, but very good."
"The smokey malts and subtle, punchy hops mingle perfectly"
"Lots happening in the nose and mouth, but a litte too strong in flavor and bitterness to be highly drinkable."
"D. A good smoked porter from Stone. I would put this alongside Maui's CoCoNut porter but Alaska's version is still my favourite. Still, it is a beer that I like and could easily drink a lot of."
"Served from tap into a standard pint. Pours a dark dark brown with a one finger off white head. Maintains nice lacing throughout. The aroma was smoky with subtle malt notes. The flavor was of malt, nutty, and woody notes. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall all of the flavors in this brew were very subtle and tame. I actually liked this so you could taste the woody flavor imparted on it. The aroma was a little disappointing, but okay. Have very nice drinkability, but was not my favorite from Stone for sure. Still quite good though."
"cheers!!"
"It is very drinkable for a dark/smokey beer. Goes down very smooth."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and very sessionable. It's a good representation of the style and I will definitely have it again."
"Final Notes: A good beer to serve with barbecued or grilled foods, or as an after-dinner treat. Another solid offering from Stone."
"1 pt. 6 fl. oz. bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 5.9%. Black colour, moderate beige head. Interesting aroma of roasted and smoked malts, blending seamlessly together with notes of chocolate, hints of dark fruits. The flavour is first fruity, then chocolatey and smoky, but the smoke is not overdone. Some hoppy and roasty bitterness in the finish. This is an excellent and well balanced beer!"
"Overall this is a tasty porter. Not my favorite, but still damn good."
"An impressively crafted beer."
"One 22 oz of this beer per meal is my limit. Then I want to go on to some other style."
"Overall impression: Excellent restrained use of smoky flavor. Top notch."
"D - All in all this is a decent beer, but by no means one of the better porters I have tried. The smoke seems like a bit of a novelty to me."
"Overall: not the best porter I have ever had but good none the less. after a while the bitterness got to me on the finish so I had to knock off some points for that."
"Drinkable beer, not the best I have had from Stone."
"D - Solid beer, great with the grilled steaks I had for dinner (and it pairs well with ANY grilled food). 22oz went down pretty easy and for $4 it's a deal that's impossible to beat. Nice job, Stone!"
"Pours from the bomber a nice medium black color, with some decent light brown foam on top. Aromas of smoke, roasted malt and dark chocolate. Some dark fruits on the palate, maybe cherries, figs and plums, along with the ever present smoke. Solid, but not my favorite."
"Served on draft into a pint glass. It appears a very dark brown color with a tan head that doesn't retain too well outside of a thin lace on top of the brew. Nose has a classic porter aroma with roasted malt coupled with what seems like Pete smoked malt dominating the back end. The taste of pete smoked malt also dominates the flavor that lingers through the long aftertaste. Medium feel and moderately carbonated. As it warms, more standards porter characteristics come through to win the fight of porter verse smoked malt. Flavors of bitter chocolate and coffee also come through in the nose. Pretty good with some citrus hops even evident in the finish."
"Drinkability -- This beer didn't quite meet all my expectations. I would've preferred it to be a little more smooth and more sweet malt character to balance out the smoke and acridity. Not bad, but not spectacular."
"Very smooth. Lower alcohol content makes it easily drinkable, but with the stronger flavor I probably wouldn't drink more than one."
"Drinkability: not an everyday beer but a treat. Great with food. Smoke is well done and doesn't taste like imitation smoke flavoring."
"D= Great brew. I love smoked porters to death. Porters are my favorite and when they get smoked it's awesome. This beer didn't let down. Delicous and complex without too much smoke in it. Seek this out."
"About half way through the sip my mouth seems to dry out. i get this sometimes with some smoked beers. It's really wierd and it's like cottonmouth. It's not a terribly bad thing and pretty subtle but I'd prefer it wasn't there. I don't even have a clue as to what causes it. The carbonation level was too high as well."
"I might be committing some type of sin by saying this, but I might actually like this beer a bit more than Stone's classic Arrogant Bastard. Though I couldn't rate any one section as perfect, I felt that nearly every aspect of the tasting was ALMOST perfect. Again, this is an extremely complex beer which is very drinkable; the balance is the one thing which I most want to emphasize. Beers like this are what keep me coming back to the Stone Brewing Company."
"Taste is smokey as you would expect, but not overly so as in some smoked beers. There are nice chocolate undertones and a hint of caramel. This is a solid beer but not spectacular."
"Cheers!"
"So different from the other, heavy alcohol stouts and ales I've been enjoying lately. An absolute standout beer."
"Overall, one of my favorite porters AND offerings from Stone. Man this beer is awesome. Taste is something special and it really hits your tastebuds hard. I love it and I wish I had another to drink tomorrow..."
"D - Fairly filling, but pretty easy to drink. A very good beer that I would be happy to drink again."
"Bomber to tulip yields a very dark, red hued brew, verging on black. Mocha colored head abounds. Delicious looking brew we have here. Roasted malt and coffee notes fill the nose. Almost similar to an iced coffee scent. Taste is big toasty maltiness, slightly smokey, though not overly so. Very good example of a robust porter. This porter feels surprisingly light in the mouth, not overly heavy in the least. Drinkability on this brew is good, due to the moderate alcohol content, and also in part of the great taste. Great brew to pair with some grilled steaks or what have you. I surely would have another."
"No my favorite Stone offering, but I would drink it more if it were available in Iowa."
"Again, for a smoked beer I found this more drinkable than most. It has a relatively low abv that doesn't come across in the flavor and the body is good, but not filling."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle in a tulip stout glass. Poured black in the center and deep red around the edges, had a nice fluffy head that sticks to the glass. Smelled like coffee, chocolate, smoked meat. Taste was like coffee, licorice, hint of raisin, malt, finishes dry with a little hop bitterness. Felt nice and round in my mouth. I would definitely buy this again."
"Poured from a bomber. Pours a nice deep reddish/black color. Solid head that quickly thins out. Solid lacing. Smell is of light smoke and malts. Taste is very very enjoyable. Roasted malts stick out, along with a mild smoke sensation. I was suprised with this Porter. I really enjoy what Stone has to offer, and this just adds to the list of my likes!"
"22 oz. bottle. Pours a clear reddish-brown color with a good, frothy tan head, good lacing. Aroma is caramel and roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, dark fruits, a hint of wood, and a touch of citrus hops. Flavor is roasted malts, sweet chocolate, a hint of smoke at the end, and a bit of earthy hops. Mouthfeel is medium, creamy but drying, and bitter at the end. I like this beer a lot, I'm not a big smoked fan but I like that it can be one of the many flavors."
"I could see this becoming I buy more regularly. It is tasty enough to take down a bomber while watching Southpark with the wife. Half way through it though, she asked me if I had been smoking a cigarette!"
"beer, it is pretty much without flaw."
"1 1/2-2 finger tan head that leaves a lot of lacing. The nose is very smokey, lots of roasted malt, chocolate and coffee. The taste is cary stong of chocolate and roasted malt with a good bit of coffee in the back round. Very sweet, a get slight bits of caramel as well that I did not pick up in the nose. Very minimum hop bitterness. Great mouthfeel, very smooth and easy to drink. This is a great beer and one of the best porters ive had in a long time. Very enjoyable to drink."
"Overall - Even with the higher than anticipated carbonation this is a hugely drinkable beer. Very nice clean and balanced flavor."
"D: It was good, and stone has yet to disappoint me."
"A well done beer by stone, I would buy this again for sure."
"D) A well crafted porter. Not over the top with the smoke just right."
"OVERALL: A very tasty smoked porter to say the least. A very complex flavor profile and everything blends together excellently. I quite enjoyed this one, and the bomber emptied far too quickly. One I'll be on the lookout for whenever I get a chance to cross the border. Recommended."
"Well, not a bad beer at all, possibly could my bottle have improved by storing it."
"Poured a deep and dark brown/black, with a light brown head. The lacing remained thick and all over the glass. The smell is that of malts. The initial taste is roasted chocolate with a smokey/burnt finish. Smooth and thick feel with the perfect amount of carbonation makes this a lovely porter. This is definitely one of the best porters that I have tasted, will have to buy this again."
"D - As usual a great offering from the folks at Stone. This is full-bodied, beautiful, and flavorful."
"D - I guess I was expecting a lot more smoke and burnt malts. The sweet chocolate taste is what made this really shine. This was a good beer - nothing flashy, yet it held my interest."
"Overall a good buy. I will definitely think about enjoying this with another steak, follow by some desert!"
"Drinkability: Great for the price, there are a few I would grab over it but it is still a great representation of the style."
"D: A very good pour. This is one to be reserved as a nightcap or saved to be had with/for dessert."
"22 oz. bottle. Moderately strong and complex aroma that's primarily dark chocolate and licorice with a dark fruit element, maybe dark cherries or blackberries. Color is a deep ruby, almost black, with a inch thick, creamy, espresso-colored head that quickly subsides to a fine layer which laces thinly down the glass. I don't know what Koch is talking about because the peat malt is unquestionably the defining character of this beer. Still, it's not overwhelming so you can still enjoy the bittersweet chocolate malt behind it. The texture could be a bit thicker but the beer still manages to be rather creamy and soft. All in all this is a damn fine beer."
"D- Will drink again but not sure when... if givin i'll put it down. Cheers!"
"Drinkable? Yes. Rather."
"d - Overall this was an interesting porter. I didn't think it smelled too smoky but the taste certainly lived up to the name. The smell was sweeter (which I kind of liked better) than the taste, but it was still pretty good. I'd give it another shot."
"Overall, a very good beer."
"Overall Impression: A near perfect balance of flavors with the right amount of carbonation. One of the best Porters I've had to date. Stone strikes gold yet again - Black Gold"
" It has a very ,smokey not to be redundant, taste with undertones of cream and choclate ""very earthy"". This beer has an exceptional mouth feel and a very nice nutty aroma . With that said i am always more of a stout man myself but Stone is a great company and i definitly recomend this to all you advocaters."
"This beer goes great with BBQ, chocolate/vanilla, spicy foods. A very versatile beer that pairs well with many food items."
"D - quite drinkable although I'd probably stop after one. 3.0"
"M/D: Despite my initial impression of this beer's viscosity as somewhat thin, the feel is really anything but. More substantial than some stouts that I have enjoyed, the feel is creamy and smooth. The carbonation that produced that nice thick and creamy head has disappeared, and allows my sips to slide down my throat. This is a very enjoyable beer, and I reached the end of the bottle before I expected to, as it goes down so easily."
"D- The smoke isn't overpowering and works well with food. Every bite of breakfast left me taking another sip. Cant wait to have this with some bbq."
"D: I've had this one sitting around for about six months or so, figuring that a Stone porter could handle it, but now I'm not so sure. I can say I am not getting the heavy smoke that some of the other reviewers were getting - quite tame actually. Overall, a good beer, but I found the acidic taste to be a little tiresome."
"D: The nice clean finish makes this pretty drinkable for me. At 5.9% this is definitely one of the more sessionable Stone offerings I have had."
"i really think you're going to enjoy this beer...cheers to it...one of the better smoked porters you'll have..."
"Notes: Freshness date 2/18/2010. Had it at the end of the suggested period but that didn't seem to detract from the experience."
"D: This was not the kind of beer you would want or expect to be drinkable. My single bomber was enough."
"Overall: A fine porter that does , but not worthy of all the hype. Other examples of this style are richer, fuller, and more vibrant. That being said, I wouldn't turn down if it was offered, I just wouldn't spend money on it."
"Pours deep brown with a nice light beige head that dissipates to a retentive ring. The aroma is very nice, smoky peat, dark roasted malts, nutshells, and cocoa powder. Medium bodied with average carbonation. This beer has nicely balanced flavors of smoke, dark chocolate, tobacco, and coffee. Just enough bitterness to keep this in balanced, with average attenuation. Finish has a slight milky flavor."
"The taste is definitely chewy, as the Bros. said, with a touch of smoky flavor, but mostly dark malt, probably some crystal malt too. There is a touch of sweeter roasted dark character that emerges in the finish. This is mostly a dry porter, but it does have a bit of complexity in that the roasted and slightly charred and smoked qualities include a touch of sweeter dark malt. This is a full bodied beer and quite nice for a 5.9% ABV beer. You can drink lots of these for sure. The aftertaste is also quite mild, nothing lingering. Overall, a nice dryish porter for a cold night."
"at 5.9, it tastes right on and makes this quite a sessionable brew. two bombers over time with some hearty pub fare would be perfect."
"Great porter that pairs great with BBQ. Enjoy with a brisket sandwich and you wont be disappointed."
"d- a very enjoyable beer and a great representation of the style. i'd recommend it."
"D- Very good beer, the smokiness is exceptional and would be a very good beer to pair up with food! I intend on pairing this and will review when I have done so."
"This stone is a fine beer, and is very easy to enjoy."
"Drinkability - Enjoyable."
"This is a drinkable brew. The hoppiness was unexpected. This would go well with a steak or BBQ."
"Drinkablity: ABVs low, flavors abundant with plenty of subtle nuances, seasonable. What more could you ask for honestly? A great fall or winter beer, I mean hell summer if crave roasted and smokey flavors. Smoked porters are becoming a new trend and have a certain charm that regular porters don't have. This is up there with Captain Lawrence's smoked porter as well. A real proper brew through and through."
"Notes: Not sure this is a great highlight for a brew that tries to have a smoked character. On the other hand its subtlety may be its better asset, if one can notice it and enjoy it fully this might be a great brew. For me I feel they erred on that side."
"Medium mouthfeel, nice and creamy and a bit slick. The subtle smoke plays well with the roastiness of the porter. It's very bold, and very good."
"Definitely a change of pace after my Monk's Cafe... pours an almost opaque black with thick off-white head that fades more rapidly than I was expecting. Nice lacing, however. Normal porter notes on the nose of chocolate, dark malt, and a hint of hops. Definitely getting some smoke in there too. Taste is pretty good, chocolate malt, dark malt, some near coffee flavors, some piney hops (slight), and a bit of smoke. The smoke here is actually more pronounced in the nose than the flavor. Slightly creamy body, though it falls flat at the front of the palate. It could use (I can't believe I'm saying this) a bit more carbonation. Or more body. Pretty easy drinker here, although I feel as though it is due to the moderation in smoke flavors. A good introduction for me to smoked beers, but next time I might just go for a smoke bomb. I guess I can't fault this beer too much because it is definitely a porter, and a good one at that. I need to remember that it is Stone Smoked Porter and not Stone Rauchbier."
"Mouthfeel is substantial but certainly not full. Carbonation seems just fine on the moderate side."
"One bottle would be enough for me for the week, maybe month. I like the taste but just couldn't have it to often. Just not my normal tastes, but a tasty brew none the less."
"D: Drinkability is very good. At 5.9%, I could drink these all night long. The flavor profile is just right not to overwhelm but to still keep me wanting more. Highly recommended for fans of Porters."
"Overall a good drinkable beer. I didn't pair with any food, but it would definitely complement a hearty slab of steak. It's a distinctive smoked porter without being too dominating in any single aspect. A friendly rewarding brew."
"Pours a very dark brown with a nice, creamy head. The aroma is definitely dominated by the smoke, although it's not too overpowering. A bit of chocolate, wood, and miscellaneous roast. The smoke continues to come through in the taste atop the chocolate flavors from the nose, with a wee bit of coffee thrown in as well. Smooth and slightly dry."
"D - Very drinkable beer. I enjoyed with over a steak based on a recommendation of pairing it to really bring out the flavor."
"Overall- Shows that a smoked porter can still be about the porter."
"This brew pours a deep, dark brown - near black but not quite; with an almond colored, creamy head; nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is dominated by chocolate - almost a chocolate pudding or cocoa powder. There's also some light roasted notes. Taste is at first chocolate, followed by roasted malts (more pronounced than aroma) and light coffee; finishes with a touch of smokiness and light hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is smoooth and creamy. Very drinkable - one of my favorite porters."
"Medium/full bodied, filling mouthfeel that is slightly sticky but goes down smooth and nice lingering flavors. Great drinkability one of the better porters Ive had."
"D- like water. burnt, muddy, delicious water"
"Overall-a surprisingly subdued beer from Stone but it's a good one, very flavorful and very drinkable."
"Very creamy body on this beer. Carbonation level was low. Smooth. No smoke in the flavor either. What makes this smoked? This tastes like a regular porter to me. Some light coffee bitterness, mild chocolate flavors, and roasted malts on the finish. Sorry, but this was boring when I expected something a little more original."
"D: Very drinkable porter, I'm almost halfway done a pint while doing this review. Could see this pairing very well with chocolate desserts or even a nice cigar (don't smoke them, but just going on flavor juxtaposition here). Low abv makes a bomber of this an easy match for a craft beer lover."
"D - the smoke builds here, a nicely balanced beer, by the end of the bottle, it was too much for me, but overall i'd drink this one over most other smoked beers"
"Porters are not my favorite style but this was very nice and very drinkable."
"D - Extremely drinkable, perhaps because it is not extraordinary, instead it strives for balance and palatability."
"drinkability: Disapointed. I was expecting more richness and more smoke flavor. I'm not a big smoke beer person but when I drink one I want it to be more presented. Possiblity that I aged it past it's prime. it said best by 09 but I could not read the mont. Unsure... I need to seek out and try agin to be sure of the rating."
"Thin, very nearly watery. A bit prickly. I anticipated something with a more pronounced flavor from Stone. I shan't be buying this again; my eye was towards extreme."
"poured from bomber to chalice pours deep brown with a nice head that diminishes to a wonderful lace, that keeps till the last sip. starts off with a toasty malt then there is some dark fruit like fig and prune then there is a touch of smoke upon the finish this is a great porter but i wish there was more smoke."
"You can say that I was disappointed by this smoked porter. The smoke is not a focal point and the porter backbone is not impressive. I'm glad to have tried it but I don't see myself buying this if it were available in my area."
"Drinkability- Excellent! Stone always does an excellent job. Very good porter"
"D= very drinkable, probably more so with desserts and chocolate etc. than with most meals. Great on its own as a dessert, though."
"D: I am very happy with this beer to honest. Sure I can see it being improved but its a good drink. Goes down easy, isn't overpowering or anything crazy. Simple yet still has some complexity to it. I look forward to each sip to see what is there, and that is what I want in a beer. Stone rarely disappoints me, so this is no suprise. Glad I finally picked this one up and I probably will do so again."
"Good atmosphere. Deep dark formidable appearance. Nose is pretty basic, but the smokiness gives it really unique character. Flavor the same... the smokiness adds a whole new dimension to what would already be a great porter. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"A classic in the smoked porter genre. Pours dark delicious brown. Aroma comes through, a little different, is that the burnt choco malt I smell over any hop character? Taste, hey, there's a massive amount of hops (Chinook?) for a porter. . . for anything really. Mouthfeel holds up, drinkability rated a little lower as I don't think i've ever had more than one in a night. But yet you always want to have one on any given day."
"D - A delicious porter to be sure, not too heavy but with loads of flavor and a great overall effect."
"D: Pretty decent porter. Not as smokey as I expected. I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing. All I know is this is a good beer that I would have no problem buying again."
"Drinkability - 3.5/5.0 - Surely would have again, just wish I could it get in something other than a bomber."
"Medium marks for dirnkability... the smoke flavors are a little on the strong side and it might throw some people off."
"mouthfeel : satin with a small nip at the tip of your tongue. nice."
"Cheers!"
"**Note. Bottle carefully aged for 2 years."
"Medium body, and creamy low carb and a overall smooth experiance. Really drinkable low abv great offering by Stone!"
"was my first porter i've ever reviewed, and first smoked porter ever tasted. i enjoyed it."
"D-Goes down smooth, although, the smokiness stays in the mouth a bit. This bomber is disappearing pretty fast though. As said earlier, alcohol is barely noticeable."
"Overall Stone Smoked Porter is a very good porter. I would say that it is a little light on the smoke flavors, but I like it anyway. Definitely a beer I would buy again."
"Nice clean beer, strongly recommended. Great pairing with Ham and Sauce Poivrade. Would be good with any grilled/smoked dark meats and heavy sauces. If it wasn't so expensive, it would make a very tasty sauce for those roasted dark meats."
"D - I love smoke beers and porters, so the blending of the two is like heaven to me. The taste is well blended and just amazing!! The alcohol content is low enough to allow for a few of these to be had in one night (which I have done). Overall, this is easily one of my favorite beers available from Stone. Great job Stone!!!!"
"Drinkability: This one drinks very nicely thanks to the 5.9 percent ABV and well balanced flavors."
"Recommended."
"F: Pretty bitter on the finish, which also adds some dark fruits, and slight stouty bitter flavors. A little more lingering smoke but not much, and followed with some light alcohol spice."
"D- This is a great porter. I wonder how many casual beer drinkers have been scred off by the ""smoked"" oart of the label. Having lived in SD, I think I took this beer for granted. I was so happy to see this for growler fills here in NYC. Good to pair with food too!"
"D: This brew was delicious, but let me down on a couple of key points: there was little bouquet, no smoke, and way too much carbonation. A good beer, but not one of Stone's best works."
"Poured into a tumbler it produces a 5 mm head that leaves lots of lacing. The appearance is very dark with clear amber around the edges. The smell is of citrus hops and a hint of burning mesquite. The taste is somewhat complex with strong hops, coffee, roasted malt, and burning mesquite. The feel is full bodied but not overly heavy with a nice sweet finish. This is a very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: I would have this again and recommend this to someone who enjoys a smoky porter that have a rich coffee bitter/ sour in the middle to end."
"Overall a very good Smoked Porter, just what you come to expect from Stone"
"The body really shines in this beer. It looks deceivingly thin, however it turned out to be quite thick, bready and mouth-coating. This beer is definitely a great representation of a porter, and it is one that can be sipped on all afternoon."
"I was surprised to find this beer to be as low in abv as it is. Stone Brewery, which typically makes bigger beers, has really scored with this sessionable beer which will be a great drinker all winter. Excellent color, great roasty aroma, very pleasing flavor and an overall good beer for sipping or gulping."
"A great beer, sessionable and hearty."
"Mouthfeel is solid nothing great, and this is just a bland beer that is not very drinkable."
"Great drinkability, and another tasty Stone stand-by."
"Drinkability: The intense smokiness may take away a bit from the drinkability but it is still a great porter, and smoke is nice in small doses, and anyway, it is a smoked porter."
"Serving type: bottle"
"If you look up smoked porter in the dictionary this brew would be the picture next to it. It is OK and has the standard characteristics for the style but does not stand out."
"D: I really like this beer, It is extremely drinkable for a porter"
"This brew didn't do anything to overwhelm me and make me want to revisit it. Light feel and odd flavor hinders the drinkability somewhat. I mean, won't turn down another free go at it, but I can definitely find better beers to imbibe before I try this one again."
"The mouthfeel is the one thing that I think is the one unfavorable quality to this porter. It's like drinking flat soda - no palpable carbonation whatsoever. I was hoping to have some sort of carbonated feel to the porter, so I was a bit disappointed. Incredibly light-bodied and thin. Drinkability is still moderate and good as there is no sacrifice in taste."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable en masse, versatile"
"D - A nice session porter with some good flavor. Overall pretty light but not at the expense of taste."
"(This makes a fantastic base for a dark chocolate & black pepper marinade.)"
"Drinkability: well done, one of my favorites."
"D: A really nice sipper to have around the campfire. Very big porter flavor, so it's a must try for the porter fan or smoked ale enthusiast. At just about 6%, you could make this into a session porter, provided you were just sitting by a fire, or enjoying it with BBQ or dark desserts."
"D- I'll be buying some more of these for the winter, for sure. A winner in my book."
"Pours dark black color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, hops, and slight alcohol. Fits the style of an American Porter. Mouth feel is smooth and thick with an average carbonation level. Tastes roasted malt, slight sweet malt, slight alcohol, hops, and some slight smoke. Overall, a great appearance, good blend, body, and complexity."
"Drinkable of course, the body is relatively light compared to Imperial Porters, which this is not."
"Pours a beautiful dark auburn. nice creamy head with light lacing. smell of sweet with notes of bitter chocolate. first taste is suprising. slightly sweet. not overly ""dark beer"" tasting. very clean finish. medium bodied that lingers on the palate just long enough pick up the docile flavors that this brew offers. chocolate, coffee, slight dark fruit and some dark malts really come together well in the beer."
"salud!"
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - I really enjoyed this beer, from the fresh from the tap appearance, to the way the creamy mouthfeel complimented the rich smokey flavors. I could enjoy 2, maybe 3 before it became a little to rich, but otherwise extremely drinkable on a cold night. I highly recommend it. Cheers!i"
"D: All in all a great porter. Goes good with meats. I will definitely enjoy this one again."
"Pours a nearly opaque dark brown with one finger cream colored head, fades to a quarter inch with a ring of lacing for the first inch or so. Smell: roasted malt with a decent dose of smoke and a whiff of grassy and citric hops, caramel sweetness. Taste: lots of roastiness without going too far into burnt territory, coffee, powdery milk chocolate, grassy and citric hops. Finishes dry and semi-sweet with chocolate, burnt, and smokey flavors. Nice, could definitely wash down a plate of ribs or a piece of cheesecake... can't say it had the smokey flavor expected when I grabbed the smoked gouda from the fridge."
"This beer pours a nearly opaque black color. The head is a half inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of roasted malt, smoke, and hints of chocolate. The taste is like the aroma, but with a little more chocolate, and a little less smoke. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with appropriately low carbonation, and a silky texture. Overall, this beer isn't as smokey has other smoked porters I've tasted. Still, it is really good for what it is. I can't I wouldn't appreciate some more smoke, but I still appreciate this slightly smokey porter."
"Overall, especially for the price, this is a fantastic porter."
"overall this is a pretty good beer. the lingering effect of the smoke flavor though makes this beer a slow sipper for me. i like smoke flavor, but one of these is enough for me."
"Overall a good porter and quite complex and full, just not a personal favorite."
"The mouthfeel is mediocre, not as creamy as I would have liked but with a nice carbonation that makes the beer quite drinkable. All in all an enjoyable brew."
"D- What am I missing here? Is this an old bottle? I am not a fan of hoppy beers and that all this basically tastes like to me, nothing at all like a porter and no smoked flavor either. Very disappointing."
"The feel is feel of this beer is quite mellow with a nice medium body. Is pretty easy drinking an is one of the easier Stone beers to try for first timers new to Stone brews."
"This beer is very interesting, to say the least. It pours a beautiful deep dark brown with a magnificent head. After a few minutes the head retention died off, leaving a fine lacing. The smell is of robust roasty malts and feint chocolate; somewhat stout-like I'd say. The first sip was shocking, the smoked peet dominates. After a few more sips the peet mellowed and the beer became more drinkable. A much hyped and yet enjoyable porter, unique and extravagant."
"Smooth and creamy medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, a nice twist on the American Porter, with a nice balance between the roasty and sweet notes of the porter and a touch of smoke."
"D- A very drinkable porter, I could have had another."
"I like that this is a smoked beer that uses the smoke as a subtle addition to the final flavor, rather than the number one characteristic."
"thanks again to Stone Brewery."
"Pours a dark brown color with a 3 finger tan head with good retention. Smells of chocolate and coffee malt, mild smoke, and some bitter hops. The hops take a back seat to the malt as it always should be with a porter or stout. The sweetness and bitterness of this beer balance each other out beautifully. This is a rich and full bodied porter which is nicely carbonated and easy to drink. I would gladly pick up this beer again. I just wish the smoke was a little stonger."
"Dark brown colored beer with a slowly fading head.Aroma is smoky malts.Taste is smoked malts,coffee and some chocolate.A pretty decent beer with some decent flavor.A good beer that I most likely would try again although I would not actively seek out.I think you should try this at least once."
"This beer pours a very dark brown color with a medium off white head that falls quickly and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma has some chocolate, coffee, and a touch of smoke with a light hint of citrus hops in the back. The flavor is much like the aroma. Chocolate and roast flavors upfront with a hint of smoke and a lingering hop bitterness. Nicely done. The body is medium and the drinkability is good."
"Poured a very nice deep brown/black color with some very nice head and good lacing. Excellent scent, deep and dark with nice coffee undertones and a great smoked aroma. Excellent flavor as well, with the smokiness really coming through but not overpowering the deep malt and coffee porter flavors. Went down very well, and although I don't know if I could have many of these at one setting because of the intense flavors, it was a wonderful brew."
"D: I'm generally not that big of a fan of smoked beers, but this one is light enough on the smoke, and it seems to add a bit of sweetness."
"D - Moderate to high. The relatively low ABV and malty backbone keep you coming back for more."
"Smooth mouthfeel but lacking in body just a little. Overall this was good to try but the ""smoked"" part wasn't pulled off quite as well as I was hoping. My feelings are a little mixed on this one. As far as porters go, this is really good, but if I was picking out of Stone's lineup, this would not be one of my first choices. Rating to style, I really can't complain so I'm sure I would pick this up again if I was in the mood for it."
"For me one of the few porters I have truly enjoyed"
"Drinkability: Another amazing winner from Stone. I didn't expect to like this one as much as I do."
"D - A very nice sipper but lacks the flavor that I really wanted. Alcohol and bitterness not a detractor from drinkability by any means. Quite sessionable really."
"good taste and low enough ABV to enjoy a few. i pick up a bomber every few months, but i prefer my porters to have a bit more character other than just 'smoky'. it's definitely a good porter, but not the best."
"Definitely a good beer, but falls a little short in some areas for me. I was expecting a more ""smoked"" flavor, but really wasn't getting it. Mostly chocolate malts and some roasted qualities on the finish. Tasted like a pretty standard porter. Smell was practically nonexistent. Not much beyond that, but I would still get it again for $3.99 a bomber."
"D: Great price and decent ABV on these will make this one a winter favorite of mine. Heck, I might make it an end of summer/autumn favorite too! :)"
"I poured into a pint glass to a half inch of tan head. It is dark brown in color. It smells like a good porter with a hint of smoke. I taste the roasted malts with some coffee maybe a little bitter chocolate. It finishes with the smokey flavor. It is a good beer, but I was expecting more after my experiences with Alaskan Smoked Porter and rauchbiers. I would definitely drink it again. I guess my expectations were off."
"Bottle that was a few month's past it's enjoy by date. It poured black with a tan head that was gone within 2 minutes. It smelled like someone lit a campfire in the distance. I could really taste the smokiness."
"Pours a super dark brown, almost pitch black. The head is super velvety and big. Smell is a hint of charcoal, and molasses. Taste is malty rich up front, a coffee tasting middle, and a nice earthy bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, medium carbonation levels. Drinkability is superb, the smokiness is just right, and with lower alcohol levels makes this a great beer if you are wanting the entire 22oz bottle at once."
"Opaque murky brown. Tan head that leaves some lacing and a ring. Some smoked and roasted malts on the nose with just a hint of chocolate. The flavor exhibits more smoked malts with some coffee and chocolate accents. Very approachable and easy to drink. This is one I could drink all night, even with the smokey character."
"D- A nice brew that is full of flavor and very drinkable."
"Pours pitch black from the bomber with two fingers of brown head. This is a better looking porter than most. Smell is an enticing blend of dark chocolate, coffee, and a light roasty/smokey note that is increased in the taste. Also in the taste is a bitter coffee note at the finish that makes things interesting. Mouthfeel is on the full-bodied side, with the dry, bitter finish that's just a little strong for my taste. A nice, affordable porter, and I expect to visit it again in the future."
"Overall, a good porter, but somewhat unbalanced due to the overly heavy smoke flavor."
"light to medium body, smooth at first, then some astringency plus phenols come in for slight sharpness. moderate carbonation seems to accentuate this at times, but remains overall sort of neutral."
"As I stated before, Stone beers are not as good as when I first tried them. Arrogant Bastard, Russian Imperial Stout, IPA, Ruination, and now Smoked Porter just seem a little lacking as of late. Thats pretty sad considering they are the reason I got into craft beer in the first place. Worth a shot, but is not on par with many other craft brewers out there."
"I see there are quite a few good reviews for this beer. Sorry to say I have to disagree. the appearance and smell of this beer is great. the taste is what left me disappointed. the coffee and hops hit your taste buds with a blast of joy, then it's all downhill. I'm not getting any sweet tones. The smoke comes through, then disaster. You're left with the taste of charcoal. Like you just licked the bottom of a grill. The mouthfeel of this one was also not to my liking. very light and carbonated. not what i expect from a porter. This is my first ""smoked"" beer and maybe it's supposed to be this way. but i will try it again if i ever find it on tap somewhere."
"D: deffinatly could drink another."
"Solid beer overall - would certainly get again"
"Pours a dark brown color with a nice off white head. The smell is of malts, chocolate and coffee with some earthy hops, there is also a smokey smell present. The taste is of smokey notes with chocolate and coffee malts present in the middle, at the back end is a little hop bitterness to balance out the flavor. The mouthfeel is solid a lil carbonation and creamy. The drinkability is good, very easy driniking and very complex and flavorful."
"smells of coco and coffee, rich and smokey. tastes bitter sweet of chocolate and coffee. very smokey taste. medium body with light carb, creamy. a bit to smokey for my taste, wish it was a bit smoother"
"D-I can think of few other beers that are perfect for bbq. I had this with the bistro's duck tacos. The perfect beer for those who think they don't like smoked beers."
"One additional note: reading the back of the bottle gives insight into some food pairings that go well with this brew - including PB&J sandwiches. I had to try it, and I must say that it was a very good match! If you like beer and food, check this one out! Very cool."
"Stone don't really disappoint, do they?"
"Quite possibly the best porter on the planet, definitely the best in San Diego. I had this on tap at my favorite local pub. It poured a deep, deep brown with a fizzy head that left a lot of lacings. Smelled of roasty,sweet malt with hints of coffee and chocolate. Tasted great, with a wonderfully smoky character with hints of hops. Nice creamy mouthfeel and easy to drink. Great with BBQ food."
"A dark brown to black pour with a huge bubbly brown head , loads of sticky lacing left on the glass , light carbonation . Aroma of roasted malt , coco powder and hints of smoke and coffee . Flavor is very good , a nice roast to the malt , some coffee and light hop bitterness, light chocolate sweetness , and just a hint of smoke at the end . Full body with a creamy mouthfeel . a nice malty smoky finish . very drinkable and quite sessionable . NIce job Stone ."
"D- A very nice porter. Great for sipping or pairing with some food."
"D - I'm sure if I liked the beer and it's style, it'd be a much easier beer to drink."
"Overall, this is one great porter that I would highly recommend to any lover of the style. I would say that as of right now it is one of my top three favorite porters, right up there with Foothills People's Porter, but just behind my personal favorite, Founder's Porter."
"Drinks very smoothly, the smoked quality is not as noticeable but it is light bodied enough to be near sessionable."
"Verdict: Without the smoke component this would still be a solid Porter, but with it in the mix this is a most satisfying brew. If you've never tried a smoked beer, this is a good place to start."
"D: Very easy to drink but I'd only want one per session. However, with the low ABV you could easily have more than one. I love this beer."
"Mouth is pretty wet, medium bodied. Pretty solid porter"
"It is a mouth full, so I wasn't craving a second pint - but I could use one right now."
"A ridiculous amount of carbonation translated into a ridiculous amount of foam (hard to call 4 3/4"" of foam poured gently into a 5"" high glass, head). I could feel very little carbonation from the glass, all wasted in foamy head, and had to drink straight from the bottle to get a feel for how much carbonation was present. It tasted better after the carbonation loss, not a great flavor, earthy. I could not find any chocolate, anywhere. I generally like Stone products, but this is a very pedestrian effort. To be honest, I can't believe this is the same beer that the majority of other reviewers rated! Maybe I just got a hold of a bad bottle, but usually that is indicated by too little carb, not too much. Not horrible, but definately disappointing."
"D - It took me a while to finally try this beer, but wow! This is a great beer all around. This could very well be the benchmark smoked beer for all others to live up to."
"D: Good enough for a second round."
"D: This is a 1, 2, 3, beer, a beginning middle and end. It gives and gives without demanding too much attention. An easy drinking and a good opening for someone interested in trying out a smoked beer for the first time."
"M/D: Very smooth and very very big. I may have to acquire a taste for this style, but I'm sure that won't take long."
"Overall I think it would be a little bit better with a slightly smokier taste, but that's just me. Other that, it's a very robust brew that should be treated like a fine wine. Save for occasions that call for it. Yet another exceptional brew from Stone."
"D- A very good intro for anyone getting into smoked beers, or porters for that matter. Drinkable, and worth a second look...or a third...or a fourth..."
"Drinkability: This, although only 5.9% ABV, drinks really slow for me and it always has. A bomber is just heavy and filling and mroe than enough for a barbecue dinner, almost too filling. Tasty and fun, it's a great beer that won't sneak up on you and really is a nice example of a Porter."
"I wouldn't session this beer it is to special to cheapen I think it needs to be a special occasions beer. EXCELLENT BREW!!!"
"Drinkability: Very flavorful porter that insists you keep drinking, although the flavor overload may eventually wear thin. One of the best porters I have had."
"D - I really enjoyed this beer. I was sort of expecting an overly smoky beer, but I really think they got smokiness at a good level here. Great balance and combination of flavors and a smooth, highly drinkable beer. I could definitely enjoy a few of these without getting tired of it."
"D: I really liked this beer. The flavors balance well and it definitely went down easy. Overall, this is a very fine beer."
"I will admit, I was concerned about the ""smoked"" aspect, but still wanted to try it. I am glad I did, but would likely spend my money on Arrogant Bastard again before this one."
"A great porter, very roasty with a nice smoke backbone. The smokiness luckily is not too overwealming, balances nicely with the roasted characteristics. A fantastic, rich and bold porter."
"D- Thin, very hoppy not my style. When I pour a porter I sorta expect something more robust, thick, and darker. /shrug"
"Great drinkability. Low ABV. and great taste and mouthfeel make this a very enjoyable session beer. Cheers."
"Very smooth and enjoyable, however this is not a beer that I would drink as a sessional. The smokiness can tend to become overbearing in large quantities. But none the less, it is a very nice beer."
"D- i could drink a lot of this one"
"Weird smell aside, this is a thick, drinkable brew that goes well with hearty foods. I've had it with spicy BBQ and also with grilled steak and it's a great compliment for those types of vittles."
"D - Great beer. Slightly sweet with not too much bite and good depth. Excellence balance and overall characteristics."
"Drinkability: A well-balanced very drinkable stout. Not the best I've had, but certainly one that I always enjoy drinking."
"Drinkability: This was good enough to make me want to finish the bomber, but not to have a second one...It does have a decent smoky taste and is a lot hoppier than most smoke beers I have had."
"Pours dark brown in color with some tan frothy head. Smell is heavily roasted malts and just a hint of smoke. This has to be one of the more approachable smoked porters there are out there. Taste is more of the roasted malts, some cocoa and what comes across as roasted coffee. There's a good amount of smoke flavor in this as well. Very balanced and good. If you're looking for liquid campfire then this one isn't for you. But if you're looking for a very approachable smoked beer, this is it."
"D - Excellent, though not substantively different from the bottle. One goes down easily, but you only want one. Pleasurable, but I was ready to move on after my pint."
"Drinkability: With the low abv, thin body, and controlled smokiness I'd say it's quite drinkable."
"This was a gift from my brother to replace one my friend from college drank by himself despite my paying for half of it and all the vermouth for that night. Wow what a head of tan... on a football colored beer. Smell was like chocolate coffee. Tastes was chocolatety and perhaps a hint of cherry. Was quite a thick beer too. Went down easy, could have easily drank the bottle myself. Never been disappointed by stones before and this beer wasn't the exception."
"Overall good."
"D: Now that I think about it, I would not care for a beer to be absurdly smoked. I think this by far one of the best smoked porters I have had, I have not tried many though. I like what else is going on...a darn good robust malty porter"
"What a contradictorily mellow, rich and decadent beer! Peppered beef jerky, cocoa and caramel sweetness with a more-than-adequate hop load. This is actually a pretty surprising beer from Stone, there appears to be a leash on this gargoyle as all the flavors are pretty subtle for the most part. I would like a bit more smoke and maybe a bit more body, but those are definitely minor complaints. This beer is terrific, I love it."
"Pours a rich dark brown, almost black. Very porterlike in appearance. Nice little carbonation bubbles surface. Smell isn't very porterlike. All i get from it is a sort of yeasty, black-malt sweetness. Kind of coffeelike in essence. Not a lot of smell to it. Taste is very good, however. Deep in excellent porterness, dark sweet malt balanced very nicely by a healthy dose of hops at the end. The sweet-pushed hops are what slightly linger on the palate. I'm not getting a great deal of smokiness, but there seems to be a bit. It's basically a slightly smoked porter, a very nice touch. The smoke lingers a bit on the palate too, now that I taste it. Light-heavy in body, sufficiently coating and lingering. Drinkability is pleasant if not amazing. This is an excellent beer, and I will continue to treasure it."
"Beer poured black with ruby highlights. Head is tan with good height and retention. Nose is hints of coffee and west coast hops. Taste is wonderful, roasted malts with hints of coffee and chocolate balanced very nicely by a good dose of west coast hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth going across the palate. Overall drinkability is exceptional. It has been awhile since i have had this. I had forgotten how good this brew is! This is a very easy drinking beer that has few peers in this category!!"
"Loved this beer, great stuff!!"
"D - Very easy drinking, which to me means I could drink several of these during a night. I enjoyed my last bottle while enjoying some baby back ribs, which I highly recommend."
"Drinkability- An excellent drinker. Rich, but versatile. Would be great with some grilled steak or burgers."
"Very drinkable for a six percent porter. The Stone porter also paired nicely with some sharp cheddar, though I guess it should have been smoked cheddar for this particular beer. Does Stone actually use smoked malts? To their website..."
"Very drinkable; the aforementioned smoke is very unobtrusive. Actually without the smokiness this would be a little bland, the roasted malt is very monotone- no harmonics."
"D: Very good. it holds steady the whole way down. I would almost compare is to a watered down RIS"
"Notes: The first of 5 Stone beers that I will taste and rate. This is an interesting and complex porter and I love that smoky character of it."
"Rich, smooth and creamy with high drinkability. A great Porter."
"D: a good sipping beer definatly not a chugger"
"Poured into a snifter. It's solid black (as far as I can tell) with a thin tan head. Leaves some lacing. Smells mainly of chocolate and roasted nuts. Creamy mouthfeel, coffee-like bitterness up front. Finishes with a thick, dark malty flavor with a lot of chocolate. As it warms you can smell some overripe plums (I guess? it's some kind of sweet fruit). It does kind of remind me of black licorice (I doubt I would have gotten that if I hadn't read the back of the bottle but whatever). I should have let the bomber sit out of the fridge for 20 minutes or so to warm up, since as I drink it its getting way better. I think I might get this again, especially since I think I paid less than 3 dollars for it. Nice and filling. I think a nap is in order."
"Decent carbonation here, its actually very easy to drink due to the creaminess, but on the other hand, there is no way I would drink more than a pint glass without getting my palate dulled due to the roasty/smokiness."
"Lovely all around, highly recommended. Stone needs to come to Illinois post haste."
"D - Drinkable for a porter."
"overall, another masterfully crafted brew from the folks at Stone. Also managed to get it sort of for free (my friend, to pay back the money he owed me took me to liquorama and told me he'd cover whatever I could carry in my arms, no baskets allowed. I was proud of how much I could carry. three six packs, a pack of four cans, four 22s and a couple of singles later...). All around a pleasant drinking experience. recommend highly"
"D- very drinkable, this may become my new fav. porter, at only %5.9 i could prob. drink this all night long"
"Poured a very deep brown with a small dirty tan head, very little carbonation. Nose smelled of a little smoke and roasted malt, coffee but let down on the nose much like the taste. Tasted like it smelled. I almost detected smoke smoked meat or something in there. The bottle did not do this brew justice."
"D: Quite!"
"D - Lower alchohol% (5.7) makes it repeatable, but since it has a quite strong smokey aftertaste, I will want to finish it up w/ something hoppy. Would pair well w/ fruit."
"Pours an opaque black with basically no head, just some foam resting at the top that doesn't span the surface. Smells of dark malts and balances out with some piny hop aroma. Tastes just like it smells-deep malt balanced with piny hops. The mouthfeel is good, just the right amount of body to match the deep smell and taste. Much more drinkable than an IRS because of the SP's lighter body."
"Overall - A great, well balanced porter. Easy drinking and very socially inclined. Crack a few open and enjoy a round with friends!"
"D-I would enjoy this more if I could get past the smoke. But still, for a big beer it is surprisingly drinkable, but one bomber is enough."
"Poured a cola brown from the bomber, nice thick head, retained foam throughout the drinking experience. Nose of roasted malts, light coffee. Taste medium bodied and flavours of roasted malts and some sort of smokiness...I detected a sweetness mixed in the malts and smoke...Nice Porter from our friends from Stone. Highly recommend if you are a porter/stout lover!!! Enjoy!"
"Out of a bomber bottle this beer was a very dark brown/black color with a two finger head of tan foam. The retention was quite good and the lacing pretty good too. The aroma was not nearly as 'dark' as I was expecting, roasted malt, earthiness, peat smoke, rye bread and wood. The flavors were rich and robust, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, peat smoke, sweet pipe tobacco, earthy malt and a good balancing hop bitterness. The long bitter finish was pleasant and well organized as one experiences with high-quality chocolate. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body full and the carbonation perfect. An excellent example of the style and another worthy offering from Stone."
"Drinkability: Sip & Savor. As a porter lover I'd highly recommend this as a porter for that porter drinker looking for something to enjoy that's different. Stone takes this one and runs with it."
"Medium body, moderate carbonation. Seems somewhat subdued compared to other Stone Brews. Overall, the flavors are a bit soft, and not at all what I was expecting. Certainly not a bad beer, but I find this to be only slightly above average for a porter."
"Very nice!!!"
"Pours a deep deep dark brown, clear, but little light gets through. Tan head that is fluffy and reduces to a ring with islands. Smell of toasted malts and a bit of smoke, but not smokey like a rauchbier. Taste is smoke and malts with a long lingering aftertaste not unlike an Islay Scotch. Carbonation is right and mouthfeel is smooth. This is a great brew but a sipper not a chugger!"
"Poured out of a bomber bottle into a pint glass. Deep, dark, almost opaque in color with a tan head. Only a hint of burnt smoke in the nose with some notes of coffee. The taste was great - just a little bit of smokey background, with a coffee or dark fruit flavor. The best part of this wonderful brew is the fact that it finishes so clean. Almost no residual bitterness (you would never know it was 50+ IBU)."
"Midnight black with thin caramel head. Leaves very little lace in glass. Smell has a slight hint of smokiness, but not overwhelming. Some chocolate in the nose too with some fruitiness. taste is all malt with very little hop bite that doesn't come into to play until the finish. Smokiness is there. Subtle and tasty, charcoal note bounce around. Mouthfeel has a nice creaminess and is quite full. This is quite nice and will definately be picking this up again."
"This is a great smoked porter, one of the best examples of the style."
"Overall a great interpretation of the style, and I would rate this slightly above Guinness Extra Stout."
"From a 22 oz bottle purchased locally poured into a 0.5 L glass. Aroma is roasty chocolate with some peat coming through. Deep dark brown with ruby barely peeking through, almost black with a big rocky tan head. Dry, roasty dark chocolate flavor with the smoke in the background, not overpowering. Evenly balanced with hop bitterness making it smooth and easy drinking."
"D: Nicely balanced flavor and texture combined with an almost session-like ABV give it a high drinkability. However, the richness of flavor and thickness makes it almost meal-like, so I'm not sure you'd want too many of them. Very good overall."
"Poured from 22oz bottle received in trade from kiefdog(thanks kevin!) Poured into pint glass. Pours deep brown almost black with a finger of tan head with good retention and great lacing on the glass. Smell is like roasted malts with no hint of the smokiness I was expecting. Taste is smoky as soon as it hits your tongue but mellows out to a smooth maltiness. Light-medium mouthfeel. Very drinkable. The best porter I've ever had. My favorite beer from Stone yet."
"D- It's a decent drinker. As the smoked flavors become more robust with some warmth, it gets a little more difficult imagining drinking more than a bomber at a time."
"Pours black with reddish colors on the edges with a brown head. Good lacing down the glass. Chocolate, roasted malt scents. Roasted malt chocolate coffee flavors with a faint smoke flavor. I was dissapointed that there wasn't more of a smoke flavor to this beer. There was slight bitterness in the finish with apparent hop flavor. I had this with some texas sliced brisket and the taste immediately changed. The beer became way too hoppy. Apparently the extreme smokiness of the BBQ neutralized any roasted smoke flavor in the beer and made the hops pop out. Very strange."
"All in all a decent craft brew, worth a taste. Not disappointing."
"The drinkability is very high, especially for the smokiness...this is a great beer to get one started on the whole smoked beer train, nice and subtle."
"D - A smooth, easy drinking beer."
"D: While it is drinkable, I couldn't imagine having more than a pint or two of this without feeling full. It's rich and heavy, but it's also fairly smooth and definitely yummy. Try it out if you like burnt/smokey flavors or caramelized malts."
"D - Very good for the type, never felt too heavy."
"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle, This beer is very dark brown in color with a creamy white head that settles to a nice film on the surface. The nose is slightly smoky, with hints of chocolate and coffee. Taste is mildly smoky, with roasty coffee notes. Bittersweet chocolate and a light hop character finish each sip. The beer is medium to full-bodied, and the finish is very clean. Good by itself or with BBQ, this is one porter that everyone should try at least once, if not more."
"Drinkability- Good beer with the right amount of smoky flavor that isn't overwhelming."
"Overall - A pretty good porter although not as full bodied as I was expecting - I would have preferred a bit more of a smoke flavor as well. In fact this was more like a chocolate stout than a smoked one. Still, a very good beer, and a safe purchase."
"Pours a black-brownish colored body, with a tannish colored head, average & lasting, with decent lasting. Has a very smoky aroma, with mesquite. Woody. Porterish. Ashtrayish. Watery, smoky, coffee taste. Mesquity. Good and tasty."
"Drinkability: For all the hype about this beer at least I've been hearing, I'm not unimpressed, just not very impressed. There seem to be many comparable porters across the board, and many better ones. I'm not sure if I can't tell the smoke from anything else, but I was hoping for some predominance, which was something I didn't get. A decent one out of a snifter, but nothing I'll be seeking out again."
"Smell - malts mostly with hints of coffe and chocolate. Taste - a lot better than smell - smoked flavour hits at first, then some chocolate and coffe perhaps. Smokey flavor makes it different, delicious and easy to drink. Very rich, creamy beer, well balanced. Great beer, I love it, I haven't had a good porter for a while."
"Drinkability - this is a fantastic beer, I just wanted to drink it. And when I was done I wanted to go to the store an buy another one."
"Poured into a pint glass from a 22oz bottle. Poured a dark brown, dark ruby color with about a one finger head. The aroma is very sweet with smells of caramel, chocolate, and smoke. Overall a very nice, very sweet aroma. The taste is quite great, coffee, chocolate, smokey yet kind of sweet. Very drinkable, I would pick up another one right after I was finished. This is a great porter and another great offering from Stone."
"Taste features the same woody and smokey notes, along with chocolate and coffee malts. Slight hop presence, and a very nice and creamy body."
"The beer just didn't impress me. Stone always seems to be pushing the boundaries of taste and overall beer experience, but this thing seems pretty tame. It looked fine, dark with a small tan head. The smell was sweeter than I expected and I even had trouble finding any smoke in the nose. The same goes for the taste. Biscuity malts, no smoke, no carbonation, no balance. Not a special mouthfeel. Drinkable enough. If you like it."
"D- A downright solid brew. This has the most Rauchbier characteristics that I've seen yet in the porter category. Definitely check this one out as it's very delicious and drinkable."
"Pours a transparent deep brown color with a small off white head that sticks around most of the glass. Huge chocolate malt nose, coffee bean and subtle hints of vanilla. Much is the same in flavor mellow, rich and decadent, mild bitterness and subtle notes of rootbeer, cherry and fruit. By the way, this bottle has been hidden in my stash since at least this time last year. Heavier than medium in body, mild carbonation and good drinkability. Pay no attention to the best by date."
"Overall, an extremely awesome brew, and one I'd highly recommend!"
"Pours a nice brown color with a small head and light lacing. Nice chocolatey smell, but not a whole lot of smoke going on. Not bad smelling. Flavor has a little more smoke, but nothing outrageous. More chocolate, lightly roasted malts, maybe just a touch of coffee. This beer is good, but I think I was hoping for a lot more."
"D- Easy to drink, very satisfying. Another good offering from Stone."
"Overall it's very good, but I wasn't blown away."
" Get Some!!"
"Very easy to drink as it goes down so smoothly. I polished off my 22oz bottle and was wanting more."
"Thanks John B. for the bottle. Much appreciated."
"D: Could't drink many, but well worth frinking."
"D- If you're in the mood for a porter this is a solid choice as any beer by Stone is. Definitely not the best porter, but certainly not the worst. I couldn't drink it everyday, but then again I don't think I could ever drink porters everyday, only on freezing cold nights when I want to chill and watch a Celtics game."
"A very smooth but very complex beer. Enjoyable and pleasant, with lots to explore."
"This is a pleasant beer that's easy to drink."
"D: I could drink a bunch of these, and with the price tag there's no reason not to. I'd choose this over a Yuengling Porter any day of the week. Smooth, refreshing, light, yet heavy enough for those who rebel against fizzy yellow beers with multi-million dollar ad campaigns (Please refer to the label on a bottle of Arrogant Bastard)"
"D. Id drink more then a few of these, not over powering but definitely a beer that you'd remember."
"Nose was smokey. Taste was of smokey, roasted grains. Mouthfeel strong but smoothe. Overall, a well crafted porter but not really a beer for me. I think I'll stick to the regular porters."
"Poured deep dark brown with a tan head. Smelled mildly smokey with hint of vanilla. Taste was very similar to the smell with a minimal smokey flavor. Taste some hoppy bitterness on the finish. Low carbonated as one would expect. Nice beer but I would move on to other offerings if there were some other choices."
"this brew pours up jet black with a nice biggy, frothy tan head. nice lacing. the nose is a symphony of chocolate, roasted malts, not an overwhelming amount of smoke but a good amount, a touch of alcohol. I taste big malts, nice smokey flavor, decent hop bittering. Medium to full bodied, low to med carbo. A mighty fair brew."
"Medium bodied. The carbonation isn't all the prickly, but it ""elevates"" the rich beer so that it doesn't drink too heavily."
"D - Great. I wish the flavor was a little more robust up front. But it's still quite good and I think this is highly drinkable. It's not very strong % wise, and it's very easy to swallow and you crave more."
"Picked up a 22oz of this one for the big game to enjoy with a meal of bratwurst and sauerkraut. Poured very dark, close to black with a lightly tanned head. The unique smoke flavor doesn't seem to apparent immediately, but it is there if you hold for a moment. It's also in the after-taste. The smoke is strong but not overpowering, however, this is the only aspect I found original about this porter. Normal texture, tastes of coffee and fairly smooth. Otherwise seemed like a fairly standard, albeit, well made porter. This won't be a preference, I think."
"all in all a good beer, not great, but damn good."
"Held up to the light poured a deep amber color with off white lacing. An awesome smokey smell with a very dark malt ending. Taste is very creamy not smokey like the smell. Not much carbonation at all which makes it go down smoothly. A very good brew would definetly buy it again."
"Starting of the super bowl right with this one. Smells like freshly smoked herring, the smokey part not fishy, some hops and roasted malt. Pours to an opaque balck with a creamy head that's foamy with big bubbles on top. Upfront the taste hits you with everything: roasted malt, hops and smoke. Then one by one they peel off, first the roasted malt peels off leaving a smokey bitterness, then the smoke fades abit and leaves mostly bitterness with a hint of sweetness. Mouthfeel however seems a little thin for this complex brew. Not as chewy as one would expect for a porter. However that is not a factor that affects the flavor, nor the drinkability. In my opinion it actually improves the drinkability. Great selection by Stone."
"once again, shared this one with the donkeyrunner, thanks dude."
"Tastes like it smells. A great balance between dark roast malt and sweet nutty malt. The smokiness is less pronounced in the taste than the aroma. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel."
"D: This is a top-notch American Porter. Manages a very aggressive roasted malt character while remaining balanced, something I wasn't quite expecting from Stone. I wouldn't call it my favorite, but that doesn't mean it isn't really good. I wish I could find this in something other than a $5 bomber."
"Thought it was a tad pricey for 22oz $4.99 versus Anchor porter six pack 72 oz for $7.99, plus the anchor is more in my preference. Still its recommended."
"I drank this at the end of a snowstorm that dumped 12 inches on my backyard. This was a nice escape from the weather."
"mmm porters! There's a reason to old ""Porter Belly"" phenomenon. I snagged this 22oz bottle from Trader Joe's and supped with it (pork chops). The pour hinted at something exciting, as it showed near black with reddish edges & a small burnt beige head that quickly left, with off-white minimal lace. The aroma held an unexpected hop quality & minmal malts & smoke. The flavor likewise pushed hop bitterness at the sacrifice of smoked malts & chocolate-coffee elements that just reared their taste. By no means a bad pint, just a bit too hoppy for my porter wants."
"The color in this beer was unexpected. Pitch black, with only the smallest appearance of dark browns around the very edges of the beer's body. Not even a finger of light tan head dissipates quickly, though a ring retains well. Smells of highly pungent smoked malts including dark chocolate and, more deeply, some fruits. The first few sips were heavily influenced by smoked malts with burnt chocolate and caramel; each of these initial sips ended with a hoppy bite, convincing me this beer was well balanced. However, after about the third sip, the hops completely overtook the palate. Though the ashy aroma stuck around, I could not pull the smoked flavor out of the hops for the remainder of this bomber. Light to medium-bodied, medium carbonation and oils coating the palate completely, mostly with bitter residue. Overall, this beer was hoppy but not unpleasant (just more than I expected from an American Porter). The smoky factor made me think of fireplaces, and I certainly experienced that warm, fuzzy feeling. I would recommend sharing a 22oz of this with a friend, especially if you're having it with dessert!"
"As for drinkability, I'll just say I won't have any issues finishing the bomber. A very good beer."
"Notes: You get exactly what the label says on this one, smokey and meaty beer. Stone sets the standard for styles and this one is another victory."
"D - Great brew! Another powerful beer in the Stone Family"
"drinkablitly--i literally could drink this beer all night because of the consistency and abv but not by choice"
"J"
"Overall: A good solid porter, above average and worth a try."
"Drinks well, medium body for a porter"
"Dark brown with only a hint of amber red at the bottom of the glass, the bubbles on the pour billow beneath the surface before forming a dense head, too dark to trace bubble beads. Roasted malts, coffee bean, cocoa powder and an herbal streak fashion the nose, hint of rum raisin, takes the turns at high speeds as if wanting to show off. Full-bodied, very smoky with a strong chicory streak, gives it a more dark chocolate and bitter profile. The raisin, plum fruit sneaks onto stage, sweetened by molasses crisp notes. Minimal sign of hops, malt the whole way through. Suggests it could be more bitter than it is, this for the best."
"A nice smooth light body makes this beer go down very easy."
"Very, very drinkable, especially for a porter. I could drink these all night. I wanted to try so many other beers because the Daily Pint has such a great selection, but my conscience would not let me waste my alcohol tolerance on a different brew. I had the feeling that no other cask of Stone Smoked Porter will ever taste quite this good."
"D - I found the flavors to mix well, and none to be overpowering. A well balanced beer, and before I knew it, I had drank the entire bomber. Goes down so easily and smoothly, and is very, very drinkable."
"I enjoyed this beer. It has that Stone taste, you know? I generally don't really drink porters as I'd rather just drink a Stout for a similar taste and style. This beer was very smooth and easy to drink - nothing groundbreaking, but it certainly had a character and some interesting flavors. Aroma was also nice. I just kept wishing that it was a little more full-bodied and I wanted a little more bite from the alcohol - maybe I'm just used to imperial stouts. I'd have another one, but I had a Ruination IPA (one of my favorite Stones) right there so I drank that. I'd probably drink most other stones that this one, but this is still a Stone - tastes great and is very enjoyable to drink."
"This is an easy drinker with subtle smoke, may be a great way to introduce folks to smoke beers."
"D - This is a good smoked porter. Its mild smoke quality makes it more versatile when pairing it with food and it won't wreck your palate for another brew."
"I expected to be overwhelmed by this beer, in a bad way. I couldn't have been more wrong."
"Curious taste. Quite a lot of terrain in this palate. Starts with a rich, cocoa-heavy chocolate character and then gets actually darker, like black coffee, only the mouthfeel is light and smooth and carries away the over-roasted flavour so you almost don't notice it. Finish almost has a raisiny character, it's slightly tart but mostly quite sweet, with- this will sound crazy - a flavour almost akin to musk (and I don't mean animal semen). It's not as powerful as some darks that I've had, but there's a lot of character on that and the flavours are quite pleasant. Again could probably use more, but it's very good for what it is."
"Would go very well with a steak."
"Pours a deep tan head over a clear dark brown liquid, ruby highlights. Light wisps of smokiness mingle with roasted malt makes for a quite appetizing nose. A basketful of flavors follows: light chocolate, coffee, roasted grain bitterness and a good amount of hoppiness, then some latent smokiness appears with an undercurrent of butteriness. Finishes with a bitter note...the smoke flavor accompanies, not dominates this super quaffable Porter. All blends together in perfect harmony."
"Body is closer to a brown ale, no real balancing hops. Don't get the fuss over this beer."
"Pours with a medium tan head. Well carbonated, dark brown color with red highlights, almost opaque. Smells of coffee, chocolate, roasty smokiness. Starts sweet, more chocolate than coffee with a hint of bitterness and an underlying current of light smokiness. Medium light body. Finish is smoky and roasty. Overall want to like this more but seems like it could use a little more smoky flavors. Would drink again."
"tastes pretty much as it smells, with some roasted nuts, and a touch of vanilla, end is a nice bitter."
"One of my favorites from the guys at Stone. Add this beer to your next batch of chili for some added smokey beer flavor."
"Notes: Like I said after the initial sip, perfect dessert beer. Despite the name, it's not nearly as smoky as I was expecting. But, what is there is a sweet, roasted malt bomb that completely satisfied my craving for something rich and delicious. In the future, if I'm looking for something of the sort again, I'm leaving the Young's DCS behind and grabbing this instead."
"Overall, this is a very complex beer with many layers that is very fun to explore."
"Overall - A pretty good porter although not as smoked as i was expecting - i would have liked it a touch more pronounced. In fact this was more like a chocolate stout / porter than a smoked one... certainly worth a try though..."
"The best Porter I've ever had...eclispses the Alaskan Smoked Porter with ease. Wow."
"Pours a dark brown that shines red into my Guinness pint glass. Head is voluminous and pillowy, a sandy-tan color that leaves good lacing. Aroma is malt, wood, bread, a touch of fruit. Mouthfeel is smooth and rich, with medium carbonation, a little thick compared to porters I am used to. Taste is chocolate, nuts, roasted malt, with a smoky flavor that is very distinguishable but does not knock you over the head. A little sweetness in the middle though with a surprisingly mild hop bitterness towards the finish. I have never tasted a brew quite like this; besides being a very intriguing smoked beer, it is a fantastically balanced porter in my opinion. The taste only improves as the beer warms. Drinkability is excellent due to the (thankfully) low-ish ABV and intriguing flavor that has you wanting more immediately after the taste from the previous sip has diminished."
"Poured a two-finger tan head that gives off sticky lace and dies slowly over a dark brown, almost black body. Roasted malts seem to cover up other malts in the smell as there is a smoky, charcoal like smell. A semi-sweet and creamy medium-bodied beer that has good flavor. Toffee, chocolate, coffee, roasted and some toasted malts w/ hints of coffee and bread malt with moderate dryness produce a balanced beer that hits on many strong points of porters. Not slick or anything but finishes by gliding over the tongue. I could sit back and nurse a bomber of this anytime."
"I will recommend and drink again on the finest occasions."
"Pours dark brown nearly black with a small to middling tan head. Intense smoky aroma hits the nostrils like a freight train and clears those sinuses straight out. Taste is primarily coffee with the smoky flavors coming through on the back end. This beer is not messing around."
"A near-perfect offering from Stone in my book."
"Pours a think brown color with a massive light brown head. Head retention is excellent. Aroma is rich, roasty malt and very smoky. Taste is filled with the same flavors as the aroma. Rich and very roasty, hints of burnt espresso with a very smoky backbone and prevalent hop character as well. Bitter, dry finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a tad more carbonation than I generally like, as I expected from the large head. The alcohol is fairly low, but with such bold roasted and smoky flavors, this isnt a beer you want more than one in a night. It is, however, an excellent version of a smoked porter. For a beer with flavors this bold, I would expect a higher ABV."
"D- a smoked porter that doesnt remind me of sipping pure liquid smoke is a good thing. easy enough to finish the entire bottle myself in about an hour. the lower level of alcohol makes it almost sessionable, which i could see myself doing if in the right mood."
"D: A really nice porter but way too over carbonated. Not jumping to the top of my porter list but I would be happy to drink it again and recommend it to anyone."
"Easy to drink but still a bit filling."
"Poured from a 22 oz bomber into a pint, well twice... Had this before at Taco Mac, but didn't want to review at that time. This time I had it with a steak at home, and it was an excellent match. Pours a deep, dark, black color and a nice thick caramel head (aggressive pour). The smell was not as overwhelming as some other smoked brews I have had, not bad, just not that strong. Light smell equated to lighter smoked flavor, but definitely an excellent, thick porter. Personally, I have been hit or miss with the smoked brews, but this one accented the flavor well, while not overtaking the rich porter tastes of the chocolatey malts. As rich as this brew is, it goes down easy (but filling). It's not the alcohol, but the thickness that makes one bomber about enough (well maybe it was the steak too). Definitely an excellent porter."
"D= A very solid porter with a modest smokiness. This woild make a great gateway beer for those wishing to try their first smoked beer."
"Pours a reddish black with lots of bubbles witha carmamel head. Nose is of smoke and molasses. Taste is of faint smoke, malt, caramel, all with a faint background of char. This beer is surprisingly light on the palate. Excellent balance and great drinkability-one of my favorites in this category."
"D - Depends on your personal preference, but I found it above average but not exceptional in terms of its drinkability."
"Overall, very pleased. A terrific beer to pair with a steak."
"Not as good as the Alaskan version, but a very good beer."
"Overall, a damn fine porter and a damn fine smoked beer. Even my dad thought it was good, and he's a Schaefer kind of beer guy. Stone again does not disappoint."
"D- excellent! Smooth drinking, very well balanced. An excellent porter."
"7/4/8/3/14 (3.6/5)"
"(rated Jan 15, 2007)"
"Stone recommends paring with both BBQ and deserts, which would go well. But today we had it with a bacon and squash pizza (no tomato sauce), and it was excellent. Any pairing with bacon or something that goes with bacon would be wonderful."
"D- I'm not general a big fan of porters, but do like smoked beers. I liked this a lot! I thought the smoke was very balanced with the malty sweetness and didn't over power the way some do. I drank with grilled pork chops and thought they complemented each other nicely. I will definatly buy again and could drink a few of these at one sitting. Over all another very nice beer from Stone. Cheers!"
"Future outlook: Without doubt, I'll be getting this again."
"Not as smoky as may have been expected, but a very good offering from Stone, nonetheless."
"also, a buck or two cheaper than most stone beers, so a great bargain."
"I don't know why it took me so long to drink this Stone offering. Now I do. Kind of lackluster for Stone. Not much of an aroma; typical chocolate, coffee, and smoke, but not strong. Color is very dark brown with minimal tan head. Flavor is good; coffee and smoked malt, but not as big as I wanted. There is also a noticeable lack of hops. This is a stout more than anything else."
"This is a great beer for beer geeks, and perhaps why I like it. The nose is just so intriguing. I could spend hours sniffing this one. On first sniff I got charcoal and smoke. Then I stuck my schnozz in there again and smelled some dark fruit, then some wood, then licorice and herbs, then some pine needle, then some smoked salt, then....well, I could go on and on. The nose is so complex you can dig-out all kinds of aromas. Like I said, a beer geek's beer - you could study this one for hours. Some may be turned off by this one, but I find it really fun. The mouthfeel is perfectly porter - light, dancing, but still bursting with flavor. The palate mirrors the nose, and leaves a nice, complex, lingering aftertaste. Again, not one for everyone, but a great brew for the adventuresome."
"Pours dark black with a nice, foamy brown head. Beautiful, steady, permanent lacing that lingers down the glass. Great looking beer in the glass. Smells of weak malts -- no smokiness, no chocolate, nothing else. Very disappointing aroma. Flavor is lots of chocolate, ironically not very smokey at all. Digging deeper there is some dark fruit there. There's a bit of a watery character to the beer as well. Unusually weak brew from Stone. Other reviews on this site rave, but I didn't come away with a great experience from this beer."
"Overall: A very good smoked porter, a nice well built malt body that had a smokey creamy mouthfeel. There is an astringent finish with a touch of hops that gives this beer some balance. I enjoyed drinking this beer."
"I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a kick-ass and kick-your-ass porter."
"D. This is a great porter. Hands down."
"I've had some better porters and I'll stick with those. But this is nothing to scoff at."
"I'm so happy to have Stone in Florida. I've tried several of their beers over the years, and I'm really looking forward to the ""big beers"" getting here. In the meantime, Arrogant Bastard, Ruination, IPA, Pale Ale, and this - the Smoked Porter, will have to do. This one poured dark, retained head to the last drop. Toasty, coffee-like flavor, with a hint of smoke added to the mix. Unlike some beers of the style, this is not dry. Actually quite refreshing and very easy going down. As good as an American Porter as I've had. Now, if we could get Alesmith down here!!!"
"Pours very dark brown to black with a smallish off white head. Aroma is subdued roasted malt with a touch of smoke. Taste has a light background sweetness. Chocolate and coffee notes. The smokiness is not overpowering at all and actually complements the other flavors. A little roasted malt bitterness. No particular flavor dominates. Very balanced and very good. Not too heavy.. medium to full bodied and well carbonated which adds a bit of bite that works well with this beer. An extremely flavorful beer which is also quite drinkable. Excellent overall."
"D: Strong malt flavor might turn off the average ber drinker but very pleasant."
"Very nice beer indeed."
"Big Hunt/16 oz/$6"
"A mouth filler for sure, but thin enough where you know this is porter. If I closed my eyes, I'd swear this was fresh from the tap. Very smooth and, if you are a porter person, easy to drink. One of my favorites."
"Another great effort by Stone...."
"Pours a pure black with a large, fluffy tan head which recedes in a dilatory manner leaving a sheet of slightly pocked lacing all around the glass. Aroma has elements of dark chocolate, burnt wood, very slight notes of caramel and is not as bold as expected. The palate is filled with notes of dark chocolates, coffee, cherries, licorice and hops, with the smoky characteristics revealing themselves in the very end. The taste is very well-balanced, and like the smell, isn't as bold or complex as expected, but remains tasty and satisfying nonetheless. I would go as far as to say the seeming innocuousness of the aromas and tastes are part of what make up the special charm of this brew. Mouth-feel is slightly thick and creamy, thus making for a smooth ride down the gullet. A fair amount of carbonation is revealed with a quick shake. I haven't had a porter in a while, but this one makes me happy I decided to get back to em'."
"I picked this one up at Skibbo's on East Tremont in the Bronx last week and let it age for a month which is long time for me. Probably should not have had Stone's Russian Imperial Stout prior. Nevertheless, poured into pint glass to show off on on black with brown residue tints on the side. Head was fairly big with solid lacing that drooped off after 2-3 quafs. Nose was on on strong roasted malt and hopearth secondary aroma. The taste was very pungent but not overpowering becuase my pallet still has the RIS hanging around. Mouthfeel was thin and sharp bitterness from the hops. Good heavy porter."
"D: Very good drinkability with good complexity and well balanced providing a great experience."
"Really an outstanding brew. Great flavor, great smoke, without being overbearing or having strange flavors. Pours great, a dense frothy tan head and impenetrable black liquid with just a tinge of brown at the edges. Smell is okay. Taste is fabulous. Very drinkable for such a ""stout"" brew. Stone continues to impress me."
"Pours a deep, dark chestnut brown, almost black with a foamy beige head. Smoky malt aroma with hints of dark chocolate, coffee and toffee. Smooth, delicaate mouthful with a slighhtly bitter finish. Creamy chocolate roasted maltiness with hints of roasted cofee"
"Sort of thin, but very drinkable."
"The aroma is about what I expected. It's smokey, toasty, malty, nutty, and mildly alcoholic. The appearance is red/brown with a nice foamy head. The taste is like the aroma with a bitter finish. The palate is OK but not as thick as I was hoping for. Overall it's pretty good for a smoke but I don't really like it."
"Nice drinkability with good carbonation yet nothing over the top."
"had again about 2 years later. more chocolate and smoke. not distinction of sourness. nice fruit qualities still secondary to the smoke."
"Finishes very clean and the body is medium light making this beer very easy to drink."
"D- It's been a while since I've had a really good porter and this one reminded me of what I was missing. A really good porter."
"Pours a pretty nice translucent brown with a minimal tan head and good lacing. Aroma is pretty light an airy, with only a little bit coming from the smoke. I'd say the best thing about this beer is the blend of the smoke with the roasted malt. It's very subtle, though and I think they could make it a lot more noticeable. Pretty easy to drink but the water quality doesn't quite fit in with the taste of the beer. This beer got a lot of hype and it's decent but if it wasn't in a big Stone bottle I probably wouldn't think much of it."
"Overall this is an excellent porter and a nice contrast to Stone's hoppier brews."
"Overall: A worthy to good beer on the BA scale. Will probably enjoy again, but not the first thing I will look for on a beer list."
"Drinkability - Too heavy to drink a ton, but certainly not bad."
"A good porter with chocolate and coffee notes but less flavor than hoped for. Ok. Let's start with the bad stuff. I expect a lot out of a Stone beer, and the Smoked Porter didn't quite live up to my expectations. I don't mean that it was bad. It's a big, flavorful porter that pours a rich, dark brown color and supports a nice-sized, coffee-cream head. The appearance is spot on, but the smell unfortunately doesn't punch as much as the look. Rich chocolate sweetness predominates the nose, but it lacks the complexity of a bigger beer. I'm not being very forgiving here, but I was hoping for more smoke and more interest from this entry in Stone's lineup. Smoke is also disappointingly weak in the flavor profile. It's there, but I was expecting and hoping for it to punch me in the face. Chocolate and coffee were both stronger for me than smoke. It's a good porter and I enjoyed it, but it's probably not a beer that I will be returning to soon."
"drinkability is decent. this is a solid porter, but the smoke is very understated. the aroma shows promise with a nice base of smokey tones wrapped around a rich roasted character, but the taste does not follow suit. could be much more assertive without any problems."
"Pours a dark, nearly black, mahogany. Gives off faints bits of red light when placed against bright light, otherwise appears black. Head is small but creamy, leaves a bounding amount of connected lacing. Smell is nutty, taste is chocolately, smokey, pure porter goodness. Mouthfeel is nice and chewy, robust and comfortable. Drinkability is high as this is an incredible brew. Another winner, as expected, from Stone brewing co."
"D: It's heavier than most porters, which kind of negates the positives of drinking a porter. I like porters because they pack a lot of bold malty flavor while still being drinkable and sessionable. Still, Stone's porter is a top-notch beer that I wouldn't mind trying again, but not if I'm really craving a true porter."
"D - Good flavor and good mouthfeel combine for a rather drinkable porter"
"Very easy to drink. Definitely would have another one; the rich flavor may be too much to make this a session beer but you can't beat that flavor."
"MF/D - Smooth and creamy with a clean finish. Extremely drinkable while refusing to be simple."
"D - I'm so glad that I've finally found you, oh glorious Stone Smoked Porter."
"Very drinkable, with a nice bit of character from the smokiness, but not so powerful a smoke character that it prevents one from drinking more. Overall mostly balanced and quite good, though not hitting exceptionality."
"D- for a smoked porter I was a little disappointing but overall not a bad beer, probably classify this as a lighter porter."
"I poured a 22 ounce bomber into a standard pint glass. It pours dark with a medium sized white head. The head leaves quickly with minimal lacing. The smell, while not bad, is disapointing. A heavy malt sweetness is the most powerfull scent, with a minimal amount of smokiness. The same can be said for the taste, nice malty flavors, with a miniml smoke aftertaste. The beer is medium bodied with above average carbonation, not crazy-just slightly more than average, and is quite drinkable. Not a bad beer, but a disapointing one. The smoke element was underwhelming. An enjoyable porter, just not much of a smoked porter."
"D: Not bad but wouldn't be the first beer I reached for when choosing a porter. Lower 5.9% alcohol makes it easy to drink"
"Overall impression: This one looks great and the rest of the experience isn't too shabby either. I was expecting more smoke from a smoked porter, especially with Stone's reputation for big flavors. Overall, I'd definitely put this on a short list when I reach for a porter, but it is definitely not at the top of that list."
"An enjoyable smoked porter, though not the most memorable I've had of the style, nor from Stone's line-up, although it'd make a great intro to the style for the wary or unsure, very approachable for a Stone ale."
"D - This is a easy drinking beer that never tires on the taste buds. Would be a great session beer."
"Good body and quite fulfilling, not a beer you would drink a bunch of. Well done at a moderate ABV. Good winter warmer type beer if you ask me."
"Drinkability is better than many porters. This style is not at the top of my list like it was in the past, but this is one that I could drink plenty more of since it is not so sweet. The $3.99 price tag on a 22oz doesn't hurt either."
"22oz bomber obtained at The Lighthouse in Manchester, Maine. Pours a virtually opaque black body with ruby-red highlights around the edges with a good half inch or so of light tan head. Smells roasty and slightly smoky. Tastes very roasty with some caramel malt sweetness, hints of citrus hops in the aftertaste, and undertones of smokiness. Rich full body with very moderate carbonation. This one is definitely a sipper, which is fine since the flavor lingers longer. One of the better porters I've had for sure. I'll be sure to try and pair it with a pulled pork sandwich sometime..."
"This porter comes out of the bottle a deep, opaque sable, nearly black, with a thick, fine-bubbled tan head. Aroma is thick and smoky and has hints of coffee, unsweetened chocolate, and what seems like wheat. Flavor is like well-roasted coffee with a subtle sweet undertone and hints of chocolate and molasses and even a touch of nutty taste. Texture is sublimely smooth but has just a bit of an edge."
"I love this porter. Pours a dark black refreshing, with a frothy head tan in color. Head retention was pretty good. Some lace found on the cup. Smells of smoke, wood, some coffee and chocolate notes as well. Tastes like smokey heaven. Very nice flavors. The smokey taste hits the front and it finishes with a great aroma of smokey coffee notes. Very smooth and fairly light in body. Drinkability is average although I would not mind having a couple."
"Drinkability- Solid."
"No aftertaste, pretty sharp, the smoked flavours were very shy!"
"Appearance is an inky black brown with a thin but frothy tan head. Aroma has only faint notes of campfire smoke and a little roast malt, and no hop aroma. Taste has some nice flavors of roast and black malts with notes of dark bitter chocolate, licorice, coffee, and yes, some faint smoke. Moderate hop bitterness actually left a mild tang on my tongue but the semi-sweetness of the malt balanced it nicely. Some faint but interesting grassy and lemongrass-like hop flavor. I felt that the mouthfeel was a tad thin for a porter but it was rather drinkable for that reason. This was a decent beer, don't get me wrong, but there definately was a lack of boldness for this style in the mouthfeel, the hop bitterness/flavor/aroma, and especially with the smoke flavor and aroma. Maybe because Stone makes such awesome beers I was expecting more. Still, a worthy beer for consumption."
"A smooth and easy drinking beer, flavor seems a touch subdued. Maybe it was a touch to cold when I consumed...hmmm, possibly."
"D: Overall, this is a drinkable beer. I think it's a bit on the overrated side, but it's still a well made beer."
"D - The mouthfeel and the muted yet apparent flavor make for excellent drinkability. Good stuff."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a mild carbonation. This is a nice porter, but I don't see, smell, or taste the smoke"
"Taste is brilliant, with toasted malts, vanilla toffee, caramel. The hops add a nice spicy bitterness and a hint of pine. I hesitate to call this ale ""smoky"" as much as ""roasted", as I don't get that heavy smoke flavor like with a rauschbier. Creamy in the mouth with a well carbonated peppery finish. This one is subtler than Stone's other porters, but an amazing offering nonetheless."
"Stone wins again!"
"A subtle beer for Stone. Doesn't knock my socks off but is well crafted and quite delicious and I'd certainly buy it again."
"Pours out dark, with a hint of brown. Forms a nice head on top, and leaves decent lacing all the way down the glass. I love the smell, smells smoky and roasty, very enticing. I'm nost sure how much I like smoky flavors from my small experience with smoked beers, but the taste is still very subtle, though the smokiness seems to come out more as the beer warms. I wonder what this would taste like without the smoked malts. I really love the mouthfeel, it's a bit creamy and very, very smooth. And I think that could make it very easy to drink a lot of these in succession, though I think I would get bored of the smokiness after a while."
"This beer is very easy to drink but the taste of it leaves you desiring slightly more to it-it has a bit of blandness to it. I would probably drink another given its smoothness."
"D - well, I've been wanting to try this for a while and it's certainly very good. The smoke is a nice touch, and this is just a really solid porter all around. Definitely recommended, and I look forward to having more of this in the future as autumn cools us off down here!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a very dark reddish brown, edges were slightly lighter, Head was 2 fingers frothy foam that clung very well and left a nice layer on the top. Aroma was slightly sweet, but also reminded me of fresh cut grass outdoors. Taste was a bit of melted brown sugar with burnt brown bread. Felt of in the mouth, but was slightly bitter and acidic. Reasonable to drink, but a good sipping beer, not a session beer."
"Drinkability: Anytime. I repeat, anytime. This is a spectacular beer and a spectacular Porter. You could drink this with a hearty meal, while sitting back in front of the tv, or any other time whatsoever. I don't know if there's ever been a perfect Porter, but this is as close to it as I've ever had."
"D- Chuggalugg + Om Nom Nom. Goes down easy like a porter should"
"Taste: The smoke dominates the flavor. No noticable hops. Some dark malts."
"D: Very drinkable porter, I really enjoyed it."
"So glad Stone is now available in GA. This is my third style and they haven't disappointed yet!"
"A very attractive beer at a decent price. There's surprisingly little smoky aroma when you open the bottle, and even very little when it's in the glass. The color is rather teaky around the edges of the glass but become nearly black in the middle, with a tan head that froths up nicely and fades quickly. There's a nice amount of smoke in the taste with a solid porter platform that I'm sure would be fine on its own. The smoke isn't overpowering and even tastes a bit salty. A nice hit of malt up front and just a tinge of hops as it goes down. I had this with pizza and apple pie-- a great combination! Very much worth drinking, more than once. (Just ignore the bloviation on the bottle's label: as on other Stone bottles, the staff brags a bit too much about themselves.)"
"I would enjoy this again."
"Exceptional from start to finish. Exactly what I was looking for when I picked up this Smoked Porter. Light shows through which i did not expect, showing a dark brown with hints of reds. The smoke is not overwhelming, its just right. Great smoky chocolate taste with a creamy feel. So smooth and easy to drink."
"Had this on-tap at the Brick Store Pub. Pours a nice black color with an adequete head that fades to a ring. Smells lightly smoky and quite creamy. Taste is similar. This is far less smoky than any of the Schlenkerla beers, but the smoke is noticeable and beautifully wedded to the rest of the brew. The surprising thing to me about this beer is how creamy and smooth it is. The rich, creamy body marries very well with the smoke and helps to balance everything nicely. The Alaskan Smoked is far more smoky tasting, but in that case probably because the body is not as robust and creamy as this is. The balance in this beer is a thing of beauty. I recently tried a bottle of this that had been aged a year as well, and although it was still drinking beautifully, the smoke was even more subdued. I also like the fact that this doesn't have that much residual sweetness, despite the creaminess. A very nice beer."
"A pretty good porter. I don't detect hardly any smoke though. Other than that, everything you want for the style. It paired well with some grilled steaks for dinner."
"Thank you Stone..."
"Overall, this is a great smoked porter. It is not heavy or thick, but has a lot of smoke, chocolate, and cocoa flavors that get the job done."
"A pretty drinkable porter. Not my favorite style of beer but this is pretty exceptional."
"I didn't enjoy this beer as much as I could have, it's too smokey for my taste. I could recommend it to try, but I don't know if I will be picking this one up again."
"Pours a deep brown with a bit of ruby. Somewhat light in color with a rich, tannish head that has great retention. Smell somehow doesn't reveal the smoke that I expected, only on a very small scale toward the end. Very nice chocolate scents, luring me in. A bit of cocoa and a touch of coffee. Again, the end displays the smallest hint of smoke. What a great tasting beer! The smoke is definitely here now. Still, it only provides an added complexity to the beer itself. Nice chocolate flavors, toasted caramel and roasted malts. Smoked barley plays well with the rest of the flavors. Shockingly, the hop presence in the finish of this one is nearly on the level of the Pale Ale. Well, maybe not, but it wasn't expected so much here as it was there, and I welcome it. Excellent medium body that is silky smooth, with a nice roast/smokey finish that works wonders. I could drink a couple of these no problem, though a regular Porter such as Black Butte would be easier to return to on a regular basis. A very unique brew and the smoked barley does it good."
"Pours pitch black. Fine lacing and a thin film of head follow. The aroma seems subdued and restricted, but hints of coffee, smoked alder? and hop spice can be uncovered. Notes of chocolate, smoke, dark fruit and a rush of hops hit the palate. Big, full, chewy and warm mouthfeel that is balanced and smooth. A fine porter from Stone that could use a little more smoke character, but overall very enjoyable. The salient hops push this closer to a stout. I dig it."
"Great beer, so glad Stone is in town!"
"Stone's Smoked Porter is full of flavor and medium in body, with fine carbonation that gives the drink a light, creamy feel. So drinkable I've caught myself wanting to quaff this one down and crack the other I have languishing in the fridge... but that's just being greedy, isn't it?"
"This is very drinkable. Goes down very smooth and would make an excellent session beer. Could be a bit lighter on carbonation."
"mouthfeel is nice - a bit thin, but gets better as you drink more of it and your mouth gets more or less coated."
"A very drinkable porter, one of the best I've had."
"D - With such a strong smoke taste one is enough."
"It was tasty, and I'd certainly drink it again, but it was neither my favorite porter nor a particularly smoky beer."
"D - Easy to drink beer, I could have had more for sure. I will probably try again at some point at somewhere else to see if my ratings were thrown by a temperature or pairing issue"
"Overall: good porter, not a great porter"
"D.. This a good smooth beer with stong smoked flavors that ill have to enjoy again"
"Beyond being a solid Porter, I find it disappointingly not-very-smoky. I can remember regular non-Smoked Porters that came across smokier. Also, there was a surprisingly strong hop flavor for a Porter that I found to be very nice. Stone would do well renaming this to Stone Porter, sans Smoke."
"Light to medium body, it has the expected roasted notes, but mostly chocolate and coffee. Everything not exactly strong or remarkable; a pleasant brew, but in my opinion does not deserve to be called smoked. Subpar for Stone."
"M/D - Full flavored but a touch thin on the feel. Too much carbonation. A very drinkable porter."
"Notes: This one is remarkable. A quintessential brew for a cold night to warm up ones soul so very nicely. Cheers"
"A - Dark mahogany with a thick head that quickly sinks into the beer, leaving a ton of sticky lacing behind. Not much aroma, but a little malty chocolate and just a hint of smokiness. At first I didn't taste any smokiness at all in this one, so I was quite disappointed. Tasted like an average porter; roasted malt and a slight sweet chocolate flavor. However, as it warmed up a little, the smokiness started to emerge a little bit. The smoky flavor was still not as bold as I expected though, but that's not a bad thing. Excellent, full mouthfeel. Overall, not as bold as I expected, but a really well balanced porter, nonetheless."
"An easily drinkable beer for the style. The smokiness contributes without dominating. Grab some BBQ to enjoy with this one."
"I've been waiting a while to try this one and I must say that I'm not disappointed - the hype lived up to itself. Holding the glass up to the light reveals a sumptuous dark mahogany colour. There's a good porter aroma with a hint of the advertised smoke. Porters can be smoky even when they're not described as such but this one lets you know it's there without being overpowering. The flavour is pleasantly dry but cut by just a hint of malt. It's a big beer, no two ways about it. Something to round off the night with, like a fine glass of port, but not a session drink. Can't wait to try this one with a good quality cheese."
"Thanks Stone Brewing Company for another amazing beer!!!"
"D- pretty good, idk a little underwhelmed, some of their other stuff is alot better. maybe im just spoiled by having had so much of black hawk porter and smoke on the porter recently"
"D - I love the smoky taste that isn't overdone in this porter. The balance is unusual for Stone's ales, but a welcome trait w/ plenty of fresh hop flavor that lets you know it is a porter from southern California. Possibly in my top 5 Stone ales - I really love a little smokiness in the porter Top notch drinkability I could see myself drinking more of this as the weather gets cooler"
"Drinkability: Good looks and great taste on this one. A little disappointed in the body, but overall, a delicious, dessert like beer."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, even if you don't like smoked beers (as I don't), because the ""smoked"" aspect of the Smoked Porter is not its most prominent constituent component - it's merely a nice addition to an already very balanced and drinkable porter. Alcohol is of course also not a factor here. Give it a shot."
"22oz bottle, purchased somewhere in Boston for $5. Consumed during the month of its best before date. Pours very dark with minimal head. Nice lacing though. All malt aroma of medium strength. The first sip gives an initial peppery sensation. The peppery sensation remains throughout. Nice malty flavours, with some coffee tastes thrown in the mix."
" The smoke aspect of this beer is very subtle. It has a slight smoke smell and a very slight smokey flavor. It is a decent porter, certainly not the best porter I've had. It is pretty thin too which was disappointing. I would drink it again, but not at the price tag I paid for it. Maybe it's better on tap."
"O: Quite good. Complex, interesting, very delicious taste. Stone are masters at what they do."
"I would definately drink and recommend this beer to others. Sit back, relax, crack on open. I suggest that you drink it just above room temp.. I promise, there should be no naysayers on this one. Thanks for the time. Ciao"
"Overall this is a good porter, worth trying and I would drink again."
"D - This is a damn fine brew, but I guess I was expecting more complexity. Don't get me wrong, this is complex and tasty, just not to the extent that I was expecting based on the name and the hype."
"This beer is a bit of a puzzler, had some really great qualities and some fairly average ones as well. I will immediately skip to the overall because overall this is a nice porter and I got a lot of enjoyment out of it. Aroma is medium to mild with scents of chocolate and roasted goodness, it's just too mild to be given a higher score. Great pour one of the best I've seen from a porter. Rich and dark this is a looker good swirling tan head and loads of tacky lacing. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth but lacks a thick creaminess I like to find in a good porter, it does get better as it warms but still doesn't hit the right level. Flavor is real nice. I can smell a bit of the smoked flavor as I drink, my taste buds first pick up on some chocolate and caramel followed with a bitter coffee taste. The smokiness is mild and it hits the back of the throat on the way down leading to a great exhale. A stronger aroma and thicker mouthfeel and we would have a superior porter."
"The beer poured with a slight amber tone to a generally dark black appearance. Thick lacing on the sides and overall on the head. Great, literally, smoked aromas but mainly around chocolate, coffee, malt and yeast. Taste is a balanced sweetness with a burnt aspect to the flavors. Good, crisp mouthfeel aids in a refreshing carbonation and extenuating flavoring. Overall, very nice."
"Very tasty, and I am going to try Stone's recommendation for a sourdough bread, chunky-style all natural peanut butter, and blackberry preserves sandwich with this porter!"
"Color is a dark brown, cola-like, but almost no foam. Smells mildly of smoke. Tastes moderately of smoke and licorice. Despite the lack of head, there's a solid amount of carbonation in this. Because it's on the milder side (unlike Alaskan Smoked Porter), this is a very drinkable beer."
"D - A very very drinkable porter... Nothing is overdone... Everything is subtle, which only adds to the richness and complexities... Fantastic... Just a beautiful beautiful beer... One of the best I've ever had..."
"D- Very nice porter. I enjoyed the nice balance and refreshing taste. I would deffinitely session this brew."
"This beer pours black with brown hints and a fluffy tan head that holds and laces well. The smell is of burnt chocolate and sweet caramel. Taste is subtle burnt chocolate with roast hints, caramel, and a slight smokiness at the back, certainly not the intense smoke of Alaskan Smoke Porter. Mouthfeel is medium with pleasant carbonation. Overall not smoky enough for a smoke beer and not chocolatey enough for a porter. A decent beer nonetheless, just not my favorite porter or my favorite stone."
"D - This was a one-timer for me, although it wasn't painful by any means."
"Hail Stone Brew!"
"drinkability is good. a balanced and enjoyable beer. glad i got a chance to re-evaluate this one as my previous bottle was definitely past its prime."
"A hell of a barbeque. Main dish? Chocolate, hot off the hickory smoke. A side of irish soda bread with a dash of charcoal. A tall glass of cocoa cola syrup with an order of tips and bits. A Midwest must have. Garnish this Porter with fresh caught Crappie and grade A crappers. Bon Appetit!"
"A pretty good smoked porter. By looks alone it may seem as scary as the gargoyle on the front of the bottle but upon first sip you realize that this brew may not be as aggressive as it seems. Although malty, the taste is a little on the bland side but that isn't a terrible thing. Because the taste is so acceptable it makes for a great mouthfeel. You don't ever get the urge to just drink this fast. This beer doesn't attack you, it's much more like a neutral country allowing the invading army to pass through to get to the real battles. Highly drinkable over a period of time and smokey enough to enjoy; the only downfall lies in the unexpected knockout punch that never comes. This is just another example of thinking your opponent hits harder than you do but comes up short."
"D - Was expecting much more intensity in the flavours than I got. Overall balance is quite good, with nothing overwhelming."
"If you ever have the chance, try the brandy aged version of this. That is a world better."
"Overall this was a solid porter, but didn't have enough smokey flavor for me. If I want to drink a smoked porter, I want to taste the smoke. I think Stone could have somehow made this beer more drinkable somehow."
"D: One of the more drinkable smoked beers out there."
"Definitely enjoyed this one, but it is a bit heavy and not really something that I would want to drink a lot of. A bomber was definitely plenty."
"Drinkability: Got through the whole bomber, but it started to become heavy towards the end."
"D- Very enjoyable, but I don't know I can really enjoy more than 1 22oz bomber in a nite to make it sessionable. Not too much alcohol, but I think the next bottle wouldn't be appreciated as much."
"D: I could smell this one all day long, but it's just not as tasty as the aroma might lead you to believe."
"First sip and the first thing I notice is how smooth this beer feels in my mouth. Its like iced coffee. Tastes of bitter chocolate, coffee (of course) and some smokiness definitely stands out but its in no way overpowering. Its actually quite a nice balance with the smokiness. The West Coast hops are present as well in the finish and provide a nice bitter dryness. Wow, this is good."
"Looks like a porter should with a thick tan head receding to lace down the sides of the glass, a little quickly, but who hasn't been there? The color is a nice dark brown with red highlights. The aroma is a little light for perfection, but still the smoke and the malts come through nicely. The taste is wonderfully has wonderful undertones of chocolate and sweet malts. The mouthfeel is definitely full and rich, with a nice amount of carbonation."
"M/D - A great porter that finishes well and leaves a great taste in your mouth. Recommended and a consistent porter."
"Now inside my top five porters"
"T-Again wonderful everything that the nose hints about this beer comes through in the flavor and just as bold the complexity it amazing and only outdone by the balance in the beer. Nice full body with a near perfect carbonation level for the style this is perhaps the best porter i have ever drank and would reach for it time and time again if i had the oppertunity."
"D- Strong smoke flavors don't make this a quick-drinker, but it still is pretty easy drinking. A nice offering from Stone."
"D - Awesome beer that combines two of my favorite styles. Will definitely be looking to pick some more up soon."
"Overall, it's a one-trick pony, not especially smoky (but then again I love Rauchbier). I kinda dig it -- one caveat, though, if you're not into the smoky beer thing, don't bother with this one!"
"Mouth feel is about right for a Porter and this is actually quite drinkable."
"This beer is smooth and easy to drink. It has a very glossy feel with low carbonation, mild flavors and almost no bitterness."
"Poured very dark, with a decent head. Loved the ""smokey"" flavor and feel of the beer but i was a little disapointed with the nose...couldn't really smell the smoke. As far as drinkability, it was awesome...I only had one and was sad to see it go."
"The beer poured an inky-black with a thick, brown head into a pint glass. The aroma was of burnt wood (reminded me a bit of how my clothes smell after being around a campfire). The smoked malt was very evident in the first taste, with the roasted malt and burnt toast flavors evident as well. The smoked flavor complements the beer style very nicely, in my opinion."
"I was thinking Stone would try to overpower me with this one, but they didn't. This was a tasty and well balanced porter with a fairly light smokiness to it. Come to think of it I kinda wish they did try to blow me away. Oh well, still a good beer, and maybe they will come out with an imperial version."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Roasty and smoky with subtleties of coffee and burnt bread. Dry throughout - I can't pick up any sweetness whatsoever. The body is medium-full and chewy, moreso than the average American porter. The smoke flavor is plainly noticeable but nicely balanced; it blends nicely with the other flavors rather than dominating the palate. The finish remains dry, revealing a mild earthy hop note that pairs nicely with the smoky backbone."
"D: Extremely drinkable porter right up there with some of the best I have ever tasted! Easy drinking and not too heavy to consume. Not sure it should be called a smoked porter though. Drink at cellar temperature for best flavor and it should pair well with a wide range of food styles."
"D: For me this would be a great summer at the lake beer, but I have always enjoyed porters and stouts in the warmer seasons."
"drinkability: very very nice, I find the bitterness in combination with the chocolate notes intoxicating, it's light, low and alcohol as well. Really drinkable!"
"I would enjoy this beer much more as just a Porter, that hasn't been smoked,"
"Carbonation is low to medium. This was an interesting version of a porter. The smoky/toasted flavor does get a little bit overwhelming in my opinion, especially after my second glass, but this beer is worth a try."
"Took me ages to breakdown and buy this one. Guess I was afraid to find a better porter than Edmund Fitzgerald. Pours a deep brown, which is always nice. Smells like mocha malts, which probably don't exist, but that's what I thought of. Tastes like coffee beer that is thick on the palate. Great mouthfeel, but after it's a little too thick and sticky, however this is far too fantastic to let something like that be irritating. Once again, well done Stone. Best porter I've had to date."
"D: Excellent beer, not quite my favorite American porter, but definitely would have this again, especially at this price"
"The taste is rich, deep, and complex, yet smooth. It has caramel, a nice coffee-chocolate quality and very faint hint of smokiness, giving a wonderful texture of sweetness and bitterness, with lasting, well-blended flavours. The feel is smooth, rich and a touch oily."
"I'm a wimp when it comes to smokey beers but this one is my favorite. The smokiness is subtle and lets the other flavors and aroma shine through. Right up my alley. One to try and enjoy."
"Anyway, extra credit for being from my hometown of San Diego!"
"incredibly creamy texture. it has a sweetness that combines very nicely with the bite of it. smoked flavor is very subtle, but it is there on the aftertaste. very smooth, drinkable, and very well balanced."
"A nice dark beer. The beer is dark as pitch. A slight head. I got a nice malt small from the beer. I didn't detect any smokiness in the smell. But the taste, that's where I picked up on the smokiness. The initial taste reminded me of some fine smoked bacon. Which, I will admit is a strange flavor to associate with beer, but it's one I like. I noticed a roasted malt flavor as the beer sat on my tongue. Easy drinking, and not very filling."
"Poured this into my Val Dieu chalice. Poured a jet-black, very similar to Stones IRS but just a little less oily. Unfortunately this beer didn't pour much of head, mostly I think, because it was much cooler than it should have been. While it was pretty cold, the lacing lasted all the way down. ""Amazingly rich, dark and delicious yet this is our least understood beer."" This is off of the back of the bottle. Unfortunately, I have to disagree. While, I do agree with the dark and delicious part, I can't figure out while people wouldn't understand this beer. The only thing I don't get is why they would call this a ""Smoked Porter"". I couldn't find any smoke in this beer. The aroma is dark chocolate, a bit of coffee and apples. The taste follows suit with bitter, baker's chocolate and java. Still, there is absolutely no smoke involved in its flavor. I think the reason I like this beer is the lack of smoke flavoring. Really this beer tastes more like a thin double stout then a Smoked Porter. The mouthfeel is full; it is much thicker than most porters. I find this beer really drinkable. It's tasty and smooth but the one thing its not is Smoked. I think I would review this beer much higher if they would have left off the Smoked moniker."
"While the four years in the cellar has brought a complexity to the nose, the body and pallet has faded."
"Overall, a very drinkable brew, a very good example of an American Porter. I was slightly disappointed in the overall lack of smokyness - if you're going to call it smoked porter, you damn well better have some smokyness about it - but that was set off by the all-around good qualities of the brew. Possibly my favorite American Porter so far."
"Pours a promising thick black with good off white head. Nose is strong, but I find not enough roasted malt, and very little smoke. Taste is ok, alot of that signature stone flavor, some very little roast, and very subtle smoke. hop bite on the finish is ok, maybe a bit strong for the style. Mouthfeel is pretty thin, and too dry. Drinkability is good. Overall this is an ok beer. Defenitely funky for a porter and quite soft for a smoked offering. I realize they intended for a subtle smoke, but it is the porter brew itself I find a bit off. a decent beer, but one I probably won't buy again. I love stone, their in my top ten breweries in the US, but i think they could have done better with this one. Used half of it to flavor a blacktail deer roast. will post if works well."
"Highly recommended porter..."
"MF&D - Medium bodied porter. Clung to my mouth well and left a pleasant aftertaste. IMO not quite as good as I had hoped."
"this beer poured a browinish black with a little head that turned into a straw colored ring. i couldn't detect much in the nose at first because i think the beer was a bit too cool. as it warmed up, i noticed the smoked maltiness. this beer isn't complex in the nose, but smells delicious. the taste is of roasted malt with some hop bittering. superbly balanced. the mouthfeel is full and great for this style. overall, this is a freaking awesome beer that i could drink on the daily. a big thanks to barefootbrewer for sharing this one with me."
"D: one of the best smoked porters out there. I have yet to be disappointed by Stone, and this is another reason why. Very drinkable."
"kinda bored with this one, nothing new added, maybe a little hoppier than the usual porter, mouthfeel not as thick as could be, but does get thicker as warms"
"This was definitely a great, very smooth, easy drinking dark relaxation."
"22oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark black color with an off-white head that leaves a decent amount of lacing. The aroma is dark roasted malts, roasted coffee, and a touch of smoke. The taste is dark malts with a lot of bitter roasted coffee flavors and some smoke and hops in the finish. Overall, this is another solid offering from Stone that is recommended."
"This had a very heavy coffee taste with an extra hint of smoked flavor. It wasn't very thick, like a stout, but it was definitely full-bodied. Overall I'd say that this was more of a sipping beer, but it was yet another enjoyable porter. (No notes on the appearance or smell.)"
"Smell is of dark malts with roasted coffee aromas - no smoke on nose. Taste is a tad smokey - lighter for those who don't like a beer to smokey - very pleasant coffee notes with dry yet pleasant finish. Easily drinkable, but not something that I'd want to consume ""Mass Quantities"" of better as an occasional sipper or heavy meal."
"Pretty thick in mouthfeel with low carbonation. Smooth but a little flat to me. Overall one of the better smoked porters."
"Now, if only I could find a place that carries it around here!"
"D - Tis would be fantastic with something grilled or by itself, extremely drinkable and will have another shortly."
"This is a beer that I would not mind drinking again. Tossed a few down in the cellar."
"While generally not a big fan of Black Malt, this is the bottle that has made me a beleiver...I really like Porters now! This one is absolutely great, the best one to date. No not watery hopless brew with nothing but burnt barley taste no, no, no. Here is the real deal a beautifully crafted Robust Porter with just enough ABV as to enjoy a few, and a great bone white thick creamy head on top of a dark garnet brown sea of greatness. Definatelly has a hop presance that perfectly balances out the nutty, coffe notes that dominate the flavor profile. Nearly faultless as these bottles went quick and will definately find its way back to my cellar very soon."
"D: The lighter body lends itself to better drinkability, but the utter domination of the smoked flavors grow tiresome by the end of this bomber. Not terrible, but not a beer I'll return to very often."
"M/D: Body is full, carbonation a touch high, little bit of a velvety touch. Can be slightly thin at times. Really nice drinkability. I pretty much pounded my first glass without thinking about it."
"D:Very easy drinking porter. In fact almost a bit light for me. Seems to be one of the lightest porters I have had. That being said, you can almost session this porter."
"Drinkability- When chugging, smoke actually shows up! I'll give this drinkability a 4.5 just on that fact. Also, Stone Smoked Porter is quite drinkable under optimum conditions."
"I had high hopes for this beer but was quite disappointed."
"Very drinkable porter. None of the flavors or aromas are super notable, but they mesh together well."
"Black pour with a big tan head. Smell is slightly sweet roasty malt and chocolate with a medium level of smokiness reminiscent of smoked meat. Decent mouthfeel, but a bit thin. Smokiness is more subtle than the Aecht schlenkerla beers, but still very much there. Flavor overall aside from smokiness is a bit thin and watery. A bit underwhelming, although not a bad beer. Wouldn't buy again though."
"A solid smoke flavor without being overwhelming on top of a good base beer. Flavors of the base beer come through."
"D - Where's the smoke? Will not by again."
"This is another solid offering by Stone. Not too much smoke, just enough to give a great layer of flavor."
"Great on the list of Smoked Porters. Cheers!"
"Poured this beer from the bottle into my tasting glass....Dark, good 1.5"" head that dissipates to .5"" after a couple of minutes. The nose is initially you get the smokiness of the beer and deeper in you get the classic porter notes of mocha and fruit cake. If I were to mention smoked salmon, mocha, and fruit cake to someone, they would probably say yuck, but it really works in this beer. Pretty well balanced tasted, with a nice smoky and bitter type finish. The mouthfeel is big and creamy, very good. The drinkability is pretty good as the alcohol content isn't too strong."
"D-Easily a good drinkable beer, goes down pretty smooth and the palate is not overpowered by the smoke."
"Overall, a very standard smoked porter, above average for an American Porter. As usual with Stone, delightfully made and spot-on for style."
"D - Pretty good overall, definitely more sessionable than most of Stone's offerings, and that's not a bad thing. Balanced and tasty brew, one that I will revisit and recommend."
"D: Rather stout, but still very drinkable. I had this with fried and breaded cube steak mashed potatoes and Cajun corn. Went awesome with this Southern fare. Almost perfect beer! drink it!"
"Overall an excellent porter from a brewery that has yet to disappoint."
"Drinkability: Overall, I think this is a good beer. Something I'll probably keep in my fridge, but possibly in small quantities. The smoked flavor started to bother me a little towards the end of the beer. I think I could enjoy one or two of these in a session and then have to move on. I started to think about an odd analogy for this...so here it is...but i warned you, it's odd. It's like when you meet this hot girl who smokes. The sex will probably be great, but she'll taste like an ashtray...I guess you have to take the good with the bad. Hey....at least you got laid!! :-)"
"D: Could easily finish a bomber myself. *hic* Absurdly low ABV compared to some of the monsters I've had recently."
"D - This is a really good smoked porter. I fell in love with smoked beers a couple years ago, and this doesn't disappoint. Did I expect any less from Stone?"
"Mouthfeel comes off a little thin and watery. Somewhat lifeless compared to the beer itself. This a very drinkable and unique porter. After the initial glass new flavors and subtleties continue to emerge. The smoke flavor is not the centerpiece, but acts as a complement to a fine porter."
"I liked this beer so much, I even bought a stone smoked porter glass. This is one I will eventually try and replicate as a homebrewer."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: The beer has a full body, though in my opinion it could be a bit smoother. Higher levels of carbonation lend a rough character to this beer in terms of feel, maybe it would be better if those levels were lower? I can see it pairing much better with a silk pie were they lower, I mean two products both extremely smooth on the palate? it don't get much better than that. This is a beer that I think that I'd have to be in the mood for to buy again, I can really only see drinking on bomber, more than that and it might just be to overwhelming."
"D - Great beer. I love this porter."
"D: Very high for me. Offers the complex flavors of a good stout without being thick or overly filling. I love stouts in the winter but this is very satisfying and a nice change. I will purchase this beer again."
"Overall: An intense porter; another great Stone offering"
"Overall, I really enjoy this beer and its smokey taste. Its a well done porter by a fantatic brewery! Try this beer! Cheers"
"I drank this beer at a brew pub in Easton, Pa called Which Brew. Since porters are what I drink, this beer was right up my alley. I never had this beer before and I must say the taste to me is very inviting, it was smooth to start with a slight bite at the finish. I enjoyed this beer with dessert and went very well with chocolate drizzled cheesecake. I liked the beer so much that I went and purchased it at my local beer distributor. It came in a case of 12- 22 0z. bottles which will last me one long weekend. The 22 0z. bottles is a lot of beer but the beer is so smooth it makes it easy to drink. I also recommend having this beer with a nice T-bone steak and some chocolate fondue for dessert."
"722 reviews as of this writing. the bottle script has a fun story of this beer not being for everyone and they're fine with that. I guess this puts me in the not quite my type of beer category. a 22oz of this is too much smoke for my taste buds. I'd be curious to try it again at a real barbeque house but otherwise I'll step back and leave it for the real fans. cheers."
"d: Balance makes for an easy drinking porter. A very well made smoke beer, the smokiness is definitely there, but it provides a nice addition, rather than being the basis for the brew."
"Nice, sludgy motor oil look to it; decent head. Smoke scent is subdued; nothing overpowering here. The jerky-ish smoke is woven nicely throughout the malt, but again, the taste of malt and hops is a little subdued in this instance. Well-made stuff indeed, but not necessarily my thing."
"Served in a standard pint glass (thanks Stoneman78). Growler opened with a pop and a rush and left some specks of porter on my kitchen ceiling (guess it's fresh :) Poured the color of obsidian, followed by a luscious coffee colored two-fingered head that settled into a quarter-inch consistent layer of foam and ringlets. Lots and lots of lacing; just like drinking a coffee milkshake. Scent of hops, roasted malt and espresso, as well as a lingering smokiness in the nose. Nice mellow taste - unsweetened cocoa, coffee and malt with a slightly hoppy finish. Nice medium-bodied mouthfeel; not too much carbonation. Very sessionable porter."
"I have to say I avoided this beer thinking i wouldn't like it boy was I wrong. Everything I would expect in a porter(chocolate and coffee) a hint of licorice with a touch of German smoke beer. The smoke was not overpowering making this beer suprisingly drinkabile."
"A very strong selection from Rogue - outstanding stuff and a superb representation of the style... Copped a 1pint, 6floz bomber from Total Wine and More in West Orange... one of my favorite brews from Stone... Pours an ebony hue with a dark, tan, frothy head that soon dissipated... aroma was not too apparent, although cocoa and espresso smells were noticeable... flavor is what it was all about with this one... rich, thick, roasted-malt, dark-chocolate taste with a nutty, latte like characteristic... good, solid mouthfeel with excellent drinkability make this a terrific sample and a pleasure to drink... went down very smooth without any bitterness detected... the relatively modest 5.9% ABV also helps with the overall drinkability... great stuff from Stone... Definitely recommended..."
"At 5.9% abv, this is one of the more sessionable Stone offerings I have had. I could easily have a couple of these with no problems. This would be a good beer to pair with smoked meats and game. This is a natural choice for when I am in the mood for something other than a hop bomb."
"D - Overall a very good porter, just not as smokey as I'd a liked. I recommend picking one up if you see it."
"D - Very good..enjoyed all of it and look forward to the other bomber I have"
"This is a great porter. While relatively light in body, it has loads of different flavors that make every sip novel. Try it if you like porters/stouts."
"This beer was incredibly drinkable."
"Stone's description of deep mahogany is pretty accurate. Short, but beautifully brown, medium density head. The nose is very pleasant, primarily a faint licorice smell, perhaps a hint of oak. Mouthfeel is not at all bad, but maybe just a touch watery. No one pervasive taste. Nice, muted malt sweetness balances with a similarly muted hop bitterness. It finishes dry and the bitterness persists. I don't get the chocolate or smoked character that is expected. Easy drinking at 5.9%. Everything combines for an outstanding session beer."
"D - an accessible porter that is easy to drink a lot of. Have to like a smoky flavor to like this though would be my only thing. The thinness of the body makes it easy to drink and it is easy to find and not too expensive as it was 5 bucks, which is not too bad for the bomber. I think if it were thicker I would change from a beer that I would buy just to drink and session to one that I would pick to sip and enjoy while reading a book."
"22 oz bottle. Pours a nearly black ruby color with 1 cm off-white/tan head that is mostly diminishing. Aroma of roasted malts, coffee, and caramel, very slight aroma of smoke. Initial flavor is a little sweet and smoky at the same time. Aftertaste is lasting and dominated by smoke and bitter from coffee or chocolate. Medium bodied, light carbonation, light lacing, and only a hint of alcohol detected. Very drinkable, as both a good porter and smoky beer."
"If you love smoke, and you love porters, this is one for you."
"This is one of the most complex and enjoyable porters I've ever had."
"D. Drinkable. Overall seemed vacant to me. The framing is up and ready but there is no drywall, much less fittings, paint and furniture... Color me unimpressed."
"Poured from a 22oz. into a pint glass- Deep dark brown/balck color with a perfect tan head. Great head retention. Smells of light smoke, with some malt and hop. First taste is wonderful, filling flavor of dark malts and light smoke. The Smoked flavor is not overdone one bit. Wonderful full, smooth feel in mouth, with a slight bitter finish, which helps flavor keep. Overall another wonderful beer from Stone, and definitely a great porter to session."
"D-Certainly not the best smoked porter out there...but the best one that is widely available. A solid all around porter that I enjoy when I see it on tap."
"D: Well, I'd have to say this is a wonderfully drinkable beer. If I was one to session a porter, this would be up there in my list of choices."
"D: Absoulutely fantastic. A well rounded beer, great from start to finish. Glad I bought a 2nd bottle."
"Poured a bomber of this into an English-style pint glass I just got for Christmas. Black with hints of red where the light hits it. Thin light-colored head. Keeps you company throughout the entire experience and leaves some serious lacing. Chocolate and caramel are evident on the nose, both burnt. Decidedly malty. A little on the weak side, especially at first. Taste is a robust combination of coffee, coal, cocoa, and caramel, which provides great alliteration. A little on the thin side, though still medium bodied and lightly carbonated. With such a low ABV and great taste, this makes for a great session beer."
"D: The moderate body, balance of flavors and modest ABV make this a wonderful session brew."
"Mmmm. A nice and long lasting flow over the palate. The tones are even and it leaves a long taste in your mouth. I have saved trying a lot of the Stone productions in order to build up my palate, but I have to say that I am satisfied with this one beyond what I had expected. I have tried others with stronger flavors, so this wont be an all time favorite, but my opinion of it will always remain high."
"D: Drinks alright - it's pretty heavy. Alcohol is burning nicely. I think one per night would be my max."
"Moderate dark bread aroma with a light tinge of resin. I pull a bit of burlap frm it as well, but it fits. Many if these scents come through in the taste, but also add in there semi sweet chocolate and a distinct maltiness. I think it is officially my favorite porter, now."
"A fine tasting brew that all could drink all night. Extremely drinkable and proves to be yet another astounding offering from Stone."
"Drinkability- I just ate about sixteen pounds of sweet chili hot wings and this thing is the perfect desert. The light smokiness with the chocolate background makes this a really good Smoked Porter. Its only a step behind the Alaskan Smoked Porter but the availability of this compared to ASP is fantastic. A solid, solid brew from Stone."
"Pours a very dark brown with an off-white, latte colored head. Good thickness on the head and hangs around a while before receding to a nice surface film and lacing around the edges. The name is in the smell and taste, up front you get the smoky malt aroma along with a hint of citrus and roasted nuts. In the taste you get more heavy malt flavor, along with chocolate and smidge of hop bitterness. Nice texture in the mouth, with the right amount of carbonation and a slight aftertaste of those smoky/roasted grains. Definitely the kind of porter you could have several of with ease."
"D- More drinkable than many smoked beers, although I am a fan of rauchbier."
"Medium body, good amount of carbonation, just a hint of citrus. Chocolate permeates the whole flavor in a very subtle way. Easily drinkable, and very enjoyable. Simply a pleasure to drink."
"Mouthfeel is moderately thick, creamy and leaves my tongue a bit sticky. Extremely drinkable. Smoke seems to be one of those flavors introduced into a beer that can go horribly wrong. Stone has struck a really nice balance here that enhances the beer. A solid brew -- surely not a novelty."
"D - Different and fun."
"I have to say this is only my second Smoked Porter and my first was Alaskan, this is definitly not as good but still a good offering. Pours the darkest brown I've seen, just shy of black. A small tan head formed but it didnt last long and no lacing either. Smell is of some sweets, some caramel, but mainly that of a smoked meat or fish. Taste is good. The taste is a complex blend of the actual smoke flavor, some malt hints, some of coffee, a bit of malt and small touch of bittering hops. It does have a slightly heavy mouthfeel and leaves behind a rather thick and almost oily aftertaste that I wasnt fond of. Overall an easily drinkable beer, light on the ABV and best at a warmer temp. A good offering from Stone."
"Smells of light smokiness, coffee, maltiness. Tastes of more smokiness, coffee flavors, roasty & toasty, good bbq beer. Mouthfeel is light/medium bodied, good carbonation, and semi-dry finish. Extremely drinkable."
"D - I'm drinking the 1pint&6oz bottle, which is the perfect amount of this beer. Wouldn't want anymore than that. It goes down nicely on its own and even better with a quality piece of chocolate."
"With this relatively low ABV, this a great brew to spend a cold winter night with."
"Porter good."
"Deep, dark brown under a slim, sticky tan head. Clean malty aroma - brown sugar and chocolate with a hint of dark berries...not much more than a wisp of smoke. Chocolaty, malty flavor with a surprising amount of oily hops to balance. Not too sweet with, again, a very mild smokiness. Medium body with a lingering dryness."
"If you've got a cook-out or something similiar coming up, even just a family barbecue, treat yourself and pick this up."
"Super drinkable beer and was an absolute delight with my meal! Cheers to Stone"
"drinkability - One of the bested smoked beers I have tasted, enjoyed this one. Stone makes some good stuff."
"Purchased 3 weeks prior to review from Wine Society, Nashua NH."
"The bottom line: Don't buy one of these expecting Rausch Porter, because you'll be disappointed. Stone has crafted a fairly average porter, and then added a hint of smoke to it. The end result is drinkable, tasty, and probably would make a damn fine pairing with some BBQ ribs, but it's not going to blow you away."
"$5 for the bomber."
"It's the first lawnmower smoked porter I've had. A good beer but not great as it should be."
"Out of a bottle, the beer's appearance was very dark with minimal head. The aroma consisted of malts of the chocolate variety. I really couldn't smell a smoked aroma to the beer. The taste was surprisingly bland for a porter. I did not detect any smoked flavors. It did have a decent hop to it, but nothing out of the ordinary. As for the drinkability, given that is essentially vague, one could have three of these beers before realizing it was time to move on. In my opinion, the beer got better and better as I got deeper into the bottle. I wouldn't seek this beer out, but if it was offered to me, I would not turn it down."
"Not a bad beer, but I wasn't hugely impressed by it. Definitely recommended though."
"I found this one to be only slightly above average. Of course, that doesn't mean it's a bad beer, it's just nothing special, plus a hint of smokiness. Just recommended."
"Pours a deep dark brown with reddish edges and a 2 finger tan frothy head. Lacing left on the glass through the finish. Aroma is malty and coffee like with some smoky flavors noted. Tastes of chocolate, coffee, toffee, caramel, and a lot of smokey flavors. Hops are well balanced and bitter in the finish. Mouthfeel is a little heavier than medium viscocity. Overall this is a decent brew from Stone. I definitely enjoyed it better when I blended a little Lindemans Kriek Lambic in with the Smoked Porter. It was excellent, and the cherries and coffee/chocolate flavors blended very well together."
"I could drink these all of the time in the winter months. A very good porter."
"D- Combined with the subtle tastes, the light mouthfeel and the smooth drink, this is a very drinkable beer."
"This isn't my favorite offering from Stone, but it is still better than a lot of beers on the market. If they sold this in Texas, I would certainly pick it up again. I will look for it when I travel out of state."
"D- the smoke is a nice novelty, but this is a treat to savor, not a go-to beer or something to session. puttin away the brown bomber though, was no problem at all."
"D - This beer is a feast of complex, dark flavors. The best aspect of this brew is the way the flavors merge in a long, drawn-out finish with a beautiful chocolate character. The easy drinkability is all the more impressive considering how bad smoked beer can get in the wrong hands"
"$4.99 @ Liquor Stop, Highland, IN."
"Pours a very deep dark brown color with a khaki colored head that left some chunk lacing on the glass. The smell is of chocolate and carob, perhaps some wet wood burning on a fire. The taste is of bitter chocolate, roasted coffee beans, burnt caramel, honey, bitter dark fruit, and some grassy hops. A pretty pronounced hop flavor but still takes a backseat to the maltiness of the brew. The feel is well bodied and smooth, finishes bitter. A good rich porter, with excellent chocolate flaovrs. Not much of a smoked presence."
"Poured black in the glass, quite opaque actually. Tan head was a solid finger with moderate retention and good lacing. Smelled of biscotti, milk chocolate, toffee, almonds. I found the taste quite agreeable, mocha and chocoate predominant with mild bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is silky and smooth, well balanced with a light body. I found the smoke understated in aroma and in taste, subtle at best; an elegant Smoke Porter and very drinkable."
"Tastes similar to the nose. Notes of molasses, coffee, roasted malt, chocolate, the hops come through nicely. The smokiness subtle but still has an effect on things. Another great beer from Stone."
"try this with a steak or some ribs."
"D- Easy drinking porter at 6% with very well-masked alcohol presence, easily a session beer that is wonderfully delicious and complex. I am not a huge porter fan, but Stone Smoked Porter is simply the best of this category and one of the top beers I have ever reviewed, do not hesitate to have several bottles readily available for BBQ or meat-intensive dinners, and be sure to grab the special Porter with chipotle peppers whenever it is available at Stone. . . YUM!!!"
"Mouth feel is quite good. A good robust porter but not over the top in its' chewiness. Very drinkable for the style but not on my list of sessionable porters despite it being a damn good straight up porter with a nice little twist."
"Pours a reddish brown color witha nice brown head. Aroma is nice and creamy with some subtle smokiness. Taste is nice and smoky with a good balance of malts as well. I can even detect some burnt coffee flavors towards the back of the throat. The aftertaste is dry and smoky as well. Very drinkable and would compliment certain foods well. I love this beer."
"Not my favorite porter, but a darn fine offering & one I'll be happy to go back to - on the rare occasion I can find it."
"I have had this one about 30 times before...This is my first rating of it."
"On tap at the brewery after the tour. I have had this before but this one had more flavor. Dark black with a cocoa head. Smells smoky. This just tastes way too smoky for me, I wonder how they get the smoke flavor?? My cousin's exact words were :""You can't hide behind your IPA forever!"". Needless to say the Stone employees did not take a liking to us. I bet this would be better with the chipotle peppers or vanilla beans to temper that smokiness."
"Got this on tap at the Yardhouse in San Diego, CA. Was served with a rootbeer like color and head. Head was a tan wheat color. Darker than most heads I've seen. The body of the beer is a pitch brown color with mahogany undertones. Smells were a nutty, yeasty brew, not bad, fits for this beer. Alcoholic notes as well. Taste was with nice campfire flavors burnt and roasted barley. Definately a dry one, like licking the ash off a burnt coal. Drinkability is fair on this one, nothing to write home about, but would definately order again."
"The smoked porter comes in a dark bottle with no freshness date. It pours a hazy dark hue with very little foamy head. The smell is unique and has a nice roastiness and smoky hint to it. The flavor of the beer is nice and smooth and in the mouth is quite chewy. This is a bold and strong porter but well done."
"Zum Wohl"
"D: As I said before, it's probably a little too extreme yet for me but I can appreciate it for what it is. Would work good sipping during a winter movie night. This bomber will be enough. I'll try this again around jan. 2009 and see what I think then."
"Overall, this is a tasty, spicy porter that is most notable for its rough-textured mouthfeel and lack of drinkability. If you want a really ""smoky"" porter, stick with something else (Left Hand's Smokejumper comes to mind)."
"Overall: every smoked beer I have had has been super meaty, peaty, and almost jerky like, and this was way different than that. The smokiness stays in the background and just adds some complexity, I thought it was more porter than smoked porter. That said its pretty damn good, and way more drinkable than the other smoked beers I have had."
"Drinkability: If I had more, I would drink more... but, alas.... the Bomber is gone.... Oh to live in San Diego.... I would have this alot! Highly recommended."
"Pours almost black with a ruby hue. 3 fingers of light chocolate milk head with an aggressive pour that holds then dies to a ring. Smells of chocolate and a little caramel with a hint of smokiness. Tastes as it smells, subtle but delightful flavors and even an ever so slight hoppiness. Medium, creamy and smooth as silk in the mouth with a slight carbonation tickle. Drinks like a session beer and delightfully so."
"Pours an almost opaque deep dark brown almost black with a frothy dark tan head that slowly diminishes to a thin layer and leaves decent lacing on the glass. The aroma was of smoked malt, burnt espresso and molasses. The taste is a wonderful blend of smoke, black malt, espresso, molasses, and a hint of dried fruits, wonderfully complex and not at all overbearing. The mouthfeel is a near perfect light medium bodied with low carbonation. This beer is the almost perfect accent to a chilly rainy evening."
"I had this on a recent trip to Indiana. I have had this beer before, but didn't remember much about it. I was hoping for a little more smoked flavor but this was still a tasty brew."
"This is a great beer. I hadn't had it in a long time, but decided to have a short affair with it tonight. Poured out of the bottle a deep chocolate color, erring on the side of a reddish, black appearance. It foamed up with a beautiful tan head that lingered around .5-1 inch for half of the quaff. The smell reminded me of fresh caramel followed by a hint of smokiness. The taste was definitely smoky with a taste of bitterness reminiscent of dark chocolate. This bitter sweet character was carried through to the end of the swallow which left the palate with a pleasant, bittersweet aftertaste that makes a man not want to brush at night. The drinkability is good, but after more than one of these, you may find yourself searching for something that doesn't make chest hair grow quite as fast."
"D: a very nice porter. pour me another."
"**this beer hasn't lived up to my original score after repeat tastings. Knocking it down just a tad. A bit one note for me, at this point."
"This beer is fantastic. It pours black with ruby highlights showing when held to the light. Head is small, minimal lacing. Smell is nice, with coffee, chocolate, smokey savory notes, and hoppy floral notes. The taste is fantastically complex, with meaty smoke flavors, herbal bitter hoppiness, coffee, chocolate, cream, sharp cheeses, nuts, etc. Damn this gots the complexity goin on. Mouthfeel is quite nice and this is quite sessionable. Recommended."
"Pours black with ruby highlights and about two fingers worth of tan head that leaves behind gobs of lacing. Smells pleasantly roasty and lightly smoky with some chocolate. Tastes much like the smell; smokiness dominates while roasted malts and chocolate provide a solid backbone. The smokiness dominates initially but slowly yields to a roasty flavor that itself dominates by the finish. Good mouthfeel, medium body, moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, I feel the smokiness builds and may be a bit overpowering after a few. This beer is a good, solid beer that I'd certainly recommend."
"Really want to try the brandy barrel aged if they ever have it at Stone again"
"D- This stuff is good. Probably my favorite porter. Has the big robust taste of a stout but the smooth drinkability of a porter. One I will definitely have again. Nice job by Stone."
"This is an entirely drinkable porter. If the title of the beer scares you off, or if you're not a fan of smoked beers, don't worry - this is not as smoky as you might think. It's a mild smokiness, evened out by a firm malt presence and nutty/coffee/chocolate flavors. It's a good beer, all around."
""
"Finish seemed a touch astringent for a brief second or two, but if youre in the mood for a smoked dark ale this is a solid choice."
"I poured this into a hefeweizen glass and got a black figure inside the glass, with the color fading on the edges of the glass. My mom actually asked me if I needed a fork to consume this beer! Yes, it's a rich porter with esters, a touch of chocolate, roasted flavors, and charcoal smoke. It was lighter than I was expecting in the mouth, and firm. The smoke can sometimes become too monotone, driving down the drinkability a bit. Delicious stuff."
"It poured into the glass the color of of coffee with a thick light tan head. I was expecting a bit more of a smell. I guess seeing that it's a smoked porter I was expecting a campfire or jerky aroma. I didn't really pick up any of that at all. The taste didn't hit me as smokey either. Just kind of an average to decent porter. I couldn't really detect chocolate, licorice, coffee, smoke, or any of that other crap the bottle had promised. Just a decent dark beer with a minute bitter aftertaste and low carbonation. Maybe it was sitting on the store shelf for a while or something. I've had a smoked bock before that reeked of smoke flavor in the past. I figured this beer would be similar. It wasn't even close."
"D/Overall Impression: Definitely an easy drinking sessionable porter. A dark and flavorful roasty porter. I was expecting a more smokey character."
"My favorite from Stone! Good look, very smooth, and easy to drink Porter. I always have this in my fridge! It appears very dark, almost black, with a nice kaki colored head. Auroma is plesant. The taste is hinted of chocolate, slight smokey flavor. This is a great after dinner beer!"
"From the bottle, this is still a great beer. Good taste of malts, but not tremendously overwhelming. slight chocolate taste, as advertised, but you have to search for it a little bit. good smoky aftertaste. Great mouthfeel, nice and crispy, but not before you get to taste the beer. I recommend it, but not quite as full as I thought."
"Overall, a very nice beer. Good to sip. Nicely complex. Good session brew. I appreciate that the smoke flavor is not overwhelming...just right."
"bottom line: Its better than average, great aftertaste, needs more alcohol/hop presence, but overall I enjoyed it despite the price."
"Mouthfeel is great. Nice creaminess and a good moderate level of carbonation. A bomber was definitely easy to get down. Porters can be hit or miss with me, but this one is very good. Recommended."
"D - A very good smoked porter with just the right level of smoke in my opinion. Not as smoky as Alaskan."
"D: A liitle heavy on this Southern California June night, but easily a session beer at 5.9%."
"Pours a dark black letting almost no light escape through the glass. Nice looking cream colored head which does not dissipate quickly. Smells hopped up and inviting however it doesnt nearly smell like i would expect for how dark it looks. Although the smell was mild, the taste is smoky and reminescant of burnt hops. Very tasty. It has a fairly thick mouthfeel and seems to be carbonated just the right amount, enough to give it a good consictency but not be distracting. It is a pleasure to drink but since it is dark the drinkability suffers a bit, easy to drink one glass but after that it gets harder."
"Final Note: I enjoyed this brew with a medium/well bbq'd porter house steak and a baked potato. Highly Recommended."
"D: For a porter, its not too heavy, and the alcohol is low enough to enjoy a few without getting too full. Quality beer indeed."
"Drinkability: Very nice. The smoke is well integrated with the base style, and the base is no slouch either. My only issue is that the smoke is a bit too light; I would have liked to see a bit more of it in the nose."
"I guess I associate stone with over-the-top hopped beers. And I like them. I also always look forward to their RIS release in spring. For some reason, I've never had their smoked porter, so I was eager to check it out. Over all, it's a good brew, a little lighter than I thought it would be, but a good brew. The smoke flavor is very light, I think the first thing I noticed about it was the strong hop flavor for a porter. I guess Stone just can't resist hops. I would have liked this one more if it was more roasty and less hoppy, but it does go down easy."
"Paired this with some home cooked bbq pork loin, baked potatoes, and corn on the cob. Poured from a 22oz bottle into pint glasses. Looks like a usual porter at first glance, dark brown with a nice fluffy white head. Smell was very nice, had a roasted and smoky aroma. The taste was the best part, because the smokiness wasn't overpowering. It was very subtle, which made this beer a nice addition to a meal. It didn't overwhelm the food, just complimented everything nicely. This could be a stand alone beer, but I prefer to drink it with some nice bbq food. A perfect combo."
"A great dark pour, very nice muddy-tan head, and an awful lot of carbonation & lacing...the nose was subtle on smoliness i found, more present were some roasted malts & cocoa notes...the taste seemed more stout-like to me, some dark chocolates, roasted malts and rich creaminess...the smokiness creeped in subtley mid-sip and didn't overpower the other nice qualities of this beer....a nice coffee-bean bitterness lingered...mouthfeel was both lively and rich and offered up some creamy texture...great drinkability, complex enough to sit and sip but fresh & lively enough to consume at will...i thought it was well balanced and the subtle smokiness was plenty for this beer"
"Thanks to HoppyBen for the taste and welcome to BA!"
"Drinking a bomber is pretty easy whether you have food or not. The scent initially warns of a strong, heavy beer, but that is so not the case."
"This beer is tasty. Smoke eludes the aroma, but pulls through on the flavor, especially as it warms. A hoppy pine note pairs well with mocha malts and a biscuity grain presence. Mouthfeel has a surprisingly hoppy bitterness. I was anticipating a coffee bite, but it works for here despite the style. A bit thin bodied, though. Overall, its an amazingly strong offer from Stone--as expected. For only $3.50 at Bode's in Abiquiu, New Mexico, it fits the bill. Pick one up."
"Bread/smoke/molasses for aromatics, that transfer to the tongue. Creamy, full-bodied & rich with almost a green apple lurking in the background that finishes quite clean. An easy drinker that you pull & gulp. I appreciate the subtle complexities that keep revealing a very well structured (not overly robust, not too smoked) offering. Highly recommended."
"The mouthfeel is rich and smooth but not thick in texture. The finish has a tightly carbonated cleanness. This porter has a relatively low abv of roughly 6% but the drinkability suffers do to the fact that the characteristic smokiness becomes a bit monotonous before the bottle is gone."
"Stone is always dependable. I first tried this on tap, and remembered the smell as being more smoky. But now that I'm drinking from the bottle, there's not so much. The aroma is more chocolate and roast malt, with some smoke flavor only showing up with the aftertaste. The appearance is really good too, dark black with mahogany edges, milk chocolate colored frothy head. Nice beer, nice brewery."
"Poors a real dark brown, with a finger and a 1/2 of toffee head. Smells of toffy and smoked malts. The taste is a bit light for me, i kinda expected a bigger flavor, a nice smokey taste sticks out in the end. no offensive taste, so still pretty good. Due to the light flavor this is pretty drinkable. Not the best stone beer or porter i have had, but still worth a try"
"Tan head and much darker color than regular porters. Chocolate and caramel malt smells. So far so good. Howver, the flavor was too astringent and burnt for my tastebuds. Too difficult to finish a bottle of this. Will try in colder climate conditions."
"D- Due to the fairly balanced taste, this is quite drinkable. Delicious, even."
"Pours rich dark brown to black with thin tan head that leaves a light lace. The head eventually dissipates almost entirely. Smells of roasted/smoked malts with a hint of coffee. Initially smokey malt flavor is nicely balanced with hop bitterness and a medium-lived slightly bitter aftertaste. Full-bodied, smooth, and slightly creamy with slightly alcoholic finish and good carbonation. This is a very tasty beer, and I will definitely buy it again."
"Notes: This one sat in my cellar for awhile. Can't say just how long exactly (I need to do a better job with my inventory control system), but I'm guessing it may have been a year or even longer. I may get a fresher one soon just for comparison's sake, but this seems to have held up pretty well."
"Lick your chops good. Another solid offering from Stone. I think this would pair excellently with many types of food, especially barbecue."
"Drinkability: Reasonably smoked, it gives you just enough of that smoke you want without ever becoming overpowering or life-threatening."
"D- This beer was good to try, but I will not go crazy seeking it out. Like all Stone beers, it is alittle different than the style that you are trying. I would like to try this beer ontap to give it another shot."
"Another awsome beer from Stone."
"The beer is a nice deep ruby color with a good sized head. The smell is smoke and there is a slight bit more hoppiness that typical of the style. The smokiness is not as evident as others of the style I have. There is also a hint of chocolate malt. The mouthfeel is good but there is just a slight chemical like aftertaste. Overall, a rich beer that is a nice treat."
"Bottom line: This is quite different from Alaskan Brewery's interpretation of a Smoked Porter, which is much more vigorously smokeie, but it's also quite good. I recommend it!"
"D- A worthwhile beer from Stone. Interesting. It must be the smoky character, but I kept imagining myself using this as a marinade for some steaks."
"D- wonderful aftertaste and very complex, this beer is meant for pairing with food."
"The drinkability is good,the whole package works real well, sit back, relax and enjoy this brew on a cool evening. Very nice. Prosit MK"
"I've come to have high expectations for Stone, and even if this one is post-dated, it's still good."
"Overall a very tasty and drinkable porter. Could spend a Fall evening with a couple bottles of this."
"Definitely a step away from other porters, I might have even mistaken this for a stout, but taste is really what matters right? Not some silly style guideline. The beer was a bit heavy, but not syrupy like some big stouts, and tasted of dark cocoa, a bit of espresso, and smoke. The bitter bite was a perfect pair for my spicey turkey sandwich and the remaining beer after I finished my meal was a nice dessert. Give it a try on tap, the bottles are too expensive."
"Excellent smoked beer. Thanks to morris729 for supplying this."
"Pours a very deep brown, black in the middle, with an espresso foam head that sticks around quite nicely. The aroma is rich in a dark way, with notes of smoke mixing with chocolate and crystal malts. On the palate, smooth sweet malts first off, with restrained smokiness in the background. Well-rounded, earthy bitterness comes through at the mid-palate and mingles with bitter roasted malts and that smoky aspect; those elements compose the long, dry finish. Mouthfeel is a touch more thin than it could be, and quite rough moving over the mouth. Overall, this is a fine smoked porter, but it's missing that extra gear. Still very good."
"BA Reflection: Looking at other reviews, I seem to be on the high end compared to everyone else. I love Stone and that's part of it. I think they just fit who I am. But beyond that this is a beer to be appreciated for the subtle character of the smoke. It's not a rauchbier and it's not over the top, especially by Stone's standards, and I think some see that as a weakness. When I first had this beer five years ago, I rated it even higher--in part because I was younger in my tasting and it's a really nice, complex beer that's not overwhelming or an extreme beer. On draft at RFD, it was also open and accented it's strength. Love this beer and will drink more whenever I get a chance."
"My first Stone porter -- on tap at Flatbush Farm. Dark brown, creamy head, didn't stick around. I'm sure if it were from a bottle, it'd be more persistant. Smells like a rauschbier. Malty, smoky, even peaty like a scotch. Wow! Burnt toffee, coffee, and baker's chocolate for sure. Tastes smoother than I expected, and remarkably little hops for the Stoners. Goes down smooth, but I think it's a bit too smoky to be a real session beer. Something I'd get on its own, or to mix it up, but I can't see putting back three or four of these. That said, it is seriously delicious if you like smoke and roasted malt."
"Drinkability: I know a lot of people love this beer, and porter is a classic style that I usually enjoy, but this beer just doesn't do it for me. I respect Stone a lot, they are one of my all time favorite breweries, I guess I am just not a fan of this beer. Not a bad choice by any means, I just prefer Stone's other, hoppier offerings."
"D - Great! Refreshing and delicious. I will likely have this again sometime."
"I definitely recommend this one."
"- Bomber pour, cellar temperature, into a pint glass -"
"My first porter. Dunno why I had never got around to one of these...especially from my favorite brewers of mass taste bud wreckage! The appearance is strait black with some ruby edging, with a robust tan head. The smell is fairly mellow suprisingly. The taste was also mellow, but a good mellow, not like a ridiculously overkill stout. I was lovin' it already as a re-introduction to the dark side hehe. I remembered it was smoked all the sudden and there it was in my mouth, a perfect level of being smoked. Good job to Stone on that (when do they do a bad job?) The head stuck around the whole bomber-full and the mouthfeel was damn heavy. I could feasibily drink two of these as bombers, but I think I'd be over the roasty-ness by then...very nice though, I'm liking the porter better than the stout!"
"Black body with a small one finger brown head that didnt last to long.Nice lacing and some bubbles coming up to the top of the beer.Some darkfruit and roasted smells and chocolate bitterness towards the end of the taste.I taste some bite from the smoke and maybe some vanilla in there as well.Mouthful is just right,with the right amount of carbonation and very coating.Mouthful is a bit heavy But its nothing I wouldnt like to have more of in this type of beer.Great beer and well worth the wait and hype,I would recommend people to check this out when they see it.It cost me $7.00 for a bottle,the first few times I saw it for that price I thought it was a bit steep but I caved in and had a great time with the beer.Great Job STONE!"
"Mouthfeel is great, a nice light, and very smooth porter."
"Poured from a 650ml bottle that I shipped back from Denver. It was nearly pitch black with dark mahogany highlights when held against a light. It barely had a head and it quickly went away. After reading other reviews that describe a large, sustaining head I have to wonder about the freshness of my bottle. But since it has no date on it I can't tell. The aroma is very subtle. It was sweet malty with just hints of smoke and the darker malts. Again may have been freshness issue. The taste was nice and solid but not as great as I'd expected. Overall a good tasty beer but I will definitely need to try again to see if better with a fresher one. (4, RR, T, Y)"
"It may not be a beer I'd drink often but would be glad to when offered. It's another one of those beers that I prefer at warmer than recommended drinking temperatures."
"Drinkability - Medium bodied. Mild carbonation."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours a deep, dark coffee brown color with a nice 1 finger head that slowly fades into some nice lace. Smell is very smoky (which should be expected). There is also some noticeable amount of chocolate and coffee as well. The taste is awesome - smoke, dark chocolate, and a nice dry black licorice-y finish. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy with a nice carbonated bite. Wow, this is easy to drink. The flavors are strong, but they meld together so well. This is an excellent porter. Highest recommendation."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied and extremely smooth. Its relatively low ABV lends well to its drinkability. Overall, this is a very good and underappreciated porter in my opinion. By far Stone's most underappreciated brew. Definitely recommended."
"22oz bomber pours a deep, dark brown, almost black, but with some dark red ruby notes around the edges. Coffee colored head leaves a bit of lacing. Very nice. Smell is dark chocolate, a hint of coffee and just a touch of smoke. Taste is bittersweet, dark chocolate, some earthy flavor and finishing with more dark chocolate and then the smoky flavor. Smoky flavor is present but not overpowering, really adds a nice touch to a great porter. Oh so smooth, beautifully balanced. This is really a great porter."
"Pours with a thin but consistent level of greyish head. Good lacing. Dark body with flashes of ruby brown found throughout. With the beer served cold I couldn't seem to find much in the aroma initially. I was happy to find that once it started to warm luscious notes of really bittersweet chocolate would arise. A faint dose of hops that are become slightly dulled behind hints of smoke. It's important to distinct it as 'smoke' - because it isn't really 'roast'. We're not talking rauchbier, but there is a distinct absence of roast and that quality has been replaced by the character of smoke - like that off a barbecue. Subtle enough though. Fairly luscious bitter sweet flavours in the taste department as well. Notes of toffee, chocolate, English pudding, trace bits of (now,) roast malt. A little less texture than I'm use to with Stone beers, but certainly the right degree of carbonation. The mouthfeel is a little underwhelming to be honest. That character of smoke (like that found in a smoked meat) is present but very unassuming on the palatte. A nice porter."
"Medium full in body, another perfect beer that forget about for a while and always come back to."
"Pours out a dark brown color with a light tan head, leaving pretty good retention and some lacing. Aroma is roasted with a little bit of chocolate, some caramel too. Some caramel in the taste, I definately get roastiness but the smokiness is very subdued. Medium bodied with fairly high carbonation. Pretty easy to drink beer, I'd probably have it again, but wouldn't seek it out."
"Opinion: Well, this is really a pretty good beer. It is pretty amazing to me how drinkable it is because I normally have a bit of a hard time drinking Stone's beers because they are so brutally bittered with high Alpha hops. This one is reserved, and lets the malt run the show...pretty much. All in all, I was a bit surprised at how mild it is, but it remains really drinkable. The smoke is an enhancement and not a showcase so that makes it all the better in my opinion. I would drink this beer again."
"Pours out a nice big head that falls fast leaves a thin layer of head with a pretty strong lacing. The color is black with dark brown color and an almost red color when the light shows through. The smell is smokey with a slight roasty character. This taste is very smokey, with very little roastiness, I sense very little characteristics of porter besides them, not that's there's many more. The mouthfeel was smooth and nice. Overall I don't see myself drinking much more of this. I may try again later."
"D: I have been attracted to the smoke element in beer as of late and especially in the porters. An incredibly balanced porter that has a soft smoke finish that leaves you wanting more with each taste. Recommend."
"Poured black with a creamy kaki head. Smelled of smoke, some peat, cocoa, hints of burnt caramel. Not a strong nose, but a nice mix of aromas. Tasted very smokey up front with notes of wood, peat, and raisin. Very smooth and smokey on the palate and easy to drink more than one. This was a smooth porter that would probably go well with smoked meats and creamy cheeses. Campfire-smoked sausage and gouda may be a good pairing."
"Pours a dark brown with a thck creamy tan head. Light to medium carbonation with hops and smoke coming through. Smell is of hops and a whiff of smoke everytime your nose nears the brew. Taste is at once smokey, a little bitter, with notes of cocoa. Your mouth fills with a chewy smokey medium body feel with every sip. Drinkability? Oh my, while not a session beer-I could have several of these as the taste is near perfect for me"
"Into a St Bernardous tulip glass, pours a deep bitch black, maybe a little ruby around the edges, light tan head starts about a half inch and shrinks quickly but comes back with a stiff swirl, strings of lacing cast about here and there. Aroma has loads of dark malts, chocolates are pronounced, some dark caramels, a bit of a bitter streak, smoke is elusive, everything is pretty nice, if understated. Taste is more of the same, and elusive smoke plays nicely here. Also understated is the sweet but dark caramel malt, chocolates dancing lightly. It don't remember subtlety being Stone's thing, but they play it brilliantly here. The mouth is very smooth, body is great, everything is working just right here. All I can say for this one is, its a very good beer, and I enjoyed it thoroughly."
"On tap at porters pub. My reeward for handing in paper number 2. Pours a deep dark dark brown. Bordering on black. A decent sized head with proper lace. Smell is of roasted malt. Subtle smoke lingers in the nose. Alderwood maybe? Taste is nice roasted malts. Like a nice piece of toast with some subtle smoke in the aftertaste. I can't quite pinpoint the exact smoky flavour but this a nice porter. The hops are a presence as well. You can tell this is a west coast porter. Mouthfeel is excellent. Perfect for the style. Slightly chewy yet not thick at all. I could drink a bunch of these."
"DA: Surprisingly un-impressed with this one on-tap. Good stuff, but was well under my expextations for this brew on-tap. Easy enough to drink though."
"D - I like what the smoke does for this beer. It adds another demension that keeps me wanting another sip. Great malt in this beer with hops making a quick guest appearance. A very nice, hearty beer for the cold weather."
"Stone, known for those big beers, this one hits 5.9% and isn't your average porter."
"Possibly my favorite beer from Stone. It it well-balanced and doesn't try to go over-the-top. The flavor at first seemed a bit unusual, but it really grew on me. Enjoyable; I'll get it again."
"I picked a bomber of this up at World Market in Western Hills over in Cincinnati. Right off the bat I noticed a smokey and chocolately aroma. It pours a nice head and the color is black/blood red. The taste is heavenly. I have always been a fan of stout but not so much porter. This has changed my mind. It is very smooth and surprisingly refreshing. This brew will certainly accompany my bbq this summer. Well done Stone Brewing Company, well done."
"Fantastic beer!"
"Drinkability: This, like many of my favorite porters, scores high on my drinkability scale for three reasons: great roasted flavor, light body and low acohol."
"I've had one bad experience with a smoked porter ( can't remember what or when), but ever since I've avoided anything smoked until I finally tried this porter. Apperance of dark chocolate with a thick head. Aroma of smoke, sweet coffee and roasted malts. If I were to pour a packet of hot cocoa mix into coffee and add a dash of smoke, this is the taste I percieved. Medium in body, overall not what I expected from this porter, where expectation was low, final outcome was quite exellent."
"D: Unbalanced towards the bitter. Decent drinkability but I found it to be less satisfying than I had hoped."
"Drinkability: I was a little concerned about the age on this bottle given the ABV but it drank wonderfully"
"I expected more in general from this beer (more intensity, more complexity and more body). Overall, this was a disappointment."
"Overall - Suprisingly good, at least from my perspective. I thought this would be a try my luck beer, but I'm sure I'll be buying more of this."
"If this were available in Texas, I'd be all over it on a regular basis. Just as the bottle states, this goes great with some blackberry preserves."
"Stone Smoked Porter pours a very dark brown with only the slightest hint of ruby around the edges, and a tan head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. I mostly smell chocolate malt and a hint of coffee. There is a thick mouthfeel that is appropriate for the style. Coffee and chocolate flavors are quite noticeable, the smoke only comes into play in the finish. I like this one quite a bit, I wish it were regularly available here. Highly recommended."
"In my opinion this is damn near the perfect porter. Will definately be getting more."
"Drinkability/Overall: a tasty porter with a smokey richness adding depth and character. A little tame for Stone, but a solid representation of the style as is their IPA. Can't wait til they're distributed here this summer."
"Drinkability - A highly drinkable porter. Very classic flavors with a bit of a twist with the smoke and hops. Despite its richness, it could be possible to make a session of this on a cold winter day."
"This porter pours a nice near black dark brown. A good tan head with some decent retention. The smell is bit smoky, with some nice hops and malt. The taste is coffee, chocolate and a bit earthy. Good carbonation and it goes does well. Quite drinkable and quite filling."
"Drinkability is good. I personally dont enjoy the level of sweetness, but it is respectable. I would prefer more ABV, and maybe something fuller with more personality. I would rather have a Smuttynose Robust Porter of this Smoked Porter."
"poured from a 22 oz. bottle leaving a two finger tan head which holds well and good lacing to the finish. smell is smokey or burnt caramel or coffee. taste is very sweet with same caramel, coffee, smokey burnt flaver. mouthfeel light, good carbonation. this is my first try with this style beer. i don't know if i like it or not but i will give it another try."
"Friday night at home, watching a movie. Had this beer, as well as porters from Sierra Nevada and Smuttynose. Liked this one a lot. It was a dark brown with a little red. A small tan head. Sweet chocolate aroma, maybe some smokiness. A chocolate, coffee taste, without the sweetness I had smelled. More of an espresso. Very smooth, and fun to drink."
"There are certainly more drinkable porters out there. This is more of an occasion beer. Overall, this is a stellar effort from Stone. For a moderately aggressive smoked porter, the balance is remarkable. The smoke adds to the beer in a subtle but meaningful way. This could make a great pairing with meats and cheeses. Stone Smoked Porter is officially on my radar as one of the top American porters."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle. I bought this in Oregon and took it back with me to Florida because they don't distribute Stone brews in my area. I'm a huge fan of Arrogant Bastard, so I thought I'd pick this up to give it a try. It pours with a 2 finger head that quickly goes away and leaves some moderate lacing. Appearance is a dark dark amber, very close to being black, the way a Porter should look. Not too much on the nose, or maybe my sense of smell is just dead tonight, but I can't really smell anything notable. Taste: aww yes, this is a good porter. Lots of rich bitter chocolate and coffee flavors with a nice smokey after taste, a little bit of sweetness there too once it's left to linger on your tongue. I've had other beers with ""Smoke"" in the title and the smokieness often overwhelmed the rest of the tastes, not the case with this beer. This one feels a little acidic as far as mouthfeel, and it's not as smooth as I hoped, but certainly not anything that's going to keep me from enjoying it, but it doesn't go down as easily as I hoped, but that's probably good because it'll keep me from drinking the one bottle I have too quickly."
"I'd give this second place in the porter department only to Sam Smith's Taddy Porter. Though it may be different in style, it is still extremely well done and absolutely worth seeking out if you're into porters."
"This is the first beer I have had from Stone and its pretty damn good! It has a reddish black hue with a nice big head that fades a bit. I thought the smell was a bit lacking though, I expected more smokiness to come through. This beer has wonderful flavors: dark chocolate, burnt coffee, plenty of roasted malts, and a slight smokiness...which once again I was preparing myself for more of a pronouced smoke flavor but still do enjoy it. This has a pretty good mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation. This beer is very drinkable and would love to pair it with food. Wish Stone would start to distribute in Iowa and even Minnesota. Awesome beer, Stone Rocks!!!"
"Poured into an Affligem chalice. Midnight black pour with a good head. Smell is of chocolate and a wisp of smoke. Taste is bang on- roasty sweetness with just the right amount of smoke. The smoke is not overpowering at all. Appropriate carbonation for the style and very drinkable. Hop presence is quite muted, at least for by Stone standards. This must be their least hopped style. A great porter in my mind."
"Holy shit, What a beer. Great head with amazing retention. Great malty smell. Nice smoky flavor with nice chocolate malting with balancing bitterness. Clings fairly well to the mouth and is incredibly drinkable. Malts could feel thicker on the palate. Stone brews are awesome and big and flavorful, but the seem to not get it done in the mouthfeel as well to me. One of the best stone beers I've ever had. Quite a brew. I highly reccomend it."
"The smoke is wonderful here. I could see drinking this with anything smoked like turkey or ham. Good stuff."
"Pored a dark brown/black that let just the slightest light through. Small cream colored head gave was quickly leaving just a bit around the edge till the bottom. Smell was total caramel chocolate malts. A hint of a spiceness as well. Taste was very nice, the nice malts come through beutifully and the mouthfell is almost perfect, goes down very smooth and has a very nice, long lingering almost hopped back. This is a very nice brew, I would love to try this on tap one day!"
"D: This is a good and balanced smoked porter. Not too smoky and not too bitter...but also not too sweet."
"Looks nice, almost black. Smells fine but not a lot of aroma. Tastes pretty good but an off aftertaste. Not real rich overall. Little thin on the mouthfeel side maybe. Drinkability fine overall. Nothing striking here. Decent but no one thing stands out other than the dark appearance."
"Notes: This particular sample was aged for at least 3 months in my cellar, and who knows how long it was brewed before I got to it. I would imagine that it would only be just as good in a fresher form. Hell, it's probably damn good aged too. Guess I'll have to see for my self and buy a case to experiment with!"
"The taste is round with a nice bitter coffee flavor. Toward the finish this makes my tongue and mouth begin to water and after that a nice blend of subtle toffee, coffee bitterness. I honestly feel this would be excellent with barbecue just like mentioned on the bottle. I mean I can imagine this being great with quite a lot of food. Next time I can get a hold of this for dinner, or as suggested PBJ sandwich I shall. Absolutely worth having around and if your eating even better."
"Thick and full-bodied. Lingers like a black coffee. Smooths out as it warms up. Surprisingly smooth considering how thick it is. Nice coffee thickness/taste. Nice brew."
"Maybe a bit too much smoke for me to down a sixer but definitely an original, eclectic masterpiece from one of the world's finest breweries. Definitely a classic for any beer lover's checklist."
"Could be sessionable, especially at this time of year. I like this but the smoked quality is pretty much non existent. So, a bit misleading, but a very nice porter."
"I really like porters and stouts. But unlike most Stone brews, I have to say this one is not the best in its class. It is a solid offering from Stone, but, in my opinion, nothing really special. It pours a big, dark tan, bubbly head. The color is black coffee. The head is not long lasting, but leaves a creamy lacing all the way down the glass. Surprisingly there isn't much aroma to speak of. Maybe I served it too cold? The mouthfeel is lighter than I like for a porter or stout. Flavor is roasty, smokey, almost burnt up front, hollow in the middle, and finishes with a bit of a sour kick. The stouts I prefer (e.g., Pizza Port's Old Viscosity and AleSmith's Speedway) have more alcohol than this, too. This beer is somewhat comparable to Guinness. Though I do prefer it to Guinness. It is not as creamy as Guinness--in fact the carbonation is a bit much for a porter, I think. The flavor is better and more complex than Guinness in my opinion. Overall a very decent beer, but not my favorite porter and certainly not my favorite from Stone."
"d/overall -- coming in a bomber, and being a bit more potent than the average porter, this might not be something that you drink multiples of at one time. i drank this on a night when i was already tired, and i wasn't aware of the ABV, and it put me right to sleep (pleasantly, i might add). that said, this is a highly enjoyable beer, and i will definitely make this a regular."
"Overall an amazing beer. Smoked beers are not typically my thing but this beer pretty much does it how I'd like. Stone certainly did not disappoint with this one. I'll definitely be buying this again."
"Drinkability is good, a bomber is just about the right size."
"Very drinkable for the style. The flavors are long lasting but not overpowering."
"Pours a dark black pitch color very tough to see any light penetrating this beer. Some subtle ruby hues peek thru around the edges when back lit. Nice fluffy tanish off-white head with decent retention. Smells of roasted malt and some mild alcohol hints. Smells like a big malted porter. I was rather disappointed by the lack of smoky flavor. I was looking for more of a smoked and roasted mouth feel. There are hints of the roasted malt and mild hints of smoke but not to the extent I would have liked. Very full bodied with a nice mild touch of hop in the aftertaste. There certainly is a decent mix of flavors throughout the whole brew. Subtle hint of chocolate. Well not everyone will agree on some things but this one was a bit disappointing for me. All there other offerings have been quite delectable but to each there own. Maybe I will give this one another go later this month. It is tasty and drinkable and matches well with pretty much any food. Pumpkin pie and some Thanksgiving treats were my paired foods. Decent porter but not my favorite."
"22 oz. bottle  dark brown / black in color  nice off-white head- nose of cappuccino , anis , dark chocolate , dark fruit ( cherries , and raspberries ) , malt , smoke , slight peat and iodine  taste of malts , caramel , milk , chocolate , coffee , anis , and a slight sourness  wonderful body creamy with a hint of acidity  aftertaste is milk chocolate and coffee"
"Creamy and smooth, medium bodied. This brew does not succumb to too much water or carbonation. Well-brewed and solid, thoroughly enjoyed this one."
"Drinkability- this is a great porter. Anybody who has moved beyond American lagers should try this beer."
"This is a very drinkable porter. It's not as dry and smokey as I thought it would be. I think is a good, but fairly typical, porter. I would have it again for sure."
"Poured from a bomber a rich deep redish brown with an inch of foamy tan head. I'm getting scents of dark chocolate and caramel malt followed by a nearby campfire. Tastes of chocolate and coffee, mild smoke and well balanced with malt. Finishes slightly bitter as the smoke lingers on. One of my all time favorite porters. Very satisfying offering from Stone. I can see myself enjoying a few of these on a chilly fall camping trip to compliment some smokey, grilled meats cooked over the campfire."
"Pours an inky black with a thin mocha head. When you hold it to the light it has red hues. The smell is great and well balanced. It is driven by the smoke, but sweet, maybe chocolaty notes. The taste is just as good, well balanced, starts smoky and sweet with a strong porter finish. The aftertaste sticks with the smoke theme but is also strong with malts. The mouthfeel is great, a good balance of flavor, carbonation, and body. I could drink these all night long. This is one of my favorite beers. Such a great brew. Do yourself a favor and pick up one of these. Enjoy!"
"Not bad at all. Reminds me of summer camping in a bottle."
"D - I wish I had a self replenishing supply in my refrigerator. Unfortunately Stone doesnt distribute in MO."
"This is an incredibly drinkable beer, even though it's quite heavy. Despite it being almost 70 degrees in New York yesterday, having one of these puts you in the perfect mood to bring on winter. Highly reccomended."
"Id highly recommend, I liked this a lot and will certainly pick more up in the future."
"The mouth feel was light with out too much carbonation and the beer goes down well. Perhaps a bit a on the heavy side but during a cold winter day I could certainly drink a couple of these. Try it out. Another good beer from Stone for sure."
"This stuff is outstanding! Smell is, well, okay, but other than that, this is a super brew that should be sold in 6 packs. Smokey smell, sweet esthers, awesome head that leaves lacing all the way down the glass. Great drinkability, as it isn't too strong. The smell is too whiskyish, but tastes nothing like that. Has a nice robust coffee/chocolate flavor charged with a little beefy smoke. Nice brewski!"
"Slainte!"
"Overall, the beer looks great, smells good, and the taste is balanced to perfection and intensely complex on all its duration. Makes my neurons pop. Minor points off for slight lack of sweetness and weakness of aroma."
"Mouthfeel- A little thick, but does bring an overall pleasing sense to the tongue. Great palate of bitter brownies."
"drinkability: good"
"D: Very drinkable with a very hidden alcohol level. I will be buying more of these and enjoying them more often."
"Deepest oxblood. Cascading tall head of small and medium espresso crema colored bubbles that quickly fades to a thick skim and a pillared collar. Splotches of chunky lace cling to the glass. No carbonation streams. Aromas of light smoke, sweet chocolate, and grape jelly rise. Modest smoke flavors meld with some bittersweet chocolate and a nice hop driven bitterness in the finish. The smoke fades into the background behind the chocolate notes while the finish lingers with a hoppy smokiness. Bittersweet to semi-sweet chocolate fills the medium body. Active carbonation adds a slight sandpaper feel. Easily drinkable, and I would like to see the smoked bumped up. This was a decent, but lightly smoked porter."
"Overall, this porter rocks. Unlike alot of American Porters I love the smoke element Stone adds to this brew. It adds alot of character and bold flavors. I highly recommend this brew, you could easily become addicted to this brew. I am. Happy Drinking"
"Another winner from Stone. Seriously, can they do any wrong? An extremely tasty brew with great drinkability, this one has everything going for it. Highly recommended."
"Very nice beer, well worth seeking out."
"Cheers!"
"Overall a solid beer, though not one that burns down the house. However, I would drink it again without any arm twisting."
"Poured from a slightly chilled 22 oz. bottle into a Ename chalice, the Smoked Porter was midnight black with a thin tan head which left only slight lace. This was my first smoked beer, and although I have heard good things, I was a bit skeptical. Furthermore, I should say that I'm generally not a big fan of Porters. The aroma was extremely sweet, with flavors of caramel and malt but no smoke, and was not very appealing to me. The taste however was much more balanced and a pleasant surprise. It was a bit sweet, but not nearly as much as the aroma would lead you to believe. There was a definite smoky taste, that if anything was more subtle then overwhelming. The main story here was the richness of the malt, which the smoke did a fine job of balancing out, making this porter much more enjoyable to me then they normally are. However, there was a fairly strong alcohol taste for only 5.9% ABV. The mouthfeel was rich and a bit syrupy from all the malt, but the balance provided by the smoke made this a drinkable porter worth checking out."
"Drinkability: Had this with a plate of a sausage/potato medly my girlfriend made for me because she loves me. It was a great match. The time of year where I can enjoy beers like this has arrived, and I say it's about time."
"I really do like this beer and I will drink it again. But I want more character in a smoked beer and in a porter. For Stone, makers of so many big and tasty beers, this seems tame and not ballsy enough in the flavors."
"Pours very dark brown. fluffy tan head, with decent retention,and some lacing.Smell is of roasted malts, with some hops in the mix. Body is light to medium. Not much carbionation. Taste is smooth, and rich. Smokey, with some well balanced mix of malts and hops. Nice sharp finish. Good stuff!!"
"Nice dark color with tight thick head. Sublte smokey aroma with a smooth balanced malty flavor. A great find on tap, very drinkable. Stopped in after GABF Saturday session, I hope it's still on after the weekend festivities."
"Drinkability: Although it wasn't the best porter I've had, or close to it, it wasn't bad. However, with all the better options in the world, I will probably never have this again."
"Drinkability: Good."
"Very dark brown, almost black color with a thin head. A very roasted chocolate/caramel maltiness dominates the smell. Tastes smokey to start, but the longer it sits on your tongue, the more chocolate malt is detected. Goes down on the thick side, and a great smokey aftertaste is your reward. I definitely plan on saving the rest of the case for my winter beer."
"D- Nice beer to just hang out and chat with. Not outragously strong, not wimpy. Good for relaxation and a little warmth in these western new york fall months."
"An extremely drinkable porter. The complex flavors meld together wonderfully."
"D - Another delicious offering from Stone. A highly sessionable porter that's got body and character that will keep it interesting all night long. Well done!"
"The mouthfeel is a bit dull due to lack of carbonation or thickness, and drinkability is kind of low due to the dark, smoky charateristics, and the dryness. In all fairness, it is still quite warm outside and I may just not be in the mood for this on such a warm night. At any rate, this just tastes very similar to Rogue Shakespeare but without the nuance."
"D: I am not a huge fan of smoked beers, but this one is alright (but nowhere near my favorite stone brews)."
"This beer pours a dark deep brown color with a dark cream colored head. The smell is very much like roasted coffee. This beer is full and rich with a smoky roasted taste. Flavors of coffee and chocolate blended with the roasted malts bring out a lot of taste in the beer. The beer is heavy and deep with a nice strong after taste. This is a great porter if you like your porters strong. I also love it as a marinade for stakes. It has a great taste and adds a great flavor to the meat. Just make sure you save some for drinking."
"Very drinkable. I'd try it with smoked salmon or salty fish; anchovies or some sardines."
"This beer pours a jet black with a giant foamy head. A real nice looking beer. The smell is pretty strong with smoke, malt,dark fruit, and a sweet coffee. The taste is a creamy chocolate,coffee, oak wood smoke, and alittle dark fruit. This is a very refreshing porter with the m/f being light/medium with all the flavors mixing very well. An excellant beer, one of the best porters I've had in a while."
"Poured dark brownish color with a slight reddish hue to it and a nice light tan head that left beautiful lacing on the glass. Aroma of hops, smoke, chocolate, and roasted malt. Smoked taste, followed by coffee, hops, and roasted malt. I wish I rated this earlier."
"Beer has a very robust malty backbone, with that perfect balance of smoke and deep dark roasted flavors. Often I try smoked beers that go overboard with ths smoking... not here. The balance is excellent. There is also enough hops there to make me happy, but they certainly are secondary."
"Really nice looking brew. Nearly opaque but with some brown fringes. Lots of tan head, thick lacing. Light aroma though. Sweet milk chocolate exclusively. The taste is a step in the right direction though. Light smokiness initially then bittersweet chocolate. Slight sweetness in the middle. Finish has a nice roasted bitterness. A touch of earthy hops. Okay mouthfeel. A bit thin, coats well and the flavor lingers though. Good drinkability overall. A nice beer with some nice smokiness and a good overall flavor. Goes down easy."
"Smooth and very drinkable."
"Pours dark brown, tan head. Smell is malts, fruit , a little hops and a little smoke. Taste is carmel, a little roastiness with a smoky background; balanced with hop bitterness. Creamy mouthfeel. This is a tasty beer, but I do wish the smokiness was a little more prominant. Overall though, this is worth picking up."
"Very light, even while knowing its ABV. Still, makes it quite drinkable. A nice beer for sessions, although on the strong side."
"Don't expect a rauchbier here, it has a subtle smokyness that compliments the toffee maltiness of this porter. This is a good thing, as I personally can only drink one rauchbier at a time, while Stone makes this a beer to enjoy for a few rounds. My first review, how exciting."
"This may not be Stone's most popular brew, but it's one of it's best. Highly reccomended."
"D - Very drinkable. An awesome brew from Stone, a classic to the style. Highly recommended."
"Pours a rubied deep brown that is impressive in it's thick creamy foamed head of a light molases color, and it holds for a while. Smells of sweet malts, very light alcohol underneath, with hops smelling grassy and gentle in a british way, but also blended with that northwestern american hops aroma. A subtle dopple like sweetness in the aroma as well. This smells like a lot is going on in a good way, and it's already not what I was expecting. Expecting a hop bomb of an ultra smoky porter... Here goes...tastes mostly brown actually; the smoke it faint and in the finish. Charred malt peaks through past the smoke and there is only a little bit of that to add complexity but not offend. The taste is classic dark brown/light porter with a few twists to give it complexity. It's balanced in hops actually. More comprable to jinx than I expected! Mainly just a note darker and a tad less smoky. I can see this as a porter, but it seems to have a lot in common with a medium bodied brown ale apart from the color. I like both browns and porters, and so it was more of a surprise expecting a near-stout kind of porter. A tasty, english style, balanced-flavored brew! Mouthfeel is medium with not intrusive carbonation ,in a really good way; very solid, which contributes to being one of the most excellent, easy drinking, sessionable beers I've had in a long time, and the 22oz split with a friend went down far quicker and more easily than I imagined! Drink this!"
"Eric"
"It was enjoyable, as a porter. I found the smoke to be a little understated."
"D- after-dinner, one per session. not my type of porter (i would rather have one i can drink as an appetizer or with steak, instead of dessert) but for its style this is very well-crafted and thought out."
"Drinkabilty- Wish I could tell what the taste is (found out it is probably coffee), tastes familiar. Its better the more I drank. This did make me want to try more porters. Was kind of glad when it was over"
"Overall: This is an excellent flavorful porter. The smoky flavor is noticable, but not overpowering."
"D - Very, very good."
"Another highly enjoyable beer Stone. Glad to finally have you here."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with mild carbonation that makes the smokiness more tolerable and enjoyable like a delicate digestif."
"This is a nice porter with a little bonus with the smoke. The smoke and malty sweetness interplay nicely."
"I'd be interested in seeing if they ever put the chipotle version of this beer in bottles. I tried it at the San Diego Real Ale Fest last weekend, and it was an interesting variation on this one--not quite as refreshing, but definitely more interesting."
"Wow am I glad I bought this. Like all stone products, this beer looked awesome. The head wasn't as menacing as, say, Arrogant Bastard, but it left an excellent lace nonetheless. The back of the bottle sums it up nicely...""Amazingly rich, dark, and delicious..."""
"-Oelergud"
"Thick chewy somewhat smokey mouthfeel. A little more RS may up the drinkability."
"D: Very drinkable. With a medium ABV it leaves me feel like I want more and knowing I could have more and be fine with out risking the influences of the alcohol."
"Maybe not as wild and unique as we expect from this brewery, but who cares, it's an excellent offering, one of the most complex and well-rounded porters you'll find."
"D - flavorwise, I wouldn't mind having this beer everyday, it's that tasty. To me, this is what a strong porter should taste like. Not getting a lot of smoke from this smoked porter, but that is fine with me. The body of this beer would make it difficult to have more than a couple in a sitting. Easily my favorite beer from Stone."
"Dark brown with red accents. Creamy tan head holds well and tastes delicious to boot. Light roasted malt aroma, some coffee, and a touch of smoke. Tastes surprisingly chocolate-y, while the usual coffee flavors coming out fairly strong also. This porter doesn't overplay the smokiness like so many smoked beers do...instead it seems to add a smoke element to an already great porter. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, but it remains quite drinkable even at room temp. Overall, a very good brew from Stone."
"As usual Stone brews a good beer...this one pours a heavy brown to black w/good a rich creamy head. Smells heavy of coffee and roasted smoky notes. Some nutty notes as well. Tastes strong of coffee and chocolate but somewhat watery. Becomes even better when its closes in to room temperature. Mouthfeel is watery with some bitterness. Overall and excellent porter and is what I have come to expect from Stone."
"Slight coffee smell. Taste is a nice light porter, with a mild smokey flavor. The aftertaste is like coffee almost, the bitterness present is very light."
"Top notch beer, without a doubt. The one little slip in the taste is the only thing that I would change if I could. Huge thanks to orrshow, as he gave me this bottle from the stash his parents brough in from Vegas."
"The Stone Smoked Porter pours a very dark brown, with about a 1/2 inch head. It smells mostly like coffee, chocolate and malt, with a slight smoky smell. Very nice. It has a stronger smoky taste to it, along with it tasting like chocolate and roasted malt. There's also a slight bitter coffee-like aftertaste, which is good. It's very full flavored overall. The mouthfeel is thin, and it goes down pretty smooth with not much carbonation at all. I'm very partial towards dark beers anyway, and I would place this one close to the top of the ones I've tried. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Cheers!"
"Glad I had a chance to try this. It is a very good beer and if I can get my hands on it again I will. Being my first beer from Stone it makes me very anxious to try more of their products."
"D: Smell was nice, however the taste didn't do much for me really. Never been a fan of dark chocolate and there were a lot of the same flavors in this beer as are in dark chocolate. I've had better porters, but overall not too bad, something different than the norm."
"Bloody brown with a thick but fizzy tan foam cap. Aromas of chocolate and black malts; some earthy/floral hops make a showing as well. Toasted cocoa and chocolate cake batter up front in the taste with an earthy compost-like hop flavor following. Sharp mineral twinge at the finish. Smoke flavor does not emerge until late in the aftertaste. On a second sip, however, it seems that a foretaste of the smoke is detectable in between the sweetness of the cocoa-inspired malts and the bitter hops. Okay, no, as the beer warms, the smoked flavor really does emerge, but not too strongly -- it permeates most of the sip, but only in a gentle, ""Hey, I'm a smoked porter, remember?"" sort of way. Medium body and silky mouthfeel overall. Without a doubt, one of the top American porters. Matched nicely with smoked gouda on pumpernickel. ""Enjoy by 1 05 05."" Whoops. Held up pretty damn well for sitting on a shelf for a year past its drink-by date."
"Tried it on a train. Yes, Santa Fe Railroad, travelling from San Diego to LA. Everyone who's planning to hit this railroad must take into consideration that chouce of beers is simply wonderful. Well, I loved it - strong and potent, with smoky aroma, coffeish taste and great black color. I agree that the taste could be even greater, but on a hot sunny day it was already larger-than-life.

"Overall this is a very easy, tasty, uncomplicated beer to drink. Complexity would probably take away from it. Well done."
"A truly excellent porter, one that will at least cause me to pause before automatically reaching for Anchor's. The aroma immediately said ""Stone", with a sweet spicy (mango chutney?) melody harmoniously laid on top of a classic roasted-coffee porter background, and a strong hint of smoke. It pours beautifully dark and clear, with a nice creamy head which subsides quickly into a drinkable thin film. Even though served quite warm, the flavor and mouthfeel didn't quite live up to what my eyes and nose had promised--I prefer porters that pack just a little bit more sweet, roasted maltiness--but it was still quite good, with the smoke flavor again perfectly balanced. And it all finished very clean, making this one very drinkable porter."
"This is a very good beer! IMO, it's not the best offering from Stone, but certainly a good, slightly different (but in a good way) porter, and worth the price!"
"Finally tried this beast for graduation. Poured into a glass forming a thick, 1 1/2-2 inch head. Appearance was black, red around the sides. Head dissipates within a minute or two, leaving very little lacing. Smells of smoke, raisin, coffee and hops. Tastes very ""hoppy", but nice. Goes down smoothly, though it is a very ""thin"" beer as far as dark beers go. The light feel allows it to go down smooth, and it is very satisfying. One of the better porters I have had, but I still think that if you like a full flavored dark beer, a stout is the way to go."
"Give me a few more of these, and I would love to see it on tap sometime. Stone's Smoked Porter is an excellent beer to enjoy as it warms, and even though the weather today proved to be hotter than I would have chosen, this beer still proves to be refreshing."
"Not nearnly as good as Alaskan Smoked Porter, but still, I could certainly have a couple glasses."
"Absolutely amazing!!! This is everything I was hoping it would be and more!!. Black liquid with a khaki coloured, creamy head. Tiny carbonation bubbles cling to the side of my glass. Looked magnificent. The smell was incredible!! I have had a handful of things before with smoke in the title, only to be terribly disappointed to discover no smoke in either the smell or the taste. This had plenty of smoke, however, but just enough. I also got a little bit of a bready smell and some chocolate hiding in the back. Positively one of the best smelling beers I have had in a long time. The taste matched the smell with a nice ""meaty"" malt right up front and plenty of smoke. A small amount of caramel and burnt coffee make appearances toward the finish. Mouthfeel is very smooth with a fantastic level of carbonation. This beer is just amazing. I am thoroughly impressed, and sadened that this is not available in Ga."
"Nice and dark. Not quite stout dark, but close. Thick, fizzy, carbonated head. Roasty, smokey smell that tastes the same. Very rich malty flavor. This is almost more like a stout than a porter. Pretty drinkable. Maybe not in my favorite of all time list, but one of the good ones."
"Same in the aftertaste (cocoa, smoked), and a noticeable bitterness, quite long, with rhubarb hints."
"Full bodied with a smooth, lofty mouthfeel and a pleasant ABV make this a Porter lover's ""must try"". It's unique and goes down smoothly...cheers!"
"Final Thought: This is a creative brew by one of the world's best, this one is on the annual rotation, thank you Stone."
"There was no light getting through this beer, very dark black with a small tan head. The smell has dark chocolate and a very smoky hickory wood aroma with a hint of alcohol getting through. I really enjoy the taste. The smokiness reminds me of Laphroig scotch, like you are drinking smoked peat moss but this is dipped in dark chocolate. The mouth feel is velvety smooth with low carbonation and the flavors get more intense as it warms up. This is an over the top porter."
"Poured into a 22oz. mug, a dark brown opaque color with hints of red. A light brown head forms, that laces slowly down the mug. Smoky, chocolate, and coffee aromas come through witha touch of spicy hoppiness at teh end of each scent. The taste is very, very, very good. The sweet taste of chocolate, with hints of coffee, then followed by the smoky flavor that finishes each taste. In the mouth it starts medium bodied, but it becomes fuller towards the back of the palate. This an excellent beer, a nice beer to just sit down and relax with and just sip."
"D- If I could get this beer on a regular basis I could drink it almost every day. So overall I would say a very good session beer."
"Pours a very dark brown with a nice cocoa-like head. A sweet smelling beer that tends to be too sweet, and a bit of roastiness that is expected in this type of beer. I didn't detect much smokiness, which I was looking forward to. There was also a lack of smoke in the flavor as well. Some light bitterness and roasted malt was present. Mouthfeel was medium, but not much. I could maybe settle for 12 ounces instead of 22. The bomber was a bit much. I was disappointed by the lack of smoke flavor and the sweetness. But all in all, it is still a good beer in smaller doses. Probably my least favorite from Stone."
"Drinkability: Honest, I really want to find a Stone beer that I like so I can write really nice things about it, if only to give the impression that I'm not a blanket Stone hata. But the sad truth is (so far, anyway), that for my palate, their beers lack balance. That lack of balance seriously affects the drinkability in my opinion, and this beer is no exception to that rule. It is not a bad beer by any stretch of the imagination, but not one that I will probably seek out again."
"The best smoked beer I have ever had the opportunity of trying. Very dark brown body, medium tan head. Smell is lightly smokey, but only lightly, with cocoa and coffee. The smoke is also done correctly in the flavor, not overpowering, but evident, maybe the first smoked beer I have ever enjoyed. Well balanced, good one Stone."
"very tasty, and the price is right. For a porter though I might go somewhere else... and also if I really want more smoke flavor I would definitely go somewhere else. But like most stone products this is plain solidly made in all the categories that count... personally it doesn't ""wow"" me however, although I enjoy it quite alot."
"Opaque black color, no light can pass. A nice one finger thick, creamy tan head, that fades leaving a thin white line around the glass. Some clingy lacing remains. Lots of milky, mocha smells, with a just a hint of smokiness. Some roasted malt comes through in the background. Well balanced taste, semi sweet, ending with some smoky bitterness. More smoky characteristics come through as the beer warms. Decent carbonation, with a medium body feel. A very enjoyable porter, and another great offering from Stone."
"D - The smokiness and sheer complexity of all the flavors melding in this one makes you want more. Would also pair with many types of food, be it smoky grilled meats all the way to sweet deserts. Also great to sit and drink by itself after a long day."
"How the hell could anyone give this less than a 4.0 is beyond me...."
"Drinkabitly is very good , I imagine this pairs with alot of food. <uhmmm smoked samon>"
"-Cheers2Beers-"
"Deep Brown. Deep, malt driven aroma with a touch of smoked malts and a hint of chocolate, coffee, tar and dark fruits. Silky, sticky, coating and heavy body and feel on palate. An instant 5 on the palate. Big for its size. Notes of chocolate, coffee and wet pavement along with a very small amount of smoke. Tasty."
"The good news is that finally Stone is available in New Jersey,so I was eager to try this beer.The beer itself (22oz bottle) was a dark brown to black color,almost cola looking,with a small tan head that quickly dissappeared.The aromas were slight hints of chocolate and coffee.Those aromas were also in the taste as well as black licorice and you could definetly get the taste of smoke,especially in the nice finish.This is a very unique offering from Stone,but something you should surely check out."
"Very dark ruby-brown with a small, creamy, tan head with good retention. Smells of deep, dark roasted malts and a good amount of charcoal smoke. Smells like drinking a beer while standing outside at the grill. Also pleasant smells of caramel, molasses and chocolate. The flavor is more of the same except not as smoky until you get to the finish. Then the charcoal smokiness comes rushing back in with a vengeance. It has a medium body, lightly dry texture and soft carbonation. This beer went very well with grilled steak. A very easy drinking porter with enough character and smoke to keep it interesting without going overboard. Nicely done."
"This is a very, very nice porter and it's moderate alcohol content makes it perfect for a long night talking or reading in front of the fire."
"All in all a great beer from Stone, and my favorite porter to date."
"Overall this was one of my most favorite porters to date, if you like the style and want a ""big"" one, get this and enjoy."
"Dark brown color topped by a thin tan lace. The lace receded quickly, but left a nice lace on the side of the glass. The beer showed a nice carbonation. Very chocolaty aroma. A lot of roast malt, espresso and milk chocolate. A little fruit there too, maybe a little blackberry. Layers of flavor. I still get a lot of the chocolate, espresso. Its very sweet, but the sweetness is balanced by some fruit, mango, a bit of pear. The smokiness comes through midway through the drink. The finish really has balanced. Mild bitterness, the smoke, sweet malt all come together. The mouth feel is a touch thin, with just a bit of heat. Still a nice drinkability. Thanks to realale for this beer."
"Overall the key to this beer is it's mild character. This brew has excellent flavor and is very easy to drink. This is brew that I could drink often."
"Very drinkable, would make a great session porter."
"The body is full and there isn't much of a yeast aftertaste. This is a great porter that is unique and quite enjoyable to drink."
"Definitely among the upper rung of smoked porters, though perhaps not the pinnacle. It will be my beer to go to when I want some smokey flavor and a certain North Western seasonal is unavailable."
"As a side note, I've now had a few stone beers, and this is the first time that I think i can really recognize the yeast they use..."
"Black color, tan head. Almost no head retention and no lacing at all, I expected a little better on both points. Smell of roasted coffee, black licorice, smoked wood (of course), plums and cherries. The smoky flavor takes over the taste up front but then a coffeeness fills out the finish. This is probably due to the bitter hop bite at the end. Mouthfeel is pretty full as would be expected. Fills all the expectations for a porter with the added smoke flavors as a bonus. An all around solid beer that I could see going back to when I'm in the mood for a porter."
"Guess what? yep, its smokey in the nose. Not the charred burnt wood type but more of a salmon smoke house. Quality wood, no gas to speak of just bitter wood flavor. They brewed this perfectly, it still retains all of the porter qualities you would expect. Easily consumed, fairly light on the palate, all things considered. In true stone fashion it kicks up the hop profile. Hell Yeah! this is one fine brew and worthy of its praise."
"This is a very nice beer. It is full-bodied and full-flavored, but it is not over-the-top. The coffee roastiness is the dominant taste, but I also taste chocolate and (call me crazy) sublte fig. There is also a very mild smokiness to go along with it. This is a very drinable beer, and I am sure that it goes well with many meals."
"Bottle: Poured a medium-black color porter with a medium size foamy head with average retention. Aroma of slightly bitter hops with some very subtle smoke in there. Taste is also slightly bitter with a very subtle touch of smoke. I was honestly expecting a more smoky character because of the name of the beer. Also, I was expecting a hoppier porter based on previous tasting of Stone beers. A bit of letdown really."
"This is a beautiful beer that does everything that is asked of a Porter, but then with the proper companionship of a campfire. A bit more fruitiness could have helped with the depth and complexity of the beer. I'd like to see this beer imperialized."
"This is a good beer but far from my favorite from Stone."
"Another great brew from Stone, not a clinker in the lot."
"Pours a deep brown/red, medium tan head, pretty thick and spots of lace on the glass. Smell is malty, sweet cherries, very light smoke. Taste is roasted coffee, cherries, and light smoke, little bit of chocolate, quite malty. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with low carbonation. Smoke character is perfect, not overpowering and very complementary, thanks DrJay!"
"Finish is full, rich, albeit not particularly smoky at all. Great lingering harmonius finish. Just the bee's knees for a low ABV beer...sessionable."
"Perhaps due to all the big beers I've been exploring lately, this guy comes across as incredibly drinkable and smooth. The finish is a bit on the dry side, but merely encourages another follow-up swig. The smokiness is very pleasant, and makes me wonder what my comrade was thinking."
"D: It’s very easy to drink since it’s not too sweet, not too bitter and not very over-powering. However it is a bit filling, which is expected in the style. Overall this was a very good beer. Stone Brewing Co. does not disappoint. The beer represents the style well, while maintaining the brewery’s signature."
"Exceptionally smooth and drinkable."
"Poured a drank dark brown without light showing through any part of the glass. There was a delectable cafe au lait head that receded into a slick across the top of the beer with some large bubbles sticking to the side of the glass. The smell held very little smoke in it. It was much more full of robust chocolate notes with a hint of alcohol tickling the back of the nose. Just a tad sweet smokiness as I breathed deeply. The taste was the same with much more bitter chocolate notes without much smoke to push through. It was very full bodied and a wonderful porter, but not smokey enough for the style. Enjoy!"
"Has a great first impression. Pours thick and very sticky. Very dark brown and black in body but the nose doesnt pick up a whole lot. The lace is very soapy and thick. Great all around porter taste, leaves a very clean taste behind. The smoke didnt jump out at me right away but has built up towards the end. Excellent malt affect helps the beer go down smooth. Even though some look at it as a waste, it s great beer to cook with. I used this on ribs and it was stellar!"
"Overall not the best porter I've had, but this is my first smoked porter and I'm curious to try others. I'd love to drink this with some smoked pork ribs as I'm betting it'd be great with anything bbq'd."
"a rare look at stone's ability to make a balanced beer"
"Medium bodied, leaving a sugary goodness in your mouth as it goes down smooth and creamy. Well worth several, if they were even distributed around these parts."
"Pitch black with a decent sized head and thick sticky lacing. Nice heavy coffee and roasted malt smell. Slight smell of smoke but not nearly as much as I expected. Heavenly sweet taste with plenty of coffee and roasted malt. I'm disappointed in the lack of smoke flavor. Where is it? Wonderfully smooth mouthfeel. This feels good but misses a little on the smoked flavor. Disappointing in that respect but still great. Try this one but I don't know that I'll go out of my way to get it again. Thanks to BeerBeing for this tasty beer."
"This is a really delicious beer. The smoke is just enough to be noticed, and everything else is great. It's also a pretty beer."
"Overall: Another tasty brew from Stone, definitely a yummy porter."
"A very balanced porter. The smoke is maybe subtle plus a half notch. Malts and some hoppiness contribute nicely. A very easy drinking beer...and good thing since I had about 8 glasses of it before I finished the 22 oz. It went down slow and easy."
"Taste is more coffee centered and charcoaly, though there's still hints of chocolate- just deeper and harder to find. More smokyness, a hint of bitterness rounds it out. Mouthfeel is a tad watery and thin but otherwise creamy, not very bubbly. Very very drinkable- an easy beer to have several of and not even realize it. Just tasty and lovely. Another fabulous brew from Stone."
"Big and black, with a fat head and chunky lace. Hints of dark maroon around the edges. Not much nose to it, nearly unscented. Mild roasted malts, and subtle hints of smoke at the end. Suprisingly hopped. Thinnish, but smooth. A nice beer, a bit of a drink it and forget it beer though, the kind you would wander around with at a party and forget you were drinking it."
"tons of chocolate and coffee in the flavor. a hint of grassy hops and a touch of burnt wood as well, but not near the smoked character of the Alaskan. finishes with a hoppy and dark chocolate bitterness. medium-high carbonation with a medium mouthfeel."
"drinkability: a bomber is enough, but nice to spend some time sipping this down. A solid beer, but pretty simple, so I won't get this too often. Certainly worth the ocassionaly purchase."
"Taste was more subtle than other smoked porters; coffee was predominate, but not so much as to shock the taste buds. Some malt and chocolate. Little hoppiness. Cleaner finish than I expected."
"Over the last few weeks, I've had this at least once. Pretty damn good and drinkable."
"Drinkability- If you're in the mood for something different, this is your brew. The smoke flavor jumps out at you and doesn't let go. Very nice."
"Even though I usually prefer in-your-face, strong smokey flavor of a rauchbier, I still enjoy this porter very much. Its light to medium body makes it very drinkable, and its balance makes mouthfeel high. This one's definitely to try on tap and may be keep a bottle for when I am in the mood for porter."
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer overall. I would have liked a bit more smokeyness to the beer."
"Another bottle sampled at the first meeting of our South Bend Coalition of the Drinking club. We drank two from Stone, which were my first two ever from them. This one i was looking forward to because i've liked the smoked porter's i've had and because of the pedigree of the brewery. Poured out of the great looking bottle a dark black color. small bubbly head becomes creamy and smooth-looking. the whole thing looks fantastic. Odor is slightly smoky, but more like roasted malts. Also some wet oak log smell and molasses. Taste was smoky as all hell at first and then a hard malt bitterness and hints of chocolate. simple but great. i likey. Fairly thick and smooth in the mouth with a small bite on the tip and sides of the tongue. i could drink these all night and all day."
"Drinkable for a porter.... but not something I would have more than a couple of. All in all, certainly not my favourite brew of theirs.... though still good."
"This has a fairly thin mouthfeel in spite of how big this beer is for the porter style. I enjoyed this stone beer with a nice meal and think I will be picking up more of it."
"From a bottle. Strong coffee and roasty dark malt aroma. Pours dark black with a thin, but creamy, mocha head that is mostly lasting. Strong bitter coffee flavors in the fore. never really gets smoky like a Rauch. More of a mild peat influence than anything. Very porterish mouthfeel that belies how stout-thick it looks sitting in the glass."
"I only rated the drinkability down on this because I don't think I could drink more than one every once in a while, but when I am in the mood for a smoked porter, I will reach for this one first. Wow!"
"Very smooth for a smoked porter, drinks real easy. Initial big head that dissipitates. Understated smoke in aroma. Deep rich chocolate malt, roast flavour taste. Well malted and not overhopped. Satisfying medium to full mouthfeel. Good porter. On tap at Pizza Plant Transit."
"Drinkability - flavorful, but as a session beer it's not one I'd pick. I think I'd get it again though if I was hankering for a tasty smoker."
"Not bad at all, one of the better smoked porters Ive run into, although its not like there are million of them out there. But still, a very enjoyable brew from a brewery that has consistently managed to please. Recommended."
"more please."
"Smokiness is used for good effect on a good-great porter works well. But just not quite perfection. Works well as a stand-alone or with BBQ, cheese, or Heavier food, wouldn't rule it out for dessert."
"Drinkability: I didn't notice much smokiness in this, but I don't care. Overall this turned out to be a nice solid American Porter that I sure to buy again. Excellent Brew!"
"Got this in a big bottle, 22 oz., and was expecting something a bit different. Drank it in a frosted 12 oz. standard beer glass and maybe it was overall too cold. Body was rich and thick with a great thick head like a porter should be. Taste was very chocolately and malty without much smoke at all. Very easy drinking porter in a perfect size for sharing."
"Pardon me, but I don't smell or taste much in the way of ""smoke"" here. I read on Stone's web site that they use peet-smoked malts in the brewing process, but the effect is certainly very mild. Nevertheless, this is a very sold brew, one that hold up to the reputation of the Stone brand..."
"Poured an extremely dark-brown, virtually black color with impressive tannish puffy head. Smell is enjoyable, being a nice combination of chocolate, coffee, nuts with a nice smokiness bringing it all together. Taste is initially very good with strong coffee and chocolate notes mixing with the smokiness. A not enjoyable stong bitterness presents itself that overshadows all the other flavors. As the beer warms the bitterness becomes less and a nice balance forms. Good finish with the roastiness, smokiness, and bitterness blending well. A good beer."
"Drinkability is okay due to the light nature of this brew. Alcohol started to get boozy and intrusive as the beer warmed, leaving me feeling a bit queasy on the final sips, which wasn't helped by the rather overpowering taste of smoke."
"The smoked porter looks very dark black/brown with minimal head that forms a ring after a short while. The smell is mostly sweet, with a hint of chocolate, no smokiness to speak of. The taste is sweet, with a coffee accent, robust and toasty. Not overly smoky though, as the name would suggest. Its only mildly bitter at first, but give it some time. It feels thick on the tongue, smooth, and has a dryness to it. Good carbonation. Well balanced, it is a fine porter, but I feel the smokiness is too subtle for it to be named a Smoked Porter..."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Very easy, foamy consistency that showcases the chocolate and coffee notes rather than get in the way of them. This porter is aggressive yet very well balanced, daring and memorable. For that, I give Stone's brewers a highly earned salute."
"Interesting beer, this one. Nice super dark color with only hints of deep red glinting through when held up to the light, head ws nice and lacing was excellent. Aroma was very pleasing giving off roasted coffee, chocolate, malts and an earthy nutty tone, very complex. The taste is initially coffee and chocolate with malts then a hoppy bitterness followed by a smooth smoky flavor and a trailing bitterness at the end. I've never experieced smokiness in a beer before, but it's not bad. Overall a good drink...."
"Pours nearly black, ruby highlights appear when held up to a light source. Head was high and profound, receding with much lacing looking wonderful in the glass. Nose was burnt in essence, as one would expect it was very earthy, mellow, and malty with hints of cocoa powder more than chocolate. Taste was surprisingly subtle for a Stone beer, usually they are more in the ""knock your socks of syle"" but this one's greatness lies in the subtle suggestions of cocoa and earthy wood with a distinct spiciness in the finish. Smoking is not overwhelming but adds a unique flavor component which makes the beer more interesting than most. Mouthfeel is medium, goes down smoothly... big enough that after two, I would probably be pretty full but that is generally true to the style. overall another great beer from Stone, more subtle than most of their offerings yet just as profound."
"Overall a stellar porter which I regret not having tried much sooner. This beer has everything for me. This is a creamy (there's that adjective again!) version of an Edmund Fitzgerald and then some - utterly fantastic!"
"Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel - smooth and very drinkable. Another fine product from Stone Brewing"
"If I'm in a smoked porter mood, for awhile I'll stick to Brooklyn's."
"Pours dark mahogany with an initial mocha colored head, settling to a slick. Nose is not particularly smoky... more of a roasted element to it. Taste is very malty, well-roasted chicory flavors, chocolate and hops pushing their way throughout the mix. Actually this brew is quite bitter courtesy of mass-hopping. Medium in body, this brew has good weight to it and a persistent flavor profile. For a porter it is very concentrated and robust... chock-full of all things good and necessary in a brew of this style. The mouthfeel is lightly syrupy and slightly tannic, no doubt from the generous hopping of the brew. A very good though not monumental porter that the masses are sure to enjoy. (Are you sure it's only 5.9%.. ;-)"
"D: As it warms, the boldness steps forward. It's a big brew with plenty of flavour. The 650 mL bomber is plenty."
"This is an odd call. I love porters, but this one has me a bit confused, I would certainly drink it again, but would probably be more likely to take a chance on another porter. After you've had an Edmund Fitz, it seems like its all downhill..."
"This is a very attractive brew. Very dark, almost onyx black, but some hits of red with shown to light. ¾ inch head that looks like the coffee froth atop a well made espresso. The head settles as it should, particularly in the middle but leaves delicate lacing. Bidder sweet aroma with some charcoal notes. Starts with a sweet malt flavor, transitions into burnt brown sugar caramel flavor, and finishes smoky and dry. Slightly alcoholic. Soft yet big and a little bit chewy, a little bit sticky. Nice biter aftertaste and dry palate, alcoholic notes in the flavor do not compromise the drinkability."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1"" brown head above the clear, dark brown brew, with reddish highlights. Head lasts nicely, with delicate sticky lacing. Aroma is sweet, a bit boozy, with wisps of smoke here and again. Taste is vinous and sweet as well, with the smoke there, but shouted down by the syrupiness and alcohol notes. However, looking past the fact that I'd want more smoke, this was still a beer with a smooth mouthfeel, and good drinkability."
"Overall, I wasn't amazed with this beer. It's decent, but there's better available from Stone. I kind of wish I drank half of this and used the other half in a pot of chili. Mmmmm now THAT would have been delicious."
"Opaque black with a thick, foamy head that stays for quite a while. Aromas of roasted malts, raisins, and dry roasted coffee seem to arise. The taste is great with a robust character that ends with a crisp, dry aftertaste flavored by fruits. The roasted taste is subtle and not overpowering in the least, as I expected since Stone is known for going over the top. More flavors and aromas become apparent as the beer warms adding new dimensions to the beer."
"Mouthfeel was slightly thin, but not disappointing. I would love to have this again sometime."
"Where's the smoke. Warning this is not a smoked porter, more like a sweet malty oak porter. I has a great thin black body with a good off-white head. But the smell is of a sweet porter or stout, no smoke. Mostly just a good porter but mostly just blah for a smoked porter. Smoke, I think not hence the taste suffers, just call it a porter and let it ride."
"I dunno... I just hoped for something a little more complex or ""deeper"" overall. This was still a great porter, but only slightly above the other better smoked porters I've had. It didn't blow away the competition like I thought it would."
"This stuff is remarkably smooth. The smoked flavor keeps it interesting, but it lowers drinkability ever so slightly. I don't think I could drink more than a bomber in a night and it's not something I'm going to crave all the time, but it sure can hit the spot"
"A difficult beer for me to rate. If I were to rate it just by its porter characteristics (creamy body, subtle roastiness, beautiful coffee, chocolate, hops interplay) it would be over a 4 overall. However, the smoke quality, as subtle as it is, really spoiled it for me. I like smoked beers, and can appreciate using it as an ""element"" rather than the dominating factor, but the smoke in this beer tasted more like ash. This is still a GOOD beer and its very close to GREAT, but that final failing it very frustrating indeed!"
"Hopefully Stone will either step up the distro, or another friend will make a trip to Cali. If this was available in GA I'd def drink it regularly. Still got the arrogant on in the fridge, hopefully it won't dissapoint."
"Pours a dark almost black color with a nice tan head that has good retention and leaves wonderful lacing. Chocolate and burnt malt aroma with a hint of roastyness and bitter coffee. Same flavors intermingle with a smokey flavor. Quite velvety smooth on the palate and very drinkable. Love this beer in the winter sitting near a fire."
"I am fully impressed, this is probably one of my favorites thus far. If these were cheaper or available in a 6 pack, I would drink them religiously."
"Thanks to Px2GrafX for the bottle."
"The mouthfeel is thin and smooth. The finish is quite wet and leaves some nice residual sugars which meld well with the smokiness. This is a good drinkable porter, but I think a single bomber is all I could ask for. Thanks for the memories, Stone."
"Drinkability is high this is so smooth I could defiantly have another."
"With the upcoming change in the weather I've found myself revisiting some brews I haven't had in a long time. Definately wasn't in the mood for a porter all summer that I can remember, and I don't think I've had the Stone since my first days of beeradvocacy. Definately a great beer. Dark brown, but not opaque, with a hefty brown head on there. Nice and bubbly. Smell and taste are loaded with complex chocolaty coffee notes and a nice smoke character that really separates this beer from others in the style. Really nice. Definately much hoppier than I expected as well, with a really killer bitterness not usually found in porters. I really liked that part of the beer, and it gave it a nice dry mouthfeel, which is also strange for a porter. Definately something I'll be keeping warm with this fall and winter."
"Pours deep brown with ruby highlights. Dark, but fairly clear. A tan, three finger head remains thick and creamy for a long time with plenty of sticky lacing. Burnt malt and coffee aromas, and background molasses. The coffee and burnt flavors have a strong presence in the taste, with very light hops hiding somewhere within. Aftertaste is slightly dry, with a touch of residual sweetness hanging on. Minimally carbonated with a full body producing exceptional smoothness. Rich and drinkable with a clean finish."
"Black, with traces of mahogany around the edges and bottom of the glass; a chocolate milk like head, with a decent and invigorating nose of roasted malts, chocolate and dark roast coffee beans. Creamy, tenderly slick; coffee roast flavors are couples with some charcoal and burnt toast. The palate is rich and clean, with dark chocolate and just a touch of bitterness. A long, lingering and nice smoky feeling going on here. Very nice; an absolute stellar porter, to be expected from Stone."
"Probably my least favorite offering by this great brewery. the appearance in my tumbler is impressive, but that's about where it stops. Not a bad brew by any stretch; just not a favor to my liking. The body seems too thin. The aroma is a pleasant burnt, cloyiness that is not very pungent. This is the second time I have had this and the taste didn't differ."
"One of the better Porters I've had in a bottle and definitely meets the title if one fancies this type."
"Poured into a glass from a 22oz. bomber, this hefty brew is reddish brown with caramel maltiness all over it. The back label describes how it is not like other dark beers and is not a ""bitter"" style; but this Porter has just a hint of tart-bitterness on the finish. I've had only a few other ""smoked"" beers in my day and this one is probably the least smoky, which is good, because that makes it easy to finish the 22oz. Goes down very smooth and makes one wish that six packs did come in 22oz format. Ahh to dream..."
"available in Bevarages & More."
"This brew pours dark brown..completely opaque of course...with a large head that dissapates down to ring around the edge of the glass. Dark roasted malt, chocolate, caramel notes. Sweeter than I expected. Some hops, and smokey as it should be. The alcohol is disguised completely, I could drink this for breakfast. The mouthfeel is slick and full. Overall a great porter, a tough comparison against Synebrychoff, which IMO is the best. But even still, very good. I will be drinking this again and again when in the mood for a porter."
"Pretty good, worth a try."
" Not much smoked flavor here, I was expecting more than was found. Still a pretty decent porter."
"Note: this is one to take your time and savor."
"I enjoyed this offering from stone, but it was perhaps a little less rich and thick than I expected. Pours with a lovely head that stays throughout. Carries a nice roasted, slightly smoky flavor along with the mild hoppiness, but overall the smoked side of it is more underwhelming than it could have been. Still, another delicious offering from Stone that deserves to be sampled and re-sampled."
"I wish the smoke was a little stronger, but otherwise an amazing brew. I think some of that comes down to my previous experience, so perhaps I'm a little biased."
"This beer pours a very dark brown. The head is thick and creamy. It looks brown. It fades very slowly, leaving thick laces. When I hold it up to the light, it has a dark ruby red look to it. It smells smokey, but not not overly smokey. It also has a malty aroma. It has a solid coffee aroma present. The hop aroma is very apparant. It tastes more smokey than the aroma led me to believe. Coffee is also very noticable. It has a sweet caramel like taste to it also, but it is subtle. This beer leaves a smokey taste on the palate. It is slightly aggressive in flavor, I think due to the smoke. It is a little over carbonated. This beer would probably make a bad session beer because it is aggressive and the flavor would get old fast. This is a good beer to have, but not very often."
"The aftertaste is quite smokey, but I suppose that's expected. I'm not a big one for the smoke flavor but this is a good brew. It's tasty, but I am glad that I split the 22 or I would have been on the floor with a smokey taste in my mouth. Not a good way to wake up :)"
"Drinkability/notes: Overall, quite excellent, would be very pleasing on a cold, dark, windy day."
"The carbonation is great, and coupled with the creaminess it makes for a great feel. I would be in love with this beer, but for my disagreement with most of the planet on the coffee thing."
"Taste is of dark roasted malt with some hop bitterness. Hints of coffee and dark unsweet chocolate also present. Finishes with a lingering bitterness."
"Pours a dark, opaque, black body with a creamy tan head, good retention. Smokey, lots of coffee and chocolate in the nose. Subtle smokey flavour, mostly just charcoal, coffee and chocolate. Not quite a rauchbier, but the smoked character is definitely there. Great balance, and actually a great session beer. Recommended."
"D-This beer is a spot-on-porter very solid on its own but the nice gentle smoke shows its present. The smoke is not overpowering and really compliments the deep roasted grain. Next time I'm in the distributing area I must stock up."
"The body is mediumish, could use a little more. A full, smooth and creamy mouthfeel makes up for the lack of body. Slick and tongue coating. Makes me wish I had some good hardwood smoked ribs to go with this."
" I would enjoy this on a very regular basis if it was available to me. This is a bad mofo!!! If you like Porters, you need to try this."
"Tasty, smooth, smokey (toasted malts I suppose), with a signature hops bite that one has come to expect from the good people at Stone. Pours black with a tan head with those deep coffee chocolate toffee aromas. The chocolate coffee toffee endures in the taste. Fans of porters have little to complain about this here beer. It's solid stuff."
"The base porter is also quite good and well balanced. Nothing is permitted to overpower the delicate smoke presence- neither the roasted malt, hops, caramel, yeast signature, etc, are overtly powerful. Therein lies a certain limiting aspect of this beer- intensity is sacrificed for drinkability. It's still freakin' good, though- put me down for a couple of bombers..."
"Holy Smoly, my first Stone, and my first smoked brew. A great start, the stone black pour produced a superb head  one that laced the pint glass all the way down. A chocolate malt aroma transcends over into the taste, along with coffee, light charcoal, burnt toast and the infamous smoky peat finish that gives you a small kick in the sack. Although thick and chewy, the light carbonation makes for a good session brew, or a one bottle afternoon  as long as youre in the shade."
"Overall Impression: Very enjoyable drink. A great spring/fall sit on the back porch with a cigar or some fish kind of drink. I had to work hard to sip and not just turn it up and DRINK it. Great drinkability, Ill have to work on a way to get some more out here in Texas. Well done Stone!"
" This is a mild beer in every regard, something that seems out of tune with the rest of Sone brews. This is the first Stone beer that I haven't been impressed with. In fact, this is pretty unimpressive IMO."
"Also note - if you find it in a store, and are considering it - BUY ONE! They are hard to come by. yes, $5 can be considered a lot to lay down for one big beer, but it is a very worthwhile purchase for both your enjoyment and for the support it provides to our fine American hand crafted breweries."
"This is a very drinkable brew. I had my second glass with some smoked gouda. Yumm!"
"Drinkability: Great, though coming in the larger bottle size, one is plenty."
"22 oz. brown bomber, no apparent best before or freshness date."
"."
"A good brew, but for as blended it was in flavor, I felt just-slightly-uncomfortably full after the bomber, so marks off for drinkability."
"Overall, SSP was one that pushed the boundaries of the porters that typically cross my palate. SSP is a more exciting sensory experience."
"Not especially smoky compared to some German imports, but interesting all the same."
"The taste is very full and complex. Lots of roasty and smoked malts with some hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is the best. This is such a heavy brew and not for the faint of heart. I love it."
"Notes: Wow, just wow. Absolutely wonderful porter. I don't know why they said its smoked, because you can't really notice it unless your paying a lot of attention. I love the hopiness in the beer. Loads of hop flavor and a bitterness that matches perfectly with the massive malt backbone. Very subtle smoke, unlike the smoked porter that Alaskan Brewing has. Nonetheless, I would buy a case of this stuff in a heartbeat."
"This is a very drinkable porter."
"Overall, a well-balanced, solid beer, whose initial over-sweetness was tempered first by the smokey flavor and then by the hops. A long, bitter finish, though, hurt the drinkability: I would never consider this a ""session"" beer."
"Beer is good. Happy West Coast beering."
"Slàinte!"
"Nice complex taste. Toasty malts, thick and toasted and very bitter. Salty, thick feel. But very sweet, corn syrup-like sweetness that seemed too much to me. Smokiness arrives in the mouth and continues in the after, blended with bitterness and metal. After doesn't seem totally balanced, with a quick injection of weedy hops amongst the smokey bitter. Slightly chewy. Bitterness develops out to sick levels deep into the after."
"Notes: A powerful, robust porter with lots of smoke and charcol. With this beer, what you see on the label is what you get, a big, smoked porter."
" Drinkability is very good enjoying this one alot nothing complex there just a very smooth easy drinking porter."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This is very good, it has a nice light body without the flavor being too much. Nice carbonation keeps it smooth, and this is immensely drinkable. The only thing that might start to bother is the smoked taste. One bomber and I was still ready for more, but some may be put off by the smokiness. I think this is excellent. Still waiting to try the Alaskan, however."
"I was excited when I poured this one. Just watching it in its dark aura with a light brown head. It had a chocolate Malay sweet smell. Chocolate and Smokey flavors filled my palate as it went down very smooth. It's low alcohol made this beer very drinkable."
"Very easy to drink but very filling. Had another sample from the pitcher and that was the perfect amount for me in one sitting. Certainly a good beer, but one to be enjoyed a little at a time."
"A very solid brew that begs to be drank again. Good balance among flavor components and quite drinkable. The only knock on this one, is that if you're expecting a very smokey porter you'll be a little let down. Once you get past this though, it's still a wonderfully flavorful porter."
"Deep brown pour, head did not last long. This smells like a cupful of smoky mocha. Silky smooth start becomes chocolate and charcoal with a mellow smoky finish. Mouthfeel is medium for a porter, perhaps because of the food I was eating. This was Cincinnati-style chili night at the homestead and we decided to sample smoke beers with dinner. A great match for this hearty meal."
"I haven't had any other smoked porters so I don't have much to compare to, but this is pretty good. If this was available to me at home I would get it once in a while."
"Mohogany in color with ruby highlights, the head sits 1 inches on top of the surface, a milky, tan head that dissipates very slowly, but lots of head clings to the glass. Brown roasted malts enter my sinuses, as well as a bit of smoke and caramel. Not overly complex in aroma, but nice. Taking the first sip, a sweet caramel flavor jumps out at me along with a bit of smoke flavor. By the swallow, the smoke takes over the body of the flavor, and leaves a huge smoke aftertaste in my mouth. Again, not overly complex, but comes through with what it promises in style. A little sweet up front, and smokey and a little bitter on the finish due to the smoke and the little bit of hops I taste. Carbonation is rather high and a little strong in my opinion, but the milky quality of the head seems to come through making this a much smoother swallow; nice and creamy! Overall, I enjoy everything Stone distributes that I can get my hands on, and this is just one more example in a style (smoke beer) that I am not as crazy about. I'd definitely share this one with some friends!"
"Creamy, 1/8-inch head of ultra-tight bubbles and one huge crater in the middle that eventually settles to a specter-like quality. Deep, dark black hue. Dark chocolate, light smoke, malt top on nose with a plum backing. Pretty smooth malt character on mouth with a black patent fining and a trailing, subtle smokiness that in no way overpowers the offering. Very drinkable for a smoked ale; could possibly have a couple of these and still not nuke the palate."
"A relatively light and refreshing, but not superlative porter. Aroma and flavor are restrained overall, but the finish is *very* well executed. Would make a nice session porter."
"Drinkability- Yeah, not bad at all. I would definitely suggest this one to smoke lovers. It has enough taste going on with the smoke to make it feel like your not sucking down liquid charcoal or burnt bacon like other smoke beers I have had. About the same as AK Smoked Porter. I'll have to try that one again and rate it."
"I'd love the opportunity to sample this complimented with salami or sausage incorporated into lasagna or pizza."
"Poured a very dark brown, nearly black color. Looked like liquid molasses, topped by a layer of creamy tan foam. The aroma has soft dark toffee notes with some sweet brown sugar. The taste is bitter with touches of roasted smoke. The smoke in this beer is really subdued and pleasant unlike the morning after campfire I was expecting. Creamy and roasted body which is generally smooth and solid. An assertive porter with some nice subtle enhancements. Very enjoyable."
"Ummm. Raspberries crushed with the burnt end of a fire poking stick made out of the tip of a Christmas tree. Chew on some pine sap, nibble on some rosemary, and nosh on some organic spinach. Finishes with herbal minerals, hence the spinach. It's got a silky mouthfeel to it, and - marshmallowy. Dang, that's good. It makes me want to grill an assinine-ly huge ribeye, and serve it with a side of pintos, and smokey New Mexican red chile."
"drinkability: Could see myself very easily having a couple bombers back to back of this majestic brew. Can only speak for myself, but it lives up to any hype it's been given and then some."
"Good carbonation and medium to heavy body."
"Still working my way through my Christmas gifts. This beers is so dark, no light could penetrate it. I was bored so held a flashlight behind the pint glass and (mostly due to the glare around the edge's of the glass) swear no light made it through. A thinlayer of head eventually forms on the top of the beer and incredibly sticky lace clung to the edges of the glass. The aroma is of a fire that had you wake up to the next morning and all you smell is the wet charred wood. The flavor is of charred malts and charred wood. Almost as if I licked the inside of a wodd-burning kettle. So good. IT wafts uo the back of the nose. There are also very deep notes of dark chocolate wrapped into the beer. It would make a great tasting beer, but if you're working through a variety of beers, make sure it is toward the end because you will not be able to taste much afterwards."
"The beer pours a deep brown, almost black with a ring of head over top of the beer. The nose is only slightly smokey, and mostly chocolate. The flavor has a bit more smokey flavor than the nose would tell, but still the chocolate and roasted tones dominate. The feel is moderate. I would like to have a little thicker or creamier bit to it. I like it, but this is no Alaskan Smoked Porter."
"Cracking open a deuce reveals a velvety smooth black brew with a frothy light khaki colored head. Hints of garnet when held to the light. Nice sticky lacing. Aroma is full roasted grain, with no shortage of coffee and chocolate. Hints of molasses and other dark things are also present. This wonderful flavor comes on smooth as silk, dripping with fat malts. Roasted grain presence steadily increases, till the flavor is chock full of it. Hints of bitter chocolate and truck stop coffee float around, seeking attention. The smoke I was looking for comes in towards the end and really stands out in the finish, leaving a semi-dry roasted flavor. Smoked malts really add a fine touch to this robust brew. Mouthfeel is pretty full for a porter, which is good - it helps to back up this bold flavor. Hella drinkable, not too heavy or alcoholic, but that smokiness is just so damn enticing. Thanks Stone for giving us one hell of a session porter."
"Mouthfeel: Just right, not too light or heavy. Makes for a very smooth beer with carbonation that tingles just enough."
"Poured a very dark, almost black, brown, with an hint of translucency ( I could see the shadow of my fingers on the other side of the glass). I picked up a slight smoky aroma from the bottle. The creamy tan head stayed a 1/4 inch thick till the bitter end. And that's my only negative. As smooth and creamy as this beer looks, and feels in the mouth, I was taken by surprise by the bitter bite. Not a complaint, just unexpected. Now that I am expecting it, I will enjoy this beer."
"I expected more of a smoked flavour much like Alaskan but this really a big Porter with smoky undertones. The beer is black like a moonless night with a tan head. The nose is pure malt with a peaty tang. The first sip is smooth and chocolatey with lots of body. A huge beer considering the relatively low alcohol( by Stone's standards). I started to sip this beer to enjoy the nuances inherent in its finish."
"This is one dark porter! A big tan creamy head tops my glass and holds strong. Coco on the nose. Hey what do you know, I smell some smoke as well. Taste is smooth with a slight coffee flavor along with that coco from the nose. Then it gets bitter, not hop bitterness but smoke bitterness which I like. This transition is kinda rough, taking away from mouthfeel and drinkability."
"Took the Bros. advice and chose this porter to go along with a real down-home meal. Not only did it stand up well to southern-styled favorite of fried chicken, greens and cornbread, but the smoky flavor made for a nice finish to a simple yet flavorful meal."
"Comes in a 22 oz. bomber, with a nice little paragraph about the gargoyle. Pours a very deep brown with just the tiniest hints of red poking through. A nice chocolate head tops it off with some very pretty lacing. Smells incredibly chocolately, with just a little hint at espresso. Tastes almost like a stout, only more chocolate. Nice coffee bean notes. A fabulous tasting brew to say the least. Nice and chewy in the mouth, with a suprising amount of hops rounding it off. The aftertaste stays for hours. A very drinkable beer, especially since t's only 5.9% ABV. A great brew indeed. My first shot at a Stone offering. Now on to the Arrogant Bastard..."
"Drinkability and overall: A cool rendition of a porter. I really enjoy my porters and although I've had better, this is a good one to try."
"So very drinkable. I'm very glad I could get a hold of it."
"Drinkability: It's great for hopheads like me to find a brew like this to break up my hop-craving ways. In the middle of a night of drinking, or towards the end, I will break out a bomber of this to totally jarr my palate. It's always a delightful switch."
"Mouthfeel is good and right on for the style. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Drinkability on this one is good, however I can't see myself having many. The smoky flavor doesn't really do it for me. However, it is easy to drink and is totally worth a try. Thank to ppoitras for the chance to try this intirguing brew."
"Another Stone classic. I have yet to be let down by this brewery. Very enjoyable and tasty."
"this beer poured a deep amber almost black, good head, and retention. smell was fruity and malty, taste was a pleasant mix of malt, fruity notes,a bit of chocolate, very smooth. subtle smokiness. Mouthfeel was a bit chewy, creamy, and medium carbonated. drinkability, for me is high! This stuff rocks! I've read some lukewarm reviews, but I think this is the shznit! really good stuff, highly recomended!!!"
"Stone did a great job here to create a big porter, Great, will buy again"
"As far as drinkability goes, I can drink this beer all night. It's a great porter to use to introduce the style to someone who is unfamiliar with great brews and the porter style."
"From recently discovered notes: Dark chocolate brown, with scarlet edges when held up to the light. The head is thick and khaki coloured, it lasts for a while and leaves some decent lacing on my Arrogant Bastard pint glass. The aroma is of chocolate and caramel malts, roasted malts, starbucks coffee, and a bit of smoke. The taste is malty up front with some lovely chocolate and coffee notes in the middle. The smoke is subtle compared to other smoke beers, but it is very enjoyable as well. The mouthfeel is very creamy and s-m-o-o-t-h and the drinkability is good as well. Another awesome, but subdued, stone brew!"
"This beer poured a deep dark brownish black. I could see light through the glass but I had to hold it up to light. That's how a porter should be right? The head expanded to a large volume then declined after some time. Lots of lacing. The nose is mostly chocolate and some roasted malt flavor but not all that I was hoping it would be. The flavor on this beer was really thick and malty. Very roasted in the body with a mocha bitter combination on top. Never sweet but quite malty. Hops are more apparent in the finish and slightly bitter in the end. There is a smoky undertone to this beer but I wish it would have been stronger. Does age lessen the smokiness of a beer? This is probably the 2003 so maybe the smoke flavor diminished. All in all this is a really, really good porter but I just wanted a stronger element of smokiness in there."
"A very nice smoked porter. This beer pours a nice dark color. There was a rather small head. The smell was of nice roasted malts. The taste is nice, with hints of a mixture of mocha and smoke, Nice smooth mouthfeel. A beer worth giving a try. You should enjoy."
"Good job to Stone, but again not a big outlandish beer that I would expect from Stone."
"Wyll-"
"This is about a big, bad porter. It's not the most complex brew in the world, nor is it a ""smoke"" beer per se, but what's there works. There's a fine line between this and stout, but if like your porters burly, this will not disappoint. Good stuff."
"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades. The aroma is good. It has a nice dark malt scent that boasts of chocolate, crystal, and black barley. It is a bit dry and devoid of hops. The taste is good. It has a fine malt palate and a dry smoked malt finish. It is rich, yet smooth. There are a lot of black malts in this one. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking porter. It has excellent malt complexity and drinkability."
"definitely a good beer. if you are a fan of porters or strong stouts then you will like this. if they sold this is 6packs i would be alot happier"
"22oz brown bomber. This poured a deep black that let a little bit of light through and a decent sized tan head that quickly faded down to a collar. Smokiness can defiantly be detected in the smell but it is not overpowering as coffee and roasted malts also come through quite well. The taste is a quite balanced with the smokiness being subtle and a sweet malt flavor coming to the front of this. It has a slight bittersweet finish that is quite pleasant. Mouthfeel is light medium with good carbonation. A good all around beer that is not your average porter. Another good brew by stone."
"Pint at the Taproom at Ghent."
"Smoked Porter isn't the best porter that I've ever had, but it's damn close. I knew that Stone wouldn't let me down. If you have easy access to this fine beer, then consider yourself extremely fortunate."
"Poured a deep deep ruby black color-theres just a trace of light peeking thru. Crammed the whole bomber bottle into one glass and it has a huge,white,creamy head atop it. Chocolate/roasty flavor dominates-a slight trace of smoke in the backround-builds as you get more into the beer. Mellow hop bitterness. Very full mouthfeel-the smokiness sneaks thru in the velvety finish of the beer. A very delicious,drinkable beer-cant imagine this on draft-whew!!!"
"I love Stone offerings as much as the next guy but the smoked porter did not do my tastebuds justice. It is a good beer but from Stone you expect incredible with a capital I. Pours a ruby dark color with a creamy head that grows to an astonishing level. The smell is of roasted malts and mocha roast, smokiness. Taste is where it fell off the charts, hint of mocha and cream but not as full bodies as I would have liked, lighter than expected. Feels light in the mouth, un appealing. Drinkable for a nice meal but not that dessert beer I hoped for that is a meal of its own."
"One of the better porters I've experienced. Smoke is muted, with a nice sweetness taking the foreground. Finishes with a slight bitter tang. Only complaint is that the carbonation is off somehow."
"I usually like most things from Stone, however, this does not blow my socks off. The pour is very nice, with a nice creamy head ( I almost thought it was a bad bottle because the first pour had a huge head). The Smoke flavor is faint. Lingering in the background, covered up by the roasty burnt malt flavor. There isn't much to the aroma, but what is there, is smoky. I just don't pick it up in the flavor. It's a solid porter, but I just don't find it all that great as a smoked beer."
"Pours a beautifully dark chocolate brown, almost blackish. The head was gone almost instantly and left only a slight beige ring. Just enough carbination. Great aroma, nice and smokey. The flavor is a great blending of the wonderful smokiness, roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, a nice toastiness. You are left with alot of flavor in your mouth after each sip... yummmy. Such a nice and smooth mouthfeel, but not at all heavy, nicely drinkable. I have always liked the smoked and am a big fan of Stone, and have been looking forward to trying this one. Once again they haven't let me down."
"Smoky and chard it is, but this is a good stout. NOT A PORTER!"
"When poured from the 22 oz. bomber, with the signature Stone Gargoyle, into a Pilsner glass, the beer displays an inch tall off-white rocky head that diminishes to a small line of bubbles, leaving a fair bit of lacing. The body is ruby brown in color, and is much clearer than almost any other porter that I have come across. The smoked malt clearly imparts a burnt roasty aroma to the beer. The hop aroma is light and faintly grassy. The taste is refreshingly acidic (lemons mostly), and bitter-sweet chocolate with almonds, with a smoky grain flavor constantly lingering in the background. There is also a hint of cracked peppercorn in the aftertaste. The body is light on the palette, with a creamy smooth texture enhanced by the soft carbonation. The finish is chalky and bone dry, leaving you craving the next sip. The beer is amazingly drinkable, and would make a good companion on a hot summer day. Stylistically, this is not quite a classic porter, but Stone is not known for their strict adherence to such things. I say more power to them."
"Yet, another excellent offering from the fine folks at Stone. I picked this bottle up during the ""Michigan BA's Invade Toledo"" gig. Pours out to a jet black in the glass with a decent-sized head. Aroma is that of dark chocolate and coffee. The taste is excellent, with a wonderfully smooth roasted malt taste that finishes with a swallow that beckons you to sip again. Drinkable and easily a session porter."
"This beer had a mighty nice taste to it. Everytime I taste this beer, it has something slightly different to offer from past tasting experiences. On this occasion, the taste really hit me in the back of my mouth. Very bitter, tastes of roasted malts, very round upon my tongue, full flavors of coffee, slightly nutty, and some tastes of alcohol. This beer left a HUGE aftertaste in my mouth. I found this porter to be very smooth, somewhat complex, and very nice to drink. Count me in for at least one of these, but certainly not a beer I could drink all night long (well...maybe. This is subject to change!)"
"Very interesting beer. One of the ""biggest"" porters to cross my palate and my first smoked beer. I'm inspired to try more, very nice."
"Drinkability: This is a wonderfully balanced beer of exceptional flavor. I don't remember the smoke character being this noticable the last time I had one, but that was in a smoky bar (The Brickskeller) after I'd had a few other beers. It's verra nice."
"Another super-solid offering from Stone. This is definitely one of my favorite porters Ive tried."
"Had this brew on tap at Mahars the other night. Brew poured to almost black color with a nice head that stuck around for about half of the brew and then broke down to pretty good lacing. The aromas of this brew where of caramel, chocolate, charcoal and of course a sweet smokiness. Excellent aroma coming from this brew. The taste was very much in line with the aroma, but the roasted malt flavor was prevalent. Also could notice a bit if a hop hit but is was difficult to track that one down. Nice think brew that I think would be incredible during the colder months but was happy to give it a try with it being close to 80 out! Over all a great brew and would track this one down again!"
"Very dark, almost black in color with some deep red highlights. Creamy tan head that stays and leaves nice lacing. Sweet aroma with chocolate, caramel, and a hint of roasted malt. Rich flavor, once again with chocolate, coffee, caramel, and roasted malt. Some toasted grain also peeks through along with a hint of smokiness. Hop flavor is light, herbal when noticed. Lingering roasted flavor. Medium-full in body, creamy, and smooth. After having this beer, I know what they mean by saying chewy. Highly drinkable. Not as smokey as I imagined, but excellent regardless. A terrific porter."
"Once again Stone has the head that won't quit. Beautiful lacing all the way to the end.Has a smokey charcoal aroma with a hint of peat. Carbonation is just perfect and such a smooth feel on the tongue. Here's where it gets interesting. Shared this with two friends and they just kept going back and forth on the flavors that kept coming through. Roasted, toasted barley, hops comes to the palate for a brief visit only to be replaced with perhaps a caramel but I think chocolate. Stone just keeps our minds working with the combinations of flavors in all of their brews. Definely one of the best Porters I've ever had. If you missed this one, you're missing the boat!!!"
"Dark brown hue with a thin, quickly absent tan head. The smoke isn't so subtle to me, it's actually pretty well developped. Very sweet though with lots of crystal? malt making up honey and maple flavors. Subdued hops profile that gain Stone a bit of respect from me. Chocolatey sweet, just very malty altogether and finely balanced once the grassy green hops finally kick in, but it's no standout in my books and is actually a bit watery in the finish. I can definitely see where the brewers are from when they claim this to be their less understood beer though."
"Pours black ruby in color with a thick and creamy tan head that billows out of the top of the glass with no spillage. Nose is roasted coffee beans and dark caramel along with some fainter aromas of smoked grains. Fairly full in body with a somewhat heavy and chewy texture and a very smooth level of carbonation. Taste begins with some sweet malts and milk chocolate followed by flavors of fresh brewed coffee and some earthy notes with touches of smoky charcoal and peat with only a mild trace of bitter hops towards the finish. The smoky and peaty notes remain in the aftertaste, becoming more pronounced as the beer warms. Another winner from Stone. Purchased from Liquid Solutions."
"The beer was presented to me in a tall pilsener glass at Fleming's Steak House in San Diego. It was a solid black with brown tints at the edges. The head was poured small, but it was light and creamy and left a strong lace. The aroma was of chocolate and roasted goodies. Tiny bit of hop aroma. Not a whole lot of smoke. The taste was full of chocolate and sweet roasted grains. Astringency was low. Mild hop flavor barely balanced the chocolate sweetness. Smokiness was restrained. Not dry. I ordered a filet mignon and I don't think they went too well together, go figure. Anyways, this porter is medium bodied and very smooth. I had this a few months ago in the bottle and it was terribly astringent. This tap version was very nice."
"The beer poured dark chocolate brown, bordering on black. It poured a good foamy one and one half inch head that slowly dissapated and left a slight creamy lace on top that stuck to the glass throughout the entire drink. The smell was semi-sweet with a fair amount of spicy undertones. Just a slight hint of coffee. It started out with a sweet cream taste with just the right mix of a coffee taste. The middle was laced with a spice that I just can't put my finger on. The finish was just slightly bitter with a slight kick of smoke. All and all a great beer that would be great to share with friends over a heated conversation about nothing, or with a fine dinner, or just sitting back and relaxing after a long day at work."
"Drinkability is relatively high, love to try this one with some spicy BBQ'ed ribs"
"Overall a really nice porter. Tasty, smooth and creamy but not as thick as a stout. Just a faint hint of smoke giving it a nice added touch. Basically just another great beer from stone."
"Largely black in hue with shinny ruby highlight around the edge of the glass once held to the light. The brunette head reached two fingers in height and the retention was nearly flawless. It took a long while before it faded noticeably. The subsequent lacing was massive. It was a beautiful sight. The nose was quite unexpected. Where was the smoke? I mean I could detect the American hops the second I started pouring it and once I took a sniff a good amount of roast chocolate malts and coffee hints were detectable. But where is the smoke? Frankly it just smells like a big Porter. Thats not really a bad thing but the label is misleading thus far. The palate is tasty; I think I found what is meant by smoke, I detected a burnt flavor. Unexpected. Disappointing. Still, tasty. I guess this is the difference between a Smoked Beer and a Rauchbier. Back to the palate, the big roasted flavors dominate but allow room for a reserved bite of hops. This is a well-rounded Porter that is very easy to drink. I am digging the fact that the alcohol content so modest. This is the first Stone beer that does not reign down pure anger in the form of hops! Still, Im digging it. I mean the drinkability is sensational. I want more! The mouthfeel is pleasant, the carbonation seems a bit small and the body is medium-full, still I found it a touch slick but this is hardly a big negative. All I can say is this is a delicious Porter with a straight-ahead tastiness that is hard to rebuff. I bet this could be paired with an array of BBQ and grilled food. I bought my 22-ounce bottle in Loveland. My advice to you, buy some but dont expect a Rachbier like I did!"
"The mouthfeel is smooth with a slight dry aftertaste. The smokiness and coffee tones last long on the tongue after swallowing. This is one of the better smoked brews I have ever sampled."
"Taste does not live up to the smell. Lots of chocolate flavor and lots of dark malt. Lightly nutty and bitter coffee flavors. Strong licorice flavors as well. There is some light smoke throughout but nothing like the smell or like other smoked beers I have had. however, it is still a really complex and tasty beer. Smoky aftertaste and full-bodied. Damn drinkable. I can't think of another time that a beer has disappointed me so much but still delivered things I wasn't even looking for. Excellent!"
"It was more bitter and less smooth than what I typically look for in a porter, but it's definitely good."
"This is my first Stone offering (I'm saving my DB,) and I wasn't sure what to expect, but it's all good. The eponymous smoke never overwhelms, but rather adds a fun aspect to a good porter. It's never over the top and delivers good flavor along with something a bit different. Goes to show you, add a flavor to what starts as a good beer, and it has a chance to be a winner. It drinks easily and freely, which is obviously a good quality. No, I'm not wowed, but I'm pleased, and if Stone gets nothing but better from here on for me, then life is surely fine."

"It is ruby-black in color. the aroma has roasted coffee and some smoke, though I would have expected more from a brewer such as Stone. The body is thick, creamy and complex. There are notes of dark fruits, coffee, and chocolate. Of course there is the smoke, but I wish there was more of it. A fine beer that I would never pass up, but I want more smoke."
"Poured a deep black with only the slightest hints of deep brown along the edge of the glass. Head was just slightly off-white and fell down to a thick webbing of foam along the top of the beer. Smell is dark chocolate, thick gooey dark chocolate, roasted malt, and just a hint of subdued smokiness. Taste leads off with a smooth hop bitterness that has a citrus/earthy tone, then takes you into roasted malt land. The dark chocolate tones reign supreme, and the finish adds just a touch of smoke. Mouthfeel is very nice, but perhaps a bit too much in the astringent drying feeling left at the very end. Not bad, though. A very drinkable beer, and very enjoyable."
"Other: Is ""Smoked Beer"" as a style kind of a catchall?"
"Very dark scarlet/ruby color with a rich sticky thick lacing yellowish beige head. Rich sweet chocolate smell with a slight wisp of toasted hazel nut. Inital dry cocoa powder and coffee taste. The brew then finishes with a sharp hop/smoke bite. The mouth is thick initally with a dry back of the tongue finish. The dryness to the finish pushes you to drink more. There is alot going on in the brew complex and bewildering to the palate."
"Drinkability is great. If I had more, I would have another, and at 5.9% ABV, another wouldn't hurt!"
"What could be better than a bomber of Stone beer? Not much I can tell you. It has been a long time since I have had a smoked beer, so here goes. This pours a deep dark brown liquid with ruby tones. The head is a nice tan color, and it stayed for a little while. It left some nice lace on the sides of the glass. Smells of roasted grain, with a slight smoky, oak aroma. Tastes kind of a slight chocolatey thing. The smoke hits at the end, but it doesn't really hit, it just kind of taps you on the shoulder. Hello my friend. Felt a little thin, but definitely not the end of the world. Even though this is a smoke beer, it is very drinkable. Not an overpowering smoke effect, just a pleasant, subtle flavor. I have yet to be disappointed by a Stone beer. This is one smoke that shouldn't be banned from a bar!"
"The tatse is a very nice and flavorful. A lot of subtle smoke flavor with a bit of charcoal and toasted nut hiding in the back. Not overly hopped, which is a departure for Stone. Mouthfeel was a hair thin for my liking and it was just a little too fizzy but overall a really decent session porter."
"Thanks to WVBeerGeek for the hookup!"
"Paid $3.79 for a 22 oz. Another kick ass brew from Stone. Black liquid, white head. Great sweet/bitter porter flavor. I had to search for the smoke, but it is in there. Not too sticky either. This'd be great with chicken wings or other spicy bar food."
"This beer does one thing (beautifully subtle smoke flavor) and does it well. I'm a fan."
"22 oz bottle pours a ruby hued, dark brown with a big cocoa head. Appears to be opaque until held to the light. Enormous roasted flavors in the nose: dark chocolate, roasted coffee, and some campfire aromas are dominate. Some westcoast hops seem to be wafting in the background. Mouthfeel is full bodied, rich and creamy, yet has a mild spicy hop twang. Nicely carbonated. Taste is dark chocolate and roasted coffee, as might be expected, but you can easily sense some hop character. Campfire smokiness is present throughout, but is understated. Some dark fruits try to emerge as it nears room temperature, but get knocked back by the bittering hops. This is a very well crafted brew, but is a bit too heavy in character for my preference in a Porter. This one seems a lot closer to a Stout than a Porter. Too thick and rich to get superlative marks on drinkability."
"Another high quality creation from Stone. Almost black , with hints of ruby. Nice roasted malts in the center.This is a very well crafted smoked brew, as the smoke flavor is very present,but it doesnt overwhelm the flavor, balance and character of the brew. Velvet mouthfeel, nice hoppy , crisp finish. Stone is quickly becoming a must try brewery. This one is a fine Quafer, well worth seeking out. Tried this one on Tap at The Gingerman in NYC."
"I am utterly depressed that I have not had this before."
"That thought is continued through the taste. Initially I sensed some greeness, but the longer I take, the better tastes. There are some sweet flavors that mingle with the otherwise dry and peaty dominance, and they do help. For a Stone brew, I'm somewhat startled by the lack of bitterness, but the hop selection seems to compliment the beer very well. It helps dry the palate with the smoke, and whispers in your ear ""take another sip."""
"The drinkability in this beer is low. The taste was pretty powerful and I myself would not want much more of this. A decent beer but one is enough."
"Pours a dark, dark brown with a modest light brown head. Aroma is of sweet, strong coffee, with a really small hint of smoke. Rich and full-bodied with a creamy, but crisp mouthfeel. Chocolately, coffee-like malt with a hint of smoke. Hop bitterness also comes into play. Ah, another beer that drinks like a meal. This isn't a porter for wimps, as this has a huge taste. Despite all this, I would say that this isn't Stone's best beer."
"My second Stone offering...a Christmas present....Santa was very good to me...As someone who is starting to appreciate Porters, I was very happy with this offering. A dark chocolate color with a beautiful head that leaft an unbelievable lacing started the experience. The aroma was what it said...smoky...coffee-bean like with a hint of tartness to come. Taste was extremely well-rounded with a creamy mouthfeel that was medium bodied. The smoky coffee flavors were there, but so was an excellent slightly bitter aftertaste. Extremely smooth drinkability. I tried this at about 55-60 degrees which seemed ideal. Right up there in my top tier of fine brews. Definitely a brew to try."
"The beer has a rich, thick mouthfeel...mouth-coating with a somewhat astringent and dry finish. Roasted grain throughout, and moderately bitter hop aftertaste. Overall, it's a very drinkable, well-made brew."
"A super dark brown color that would give you the impression that it was a stout just by looking at it. There was a smoky smell as well as a smoky yet caramel taste. If there is a better way to spend my winters, I havn't had it yet. This beer was as smooth as it gets."
"The Smoked Porter poured a dark black with a semi-creamy tan head that dissipated rather quickly. Suprisingly, there was not much of an aroma to this beer just a slight malt smell. I wasn't very impressed with the taste either. It had a very bitter, hoppy finish for a porter. As it warmed a roasted malty start became more pronounced. I was expecting a lot from this beer and was pretty disappointed. It wasn't bad, but it was nowhere near what I though it would be. I didn't notice any smokiness in the nose or taste either."
"Good mouthfeel if not a little thin. The sharp aftertaste hurt the drinkability for me."
"Very drinkable, more subdued that I'd expect when the words Stone and Smoked are involved."
"overall a very good beer, worth seeking out for the smell alone."
"my second stone brew. they're easily 2 for 2 thusfar. pours a dark dark brown to near black with a nice creamy tan head that leaves a nice stickiness on the glass. the smell and taste are of smoke, coffee, chocolate and malt. the smell has some other sweet qualities to it and the taste falls in the order listed above, with a finish that goes back to the coffee flavour for a nice dry finish. this is an easy drinking brew that is most complex than most, if not all, of the porters that i have sampled. the relatively low alcohol content makes this a nice choice for a different type of session brew if you are looking for one."
"Pours a deep brown with some ruby tint to it with a light but creamy looking almond colored head,the aroma is very nice I think the light smoky hints along with the chocolate almost makes a fudge brownie aroma is it just me?Taste is very earthy with a raw peanut flavor with the smokiness coming in late that lingers definant resiny hop flavor intermingaled in there as well.A pretty complex beer very worthy of its high marks in my humble opinion."
"Rich dark brown color almost opaque; nice tan to light brown head. Faint smokiness amidst all the qualities of a quality porter; roastiness, maltiness and all the stereotypical dark ale qualitites (coffee, chocolate, dark fruit, etc...) Personally, I've tasted better porters, but the subtle smoke presence in this beer rounds it out and makes it quite enjoyable. I feel Stone has done a remarkable job with this beer. Of course, it's no Schlenkerla as far as smoked beers go, but you know it's not trying to be that kind of a smoked beer. Sometimes less is better, and if this beer was more aggressively smoked, I'm not so sure I'd like it as much. It's found a certain kind of chi. Right up there with Anchor Porter as a quality west coast porter."
"A little too much hop bitterness for me, this beer was surprisingly flavorful for a thin body - in fact, a thin session mouthfeel but covered in some carbonation. Well done just not my taste for a porter."
"Pours black with a persistant light brown head. Aroma is first of roast malt, followed by smoke which comes to dominate the aroma, though it is not overwhelming. The taste is malty, with roasted notes, and then the smoke injects itself. The smoke is the dominant flavor, though it is not as strong as some other examples. Very well balanced for a Stone beer :-)"
"Drinkability: Stronger than most porters I have had, but still a great interpretation. Will try again when I can."
"As for flavor-- its a tasty porter-- a little light in the malt flavor signature department especially given the peat smoked malt and overall lighter flavor profile compared to other fave porters such as Ipswich . Stone Smoke Porter has a much heartier start to finish than Anchor Brewings porter. Generally it has all the profile and character of an excellent heavier bodied beer. In my opinion, it has the proper color, hearty balance of hops and malt, nice mouthfeel and a lingering finish. Although I cant detect anything special about the malt notes. Maybe Im expecting something out of the ordinary because of the so-called peat smoked malt. Nevertheless-- I like! I like!"
"Black as night, tannish head lasted and left nice rings of lace. Slightly smoky smell wafted up from the glass. Nice subtle roastiness and smoked character I found was just right. Good solid mouthfeel, highly drinkable. A very nice porter and one I would seek out again. Go Stone!"
"Notes: Good beer in small doses. Smokyness mostly balanced by the malt sweetness. If you like smoky beers, don't pass this one by."
"pours a fairly opaque black with a nice khaki head that dissapears quickly. smell is of burnt coffe, toffee, woodsmoke and chocolate. Flavour was more subtle than i thought it would be. Starts of with a sweetness and finishes with a bit of a hop bite. Not alot of smoke on the palate however. I dont think i would have pegged this a smoke beer if i had not have known. the mouthfeel is silky smooth and the beer is nice and light on the carbonation. Drinkablity- this would go great with any grilled meats. I could definately see it with nice rich stew esp if the stew had a bit of bacon in it. Not a session beer but definately one you could savour during a meal"
"This is my first taste of a Stone beer, and after built up expectations from all the hype I've heard, I am sorry to say I'm a bit disappointed. They managed to take a beer that should have multiple levels of interest and effectively squelch most of it with an oppressive hoppiness. That said, perhaps my expectations were just too high -- it's a good beer, and if I'm really looking for a load of hops, I'll look here again. But, in my opinion, for a smoked porter, this is far from well-balanced. The other bottle I bought will live in the cellar for a while, and perhaps the flavors will be perfectly balanced and blended after the hops have some time to fade."
"What an ubelievable beer. Poured into clear pint glass, the richness of this brew is aparent immediately. Nice tan lace cascades down the glass until the end. You can smell the dark malt and smokiness, but it is not overwhelming nor distracting. I could not get over the taste. Rich and deep, all I can say it is the essence of what a porter should taste like. Chewy and fulfilling, it is certianly one of my favorite porters."
"Having tried Alaskan Smoked Porter a little while back, I wanted to try another smoked porter and compare the two. This is possibly the most subtle beer I have ever had. It pours a dark black, with a moderate tan head and average lacing. The smell is that of most good porters - roasted malt, notes of black coffee - but with a beguiling smokiness hovering in the background. This smokiness sets the mood without dominating it. The taste is again a study in smoky restraint. The coffeeish, roasted malt taste is filled out and accentuated by the smoke flavor, which adds a rich, silkiness to the proceedings. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy, like any good porter. This is a wonderful beer, and I deeply regret having purchased only one. Whereas Alaskan Smoked Porter bursts forth when you drink it, like a big alderwood swat team busting down your door, this smoked porter shakes your hand and puts its arm over your shoulder"
"Deep Black Color, medium head. Aroma is smoky and malty. Roasted malt flavor, slightly sweet, chocolate and coffee, slightly smoky. Hops balance the roasted malts well. This is a nice porter, yet the slight touch of smoky adds an extra touch of flavor. Taste is very smooth. The smokiness is subdued and may not please a lot of drinkers. All in all a very nicely done beer. Subtly sometimes works better than a sledgehammer. Stone beers are usually over the top, this one is subtle. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet. Etched/painted beer bottle."
"Notes: Excellent beer. It may not be the smokiest, but it surely impressed me. TRY THIS BEER!"
"This brew pours a dark almost black color with a slight hint of ruby. There is a fair sized tan head at the top and it gives away to a very thin sticky lace. The aroma is a mixture of roasted malt, brunt coffee, and a slight sweet scent. The flavor is mellow but very satisfying and is a direct copy of the aroma. There is a bit of a dry after taste (hops?) that hangs around and more of the smoke (burnt coffee) finish. Another very nice brew from Stone. I could sit down and enjoy another one BUT I only have one and some bitch named Isabel is hanging around off the coast."
"This was my first brew from the Stone Brewing Co and I was quite impressed. Pours very dark, almost black with ruby highlights. Nice tan head that is quite fluffy for a moment, becomes rocky for a short while, and finally gives way to a nice thick, sticky lace that holds on to the sides of the glass. Aroma is of roasty, caramel malts and a slight hop influence. The mouthfeel is first smooth, sweet caramel malt with slight undertones of chocolate. Then the strong roasty flavor hits the pallete and follows through to a mildly bitter, slightly dry finish. A roasty burnt flavor lingers afterwards. Medium body with moderate to light carbonation. Great mellow brew thats doesnt try to knock your socks off, but does anyway. A very solid, drinkable brew that I really enjoy. I was quite sad to hit the bottom of the 22oz bottle. I cant wait to pick this one up again!"
"Drinkability: I worked through that bomber in no time, and started to look for another that unfortunately wasn't there. Must remember more than one next time."
"Nice lace once poured. Good look, descent smell. There was the hint of raosted malts in the after taste, and smoke was theree, just not the way I expected. The dominant flavor had to be the bitterness from the hops. Reminded me of arrogant bastard that way. The creamy ness come in full effect after the bittnerness. I wish they would sacrifice the bitterness for more of the roasted flavor, but it is still a good beer. enjoy!"
"This has made two of there latest beers that I have really been dissapoint with. The 7th anniversay and now their porter."
"Update: The 2004 is wound a bit tighter than the 03. The heavy flavors are bigger and the lighter fruits and sugars are faint. This is a terrific candidate for cellaring."
"This beer kicks all forms of major ass, Im speechless! It pours a deep black color, theres not a single bit of light passing through this one. Its topped of by a thick and creamy tan head that dissipates moderately, leaving a thick, sticky film on the sides of the glass. Every time I smell the sweet aroma I detect a different scent. The major aromas are roasted malts, coffee, dark chocolate, and caramel with just a hint of butterscotch. There is a great balance of charred oak smokiness intermixed with the sweet aromas. The taste matches the aroma perfectly; ever aroma that I detected is represented very well on the palate. There is a nice coffee-like aftertaste that lingers around for a while. This is a beautifully well-balanced, full bodies brew. I could see myself drinking this beer all night long. Its absolutely wonderful."
"Flavors are better, as the label suggests, if this porter isn't served right out of the fridge. Just a good overall beer, especially if your a porter fan. Smokiness adds an interesting twist that's not overdone either."
"This rather surprising offering by Stone is my favorite. Not at all what I expected, it exceeded all my preconceived ideas about how Stone would brew this style. SSP has a superb blending of tastes without the almost over the top aggressiveness characterizing other Stone beers. Reasonable % ABV and mellow nature make this so very quaffable. A real treat and my new Monday Night Football beer."
"What a great beer! Stone is two for two so far in my ratings. This one poured a dark brown, almost black with a tan creamy head. Strong aromas were sweet, smoked (duh) malts, and No. MN peat bog. Taste was dominated by smoky roasty malts. I was reminded of beef jerky. Despite the obvious smokiness, this beer was wonderfully balanced by a bitter finisth. Huge mouthfeel. I would buy this by the case."
"Notes: ""SSP"" almost always kicks ass; had this on tap down at the Stone Brewery and it was downright evil; would rate higher for me if I hadn't had the 6th Anniversary Porter..."
"22oz. bomber poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep black with two fingers of tan foam. There is decent lacing left behind. The smell is rich in chocolate and coffee, and has just a hint of smokiness. The taste is full of smoked chocolate malt and toffee. Nice little hops kick in the finish to balance it all out. The mouthfeel is fairly heavy, very smooth. The drinkability is very nice for a porter. Another great brew from Greg and the guys & gals at Stone."
"It is very crisp and refreshing. Despite its dark color it is not heavy and drinks very easily. I do not drink porters on a regular basis but this one seems to differ from the few other porters that I have had. It tastes like a porter but it still has a stout quality to it in some ways. Anyway a very nice and enjoyable drink."
"Pretty good brew. Not as smokey as some German smoke beers, so might be a way to introduce this flavor to someone. pat"
"Dark brown, nearly black with an inch-and-a-half of light brown head that just hangs in there. Small tight bubbles around the bottom rise up to thick foam. Lots of thick brown lace around the glass as it empties. Aroma is of roasted malt, smoke, some peat and licorice. Flavor is dark malt and smoke all at the same time. Rich and full, well-balanced. Heavy molasses rolls across the tongue and the finish leaves some bitter coffee and raisin. A bit of smokey tingle in the aftertaste. Brown sugar and toffee come out as the glass warms. Very drinkable for such a full flavor (or because I like porters and smoked beer)."
"Deep dark brown or black color depending on your perspective of things. Fluffy, tan head. Full of soft hop bubbles that make you wonder how they do that. The smoke aroma was not the direct punch in the nose I expected. Instead, it was smooth, somewhat sublte, and very well placed. The smoke smell didn't dominate the traditional porter aromas of bitter roasted coffee. Taste was much the same. Smokiness was no where near dominate and let the subtle good porter flavors show through. Hints of creamy chocolate show through, or am I dreaming ? Wow what a tremendous beer. No where near as smoky as those August Schlenka Rauchbeers. Full bodied, very much inline with what you would expect from a porter. Supersmooth and well worth the wait to finally have some Stone Beers. I had this with a garlic roasted chicken, delicious combination."
"22 oz bomber. Poured a deep dark brown, that almost looked black. With a massive chocolate colored head that slowly receded, leaving some fine lacing on the glass. Aroma is of roasted malt, and a slight smokeiness. Taste is again of roasted malt, chocolate and coffee. More like a stout than a porter, but with a creamy smooth mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, and a slight bitter aftertaste. Thoroughly enjoyable! Wish I had picked up more!"
"Overall a decent porter. As a smoked porter it left a lot to be desired in the taste section. It lured me in with the aroma of smoke but left me hanging. I MIGHT buy this again if I can't find any better smoked beers in my store. But there are better ones."
"Big thanks to Gusler for the samples!!"
"Campfire in a bottle! Pass the s'mores, please..."
"thanks to xlperro"
"22 oz bomber. Pours a near black with a frothy tan head. Slightly smokey aroma, with sweet fruit, port and a tasteful hop presence. A big, nicely carbonated mouthful is followed by a suprisingly refreshing taste. Lots of flavors to go round with a plum fruitiness, some bitter espresso (even though the back label denies it), mild smoke flavor, and a seductive hoppiness that could keep me coming back to this fine beverage again and again. A friend, who sadly wasn't worthy of the Arrogant Bastard, deemed the Smoked Porter ""One of the best beers I've ever had"". Did someone say Stone?"
"(I can't believe I used the word 'subtle' in a Stone review)."
"In traditional stone fashion, this is a big beer done a little differently than everyone elses. Overall impression is of their 6th Anniversary Porter with some smoke thrown in to add complexity. Poured a dark brown with red highlights and a creamy light brown head. Bitterness was a little surprising to find, but once you get over the shock, it starts to make sense in the beer. Sweet malt gives way to slightly more than a hint of smoke. Nice medium body."
"This one puzzled me a bit. I'd never had it nor read anything about it, so I wasn't really expecting something quite so stout-like. It was very, very dark, and the head was remarkably tight -- almost nitro-tight -- and dark tan as well. I thought I was looking at more of a stout. The aromas were nice, though I was hoping for just a tiny bit more of a ""smoky"" aroma. Definitely chocolate and sweet sensations, though. Very full-bodied with some big chocolate flavors. I really enjoyed it and thought it was exceptionally drinkable -- but I wanted intensity, passion, and, goddammit, smoke! Really, it just didn't live up to what I thought a smoked porter from Stone could be -- maybe a bit more lively and with a little more variety in flavors? (Like, you know, actual smoke?)"
"Very nice aroma that is pleasant to the nose. It has a typical very dark brown color with a small head that quickly disappears. I found my self taking 3 or four tastes before I even got a feeling for this Porter. It was a very mild taste that escaped me for a few moments. It had almost no before or after taste. Very smooth and lacking any bitterness. I find myself liking the Porters more and more. This brew is pushing me over the edge in that direction. Can I have some more please?"
"Roast flavors, espresso coffee, bittersweet chocolate, all meld into raisins and a mild smoky flavor. Mellow and smooth."
" Excellent robust Porter."
"A decent porter overall, but a little at odds with itself. With a little more malt, and a little more smoke it would live up to the high expectations these guys place upon themselves."
"good looking, very dark rootbeer look to it, almost black. this is one of the best smelling beers i've ever smelled. it smells very sweet and strongly floral, a pleasure to smell. this porter has a good chocolatey flavor to start, but after a few more sips, the smokey malts come through. the after taste is nice, leaving a very woody and smokey flavor, i feel like i should be exhaling smoke after drinking this. nice thick rich mouthfeel. very enjoyable for a type i don't usually drink."
"This is a very dark ruby beer, closer to black than red on a color sectrum. Decent sized light tan head, although somewhat smaller than expected, and leaves minimal lacing. The aroma consistes mainly of roasted malt with a subtle light burnt/smoke smell. The taste follows the aroma: roasted malt, more chocolate in the flavor than aroma, and finishes with a hint of smoked malt. A balancing hop bitterness is detected in the finish as well. The body is slighly thin for the accompanying taste. A good, solid, and drinkable beer."
"Although not quite as overboard as some of Stone's other brews, this is a good, quality porter, and a good example of a fairly rare beer."
"Dark mahogany beer topped by a tan, long-lasting head. Mild, sweet malt aroma with a touch of hops. A very subtle smoky note as well. The taste is sweet and smoky, like a good southern barbeque sauce. Malt really makes its presence known, and the hops finsh it out with a nice bitterness on the finish. The aftertatse has a lingering smokiness to it. The mouthfeel is smooth and enjoyable. The drinkability of this really can't be beat. I'm amazed at the balanced, smooth character of this beer. This is truly a treat. A bomber may not be enough of this one. Pick up a case for your next cookout."
"This is a very good looking porter. Very dark, with a nice head and very good lacing. The aroma is mostly of burnt wood. It has a very nice taste. The taste is dominated by burnt toffe. Mildly bitter aftertaste. A very drinkable and typically tasty Stone brew."
"A very good example of a difficult brew, not too sweet or smokey. It would work well with smoked/grilled food."
"A little carb bite on the tongue and good mouthfeel. A solid beer!"
"Originally sampled on 29 December 2001. This rich porter has elements of smoke, chocolate & coffee in it. It is definitely a sipping beer. Sit back in your easy chair and spend some time with this beauty. Be sure to have it at cellar temperature, Not ice cold!!"
"Impenetrably dark with spiderweb lacing. Chocolate and smoke aroma. The malts are huge, and the smoke is very light but it's tough to keep smoke from dominating a big slice of the flavor. I am also getting a lot of hop bitterness and dryness. Hardly any sweetness from the malts carries through, and the juicy hops leave it bitter and appetizing. A serious beer, and a good one at that."
"Stone's Smoked Porter pours a deep, dark brown with a thick, frothy head that retains well. Smell is big on roasted malt and, appropriately, smokiness. Taste is quite smoky, with a minor emphasis on hops, too. Mouthfeel is quite smooth and drinkability ranks high. A very good smoked porter and another solid effort from the folks in North County San Diego."
"Damn good beer. The best smoked porter I have tasted to date. Great dark brown color with a thick head. Nice hop flavor and aroma. A slightly sweet taste with a smoked flavor (as expected) that leaves a great aftertaste in your mouth. Smooth as it goes down. Overall a great beer."
"I dunno whats happening to me but im becoming a Stone freak..god help me!"
"Pours a deep tan head over a clear dark brown liquid, ruby highlights. Light wisps of smokiness mingle with roasted malt makes for a quite appetizing nose. A basketful of flavors follows: light chocolate, coffee, roasted grain bitterness and a good amount of hoppiness, then some latent smokiness appears with an undercurrent of butteriness. Finishes with a bitter note...the smoke flavor accompanies, not dominates this super quaffable Porter. All blends together in perfect harmony."
"Nice beautiful chocolate color with tan head that lingers and laces the glass. Smell is smoky with chocolate notes. Nice and creamy with a little bitterness but very well balanced. This is the best Stone product I've had thus far. A quality brew and better than most porters I've had."
"Pours out a dark brown with a medium tan head that hold its place for the entire sitting. Smoky aroma, the aroma that you get while sitting outside and the fire pit is going, smoke, roasted malts, smoke, roasted malts, smoke and roasted malts and a slight coffee. The taste had some chocolate and a little coffee, roasted malts and a smoked aftertaste but not overwhelming at all was hardly noticeable. This was a good tasting beer, drinkability was very smooth. I could sit in front of a fire and drink this throughout the night. Very good balance of flavors and no strong bitterness or aftertaste. This one's smoking"
"Drinkability: Good stuff. The smoke hangs in the background, playing back-up to the malt flavor, instead of taking over and ruining it. Another solid ale from Stone."
"Pours the deepest brown with garnet hues noticable when held up to the light. An ivory toned head fades fast to a cling-ring in no time. Smoky bitter chocolate malt aroma with hints of tobacco. Smooth & malty with bitter chocolate flavors. The smoky aroma isn't as strong in the flavor profile. A solid porter, but not outstanding. Finishes dry. Medium to full body with pleasant carbonation. Surprisingly average offering from Stone. Still a fine beer, but Stone has set the bar high and spoiled us so."
"The blurb on the back of the bottle suggests that this is Stone's ""least understood"" beer. Maybe so. In my judgment, it's better than some of their more acclaimed beers."
"This beer is very rich and full bodied. It is incredibly smooth and creamy. Chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts lead the way in the flavoring of this powerhouse porter. There is just enough smokiness to make it live up to its name. It is easy to drink, and impossible to pass by."
"The mouthfeel is thick, slick, and oily. Almost like chewing on something. Roasted bitter flavors arise from the start, with a big malty middle following that, with flavors of chocolate and coffee. Just a touch of hops are present to balance things out, and it did leave a bit of a smoky aftertaste. Definitely a damn good porter."
"At the first pour I was impressed with the deep brown color of the porter. Almost like burnt caramel, but not to dark like a stout. It remains translucent when held up to the light and the head is a nice rich tan color that leaves a clingy web down the sides of the glass. The aroma has a chocolatey coffee appeal to it, as does the flavor. This is a brew that has a body with substance, and it remains a remarkably smooth drink. I can easily see myself drinking this all night."
"Yet another great brew from the people at Stone, who have yet to let me down and are now my all time favorite brewery. This one poures a very dark brown, almost black with a small head that leaves decent lace around the glass. The smell reminded me of the Arrogant Bastard Ale but with a hint of smoke, chocolate and coffee added to it. The taste is right on: little bit of hop bite at the beginning, then the smoked flavor comes in along with a hint of malt and chocolate, and finishes with a crisp coffee flavor. This one would go great with some bar-b-q'd burgurs....awesome brew!"
"Well, Stone's is batting a 1000 with me so far. This is another very good brew that pleases all the way through. Very dark brown to black look with a somewhat smallish tan head, but a good degree of lacing left behind to remind you of what was. The taste is a very nice blend of smokey and roasted grains that give a sense of chocolate and coffe, but without overpowering the senses. This is another of the Stone's brews that gives good body in the mouthfeel, but which finishes with enough crispness as to not be wimpy creamy. Again I say, more, please."
"As a fan of Rauchbiers, I pretty much knew that I would enjoy this. The smokey flavor seems very appropriate for a porter. Rather then the smokey flavor dominating the taste like some of the Rauchbiers, it compliments the chocolate and coffee tastes of this porter. This beer really makes me wish that Stone was more available in PA."
"Comments: I was surprised and disappointed that I could not detect any smoky characteristics, but I enjoyed this nevertheless."
"Thick webby lacing riding off the tawny brown colour. Estery smoky aroma and malty nose. Spicy alcohol flavour with a smoke charcoal malt in the middle. Big maltiness with a light hop balance, some mellow chocolaty malt flavours in the end with a lingering faint smoke. Good stuff on tap and one of the better porters on tap I have had, bring it on."
"I like this smoked porterit tastes more like meat than other smoked beers Ive tried and the peanut flavor was kinda fun, not to mention unusually compelling."
"The unusual tar tinted dark brown color requires careful examination. The full smoky (not overly so) malt is the star of the show. The fairly high hops with light a metallic and somewhat grapefruity bitterness deserve some attention as well. Lightly sweet with a dry edged body. A hint of dark chocolate and coffee offer contrasting flavors to offset both the malt sweetness and hop bitterness. A smoky edge is more apparent in the aroma than in flavor. A light hop floral bouquet and sweet malt give way to a comforting smokiness. The beige/tan head dissipates at its own slow pace then lingers as fine lace. Flavors merge, blend and congenially mingle together. Well Done!"
"All of Stone's beers make me grin like a fool. I just sit there, sipping, marveling in the complexity. Then I see how much is left in that big brown bottle and grin and grin and grin. But, unlike the other Stone beers, this one won't knock you on your butt. An excellent quiet evening beer."
"Huge 22oz. bomber, pours with an very dark ruby almost opaque black in color, with a moccha toned nicely constructed head. The aroma is mainly of darker roasts with a background of a smokey screen in the aroma. The flavor is has mild cocoa notes along with roasted barley all wrapped up in a wonderful rauch style smoked. Leaves a nice dryness on the tongue, I am guessing this beer goes really well with a nice juicy steak. Very good porter, if just getting into rauchbier this is a nice one to start with, very mild smoke taste and aroma. All together very well done, everything is tied together to form a complete full flavor. A medium to light bodied porter, this beer definitely turns the tongue into a desert, very dry mouthfeel. All in all very drinkable smoked porter, but even with my love for Stone this is a dinner beer for me. Not a beer for chilling at the bar and drinking one right after another, but a very enjoyable experience none the less."
"Drinkability: I'm not a fan of smoke-flavored beers. However, this was not a bad beer to drink. I let it warm quite a bit from the first to last taste and it certainly got better towards the end. The smoke flavor is not overpowering and really complements the other flavors."
"An excellent, balanced porter from Stone, not as ""in-your-face"" as some other Stone brews, which is fine by me."
"Poured a great dark color, even the head was dark. And surprise! No overwhelming hops. It had all kinds of great porter tastes, chocalate, caramel, etc. I liked this beer almost too much, craving it like an addict. A definite solid beer, worhty of stone."
"Really wasn't all that smokey for a beer that has the word smoked in it's title. Poured out very dark with a nice head. Tastes very mellow for a stone brew. Feels good in the mouth and good in the stomach. A quite good porter with a hint of smoke. Mmmmm... Stone."
"Pour is a dark, ruby-tinged brown. Thick, rocky tan head, medium diminishing, and leaving excellent lace. Aroma is roasted malt, hints of some fruits, and light smoke. Flavor starts quite sweet, middle gets more of the bitter roasted flavor, and ends with some light smoke and bitter chocolate. The hops show up a bit in the end as well."
"A very tasty brew, the 22 oz. bomber just wasn't enough, I really need more of this beer! Thanks to JohnnyP for bringing me my first Stone beer."
"Cheers"
"Very dark brown in color, almost black, but with clear ruby and mahogany highlights visible at the base of the glass. It's frothy tan head holds quite well. It keeps a creamy collar and thin surface covering throughout the glass, and leaves good lace as well. The nose is quite enticing, with a chocolate and caramel base that's enhanced by a soft peat-smokiness. The smoke is just enough to add to, and enhance, the aroma of the beer. The body is medium/full, creamy, and velvety smooth in the mouth. The flavor, much like the aroma and mouthfeel, is quite smooth and round. This beer is exceptionally well balanced in all regards. It's softly sweet with a combination of milk chocolate and caramel, a light touch of smoke, a supportive bitterness and some background hop flavors. It finishes with a lingering roastiness, mild smokiness, and dull bitterness followed by some light, grassy hop flavor. Although the subtle smoke gets lost in the flavor over the course of the glass, it remains in the nose. Very nicely done, and highly drinkable with just enough smoke to give it a little bit of complexity and keep it interesting throughout one or two. Except for it's strength, this would make a very nice session beer. Highly recommended."
"Expected this to be a bit more thick, with maybe a little more ""Smoke"" to speak of. No doubt the tamest of the Stone brews i've tried, this is still a good porter. Good malted milk flavors to add to the above review."
"Try with Moderato's smoked leg of lamb (done in a Texas smoker)"
"Black with a touch of amber, if you hold it up to the light, and a thin but persistent head. Aroma of chocolate, a touch of coffee, and a light touch of smoke. The flavor begins with coffee and a bit of chocolate... with some spicy and slightly bitter hops blending in. The smoke flavor complements the beer very well, but in no way overpowers it. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, with a medium body and low carbonation. A very well done beer."
"[22 oz. bottle for $3.99]"
"After trying some of Stone's other offerings I expected an over the top, smoky, thick porter on the imperial side. What I found was a very nice, medium bodied, roasty porter that was tasty and very drinkable. To me the smokiness was negligible, but this didn't detract from it's merits as a decent brew, in fact it was one of the better porters around, just not quite what I expected. A nicely balanced beer with plenty of bittersweet chocolate and coffee and a subtle hop bite in the finish. Another fine Stone brew."
"Very balanced taste. Dark malt (yet without that deep roasted bitterness..spot on for a porter) and sweeter malt with enough hops to keep the sweetness in check. The mouthfeel is lush and medium-bodied. A subtle smokiness comes through in the finish and sticks around on your palate, very nicely done."
"I'm not an experienced drinker of smoked Porters so I have little basis for comparison. I like the look of the beer. Nice and dark with a decent head. The aroma was subtle and I tried to pick up the smokiness but really couldn't. Mostly it smelled like a pale ale just not as hoppy and citrusy.The beer has a nice velvety mouthfeel but was a lot crisper than I thought it would be. I expected either chocolatey or bitter or both. I was a little disappointed in the amount of smoke in the taste (after all this was my first experience with a smoked beer). It was there but very faint and in the background. I should say that I'm a huge Stone fan so I hold their beers up to a very, very high standard. This beer was good but not as rich and smokey as I would have liked. I drank it cold (right out of the 'fridge) and perhaps too cold. I think I'll try it again when the weather gets brutally cold and I'll let the beer warm up to closer to room temperature"
"This porter pours a deep rich black with garnet highlights. The head is a light carmel color with lots of staying power. The aroma is malty with notes of smoke and dried fruit. The taste starts smooth with plenty of malt flavor and finishes with a smokey bite and an aftertaste of hop spiciness and smoke. The mouthfeel is quite velvety and smooth. A very enjoyable porter. The smokiness is balanced with the sweetness of the malt quite well. Personally I wish there was a little more umph (sp?) to it. I feel like I have been teased in that it left me expecting more than I got. None the less this is a very nice porter. Has potential to be a great porter."
"Very dark, almost black in color with a 1/4 inch tan head. Robust and full bodied but not over powering. The smoke is well balanced with the rest of the beer. There are hints of chocolate in the beginning that give way to the smoke flavor. Redbones has this on tap and I can't wait!"
"Pours dark brown to black and somewhat opaque. Brownish head. Aroma is of smoke and roasted malts. Taste is of chocolate and coffee and of course smoke. The smoked malts really give this beer character and a unique flavor. Fairly heavy for a porter. IMO, Stone's is a little heavier and maybe a little sweeter than the Alaskan Smoked Porter. Personally, I prefer the Alaskan slightly over the Stone, but take your pick, they are both exceptional beers. I'm beginning to hold Stone Brewing in very high regard."
" Very complex brew with a great taste!"
"It poured into the glass a very dark brown/red in color. The head was a creamy light chocolate in color and very thick. And the lace seemed to last to the end of the glass. The aroma is deep malt, lightly smoked, caramel, and even a hint of coffee and elements of chocolate. The taste is of a sweet malt, caramel hints of coffee/chocolate and smoke. It is nicely hopped, and I really enjoyed the smoke qualities in this beer."
"This marvelous creation looks black as night and even if you hold it up to the light, you can barely see the  outline of the lightbulb with some reddish highlights. First sip starts out with a slickness coupled withfaint chocolate flavors that turns into roasted coffee like flavor in the middle. The lingering aftertaste is very dry and roasted. After my first swallow, I was wondering where the smoke flavor was, then about 10 seconds later it kicks in and is very nice - not overpowering at all. After each swallow the flavors just seem to last in your mouth forever."
"Hmm., better pack Two Bottles of this in tomorrows lunchbox."
"This is everything I look for in a porter, elements of chocolate, caramel, coffee, and a nice smoked malt taste.  It pours a nice deep brown with nice amount of head.  Smooth rich taste leaves me wishing I had another."
"As deep as garnet gets, before we call it brown, the head is ""Chocolate", frothy, long lasting; the lace clings in thick sheets till the very bottom of the glass. Nose is deep malt, lightly smoked, sweet, caramel, and even a hint of coffee. Front is sweet malt, the top is medium to full, the finish is of course ""Smokey", nicely hopped, light to moderate carbonation, dry, and a nice long lasting bitter after taste. Call me a ""Stone-o-phile", but I like the over the top hops, high ABV, big malts and that robustness, only found in a few brewers beers, such as ""Alesmith""."
"The beer pours a deep dark color with a thick head. I was a bit disappointed with lack of smoke in the aroma. Being a Stone brew, I expected to be overwhelmed with a smokey aroma that would bring back memories of camping. With the lack in aroma, it is made up for in taste. You can taste the smoke, but it doesn't overwhelm you. This is probably the worst Stone brew I've had, but that doesn't make this a bad beer. I wouldn't have any problems buying this beer again. I just expected more out of this beer coming from a great brewer like Stone."
"Almost completely opaque. Light brown head composed of tiny bubbles that stays pretty well. Quite a bit in the nose, lots of smoked peaty malt, chocolate, and caramel backed by leafy hops. As for the taste, the expected smoked grain. This is most apparent with retro-olfaction, but is definitely a big presence throughout. Lots of roasted grain and dark chocolate, very bittersweet up front. Leafy and slightly rind-like hops come out more in the back, but are subtle and balance perfectly with the malt. Very slight fruitiness, plum-like. Perfectly smooth and creamy mouthfeel. I'm a big fan of smoked beers, and this one is amazing. I am very impressed, I love this beer. I bow to the great gargoyle."
"Very full-bodied ale, with a slightly sweet finish.  This is a very drinkable brew -- it was difficult for me to wait for the beer to warm up a bit, but well worth it!  Tastes best when just slightly cool."
"Up to now, I've liked every Stone beer I've had the chance to try.  This was almost true for the Smoked Porter, but it is the defining character, the smoke, that turned me off.  Beautiful to behold in the glass.  The nose was a surprising sweet, thin chocolate.  Up front, a very nice robust porter.  Then the smoke flavor emerged at the end, and I found it to be a disconcerting stale bar-smoke like flavor, rather than a peat or wood smoke.  Had this been a straight porter, I think I would have loved it."
"Another great beer from Stone. This one is not as edgy as Arrogant Bastard but still unique. Very dark color with a thin and lasting beige head. The aroma is smokey of course. Medium body, and the smoked flavor was not overpowering and complemented the malt perfectly. Slight bitter chocolate in the aftertaste. Well done."
"Virtually black in hue, w/ deep garnet aorund the rim when held to light.  Persistant beige head leaves loose lace.  Chocolate malt, carob, butterscotch, dark caramel and smooth black patent comprise the aroma, while smokey peated malt is surprisingly subdued.  Quite appetizing aromawise.  The malt profile is very smooth & lacks any black patent sharpness, allowing mellow chocolate and dark caramel malt to provide a flavorful base sweetness.  Hop bitterness, although secondary, counters this sweetness well, lending an overall cleanly bittersweet chocolate profile.  The use of peated malt is conservative but adequate enough to add a pleasant smokey undertone.  Moderately bodied, w/ a dextrinous and enjoyable mouthfeel.  Finishes very clean, w/ chocolate flavors abruptly ending but light peat smoke briefly lingering.  This is a tasty, well balanced and highly drinkable porter-- It's perhaps the most subtle brew by Stone I've had.  Agreeably mellow."
"Pours almost as black as black can be, only the barest hints of light getting around the edge.  The brew has a nice brown head on it to start but once that fades there is no lace at all and no more head.  Huge roasted coffee, chocolate, and smoke aromas dominate.  Starts off like a straight up porter with some nice bitter coffee and roasted malt flavors before fading into a bittersweet dark chocolate taste.  The porter taste fades and the beer appears to be done but then a huge smoked quality comes in and slaps you in the face.  Smooth and creamy, this is one seriously drinkable beer.  Damn these guys know what they are doing.  A big thanks to Greg and Co. for making these beers."
"Good stuff, Bighuge.  Thanks alot!"
"The flavors in some order (changes sip to sip) - citrus hop; an oiliness similar to that found in an oatmeal stout; smoky maltiness; chocolatey maltiness; roasted coffee maltiness.  Take the late, lamented Big Indian Porter, subtract some of the malt, add in hops & smoke, and you have this beer. This is NOT a bad thing at all. The finish is very nice - a little sweet, with some smoky-roasty-dry malt overtones."
"It's close to black with a surprisinlgly strong tan head.  Even after it warmed, it gave off only a slight smell, with the smoke just barely detectable.  The smoke flavor is also subtle with lots of nice roasty malt swimming around.  Drinking it is a bit like chewing on a little bit of black patent and chocolate malt."
"It's a cross between the smell of your clothes the morning after you stayed up late staring into the campfire and stale cigarette smoke. That's the dominate aspect of the character, or at least the middle anyway. The beginning is more a good porter, warm and malty without crossing into stout territory. The ending is bitter hops with the lingering stale smoke. Actually, given the almost pitch black color and tan head of this beer, I'm surprised the malt doesn't play a stronger role in the flavor of this beer. This would be excellent with grilled pork or some of the smokier barbeque I've had."
"261"
"Huge rocky head...great soft smoked aroma..very very dark burgandy...sweet on the buds with a smokey accent..not overbearing smokiness though(about right)..a bit sweet/syrupy mouthfeel...almost some java tones..very good but in the the same league as Alaskan Brewings' Smoked Porter."
"The beer has a nice dark color to it when you pour, plus a nicely colored head to accent it.  The smell is rather interesting, since I usually don't drink smokey beers.  It is lighter than other porters.  The taste is good and interesting do to the smoky aspect of it.  Worth a try."
"Dark ruby witha beautiful thick head that has good retention.  Smoked salmon and jerky on the nose.  Medium body.  Slick mouthfeel.  Light smoked jerky on the palate.  Chocolate and coffee tones also present.  Some good roasty tones too.  I like this one.  The only better smoked porter I've had is from Alaskan."
"Fairly light bodied porter.  Lightly smoked flavor with little other distinctive character.  Not the best, but one of the more drinkable smokers on a quantity basis."
"As with all Stone beers, the Smoked Porter is top shelf. However, it is not really smoked enough for my taste. A smoked porter is a weird idea anyway, because you are already using so many burnt grains. Rogue makes a smoked beer that really tastes smoky. Very yummy. This one, a good porter, but not smoky enough."
