4.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.75,5,4.75,"First pour is amber brown, quickly becomes almost purely opaque, dark as night. A solid 1-inch mocha head forms, featuring 100s of tiny bubbles, and while it doesn't stick around forever, it manages to retain itself quite well with lots of sticky lacing. While this should have been drunk when it was much more fresh, the nose still produces ample roast coffee & cocoa notes, leaving no doubt to the sweet nature of the brew. Flavor-wise, it features the perfect amount of sweetness, reminds me of the hint of vanilla soy from a Starbucks drink, closing in on mocha rich. Finish produces that moderately bitter coffee bite, but it all works, in fact, it's perfect. On top of all that, the mouthfeel is unparalleled for a non-BA, sub-8%, porter. Incredible beer. Quite likely the best ""regular"" porter I've ever had.","markgugs","Jan 29, 2015"

Taste shows cranberry, dark malts and a really robust dark malt profile, smooth coffee and dark chocolate provoke, a gentle carbonation from the growler. A lingering finish with citrus rind, piny forest with a herbal edge. Very full body with a really rich creamy mouthfeel but also a quite assertive bitterness. Espresso, licorice, black molasses, grapefruit citrus, smoky woody character matched by a creamy body and an upfront bitterness. A very flavourful porter, and matched by its great body and balance, delicious and certainly of the most aromatic and well made porters I've tried.","mick303","Nov 23, 2014"

4.25,-6,,,,,,"Bottle.  Dark brown with a mocha head.  Nice roasted malt aromas.  Easy drinking with a really good mouthfeel and body.  Rich roasted malt notes with mellow caramel, chocolate, toffee, and expresso undertones.  Honestly, I prefer an imperial stout to a porter 99 out of 100 times.  However, this is a very fine ale and an exception to the rule.  One quick side note, this bottle had a bit of age on it so the hop characteristics were diminished.  This is one HF beer that lives up to the hype...","dboon","Sep 19, 2014"

Smell was subtle roast malt with hints of chocolate. The taste in awesome... decadently sweet chocolate with balanced flavor from the roast malts. The columbus hops also keep the chocolate sweetness from being too overpowering. Easily my favorite porter.","Dawgboned37","Jul 27, 2014"

Solid malt nose with heavy dark chocolate and medium roasted coffee smell with a sugary sweet end. Almost a sugar in the raw smell. Taste is magnificent. All of the smells are present in the flavor. Light to no carbonation. Rich smooth feel with an even smoother finish. Aftertaste is an exquisite mocha coffee like blend. This beer smacks me in the face with how good it is.

Super thick and smooth on the palate with loads of chocolate malt, it’s sweet up front with a bittersweet finish. There is substantial lacing on the glass. Coffee flavors are very present, even though no coffee was used. At 7.5%, the alcohol is well-hidden. I think I am drinking this too fast, - it’s that good. This beer has incredible body for a porter and has an almost oily quality…it could easily pass for a stout. The bitterness from the chocolate malts and Columbus hops really gives it its character. This is an intense porter, but everything comes together magically and produces one of the best porters I've had to date.","greenmtn1111","Jul 23, 2013"

The nose gives roasty malts and robustness off the bat, with the taste following suite wonderfully. The latter actually was much more rich than expected, with toffees and caramels giving more thickness, sweetness, and flavor across the taste. This was helped along by a silky smooth feel that left the mouth coated, but also asking for more. The sip was smooth, and everything was really inviting about this beer, making it second in the line of Hill Farmstead beers that we’ve been impressed with. Fantastic for the style, deep, and contemplative.","TheBrewo","Jun 26, 2013"

Color was a very very dark brown that was almost black and was completely opaque. Came out a bit on the thicker side. Aroma was slightly sweet, but a bit burnt as well. Almost like a burnt mocha with just a hint of malt. Flavor was very similar to the smell. Seemed like a roasted grain, with some sweetness from lactose. A small hint of bitter on the backend, but very balanced. Felt very good in the mouth. Coated extremely well, with a bit of tingle from carbonation. Overall a very smooth and well balanced beer Pleasant to drink, perhaps a bit to sweet to be sessionable.","mountdew1","Jun 25, 2013"

True, those are lower ABV, but I preferred the less bitter approach taken by them. With time, however, I came to appreciate the boldness of this beer. It is very smooth, an indication of the attention to detail paid by HF. It is complex, not sure I would call it ""decadent"" in its depth though. All told, I'm not sure if this is my fave porter, but it is damn close. More impressive than Eddy FItz out of the bottle (I'd hope so, at $8 a pop).","StoutItOutLoud","May 26, 2013"

Flavor follows suit with a good earthy roasted character, a strong cocoa flavor, nice bits of coffee nib, and a sweetness I'm surprised at that is transient in nature and does not linger. Great flavor. Full bodied with tight and sharp carb loosely scattered, this leaves your mouth coated and satisfied, yet wanton for the next sip.

Nose is wet tobacco, chili pepper, hazelnut liquor similar to De Molen Heaven & Hell. Taste has some salty chocolate bacon, savory umami, deep and rich baker chocolate and spicy chili pepper.

Overall this beer is decent in my opinion, I'm not really a fan of smoked flavors but I think for people who are this beer is awesome for them. I was happy to have tried it.","Knapp85","Sep 30, 2012"

4.15,-8.2,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"not sure about all the hype around this one. on tap at the farmhouse tap in burlington. pours thick dark brown color, blacker than molasses, but with similar viscosity. short tan head rests atop but fades fast. it smells smokey and earthen, curious malt profile, and maybe some black pepper. its a unique aroma to say the least. the flavor is also quite different from other porters ive has, it starts kind of boozy and mellows into a rich malt roast and there is that pepper like flavor again. the finish is thin and empty in feel, but full of flavors of cocoa and tobacco. so hard to place this one. the booze is not well hidden in my opinion and it felt a bit strong. mouthfeel is right on, its bigger than a lot of porters in body, but it drinks nice and smooth, not weighty at all. it went well with the rare lamb burger, but i certainly didnt think this was the best porter ive ever had. that pepper flavor in the middle is still confusing me though... ill have to try this again in another setting.","StonedTrippin","Aug 27, 2012"

Dark brown pour with mahogany tints around the edges, nice finger-plus of fluffy tan head that receded to a thin layer, leaving nice quad-style lacing on the glass. Roasty aroma, scents of dark malts, coffee, toasted grains. Robust and hearty! The taste followed the aroma pretty spot-on, roasted dark malts, pumpernickel, smooth coffee, hearty toasted grains, and just enough brown sugar sweetness to take off whatever edge might have been caused by the dominant roastiness, without offsetting the overall equilibrium. Nice heavy-medium body, tremendously drinkable. Had to bring a 750ml growler home from the source. I don't believe a porter can get any better than this. No nonsense.

The taste follows pretty closely, with the roast coming in darker, more charred. and the coffee, though still subdued compared to the other elements, coming in a tad darker and more acrid. Everything melds nicely, though, with nothing taking any real stage time from anything else. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and an ever-so-slightly dry finish.

4.36,-3.5,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"One of the better porters I have had recently, truth be told, I'm a fan of bitter dark beers so I can see some not agreeing who like the sweeter more caramelized styles. Russian River's Porter is still perhaps the beer that I find to be my favorite representation of the style but Everett will be one I hope to drink many more times in the future. Truly delicious.","Bardwashrind","Sep 20, 2011"

While its` taste has more of those roasted malts, some flora hops, coffee again, bread and a little vanilla. MF is med-full with a dry finish to it.

Of course Hill Farmstead is the brewery that revived this style for me, and now I can't wait to have more. Thank you for ruining porters at the same time, because I know no other porters will be as great as this one.","starrdogg","Aug 29, 2011"
4.77,5.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,5,"Oh dear. This is the best American porter I've had in recent memory. Pours a near black with a large mocha head with impressive lacing and retention. Aroma is complex and subtle, a blend of chocolate, roast malt, coffee, dark fruit, mild bitterness, and smoke. Flavor is similar, with roast and smoke providing a strong backbone for the sweet chocolate and dark fruit. Medium thick, with soft full bodied and soft carbonation. Edmund used to be my favorite American Porter. Now Everrett is.","yourefragile","Aug 29, 2011"
4.97,10,4.5,5,5,5,5,"thick black as night opaque oil color with a nice two inch head that ever so slowly faded and stayed at about a half inch until the bottom. Very nice thick lace down the sides, gooey and creamy, very nice look to it. Smell took a while to warm up, at first was strong alcohol and caramel sweetness. As it warmed some more subtle smells started to come through, hints at chocolate and coffee started to overtake, and the alcohol quickly faded, leaving a very nice overall aroma. The taste followed the smell with the caramel hitting first. Nice flavors of coffee followed, maybe even a hazelnut hint in there, well rounded.","mikesgroove","Aug 19, 2011"

4.75,5.1,4.5,4.5,5,4,5,"Thanks to Sean for this fresh growler. Nice dark/black with minimal carbonation with minimal head and nice lacing. The smell is roasty, chocolate, light buttery, syrupy light molasses or maple not sure which. The taste is thick, rich, oaky, leathery, and smoky. Great porter. Great mouthfeel and carbonation. This and Captain Lawrence porters are top of this class. I've had this in bottle and growler a few times and it never fails to impress. If you like porters, this is a must have and even better readily available.","spycow","Jul 09, 2011"

4.2,-7.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Everett (never name your kids this) came to me looking porterish with a dark shoe shine polish brown look with blackness creeping in. A nice whisp of head up top with slotz of lace here and there. Smell is malt ridden with some smoke and coffee beans underlined with some dark fruit and peat. Taste is a robust porter, this one screams malts and shows em off to. Roasty malt, Smoky malt and probably some others. The coffee comes through and some cocco powder and even a little vanilla under all of that. This is what a porter should be, no bells and whistles. Feel was stepping up from medium and it was just dank, I cant explain it any other way. I coulda drank a shit ton of this.","BARFLYB","Jun 03, 2011"

Aroma is outstanding, the epitome of what a porter should smell like, perfect coffee, a hint of alcohol, and dark fruits, simply perfect... The taste is equally perfect. Only thing that I wish it had was smoke to come to close to the Captain Lawrence Imperial Smoked porter. Roasted coffee with hints of chocolate, a slightly bitter finish.
