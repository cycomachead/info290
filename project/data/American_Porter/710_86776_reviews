"Miserable attempt at what could have been something decent."
"Good Porter with ample vanilla, but just isn't complex or tasty enough to be elite."
""
"Smooth and rich in flavor. Distinct chocolate and roasted nature with a tinge of vanilla undertone. Very good balance in incorporating vanilla without overdoing it"
"Feel: Warm and creamy but overall OK."
"Underrated."

"very smooth beer for being so dark,good vanilla flavors"

"This beer is good if you are into Vanilla. Since I am not that into Vanilla I can only say that the beer was ok. I am glad it was given to me in a mixed 6."
""
"Good winter porter, has lots of flavor, and you smell the vanilla without it overpowering the rest of the beer. This beer is definitely not for everyone"
"Overall : I really wanted to like this beer. It's pretty much the most boring Porter and possibly the most boring beer I've had. Note - I didn't say ""worst", I said boring. It's worth a try but don't expect much excitement."
"I had the chance to try this on tap a few nights ago, and it was excellent. The combination of sweetness and just the faintest bitter taste was worth every drop."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 3/17/2014. Pours crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of milk chocolate, vanilla, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light nuttiness, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and vanilla notes; with decent strength. Taste of milk chocolate, vanilla, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light cocoa, light nuttiness, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Minimal roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, vanilla, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light cocoa/nuttiness, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Good balance, complexity, and solid robustness of dark/bready malt and vanilla flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth and lightly creamy mouthfeel that is okay. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a solid vanilla porter. All around good balance, complexity, and solid robustness of dark/bready malt and vanilla flavors; and very smooth to drink. Definitely very toned down for a porter, but the flavors were quite nice and balanced. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."
""
""
"12oz bottle into shaker. Pours clear deep red-brown with a finger of tan head that quickly collapses leaving minimal lacing. Aroma limps in with vanilla, coffee, roasted malt, and a touch of cocoa. Flavors follow the nose with medium vanilla sweetness and a light hop bitterness cutting through the maltiness. Medium-light bodied, with a thin texture, average carbonation, and a bit of an astringent finish."
""
""
""
""
"Creamy, somewhat soapy head, doesn't stick around very long. Dark brown with some red. More translucent than opaque. Very light hints of vanilla on nose, more overpowered by maltiness. Vanilla more readily apparent on tongue, with background notes of cherries, milk chocolate, brown sugar and a fleeting hint of raspberries. Carbonation floods the tongue then fades away fairly quickly. Creamy and smooth feel, almost chewy. Somewhat hard to discern that it is 6% abv. Tastes lighter to me. Overall, a decent dessert beer. Nothing to write home about, but palatable and pleasant. Would taste good on vanilla ice cream!"
""
"Not A fan of this beer at all,!!!!"
""
"Really dark brown, almost black with a creamy off-white head. Smells like a pretty average porter, it also tastes like a pretty average porter. Did not taste like a ""Vanilla Porter"" in my opinion"
""
""
""
""
"overall it is a great effort in Leiny's stable of flavored beers.  It is a good representation of porter style. Not an everyday beer but it is something I make a point to have a few of every winter."
""
""
""
"Cheers"
""
"This is NOT okay. It's plain bad!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Light vanilla sweetness with a dry chocolate malt, not much else but not offensive. I get some brownie batter later as the vanilla becomes more prominent. Typical Leinenkugels beer with significant weakness but decent taste."
""
""
""
""
"I have never known Leinenkugel to make a bad beer, and this is no exception. However there are probably better options for porter/stout beer fans. So I gave it a 3.75 all around. If this was a beer someone homebrewed, it would be incredible, but I expect more from large breweries."

"Overall:  As I said above, this beer is a little disappointing, in that there is nowhere near the amount of vanilla present that I believe there should be.  As a regular porter, it’s pretty decent, possessing some good roasted malt and slight smoke flavors balanced with some nice caramel-like sweetness, but as its advertised as a vanilla porter, and because it has very little vanilla in it, I find it to be very disappointing.   If I’m in the mood for a vanilla porter, I’ll grab either the one made by Breckenridge or Ballast Point’s Victory at Sea, both of which are infinitely better beers."
"Overall: great dessert beer in the colder months, lives up to its name. Would suggest to any vanilla fan"
""
""
""
""
"Very solid offering. I like the vanilla influence here. Smooth and creamy."
"This is one of the better porters I have had at this price range. Definitely something I would buy again. That said there are better ones out there. The only complaint I would have is that it has a bit of an aftertaste."
""
"Like someone added chocolate to a Coors Light."
""
""

""

""

""

"Overall: Tastes of vanilla at first then toffee and porter follow.  Good winter brew."
"Had this on tap at a pub that was out of stout. Think root beer; sweet, thin, limited cream- colored head that quickly dissipates with minimal lacing."
""
""
"Fantastic beer. I highly recommend."
"overall great beer"
"Pretty good, nice smooth bear with good taste"
"I could definitely see myself buying this beer for someone who might not be into porters at all as it is a nice segway beer. However, I probably won't get it for myself anytime soon."
"Didn't have much flavor to it at all. Drinkable but not very good."
"Another well made beer.. Nice and smooth.. Great vanilla flavor! And at 6% no alcohol detected. A winner.. And a great transition beer!"

"I had this as a draft and cannot justify the look of the beer because I had it in a bar glass"
""
"Overall - 2.25/5: Disappointing, to say the least. But am I surprised? No, I was just curious how badly they'd screw up a porter, and they at least did that quite well. I have no problems with the beer you're making, just don't market it as something beer fans would enjoy. Because it's not beer."

"Vanilla and beer just don't go together."
"Not bad. Kind of a watery mouth feel."
""
""

"Tasted from draft pour. The feel of this beer was water-like:  thin, unsatisfying, and pretty much lifeless. I was supremely disappointed. Would never consider it again."
"This was really good smooth tasting."
""
""
""
"O-a very sessionable beer, well balanced, unlike some of the other vanilla brews out there.  If it had more body, and maybe a little more toffee in the flavor profile, this could be a winner."
""
""
"Smelled like it had potential.  Weak and watery in the mouth.  Not impressed."
"Very dark, almost creamy. Not too heavy for as dark as it is."
"I'm not the biggest fan of sweeter beers but this one was too sweet and didn't have a full flavor. It was a bit bland."

"Update: I read online that Snowdift is in fact the *replacement* for Fireside Nut Brown -- a merciful coup!"

"Pours a dark ruby red that looks like black. Khaki head that disappears quickly. Hardly any lacing. Smells of vanilla extract and coffee beans. Taste follows the smell but is very weak. Feels very light. I think it's a porter for people that don't like craft beer. If you have actually had a legit porter you'd probably think this is like ""porter light"". Sorry to be pretentious but it wasn't great. I'd drink it for free but wouldn't pay for it."
"Pretty much what you would expect. It's got it's highs and lows but at the end of the day it's a one and done for me."
"Very cozy, tasty porter.  Recommend"
"Great tasting and subtle vanilla flavor. Perfect for the season."

"Leinenkugel's Snowdrift Vanilla Porter brewed by Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company, with an ABV of 6.0%  This brew pours out dark brown color with a nice off white head.  Snowdrift Vanilla Porter has the look of cola, not saying that's a bad thing. The smell is rich with malts and grains.  You also pick up on a hit of vanilla. Now for the taste, it is bold with flavor. You also pick up on tossed malts and grains.  There is also a mild vanilla sweetness at the end.  Leinenkugel's Snowdrift Vanilla Porter has a lot going on. The mouthfeel is bold but smooth. There is nothing overpowering in this brew, it has a nice balance to it.  Overall I'm giving  Leinenkugel's Snowdrift Vanilla Porter  a 4 out 5.  Nothing bad about this brew.  I would buy this brew again.  Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company did a nice job with this brew."

"This is definitely not the greatest porter in the world, and I agree with others that it is fairly watery, and that means the taste comes off muted, but the vanilla sweetness is not bad, and overall, I would say that this is an acceptable beer.  I would drink it again if I didn't have better choices."

"Part of a great sampler pack found at the local supermercado, containing actually four brews of which I have tried none!  That said let's give it a whirl.  Popping the top I get a deep roasted waft with vanilla undertones.  Pours into the SAPP to an opaque motor oil color with a twofinger tan head that recedes to one finger.  On the taste the brew starts with a toasted flavor very quickly followed by a sweet and barky vanilla stomp.  Mouthfeel seems a bit thin and the vanilla a bit overpowering, making it taste more like a Mr. Pibb than a vanilla flavored porter.  Much too sweet without any pronouned bite to take the edge off.  Might taste better as a hot toddy."

"Taste starts off creamy with a touch of coffee, but goes south fast with a fake vanilla candy. There's a weird long orange aftertaste that reminds me of those chocolate oranges you get around the holidays. Other qualities are all okay: no bad smells or textures. Just the cloyingly sweet fake vanilla ruined it for me."

"Little to no head on this brew. Smells of vanilla and coffee. The first taste had a solid vanilla flavor and a slight bitterness. I tries to cleanse the palate with Cheetoes but wiped my hands on the drapes and caught them on fire. Would not burn down my house again for. 2.75/5"

"M/D- This is a smooth, full bodied beer that while it does have flavor, I don't feel that it delivers fully in what it is trying to be.  I don't hate it and would probably buy it again, especially at it's price point, but think this is a good intro into the style.  I'm sure there is better out there but at the same time I'm sure there is much worse!"

"Overall: This is an enjoyable porter and I'm glad I tried it. Would have another. Don't be scared off by the vanilla - but also don't expect it to be a dominant flavor."
"Serious contender with Trout River Rainbow Stout as one of the worst beers I have ever had. I have been to Wisconsin several times and noted the popularity of Leinenkugels. For the life of me I cannot grasp the loyalty of the name vs the quality of the beer. Granted they have great graphics but the beer just plain sucks. There are a lot of short cuts here. If you want to make good beer in high volume, contact InBev and maybe they will show you how Budweiser does it."

"Lighter on the palate then the typical porter. Notes of more milk chocolate, coffee cake and a whiff of vanilla. Not bad. Decent, lighter bodied, easy drinking and sessionable winter brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"An overly sweet porter in many ways and a bit disjointed in character. More sugary and syrupy tasting with a relatively weak, watery body. Drinkable but mediocre porter lacking a solid depth and complexity that would make it more memorable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall its not the worst porter ive had. I would rate this beer ok. Its a good choice if your at a store where there is not a whole lot of other craft choice. Its a 150% better choice than the BMC alternatives.."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In the end it's a fairly charming beer. I don't see it as having a lot of drinkability, but it's not cloying. It should make a great holiday beer, or as a special dessert beer."
"Bit hoppy but the aroma of this beer is what really brings you in."

"Overall, I would recommend it to those who like porters."

"I am still reeling from having de boom lowered on me, but The CANQuest (TM) must Glug on! The Crack! was loud enough to sound Reveille throughout the house and once everyone had heaved out and triced up, it was time for an inverted Glug. The dark beers really cry out for this as the pseudo-cascade is much more evident in them. It settled into a dense, two-finger cap of light-brown head with great retention. Color was a deep-brown with garnet/ruby highlights (SRM = > 37, < 44) and it was as beautiful a beer as I have seen in a while. Nose smelled of vanilla, coffee and chocolate and I may have had this in a different, hotter form at Starbucks at some point. Just sayin' ... Mouthfeel was pretty full for a porter and the vanilla and chocolate were prevalent initially, giving 'way to the coffee roastiness. I was happy to note that they reigned in the roasted malts as this could have been way too bitter. Instead, the flavors meshed nicely to provide a pleasant, but not overpowering, sweetness to the melange. I even enjoyed the relatively sweet finish although, as a self-avowed hophead, this is not my usual cuppa tea. Truth in advertising at its finest."
""
""
"O- an average porter....I have had better and worse."
""
""
""
"Over all this is one of my favorite offerings from Leinenkugel, it's a very easy drinking porter, perfect for any cold winter day...the relatively low alcohol content (6) makes it also easy to have several. I prefer it on tap over the bottle but bottles are cheaper than kegs ;) This is a seasonal beer, so it's will have a short window on the store shelves...I have a 12pk in my beer fridge, I don't want to run out to soon."

"O- Well I've had better porters for sure. This is not well balanced at all. I think they fell asleep when the hops were supposed to be added. Not a big fan of this version. Drinkable but I won't purchase this brew if other options are available."
""
""
"This beer looks and smells great. The beer has some bold flavors including chocolate and coffee. It has a little bit more sweetness than I would generally prefer in my beer; but the winter season only rolls around once a year, so it's easy to enjoy. If you haven't tried Leinenkugel's Vanilla Porter, I recommend that you do."
""
"This isn't bad. I think it's worth drinking, or at least trying once. The dark pour is inviting, and the remaining head lace is decent. The smell is also enjoyable with a roasted coffee and malt influence. You can also somehow smell something sweet in the background. The taste is a tad bit stronger, but is basically the same as the smell. It's a sweet, roasted coffee. I probably wouldn't get this again, but I'd certainly enjoy it and drink it again if offered one."

"Straight up, I do not like this beer. It's really hard to tell someone who really loves porters to drink a porter without holding it up to the standards of another porter but maybe, if I could, enjoy this beer with a different mindset. However, a friend of mine was raving about the vanilla flavor so I was surprised at the strong fruit flavor. Its very fruit forward with the strongest being cherry. It feels as though the ingredients were just mixed together and immediately bottles. The color also wasnt as dark and somewhat red tinged (or maybe that was my imagination). Lastly, it was definitely thin. I do want to try it again 'with a different mindset' but I dont have high hopes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drank this straight out of the bottle. The smell of the beer is very soft and faint almost non existent. However that being said the taste more than makes up for it. This beer has such a great balance of malts and the sweetness of the vanilla. There is little no no bitterness and is unlike any other porter i have ever had. I really enjoyed this one and would definitely recommend it."
""
""
"Overall - This is a very sessionable, light porter. I could have a few of these in one sitting with no problem at all. If you go in with an open mind, and not looking for the standard porter qualities in a beer, you'll probably be surprised at how tasty this beer is. I probably won't seek this out again, but if offered one or have limited options in a bar, this is an easy go to dark beer option."

"Overall not a bad beer, one of the best I have ever had from Leinenkugels'. Great price point as well. Will definitely be drinking many more of these."

"O - Snowdrift is a nice porter. The vanilla is pleasant and not at all overpowering. The taste has just enough complexity to be interesting."

"This vanilla porter is a little less vanilla- enhanced than I expected, but is still features an obvious vanilla taste that is pleasant overall. It doesn’t have that fresh, 100 percent natural vanilla taste and character common to other vanilla- enhanced craft beers, but it is still fairly good. It’s a nice beer to settle down with on a relaxing winter evening."
""
"Pours a very dark brown in color that you can barely even see through. About a 1-finger beige head that left some lacing when sipped. The aroma is of cocoa, and vanilla with a hint of caramel. Very smooth taste of vanilla & chocolate stands out and goes down very easily."

"Snowdrift would be better if the roasted porter notes did not seem so weird or artificial. It is too sweet and the vanilla just does not fit well. The beer needs a toastier and smokier base if it is going to use such sweet vanilla flavoring."
"Tastes similar, artificial vanilla, astringent coffee grounds, mellow porter roastiness. Feels a bit thin and watery. Overall the flavor is not bad, though a little hollow."

"Pours with a lighter viscosity than most porters out there, light khaki tinted head sits upon a dark black body with cola caramel brown highlights shining through. Aroma has an interesting mix of dark cocoa, hints of vanilla, and mild coffee accents from the dark roasted barley malts added to this beer. Flavor is dry and bitter with baker's chocolate, toasted malts, hints of soft sweet caramelized malt sugars, and a hint of vanilla character. The dark roasted malts has a bit of sour acidity from the dark malts or mix of creaminess from the vanilla and dark roasted malts nice mix of cocoa/coffee roasts in the malt character makes it, no alcohol presence weighs in at 6% abv. Pretty tasty crossover beer, makes a solid offering for winter and thank God it's not fizzy and yellow, or fruit/wheat infusion. They have done a nice jobs with their seasonal offering lately, keep it up Leinenkugel's!!! Mouthfeel has some nice creamy textures medium to light bodied for a porter but rock solid carbonation levels. Overall a welcomed addition to the Leinenkugel/MillerSAB family."

"This brew is a dark brown color, not quite black, with a fairly thick tan head. Decent lace. The aroma is dominated by vanilla. It doesn't have the notably artificial smell that a lot of vanilla flavored brews have, but it is nearly overdone. There is some roasted and malt flavors underneath. Not real hop smell. The taste is sweet, with more vanilla and malt. Smooth and creamy. Full and satisfying. It's a good, although not outstanding, beer."

"For the price this is a decent option for a darker beer. Normally, I'll drink from the bottle on my ""goto"" Sweet Josey Brown Ale. However, since this was a new taste for me, I poured into a pint glass. Being honest I was surprised and maybe even a little impressed. Darker than I thought and surprisingly good, but not the vanilla I anticipated. Overall, nice work Leinenkugel."

"O: Not a bad porter to be honest, has a decent flavor and mouth feel. The only thing that I didn't really like is the alcohol flavor that is very present throughout the entire time. The bitterness was just right and contributed to the maltiness to add a nice balance."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, better than I thought, with prominent vanilla in the flavor. Vanilla is a little on the sweeter side, but not too bad and mixes well with the malts. A fairly enjoyable porter right here."
""
"Atmosphere is good enough. Really nice head (and who doesn't like that), but no lacing. Nose is roasty, with bits of chocolate and a slight hint vanilla accentuate. Bitterness really overshadows anything else, but there is an almost synthetically sweet note. Overall, this is a decent quaff."

"Excellent beer. Great smell and color. The taste of vanilla is not overpowering and adds to the strong chocolate flavor. I was pleased this porter was not bitter, nor did it have a strong coffee flavor to it, as some porters of this kind(chocolate) tend to do. It has instantly become one of my winter favorites."
"Bottle to pint glass. My wife actually picked this one up looking to try something new and mild for herself. She's not a hophead and was willing to share it with me. Not much of a head nor any decent lace left behind. The vanilla is apparent, decent aroma. Taste was fine, sort of reminding me of root beer with less carbonation. Mouthfeel was good and aftertaste didn't linger much. Overall, I fine beer and I could drink a handful, no problem."
"O - A good solid offering by Leinenkugel. Its nothing fancy, but is tasty nonetheless. Will definately do in a pinch"

"Ends up being a very sweet beer, but just rich enough to hit the spot on a cold day. If you want a decent porter for the winter months, can't really go wrong here. Overall, I rate it just shy of outstanding."
"Apperently heaven smiled down upon Jacob Leinenkugel during the crafting of this porter. It is very thick and dark, and the vanilla is present but not overpowering. It doesn't complement ramen well, but that is to be expected."

"O – 3.5 – It's not amazing, but it's not that bad at all. Nice winter beer."
""
"What is not to like. The vanilla is not over-powering, the color is spectacular and the taste can't be beat. Tonight I am going to be drinking a lot of this one! Anything Leinenkugel's makes is going to be awesome and this is no exception. I wish I was drinking this right now!"
""
""
"Pours out to a beautiful tan head and will produce lace that hangs around with a little agitation. Clear deep ruby color. Aroma is vanilla extract and a non beerlike sweetness. Flavor is sweet and toasty combination that just lays there. Mouthfeel is medium and co 2 is good. Overall, not what I consider a good brew except for using in recipes or washing down a breakfast of French toast and sausage."
"Really didn't expect this to be as good as it is. Great for a session and great if your looking for something a little more complex than the general ""run of the mill"" but still simple enough for anyone to enjoy."

""

"Pours a very dark, almost black, red color with a small creamy head what fades quickly and leaves good lacing. Smells like malts with a hint of vanilla. Taste is outstanding with perfect balance of sweet and bitterness. I can taste the chocolate, vanilla, and coffee. A good medium bodied beer that leaves the slightly bitter aftertaste of dark chocolate. This is a very good beer. Wish I had another one!"

"O- I had this on tap at Bomber's Burritos in Schenectady last year and it paired well with my dinner. It was also good enough fro me to remember a year later as I saw this out and grabbed a bottle to refresh my memory. This is one of the best porters I have had. It is well balanced and easy to drink. It's low ABV makes it a great session ale and at around 15 bucks for a 12 pack, it's a steal! Try this beer if you like smooth, easy drinking stouts and porters."

"O - Had low expectations, expectations met."
"Overall one of the better Leine's offerings I have had. Lately I did go back and try the berry weiss which was disgusting so this if anything is at least more drink able."
""
""
""
"UPDATE: more than a small over-reaction. A fine seasonal and maybe the best lienenkugel, but nowhere in the ballpark of what I wrote back then"
"Overall: Initially I was anticipating a lot more vanilla notes in the taste and was surprised by an overload of caramel. Would pair excellently with meats or better yet, drank as a desert with some kind of chocolate or creamy food."
""
""
"12oz bottle. Deep clear ruby with a fizzy head of light mocha froth. Retention and lacing are poor with this eventually going pretty dead looking in the glass. Smells of cocoa, vanilla, acrid roast and some green citrus. The taste is cocoa, vanilla and a little toffee sweetness. Same acrid and burnt roastiness as the nose. A tingle of green hops runs down the center. The feel is lighter to medium bodied with a too thin and astringent presence in the mouth. Just a touch of sharpness at least adds a little something to this. This was a pretty weak Porter in all categories and I just didn’t care for it a whole lot. Next…"

"O- the first few sips were good, but the artificial sweetness became too much after a while that I found it hard to finish. This would be a good intro beer to noobs because the roasted notes are subtle, but probably not something I would buy again"
""
""
"This pours a very dark brown color with a slight head. Some there is a slight robust aroma mixed with sweet malts. The taste is decent but the volume and the vanilla flavor could use some work. It’s a little thinner than I imagined and the vanilla does stand out too much either. A fairly decent dark beer from Leine’s."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Overall a smooth and easy drinking brew that for the most part delivers as advertised. I appreciate the opportunity to try it but would probably not willingly purchase this."
""
""
""
""
"They didn't scrape out vanilla pods for this one. Too pale, thin, and sweet. Meh at best."
"The vanilla is a nice touch without dominating. It has a black licorice character to it that is more like the candy than like actual anise. An interesting brew. Alcohol is well-hidden. Sweet, dark, easy-to-drink."
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad beer but a little disappointing as porters go."
""
""
"O- A damn decent brew. Nothing spectacular but I found it very drinkable with good flavor. Glad I gave these a whirl."
"Best beer I have had in a long time as good as yingling black and tan but with a vanilla hint and great price 7.99 to 8.99 I first tried it on tap and was very pleased from BWW bufflo wild wings after that I looked all over town to find it in the stores but only one place had it left end of season and man was it good on ice for one hour outside in the snow and went down nice and quick"
""
""
""
""
"3.38/5.00"
""
""
"Overall this is not a bad beer, just a bit too sweet for my tastes."
"Pretty good beer, but one that is utterly forgettable. One & done for me."
"Pours black with a mocha head that faded fast. Lots of bubbles around the glass, looks almost like a coke after the head fades. Smell is very faint, sweet, vanilla and roasted malt. Taste seems like it is trying to be a russian imperial stout, the alcohol comes through, but it isn't a very high ABV. Starts with almost an aluminum flavor (even though this was from a bottle), and kicks into an artificial vanilla, with some roasted malt, but middle and end are dominated by the alcohol flavor. The aftertaste has some roasted notes but the alcohol is still king of the palette. Mouthfeel is too harsh, with a medium light body. Overall the beer could have had a few minor changes to come out a decent porter. I would pass on this one, many other great porters out there."

"Found on tap at the Embassy Suites hotel bar at Logan Airport in Boston this porter is dark black with mahogany edges and a very solid, uniform tan head with good lacing. The nose hit offers a distinctive charcoal malt with a delicate vanilla carmel sweetness. Not very strong but pleasant for sure. The flavor brings out a fizzy vanilla malt with a grassy edge that hints of charcoal and root beer. This seasonal offering is medium-light bodied with somewhat overactive carbonation while finishing with a somewhat chalky feel. A little weak in feel for the style but enjoyable as a sweet taste treat."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours a very dark chestnut brown with a thin light brown head that dissipates slowly to a ring around the glass and light lacing. Pleasant aroma of chocolate, toasted malt and vanilla. Flavor follows, with sweet toasted malt, vanilla, nuts and a hint of chocolate. Similar to a nut brown ale. Light to medium bodied. Expecting a bit more body from a porter, but the flavors are nice, well integrated and pleasant tasting. A decent light bodied porter."
"This pours a dark brown/black with a slight head with tiny bubbles and low retention and almost no lacing. It smells a metallic with a little hint of vanilla and booze. It has a very pleasant taste that is well balanced. The body is a little thin but then again it is a porter and not a stout so with that said it is pretty good with good carbonation. I prefer breckinridge vanilla porter over this but it is still a good beer. I found it at $12.99 a 12 pack and I feel that it is a great deal for the quality of beer that it is."
""
""
"First things first, you will receive an aroma of sweet and earthy grains. This may be due to the vanilla flavoring or something else that I could not infer. The beer is a lighter than expected coloring, has minimal lacing, a nice taste, and a smooth finish. This is a great beer you will enjoy during a barbeque of outdoors gathering. A very worthy effort from Leinenkugel's."
""
""
"Nice job miller"
""
""
"Overall: By the time I reached the second one, the vanilla was getting to me a little bit. For me, this is one of those beers where you drink one, then move onto something different. In other words, good in moderation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Sounds like a better idea than it tastes."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a nice black with a finger and a half of light brown head that dissipates quickly but leaves a little lacing. Smell is dominated by coffee but it masks pretty much everything else. Tastes of coffee and vanilla, but very watery. Beer is light bodied and heavily carbonated, but quite drinkable. Overall, an average beer."
"Overall – A fairly easier drinking porter. While possibly a bit heavy on the vanilla, the beer has a pretty nice sweet, but not too sweet flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It sure is an easy drinking beer, but it is lacking something and left me unsatisfied craving a better crafted porter or stout."

"O: Sadly a pretty weak porter, I was expecting a little more here. Not quite up to the Leine's I'm used too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall im not usually a fan of this brewery, this is certainly one of the better experiences ive had from them. Very smooth and easy drinking vanilla porter that feels highly sessionable despite its reported 6.9% alcohol. An easy one to throw back."
""
""
""
""
""
"nothing good to say here as i was told its a water down version of ___ just because it it has vanilla doesnt make it drinkable everybody yearns for winter bourbon cask ale and no beer can ever compare to that so grab this beer if you like vanilla it packs no punch and lacks the color of porter"
"I wish the mouth was a bit thicker. This is a big improvement over their old winter seasonal and I will have no problem reaching for one on the occasional basis."
""
""
""
"O- I'm not a huge fan of vanilla beers, but this vanilla is not too terrible. For a porter this misses the mark. If you were to say thick vanilla lager, that's almost what I think of with this beer. Not the greatest in the world, but not the worst. Probably will not try again in the future."
""
"I hope this beer is not going to be seasonal. It will be very missed if that is the case!"
""
"Leinenkugel Snowdrift vanilla porter,A beer from Leinenkugel Brewery. Seasonal.. This pours great, nice thick tan head. Carmela fills your mouth, then the vanilla sets in with a rich sweet finish of creamy goodness 6.0 abv (LIKE) This is our winter go to brew..buy the case."
""
"O: my wife bought this on whim, forgetting the horrible 6 pack of leinenkugel's honey wheat we bought years ago on a trip to WI. this beer is much better than that, but does not rank among my favorite porter style beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Thanks Geoff."
"Poured into a glass mug. Pours dark copper with a quickly dissipating light tan head. There is visible light passing through the bottom of the glass along with many rising tiny bubbles. There are aromas of dark roasted barley malt, vanilla, and chocolate. The flavor is very vanilla forward with dark roasted malt and chocolate. There's some nuttiness in the taste as well. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. The drinkability of this beer is good. This is a good beer."
""

""
""
""
"O- An underrated beer. A good porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There was definitely a sweet, vanilla flavor to this beer but it wasn't overdone. I could still taste all of the characteristics I enjoy in a porter. Similar to their Summer Shandy where even that beer tastes good in the right setting (hot weather, your local festival where you are looking at a long day of pounding beers) this tastes good along with some Christmas candy or cookies."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Amongst the artificial vanilla tones there seems to be a faint metallic note that screams macro. Overall this beer is ok; it definitely sounds better than it really is."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I typically like porters, but this one feels cheaply done and a bit like a gag gift at Christmas…I didn’t buy this, so I don’t feel so bad dumping it out and looking for another option…NEXT! (0/5)"
"Poured from a bottle into standard pint glass this beer is disappointing right from the start. Dark watery color with a slight head that disappears very quickly with no lacing. The appearance completely lacks the characteristics expected in a porter. The smell is primarily of vanilla extract. The feel is thin and highly carbonated, almost feels like a cola in the mouth. Tastes like a commercial winter ale with vanilla extract added. Overall this beer is certainly drinkable but disappointing."
""
""
""
""
"Single finger head on a deep brown body with shattered lacing. Aroma is mild and simple with vanilla, roasted malts and hints of chocolate. Flavor follows the aroma well with the roasted and chocolate malt base balanced well by vanilla which isn't too sweet. Relatively thin body and moderate carbonation. A vanilla porter as advertised with a standard porter body and base beer. Very drinkable but nothing to make this one a very complex brew."
"Subpar for a porter. Weak malt character and body with excess vanilla."
""
""
""
""
"I tried the Leinie's Snowdrift Vanilla Porter at a local BW3. The beer poured a clear dark amber with thin almost non-existent head that did not lace. The smell is a good vanilla with sweet malt. The taste follows the smell....very nice vanilla. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with decent carbonation. Overall it was a very easy drinking porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Certainly not bad. I am very pleased that the vanilla does not seem artificial or overly sweet. Both major concerns of mine going in. It is a little odd that the roasted coffee fades out to nothing before any hint of vanilla hits, but still something I enjoyed for what it is."
"This poured out as a very deep brown color with a nice cream colored head on top. The lacing and retention are pretty good on this beer. It's rather nice looking. The smell of the beer is earthy with some subtle vanilla notes but mostly smells like dirt. The taste of the beer is decent, it's got some nice vanilla bean flavors along with some roasted malts in the finish. The vanilla comes out more and more with each sip. The mouthfeel is pretty standard, it's medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation to it... maybe a little too much. Overall I enjoy the beer. I would probably drink it again."

"Overall: One of the better brews from Leinie."
""
"O: Nice sweet combination of vanilla and chocolate. Pretty standard and simple but drinkable and not bad for the cost (which is extremely minimal)."
"O: This beer is a great tasting and easy to drink porter. The only drawback is that it is a little sweet and tastes a bit like malt extracts."
"Overall: I wouldn't buy this. If it's free or cheap on tap somewhere and you want a porter, go for it. An average at best beer."
""
"O - Ehh.. beef up the consistency and tone down the carb, then it might be average."
"O: good selection from Leinenkugels, however the vanilla is almost non existent, not my favorite but would buy againsnowdrift vanilla porter"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-very little depth of flavor beyond the vanilla, also a thin body--an average porter at best"
"O - I think it is pretty good for $15 for a twelve pack of cans. I like the cans for tailgating, and it has some comfort flavors that help fight off the winter chill."
""
"Nice, drinkable alternative to more traditional winter /seasonal offerings. Certainly not outstanding, but interesting enough to add some variety to your holiday celebrations. the 6% alcohol will help in tolerating the in-laws."
""
""
""
"O- Forgettable beer."
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a decent porter to drink for a while."
"Overall- Not bad, but I can’t say I’d buy it again. Again it was very sweet- maybe too sweet for me- and lighter than I thought it would be."
""
"Yes."
"O: This fine seasonal was a pleasant surprise. Perhaps my favorite Leinie."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An ok beer if your looking for something light, sweet, and dark."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: it sounded interesting, but really isnt. much too light, not enough porter qualities in my opinion. just a fake sweetness that is quite unappealing."
""
""
""
""
"O-	A tasty offering of a vanilla porter but the body needs some adjustments."
""
""
"O: Even as a dessert beer, I'd call this one a mild failure. As a porter, it's more or less a total failure. The only thing it really has going for it is drinkability - if only to get the chemical aftertaste off of the palate as soon as possible. No regrets getting a single bottle (a tick is a tick, damnit), but I don't need to ever have this again."
""
""
""
"If you like sweet beers, this is a keeper. I think what frustrates me about this beer is that it is so close to being great. Definitely the best beer I've had from Leienkugel's."
""
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a dark amber color and poured a tan colored head. The beer had not much smell except for the vanilla. The beer also pretty much tasted like vanilla and thats it. really a little too sweet, but drinkable. This one barely passes the I will drink again test."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear mahogany color with a creamy tan head. Aromas of light vanilla and some wood. Taste is initially some sugar and vanilla up front, followed by some lightly roasted flavor in the middle, and some chalky, earthy, spicy finish. Mouthfeel is average. Overall a good porter, probably the best Leinenkugel beer I've had. I got this as part as a mixed six pack, but I suspect a full six pack could be in the future for an inexpensive, sweet porter fix."
"O - Like a brown ale with slight burnt malts and vanilla. Not a drain pour for sure, but nothing special here. If new to dark ales, worth a try, but if a connoisseur of great dark ales, even the style of porter, I would pass for a more expensive and tastier beer."
""
""
""
""
"Moderate mouthfeel, with some carbonation bite. A little on the thin side, but in no way is this watery or slick. Again, pretty average feel. Good balance of vanilla sweetness, semi-sweet chocolate, and yeasty bread. Mild bitterness. This is an easy one to quaff. I was afraid this would be overpowering in its sweetness, but this was well balanced. A simple beer that was well-made. I'd have it again."
""
""
""
"Creamy and pretty tasty, a good value that could be a good ""gateway"" brew for macro beer drinkers."
"I admit to not liking a beer with a hoppy taste. This is probably why I do like this beer, more flavor from malts and chocolate with a hint of vanilla. It is very smooth and easy to relax and drink."
""
""
"Overall - If you want a good vanilla porter and you have to choose, Breckenridge would be my first choice, because the flavor lacks the Vanilla kick which Breckenridge possessed. With that said, the flavor is still unique and at the most, worth looking into. My only major complaint is that the body needs some work."
"For a porter, it's nothing to write home about, and the sweetness needs to be balanced better. However, it's not awful, and it's certainly one of the better offerings I've had from Lienenkugels. Just too sweet."
""
"Not a great porter but nothing offensive."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a solid dark brown with ruby highlights and a smallish tan head that quickly dissipates to a cap. Smells of caramel and brown sugar with a bit of chocolate and vanilla. There's a light bit of roast in the aroma with little to no hop presence. The flavor is sweet with a vanilla and caramel playing the lead roles. A little brown sugar and roast come in to support but the vanilla really overpowers everything else in the flavor. Little to no hop flavor or bitterness is detected. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet creamy mouthfeel. I bought some Big Eddy Imperial stout a few years back and I was blown away. Since that time I keep trying their regular beers hoping to revisit the magic, but it just doesn't seem to happen. There's nothing really wrong with this beer, but for my tastes its too much vanilla and not enough porter."
""
"The use of vanilla in the profile and a nicely masked 6% ABV are just couple of reasons I would grab this one again."
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a very dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of vanilla, some coffee. Taste is good, lots of vanilla, some cocoa and coffee, lots of flavor. feels medoium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"Overall, nowhere near one of my favorite porters. I commend them for branching out of their normal offerings but there are too many flavors fighting each other in this beer and a lot of them have an artificial taste to them."
"This is bad. I don't think Leinenkugel's has any idea what a Porter is."
""
""
"Initially, it pours a very thin head of about half a finger, which dissipates quickly leaving moderate lacing. The look is a deep, dark, brownish-black with just a tint of red when it catches the light. The nose is deceptive and it doesn’t hold much of a smell when compared to its strong taste. A malty porter with a complicated palate but a lingering cocoa after taste that is reminiscent of a dark chocolate candy bar. I really like the way a vanilla-coffee flavor bursts at first taste followed by the overbearing cocoa finish to really add a varied taste experience. The Snowdrift holds a slight bitterness to it, almost like coffee and the mouthfeel is strongly carbonated but smooth. This is a bit more on the darker and bitterer side than most beers but pretty standard for a porter. It warms the drinker and is perfect for enjoying on a snowy winter night while cozied up in a ski chalet somewhere."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, this wasn't too bad for a Leine. Not great by any means however. Completely average. I can think of better beers to drink on a cold snowy night however."
""
"This is a really good beer, especially in the cooler months. Overall, a porter than can stand up with almost any other I've had, and generally cheaper."
""
"A nice smooth beer, It had a slight vanilla and a little coffee flavor both were very mild. It had a nice dark color a little cream colored, short lived head . Felt medium bodied in the mouth. very little aftertaste, no bitterness . A nice beer for cold weather."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium. I really hate to say this but this porter is below average. The flavors are not uniformed, the vanilla is playing peek a boo with the taste bud. I have had some better porter. I wish Leinenkugel would try to put more effort in making higher quality beer instead of a Henry Ford assembly line."
"Snowdrift Vanilla Porter pours out brown with a small head. Coffee, vanilla, and roasted malts come through on the nose. The taste hits with the sweet vanilla right out the gate, which then backs up a bit to let more of the roast characteristics out the gate. Pretty simple, but tasty. The mouthfeel is a bit too light and prickly, but the drinkability is good. Overall, not too much to write about this one. It's a tasty porter with a very light body."
"Overall, I just bought a single bottle of this, and it served it's purpose. I think it could be a lot better if the vanilla didn't taste watered down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Enjoy!"
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: This one is typical Leinie's. If you typically like their beers, you will like this one. If not, I suspect you will not like this one as well. Nice vanilla taste over a decent porter. A bit sweet, but still one I will get again."
""
""
""
""
"Bottom line: Avoid this beer (unless you have a cough, because something tells me it would work well for that)."
""
""
""
"O - Reminds me a lot of Sam Adams' Hazel Brown or Founder's Porter. While not quite up to par with those, still enjoyable. Also nice to see a new seasonal from Leinie's."
""
""
"overall...an above average offering from the gateway beer kings of the northland. if, as it warms and i drink a few more, doesn't become cloying, artificial or too boring...i might revisit this."
"O - Thin. Not as sweet as it should be. Doesn't resemble a porter at all actually. Hoped for bold - received pretty mild. Vanilla presence was descent. Avg beer drinker will probably find this very good. but it doesn't meet the style very well and all flavors are average at best."
""
""
""
""
"Not bad, not great, pretty much standard Leinenkugel fare."
""
"A fair porter. A fuller body would help and it's a bit sweet for my taste."
""
""
"O) I have to say, this exceeded my expectations. While I won't be running out today to grab a six pack, this was a decent seasonal. Give it a try...."
""
""
""
"Overall I wasn't a big fan of this beer, it wasn't impressive and I thought it was a pretty average example of a vanilla Porter, the flavor and body seemed a little watered down and I didn't deliver what I wanted from this beer. This beer didn't have the best drinkability it was smooth, but the flavors didn't hold my attention so one would be enough for me, there's no need to drink two in a row. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it wasn't the greatest but it turned out to be the highlight of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the watered down flavor and mouthfeel, it needed to be bolder, richer, and less carbonated. I won't be buying this beer again, I would much rather have a Vanilla Java Porter from Atwater the flavors come through much better in that beer, I wouldn't recommend this beer. All in all I was let down with this beer, it seemed to lack those robust flavors that a good Porter should have and the mouthfeel also held this beer back, I'm chalking this one up as another average at best Leinenkugel's beer, I thought Fireside Nut Brown was a much better winter seasonal."
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is a light brown with red highlights, plenty of light brown foam. Nose is roasty with a minimal hint of vanilla at the back. The taste is very sweet with chocolate caramel and lots of vanilla. The roast doesn't white balance out the sweetness, things taste nearly artificial. Mouthfeel is light with moderate to high carbonation. Overall, pretty lackluster. Meh."
"Overall: Snowdrift comes across as the Creamy Dark but with some vanilla additive added."
""
"An easy drinking brew that I find tasty enough to keep me interested..I'm glad they didn't go overboard with the vanilla as it could have dominated the flavours and made this more one dimensional. I like."
""
"Overall this was a pretty average beer. The taste had no real standout notes and the lightness of it really took a lot away."
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle, stamped with FEB1113 on it, I assume that's the best by date. Served in a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass, when held up to the light the beer pours a dark reddish/brown color with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. The brew smells like vanilla, roasted malt, milk chocolate and some coffee. The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, except that the chocolate flavor is both bittersweet and milk chocolate. Also, I think the flavors are a little stronger in comparison to the aroma. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit smooth and creamy. I think it's a solid brew. Got a single bottle from a friend of mine for free, so I'm not sure about the price of this beer."

"O: Enjoyable but not really anything special - I would not go out of my way to try this one again... Pretty easy to drink."
"Source: Purchased at HEB in Harker Heights, TX, a six-pack of twelve-ounce bottles for $7.99."
"The feel has a crispness that's not too hard and some smoothness, but the body is a little light for a porter. No problems otherwise."

"A tad early for snow, per se, but I'll take a good vanilla porter any day. Is this one good? Let's find out: This stuff pours a deep ruby-sienna topped by a finger of light khaki foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, toasted barley, and some mild chocolate in the deep recesses. The taste holds notes of roasted malts, cocoa, vanilla bean, and a touch of light bubblegum at the very end. Things are kinda chalky all-around, though, detracting somewhat from what could have been a pretty tasty vanilla porter. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly smooth feel. Overall, a nice porter, one that deals with the vanilla pretty well (meaning they don't either overdo it or make it ridiculously sweet). Not bad."

"Given this one by a friend to try. Not a Leinie fan in general, and I'd say that this is one of their best. The vanilla is cheap and artificial, but the other flavors are pleasant. There are plenty of reasons not to buy this in bulk, but not a horrific beer. I would tire of it after a few, but it is overall ok."

"O - The closed-off, somewhat boring nose doesn't keep the beer from becoming more than ""your standard beer"". Instead, Snowdrift Vanilla Porter takes it's roasted malt profile and dribbles in some vanilla extract for a mellow, smooth, and soothing winter beer with a hearty feel on a cold day and satisfying finish."

"Taste is equally like a vanilla Coke, with an odd artificial sweetness. The finish shows this best of all. Not good, At all."

"Draught @ Curley's Pub: This one pours a fairly opaque, dark brown color. There was a small tan head that left a little lacing. The aroma isn’t bad. Definitely has vanilla on top, but it is not too strong. Also has notes of chocolate and coffee. The taste isn’t bad. Vanilla, espresso, chocolate are dominant. Not much else. Medium bodied. Just a touch sweet. Not a bad brew at all."

"O - This is a pretty nice vanilla porter. One of the better brews from the Leinenkugel lineup."

"Overall a good porter, especially at this price point. I recently brewed a vanilla spiced porter and at last tasting it was still a bit cider-like. I'd have been happy if it turned out like Snowdrift."

"Me no likey. I find the vanilla to be extremely bitter and 'dirty'. The vanilla leads to coffee and cocoa flavors, both of which are what are causing the bitter I think. This is especially noticeable if you take a sip and let the aftertaste develop for a few minutes. I'm pretty disappointed in this one... Leiny's has been known to lay an egg from time to time and I think this is one them. While drinking it, or forcing it down, I kept looking to see if it was almost gone because I was sick of it. I'm guessing Breckenridge is a better bet. The mouthfeel is good and its smooth going down, but I just can't get passed the aftertaste. I'm gonna go brush my teeth now."
"Overall: If you are a fan of vanilla then this may be the beer for you. It was a tad sweet but very drinkable and while I would try this again I would not go out of my way to get it."
"I bought this 1 hour ago at Wal-mart where the choice was really limited. It looked intriguing and the price was right, $11.50 for a twelver. I was hesitant because most beers by Leinenkugel are disappointing. I checked the reviews on Beeradvocate, and the consensus was drinkable to pretty good, so I picked up the twelver. I wished I had bought something else. Leinenkuge calls it a porter, but it tastes nothing like a porter. The taste is like caramelized water with a hint of vanilia. It sort of tastes like bitter root beer. This is my first review on Beeradvocate, and I am usually content with comparing my opinion to the reviews on this site, but my experience with this beer was so opposite of the other reviews that I felt compelled to post a review. I will not buy this beer again."

"Pour looked really good. Nice and dark with a little bit of opacity, but not much. It had a solid head for a porter, but it dissipated quickly. The smell wasn't very strong. It was hard to distinguish any particular flavor from the aroma. The taste has hints of vanilla that last after the swallow. Overall its a pretty solid beer, but nothing really special. I wouldn't hesitate to drink it again, but I wouldn't make it a point either."

"Overall, this was an enjoyable traditional porter whose hints of vanilla didn't quite back up the feature billing on the label."
"O: It's not a bad drink by any stretch of the imagination. There isn't anything offensive here, but nothing stands out either. Would I drink again? Sure, but I don't see myself ever making another purchase."
""
"This is a good beer for the price, and it's nice that it comes in cans, but it's relatively boring and way too sweet."
"O - A very descent offering from Leinenkugel's. I'm always kinda sketchy about any beer with a twist top, but this one exceeded my low expectations. Very easy drinkability, and pretty tasty. Not too cloyingly sweet"

"Overall - Not an especially impressive porter, even less so when taking into account the vanilla element. No real roasted malt depth at all, and hops are all but absent. It's drinkable, in the least."
