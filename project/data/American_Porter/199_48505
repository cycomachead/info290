The bread in this beer's head was repeated in the aftertaste as hints of pumpernickel could be found after the liquid went down, owing to the strength of this beer's body and subtle spice. Porters don't come around like this that often so if you can find it, get it. It's not for the faint of heart but there's enough out there that is and who are you kidding - you know you want to find something this well-crafted and savor every last drop of it.

I love coffee, roast at home and drink every day, but that is all I taste in this beer. I would have loved more dark malt taste, for a balance. But perhaps that is why this is classified as a porter rather than a stout. Mouthfeel is great, nice carb, a bit on the thin side but not in a bad way. Overall, I can see why people like this beer but just not my cup of joe for the reasons stated.","Christoffer91","Mar 07, 2015"

The vanilla showed up more in taste as the beer warmed, but this is first and foremost a coffee porter, with a slight manageable bitterness.  Smooth, some creaminess, closer to medium than thin.  Started this at 48 degrees, maybe we should have started warmer given the alcohol content?  A good beer, but honestly, my expectations were higher based on BA and RB ratings.  Given the flavor profile, I think I'd rather have a stout.  If I want a big alcohol porter, I'd go with something along the line of Black Butte XXV.","marieli","Feb 27, 2015"

Not overly watered down like lots of porters. Damn good beer.","Brackh","Feb 18, 2015"

Appearance is deep opaque black with a tall tan head that eaves some patches of lace. We debated which aromas/flavors might have faded in aging and were pleasantly surprised immediately after we started. Aroma is coffee-powered with roast malt, some cocoa, and vanilla (which we though may have faded most, but was still holding its own). No astringency or strong booziness to indicate the 10% abv. Taste is off the charts, like a delicately carbonated vanilla frappuccino. Full bodied, creamy, thick, and filling texture, soft carbonation, a touch of heat and bitterness underlie a sweet finish.","SierraFlight","Feb 14, 2015"

The body is near solid black even when held up to light. Smells of vanilla ice cream shake, African coffee, caramel, and chocolate. On the nose, very sweet. Lots of sugars. Strong vanilla bean ice cream taste. Some chocolate and minor bitters. Overwhelming vanilla dilutes barley and biscuit notes inhibiting the overall flavor profile. This continues mid-palate where there is a bit more heavy cream coffee, but not enough to overwhelm the sweetness. I would like to see more porter notes. Maybe some bitter cocoa or malt. More balance to the coffee and less half & half. Instead the back palate and after taste are all vanilla milkshake with some coffee ice cream. It's almost sickening to the stomach. No real alcohol notes, but that's just because everything is overwhelmed by vanilla. I really think if they dialed back the vanilla the flavor profile would be extremely good, but as it is-- I cannot get beyond all that sweetness. It is just too much and really kills what could be an otherwise excellent porter if they'd let the rest of the flavors come through. I tried it cold. I drank it slightly chilled. I tried it near room temp. No difference. No change. Disappointing. 3.5 out of 5.","digitalflood","Feb 08, 2015"

4.52,2.7,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Glad to have Ballast Point here in the Badger State. Enjoyed this brew at cellar temp. Served in a FFF Teku glass. A dark brown color with a mocha head that settles quickly to a collar. The aroma is a huge blast of fresh ground coffee. It was reminiscent of Big Bad Baptist. If you enjoy coffee, you will love this beer. The flavor is also very coffee forward. A wonderful blend of bitterness, with a kiss of of vanilla bean and caramel sweetness. The 10% ABV is amazingly well hidden. The mouthfeel is that of an easy drinking medium bodied brew. Slightly dry coffee ground finish. Overall, this is a world class Porter. I'd gladly recommend this brew.","RoamingGnome","Jan 31, 2015"

Great complex aroma of dark sugars, roasted malts, coffee, caramel, raisins and nut cake. Taste of sweet roasted malts with a slightly dry bitter sweet and slight alcohol finish. As the bottle indicates, other strong flavors are coffee and vanilla extract. Feel is full bodied, hearty and robust. Minimal carbonation helps keep the flavors intact and makes this a great brew to warm you in the winter and/or drink with dessert. A thoroughly enjoyable brew and one of my favorite examples of porter!","Gajo74","Jan 24, 2015"

Probably if I had not seen that this was listed as a porter I would not have guessed it was that style.  All that aside, the depth and strength of the coffee and vanilla are just right - very strong to stick out, but not so strong as to be overpowering.  Rich, but not cloying.  Dangerously drinkable as the alcohol is well hidden, and yet I can feel this creeping up on me after half the glass, so I know better to not have another 12oz bottle, but I really wish I "had to finish a bomber because I can't recap it" sort of problem right now.  Well done and I can see why so many people rate this so high.  I would bet this beer would go well with a wide range of desserts, but it does work well as an after-dinner sipping beer as if it was its own dessert.","damndirtyape","Jan 20, 2015"

Beautiful tan foam head on the pour, with a medium body and mouthfeel. This is stellar. The coffee notes are not acrid at all - but provide a good dose of body and kick to this imperial porter.

This review is more for the one that was about 9 months old where I thought it was incredibly complex and the coffee didn't dominate everything so much (for me).  With a bit of age on it, it became one of best porter/stouts I've had.","erushing","Dec 17, 2014"

4.69,6.6,4.75,4.5,5,4.25,4.5,"Pours dark as a starless night with an excellent massive head. Lacing and retention are also excellent. Nice nose of sweet dark chocolate over coffee with strong vanilla notes. Medium body with a slick texture that has creamy aspects, but is not quite there. Above average carbonation with effervescence present from the middle on. The flavor profile is simply a masterpiece - intense, complex and balanced. It begins with a rush of sweet dark chocolate that highlights the vanilla aspects but also has a distinctive caramel presence. As the sweetness fades, coffee becomes evident and the vanilla becomes more note like and the caramel is most noted. The middle is the only detection of roast I encountered, and it is buttressed by hop flavor (rind like) and bitterness. A combination of alcohol, hops and coffee yield a nice puckering effect. The finish is quite smooth and lingers with an abundance of all the previous flavors. It is the most complex finish I’ve had the privilege to experience. The finish is where the 10% alcohol becomes evident as a very slight nice burn at the back of the throat. This one is World Class, the best porter I’ve ever had and it’s rating is second to only FBS. IMHO, this is the best porter in the world.","tillmac62","Nov 19, 2014"

First few sips are great, as I really savored the rich coffee-forward aroma and the hint of vanilla that emerged. But after awhile the vanilla aroma and flavors disappear into a solid, but pretty standard, roasty-chocolatey-coffee porter.","blankenhoney","Nov 18, 2014"

While I prefer a stout over a porter, this beer is so big and flavorful that the preference is erased. You love coffee, roasted, flavors in your beer, a must try!","Catracho5","Nov 18, 2014"

3.98,-9.5,4,4.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Really nice nose, but the praise really ends there for me. High bitterness for the style. Clashes with what would otherwise be a great coffee component. As it is, it unfortunately gets muddled a bit. The vanilla is pretty tough to find but is there. As always, the flavors came together a bit more as it warmed...but in the end, the high level of bitterness brought the taste and overall scores down. Certainly not a bad brew by any means, but there are better versions of this recipe out there.","kbuzz","Oct 23, 2014"

I was hesitant to buy this at first as I thought it might be over powered by these two favors but it was a "just right" blend of the two. This beer is as black as the night and was very pleasing. The label indicates its 10% ABV and quite frankly it doesn't taste that strong at all so this beer can definitely sneak up on you after a couple. Well balanced beer with great flavor, consistency, and the right amount of complexity, this is a sensory overload as it will please your sense of smell, sight and taste. I'll definitely drink this beer again.","JDOHare","Oct 06, 2014"

I've never been a huge fan of porters and an imperial version of any style I'm not fond of is usually a bad bet for my palate. However, Ballast Point Victory at Sea imperial porter is off the charts. Although it walks a fine line between porter and stout, the flavor speaks for itself. If you're a stout fan or even a hop head (like myself) who enjoys full flavored beers, definitely pick this one up if you're in the mood for a robust brew. Would I drink it again? Yes, I will be seeking out a nitro-tap version...","JamesMN","Jun 08, 2014"

Smell: big espresso with roast, caramel and earth; vanilla, dark chocolate. Taste: vanilla pop upfront, then high cocoa chocolate atop dark brown sugar and buttered toasted brown bread, thins out into earthy espresso with prune note and more chocolate, earthy hopping and re-emergence of the vanilla. Medium-light bodied, creamy feel, sticky finish. Delicious.","babaracas","May 18, 2014"

But not too deep, not the point where it was overpowering. The perfect amount where I could taste and understand every point in the taste-curve. Every taste bud: hit. Every node: washed. Then came the undertones. A very subtly bitter espresso hint. Just enough spice for interest, but not enough to distract from the oily textures that engulfed my pallata. While this review may be a bit overly-wordy and pretentious, I really must admit that this beer is one-of-a-kind. I'm interested in tasting the coffee that they use. It must be brewed perfectly. Really, really, REALLY delicious.","ConorDavidson","May 06, 2014"

The nose was true to its name with heavy coffee and vanilla scents, and a bit of tart fruitiness, maybe cranberry. Taste was very complex, with a blast of coffee up front, followed by a soft caramel, vanilla flavor and fruit that fades into a bit of bitterness. This is a substantial beer that coats the mouth and leaves behind a lingering flavor,. It really drinks more like a stout than a traditional porter. Overall, I would say that this is a very strong beer, definitely one of my favorites.","OneEye78","Mar 05, 2014"

A hint of caramel sweetness -- I guess I could believe vanilla in there. Flavor starts out coffee forward, with a caramelly, oaky (vanilla) sweetness up front, which progressively works its way back across the palate and ends up respectably bitter. There's not zero hops in here, but the real aftertaste is the earthy bitterness of black coffee, which leaves its residue on the lips. I think the vanilla provides caramel and oak flavors, neither of which are president, but the result is pretty complex, without bringing the harshness of oak, nor the sticky sweetness of adjunct sugars.","hreb","Mar 02, 2014"

Even without all the hype it gets, picking up a bottle from a good brewery that says "Coffee Vanilla Imperial Porter" you would expect something different. This tastes like you brewed a batch of beer replacing the water purely with coffee, and not a coffee with the kind of notes I prefer. If this didn't say vanilla on the label, I would have no idea it was there. And, you have to really know what you're looking for to tell that it is based on a porter. Now, maybe I had it too fresh? Maybe a little age will tone the coffee down? But still, where's the vanilla? I know its there, but it is so over powered by the coffee. I haven't had a ton of coffee beers, but what I have had is a bit more balance, a bit more toned down, and a bit more enjoyable. At $10 a bottle, I'm not going to try to figure out if I got a bad bottle. Still, this isn't a drain pour, but I can think of plenty of 4 pack or 6 pack beers I would rather have.","MadCat","Jan 31, 2014"

Oh, and the 10% ABV doesn't hurt, either. It WILL get on top of you pretty fast if you aren't seasoned so be wary of that.

Still, I think I prefer Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald and its slight, woody sweetness to this. I like to taste a little more malt and a little less roastiness. It's a personal preference, nothing more (darn sweet tooth). This is a terrific beer and I think it's a better example of the style than EF, but if I could only have one porter, I'd still take EF.","deadonhisfeet","Jan 11, 2014"

4.51,2.5,4,4.75,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Deep brown black pour kicking up a creamy mocha colored foam that levels off to a thinnish but persistent cap. Lacing coats the edge of the glass. This smells fantastic. A bold, dark and quality French roasted coffee is the prominent feature, interwoven with subtle vanilla, roasted caramel, toasted grain. Taste..dark roasted coffee. Nice French roast coffee bitterness plays well with roasted and toasted malts, lightly charred toffee and the vanilla. This may be lightly sweet, but the bitterness of the coffee and hop are very dominant. Body is medium, this of course being an impy porter in weight but carrying imperial stout ABV and flavor so one may expect a more weighty body. Finish is a long lingering coffee bitterness with very subtle hints of vanilla and toffee. If you enjoy high quality coffee and delicious beer you must give this a try.","JackieTH","Dec 06, 2013"

I get lots of sweet coffee on the nose, then vanilla and lots of chocolate malt. I love the combination of these smells. On the palate theses same three prominent flavors emerge in the same pattern. First the coffee - strong and bitter on the front, like a good espresso. Then the vanilla makes a quick presence but disappears as the bitter roasted malts kick in at the end. It finished moderately sweet with a mouthfeel that could be bit thicker, but doesn't disappoint. I wish there was more vanilla in it as the coffee comes on a little bit too strong, but overall it's quite enjoyable.","greenmtn1111","Aug 27, 2013"

Aroma dominated by roasted coffee and vanilla with a bit of alcohol, reminiscent of a coffee liqueur, light toasted malt. Flavor of espresso coffee, vanilla, toasted malt, light oak; finishes with charred, rich coffee and long lasting hop bitterness with a hint of chili pepper hotness. Medium bodied with some creaminess. A very nice, complex porter, rich enough to pass as a stout. Flavors a very complex and rather unusual for a porter, with the ambigous nature of the final pepperiness and bitterness especially interesting. A hyped beer that lives up to its reputation.","LiquidAmber","Aug 11, 2013"
5,13.6,5,5,5,5,5,"Ballast Point has outdone themselves on this one. A mind-bogglingly good Imperial Porter that has pronounced vanilla flavor. One of the smoothest imperial porters you are likely to find. A definite coffee and vanilla taste and a wonderful aroma. This beer is incredibly smooth for 10% abv. Search it out, in bottle, on tap, anywhere this is simply put the finest porter I've ever tasted.","wpqx","Aug 11, 2013"

Pleasant coffee-grinds type of burn, also a licorice aspect for me here (but without resembling strong anise or anything approaching that). Not as sweet as I thought it'd be, but not dry-finishing either. A lively dark beer indeed, not as thick-bodied in appearance as I expected either, although a bit sticky in the mouth. As this sipper warms...roasted coffee, chocolate, cherry-anise, all encapsulated by vanilla. Excellent.","TBoneJones","Aug 09, 2013"

4.59,4.3,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,"wow! this one floored me, and its been awhile since a beer has blown me away! on tap at bangers and lace in Chicago. it pours a molten black color, hints of brown, but entirely impenetrable to light. there is an obvious weight to this, and a half inch of mocha colored head on top that slowly fades out. the nose is intensely vanilla, sweet and fresh above the deep dark abyssal malts, which are raw chocolate, burnt coffee, and very bitter aromatically. the coffee to me is more pronounced in the flavor than the nose, and the vanilla is strong on both fronts. this doesn't need to be barrel aged, its got all the complexity one could ever imagine already. I taste everything from whole wheat chex cereal to velvety milk chocolate, bakers cocoa, and vanilla frosting. it remains fairly unsweet, given its ingredients are so desserty. huge body, but intimidating. sips like silk, and the alcohol content is barely noticeable. easily one of the best beers ive had in a long time, and ballast point has now impressed me three times out of three, hard. this is a beer not to be missed, and I hope to be lucky enough to encounter it again. like nothing else around, and a real masterpiece.","StonedTrippin","Jul 21, 2013"

Still very cedar, wood resin heavy, relatively dry, a bit spicy, excellent rich coffee character and raw cacao. Much more refined with 6+ months sitting in the bottle.

Smells of dark roast coffee, cherry, fig, vanilla, caramel, some hops, alcohol, toasted malts, chocolate, and a mass of other dark fruity esters. Some definite complexity, not the most but stands out. Taste follows the nose, strong up front coffee and vanilla, a slight hop profile, toasted malt, cherry and other fruits, creme, caramel, and a touch of alcohol. Feel is full bodied and thick. Very creamy and rich, goes down easily. Overall this stuff is pretty good, despite not having much taste for coffee, which by far dominates the taste.

Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big vanilla, cream, milk chocolate, caramel, toffee, coffee, light roasted malt, and dark bread. Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of dark malt and sweet vanilla notes. Taste of milk chocolate, vanilla, cream, roasted malt, caramel, coffee, light char, toast, floral, and light pine. Lingering notes of vanilla, milk chocolate, cream, roasted malt, caramel, coffee, light char, toast, dark bread, floral, and light pine on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance and complexity of roasted and sweet creamy vanilla malty flavor; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic imperial vanilla porter! Great balance and complexity of roasted and sweet malty flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on for 10%.

Hints of coconut, vanilla, bourbon, roasted chocolate, french coffee. Tastes damn near like the perfect porter, smooth chocolate, bitter dark coffee, vanilla and bourbon, and just the slightest hint of coconut. This flavor can stand up to many BA imperial stouts out there. Amazing. Mouthfeel is thick and velvety, relative to a foreign stout but the sweetness could ave you believing you were drinking an imperial stout.

The coffee taste is light, but the vanilla shines. The flavor hides the alcohol well. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light but certainly not watery. This beer offers everything you want in a porter, then takes it to another level with the additional flavors. Highly recommend.","PHBoiler","Apr 04, 2013"

More of the coffee and vanilla comes out at the end along with a nice warming alcohol presence. There's a lot going on here but it all blends well together. Slick mouthfeel.

In fact, you are immediately shocked at how smooth an imperial porter can be before you're overwhelmed by perfectly sweet vanilla. I had this along with Flying Dog Barrel-Aged Gonzo Porter and this was definitely the winner, although the Double Gonzo was the second-best imperial porter I've had. A lot of carbonation that makes the thickness of the beer stand out, with the sweetness balancing the thickness nicely. As the beer warmed up I really began to notice the hops, more so than any other porter I've had. As I finished all I could think of was the brilliant hoppiness.","falc0n2600","Feb 25, 2013"

Biye up front that soothes into lots of chocolate on the palate. Second sip is a bit more earthy coffee. Don’t get a lot of vanilla, but it lingers in the aftertaste just a hint. Pretty prickly carbonation, but not too much. Medium mouthfeel but very drinkable (one of the lighter imperial porters i have had). Very nice beer.","BMMillsy","Feb 13, 2013"

Mouth feel is exceptional because it combines a nice viscosity with some carbonation and a finishing bite. This is not a flabby vanilla porter.

4.57,3.9,4.5,4.25,4.75,4.75,4.5,"Pours very dark brown, night shade with a one finger tan head, small-carbed head. Nose is of freshly roasted coffee beans. Not much vanilla on the nose. Taste a bit smoky/roasted getting much more of the fresh coffee note that Ballast has added. Vanilla beans show up on the back end of the drink, staying for a while and almost becoming gourmand. Mouthfeel is creamy and enjoyable. It is a bit heavy but is a nice after dinner, dessert beer in the winter. This is more reminiscent if a stout than an imperial porter. Definately a fun change of pace as far as normal smoky porters/stouts go. Pick one up and give it a try. Very much enjoyed by a true hop-head who normally doesn't deviate from IPA land.","djjacobsen","Jan 17, 2013"

Pour is fairly dark, not quite opaque like a stout. A finger or two worth of head. Leaves a nice lacing. Taste is, obviously, the best part of this beer. It follows the nose well. Everything is blended perfectly. The 10% alcohol is completely masked. I wish this beer wasn't a four hour drive from me. I should have gotten more.","ilikebeer03","Jan 15, 2013"

4.5,2.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"22 ounce bottle, stamp says enjoy by 11/26/13. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch tan head that sticked around for a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like coffee, vanilla, roasted malt, and bittersweet chocolate. The taste is pretty much just like the aroma, it tastes like coffee, roasted and burnt/charred malt, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, and a bit of caramel. It starts off bitter, and then the sweet flavors catch up to balance things out. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit creamy and has moderate carbonation. The 10% ABV is well hidden. I have to say this is a pretty good overall brew. As soon as I heard Ballast Point was coming to Ohio, this was the beer from them that I was wanting to try the most, and it hasn't disappointed! $8.99 a bomber, I know I'll be buying this again.","bluejacket74","Dec 31, 2012"

Fortunately the taste isn't nearly as roast-heavy as the smell would indicate. There's certainly a good amount of roast and coffee here, but it's balanced out nicely by a little bit of sweetness and vanilla. It manages to keep from being too sweet or too roasty - honestly the flavor is more of a 4.25 than a 4.5, but I'm balancing it out by giving it a 4 overall. Mouthfeel is full-bodied, but with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a really tasty beer that I'm excited to have access to regularly now that Ballast Point is distributing to DC.

A Porter born to sail the night, without fear, without wavering from the very foundation of why I love the west coast set.

Beautiful motor oil black pour with a bit of light making it through. Nice 2 finger mocca head, with excellent retention and great lacing throughout. Smell was spectacular. Vanilla with chocolate and coffee. Some burnt fruits notes and dark malts. Complex and inviting. Couldn't stop smelling it! Taste followed the nose with huge coffee on the front that fades to subtle bitter and vanilla finish. A great blend that is almost perfect. Hides the 10% well, but a definite sipper. Feel is very strong. Full bodied and great carbonation. Creamy and smooth. Overall- One of the best beers I have ever had. A great blend of coffee, dark fruits, hops and a touch of vanilla.

What you smell is what you get. The coffee is perfect. It has a nice roastiness to it, but doesn't come across as burnt. The vanilla is subtle but present, making this a near perfect experience on the palate. The mouthfeel is glorious. Typically porters are entirely too thin and carbonated for my liking.

The aroma carried over well in to the taste, with practically all the same elements in a good balance; flavors came out more as the beer was allowed to get closer to room temperature. On the fuller side of medium-bodied, smooth, lower carbonation, and a bit of alcohol warmth that really didn't affect the flavor. Very good overall.","Rifugium","Mar 03, 2012"
4.48,1.8,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"22 oz bomber pours an opaque black with slow forming fantastic looking cascading tannish head.

Mouthfeel is a bit harsh (really my only quibble with this wonderful brew) but creamy and dry finish. Great beer, the vanilla and coffee flavors fit in well with the traditional (but extra strong) porter flavors.

4.11,-6.6,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured from a bomber into a tumbler pint, the beer is a near black, with a thick, densely packed, tight bubbled, frothy tan head that sits a solid half an inch on the surface of this brew. Aromas are subtle and very well blended, with hints of day old coffee, vanilla, dark chocolate, and some earthy notes. Flavors are rich and bold, with a blast of bitter dark chocolate and subtle coffee backbone blasting away on the front of the tongue, and quickly covering the palate. Highlights of vanilla and woody characteristics abound, with an earthy overtone throughout, and some boozey profiles as well. The beer's flavors ride a creamy and light body that leaves a great many rings around the glass as you drink. The aftertaste is a bit of the booze, a touch of the vanilla, and a hint of the chocolate and coffee blend, giving highlights of everything that just danced across the palate. The finish is rather quick, with only a slight bitter linger at the very end. The alcohol and bitterness do a good job cleaning everything up and helping the beer to avoid the cloying or overpowering realm of flavor profiles. This is a heavy hitter, and definitely a sipper for the evening. Delicious beer.","GarthDanielson","Jan 21, 2012"

Great, great flavor-actually tastes like a porter before the rich coffee comes thru. Nice balance of vanilla against the coffee. Dark chocolate hints as well. Some hop bitterness and flavor. Pleasant roasted grain flavors. Nice body-not overly full or syrupy. LOVE this-going to be a permanent want for me. I love the way it comes thru as an actual porter, not some amped up, big, bad ass flavored something. A lot of flavor-well balanced and true to style for me. Yummo!!!","lackenhauser","Nov 27, 2011"

4.42,0.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Victory at Sea arrives in a pint glass. The beer is pitch black with a finger of tan head. The foam recedes leaving wisps of beige bubbles atop the beer and sticky lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma of fresh ground coffee beans wafts up from the glass. A closer whiff reveals hints of roasted malt, but the coffee overpowers it for the most part. Flavors of coffee and a huge vanilla presence dominate the palate. Sweet, roasted malt is detectable in the background, but the emphasis clearly is on the coffee and vanilla. The finish is semi-sweet wih a lingering aftertaste of... Yep.... Coffee and vanilla. VaS is full bodied, especially for a porter, with a nice, medium level of carbonation. The 10% ABV is quite well hidden by the exquisite melding of coffee vanilla and roasted malt flavors. Overall, a very tasty offering from Ballast Point. Reminiscent of a drink one might order at Starbuck's, but with bubbles and a bit of a kick to it . I enjoy this one every time I have it. Recommended.","Sideswipe","Nov 04, 2011"

The aromas are an array of soft chocolates, toffee, lightly roasted malts, vanilla, coffee with cream, with a subtle sweetness. Surprisingly there is no bitterness on the nose at all. The flavors consist of sweet milk chocolate, lightly creamed coffee, dark chocolate, light vanilla bean, chocolate milk, and it finishes with a slight coffee bitterness. It's really smooth and moderately rich. It's sweet but not too sweet. Overall it's a very, very nice beer and a hell of a porter. The alcohol isn't overly present and it's a fine beer to sip on. This is another well made beer from Ballast point and worth your while.","aasher","Oct 06, 2011"

Stays for awhile and then turns to a thin layer. Great vanilla in the smell. Simply awesome with a background of milk chocolate and Hershey's syrup. I could smell this all day. It's that good. Nice roasty flavor with some bitter chocolate, espresso hints and some smokiness on the swallow. Not getting much vanilla in the taste but the coffee charachter really comes out as it warms. I thought the mouthfeel was a little too carbonated for my liking but that was only a slight "problem" with this amazing brew. Overall I am a forever fan of this brew and look forward to his release again. And the 10% must be a misprint. Much too easy to consume and sharing may be difficult.

The vanilla and coffee are at the forefront, but in a very nice balance, especially when aged for a little bit.

4.07,-7.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Victory at Sea pours a solid black, with a tan head that comes up to between two and three fingers in height. There's a decent amount of lacing left behind, and the foam takes its time in inching down the side of the glass. The nose is almost perfectly balanced. There's some sweet milk chocolate that's neck and neck with strong coffee in terms of flavors standing out. I think a lot of porters and stouts sometimes overdo it on roasty grain notes, but this beer is notable for it's pretty much complete lack of any. I actually wish there was a little bit of roast to give the nose more of an edge, but that's really nitpicking. That superior balance isn't found in the flavor, for the most part. Coffee jumps out and dominates any chocolaty notes on my palate. As the beer finishes approaching room temperature, the coffee and vanilla bean influences finally begin to even out again, but it's a bit too late to make this a truly great beer. The carbonation is appropriately subdued, but I expect a rich and full body from a 10% porter, and this one just doesn't deliver on that front. Victory at Sea is a very good beer, and one that I would gladly come back to, but it's just a step below true greatness.","axeman9182","Jul 23, 2011"

4,-9.1,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer poured out as a thick black looking brew. I was pretty surprised because I would have said this was a stout just by looking at it. The smell of the beer was roasted with a few faint notes of vanilla. The taste of the beer was full of coffee flavors with a subtle aftertaste of vanilla dryness. The mouthfeel is lighter than I thought it'd be judging by the look of the beer. Overall though, I think this beer is quite good. I would drink this one again if I happen to stumble upon it.","Knapp85","Jul 18, 2011"
4.08,-7.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall, this beer is a great after dinner sipper. I can see myself drinking this by the fireplace around the holidays.

Seek it out if you haven't had it and hold on to a few when u need a break from the loved ones in the winter.","thedindaniel","Jul 17, 2011"
4.5,2.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall, this must be the 7th or 8th one I have had this year. I cracked it because there have been some posts saying that the flavors are fading. I have to say they have a bit, but not to the point that I had to drink it before it turned into Black Butte. I can't wait for the next release to compare this to what I remember, and I might even age one for a year or more.","azdback","Jul 16, 2011"

4.42,0.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The nose is sweet and malty. Chocolate, molasses, and vanilla stand out the most here. A bit of coffee lingers behind the rich cocoa and vanilla beans. It smells like a damn fine dessert, waiting for me to devour. Roasty beast for sure. The taste is much the same as the nose but a bit stronger. The chocolate stands out the most and is followed by vanilla and a bit of coffee that wasnt so easily discovered in the nose. A nice mixture of the flavors that play off each other quite nicely. The mouthfeel is full-bodied and beastly to say the least. A nice smooth oily liquid feels great on my palate and I cant put down my glass. Overall, this is a great brew here that creates pretty good balance throughout and has a bad-ass flavor profile. Boom!","ChugginOil","Jul 10, 2011"
4.92,11.8,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Ballast Point is as constant as the North Star when it comes to putting out well-crafted, full-character, premier beers but this is not only arguably their greatest offering, but perhaps one of the best America has to offer up as well. Few beers this dark, this big and this rich could be this agreeably delicious and easily enjoyed. I'd swim across the sea if that's what it took to get another bottle. A special thanks to Ultraman9000 for this one!","biegaman","Jul 06, 2011"

4.68,6.4,5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"O - Ballast Point really found a nice mix here, with flavors that tend to dominate. None of the flavors are overpowering another (maybe the coffee is on the heavier side), instead they really compliment each other. I don't mean to geek out too hard, but it's as if there are four stages to V@S: coffee, chocolate, vanilla, cocoa (and hops). Each flavor stands on it's own, but is an experience all together. If you couldn't tell, I have a pretty massive hard on for this beer. Though I'll say I do prefer the first batch with some age on it.","drewba","Jun 30, 2011"

Aroma picks up loads of coffee and vanilla over a nicely roasted malt. Some chocolate makes an appearance but it’s more of a supporting role.

4.5,2.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a dark, dark black with a 3/4" tan head. Smells of dark roast coffee and a little bit of sweet vanilla. Taste is heavy on the bitter coffee with a bit of smooth vanilla, round sweetness, and just a smooth, smooth enveloping finish. The coffee may be the best I've ever had in a beer - most coffee in beers have an oxidized metalic taste like it's been on the warmer in the break room too long. Not here, this is smooth velvety coffee and a round long, though quite bitter flavor, but with a little bit of a fizzy carbonation that accentuates the bitterness on the very back of the outside of the tongue and a little round vanilla/chocolate smoothness. The carbonation and medium, slightly viscous feel is perfect for the beer. This is the best porter?!?! I've ever had. I don't know if I'd really call it a porter due to the heavier mouthfeel and coffee - it's kinda stoutlike. Whatever it is it's a supreem beer and one that I'll be seeking more of.","plumcrazyfx","Apr 18, 2011"

Taste is of dark chocolate syrup, bitter coffee, vanilla extract, and an earthy mineral taste. Only slight bitterness on the palate after each sip. Absolutely amazing. Beer is thick and creamy in the mouth. A bit of alcohol warming in the throat. Overall, this is a very tasty hard to find beer.

Smells heavily of vanilla and I think I smell some alcohol which is expectant with this beer weighing in at 10% first sip I get more vanilla and some burn from the alcohol which doesn't over power.

The taste follows the chocolate path to enlightenment, accompanied by some light coffee, roasted malts, maple syrup, brown sugar, and a nice subtle burst o' vanilla bean.

The masterful use of the spices improves the overall beer rather than detract from it which is why it gets the '5' it really never lingers in one flavor realm too long, it is a progressively subtle yet intense and balanced experience.

I was pretty taken aback by the flavor, I expected roasted coffee to dominate but this is an absolute vanilla bomb. Coffee, chocolate and a nuttiness are all underlying flavors as well. Everything combines to make a beer that reminds me more of a mocha vanilla milk shake than a porter. Creamy mouthfeel, very sweet but not to the point that drinkability suffers. Definitely some delicious stuff.","Shumista","Jul 16, 2010"

Roasted malts, coffee, and vanilla dominate the nose which also had chocolate slight nutty, and a little sweet lacto notes. Like the nose the roasted malts seem to pop more but the chocolate is a bit stonger on taste that had vanilla and coffee accents. There is was also a little underlying booze and nutty flavors. The beer was medium body with a good amount of carbonation that had a sweet roasty creamy finish. Overall it drank very good and was even better when paired with chocolate brownies.

Flavor was a big roasted porter a bit of dark fruit plums soaked in alcohol with nice rounded vanilla and caramel sweetness. Very much a dessert beer, balanced with herbal hops and dark roasted coffee bitterness. The alcohol level didn't offend the palate or get in the way of drinkability. Full bodied slight alcohol burn, carbonated moderately finishes velvet smooth.

Pours a dark, sludgy near black chocolate with a tan head which barely moves and covers the inside of the glass in sheets. Aroma is actually very pleasant, with little vanilla presence. Primarily a roasted malt, typical porter aroma with a pleasant punch of coffee beans. Unlike the aroma, the flavor begins with a potent vanilla sweetness. Body is very creamy and smooth, low carbonation and chewy finish. The vanilla slowly blends into a strong roast coffee flavor which lingers into a slightly bitter, hoppy burnt finish. Not much porter presence here, or alcohol presence. Not a bad beer, certainly unique, but too sweet and artificial for me to rate this much higher.","yourefragile","Feb 15, 2010"

Smell is of medium roast malts with hints of coffee, vanilla, dark fruit and an underlying sweetness. Vanilla scent improves as it warms. Taste is of fresh roasted coffee with a creamy, milky sweetness backed by a nice presence of vanilla. Hints of fruit, chocolate and oak present. As the drink warms, the taste takes on a somewhat vanilla extract type taste, which is one of my few knocks. Nice full body for a porter, encroaching on stout territory with its creamyness and smoothness. Excellent beer which changes drastically as is approaches room temperature.

Mostly a decent coffee taste, a little sweetness, but not much vanilla. A little roasty. But the thing that really kills the taste is the alcohol, it's there up front with every sip, 10% is too high for a porter in my opinion. A little vanilla and caramel is detectable in the aftertaste.

Not inky though with some mahogany around the edges, which I guess is an argument for it being a porter (whatever that means). The aroma is great, with lots of coffee and maybe even more vanilla; almost like a mocha with a shot of vanilla syrup. I'm having Starbucks flashbacks, and I like it. Plenty of milk chocolate as well, and the vanilla aids in the impression of an immense sweetness. Did I already mention the vanilla? I got more coffee at first, but the vanilla is really coming out over time. Forty-five minutes in the glass, and this begins to resemble vanilla extract. I love that stuff. The flavor is sweet, but not thick or sticky (wait, that's a mouthfeel). Coffee, poser dark chocolate, and lots of vanilla. Fresh coffee, which is always a nice touch. Just enough bitterness to balance the sweet, and no astringency or discomfort. Medium-full body with carbonation that falls somewhere between medium and low. Just a hint of alcohol warmth in the finish, but very integrated and smooth for a ten percent beer. Leans more heavily on the coffee, and especially the vanilla, than I was expecting, but this is fantastic stuff. A true dessert drink, (or morning depending on how you roll, and I do have a slight caffein buzz) but one that is not overly sweet or thick. I could drink a fair bit of this, with alcohol being a welcome limiting factor before any abrasive flavor characteristics. Ballast Point just nailed in on this one: full of flavor, yet balanced and super drinkable. The vanilla is almost silly at times, but I love the stuff and it really works with the rest of the beer.","bulletrain76","Dec 22, 2009"

Hints of oatmeal, toffee, very burnt toast and licorice with a nice dry bitter hop character in the finish. I can't overemphasize how much of a strong burnt/roasted coffee presence there is. It's a bit too harsh for me and extremely bitter, taking away from the silky chocolate and vanilla notes that I liked so much. Alcohol heat mid-palate that becomes stronger at the end of the swallow and produces some warmth in the finish. Pretty complex but a bit one dimensional for me.

The taste is pure coffee initially, it's only after your tongue is coated that the vanilla kicks in. Deep, dark black with a khaki head, wonderful aroma, excellent taste, velvety mouthfeel.

Also some hints of fruity esters - maybe some ripe dark fruits, although fairly faint. Alcohol was present, but balanced well with the flavors.

This beer doesn't smell or taste of brewed coffee, instead it's like you've just roasted beans into a coffee machine. Frankly I think this is actually more complex and pleasing. The vanilla quickly joins the coffee to smooth the flavor out and there's a touch of chocolate malt in the background. Man, if you like coffee beers, this one's for you.

Thick body, not a lot of carbonation noticed. Smell was a wonderful combo of coffee and chocolate. Taste was a knock out. Borderline perfect. Had that chocolate and roasted barley flavor of a nice porter, but the addition of the high end coffee was killer. Then, the vanilla was just enough in the background to lend a bit of flavor, but didn't overwhelm at all. A great compliment to the intended flavor profile. Outstanding flavor. Mouthfeel was stout-like, very heavy and hearty. Much more than a porter. Not a beer to session with, but a beautiful beer to have with dessert or have as a sweet treat by itself. A bit more expensive than what I spend normally on a bomber, but well worth it. Puts Ballast Point up there with the big boys in my mind.","morebeergood","Apr 12, 2009"

The smell is primarily coffee, with some vanilla notes. There's also some very strong dry, fruity esters coming to my nose, nice but not quite as robust as I expected. Wow, the tastes comes through in so many ways. Upfront I notice the coffee, not bitter, but full of flavor, also quite a bit of chocolate underneath the coffee. The vanilla shines through with a bit of a the esters, reminds me of dark plums, a little tart and dry with the taste of the flesh as well. I can sense some caramel sweetness underneath the dryness, and they seem to compete, making this one very interesting. I can't really detect the alcohol, but it slowly warms, making the experience better. Really a great tasting beer. The beer is pretty full, but it oscillates between a kind of slick estery feel and a thick syrupy feel, and I'm really not sure how I feel about the dryness once I get quite a way through this. The carbonation is spot on for the style, I'm a fan. The alcohol will slow you down, but the whole drink is enjoyable, and I'd recommend buying it if you see it. I'm kind of torn, I really love the flavors, but something about the dryness kept me from being in love with it.","taylorhamrick","Mar 27, 2009"

4.33,-1.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Got this one by mail order and couldn't wait to try it. This is the 10% version, part of the Robust series. It pours a dark dark brown, almost black, with two fingers of light brown lumpy head. Plenty of tan lacing. Smells strongly of coffee, roasted malt, a touch of smoke, and a touch of vanilla. Tastes pretty much as it smells: coffee, roasted malt, a touch of smoke, and a hint of vanilla. A bit more smoke than vanilla, actually, but that's not a criticism. This is a damn tasty porter with a lot of complexity going on. Carbonation was just a touch low for my tastes, but it was silky smooth and that's not a bad thing, either. Really, there's nothing to complain about and lots to praise with this beer. A real keeper.","PhxHorn","Mar 25, 2009"

3.97,-9.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Thanks again to stevemcqueenjr for sharing this rare treat. The label on this bottle is awesome (a skeleton at the helm). 22oz. bottle served in my Gouden Carolus chalice. Poured one shade shy of black. No head, just a few bubbles and a thin, bubbly band wound around the bowl of the glass. Reddish-brown highlights were revealed at the base when held up to the light. Nose is roasted coffee/espresso upfront with a hint of vanilla in the back. Taste is char, roast and coffee followed by some vanilla and toffee/butterscotch. Some bitterness lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and lightly effervescent. Nice complexity with a slightly burnt quality. This is a really nice offering from Ballast Point, but there's just a little too much char and bitterness in the mix that impacts the drinkability.","Jwale73","Mar 23, 2009"
4.15,-5.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,"Looks like there are two entries for the same beer. The other one has the word Vanilla in the name, though they're the same beer. That's too bad.","HopHead84","Mar 20, 2009"
3.85,-12.5,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"D: Definitely a night cap type of beer here, a bomber is plenty and probably best shared. Could be a nice dessert beer, perhaps with something to help match its cloying coffee and vanilla. Interesting porter worth checking out.","vacax","Mar 19, 2009"
3.93,-10.7,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Nice creamy mouthfeel. One 22 oz'er will be enough for a while. I am going to let this age for a year ... or two ... and let the coffee mellow a bit.","Overlord","Mar 17, 2009"

4,-9.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Big thanks to Scott for the opportunity. Label on the cap of the growler states 10% abv. Pours black with a nice large creamy tan head that slowly recedes. Aroma is a nice roastiness, very earthy and slightly nutty, a bit of chocolate sweetness, and a tangy porter acidity. Taste follows with a nice coffee and cream flavor, earthy roasted malts, some cola and root beer like sweetness and a touch of vanilla, just a hint of alcohol in the drying hoppy finish as well. Mouthfeel improves greatly as the beer warms, becomes much more creamy which suits the flavor well. Body is medium in weight, some pepperiness and a drying finish. A very good beer, really hard to believe the 10 or 12% as it is very well hidden/balanced. The flavor and mouthfeel were also considerably better nearer to room temp. Earthiness was nice and any sweetness was subtle which helped the drinkability. Thanks Scott!","hoppymeal","Feb 15, 2009"

4.03,-8.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours black with brown edges, and a short, bubbly tan head. Spotty lacing. Fresh-brewed strong coffee aroma with roasted (and slightly burnt) chocolate malt. Some vanilla and cream as well. Big coffee taste. Strong and black, wtih the malt taking just a little off the edge. Creamy middle, with the vanilla and some caramel poking through, giving it a melted milkshake taste. Reverts to a bitter coffee finish. The mouthfeel is deceiving. Its appropriate for the style, but the taste makes you want something a little thicker.","magictrokini","Jan 02, 2009"
4.31,-2,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"On tap at the brewery during RBSG 08. Darkest brown with a creamy cocoa head that leaves a bunch of lacing. Nice roasty nose with milk chocolate and vanilla. Intense iced coffee with a roasty bitterness, some earthy herbal hops, chocolate sweetness. Excellent beer.","illidurit","Aug 09, 2008"
4.01,-8.9,5,4,4.5,3.5,3,"Did not like it as much as the syrah barrel version I tasted at the anniversary party but it was still very good, one of the better coffee porters out there mainly because of its balance in flavor, would definitely drink more in the future, certainly recommended","Floydster","Apr 30, 2008"

4.5,2.3,5,5,4.5,4,4,"On tap at Stone Bistro, served in an 8oz snifter. Poured a pitch black with a thick tan sticky head. The aroma was the most coffee I've ever smelled in a beer and that is compared to Kona Pipeline Porter and Founders Breakfast Stout. It's just a pure roasted coffee aroma. The taste is the same, cold rich coffee and a dark malt backing which is overshadowed by the coffee.","MiScusi","Jan 19, 2008"
