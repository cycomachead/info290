"Little chocolate, wine, coffee.  Another score by Revolution."

"Now that it warms I get a lil more smokey flavor which im enjoying.  Also I can feel the alcohol  a lil more.  Bumped ratings."
""
""
""
""
""
"It was only just okay"
""
""
"O: wow Eugene nows his s#$ t this is great. buying this in bulk next time im mad I only bought one  definitely in top five"
"Really solid offering from Rev Brew.  Lovely chocolate influence!"
""
""
"All-in-all, a very enjoyable porter and one that I continue to revisit on a regular basis."
"Mouthfeel is thick, but has more carbonation present than the beer's appearance does.  Overall pretty solid, I cant say anything bad about it.  My first from Revolution, looking forward to trying more from this brewery."
""
""
"Good but lacking a bit on the carbonation front ... feels a bit flat in a way.  Nice roasted flavors, smooth, very little hop bite."
""
""
""
"Best Porter I've had awesome"

""
"I like this one alot."

"One of the first Revolution beers that I got into, and still a go-to porter for me. Review from can. Deep cocoa brown to black with tan head. Very satisfying slickness to the mouthfeel, without being too cloying. Plenty of hop bitterness to balance out the powdery, bakers chocolate notes. Manages to be simple and complex at the same time, a local standout porter."
""
"Good smooth porter not to heavy! Good flavor nothing to overpowering!"
"No coffee flavor. Dominant prune juice taste"
""
"Uber delicious. Drink this with everything sweet. Partners well with a cup of coffee"
"Had on draft. Thin-bodied and underwhelming."
"Had it on draft at work, might have been too cold. Still, it was an ok Porter, solid base model for the variants."

"Dark as night, this american style porter offers an incredible taste and aroma of dark chocolate malt with notes of toasted grain and caramel flavors. The chocolate essence of this drink allows it to be a great after dinner drink. Very palatable, and a great introduction beer for someone who wants a more robust drink."

"Dark thin body. Lots of cocoa roasted aroma. Huge chocolate taste. Very good. Need to get a few sixers."

""
""
"Not a big Porter fan but this is one of the best I have had.  Right up there with Deschutes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smooth porter flavor with hints of mocha, chocolate and coffee.  Not overpowering but could have used a little stronger flavor for my taste.  Goes well with a hot plate of chicken and potatoes."

"There are a number of very good porters in the midwest, but right now this is my favorite."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is medium but sticky. Overall, not too bad, just a little too much cherry soda character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a good porter.  Dry up front, lightly sweet middle, pleasantly rough and bittersour porter barely at the very back end. Wonderful portery aftertaste, too, which a lot of newer breweries blot out with their more hop-forward iterations."

"Overall / Drinkability: Surprisingly sweet - almost feel this would be a dessert beer, and yet I think it would pair really well with a burger or a steak. Tasty though - hits my sweet tooth just right an I wouldn't mind another one."
""
"Has a great lasting head with great lacing.  Chocolate toasty smell.  Taste is very similar to the smell.  Great full body beer with mild carbonation and goes down smooth.  Fantastic porter!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Different sort of porter. Has some unique properties that does not make beer easy to categorize. Part Belgian, part British, and part American."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer was slightly above average and not anywhere near my top 10 porters I've had. The off flavors present negated any good characteristics the beer had. Cool can, so-so beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I really, really wanted to like this beer. The smell drew me in, but the taste and thin mouth feel let me down. For the same price, you're better off picking up some Founders Porter."

"O: really dig the nod to labour activist Eugene V. Debs, but this is merely an average porter. Not much better than something like Muskoka Dark Ale."

"12 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 12/11/2013. Pours fairly cloudy nearly opaque dark brown color with a 1 finger fairly dense tan head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin ring of lace that lingers. Minimal lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, raisin, plum, cocoa, roasted malt, light coffee, caramel, toast, dark bread, light char, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good complexity of dark/roast/bready malt notes with light-moderate fruitiness; with solid strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, dark bread, light coffee, herbal, light raisin/plum, and toasted earthiness. Light herbal/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, dark bread, light coffee, light raisin/plum, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of dark/roast/bready malt flavors with light yeast fruitiness; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice porter. Good balance and robustness of dark/roast/bready malt flavors with light yeast fruitiness; and very smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Porter. I like porters. This should work out nicely. Solid dark beer. Decent head on pour. Who doesn't like a little head? A little bit of sexy lacing action. Smells like roasted malts, chocolate, and some noticeable hops to me. Thought it was going to be like Jose Marti from Cigar City. Dont get hops with taste though, which is fine by me. A little boozy, and a hair on the sweet side. Mouthfeel is wet. Easy drinking enough. Reminds me of Samuel Smith's Taddy a little bit. Nice roasted flavor with a little coffee/smoke at the end. Not going to compete with Great Lakes Fitzgerald, Rogue Mocha, or Deschutes Black Butte, but overall a very good porter that I would recommend trying."
"Overall - Pretty good beer really. Huge malt backbone balanced out with some chocolate and coffee. Not too sweet, not too roasted and smoked, just smooth and easy to enjoy. A must try for porter fans."

"O: Overall, a delicious beer. Drinks very smoothly and has a variety of flavors which are all nicely balances. A great choice for anyone into porters."

""
""
""
""
"A good porter, but not worthy of ""outstanding"" status."
""
""
"You can see that the breeding is in this beer and it is obvious that the brewery has a skilled team putting out high quality beer. This Porter is technically sound and nicely crafted, but I have to be honest that I was left wanting just a little more."
""

"This porter is enjoyable enough, but since it isn't sold anywhere near me, I'm not going out of my way to find it."
""
""
"Good shelf porter. If it were cheaper for a 6 pack (I've only really seen it for $11-12/6 and would prefer something like $8 or $9 instead), it would be a great value. It's a fairly tame American porter that lags well behind more easily obtained American porters such as Edmund Fitzgerald or Black Butte, all of which are available in Chicago."
"Another beer by way of the creator of the canquest, woodychandler. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of bakers chocolate, some coffee as well. Taste is good, chocolate and coffee, smooth and easy drinking. Feels creamy in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer."
""
" O- Pretty good but maybe the 6.8% abv could be toned down."
""
""
"Very solid porter: toffee, caramel, tobacco, islay scotch, chocolate, instant coffee. Dark malts do their thing here, but overall the body and mouthfeel is thinner than I expected. It has a nice roasty bittersweet chocolate flavor that lingers on the back of your tongue. Not overwhelming, really well done. So far I've been impressed by Revolution's offerings and they do not let down with this porter. 84/100"

"Eugene is an outstanding porter that I find myself picking up often and enjoying each and every time. If I can't make up my mind at the liquor store I usually reach for this and head to the register."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall impression: Pretty good. Not great. Something just seemed a little ""off"" about this one but I couldn't put my finger on it. Seemed kind of disjointed. Maybe needs some time to age a little but the roast was harsh and the hops were pretty forward in this one. Probably won't seek out again."
""
""
""
""
""
"My Crack and inverted Glug netted me a big finger of dense, foamy, deep-brown head that also produced a faux-cascading action as it settled. Settling, it turned into one of the most unsettling beers ever. It was as dark as night in the middle of the ocean. SRM = 44+. I think that the Kraken may have been at the bottom of the glass. It was so deep-brown and dark that even the white bits was black. Nose was rich, like a chocolate cake made with dark chocolate. Velvety, chocolaty, but with a charcoal smokiness that just put me over the top. Mouthfeel was medium, but with a silkiness that reinforced the cake analogy. My, my, my. Finish was smoky, chocolaty, like my 5th (or so) birthday cake. More, please."
""
""
""
""
""
"I really like this beer. It's a very approachable porter, but also offers depths of flavor. I especially like the caramel notes that shine through and balance the bitter, roasted malts. This is definitely a porter worth checking out."

"O-A well made porter, the heat outside might have warmed it up too quickly but a nice brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour is cola brown with a light coffee head and some large bubbles. Nose is roast, pitted olive, light coffee rind, and some light chocolate cake batter. Body is full up front but thins in back. Taste is heavy roast, the other aspects from the nose are there but take a back seat to the roast. Highly carbonated through the finish and a touch slick on the back of the throat."

"A very tasty porter, and a good first impression."

"Eugene is a pretty hefty porter, but doesn't break character. Robust but not huge, with a thick body, there's a creamy texture to it that makes for good drinking. It leads into a dryer finish."
""
""
""
"O- Just extremely solid porter, absolutely delicious. I will be buying this again for the colder months but at this point I will be putting more emphasis on the lighter fare even though it is 80 degrees outside I can still drink this without worrying about it weighing me down too much. Cheers."

"Paired review a L'atelier 54 ring gauge, yes folks I'm smokin' high quality cigars with some of these fine craft brews these days, and guess what they mesh well. Here's the Revolution Brewing canned Eugene Porter with one of my favorite Pete Johnson blended cigars, this is his and his brothers project which translates as the workshop...I guess it's a way for them to branch out their creativity even more and involve his family in the business away from his Tatuaje lines. Anyways here's the beer, pours a pitch black body with absolutely no ruby highlights seeping through this thing eats the visible light spectrum up, light tan head forms thick and dwindles slow with minimal patchy streaked lacing around the sides of my nonic pint glass. First up the nares are filled with a deep dark chocolate creaminess minimal earthy pine accented hops peak through the waves of dark kilned barley. Really nice dry porter leaving the drinkability factor really high, I get dark chocolate roasts mild espresso with a hint of dark cherry fruit peaking through ending in a creamy velvet decadent place on my palate. Flavor wise I like the way the alcohol and the dark beer features dark roasts, earthy hops, and hints of fruit intermingle so nicely with a 6.8% abv canned porter this place ain't kidding around it's a revolution. Furthermore, I'm glad I'm adding some flavorful smokes to the mix because the synergy of both worlds is really complementing the overall experience mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with dark dry roasted malt finish lingering roasted malt bitterness and hops in the backend with a bit of warming effect left between sips from the higher abv in this American aggressive porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Easily one of my favorite porters. It is rich and robust, smooth & easy to drink. Looking forward to having more!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very solid porter. That being said, it falls a bit short of the upper echelon due to a lack of overall intensity. It just doesn;t have the smell/flavor punch of a Founders porter or Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald."
"It's a really solid porter all around. It has a respectable abv and is a smooth, easy drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Eugene Porter is good. The beer pours an opaque black with thin slightly off white head that is leaving a lace. The smell has hints of chocolate, coffee and peat. The taste is much of the same as the smeel but there is a definite caramel presence. The sweeter flavors start the beer and the coffee and earth linger on the pallet at the end. The mouthfeel is a medium body with smooth carbonation. Overall this is a good porter and I really thick the body....much better than watery."
""
""
""
"Lighter side of medium body, good amount of fine carbonation contributing to a fairly creamy sensation on the tongue. A decent porter."
""
""
"Really a stand out beer here. Were this available to me locally, I think I'd have regular stock of this in my fridge as my go-to dark beer. Thanks again, Wyatt!"
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: This is a rather tasty porter that goes down easy but leaves enough of a taste that I can enjoy it for the style that it is."
"O -- A winner of a porter."
""
""
""
""

"C+"
"O: Overall, I though this was incredible, after wandering around Chicago in freezing weather, one of the most delicious porters I've had in a while, maybe one of the best. Recommended by me for sure."
""
""
""
"Overall: A very nice porter for those who like chocolate, like me"
"Wow what an exceptional porter, color is very pitch black not surprising for 6.8% ABV. Has a mild 1/2 inch of opaque head with great lacing. Smell is very mild if anything I get some chocolate malt and a bit of coffee. Taste is excellent with chocolate malts leading giving me a sort of dark chocolate coffee roast, some lactic sweetness and very little chalky yeast. Mouth feel is somewhat creamy with a medium body. Overall quite an exceptional porter very easy to drink. I wish I could get it again as I picked this up in Vintage Estate in Ohio."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Incredibly drinkable. Fantastic porter. Highly recommended. Would have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad effort. Just doesn't stand up to the host of better porters out there."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours very dark brown, sits black in the glass with a light tan head. Smells is tons of smoke, some chocolate, pepper. Taste is a lot like the smell very smokey, peppery, small amount of dark cocoa, oaky. Mouthfeel is right on for a porter. This is really good, and worth trying, not too complex but great for a cold day and very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste-Dark roasted malt, coffee, chocolate. A bit of a dry finish. Creamy mouthfeel. A very tasty offering. Recommended."
""
""
""
"o - Overall a pretty solid porter. Nothing too crazy going on her ebut lots of nice chocolate and roasted malts throughout, and easy to drink. Worth checking out and probably the best beer the sports bar had on tap that night."
""
""
""
"Another can consumed while throwing some disc golf. Man I haven't thrown disc for almost 2 months, damn winter, giveth awesome skiing weather, taketh away disc golf. This was my first Revolution brew, and its a good one, I'm impressed and will look for more of them, hopefully I come across generous traders like CanisMajor again."
"O- This beer is not bad, I wish that Revolution had gone a bit bigger with the roasted notes. Frankly I wont buy this one again as I can easily get Edmund Fitz."
""
"The palate can be dry in the middle, but a little more slick on the finish. Very tasty porter thats easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Beer is medium bodied with carbonation at a low to medium-low intensity. This results in a fairly smooth beer, though somewhat stagnant for its weight. A bit more carbonation would help this feel slightly fuller, as well as aersolize the aroma further. Closes fairly dry, with moderate stickiness across the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: on-tap"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I love this beer. It's just heavy enough for a cold winter's day, but light enough to have more than one. I've been drinking it with very simple dishes. So far my favorite is a pint of this porter with a grilled cheese sandwich."
"O: Overall this is quite solid & I enjoyed it; I would love a bit more creaminess on the mouthfeel though the alcohol is already well balanced. I'll echo BB1313 in that this is good but Ohio is home to some fine porters that set the bar high."
"M - Medium body. Creamy. Light carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Thicken the body up on this beer and its going to be nuts! I really like the nose and the flavor and its a sexy looking to porter to boot. Revolution can brew good beer for sure!"
"I'd recommend picking up a grower to share."
"O- Somewhat of a disappointment to me. Maybe because I've been drinking a lot of RIS's lately but the thinner mouthfeel and subdued flavors left me wanting more. For my money, I'd go with edmund fitzgerald or founders if I'm looking for a porter."
"I'm not gonna lie, I was hoping for more. But it's still a very solid porter. Traditional and well crafted. There's nothing wrong with it at all, it just doesn't go the extra mile. It doesn't pop. I really dig the coffee aftertaste though. Maybe I'm just spoiled by some other easy to get porters in my area."
"I am now a fan of Revolution and l hope to taste more of their brews in the time to come (since the world didn't end last night)."
""
"Overall, this is a pretty solid porter, just wish the nose was bigger."
"12 ounce can, 6 pack packaging had a date of November 20, 2012 printed on it. Just not sure if that's the canning date or the best by date. Since Revolution is new to Ohio, I'll assume it's the canned on date. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The brew smells like roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, and some dark fruit. It tastes like roasted malt, dark fruit, caramel, bittersweet chocolate and some light hops. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's smooth and has moderate carbonation. I think it's a good brew, at $9.99 a 6-pack I'd buy this again."
""
""
"Overall- A very mild sessionable porter that you can buy in a can for a cookout of tailgate."
""
""
"D - Very solid and highly drinkable porter."
""
"O: A great porter. Balanced chocolate flavors make this easy drinking but satidfying."
"I've had this many times on draft and from the can. This review is from the can. Pour is jet black with dark brown dense head. Decent retention and almost no lace. The smell starts with big bold waves of chocolate and roasted barley. A touch of cream comes through next and smooths things out. Then comes a reasonably aromatic hop profile that adds a little pine to the mix. The taste has some sweetness up front with a heavy malt profile. Dry roasted grains, bitter chocolate, and some piney hops (Chinook?) balance things out. The flavors pop and provide for a very robust porter. Mouthfeel is smooth and appropriately carbonated. Overall, this is one of my favorite porters around, the only thing that competes with it is Founders Porter. This is a solid beer and an awesome value at $10 per six pack. This has become a mainstay in the fridge, enough said."
""
"(O)- Overall, its really a solid to great porter. Each time I have something by Revolution they meet or exceed my expectations. Well done"
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz can, pours near-black with brown at the edges when held to a light; thinner light brown head dissipates quickly leaving minimal lace. Aromas are roasty, bittersweet chocolate, coffee roast, faint anise. Tastes are sweeter but with plenty of roast, dark chocolate, oatmeal, molasses, coffee, mild earthy/piny bitterness at the end, but finishes exceptionally clean. At 7%, I think i can say the alcohol was well concealed, albeit it's not a huge ABV. Mouth-feel is velvety smooth, rich & creamy, while being medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, very solid porter! I would buy this again. I need to compare it back-to-back with some of my favorites, because this one holds its own!"
""
"Body is pretty well black, creamy brown headwind good retention and lacing. Nose of milk chocolate, light roast and some hop character. Some vanilla as well. Taste has some bitter roast, coffee, chocolate and bitter hopping. Some earthier flavours too. Body is fairly light, but carbonation is spot on as low as it is. A nice standard American porter."

"Poured from a can into a Founders snifter glass"
"Revolutions Eugene porter pours a nice deep black color with a 1 fingers worth of tan head. It's smell of coffee and roasted malt with a little bit of hops to balance it out. It's got a smooth taste with some good roast on the back end. The mouthfeel is very creamy which brings it all together. Another good solid brew from revolution"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just a phenomenal porter all around, gives Edmund Fitz a serious run for its money. Holds up as a pairing for meat and dessert."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Super solid for the price and I can see myself going back to this time after time"
""
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: A suprising porter. Very tasty."
""
""
"Got to enjoy this on tap at Blackfinn in Mount Prospect, IL. Poured a dark black, with a tiny light brownish/caramel colored head. Lacing is there but not too prevelant. The chocolate notes coat the mouth and the feel is exactly how a porter should feel. Not too thick, not light and a tiny bit of carbonation is found. A beautiful Porter and another fine brew from Revolution. Coulda gone wrong, but went waaaay right."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If the indecision between the nutty English brown ales, coffee or chocolate infused beers or crisper hop-forward American ales are keeping you from ordering, then have the best of all worlds with a glass of Eugene."
"O: Really enjoyed this. Revolution nailed the mouthfeel and taste, even though the aroma and appearance were a little lacking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's named for Gene Debs himself. Nice. Very nice. It pours a very dark sienna topped by a finger or so of tan foam. The nose comprises cocoa, mild roasted malts, brown sugar, light molasses, and a hint of cinnamon. The taste emphasizes the cocoa, even going so far as to layer a bit into milk and dark chocolate for my tongue's amusement. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a decently creamy feel. Overall, a very nice porter, indeed, something that may have supplanted Workingman Mild as my favorite Revolution brew..."
"On tap at the brewpub.A serviceable porter. Dark brown to black coloured body with a bit of head, lacey. Licorice and chocolate. Above average mouthfeel. Carbonation was right there. Decent drinkability, but I am coming out here paying good money and time to get something bold not something I could take out of the fridge for a couple of dollars."
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium body, creamy roast, nice lingering body and bitter grains. It's a decent porter.with some coffee character. Not fantastic but pretty good."
""
"Cost:$18 for a 64 oz growler."
""
"Had on-tap at The Norse. This was very dark and opaque with a nice frothy tan head. Black roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, dry finish, completely delicious with a full-bodied kind of feel and a lactic acid sweetness. Very drinkable--the boyfriend informs me that it was a ""BEAUTIFUL beer," and I think I agree."
""
""
""
"O: A very solid and flavorful porter. High drinkability. I recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - An excellent porter, to say the least. If you're in Chicago and see this on tap, get it (if you like the style). It's really good."
""
""
""
"This is a quality porter that Rev has year round. Balanced, and though it is rich it is far from boozy."
"Overall, an excellent example of the style, albeit a bit on the sweet side. Very drinkable and will be great as a cold weather brew."
"It's a robust porter, so it's dark brown and has fantastic chocolate and coffee notes. It's got a gorgeous brown head, and the contrast in colors between the beer and the foam make this beer look like a doberman or rottweiler but it's so sweet (not literally) it's name could be ""princess"". This beer was named ""Best beer in Chicago"" in 2010. I don't recall who named it that, but I don't necessarily disagree. I've had this on tap, on cask, and even Bourbon Barrel Aged... it just won't stop being awesome. It's 7% abv is quite well hidden (8.5% in the BBA version I believe), and if it's fairly big body wasn't there to slow you down, you could easily find yourself quite over-served after more than two or three. This is a fine beer in the summer, and one of the best around come Winter in Chicago."
"I really, really liked this one, but at the same time I have other porters in my area that will suffice in my time away from Chicago."
"O - Pretty nice flavors, alcohol is well hidden, quite fulfilling. This one has a decent amount of heft to it, would drink again."
"Overall: Perhaps the best of the everyday lineup from Revolution. One of the best American Porters I have had yet. Smooth, complex and incredibly tasty, just a great beer all around."
"O: Great beer from Revolution. Very good porter, will def seek out again."
"OVERALL: After sampling a flight of six or seven of Revolution's beer two made the final cut to take home in a growler. I ended up going with the Anti-Hero IPA, but the Eugene was the other beer, so I had one more at the pub. This goes down very easy for a 7%er and I look forward to another the next time I'm at Revolution."
"Pours a dark brown color with a good tan head that leaves behind a bit of lacing and sticks around for awhile. The nose is really nice and chocolatey. Really love the level they've used. Under that, a bit of roasted malt but this was mostly about the chocolate. The taste isn't quite as nice, though the chocolate notes really still stand out. The feel was quite nice with a full body. Pretty viscous for what it is. Drinks quite well. I'm a big fan."
" D- This beer is a gentle ""hand-holding"" type of porter that is easy going and soft. Not much depth or character that I would expect for a cask but easy to drink none the less."
"HV"
"D-For the complexity that you get with this one, it's also insanely drinkable. By far the best beer on cask I've had yet."
"Best of their offerings, hope this is a mainstay. Fantastic sipper."
"Rich and full flavored Porter here, that was made even more easy feeling and drinkable on cask. I really dug on this one and would have happily put another pint away if there weren't already so many other stellar choices available."
"Pours a black color. 2/3 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, hint of chocolate, and a hint of hops. Fits the style of an American Porter. Mouth feel is sharp and smooth with an average carbonation level. There is also a noticeable dryness and bitterness. Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, alcohol, hint of chocolate, and a hint of hops. Overall, good body, blend, and appearance with an interesting mouth feel."
"solid mouthfeel contrasts well with the lingering bitterness"
"The feel is ok, a little on the lighter side."
"I never really got into Porters all that much, but man I really dig this brew. I must have had 5 or 6 of them while we were at the brewery. Very good beer, very drinkable, but STRONG - a dangerous combo. =)"
"D: Fantastic and very drinkable. A great, clean, and uncluttered example of the style."
"Jet black with a creamy head tends to dissipate yet cling to the glass. Very roasty and chocolately taste. It is fairly thick but not nearly as chewy as the Founders Porter (my current benchmark for the style). Definitely the best beer they had on tap for their opening."
