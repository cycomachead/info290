3.91,-3,3.25,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured into two snifters.  Amber brown color with just a tiny bit of film head.  plenty of carbonation.  Smell is very nice.  Oaky funk.  Taste is subtly sweet and funky.  Does not dry out and go uber funky but it is a nice subtle funky after feeling.  at 11.49 a bottle for 12.5 ozs there are better valued beers but this one is nice.  not very nice but nice.  I would not call this a Weizenbock like the style listed; 10c bjcp 2014.  It is a Cuvee, or to me 28c Soured Fruit Beer, which is a blend of beers which are then secondary fermented in a vessel.  In this case the blend is the 10c types Tap 6 Aventinus and Aventinus Eisbock.  The Vessels are French Oak Chardonnay.  The yeast strain for secondary fermentation is unknown to me.  Probably lacto or brett.","coriswrasse","0"

This is that kind of beer; an attempt to show other brewers that the staid Germans can knock off a geeky item or two, if they want.  This is not going to be a chewy kind of beer; more sinewy and balanced. $13 is a lot to pay for about 12 oz's, though.","BeerIsland","Dec 16, 2014"

4.06,0.7,,,,,,"2014 bottle, notes that this is aged in Chardonnay barrels (unlike the other versions, I think which were aged in Pinot barrels). Pours deep dark brown with a tinge of red on the edges and  ahalf finger of off white head that recedes quickly. Aroma is tart and vinous, with some paint thinner notes, vinegar, plums, acidic in my nostrils. Flavor is sour black cherries, heavy wine notes, clean finish leaving a lightly tart, dry oaky finish on the palate. Heavier for a sour, in the Flanders range of brews, with some light yet prickly carbonation. This was pretty good, but also quite a detour from Aventinus.","BMMillsy","Nov 15, 2014"

Harsh, solvent like and very tough to drink with lots of chemical flavor and vinegar. There's some decent barrel flavor, mostly dry oak and sweet vinous fruit but the acetic acid is so overpowering, it kills off most of the pleasant flavors.

Upon opening at a good temperature with a nice "pop", there was an appealing aroma of caramel, vanilla, and balsamic vinegar. Poured with a small, thick, creamy, tan head that soon vanished and no lace. Color is a very hazy brown. Sticking my schnoz in the glass yielded besides the above, leather, fruit, and spice. Flavor's similar to nose with tart up front, then bittersweet. Body is good, but carbonation is low. Finish is like flavor, average length, has alcohol warmth. I like the base beers much better.","drpimento","0"
