4.01,-1.2,3.75,4,4,4.25,4,"The feel is excellent; rich and silky, there's a nice. active bite of crispness that contributes with the wheat in the medium body and a tight carbonation to form a very nice and lasting smoothness.","Brenden","Jan 23, 2013"

4.83,19,5,4.5,5,5,4.75,"A warm aroma, and even warmer flavor...a recognizable alcohol presence. Exploding with typical "weizen" flavors, like clove and banana...easily drinkable, with a smooth finish, but some linger, as one would expect from a "dunkelweiss" or "weizenbock" (as Fat Head's brewery describes this brew), It is a more full-bodied weizen bier; dark in color, with a noticeable body...mmmMMMM!!!","Liberty733","Sep 14, 2011"
4.32,6.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall like the wheat wine I am also impressed with their ability to make a very drinkable Weizenbock. Recommended!","DrDemento456","Sep 12, 2011"
3.88,-4.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy orange-ish to amber color with a light tan head. In the aroma, dark fruit and a mellow wheat presence. In the taste, small dry dark fruit and a nice presence of banana in the end. A small bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry banana dark fruit like aftertaste. Nice presence of dry banana to mix with the dark fruit.","OWSLEY069","Sep 12, 2011"
4.2,3.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a hazed light brown. Aroma of bubblegum, banana and clove. In the taste, heavy on the banana, alittle spice and alcohol burn. Pretty much estery yeast giving off the banana flavors, which is the one dimensional, yet very nice flavor profile. Some brown sugar, caramel and more banana. Mouthfeel medium bodied and smooth. Overall, a nice brew sure to please any wheat fan.","Stinkypuss","Sep 04, 2011"
4.42,8.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"O: One of the better weizenbocks that I have tasted. Nicely blended flavors that you would expect. Would certainly enjoy this on a crisp fall evening.","IronCitySteve","Aug 27, 2011"
4.23,4.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"O- A very drinkable and great tasting weizenbock. I would get this one again if I did not want Head Hunter IPA all night.","Hoptometrist","Aug 20, 2011"
4,-1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"D: Not too many weizenbocks out there - but this is one of the better ones i've had. Easily drinkable - Every beer from Fat Heads has been a pleasant surprise so far.","ckollias","Mar 02, 2011"
4.28,5.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"D/O Really good for a beer at this ABV point, I will most likely drink 3 Weizen glasses full and enjoy them! 4.0","adamette","Feb 24, 2011"
3.74,-7.9,5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"upon initial wafting of beer to nose, it was a bit underwhelming. banana fumes, yeasty, malt and some mild citrus. not bad smelling - just not overpowering. upon tasting this growlered nectar, I got a nice spicy taste with the corresponding tastes as found in the aroma: maltiness, yeastiness, bread, biscuit - some caramel malt became more prevalent at the end of the taste. not too bad - but nothing overwhelming. decent body and mouthfeel, light to medium. plenty of carbonation with a slight amount of lingering bitterness. while not wowed in tasted, this beer was rather drinkable.","Hophead101","Nov 20, 2010"
3.53,-13.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a hazy copper-brown with a good off-white head and some good lacing as it goes down the glass. The nose brings forward a strong clove presence with a bit of bubble gum, banana, and malt in the background. Strong yeasty components throughout. Some dark fruits are present in the taste along with quite a bit of clove and spicy yeast. A bit too much brown-sugar, however. The mouthfeel was pretty rich with a bit of booze. Altogether, a pretty solid beer but not something I would seek out again.","Thorpe429","Oct 19, 2010"
4.12,1.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"D - solid all around, hitting all the typical looks, smells, and tastes of the style. not much unique about it, though there doesnt need to be. another solid beer from an up and coming brewery.","Stigs","Beers"
3.95,-2.7,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"The mouthfeel is creamy with a kiss of carb.  Really good for the style.  Some lingering wheat, sweetness, and bubblegum and raisin linger.  This is a kick-ass American stab at one of the greatest, most perfect beers ever in my opinion (Aventinus).   But the beer falls just a touch short and the flaws make it a disappointment considering the Fat Heads Hefe is just amazing.  Still worth a tick, er, trip.","jampics2","0"
