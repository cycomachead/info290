Today, wanted it,walked to a couple (local in walking distance) bars to get it on tap. : ).  I consider this a "1.5" IPA. It's not quite a double but def not a single.  More of a crisp, clean IPA, no real malt, but nothing on the citrussy side, more of a lemony, organic taste. No real sweetness or floral flavor like a Racer 5 or 2 hearted,  just straight hops with a touch of slight fruit bite. Settles smoothly on the tongue and even after taste. I could drink these all night, although at my age and # of kids! that won't happen any time soon. LOL. Becoming a big fan of Southern Tier.","hotpauko","Jan 13, 2015"

While I could see the hop profile rubbing some people the wrong way (onion/garlic is not something you really expect in a beer), in my eyes it blends quite nicely with the other hop notes and slight alcohol flavour. A fabulous beer that I hope to return to eventually, since it is not available in my home market.","thehyperduck","Jul 22, 2014"

Aromas are pleasantly floral and resinous with a distant whiff of pineapple. Just a had a KAPOW! This beer fires on all cylinders. So well rounded: initially sweet with caramel and a hint of cotton candy before a big orange peel and piney hops balance them out in the middle. A tangy pineapple and bitter orange zest linger long on the finish. Medium to full bodied, as befits a beer of such potency and strength of flavor. An outstanding double IPA.","droomyster","Jul 21, 2014"

I don't review them because I feel in order to review a beer, I need to get through a full glass. And some IPA's, I just can't. They taste like I'm drinking soap. But the 2XIPA isn't that way. It has a nice sweet blend to ease the bitter hops. It rivals DFH 90 minute. I would definitely drink more 2XIPA, and may go down as one of the great IPA's, as far as I'm concerned.","EvoRich","Apr 23, 2014"

Like I said, not a bad brew and it will certainly appeal to any hophead, but if you're looking for an outstanding DIPA, look elsewhere.

Grapefruit, orange, and tropical fruit aromatics join slight pine resin notes and a touch toasted bread. Caramel and lightly toasted malt flavors are quickly subdued by big flavors of tropical fruit, grapefruit, lemon zest, and a touch of pepper. Very well balanced, this beer is medium-light in body with a slightly lower than expected amount of carbonation. Extremely drinkable, this beer seems to come off more as a double Pale Ale than a double Indian Pale Ale.","phishsihq","Feb 16, 2014"

Medium bodied with a slick mouthfeel. Well carbonated so that it supports the body. The flavor profile is a well balanced blend of hop flavor, bitterness and malt sweetness. It starts with some grapefruit and pine, then the bitterness and finishes slightly sweet. The alcohol is almost completely hidden. The finish is between crisp and smooth with a lingering bitterness and tartness. An outstanding IPA, but not quite as good as Founder's Harvest, NoDa Hop Drop or Lagunita Sucks. It is, however, more complex than they.","tillmac62","Jan 13, 2014"

Don't be fooled though, you are drinking a fully flavored beer. Frankly, this could be a beer you enjoy in the North Carolina beach heat (not a bunch but a few). The alcohol taste is there but Minimal. The finish is there and lasts as I expect and enjoy in an IPA.","Tank880","Nov 12, 2013"

Pine and citrus with a bit of grapefruit and resin, light bready caramel malt provides a hint of balance. The flavor is fruity hops with lots of citrus and pine and a bit of caramel to round it all out. Solid but smooth hop bitterness. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick resinous mouthfeel. Nice smooth flavorful IPA, I really enjoyed this.","johnnnniee","Sep 21, 2013"

Occasion: enjoying an evening of Strat, music and good beer....Appearance: slightly hazy, lightly golden body with cascading effervescence; head is snow white, snow deep and beautifully laced; quite an attractive ale out the box... Aroma: the bottle boasts four separate hops varieties--and the nostril is bombarded by harsh pine cone and soft department store perfume counter, almost lilac and lavender; secondary citrus and grapefruit sneak in... Palate: as expected, a full-bodied, full-on attack at the teeth with a bit of warmth at the end; second and third sips ease the intensity, but the warmth remains...Taste: as promised, a near-mad balance of hops and malts, with the bitterness being more palpable yet not as put-offish as some maltreated double IPAs...Overall: After a rabid camp discussion on the virtues of the double IPA, I made this part of a build-a-six and am not disappointed with the selection...not mentioned among the thirty or so we pleasantly recalled, this beer gets the taste buds titillated while bringing enough disguised alcohol to only need a few for the weeknight...recommended and part of the double IPA discussion for doing much well...","dacrza1","Jul 25, 2013"

Mouthfeel is definitely on the light side for a DIPA, with above average carbonation. Normally I would want a heavier body for a DIPA, but this lighter body helps keep the intense piney-ness from being overwhelming, also making it a surprising refreshing 8.2% beer.","JG-90","Jun 17, 2013"

Light citrus, faint grass and pale malt. Taste is crisp and so easy to drink. The hops come forward nicely with touches of lemon and grapefruit. The pale malt stands up just sweet, sturdy and strong. Hops and malt both sweeten up as the beer warms. Finishes with a long bitter aftertaste, and a dry malt presence that makes this a dapper DIPA.","utopiajane","Jun 10, 2013"

The hops are without a doubt a bit more subtle than I expected them to be, but their presence makes itself known throughout, with the solid grain backbone soon following. It's not necessarily the most complex DIPA on the block, but it's undeniably easy going and perfect for even the most casual settings. Not my favorite in the style, but definitely one that I can commend for its original recipe that breaks the mold for once.","magictacosinus","May 22, 2013"

It smells heavy of corn, not sure what is going on there?? The taste is alright but I've had so many DIPA's that put this to shame.

The smell is floral and citrus, sort of understated, but there nonetheless. Taste is where this really shines. It has that nice massive grapefruit flavor followed by a satisfying bitterness.

This is more of an English double ipa if anything. Still very good, but lately with a few certain APA's I've reviewed it has nowhere near the hop profiles those particular pales had. I was a bit disappointed at first due to the lack of gushing hops, but quickly reminded myself that a beer doesn't have to be overdone with hops to be top shelf, so why does every ipa have to be hopped up? The fact is, this isn't your traditional American double ipa, but just a dang good blue collar beer thats well crafted and has its bright spots. I'll have this again one day for certain.","BradtheGreat7","Feb 18, 2013"
4.32,7.2,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.75,4.25,"This is another great example of the difference between bottled beer and what you get on tap. In bottles, it's a decent DIPA, but nothing special. On tap, this is a a great summer-time ale. Very light in color, very refreshing, but nicely hoppy and very delicious. Also easy to get in the northeast and affordable. If you weren't impressed in the bottle, give it a try on tap!","dougfur","Feb 17, 2013"

The maltiness and hoppiness interact to create a tangy, piney, and sweet nose. Moutfheel is thin and wet, but suits the style. It's not quite as malty as the nose leads one to expect. It's a rather unique tasting IPA. Some pine is present and some Smarties candy. A lot of freshness. Some grapefruit bitterness. Finishes cleanly. Pretty good.","DocJitsu","Dec 23, 2012"

The hop profile opens up a bit as it warms, and in the end this is a very agreeable, not over the top, solid DIPA. Considering it’s typically about $11/ sixer (at least in upstate NY), this is a pretty good value that delivers the hops without clobbering you over the head with either malt or blinding bitterness.

Enjoyable but not a real special beer for the style (which is one of my favorites).","dbrauneis","Sep 24, 2012"

That's not to say that 2XIPA isn't a great beer. On the other hand, Southern Tier's 2XIPA is much easier to drink - which is saying a lot, because even at 9.1% abv, Resin is an easy drinker. I could even call 2XIPA a sessionable beer, and at 8.2% abv that's quite an accomplishment. A very fine beer that I'm glad to have finally tried.","BradenMK","Sep 22, 2012"

4.2,4.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Excellent - an intense double IPA that nonetheless displays good balance between the malt and hops. Bitter but not too bitter, with a pleasing spiciness. The individual hop flavours are indistinct but mesh nicely with the malt and yeast. The only improvement would be an increase in carbonation, which would add to the mouthfeel. Not sure if this quite adds up to twice the 'regular' IPA, but a fantastic brew that is well worth sampling.","jazzyjeff13","Jun 02, 2012"

Aromas of huge grapefruit orange, pine, herbal spiciness, floral, lemon zest, caramel, and light breadiness. Fantastic aromas here, plenty of citrus. Taste of big pine, grapefruit, herbal spiciness, orange, biscuit, caramel, and floral notes. Good amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pine, grapefruit, herbal spiciness, orange, and caramel. Fantastic malt balance in this, bitterness is not overwhelming at all like some DIPAs. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a lightly creamy mouthfeel. Very smooth drinking, but it is still a bit of a sipper. Alcohol is nicely hidden with only a warming after the finish. Overall this is an exceptional DIPA.

But then again, this is just a malty DIPA and not so much in the hop area so maybe it just falls into the malty DIPA catergory instead of the hoppy fruity piney. DIPA catergory. I recommend it and as I recall it was one of the cheaper DIPA 6 packs. Thumbs up from me. Prost!","IPAguy2009","Jan 11, 2012"

Malty undercurrents as should be expected for the style. Like it so far. The taste is pretty smooth with growing grapefruit, tangelo, orange peel and hop spiciness. It has a pleasing under current of sweet smooth malts. One of the smoothest 2x IPAs I have had. I like the subtle spiciness. Hops seem a nice blend of American and continental.

Its big in my book, a good medium mouthfeel and awesome finish. This being a dipa, you do get the alcohol and deep hop flavor. Southern Tier is up and coming. Could be a big hitter on the east coast. Watch out !","carolinahophead","Nov 05, 2011"
3.93,-2.5,4.5,4,4,3,4,"Overall - The pour alone clues you in that this one will be different than the average imperial IPA. And it is. Such fresh fruity flavors are rarely found in any IPA. I feel like this could be made into a chewing gum. The hops are present, but serving a very different purpose - we have shades of the average IPA, a bit of pine, a bit of a floral here and there in the herbal taste, plenty of bitter background. But overall, this is just a surprisingly fruity beer. A delicious one, to be sure. However, it’s a simple beer. I find that once I get over the surprise of the tropical citrus flavor, there’s really not a lot else to it. The beer is the same from start to finish. Fun, drinkable, tasty, but not a lot to pay attention to. I bet it makes a killer six pack, though.","paperbackfoster","Nov 04, 2011"

3.77,-6.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Wow....there is alot going on with the Southern Tier 2X IPA...sheesh! The appearance is a golden yellow, clear, with little carbonation and very little, mostly non-existent head...that looks white in color. The smell is complex hops and malt. I believe the hops include Semcoe for the body and slightly citrus notes....other is possibly East Kent Hops. The other two....could possibly be casscade and ???. One of the malts used is sweet....all blended together to mask the 8%+ ABV. The taste is well balanced....hops definitely power the beer, the malt is used to keep bitterness at bay and to help clean the pallate on the after taste. Overall it is a crazy beer, definitely worth trying. One per session would be enough though.","WoodBrew","Oct 03, 2011"

Taste is of herbal/floral hops, muted malt flavors, and a cooked vegetable aftertaste. There is a slight hop astringency on the palate after each sip. This beer has a pretty good carbonation level with a smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good DIPA but nothing great. The cooked vegetable aromas and flavors seem to fade as the beer warms which is odd but the beer gets better in this regard.","UCLABrewN84","Sep 23, 2011"

Nose of citrus and some tropical fruits. Sweet caramel bill with notes of honey, some biscuit. Odd notes of some overripe banana (odd but not unwelcome) with more pineapple and passionfruit. Taste has nice malt notes with hints of vanilla, biscuit, pine and some tropical hop notes. Alcohol comes through in the midmouth, mildly sticky and chewy mouthfeel. Great feel and good weight. Exceptional drinkability and a hop profile I really dig. Freshness probably takes this down a notch or two, but I'm sure this hits the nail on the head when had on tap. Very nice.","liamt07","Aug 29, 2011"

3.82,-5.2,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"It's good--I never would've disputed that. It represents perfectly, however, the oversaturated hop market in craft beers these days. This showed up at my local Harris Teeter, and I was glad to see it! Still, I can get Two-Hearted there. I get Sweetwater IPA at the local Wal-Mart. This is a malty version of one of those. It's good, but lacks hop appeal of the near-perfect Two Hearted selections and ratios. Had this beer beat 90Min down here, we'd be watching Southern Tier on Discovery Channel. Though good--even among those peers, it's nothing better than what's already around locally. It's mouthfeel falls short of both the aforementioned beers (Two Hearted citrusness and 90Min's malt profile are simply better), but I suppose it's a worthwhile hop rep. A IIPA rep...?

The aroma is highly hoppy--burst of lemon citrus, hints of grapefruit and pine. The flavor is quite hoppy--flavors like the nose, high hop bitterness, with an underlying sweet, chewy malt backbone. The beer finishes with a bit of dry hop on the palate and a slightly glow in my belly. The body is medium-full and carbonation moderate.

2.24,-44.4,4,2.5,2,2,2,"No dating on the bottle, so conceivably it's older than ideal, but the hops in the nose certainly seem to be of the muted variety. Citric and earth notes are certainly there, but aren't particularly lively. Plenty of light sweet maltiness. Taste is disappointing. It's a smoothish and thickish beer with plenty of sweet pale malt, but a shortage of hop character. An odd hint of savory is almost as prominent as the muted earthy and citric hops. I might give this a try again sometime on tap, but no more undated bottles.","PDXHops","Jul 13, 2011"
4.47,10.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Clear copper hue. Carbonation can be seen rising to the top of this clear hued brew. This IPA has an excellent flora and fruit aroma. There is so much in the bouquet its hard to begin. I can imagine smelling ripe apricot and plum, add to that honey and daffodil and walnut and you get the idea that this is a complex concoction. While the fruity flowery aroma shows no sign of hops, the flavor sure does. Hops is the first flavor characteristic from this busy ale. Its followed by a sweet honey and beady malt. The fruit is not as noticeable a flavor, probably buried by triple variety of hops. Palate is sticky because of the sweetness associated to the taste. Most IPAs are overly grassy, this one is actually a bit heavy on the honey sweetened malt.","PatLarsen","Jul 10, 2011"

Not really my thing, not much finesse or depth here.","ritzkiss","Jul 04, 2011"
3.92,-2.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Sampled from a bottle with no freshness date. Deep yellow in color with a orange hue. Poured with a very brief fizzy white head that quickly reduced to a thin wispy cap. Grapefruit and citrus orange hop aromas mesh nicely with pine hop aromas with an underlying sweetness. Medium bodied and lightly resinous with even, refreshing carbonation. Citrus orange and grapefruit flavors in the beginning and through the middle with a light, bready, sweet maltiness beneath. What little maltiness there is, tapers toward the finish as pine hop bitterness is introduced right before a semi-dry ending. This is a solid DIPA. Great citrus and grapefruit flavors, abv isn’t too high, very refreshing, and very available. One of my favorites.","IronLover","Jul 03, 2011"

3.92,-2.7,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Overall- I am somewhat disappointed from this one, I was really expecting more from such a quality brewery that makes some of my favourite big bodied stouts. I mean the typical DIPA flavours were all there but they were not as intense or even as well balanced as a real world class DIPA should be, there is way too much bready malt dominating the palate, it almost takes over all the piney hop flavours.

The taste is of grapefruit, oranges, hints of lemon, hibiscus, and a whiff of pine. bitterness is present, but not over the top.

A good enjoyable beer.","cyrenaica","Jun 25, 2011"
3.93,-2.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Appearance is a classic big IPA bright orange. A little light on the head but laces decently. Aroma isn't huge, but there is some malt complexity and plenty of hops. It's satisfactory but not mind blowing or anything. Taste is quite good, plenty of malt backbone and big bitterness up front. Mouthfeel is excellent. Very smooth, with nothing objectionable. Overall, I'd recommend trying it. It's a respectable DIPA and a decent value. Not sure why I've always avoided Southern Tier brews in the past...probably because it's made in NY (like many terrible beers such as Mendocino, ironically made on the opposite coast from its namesake).","chicagoabbot","Jun 23, 2011"

There's a lot to like in the malt bill on 2xIPA, especially if you like a bit of buttery diacetyl with your hops. Hops seem a bit stepped on in areas where you'd hope they'd punch your tongue, but there's something to be said for modesty and achieving a balance. Very good stuff, I'd surely pick up a bomber.","Gambrinus1184","Apr 30, 2011"

It's not as hop-forward as you expect from an IPA, certainly not as alcoholic as you expect from a *double* IPA, and the carbonation is also relatively low for the style, though delightfully silky. There's plenty of hops flavor to dig into, however. Piney, yes. Floral, definitely—like drinking hops infused rose pedals. It's also a tad buttery. As I said, unusual, but quite likable, and quite drinkable. Three left in the sixer, and they may just get finished tonight. ;)","gregalobeer","Apr 26, 2011"

These are my favorite imperials: the ones that are incredibly hoppy, but still maintain drinkability to the fullest extent, and aren't overly bitter. This beer truly was a surprise; I seem to have worked my way on the southern tier totem pole starting at the wrong point. I started with gemini ($9/22oz) and was somewhat disappointed for the price, then I got the oaked unearthly ($8/22oz) which was much better, in fact, great, but still so pricey.

It pours a very golden crisp and clear looks like a belgian IPA. Leaves a very pretty white head and laces well down the glass. Smell is floral and a bit medicinal with a little smoke and a little soap. Taste is rather different but hoppy though not hoppy as hell or a least not enough to be a DIPA. The uniqueness of the brew fades as it warms and gets a little less complex. The alcohol becomes more pronounced and noticable and the medicine taste mixes with the floral and resin not in a bad way - rather pleasant. Mouth feel is a bit sticky and mildly oily. Had this with some extra sharp cheddar and really was great. Would buy this brew again to try with a meal.","jizfiasco","Apr 14, 2011"

4.7,16.6,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"O: While not quite as startling as many DIPAs, this is definitely no slouch (I might have named it 1.5XIPA). Plenty of hops without the bitterness that can be so tiring. The downside, such as it is, is that it's easy to keep drinking this. And at a very well hidden 8.2% ABV, this can be a problem. While Southern Tier brews a fine line of go-to beers, I've never really been blown away by any of them. 2XIPA is a notable exception. If you've got a craving for, say, DFH 90, this won't do it for you. But if you want to engage in conversation on non-beer topics while smugly enjoying your beer, this is an excellent choice.","mikehartigan","0"

Piny, and grapefruit citrus perfume come off first, then heavy sweet malts take over. The taste is almost the same but the citrus seems more pungent and the bitterness of the hops tops off the sweetness of the malts for a nice blend. 2xipa has a medium body to it that plays well in the mouth, sweet, bitter and hoppy as a DIPA should be.

More of hop showcase, than an assault, the flavor turned peppery at the end of the sip, and stayed that way in the aftertaste.

There is a light alcohol flavor which is blended well with hop flavor and a balanced malt backbone. The mouthfeel is medium-light with medium-high carbonation.

I find freshness is paramount with this beer, and since they don't bottle date, that becomes quite difficult to determine when purchasing by the bottle.

The hops are certainly left to shine as there isn't much sweetness or heavy malt flavors to counter balance the hops. 2XIPA has a dry chewy mouthfeel that lingers in the back corners of my mouth.

This one is 100% clear and more yellow that you usually see with double IPAs. If I didn't know better, based on looks alone I would think this is a fizzy macro lager. But right away the nose tells me otherwise: hops, for sure, but plenty of fruit- with this I actually get non-citrus- more like tropical/pineapple/mango . OK, so the four types of hops do their part, but let's check on those malts... yep, they hold up with a fantastic touch of chocolate and/or caramel. But those flavors don't overstay their welcome and lead to a manageably bitter finish. No issues with drinkability, as I'm guessing ABV (not listed on the label) is higher than it tastes.

Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation on the palette. The finish is dry and the alcohol warming is moderate.

4,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Reviewed from my notes. The beer has a golden orange color and a white foam head. Within the liquid I can see a a few clumps of bubbles clinging to the sides of my glass, as well as a lot of rising streams of carbonation. After a short while, this tapers off to just a few bubbles making their way upward. The aroma features some warm pine hops and some malt in the back. The flavor has a good hop presence that is better but not excessive. Before the hops kick in, I can taste some pale malts. Hop oils and warm alcohol are on display in the finish and linger on. It's a full bodied beer with plenty of carbonation and bitter flavors to feel on my tongue. There is some coating, but it isn't very sticky. It is very drinkable though, considering the style. I could handle a 12oz bottle or two of this in an evening. I wouldn't want much more than that, but I certainly wouldn't be opposed to another pair the next day, after my pallet recovered.","ToasterChef","Sep 28, 2010"

Nose expresses sweet grapefruit on a malty backbone, with a suggestion of medicinal/earthy hops at the back. Taste consistent with nose; however, not as sweet as initially anticipated, although it offers a fairly nice balance between sweet and bitter. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lively carbonation and a fairly crisp finish. There's also a little oiliness to the texture; however, the carbonation disperses the character a bit.

Body of melon, and whipped cream, bit of candi sugar sweetness and vanilla, with a moderate hoppy bite of lemon Pez candy and pine.

The taste is more about the pine and caramel, though a small hint o' leek makes its way in there too. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a mostly smooth feel.

Tasty DIPA, ample but not overwhelming hop crunch, I'm getting notes of citrus, pine, mint on the hoppy side, and biscuits and smooth malt on the sweat end. Balanced.

Plenty of bitter grapefruit, pine, citrus pith and lemon zest assault my tongue. There is a nice spice character in there as well that really brightens up the flavors. There seems to be a major bitter component going on here, but an ample amount of pale biscuity malt is there to hold it all up. Very balanced, yet still doing a great job of showcasing the hops.

Pine and pungent pink grapefruit, tangerine citrus drive the nose, as floral as herbaceous, spreads broadly rather than penetrate, any pepperiness ably met by peach, nectarine scents, overall comes across as too subdued for a DIPA. Medium-bodied, a little more verve here and willingness to "get after it." Flowery, the sweet tangerine, pink grapefruit, lime citrus teases out more apricot, peach, pear than in the nose. In spite of this sweetness, and lower grassiness, the carbonation strongly swirls, enough to power it at least through the mid-palate.

Taste is of grapefruit, with the other hop flavors as noted in the scent, a fair bit of alcohol and only moderate bitterness, the backbone is of a toasted bread like malt and is pretty prevalent on the finnish.

Hops in the taste are smooth and almost sweet. Overall very clean tasting as well, which is unusual for this style. Mouthfeel is about medium, with the hops clearly dominating the malt.

Surprisingly, alcohol is noticeable too. A touch of cookie dough too? The palate opens with a blend of hops and alcohol, with there being a pronounced piney, moderately grapefruit like bitterness, along with some moderate tangerine flavors. The balance leans towards bittering hops on this one, and that does help balance the simple but noticeable malt character that has sugar and a little dough. However, there still does appear to be a flavor that I can only describe as a stale malt flavor. Drying and bitter on the finish, this beer coats the palate with a resiny character. Medium light in body, the carbonation is a touch high but not outrageously so. All told, a solid beer, albeit one that I might not reach for too often.","DefenCorps","Jun 14, 2010"

When it finally does recede it absolutely coats the side of the glass with lacing, well done Southern Tier. The nose is a total citrus bomb, almost pure grapefruit. The beer's flavor is totally hop dominated, citrus notes make a return, and there's some noticeable pine flavor as well. A bready malt presence is appreciable, but just barely as a backdrop to showcase the hops. The beer's body is unsurprisingly thin given the low residual sweetness, but this doesn't work to the beer's detriment. Carbonation is slightly high to further accent the hops, average for the style. No real alcohol presence, and a relatively clean hop flavor render this brew pretty drinkable.","axeman9182","Jun 13, 2010"

Initial pour left an active, foamy head that settled into a light pool of suds rather quickly. Lots of pine and citrus in the nose. No doubt what style of beer this is from the aroma. Lots of grapefruit. I can tell from the aroma that the wife will like this one (she likes those grapefruity ipa's). Initial tastes packs a nice balance of grassiness and citrus. A noticeable combination of several hops. I can't really taste any alcohol here. A nice bitterness rounds out the taste. It doesn't pack that usual double IPA bite, but it's still quite tasty.

The "It's not IPA, it's not DIPA," waffling is maybe a little silly, but accurate. I can't see this cracking too many "top 5 IPA" lists, but it satisfies a hophead's need for a fix, and tastes good. It has to be noted that $10 for a 6 pack of this is a great deal; that's cheaper than a 4 pack of 90min IPA, and while the latter is a better beer, it's not that much of a better beer, and 2XIPA may deliver a bit more west coast style hop pleasure to boot.

3.85,-4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Picked up a single from Abe's. The beer appears a clear amber with a short white head. The aroma, frankly, comes off a bit soapy. The hops smell richly of perfume and fruit essence with pine. The flavor pulls in more spicy apricot and orange peel, but it all feels too light for a DIPA. It reminds me of how light ST Pale was, but that beer seemed to be more complex. I appreciate that this is more drinkable, but it could use a hint of malt and more variation in the hops.","tempest","May 08, 2010"
3.95,-2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"As a DIPA, this beer falls short of Hopslam, Dreadnaught, etc. If you look at it as an IPA it is above average. Nonetheless, it is a nice edition to Southern Tier, especially at $9.99 a sixer. Recommended to anyone that likes a hop delight.","BB1313","May 08, 2010"
4.8,19.1,5,5,4.5,5,5,"This was unquestionably one of the best examples of a double IPA I have sampled. Southern Tier has been putting out many excellent releases but, in my opinion, this is definitely their finest to date. If you are a fan of balanced double IPA's, you simply must give this one a try.","Damian","May 07, 2010"
4.85,20.3,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"The malt is light colored and thus the nice, understated malt taste (despite the three varieties, per the label). The hops are strong and green from nose, all the way down. Alcohol is not anywhere to be tasted. This is just plain good.","schoolboy","May 06, 2010"
3.31,-17.9,4,3,3,3.5,4,"Overall, I expected this to go head to head with Torpedo. No contest, Torpedo is the better beer. I love Unearthly, I love Southern Tier IPA, but somehow 2X missed the mark. Not worth the extra cash.","shirfan","May 06, 2010"
4.22,4.7,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"A 12 ounce bottle picked up at the Beer Stop for around $2 - what a deal for a DIPA. Uncapped and poured into my standard shaker glass. 2X appears a clear golden yellow color with about a finger or so of off white foam. Nose and flavors consist of white grapefruit juice and peel, lemon, resinous pine needles, a bit of sticky weed, some alcohol heat, bread, grass, sweet malt. Medium to full bodied with adequate carbonation and a clean bitter finish. Really drinkable. I had to pace myself to finish this review. Pick it up if ya see it.","ClockworkOrange","May 05, 2010"
4,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4,"A solid DIPA that rings in under $10/sixer. Two of these would be all I could handle in a row, but a good beer nonetheless.","jera1350","May 05, 2010"
4.47,10.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The beer tastes really good. Not quite as abrasive and tasty as Pliny or other west coast treats, but then the east coast is about refinement. This is all about flavor, juicy resin and pine needles, tasty stuff. The bitterness in the aftertaste is moderated nicely by the sweet malts, no off flavors at all. Moderate carbonation with a light-like body. Very good as always from Southern Tier.","TurdFurgison","May 04, 2010"
4.05,0.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Morey's Bottom Line: A nice addition to an already impressive line-up for ST. Not as malty and sweet as Gemini or Unearthly.","Morey","May 03, 2010"
4.62,14.6,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Feel/Drink: Nice crisp mouthfeel, drinkability is right on.","travduke","May 02, 2010"
4.2,4.2,4,4,4,4,5,"Southern Tier is calling it, "The best beer we've ever brewed". While I do like it, I'm not sure if I agree with that statement. Southern Tier brews some really fine stuff and while this one is exceptional, I don't think it surpasses the Gemini or Imperial Hop. I would love to try this one on tap since the bottles tend to kill some of the nuances. (not always, but often)","jzeilinger","May 01, 2010"
4.47,10.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Medium body, adequate carbonation. Alcohol is masked very well as this drinks way too easy. Very well made.","Bierguy5","May 01, 2010"
4.52,12.2,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"This is obviously a hop driven beer and I love the finish. It doesn't drink like a 9% beer at all. Another delicious beer from Southern tier.","stewart124","Apr 30, 2010"
3.51,-12.9,3.5,2.5,4,4,3.5,"D: Citrus and grapefruit flavors that I normally expect in a big IPA were mellowed out somewhat providing a somewhat unique hop profile. Still overall an enjoyable beer -- would pair nicely with a chicken or seafood entree.","chaz01","Beers"
3,-25.6,3,3,3,3,3,"Then there is the price, At $12.80 a six pack (tax included) , I can think of many other offerings worth forking over that kind of dough. Strangely, 2XIPA caused an allergic reaction I did not know I had. It caused me to sneeze without any control.","thebeerdoctor","0"
