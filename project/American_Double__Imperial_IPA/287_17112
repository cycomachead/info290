I didn't expect much malt to come through in this beer.  The beer came through with a good hoppiness in the beginning with a strong maltiness at the end.  After you swallow there the happiness returns, only in the aftertaste.  It is def a pretty beer with the alcohol hidden well in the flavors.  I am happy I stumbled upon this in the store but I would not go out of my way to hunt it down.

The taste is spectacular. Bursting with hops and fresh citrus, some grapefruit notes. The addition of honey is more like an after-thought, but lends a nice balanced sweetness.  As it warms on the palate the alcohol comes through and leaves a pleasant mouthfeel. Its slightly carbonated and dry. Overall, it's a wonderful DIPA.

Drinks incredibly balanced and smooth and there is just of malty honey sweetness to balance out the bold hop profile but not get sticky sweet or syrupy.

Last year I held this in very regard, challenging the best of the best. Made it a point to secure a case this time. I've never had it's like. Call it a double ipa or whatever, the sweetness of honey makes this beer shine. February is a great time for those of us who look for non-winter-warmers, and hopslam is just that. Can't wait til july to have one outside. A question I always ask to beer folks is...'if you were on death row, and got to pick your last meal and the beer to go along with it, what would that beer be?' KBS, heady, etc. are the typical responses. Give me Hopslam. It is my #1.","Marko84","Mar 02, 2015"

Taste is sweet citrus and honey up front with a bitter hoppy backbone and boozey finish. Mouth feel is sticky sweet syrup. I really enjoy the sweet, malty fruit character of this one, but I lose that a bit on the finish. As it warms the carbonation fades and the malt starts to overpower the hops. Getting more candied sugar and warm booziness. Its lacking a little in hop bitterness, but a really nice sweet IPA.","danh53","Mar 01, 2015"

Mouthfeel is its strongest quality. Dense and oily. Feels big. Taste is a bit of a puzzle for me. Not typical for a DIPA. Piney hops on the opening but a great deal on honeyed sweetness on the end. I really like it but feel like it gravitates toward an American style barleywine, which isn't a criticism. Overall, I can see why this gets so much hype, it's a great beer, but perhaps not as mindblowing as you would be led to expect.","Qbdoo","Feb 27, 2015"

A vivid kiwi prickling gets added to the taste, as well as more lime and sunny, louche grapefruit. Honey is certainly noteable, while the alcohol is not detectable at all, and it provides the fruity hops with a ripe, sappy note, as it leads the malt flavor closer to the hops by adding a striking biscuity quality to them. The beer doesn't turn sweet though, it is still centered around the hoppiness, which is yet evolving on the palate. A distinct, slick bitterness arises from the fruitiness, leading to a slightly dry, long lasting finish, continously using the hops as center of attraction, exhibiting a slightly piney note, blending smooth into the sapful fruits. The carbonation still adds a slightly refreshing impression, while the beer is heavier bodied, without loosing its typical IPA drinkability, ending with a unique honeyed, hoppy finish.","aleigator","Feb 25, 2015"

Yes its a solid dipa they hide the alchohol but there is something missing maybe it lacks a floral nose and a nice citrusy flavor but in my opinion i have had no name dipas better than this beer. For example the beer is just bitter nothing else not alot of malt to balance i think pliney the elder and heady put this beer to shame.","Mbager1114","Feb 19, 2015"

At first, I was a little skeptical when the label indicated that the beer was brewed with honey, which is not typical for an IPA. After only a few swigs it became quite clear that the sweetness was what distinguished Hopslam from its predecessors and made me thoroughly appreciate this brew. I want to thank the folks at Green’s Beverages who provided me with daily updates from their Twitter page.","TheCraftBrewReview","Feb 19, 2015"

Upfront you get mostly the sweet honey and candy flavor, even some burnt sugar leading into the fuller hop profile at the end.  One of the easiest to drink double IPAs.","ajm5108","Feb 18, 2015"

The beer poured a very nice, brilliant copper hue with slight haze.  Smell is a nice blend of citrus with no hint of the alcohol bite; slight hop presence.  Mouthfeel is wonderful, full impression.  The taste is an interesting transition from citrus, to malty, honey, then to Vidalia onion, and finally to lingering blend of honey and hop bitterness.  I think this might be the fullest spectrum of flavors across one beer that I have encountered to date.  You certainly don't sense the 10% that will hit you full steam about 3/4 of the way through the glass.  I love me some DFH 120 minute IPA, but for the price, I think this is the winner.","Mike-Dean","Feb 18, 2015"

Could smell it from the table. Bright astringent pine, grapefruit, solid nose, but not overpowering. Hint of honey and booziness after awhile. Sweet on the front of the tongue, followed by solid pine in the middle and a classic, big bitterness towards the end... mellowing into a nice honey sweetness. Grapefruit/citrus came out a bit more for me as the glass warmed up. Solid mouthfeel, refreshing but not run of the mill... I expect that the honey added some of this aspect. Totally worth the hype. Our great local bottle shop held us a few. Well worth a trip, and a try. Exceeded expectations.","Mikus","Feb 14, 2015"

Like a DFH90 w/o the malt. Booze definitely present in nose and taste as it warms. Piney but sticky sweet; wouldn't go so far as to call it resinous like a Rip Current signature, though. Glad I finally got to try... Not quite the IPA the 100 rating led me to expect, but an awesome, fun (dangerous, shareable) beer that isn't anywhere close to what "HypeSlam" claims had me worried it could be.

The taste is very bitter then it dissipates quickly, leaving you with a fruity (grapefruit-esque?) flavor that dies down into a biscuity sort of taste. The back end is a nice warming sensation of alcohol, but not strong. Subtle, to the point where it's most enjoyable.

Overall i  really enjoyed it; however I did find it to be slightly cloying. I wasn't expecting such a heavy malt presence in an IPA. My local distributors get very little and limit sales to one bottle per customer. This is the first year I was able to get my hands on it and scored two bottles from two different stores for $10. It's tasty but not worth the hype there are plenty of other shelf DIPAs that I enjoyed more.","AngryPenguinBrewCo","Feb 10, 2015"

At first, yes it is good, a lot of bitterness up front, sweet from the honey and the malt. As it warms (and I would advise to drink this from the start at room temperature. Don't even chill it slightly) so much pops! The fruit is pineapple and it appears at the back end of the taste like right before the beer goes down my throat. And then it stays and says what's up! Then from there, yes GENIUS. It's like I'm listening to a symphony and hearing for the first time all of the intricate parts and timbres. Same with this beer. It's like an intellectual beer. I'm constantly thinking about what I'm tasting and what flavor combinations are there. Highly recommend for those that appreciate the more subtle things in a German beer. This might be the Double IPA for you. Worth the hype.","Detlef90","Feb 05, 2015"

Taste is bitter red grapefruit with a touch of honey adding some floral character and a sweet but unobtrusive malt bill.  Resinous and light pine in the finish.  Nicely carbonated gives a pleasant prickle and helps the bitter edge and finishes semi dry. This was great but far from the best DIPA I've had and not quite up to the big hype surrounding it.","HopBomb515","Jan 30, 2015"

Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mango, apricot, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, honey, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; with good strength. Some light booziness shows up as it warms. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mango, apricot, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, honey, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mango, apricot, lemon/orange zest, pine, honey, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and robustness of big citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, fairly crisp/sticky, and lightly creamy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding double IPA style. All around awesome complexity and balance of big citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 23, 2015"

The honey adds a dimension to it that others do not have, for me I find it takes away slightly from the hops but it still works, it just might not be everyone's cup of tea. Another thing I have found is that this beer is really best within the first couple of week from bottling. I find the alcohol can become more present at about a month, it's the same problem I have with Oracle as well.

It's extremely bitter and piney; if you love ipa's like I do, this isn't a bad thing. I've had far too many ipa and double and triple ipa beers that are way too sweet like southern tier.

Beautiful and rich in it's golden color with an aroma hand crafted in hop heaven. The honey in this beer is what makes it so memorable. Very well balanced in it's citrus notes and definitely not as strong as it's percentage hints that it should be. Not such a popular beer in the south, but when it is around it never lasts long. Another score for Bells Brewery!","Tuckeer","Sep 12, 2014"

The flavor of this is very well balanced. Grapefruit, caramel, hops. The honey makes a nice touch of sweetness.This is a very good beer. Only complaint is it is just a touch too sweet. I would like a little more of the fruit to come through and a little less sweetness, then I’d give it a 5.","kkleu357","Sep 09, 2014"

Bell's seems to be one of the most overrated breweries around and this beer is no exception. A pretty average DIPA with an unnecessary sweetness from the honey.","MisSigsFan","Sep 03, 2014"

4.43,-1.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.75,"Final Word: One of the best balanced IPAs I’ve had, especially considering that it is a Double IPA! Bell’s says that this brew has the most complex hopping schedule of anything they produce, and it shows in the amazing variety of hop flavors and aromas experienced here. In most beers this high use of hops would translate to the final product being overwhelmingly bitter and dry, but Bell’s wisely balanced the profile with sweet, nutty malts, and honey. As I drank this beer I kept feeling that the honey’s texture and flavor was the glue that holds this beer together; it bridges the gap between the resiny hops and the nutty malts, while lending a grounding sweetness to the entire profile. The only complaint I had was that the higher ABV made itself known every once in a while by coming up in the flavor, but this still doesn’t taste like a 10% ABV beer. While folks new to craft beer might still find the hop character a little overwhelming, this is absolutely a brew that everyone should try if given the chance. This sets the bar very high for IPAs everywhere!","Louisville-Beer-Reviews","Jun 21, 2014"

I tend to like my IPA's more dry and crisp. I still have to say it's slightly overrated, mostly due to hype though. That's not Bells fault, so I won't knock it. I don't believe it should be flying off shelves at near $20 a 6'er. On that note. It's 'supply and demand' and I will seek out what I can. Hopslam is perhaps the smoothest IPA on the market~","BrewUSA","May 29, 2014"

I have to say it does live up to the hype and is on another level from other great DIPAs iv had. It's superbly balanced with bright fruit, pine, honey, and sweet malt characteristics. Making it even better, I found $3 bottles at my local mix n match bar and walked out with a cheaper six pack than most ($18). Compared to other beers iv had in the same style, its slightly better than Dirtwolf and Double Trouble IMO and on par with Sucks and Head Hunter, but not quite up there with my favorite DIPA right now, Enjoy By. Although an outstanding beer, I think the limited release hypes this beer up more than it should be","Bone53","May 22, 2014"

It is definitely good, perhaps even very good for the style, but I have had ales of this style that are better balanced, more readily available, less expensive, more approachable, and that present a better, more sophisticated integration of bold hop and succulent malt flavors. Then again, judging by the name, as well as the attitudes and preferences of the crowd drawn into Hopslam's oddly rabid and surprisingly steadily expanding cult following, this is a beer for the truly hop obsessed. As if my reviews do not make this clear, I am not one of those guys, at least not consistently. Still, I can appreciate Hopslam for what it is: a big, unbelievably aggressive DIPA for the legion of self-professed hopheads inhabiting the netherworld of American craft beer geekdom.","mrfrancis","May 11, 2014"

This is a great DIPA if you can get your hands on it. BUT IF YOU CAN'T, DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU ARE MISSING OUT. This beer (at least this years Hopslam) is not worth $20 for a 6pk. I lean towards the less sweet, more hoppy, piney, and citrusy IPAs (Victory Dirtwolf and Great Lakes Chillwave for example) and this 2014 Hopslam didn't quite make me fall in love with it. If I can get next years bottle I would be very happy, but if not, that's fine. There are thousands of more beers worth a $20 price tag more than Hopslam.","bradenh","May 09, 2014"

It was very mediocre in that department. I got 2 bottles through trades. 1 FRESH and 1 aged a year. The aged one was more pleasant to drink as a complex 10% beer. The FRESH one was just not worth what I heard they sell for upwards of $20 a six pack (or more). Too many better beers out there to waste that kind of money.","Da314man","Mar 24, 2014"

It pours a misty golden color, with a minimal head that quickly dwindles to a faint spiderweb. Smelling brings some hops, but again, a touch of sweet honey to smooth it out. Just the right amount of carbonation, and the mouthfeel is like a light syrup. It tastes magical, the Platonic ideal of a honey-brewed IPA, imperial or otherwise. But that sweet touch really distinguishes it, making it incomparable, to my mind, with some of the other great imperial pales I've had - Heady Topper, Abrasive, Dreadnaught, Arctic Panzer Wolf. Highly recommended, but drink it fresh to keep as much of the hop presence as you can - if you're out of market and thinking about trading for it in 2014, do it now.","schris","Mar 23, 2014"

To be fair, it was bottled in January and I got lucky, picking up a six pack that had hidden in the storage of Wegmans in early March. Probably not the freshest it could be. There are many good IPAs out there. Hopslam is no doubt one of them. However, there is a lot of hype around this beer. So much so that I feel Hypeslam is an appropriate name. I don't think it justifies the $20 price tag for a six-pack. Not when you can pick up many other IPAs of just as good quality for $11. Again, Hopslam is very good. But not for the price. Maybe if I got it on tap or closer to the source i'd feel different. Bell's Two-Hearted is almost as good, half the price and readily available.","Seanem44","Mar 23, 2014"

Others may blast you harder or remove all your enamel but this one stays wonderfully drinkable. I don't know why every craft drinker wouldn't want at least one sixer.","surfcaster","Mar 08, 2014"

Honey is very present, much more than I was expecting, and I don't particularly care for the sweetness it contributes. Wanted to really like this beer, but the honey and the hop profile were both disappointing. Very smooth for a 10% ABV beer, though.","Maurizio","Mar 08, 2014"

Bottle was dated 1/11, so probably by it's best by date. Stupid polar vortex delaying shipping. However this review seems to correspond with my remembrances from past times I've had it that it didn't blow me away, even the glass I had at the brewery, so I'm posting it.

5,11.6,5,5,5,5,5,"The color was almost orange in hue, with a slight head that dissipated quickly. The aroma was fantastic! I could tell by the smell that I was in for a treat, because it wasn't overpowering in the typical way that very hoppy beers are to me, but instead gave amazing floral and citrus notes. Mouthfeel was substantial compared to a regular IPA, and I liked the body and slight malty sweetness, which quickly gave way to the hops. Whatever combo they use was enough to convert me, because it was intense and complex without the harshness of most beers with that much hops. I'm guessing a lot of late additions and dry hops. You'd also never guess this was 10% ABV. I never order IPAs or DIPAs, but from now on, when I see this on tap, that's probably what I'll get.","aqualung23","Mar 04, 2014"

The pour was very impressive, all the way to the finial sips. Citrus hops were very apparent in this brew and made itself well known from the beginning. I would definitely recommend to a friend and will definitely have again. Hope to find it soon on tap. Cheers!","DMXLOX22","Mar 04, 2014"

The nose was not overpowering, it was very delicate, and the keg had been tapped 12 hours before. The mouth feel was really good, it is a beer that feels uniform.

One of the things I look out for in these big DIPAs is whether or not the line between booze and hops is blurred—the good ones make it hard to tell where one ends and the other begins, and this is one of them.

The addition of honey and a good amount of malt really balances the flavor, making it a very drinkable DIPA. Trying to make the case last into summer but I'm not sure it will be possible.

Picked up a couple of six packs as it came off the truck this morning, promptly put it in the fridge when I got home knowing I would be unable to let it sit. Tried it for the first time last year, and was blown away by it to the point that I was able to acquire 1 1/2 total cases from my local store, which proceeded to disappear over the following 5 or 6 weeks. THis year it had a reputation to live up to. Poured it into a Piraat glass immediately after retrieving it from the fridge, which in hind sight was a mistake. This needs to sit some and warm slightly prior to drinking, initially it was lacking in smell and taste, however it became clearly evident over the course of the first bottle that a slight warming does wonders in both areas. Poured a solid two fingers that quickly disappeared leaving a slight lacing on the sides of the glass which continued as the level was drained away. Again, very little was noticed in smell until it warmed slightly. One thing immediately noticeable was an acidic taste on the back sides of the tongue. This was rapidly followed as the beer warmed with the smell of grapefruit and pine tempered apparently by the honey, so it never developed the strong tastes typically associated with the type. Alcohol was never apparent in the quantity indicated, so as I remember from the previous year, it snuck up rather rapidly by the end of the first beer. Color was a nice golden orange, somewhat on the thin side versus heavy you would expect from a high ABV beer. I do think the 2013 version was slightly better, however that should be considered from the perspective the 2013 was a first time tasting, and therefore quite a high pedestal, and I have noticed a similar trend with other releases I have tasted. All in all, this is still one of my favorites. I am definitely looking forward to my other case I should have in another week or so.","Boomerdawg","Feb 18, 2014"

The aroma was good but it lacked that pungent citrus and pine that others have. Taste was good with sweet malt grain and hop bitterness. The booze showed thru a little much for my taste and I didn't get any citrus from the hop but more bitter resin. The bitter lingers a little long and over powers a bit. It just didn't have the body and was almost astringent. If you love a bitter leaning IPA it's your beer for sure and overall a top 10 IPA for me just not my favorite.","GrumpyBeer","Feb 17, 2014"

The smell is sweet with honey and there is some moderate citrus notes. The taste is sweet up front but really balances out with the hop bitterness. I get a good amount of the honey and then juicy grapefruit. The feel is smooth and there is minimal lingering bitterness for me. I also don't really notice any alcohol despite the ABV. Overall this is an excellent beer that does a great job balancing the hops and sweetness. I wish I had it on-tap or at least a fresher bottle, but this beer still does not disappoint.","mc4z","Feb 15, 2014"

Similar for the taste. Your usual DIPA culprits. The thing that makes this beer stand out it that it's very well smooth and balanced. I would have never pegged it for 10%. It's also not too bitter which I like. You get a nice blast of hops and a full mouthfeel. Very good beer.

I must say I felt stupid for paying so much for this beer but had to try due to the hype. Man am I glad I took the leap. This beer is quite possibly the most complete and tasty IPA I have ever had. Smell is floral with hints of the honey it's brewed with. Taste is complex with the usual mango and grapefruit hop flavor. Mouthfeel is great. Slight bitterness which I like but fades quickly leaving a great aftertaste that leaves the palate wanting more. I feel guilty drinking this beer as I feel like it is liquid gold. So glad this lived up the the hype and feel like I want to spend my life savings on more (kidding of course). Currently drinking and if this isn't heaven idk what is.

If I'm honest, though, in some ways I think Bell doesn't do this amped up double quite as well as they craft the more accessible and compelling Two Hearts. And, I had a repeat performance with a beer born 1/21/14 three weeks afterwards--its color was already less orange, and both nose and palate had turned funky with no elemental improvements in exchange.

At first it's tangerine, then a bit of grapefruit, some pine. but then the floral overcomes anything you can name and these hops become pure perfumed lightness. The malt is a breaddy scent with a bit of earthy honey. Orange blossoms. No alcohol on the nose. Taste is very sweet. The honey is thick or so it seems and the malt is rich. It has a fruitiness form the tangerine and grapefruit but it's very dry and so it's earthier rather than juicier. The malt becomes like a soft sugar cookie on the nose and on the palate. It's almost chewy. There is a faint herbal that becomes stronger as you drink. I was waiting for a biting, bitter, tongue bruising like the label said but I found the bitter to be a bit more than moderate. As I am finishing the glass the juiciness is coming forward more and the scent is becoming a bit more tropical. The alcohol is only a hint on the very back end of the swallow and in the warmth as it finishes. Mouthfeel is creamy, sticky and full-ish. The aftertaste fades and all that remains is the bitter, the pine and the hop floral sweetness.","utopiajane","Feb 08, 2014"

4.69,4.7,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed, copper-gold coloring with a slow flow of carbonation and a frothy, low profile, bright white head that clings all over the glass, and slowly settles into a filmy surface coating as you drink. Aromas of deep, rich, bitter, resinous hops all over the nose, with a subtle sweet caramel backbone, and a blend of tropical fruits that include pineapple, mango, and grapefruit. Very balanced and very rich nose. Flavors are tropical fruit forward, rich and sweet, with a blast of citrus tart and bitter to follow. That's a lot of fruit on the palate all at once, but it is perfectly balanced by the pungent, dank, piney and grassy backbone, rich in resinous characteristics. This goes from fruity to forest green in a flash. Wow. All through this, there is a subtle sweetness of caramel darting in and out. Great tasting brew. The aftertaste has some pepper spicing and stronger floral notes, but it's still all hops. Smooth and robust in mouth, leading to a smooth, clean, slightly drying finish. This is amazing.","GarthDanielson","Feb 07, 2014"

But seven years have passed and while Hopslam is still a standard bearer for the category many have joined the ranks. It's a great DIPA but in my opinion no longer the Holy Grail and just last week I paid $22.00 for a six pack which I suppose isn't crazy given the going rate of so many over-priced bombers? Again, still very, very good but no longer "I'll search for it for weeks." I'm in the Chicagoland area and for me, that DIPA is now Three Floyd's Permanent Funeral!!!

Lots of minuscule bubbles and excellent sticky lacing throughout the experience. On the nose, the initial scent is a lovely pink grapefruit with floral hints, followed by sweet papaya (must be the honey). On the palate, the flavor profile replicates yet intensifies the olfactory sensations. Nice full mouthfeel -- not chewy per se, but ample and all-encompassing. Virtually no alcohol burn. The finish is long and sweet, yet balanced -- meaning that there is enough malt and alcohol present to extend the finish, without any of the elements (the sweetness from the honey, the pine from the hops, the malt, or the burn of alcohol) overpowering or dominating the experience. Just a long, steady, well integrated finish all the way through. Hard to believe that anyone could actually plan for this to happen -- seems more like a coincidental miracle of divine artwork than anything designed by human hands. All in all, a tremendous experience. This beer is truly unique. I've certainly never had anything else quite like it.","JohnParadee","Feb 06, 2014"

I also do tend to steer clear of most beers marked DIPA to avoid that slick caramelly flavor that I don't really like. Still, this is a style with some pretty stiff competition, and there are many year-round IPAs that I would choose any day over this one.

Poured a hazy golden color typical of American IPAs. Smell was terrific with the hops overtaking everything else which is expected. Front end was fantastic with the abundance of hops and bitterness. Thought the back end was a little too sweet for me but guess that is where the honey comes in. It was great to finally try this beer since I have heard about it for quite some time. I expected a lot more from this beer and that was probably due to the hassle getting ahold of it and the hype surrounding Hopslam. Overall it was a great IPA, one that I could drink regularly. It wasn't the best IPA I have tried but it was certainly one that I would order. Not sure if the $18.99 per six pack and the hassle acquiring the beer were worth it in the end.","Hopalong51","Jan 28, 2014"

In my experience, the honey impartment blurred the hop intensity. Mouthfeel is spot on and the 10% is hardly noticeable. Kudos for this. That a brewer can generate this type of excitement: double kudos. For me the beer not only doesnt live up to the hype, i can probaly find two or three readily available brews at a more approachable price that deliver more. But i can also see how this appeals to many afficianados due to its subtleties and present hoppiness. Could probably be a great introductory example for those who want a big sweetish Iipa on occasion.

I'll certainly make a point to see this out on a yearly basis, and I might sit on one bottle just out of curiosity to how well it holds up over time. I think it may have jumped to the front of the line for me in terms of offerings from Bell's. Just an outstanding DIPA from the Midwest that certainly represents itself well compared to the heavy-hitters from the Northeast and Southwest.","LambicPentameter","Jan 27, 2014"

First impression taste-wise is an abundance of resinous hops, but it quickly becomes sweet (not overly so) as the honey flavors emerge in the backend. It's a flavor combination that works really well, but six-packs are pretty pricey and hard to find from what I understand so I don't think I'll be enjoying this one as much as I'd like to.","James773","Jan 25, 2014"

The bubbles linger for a few minutes before settling to confluent patches of large bubbles around the surface of the liquid. Scattered strands of lacing decorate the glass. The aroma is of grapefruit/orange citrus, honey, cane sugar, wet earth, a bit of lemongrass, and subtle white pepper. It tastes of various citruses - primarily grapefruit and lemon rind - alongside a predominant honey flavor. Cane sugar, grass, and some earthen/peppery hops round it out. Mouthfeel is lively, but slightly more viscous than many other DIPAs, perhaps due to the honey. It has a wet, resinous finish as the bitter hops linger; a bit of warming alcohol is noticeable right on the end.. Overall, the honey adds a unique dimension to this big beer that hides its alcohol very well. The honey isn't entirely to my liking, but it is a very well executed beer none-the-less.","eclipse54","Jan 23, 2014"

It's a lot like Two Hearted- an incredible, unique IPA that has different characteristics than their west coast cousins. This one is sweeter and thicker than West Coast DIPAs, which really tones down the hoppiness and makes it compliment the beer more than give it a shocking, abrasive edge. Expect something slightly different than you expect when you see DIPA and you'll be pleased with this brew. Expect something like Stone Enjoy By, and you're going to be disappointed when you aren't burping up hops every half hour for the next 3 hours.

An ample amount of pine and grapefruit. Super bitter and dry with little to no balance. But this is the intention of the ale. Balance is not a need, necessity, or a want from an ale like this. It is all about the hops and this one delivers. Super bitter, but fresh and florally. Not a hint of the high abv. It's not a balanced ipa but it is Every thing it is meant to be.

Aggressive pour yields a solid 1 inch head that lingers, and lingers... Slowly dissipates leaving excellent lacing sticky to the glass. The color? This is what this style should be, a hazy orange gold tint. Big up front hop kick in the nose with solid boozy smell behind. Exactly what I wanted. Taste? I can only imagine what this is like on tap if it's this delicious out of the bottle!! Very similar to Doom, without Doom's overpowering alcohol kick. Loads of piney bitter hops, held in check by the honey to balance them out. For a ten percenter, this is a very drinkable beer! The sweetness of the honey is the perfect balance to the hops. This beer takes the sting out of a cold bitter Michigan winter night. Damn good beer!","BreakfastStout","Jan 15, 2014"

From the moment you crack that top, the stickiest, sweetest, fruitiest, most tropicaliest hops bombard your senses. Here the hops truly overpower the grain, allowing it to fade into the back and form a true base. Although this isn’t barrel aged, we felt that there was significant inclusion of vanilla bean extract, much in the same sense that Founders’ Doom presented with. It adds a certain softness to the inherent bitter flavors held within. Speaking of bitters, which is a huge advertising point of this beer, we felt that that aspect of it was rather dimmed following our expectations. The hops were gloriously present and diverse, but just weren’t to that palate crinkling extreme that many DIPAs search for. This restraint went appreciated, and ultimately lent towards the final balance. This is a fantastic beer, and although we wouldn’t tag it in the same individualized company as Heady and the Hill Farmstead one-offs, it takes a high rank in the order of the regular fridge sippers.","TheBrewo","Jan 15, 2014"

A Double India Pale Ale style beer, with a overwhelming hop aroma, grapefruit and just a taste of honey. This beer is very sought after by everyone in the industry, so make certain to keep informed by your local distributor of it's arrival. (Most places will not make reservation for it, and will run out quickly.)","apr3940","Jul 28, 2013"

The malt may not shine here but it plays a great supporting role. Ive had this fresh and it was amazing. ive also had a bottle that was almost 6 months old and it was also amazing.

I think what sets it apart is the addition of honey, which creates a smoothness that rounds out the bitterness to a point where words cant describe how amazing this beer is. Good luck finding it, this sells fast everywhere, and its obvious why. The best DIPA i've ever had, no contest.","Roman5150","May 14, 2013"

Most in the style are merely IBU bombs, with an obnoxious palate wrecking bitterness and lack of any real flavor. This isn't. Reminds me of a domestic favorite of mine, Red Racer IPA, in that it has tons and tons of flavor but is still immensely drinkable. Absolutely delicious DIPA, and that's coming from a guy who doesn't really care for the style.","Converge","Apr 23, 2013"

I mean, its a great beer don't get me wrong, but it didn't stand out to me as something worthy of the absurd praise its received. the pour is a nice hazy honey color with a creamy white head with fine retention, beautiful. the nose is oily hops, high alpha semisweet fruity hops, with some pollen character from the honey and a subtle but complimentary yeast strain. the flavor is boldly hoppy, both bitter as hell and oily sticky danky. its a beer with plenty of motion, moving from a fruity sort of vibe to a really gnarly bitter bomb. the sweetness of the honey is hard to pick out, and the alcohol is shockingly well hidden. you would never know this was 10% abv until you drank 3 or 4 of them and it walloped you! great mouthfeel with groovy carbonation and a fuller medium body. there is a great resinous feel left after the swallow. overall an outstanding imperial ipa, one of the better ones ive had honestly, but it just didn't blow my mind the way it has for others.","StonedTrippin","Apr 07, 2013"

This doesn't have the tropical fruit qualities of Pliny or Heady; it is a direct jack hammer assault on your taste buds. That being said, it is absolutely excellent.

4.55,1.6,4.25,4.25,4.75,4.75,4.5,"O: If I had to sum this up I would say it is like the younger sibling to Heady. Perhaps people don't like comparisons, but, I would say their hop profiles are similar, with Hopslam being perhaps a bit more tropical and sweet, with slightly less hop feel at the end. Both are extremely balanced and smooth which to me is what really separates these top notch DIPA's. That being said, Hopslam is a very good beer, though not the Hopslam I was expecting. i really like the floral/sweet honey undertones to compliment the hops, a nice touch, otherwise what you get is probably one of the more easy drinking DIPA's out there. Not sure it is worth the hype as it wouldn't be at the top of my Hop list, but it certainly is worth trying and one day it'd be nice to try a more fresh batch.","4ster","Mar 25, 2013"

Sweet caramel and honey beneath it all. Faintly sour citric acid like taste on the back of the tongue. Sweetness balanced by bitterness very nicely. A little more detectable alcohol than expected but overall a very good beer. Honestly like cooked tropical fruits, and citric acid covered in a sweet glaze followed by bitter rind.","jtierney89","Mar 25, 2013"

Had it as part of a sampler with several other beers and what I love most about this beer is that although you get a strong sense of hoppiness, the honey quickly dissipates any of the lingering bitterness that is usually left by such IPA's. A must have if you are ever at the brewery, try to save as much as possible. Currently aging an '11 and a '12 together. Looking forward to when I can try them next year!","TripelBlove","Feb 27, 2013"

Strong pine notes in this edition with some floral background, perhaps a tiny hint if citrus. Medium/heavy mouthfeel, syrupy pine hops hit the pallate hard upfront with a slight malt backbone. Bitterness comes in late and lingers a bit. Overall it lacks the citrus notes and balance of the 2012 vintage. Good, but in my opinion this year doesn't earn the high rating it has on the top 250.","ZDub","Feb 24, 2013"

5,11.6,5,5,5,5,5,"Poured a nice amber into a tulip glass, bubbles can be seen rising and a very slight off white head formed. The scent is of floral grassy hops, pine and grapefruit, with slight hints of honey and cat urine. The cat urine scent became more pronounced as the beer warmed but was almost pleasant in an odd way. The taste was excellent. Bitter pine begins each sip, going into more bitter pine mixed with grapefruit and ending on notes of bitter grapefruit pith. There is also a nice presence of malt, though it is overwhelmed somewhat by the hop profile, as well as nice hints of honey that are present throughout each sip. The mouthfeel is pleasant, with a slight carbonation, but not enough to dull the tongue to the hops or make drinking the beer difficult. There is also a slight stickiness but not as much as in some examples of the style. The mouthfeel aids the flavor of the beer and does not detract. Overall this is an excellent DIPA, by far one of the best, with an excellent hop flavor profile, well worthy of the title hop bomb. Yet it also is well balanced and avoids the pitfalls of being too hoppy. A beer to try and to enjoy.","Auraan","Feb 15, 2013"

4.89,9.2,4.75,5,5,4.5,4.75,"I am a fan of IPA's. This one is a DIPA which I have had a few but this one is really good. But from the beers I have had from Bell's this one is no exception. I love the 2 hearted ale and this one builds upon a similar paradigm, its just a bit more adventurous. When I drink Bells it makes me think of Hemingway and this one is no exception it should be like For Whom the Bell Tolls really, when you open it it smells of a pine forest, much like the novel. But it goes into a tropical citrus character. I was getting pine, but also grapefruit and pineapple from the aroma. The color was a nice golden ale typical of the color scheme for this style. The taste was much like the smell a good bit floral from the hops, but not bitter really. I know the label says that it is strong, but I felt it was really well balanced considering the amount of hops and IBU's in a DIPA. This is a great cooler weather beer, perfect for spring or fall, although it will not last that long. It was pricey but was worth it and just be careful the 10% will get you. Enjoy this one if you can find it!","humuloner22","Feb 14, 2013"

The taste transfers from orange to bitter grapefruit, but then the bitterness just about disappears to reveal malt with a nectar like sweetness. The finish comes back with a bitterness stronger than the introduction. The mouthfeel is excellent. Thick and rich with a delicate kiss of carbonation.","silverking","Feb 08, 2013"

I tasted it side-by-side with Lagunitas Sucks DIPA, which is clearly the superior beer in 2013. For the exorbitant price and hype, Hopslam will probably be my biggest disappointment in 2013.

What sets this beer apart is the delicate interplay between flavors the expert blending of hops, malt, and honey for an experience unlike any other. I love the addition of adjunct sugars to produce a caramel sweetness that balances the big bitter of IPAs.

However, I do not rate it as highly as many on this site, and certainly do not think it is the best DIPA I have ever had, nor is it worth the price or an extended road trip to get it. While it is an excellent beer, I likely won't buy it again just because of the exorbitant markup and search process. Check it out, but this is certainly a case of too much hype, too much buildup, and unfortunately the brew could not possibly stand to compete.","TheCondor","Jan 31, 2013"

Pours a cloudy orange with plenty of carbonation evident and a two-finger head that gradually gives way to a foamy coating. Lacing is perfect evidence of each sip. Nose is overwhelming citrus (especially orange, grapefruit and lemon), but hints of honey are there as promised. Taste: The one disagreement I would have with Stone is that his is NOT a "biting, bitter, tongue buster," although elements of each descriptor are there. I find it actually much better balanced than that, the honey backbone probably doing the most to sorta' tame these very wonderful hops. Taste is at first dominated by the citrus but this is so beautifully balanced by the honey and caramel. Mouthfeel is medium, and aftertaste is a sweet bitterness that is not overly cloying. Certainly, there is enough bitterness and dryness to satisfy DIPA fans but this is a VERY refreshing and crisp end to a very special beer. Come on, can't SOMEONE do this ALL YEAR?

Looks perfect, tastes perfect (the exact amount of honey sweetness to balance the hop bitterness), smells perfect. No bitter aftertaste and the 10% ABV is fast becoming the sweet spot for high alcohol ipa's that don't go too far overboard (I'm looking at you 120). Like April Fool's Day, July 4th Fireworks and hanging out with the guys on Labor Day for our fantasy football draft it is something I look forward to every year that rarely disappoints.","philerman","Jan 29, 2013"

Smell takes it away, lots and lots of citrus and piney hops, the smell just permeates the room from the time it is poured. Tastes of citrus and piney hops, and nice malt, but the honey taste helps to tie it all together and make it smooth. Beer has a bit of a fizzy feel, but for a beer with 10% ABV, goes down really smooth and is quite sessionable (and dangerous because of the high ABV).

The beer was a very nice, clear dark copper that produced a very nice white head that was well retained and faded into a thin cap that lasted throughout the beer. The aroma is very nice...actually more balanced than I remember, but still more hoppy, citrus and pine, but a very full and powerful aroma. The taste is what every DIPA/Imperial IPA should strive to be. Most are so overpowering hoppy that I sometimes regret getting them...but not this one, again, like the nose, pretty well balanced, but with an edge to the hops, but with more citrus up front and pine in the back and the malts just making it as smooth as it could be. The feel of the beer was also very good. The beer was clean, crisp, refreshing and very fresh. The alcohol was not noticeable at all and I probably would have had a few if not for the price. Overall, a world-class beer. Nothing more needs to be said.","PhillyStyle","Jan 29, 2013"

The aroma is enough to make me salivate! Contained within each whiff are the essences of clementines, zesty lemons, juicy red grapefruit, pungent resinous oils, wild honey and sap. Scents of boardwalk shop sweets and flower garden bouquets enter my imagination. The hop's bitterness and floral aspects court my tastebuds equally, then a second later, a super-sweet tingle of honey and pollen appears on the tip of my tongue, as if it were a finale. The brew gracefully coats the inside of the mouth, and it's warming on the way down. Very smooth and velvety... Despite the high ABV and dry finish, it is the antithesis of harsh, for sure. A mimicry of other popular DIPAs, this is certainly not. To say that each sip leaves me wanting more is an understatement... rather, I find myself unable to believe this otherworldly elixir is really in my grasp! I'd imagine this is what the great god Pan drank in the unspoiled wilderness of Arcadia!","Neorebel","Jan 28, 2013"

First impression on tasting was the hops, of course. The citrus and carmel sweet came after, but the hops didn't let go. I was impressed by the 20 proof factor, but wondering about how much taste that would hide. Actually, the crafting of this brew made the alc content undetectable. Yep, this one will sneak up on you. I compare this with other IPA brews that have the same flavor but with half of the kick. The head seems to go kinda quick, but with a flavor like this one, I'm good with that.

Light citrus scents hit your nose then your palate prior to a light bitterness. Almost a sweet bitterness. You really get the carbonation and fresh hop flavor in the mouthfeel. You get a slight smell of the alcohol but it certainly doesn't taste if 10%. Be careful. It is just that good.","PHBoiler","Jan 17, 2013"

Honey and citrus blossoms present on the nose. Opens with smooth honey notes, some light caramel, flora and hay, citrus and even a hint of apple and pear-like fruitness. More honey notes head off and smooth out some mounting citrus rind bitterness. Smooth, slightly chewy due to a hefty malt backbone and honey-like syrupy accents. Moderate carbonation. Such a unique, exceptionally great beer that I'm glad to finally fully review.","chanokokoro","Jan 17, 2013"

4.72,5.4,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.5,5,"Overall, Hopslam is amazing. Having enjoyed both formats, draft and bottle, I am grateful for the experience. Over the last year, it has made me chase "honey beers" only to be disappointed. Bell's did a great job, and I feel like this year is better than last. Please find the chance to sample this excellent brew. It is definitely different, draft v. bottle, and I think it's hitting its stride right now, 9-10 days in. Glad I have a chance to drink 1/day for the next 2.5 weeks, and hopefully I can grab some more to see how it changes after several weeks. Again, must try. Cheers.","rodlavers","Jan 11, 2013"

This is a top notch DIPA, sure, but not perhaps in the class of the other heavy hitters of the genre; lacks the intricacy of Heady Topper and the refinement of Pliny, to cite two examples. But still dusts the vast majority of the competition.","tobelerone","Jan 11, 2013"

It poured a amber color, produced a nice foamy cream colored head, nice retention and off the charts lacing left on the glass. This ale featured an aroma of floral/citric hops, clover honey and malted grain. Medium in body, this IIPA starts off a bit thin/light, and then packs a punch! Sweet malted grain, honey, and an explosion of citric hops. Hop filled finish, strong taste of alcohol. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel- One of the most drinkable IIPA's i have ever had. You could actually have a few of these in one session. Shot out to my boy the St. Charles Whisker Biscuit for bringing me a bottle of this beautiful libation.. I have been Hopslammed!

Aromas of wet hops, some tropical fruit, grapefruit, orange peel, white sugar. Taste is beautifully smooth and not too heavy with lots of grapefruit, citrus hops, orange blossom honey, and some butter. Rich and slightly oily on the palate but finishes clean with a quick spicy and acidic bite akin to ginger. Very easy to enjoy. Overall very well balanced for the amount of hops dumped into the vats. 10% abv is masterfully hidden. Awesome. 1/27/2009 9/4/9/4/16=4.2","tarheels86","Sep 06, 2012"

4.89,9.2,4,5,5,4.5,5,"Taste is bam!! Up-front assault of hops and then the honey smooths it out just as I sense the booze. I'm realizing this is about the best DIPA I've ever had at or above 10% abv. I admit I didn't expect the honey to play as big a role in the flavor as it does. I'm going to sip this one slow and savor it. It feels quite thick, as though it should due to that honey aspect of the brew. Sticky as it begins to warm. Although in the end I prefer more piney/ pineapple/ citrus flavored DIPAs over this, Bell's did as good a job as I can imagine anyone can do with regards to marrying honey to beer and having it all balance out with the big hop flavors like this. For me, the honey gave me the impression of an elixir, but in a very good way. My wife, who hates beer, was on hand and I had her sip this. I asked if she tasted the honey. "No" she said..."but I smelled it". Then I asked "well, what does it taste like?" ..she said "beer... bitter", as she made her usual unpleasant face as she always does after reluctantly trying beer. I then took a couple more sips as it's even warmer now, and there's orange citrus in there too. Syrupy. For a big imperial IPA, sweet. But for what I understand this retails for, this is very good bang for your buck. ","TBoneJones","Aug 09, 2012"

The scent is wonderful, well balanced citrus, hops, and honey. The taste is, oh my, incredible. This is definitely one of my top beers, for sure. It hits hard, but is perfectly balanced in such a way as to not reveal much alcohol taste at all. Honey, hops, and citrus dominate the taste in a wonderful array on the tongue that is neither too biting nor too quick to leave, it unfolds on the palate revealing the complexity of the hops. If you can find this, don't hesitate to pick some up.","srv33","Jun 29, 2012"

The DIPA has a nice sweet taste that is well balanced between the hops and the honey. It's very hard to tell that this beer is 10%, it is hidden very well. I still prefer beers like Heady Topper, HF IPAs, etc. a little bit better, but this DIPA was great non-the-less. The bottles I had were a bit past there prime so the hops faded a little bit, but they were still very good.","jaasen64","Jun 09, 2012"
4.6,2.7,4,4,5,4,5,"O: An outstanding robust IPA. Great hops bite and bitterness with just enough malt sweetness to take the harsh edge off the bitterness. The honey sweetness also fits well and adds a unique flavor. The alcohal heat at just the right level to compliment the citrus and floral hops and bitterness. This is one of the best IPA's around.","Beer_Runner","Jun 08, 2012"

Fairly bitter but expected and I really think they nailed the malts on this one to give it a complexity you don't get much with some DIPAs, mouthfeel is a little less drinkable as it's got a good amount of body to this beer.

From the time I opened the bottle until I was finished I could smell the beautiful hop aroma. Good lacing through the glass. The taste starts with a small dose of sweetness, but that moves out of the way for the hops to come through in a hurry. I got a lot of citrus hops in this one. It was smooth to drink and went down easy. I will be looking for a fresher bottle of this next year to get a more accurate rating, but still a great beer.","Rau71","May 11, 2012"

This is a bit of a stretch. Don't get me wrong, this is a BIG hoppy beer but the amount of residual malt & honey sweetness definitely detracts from the huge complex bitter hop profile. At 10%, this beer goes down with some ease, it would be real easy to get carried away with a few of these. Big up Bell's for creating this masterpiece!","Veristic","May 10, 2012"

That was after calling at least 100 places to see if it was in stock. I first tried it when I bought 2 bottles of it on Ebay for $30+$10 shipping. Crazy. Great beer tho! Def one of my favs!

3.13,-30.1,4,3.5,2.5,4.5,3,"Pours a copper color with a rather creamy looking white head, carbonation is evident. Very slightly opaque as far as clarity goes. Head is retained until the end. Smells almost as hoppy as the name implies; more earthy and spicy notes than floral. Malt aroma is almost undetectable, but overall a rather appealing smell. Flavor is very hop forward as expected, almost too overwhelming on the tongue to pick apart. Finish starts with pronounced bitterness, followed by a not unflattering pine resin(y) taste accompanied by an almost barlywine-like malt flavor with a bit of alcohol in the nose. Lacks balance in my opinion. For a beer that looked rather over carbonated after pouring, I have to say the mouth feel was great. Good viscosity, and definitely not over-carbonated. I realize with a name like hop slam, that some intense hoppyness should be expected. But more goes into a great beer than a ridiculous amount of hops. I've had quite a few IPA's that did a much better job of showcasing the hops used. Anyway, hop slam is alright, nothing great though.","TCbrewz","Apr 15, 2012"

Pours a beautiful orange/gold color with a bit of a haze and a nice fluffy head. Smells wonderful if you're a hop-head. The taste of this stuff really puts it on top of my list of favorites. Taste is super hoppy and citrusy and then the honey sweetness settles into the after-taste. But, remarkably smooth for a big beer. Mouthfeel has a nice cling and coat type feel on the inside of the mouth so the flavor lingers. Easily my favorite DIPA/Imperial IPA and quite possibly my favorite beer.","Yoopermk","Apr 01, 2012"

The initial sip starts out slightly bitter and gradually builds up and finishes quite dry and bitter. This is perhaps the smoothest most drinkable IIPA I have ever had.

Resinous, chewy (did I really just say that?), bitter but not too bitter, malty but not too malty- Bells got it right once again. The biggest selling point here is not that the flavor is exceptional but, rather, that such a big beer can be so easy to drink.

FYI, I wouldn't normally give something I suspect to be "damaged goods" a review, but I really don't have any other means by which to review this beer. This is more for my notes so i can go back and try it fresh in Chicago one day to compare. Gotta say though, even with the plastic phenol taken away, it's pretty syrupy. After the DIPA fest, I can say I've had several beers that lack this characteristic that still fit the TIPA style.

4.2,-6.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a golden honey with a subtle haze that clears with some warmth. Finger of white head comes with a vigorous pour. Decent, spotty lacing. Typical west coast IIPA on the nose - big on the citrus and mango, backed up with some pine and subtle malt support, more boozy than some. Leans more towards fruit on the tongue with less herbal/pine hop presence. Fades off into some soft booze notes, and a tiny sting on the back of the palate at the very end. Mouthfeel is as expected - medium everything. Appropriate for the style. Overall it’s a good double IPA. I wouldn’t say it’s worth the hype and the price but it’s good. EDIT: Just got a sixer with a 2/10 bottle date - a month fresher than the batch I reviewed initially. Much more interesting. The honey is a bit sweeter and better incorporated. I’ll adjust my numbers somewhat, but not too much because I don’t feel that any beer should suffer that much from 4 extra weeks in the bottle. I’d probably seek this out year after year if I was guaranteed the fresh stuff.","yamar68","Mar 01, 2012"

A nice, smooth, malty, grapefruit and pine on the front of the tongue, with a simultaneous pleasing floral scrubbing on the back.

Hopslam didn't disappoint and should be considered world class in the DIPA category. It has the hops and alcohol that "slam" the palate, yet a soft sweetness that mellows the flavors out.

4.71,5.1,5,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,"On tap at Sava’s in Ann Arbor. Served in pint glass. Aroma has traces of both the sweet honey and the in-your-face pine citrus hops. Elements of grapefruit and a hint of cat pee (citra?). Clear amber color, with a small head. Looks like candy. Beautiful golden orange pour and perfectly clear. Big head and punches you with the aroma as it pours (have also had bottled). Taste follows the aroma perfectly. Grapefruit, pine, zesty citrus, and some sweet honey. Nice bitterness up front with a punch of hops going down as well. Lingering honey citrus pine on the palate. Very drinkable, despite the 10% alcohol. Light to medium body with medium carbonation. A must try for anyone who fancies themselves a hop head. I look for this one every winter. Wish it were year round. Out of the bottle this is excellent, but on draft this thing hits a whole new level. I find a bit more of the mellow honey sweetness on draft and more floral aromatics--but excellent both ways.","BMMillsy","Feb 15, 2012"

Smell is absolutely jam packed with citrus hops, complemented by a floral aroma. The taste comes through with an absolute blast of hop flavor. Citrus and floral hops all over the place with a nice bit of pine coming through as well. The malts and honey come together to form a softly sweet backdrop for the hops to shine. It also lends to a silky, smooth mouthfeel with lighter carbonation. The tropical hop aspects linger longer than the bitterness with a sweet hop finish. I usually like my DIPAs dry as possible, but this beer, as far as I've found, is one of a kind in the way the soft sweet malt flavors blend seamlessly into the intense tropical, citrus hop flavors.","charliedvrs","Feb 12, 2012"

Despite the sweetness it is not boozy, managing not too stray too far into the 'kitchen sink' trap that other extreme DIPAs often find themselves in. It is dissimilar to Russian River Pliny the Elder; try comparing it to Port Hop 15, Avery Maharaja, Oskar Blues Gubna, or even Alpine Exponential Hoppiness instead. In defense of this beer, it manages to exceed all but the latter.","beagle75","Feb 11, 2012"

Maybe it was time and place, a food pairing, a moment in time. I do know that at times I had been enamored with HopSlam and others, I've been, shall we say, underwhelmed. Right now, it's a pretty solid DIPA, but doesn't stand as a favorite in the style.","BarrytheBear","Feb 05, 2012"

Big pine and grapefruit in the nose along with peach, pineapple, mango, and guava...a nice tropical fruitiness. You even catch the slightest bit of caramel. For me, pine was the most prominent taste. It had a strong presence in the front and was the taste that lingered longest. In between there's a nice helping of citrus,pineapple and more malt presence than I was expecting. I typically like a DIPA with a more resiny feel, but I really enjoyed the crisp and clean feel this had. The drinkability is almost stupid. I'd never guess this to be anywhere close to a 10%ABV. The first time I had this I wasn't overly impressed, but after further review, this is a winner.","alkemy","Feb 03, 2012"

I do have to say that I am slightly dissapointed overall. While this is a super beer, it is by no means my favorite DIPA, mainly because of its potency and lingering bitterness despite the ample sweet honey flavors.

This is a well balanced beer in my opinion. The finish is sweet and slightly hot, but this is far from a booze bomb, in my opinion. It'll warm the back of your throat and stomach though, no doubt.

Somewhat clear in appearance, and nice amount of bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. The nose is amazing: pineapple, mango, orange, peach- very citrus oriented, and extremely well balanced. The taste even steps it up a notch. One drink and my palate screams for mercy.. thus the name 'Hopslam'. I get the citrus flavors, honey, slight malt in the background, and some other grassy/earthy hops. Amazingly, none of the 10% alcohol is evident at all. Just really well balanced and ultimately tasty. The mouthfeel is exquisite as well. It has the citrus/honey sweetness with some malt, and then the hops just wrecking your palate on the backside. Perfectly carbonated and executed. Overall, this is definitely one of my favorite seasonal beers- and favorite beers period. It's amazing, and I'm glad I still have five left in my fridge. Cheers!","jayhawk73","Jan 25, 2012"

Perhaps Bell's intention was to create the most well-balanced DIPA ever... which I believe they did. Either way, this beer is dangerously smooth and drinks way to easy for a brew with 10% ABV.

The smell is absolutely the best I've experienced to date - a cacophony of citrus scents that is intoxicating. This is where this beer really stands out. Even my wife, who hates the smell of any beer, said "That's the least-offensive smelling beer I've ever smelled", which is quite an endorsement for her. The taste is not quite as powerfully citrus as the scent would lead you to think, but grapefruity bitterness comes through big time. There is enough of a malty and honey sweetness to provide some semblance of balance. Very nice mouthfeel adds to the experience. Outstanding.","DeltaGolfSierra","Jan 20, 2012"

It tastes like a fresh mix of citrus juice that I could personally drink all day until I succumb to alcohol poisoning. And personally I was not a big fan of Bell's at all before I tried Hopslam. Already had it on draft and out of the bottle, and out of the bottle there is much more of a citrus taste, and I can not taste any alcohol in it at all. It has a gorgeous golden blonde color with a thin white head that disappears quickly. There is a ton of citrus smell to this, the smell of hops and citrus almost fill the room when you open this beer. It is simply delicious.","rogueleonardi","Jan 20, 2012"

The complexity is in the nose- there is a beautiful palette of orange fruit, citrus, and flowers that is quickly overpowered by the hop bitterness and citrus/booze acidity that moves up your nostrils about one second after the sip... this is a beast, a beautiful, golden beast of a beer. The fruit and honey come back in the lingering aftertaste- only to be shot to the back with every next sip of wild IBU and citrus power. This WILL be a perfect summer night beer- I'm setting some aside until then or 2013, hoping it will mellow out a bit. A trippy tropical hop voyage.","gustogasmic","Jan 19, 2012"

I could use a little bit less alcohol taste. Or maybe I just have fond memories of this beer when I had lesser taste buds? Whatever. Carbonation is well done. Overall a fantastic beer that I will get more of before the month is through and I'll look forward to spending nearly $20 on a six pack next year too.

Just a big overflow of hops, but in a good way. Awesome mouthfeel. Very full bodied and creamy. I've noticed it tends to be a bit boozier on tap than it is in the bottle, but it is still good both ways. Totally worth the price. Can't drink a whole bunch of it at one time due to how sweet it is, but 2 or 3 is all you need at a time anyway. Drink it as fresh as possble, and enjoy.","1Adam12","Jan 12, 2012"

I can't think of another beer that benefits this much from the addition of honey. Though the hops are explosive, the honey adds subtly and enough sweetness to bring out the best in all six hop varieties. Another beautifully crafted gem by Bell's.","dgugliuzza","Jan 11, 2012"

This year's batch is disappointing. You know how the citrus and pine fall off as Hopslam ages? Well this batch (on day 1) tastes like a typical June Hopslam. Its still a great beer, and I will continue to enjoy it while it's out but Im not feeling like I need to hoard it as in the past. No problem, more for everyone else!","oneaday","Jan 11, 2012"

4.83,7.8,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Pours amber orange gold with a mega foam white head. Leaves behind gobs of lacing. Nose is hops, citrus fruits, maybe some honey. Mouth is light to moderate, crisp and snappy. Not nearly as hoppy as expected. This isn't a hop bomb beer, but just a really great tasting hoppy beer. So maybe the name is a little misleading? Or maybe it just means it has hops in it and you will want to slam them down one after another? Regardless, good carbonation trending to the high side. Hops are more of a subtle bitterness that linger. Taste is floral hops, citrus fruits/lemon and some honey. Not nearly as much honey as I feared though. I normally don't like 'honey beers' but this is a huge exception thanks to the subtle usage. At 10% abv I can honestly say this is the most dangerous beer I know of. I could literally drink these one after another they are so smooth. Not a noticeable alcohol taste at all. But after a few, you can feel it and you know the bottle label was telling the truth. In the very small group that I consider perfect beers. My only real complaints are it is tough to get and wicked expensive.","mcslain","Oct 17, 2011"

The competitions behind the Tastee Freeze lacked the ambiance of a pure demonstrative environment for the masses, but the hum of the generator provided a mild lull for the public lacking dental insurance. A dim spotlight, spotlight loosely being referred to as a Belkin floodlight, shined furiously on the center of the canvas ring. A 9 year old girl swayed gently on the ropes awaiting the entrances. The smell of cut grass and grapefruit began to fill the baleful air, the mist of sticky herbal sweetness lingering within each patrons’ nose: Hopundertakehopper had arrived.

Smell- Tropical sweet hops, raw honey, citrus (orange, lemon zest), bready, with the big huge malt backbone sweetness. Yum. Taste- wow! huge hop explosion on my tongue, bitterness assault to my tongue and sides of my mouth, equally balanced by a super deep sweet honey based malt backbone. I get it.

The flavor starts light and sweet, but not for long! Shortly thereafter the hops move in, and not subtely either. This is a big beer with big flavor. I like to pair Hopslam with grilled venison chops topped with crumbled bleu cheese or BBQ ribs, as the big flavors compliment each other.

The pour resulted in a two finger head of medium thick slightly off white foam with moderate clinging lace. The color was a 6 on the SRM beer color chart and a bit hazy. The smell blew me away, not what I was expecting. Aromas of honey, flowers, citrus, a hint of toffee, and caramel. Taste is a wonderful shock. Sort of sweet to start with, flavors of honey, and caramel, then the hops come to bear with the grapefruit, lime, and pine. While I was focused on the flavor, the alcohol ambushed me like a mugger. Wow, I don't think I would drink a six of these, even though the taste would let me. I need more of this fine nectar.","beerprovedwright","Apr 22, 2011"

Nice bitterness from the hops but the honey and grapefruit flavor really turned me off. I don't know if it was too much sweetness for me or what. Mouthfeel was alright, light-medium. Overall I was pretty disappointed in this beer. After reading all the hype about it on this site, I was really excited to try it. I've had a few other IIPAs that I think are a lot better than this.

The sweetness, near cloying, leaves this brew far off balanced and while I enjoyed parts of it, the sweetness was hard to get passed. The aroma is really were this beer shined and I wish it had carried into the taste. I'm glad I got to try it but if I had to choose between Hopslam or Two Hearted, it's Two Heated I'm buying.","CrookedStill","Apr 15, 2011"

Nose is too sweet for my preference in DIPA's, but considering the abv %, I was expecting something in these lines. Floral, citrus like hops shine through a bit, fighting the sweet residual malt character for the lead. Taste is of a hyped up Two Hearted, nothing more, nothing less. This beer is Two Hearted on steroids, boost the centennial's, boost the pale and crystal, and you've got HopSlam. Overall I'm not too impressed by this beer at all. Bell's has a cult following, and I honestly think they could wizz in a batch, label it PissSlam, then stick a $14.99 price tag on a 6'er, and everyone would harp about how good it is. It just doesn't live up to everyone's hype, but seeing as Ive got 17 bottles left after it hit GA three months ago, I'll be cellaring plenty! Overall, grab one or two if you see it @ a reasonable price, but I wouldn't go too far to find it. I'd rather rock a Lagunitas Hop-Stoopid for $3.49 a bomber.

Not as nice looking as most DIPAs I prefer. I like a DIPA that has an orange hue rather than a reddish amber hue. Smell was too sweet for me, I am a hop head and like really hop-forward beers. The smell for me was too malty and not enough hops. Taste followed the aroma...way too sweet and malty for a good DIPA. The hops were not forward enough for me to enjoy this. It reminds me of an English style IPA more than a hop-forward DIPA. I guess I was expecting a better beer, but I get spoiled living in California, and expect the higher rated DIPAs to taste as good as the ones here do.

Although this is an extremely hoppy beer (Didn't you notice the name?), it's balanced out with the sweetness of honey to the point that non-hop lovers might even enjoy this. If you are someone who is accustomed to drinking pilsner, or any beer with the word "lite" in it and rarely stray into the world of craft beer, this is probably not for you.

The Flavor is nothing shy of exceptional, as it first hits the tongue with a citrusy delight, and lingers for a while and finishes off with a floral quality that blends nicely with the subtle sweetness that the Honey in this master piece adds.

That said, the color is beautiful, darkest of the tasting, hazy and brown-gold color. The aroma was super hopped pine, citrus and sweetness. The hop flavor was much more muted than the nose would indicate. I'm getting more sweet than pine or citrus hops. This beer isn't terribly bitter but just seems disjointed with the sweet vs. hops.

All the same, I prefer it bottled. The heaviness of the beer and the intensity of its honey-hopped notes lend themselves to some cooler-carbonated levity. I'm really glad I had the chance to grab this casked, since it really does allow you to get at some of those notes a little more accurately, but the trade off in drinkability I think sends the beer over the edge.","petacutlasaurus","Mar 06, 2011"

Nose was so piney that I began to swoon. It was, in my addled mind, like licking a pine tree. Mouthfeel was medium and the hops had already begun to mute, so the taste was heavier on caramel malt, but I still got some hops on the tongue.

Though good, I just feel like it isn't deserving of the devotion this beer inspires. This is coming from someone that had friends drive 2 hours to a distributor to buy cases and a mini-keg from a distributor (I live in PA). I think that the beer has a very nice hoppy aroma, but is it better than most good, fresh DIPA (probably not). There are smells of wildflower meadow, spruce resin, grapefruit rind, and sweet orange. The beer is definitely hoppy, but the flavor doesn't jump out at me as the best I've ever had. The honey definitely is present in the flavor, but it has a bit of an artificial McDonald's "honey" tanginess. The beer is too thin with too much alcohol (probably from the added honey) that is definitely present on the tongue that contributes to the perceived bitterness of the beer. The beer is tasty and finishing 1 or 2 is not a problem. But you'll definitely suffer palate fatigue after about half a glass from the alcohol and hops and then you won't really know what you're tasting afterwards.","Soonami","Mar 01, 2011"

The nose falls short for me; not bad by any means but nothing out of the ordinary. Good sweet, sugary pine but soft. Not overbearing. Taste is really nice but not as bracingly hoppy as the label states. In fact it is softer than I could've imagined but that could be due to freshness. The bitterness hits the side of the tongue for a moment but then leaves quickly. Not much sting afterward. There is a nice balance to this beer between malt and hop but I'd love more intense hop. Still good though. Mouthfeel is great. Fairly viscous but with good carbonation and makes me want another taste.

This beer smells incredible, citrus fruits, pineapple are up front and do a great job representing the hops with a mild hop sweetness coming though at the end of each whif. Upon tasting this beer i expected it to be boozy for how light it is but instead you get a blast of hop flavor and a much needed malty backbone to hold the beer together, completely masking the alcohol. This beer is light and crisp, something you don't see with many Double IPA's. Where this beer lacks hop bitterness (what can i say i'm a Portland hophead) it makes up for in hip aroma and profile.

Citrusy, piney goodness, with a touch of bitterness on the back end. First sip almost knocked me over. Strong floral hops that are quickly followed by a wave of intense bitterness. There's a nice sweetness lingering there behind the hops that makes the slam a bit more gentle. The impressive thing about this beer is the variety of hop flavors that come through. Though I suspect, based on others' descriptions, that it would be even more intense if it were fresher. Mouthfeel is a bit tingly, fairly light, but lingers in the mouth. This is a very intense, very hoppy DIPA. While it's not exactly my cup of tea (IPAs in general aren't), I can see why it's so highly regarded.","zeledonia","Feb 23, 2011"

The beer pours a orange color with a massive white head, 3-4 fingers worth. Hops up front, followed by a rush of citrus, and pine, prefect balance of the two. I expected this beer to be overwhelming with alcohol content but it wasn't even noticed even towards the bottom of the glass. Upset I haven't picked up more, I would have purchased a case at least. Overall this beer lives up to the hype, and is one I will enjoy each and every spring.","SenkoSnack808","Feb 23, 2011"

It's a treat and highlight to the beer year when it arrives at the local stores in town. But be careful - the ease at the finish is where you can mess yourself up.

4.74,5.8,4,5,4.5,5,5,"The beer pours a just short of translucent tangerine in my glass. The foamy white crown rises to about three fingers in height. It quickly reduces in size by about a third before settling in and just sitting there. While the head retention is more than solid, lacing is a bit spotty. There's an incredibly pungent and perfumey aroma wafting up from the glass. A faint suggestion of honey is almost drowned out by the massive hop notes bombarding my nose. Waves of grapefruit, pineapple, mango, orange, and even a little peach crash over my olfactory sense. The flavor runs along similar lines, and is outstanding, but lacks a little bit of the oomph that the aroma has. The hop bitterness is fairly pronounced, but falls in line sandwiched between a beguilingly subtle, yet flavorful sweetness, and the array of powerful hop flavors. The mouthfeel is spot on, just enough heft in the body to support the massive hops, without getting in the way. At the same time the carbonation is active enough to really get the tropical hop flavors bursting on my palate, without giving too much of a bubbly sensation. There's not even a hint of alcohol, and it's absolutely mind boggling that a 10%, hopped out of its mind DIPA can be this easy to drink. A phenomenal beer from Bell's, and one of a very few that I would readily buy a whole case of at any time.","axeman9182","Feb 21, 2011"

The beer pours a medium orange in color with a nice fluffy white head. The smell is very intense and is of mostly citrusy hops. This is by far one of the most robust, quality smelling beers I've had of this style. The taste is definately hop forward, but the honey balanced it out nicely. There's lots of citrus in the flavor, but a little bit of pine as well, and a touch of sweetness in the finish.

Yes there are nice tropical fruit notes, mango, pinapple, and citrus along with light pine...but it is not so pungent and less then wowing. I also find the flavor to be muted. The components are there, nice honey note accents well citrus, tropical fruit and zesty earth tones the hops bring to the beer. Mouthfeel is not cloying and easy sipping for such a large beer, possibly the biggest success of the beer.

Mostly they are just stupidly hopped beer without regard to balance, but this beer is actually a good base to begin with and then they put a S**t load of hops in it. The result is very good. Even though I am a malt-head and don't drink hoppy beers much, I would definitely drink this beer again...and that is saying something. Give it a shot. If you like flavorful beer, this one won't disappoint you.","SkeeterHawk","Feb 09, 2011"

Nicely balanced leaning toward the sweeter, less floral side for me, definitely notice the honey. So easy to drink that the ABV makes this one quite dangerous for me.

Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy it, and will have no problem finishing my two six-packs. However, for a beer that is regarded with near "Holy Grail" status, I expected something deliciously, and incredibly (kickass) hoppy, but instead got a beer with a dominating booze presence. You know, I may even age a bottle or two. This could develop into something resembling an awesome American-style barley wine.","eternaljester81","Feb 05, 2011"

What I will say is that, in my limited experience drinking IIPAs (I've had Racer X, Founder's Double Trouble, DFH 90, and Stone Ruination to date) this beer leaves all those in the dust.

Taste was immediately resin and pine with citrus fruit cutting through here and there. Sweetness to balance the bitterness from the honey and malts. Surprisingly balanced, but definitely a hop bomb, though not entirely what I expected based on the nose. Slick oily mouthfeel that was coating but not syrupy. Medium to high carbonation.

All in all, this is one of the easiest DIPA's to drink I've come across. The balance and smoothness to it all means that it could disappear quite fast.

Out of the bottle it is a very clear tan straw color with a full head that slithers down to a thin line that leaves ample lacing down the glass, nothing too outstanding here, very common for this type of beer. This is where it gets exciting, this beer smells phonomenal! Catty whiffs mixed with tropical fruit and fresh cut grass that can be smelled from across the room. Now on to the taste portion of our trip. Fresh cut grapefruit and ripe tropical fruit makes your mouth water for more! Very crisp and refreshing, slight sweetness from the honey is found but malts are pushed back and hops take the stage. 10% is lost in traslation of bitterness, leaving the drinker to sip not because of its boozy nature but because it is so hopped up.

The taste follows the nose like a shadow. Sweet fruits are awesomely blended together to create a mouthwatering taste that leaves just enough bitter "crisp" at the end.

I knocked it down a little for the price, because it's a lot of money for this beer. Also it's annoying that stores play with the mrsp, ranging it from 16-22. I fortunately got it at the low end, but I have a buddy who paid the high end. Also it's very heavy so you can't drink too many of these in one night.

My whole 6-pack was gone mere hours after purchase, and I was wishing that I had gone to a store carrying the mini-keg. It has a juice-like draw to it- juice might not be anyone's favorite thing in the world, but it's tasty and refreshing and everyone loves it.

The taste is an adventure tart obvious booze in front, intense citrus hops in the middle and a super strong bitter ending that coats the mouth and demands another drink. A very pleasant mouthfeel acts a as a balanced maybe slighty thick but smooth hop delivery system. I could really drink many glasses of this top notch double IPA.

Chunks of lacing down the glass. Not surprisingly, it looks better here than poured from a bottle. The magnificent smell is there and perhaps even more potent. Fresh and inviting. Green lies underneath throughout and is accompanied by a piney, resinous hop character. A sweetness atop it. Light bready, biscuity scent. Taste is the tongue number that has always been Hopslam. Good balance of bitter and sweet. Bitter is the clear winner but balanced perfectly. Hints of honey do wonders. The finish is dry and tingles the tongue with its bitterness. Somewhat sharp. Before this, a good sticky, resinous sweetness melds with the hops. I could drink it religiously. I only wish to see this beer produced year-round.

The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, pine, citrus hop, grapefruit, and sweet alcohol on the followthrough. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation.

Off the aroma you get a beautiful citrus and floral bouquet, but honey is much more predominant than out of the keg or bottle. During the taste you get: honey, grapefruits, hop oil, and a slight hint of alcohol. The hop oil increasingly coats the pallet during the drink. The mouthfeel off the cask is creamy and preferable.

Taste follows suit, with the honey sweetness leading the onslaught, with the citrus involved being similar to that of the nose. Warming feel and great interplay between the strong bitterness and honey sweetness. Great mouthfeel, and if anything, maybe a touch more bitterness would put this over the edge for me.

I've never seen it for sale and our local store, Beer Run had a limited supply. So, sitting at my miserable soul suckling corporate job at about 4:30, my wonderful wife asks if i saw the last part of the Decemberists live show on NPRs website because they asked Chris Funk what his favorite beer was. That's when it clicked: I forgot to call Beer Run to see if they had got some Hopslam in yesterday! I called. They had about two cases left. So, with $50 gift card in hand (thanks in-laws!) I shutdown my computer and explained to my co-workers, who would never understand, this desperate mission I was on. I showed up to Beer Run with lazer like focus on finding this before the other turdbags did. To my surprise, there were a couple of six packs sitting on top of a case, so I snagged the max I could, which was limited to two per customer. I was to busy chit chatting about how awesome this beer is while the girl rang me up and didn't even notice that it was $20 a six pack. Needless to say, it was well worth it and homeostasis is restored in my bio-dome.","morenone","Jan 19, 2011"

The store permitted mixing a sixer with any variety of singles at a 10% discount, so I popped in two Hopslams and other singles of my favorites. As for the Hopslam, I would have to say the hype is not overdone for this fine beverage as it is truly smoother, cleaner on the palate and so very drinkable over other Double IPAs that I've tried (similar to Pliny the Elder). The beer geek at the store indicated that this year's edition is improved over last year's.

It might be the warming feeling. Speaking of that warming feeling, I can't taste much if any alcohol, and this beer makes me feel slightly warm all over. It creeps on me, though, sneaking in, making me take another sip. After several sips, there is that bitey, tongue-scraping feeling, but balanced well with the taste and the rest of the mouthfeel.

While it is very hoppy, it is not overwhelmingly hoppy like some other fresh IPAs or Imperial IPAs, which often renders those beers much less drinkable. In fact, it's not the hoppiest beer I've ever had, but it is certainly very hoppy in its own right. The important thing is that the powerful zest of the hops is balanced extremely well with notes from the malts and honey used.

A deep, prolonged bitterness (fueled in part by some of the alcohol emerging) finishes with some floral flavors finally surfacing once the initial hop assault fades. There is no hint of discipline or malt backbone which is what diminishes this beer in my eyes. I prefer DIPAs that have complexity on both the hop and malt side of the ledger (such as Dorado, Abrasive and Dreadnaught).

The taste is most akin to drinking liquefied hops. I've eaten a soak hop whole and aside from the (only slight stronger) extreme bitterness this has the same flavors. I now understand why hop heads the world over love having this fresh. I'm not one of them, but hey it's still pretty good. I tried to get malt out of this and all I got is a more grainy pilsner flavor in the background. I can see how the hops falling out of this would cause problems.

I want a cologne that smells like this. The aroma is kind of citrusy sweet with just a bit of honey in the aroma that blends nicely with grassy, piney, bitter hops. Outstanding dry aroma with just a touch of orange zest to round out the aroma. Really a dry flavor to this, with a sweet honey caramel undertone to the grassy hop flavor. The honey is balanced very nicely, adding only a touch of sweetness to this. Feels pretty good in the mouth, but as the bottle says, this is a tongue bruiser with easy carbonation and big hop flavor.

There is a lot of malty sweetness to this beer, I'm not sure when they add the honey in but it definitely does something to smooth this out more than any other DIPA I have tried. A total hop bomb, but yet balanced, a quandry that I choose to enjoy rather than dwell on. Mouthfeel is thick and sticky. Feels like it will chew the enamel off your teeth (in a good way).

I believe I've heard its dry hopped with simcoe hops. Very citrusy with pineapple and piney notes. Very balanced beer for being so hoppy. I wonder when the honey used to make it was added. Medium mouthfeel with perfect carbonation. The alcohol is so well hidden, its dangerous. I could drink many in one sitting, but I have to play daddy tomorrow, so I'll take it easy for now.

Smells are grapefruit, pineapple, floral hops, a little spiciness and a little heaven. Tastes are hops, citrus a touch of pine and a hint of honey. There's some drying going on toward the end followed by a bitter finish. This beer is so balanced for being a huge DIPA, the bitterness is there but it's not so overwhelming that it makes it hard to drink. Mouthfeel is great, it's syrupy but the carbonation makes it seem lighter than it really is. Drinkability is out of this world, I can't even taste the 10% ABV.

4.55,1.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Pours out to a golden color hue that has a thick white creamy head that has very good retention, really great lacing and good carbonation. The smell is hops, sweet honey, citrus all well blended together giving a pleasant aroma that makes you want to take a drink. The taste is a nice honey taste followed by some floral hops and in the middle is the citrus tastes of grapefruit,orange and lemon. The ending taste has some hop bitterness and grapefruit aftertaste like many IPA's, but doesn't have the too strong of bitterness land hop aftertaste like Bell's Two Hearted Ale does. I know this is a double IPA and is stronger than a regular IPA, but this is really nicely balanced in taste and even though can taste some alcohol near the end, it isn't too strong to ruin it. The mouthfeel is a nice creamy smooth feel that has a pleasant feel on the lips and a clinging bite to the tongue and how can a beer this good not be easily drinkable? This is by far the best IPA or double IPA I ever had very highly recommended.","DannyDan","Jan 11, 2011"

Poured a dark golden/light red amber hue appearance. Leaves very nice lace, although the foam head thins out very quickly. Smells of sweet hops and hints of honey. Very dangerously drinkable and quickly became one of my favortie Imperial IPAs where the sweet malt sits in your mouth rather than leaving a bitter taste off the top of your tongue.

Very strong hoppy taste, strong bite from the alcohol which subsides after a few sips, but the honey ties it all together. After a few sips, I stopped tasting the intensity of a alcohol and the bitterness and the complexity of the hops and honey flavor really came through.

I tasted a lot of honey rather than melon, but the honey never blends well with the hop character and the malt bill is just not enough to keep this beer from being overly harsh.

Really huge and bold, floral, perfumy, citrusy nose with a hint of caramel malt. The taste is also huge with the mouth puckering citrus hitting you from start to finish. With that said, it's very well balanced. Really nice resiny, chewy mouthfeel makes this highly drinkable and the alcohol is completely hidden. This could be dangerous. Expected it to be somewhat subdued since it's out of season, but was pleasantly surprised by how big it still was. Can't imagine what a fresh one would be like.

This hops-on-steroids smell is echoed in the taste, which showcases citrus, ruby red grapefruits, tart blood oranges, the basic essence of 50/50, and a deep backbone of light caramel and buttery toffee. This seems like the epitome of the DIPA flavor profile. The body is fairly light, with medium carbonation and a crisp finish that leaves the tongue rather moist, refreshed.

The front of the palate features the orange flavors, and is lightly honeyed. On the mid-palate, the honeyed characteristic continues, but there is also a biscuit flavor. On the back of the palate, the hoppy bitterness kicks in with the orange peel, but it is also quite nice with the vanilla flavor. The beer is full-bodied and coats the entire palate with a long finish. Overall, this is a great IPA. It is super balanced, I can hardly believe that it is ten percent alcohol.

They are so fresh-tasting and intense that words almost fall short in describing them. The hops are very fruity, with tangerine and apricot flavors and a strong piney presence. The hop bitterness is intense upfront and rarely fades in the mouth. The malts are not meant to stand out here and they don't.

The clear body lets me see all sorts of rising and clinging carbonation. It has a big sweet citrus aroma. I taste woodsy hops up front. The hops in the finish are all bitter. There is just a hint of the 10% ABV. It's hard to believe this is a double IPA. The finish is very dry, which is pleasant. The amount of coating is as expected. The body is heavier and carbonation lighter that I thought it would be. All of this makes it so drinkable. I might get knocked over if I have too many, but the alcohol taste will never become a limiting factor, it's just too subtle. The same goes for the bitterness. It's not subtle, but it's never overpowering. The hops are perfectly balanced.","ToasterChef","Mar 29, 2010"

The honey in the HopSlam provides a subtle sweetness but does not take away from the citrus and pine notes that one craves in a hopped-up beer. I live in New England, and HopSlam cannot be found any closer than PA, so I am glad I got to try this excellent beer.

Very hoppy attack and flavor, but not really a bitter beer. I guess its consistent with the DIPA style. The finish smoothes out with a little sweetness that I would swear it wildflower honey. The aftertaste allows the punch of the hops to shine. The mouthfeel is on the thick side, which is to be expected for the style. I would say that the flavors are more interesting than they are drinkable. I enjoyed it, but its probably its unique nature that grabs me more than thinking "I need to keep a case of this on hand." Not an everyday beer. A special occasion type.","Ragingbull","Mar 22, 2010"

What a difference. The 2009 had been stored dark, cool (cellar) and was VERY GOOD. BUT contrasted with the FRESH Hopslam it was considerably mellower with a smoother body, lower head and was of a flatter carbonation. The fresh Hopslam had a face slapping citrus bouquet and from the first sip it had a sharp and stringent smack of grapefruit right into the aftertaste. Wonderfully enjoyable for hopheads BUT maltbellies would be very disappointed.

Good thickness and carbonation. Since the alcohol wasn't that strong, I would almost recommend this as an anytime beer.

Initial smell is inviting...hoppy bitterness, citrusy sweetness and pine and citrus hops all dominate. Amazing smell. The taste virtually lives up to the nose. It is super hoppy, nice and bitter and warming. The lack of maltiness is a nice change from some other brews. This beer doesn't need it to balance it out, it is just plain delicious on its own. The grapefruit and citrus reign supreme on my taste buds. Honeydew and honey dance gingerly on my palate. Mmmm. A decent body and well hidden alcohol content make this beer very drinkable.

However, I don't feel slammed by hops as much I feel slammed by alcohol and malt. I'm sure Bells threw a lot of hops into the brew kettle for this, but I think they are still having some difficulty overcoming the very sweet malts and high alcohol content. If you're fan of high ABV beers and hops, I have no doubt that you're going to like the Hopslam. But if you like your IPAs to showcase hops, like I do, then I think there are better options out there. For my money, I think Bell's Two Hearted IPA makes a better use of hops and is a better beer, in general, but the brews are different styles, so maybe I shouldn't be making the comparison.

It has an incredible clean floral hop aroma with hints of citrus. One of the best noses I have encountered on a beer. The hops are definitely present on the front of the sip. They match the floral notes in the aroma. It is surprisingly smooth. I expected much more bitterness. This is probably the least bitter double IPA I have ever had. The hops are still there just not so abrupt. I am not sure if the honey is responsible for the subdued bitterness or not. The honey is noted in some sweetness at the tail end of the taste and probably adds to the oily mouthfeel along with the hops. This is very smooth and the alcohol is masked making the alcohol content seem to be in the 6%-7% range. Overall and excellent beer. One of the best DIPA I have experienced.

4.12,-8,4,4.5,4,4,4,"After recently having Founders Double Trouble, I think this has more in common with Three Floyds Dreadnaught. Comparing the two, Dreadnaught is vastly superior. It is much more complex and is akin to having a tropical fruit hop explosion in your mouth.

4.3,-4,5,5,4,4,4,"Pours from the bottle with a sparkling, crystal, orange-copper color, and a sticky, bubbly, cream-colored head. The combination of honey and hop aroma smacks me in the face from the second I open the bottle, like if one of those plastic bears from the grocery store came to life, climbed a pine tree, walked through a field of wildflowers, and then started mauling my sinuses with his sticky, sweet, sap-covered paws. Although the aroma is packed with both the honey sweetness and the piney and floral hops, the flavor is much more hop-forward, showcasing the resinous pine and a bit of orange, and with the honey providing a sweet balance. And the flavor and aroma from the honey is wonderfully natural, rather than an artificial, syrupy sweetness. The potency of the flavors deftly masks the 10% alcohol, and although the label claims that this is "a biting, bitter, tongue bruiser", this one is remarkably drinkable. With both a little sweetness and some bitterness lingering on my tongue, and feeling warm on the inside right now, I am certainly content with this year's edition.","devilben02","Jan 31, 2010"

All three are very different in my opinion, yet all three represent the style extremely well. Hopslam is a very balanced beer. I would say The Oracle is a bit of a sweeter DIPA, Hopslam well balanced, and PtE a bit on the bitter side. I feel like I could have one or two of either The Oracle or PtE and then perhaps move on to something else because the style was a bit too sweet or bitter. But with Hopslam, with the nice notes of citrus and pine/hops then balanced by a slight malty backbone which finishes up with a taste of honey...I could session these until I passed out.

Bursting with a bright citrus pop, the smell is incredibly bright and cheery, like wind blowing over an orange tree. The carbonation is perfectly balanced, mixing well with the bright, white grapefruit taste that seems to almost float in your mouth. The finish has a slight bitterness to it not unlike that of citrus zest. Though this beer is INCREDIBLY drinkable, watch out because the 10% ABV will knock you on your ass if you're not careful.

There is a faint smell in the nose that is a little reminiscent of cheese. The taste is solid. Delicious citrus hops that open up more with each sip. Hints of honey, grapefruit, pine and hop resin come through early. There's a bit of bite in the initial taste that is smoothed over by honey in the finish. The beer rolls over your tongue and kind of coats your mouth. The honey really balances this out and keeps the hops in check, making it very, very drinkable.

There is a very prominent citrus fruit presence with hints of mango, pineapple, lemon and orange peel. A sweet honey character comes through mid-palate, complimenting the sweetness of the citrus notes and adding to the fullness of the palate. The sweetness is balanced by a dry earthy pine presence. Maltiness is very subtle but contributes to the amazing complexity and balance of this excellent beer.

Not overly bitter, but just enough to make you want to pucker a little bit, very smooth and packed with more fresh hop taste than one could hope for. This is definately a beer i could sit down a pound a lot of, the only problem is the 10% ABV, which isnt a problem as much as an obstacle. wish this was more readily available throughout the year so i wouldnt have to stockpile so much at once, but i'll take it when i can get it and in as much quantity as possible!","brewbasterd","Jan 21, 2010"

If you're not so much into the hops, try this beer because that hop bite you don't like goes away fairly quickly and different tastes come through in this beer.

This brew appears simple but is surprisingly complex when you stop this analyse the taste. It has a complex honey and hop base, but strikes you with all kinds of floral aromas: fruity, spicy, and interesting. It is crisp and smooth, but mostly umami overall. I rarely drink just one, simply superb.","OttoBomb","Jan 21, 2010"

The smell is pretty hop forward with dank and fruity pineapple and grapefruit rind hop notes with just a touch of honey. The flavor on this one is like drinking fresh hops straight up with just enough malt backbone and light honey sweetness to keep it in check. The alcohol is well hidden. Mild carbonation and medium bodied. Hopslam actually almost lives up to it's hype. This is what I look for in a DIPA. This beer is pretty darn hard to beat when served fresh.","biggred1","Jan 20, 2010"
4.62,3.1,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured an almost clear, bright, orange-honey with nearly an inch of white creamy head. Good rentention and lacing throughout. Smell is amazing...crisp floral hops, fresh citrus and pine. Taste lets the hops explode. The bitterness is so crisp and fresh and is perfectly balanced with smooth honey and a very light malt presence. Ever so slight alcohol presence that actually compliments the total balance and adds a bit of warmth. Mouthfeel is very nice. Very smooth, nice amount of carbonation while still having an almost creamy feel on the tongue. Semi-dry finish that lets an almost perfect bitterness, that begs for the next sip, linger on the tongue. It's amazing how quickly you will find yourself at the bottom of this 10% abv. I really had to resist the urge to have another, which was probably a good idea. There's always tomorrow.

4.24,-5.4,4,5,4,4,4,"Apricot golden body, tiny hop flecks visible and a classic ivory creamy, spritzy cap. The nose is very aromatic like a freshly prepped bowl of ambrosia. Lots of ripe citrus in the nose, specifically tangerine and ruby red grapefruit. Small pine character in the background. The taste is crisp, hoppy and I could tell upon first drink the mouthfeel is superb. The label claims this beer was brewed with honey and I think I could tell that for myself even if they didn't help out with that bit of information. Hops, hops and more hops, well balanced though with a good sized malt backbone,pale and caramel malts try to balance the hop onslaught and do, almost, lots of honey encrusted tangerine, resinous, pithy hops buds, the honey gives a sweet, sugary parity to the beer along with notes of dried apricots. Mouthfeel is sharp, nectary and crisp. The taste is big but not great. I appreciate the boldness, bitterness, balance and power of the hops, it's just not amazing. I'll say it, it's overrated a little. Change the name from Hopslam to Bells Double IPA and this beer averages to an A- and doesn't crack the top 100 or garner as much hype.","natelocc787","Jan 18, 2010"

It is floral with a hint of citrus at first and finishes with a touch of malt and honey backbone, very well balanced. I don't usually like much malt in my IPAs, but this is done right! Mouthfeel is fine for and DIPA a bit thicker than a normal IPA, as to be expected.

This beer taste of a hop plant, check the label. It starts strong and finish's like a 12 round heavy weight champion. It's mouthfeel is a like a lingering hangover sitting on your tongue.

The aroma is intensely hoppy, slap you in the face American hops, tangerine and apricot aromas come to my mind. The flavor is like the smell, very very hoppy with a solid yet not overpowering hop bitterness. There is a bit of sweet malt and a warming quality from the high ABV, although that is appreciated and is not harsh. The carbonation is medium and body medium as well. Overall an intense, well crafted, very enjoyable beer. At its ABV it is amazing how drinkable this beer is, I especially enjoy the over the top hop flavor/aroma and yet not exceedingly bitter.","uwmgdman","Jan 09, 2010"

Its pungent and overpowering but just beckons my lips to the glass. The taste, the name says it all. Its as if all the hops off the vine gathered their might together to just pop me in the mouth. The honey doesn't do much to this beer as far as sweetening it, but rather keeps the bitterness in check as all of the other flavors develop. I think it helps to tame the alcohol warmth, while not totally killing it. What an amazing elixir.","RocPorterFanatic","Jan 09, 2010"

This is what I imagine raw hops would taste like if you pressed them and drank them. And if I thought the smell was outstanding, the taste is even more ridiculous! So fresh and delicious! It takes a minute to get used to as the taste can be overwhelming at first, which is probably a good thing at 10% ABV.

There's a nice amount of pine in there as well. The sweetness is more developed than with the aroma and serves as a nice counterbalance to the bitterness of the hops. Not sure if it's the honey or the malt. Whatever it is, the taste is absolutely phenomenal. A nice dry finish leaves me refreshed yet wanting more. It's easy to forget this is 10% ABV as it's very drinkable. I think Hopslam is an appropriate name. I could see myself slamming these back all night. The balance of flavors is hard to beat and it's so ridiculously refreshing. I want to gulp it. A friend of mine gave me a few bottles to try.

Some BA's have argued that it would be unfair to rate a DIPA/IPA that is considered faded. However, I personally feel that this should only hold true for beers that could be rated unfairly based on that fact alone. Although Hopslam may be considered faded at this point, I still saw past that and thoroughly enjoyed it. IMO this brew still had a strong hop profile, albeit, faded, and although other BA's may disagree with this, I still feel that a potentially "faded" Hopslam was still one of the best DIPA's I have managed to get my hands on, and would like to get my hands on again ASAP(doesn't distribute to Massachusetts).","KBoudreau66","Jun 06, 2009"

A sticky, curvy lace is revealed as the froth slowly drifts away, leaving a thick covering atop. Subdued and pleasant citrusy hops float to the nose. Tastes fruity, citrusy and malty upfront with the hops coming at the end, adding to, and not overpowering the palate. Spice and pine exist, as does some butterscotch or other such candy. The honey comes in and adds a nice texture to the whole experience. Equanimity is achieved across the board. The alcohol heat bites at the throat just a bit, but is welcomed, not at all bothersome, but demands care. The mouth-feel is a perfect medium, as it doesn't weigh you down; demands sipping, but also has a certain hint of fluff that allows you stay in for the long haul. This is an exceptional, highly approachable and satisfying beer that reminds me of bittersweet candy, candy which I would not hesitate to steal from a child.","stephens101","Jun 02, 2009"

I dunno... but I will definitely seek out an uber fresh sample of this when available and compare it with these notes. As is this beer pours a sturdy looking amber color, darkish, with a small head fading pretty quickly. Smell is hoppy, citrus mostly, orange peel, but then dominated by a sweet maltyness. Very heavy on the malt as well in the taste. I'm not getting destroyed by the hops here. A vanilla sweetness and an orange citrus flavor prevail over everything else. Perhaps a little too sweet from the added honey. And a little boozy to be honest. If there was a bigger hop presence this may be covered up but it's just not holding up. Malty, sweet, sticky, chewy, kind of clumsy.

However once the beer has calmed down and your tounge acclimated, the taste is grapefruit up front fading to a lingering, strong pine.

I don't see this as a session beer with such thick constitution and heavy hops. But this a quality hop concoction.

Ultra fresh hops, super clean, pineapple dominates, but also hints of pine and sour apple, solid honey sweetness. Taste is along the same lines as the smell. Definitely pure and clean hops, but not the exact flavor I enjoy best in a 2IPA. That's what kills this beer vs the hype for me. It's brewed excellently and tastes great, but just isn't my favorite flavor. Sweet honey malt helps balance the bitterness and makes it easier to drink, but it's still more of a sipping beer. Body was a little thick, but not as much as I was expecting from the cask. Basically no carbonation, and lasting bitterness in the aftertaste. Alcohol is nicely hidden, almost too well. Not sure if cask is worth the hype over regular tap? Overall, this was a pleasure to drink, but still not my favorite beer in the world.","Pencible","Mar 11, 2009"

On the nose, there's a brilliant hop character, prominent and complex with pine and tropical fruit - pineapple, orange, mango. Just brilliant. On the palate, this beer is just brilliant. All the hops come through spectacularly. Light in body with a bit of sweetness that balances the hops really well, this beer is a treat. The cask conditioning of this beer really takes it to another level with a soft and creamy mouthfeel. And the drinkability? My first pint lasted 10 minutes.","DefenCorps","Mar 11, 2009"

The aromas that this one gives off is a reason to fall in love with this beer. It is by and far the best smelling beer that I have had the privilege of experienced.

A little sweetness and alcohol in the smell as well. The taste is remarkabley smooth considering the alcohol content. Grapefruity, hoppy, pine tree, and a touch of sweetness come together to form the best IPA I've ever had. Its medium body and texture is close to perfect and it's quite easy to drink.

It goes down extremely well, better than I thought it would. The alcohol is there, but hidden very well for the 10% ABV. Mouthfeel is prtty bitter and acidy, in a good way.

The mouthfeel is smooth and silky that belies the bitterness and is further offset by the honey sweetness added into this beer, which while it adds an interesting element to the beer, takes a bit away from the overall hop experience. Still though, this is one of the most astounding beers I've ever had the pleasure to cross my palate.

The hops are definitely showcased which is nice to see in an IIPA. Yet, the induction of honey provides a level of depth and mouthfeel that adds to the complexity of the beer without taking away from the pungent hop character.

Like any beer out of a cask it was less carbonated, which is very good, and the flavor were more prevelant. Definitely had the grapefruit hop, and the honey finish on the end. I was lucky enough to get in on the ass end of the cask and the pour, and I do mean pour as the spout had been removed at that point, was like a blond mud.

A fairly clear golden color with nairy a hint of carb but sticky lace clings to the glass throughout. Nice hop bite yet creamy mouthfeel. The hops are piney yet the citrusy aspect and smooth mouthfeel make for a harmonic convergence of flavor. That was lame, but its accurate.

Pours a light amber golden color with a half finger of frothy head that leaves gobs of retention on the sides of the glass. Smell is all grapefruit. I don't know how else to describe it but grapefruit citrus smell with maybe a hint of biscuitlike malt hidden deep. Taste is citrus hops up front(grapefruit, hints of banana and orange peel) followed seemlessly by smooth biscuitlike malts. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and not as dry as most DIPAs are. Drinkability is amazing for such a high ABV beer. Alcohol is perfectly hidden and kind of scary this could be so easy drinking. This is the best DIPA I've ever had, ever. This beer deserves a perfect 5. If this were available year round I'd stop trying new beers and this is all I would drink(at least for this style).

Nothing pure hop bliss. Pine and citrus all the way. Taste? Well, what can I say? It's delicious. So much orange, grapefruit, and various citrus flavors backed up by some pine resin and a very solid, very sweet backbone. Do I like it better on tap? Well, probably not. The first time I had it out of the bottle (which my bottle review implies) was just magical. I can't see that first experience being topped.

Hops up front with a hint of the honey sweetness are followed by a nice hoppy bitter finish. Crisp and refreshing.

The taste didn't disappoint, with a great deal of fruity hops on the tongue right off the bat. Finishes off so smoothly that you'd never know about the high ABV.

Taste wise, this is a phenomenal IIPA. It claims to be "biting and bitter" but this is balanced so well that the most harsh IPA critic would even enjoy this brew. It's hard for me to discern the initial flavor, but afterwards you get a nice kick of hops all the way down. So so good. This one is creamy, smooth, tasty, well balanced, and perfectly crafted.

After taking a sip the mouthfeel is good, not light at all but not heavy just right really. The taste is very sweet because of the honey and the hops stand out nicely, piiney and a bit citrusy. The flavor is very good. With a 10% ABV it's hidden very well making this beer very very drinkable. I could easily drink these!

This year, it's $17.99 (before tax). I lucked out. The store at which I purchased it sold it to me at cost due to the fact that I spend a lot of money there, despite being employed by a competing liquor store. The damage was $13.30.

Leaves ring of lacing on the glass. A surprisingly sweet smell for an IPA. The hops are only just detectable next to the grapefruit/honey aroma. Sweet on the nose and seems to oscillate between the sweetness of the honey and the bitterness of the hops. As you swallow, it slides smoothly down your throat and that sweet taste sets in for a few seconds, after which the hop taste takes over for good. This is one of the most flavor packed beers I have ever had, and I'm not just talking about hops! This is a perfectly balanced IPA on a level of greatness I didn't even think was possible.

Taste is nothing short of outstanding, If your like me; and in love w/these wet coast hop-bombs you don't want to miss a chance to get your hands on the mid-west's version of this style.

It also has a very unique nose-stinging chemical like hop aroma that hits me as pull the beer away from my nose. Maybe it's the dankness of the hops coming through. Whatever this smell is, the other DIPAs I've tried don't have it. The taste is like putting marijuana and citrus fruits together in a blender and serving it as a drink. The dankness of the beer is very pronounced. It definitely has a good deal of malts too and balances well. After my first sip my saliva became much more viscous due to the balancing malts. Mild/medium bittering aftertaste. Mouth feel is medium light with just the right amount of carbonation. Drinkablity is remarkable for a 10% ABV beer.

The nose is a citrus fest of pink grapefruit, tangerine, lime, if you can adjust to this you might be able to tease out pine resin, rose hips, nectarine, papaya and pineapple fruit scents, not much discernible malt-wise but doesn't feel out of balance, very credible lift in the nostrils. Medium-bodied, isn't bitter at all, more stings or pinches the palate than bites it. Same gargantuan element of pink grapefruit, tangelo, lime citrus, equally sweet and sour. The floral dimension a touch stronger, aided by the honey accents. On the other hand, any pine or charcoal flavors step back. Texturally, it's crisp and lively and built for speed, glides down the chute. No grassy nor herbaceous pucker, the hops taste fresh like you could wring them out with your hands. Carbonation shows a gentle but persistent hand. Real fun to throw back.","farrago","Jan 29, 2009"

A nice semi-crisp medium bodied with a bit of oiliness resin. I expected a major bitterness but was surprised on how smooth it was for having so much hops. Don't get me wrong this is a very hoppy beer that made me pucker up like most IPAs and DIPAs. However it is still pretty smooth especially for having a 10% abv.

This beers flavor sums up what I'm always looking for on the first sip of a DIPA. Huge blasts of mango and peaches with some grapefruit trying to wiggle its way forward in the flavor profile. Absolutely magnificent. Also the malt backbone really adds a subtle sweetness the background of the hops. The mouthfeel is everything I want in a DIPA.

Head had a slight orange tint. Smelled like grapefruit, pine, and malt. No alcohol was detected. Had a strong grapefruit flavor. Along with that piney hops. Also hints of malt. Had a slight bitter aftertaste. Actually not as strong as I thought it would be. Felt good in the mouth. I thought the carbonation was right. Another ale that you would have to be carefull while enjoying. The taste is so good and smooth, all you want to do is gulp it down. With the higher alcohol content you would have to be carefull. I had a good buzz after two.","youngleo","Jan 20, 2009"

There is a lot of grapefruit and other citrus in the aroma from the hops. The taste like the aroma suggests is dominated by the fresh citrusy hop flavors. There is also a solid malt backbone, but it is overshadowed by the delicious hop profile. The drinkability is extremely high for a brew of this caliber, however it is probably not a good idea to drink more than a couple of these in one sitting.

Poured a dark amber-golden with medium clarity and medium to heavy carbonation with a slight white head. The hops are apparent at quite a distance, and once you actually put your nose in it, you've reached the motherland. On the tip of the tongue, the bitter hops are already being absorbed, and upon swallowing, the piney flavor melds with the monster hops to the most pleasurable blend imaginable. It's medium to heavy bodied and a true hop-SLAM, yet goes down smooth and remains extremely drinkable.

Received this as a generous extra from bgramer (thanks Brendan). Batch 8277 printed on the bottle. Served in my Delirium Tremens tulip. Poured a hazy orange-gold with a one-inch loose head. Cap reduced to half its size within seconds before settling into a thin skim of foam and ringlets. Some strands of watery lacing adhered to the walls of the glass during the tasting. Scent off the cap pop was sweet; however, aromas in the glass yielded a predominantly floral hops nose, with a mead-like quality detectable in the background. Taste consistent with nose, with a very complex flavor profile; both sweet and bitter at the same time. Medium-bodied mouthfeel with a slightly viscous feeling and a light effervescence in the mouth.

The flavor definitely delivers full-on hoppiness, no doubt. The flavors are excellent, bitter, floral, citrus, bitter finish, no complaints there. There is honey in this beer, and that sweetness is apparent, attempting to balance the ramped-up alcohol. The resulting mouthfeel is a bit slick and oily, which IMO detracts from the intense deliciousness of the hops. Again I am left not understanding the need for DIPAs. For me, Two Hearted delivers the same mouth puckeringly delicious hop flavors and aromas in a much more drinkable beer. No doubt as DIPAs go, this is a great one, and I am unlikely to turn one of these down if offered, but I'll take a near perfect IPA over a DIPA any day.","kenito799","May 18, 2008"

Pours a somewhat hazy orange, with not too much heading, but a good enough white lacing. Smell is everything that you would want from a good Imperial IPA: resiny hops, citrus fruits, earthy hops...its got it all. I have to say that taste wasn't quite as good. The citrus notes came through well, with lots of pineapple, mango and orange along withe the hops, but I don't know, it felt as if something essential was missing....perhaps a bit more malt balance? Mouthfeel is viscous and sweet, yet bitter. One is more than enough for me in one night, but still, I am glad I had the chance to try this brew from Bell's.

Rich nose of fresh, grassy, juicy citrusy hops on top of a subtly sweet and spicy malt backbone. Hops have faded just barely over the last couple months as the bitterness has died down a little and the sweet and spicy maltiness is playing a larger role in the finish. Medium to full bodied, and the carbonation is on point for what I look for in IIPAs. If you told me this beer was 10% I would have laughed at you.

3.98,-11.2,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"From a fairly hard pour I got about a 2 inch head which dropped a little but doesn't really seem to be going anywhere. It is a gorgeous copper gold color, rich and beautiful. The smell is floral hoppiness, clean and fresh with a slight sticky sweet character. The flavor is sharp citrusy hoppiness up front, a sweetness develops, then drops right into a lingering hop biting bitterness. This is far from a balanced beer, more like unadulterated hopjuice, but with a name like Hopslam that is obviously what they were going for. The mouthfeel is average, and drinkability is good for a 10% tastebud peeler. The honey added does a little to mellow it out. If you are a hophead this beer is great. I wouldn't call it complex, but it is what it is and I like that.","Godot","Apr 01, 2008"

However, there was a distinct fruitiness to this brew. As I continued drinking it, I noticed it smelled exactly like a grapefruit. My husband remarked that it smelled like floral perfume. Super hoppy taste, which I expected, however it lacks that signature bite of many IPAs, making it quite drinkable. The finish is very clean and pleasantly bitter. I found this beer to be quite balanced and delicious.","jenbys2001","Apr 01, 2008"

The taste starts with a very, very brief bit of sweetness followed a powerful punch of hop bitterness that knocks your socks off but slowly fades away to a soft bitter aftertaste. As the beer warms, the bitterness calms down, the alcohol starts to show up, and the flavors smooth out a bit. The mouthfeel is nice and medium-bodied.

The best characteristic of this beer is that I taste the best aspects of hops without the drawbacks (extreme bitterness, pith flavor, etc.), and that the subtle sweetness perfectly tempers the rawness of the hops. I only have this bottle at the moment, or I would be sorely tempted to crack another. I only dock half a point from the drinkability because more than a couple might knock one off one's barstool. Highly recommended.","VikingBeer","Mar 15, 2008"

The first thing you will notice with this beer is aroma. My god it is a heavenly smell. It is very much a flowery bouquet in there. Now I have not yet learned my hops by smell but I am sure more experienced beer lovers could pick out the hops used in this brew just based on the smell. It has a smooth and sweet taste. One that makes drinking more than one very easy to take down. However, that is not good as it 10% ABV. So it's pretty easy to get drunk off this beer, which is a shame.

4.52,0.9,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"2008 version (10% ABV) Pours a golden bronze with a thick, creamy two and a half finger head. Dull clarity with excellent retention and spectacular spiderweb lacing. The nose is truly amazing- heavy pine needle scent with robust tangerine/mango tropical hop oil aroma, some orange and grapefruit rind in the background; and a soild caramel malt backing. There is another sweet aroma here I could not place, but when I noticed that the label says it is brewed with honey, I found that to be a likely culprit. The first sip reveals the honey further- like clover with a touch of orange blossom- the malt tastes like a medium roast crystal with some two-row thrown in for good measure. Thankfully, the sweetness carries over into the aftertaste and attempts some kind of balance. The first wave of hop flavor is a pungent mix of pine sap-tangy ripe fruit; followed by fresh cut grass and oranges, and finally grapefruit and resinous earthy hop oils and cling to the tounge but in a very soft- low cohumulone sort of way. This beer is bursting with both malt and hop flavor- especially american "C" varieties like Cascade, Chinook, Columbus and Centennial; yet is does not overwhelm the taste buds with boistrious alpha acids or astringent bitterness like some other hop bombs. This beer presents a unique and charismatic malt profile set against a showcase of west coast hop volatiles. The body is full and the carbonation light- just enough to prevent cloying and lift some of the more stubborn hop residues. It finishes flashy and saturated with the taste of fresh hop cones dipped in honey and copper-colored malt. The flavor is balanced enough to achive a good drinkability despite the heavy mouthfeel and lingering flavors. This limited availability seasonal is elite amongst it's D.I.P.A. bretheren, but still not worth the $16.00 a six pack price tag- hop crisis be damned.","PBRstreetgang","Mar 10, 2008"

The smell is surprisingly malty and a tad sweet with big citrusy hops following. The taste is amazing! Delicious blend of citrusy and piney hops with a spicy oiliness that coats the tongue and has a flavor almost of cinnamon in its intensity. More pine, grapefruit, and orange follow. The sweet malt and honey play a supporting role that beautifully props up the hops, and there is almost a peach flavor at the end that makes me want to guzzle the beer. Great body, balance, and finish. I know this is 9.3% abv, but you can't tell.

Nice copper-amber color with a finger of white head on top that leaves a touch of lacing as the beer drains. Nose is incredible. Tons of piney hops hit you first, then a good bit of candy sweet malt as well. Unlike a lot of DIPAs, this one is definitely hop leaning; Bell's didn't seem to pour on the malt to balance it out, but really allowed the hops to dominate the flavor. But in a good way. Taste is amazing. Tons of piney hops again, some sweet caramel malt, grapefruit, and a touch of decidedly biting sweetness (some reviewers called it pineapple). The ABV is incredibly well hidden - not even noticeable in the least. Body is perfect for the style. Not syrupy, but thick and full bodied with perfect carbonation. Overall, an incredible beer. One of the best DIPAs I've had, along with Southern Tier's Unearthly Imperial IPA and Dogfish Head's 120 (which is a much sweeter beer). Really a great one.","soupyman10","Feb 18, 2008"

Every little nuance is part of it's charm). The smell is VERY sweet and sour citrusy tang, one of those marihootchie strains that's got it's own name, a walk in a northern Michigan woods on a nice late spring day and a understated malt backbone. Upfront in the taste grapefruit. Before I go any farther if you don't like grapefruit-this isn't for you. Personally though, they're part of my breakfast at least twice a week so I'm right at home having this as the evenings night cap. That dry sour that gives you pucker power. There's definitely a combination of at least a few different hops given this a distinct character. Crisp with a nice medium body in the mouth. Leaves a slight sting on the tongue that lingers but down the throat is smooths all out with the honey and the malt giving a warm sweetness in the finish with a bit of alcohol burn to remind you that this is over 9% abv and 106 IBU's.","Dalem","Feb 16, 2008"

Basically no malt in the aroma, but who cares, this one is about the hops! On the palate it just explodes. The bitterness of the hops is really explosive, there's just enough malty sweetness to keep it from being a real bruiser. The alcohol is quite noticeable, and it also enhances the bitterness. Carbonation is appropriate, and there is no slickness in this brew, body is rather low, a bit over attenuated perhaps?

The head, while it is there, serves as a nice marshmallow contrast to the rich hues of the beer's body. Immeadiately I can smell this sucka'. A good foot and a half and it is still unmistakable and plain as day. Yup, this is the Hopslam I remember. Deep floral aromatics with a sweet underpining of succulant malt. And yeah, even the honey notes dance around. Ugh, just delicious. And I haven't even tasted it yet. Wow, the hops literally race all around the perimeter of the tongue with spicy, resinous pitchforks, prodding at the sides and back of my buds while the heavy malt body cooly slides down the middle of the mouth. The balance on this bottle of jet fuel is stunning. It's drinkability is surely many a mother's ruin. THough a raging 10% a.b.v. it is nowhere to be found. Mmmmm, must buy more. I wonder how much blood I need to sell on a weekly basis to keep this in the fridge while supplies last? If you just skipped down to the end of this review, the bottom line is this is GOOD.

(Oh man, even my burps smell good...nice and hoppy.) The alcohol pairs well with the greenery to give the aftertaste a memorable bite. Although I had no qualms about paying $11.99 for a six pack of Hopslam, a little voice in the back of my mind had its doubts about the hype.

This pours a shade of amber I associate with the containment of prehistoric bugs. The taste is heavy on the grapefruit - and I like that end of the DIPA spectrum - with plenty of apricot, orange peel and a nice hot spicy background that reminds of Belgian IPA's. Not much of a malty body to start, but becomes a bit more prominent as this warms up and helps prop up the fruity bitterness. This finishes a bit dry for my liking and is a little lacking in layers. It's also a little medicinal on the very tail end, which is unfortunately what lingers. Even so, I keep coming back for another smell and sip. And another. If it weren't for the slightly unpleasant notes creeping in at the 11th hour, this might be toward the top of my DIPA list.

However, its unexceptional look is deceiving. Upon raising the tulip to my nose, I am greeted with one of the most sensational aromas my two nostrils have ever beheld. Absolutely unadulterated hops. Delicious fruity smells such as grapefruit, pineapple, and mango. Crisp pine smells also sing their songs. Lying underneath all of this is honey. Rarely does a beer leave me in such awe before even taking my first sip. Taste does not disappoint. Hops like crazy. Super unbalanced, but really, a malt presence would just get in the way here. Mouthfeel is surprisingly perfect for this. It's nice and light considering the punch it packs. Great carbonation. Really, I wouldn't change this one bit. Extremely drinkable.

I can feel the carbonation is low but it is like the hops just make the beer "pop" on the tongue and makes it tingle. Medium body and a slight oily feel. The first beer goes down nicely, the second is slower, and then you suffer from palate fatigue and you might as well stop drinking this one for the day(not to mention the ABV).

IPA, but it seems as if they were waiting for the market to get used to this big IPA frenzy, THEN introduce HopSlam and disrupt the blanket perception of what this stuff is really supposed to taste like.

It is actually a little clearer than Two-Hearted which I find a little surprising. I can smell this beer as I pour it. It smells like I have hop cones under my nose. Pink grapefruit and resinous pine hit my nose with the power of a Roy Jones Jr. punch. There is a decent smell of pineapple coming though as well. Fresh citrus fruit and a deep pine flavor hit your palate up-front with a dry sweetness finishing off the beer on the back of the mouth. There is some slight sweet malt coming to the palate, but is pushed around by the heavy hop flavors and takes a back seat in the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is very smooth and medium bodied. The high carbonation leaves a very dry sensation on your tongue. The drinkability is a little hampered by the high ABV and dry sensation, but is very high for just a beer or two.","TheodorHerzl","Jan 20, 2008"

A spicy, snappy, hoppy treat of a beer with a sweeter hop note up front and a bitter, resiny bite in the back. This one is kinda the balls.

Head almost instantly faded into a ring of bright white lace in the glass. Smell: Smooth , somewhat aggressive herbal hop aroma, tons of biscuity malt aroma, pears, citrus fruits, and pine all rose from the glass.

The taste has five or six distinct hop tastes to it, but unfortunately never really develops any of them. You can tell that great time and energy went into this beer, but it seems like less time went into studying how the hops would react to each other, and whether or not they would all form together.

Taste is not what I expected at all. Yeah the hops are there, but it's not that bitter at all. The malt displays itself quite well in the taste, very bready. A pale tasting malt, but perfect for this style. Hops seem to switch to a pine taste, but very pleasant. This is one complex tasting beer! Mouthfeel is very thick and chewy with little carbonation.

The taste is all hops, it does not have an overt malt prescense. Of course there must be a ton of malts to balance out all these hops. The hops add lots of bitterness (like you would expect) but, there is an amazing amount of "aroma" hops in the taste. The mouthfeel is just right, not to light, not to thick, great balance.

Served in a snifter, the beer pours an amber/orange color with about a half inch white head which goes away pretty quickly. With a name like HopSlam, of course it smells like hops. Citrus (grapefruit) and piney hops dominate, with some malt in there. It tastes pretty much the same, but the citrus taste is stronger, with grapefruit, lemon and some orange in the taste, along with a piney/floral taste and some grain/malt. Mouthfeel is nice and full, with it being creamy and oily. Just the right amount of carbonation, too. The relatively high ABV isn't very noticable, and it's very, very drinkable.

4.37,-2.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"12oz bottle (I am assuming this a 2006 release) poured into a pint glass. It is copper in color with a small white head that recedes fairly quickly into a light covering. Also there is quite a bit of yeast from the bottom of the bottle that got stired up in the pour. The smell is very nice for a DIPA, hops and more hops. It is good mix of pine and grapefruit that yields a sweet bready malt smell through it all. The first sip is not as hoppy as the smell but very well balanced. It has an initial kick of pine but quickly turns to the malt and alcohol and finishes with a very nice bitter. It also has a slight medicinal flavor to it, but not overly strong. This is a good double ipa and doesn't get too sweet like some do in this style. The alcohol is just a tad warm for me, but not enough to say it is distracting. The mouthfeel is medium to thick and coats the mouth nicely. The overall drinkability is good for 9.3 abv beer.

This is an excellent tasting beer, even better than it's brother Two-Hearted, IMO. There's some grapefruit flavor up front which gives way to pineapple sweetness and it all ends with a bitter, dry hop kick. This is by no means the hoppiest beer ever, but it is incredibly well balanced for a double IPA. Mouthfeel is syrupy and delicious - the carbonation amount is just right.

This time it was great, other times it's a bit too sweet for my taste. It pours a golden yellow with very little head (there is a good bit of lacing though). The aroma is slightly peachy with a lot of nice, clean hoppy citrus. The taste is similar, but there's a definite warming and you can taste the alcohol (not in a bad way). This beer is less malty that some of the recent DIPAs I've had, but the little malt flavor it does have is a nice caramel. The mouthfeel is full and smooth and it leaves a nice sticky bitterness on the back of the tongue. Overall, a great Double IPA.","surlysober","Mar 19, 2007"

Alcohol is very well hidden in the flavor, though a nice warming of the face takes place after putting one of these back. If it wasn't for the 9%abv I could see making a session of these, instead I'll enjoy a couple and call it a night. A fantastic DIPA from the folks at Bell's.

According to the BJCP, slight haziness is allowable if it is dry hopped, but this is a bit more than that. It doesn't seem to clear with time either. There is a huge hop bouquet even from a distance. Very strong citrus aromas, especially grapefruit, but slightly more bitter. The flavor is amazing though. It is not nearly as bitter as the flavor would have led me to believe. It is a dead ringer for actual grapefruit flavoring. The bitterness is only in the background, and there is enough sweetness to back it up. This is a great example of an Imperial IPA (except the cloudiness); perhaps one of the best i've had.","drseamus","Mar 13, 2007"

It's like a piney citrus explosion in my nose, and I can't get enough of it. Truly a delicious scent. Reminds me of the 120 Minute in a way. Large and in charge. More beers should smell like this. The taste is great too. Fresh and hoppy, with pine, grapefruit, and pepper flavors. Noticeable alcohol presence here as well. Quite tasty indeed. Nice, smooth mouthfeel. Hoppy bitterness all down the back of the mouth and throat. Nicely done. I'm not surprised that it's over 9% ABV, but I wouldn't have guessed it. The alcohol is noticeable, as I said, but not overwhelming. This would pair nicely with a spicy Thai or Indian dish, and might even match up well with a strong blue cheese like Stilton.

The result is a golden-amber hued beer with minimal carbonation streams and a vibrant, sudsy head of just-this-side-of-white foam, sticky and thick. Juniper-infused citrus juice blend in the nose: grapefruit, satsuma, blood orange. A coy sugary sweet scent sneaks around underfoot. The taste of this IPA is B-I-G: big candied orange peel malts and big citric hop bitterness. Grapefruit pith and pinetar candy in the middle. Sweetroll breadiness at the finish. Substantial mouthfeel, slippery but not yet syrupy -- always a plus in my book -- with a slight pepperiness all around.

Good frothy white head and decent lacing. Taste matches the aroma- just an assault of fruits and hop flavour. No astringent bitterness whatsover. Just amazing- trust Bells to accomplish that. Along with the hops is a sweet malt back bone that gives a rich mouthfeel. I would say that this is a balanced DIIPA despite the hops. Exceptionally drinkable which would be very dangerous. I would love to try this on tap one day. Alcohol is absolutely hidden. Finish is a bit spritzy from the caronation but finishes clean somewhat bitter.

There is a little pine in there, some citrusy grapefruit, tangerine, and lime, along with some fresh peaches, and a faint toffee smell in there. Taste is more of the same as the aroma. Mouthfeel is a little more thin than you would expect from an IIPA but still good. Drinkability is great, no sign of the alcohol and this definitely goes down easy.

Taste is a grapefruit truck, almost puckering with hops, lots of citrus and pine, again almost no malt, slight graininess, not a lot of depth the the hops certainly slam you good. Balanced in the sense the IBU's match the malt, not overdone in that sense but hopped to hell and back. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, alcohol warmth.

The floral and grapefruity aromas are delicious. The taste is also delicious. Aromatic citrusy hops give way to drying bitter hops. And your taste buds are officially fried. The only thing to do is have another. But be careful, as I learned the first time I bought this. It is way too easy to drink considering the alcohol level.","bigbubba","Jan 17, 2007"

Good, but that's it. Of course, the flavor was similar, with very little sweetness. A little oily and yeasty, and the finish lingered all day. In the mouth it was very pleasant - surprisingly smooth, and gently carbonated. Overall, this was a good brew, and I didn't notice the alcohol until I got a little loopy later.

I got exactly what I expected from this beer which was Two Hearted Ale with more hops and more alcohol. However, more doesnt necessarily mean better. Two Hearted Ale is one of the best beers Ive ever had and the extra hops and alcohol dont make this beer better than Two Hearted Ale, just more hardcore.

Slam is right for the taste; multiple levels of hop bitterness, maltyness in a thick body. It lights up sweet and bitter at the outset, levelling off to a creamy sweetness, and leaving a bitter tang at the end. Alcohol comes out more in the flavor than the nose, but I'm sure it acts to enhance the flavors. Very good drinkability, but the alcohol leaves a trail on the way down, so I don't have a desire to drink it rapidly.","CH3CH2OH","Dec 31, 2006"
4.59,2.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Clear, deep gold, just short of orange. The foam off the pour was a mixture of fine, creamy bubbles and larger ones that clung to the glass. The head fell somewhat, leaving some lacing behind. Throughout the glass there was a constant renewal of lace. Intense hop aroma. Grapefruit and pineapple give it a sweet-tart quality and pine resin keeps things interesting. It's a little powdery, floral and smells very fresh. Strong bitterness is kept in check by significant malt sweetness. The malt isn't really complex, but that's not the point. The hops are the point - and there are plenty in here. Grapefruit, tangerine, and pine dominate from start to finish. Quite fruity, actually. Bitterness lingers and there's alcohol warmth from the mid through the finish. Medium/full bodied with moderate carbonation. Creamy texture. This stuff is great. Too many brewers forget about balance in this style, but Bell's has done a great job here.

Pine-needles! All Pac northwest! One of the best, if not THE best, big-assed citrusy hop beers. Drinkability suffers a little bit, sure, but that's the trade-off for such a massively beautiful rendition of dripping, citrusy and piney hops in a glass.

4.2,-6.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The hop character here is so smooth & even soft (despite being amped up and loud overall); the brewer definitely took a heavy handed approach with smooth fruity hops like Simcoe and Amarillo when brewing this beer. The flavor does not have much, if anything, noticeable of the onion / garlic note that I experienced in the aroma, though perhaps there is a touch of it in the finish. Really the finish is dominated by a smooth, lingering bitterness that perhaps takes on a touch of mentholated pine. I really am a sucker for these smoothly fruity, over the top, one dimensional hop bombs. This is quite bitter, though I don't necessarily realize it most of the time. This is totally only comprises one dimension of the usual three that a beer can have (hop, malt and yeast), but it is so enjoyable in its expression of the hop.","Gueuzedude","Dec 10, 2006"

I would not call it a hop bomb, as the bitterness is not overwhelming, but there is a load of mandarin and grapefruit citrus with just a touch of pine midway. The malt is a subtle sweetness that accentuates the hoppy character. The mouthfeel is light and slightly effervescent. Remarkably, and wonderfully drinakble.

Only a special group of beer enthusiasts can handle it. Lemons, oranges, tangerines, grapefruits, nectarines, even some limes, lets not forget the light floral hint detected from this beer.

This beer is definitely something to be sipped, its too extreme to just quaff one after the other. I really don't think that I could drink a six of this in one sitting, the alcohol is just to upfront. The brew itself is good, but the alcohol ruins it for me.

Aroma is big citrusy hops, grapefruit and a little tropical fruit going on, some sweet pineapple juice. There is also a hint of grainy-grassiness. Taste follows with some sweet pineapple juice flavor up front that blends into some grapefruit bitterness. The bitterness is nice and even graduating into a citrus rind dryness. There is the hint of what could be an alcohol burn, but it never quite gets to a burn, just on the verge, and then warms the throat with the dry finish. Light to medium in body, the malts are plentiful enough to balance the hoppiness and accentuate the citrus and pineapple flavors, but not overpowering to make you think of a dipa-barleywine hybrid. The bitterness is not a huge kick in the teeth but is still large and nice and even from about mid-taste thru the finish. Very good beer easy to drink, deceptively strong.","hoppymeal","Dec 06, 2006"

I've drank this beer every year since it's release every year enjoying it a bit more...sadly I looked back at 2006 and didn't realize how low I had scored it then. Never re-reviewing to realize that I've definitely enjoyed it much more than that as a whole. Brewed 12-29-11 that's as fresh as a six of Hopslam gets, and I've got 3 six packs at about 17 bucks a pop. Appears a slightly hazed golden orange hue with a creamy white thicket of head forming thick with chunks of scattered lacing. Aroma is usually explosive with grapefruit peel in this beer, and it still is with a sugar coated layer of candied hops. So green so fresh with hops, I can't get enough of each smell no real booze coming out in the nose, but there's a deep ridden hop pungency that makes you recognize. Flavor wise this seems to have fermented out a good bit this year not much honey sweetness and the yeast ate the heavenly malts and honey to unleash the devilish ten percent alcohol, which is showing up a bit more than I've realized in the past. No big deal I'm warm in the chest and still enjoying one of the hoppiest beers around, get slammed by the hops. Mouthfeel is slick with hop oils carbonation really wraps itself around the palate, medium bodied flowing down. Overall a once a year beer experience that I won't soon forget, and look forward to every year.","WVbeergeek","Nov 28, 2006"

In the glass though its orange and full of little sediment bits floating around, like dirty pond water (in a good way). Small white head and mena looking lacing. Very inviting. Smells like grapefruit and melons, which reminds me of 3F's Dreadnaught. I am excited, Taste is very bitter on the first sip, in a citrusy kind of way. Alcohol is very had to detect underneath. Flavors of honeydew, grapefruit, hops (wait, no hopsLAM). It's really the grapefruit-iness that stands out. Not too heavy or syrupy, just full bodied and slightly fizzy on the tongue.

All the citric goodness of lemon rind and pink grapefruit pulp along with canabis and smokey pine resin. The taste translates all of that goodness from the nose onto the palate. The bright citric tones of grapefruit and lemon. And smokey, resinous, raw Mary Jane. Bitterness is not clean, but not real abrasive either. Kind of in between. Alcohol is barely noticeable. Body is a little better than medium. Toffeeish malt way in the background, but there nonetheless. A top notch IIPA no doubt. One of the absolute best as a matter of fact.","Bighuge","Nov 25, 2006"

Clarity is fantastic on this brew. This brew glows it is so brilliant. Aroma is thick with sweet grapefruity hop. Very sweet and luscious. The caramel malt underneath is sweet as well, but with a alcohol spiceyness in there that breaks the sweetness of the caramel and hop up. It is very juicy. Taking a sip, I get a combination of grapefruity hop and an alcholol spiceyness. The caramel malt hits after the initial taste as a mild sweetness. It finishes with a pepperyness from the hop, along with a more mild bitterness. I really like the major sweet hop flavors that dominate this one. Mouthfeel is thick, with a mild carbonation as well. It sits strong but is not syrupy or offensive. This one is really working well for me. I enjoy the fact that the hop manifests itself more as flavor than as bitterness. It really is a beer that doesn't need to be sipped, but should be due to the alcohol. I think Bell's has a winner.","kmpitz2","Nov 24, 2006"

You can feel the burn of bitter hops and alcohol all the way down to your gut. Out-f'n-standing beer! To put it into perspective, it reminds me of my unforgettable Pliny experience at Tria in Phlly.

The head is solid and it leaves a lace all over the glass. The range of flavors from the hops is quite extraordinary; ironically the only thing it lacks is extreme bitterness (which I don't seem to miss). Loads of dried fruit, citrus fruit, pine, leather, bug spray, and HOPS. Maybe zeus, tomahawk perhaps? The malts are there but play a minimal role; they kind of taste like light rye malts. The finish is clean, leaving you only with the intense smell of hops up your nose and down your throat; this is a beer that really makes you smell like beer. The way the hop bitterness fades away reminds me of a wet hopped beer. Alcohol is undetectable. This is one beautiful IPA. The burps from this one actually taste better than certain beers I've had! I was surprised to find it's rated at 106 ibu; I would have guessed down in the 70-80 range like Pliny the Elder. This may be the first 100+ ibu beer I really enjoyed.

Decent head that dissipated quickly. I saw that this beer is at 106 IBU's and while I can believe it, it doesn't hit you over the head with hops as much as I expected. It has such a rich and creamy malt profile that it is very well balanced (as opposed to a beer like Hazed and Infused where it is essentially hop juice). Speaking of flavor, there is a lot going on here. I can taste tons of fruit character: pineapple, citrus; along with great hearty breadiness. Hops are majorly present in the taste as well. I suppose that this is worth the 17 dollars a six pack I paid (crazy, eh? but I love that local craft breweries are not afraid to take risks and make beers like this -- thus I must buy them and support the efforts to make American brewing even better).","ahking","Nov 17, 2006"

Very piney but not overly bitter like some DIPA's. The mouthfeel is great it bites at you all the way through. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 for drinkability is the 9% abv.

Smell is grapefruity citrus, huge hoppy punch of hop resins and piney hops, also a big malty sweet backbone holding all of these huge aromas together. This beer is as hoppy as they come. Taste is much more of the same, starts sweet and of caramel maltiness before quickly becoming the grapefruity and citrusy flavors that lead onwards into the hoppy depths of this beast. Gargantuan hoppiness delivered with a bitterness and drying aftertaste to match. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with milder carbonation, slick and viscous brew. Drinkability is outstanding considering the 106 IBU's and 9.3% abv, staggering stats like that would make many beers undrinkable, yet Bell's has made this one enjoyable in a big way. The alcohol is hardly noticeable past the hoppiness, great bittering hop bite. Easily one of the best DIPA's I've ever had the pleasure of drinking.

4.37,-2.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Always look forward to trying a new double IPA, especially when it's from Bell's. This beer poured a cloudy yellow color and formed a foamy white head the coated the glass with lace as it quickly subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, both citrus styles-orange and grapefruit pointing to more hops than the Two Hearted. The flavor was of hops, citrus orange and grapefruit with a hint of caramel. The finish on this beer is a bit astrigent and the hops bitterness figure heavily as well, while adding a slightly creamy body. Similar to other double IPAs, but definately has that Bell style to it. A great beer, but at the alcohol level and price per 6 pack, probably still drink more Two Hearted than this. For these styles, I really wish they would make four paks or use bombers.","Wildman","Nov 03, 2006"
4.27,-4.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"The drinkability is easy for me. I live for a beer like this. A total sensory bludgeoning with precision and complexity. The feeling of well being that has settled upon me is wonderous. This is easily my favorite beer from Bell's. Is this going to be an annual release or a one off? Please, keep it coming! A great celebration ale. Call me immature and unrefined if you wish, but this beer needs to be felt.","SupaCelt","Nov 03, 2006"

4.72,5.4,4,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Drinkability - I never thought I would say this about beer but its almost to hoppy, "almost" is key word. Absolutely overwhelming with the palate coating bitterness, but I still want more.","CRJMellor","Apr 14, 2004"
4.5,0.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Appearance - Similar to Two-Hearted but even cloudier. Rich white head that stay's with the beer throughout, even in the plastic cup they serve 16oz beers in. Aroma - a citrus-y orange-grapefruit. Taste - powerful hop domination bu believe it or not, the malt still weighs in. Creamy on the mouth, and perilously drinkable as the alcohol weighs in after the glass is gone. Has a taste profile similar to DFH 90 min, but has that more citrusy taste, as opposed to DFH's gin-like taste. Great stuff, hope they put this in the bottle for all the hopheads.","beernbbq","Apr 14, 2004"
