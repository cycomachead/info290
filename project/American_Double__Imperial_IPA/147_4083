4.16,-3.3,4,4.25,4.25,4,4,"Poured into a Stone gargoyle pint. Pours a medium golden amber with a nice two finger white head with great retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, orange citrus, lightly floral. Flavor is hop forward with dry, piney and citrus hops, orange citrus, hint of dankness, light carmel malt, finishing with lingering resinous pine and grapefruit rind with hints of lemon and orange citrus. Medium bodied with active carbonation. A nicely made seriously hop forward IPA with a resinous, but not particularly herbal hop bill. The malt body was sufficient to support the intense hops, but was not in itself memorable. A quite enjoyable, well named hop bomb. I will not even try to taste another hoppy beer for a day or so. Life is good right now, though. It's been a while since I've had this, and there is a little sadness that it will be discontinued, but I have faith that Stone will continue to come through with worthy alternatives. RIP Ruination.","LiquidAmber","Saturday at 08:03 PM"

What I had was a bottle dated enjoy by 5/6/15, poured to a snifter. Two finger head that laced beautifully.  IBUs are listed on bottle at 100+ and yeah this is one bitter beer.  Beyond the sharp bitterness I got a lot of that piney flavor, I just had a bunch of Alpha Kings a few months back and this reminded me of a "bigger" version of that beer.  This is a classic but I respect Stone for rethinking some of their beers that have been around for a while that people might be taking for granted.  Hopefully version 2.0 does this one justice.

Definitely a must try for hop heads and, like all Stone beers, its huge hop bitterness is balanced by a letting the malts shine through early and late in the tastes.  Right on - my only complaint is that this could be even more hoppy if it were to live up to its name.  I would compare this to favorably with Six Point's Resin but put it below Green Flash West Coast IPA.  There is something a little commercial to the flavor, too smooth so to speak, that is also present in most Stone beers.  Green Flash seems to pulls better/truer malt flavors than Stone, which is chiefly why I rank that beer higher.","snilsen13","Feb 11, 2015"

I have several of these and most pour amber with a slight haze that grows brilliant as the beer warms. Occasionally I get one that is cloudier but it is still good. The 1" creamy, off-white foam collar produces thick sheets of lace that break into classic gothic cathedral window designs as they dissipate. A rich hop palate with some citrus rind bitterness rides on a solid malt backbone seasoned with yeast driven fruit flavors and a hard to pin down spiciness that give way to long, lingering hop aftertastes. An initial sweetness tempers the hops. Medium body to a little above and medium low carbonation. A true classic.","pat61","Jan 06, 2015"

Beautifully balanced lightly citrus/pine hop aroma with a touch of nice earthiness.  The taste is very well balanced.  Not overly bitter and leaves you wanting another sip. Sip is the keyword as a few of these will really slow you down.  Mouthfeel is beautifully round and balanced.  When I am stacking beers to drink, I always leave this one for last.  It tastes great regardless of what you drank before and after you drink this, other beers are underwhelming.  There are other beers that are more floral in aroma and taste, but none have this balance.  If you like nice top-end DIPAs, this is a must try.  Excellent beer.","KidDoc","Dec 21, 2014"

I can still admit this a well-made beer and more than that, I can tell how it's one of the blueprints for the craft beer craze -- at least half of the DIPAs I've tried taste just like this one","Premo88","Nov 23, 2014"

Yes it is 100 IBU and so what? I had many other high IBU IPAs and believe me that it is a fine art to balance them. This one is not.","Niceroad77","Nov 06, 2014"

4.5,4.7,,,,,,"The beer poured a crystal clear golden amber with a decent white head.  The aroma was of grapefruit and citrus with a hint of tropical fruit and a sweet malt underneath.  The taste is aggressively hop forward and takes your palate on a hop journey from beginning to end.  After you get over the initial hop overload you get loads of citrus and grapefruit rind that peaks with a malt sweetness and ends with an intense pine palate coating.  The Ruination has a nice malty sweetness that helps balance the heavy hops and dry finish.  This is a top tier palate numbing hop bomb of a Double IPA.  Just because its readily available don’t overlook this excellent brew.","brurevu","Oct 29, 2014"

4.71,9.5,3.75,4.5,5,4.5,4.75,"Welcome to Alberta, Stone Brewing Co. And welcome to my belly, Ruination. A pale cloudy peach hue with some fluffy, frothy whitish head that coalesces down into a more manageable and firm puck floating on the top of the aromatic liquid below. Nice lacing on my mason jar style mug. Immense hoppy aroma, full of citrus rind, floral perfume, tropical fruit juice, and pine needles. A subtle sweetness almost like those candy cigarettes. Citric, floral, assertive yet not abrasive, almost cleansing in a way. As for the taste, believe the hype. I do not dole out perfect scores very often; in fact, this might be the first occasion. Basically the Platonic ideal of a DIPA. Comfortably medium-bodied and supremely smooth with gentle carbonation, incredible drinakability for such a big beer. Epic heavy duty marmalade citrus flavors, getting lots of tangerine, grapefruit, and lime, with a little sour lemon and green banana in the finish, along with further pineapple, papaya, and nectarine notes. So much rind and resin yet nothing coarse and astrigent .... Perfect sublime hop balance. Bready honeyed malts also make their presence felt although the citrus fruit keeps wrestling away my attention. Brace yourself for the finish, peppery resins and a huge pine bite, although again, somehow the beers falls just short of too much bitterness, reigning itself back towards a reassuring citrus/tropical vibe that one could exult in for days, liver permitting. Not much more to say ... Essential imbibing for the hop head and even the aspiring hop head ready to learn via experience (alternatively, I am a sadist for recommending a beginner try this ... You be the judge).","CalgaryFMC","Oct 21, 2014"

I wouldn't say it finishes clean since there is a decent amount of hop resin feel on the tongue afterwards, but it finishes so dry I'm ready to take another sip.  I want to pair this with some really flaky fish and a spicy gumbo.","Tuck_leepulin","Sep 10, 2014"

Orange peel bitterness and a tobacco after taste lingers for a while. No alcohol is present. This is a liquid poem to the glory of the hop. There is enough Alpha Acids in this brew to leave me satisfied. This is highly Recomended.","Shroud0fdoom","Sep 02, 2014"

4.5,4.7,,,,,,"Pours a rich golden color, simple at a glance with nice clarity. Soft thin white head blankets the top for a few moments before drifting to the edges and floating on top like a halo. Rope lacing coats my mug 360 degrees. Hops are direct and powerful in this classic styled IPA. Slightly sweet citrus on the finish. A tasty bitterness never leaves the tongue. The feel is bubbly and tingly on the tongue with a more than moderate amount of dryness on the finish. The alcohol is not as pronounced as I expected considering the 8+ abv. Well done on this quality offering from Stone.","orangemoustache","Aug 23, 2014"

The taste was similar with hops being the main focus of the brew with very little else interfering. Clearly a love letter to the flower. The mouthfeel was nice with a strong beginning and becoming refreshingly light in the end. Overall a very good beer with a clear message.","WhiteHillsStore","Aug 12, 2014"

Typically the bottles that sit on the shelves around here are approaching/past their expiration dates. I jumped at the chance to get a growler filled. This is a beer that others in the style should be measured against. Great hop presence, but not overpowering. Although the aroma is the highlight, all of the other aspects are well above par. This will continue to be one of my go-to IPAs, when I can find it on draft or fresh in the bottle.","NoLeafClover44","Jul 19, 2014"

4.54,5.6,3,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,"Bottle. Extremely clear. Lots of lacing on the glass. First taste is like a normal extra IPA. As soon as it gets to the back of the mouth, it turns super bitter. It's like biting into a lime or grapefruit rind. The super-bitterness comes only after the swallow. No hint of the near 8% alcohol. Amazingly smooth. Extremely crisp, extremely hoppy ale. It's worth the $8 for the 22oz bottle. But only once. I had to taste this beer and it was worth the price. You will buy this once, but if you like this beer, you will settle for the SN Torpedo or the Founders Centennial IPA. The 100+ IBUs don't show up until after you swallow. Crisp, clean, bitter. Excellent beer. Just didn't live up to the hype. Close, but not quite.","SpenCycle","May 16, 2014"

The aroma is subtle, but definitely hints at the hop bomb that will assault the tongue. Lots of sweet tropical fruit and bitter, pithy grapefruit dominate with hints of other citrus and a hint of caramel. On the taste, there is a burst of sweetness followed by a wave of astringent bitterness. Ruination is aptly named, yet quite balanced thanks to the strong malt backbone.

The nose is full of citrus and other fruit: a big orange aroma, grapefruit, lemon, pear, pine needle, subtle black pepper, and a malt characteristic of biscuit and caramel. At the front of the tongue I get a nicely balanced grapefruit and biscuit malt taste, then this thing explodes into a resinous, earthy, dank assault on the palate. There's bitter herbal and pine notes on the end, which are cut by sweet caramely malt. Yes, it's an extremely hoppy beer, but it has plenty of balancing elements.

Nice nose of citrus and pine hops against a toast and caramel sweet background. Light body with a smooth texture. Just enough carbonation to give a light effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is pretty much one dimensional - hop flavor (grapefruit over pine) flows to a prominent hop bitterness which resembles grapefruit rind. The malt is present, but only in a slight background fashion. The finish is all bitterness, but with a focus on the pine hop aspects.","tillmac62","Mar 11, 2014"

The aroma is just what it's namesake implies. ..ruining. it is super bitter with loads of citrus and pine hops. There is a slight malt backbone but it is subtle at best. The mouthfeel is traditional dipa, medium bodied and mouth coating. The flavor is everything the name and nose promises, nothing but palate numbing hoppy bitterness. Like being socked in the tongue by a lemon, a grapefruit, and a bag of pine needles. This beer is not well balanced nor well crafted, but it us exactly what it vows to be; an utterly mouth destroying, taste bud ruining hop bomb of an ale(imagine a less fresh version of Hopslam). This is by no means my favorite dipa or my favorite Stone offering or even something that I'd frequently return to, but it is exactly what it is meant to be. All others will effectively be ruined for the night following this. Not great but exactly what its meant to be...and then some.","lochef81","Mar 10, 2014"

It dissipates over a few minutes, but leaves patches of bubbles scattered across the surface and wet heaps of lacing along the glass. The aroma is of citrus, stone fruits, and wet earth. Lots of earthen hops, pine resin, grass, and a bit of dank must. It tastes of bitter, earthy hops with a bit of spice. Loads of orange and grapefruit citrus up front with a hint of lemon towards the rear. All pine, grass, and bitter herbs in the middle. Mouthfeel is wet, lively and bitter. A bit resinous on the finish, but it cleans up quickly. Overall, this is a great DIPA that is - in true Stone fashion - aggressive with the hops in an entirely pleasant way.","eclipse54","Feb 12, 2014"

I wish the bitter-to-citrus transition was more smooth. But it works with the "one-two punch" style. The cheddar funk makes me want to pair Ruination with a cheese plate. If you're not a craft drinker this will give you a sour face, (maybe even craft drinkers). This is not a gateway beer. I stress this because we may lose potential craft newbies if we beer advocates don't give them say a regular Stone IPA as liquid training wheels. Great beer for those who like bitter yet citrusy flavors combined with a "can't put my finger, nose and tongue on this funk" taste.","shacawgo24","Jan 04, 2014"

Huge grapefruit flavors in the mouth; sweet fruit and pith bitterness. Pithy bitterness lasts into a sweet, marzipan flavor, ending on a very bittersweet note. Mouthfeel is thin and highly carbonated. Extremely aggressive and typical of Stone. Not my favorite IPA but it gets the job done right.","Aaron_Ramson","Dec 30, 2013"

I had this straight from the bottle and I must admit, I found it very overwhelming. There was way too much too much happening at times, it felt as if someone was pouring cigarette buds on my tongue, then like I was walking through a tree lot, to you name it. However, when I poured this into a tulip glass, I got the full aromas, the head retention, and this beer definitely transformed like a Cinderella story. The only thing missing is that resin; that beautiful resin that us hopheads have come to know. This is the only thing missing to me. I wish Stone offered Ruinten year-round along with this. Ruinten, is the complete version of this, a great fusion of an Enjoy By with Ruination characteristics. This is a great start, get through this, and you are ready for the DIPA world.","santomark","Dec 25, 2013"

Not much of a head but a nice copper color with good clarity. Citrusy hops, orange on the nose, resinous and hoppy with some distinct sweetness from the pale and carmel malts. Smells great! The taste is quite hoppy all around but very good. A generous amount of bitering hops on the start, this is cut by the sweetness of the malts as the sugars and alcohol coats the tongue mid palate and ends with another hoppy bite of bitterness. Not exactly a session beer but absolutely delicious especially if you like a nice hoppy brews. I certainly like my brews nice and hoppy so this is hitting the spot.","CA_brewster","Dec 17, 2013"

Sort of the opposite approach to IPA as Hill Farmstead. Aggressively bitter to near abrasive rather than quenching and soft.","tarheels86","Sep 30, 2013"

3.79,-11.9,4,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and an above average example to the style, the hops were highlighted just like they should be and the hop profile was nice, but it didn't come together as great as some of the better beers of the style. This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth and the flavors did a decent job at holding my attention, I could drink two of these but I'm not sure that taste would make me want to have another one in a row. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, I thought they were both pretty good and they worked well with this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the onion and garlic like hop profile, I don't mind a little bit of it in my DIPA's but it seems just a little too heavy handed in this beer. I would buy this beer again, and I will be on the look out for a fresh bottle to compare this to and so I can update this review. I would recommend this to any DIPA fan. All in all I liked this beer, but I wasn't crazy about it, it had most of the aspects that I look for in the style, but it was still just a little rough around the edges and I think that prevented it from being as good as it could. Stone is one solid brewery and this beer is a good example of that, keep being yourself Stone.","StoutHunter","Sep 05, 2013"

With a standard pour, I yielded a very decent 1-1/2 fingers of head, which was just orange of white and a diluted amber color. The head quickly gave until it was about 1/2 a finger thick and left slight lacing, but nothing to write home about. The head stayed until the end, it should be said. Flavor follows the nose, and just as I thought it would, Ruination proceeds to wreck the palate at first sip. It's very bright, and makes it hard to pick out the flavors and components once you've begun. Some would say it grabs your attention, I prefer to say it kills any possibility of enjoying other beers after this one (at least in the same evening). Make sure to seek this out.","H0pHead420","Aug 28, 2013"

Smell must have been pretty much the same too (Ruination does have a hint of garlic, maybe not as much since I didn't notice it until smelling it again). Taste also is the same, just a little stronger overall with RuinTen. Mouthfeel - RuinTen was definitely stronger in hoppiness and alcohol content. Overall - I'd say considering ABV the beers are almost exactly equal. If you're looking for a little more bang for your buck in ABV then grab the RuinTen if it's available. Taste is very similar - RuinTen is just the amped up version.","ISmith87","Aug 11, 2013"

Smell is a nice blend of piney hops and juicy citrus flavors. Some alcohol peeks though the hops, and only a small hint of malt makes the journey. Taste is spicy bitter piney hops right off the bat, smoothing into some softer citrus flavors and crackery malt with some leftover hop resin flavors blend with the well-hidden alcohol. I still consider myself a hophead, but lately I've moved away from beers like this. Overall though, it's an amazing beer regardless; right on the line between a crazy IPA and a tamer DIPA. Great hop character, I just wish it was a bit more balanced. But it never claimed it was balanced, so it achieves what it sets out to do.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Jul 25, 2013"

A slight aftertaste is all that kept me from ranking it a full 5 in taste. Don't take that wrong, though. This is one of the best IPAs I've had, and it was well worth the hefty price of admission (case was almost $70 with tax).","Murphey","Jul 10, 2013"
3.5,-18.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Not as flavorful as the nose implies it's gonna be but definitely a smooth beer. Pungent hop resin bitterness up front. Tropical fruit flavors but no sweetness. Bitter throughout but not overly so. Malt flavor detected but again, adds no sweetness, just seems to mild down the bitterness. Some burnt toast crusts with raw hoppy leaf flavor and tropical fruit. Bit of detectable alcohol. A really nice drinking beer for those that do truly love the flavor and bitterness of hops. Again, not overly bitter but bitterness persists in a really nice way. A little rough around the edges, a little simple, and a little too much detectable alcohol for the abv but definitely for those who love the hop.","jtierney89","Jul 10, 2013"

This is very floral and citrusy as I remember it, but I forgot how easy it is to drink compared to other readily available DIPAs. The hops are strong but by no means assault the palate, as the malts hold the fort with juiciness, and it is only semi-dry in feel, as well as not being as alcoholic as others in the style. I should be kicking myself in the face for not buying more single bottles of this in the past. At $3, this is a bargain indeed. Excellent stuff.","magictacosinus","Jun 27, 2013"

As hopped out as it is, it still maintains a strict sense of balance with the malt profile. However, this huge malt bill doesn't tip the scales in the body of the beer. It's medium bodied and (somewhat) refreshing on the palate. Deliciously complex beyond the bitterness, this beer is amazing.","McStagger","Jun 16, 2013"

Delectable hops nose with a good bitterness up front. Fruits are tropical, piney. Sticky lacing and good malt underneath. Finely carbonated and a medium light body. Lots of oily bitterness and a strong finish. This beer bombs your taste buds and that’s no lie. Pair it with subtly sweet foods because it’s superbly bitter.","utopiajane","Jun 11, 2013"

As it is, it's a beautiful, extremely bitter beer, somewhat limited in flavor profile (one obvious hop profile for me, one subdued caramel malt profile).","Roguer","May 24, 2013"

It pours a hazy amber-yellow with a white head about a finger thick that slowly fades to a thin lacing. The smell is straight up piney goodness with hints of grapefruit and citrus. The taste is pallet crushingly bitter. But its more then that, there is a complexity you wouldn't think you would get from a hop bomb. Grapefruit is the predominate flavor with subtle malty notes still not lost amongst the hops. The mouthfeel is medium and approachable with a dry finish. Too often DIPAs are sweet and sticky.

At the same time, Ruination has something about it that isn't quite like other DIPAs out there, so I'd definitely recommend trying it. Excellent beer, and the high ratings are justified, I think.","Alextricity","May 02, 2013"

Head as thick as 270 traffic at rush hour. I practically stubbed my index finger taking a closer, textural observation. The nose, which has been begging for attention from the moment the cap came off, now receives its due. Intense florals and bitter citrus. Stubborn, but not obnoxious, carbonation envelops the mouth chamber. Taste confirms what the nose foretold. HOP to it now, o my tongue. The bitterness is modulating between different flavors in an amazing way. First sip lingered for nearly a minute. "A severe state of damage" indeed. Hop-based wrecking ball.","Rast","Mar 23, 2013"

4.51,4.9,4,4.75,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Ruination by Stone Brewing Company pours a cloudy, orange color with a thin cream colored head. Citrus, piney, and floral hop notes create a wonderful bouquet for the senses. Slighty toasted bread flavors quickly yield on the palate for some serious hop bitterness. The onslaught of grapefruit and pineapple citrus, gooey pine resin, and grassy earthiness are quite welcomed as they are delicately balanced with the sweetness of the malt. Medium in both body and carbonation, Ruination comes out incredibly well-balanced.","phishsihq","Mar 09, 2013"

The woody smoothness of single-malt liquor. Brown sugar. Lingering OJ. Perfume of the gods. I could go on for hours.

Smells like pine, citrus and...roses (first sniff only). This may be may favorite IPA to date. Wonderfully dry and bitter hop and citrus flavor, backed by a surprisingly solid malty backbone.

Pours crystal clear golden amber color with a 2 finger dense off white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, lemon zest, pine, floral, honey, bread, grass, and herbal earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of hop notes. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, pine, floral, grass, light honey, lemon zest, and piney spiciness. Large amount of floral pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus rind, pine resin, floral, grass, honey, bread, and piney spiciness on the finish for a while. Excellent flavor balance of citrus hop complexity and pine flavors; with big piney citrus bitterness lingering on the finish for a while as expected. Medium carbonation and body; with an extremely sticky, crisp, and slightly creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Imperial IPA. Great intense hop flavor and balance with good complexity; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 30, 2013"

The look of the beer is great with a amber golden color, a little cloudy, and some light lacing. The mouth feel is dry and it has great carbonation. Overall another great stone ipa. In other news i have read some low reviews on this beer that say i don't really like the style ipa...my question is why keep reviewing ipas....your super low reviews just hurt the rating.... does not make sense.. if you don't like curtain styles don't drink or review them... ok i am done with my rant...","KingEdward","Jan 27, 2013"

The nose is a powerful pleasing citrus, pine, floral, and malt. Taste is heavenly. It starts out sweet and malty with some notes of apple and of source the grapefruit. It gives way to a wonderful hop bitterness that seems to be just about right. Mouthfeel is very full and satisfying. This is one of the better DIPAs that I've had.

Taste is not as bold as 100 IBU would convey, it's actually tamer than many New Belgium brews (such as Snow Day or Red Hoptober - two brews I use as benchmarks for IBUs) even though the NB offerings are much lower on the IBU scale. The grainy malt flavor doesn't fight the hops as much as balance them. The wonderfully bitter hops come in at the finish and beg me to drink more as if to even things out. Banana esters and mango dance on the middle of the tongue as I take a second sip. Mouthfeel is thick and wonderful, allowing the luscious fruity and grainy flavors to mingle and tantalize the senses. I believe this hop bomb is one of the top IPAs available and will definitely drink again.","dsmcva00","Jan 05, 2013"

4.47,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Taste: This boasts 100 IBUs, but this isn't so much an indication of ironclad bitterness as much as it is a dynamic, multi-faceted flavor. First thing that hits me is the aforementioned floral lemon zest, which is quickly usurped by a strong amalgamation of piney hops. Perhaps the best thing about this is the biting blast that hits the tongue immediately (it makes its way up to the base of the nose too; potent shit) and allows a slightly waxy mouthfeel to usher in the surge of flavors described above. Each sip brings something new to the table, this stuff is top-notch.","Tomhet","Jan 04, 2013"

4,-7,4,4,4,4,4,"this is a good imperial ipa, but i think i like the regular stone ipa better. this one pours a mostly clear honey color, a tint of orange to it, and quite a nice sudsy head. the nose is all lupulin, hop essence, and a touch of fruit, maybe apples or something to this in smell only. flavor carries the big bold hop nose, but it also has a nice medium malt body underneath it. possible wheat additions become curious towards the finish, but this is a hop bomb all the way. it tastes fresh, almost as fresh as the enjoy by, but it lacks a real hop identity i think, i dont know which hops are used, but i know its not quite bitter, its not quite sweet, its just sort of hoppy, if that makes sense. good carbonation, sessionably smooth, lots of alcohol but it can hardly be tasted. overall an outstanding version of the style, but i think a more distinct hop varietal would really pop this beer off.","StonedTrippin","Nov 16, 2012"

A lovely range of aroma hop flavours that blend together perfectly. The bitterness is powerful but never seems over the top, while the malt provides just enough sweetness to keep this brew from seeming one-dimensional. Ruination is a well-deserved title; it towers over many other IPAs. Superb - add this to your must-try list.","jazzyjeff13","Oct 06, 2012"

I recently had the Stone 16th Anniversary IPA, and it was lemon, lemon, lemon, and more lemon. That one was a one time release, and fortunately the Ruination is much more balanced. Not too much pine in this one, very drinkable. For the money, I would probably just get the regular Stone IPA. Have I been ruined for other IPAs?

There might not be a better description than that as Stone's Ruination will knock you on your arse with with overblown hops and it won't quit until the very last drop. This beer is certainly not for everyone, as it will gladly blow the doors off your palate making other beers you try in a short timespan to seem utterly lifeless. That being said if hops are your thing this is one of the very best. The appearance was lackluster but everything else beats you into submission with relentless taste nose and feel. I have had ruination many times before and will many times again. It also serves as a great introductory lesson into the field of imperial IPA.","RussBecker1","Sep 02, 2012"

One thing I really appreciate about it is that it keeps the alcohol levels in check and avoids the "syrup curse" that overly hot, sweet, Imperial IPAs exhibit; these bad apples resemble American barleywines in their flavor more than IPAs. Ruination, on the other hand, is beautifully hopped, highly bitter, and pleasingly dry. She's a beauty.","hagbergl","Aug 07, 2012"

Scent is full of hops mices with some citrus. Mmmm holy hops Batman. The taste is loaded with smooth, crisp hops that gang-bang your taste buds. Texture is smooth and refreshing. Slight dry, chalky finish. Really lives up to its name!","Lemke10","Aug 02, 2012"

Lacing is thick and peaked like a mountain range. The smell is a stupendous kerpow of hops; very piney with slight hints of citrus and not a lot else. The pine hops are very much the dominator in the smell. There might be a slight sweet malt at the end of the smell, but that might just be me stretching to smell. This is just a big bitter punch in the face. This beer is just pine hops blasting over your tongue, but they are great. After taste is like a pine forest bristling in the wind. There is, again, an ever so slight taste of sweet maltiness to it. Mouthfeel is very crisp and smooth. Carbonation doesn’t seem to touch the tongue much but the bitterness of the hops is very present on the tongue, and the top of the tongue is left rather dry, but still sticky on the sides with saliva. The overall after-feel in the mouth is bitter. This is a beer that demonstrates the bitters, but not much else. The bottle claims to have great subtle tastes of yeast and malts, but I would say that the real strength and the only true flavor is in the deep piney hops. I don’t know if I would have this one again. I love a good IPA and a good bitter taste but this just seems to be straight pine and nothing else. It’s a great example of the pine flavor but I don’t know how much of the pine flavor I would personally like to drink. The beer is similar to Longhammer IPA by Redhook Brewery, only with more hops and bite and a better smell.","Maxwell","Jun 30, 2012"

The head dissipates very slowly, leaving lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma is of citrus and resinous pine. The malt also comes through in the aroma. This is such a hop forward smell. The hop forward nose gives way towards a very hop forward taste. The big piney hops lead into the citrus and sweet malt tastes. The hops are lovely and this beer is well balanced. The body is medium to full with adequate carbonation. The beer is sticky in the mouth. The drinkability is high. This is a well-balanced beer that definitely fits the world class label.

Pours a slightly hazy orange color with two fingers of white, frothy head. The head lingers for eons and leaves beautiful lacing on the glass like strings of cob web. The aroma is all hops, sticky with citrus grapefruit and resin. Hiding in the nose is a waft of honey sweetness. The first taste is a blossom of pure hops; the heavy flavor is all citrus hops with a backbone of pine. It blends beautifully into that promise of honeysuckle like sweetness I found on the nose. The sweetness on the back end coupled with the unapologetic hop smack in the mouth makes this THE IPA against which I compare all others. This is the beer that turned me into a beer geek. Other IPAs are guilty of just loading you with hops for hops sake, but this beer uses them the way they are meant to be used. Cheers to the guys and gals at Stone for brewing such a gem.","estlinska","Jun 18, 2012"

Ruination is still a decent beer, but loses much more than it gains. The brewer's intent being a hop-slap to the face, that's perfectly reasonable, but drink it when you buy it.","Lawl3ss","Jun 16, 2012"
4.81,11.9,3.5,5,5,5,4.5,"OK. I'm not a real hophead. I used to be an anti-hops guy until I was turned on to Double IPA's that offset the bitterness with citrus juice. I mainly drink IPA's made here in Vermont that tend t be on the citrusy side (Heady, Hill Farmstead and Lawsons). I actually went to the liquor store to get some Lawson's Double Sunshine and they were out. Figured I'd give this a try. Wow!. Super hoppy but balanced so nicely that I wasn't overwhelmed. Great head and carbonation level. A little clearer appearance than I like but no big deal. The key word here is balance. If I could change one thing it would be the super strong hop flower aftertaste, but I realize this beer is made for the fullblown hophead and will rate accordingly. This one is a masterpiece if a guy like me who isn't in love with hops can love such a hoppy ale. Well done Stone.","celfan","Jun 16, 2012"

The thick foam slowly reduces to a soapy cap that leaves sticky lacings on the glass. Pungent citrus orange and grapefruit hop aromas with pine hops and sweet sticky malt underneath. Smooth oily feel that rides over the rich lazy carbonation beneath. Fairly balanced citrus hop and caramel flavor up front. Pungent orange and grapefruit hop flavors intensify into the middle that slowly transition to bitter pine hop flavors at the end. Finishes semi-dry with a bready/malty aftertaste at first that slowly gives way to a long lasting bitter pine hoppiness.","IronLover","Jun 05, 2012"

The flavor is very bitter with the same citrus, earhty hop flavor as detected in the nose. "Ruinous effect on the palette" according to the bottle is right. Dominates. Sweet caramel malt base but not even close to the hop bitterness and flavor. A hint of the alcohol warmth. Full bodied and well carbonated.

The aroma is all out hops; citrus, pine and grass all come through. The flavor is very hop forward. You get a big blast of hops from the start, and the Ruination has quite a bit of bitterness to it. As you become accustomed to the hops (about half way through a glass), the malt starts to make its presence known. This is a signature big IPA, so if you like IPA’s the Ruination is not to be missed. If you are not an IPA fan, this is not the place to start.","iSip","Mar 07, 2012"

Smell is extremely hoppy with an emphasis on herbal and citrus zest aromas. Taste is of citrus zest, grapefruit, herbal hops, and some slight honey flavors. There is a medium amount of bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a nice crisp level of carbonation with a prickly mouthfeel.

Finishes with bitterness as well, with some sweet malts in the middle, and citrus aftertaste that just lingers on the palate. I had this right after Founders Centennial and it blew it away. Big resinous mouthfeel, plenty of carbonation, with a slightly dry finish. Good stuff, and rather unique (but not as unique as RuinTen--that one is in its own category).","BMMillsy","Feb 15, 2012"

I would maybe like to see a little bit more malt aroma and taste to add more balance, but I understand that Stone's intention was to overload it with hops. The alcohol is not very noticeable for a beer that is nearly 8% ABV, but once you get to the bottom of your glass, you know it's there. If you're into double/imperial IPAs, I highly recommend this one.","BlackBelt5112203","Feb 13, 2012"

I like IPA's, but this one is a little too aggressively hopped for me. I know plenty of fellas, and it looks like plenty of BA's, who love it and would drink it every day, but not me. But that doesn't mean it isn't good! Because it is! But it is not a neophyte's beer, or someone just getting into the craft scene. It is quite potent, strongly hopped. To use boxing as a comparison, it's like a charger or inside fighter, vis a vis Mickey Ward. This thing will keep coming at you, you can't duck it or dodge it, the only way around it is to just man up and face the punishment!","TheCondor","Feb 03, 2012"

It is a very good beer, but it has everything that anyone could want in an IPA, not a DIPA. It is nearly perfect in terms of all the characteristics of a single IPA (it tastes just like Ballast Point's Sculpin IPA to me) and if it were, I would probably give it a perfect score. The bottle says "IPA" and the alcohol percentage as well as everything else about this beer screams IPA, but I'll trust BeerAdvocate's classification as a DIPA and rate it as such. When I purchase a DIPA, I want to be blown away by the hops.","BeerMaverick","Jan 29, 2012"

Can smell the citrus which makes for a nice ipa. Has a pretty strong hop bitterness that I really like, yet it doesn't overwhelm the citrus flavor that I really love. I rank Ruination up there with the finest ipa's on the market. With 7.7 abv, this is a big league ipa with a big league taste.

Golden blonde color (standard ipa look) The smell is a strong but balanced floral. The taste is exactly what I would expect from Stone. A strong overwhelmingly flavorful beer. This is not an IPA I would suggest starting out on, this is a very full flavored, bitter beer and would most likely be to much to handle for anyone that is just starting to drink craft beer. However if you've had an IPA or two and know what your getting into, you might want to drink with caution, you will never want another IPA.","rogueleonardi","Jan 04, 2012"

3.35,-22.1,4.5,4.5,2.5,3,3.5,"O: Overall the beer is alright, but I wanted more hop flavor out of this. I can't call it average because it's better than some of the other average IIPA's I've had, but it also strongly lacks the flavor of many others. It's hard to call this one, because a bottle can lose a lot of flavor based on how long it's been shelved. I bet this is a lot better on tap. I would drink it again, but only if I could figure out how to verify the date, and only to re-review the beer. As it stands right now, I wouldn't pick this up if I had a chance to buy an IIPA from another brewery.","teromous","Dec 30, 2011"

Smell makes your mouth water. Flavor is hoppy with a fruity aftertaste; very refreshing. Not an overally bitter IPA, but very drinkable and lots of flavor. Very drinkable and very good!","iabeerbaron","Dec 04, 2011"

With 100+ IBU's it absolutely ruins your taste buds, but it a good way. This is the first American double I've had and will be the benchmark for all others after this.

The smell is nice and earthy of hops and some citrus. The taste is very hopy, very nice bit with some citrus. I get a little bit of malt to. The mouth feel is very smooth and rolls off the tongue real nice. Overall this is a great beer.","chefhatt","Nov 28, 2011"

Very bright citrus hop aroma with a touch of pine. Very vibrant aroma. The taste is just like the smell. Nice malt sweetness with a large over the top citrus hop flavor. Not as bitter as expected, but this ale really packs in the hop flavor. Citrus, candied grapefruit, and lemony tastes all backed by just a touch of malt sweetness. This beer goes down very smooth. Good carbonation, medium bodied feel. Overall this beer is pretty stunning. Crazy amount of hop flavor in this one keeping you coming back for more.","ShemRahBoo","Nov 17, 2011"

Very nice and kind of unique as hoppy brews go. The flavor brings lots more hops in the form of sweet bready herbal grass goodness. There’s wheat and sort of peachy fruit nougat. Delicious in a medium plus body with a polite carbonation and an easy, lightly frothy feel. A class hop brew!","Durge","Nov 13, 2011"

4.03,-6.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"I know this bottle was at least around three months old, and thought this was easily the best DIPA I've had yet. It was hop-forward, but not to the point of it being caustic. The ethanol, while "getting up there" in percent, was not detectable and attempting to beat the drinker into submission. Not ruinous, but actually rather pleasant; still wouldn't want to drink any other beer after this, though. In all, would like to try this much fresher and see how it turns out.","falloutsnow","Nov 13, 2011"
4.09,-4.9,4.5,3,4.5,4,4.5,"O: A very pleasant beer overall. I could be I had a really good bottle of their regular IPA but this wasn’t as good as I remember the regular IPA being.","minterro","Nov 12, 2011"
4.74,10.2,4,5,5,4,4.5,"The smell is perfect. Its like walking through an evergreen forest with orange and lime trees scattered throughout. It just screams out hops. And as you would expect from such a strong smelling beer, the taste is something to behold as well. Its by far the most bitter, hoppy beer I've ever had. It isn't well balanced at all, but I don't think that was the point of this one. It shocks you into submission (and your stomach will not be happy). Its a very dry beer and well carbonated. Overall, it isn't perfect, but it's pretty damn close.","Intrinsic","Nov 09, 2011"
4.1,-4.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"The Accidental Highway to Hell Tour motors forth! This stop pours a clear light amber topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises lime, light lemon zest, light orange zest, caramel, and pine resin. The taste holds notes of caramel, pine, very light lime, black pepper, lemon zest, light pineapple, and balsa. The body is on the heftier end of the light medium spectrum, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish. Overall, this is one beastly DIPA, one that wrecks the tongue with its massive hop concentration but still goes down eerily easily. Good times.","TMoney2591","Nov 08, 2011"

3.94,-8.4,3,4,4,4,4,"My concluding thoughts on this beer, are if you like hops, you will love this beer, if malty styles are your go to, or if you are into more balanced styles, this may not be for you. I always try to indicate whether or not a beer may be good for sessioning, and due to the alcohol content I cannot in good conscious recommend it, but it doesn't stop me.","bornridiculous","Nov 04, 2011"
3.87,-10,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"O: overall, I was kind of disappointed. I know it's a huge hop bomb, and I love that, but I'd like to see a bigger malt backbone. At 7.7% and this mouthfeel, it could easily be called an IPA, not a DIPA. Compare this head to head with the likes of Sculpin and it loses. Compare it with DIPAs like Pliny the Elder, Hopslam, and Double Crooked Tree, and it's not even close. Maybe I got an old batch, so I'll review again if I see something different in it. Overall, solid beer, but not one of the top in the category.","Holland","Nov 04, 2011"

I love how both the piney/bitter and tropical/sweet hop characteristics are displayed and the balance achieved in this beer. It doesn't strip the enamel off of your teeth with explosive bitterness, but it does do well at giving me my hop fix. I'd take another one and six more after.","ludachris","Nov 02, 2011"
3.41,-20.7,4.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,"O-I try to be objective as possible, but honestly for this beer, one time is enough for me. I don't like the piney hoppy taste. Seems to be a popular thing in the USA but I'm just not catching on. One thing I can say is though is that this is probably the most drinkable IPA that I have ever drank. The balance was there and the other flavors made it quite refreshing. The alcohol was something I never noticed so the ABV is deceiving. Amongst the hopheads, I can understand why this beer is loved. Just not for me.","derbierTeufel","Nov 01, 2011"
4.88,13.5,5,4.5,5,5,5,"Is this the perfect beer? It is phenomenal from the nice light orange color to the wonderful citrus aroma, and finally to the outstanding smooth balance and extra dry finish in the taste. I would say the best part is the extra dry finish followed by a great cheek pucker - delicious! The hops are overwhelmingly tasty and abundant - grapefruit and citrus - but somehow the taste remains smooth. This is a truly outstanding IPA.","ccory1971","Oct 31, 2011"
4.44,3.3,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a nice golden copper, with a frothy tight bubbled 1 finger head that slimes all around the glass. WOW, this is huge. Big meaty grapefruit/mango hops, citrus explosion on my nose, big piny/earthy hop finish, with a faint scent of caramel malt and a little alcohol to help open the nostrils. One of the best tasting IPA's around, the citrus hops meld so well with the malts, a distinct mango flavor, juicy, juicy hops, with a nice malt backbone that doesn't try to steal the show. Medium on the body, smooth creamy, dry and delicious. Ya this is a good beer, this beer is a fantastic DIPA that i strongly recommend.","gabedivision","Oct 28, 2011"

4.24,-1.4,4,5,4,4,4,"Malts are kept light but are still noticeable, biscuity and lightly toasted with almost an earthy English graininess. Hop flavor and bittering are both huge; the bitterness lingers on the palate forever. Hop flavors range from pithy orange peels to lemon flesh to bubblegum weed and even range into the minty realm now and again. Big flavors here, I think this could actually benefit from some more alcohol to throw out and accent some tropical flavors in the beer. Bitterness is a bit too over the top for me, I wouldnt mind a brighter hop flavor with a tad less bitterness. Still though, minor complaints here and I think this is an excellent DIPA and one of the fore-runners of the style, Stone should most certainly be commended for that.","twiggamortis420","Oct 22, 2011"

It has the Stone taste with incredible hoppiness. It is right up there with some of the other crazy hopped San Diego IPAs that I drink a lot in this wonderful beer city. I wish I had the ability to describe all the nuanced flavors better. I like these beers because they turn out to be great sipping beers. You really have to like hops to get through one of these though. If you do appreciate hops, you will like this beer, along with the other crazy hopped west coast IPAs. When you spend time with them, you find they have a lot of nuance to them beyond the crazy hops. That is nice. The one thing I don’t like about the Ruination IPA is the aftertaste. It really lingers on the roof of my mouth in a bitter way. I suppose it is just ruining my palate.","BJA","Aug 26, 2011"

4.88,13.5,5,4.5,5,5,5,"This beer is exemplary in every facet of my experience. In fact, I sit here and crave simply thinking about pouring this beer. I poured the beer from a 22oz. bomber bottle into a chilled glass mug. It was like taking it straight from the tap; which happens less often, in my opinion, when pouring from a bottle. It had a kick-ass head that left an intense lacing down the glass and would sustain longer than the life of most beers I’ve ever had. It was a very frothy head (my favorite) that took on a vivid orange hue. I took one smell of it and I thought to myself, “HOPS!” To complement the hops, there were some very citrusy smells to it. At times it I caught hints of a premium tobacco shop. It was intensely aromatic. The taste is a medium body with am almost silky feel in the mouth. The malt seems to complement the hops very well, as it is a very soft malt roast. The third character are the rest of the undertones of piney, citrusy, and woodsy flavors. The alcoholic esters add to the flavor some real pungency. It finishes dry. Overall, this is one of my favorite IPAs (top 10 or so). Its a special beer. Whenever I have the money, I will get this again. Hopefully, I find it on tap in the city (Saint Louis).","paxchristi","Aug 13, 2011"

The beer was beautiful in the glass with carbonation vigorously dancing throughout the body the entire drink and awesome retention of a 1 finger head. Both the nose and taste were a bitterness formed through citrus rind and herbal hop character, on top of a pineapple dominant tropical fruit shaved ice flavor. It drank beautifully at all temperatures with an enormously crisp mouthfeel and plenty of nicely incorporated carbonation. Wonderful hop bomb that never became medicinal or chemical in nature. Great beer from stone for sure.","Klym","Aug 11, 2011"

An aroma of hops, citrus and some floral aspects. The flavor is of hops and citrus with a slight hint of herb. The finish is light and just a touch bitter and extremely astrigent.

Simple, straightforward, delivers one thing (powerful straightforward bitter) with exquisite speed, gusto, and showmanship. But just as a muscle car is not good for complicated cornering or subtlety, this beer is not the best for drinkers seeking an IPA with malt balance against the bitterness, or a subtle display of multiple aspects of flavor profiles that different kinds of hops can create working together in tandem harmoniously.

The taste of this beer is loaded with monster hop flavors. The mouthfeel is a bit oily and even a bit heavy. Overall as much as I like this IPA, I feel there are much better choices out there.

Lots of juicy grapefruit/pine flavour with a bit of bready malt backbone. Long-lasting citrus rind aftertaste. Medium bodied, a touch slick/oily.

I doubt wheat was used in this brew; the sweet, and delicately raw qualities of wheat seemed absent. The beer is actually balanced pretty well. The medium body could have used a viscosity boost, and I’d preferred a bit more sweetness, especially in the swallow, but it was pretty good.

Pours a bright, clear golden-orange color with a small white head that disappears quickly. Scent is VERY hop forward. Lots of citrus aromas and hop aromas, mixed with very little malt and a ton of pine. Taste is initially citrus fruit, followed very closely by strong hop oil and intense bitterness. There is hardly any malt, which is what makes for a great west-coast IPA. There are some bread flavors as well. Tons of pine sap and just bitterness throughout each sip. Very intense IBUs here. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and a little sticky. Crisp finish. Drinkability is high.

If there is anything else added to the beer it cannot be tasted due to the overpowering plethora of hops. I think a delicious IPA needs to have that bold hopiness added with a nice balance.

I don't think I caught much malt in there, but I could care less considering the full scale hop assault in my mouth. Mouthfeel is decent, usually if I don't really notice the mouthfeel, it means it's just right. Overall, if you love IPAs and feel like getting punched in the mouth with a fistful of hops, this is a beer for you.","gkunkle","Apr 11, 2011"
4,-7,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a beautiful golden color, looks like an IPA should look, very summer like. It's pretty cloudy, there is almost no visibility through the beer at all. The head looks really nice, it's very creamy looking, lots of small bubbles. I want to give this a 4.5 on appearance, but the head already faded a little bit, it's sticking around at about a half finger length. It for sure smells like a double IPA, the hops just punish you up front on the nose, and then there is a nice citrus smell, maybe some tangy fruit in here as well, but I'm not the best at detecting fruit in IPA'S so I'm not sure. Overall the smell is really really good, it doesn't seem like it's skimping out at all on the taste, which I'm sadly finding more and more common these days in IPA'S. Well the first thing I notice on the taste is that there is no hop crispness, this beer is not crisp at all, which is very disappointing. I mean you can tell the hops are there because of the bitterness, but there is no crispness, which is very strange for a big hoppy beer. Also, the order of things are mixed up, the malt comes first, and then the hop bitterness, I'm a little confused here. It's by no means a bad beer, they did a good job, it's a quality beer, just a little strange. It really is a good beer, so I have a hard time grading this below a 4 on taste, part of me wants to, but I know that it deserves a 4. As far as mouthfeel goes, it's pretty standard for an IPA, nothing disappointing there. As for drinkability, on some tastes you can notice the alcohol more than others, but for the most part it is pretty subdued and is somewhat easy to put back considering it's an IPA. Overall a good beer, it's not the best IPA I've had, it's a little weak in some areas, but it's a solid brew.","MaltsOfGlory","Apr 10, 2011"
4.55,5.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"O- overall this beer is very close to ideal for the style. It is overhopped to the extreme and should only be handled by professionals. The ABV tends to signify an ipa while the hop profile leans heavily towards a double. This conflict brings down the score slightly based on style. Outside of that, this is another great beer from the hop geniuses at Stone.","jables7","Apr 10, 2011"
4.38,1.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours out a cloudy orange with a tall white head that has nice lacing and very very good retention. It also has moderate carbonation. It has a nice aroma of citrus, earthy hops, biscuits, and pine. The taste is a pleasant taste of earthy hops, pine, followed by some floral hops and finishes off with some citrus and honey. The aftertaste has some orange and grapefruit in it. I do like the creamy smooth mouthfeel that is like heaven on the tongue and cheeks. This beer reminds me a lot of Bell's HopSlam Ale and I think both are worth trying for all you hop lovers out there.","DannyDan","Apr 09, 2011"

Well, it pours a hazy, golden color, with a smallish head. The smell is your typical pine, with light citrus that you expect in a DIPA. The taste for me is more resinous pine than citrus. Jacked up bitterness, which I love in an IPA, double or otherwise. It doesn't have that malty balance that other DIPAs usually have, which, in this case, is fine with me.

I love the way this beer smells. Lightly sweet and oh so hoppy. Mango, orange peel, and peach. The malt lies submissively underneath it all. It knows its roll. Carbonation is spot on. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Grapefruit and pine flavors play lightly on the palate. Not too resiny so it goes down relatively light and easy. Finish is dry, long, and hoppy. This is where the IBUs get you. Its not until long after you swallow that you feel like you've been chewing on a mouthful of fresh hops. Still one of my favorite DIPAs. I don't know how Stone managed to craft such a hoppy, bitter beer and keep the flavors light enough to make it very drinkable but I'm glad they are keeping it up!","hoppyhampy","Mar 17, 2011"

At least until that back-end bitterness kicks in - it is satisfying and rich, like sucking on lemon zest, and it lingers long on the finish.

A candy floss sweetness with a stabby hop flavour underneath. Quite fruity in a slightly tropical way. Very promising multi-layered aroma. Big, hard-hitting hops threaten to overwhelm but just as they teeter on the edge of too-muchness they recede somewhat but too much for me to handle. What follows is a candied peach smoothness. The after effects contain much hoppy bitterness but the fruit lingers too. Tingly in the mouth. Smooth and oily thick. Bracingly bitter. Thick, pungent hop aroma however.

Unlike some other San Diego-style IPAs, this leans a little heavier on the bittering hops, and is all the better for it. Juicy and resiny, this is pretty excellent. Again, the sweetness is low, but substantial and complex enough to add a lot to this beer. Mild caramel and mildly toasty/biscuit-like, it perfectly accents the hops. While this beer is light in body, the oily, resiny character does make it seem bigger than it is, and the moderate carbonation make for an excellent beer.

Each sip afterward was continuously filled with dramatic pine needles and grapefruit rind hops and never left me disappointed (until I finished the beer, of course). Undertones of sweet pale malts rolled out from under all the hops for the briefest moments right at the end, forming an arching backbone just looking for a good, quick scratch before being washed over by a final wave of lemon peel and herbal resin. The mouthfeel was consistently medium, especially with the rich flavors, and was rather silky and creamy even with the good amount of spicy carbonation. It wasn't exactly smooth, but it was easy to drink and really quite delicious.","Lucklys","Nov 30, 2010"

This beer is wonderfully balanced with bready bisucuity malts and warming alcohol with nice citrus/piney hop undertone.

The lasting bitterness can really prove this IPA or double IPA is really the real deal here. When everyone talks about American IPA this should be the very first one they mention. This is a hop bomb but thats not to say theres some malty full body sweetness in there which there is at the very beginning of the sip.

Poured with a huge head that left a nice bit of lacing. This one is all about the hops, hops, and bitter hops. I really wish there was more of a malty backbone to this beer, it's not very well rounded. It's intense hops without much more going on here. I found it exteremely bitter and I prefer IPAs with more going on or a sweet hop character - I've become a bit of a hophead but don't go for a flatly bitter taste in my hops. This one had kind of a one dimensional hop quality of bitter. This may have something to do with an older sample but I found it to be good but uninspiring. I've had some really good IPAs in the last week Surly Wet, Mpls Town Hall Fresh Hop, Ballast Point Sculpin, Alpine Pure Hoppiness. This one was good but I didn't think it lived up to the hype or to those. I'd like to try this fresher to see if it was just that bottle.

Flavor initially gave two immediate impressions: 1) the palate was slightly heavy, as if the malt was just slightly overpowering the hops, and 2) a faint but noticeable presence of fruit that is not typical of this style, along the lines of mango or passion fruit. The tropical fruit impression is very nice. I wish the bitterness was a bit lower so those fruits could shine more. Thanks to my brother-in-law Chris.","JAXSON","Sep 09, 2010"

Scents of herbs, citrus and flowers persist in the nose. Starts with a good punch of malt flavor. Citrus and woody flavors begin to appear with warming alcohol throughout. While 100 IBU's made me think this would be a bitter offering from Stone, it was actually well balanced and had just the right amount of hops. Feels substantial in the mouth, you know you are drinking a worthy beer. Easily one of the most drinkable IPA's out there, and by far one of the most enjoyable.

Aromas practically run the gamut of hop adjectives (minus "earthy" and "woody"), but are primarily citrusy, then piney and resinous, with floral notes to boot. I also detect a bit of caramel on the nose and a faint hint of alcohol, which is hardly surprising considering the abv. Taste-wise, the hops truly do perform an absolute palate-wipe. Unless you are eating something sweet and sticky ( like bbq ribs) or strong and greasy (like garlic fries), I wouldn't recommend this for a suitable pairing, but if such dishes are the case, you need search no further than this beer to find a match made in heaven.","droomyster","Aug 25, 2010"

Clearly they were going for a style which would blow your socks off and they sure succeeded. If I had any criticism it is that it lacked a bit of complexity in the hoppiness...the strongest hops seemed to drown out the more floral elements a tad, sort of like an orchestra where the brass overshadows the woodwinds. For a comparable style with more complexity, at least in this man's opinion, try the Green Flash West Coast IPA.","MysticRuler","Aug 21, 2010"

I am tasting this in a horizontal comparison with 4 other DIPAs and I have to admit that the Ruination way trumps both the DFH 90 and Southern Tier 2XIPA in terms of flavours and nose but the extreme level of bitterness has inevitably took 0.5 off both taste and drinkability. If I am in the mood to go extreme and wreck my palates, I will definitely choose this but more often, I may prefer to go easy. Nonetheless, I will still give credit for the amazing nose and flavors of this great beer.","basica","Jul 03, 2010"

Citrus, orange and lemon zest, grapefruit, pine and floral hops out front. A small amount of dark fruit and caramel malt give the beer a hidden sweetness, but the hops overpower this before long. Alcohol has a small presence, especially as you get further into the better. This one finishes very bitter as advertised as the pine hops scold the tongue and leave a big dry flavor. Huge tasting double IPA. All about showing off the hops.","uustal","Jun 28, 2010"

The Bell's I drank last night was unfiltered, and that definitely adds something, a complexity...anyway, smells great!!! The smell of those citrusy hops knocks you back, I swear I wish they could just bottle those huge Cascade whiffs you get upon first crack of the bottle....mouthfeel was lighter than expected for this style of beer, CA IPA. Let me sum it up by saying Stone is a great brewery in the California high hop style, but out here in Chicagoland, i won't pay premium over SN again, I feel like Torpedo is about on the same level, and Sierra Nevada is the real deal, original homey-feel.","Star80","Jun 23, 2010"

The pungent grapefruit alludes to the bitterness to come. A bit of sweet caramel malt pokes through upfront in the flavor, followed by more big, bold grapefruity bitterness. The intense resiny bitterness lingers for what seems like an eternity, I feel like I was just chewing on some fresh cones!

Color is a tad deeper golden than the regular IPA. Hops aroma is a bit more complex, although not overwhelmingly so. Taste seems to me like a richer, hoppier Stone IPA, with more emphasis on the citrus flavors, rather than the uni-demensional hop profile of regular IPA. So smooth and easy drinking for a 7.7% beer.

4.52,5.1,4,4.5,5,4,4,"Reviewed form my notes. This beer is nearly translucent with a dark straw color. It has a thick white foam head. The aroma is full of great earth hops. It smells like there may be some yeast aromas present, but it's just as likely I'm just smelling the complex hops and confusing the two. A bit of sweetness appears initially when you taste. This is followed by hearty, grassy hops. The beer finishes with a very bitter hop flavor. Is there a better tasting DIPA out there? Possibly, but I haven't had it. The body feels a bit heavier than what I call medium. There is a lot of tickling carbonation and decent mouthcoating. This is a very hoppy, strong beer. It's hard to drink a lot of these in a row, but individually it goes down very well. Plus, DIPA's aren't meant for chugging, but savoring.","ToasterChef","Jan 24, 2010"

Poured a slightly hazy orange-gold with a frothy, bright white half inch head. Head eventually settles into a fairly consistent skim of a cap, with delicate strands of lacing around the perimeter of the glass. Nicely balanced nose - some sweet citrus and some aromatic bittering hops. Taste consistent with nose - hops character seems a bit diminished; however, its still pretty tasty. Finish is slightly medicinal and lightly lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an assertive carbonation level and some acidity that stimulates the cheeks. Pretty solid IPA - I'll have to re-evaluate on a fresh bottle; however, the fact that this has stood up so well past its expiration date is a testament to the quality of the brew.","Jwale73","Jan 23, 2010"

The aroma is pungent with scents of grapefruit and pine hops. The first sip is powerfully bitter without being overwhelming. The next taste is a big gulp that leaves my tongue saturated with hop oils so that the bitterness lingers for a few seconds. Despite this powerful hop character, you could almost call the flavor balanced because of the bit of malt sweetness, and the carbonation makes it go down surprisingly easy.

First sip is very fresh and crisp up front then with a nice hop character that is like orange rind marmalade. With following sips the hop profile builds in strength, complexity and bitterness. The piney bight comes to the front as you drink also. The hops become so dominant that the whole mouth is overtaken creating a hugely bitter hoppy whole mouth feel.

Spicy bitterness that is on the end of the spectrum that I don't like. Warming alcohol feeling in the finish.

Taste was sweet upfront with a noticeable orange citrus flavor and hints of honey. Hop bitterness comes through very strongly on the finish, lingering through to the next sip.

What the f*$k did you think it was gonna smell like. It smells like pure hops period. I can't find adjectives to describe it. Piney is an understatement. The flavor is so bitter and hoppy. It makes me pucker all the way to my toes. I imagine if you picked fresh pine needles smashed them into a grapefruit then took a bite. You couldn't get a more piney bitter taste in your mouth. It just keeps going too. I take a gulp and a minute later all I can taste is hops. I love it. It's medium bodied and leaves your mouth feeling tired and abused. This is a great DIPA.

Moderate carbonation combines with the rest to make this a robust drink. The finish is decidedly bitter hop, with a long, long bitter aftertaste.

This balanced and delicious DIPA is not terribly complex, to be honest, but it does enjoy the best of both worlds where the depth and body of hops complement, rather than overpower, the other flavour elements on the whole. The high level of hop bitterness also camouflage the alc. strength, hence a truly, um, "easy-drinking" ale for Bitter lovers like me!","wl0307","Jul 04, 2009"

4.33,0.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured from bomber, a mostly clear bright orange with creamy eggshell colored head, thick lacing. Smell: hops are on display, piney, earthy, citrus rind, candied citrus, with a soft toasted malt sweetness in the background. Taste: serious hoppiness, pine, floral, earthy, white grapefruit, tangerine, as well as toasty caramel sweet malt, that surfaces towards the end of the sip only to be beat out again by a nearly-puckering leafy, piney hop punch and lingering case of citrus-tongue. Mouthfeel: medium bodied, soft. Drinkability is off the charts for a DIPA, as the lower alcohol level, which is present only as a gradual building warmth, helps keep the focus on the hops and not on the booze.","babaracas","May 25, 2009"

One of the hoppiest beers around my neck of the woods(North Idaho) and coincidently it comes from one of my favorite breweries, Stone.","Mrbassjedi","May 05, 2009"
4.32,0.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,4,"Poured from a bomber bottle into a pint glass. Paired with some cheese and chips and salsa. Golden/copper color. Big rocky white head, leaves a lot of lacing. Smells like fresh American hops, like you're literally holding a bunch of them up to your nose. Big and piney. Theres a lot of carbonation. Definitely a big beer with enough malt to stand up to the hops. Fairly warming with all the alcohol. As it gets warmer you get a lot of citrus flavors, grapefruit I guess? Beats 90 Minute and Hop Wallop I think.","drunkboxer1","May 05, 2009"

Nicely assertive hop bitterness with lots of grapefruit flavors and some grassy undertones at first, fading onto some piney notes near the end before a slightly sweet finish. A dry bitterness remains in the mouth after swallowing. Mouth feel is as one would expect from a beer of this size.","zoso1967","May 05, 2009"

Overall, I think I prefer the aromatics and the flavors of the Ruination over the standard Stone IPA.  But keeping style in focus, if I had to place Ruination among other DIPAs, I still think 90min would get my vote - my take is that the 90 is better balanced on the palate, something that West Coast examples seem unconcerned with.  Even though DIPAs/IPAs are a style I'm trying to come to grips with, I thought Stone's Ruination was a nice offering and one worth trying at least once.","Buschyfor3","May 02, 2009"

Ridiculous amount of citrus, pine and earthiness scents off the bat. The scent is so prevalent - it's great around the nose. Taste is full of hops and citrus. The bitterness immediately presents itself in the aftertaste. 100 IBU's is no joke, it's very noticeable. Great taste nonetheless. Drinkability is not hard, it's sippable.

The taste is surprisingly smooth for all the hops it has, starting off with some bready malt that gives way to hops that shift as they linger. Definite citrus, woodiness, spiciness, and floral in nature. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some low carbonation.

Very strong bitter hop scents, mostly pine coming off this. Again, the hops take over the flavor with this one, killing whatever sweetness the malt had in mind.

Tried alongside Maharaja, this has a more varied nose - somewhat less citrus, a little more pine. Taste follows the nose, with the hops kicking ass in the forefront. Compared to the Maharaja, very little malt backing, so this is more of a puckering hop assault. Feel is downright light for a DIPA, making this dangerously drinkable. Alcohol is on the light side for this style, further adding to drinkability.","Patrick999","Mar 30, 2009"

The colour of the beer is golden/light copper colour The beer come across as quite bitter with some notes of alcohol at the end, but there is a strong citrus flavour in the background. The beer is incredibly balanced even with the huge bitterness. The pale malts of the beer come through slightly, but there isn't much there. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, so it fits well. The beer is probably the most drinkable IIPA, I've ever had. It's so smooth and subtle, but complex. Great tasting ale, but it needs more hop complexities. It's an all centennial beer, so it tastes great, but it's just lacking a bit of punch in the hop department (I know it sound weird to say that for an IIPA, but I like the complexity of mixed hops!)","swizzlenuts","Mar 28, 2009"

To me, it tastes like an amateur's attempt at a double IPA who had a small budget and wanted to get the highest IBUs as possible. I feel like Stone's only goal was to create a brew with a high IBU count. They seemed to skimp on the aromatic hop selection and completely avoid a malty support as if to trick the drinker into focusing on the bitterness.

The smell was mostly hops, I sensed much a lot of pine, but also some nice citrus. I was so excited when I got my hands on this beer that I pretty much completely forgot to note the mouthfeel, but the overall experience was great and I remember a kind of thickness that I really enjoyed. The hops were almost overwhelming right off the bat and the bitterness that they brought hung around almost indefinitely. There was citrus followed by a nice malty afterglow. This is a beer that deserves to be enjoyed sip by sip; absolutely delicious. I'm sure I will be coming back to this beer in the future. In other news, I find the curvy brown bottles that Rogue, Stone, and some other West Coast breweries use is the sexiest bottle out there. It's curvacious, just like a good woman should be.

It sort of looks just like Sam Adams lager or such.. The aroma is AMAZING- I'm not a huge hop fan but this is the sweetest hop aroma I've ever smelled. Flavor is interesting, not just like other hop bombs, this has a smooth balance. Hoppiness isn't biting up front, it's strong but mellow. Has an earthy base with some hint of malt which keeps it's crisp. Mouth is nice. Sort of full, definitely not thin. The aftertaste is pleasant and not overwhelmingly bitter. This certainly lives up to it's A status.. Very enjoyable for hop heads and those who aren't.","BirdFlu","Feb 17, 2009"

3.93,-8.6,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Brew poured to a cloudy yellow to orange color with a thick off white head that had good retention and left thick lacing along the sides of the glass. From the pour you could clearly notice the heavy amounts of hops that have been used in this brew. That aroma brings forth noticeable pine scent with a slight citrus mix. While this aroma was expected I was expecting it to actually be more pungent as it is labeled as over 100 IBUs. With this being said the hops is all I could pick up. The flavor is about the hops as well, though I feel that it is more like a grapefruit flavor. You do notice a unbalance malt flavor, that mixed together seem to give a slight sweet flavor. As I said the hops are very pungent and the hop resin like favor just sticks to the back of the tongue/mouth. Though this brew weighs in at 7.7% the alcohol does not come out. Nice brew, I am not a big hop head but once in a while they work for me. This one worked and is one I would get again.","Stimack","Feb 15, 2009"

I found the aroma a bit weak and one dimensional, and the flavor more so. I hoped for more flavor and aroma emphasis, but sadly, this was the kind of flat, bitterness oriented IPA that I don't care for. Drinking this was kind of like sucking on a grapefruit filled with juniper berries, and while I do enjoy both grapefruit and gin (often together), that is not the experience I am looking for in a beer, even an IPA.","nickfl","Feb 14, 2009"

4.47,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Very good DIPA. Ruination was one of the first beers to get me hooked on craft beer, and I still like it very much. It has a caramel sweet malty backbone that serves to bring out the hop profile beautifully. Having tried many other DIPAs now, I find that I'm more impressed with the maltiness than the hops. A lot of big IPAs have too little malt sweetness to realize their hop flavors fully. This beer does not suffer from this flaw. The caramel malt is strong and assertive and cuts out most of the hop bitterness, allowing the rich, oily grapefruit flavors of the hops to push to the forefront. I find the hop profile just a tad on the boring side at this point. Let me qualify that quite a bit. I love the hops in Ruination, however it tastes a lot like many San Diego DIPAs. Of course, this is most likely down to other breweries looking to Stone, rather than the other way round. That said, I find the hop profile dominated by bitter grapefruit, without a lot of pine, spruce or floral aspects like you get in some DIPAs. All that said, this is a minor point and it's still a delicious, very hoppy beer. The beer looks pretty great, although after seeing some of the gigantic DIPAs with heads that are almost orange with hop oiliness, my standards are set unbearably high. The feel is very nice. It certainly doesn't "ruin" your palate as much as some overly aggressive DIPAs. I'm surprised at how close I now find Ruination and DFH 90 min, as that seems like an obvious comparison to make. Sure, Ruination has a bit more bitterness, and the hop profiles differ, but both beers have very rich malt characters as compared to many beers in this style. I wonder if their rich malt backbones at somewhat lower alcohol contents plays into their popularity. Now, I'm rambling and I'll wrap this thing up. Ruination is a great beer, and Stone is a great brewery.","popery","Jan 20, 2009"

They didn't just dump a pile of hops into this. The hops and pine complement each other nicely, and a real nice bitterness follows (makes me wonder what the IBU is).

Tastes like orange, grapefruit, pine, pith... Just the slightest hint of caramel malt, just enough to balance the flavor and make the beer obnoxiously bitter.

They don't stand out as much as some DIPA's, but the balancing act here is pulled off perfectly, which results in a drinkable, yet very tasty example of the style. Mouth-feel is medium bodied. This one goes down pretty smooth, with an essence of orange peel as an aftertaste.

Citrus aromas dominate. Citrus might actually be a bit vague, its mostly oranges. Floral, pine and resin notes are also present. Taste is like the aroma but, in a way, its a bit more balanced. The citrus hops that dominated the aroma play a more complimentary role in the flavor but still dominate. Piney and resiny hops are more prominent here and really come to the fore towards the finish when the bitterness really hits. This beer is indeed solidly and strongly bitter but it doesn't seem like the 100+ IBUs the bottle claims. Mouthfeel is quite good, medium-light body with moderate+ carbonation. Drinkability is pretty darn good, this brew is very flavorful and enjoyable and a darn good representation of the style.

Color is a clear honey-golden, and off-white head is thick and fairly persistent. Flavor is ferociously hoppy and quite bitter, but has a hint of sweetness and even a bit of fruity taste. Texture is fairly smooth, but it still goes down with an attitude and leaves a pleasantly bitter, hoppy aftertaste. Recommended for all who love seriously hoppy ales.","Cyberkedi","Oct 19, 2008"

A strong aroma of fresh hops fills my nose with orange, grapefruit, pine, and mint. The taste is almost too complex to describe. Multiple flavors of fresh hops and malt dance around. The malt is rich and yet velvety. The hops are luscious but not harsh for such a highly hopped beer. Stone has pulled off one of the most difficult brewing techniqes out there. A balanced, yet not harsh, double IPA. THE best example I've ever tried of this style.","beerkittycat","Sep 21, 2008"

It was centennials, one of the best hops I've ever smelled and tasted, and I think there's another in there, it would be tough to push a beer to 100+ IBUs with only centennial, but the whole bottle and the beer in the glass smell like opening a bag full of fresh hops. It pours amber colored with a decent head, not the biggest, but that's perfectly find for this beer. When you taste it, I can't think of a comparison (from any of the beers I've ever gotten in SC) in terms of hoppy beers. There's nothing astringent to it, just a crisp flavor with a clean, beautiful bitterness, and it's surprisingly balanced, though the malt definitely gets no spotlight. You know from the name that this beer is ruinous for your mouth, but I actually loved it. I had the taste in my mouth for an hour, just drinking water that tasted like hops, but its certainly not a great thing if you're trying to do anything else. I found myself wanting more and the alcohol doesn't hit too hard, but I can't see this beer having a high value in a session.","taylorhamrick","Sep 21, 2008"

While a very dry beer, it maints a smoothness to it and was kind of creamy and fluffy...a very filling beer in the mouth. Not only is there a warming sensation to this beer, but it gets smoother as it warms (it's a sipper) and not only do the hops (mostly citric and earthy) continually poke out but there are some underlying malts, a little sweet in my opinion, in there as well.

You are hit with one of the hoppiest, most grapefruity tastes in the world of IPAs as soon as this hits your palate. The aromas coming out of it are unreal. One of the more drinkable doubles out there as <8%, and won't knock you over like a DFH 90min will. It's a heavy citrus-y smell and taste, and literally a double-IPA defined imho.

Aroma is hops of course, but there are hop aromas of pine, citrus, flowers, and fruit. I can hold the glass about 8" from my nose and still detect the aroma, it makes the hair on my arm stand up. Pours a great gold hue with lots of thick white head that creates a decent amount of lacing. Great mouthfeel, surprisingly full and creamy. Flavor is jam packed with hops which wasn't a surprise. Fortunately you can also enjoy a good amount of malts. What is truly spectacular is that although it bites you right away the incredible amount of hops actually blend well and fade into a nice smoooth finish. I'm sure that I shouldn't be talking very close to anybody right now but this one works well. 100+ IBU's is crazy and for this beer to mesh and work out as great as it does deserves a round of applause.","kinger","Aug 05, 2008"

I am not a hop head, and I thought this might be to hoppy for me, but I am pleasantly surprised to find I rather like it. Mouthfeel is a bit chewy, but I could have used a bit less carbonation myself, but other than that minor side note, this is a tasty beverage. I'm feeling hops on my tongue for about a minute after each sip. I would have to place drinkability in the medium range, because I wouldn't want to drink more than a couple of bottles before I lost all sense of taste.

Aroma of lemon, pine, citrus scented bathroom cleaner, a minor touch of circus peanuts. Tastes of lemons with skin and all, citrus, pine, bright citrusy sweet notes toward the finish, clean bitterness. Tickles the tongue. Light bodied with medium carbonation.

As if there weren't enough hops aromas and flavors in this beer, it's been spiced up with Columbus and Simcoe rounds of dry hopping. They both contribute a great deal of complexity to a big beer that is already heavy on the hops. There are blasts of citrus, pine, black pepper, and a slight grass hint in the finish. Same malt signatures as the bottled version but the real treat here is the cask presentation. The beer has smoothed out considerably, mouthfeel is soft and silky, this is just a treat to consume. So highly and dangerously drinkable after three pints I knew that things were going to go south if I kept going at that pace, but it was hard to stop.

Just an OK aroma, though the taste is a different story. Solid hop punch here. Very bitter. The hops have way more of a piney resin aspect here. The citrus aspects are gone.

4.72,9.8,4,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Glowing brass-orange color, with s rather small but thick looking almond colored head. Moderate lacing and little carbonation. Not surprisingly the nose is dominated by a beautiful array of hops of all kinds... floral, fresh cut grass, pine resin. Some lemon and grapefruit citrus manages to sneak in there as well however. Taste is like a full scale blitzkrieg... hops just immediately attack the palate with various varieties managing to make their presence felt this providing some variability even if my palate sucks to much to figure out what exactly. Amazingly though some resin/earth malt manages to come on slowly and while maybe not balancing the beer, it at least provides some refuge. To say the finish is bitter doesn't do it justice. Really nice medium-to-full body on this thing too. For the first time I actually get what all the fuss is about these big hop-heavy beers... alive, sexy and slightly abusive but in a naughty I like it kind of way. OK I'm gonna go be alone with the rest of the this now.","VitBAficionado","Feb 09, 2008"

Intense fruity aroma with hints of grapefruit and pine trees - hops dominate this beer. Very dry and again the fruity hops are dominant with just a subtle malt character subsumed beneath it all. While intense, I appreciate the seeming restraint from an intense brewery like Stone - they don't overdo it here. This beer has a medium-heavy mouth feel, definitely a sipping beer.","TheBCrew","Feb 07, 2008"

There are plenty of varying hops in the taste. I would prefer more of the citrusy, juicy hops, but this beer gets it's name because of the bittering, tastebud crushing hop variety.

Malts come in the form of a bit of hay and nuts, but it is light. There is also honey and a bit of oak. It pours with virtually no head and has a slightly hazy body clarity. The color is a rich, peachy orange. Flavor is amazing, and your first sip really is the best, you can never get the same jubilation from drinking more (trust me, I tried). The flavor starts lightly sweet and then goes into a heavy bitterness. Mouth feel is oily.

This is the first time I've had it in bottle even though I've had it on tap a couple of times. Everything seems milder. Aroma is of pine needles, mild grapefruit and surprisingly a real mild sweetness at the end of the nose. Taste is full frontal hops.

4.74,10.2,4,5,5,4,4.5,"Now that I've lived with it for a while, I can honestly say it's bit of a novelty beer. It's amazing at what it does, namely, assault your nose and mouth with one of the most intense beer tasting experiences around. What it doesn't do well: it doesn't go well with food (too dominant), and it's too big and kick ass to be a good session beer. I can't imagine drinking three or more pints of this without having my tongue and nose go numb and possibly inducing some kind of permanent sensory deprivation. For serial drinking or drinking with food, the other Stone offerings are actually better, more balanced choices. But once in a while, you just need to be tied up, spanked, and forcefed until you cry out with the safe word. For that, break out the Ruination and start begging.","watchnerd","Jan 13, 2008"

The flavor is complex and satisfying, but the medicinal quality of the hop oils in this one make the mouthfeel my favorite aspect. This heavy dose of lupulin also leads to the one less than awesome facet of this beer experience. The drinkability suffers, in my case, because great care is required to avoid the spins and drowsiness and thus it is, as we say, a "sipper". But...I've got time. Top notch beer.","MobBarley","Nov 06, 2007"
3.97,-7.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"My favorite Stone beer. Especially when you live on the east coast and manage to get a bottle that is just two weeks old. Medium Amber color with a thin white head. Nose of bitter citrus oils and sweet malt. Medium body with a sticky, lush malt feeling sliding over my tongue, delivering a blast of grapefruit hop flavor that I can feel on the sides of my tongue. The finish is like a glass of grapefruit juice without as much acidity.","dedrinker","Nov 04, 2007"

Of course it is of hops but I think that theres almost too much going on here and it really distracts from anything particular. Taste is good. Not as bitter as I expected but strong hops tastes, some malt but mainly the hops. Somewhat bitter aftertaste with a touch of grapefruit, leaves a dry feeling.

T: A nice sweet/bitter balance up front, giving way to a very cirtus/grassy hop character. M: Pretty average, less thick that I had anticipated. D: I think this one falls somewhere in between an IPA and a DIPA. Its definitely aggressive, but just not as aggressive as a single IPA.

Lacing left all over the tulip glass (my wife prefers it out of a pint glass, but she's a novice - haha). Aroma is heavily that of citrusy/piney herbal hop aromas with a slight floral note powering through. Taste is overwhelmingly bitter hops, grapefruit and resinous pine notes, with a strong hoppy spice. Although it is strongly hopped, it is balanced well with toasted malt flavors and a slight caramel flavor. Definite alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is rather thick and slick, but the carbonation makes it tingly and easy drinking. Only the alcohol strength keeps me from quaffing this beer throughout the night, as I usually end up passed-out after three 22 oz. bottles, which is a good thing because otherwise it ends up being an expensive night of drinking.","domtronzero","Sep 03, 2007"

I'd almost expect it to be a second IPA, because, while not particularly hoppier than the Stone IPA, it has a quite different flavor (lacking in some of the sourness?).

It had a smaller head that I expected but still decent. Good lacing. The aroma was of course insane hops - more citrusy than floral. Was a combination of smells but one of them I definitely didn't like so hurt the score a bit. The taste had the same problem. Starts off really good but has this weird aftertaste. Not sure but what it is but don't like it. Fortunately, it's not dominant enough to ruin the whole experience. Mouthfeel is good with nice hop attack. Overall, it's a good beer but that weird smell/taste keeps it out of the top ADIPA's for me. Need to try again to make sure a good sample but the review is for this bottle.

The aroma is a bit fruity, with apricots dominating, while the unmistakeable fragrance of piney hops wafts upward to the nose. It has a very clean, almost sterile scent overall. Now, the flavor: floral and hops with hints of grapefruit, especially while cold. As it warms, the beer develops less citrus fruit and more floral overtones.

Pouring the beer the aroma was pure hops, might as well have thrown the flowers into a glass. The color was very nice, and a very nice head that it kept somewhat. Crazy lacing going on. The first taste threw me for a loop, damn that was a lot of hops. It definitely had that ruinous affect on my palate. I adjusted to the hoppiness at it became remarkably smooth from there, albeit still a blinding level of hops. Really smooth beer too, no alcohol burn, not too much carbonation, very smooth. I wasnt able to appreciate the malty undertones much though... Im guessing in large part simply due to my inexperience. The only thing preventing me from giving a better rating is that I cant see much more to this beer than crazy amounts of hops (which is not a bad thing by any means, but I want to save my top ratings for a more complex brew).

Smells hoppy, with a very floral piney/grapefruit aroma. More pine than citrusy here, but a very pleasant scent for sure. Hmmm... a big hoppy taste, but not quite what I was expecting. I mean, yes it's big and yes it's bursting with all sorts of hop goodness, but it doesn't really seem all that complex to me. The hops are almost overdone a bit, and what little malt character is present doesn't seem to balance things out very well at all. Sure, it's a tasty brew, if you like hops, but it doesn't add much to the whole double IPA movement sweeping the American landscape beyond being big and hoppy. Sturdy, almost creamy (but dry) mouthfeel. A drinkable beer, but again, only if you like lots and lots of hops. Otherwise, I honestly believer there are better, more evenly balanced double IPAs out there worth visiting. I'd take an Oaked Arrogant Bastard over the Ruination any day.","Atlas1","Jun 13, 2007"

Not as much lacing as I would expect. The smell is of citrus/grapefruit, grapefruit rind, and caramel malt. The grapefruit hop flavor blasts your palate. a bit of pine and resin. The bitter blast is followed by a semi-offsetting caramel sweetness. Definitely not as sweet as other ADIPAs, which is good in my book. I find that overly sweet IPAs bring the drinkability down. This brew has a nice balance. The feel is moderately bodied and has a creamy feel. It is bitter but doesn't blast your taste buds. This is probably the best IPA that I have tried.

The taste is a bit too hoppy for me right out of the refrigerator, but as the beer warms its true character emerges. There is a very nice sweetness that complements the hoppy bitterness. It is medium to full bodied and the sweetness works with the consistency of the beer and reminds me of some of the weaker barley wines I've tried; we are not talking syrupy barley wine here, but there is some hints at it. The hoppy esters remain on the tongue and the after taste is not nearly as bitter as one would expect with this hoppy brew.

Tons of grapefruit and tangerine. Doesn't get really bitter, but there is a pleasant lingering bitter after each sip. This can't be 100+ IBUs.

The website says that it's Magnum and Centennial hops -- ah, Magnum. The taste is remarkably smooth for a 100+ IBU selection -- the bitterness comes and goes, or maybe it's always there, but masked during the middle of the flavor arc by the tropical fruits and the smooth malts. Steady carbonation adds to the smooth mouthfeel. If it weren't so strong (and you can feel the heat as you sip it), I'd hook this up all night.

Aromas of zesty, piney hops, passionfruit and a surprising, very welcome malt note: rich caramel malts with some spiciness on top, with just enough sweet smells to balance out the hops somewhat. On the palate, really smooth malts (some of the best I've had for this style of beer) of soft caramel make the first appearance, but after that it's all hops, with the malt serving only as a (very solid) base on which to build a huge, magnificent hop house. The bitterness is fantastic -- big and citrusy (lots of grapefruit, a bit of tropical fruits) and just a bit harsh, with a tobacco finish. Mouthfeel is extraordinary for the style -- huge hoppy, resiny feeling made more than tolerable by a huge malt component and good carbonation.

The smell and the perfume of the hops forcefully opens up your nostrils when you smell and open up to drink it. You can almost smell the grapefruit rinds, the citrusy smell is so prevalent. Pouring a bottle of this, you might be able to smell it in the next room. Hoppy-plus taste that isn't too dry, actually tastes a little more alcoholic than it is. Hard to differentiate this from the 9% Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA. It has a solid malt balance, but the hops rule this brew. So aromatic, but I find this a little more drinkable than the DFH 90.

Taste was perfectly crisp, with the hops hitting you up front, followed by some grapefruit and other citrus fruits. The lingering taste on this beer is ever so bitter, and damn pleasing. Mouthfeel was surprisingly light, however the hop profile is really in your face. Alcohol is not apparent really, though it does not need to be in that the flavors are all pretty extreme.

Perfect sized ale body. Very good double IPA. Cheers!","rayjay","Jan 10, 2007"

The head is thick and bubbly and lasts to the bottom of the glass leaving white lacing all the way down. The aroma is wonderful, hoppy and sweet. This is exactly how beer should smell! The mouthfeel isn't the least bit watery or thin. I can't say the taste is complex, but it is perfectly balanced and absolutely flawless. Other beers--even high quality beers--with about the same alcohol content are more noticeably alcoholic, the alcohol here is tucked away nicely and only shows up as a lingering euphoria after the beer is gone. Stone crafts their beers perfectly and this is a great example of their work.","PhiloPsych","Jan 03, 2007"

The fragrance is very piney. The flavor is more complex, with hops and pine backing. This beer screams of summer to me, and is pretty much my drink of choice around the grill. The flavor opens up as it warms and with summer grilling in Phoenix this is a big plus. The only downside to this beer is that it does ruin you taste buds. Another reason I like this when I am grilling something with big flavor that can punch through.","mhaugan","Dec 22, 2006"

First taste is a bit of a surprise, in that I am not being bowled over by sweetness and hops - but I love it! My only other Stone experience was the Stone 10th Anniversary - and that one did bowl me over with hops. This one is very hoppy - don't get me wrong - but it's much better balanced than I was expecting. It goes down the throat perfectly and leaves a wonderful hoppy aftertaste that keeps on giving.

Smells of subtle floral scents from the hop's contribution. The malt seems to take a wonderfully supportive role, balancing the lush hop presence. Some grape fruit, pine, citrus even toasty notes. The taste is much the same, with notes of toasted barely, subtle sweet malt, tons of refreshing hops. It's a dry, floral start, matched with mild sweet malt, the finish is the best very refreshing, second only to wonderful burps. This definitely lets the hop take over, in my favorite double IPAs there is a bit more sweet malt, but this is still a kick ass brew. Undoubtedly drinkable and worth a try.","mmcave","Nov 24, 2006"

Nice mix of hop flavors overwhelmed my palate. I knew what I was getting into but not for the faint hop experience. This beer brings the hop bite. Nice flow of hop tones from start to finish. Very floral and citrusy at first and then trails off to a nice dry hop finish. Mild hint of malt somewhere lost in the back ground. This beer has a tasty and refreshing hop flavor that is surprisingly tolerable. 100+ IBU count is very much there and blends very well throughout the beer. It is has an enjoyable hop taste that really does take over the pallet. If you were eating any dinner it may not taste the same after this beer. You may want to savor this selection alone. It is very well constructed and enjoyable not an overpowering smash in the mouth hop flavor. It is a controlled anarchy of hop fusion. Great brew with a good drinkability.

Definitely one of my favorite DIPA's, not as sweet as most with a rather dry finish which I really like. If it wasn't for the 7.7% abv I could put these back all night.

A vigorous froth sweetens it up. Ah, there it is, the malt is revealed. I also get citrus hop characteristics coming through now also. As I sip and drink, I ask myself where's the punch I keep hearing about. Then, I start to get this feeling in my mouth. The feeling like I've been chewing on high Alpha Acid hop pellets! This is only my second Stone brew and I was expecting some kind of unruly hop knock-out. The after-bitterness is very distinct. As this IPA warms, the hop-numb becomes a little more pronounced.

The hops and the spice covers your whole mouth with a IPA style tingle. The blend is great with only a hint of the normal bitterness. In all the beer is a sweet blend of hops and malt with a strong spice. The beer has a surprisingly crisp refreshing feel and is far smother then other strong IPAs that Ive had.

Taste is at first sip simply a strong bitterness, dry and grassy in its finish. As the beer warms and I adjust the sweet citrus is evident in the background as well as a piney, peppery, alcoholy kick before a big dry finish. Besides rejoicing the distribution announcement, I felt like something hoppy tonite, and of course this hits the spot.

The first snif went up my nose, but the after that it was fine. Grassy tannin bitterness (yuck) with a sweet malt and citrus blend. This had way more grass bitter than I remember and it really turned me off. I set it down as I played some ran around killing Zombies in the mall and as it warmed the grassyness mellowed out but never went away.

Grassy hop smell with a hint of citrus. The aroma and the taste seem to be a little off. Expected (from both the aroma and the description) more hop bitterness, but it was pretty tame. However, there is an earthy-hop (Chinook?) taste up-front and a lasting bitterness in the aftertaste. In between is a little washed out. Mouthfeel is smooth. Not much alcohol (for a DIPA) and plenty of hop character, so its very drinkable. However, in the age of triple IPAs and (soon to be) quadruple IPAs, it might be a little dated -- especially for Stone.

But I think that's all this beer is: bitter. There was not a strong hop flavor, it had citrus characteristics and left you with a dry palate when you were done. Mouth feel was good, nice carbonation, body wasn't too heavy, well-balanced for the body. This is a good IPA but it does lack balance.

Malts back up the practically overwhelming hop profile very nicely, balances out well. Mouthfeel is smooth and slick, lighter end of the medium bodied scale, lower level of carbonation fits this IPA very well.

My pint looked great - clear, golden orange with a short white head of fine bubbles, thick solid lacing throughout. Big hoppiness in the aroma, plenty of grapefruit, a bit powdery. Strong bitterness with lots of orange and grapefruit. Also, a solid malt base that gives the balance necessary for a hop-bomb. Citrus is just in-your-face from the beginning until the last bits of the aftertaste - the hops just linger and linger and linger. There's also just a hint of warmth towards the end as well. Very nice. Silky texture with fine carbonation and a medium/light body. Dryness creeps in as well. This is a hop showcase. It's balanced enough to keep things together, but still an aggressive beer.

The taste was impressive to me in that, although the bitterness was strong and a strong hop flavor was found, this beer was not as overwhelming as I thought it would be. I expected a ridiculously bitter beer (similar to some bad batches of beer), but instead was greeted with a good malt flavor, biting hop flavor, and a high bitterness which actually blended quite well and wasn't too bad. The carbonation was medium and the mouthfeel was good with a hoppy bite to it. The drinkability was good, but in my opinion was not superb do to the fact that I believe the high hop taste would become overwhelming over time without a switch to a milder beer. Overall, I rate this beer as good and certainly worth a try. It has a very high hop characteristic and a high bitterness that makes for a good IPA.

Thus, with a bias toward "balanced" beers rather than more extreme offerings, and with a lukewarm response to Stone's Arrogant Bastard (which I find way too harshly bitter), I wasn't very optimistic about Stone's facefull-of-hops iconic DIPA. But man is this one outstanding beer! The hop aroma upon opening and pouring is indeed in your face. It's an aroma I enjoy while brewing beer, but much like black pepper and vanilla when cooking, I'd rather it be tempered and blended with other ingredients when actually drinking beer. In other words, not unpleasant, just out of place. But that's the last of my complaints. The bitterness is definitely pronounced, but the beer remains surprisingly drinkable. There are some really good sweet, biscuity malt undertones to this beer, as well as an appropriate amount of alcoholic warmth. Moreover, the longer one lingers over this beer, the more those malt aromas and flavors come through, making for an amazingly balanced beer (for something that claims >100 IBUs) and a relatively drinkable one, too, at least for a beer of its strength. I'm still not much of a fan of Stone's imagery (gargoyles, dare-you-to-drink-me marketing type/hype), but a great beer will always rise above its packaging.","petemorris","May 29, 2006"

Citrus, pine, and sweet malt-like overload! I could tell this one was gonna be something special. Palate didn't disappoint ... hardcore hop bitterness, overwhelmingly citrus fruit-laden complexity. Curiously, there is a decided sweet malt subtlety underneath all the hop heaviness as well. This one hits you hard, knocks you down, then picks you back up again. Incredibly complex ...not just a "let's see how much hop punch we can get in here" kind of brew. Finished very clean, with a lot of residual fruity notes, along with a pleasant hop aftertaste. I'd say this is medium-bodied, and only lightly carbonated. This is really a masterful double IPA in my estimation ... I'm fascinated with the sheer hop power this beer has, while managing to maintain a subtle malt character at the same time. The combination is very "juice-like" to me ... moreso as it warms a bit. An incredible brew. If you're into hops, get it NOW.

I'm not going to edit my scores because when this beer is fresh, it is incredible and worthy of the score I gave it. However, it must be drunk FRESH. Since the bottle doesn't have a freshness date (that I can see), it may be difficult to tell how fresh it is. You should probably inquire about how long it has been in the store before buying it.

It also leads to a less acidic, and how shall I say, less 'ruinous version of the brews. I know, Im a wuss. To those of you who down this stuff fresh by case when its fresh: I salute you.

Taste is exactly what you expect, huge juicy hops, grapefruit and citrus upfront, lingering pine and bitterness on the finish. Despite the massive amount of hops, a nice caramel malt tries to balance as well as it can. Medium/full bodied, moderate carbonation, and a very crisp finish.

The bitterness is so extreame that it gives the beer almost a burnt taste. Very full and chewy mouthfeel. I believe this is the first DIPA that has lived up to my expectations for hoppiness. Others have seemed to be too sweet but that is not a problem with this one. Don't get me wrong, there is a malt backbone to this that eventually works it's way into your perception but the highlight of this baby is the hops.

Orange, grapefruit, crushed pine needles, its all right up front, but not much in the way of any malt aromas to be found. A nice round mouthfeel with the subdued carbonation level keeping it silky smooth. Massive hop flavor profile; like biting into a whole grapefruit encrusted in honey and pine needles. Some faint crystal malt sweetness attempts to balance out the big muscle hops. Finishes with a big, bold and crisp bitterness; nice and long.

There's a certain doughy sweetness present in the scent, too. Grapefruit rind dominates the first sip. Bitter indeed, but certainly not out of line. More floral citrus nuances emerge as the beer warms. And a definite malt sweetness is apparent as well. Medium body, juicy mouthfeel. Maybe I like the hops a little too much, but my tongue isn't numb at all from this. While Ruination is a hop showcase, I wouldn't claim that it is at all out of balance. In fact, it's quite measured, all things considered. If it wasn't, it wouldn't be so damn easy to drink. Kick-ass bottle art, to boot.","orfeu","Feb 06, 2006"

It poured a wonderful dark golden color with a light, quickly fading head. Make sure you drink while there is still some head. The additional flavors you'll get from smelling the head as you drink are amazing. Besides the hops, I noticed citrus flavors. It reminded me of an orange bubble gum I had as a kid. Neither the beer nor the gum tasted much like oranges, but there was a hint of it. The only thing holding back the drinkability is the alcohol content. If this beer was around 5-6%, I could drink it all night. At 7.7%, one is probably enough.","badturtle","Jan 27, 2006"

Taste is hops of course, but also a good blst of citrus, hops are not overwhelming, but they are the main flavor. There has to be a decent amount of malt, but it is definitely in the backseat.

The smell is tough to describe, no real over the top hops, best I can describe the smell is musty. Taste is great, hops and fruit are very detectable and goes down real smooth. I could probably drink 2 bombers of this one but I would hope to do so at home or with a DD as its got quite an undetectable alcohol kick to it.","WeymouthMike","Jan 17, 2006"

The aroma is powerful - it jumps right out at you, a nice blend of soft citrusy hops, some woodiness and slight mustiness, and heavy malt, with a touch of esters. The flavor is powerful too; the hop bitterness and flavor coat your tongue and compliment the maltiness perfectly, and you also get hints of cherry, caramel, and alcohols. Very drinkable.

This was fantastic, pouring a transparent amber hue with a healthy white head on top. Smells of pure hoppy pine and spice, although a very moderate malty backgroud is persent. Tasted how it smells, like having a handful of hop buds in your mouth, oily and Uber-flavorful, but always balanced out by the perfect amount of malt which adds a biscuit like background.

There is not too much, rather there is just enough to make you notice that you are drinking a carbonated beverage.

There is a just a hint of sweet caramel malt flavor to properly balance the taste, but mostly just alpha hop oil obliteration. The carbonation is tiny and scarce, but the body is light; and that keeps the mouthfeel smooth enough to retain a good drinkability.

Bouquet is very floral but not excessively so. When discussing the taste it is logical to start with the hops, which are indeed powerful; yes, dominating too but not overpowering. There are good caramel-like malt qualities too. As the beer rises in temperature (my serving was perhaps a bit cold to start), the malt flavors become more pronounced, and the alcohol begins to warm the palate, giving an almost medicinal quality to an exceedingly dry IPA. The mouthful is very round, almost creamy, finishing very dry and quenching.

The foam that was produced was almost white with shades of an off white/cream color. It was thick and creamy in nature and sticky, it did not last very long which surprised me, and would like to have had it last deeper into the glass. Some lace was noticeable, but nothing really outstanding. The aromas that came from the glass were outstanding and very complex, tons of hop aromas, pine trees, citrusy notes (grapefruits), roasted malts, fruit, and hints of alcohol. The flavors were even better. The first flavors that hit your tongue are a creamy thick malt flavor, kind of toasted, then warming notes of alcohol are felt, fruits (pineapples, pears and grapefruits), then the hops - oh the hops - oh the flavors - herbs, citrus, flowers, fresh grass, pine trees, - oh the medly of flavors. All the flavors seem to blend together like 2 dancers. This beer finishes bready yeast and warming alcohol. Aftertaste was a melody of malts, hops, and bread, but warm from the smooth alcohol. The body was medium. Over all, a really really good beer, a must staple in the fridge. Stone knows how to brew a beer. Seems aging this beer mellowed it just slightly, one of the best out there. Nice and smooth.","Jarod","Dec 01, 2005"

4.4,2.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured from a 22 oz bomber, Ruination sits in my Stone IPA glass a nice clear golden color. A thick and rocky white head forms, filling the empty space of the glass. It's a very pretty presentation. As the head dissipates a great deal of lacing is left on the sides of the glass. The aroma is the first of the many intense sensory experiences this beer delivers. A huge grapefruit and citrus fruit aroma greets your nose with a very intense bitterness lying in the background. There is also a very apparent strong malt backbone that holds the whole beer up. The taste hits you like a freight train. Grapefruit and other citrusy fruits lead the charge followed by an intense bitterness. Underlying all this is a wonderfully nuanced malt base that is the equal of the intense hops. As intense as the hops and resulting bitterness are, it never seems harsh or abrasive. It just has the devestating, enamel-dissolving, tongue smacking, eye watering, tooth itching, tastebud killing, skin quivering hoppiness that hopheads adore and crave. For a beer this powerful, it is awfully drinkable. 22 ozs down the shoot before I know it, but the 7.7% catches up to me fast! Wow...what a great beer, a true experience.","Hagbard","Oct 30, 2005"

The smell during the pour in really enticing. Wet sweet with piney floral hops and mango. Some kind of frutiy ester mixes with the hop sting to make a really delicous aroma. To the nose, the fruity esters predominate over the hops, which are pithy piney. Peaches, oranges, honey malt. Tastes...hoppy bitter initially seems high, but then the thickness of the beer steps in and the bitter gets long in the tangle. Grapefruit pith is so strong it almost stings. It leaves the mouth with an chalky aspirin-like dryness. Behind the hops is the malt sweet. Noticable mostly, but poking it's head up for a view on occassion. Fruity esters are difficult to find. Peaches may be there, lost behind the hop bites. Thick chewy syrupy body with moderate carbonation. The aftertaste is flat out grassy hop bitter, accompanied by a touch of heartburn. Fairly enjoyable, but I don't need any more. The malt is so far below the hops that this beer is way out of balance. That's kinda to style, but not particularly drinkable.

This does have a nice sweet presence that is missing from way too many big beers these days, which helps to accompany the larger hop profile.

Unfortunately, for me, unless you are just a serious hop-maniac, a pint is more than enough for this brew. Maybe it is the ad copy on the bottle, but I can't really taste anything else but hops, even now. I guess it's unfair to say this beer has a "finish" at all. Maybe after a garlic clove and some Scope.

There is just enough malt to prevent this from being unbalanced in a bad way. As it is, this is unbalanced in a good way. The hops are a rainbow of citrus flavors, and they do run the entire gamut. Bitter oranges and lemons, grapefruits, and then, a slight pineyness at the end. The mouthfeel is light for the style, but it does coat one's throat. I must give this a lower drinkability than I would normally give the style because of the extreme hops. Do not drink this if are prone to heartburn, or face the consequences.

Mouthfeel is thick but velvety smooth and it coats the mouth well.

Just like the regular IPA, the head retention is remarkable, and the ale gives off sticky lacing. This is one wonderfully aromatic IPA. Pungent hops reek of citrous, pine, and herbs. Sweet esters compliement the bitter notes, while a little alcohol taunts. True to its name, the 100+ IBUs have probably ruined my taste buds (temporarily). Taste is deceptively floral at the beginning. However, that is quickly followed by axe-in-the-face hops. Very sharp grapefruit, orange peels, and pine riverdance on your tongue. Fortunately, Stone is not known for one-sided beers. The hops are balanced by generous amounts of malt and alcohol. Smooth malt, some toastiness, sweet caramel, and some spice break up the 100+ IBUs. Bold mouthfeel lets you know who is boss. Finish is spicy citrous, helped along with warming alcohol, pretty dry. A great double IPA, with some spice and noticable alcohol.","BeerFink","Jan 12, 2005"

This was a very clean looking beer with a clear golden color and a nice slightly off-white head. Head retention was minimal though the brew seemed to be pretty well carbonated. The smell was probably the most spectacular thing about this brew. I can't quit smelling it as I type. The scent is dominated by oranges and roasted hops. The taste is surprisingly well balanced considering that this beer boasts 100+ IBU's on the label. The bitterness is masked by a hint of orange and malts in the initial taste, and the aftertaste lets the hop resins stick to your mouth leaving you craving more long after the glass is empty. This is a fine I2PA and would make an excellent choice for any hop head.

Citrus aromas, piney, sticky hop resins, and floral. The color is a beautiful orange brown and a white head on top. First taste is the maltiness and the flavor from all those hops, then about 1/10 of a second later, the bitterness hits hard. I thought it was too bitter. I took me about 30 minutes to finish a 22oz. My burps smelled good though. It was an interesting beer, not sure if I think it should be at #19, but way too bitter for me. Maybe when I'm like 60 and my senses have dulled, then I can brave this brew again. I would definitely try it if you can get it.","dauss","Dec 09, 2004"

With fairly flat carbonation, the liquid sits a bit thick in the mouth. Taste? Yup, there are hops here. Slightly flowery, but mostly pine, there is bitterness from the start, gloriously smooth yet pronounced. Pine sap and espresso combine with a luscious sweet malt to inspire a delicious finish, then the hops come back to leave a dry bite that throws the salivary glands into overdrive long, long after the liquid disappears.

This bottle has been cellared for at least 6 months and may have mellowed a bit. The mouthfeel is pretty good, a bit thin for my taste in something this bitter.

Tastes of course, hoppy. Very bitter as well. It takes a little while for the sip to finally complete itself. First, there's the assault of hops on the tongue, then a brief flash of beery flavors, then followed up by a bitter dry finish all over the mouth and throat. After adjusting to the bitterness I can pick up on some other flavors, which is good. I thought this beer might just be hops hops hops, which is ok, but possibly boring. However about halfway down the glass the other flavors start to come out. A bit of alcoholic sweetness, mmmm. Probably a good idea to let this beer warm up for about 10 mins, to let the other flavors come out, otherwise it's all hops. All in all a great beer, it has multiple personalities.

Large grapefruit hops fade slightly into some spicy notes and a decent amount of malt was present as well. This was definetely not a one dimensional beer in my opinion.

The head lasts a good bit and decent sized chunks of lace were left about the glass, as it was consumed. Very hoppy nose here with citric grapefruit and floral notes galore. Not much else came through just hops, hops and more hops. The flavor was damn hoppy as well, bitter citric hops mainly dominated with a bit of earthy notes as well. This really grabs you tongue and doesnt let go very much the palette destroyer that ends in a long lasting dry bitter hoppy finish. Hmm this is pretty light on the tongue for a Double IPA, with a less than medium body to it. Drinkability is hurt a little by the lighter body but it is still good. I would definitely have this again, as the flavor definitely packs the hops you are looking for in this type of brew.","meathookjones","Sep 29, 2004"

4.65,8.1,4,4,5,4.5,5,"From a brown 22 oz. bottle picked up in Vegas, silk-screened label and the usual great original blurb on the back of the bottle. Enchanting light copper hue, like the sun just popping over the horizon first thing in the morning on a clear day. Decent white head with good retention, it leaves a fair amount of lacing. For a beer with this amount of IBU's the aroma is deceivingly light and floral, with hints of citrus and spice. The flavour also starts mild for the slightest moment, and then the hops sucker-punch you in all their glory, so fresh and vibrant that you are nearly picking leaves out of your teeth after swallowing. Intense at first, but then mellowing out towards the finish in layers of different characteristics, concluded with another kick on the finish. A lot of art, science and religion went into perfecting this symphony of hops, and a whole lotta love as well, to rip off Robert Plant. The more I drink it, the more I crave, this confirms that I have truly crossed over to the dark side...er, I mean have become an official hophead. As it warms the malt starts to make an appearance at first sip, a rich biscuity malt that blends seamlessly in with the dominating hops, and then appears once again on the aftertaste in a citrusy tango. Stone has done an exceptional job on this IPA, it is not merely a one-dimensional free-for-all of excessive hops, they've managed to blend a complex and layered beer for those in the know. A rites of passage for hopheads. Full and rich mouthfeel, not oily or sticky for a moment, true alchemy. The next time I am in the U.S. I shall be loading my suitcase with this stuff. It's like falling in love all over again, I haven't felt this euphoric since I managed to see the Pixies live on their reunion tour this year.","IronDjinn","Sep 22, 2004"

Aroma surprises for its not nearly as intense as its made out to be. Straight hops hit the nostrils, earth like, citrus like and mostly fuelic. In mouth, flavors are intense, but hard to put words on. Its very perfumey, somehow leathery, acid, fuelic. Generous alcohol vapours come through. Fine body helps the drinkability a lot with its adequate medium carbonation, but if not thin, its definitely not full. Miles away from a yulesmith or dreadnaughts flexibility. Mostly pure hoppiness and I found nothing to mention about the malt although theres a considerable bill felt.","Rastacouere","Sep 19, 2004"

Tastes slightly of malt, but the main flavor is a delicate balance of what must be many, many varieties of hops. It creates a nice balance overall, but is clearly very well hopped. Finishes very dry with a slight aftertaste that I cannot place. The belch seems to ring of mint or some other herb. Mouthfeel is slightly thicker than I expect for the style, but it is not surprising considering the extensive hugeness of this offering. Overall, this is one of the best beers I've ever tasted.

There's lots of citrusy hops and cedar sweetness with a touch of honey malts, quite similar to its younger sibling, the regular Stone IPA. The mouthfeel is medium thin, and the taste is deliciously intricate: hoppy, a bit of syrup undertow, and with good tight bitternesss at the finish. Not as potent as the Dreadnaught or the I2PA, but you still get a clear sense of high alcohol in the taste.","longpondbeerman","May 25, 2004"

Up front was that syrupy Double IPA sweetness, which morphed into a more piney bitter taste, but towards teh finsh and aftertaste was a serious toasty flavor more akin to a british beer or a softer New England IPA.

Starts off citrusy then the malt balances it a bit and finishes with the piney floral hops.. This is one hoppy hoppy brew.. Never overwhelming, just a punch of hop love. As the label says dont bother with anything you want to taste after drinking this as your taste buds have been scrubbed into nubs.. Have one of these then have a couple of those Macros that got left behind in your fridge and you wont be able to tell. Hop burps are off the chart on this one.

4,-7,4,4,4,4,4,"Clear coppery honey-peachy in hue with a noticeable ruby glow, the slightly off-white head reached a sticky finger in height. This is an attractive looking beer. The head retention was decent; it faded to a soapy jumble after some time. The subsequent lacing was sporadic and unorganized. The aromas of the bouquet unleash a wrath of citrusy-piney-flowery hops, caramel sweetness underneath. The potency is solid; I found the smells to be inviting but not earth shattering. The palate is tasty; the huge angry hoppiness is so impressively mouth-filling. Before I can even swallow if feels like I have a bushel of freshly picked hops resting squarely on my tongue. The bitterness is formidable but the flavors are very delicious, hugely piney with citrus notes working in conjunction, flowery underneath. The heat of the alcohol is obvious and it imparts some flavor. The harshness is moderate. Pleasant rawness. Maybe this is an inherent flaw of the IIPA but where is the malt delicacies? I wasnt that impressed with the Stone IPA either; this is a bigger beer and, yes, a better beer. I cant refute how yummy the hops are, I just want more malt or even a better blend of hops. 3Fs Dreadnaught manages to be a better-crafted hop monster. I do love IIPAs but I find them hard to review but very fun and enjoyable to drink. Drinking these beers are like going to the driving range a ripping your Big Bertha driver 300 yards over and over again. Yeah its fun but it isnt golf! I want to drive, chip, and putt. In other words, the complexities are lacking, it is just hops. The mouthfeel is medium/medium full with prickly carbonation.

Nose is very floral and pungent hops with notes of pine, cedar, and a bit of fresh citrusquite sniffable. Even from the first sip, the bitter hops are an assault upon all your taste budsacidic grapefruit rind blended with pine oils followed by raw hop leaves and slick hop resins that coat the entire inside of your mouth and throat and do not go away until you take another drink. Once the initial bite of the hops subsides a bit, some notes of juicy citrus fruit and sweet malt are also noticeable. An absolutely exceptional IPA. The warning on the bottle that your palate will be completely ruined after you drink is quite true; so since I am currently unable to taste anything else, what am I to do?

I get citrus notes mixed with a floral character and even some earthy scents to. Very diverse hop presence. First sip reveals a prickly carbonation and medium bodied brew. Flavor is similar to aroma with hop dominance, some sour notes make me pucker a little and the finish is very dry and piney, makes me want to take another sip.

Citrusy, piney resinous hops. In fact, if I take too deep of a breath, I can feel an itch on my soft pallet the aroma is so strong. The taste is more of the same - hops, hops and more hops. You can feel the hop oils trickling down your throat - don't believe anyone who says this beer is balanced. It has enough malt to have a good, heavy mouthfeel (and high ABV), but I'll be damned if I can taste any of it. Probably the hoppiest beer I've ever had or will have.","ColForbin","Oct 27, 2003"

Also, there is some citrus going on. There's also some pine and a touch of malt. Taste is absolutely hoppy. Starts out floral. The name of the beer is "Ruination" because it ruins your tastebuds after the first few sips. This is dead on. Eventually this goes to malt, and finally it ends earthy. Medium-bodied.

Of course it is quite bitter, but in no way is it out of balance, quite remarkable for that in fact. The hop flavor is crawling out of this beer all over the place. The bitterness stays with you after one swallows. A complex floral, orangey (though only slightly), apricot (but just a hint) mix of flavors. It is like sucking the nectar from an aromatic-fruity, but not particularly sweet, flower on some unspecified aromatic herb (of course this would be a hop). Effectively saturates one's taste buds as the bottle has promised. I am still struck by the fact that, though this is utterly bitter and hoppy, it is not perceived to be too over the top.

Grapefruit rind and piney notes, just a bit of sweetness from the malt riding beneath, as well as some honey and butterscotch, but it barely peeks out.

Smell was nice and hoppy, but not overly so--it smelled like a good regular IPA does--only with a little more alcohol fumes present. Taste? WOW. Just as I remembered. Initially slight malts fighting hopelessly against an increasing hoppiness. As it goes down, the bitterness reaches maximum threshold levels and stays around whether you like it or not. Even though the bitter hops are unbelievably over-the-top, this brew is balanced enough to easily let me finish all 22 hop-bursting ounces. Mouthfeel is great--just right.

I liked the ABV, which is well hidden and provides a nice buzz (literally!). A wonderful smell, a nice fruity taste. Mouthfeel is dry and bitter, and this is certainly a hop-heads' dream. I am not, however, a hophead. I enjoy this kind of beer on occasion, and it is as good as most (I like the Two-Hearted and the Alesmith more), but if you're into this style, seek it out.

The head is meringue in consistency with very good retention and lacing. Carbonation is mild to moderate. Aroma is very floral, fresh green hops with a complex, pleasant, and fresh aromatic quality to them. There is a brief glimpse of some toasty caramunich notes if you close your eyes and concentrate really hard. Everything else that may be there is completely overpowered by the hops. Mouthfeel is smooth with a wet finish and moderate acidity. Taste begins suprisingly with smooth malts, then acrid, pungent floral flavor hops..a wave of peppery drying alcohol assaults the mouth, followed by a toasty, then raisiny malt note appears towards the end. The finish is of potent, unbalanced herbal bitterness. Again, this is another intense brew from Stone, but completely out of balance which severely inhibits drinkability. This is a decent brew, but in my opinion, it is way overrated. A ton of hops does not a good beer make.","Mitchster","Jun 22, 2003"

Enough about the appearance, because I quickly forgot about it as soon as I caught a whiff of the aroma. It was a combination of citrus and clove, and it was wonderful. I found myself sniffing all the way down to the last drop and then took a couple more from an empty glass. Bitter is a word that I would never use to describe the taste. It was well hopped, but by no means over hopped. Along the burst of hops, it also tasted like it smelled, citrus & clove was an undertone to the flavor.

Personally, I do not find these types of beers "bitter" in the traditonal sense of the word, I find them very flavorfull. And this brew is no exception.

It only lacks a little malt complexity in the flavor, the malt seems a bit basic but does hold up well to the hop explosion. A great hop directed brew.","jeffboo","Mar 25, 2003"

The taste EXPLODES with citrousy hops, all the while hanging on to a strong malt backbone and an inviting alcohol warmth. Lemon jumps out at me, then the sweetness of the malt comes in to fill things out. Nice lingering taste of citrous. I could drink a ton of this..the consequences are worth it!

Citrus, pine, and maybe some cedar planking in there. Hops overpower the malt, leaving it a little unbalanced, but that is what I have had a taste for lately, it seems. A very large IPA, to say the least.","goz","Jan 13, 2003"

4.7,9.3,5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"Wow!!! I have finally gotten ahold of the Ruination IPA, and I feel that there is so much anticipation behind the rating of this beer. First of all, I love this style and equally important it is brewed by Stone. IMO Stone brewing is revolutionary from the Bastard to the Smoked Porter. So, here it goes, the beer is poured into an official Stone Brewing Co. Pint glass leaving about two fingers of head. A deep copper goldish tint is the hue that this beer represents. As the gargoyle on the bottle stares at me, I attempt my first sip of this creation. WIth my first gulp, I took a deep breath to absorb all of the hop aroma that engulfed my senses. The hop aroma is a floral, citrusy, and earthy mixture of wonderful hops, with a sharp sweetness to the nose it bitters as it splashes down on my tongue with the welcoming bitterness (100 + IBU's) a trace of sweet maltiness tags along to balance out the beer to become a masterpiece. On the back of this bottle there is a warning of the what this beer can do to the palate. I agree that it is hilarious, and that I would not start out with this beer at tasting event. However, it is not to overwhelming for my tastes.... I love hops. If this beer and the Dogfish Head 90 min IPA were tried side by side a lot would be confused about which be was delivering which flavor. I think they are both sickeningly yet amazingly hoppy, yet I think I prefer the 90 min IPA. Definitely amazing a must try for all beer advocates.","WVbeergeek","Jan 06, 2003"

"Oh that smell" To quote Lynard, "Tis hops" that greets your nose, chased by a bit of malt and a lemon-lime crispness, quite a Hoot. A tad sweet at the start and the top middling in mouth feel with the finish survigrously hopped with a hard-hitting acidity and a devastatingly dry hop bitter aftertaste.

I don't think I can do this one justice or add to what has already been said, but this is one big, bad, malty, insanely hoppy, kick-ass beer that has everything I love in beer. When you pour this mother out, you can tell it is thick and malty and will have the mouthfeel of syrup. The grapefruity, floral, earthy, and herbal hop aromas can be smelled from across the room. After I poured my first pint, my roomate asked if I had been brewing earlier, and said he could smell the hops as soon as he walked in the room. The flavor of this beer is the closest I have come to heaven. The hop flavors are demanding of your attention by hitting you in the face as well as exhibiting some complex subleties. I detect some grapefruit flavors, pineapple, and pine needles in the hop profile. The bitterness is there but not as bad as you would think because the ultra sweet malt sure subdues it. The malt background is sweet like molasses with some buttery and butterscotch flavors that seem to melt in your mouth. All in all a greatly complex beer that is so drinkable for all of its bigness. All other beers taste like water in comparison.","Longstaff","Dec 17, 2002"

This is a big beer, wonderfully balanced. Despite the high hoppiness, the hops never seem overbearing and seem nicely balanced with the slightly fruity background. Dense, creamy mouthfeel is superb.

I should have waited for a more opportune time to crack open the Ruination but I simply could not resist. First of all, is there a brewery with better packaging and narrative on the bottle? I don't think so. The beer pours golden and slightly cloudy with a big thick head with major staying power. The head thickly laces the pint glass all the way down. Despite my headcold that lovely pungent hop aroma makes it through. And from the first taste I know I'm drinking something special. A little tart, a little sharp. The taste evolves and transitions as it works its way over the tonque and down the throat. Ripe melon to grapefruit. Beautiful citrus and herbal notes. Nicely dry and very, very hoppy but in my view not over-hopped. A true hophead, I have never tasted an overhopped beer. It's an abstract concept to me.

No, the malt isn't a big player, but it rings the hops down to the point that they aren't as overwhelming as you are expecting.

The flavor is also boldy full of citrusy, grassy and earthy hops including flavors of orange, peach, and tangerine. But there is also some distinct, sweet caramel malt present beneath the hops. This beer is big! Truly an assault on the senses! INTENSE. RICH. FULL. Definitely a "one beer" beer - especially in the 22 ounce bottle! And yet it's balanced with enough sweet malt that you don't fall over with "bitterface"! However, the alcohol might get you to fall over at a full 7.7% by volume. Astonishing!

Piney hop aroma that embraces the nose almost affectionately. Although, the color has a decent copper ale'ish hue to it, I can still read what is on the other side of the glass.

There are hops aplenty, but they are intricately layered upon a wonderful malt foundation. In fact, I am almost as impressed by the subtle sweetness as I am by the over-the-top pine and citrus hop flavors.

The hops ride in on a a soft and smooth malt blanket, but the assault is not far behind. As is characteristic of these types of hops, very strong citrus/orange peel-like and floral taste.

I half expected a mushroom cloud to form over the bottle when I popped the top.  Aroma was peppery hops.  I braced myself and took the first sip (gulp, actually).  To my surprise, the hops were quite smooth and very well balanced with the malt - and the hops, although powerful, are not at all overwhelming.  In comparison with Stone's IPA, the hops in Ruination are not as grapefruity, and tended to have more of a herbal character.

As the brew begins to warm the malt character of the beer really shows up and balnces this brew very nicely.  There are more juicy fruit flavors as well but they are subdued by the dominant hops.

Although the bitterness is expectedly assertive, it is accompanied by a surprisingly rich, toasty, lightly buttery, malt backbone. The citrusy hop flavor comes as no surprise, but is very well integrated into the overall flavor profile. Smooth mouthfeel, with a full, dextrinous body. Finishes w/ a bittersweet balance of hop bitterness and residual malt sweetness. Ruination is an exceptional IPA that showcases American hops, but malt character is not at all lacking.

Still I was afraid of this beer because of all the talk of it being over 100 IBUs. Then I crack it open. Sure it's huge hops (black pepper, citrus peel and flowers) but not as much as I was expecting. I take a big swig and ... it goes down easily. It's kind of cool how the bitterness and most of the flavor is time delayed. The huge flavor doesn't hit until right about the time I swallow. You get a bit of malt at the beginning and some more in the end as the beer warms, but the hoppage overpowers it. I'm still burping the hops 4 hours later.","aracauna","Jul 12, 2002"

It has a nice fairly chunky mouthfeel for an IPA, but the bitterness detracts a bit from the drinkability.  The 5th Anniversary IPA is quite a bit better IMO.","mickeymac","Jun 12, 2002"
