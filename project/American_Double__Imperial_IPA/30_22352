There is also a good amount of pineapple and mango. Green apple and a sweet, bready malt. The flavor is intensely malty, but it has enough bitterness to support it. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy.

Smell is citrus heavy, with lots of grapefruit mixed in with a bit of caramel malt. Some pine as well. Taste leads with malts and a good deal of bitterness. Wonderfully sweet caramel malt lingers on the tongue after the first sip. The citrus comes booming through in the aftertaste-- a great sequence of flavor. A tiny bit of alcohol bite. Pine comes through more as it warms. Bitterness really sticks on the tongue. A little bit of breadiness comes through at the end. Despite the bitterness it is quite easy to drink. Not a lot of carbonation. A bit resinous. Overall, this stuff is like candy. It won't knock you on butt like the most powerful DIPAs, but it still balances strong taste with balance, and is very easy to drink.","majorbase2","Sep 26, 2014"

I love IPA's as it is, but this one looks so damn pretty, feels like water and tastes like some of Maharaja's gold. I would highly recommend it for, well...anything but a day in the sun. I encourage anyone google searching this reference while standing in front of a frosty glass cooler at Specs or Gabriel's or wherever, to go ahead and reach back into the cooler and add a necessary 8 bucks to your bill.","ASirahSyrah","Jul 31, 2014"

Lots of really intense hoppy notes, thick piney and grapefruit with a strong liveliness as well, smooth malt body, an excellent DIPA. Worth seeking out, very complex and tasty.","mick303","Jun 02, 2014"

There is a mild hoppy tastes up front with a strong, malty, boozy aftertaste. It goes down very smooth. Definitely a beer for cold weather. Will warm you up like a Brandy or Congac. Very little hoppy aftertaste. Definitely a beer you want to sip by a warm fire.","jngrizzaffi","Apr 20, 2014"

Bold balance and depth throughout with eye-popping zest to please the palate. I get additional flavor notes of apricot and dried peaches for some additional fruit-like notes.

The visual was of an dark maple syrup hue with slow flowing micro bubbles that cling to the edge of the class with a death grip.  Strong hoppy taste with some pine, clearly and imperial IPA.

Nice complex nose of citrus (grapefruit, mango, orange) and spruce hops over a rich caramel background. Almost full bodied with a creamy texture and a slightly above normal carbonation level that has a bit of effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is complex, but a bit unbalanced due to the alcohol content bite. It begins with the hop flavors of the nose, flows to a rich caramel sweetness which is accompanied by a medium well rounded bitterness. It progresses to the finish where alcohol predominates over a residual sweetness, leaving an alcohol burn on the tongue and back of the throat. While outstanding, it could be improved by reducing the alcohol content a percent or two to achieve better balance.","tillmac62","Apr 01, 2014"

The nose is wonderfully complex bouquet of honey, pine, grapefruit, passion fruit, lime and malt. The thick malty sweetness acts as a backbone for both the high alcohol and bitterness of the hops. Layering over the malty sweetness are again flavors of grapefruit and resin/pine with hints of honeysuckle and mint. The after palate one this beer lasts forever, with a pleasant dance of malt and bitterness lingering on your tongue. An absolute delight to drink and revisit.","TheBullsHorn","Oct 14, 2013"

At first sip, I feel that these combination of these will keep it from being a DIPA I truly enjoy, as I usually go for more hop forward. However, the caramel and earth give way to a bit of spice and the hint of juicyness from the nose, orange seems to be the most noticable citrus. Has an incredible bready, juicy, resinous aftertaste that lingers and to me, makes the time in between sips even better than the sips themselves. Has a heavy mouthfeel, average for a DIPA, and high carbonation, above average for a DIPA.","JG-90","Aug 14, 2013"

The taste brings in more of the same, with a heavier influence of grapefruit and pine, a more caramel-y tone in the backbone, and some grass tossed in for good measure. The body is a solid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a fine and dandy hop bomb, indeed.","TMoney2591","May 12, 2013"

It's heavy on the malts which I appreciate, bringing a nice balance, but its not too overloaded with hoppy bitterness like Double Crooked Tree is. In this DIPA, the malts are the stars of the show here, with the hops contributing the atmosphere and lighting. It's somewhat like a very hopped up barleywine that is a bit less malty than typical barleywines. Drinks well, very complex and enjoyable- and different than the typical west coast DIPAs that I've had. It's a bigger, more complex version of the DFH 90 min. (4)","Stevedore","May 03, 2013"

Definitely an extreme IPA that has a good citrus flavor to it, as well as comfortable mouthfeel, but a lot of these aromas and flavors are really doing strange stuff when they meld with one another. I feel that this may have been an older batch but I still think a beer this monstrous should hold up just fine. If you like your IPAs super dank and earthy and don't mind several irregularities as I mentioned above, give this a shot. Wasn't a fan but I'd be open to have a fresher batch if given the opportunity.","magictacosinus","May 02, 2013"

I also tend to like more carbonation in my I DIPA, the mouthfeel of this was definitely short of what I was wanting.

Pours crystal clear orange amber color with a 2 finger dense off white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, pine, tangerine, pineapple, lemon, orange rind, caramel, floral, grass, pine resin, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of dank hop notes with moderate malt sweetness; with slight alcohol as it warms. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, tangerine, pine, floral, grass, honey, light caramel, pine resin, and floral earthiness. Nice amount of citrus and pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, pine, floral, grass, honey, light caramel, pine resin, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance and complexity of citrus and pine hop flavors; with a near perfect malt balance that does not overwhelm; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a light creamy, slick, and very sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic DIPA! Great balance and complexity of hop notes with nice malt balance; and dangerously smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering as expected.","superspak","Apr 02, 2013"

However, this has been a favorite of mine, and one I look forward to picking up every Spring. Easy to find when it's released if you can get Avery in your area. Price is somewhat reasonable for a bomber at $7.99 in my area. Would definitely recommend seeking this one out.","hermit990","Apr 02, 2013"

There is a strong floral/piney hop smell and taste that is complemented by a sturdy malt backbone making the beer sweeter than mos of the DIPAs I've tried. Sticky fizzy mouth feel. Pine resin aftertaste lingers. Beer is orange-gold with a thick off-white head that coats the glass in cottony lacing all the way down.

The first sip totally enveloped my tongue like a warm comforter would my body in a cold winter day! The flavors of star fruit, grapefruit and blood orange with hints of mango are unmistakable and delightful with the blood orange and grapefruit lingering long after the sip is gone! This beer left me wanting more because of how delicious it is but be careful, at 10.4 ABV this beer will sit you down in a hurry! This is certainly one of those powerhouse beers you must take your time with to enjoy! Avery has hit it out of the park with this one! If you are a fan of the Troeg's Nugget Nectar then you will like this beer! It's like the Nugget Nectar on steroids! Well done Avery and thanks to the West Reading Tavern in West Reading, PA for serving it on tap!","BeerHo","Mar 12, 2013"

3.85,-9.2,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"22oz bottle. Crystal clear amber with a big off white head. Big all-hop aroma: grapefruit, citrus. Very American IPA so far. Big all-hop flavor too. I'm really enjoying the combination of floral, citrusy, and spicy hop flavors along with a little bit of bite. The finish is actually a little bit creamy...yeah, I'd bet the final gravity on this one is higher than many IPAs start fermentation at. But if this beer has any flaws, they're in the finish. It's too oily, and along with the high residual sugar and alcohol, it limits drinkability. But making a double/imperial IPA this well balanced is a feat and Avery has made something I'm happy to drink. Even if I still like Dogfish better. :P","hreb","Mar 08, 2013"

It's kinda like Devil Dancer light in a way (I don't know why that stood out in my mind but it did). Lots of big, sharp hop flavors and aromas and with a huge malt base to back it up. Honestly balanced pretty well but then again I am pretty neck-deep in hops most days. To a newbie it would probably be overpowering (I remember having this years ago, it was almost undrinkable).

I really enjoy DIPA's (or any of pale ale styles) that do not try to overwhelm the drinker with pure hop power, but actually have a flavor and balance to them. That being said, this beer, as I mentioned, is literally like drinking a strong malty beer combined with a DIPA. It has such good flavor. Highly recommended, will drink and buy again.","TheCondor","Jan 26, 2013"

Smell is heavenly, floral, sweet caramel, bready hops, overpowering. Taste is resinous, with pine hops, some fruit, caramel and malt. It's super sweet, with loads of texture. Mouthfeel is smooth, light carbonation. Overall great beer. It's not something I could have over and over again, but I thoroughly enjoy it on occasion. One of my top Imperials.

This is a very hoppy beer, so if you really don't get into the hops, you won't enjoy it.  It is also sweeter in flavor than most DIPAs I've had.  But if you've established your buds to handle the strong IBU, you are going to really enjoy this beer.  It is strong, and it hit me rather hard, so I would recommend a slow and cautious session.  But this is definitely a beverage I will find and buy again.","CrazyQuaker","Oct 19, 2012"

It also looks like there is some “stuff” floating in this. Interesting. On the nose, I get a lot of pine and grapefruit and a hint of sweetness on the end. On the taste, the first thing that I get is pine, then grapefruit and then another taste that I can’t really identify. I think it’s caramel or some nuttiness? This nuttiness hangs around until the finish and lingers for a while. The alcohol in this brew is significant, but it is insanely well hidden. This is a very enjoyable IPA. This brew was 102 IBUs, but doesn’t hit you in the face with hops. This would be up there are one of the best Imperial IPAs that I’ve had.

But I still love the appearance and smell, and the taste is very nice for a DIPA, really nice mouthfeel too, carb is perfect. I definitely recommend this, especially if you can get your hands on a fresh bomber - enjoy!","blackcompg","Aug 17, 2012"

Nose is unsurprisingly hoppy, fairly floral, a little bit of booze. Taste is very rich with tons and tons of hop bitterness and not so much hop flavor. The good news here is that it allows the beer to present a focus of balance between the bitter and the sweet, which it accomplishes fairly well while also hiding its alcohol for the most part. Nice dry finish. The body is great, medium to heavy, and it isn't too sticky or viscious, however, carbonation could definitely be bumped up. All in all, an absolute keeper, but not in my personal hall of fame. Could definitely see where it would make it into someone else's though.","kc44","Apr 10, 2012"

The taste sticks in your mouth for a while after the fist sip, and the boozy finishes sticks with you as well, but is not at all offensive. The batch of fourteen is danker, and heavier in taste. The dankness and burnt caramel flavors shine through, but does not have the piney grassy finish that the 15 did. The fourteen was prickly and drying as well, but not so much as the fresher batch 15 was. I am suprised that I like the older bottle a little better than the fresher one. Overall I enjoyed both bottles and would purchase this beer again. Good job Avery brewing company. Edit: Upon a second pour after the beer had warmed a bit it holds a head quit nicely and has now warmed to the point that resinous piney hops are shining through, coating my entire mouth and destroying my ability to taste. The fifteen is now drinking like the hop bomb it should. That'll learn me for reviewing too cold a beer. Thanks Avery Brewing Company.","bebbcorp","Mar 31, 2012"
3.88,-8.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall I thought that this was a good beer and a good example of a DIPA, the flavor was pretty damn intense, I have no problem classifying this as a palate wrecker. This beer doesn't have that good of drinkability, the bomber was a little too much for me to handle, I am sure I can drink it all but I think this beer is much better suited to be split with somebody that likes DIPA's, but I always finish what I start so this bad boy is going down. What I like most about this beer was the way it looked and the heavy grapefruit aroma, they were both pretty damn good. What I liked least about this beer was that it was a little rough around the edges, if the body was a little smoother and if the flavors blended a little better this would be a very good DIPA. If I wanted to get a palate wrecking DIPA for a decent price to split with somebody I may be inclined to purchase this again, but I think I would rather have Hop Stoopid, instead and it's cheaper. If you are a fan of DIPA and want something that is going to wreck your palate this beer is for you. This is one solid DIPA, but it isn't refined enough to be a top tier DIPA, I like it but there are more then a few DIPA's that I would rather have. Avery is one solid brewery, I haven't had anything from them that I would consider less then good, but I have yet to be truly wowed by their big beers, lucky for me they make a bunch of big beers so they have more then a couple chances to wow me with some of them and you can be sure I will buy them if they make it to a store near me, solid beer, keep up the good work guys, Avery is my favorite Colorado Brewery, they aren't afraid to take chances and I like that, I don't like a boring and very predictable brewery, Avery is not one of those.","StoutHunter","Mar 30, 2012"

The nose hosts plenty of west coast style IIPA notes plus a slew of Chinook-like herbal, almost garlic presence. Not oniony or unpleasant (like Green Flash's Imperial... save that for another review) - it's just a bit more earthy than a traditional west coast IIPA, it's a nice change of pace. The taste is balanced but still aggressive. I don't know what hops are at play here but, to me, every hop highlight has its place in this beer - herbal, spicy, floral, citrus, spruce. A part of me wishes that this beer would take a direction of its own, but most of me is enjoying the hell out of it as it is.","yamar68","Mar 22, 2012"

Moderate hop aroma with hints of grapefruit and malt. Taste is hop forward at the start and middle, with a nice sweet malt base. Hops are not as aromatic as other top DIPAs, but are pleasant and distinctive. After the hops and malt subside, an odd bitter almost dry-sour finish that detracts a bit from the overall impression. Quite boozy and warming. Medium bodied Except for the slight off-taste on the finish, a very nice DIPA experience. I would certainly buy this again.","LiquidAmber","Mar 22, 2012"

This is a cloudy beer, with particles of sediment circulating amidst the carbonation. Topped with a beautiful head, artistic larger bubbles arranged in a sea of fine foam, the Maharaja is a joy to behold. The aroma holds up its end with a nice mix of hop spice tones and sweet malt notes. The only way to describe the flavor is balance. Many IPA’s start out with malt and then the hops kick in at the finish. With the Maharaja, the malt and the hops work together throughout the experience. There is lots of complexity, and many flavors, but all work well together. The warmth of the alcohol is noticeable, and the aftertaste has a touch of bitter. So yes, this is exceptional ale, but there are a few signature four packs of Double IPAs that are in the same league.","iSip","Feb 03, 2012"

Weighing in at a heft 10.39% ABV and whopping 102 IBU's, Maharaja from Avery Brewing Company in Boulder, CO pours a hazy orange-amber color, featuring a slightly off-white head that provides a great deal of lacing throughout. A BIG citrus hop nose mingles with bready malt notes as well as occasional whiffs of piney and resiny hop aromas. The flavor of this brew stays close to the aromas we picked up on, with faintly toasted malt flavors blending beautifully with the citrusy hop characteristics before finishing with a smooth and well balanced finish. Maharaja shows a medium body with a tongue-prickling carbonation. Another in the great Dictator Series from Avery.","phishsihq","Jan 20, 2012"

3.95,-6.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was how well it aged.

The hops held up astonishingly well, offering a great balance with the malts, making for a clean and thorough DIPA.","TheBrewo","Jan 10, 2012"

4.23,-0.2,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a wide-mouthed wine glass (which in retrospect may not have been the best choice). It has a murky golden color with a little barely visible effervescence. In this glass it has very little head and minimal retention and lacing but that would probably be different in a pint or a tulip. The odor is not particularly appealing but not bad- it smells of piney hops and also has a similar odor to hop-trub (the remains of hops after they've been boiled before fermentation). The taste is a constant barrage of hops- piney, citrusy, and overall pretty bitter. Has a nice long finish. The mouthfeel is perfectly appropriate- a little oily with good solid carbonation. A fine example of an Imperial IPA .","Hopdaemon39","Jan 07, 2012"

4.47,5.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is definitely the hoppiest beer I've ever had. It poured a cloudy copper orange color with a pillowed white head. It had the scent of bitter hops. The taste was hops and more hops. It started out bold with sweet tasting hops and gradually worked to finish bitter and dry. Definitely a full, long lasting tasteful beer. If you are not a fan on hoppy beers, definitely one to avoid, but I really liked it!","Lemke10","Nov 16, 2011"

The extensive cellared/shelved age of this bottle likely softened much of the upfront hop aromas and bitterness (as judged by other reviewers comments). However, as a fan of barleywines as well, I really enjoy how this beer seemingly weaves in and out of the DIPA/barleywine boundaries.","Uhlikm","Sep 26, 2011"
3.98,-6.1,4,3.5,4,5,4,"My local shop owner kept telling me to try it so I did. It poured very smooth and as I poured it It smelled like a grapefruit but not overpowering in the smell. The beer settled into a very rich and deep amber color with a small off white foam head that didn't stick around more than a minute. The beer taste like a tangerine infused with a bitter grapefruit and left my mouth feeling moist and refreshed. I enjoyed it and allowed it to get warm and it was still a delicious beer.","MandatoryJimmy","Sep 25, 2011"

Heavy citrus...flat out grapefruit dominated. Some caramel and malty notes blend in. The taste is a winner too. All the aromas come out to play on the palate. This beer tastes like it smells. The caramel and malt notes are more pronounced, especially upon the finish. The mouthfeel lets you know they weren't fuckin' around with this. It's boozy. It doesn't necessarily taste 10.46 ABV, but you know it's packin'. For being an 102 IBU beer, I don't get the bitterness or hoppiness I'd expect from the number. Overall this is a tasty beverage. I'll seek this out again.","Retail1LO","Sep 21, 2011"

3.87,-8.7,5,3,4,4.5,4,"Pours a beautifully clear dark copper with a one and a half creamy head. The aroma is bizarre. It smells like mango cereal. The cereal graininess is very off-putting to me and I don't get much of a hop aroma at all. The taste is nothing like the smell. I get tons of mango and papaya. The graininess is nowhere in the taste. This ale is pretty sweet, but insanely bitter at the same time. In a weird way this beer is balanced. Overall a good experience. I don't know what's up with the aroma, but the taste is well worth it. DuganA is much better and drinkable IMHO. A nice DIPA and I may enjoy this better fresh.","hmf05","Sep 11, 2011"

4.7,10.8,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Strong aroma is very hoppy, nearly evergreen, with a firm citrus underpinning that is mainly grapefruit with some sour orange. It pours a beautiful clear coppery brown with a thick and fluffy pale copper head. Scrumptious and highly pleasing hoppy flavor has tones of grapefruit, orange and caramel, with a hint of sweetness that perfectly balances the hoppy bitterness. Full-bodied texture is quite fizzy and lively, leaving a lip-smacking tingly, hoppy, slightly sweet finish. Strongly recommended to all IPA fanatics.","Cyberkedi","Sep 09, 2011"

3.95,-6.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"O - This is a pretty darn good IPA, but as weird as it sounds I would like to see more bitter hop prominence (it is claimed to be 102 IBU, after all). The unbalance between hop and malt is what makes imperial IPA's so great, and this one is almost a bit cloyingly sweet in the malt department which tends to dominate the flavor profile.

"A little something for your troubles." he presses a crisp $100 bill into your hand, for what? Bringing some cumbersome trunk to the front foyer? This is treatment you can handle, and somehow welcome. He walks and surveys the split landing of the threadbare banister. "THIS WILL NOT DO." running a finger lightly over the worn wood, he looks to you for approval, you somehow gain a sense of commoradery in his majesty, knowing the complexity in his thought and manner, here you just a vagrant chimney sweep moments ago, now bitterly at the receiving end of his jansenist nature. "What do you feel this is a vestibule for peregrine mendicants? obtain your composure and tend to the rest of my articles, as resolutely as I am sure you are capable." That was his way, you saw him cooly surverying the premises in his ivory suit, casuistically wiping the sweat from his brow in a manner that showed poise and decisiveness. The drying extraction of his remarks place you in a humble yet hopeful state, not unlike a teeball coach whom you welcome the reprimand if only for a dose of the gratifying approval.

Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. Aroma is mostly citrusy (mango, grapefruit, orange) hops, along with some pine hops and caramel malt. For the most part the taste mirrors the aroma. The citrusy hop flavors are dominant, but the caramel malt flavor is stronger than I thought it was going to be. With that being said, it's still a very tasty brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's slick and creamy with moderate carbonation. It's also smooth and goes down pretty easy.

The high booze taste almost begs to be aged, but therein lies the flaw: High-hopped beverages are best enjoyed fresh. These two competing priorities keep Maharaja from being the Great Gama it seeks to be. It's still a great drink, and definitely worthy of being entered into comparisons with PtY and Bad Boy.

5,17.9,5,5,5,5,5,"Wow, you can actually smell pungent and citrusy hops just upon opening the bottle! Avery usually delivers, and this one is no exception. It pours a slightly hazy reddish-copper body with orangeish highlights beneath a short but creamy head of white. Unfortunately, the head doesn't hold quite as well as might be hoped for (but with 10.54 % alcohol by volume (102IBU) that's to be expected!), and it does leaves some thin rings of lace about the glass. A firmly caramelish and delicately biscuity malt comes into play within the aroma, although the hops are still clearly present with notes of grass, pineapple, orange peel, dried pine needles, and muddled grapefruit. In the mouth its filling and dextrinous as the very-fine-bubbled carbonation warms and becomes airy before sliding away like silk pajamas on silk sheets. The flavor delivers a heavier blow than the aroma suggests with its solid maltiness ducking and weaving between punches of hop flavor and hits of solid bitterness. There's no real pattern to the way that it appears on the palate, and slaps of hops or hits of malt seem to come and go in a different fashion with each sip. Everyc omponent is always there, but certain characteristics just seem to pop at times. The one constant, however, is it's lingering, resinous and citrus-fruit-rind finish. There's bitterness there as well, but it doesn't come across as being raspy because of the thin but sticky layer of sweet malt that so stealthily hides itself while slowly receeding. It's a really nice, very well-balanced IPA that offers a decent amount of changing character in its profile; but might actually be lacking in complexity due to it's being "too balanced" - if that's possible. Still, this IPA rocks! The alcohol rarely appears, and its bitterness never overwhelms the palate! You can't drink too many because of the strength, but it's definitely drinkable.","mrotstein","Mar 25, 2011"

Flavour is juicy tangerine, more orange peel, piny and citric hop tang, very zesty, spicy, and oily in character, balancing toffee and caramel sweetness, lingering bitterness with some alcoholic burn to end. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, bordering on syrupy, acidic bite with warming liquor in the finish. This is a fantastic, hop-forward DIPA, but it packs a little too much booze for my liking, and at 9 months old it may have lost some of its hop wallop.

Tropical fruit and alcohol, less citrus and pine than in the aroma, caramel and biscuity malt. Slight spicy, peppery quality towards the end. Lingering bitterness tempered by grainy, husky malt.

But, the 2010 release of this is quite well balanced with a sweetness that comes through after the initial hop assault. The 10.5% ABV does not overwhelm with an alcohol bite like other high % beers I've had, in fact if one's not careful that 10.5 will sneak up on you by the end of the bottle. Trust me I know.

Taste was more of the same, I actually liked it better when it got warm. It tasted more like a liquor than beer. Mouthfeel like I said was thick and syrupy.

Aroma is very sweet, like fresh hop juice mixed with pineapple, mango, orange and a handful of citrus hops; barleywine sweetness again, with caramel, brown sugar, toffee, molasses, strong piney notes, graham cracker and sweet malt. Really sweet with a nice hop presence. Tastes like it smells, with strong citrus hops, pineapple, mango, orange, piney hops, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, cinnamon, spices like pepper and coriander, graham cracker, sweet malt and light booze that trails off very sweet. Malts are strong for an IPA but still let the hops tale the spotlight, and this hides the ABV very well. Overall pretty drinkable but a tad bit too sweet. It's bold and complex, but manages to be easy enough to drink while being rather aggressive so I upped the overall rating a bit.

Some sweetness fights to break through, but isn't quite able to overcome that bitter upfront taste. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied, despite the dark color. Very drinkable.

This fresh might blow my socks off with hops. The mouth feel was full without being heavy and a little chalky at the end but no big deal. The drinkability was great and a sure benefit of its age.

Aroma is all resinous hops made up of primarily pine with some citrus. Great head on the beer that just clings to the glass. Hops are right at the front of the first sip giving way to a surprising malt backbone before it finishes with more earthy hops. Definetely a hop-head's dream, with hops of pine, pine (yes, that's twice), citrus, and grass all on the palate at once. Nice body to the beer thanks to the malt, though the hops really coat your entire mouth and throat the more you drink it. The beer just clings to your mouth. It also has a cumulative effect - the more you drink the more you taste the hops, though the malt and yeast adds some nice sweetness.

4.27,0.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5," This ale has big sticky lacing and fluffy near white head. Huge smells of orange, pineapple and mango all over the nose. Faint traces of alcohol and lime with mint. Grapefruit bitterness takes the center stage from the first sip. Afterglows of caramel and and orange peel follow revealing slightly the 10%+ ABV. The aromas and the taste differ quite a bit. I am reminded of Grand Marnier. Who needs after dinner drinks when we live so happily in the world of super DIPAs. I am finding that the large quaffs are just as good as the slow sips. The body is refreshing silky and thin. The carbonation is present but does not scrub the bitterness from the pallet before the next sip. I do love this brew and will be looking for this again. there are drawbacks on the drinkability when she clocks in over 10%. As with the Hopslam tread lightly the sweetness is a lie... you will feel the buzz.","llllDrGONZOllll","Apr 19, 2010"

This is a real showcase of hops, but it retains a citrus and malt balance (despite what the east coasters say). Medium orange with a small head. Nose is pretty pleasant: pine, orange apricot, grapefruit. The real difference here with other IIPAs is the mouthfeel. VERY heavy. Maybe the heaviest mouthfeel of any hoppy beer I've had.

Bright amber orange color with a bit of red mixed in, noticeably clear, to the point you can spot just about every tiny bubble rising within. Boisterous nose of pine sap, tangerine and grapefruit juice, garden herbs, honey, malted milk balls and croissant flakes, the peach, apricot, yellow apple scents almost get shunted to the side and have a dried fruit character to boot. Medium-bodied, however, the "fluff factor" from the swirling carbonation increases palate coverage and makes the mouth on the whole feel fuller. The tangerine, mineola orange, pink grapefruit fruit fest continues here. A veritable pine forest in there too. Never gets bitter but the fruit takes on a more tropical tang with pineapple, papaya seated besides the apricot and peach. White pepper, clove and ginger root there in shadowy form. Strong malty side, yet total sweetness tempered by grassy hops. Lacks fully adroit integration, too much of a showoff, but drinking it is not a chore.","farrago","Apr 16, 2010"

Still a nice malt backbone to match up with the supreme hop flavors. Mouthfeel was super lush and creamy, nice low carbonation.

I liked it a lot and in many ways solidified my good opinion of Avery in stone. A great try and recommend snagging one.

3.26,-23.1,4,3,3,4,3.5,"22 oz. bomber bottled June 2009, Batch 10. Sweet, sweet malt aroma fills the room the second the bottle is opened. There's some piney hops in the nose as well but you really have to concentrate to distinguish them from that huge malt aroma. Pours bright orange with a thick and sticky white head that laces beautifully if you can manage to drink that much of it. Body is medium full with significant carbonation that combines to produce quite a pleasant sensation on the palate. It's just so cloyingly sweet. There's a considerable hop presence but it has no chance at all of competing with the malt. Tastes a lot like fresh unfermented wort. The malt profile is really pretty complex but I just can't get past the sweetness enough to enjoy it. The label claims an OG of 1.090 and ABV of 10.69% so, without actually breaking out the hydrometer, the FG should be about 1.007. I just don't buy that for a second. It's far too sweet to have finished that dry. I've heard really good things about this beer so I'm hoping this is just a bad batch.

There is also a sweet aspect to the aroma, honey or brown sugar. The taste is of bitter grapefruit rinds, piney hops, some resin. This is followed by a sweet malt that does a good job supporting the hop flavor and enhancing the citrusy and floral aspects of the hops. There is some tropical fruit sweetness in this brew. Moderate body with tingly carbonation; sweet throughout but finishes bitter, light asprin dryness. The ABV can produce some belly burn from time to time. Very tasty brew. I like that it showcases the hop flavors instead of the bitterness. The sweetness is well balanced with the hops. The ABV limits this sucker to one 12oz.","Gmann","Feb 21, 2010"

I was wrong the first sip and everything was most definitely right. IMO a very complex mixture of flavors, you get some fruity. citrus notes, some earthy tones too. Most in this style group tend to go one way or the other, but this one did both. Nicely bitter, and for a big double not really very sweet, but just enough to temper the punch in the face ABV, and surprisingly not hot. If I didn't know the ABV I never would have guessed it to be that high. A great Double from Avery by any measure. It gets knocked down a little on the nose, but that's being picky I suppose, and the 10+ ABV kills some drink ability, but that's not really a deterrent, you just have to be respectful.","nc41","Feb 16, 2010"

There is plenty bitterness to start and I'm sure it will scare off the weak but if you can hand around long enough you'll enjoy the lingering flavor.

4.4,3.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured from the 22 oz. bottle (bottled June 2009 - Batch 10) into a pint glass, Maharaja is an apricot-honey color with a huge pillowy hop-froth head that leaves a nice ring of lacing about the glass. The smell is huge; I can smell it from 2 feet away, citrus dominates in the form of grapefruit, orange and lemon - some resinous pine in there also. The taste starts malty sweet with caramel and lightly toasted notes and transitions into a slightly bitter pine slap across the face. The beautiful thing about Maharaja is that there is no lingering face-puckering bitterness, it is very well balanced. Also although the alcohol is 10.69%, you might guess it is elevated but not to that level, also well done. The mouthfeel is full bodied and slick, slightly drying on the finish but not a desert like some beers. Overall, very drinkable given the IBUs and ABV.

The smell had subtle hints of pineapple and passion fruit as well as some woodiness, but it was all overpowered by pink grapefruit to the point where if I closed my eyes, I'd have swore that I had my beak in a glass of Tropicana. The flavor was more subtle than the nose in terms of the grapefruit; certainly more balanced, and more evidence of malty/molasses sweetness. However the finish devolves into as sweet, and not-so-subtle alcoholic burn. Admittedly, this is where I differ from most of the other reviews on BA; the bottle I had (maybe a bad batch?) seemed to have too much burn for my taste. I wouldn't use the 10% abv as an excuse, as I have had Dbl IPAs just as strong where the burn is non-existent. The mouthfeel was nicely balanced; a little creamy.

I guess some IIPAs mask it (out hop-it) better than others, but not a problem! Mouthfeel was very smooth, moderate carbonation and excellent drinkability. Moreover a great enticing taste!

The finish is hints of citrus and bitter hops, and a twinge of alcohol. The aftertaste is mainly of those bitter hops.

Poured cold in a tulip glass this beauty shows a light copper, clear and glowing with a fair off-white head and decent cascading lace. The aroma emits a pronounced but tasteful grapefruit, somewhat floral at times with a sweet bread base. The flavor is tart cider pine with full malt earthiness. It borders on the bubblegum edge but instead reaches into that hard grain core to keep you grounded and blissful. As you go you pick up some peanutty touches and evident alcohol to warm you up a bit. It's full bodied, lightly but confidently carbonated and smooth as can be. The bitter hops hold the highlight here, becoming even more pronounced as you go. Drinkability would seem marginal based on alcohol but it is a wonderful taste sensation. Very grainy, tart and good!","Durge","Jul 16, 2009"

Taste: sweet with a big piney, raw, leafy flavor. Canned pineapple mix of sweet and acidity. There's seems to be a little citric rind down in there too. Smooth and sticky with a healthy dose of the ibu. Mercilessly drags you to the intersection of pine and pineapple road, it's a nice place to be. A nice fresh June 2009 Batch 10.

Whats great about this beer is that I let my friend try it (not really into hops, but I'm changing him) I was expecting bitter beer face but he said "wow, this is really good." And I thought this is awesome I have finally got him to really appreciate hops! Some reviews called it extremely bitter. I dont think so, and thats why my friend liked it - because it isnt. Its way more aroma and flavor. Piney and resiny while grapefruit and dank buds shine against a strong malty backbone. Delicious. I would have expected it to be a little fuller in body and there is a little alcohol bite. Definitely a sipper because it is a strong one.

Lots of ripe grapefruit and pineapple hops that just tore through the air as soon as I leaned in to it. Huge notes of hops dominated the entire flavor as well. Sharp flavor here as the resin like hops took all the moisture out of my mouth and left me parched, dry and looking for more.

4.32,1.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Review from 6-21-08: Pours a clear copper color with a tan colored head that recedes very slowly, leaving some lovely lacing along the sides of the glass. Aroma is extremely floral with hints of tropical fruits and some nice piney hop characteristics. Taste is extremely piney. Nice use of caramel malts to back it up giving a slight malt sweetness, but the pine notes are completely dominant. Hints of grapefruit round it out, extra-bitter for the hop-heads, slightly grassy and somewhat balanced. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with delicate carbonation. Drinkability is low due to the high alcohol content. A nice representation of the style, but missing my favorite American hop varieties.","KeefD","Apr 01, 2009"
4.4,3.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Screams out for sip after sip, even at over 10% abv. (Listed at 10.54% on their menu.) I followed this with a Pranqster, which at 7%, tasted boozier than Maharaja. Delicious. I'm not sure how this compares to fresh WC IIPAs, but if those are so much better than this, I need to make a trip ASAP. Starts to taste very sweet when it warms, which slowed me down a bit. Maybe it is all that booze kicking in, but one glass felt like enough. Could have been palate fatigue as well. The lack of malt complexity shows as a bit of a weakness over time, and is one reason why I can drink 90 Minute all night long, but would probably top out at a bomber of this.","ommegoose","Apr 01, 2009"

Nose is overwhelmingly pink grapefruit juice, like cutting open a ripe Indian River grapefruit, very nice. Citrusy hop dominates the flavor as expected, yet backed up by clover-honey sweetness. Feel is thick and hefty; in this area, I feel it could pass for a barleywine, not surprising at 10.54%. One to savor, this isn't a quick-drinking DIPA, as it skews to the stronger side of an already strong style.","Patrick999","Mar 30, 2009"

The floral aroma of the brew, a product of the lovely hoppiness, came out powerfully--the smell was my favorite part of this beer, it was delightfully refreshing, perhaps more intoxicating than the beer itself, I'd jest, but with its nearly 10% ABV, this brew packs a punch. The taste is good, but not terribly outstanding with regard to other nice IPA's. The bitterness of the hops predominates alongside a mild malty sweetness. The carbonation foams up in the mouth yielding a nice velvety mouthfeel; the beer goes smoothly down the throat. Overall, it's a tasty drink, but not one that I'd buy again over more preferable (and less expensive imperial IPA's). It's good's the point, but there are better beers of this sort.","BeefTongue","Mar 27, 2009"

Nose is hops, more west coast hops, grass and grapefruit mixed with other citrus. Taste is a super hop bomb with intricate citrus flavors and delicate pine and flower. Mouthfeel is syrupy and resinous. This is a hop lover's beer, but it doesn't bash you over the head - the interwoven layers help to soften the blow, and create a rich texture of flavors.

Given the ABV on this, I expected more of an alcohol presence in the taste - I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't! This beer is a medium body and there is a very nice buttery feel to the mouth.

3.34,-21.2,3.5,4.5,3.5,2.5,2,"Pours out an almost amber color with a big off-white head. The bubbles look dense and clingy and started to lace the glass early, though the head kind of falls back relatively quickly, leaving only a few swirls of bubbles after the first few sips. Looks pretty good. Smells very good too. I can immediately smell the fruity hops, grapefruit yes, but also tropical fruit, mango etc. There's a hint of sweetness and peachy alcohol, but really the hops dominate with whiffs of pine, resin, and grass as well. As usual, Avery has thrown in the huge ABV, with this bottle saying 10.27%, and I can really taste it, which hurts on the hop front for me. But there is enough hop flavor in there to see past it. I get the alcohol burn and hop bitterness first, followed by an intense grassy taste with just a kick of tropical fruit behind it. Finishes with a little battle between tart dryness and malty sweetness. The huge alcohol note hurts the mouthfeel, giving me primarily burn, but I kind of like the resinousy feel from the hops. Almost chewy from the hoppy flavors, though the malty liquid itself is kind of thin with alcohol. And this one really wears on you. Its a very enjoyable beer, but I was already slowing down after 4 sips or so. The alcohol just warms you and starts to make your head spin a bit quick. I would recommend it, but you might want to split it between friends to enjoy it the most - too much booze.","taylorhamrick","Mar 16, 2009"

This brew wasn't as bitter as I was expecting, especially at 102 IBU's. The aromas that I smelled came through nicely in the taste as well, strong floral hops, and citrusy grapefruit flavors. The 10% ABV is hidden very well by these strong flavors. I thought that it would finish a bit crisp and dry, but it stayed smooth even in the aftertaste.

4.42,4.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a beautiful light amber-ish copper color with about a finger and a half of off white head. As soon as I open the bottle I can smell the hops. The aroma is very nearly all hops with only mere hints of some caramel malt. Lots of citrus, some pine, and a fair amount of grass. Taste is pretty darn good. Much like the aroma with hops dominating; citrus, grass and pine, in that order. There is a malt backbone here but its hard to find through the massive amount of hop flavor. This beer is quite bitter in the finish but it doesn't taste like the 102 IBUs that the bottle claims. I also can't find the 10.27 ABV that bottle claims either. I can feel it after a few minutes but it really isn't present in either the aroma of taste. Mouthfeel is quite good. Medium, maybe medium-light body with moderate carbonation. Very smooth despite the high bitterness. Drinkability is very good. This is a pretty good example of what I look for in a DIPA. Its loaded with hops, solidly bitter, properly carbonated, and most importantly, highly attenuated.

Nose was sweet and hoppy with an indication of grapefruit and floral aromas. Taste follows nose, but a little less sweeter than anticipated and a mild bitterness at the finish that lingered between sips.

The smell is wonderful with several citrus and floral tones upfront, the hops are certainly there but not overpowering, your nose can easily search and find the malts and some undetermined spices. Drinking this beer upfront you aren't overly assaulted with the hops but rather the floral and citrus tones. It gets abit chewy in the middle with some malts and finishes strong with the long lasting hop bitterness. It is very close to being a genuine full-bodied beer with medium carbonation. The drinkability of this beer is wonderful because the hops aren't overly assaulting but last a long while on your palate.

4.35,2.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Sampled after my EX-lady and I brought it across the country during a road trip. Stamped 'Imperial IPA, bottled in February '08.' Poured into my glass a slightly hazy orange like a sunset with a one finger, yellow and tan head like the coat of a yellow lab. Chunks of lacing stick to the glass. Aromas were of big fresh, wet hops with some hints of green apple. The 102 IBU'S shows in the muscular, 'green' hops character that first hit my tongue. Hay, citrus peel, bitter hops. A sweeter maltiness comes in next to balance and does so surprisingly well. One can barely tell that this mammoth beer clocks in at 10.54% ALC! Low/mid carbonation is perfect, adding to the quaffable, smooth and lush mouthfeel. Though I said it looked like a Lab, this brew is anything but a dog. Truly, I think it's exactly what an Imperial IPA should be and if it had it displayed slightly more depth of flavor and better retention of the head it would be amongst the best in the world. Well, ok, one can argue it still is. I wouldn't object...","thekevlarkid","Aug 21, 2008"

It was thick with no carbonation, and had a solid grapefruit aftertaste, with slight alcohol warming. Overall this was a very clean and delicious beer that was very drinkable despite its potency.

Letting it breathe a bit some honey and malt come out in the aroma but the hoppy grapefruit bang still dominates. The taste is all about sweet hop city. A mixture of pink grapefruit, tangerine and of course the expected pine are the up front flavors. A hint of apples and brown sugar come out too as the brew warms a little. Quite bold with mellow bitter but not eye watering as was expected from the smell. The beer itself has a creamy fluffiness in the mouth which is something Avery has mastered and they don't mess with that formula here at all. It finishes with a lingering hop tang in the mouth and an slight alcohol warming down the throat but at 9.6 abv and 102 ibu's surprisingly not all bossy and overbearing as it might have been if put in the hands of other brewers.","Dalem","Jul 31, 2008"

They have the classy foil tops on the bottles, a name for the beer that eludes to the style, and a beautifully artistic picture and description. The Maharaja is no exception! As one of the kings of the uber-competitive Imperial IPA category, this beer rules with an iron fist. Certainly not for the faint of palate, this beer pours a burnt orange color with a big head and great lacing retention. The aroma reveals a massive amount of hops, adding touches of citrus, pine, and even a candy-like sweetness not typical to the category. I'm having trouble placing it, but lemonheads come to mind. The flavor on the nose packs a good wallop of malts and hops and seems fairly balanced (a warm fair king, good to his subjects!)

Nose is very similar to Bells Hopslam, but with more of a malt background to give the intense grapefruit some backbone. Really smells of great citric fruit. The nose leads you to believe that there is going to be something incredibly interesting and possibly maybe quite a balance to the hops, but that doesn't happen. Intense hop pine, roasted grapefruit which is interesting but doesn't add a balance to the alcohol. Surprisingly there is a creamyness throughout the whole palate with the malts! Very tasty, although showing a little more alcohol than i would like. Just like rolling into a club, and seeing the hottest hop from a distance and you want to take that hop home for sure. After some hardcore krunk dancing, the dance is over and the lights turn on to reveal that miss hoppy isn't as treal as you thought. Even though you aren't 100% down, you still put that hop in your whip and take it home. Also you roll that hop in some peanut butter.","Twerknasty","Apr 22, 2008"

Initially a pervasive but soft grapefruit rind bitterness spreads across the palate, but a balancing malt sweetness is not underrepresented. Hops are a bit raw and green, turning from citrus to leafy mid palate. The mouthfeel is buoyant and full, with plenty of fine carbonation and a slight viscosity. Malt is nicely integrated with the bitterness, and doesn't get too estery or cloying, but it gets close. Some nuances of tea and earth come through as it warms. Finishes big and bitter. Overall a nicely done beer; well balanced, complex flavors with an excellent mouthfeel. A nice double IPA with no real faults but not particularly outstanding in any way either. A bit pricey.","bcm119","Apr 18, 2008"

It is silky and creamy; a smooth blend of hops, malt and alcohol sweetness that seamlessly blends together to create a pancakes with syrupy glide across my tongue and down my throat.

Smell is piney and fruity, and intensely hopped with notes of fresh sweet pineapple as well. Taste is equally as intense with loads of hops. Bitter pine flavor with a lot of pink grapefruit and bitter rind in the finish. A touch astringent at times, but almost seems to mellow a bit as it warms. Some tea flavors at moments, and an appropriate amount of sweet fruity malt to balance just enough. Quite drinkable, and a really good all around DIPA that hides the alcohol very well for over 10%.

Taste is heavy on the grapefruit and pine resin flavors with a a sweet malt backbone, I have to say while good its a could be a little bit better balanced with the bitterness level and hop flavor. Mouthfeel is medium body close to a barleywine with an excellent medium to low carbonation level. While at 10.54 ABV its very drinkable for the alcohol I find the bitterness is a little over the top but still a very good beer, just remember being better in the past.","sfoley333","Apr 05, 2008"

It has a rather dull flavor for its smell, but it is filled with hop flavors and very little malt flavors and has a slight alcohol twang and even has a slight smokey aftertaste... its pretty smooth.

Clings to the edges of the glass for all its worth. Smell is big hops, piney hops. Only thing I can compare to is smelling fresh hops while home brewing. HOPS! Taste is a bit more mellow than the smell though, starts sweet, white bread/buscuitty flavors, orange zest and then POW, big citrus hops and pine needles dipped in hop oil in your face. Beautiful obliteration of the taste buds. Mouthfeel is suprisingly creamy yet finishes dry making your mouth crave the next assult of hoppliteration. Nice.","RickSawyer","Mar 22, 2008"
4.44,4.7,4,5,4.5,4,4,"I've been waiting for this one a while and can't wait to dig in. Pours copper with reddish hues into a snifter. The slight head recedes quickly with little lacing left behind as streaks of carbonation swim briskly for the top. The bold hops and citrus aromas attack immediately and let you know you're in for some good times ahead. Tastes of oranges with a hint of sour apples in the background. The hops aren't as bold as the smell would have you believe, but they do hit the palate fairly aggressively. Just before the malt balance enhances the experience, the astringent qualities become apparent. I think I poured this one a bit too cold, because after it warms up, all the aforementioned qualities blend and accentuate each other better. Has a full bodied mouth-feel, yet goes down pretty smooth. Drinkability is higher than expected, as all the elements work together cohesively. Grand brew from one of my favorite breweries. Worth the wait, and will revisit soon.","stephens101","Mar 21, 2008"

A nice dose of pine balanced with some citrus. The taste combines the hops with some sweetness, thanks to the high O.G. Its like drinking a candied hop cone.

In other words, it's similar to the Avery single IPA, but with more bitter, grassy hops, and they are both distinguishable. I used to prefer the single, now I think I like the Maharaja better. In a nutshell, it's a double with a multi-dimensional nose and a taste consistent with the nose, and no big surprises.

The head is thick and creamy and somewhat billowing, and you will find some nice yeasty bits floating in the glass, but not lots. The smell is thick piney hops, sweet malts, grapefruit, and very enticing. I did knock it down a little in that the smell thinned out too much after the initial pour. It's nice nevertheless. This beer is a full bodied, thick, syrupy, moderately carbonated IPA that is very tasty. Plenty of piney hop notes, resinous hoppy esters, lots of grapefruity tang and subtle sweetness, plus some other sweetish citrus flavors that are difficult to pin down. I detect some rind, some spices, and some slight flowery hints as well. This beer improves as it settles. This is a wonderful ale for a cold day. The mouthfeel is a bit creamy on the tongue, there are some warming alcohol notes, but the 9.7% ABV is very well concealed overall. There is a little throatiness with this beer in the finish and beyond. This is well worth seeking out. L'Chaim.","albern","Jan 05, 2008"

Citrusy, juicy, bitter, very balanced. I have had this once before and dont remember it being so balanced. Alcohol is very well hidden. Mouthfeel is velvety, pretty heavy, decent carbonation.

The beer itself is a warm orange-yellow cloudy color. The smell was like getting hit in the head with a sack full of hops. It was so earthy, piney, and flowery, with citrus (especially orange) all around. Someone was sitting next to me and asked me if I had windex in my glass. Despite that analogy, I thought the smell was fantastic, and it made me very excited to try to beer. The taste was powerful, but not as much as the smell. Obviously, the name of the game was the hops, which gave a strong, dry, nearly stinging linger to each sip. But there was also a warm alcoholic taste, notes of citrus fruits, and some sweet substance. A meduim body and light carbonation made this a great sipping beer that still won't let you take your mind off of it. In the end, I definately enjoyed getting it, but I thought it was a bit too potent for my tastes.","micahgoldfus","Nov 15, 2007"

The mouthfeel seemed a bit weak, and the flavor profile was rather thin, especially for an assertive style. Balance was obviously more skewed to the hops, but the sweetness of malt did not seem to fit as well as it could have.

Wow, I almost completed writing review without a single mention of the alcohol. It's nearly non-existant from the taste, but (since I'm mentioning it now) it makes its presence known within the first half-dozen ounces. Bottom line: I love this beer.

Not a hop bomb but I dont mind that since is has some juicy fruit present. Medium in the mouth and ABV is non existant. This is a dangerous brew.

A froth on the palate only intensifies the flavors and gets some of the malt sweetness to get past the hops. Well worth the wait! I had eaten earlier and after two glasses, I was done for the night.

Aroma is heavy on grapefruit peal and cut grass balanced with a sugar coating of light biscuit malt character the sweetness and fruit aspects really come through in this one. Flvors of citrus peel, grass, and mild pine combine on the palate upfront with strong bitterness but are balanced out by the large dose of malts with just enough biscuit sweetnss from the pale malts evdient alcohol not overdone at all. Mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied with enough oily girth from the herbaceous to be fuller but still really smooth with even carbonation.

Taste follows suit to the smell except more intense, and sugary malts are present but they take a back seat to the hops. Just enough bread and caramel to calm things down, but the hops dominate.

Tasted like it was freshly dry-hopped--I had an IPA on cask once with hops added directly into the cask, and Maharaja reminded of that. The mouthfeel was pretty clean (maybe a little bit of stickiness in the finish), not syrupy like Stone Ruination, but not thin or watery either. When the beer was cold, the hops completely dominated the malt (unlike AleSmith's and Sierra Nevada's IPAs); as it warmed, though, a bit more of the malty sweetness showed up.

Maybe its just a really fresh keg, but the pine and sweet citrus/grapefruit hops are just jumping out of the glass on this one. Obviously dry-hopped very well. Taste is all about the high alpha hops, but is very well balanced with a sugary malt backbone. Very hop candy-ish with a resinous, oily mouthfeel. Not hot with alcohol in the least bit. Smooth and terrifically drinkable. Not sure how the latest bottled version matches up, but this one is a winner.

Huge, resiny, piney, citric hop aroma that could probably be duplicated by sticking some Centennial hop pellets up your nose. At higher temperatures, some more earthy and fruity notes come out to play in the aroma. On the palate, thin, razor sharp mouthfeel and hops that will smack you around. Huge piney and resiny notes, with very little malt backbone -- massively imbalanced. Orange, mint, all the stereotypical flavors of American hops make an appearance here. It's got hop complexity in spades, but pretty much nothing from the malt end. This beer is like sucking on a hop pellet. Well, it's a little sweeter than that, if only from the ABV, but this seems to me a beer that only a hophead should love. Sure, I can look at this objectively and say it's a well-executed Double IPA, but that doesn't mean I'd want to drink it a second time.

The taste starts with hearty malt flavor then rolls into an intense hop biterness of grapefruit and lemony citrus flavors, which lingers on the palate for sometime. It has a smooth mouthfeel, medium bodied at first and gets heavier as it reaches the back of the throat.

4.08,-3.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Notes: this is almost two different beers warm versus cold. When cold it's more crisp and dry with a woodsy lingering finish, while when it's warm it's dominated by juicy, fruity hops, an oily feel and alcohol in the nose and taste. All in all I though this was a good DIPA -- my favorite style lately -- but IMHO it doesn't measure up to some better versions I've had recently. At 9.9% ABV (according to my bottle's label), it does provide a nice buzz, however.","Kendo","Jan 19, 2007"

Poured into red wine glass , huge inch and a half white head that slowly dissipates, with foamy lacing that grows thin. The body is a musty red orange, lightens up at the bottom of the glass. Smells of hops right up front particularly flowers, pine, citrus, grass, a little sharp and tense. Subtle hints of caramel malt, biscuits are back there too. Taste is a bit easier going, a refreshing bitterness is present backed by a malt backbone, not very much sweetness though. Some nice caramel notes emerge toward the middle and a nice pine finish with a tinge of malt sweetness. Personally my only real complaint is the alcohol becomes a little too apparent as this warms up, but still this is a good interpretation of an imperial IPA, fits every well with in the style, and its very much worth a try.","mmcave","Dec 27, 2006"

The mouthfeel has nice tangy and sticky resin characteristics. The finish is wonderfully crisp, slightly sweet, and followed by a hop bitterness that is just strong enough to balance the hop flavors without overshadowing the fruity, citrusey, sweet perfume hop character that makes this beer so nice. The alcohol content is practically undetectable due to the great balance and bursting flavors present. I really can't say enough about the Maharaja; I've had it on tap numerous times in the past couple of weeks, and I keep going back for more.

Pours golden amber with fast-rising carbonation and a moderate off-white head. Thick webs of lacing all around the glass. Nose of sprucey-cannabis and sweet blood orange sections -- 102 IBUs, and nostril-stinging is in full effect. Wow, taste is much sweeter and far less bitter than expected: corn syrup-enhanced orange-grapefruit juice and sugary caramel maltiness almost all the way through yields to a distinctly cannabinoid pine-flavored finish. Mouthfeel is astringent and juicy but becomes thicker, more syrupy as the beer warms. Ridiculously delicious piney hop burps.

I think what did it for me was the smell of the apricot/peach every time you lifted the glass up to your mouth, it really just hit me, and to be followed by such flavor was just wonderful. This was really drinkable for the high alcohol level, so be careful it creeps up on you. I enjoyed it so much I picked up a bottle and brought it back with me on the plane.

The flavor just explodes on the palate. This beer reeks of citrus and pine, but is oh so well balanced. Everything is in beautiful proportion, with just enough malt to keep this beer from geting tiring (a problem I sometimes have with the Hercules from Great Divide). Maybe it's not quite in the same league as the twin titans from Russian River (Pliny the Elder and Pliny the Younger), but it's pretty darn close.

Mostly dry, but semi-sweet, with bitterness running the full length of the spectrum (beginning, middle, and end-of-palate.) The big alcohol is extremely well-hidden, with a hop profile that is on-par with Avery's other alpha-rich brews, and that's exactly what I'd expect of a double IPA from Avery. Herbal, vegetal hops . . . it's like walking into a greenhouse at the end of winter! This is an easy step-up from their very-palatable year-round I.P.A., and poured next to Hog Heaven (for comparison's sake), Maharaja's intense hop profile is pervasive, intruding on the (by comparison) delicate profile of Hog Heaven (and btw, Maha followed by H.H. is a deadly 1-2 punch!)

4.03,-5,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Copper hued liquid sitting below a clan a microscopic bubbles desperately clinging together, first growing large, then dying into a smooth film that barely coats the surface of the liquid. The aroma first reminds of opening two ounces of fresh whole flower Centennial buds, a very dry, spicy, medicinal, resinous, but most of all, extremely woodsy hop aroma. I didnt detect much of a aromatic malt contribution, perhaps a bit of caramel, biscuit and fruit, but I did detect a somewhat unpleasant vitamin scent, which I attribute to yeast, although I could be wrong. The flavor does indeed exude much more malt flavor than any of Averys previous double IPAs, especially Eleven, providing a huge base of caramel and toffee which serves to balance the onslaught of hop flavors that I simultaneously experience. The general flavor is a resinous blend of several hop varieties, which is well balanced by all the other elements of the beer. A tasty one for sure, and a unique way of approaching the style.","Crosling","Mar 15, 2006"

This brew poured a beautiful bright orange amber hue into my glass with a half inch head that left sticky lacing along the sides. Aroma was an incredible fusion of pungent, grassy hops, grapefruit and apricots in the nose. Taste was a hop lovers wet dream, very hoppy, fruity and with notes of peaches, apricots and grapefruit on the tongue. This beer had a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel and was easy drinking for it's strength. The 9.9% abv stated on the label is not noticeable. I polished off two 22oz bottles in just a couple of hours. This is by far one of the tastiest beers that I have ever had and gives any other DIPA a run for it's money.","rodrot","Mar 15, 2006"

The aromas are a boquet of floral and earthy hops with a strong underlying malt presence. Big on the malts without becoming sweet. The hops IBU's keep this barley heavy beer dry and balanced. The feel is just short of thick. Greatly drinkable if not for the heavy and complex flavors. Spicy and dry in the aftertaste. The downside is that the northwestern hop character and malt fermentation leaves the beer a bit metalic and salty, thus slight of high drinkability.

This could almost pass for a Barleywine, as the 112 IBUs never overwhelm. Well, maybe not a Barleywine, but there IS balance in this beer. Mouthfeel is smooth and a little slick, could be better there. The drinkability is ok for a DIPA, or any 9.7% ABV beer for that matter, but the alcohol is noticable as the brew warms, so that is an area that could be slightly improved as well.

The flavor has an interesting combination of hop and malt flavors; and is a little bit different from the few other 2XIPAs I've had. The malt flavor is strong, almost like a weak barleywine, with a distinct fruitiness. The hop flavor is strong, resinous, but not quite distinctly piney or citrissy.

A brown sugar thickness, some molasses but a big hop counterpoint that does the beer in good standing. There is no way I could mark this beer down, now that I am drinking a bottle by myself (it was fun pouring it with Adam Avery at the last BA fest)...the "Raja" has a balance I don't get in many Double IPAs...maybe its still the memory of Russian River face-to-face with this that makes it good but not world-class in what that style CAN be...","ADR","Aug 06, 2005"

Sweet hop juicy citric aroma with plenty of malt to be had. This could use a bit more hops and bitterness. The flavor retains the citric juice hops that were gong on in the nose but with more bitterness to help it along. Nice maltiness here with a light sweetness than the nose. Finishes with a nice hop juiciness and a light bitter bite. Pretty big mouthfeel here but none of the prickly hop feel on your tongue I expect form Double IPAs.

Long lingering bitterness, numbing the toungue. Haven't had an experience quite like this since I first tried Ruination. All in all though it's tasty and I would have it again.

Mouthfeel is right on for the style. I have yet to find a IIPA that isn't just a little bit syrupy. The moderate to low carbonation found in this brew give it a creamy mouthfeel that begs for sipping which borders on gulping. As with most other IIPAs, I find this beer to be extremely drinkable.

The nose was very nice, with a good caramel malt base under tinges of oranges, grapefruit hops, land ight bready notes. Overall, fairly good. The flavor was not as nice as the nose. The caramel was big and thick, but the hops didn't hold up. They were there, but not in force. The feel was thick and rich, almost syrupy on my tongue. Overall dinkability was great for the size of this beer. It was refreshing and quaffable. A very nice brew.","kmpitz2","Jun 02, 2005"

Very little bitterness in the aftertaste for the amount of hop flavor that is present. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth and creamy for this beer. And the 9.7% alcohol is hidden extremely well---I could easily drink several of these in a session. Great beer to go along with a great bottle from Avery.","cubedbee","May 30, 2005"

Taste is pretty straightforward. Malts at first, followed up with a decent hop balance. The hops linger in the mouth late into the beer. Bit of a piney tang to the beer, not unpleasant though.

Nose is, naturally, full of hop aroma, noticibly flowery and citrusy. Taste is very sharply bitter, and even though there's obviously a lot of residual sugar, you have to hunt around the forcibly dry bitterness to find it. Hop flavor is very full, ranging from grapefruit citrus to piney to peppermint-like. The finish is dry and lingers around forever. Quite full-bodied, this is a big beer in every sense of the word. Yet, there are a lot of other very big IPA's out there currently, and this one doesn't quite stand out the very crowded field.","allengarvin","May 19, 2005"
4.6,8.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1" beige head over the clear orangey amber brew. Head lasts, and laces delicately yet plentifully. Aroma is juicy fruit hops. Taste starts with a light malt sweetness, and quickly morphs into fruity hops which tantalyze, yet do not overpower. We're talking hops flavor here, not just the bitter hammer over the taste buds. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both great for the style, which can sometimes be daunting. An almost subtle yet effective brew, surprised by this one (still fearing The Beast)...","ppoitras","May 18, 2005"

Huge hoppy pine in the front with major pepper and spice. Some roasty nuts. The middle is very thick, sweet and malty. But the hops are never far from sight. Huge alcohol finish (a little rubbing alcohol) and more mountains of hop. Bitter aftertaste with loads of pepper. It's not bad. The alcohol is pretty raw, but the hops are fresh and juicy.

The bitterness leads to a somewhat dry finish, and the malts (although providing a sturdy backbone) are not as prominent as in the Hercules from GD. The 9.7 ABV is felt by the end, and it was an enjoyable drinking experience. I would say that I would do a head-to-head taste test with Hercules, but then I would be drunk!

The sweet malt backbone is thick and sugary, almost syrup like. Not too shabby at all. Nice thick like mouthfeel, as I expect for a double IPA.

4.47,5.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Wow, you can actually smell pungent and citrusy hops just upon opening the bottle! Avery usually delivers, and this one is no exception. It pours a slightly hazy reddish-copper body with orangeish highlights beneath a short but creamy head of white. Unfortunately, the head doesn't hold quite as well as might be hoped for (but with 9.7% alcohol by volume that's to be expected!), and it does leaves some thin rings of lace about the glass. A firmly caramelish and delicately biscuity malt comes into play within the aroma, although the hops are still clearly present with notes of grass, pineapple, orange peel, dried pine needles, and muddled grapefruit. In the mouth its filling and dextrinous as the very-fine-bubbled carbonation warms and becomes airy before sliding away like silk pajamas on silk sheets. The flavor delivers a heavier blow than the aroma suggests with its solid maltiness ducking and weaving between punches of hop flavor and hits of solid bitterness. There's no real pattern to the way that it appears on the palate, and slaps of hops or hits of malt seem to come and go in a different fashion with each sip. Everycomponent is always there, but certain characteristics just seem to pop at times. The one constant, however, is it's lingering, resinous and citrus-fruit-rind finish. There's bitterness there as well, but it doesn't come across as being raspy because of the thin but sticky layer of sweet malt that so stealthily hides itself while slowly receeding. It's a really nice, very well-balanced IPA that offers a decent amount of changing character in its profile; but might actually be lacking in complexity due to it's being "too balanced" - if that's possible. Still, this IPA rocks! The alcohol rarely appears, and its bitterness never overwhelms the palate! You can't drink too many because of the strength, but it's definitely drinkable.","NeroFiddled","May 10, 2005"

Not nearly the nose I would have expected from a double IPA, the hops aroma is present, but subtle. You do not smell the alcohol. Taste is quite good. While not in the nose, the hops are strong in the drink. Not overwhelming, but they nicely balance the alcohol. Feels thick in the mouth, somewhat less carbonated that my taste.

Deep copper in color, the small white head dissipated a bit and left that petri dish look floating on the top. I dug and dug and dug again the piney and candied hop arroma. Man did this beer smell good. I thought the body was a bit chewy, but still enjoyable.

A lot of citrus grapefruit up front, but the balance of malt sweetness is very refreshing. This isnt just another hop bomb.

Nose is full of hop, like a green-leafed nose gay, and I can almost see the srystals; seems like an almost orange/raspberry sweetness to it.
