But there was a lone bottle in my local grocery store and I thought, why not.  So, with that in mind... I started this around 56F.  It poured an OMG beautiful golden amber, perhaps the prettiest beer I've seen.  Nice whitish head that lasted long enough to appreciate.  Smell was mostly citrus hops.  Maybe some grapefruit, but definitely citrus.  Aroma was the weakest link.  Taste followed, but slightly out performed the aroma.  Feel was medium body and quite creamy.  In fact, there's many a stout that could take a lesson.  I found myself wanting to really like this beer, but ultimately it is not my thing.  My rating is probably unfair because I'm not into IPAs, but if you are, or want to try one, I heartily recommend this beer!","marieli","Feb 23, 2015"

4.45,4,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.5,"Well, I picked up a couple of bottles to review, and before I knew it the vultures were circling. My wife seized the opportunity while I was finishing my pale ale reviews to help herself to the 90 Minute IPA's chilling in the fridge. I was able to get a 5 oz. sample out of the deal though. LOL. Even in her IPA tulip the beer demonstrated amazing clarity. You can see every detail of your hand holding the glass through the body of the beer. I really like the copper-amber appearance, with its unique cinnamon highlights. The frothy 2 finger head and ample uneven lacing add to the allure. The aroma has a nutty brown ale quality with an abundant rustic hop character. Scents of sweet breads mingle with hints of sour citrus. I'm actually surprised by the super malty flavors of this one. A bold brown sugar sweetness compliments the myriad hop complexities, and threatens to steal the show. Noticeably absent is any real sense of bitterness. Typically with a mega-hopped brew of this stature you can expect a dry, bitter bomb. Not the case at all with this one. Instead you get a lot of nice fruity flavors,  earthy spice, a little mint and very reserved citrus pith. Everything comes together in a rich, hearty body. The perfect carbonation helps create a creamy texture that might just be the best I've ever had in an IPA. This may also be the only DIPA that I've had where the malts truly stack up to the hops, and the resulting balance creates an entirely new understanding of what an IPA can be. Make no mistake, at 90 IBU's this one is not lacking in the hop department in any way. It's just a bit of sleight of hand for the malts to seduce you in to thinking you may have a barleywine in your possession instead. Admittedly, the sweetness can become a little much, but no more so than the bitterness of most other Imperial IPA's. In the world of creative craft beers, this one stands out to me for its originality and pure personality.","JohnnyI","Jan 28, 2015"

This beer has enough malt to keep it from being too bitter, and it has enough hops to satisfy any hophead cravings you may have. It is extremely drinkable year-round, but be careful: it is 9% alcohol because of the absurd amount of hops and the malt necessary to make it balanced. It is the only beer that I have ever tasted and immediately thought, "That is genius." And I still feel that way. A ridiculously good beer that any beer drinker, and, especially, any fan of IPA's, needs to try.","JohnRyanJosey","Dec 19, 2014"

4.85,13.3,,,,,,"Overall, this is an awesomely crafted, well-balanced beer. For anyone new to craft beer, this is an excellent example/ starting point for a great IPA. The beer is bitter, but isn’t the typical hop-bomb that tends to alienate non-IPA drinkers. The only downside to this beer is that it is a little too thick, which may be due to the extra malt. I think a tad bit more carbonation would give it a little more of a lightening lift. I would rate this beer a 97/100!","DaverCS","Dec 10, 2014"

3.75,-12.4,,,,,,"great Imperial IPA but this one seems to aim to please the majority other than those seeking higher ibu hoppy beers. I know it takes about a month to brew this beer at Dogfish Head with continuously dry hopping it which shows it at 90 ibu but its hard to pull the bitterness from the enormous malt character, its definitely a hoppy beer for sure but it seems to have almost an over barring malt linger on the taste. All together though great IPA.","stonefan55","Dec 09, 2014"

Smells of sweet hickory BBQ, can't describe anyway else. Taste is very malty up front with almost no hop bite and a mildly sweet smooth finish. Drank on 12-3-14, bottled on 9-23-14 but bottle says it ages well. This IPA,in a blind taste test would pass as an Amber IMO. Doesn't carry any traditional IPA characteristics but DFH isn't traditional either. They just make good beer the way they want and this is a good beer. Way too smooth and easy drinking for a 9% beer.

I get citrus, pine,  malt & a few other flavors, but that's about it.  I just know what I like, and this IPA is drinkable, but based on the numbers, I expected something really special.  What I actually tasted was something especially sweet, with a fairly prominent alcohol taste.  Not all that amazing.  So sweet, in fact that I don't think I'll be drinking it again.  Way overpriced for my unrefined palate.  In the end, it's the overpowering sweetness that turns me off.  Worth about $7.99/six pack, no more.","Handwaver","Dec 01, 2014"

4,-6.5,,,,,,"Served in a tulip glass, this brew pours a gorgeous dark amber with an almost nonexistent head and thin lacing. The nose is primarily malt, honey, pine and peach/apricot, with faint touches of citrus. Atypical for a DIPA, a strong hop presence competes with an almost overwhelming malty sweetness - this is by far the sweetest DIPA I've tasted this far. I get the apricot/honey/malt at the beginning, followed by the bitter tinge and citrus of the hops, finishing with a boozy moonshine presence. A great-tasting beer for sure, if not an excellent example of the DIPA style.","Antnego","Nov 17, 2014"

Its a wonderful balance of hops and loads of deep, dark, earthy undertones that keep you coming back for more. It needs to be ice cold to really enjoy all the depth. Word to the wise - it has one hell of a punch! So be careful, this puppy will sneak up on you. This is one American Double IPA that you must try!","DaliQualiti","Oct 28, 2014"

I recently saw this on sale so I thought I would give it a good overview now that I am more in tune with the style and I will have to say that after trying some other bruisers that this one was a bit disappointing. I say this because I have become somewhat of a hop addict. I felt that there was too much malt in the beer making it a bit too sweet for what I prefer. Nevertheless, I will give it a higher mark because it was the beer that got me into the style and for that reason it does deserve a higher place in the pantheon of DIPA's. If nothing else it is produced year around and is pretty much obtainable everywhere and often you can find grocery stores that mark it down, which as we know is a nice thing considering the rising prices of beer lately.","humuloner22","Aug 20, 2014"

Complex nose of tropical, citrus and pine hops over a biscuit sweetness with a slight spicy note. Medium body, but on the higher end and quite smooth, with normal carbonation that imparts a bit of effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is very complex, but yet well balanced with its 3 main components - hops, bitterness and sweetness. It begins with the hop flavors of the nose, transitions to a mild spicy bitterness and finishes with a smooth sweetness over an alcohol note. As it warms, the body approaches full with a nice oily texture and the alcohol more prevalent in the finish.","tillmac62","Aug 12, 2014"

But what makes this beer distinctive is its great malt backbone contributing a bready aspect to cope with the heavier flavors of raisin and fig. Slight buttery and brandy alcohol sensation on end, nut sweetened by presence of aforementioned fruits. The heaviness of the malts is definitely reminiscent of Bengal Lancer or an IIPA, but the citrus, piney, dank hops give it an appropriate hop presence found in most DIPAs.","orcrist_cleaver","Aug 07, 2014"

While I still feel it's a remarkable beer, it just doesn't push the same buttons as it used to for me. This beer struggles for balance, with the malts often taking the upper hand. While that's not an issue for everyone, it's certainly not what a bitter-freak like me looks for. With that being said, this is an excellent beer that I'll continue to drink in the future, but it'll be reserved for my maltier moods.","ThePaintedGrey","Jul 31, 2014"

Aroma is light roasted malt, and fragrant floral hops. Flavor, as you probably all know so well, is out-of-this-world amazing, malt, a little sweetness, a bit of apricots, a bit of pine, and delightful hops, well-balanced, and not at all mild. Mouthfeel is medium, not quite chewy. Overall this is the most amazing flabbergasting tasty IPA I have ever sampled. But what do I know? Try it, if you haven't!","Dsimenson","Jul 22, 2014"

It was I'm gonna guess around 50 degrees or so. After the first sip I definitely caught a chocolate note which I have not heard anyone else mention. Deep amber color, nice head.

What I think saves this beer for me is the "ridiculous amount of English Two-Row Barley" that Dogfish Head uses after the 90-minute hopping. The taste is strong with both hops and malt at the front, the finish is pretty dry, but for me, a little too sour. Still, I'd drink this over the mass-produced pisswassers any day - but there are other beers I'd still rather spend the money on.","slym","Jul 05, 2014"

The problem with DFH90 is that other breweries caught up over the past few years and are not available in specialty/beer stored (Lagunitas comes to mind...I'm on the East coast). This beer simply doesn't carry the hop nose I personally feel is required to be in the top tier of imperial IPAs now available. Don't get me wrong...I like this beer very much. I just bought it today because I was on a business trip and this was available at the local Safeway supermarket. I simply caveat this review by saying I don't think this beer is still in the elite of top IIPAs in the country.","captaincoffee","Jun 15, 2014"

Aromas of honey, pine, flowers and citrus. 90 minute is a malt first DIPA in the vein of hopslam but there are lovely subtle flavors that make this beer an exception to my "I prefer dry IPAs" mentality. Sweet malts and honey lead the flavor profile. The hopping provides floral, piney and orange citrus aromas and is not overly bitter. There is apparent alcohol in the finish but it is not unpleasant. I would prefer a more prominent hop flavor overall but the flavors are very well integrated. The carbonation is active and beer is a bit viscous, providing a creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this beer is outstanding and is deserving of its reputation. Even though my preference in IPAs leads towards the drier and hoppier, I will gladly drink a 90 minute when I'm in the mood for a big IPA.","brianmandell","Jun 07, 2014"

The color is a hazy yellow with a lot of citrus hops in the nose. The taste is fantastic with great hop flavors in the beginning with sweeter flavors coming through after that. This beer is thick and has a little bit of a molasses aftertaste that lingers and enhances the flavor of the hops. Would definitely recommend.","WhiteHillsStore","May 11, 2014"

Taste is big on the caramel malt with grape and citrus adding to the sweetness but not too much. Decent amount of bitterness and no booze despite the aroma. Overall, I like this, but i just doesn't live up to the level it use to for me. Its a sweeter dipa than im use to and grape/citrus combo is alright.

A great springboard to discover even better craft out in the world. You will return to 90 Minute always even if you master your palate. It's bold, flavorful and versatile in all departments of palate. It can benefit from tweaking, mainly in feel. But the smell and taste are perfect. If 90 Minute had the robust, thick, sizzling feel of say Dogfish Head-Palo Santo Marron, it would be unbeatable. 90 Minute looks and tastes dark. It could be a new beer style, a Brown American Double/Imperial IPA.","shacawgo24","Apr 15, 2014"

It hits the taste buds with that strong imperial IPA taste and the 9.0% alcohol (ABV) gives it that hard edge and wakes you up (or puts you to sleep if you drink too many). It pours darkish, with a reddish amber tint, finger sized tan head, and some carbonation. The main taste is bitter, with hoppy, caramel, fruity, and sweet. It finishes dry and leaves fruit like aftertaste. It is very filling. This is an awesome beer.","ChristopherWIU-UTPA","Apr 10, 2014"

I was drinking these back and forth with Hopslam, and to be honest, I think 90 minute IPA bests it. It is a phenomenal IPA made by a very phenomenal brewery. Can’t say enough about their line of products. This is a beer that lives up to its name.","Seanem44","Mar 27, 2014"

3.89,-9.1,3.5,3.75,4,4.25,3.75,"Bottle from Proof. Pours a coppery-gold-orange. Head was off white but faded under a minute. Good legs and lacing is decent. Collar has large bubbles and very small bubbles that hold together for a medium thickness. Wisps hold throughout. Aroma is resiny and toasty malt, a touch of citrus as well. Taste is that big malt backbone with the hops playing a much smaller role than I remember. I definitely haven't had this beer in a few years, and my palate has changed considerably. I get some of the resin and citrus in the palate, but it's mostly a caramel malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is sticky sugar-like, medium body, medium-high carbonation. Slightly boozey.","mverity","Mar 04, 2014"

Smells of sweet fresh hops, citrus, pine, and possibly caramel. Tastes of sweet malts, slight caramel, a hint of bitter hops; but yet completely smooth and indulgent. Light, creamy, and full bodied mouthfeel. Extremely well-balanced, complex, DIPA that cannot be ignored. Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA is my recommended all-time favorite Imperial IPA.

The aroma is of spiced hops and herbs, pine, wet earth/dirt, and distant citrus (orange and lemon zest mostly). It tastes of spicy, earthen hops, rich wood, wet earth, pine, and citrus. The mouthfeel is rich and full, but not heavy. Finish is crisp and refreshing with only a slight resinous sensation. Overall, this a unique, more earthen and “hearty” take on the IPA style; refreshing in this day’s market.","eclipse54","Feb 27, 2014"

Just the right hoppy bitterness but with a wonderful malt backbone to hold up to the hops. There are even some roasty notes reminiscent of coffee on the tail of this beer. To top it all off, it is extremely drinkable for a 9% er. This is everything a well crafted beer should be.","lochef81","Feb 15, 2014"

Smell is of some nice sweet caramel malt, with a nice floral bouquet from the hops. I get pineapple, guava, orange, and basically more tropical fruits from the hops. The nose seems to be very well balanced for the style. Taste is really almost exactly like the nose except the malts and hops are more forward but still just as balanced. There is a slight bit of bitterness in the taste that stays in the mouth and doesn't hit the throat much. The mouthfeel is sort of thinner than I expected but it seems to fit the style. Overall this is a REALLY well balanced beer for the style. I thought it would be a hop-bomb but it is nothing like that. Just a really well put together beer.","NeedBeerHere","Jan 02, 2014"

The complex hop profile presents citrus and fruit, giving way to a smoother, diacetyl sulfur and booze. The sweet malt graininess hits rewind, as if to rewrite the front-end bitterness that came before it. The two struggle and, in the end, leave a dry, surprisingly clean finish.","martyl1000","Dec 10, 2013"

Much rather drink this ipa over any sierra nevada. Im not a sierra nevada fan. I could drink this IPA all day long like an all day ipa. May be 9% but does not phase me because I am american.

Delicious super resiny hop aroma that tickles the nose but not without some sweet malty characteristics coming across as well especially as it warms. The taste is incredibly balanced. I was expecting this to be a serious hop bomb and don't be mistaken this is quite a hoppy beer but compared to some west coast imperial or double IPA's the flavor of this brew is not dominated by it's hop qualities and one can really pick up on it's roasted malt characteristics. This is a great beer but I think that is pretty much common knowledge by this point. I honestly don't even really know why I bothered reviewing this.

Inexplicably, I poured the last ounce of beer into the remainder of my chili, stirred it about and then...CRUSHED IT! Intrigued by my actions, the rest of those in attendance poured a little of the beer into their bowls and followed suit. We all silently stood up from our chairs. Made our way into the kitchen. Fixed another bowl of chili and cracked the last 90 Minute IPA and divided it up amongst us....directly into our chili.","Michael_DuBois","Nov 15, 2013"

I remember thinking it was so bitter and chewy that I could barely finish the bottle. My how my palate has changed as I gulp down the last drop this evening. Today's bottle was a reminder of what a good, old-school IIPA tastes like: bitter, herbal, full of pine, big hop oil, but with a healthy balance of caramel malt and well-integrated alcohol. Mouthfeel is also big and chewy. I like.","spoony","Oct 16, 2013"

It follows the 60 minute’s malty backbone with a strong malt flavor that help balance the enormous hops. This IIPA was very thick and chewy with plenty of hops on the front end that gave way to a smooth vanilla malt finish.

It looked & smelled great but tasted pretty much perfect with a great mix of sweet caramel malts and bitter hops with the usual citrus and grapefruit flavours coming through as well.

If you are new to dogfish head IPAs, I would definitely start off with 60 minute and graduate to this as I can definitely see it being a polarizing beer, but if you have the appreciation for good brewings, this beer is definitely a treat.","usechopstix4soup","Sep 24, 2013"
4.65,8.6,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Overall: This is far from your average IPA. It's amazing how 30 more minutes of boiling and hopping can make the 90 Minute so different from the 60 Minute. This is a true imperial IPA that tastes mature and commands respect. Dogfish, as always, has achieved something unique and complex with this brew. Many IPAs seem to measure themselves by the amount of hops they can cram in. The 90 Minute is hopped generously and the bitter punch is certainly there, but there is a rich flavor that makes this a really wonderful beer that stands out from the rest.","HookerBrews","Sep 24, 2013"

Taste was mild hops, somewhat bitter and a slight taste of the alcohol, but not too much. Very little aftertaste, went down smooth and refreshing considering the ABV.

Well rounded and balanced. Only criticism is that it's just a bit on the big side. It's got a high abv and finishes very very dry, which means one is more than enough for me. Forgivable since developing this much flavor in a smaller beer is pretty near impossible.","constantine_272","Aug 21, 2013"

The nose on this is out of control. Juicy, creamy pineapple - smells like an umbrella drink. The flavor is so solid and well structured, I'd say perfectly balanced malt and citrusy hops. Undetectable booze on 9% abv, and a clean, clean finish. This is just a perfectly balanced, delicious IIPA. Beautifully done.","BeerWizard","Aug 17, 2013"

With strong floral hops it's slightly different from the citrusy imperial ipa's such as Ruination/Ruinten/Hopslam. It's light comparing roses to grapefruit. Both are good but they're still completely different. I would keep this beer around just to compare to other IPAs, since it is so unique.","ISmith87","Aug 14, 2013"

4.12,-3.7,4.25,4,4.25,4,4,"Served on tap with solid lacing clinging to the glass. If you like your hops, you won't be disappointed with this. Both smell and taste feature pine, citrus, grapefruit, and floral notes/flavors. It's a bit spicy, the ABV is well concealed. The citrus seems to be a bit unbalanced, but the beer is still far more complex than I can appreciate. The mouthfeel is spot on, with medium thickness, just the right amount of dryness, and a dry but pleasant finish. While IPAs aren't my first choice, there's a lot to love about this one.","DeFaz","Aug 11, 2013"

They're good and I'd be glad to drink them, I appreciate what the guys at Dogfish Head are doing, but I feel they're slightly overhyped and overpriced. My main complaint with this brew is that it's just too damn sweet; I realize it may be a matter of personal taste, but I prefer lighter, more bitter flavors with my IPAs. All that said, you'd be missing out if you didn't at least try this beer. Cheers to good health and good beer.","Caj1","Jul 30, 2013"

You can see the intensity of the carbonation and cloudiness, culminating in an alcoholic monster that looks you in the eye and dares you to drink it. The aroma is rich with hoppiness. My tongue could see past the hop attack and pick up the pine and citrus that leaned more towards mango. The malt component helps to balance out what would otherwise become a near-fatal, but welcome, overdose of hops. Should the PTB at DFH ever decide to distribue in Iowa again it would be a welcome site.","DesMoinesMike","Jul 29, 2013"

This has been on my must-try list for quite some time, so I'm glad to have picked up a bottle on a recent trip to the US. Lots of good flavour happening that thinks outside the box of the standard imperial IPA style.","leaddog","Jul 19, 2013"

Make no mistake, this is a Hop A-Bomb. If there is a better DIPA, I have not tried it. A pleasure and one of the finest examples of the style on the East coast or the US for that matter.","hokieguy95","Jul 09, 2013"

I call most IPAs and APAs "hop waters" due to their pathetic lack of malt for the sake of cost and they just taste like chalk or bitter soap. This one has restored my faith that the Victorian IPA is not dead (despite being classified American IPA). This is not a casual everyday beer (it's a bit expensive) but something to go with a rich meal, Texas BBQ would pair well.","fizzgig","Jul 09, 2013"

3.9,-8.9,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,4,"Pours clear and orange amber with a scant finger of loose foam that didn’t last at all. Plenty of active carbonation. Left a thin ring and a small cap. Nose is sweet orange on top of tall bread and caramel. A touch of floral and pine, a little honey and grass. Smells like sugar. The nose on this beer is perfectly sweet and juicy. Taste is piney hops with a bit of oil on a full malt base. Nutty, sweet and floral, somewhat tame. A little sticky and buttery. It’s syrupy in the almost dry finish and it’s pretty sweet. So sweet that you might not realize just how bitter the hops really are until they tickle the back palate with a little oil and bitter. Achieves a smooth balance between all it has to offer from both hops and malt. Polite yet engaging.Very approachable even with the higher abv and was quite charming.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

American light toasted malt as well, with a touch of alcohol for good measure. flavor is hop heavy, but again the sweeter rather than the bitter. I get some malt sweetness too, but most of it comes from the hops, oily as hell. just enough grain to balance it out. long finish, alcohol is barely present. I could stand a little more carbonation on this, but its not flat, its just personal preference for me. feels a touch heavy in that way, but its more so when its warmer. ice cold its epic, just doesn't drink too fast. fuller bodied, I think a 4 pack is the exactly correct dose on this. one of the pioneering big india pales, still up to snuff.","StonedTrippin","May 14, 2013"

The attractive dark color and massive head draw you in and the earthy, malty scent is fitting. Very malty taste that offers sweet and earthy flavors with average hoppyness. The nice full body and creamy texture is a great finish. This one lived up to its reputation and I would recommend it to any IPA fan. Excellent brew.","jschwanke84","May 11, 2013"

Taste is really malty with a lot of citrus and sweetness. For a 90 IBU beer, this comes off not very bitter at all. The bitterness is there but the sweetness covers it up nicely. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied. Pretty thick for an IPA. Carbonation is just above average. Overall, I love this IIPA. Dogfish Head have done it again. They're known for their strange beers and this is no exception. Wow. I need to find 120 minute IPA now.","MisSigsFan","May 04, 2013"

The smell is very hoppy and awesome, however the taste is balanced with big malt flavor. Even at 9% abv it is very drinkable and has a nice finish that wants you to go back for more. If you are afraid of IPAs and hops try this beer it will change your mind and taste.","golfntiger","May 03, 2013"

More caramel malt and hop dynamic is not present but is compensated by the bump in ABV while keeping an appropriate balance. Perhaps a bit hyped, but a solid IPA. Definitely preferred over 60 min if I had the choice. Malt is showcased more here compared to the 60 min where the hops are the centerpiece.","yottachem","Apr 11, 2013"

DFH gets a ton of criticism for their more more esoteric, and sometimes unsuccessful experimental brews, but this one they have nailed.  A perfect balance of astringent hops and luscious malt, it still a classic.  It pours a rich orange with a modest head, but great lacing throughout the drinking period.  The smell does not overwhelm, but is rich with pine, herbal and a light citrus scent.  The taste is what makes this a great one.  Even after having dozens of these over the years, I marvel at the complexities presented.","SFNC","Apr 07, 2013"
4.47,4.4,4,3.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,"O: Very nice beer. Surprisingly sweet and not as hoppy or bitter as you might expect for a double-IPA, but it works very nice overall, along with a unique mouthfeel.

I think the hop flavors have receded after these two months and I feel it's unfair to review it based on such an old bottle. However, this is what was available to me at the store, so others may find it in the same condition. It's still pleasant and balanced, just lacks the fresh hop flavor I was expecting. Probably closer to a Scotch Ale at this point, with its caramel dominance. Drinkability is high, alcohol doesn't stand out.","jibbyvonjibb","Mar 28, 2013"

While an awesome full body beer, it did not leave you feeling like you drank something heavy and did not leave you bloated allowing you to enjoy more. At 9% you get a nice little kick. This is a great beer to have with dinner or just to sit down and enjoy a few. I would be hard pressed to think of a better beer. A must for all real beer aficionados. Enjoy! I probably would drink it all the time if it was just a little lower in price but still very reasonably priced for a beer in this category of this magnitude. My first 5!!! Dogfish head Burton Barton is slightly better, but because of the affordability factor when comparing this one puts it right there too.","Wrigfen","Mar 07, 2013"

I would say that the hops are more present in the 60 minute but that isn't to say that the 90 minute doesn't have it's fair share. The malt is way more pronounced in this beer. Very drinkable at 9.0% and I can see why this is so highly rated. Would definitely buy this again.","JaredM","Jan 30, 2013"

This IIPA poured a hazy golden color, produced a nice thick white head, retention was great, and it left good amount of lace on the glass. The Aroma of the ale consisted of fresh pine needles, apples and herbal notes. Full bodied, this IIPA has a great malted grain base, ample amount of oily, piney hop flavor, there are some notes of fresh pressed apple juice. The mouthfeel of this IIPA is very smooth and silky... The bitter hop flavor sticks from start to finish. One of my favorite IPA's- Can't wait to sample some of Dogfish's other IPA's.","GossageBrewery","Jan 16, 2013"

Then there is the backlash to the hype, and then the backlash to the backlash. This beer has gone from one of the most under-rated in the world, to one of the most over-rated, and has now settled in nicely to where it should have always been: a phenomenally drinkable, flavorful, and distinctly aromatic beer that is palatable for even the most novice IPA lovers. Way back in the day I fell in love with Imperials once the flashy, sexy 90-minute hit my virgin lips. Sure, I've had other love affairs with plenty of other DIPAs since then, and I have 90 less and less frequently, but don't let anybody tell you differently: the thrill is still there everytime I crack a new one.","brewsclues","Jan 08, 2013"

The extra boil and hopping has created something that Dr. Frankenstein strove for: an almost perfect creation. While ol' Frankie was rewarded with grunts and angry gesturing, the geniuses at Dogfish Head were rewarded with this amazing brew. Everything is so smooth and balanced...totally sessionable and the 9% ABV is completely unnoticeable. Amazing and worth buying and enjoying again and again.","BeerDocT","Nov 19, 2012"

The smell is citrus, biscuit, grass, and strangely enough a sort of rubbery smell I can't quite pin down. The taste is very sweet upfront with powerful malt. The hops hit on the finish, but the malts seem to be a little more powerful. There is a small alcohol warmth to the finish as well. Mouthfeel is decent with some carbonation and without too much bitterness in the aftertaste. This one is good enough with an awesome taste, but I think given this one or the 60 minute IPA, I might actually like the 60 minute better.","Mojo","Nov 14, 2012"

4.17,-2.6,4.25,4,4.25,4,4.25,"Bottled 08/03/2012, poured into a snifter. About two fingers of very light tan creamy head, with fluffy clouds clinging to the inside of the glass as head fades. Beautiful hazy orange color. Aromas of malt and spice are not immediately noticeable, however, but come through as 90 minute sits for a bit. Light caramel and a bready smell are also present. All aromas become more prominent and enjoyable as I drink the beer. Taste is very balanced, with spices, sweetness, hops and malt all noticeable, no single characteristic dominates. Dry on the end, with spice aftertaste perfect for this early November weather. Perhaps a bit of citrus, orange/grapefruit, on the end as well. Mouthfeel is balanced, very nicely, with medium carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall this is a wonderful beer. Have not had it since last March or so, but recall fond memories of finishing off a case of 90 minute over the holidays last year with my brother and father. Cheers.","rodlavers","Nov 02, 2012"

Or maybe my palate has just changed. I also prefer a good bit of alcohol taste on big beers, which this did not really have until near its finish for me. Regardless, still one of my favorite beers, and favorite IPAs of course. Has a good bit of sweetness and a strong malt backbone to balance, but the hops are still able to stand out (although not as much as I remember).","MrBoh","Oct 25, 2012"

I would never believe this was 90 IBUs because it is so sweet. It makes them unique IPAs, but they seem a bit sickening to drink more than one or two in a sitting.

It falls right in my wheelhouse, since I am a fan of highly dark and malty beers that are medium hoppy and have a "bracing" level of ABV. It's easy to drink but not a guzzling beer by any means. It just happens to fall in that hard-to-reach spot that I personally like... where the beer has body and boldness without turning into a super bitter hop-fest. Only caveat is that it's on the edge of being too strong to be "refreshing", so like I say... don't guzzle. Sip.","tcoreyb","Oct 15, 2012"

It's hop heavy up front and in the smell, but the malts come through on the finish. I love it. There's also a bit of warmth as well, making this a perfect Autumn beer. The feel of this one bothers me a tad, though. The whole beer itself is legendary, but I almost feel this beer to be a bit too syrupy to have more than one in a sitting. Regardless of all of that, 90 Minute IPA is an absolute must try. It may be $3 a bottle, but trust me -- there is a reason.","Alextricity","Oct 15, 2012"

4.2,-1.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/25/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear golden orange color with a nice 2 finger dense cream colored head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, orange rind, herbal, floral, pine, caramel, biscuit, mango, peach, toast, and earthiness. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good strength and complexity. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, pine, herbal, floral, caramel, toast, biscuit, peach, mango, and earthy spiciness. Good amount of smooth and spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, caramel, biscuit, toast, nuttiness, pine, peach, mango, and light herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance of pronounced caramel and toasty malt sweetness, with smoothly bitter hop flavors; very good flavor complexity and balance as well. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a pretty creamy, slick, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent DIPA. The English two row adds a nice unique dimension to the flavor profile; and it has a very smooth balance of hoppiness with the malt profile. Highly enjoyable, and I am glad I was able to get this really fresh for this re-review after not having had this one for a couple years.","superspak","Aug 09, 2012"

Manages to deliver a ton of hop flavor, without being the cloyingly bitter hop bomb that most DIPAs seem to be. This is right at the top of the list, as it manages to be a complex, full-bodied ale while still having a ton of hop flavor. It's nice to have a DIPA that realizes there should be more to a beer than just bitterness. Very well done, this is a DIPA to drink over, and over, and over again.","kdb150","Aug 09, 2012"

4.28,0,4,3.5,4.5,5,4.5,"This is the beer that introduced me to a world i never knew (craft beer as a whole) ever since I, for no reason other than curiosity (well maybe it was the Esquire review on the colorful 4-pack), purchased some one day around 4 years ago. Every time I've poured this (it's been many an occasion now) it's been a brief head that settles quickly, with a thin lacing. The first time i tried this I didn't like it I thought. Yet I was still somehow intrigued by it...Long story short, it turned out it was because I had no prior beer experience other than low abv. mass-made swill from my college years. The smell (due to its subtlety) was never what did it for me with this now go-to DIPA. A burnt malty grapefruit sensation upon tasting this. Boozy then smoothed out by a terrific malt backbone. Although a heavy hitter, I could easily have 2 in a row and they both go down ever so smoothly due to the mouthfeel alone. While my taste buds easily prefer several others of this style, this one will always be in regular rotation because it's just unique. There is a caramel aspect to it, syrupy, not as outright hoppy as what I prefer. But in the end it's got it's own complex character I seem to revisit with regularity.","TBoneJones","Jul 22, 2012"

Mouthfeel is oh so smooth, slightly carbonated, with citrus, malt, and hop balance that puts it into the category of excellent imperial ipa's.

The taste follows my expectation from the smell. A nice mix of malty sweetness and bitter hops. Definitely more malty than most DIPAs. Somewhat thick feel and just the right amount of carbonation. Love it. One of my favorite beers.","Danny1217","Jul 14, 2012"

This offering has a slightly sweet malt flavor upfront followed by a blast of hop bitterness that lingers long into the finish. This is a spectacular beer - the perfect combination of malt and strong hop flavors. My personal #1 DIPA - the only question is: do I like the bottled or on-tap version best.","57md","Jul 11, 2012"

Granted, I'd rather have a malty caramel syrup taste to balance it out than just have bitter hops all the way through. That said, I like stouts, nutty brown ales, and other less hop-forward beers more than I like IPAs.","mfc","Jul 10, 2012"

Not much of any hop presence it seems. Taste almost has some butterscotch flavor to it, some breadiness, some molassess, with some mild bitterness in the finish.Medium body to this, slight activity.

The flavor profile incorporates such a large array of competing flavors but they're balanced and nothing predominates to the detriment of other flavors. This combines the complexity of some of my favorite Belgian Trappist ales with the bigness and boldness of one of my favorite American styles, and does it stunningly. Well done, Dogfish Head.","Edruil","Jun 25, 2012"

The great overall flavor of light citrus & floral notes, balanced with a strong, but not overpowering hops profile, leads to a great IPA to share with friends.","Josefchervenka","Jun 05, 2012"

4.92,15,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Thanks are due to EgadBananas for providing this bottle. Poured into a pint glass. Pours light clear amber with a tall, eggshell colored head. Plenty of tiny bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. The head retains very well, dissipating slowly and leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. There are aromas of piney hops, citrusy hops, and sweet malts. It smells a little earthy as well. Hops dominate the flavor. All the hop flavors blend together very well with the sweet malts. It starts bitter and there's caramel sweetness from the malts. The sweet bitter aftertaste lingers, but it is mild. I do not notice the alcohol in the flavor. The body is medium with some carbonation. The drinkability is very high for such a big beer. Overall, this is an excellent beer. People wanting to try a DIPA should try this beer.","acevenom","Jun 01, 2012"

4.2,-1.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Tons of flavors on the first sip. Loads of hops, malt, and alcohol. Alcohol is heavier than I remember, and a little off-putting early on. Of course, it starts to blend in better with later sips. Hops dominate the entry and finish, with citrus flavors at entry and a lot of vegetal bitterness left in the aftertaste on the back of the tongue. Mid-palate is pretty sweet, with a heavy load of malt. It's interesting how the flavors start off similar to many other citrusy IPAs, but then kick into another gear and make this a very distinctive beer.","grannaniwa","May 05, 2012"

The smell is dominated by earthy, grassy, and floral hops and a bit of fruit with citrus accents. Floral hops first greet the tastebuds, transitioning to sweet malt backbone and finishing with a slight grassy bitterness. The mouthfeel is exceptional an abudant malt backbone, smooth and very creamy. 90 Minute IPA is a modern American beer classic and an exceptional brew.","chanokokoro","Apr 18, 2012"

Has a real nice floral and slight malty aroma which is very pleasant. Tastes of very sweet malt with heavy hops with sight citrus taste. It is very hoppy yet has balance. This light to medium bodied beer has great carbonation and a great finish. Overall, an extremely good beer and another great beer from Dogfish Head.","cyclonece09","Apr 14, 2012"

I had resisted trying this brew due to the price, but finally caved in when I had to bring some beer over to a friend who is fond of IPA’s. Great hoppy aroma comes off of this brew, which I find separates the great IPA’s from the good. Rather than your first sip starting out malty with a hop finish, the 90 minute blasts you with hops from the word go. There are lots of hop tones, such as grapefruit and peach, and a decent amount of bitter coming through, but it works well. The highlight of this beer comes at about half glass when your tongue has become accustomed to the assault of hops, complex malt flavors start to come through. This Dogfish Head product is not your every day IPA, but a fantastic special occasion statement brew.","iSip","Mar 09, 2012"

First sip; I can taste the hops but the aftertaste of a well-balanced malt and hops duo. I can drink this all day long; but I wouldn’t it packs 9% ABV….I am doing my part, how about you?

DFH nails each category here with this one. I'm glad I finally reviewed this as sometimes when I drink this it tastes really really good and tonight is one of those times.

With that in mind I’d say overall, this is a pretty good brew but not much better than average for the style. I hadn’t had this beer in a few years and its very different than I remember (I remembered it as an absolute hop bomb with almost nothing to balance it out), and it is better than I remembered. That being said, there are certainly a number of significantly better DIPAs out there. This beer lacks the depth and complexity that is present in the best ones. I would have again if it was offered to me, but running out and grabbing a 4 pack isn’t on my to do list.","zac16125","Feb 15, 2012"

Flavor follows with big toffee notes, lots of bitter grapefruit, and a smooth malty finish. This is on the malty side for the style but is nicely balanced with the bitter pine and grapefruit. Slick mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Overall, this is a solid DIPA from Dogfish, but I just don't get all the love for it.

The taste is where I notice a real difference from past times that I have tried this beer (may just be because this is my first beer in a few days, and this is the first multiple day break from beer I have had in a while). The taste is very hoppy, but very balanced with a strong malt flavor as well. There is also a very sweet and fruity flavor. There is a alcoholic hint, but not too strong. Overall, this is definitely one of the best DIPAs I have had, if not the best. Also, it is probably one of the most widely available ones. I highly recommend trying it.","BeerNoobNC","Feb 07, 2012"

The aroma is very complex, some definite citrus hops up front with a strong sweet caramel malt backbone and a touch of smokiness. This glass/keg also had a bit of diacetyl which the server warned me about. I can detect it only because he alerted me to it's presence, I probably would have written the butterscotch off as hops+caramel. The taste is very smooth and complex. The hop forwardedness of the nose is balanced on the palate with the strong malt character and a touch of warming alcohol. The mouthfeel is silky smooth and exactly what I am looking for in a DIPA. Overall this is a really nice beer, a bit maltier than other DIPAs I have had (Pliny, Mycenery) but very nice.","quirkzoo","Jan 21, 2012"

A nice dark yellow pour with a head that does disappear but laces nicely down the glass. The reason I am finally doing a review in writing is because I had the 90 Minute IPA with sushi today for lunch. What a combo! The beer with its hoppiness, its clean palate, and citrus/pine finish following a spicy california roll and some raw tuna and salmon was phenomenal. I got nervous at first because I am a little crazy with the wasabi at times but noticed that the seafood and rice teamed up with the pickled ginger and wasabi was complimented completely with the beer. I love good beer and I love good food, the only thing better than both is to find something that goes incredibly together. This was one of those moments.","sniper061","Dec 09, 2011"

This beer uses English Barley which gives it a relatively creamier and maltier flavor as compared to a citrusy west coast IPA. Upon first sip, one can easily appreciate the subtle balance and flavors and alcohol which enters the palate. This IPA has a substantial foamy head and smells of molasses and hops. It's hard to describe the 90 minute IPA besides just saying that it has a sophisticated and high quality taste.","BenHesk12","Dec 08, 2011"

The smell is not very strong, but what I smell is crackers and pine. The taste is the same, with a lot of nutty, bread flavor. It is not thick the way a lot of DIPA's of this strength are.

Not overpowering but pleasant smelling. Taste is delicious. Very well balanced with malts and sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and overall this is an excellent beer.

Nice ring of lacing that falls slowly after sipping, but hangs around the entire beer. Smell is apricot, pine, hints of carmel, some grass, and some pineapple. Taste is similar, the apricot leads, with a great balance of pine, carmel, grass, and pineapple in the finish. Really well balanced beer malts and hops hold hands, neither tries to still the show. On the larger side for the body, but very drinkable for it's ABV. Nice amount of life and the alcohol is well hidden. I think it is going to get a higher grade than I would have expected. Great price under $10 a four back and thank you DFH for the bottle date 10/11/11. My first DIPA ever years ago and it still impresses.","SawDog505","Nov 15, 2011"

Aromas are predominantly of honey and oranges, with a fain whiff of that high abv and funky ethers coming off the top. The taste and texture blow my socks off. The sweet and bitter elements are both intensely concentrated and yet perfectly balanced and finessed at the seams where they meet. Caramel and honey sweetness blend harmoniously with orange and grapefruity tastes while gentle floral notes float delicately through the senses. The gentle, ultra-fine carbonation could not possibly be better. This is a very fine beer, one that I think should be enjoyed entirely on its own.","droomyster","Oct 30, 2011"

Pours a beautiful orangish-yellow with excellent head retention and lacing. Smell? I can't even describe really.. Same for the flavor. There is so, so much going on in this beer yet it's so wonderfully balanced. Such a smooth, well hopped and well spiced bew. So many flavors I don't know where to start yet again, so well balanced. High abv is masked masterfully, save for the slightest bite of an aftertaste that really contrasts and enhances the delicious, sweet maltiness. Gotta get my hands on some more DFH.

The first one I found quite sweet, the second too bitter, the 3rd not hoppy at all...

The best description (that I borrowed from another reviewer) is that it has a "cake like" quality. The only downside is that the high alcohol content is hidden behind this extremely smooth brew. And it can sneak up on you.","Ilovesuds","Aug 13, 2011"
3.88,-9.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall, it's a good beer and a solid DIPA. It's got far more caramel malt/dark fruit character than any other DIPA I've had, almost making it barley wine like, but the hops are definitely there. It's sweetish, but never quite goes into 'sweet' with the persistent hoppy character. Glad to have tried it but in the end I must admit it's just not my thing. If you're into the darker, maltier DIPAs then this should roll right through your alley. Otherwise, if you find yourself concentrating on well-accentuated hop characters, this might be a bit of a turn off.","Klym","Aug 10, 2011"

The beer was a light, pale copper-golden color with a thick, two and a half inch layer of big-bubbled, biege head. Aromas of grapefruit and pear, with a heavy dose of tangy hops, with a lemon-peppered like spice to it. Flavors are very well balanced, with citrus-pear sweet tones once again, balanced with a peppery, roasted hops character that takes over the palate. The sweetness and the round body keep the hops from being too dry, and the carbonation level keeps it light and crisp. Great lace cling on the glass. The aftertaste is slight caramel malt and hops, with a clean and smooth finish. Very tasty!","GarthDanielson","Aug 09, 2011"

Big mango, apricot, grapefruit followed up by a warm but light lingering alcohol feel. Big sugary fruits touch on the tongue, followed with some spice and alcohol, very sweet and delicious. Full on the body, this beer has a big sugary feel to it that makes it a total sipping beer, but its is creamy and smooth and sweet.

A nice cream colored cap leaving semi stick, good retention. Smell is the standard 90 minute with a heaping of malt giving off a candi like vibe. Cherry comes through minimally, cant really smell the hops under all of that. Taste is a rush of malt and candi sugar up front. Not sure how the candi sugar gets there since it is not used but that's what I get. After that rum soaked cherry with minimal rum and mo cherry. The aftertaste is where the cascade comes through giving off bitterness and floral all at once. Sweet with faded candi taste, if the cascade was not run through the randall this would be a hot mess cause 90 minute is kinda ewww.

The hops are a bit subdued, but you kknow they're there, and their role in both the smell and taste of the beer are still front and center.

The taste right of of the gates is hops, bitter taste(almost like pepper), then the malts come in at the finish(back of the tongue). Very nice mouth feel.

4.63,8.2,4.5,4,5,5,4.5,"Impression: This is a buttery, sweet beer which trades the genera's usual hop-pounding for a more balanced, desertlike approach. It is also unusually strong, which makes it a dangerous beer, considering it has a combination easy drinkability, delicious flavor, and high alcohol percentage. You see where I'm going here. This beer is best enjoyed with plenty of time to savor and respect it. Its flavor will immediately inform you that is not to be guzzled, but considered thoughtfully. I can't imagine enjoying this at a party - only alone or with a couple friends with lots of time to sit. This is an excellent brew, though DIPA usually denotes a hop explosion, and that's what I tend to prefer in these kinds of beers. This is an extremely successful malty version, and for those inclined to belgian beers who want something slightly hoppier in the summer, I recommend this.","XsoreXsubjectX","Jun 16, 2011"

At 90 IBU’s in 90 minute versus 45 IBU’s in the Samuel Smith you can see the Dogfish methods in hopping are really great. A nice mellow citrus and malt taste that goes down really smooth.

Pours a clear orange-brown with a nice foamy off-white head, much like it's brother beer, but a bit lighter. Floral aroma, with pine and citrus. Smooth, mild and pleasant on the palate, with the notes of the aroma following right through in the taste. Citrus hops complimented just right with sweet malts, with a little bit of sugar or light caramel taste coming through. Not too strong in the hop department for an imperial IPA. Pleasantly smooth and balanced mouthfeel, and highly drinkable.","Rifugium","May 01, 2011"

3.8,-11.2,4,4,3.5,4,4,"This is a very interesting, yet deceiving beer. For my taste it is not a traditional Imperial IPA which would provide a citrus smell and more hops but that isn't a bad thing. It's a full bodied beer which relies more heavily on its malts than hops. The end result is more of a dark brown sugar flavor which provides a very enjoyable sweetness.

It is a bit resinous, but otherwise, the bitterness seems quite pure, which I find much more pleasing than the piney bitterness I have to endure in most IPAs. The taste is very very sweet with caramel notes in addition to the bitterness. There is also a very noticeable alcohol flavour.

3.77,-11.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"This beer really picks up where the 60 left off yet still falls a bit short in some areas. Mainly the lack of an aggressive hop presence one would expect from a beer that had a "constant 90-minute hop addition." As a whole, like the 60 Minute, it is a very solid and respectable beer that is easily enjoyable. No small feat considering the high ABV. While the 60 left me wanting more in the way of a more full body, the 90 left me wanting a more assertive hop presence. I really enjoyed this beer and maybe I'm being a bit too hard on it. I guess what it boils down to is would I recommend this beer to friend? I would, without a doubt.","CrookedStill","Apr 11, 2011"

3.83,-10.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Although I enjoyed this beer, I feel that my expectations for an IPA represent something much different being that I am from the west coast. 90 minute pours an amber color with a one finger off white head, decent head and retention for a beer at 9% ABV. Alcohol comes through strongly in the most alongside the hops and caramel malt. I found myself craving a heavy hand of hops in the taste, this IIPA is certainly much more balanced than others, with a more notable addition of caramel malt. Mouthfeel was decent. Overall, a good beer, but I'll stick with my west coast IPAs.","gkunkle","Apr 09, 2011"

I've heard a lot of people lately bash this a little because it's 'too sweet' in their opinion, but it's the bigger maltiness that actually makes me like this more. After re-tasting this, I can really appreciate this as what it seems to be: not a purely American DIPA, but as an imperial American take on an English IPA. And I still think it's one of the best brews out there.","TheWhiskerReview","Apr 08, 2011"

Smell is definitely hoppy with some caramel notes. Taste is very well balanced with some lightly roasted malts up front and a slight bitter hop finish. Not nearly as bitter as I thought it would be. Also does not have any alcohol taste despite being 9% ABV. Very good mouthfeel, light and goes down dangerously easy.

Im a huge Ranger fan and really love that style, but to say thats better is ridiculous. I haven't had the privilege of trying PtY or PtE like some of you, but i'd like to think i've had a few IPAs, however none of them have been as much as an eye open as this one has. Notice I didn't say much about the flavor, that's cause I wasn't sure what to put, I almost don't want to insult the brewmaster. Just stop reading and go pick some up. The 60 is okay, not as good as this. In my opinion the 60 is borderline IPA. I will continue to respect DFH for what they really are and not the word on the street. Beautiful brew!!!

The price per ounce is about the same as Hop Stupid, next time I want a good DIPA I might be inclined to get 2 singles of this rather then my go to bomber of Hop Stupid.

Also a bit of candied-fruit in there somewhere. Clean bitterness that sits right above a well-positioned caramel malty backbone. Deep fruits.

What a smooth brew.  Initial attack is all hops but the malt pulls it's weight and balances this brew.  Alcohol is definitely there but not in an unpleasant way.  Actual the contrary, has a nice warming affect.  Solid mouthfeel and drinkability at 9%.  Love this brew.","nickshep7","Mar 09, 2011"

There is a lot of great varying hoppy taste in this one - and the aftertaste sticks around for a while, acts as a nice relaxing beer. A nice full mouth-feel, thick almost like a creamy, syurp-y feel. This beer is potent, at 9% ABV, I may be on a smaller weight-class, but I can feel a decent buzz about 4/5 through one.

Flavor is a battle between fresh piney hops and slightly sweet sticky malt and sugar. Super good drinkability with little sign of the heavy gravity. Not a beer you can drink easily all night due to power and flavor potency.

On the nose there is a strange note that I've had in other beers, sometimes to a fault, that I can't put my finger on. Wild mushrooms, brussel sprouts? That really dominates the nose for me, not necessarily detrimental but not my favorite nose, either. In the mouth that wild mushroom note transforms into a biggish hop presence, not super citrusy or piney but sweet with a tingle, with some other sweet tones like grapefruit coming through later. In the mouth those flavors linger on in a medium body with the hops and carbonation keep prickling on for a while. It's quite drinkable for a DIPA, and the alcohol is hidden pretty well.

This is so rich and sweet with a boozy toffeeish finish. Alcohol is masked by all the sweetness but it's almost like a 9% Belgian in terms of it's weight. For me, this is tasty but it steps outside the realm of everything I like about American IPA's, bold assertive bitterness and hoppiness that balance a huge malt bill and keep you coming back for more. Here the palate is just too sticky and sweet to make this at all sessionable. Actually difficult to finish a 10oz pour.

Not the hop bomb I expected but still has enough bitterness and minty/earthy hop to justify the classification. Nice malt backbone throughout. Medium bodied with a clean finish.

Aroma is fruity hops, a bit of citrus fruit similar to a witbier, perhaps raisins, very faint hint of pine. Mouthfeel is very thick like a stout, a bit creamy. Flavor begins with fruity hops, smoke, pine, caramel malted barley. Trails off with building bitterness of hops, alcohol, pine, and a faint hint of citrus hops.

I got a deal on a 4pk @ $7.99 so I figured I'd see what all the hype was about. I cant understand why the package is labeled as being "One of the best IPA's in America", when this beer is more closely related to Red Brick's Brown Ale. Overall I guess it was a "ok" buy.. Not really impressed, seeing as there are way better examples of the style out there. I'd pass this one up when looking for a nice IIPA. Southern Tier's XIPA blows this beer away by all means.

And I mean one from this current four pack I am drinking now. Bottled on 12/17/10 so it is pretty damn fresh. First beer of the night so I am able to take time with it. This is much more bitter than I recall. Not as sickening sweet either. Could be because it is fairly cold. But there is quite a hop bite with huge pineapple and some sour green apple. I can sense the caramel like malts but they are subdued a bit to the cold. The aftertaste is something I don't care for. The sweetness linger far after the bitterness but I do like it more than the first time I had it. If it weren't for the sweetness I could see drinking a fair bit of these.

The aroma is a big pine/cut grass pine aroma with notes of tropical fruit and a slight malt backbone peaking through. It's downright difficult to get my nose out this beer. My fist sip completely assaults my taste buds with bitter and dry piney hops. After a short recovery a nice balanced malt presence is noticeable. The mouthfeel is a little rugged, nice body but I think big hop bombs like this tend to be aggressive on the pallet (I know how obvious that is).

What strikes me about this beer is the balance-, it is exceptionally aligned. Best IPA/DIPA in America? No, but I'd put it in the top ten, which is significant. If you don't have a great local IPA or don't have access to a store with a diverse selection, this might be the default great IPA that is available, as I've even been seeing Dogfish Head in chain groceries lately. Highly recommended.","chicagoabbot","Dec 03, 2010"

It smells like that piney hop smell that I'd expect out of a nicely hopped IPA plus with some fruit smells probably from the mixture of hops they use and the fruity yeast strain. The taste is that piney and citrus fruit flavor combined with a thicker more robust roasted malt flavor than the 60 minute. It still has that same malt flavor just a lot more of it so it comes off as richer tasting. The hops leave a nice resinous bite that mixes in with the citrus hops they use and that fruity alcohol yeast thing they have going on. This beer is amazing and one of the best tasting and ridiculously balanced Imperial IPA's ever. On tap it had a bit more bite but I'm sure if you get this super fresh in the bottle it will have that same effect. All in all one of my favorite beers of all time.","thebrood1987","Nov 14, 2010"

The head also leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass as well. It smells good, but I thought the hops were gonna stand out more. I also smell Caramel or Toffee. Really I think it smells pretty much like the 60 minute just a little stronger. Go figure. Taste is a amazing citrus hops that nice and present. good malty caramel taste, and a little bite of alcohol come in before the finish. Nice carbonation with a medium mouthfeel. Very drinkable beer. This is definitely one of my go to beers, it's just a great overall beer. I strongly recomend this beer to anyone. The only thing I would say that could improve it a little bit is that I wish there was just a little more kick from the hops. Great beer though. Way to go again DFH.","JizackFH","Oct 24, 2010"

4.32,0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Time to step things up a notch and try out the Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA. I've been holding onto this one for a couple of weeks but I figured I'd better drink it before it loses the majority of its hop characteristics. Pours kind of a tangelo orange brown, with very little head. Granted, I'm using a snifter for this one so I wasn't really looking for a big ass head. I might use a tumbler if I come across one of these again. Nose is an incredible detonation of hop aroma. Floral and citrus hops are there and there's this raisin sent underneath, almost like what you'd get out of a dark Belgian strong ale. Kind of surprising, actually. My first impressions while taking my sample is dang, this beer is smooth. It's very full, almost thick, with a slight alcohol burn in the finish. It's more well rounded and less sharp than the 60 minute IPA, especially in the finish. There's hops here, to be sure, and we'll catalog those in a moment, but I think it's important to note I actually think this may be less bitter than the 60 minute IPA. Either that, or the assload of malt that's in this lends a huge sweetness that helps you push through the bitterness. I mentioned the Belgian Strong earlier when talking aroma, and that comparison is valid when talking about the mouthfeel. It's thick, bordering on syrupy. Huge sticky lacing just coats the glass. Raisins are there in the taste too. It's extremely malt centric, with a roasted caramel syrup note that really sticks out for me. The hops are most certainly there in this one, with pine and orange rind coming out the more that you drink it. They're not as pronounced as I would like. Not sure if that's what the brewer intended, or because this one sat on the shelf for a while before I picked it up. Regardless, this is one phenomenal beer. As I said I'm not completely sold on it being a double IPA, but it's very good nonetheless.","eclaycamp","Oct 21, 2010"

I'm still a n00b beer drinker but I can't help but feel like the bitterness of the hops just overwhelms the malt and any pine flavors, it just sort of ends up feeling really heavy. One thing I have to say though is that the alcohol is hidden quite well. I guess the hops just sort of cover up the high alcohol content and honestly, I was surprised that i put away nearly the whole bottle so fast, which just shows it's relatively easy to drink.

Head was one finger and left some nice lacing down the glass. Color was typical of any other American IPA. Nose was nice, but not overpowering. Taste was similar to 60 Min, but a bit more of everything. For some reason, I find an earthiness to DFH IPAs--- this follows suit.

3.18,-25.7,4.5,4,3,3.5,2,"The 90 Minute IPA is an imbalanced, bitter IPA. It's incredibly hoppy, but fails to extract and retain some of the best qualities of the hops it's brewed with.

Taste is quite sweet brownsugar and hops up front with a boozy middle and a mildly bitter end. Mouthfeel has noticeable but not at all unpleasant alcohol warming, with a definitive syrupy character but both are well balanced making this quite nice to drink. It is easy to drink given its alcohol content but I would tend to shy away from any more than 3 at once, and 3 is a bit of a stretch.","STEG","Jun 30, 2010"

The aroma pure fresh green hop. If you have ever picked hops you know that fresh slightly oily, slightly earthy green aroma. The hop taste is balanced with an assertive yet low key maltiness that seems to support the hops rather than battle with them. 90 IBU's and 9% ABV and you will be warm and hoppy all night long.

Living on the west coast, this does not smell like your typical DIPA. Also get a bit of melon in the nose. Taste is amazing. This is the beer that kinda got me started and hooked on Dogfish Head. Taste is just so well balanced. If you were to compare this to a west coast DIPA, it would almost be like comparing apples to oranges IMO. There's so much more malt and candy sweetness to this brew. The 60 minute is a nice toned down version of this, but they have so many similarities. The high abv (9%) is barely noticeable...until it starts to warm up. I suggest drinking this beer at around 40 degrees. You don't miss out on any of the smells or flavor, but you do miss out on the alcohol making itself a leading member of your taste buds.

It's bitter, but not so bitter to deter non-traditional IPA drinkers from giving it a try.

Not quite what I expected for a Double/Imperial IPA, but still pretty good for a beer in general. Most Double IPA's I've had are generally unfiltered. This beer has some better than average lacing to it. The smell is pretty good, not as hoppy as I expected, but the maltiness is kicked up a notch. Pretty good, but I'd expect a little more from a DIPA. I find many DIPA's to be very strong, but this one seems to be struggling to find it's identity in the smell department. The smell pretty sweet, almost a light toffee and some pine hops follow. The taste is a step up. Again it's pretty heavy on the malts, caramelized malts a d some citrus/pine hops to follow it up. It almost has a bit of a buttery taste to it as well. The mouthfeel is the best part in my opinion. It touches on all the major points that beer drinkers like. It's well balanced, more full bodied. Has a smooth texture (mentioned the buttery taste ealier), and not too much or too little carbonated, yet it finishes clean and a little bitter. It's a good drinkable beer as well. I found it difficult to review this beer a little based on the style. It really tasted more like a regular IPA than a Double IPA. I've had more IPA's with more DIPA characteristics than this. Still a reliable beer, but I guess I just expected more. Worth the try.","AndyAvalanche","May 29, 2010"

Great amber color, head formation and retention. Bright, fresh hops on the nose rounded by an underlying malty sweetness. The hops might not be as fresh as you would like but a few months hasn't hurt this beer too much. It has a supple texture without being overly malty like some high ABV imperials can err towards. The hops are at the fore throughout. Start to finish the malt stays in the background, allowing the hops to be prominently displayed without being overpowering. This might not pack the IBUs but its well-rounded character makes it very drinkable. I wish they would put this in a bomber.","hoppyhampy","Apr 28, 2010"

By the number of reviews, EVERYONE knows this beer. It's no wonder - great beer, reasonably priced and widely distributed. I like the 60, the 120 not at all, and yep, this is the perfect compromise.

Smell and taste are cedar needles, citrus zest, orange peel, sweet and toasty caramel malt, tangerine, and bitter hops. Grapefruit on the nose but not in the flavour. A bit woody as well. The alcohol is more prominent than I anticipated. Creamy and smooth mouthfeel, somewhat syrupy, great bite from the hops, sticky and dry finish is surprisingly balanced.

The taste up front is floral hops and malt with a noticeable carmel flavor. The sweetness of the malt is offset by the tangy citrus hop flavor. This is a well balanced easy to drink beer. The tanginess made me want to drink quicker than I knew I should. Each sip begging for another. The 9% ABV does not clobber your taste buds, but it will creep up on you.

Pours dark orange, nice fluffy white head. Turns into a thick ring around the edge of the glass. Ah, that great grapefruit/citrus smell I remember so well. Still tastes as great as I remember. Caramel, grapefruit, heavy perfumey sweetness, slight tropical fruit (pineapple), resin. Unfortunately a little alcohol bite turns into alot over time and kind of drags down the great taste, shame. Mouthfeel however otherwise is perfect, very smooth and oily, works great here. Drinkability suffers a bit because of the alcohol bite and heaviness. Not many double IPA's grab my attention (I've always preferred regular IPA's) but this one does. A classic.","Chico1985","Feb 09, 2010"

A lot of DIPA's are so highly hopped that they must be overly-compensated with malts, but this one clearly makes the hops the central focus of the beer. This is one hell of a bold and complex brew and one of the better IPA/DIPA's I've had. If you haven't had this brew, you should really get one the next time you go to the store.

Although the nose is mainly malty, there is a very subtle background of floral hops and vinous characteristics. The flavor is also very malty and sweet, even a little grainy with only hints of hops and an increasingly vinous taste as the drink finishes.

The taste starts with a lot of floral flavors, with the lemon and orange following, finishing with a very light bitterness.

I taste it, and while those same hops are certainly present, the caramel does a wonderful job of balancing out that hop attack for a very smooth and balanced taste that I wasn't expecting out of a DIPA.

The hop intensity is really substantial; bold enough to stand with such classics as Two Hearted, and quite reminiscent of that beer in particular. Despite the big hops, the malt manages to dominate the beer with huge, but never cloying, quantities of toast and brown sugar. The highlight of the beer is, appropriately enough, in the long, lingering aftertaste and takes the form of a sweet, orange-caramel hop note that coats the mouth but never become old or offensive. This is a really wonderful beer, and one that proves that east coast brewers can make 'em just as well as anyone in California.","nickfl","Dec 09, 2009"

As I said, I was expecting a hop monster, and found a beer that strikes an incredible balance-not only between hops and malt, but also accommodating the 9% with remarkable drinkability. Although this is a great beer, I'm reluctant to give full marks due to arguably a philosophical difference: I think Imperial IPAs should have a greater hop presence than this one does. I remember an editorial in BA Magazine not too long ago lamenting the fact that most extreme brewing was just hops hops hops and nothing else. This does, indeed, break the mold insofar as it has remarkable hop-malt balance and drinkability for an IIPA. Still, even with the balance it has, I want at least a shade or two more hops here.

Has a lot of coffee and bitter chocolate flavors on the finish. This is a very big beer, has a great flavor but drinkability is limited to just one bottle at a time for me. This had me feeling like I wanted a crisp summer ale afterwards, but no denying this is a very well made brew. Compared to the 60 min IPA, I think this comes across as more malty/sweet, as the 60 had a more obvious hop/bitter finish.","kpoole25","Sep 27, 2009"

Grapefruit and lemon are present as well. The flavor much smother then I expected. The hop kick is there but, the malt comes in and mellows everything out. It's piney and bitter fruit yet smooth like bourbon. Medium to full body little carbonation. Slight warming effect. I find this to be a perfect balance of hops and malt.

Unfortunately, this beer disappoints on all levels. This beer is light in color with a small yet firm head. The taste is of hops with a good portion of alcohol. All in all, I must say that I find this beer unbalanced. Here is the best way I can describe it: Take a Harpoon IPA and add more alcohol to it and you have a DFH90.

Mouthfeel is full with a interesting complexity of flavors like toast, peanuts, dates, lime, honey, coffee. Lingering bitterness. Finish is sweet flavor followed by a dry mouthfeel.

Aroma is hoppy with a base of candy-like sugary sweetnes.. taste is similar, the hop is there but the sweetness is so powerful that it may be hard for some people to get past, which could affect its drinkability.. Mouth is also a bit strong on the sweetness, this could either be one of its highlights for some or, again, a downside for others. And we aren't talking about sweet hop beers like Ruination or so, the sweetness here is quite prominent. All in all, if you get a chance to try it on tap, do so.

You almost feel like not putting the beer down once you take a sip. Bitter up front with a hybrid bitter/malty finish that takes you for a ride. Rings are full and last throughout the entire beer. Mouthfeel is exceptional and the drinkability is good, but at 9.0 ABV, you obviously can't drink 5 of them. This is definitely my favorite double IPA. Props to Dogfish Head","cpmau11","Jun 20, 2009"

Great on the palate: medium body, average carbonation, with a bitter finish. As for the flavor, this beer is more alive than most I've tried. Lightly sweet, quite bitter, but not at all overpowering, and while you can taste the alcohol, you wouldn't necessarily guess that it's a 9% ABV.

There's a touch of hoppy piney bite on the tongue but it is very subtle. Rather, the malty sweetness plays a big part in this beer. Very caramelly and warm.

Tasting it I first notice the sharp carbonation/hop bitterness combo. The finish is "sticky" I guess. Sweet pale malt and piney hop oil taste. It's a little bready as well and there's some warming alcohol in there. It's disasterously drinkable on tap for some reason. I don't recommend sessioning it.","drunkboxer1","Jun 11, 2009"

Hops on the nose, spicy and enticing. Sweet port-wine like malty taste gives way to spicy, earthy hop bitterness. Its piney and citrusy at the same time. Hops give way to definite medicinal alcohol taste. After all, this brew is 9% ABV. I'd almost forgotten. It's well hidden by the massive amount of hops and malt.","pmcgill10","Jun 10, 2009"

A veritable hop explosion in my mouth. Robust, clean, hoppy beer. cannot believe that it is 9% ABV, because the hops and malt are balanced out so well.

Then, as if threatened, the hops re-emerge, and play a floral symphony on your tounge, highlighted by grapefruit, apricot and raspberry.

4,-6.5,4,4,4,4,4,"I had this beer a few weeks ago on tap at Stone, but didn't really know what to expect after having the Bear Republic Apex. This beer has much more malt texture than CA style IPA/Imperial IPA's. To put my taste preference aside, this beer pours great, a darker beer, more like an amber ale color. The smell is somewhat sweet, hoppy, almost floral. The smell reminds me of the Hairy Eye Ball from Lagunitas. Taste is hoppy, but balanced with caramel maltiness, definately has a big malt finish. The carbonation is light, but fits the style. Overall, this is a good Imperial IPA, but if you are looking for West Coast style IPA be warned, the malts are pretty heavy.","rmaste6282","May 06, 2009"
4.17,-2.6,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"The smell is redolent of hops, but not intensely concentrated. It is a sophisticated and unusual blend of fruit (citrus, persimmon, white grapes) and fresh cut flowers. It is sweet on the palate (all that barley?), a little wood, pine, grapefruit, and spirit show up as you move the beer around your mouth. Finish seems dry on the sides of your tongue, with a mild astringency, yet the sweetness persists as well (caramel, malt). Delicious. Medium bodied with modest but sufficient carbonation. Alcohol level is just right. Clean yet flavorful, maybe a little sweet for the style; not as hop-forward as I was expecting...still, a superior brew.","augustgarage","May 06, 2009"

I feel that every sip is a powered by a different factor. Sometimes the malt is in the foreground and sometimes the Hops are powering threw. Which ever is first to the finish the flavor in secound balances lovely. This beers carbonation is perfect and is not heavy at all as you drink.

It has a golden orange hue with a thick dense white head. My nose picks up a huge presence of floral hops and maybe a sweet bready aroma as well. There's a thick, heavy, and syrupy sort of consistency but a great taste. It tastes like oily hops with much less pine and citrus than I usually associate imperial IPAs with. Quite bitter... As it should be and malty. There's a flavorful contrast of bitter and sweet going on. As I drink the beer down rings of foam are left behind. I think I feel some alcohol warmth in my throat now, also. Good beer... But I'm still trying to find one that will top Bell's Hopslam. I'll keep searching.","berserker256","Mar 27, 2009"

Vividly dark orange color with a soft brown tinge, pumpkin-like in an autumnal way, very good clarity. Hits you with a double-barrel blast of sweet pink grapefruit in the nose, followed by honey dappled scone, white pepper, granola, green tea notes, the florality a bit overmatched here, excellent staying power, amplified as it warms some. Full-bodied without getting fat or overly dense, pushes the palate to find the sweet spot where it can impress and still flow forward. There's a certain fluffiness to the carbonation, not crisp nor foamy. Sweet and juicy pink grapefruit, tangelo citrus dominates here too, the malts polish the palate while adding some cocoa powder and carob flavors. Pine resin, honey and near barley accents come next. The hops beyond the citrus not adding much flavor, just a textural drying effect through and past the mid-palate. Still, more floral here, particularly as residue.

In some ways it is now a bit more like a Barleywine but clearly different from that style.  One of the strengths of this beer is that after the bitterness of the hops has faded with age it is still a wonderful beer.

A very inviting mix of hop aroma with both floral and citrus coming through, though the floral seems to be more prevalent. The flavor is nice, malt is there though it does fade to a more hop / slight alcohol flavor. Could this be an old bottle, as I was expecting a larger hop hit? I did not see a date on the bottle so I am not sure. As the brew warms the alcohol seems to come out more but feels a little too hot for me. This is a good brew but for me it does not live up to the hype, the aroma was the best aspect IMO. I will try this one again just to make sure I did not get a slightly off brew.","Stimack","Jan 28, 2009"

The taste is deep and complex with a woody or burnt flavor that mixes with the hops and lingers for a long time. The hop flavor is altered as it seems to bring a good dose of bitterness, but not like I've ever head before. The label boasts of a long boil that had me ready for a big hop flavor. Instead I was more impressed by a more unique flavor.","MillySox","Jan 28, 2009"

Cloudy body that was a beautiful copper in color. Taste of mild hops and underlying malty character. Grapefruit, orange notes are present along with malts as it finishes over your palate. The longer it sits out and gets room temperature, the more present the malt character becomes. Overall an amazingly balanced IPA that can be enjoyed by everyone, hop heads and non hop heads alike.

3.35,-21.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Pours a pale straw yellow color with a bit of copper in it. A fluffy white head appears early, then kind of fades, leaving just a bit of bubbles on top. You also get a bit of lacing. The smell is a bit earthy and sweet. You can get the hop smell from the start, it leans towards piney, herbal, with a bit of citrus. But there is a distinct malty smell that is different from most DIPAs, interesting. The taste is enjoyable. I had it once and thought it was too sweet, but I had already been drinking other sweet things, maybe a problem, this one is distinctly hoppy, there's a bit of bitterness with some floral tastes. Then you get a bit of the nutty or biscuity maltiness, something a bit different, which is pleasant in the style, and there is sweetness of course, but it doesn't kill the hops. The alcohol is also well-masked. The mouthfeel is good, there's quite a bit of complexity, this isn't one-dimensional. But it's ultimately a little too syrupy for a DIPA in my opinion. I am a fan of a bit more dryness in this style. I figure that it could be appreciated by almost any age of beer drinker. I enjoyed having it, and would probably buy it again in the future, though I wouldn't want to drink a bunch of them at one time.

The taste jumps off the page, hitting with early with a rich of hops and finishing smooth with a malty finish. It hides it's high alcohol content well. The mouth feel is silky smooth and, yet, robust. As far as I'm concern, this may be the best beer on the market.","Fernans","Dec 11, 2008"

This beer is just a pleasure to drink. Update (06.28.08) - This beer is overpowering, in a good way. Having this after a token American light beer is a kick in the junk, to relate it to the average American male. It gets in your head, your stomach, and your taste buds.

A lot less pine smell the 60 minute, but still present. Carbonation is more delicate so that it's feels creamier in mouth. Bitterness is very well "blended", really not aggressive for a 90 IBUs beer.

The aroma was very aggressively hoppy, big notes of pine and citrus with some resin behind that. The flavors followed suit but were better balanced. Deep and complex hops with a pale malt backbone in the middle. The hops make the beer distinctly bitter but not much so though the finish was a little oily. The carbonation was spot-on, the body medium to full and the mouthfeel excellent.

The taste is very smooth - the hops commingle perfectly with the malt to keep this beer well balanced, especially given its high ABV. Finishes long, with great lingering bitterness from the hops. A bit of alcohol pokes through at this point to add depth and warmth. Good carbonation and a medium body add to the great drinkability of this brew. Glad to have finally tried my first Dogfish.

I could slightly feal the warmth of the alcohol as it went down. Overall I thought this beer was amazing.

Extremely smooth and very little alcohol noticed at all. A kind of malty sweetness to this ipa, which is unusual though quite pleasant.

Although, maybe its being a West Coaster, its a new hop smell to me. Not familiar but very nice smelling. Taste is good as well. Of course you taste the hops but it was a little more balanced that I expected. Hoppy with some sweet malt, and a bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel was pleasant and on the light side.

Slightly metallic. Taste is bitter, citric, hops with a lot of strong, sweet, biscuity malt and some spice. I appreciate that DFH tries to counter the hops with malt, but rather than coexisting to create a nice balance, 90 minute is simultaneously a hop-bomb and a malt-bomb. It's certainly very flavorful, but very disjointed and seriously unrefined. The malt at least gives it a thick feel. Too big to be very drinkable.","philipquarles","Sep 05, 2008"

The taste is very heavy on the sweet, molasses side, until the follow through on the finish, where the sides of my mouth perked up to the latent hop character in the balancing act that is this beer. I think the hops may have quieted down a fair bit in this bottle, which is over a year old, the majority of that time being in my fridge.

4.92,15,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Dogfish Head is a brewery that consistently produces a quality beer. Their 90 minute IPA is no exception. It's look is deep in color, as IPA's go, and as you swirl it the beer takes on a look not unlike many scottish ales. 90 minute IPA will hold a thick head at first pour which will recede to a thin lace as it warms. This beer is idealy drank in a stemmed glass will a large bulb and a tight rim. This is so the amazing fruity nose can build; this happens to be this beer's most striking characteric. The aroma does not end with the first whiff. As you drink this beer you will go from liking it to loving it. Usually breweries tend to try to hard when producing an IPA and get it wrong with either too much hop bite or too little alcohol. Dogfish head's 90 minute IPA is probably the best balance between hop, malt, and alcohol of any beer I have had the pleasure of enjoying. I recommend cooling this beer to around 55 degrees and drinking it slowly so that you will give it time to warm. As it warms you will find a "sweet spot" where all the flavors blend. I estimate this around 61 degrees. Enjoy!","PerzentRizen","Jul 30, 2008"
4.52,5.6,4,4.5,5,4,4,"WOW, this is one amazing brew! Sampled a 12 ounce bottle which I poured into a merlot glass. The aroma was an intense mixture of hops, sweet malts, and more hops. The bitterness of the aroma lead me to believe that this beer may be too much for me. In the glass this beer is a wonderful amber color with ample head and very nice lacing. Once I took my first taste I was immediately blown away by the flavor of this beer. The hops were not overpowering like I had expected, in fact they hit you at first but mellow out to give way to some nice malt flavors. This beer is extremely high in alcohol content but you wouldn't know by the flavor which hides it well. I could definitely see myself enjoying a few of these and then sliding back into my comfy chair with a very nice mellow buzz.","kinger","Jul 30, 2008"

A lot of hops, but not very bitter. The only taste I could home in was hops, but it was excellent in flavor. Mouthfeel was good, almost thick enough to chew.

It really is superbly balanced between hops and malt for a double IPA. It's got a good resiny hop feel in the mouth, but a good malt backbone that isn't too syrupy.

Appears golden orange in color, with a wispy head and lots of lacing on the glass. The smell was a bit tingly on the nose, and the hops are definitely present. Now, as someone who does not consider myself a hop head, I was interested to see what I thought of this beer. I have not had one of these in years, and I thought it was time to revisit it. I guess my palate has changed, because it was really good. Yes, it was hoppy, but it wasn't overpowering like other hop bombs I've tried. This one was very smooth and mellow, allowing me to enjoy every sip as I slowly savored it. I think it got even more drinkable as it warmed to room temp. I still can't believe that this is a double/imperial IPA with 9% abv. DFH has really made an enjoyable hoppy beer for us all.

Smells of sweet and smooth citrus' with the hops blended in the background among some sweet malts and an earthy and grassy essence floating around as well. The palate is filled with zesty oranges, lemons, spices, grapefruit, dry hops, some underlying breadiness, phenols and a good hit of alcohol which ends the event perfectly. Really good carbonation keeps things interesting and the mouthfeel is pretty smooth, albeit a bit of chalkiness exists. I would describe it as light to medium bodied.

Let me begin by admitting a personal biased FOR DFH 90 as it was my 'gateway' drug into craft beers. And I thank it every day for its enlightening effects. This bad little brew was my first imperial IPA and I haven't looked back since. Well, now that all the meaningless back-story is out of the way, how does it stack up after all these years of pleasurable quaffing? Pours a brillant light amber with a stout, dense little collar. It has such a distinctive smell; not overwhelmingly hop-driven, it seems to revolve around toasted, spicy aromas with an under-lying richness. Smells like DFH. In the mouth the smells are given new life with luxurious notes of deep malt, honey accents, resins in perfect harmony and a deliciously restrained bitterness. Very full bodied and full flavored. Once again exhibiting a tell-tale DFH 'house' aspect. Certainly not a bad thing, but it has a signature profile. Yup.

Hops, wheat, honey, and sweet sugar was detected in the smell. The taste was hoppy. You could get the hops right away, but I caught the wheat/grain, and a little bit of citrus in there as well. The mouthfeel was crisp and I found this beer to be a slow beer to drink because of the mighty hops.","ROMER79","May 07, 2008"

The aromas were incredibly vocal smells of florals, sharp citrus, malt and hops. Initially bitter taste leads to a somewhat sweet aftertaste that really takes advantage of earthy flavors. This beer was a bit heavy for me (especially after a Kolsch) due to its heavy carbonation and tons of hops in it. However, it was typical for an imperial IPA.

Aroma is piny as well as fruity (think tropical fruits). Taste starts with piny hops and then mellows into tropical fruits and a bit of a floral note. There is a also a little sweet, caramel-like malt, in the aftertaste. This beer is well-carbonated and has a medium body. I usually have trouble drinking a lot of DIPAs, but this is incredibly easy to down. Overall this beer is complex, tasty, and highly drinkable.

Being a fan of the 60 min., I expected a lot from this beer. Where the 60 min. is in your face w/ hops, this beer seems more tamed and drinkable due to the added malt. A complex beer with hints of citric acid (grapefruit?). Leaves a hoppy aftertaste w/ lingering hints of malt.

A dense, red tinted brown was in my glass, covered by three-finger head that slowly dissipated and left a complete ring of laces as I drank down the cup. A very hoppy smell does pertrude, of course, but there seemes to be a little hint of sweetness, like caramel or honey or some fruitiness (I can't think of a distinct one though). Also some malt in the smell, and there is bread/coffee malt, or something of that kin, in this beer. There is of course a spiciness to this beer because there is an incredible amount of hops. Unlike some heavy duty IPA's, though, this retains a fullish body that is smooth and flavorful (a little citric) with a dry but not overdone backbite. I am not a big hophead, but if I were I could probably identify the numerous hops they must've put in this brew. Very balanced, and the 9% ABV is hidden well. A great beer whose sessionability is only limited by price and high ABV. A must have for any beer drinker to try, not just IPA fans.","clayrock81","Apr 19, 2008"

There is certainly some citrus flavor in here, but not the blow out ruination type of feel. The malt presence is very impressive, a nice unique sweetness is quite satisfying.

Not to thick, very drinkable for an IPA. I'd say the only mark against it, in my opinion is the alcohol level in the smell and taste. One of the best beers I have ever had. Wish it was available here in Kansas or Missouri.","EighchBrews","Mar 18, 2008"

Nose is fantastic, crazy hops and tons of sweet caramel. Taste is excellent; it's basically a perfect DIPA, with strong hops and malt, and absolutely delicious balance. Sweeter than the Hopslam (which is another of my favorite DIPAs), but it still works. Lots of grapefruit and citrus. Body is thick and full and nearly syrupy.

When you take your first sip of this beer, you feel the contrast on your palate, and it feels GOOD! Don't let the OG or ABV fool you; you'll get very little alcohol burn from this.

Rich. Greatness. Dogfish is known for it's exceptional devotion to quality and taste and this brew fits their commitment to a T.

4.67,9.1,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5," 90 minute IPA is one of Dogfish's year round beers, and what a beer it is. A deep golden amber pour, with a bright white head and loads and loads of citrusy and floral hops. In fact that's how the beer earned its timely moniker. Most beer is brewed with two or three hop additions; one at the beginning of the boil for bitterness, and a few more additions later on in the cooking process for flavor and aroma. 90 minute uses a Dogfish pioneered technique of adding small amouts of hops continuously through the entire 90 minute boil time. This unorthodox invention reduces the face-puckering bite some IPA's have, but adds an enormous hop presence. Dogfish uses this technique on all of their "minute" beers 60, 90, and 120, and with all the beers as the time increases so do the hops, alcohol and price tags. Just like people, some beers can't help but be personalities, and 90 minute is a rock star.","manleyphoto","Feb 14, 2008"

There is a bit of a head and it surprisingly hangs around. I was expecting more of your typical barleywine experience and have the head dissipate entirely. Not so here. The smell is excellent, beautiful hoppy esters, pine, grassyness, and some sweet malts in the background. The taste is also very nice. There is a very nice balanced hoppy bite balanced by some peach type sweet malts, some florals, and just a candied sugar base. I knocked this down a little bit on the mouthfeel because there is a bit of a throaty aftertaste and some lingering bitterness that may be a bit much.

That was less than a year ago, so it's probably more me than the beer that's changed. While I still found an unpleasant fullness in the middle, my overall impression is H-O-P-S.

The head is a creamy off-white with good retention. The flavor is quite complex with a nice fruity bitter finish. There is an echo of a stronger type of alcohol in their, but I cannot place it.

Content is almost immediately noticeable. Not sure if 9% is good for me but will find out when I finish my fourth. All in all ... the best beer I have had in a while.","timericka","Jan 10, 2008"

Quite lovely to look at. The smell is interesting; you definitely get the citrus scent but then there's also a whiff of something floral. The taste is nice- it's somehow bitter and tart-fruity, but sweet at the same time. A little bit of that citrus smell comes in as a final bite at the end, which was actually very nice. Fairly carbonated without being too fizzy. The mouthfeel was just alright, nothing to complain about but not particulary wonderful either, smooth but strangely oily (as someone else said earlier).

Big bodied, thick, almost oily (not in a bad way), coats the tongue. MMmm. Lingering aftertaste. Warms you up as you drink it due to the 9% ABV.

3.71,-13.3,5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer looks perfect. Nice, clear reddish amber with a long-lived, thick, off-white, frothy head that leaves nice lace rings throughout the tasting. Loads of tiny bubbles moving up through the body also add to the appearance. The smell is good with big hops up front - I get citrus and slight floral and herbal. The taste is strongly bitter in the initial flavor with a good strong, slightly sweet malt base to keep the balance. The IF transitions quickly to a bitter, slightly medicinal alcoholic aftertaste that isn't terribly, but I don't think this deserves the exceptionally high marks that this beer typically gets. Again, the mouthfeel is somewhere between average and good for an 2ipa. It is medium to full bodied with a syruppy texture and lively carbonation and a heavy alcoholic finish that sort of coats your tongue. Not unpleasant, but I have definitely had better.

The nose is packed full of hop aroma settling into citrus and pine scent with the malt scent trying to make it through all of that hop scent. Bitter at first, but the malt quickly comes into play balancing out that bitterness. The sweet caramel finish on this is my favorite aspect of the beer. It is just very well balanced and not a tongue/taste bud grenade that will make everything taste like pine cones for the next few hours. Each drink the flavors of those hops keep coming though. Citrus, pine, and grapefruit meld so well with the sweet sticky caramel finish. The mouthfeel as I stated is very sticky and the beer coats your entire mouth very well, and is still so crisp and actually extremely refreshing.

4.3,0.5,4,4,4.5,5,4,"Pours a rich deep amber gold color with radient highlights when held to the light. A dense white head rises up and leaves a streaking of fine lace in the inner rim of the glassware. The nose is nearly all of hops, as one might guess, but accentuated by sweet malt as well. The label states that this Imperial IPA features "a single, constant 90-minute hop addition," Hence the name, and "a ridiculous amount of English Two-row Barley." This impressive enough, but add to this the fact that this beer is dry hopped in the tanks as well and you clearly have a special beer on your hands. The fresh alpha acids and resins from the hops are evident here, and the nose is blossoming with fresh hoppy goodness. The palate is fresh, herbal, and slightly floral. The hop presence is formidable, of course. Resinous and biting - this beer stops short of being harsh due to the strong malt backbone. The hps remain asservive throughout. I find this beer to be surprisingly balanced - not the absolute hop-bomb you might expect from a beer with, what, 90 IBUs? Mouth feel is thick, juicy and coating. The pronounced hop resins, along with the smooth, nearly cloying malts, make this beer seem almost slippery. Both the sweetness and the hop bitterness linger a long tme on the tongue. Slightly biting from the 9% ABV, but not overly alcoholic in the mouth. In terms of drinkability, this is where the DFH 90-Minute really shines in my view. The incredibly well-crafted Imperial IPA is a joy to consume and not a struggle like some overly-hopped, under-balanced examples can be. This is truly an IPA to be reckoned with. Without a doubt, this is one of the finest, most brilliantly crafted IPAs i've ever had the pleasure to drink. It's strong, yes, but never clumbsy or over-wrought. A true masterpiece in the "Imperial" beer category. I love Dogfish Head beers and the 90-Minute is precisely why. Truly excellent.","beerphilosopher","Oct 25, 2007"

I'm not sure what types of hops they use, and I'm sure it's a mix, but whatever it is, it's perfectly balanced; a good amount of kick but not overpoweringly so. The taste is much like the smell, with some extra bite in the mouth from the hops. The bitter hop flavor persists throughout the taste but goes through varying levels of intensity; an interesting ride. The aftertaste is smooth yet complex, nippy yet comforting.

The taste starts out with the malt coming right out, and then blending itself to a strong citrus flavor, hints of a grassy flavor as well. A very well balanced flavor. A medium bodied feel, that never loses that texture all the way across the palate.

The taste is just like the aroma, consisting of hops, followed by some dark fruit flavors, caramel, and finishing with a light noticeable alcohol presence. Very rich and complex. The mouthfeel is very thick and smooth. If it were'nt for the high abv., this would be a great sessionable ale due to its extremely delicious flavor. Overall, I was very impressed with this brew.

Taste is definately of coffee with a touch of caramel and a slight citrus hop backing that doesn't last like I expected. Taste resorts back to malt and doesn't leave a bitter after thought I was hoping. Mouthfeel is where this one doesn't quite do it for me. Thick syrup-like mouthfeel that doesn't make this one the easiest drinker. As it warms, the alcohol taste really starts to break through. Drink this one nice and cold, don't let it sit around too much, and you'll really enjoy this DIPA.","DrinkinBuddy","Aug 07, 2007"

At the end, it finishes by letting you know this is a 9% abv brew, and then it's clean. Because of the high alcohol content and the heavy hops, this isn't my idea of a session beer, but it's a great companion to a good meal or to enjoy by itself.

An enviable balance is acheived in the flavor, and though there are no surprises that deviate from what's suggested by the nose, it's wonderful. The mouthfeel isn't luxurious, it's luxury itself, with a deeply satisfng warm finish. All this, and it manages to be incredibly refreshing.

This is a beer you can smell even when it is just sitting on the table in front of you, a lot of citrus hops come through in the nose. The taste mimics the smell mouth puckering bitterness from the citrus hops but the beer is sweet enough that the bitterness doesn't overwhelm. Also the alcohol is very well hidden by the sharp bitterness I had to remind myself that this was a 9% beer to keep from drinking it too fast.

Malt nose is also intense with a scotch ale-like(wee heavy), fresh wort aroma. Flavor is powerful and complex. Give the glass a swirl and allow it to warm and the various flavors include: fresh malty wort, golden raisins, dried apricot, canned peach, caramel, sweet roll, sweet sticky citrus candy, fresh hop oil, pine, mint, alcohol phenols and various fruity esters and overtones. Wow, this is an IPA? Has more of an old ale or barlywine-like complexity. Or more like a belgian ale made with domestic yeast. I have sampled different stages of age and on-tap and this beer always tastes great. The 9%abv is most likely the reason it travels and ages so well. Would pair perfectly with an apricot glazed meat or fish dish. The hops and alcohol would cut through the sweetness while also matching the flavors.","mshallah","Jul 12, 2007"

Bitter citrus, herbal and fruity hop aroma. The taste is a biter punch of hops, more citrus, grapefruity and slightly piney. The sweetness of the malt balances it well, however. Although hops are certainly the feature, sweet pale malt flavor really does a good job of making this one very drinkable.

A nice mellow grapefruit flavor, some resin and pine hints. No fresh grassy hop flavors. The hops are followed by a creamy caramel type flavor, which mellows out the hops and makes this very drinkable, though a bit on the sweet side. The feel is moderate and creamy, not overly carbonated. I am a bit torn on the drinkability.

A raisin like sweetness hits the tongue first followed by a very subdued hop bitterness - I'm guessing the 18 months or so of aging has mellowed this brew.

Taste was incredibly smooth for the amount of hops and alcohol. I have heard people say this beer was too sweet, and I thought it was a little overrated the first time i had it on tap at the Stone 10th fest. But after a long day of work and class, a clean palate, and a hunger for a hoppy delight, this hit the spot perfectly.

Good use of some sweet citrus and floral flavors make this one chewy. Huge hops as well. The mouthfeel is nice and balanced and the bite goes away from the alcohol that I could taste initially. I could probably drink a couple of these max but even still this beer was better after another tasting. I'd love to find this on-tap, hopefully soon. I'm sure that would bring the taste up a mark.

The flavor balances it out rather nicely. The malt flavor comes through with a caramel hint and and a sort of pineapple alcohol blend.

It pours out with a reddish-brownish-golden color, a nice foamy bubbling head. It smells just so complex - fruits and flowers and bitter hops and sweet hops, all rolled into one. The taste is just as complex as the smell - it starts out with the taste of hops but then complexes and you get the other tones as you swallow slowly and let it savor. The aftertaste isn't bitter or pungent or anything that you can find with IPAs. Fabulous.

Not nearly as intense as most DIPAs I've had, but it shows promise. The taste is immediately hoppy in a nutty, rich, grassy sort of combination, which then combines almost immediately with the strong, caramel-candied malt backbone. Alcohol is absent, unless the sips are too large or too close together. Very well balanced. The body is very thick, but with moderate carbonation.

The aroma consisted of a floral, hoppy smell with a hint of banana, maybe, but nothing real significant that stood out to me. The first taste was great - a rich, caramel taste that morphed into a pleasantly bitter finish, with enough punch but no where close to being overpowering. I really didn't notice the 9% alcohol while drinking it (although I did a little later). It was very well-balanced, had a good aftertaste, and overall was very delicious.

I can't remember when I bought this 4-pack; it's not entirely impossible that this bottle was from a 2004 batch. Regardless, it's definitely been aged at least a year, possibly two, and I think that aging helped to mellow the hops and make for a more balanced DIPA. . . . I've had this on tap in the past, and my recollection is that it was hoppier off the keg, doubly so off of Randall the Enamel Animal when I got it at the Blind Tiger a few years back. I'd like to buy a current vintage and drink it right away to see if the hops would be more pronounced in both the nose and the taste.","Kendo","Oct 29, 2006"

4.37,2.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Purchased at local liquor store and poured into tulip glass. The head is creamy off white not fluffy, but creamy. It dissipates at a decent pace and leaves thin lacing. The body is a toasty, orange, amber, red. Smells of subtle malt sweetness balanced with hop aromatics. The piney aromatics of the hops are the showcase in this beer, but they in no way are sharp or aggressive. If any thing they sit much further back than the hoppy aggressiveness of most double IPAs. The hops smell of mild pine, grass, some grapefruit and, citrus. There are also some sweet fruity ester qualities manifested from the malt, which to me seems not so common in Double IPA, not that its not pleasing. There also seems to be some coffee and raison in there, possibly from the use of toasted malt. The flavor is much the same, there is some bitterness from hops, but nothing that is really going to knock your socks off like some IPA. The bitterness is well balanced with esters of sweet malt. There are variations in this beer that most IPA or imperial IPAs dont have. This is a very tolerable IPA easy to drink. If you want an IPA that will kick the shit out of you with bitterness (in that good way) this is not the IPA for you, but this is totally a drinkable double IPA to have around, especially in contrast to something as wonderfully hoppy as Dreadnought. This is damn tasty, easy going double IPA if you like your hops wild, its not quite that, but its damn tasty all the same.","mmcave","Oct 27, 2006"

A bitter finish but not overly so due to some nice balancing from the malts. Smooth. Mouthfeel is slick with a medium body. A little carbonation lightens it up a bit. The drinkability is better than I expected. The first time I had one, I thought it was a bit overpowering. When I had one a week later, it went down much easier.

The mouthfeel is medium/full bodied, slick and creamy. You can notice the alcohol in this beer, but it's not overpowering. Drinkability is very good, it's smooth even with the high ABV.

Taste is nice resiny hops, followed by a strong burst of caramel malts that drown out the bitterness a bit which is great. Wow thats good. Mouthfeel starts thick and ends dry, which I am enjoying, makes me want more. Drinkability is high, this is a great beer and could be enjoyed as a treat or as a session.

Taste is bitter yet sweet, but not overdone as with other IPAs that I've tried. Flavors are well balanced between malt and hops. Mouthfeel is at first thick and syrupy, but leaving a dry, crisp finish on the palate. Although visual carbonation appears low, the beer is actually well cabronated.

I was fully bracing myself for an over the top hop blast straight to the face but what I got was something unexpected. There was a nice hop bitter punch right in the beginning, but then it just mellows out with a malty smoothness that is unreal. Tha balance is incredible for a 9% IPA. Sweetness is definitely present, almost too much at some points, and a touch of alcohol lingers in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is one of a kind, smooth, chewy, sticky....very nice.

The whole glass is coated except for the part im drinking from. very nice. Smells piney and sweet. Lots of grapefruit, sweet caramel, maybe some raisins. You get candy sweetness from the malts upfront. It continues through the middle and ends bitter with a semi sweet citrus hop aftertaste. Not very complex but very well balanced and flavorful. Borderline full bodied. This one seems a little syrupy. Carbonation is good though. Could stand to be a bit lighter in body.

The taste is very enjoyable and well-balanced between the hops and barley, tasting very similar to a good barley wine. Bittersweet perfection.

This reminds me of a barleywine - a style that I generally have not taken well to as they tend to be too sweet for my tastes. The DFH 90 does not have the fullness of flavour and aroma and hops that I enjoyed in the DFH 60.

There is a slight breadiness from the malts and the hop bitterness is soft. Gets a somewhat medicinal character from the alcohol. Hops don't seem to be enough to balance the sweet.

But this is NOT what I have come to expect from an IPA or especially an imperial IPA. Usually I feel like they are just trying to show their hop muscle, and nothing else. This has a different hop character that is still serious, but smoother and much, much more drinkable than ANY IPA I have ever experienced. The finish is long and beautiful and really shows off the extra barley character of this brew. As a person who avoids IPA's but does drink them and appreciate them, I am very much enjoing this brew and still respecting it for not compromising the hop-forward character that I feel is essential to the IPA style. Maybe it's the "ridiculous amounts of barley" that make it this classic, quality beer with a fantastic, long finish. I'm drinking an IPA that's far from insipid and in no way hop-shy, but still a quality, balanced brew that normal people like me can drink and enjoy.","andythejerk","Jun 19, 2006"

A light golden honey color gives way to a almost perfectly white head. The retention is decent but he lacing is phenomenal. The taste out-of-this-world.

Mouthfeel is slick and creamy feeling backed by a moderate amount of carbonation. I'm a bit surprised by this brew as it doesn't match any others of this style. It's not overly citrusy, bitter, or sweet. It's closer to a Belgian style for me than a DIPA. Overall, however, I'm happy with the one bottle I got.

I don't know if this is really true to the double IPA style, because it has a balance that most of the double IPAs don't have. Instead of having hops to "rip your tongue out" it has hops that finish well and balance off the thick malty opening on this beer.

An otherwise (average, but attractive) golden appearence. Aroma seems a little restrained, or compared to expectations anyhow. A unique blend of hops in this beer. I struggle to confidently detect one single kind. Mouthfeel is medium-low carbonated which suits the beer quite well. Not one swig is empty, flavour consistent in each and at the varying temperatures. While there is no alcohol 'burn', no alcohol taste in any form really, mouthfeel still acompanied with a warming sensation. You can feel the warming sensation (I must stress, no alcohol taste) in the sides of the mouth. Hops are rather restrained in the flavour, a big malty back bone sees to it. Some crisp bitterness right before swallowing. Flavour is above anything else cistruisy. Some grapefuity notes, but overall I seem to taste tangerine. As it warms flavour improves.

The taste is quite bitter with fruity, piney hops, moving from the front of the palate to the back.

Taste - just as promised by aroma - pine and alchohol and, most unfortuantely diacetyl. The various elements just did not integrate. Diacetyl makes it way too sweet, and the alcohol goes down like cheap vodka. Mouthfeel - full, moderate carbonation, alcohol burn, decent coating from hop oil.

Flavors were laced with thick citrus and pine notes, drenched with hops and a mild burn of alcohol. Nice. This is a hop heads dream come true. Mouthfeel was nice and oily, just the way a good DIPA should be. Very slick, and slightly thick. Drinkability is good. I wouldn't have more than one at a time, but this is a solid beer.

Aroma is of a strong, pungent citrissy hop with an enticing underlying sweetness. For flavor the strong, fresh citrissy hop flavors are first noticed and pack quite a wallop, but the delicious underlying malt flavors are what makes this an exemplorary beer. Bitterness is high, but not as bracing as expected. Anyway, 90 Minute is one of the best beers that I've sampled in a while, there's just so much juicy hop flavor to enjoy here and an excellent malt base. Complexity is high and the flavors have many interesting nuances. Very highly recommended.","Gagnonsux","Mar 31, 2006"

Taste blows me away. Hops are noticed first, then a sweet malt flavor follows, alcohol bites just a bit at the finish. Light carbonation with a medium-thick mouthfeel. Much more balanced then what I was expecting. Between the Dogfish IPA's, this one gets my vote as the best, mainly because of it's balance.","jockstrappy","Mar 30, 2006"

Then I noticed the nice American IPA hop bill sliding in nice and gently, until it demonstrates its every bit the match of the oversized malt profile. Total impression is of a hoppy young barleywine. I hadnt realized this was an Imperial IPA. Ill have to see if I can celler my remaining bottles.

However, clinches down with a very nice grapefuit and citrus hop bite. The carbonation was just right and finished dry, but left a refreshing fruity aftertaste.

Just the right amount of hops at the end. The mouthfeel was kind of hoppy and I also noticed this slight alcohol aftertaste as well. Just what I would expect from a 9%ABV IPA. Drinkability? I wouldn't mind another one. A 4-pack could go a long ways for me.","AltBock","Feb 09, 2006"

The smell is citrusy, oily hops that don't dominate like I would have expected them to. There are hints of grain bread in the background. Taste is mild hops that hit first with a weird white bread flavor malt afterwards that finishes with a hint of piney hops. This is not nearly as hoppy as most IPAs I've had recently.

A bit fruity but combined well with the hops. As soon as I drank it, the beer bounced around. Going down, it left a strong but sweet flavor.

This time though, something was amiss. Poured a perfect amber with a thick head that took a few minutes to settle. Smell was citrusy and very hoppy as well with lots of floral aromas and somewhat spicy towards the end. Tatse was definetly good but nothing in comparison to the other times I've tried this beer. For one, the malty sweetness that initially made me adore this beer was nearly gone. The hop presence was heightened a bit, but even so, it seemed a bit flat. It started off very earthy and tasty and then just seemed to fall flat on its face with no lingering flavors to speak of. Mouthfeel was medium/light (very uncharacteristic for this beer) making it easy to drink. I don't know if this is a new or just plain old crappy batch, but frankly im missing the old 90 minute. To be honest, it tasted more like the 60 minute then the 90. I'll grab it again, but im praying that it wont be like the batch im drinking now and will be like my good ol' friend 90.

There was no discernable date on the bottle though, so I'll just have to assume it's fresh. It begins by pouring a golden ruby color with a very small white head that leaves an oily film behind. It has a very strange aroma, one I haven't come across yet in a beer. It's all malt with an accompanying sweetness, but there's a tang that hits at the conclusion. The taste is a large sticky sweetness due to an overwhelming malt base. There is a fruitiness that contributes to the sweetness. It finishes with a burst of alcohol and a cough syrup element that isn't very appealing. As I mentioned earlier, I can't picuk up any hops, no flavor, no bitterness, nothing. It has a very English barleywine-ish taste with the sticky sweet fruitiness and high alcohol. It's light on carbonation and a bit cloying.

Knowing this was a 9% ABV, I was worried that it would be unbalanced but the taste was pleasant with a subtle sweetness with strong hop notes. Malt notes held up to the bitterness.

The taste reveals a certain even-handedness of gigantic malts and orange/grapefruit hoppiness, but there's something missing. I think it's that there's no "middle" flavor, specifically the rounded peach fruitiness that can really pull everything together in such a big IPA. This isn't a bitter hop monster a la Ruination, but the citric flavor is still there. Even so, there's a thick crystal malt sweetness that just becomes more cloying as the bottle progresses. Medium thick body, slick alcoholic and syrupy mouthfeel. I used to think this was amazing, and I'm not sure whether it's the beer or my palate that has changed. In any case, I can think of a few other DIPAs that I'd rather be drinking. Not bad, but certainly far from astounding.","orfeu","Dec 24, 2005"

I can smell a sugary sweetness with plenty of hops. The flavor is a nice balance- a decent amount of sweet brown sugary malt, with a nice grassy bitterness to follow it up. After a few drinks the bitter comes on even stronger and lingers for quite awhile. It's got a smooth, medium body with adequate carbonation.

The aromas of american hops are strong; citrus and grass with sweet malt and some fusels becoming more apparent as the head settles to a thin cap. Apple and orange esters visciously smacks your tastebuds first, then mellows out to a soft dark wheat flavor. Grassy hops then dominate the semi-dry aftertaste but never balance out the taste which is more overwhelmingly sweet than pleasently bitter. The body is medium and the tiny rushing carbonation tries to smooth the mouthfeel but the finish is almost more residual sweet than dry and bitter.

This ale is a masterpiece - a ludicrous amount of hops is perfectly balanced by tons of barley malt, making for a exquisitely tasty IPA. Not too bitter, but bitter enough to be just perfect.

"One of the most pleasing things that has ever caressed my tongue" doesn't really convey it. A smooth, creamy, slightly buttery body holds a huge hop presence up front, redolent with lupulin.

The flavor begins with a nice juicy hops profile with big citrusy grapefruit, slightly floral and mineraly, piney, and herbal flavors, followed by sweet caramel and lightly bready malt character to balance. The finish is drying and fairly bitter, but less so than your typical DIPA which makes it all the more drinkable. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with a big body and the drinkability is pretty good ( i can only think of one other DIPA more drinkable...thank you Stoudt's), alcohol is noticeable but not intrusive and this is one of the few DIPA's I could drink more than one of in a session...very nice beer by DFH","silver0rlead","Sep 02, 2005"

Bottle obtained from a local liquor store and consumed a couple evenings later. Pours thick and silent. Not a sound. Almost no head forms, just a ring around the inside of the glass. The beer itself is a nearly clear rust-orange. Smells mild compared to what I expected. Malty sweet with some citrusy hops and fruity esters (pumpkin, apricot, peach). Some pine aroma upon later sniffs. Tastes really malty smooth with noticable hop orange and some grapefruit pith flavor. An alcohol sting hides behind hop clouds, partly successful because fruity esters tease my tastebuds as a distraction. Nectarine and apricot ride both a volatile aromatic and a clingy oil. Hop bitter comes across as low, as does co-ho hop roughness, but the beer is thick and sugary sweet...I think these hop characteristics have simply been kept in check by equally bold malt. Thick and smooth moutfeel and mildly carbonated. This beer is wonderful.","mentor","Aug 01, 2005"

There is some citrus in there but mostly bitingly bitter herbal hop flavors. The malt is rich and sweet, molasses, burnt caramel and such.

As I tasted this beer I let the beer sit on my palate and so many delicious flavors came to mind, a smoothe, malty, hoppy finish. The taste is carmalized fruits, grape, peaches, caramel, and kick of hops. You can't even taste the 9% abv.

The same grassy, slightly spicey, slightly floral hops that make up part of the aroma permeate the entire duration of the flavor profile. Toasty malt syrup melded with floral hops? Perhaps a bit of tannic harshness in the very back, barely perceptible - I guess that's what you get from such a long hop boil. Interesting... Overall, very low hop bitterness for a DIPA, and actually low hop flavor and aroma too, but the flavor and aroma are so expertly intertwined with the malt flavors that I can't deny that this is an excellent beer. It's just one that is so different from the standard DIPA that I've grown used to.","Crotor","Jun 24, 2005"

There is balance as well, and before the hop finish, the two-row malt asserts itself, making for a balanced brew.

Pours an amber/orange that is perfectly clear with very active carbonation and is topped with an off-white 1 finger head that leaves nice patches of lace. Strong tropical aroma - oranges, grapefruit, and pineapple, along with biscuits and piney/leafy/herbal hops (I can almost smell the bitterness). By the end of the beer there are notes of caramel and bananas. The first sip shows a sweetness up front followed by a barrage of hops. Well balanced - doesn't seem like 90 IBUs. The flavors are the same as the aroma - even the caramel and banana finish. It is full bodied and the flavors linger on the palate forever (I'm having pine and grapefruit burps). The mouthfeel is smooth at the beginning and keeps improving from there. It warms your chest and will numb your mouth if you swish it around long enough.

It's very bitter and hoppy, which is good, but there's a strange aftertaste that reminds me of corn chips. A shame because I love looking at it and smelling it.

This flavor is simply unapproachable by the attempts of less fortunate brews and far surpasses the abilities of even the most worthy of opponents. Even the belches are edible and delightful. I could drink myself into a coma and be lain at the doorstep of death on this stuff; only to wake up and pour out another. This one belongs right next to another favorite of mine and shall henceforth be revered as a truly great piece of work.

There are hints of pine in the nose as well. The taste is damn bold. Starts off smooth (the malt only makes its presence known for a short while) then quickly is overtaken by hop boldness. The hops come in with some citrous then turn sharp and piney. No malts are detected after the initial smoothness. Some fruity flavors crop up to add to the complexity. The mouthfeel is big and sharp. The hops really throw your taste buds for a loop. The hop oil stays with you in a bitter citrous aftertaste. The alcohol presence is somewhat pronounced in the finish, warming your mouth and other parts of your digestive system.

Is it as great as the fuss makes it out to be? I myself am not one to listen to hype, as it tends to set people up for disapointment.

Lots of hop bitterness in the finish; I was still puckering a minute after my last drink! The mouthfeel is a little on the syrupy side of medium, but it feels nice on the way down before giving way to the piney hops.

The nose is great, rich and sweet with pale malt, I believe the continual hopping process adds a "completeness" to the hops in the aroma. General bitter aromas, sweet apricot, citrus and rind, pine aromas....they're all here. When I drink the malts are sticky and sweet up front, dense bitterness quickly greets my palate as well. The apricot/tangerine flavors of the hops combined with the sweetness of the malt creates an almost candy-like experience. Again, I think the continual hopping process creates a nice complexity and completeness to the hop flavors as well as the aromas I noted earlier. I'm suprised more people have not experimented with the continual hopping process. Mouthfeel is perfect; gliding smoothly down, with enough gumption to make a solid impression. The finish is mildly dry with a teeny-tiny spicy peep of alcohol. A great balanced DIPA that hits you with a nice solid representation of all it's composing elements.

It carries the weight of the style better than most especially in a wide glass (and the hops are the winner here). Great hops nose and actually clings to the glass way lighter than it actually is. Smells like some belgians but has the great american hops kick. The carbonation is just right for me but a may be a bit much for the style if you want to be picky.

Theres citrusy, earthy, woody, piney and floral hop notes in the nose. A competent malt backbone is also very evident. The taste begins with a smack of hoppy bitterness which quickly turns resiny and herbal and then citrusy in the middle. Malt flavors also become prominent in the middle. In the finish the whole mass of hops becomes incredibly citrusy - like grapefruit rinds and mix with the bready malt flavors very well. The aftertaste is very bitter and complex, with all the different hop flavors lingering. The mouthfeel is resiny from hops and very thick.

Notes of fruit try to crack through and do, a little bit. The bitterness is big and citrusy overall. Finish stays resiny, and bitter and dry for quite a while, with some lingering sugary/fruity malt.

Mouthfeel is not bad maybe a little light for a 9% brew but not bad. Drinakability is good these go down smooth and easy and at 9% could lead to trouble, but taste wise is more like a good IPA. I don't know if I am being over critical of this beer because I was expecting so much more? I have been wanting to try this one for a while and now I am disappointed it is not a bad beer but it is not the kick ass beer like I was expecting.

Gloopy, substantial head leaves webby lacework that sticks somewhat nicely. A few streamers idle through this liquid of above-average viscosity. Big hop aroma is dusty and pollen-like, but can't completely hide a firm, sweet, almost porridge-like malt body. The hop smell here is a double-edged sword for me--I like the suggestions of straw bales and cedar chips; I don't care to be reminded of the smell of "green dragon" (a vile stoner concoction involving marijuana soaked in hot vodka). Flavor begins with a bran muffin and marmalade-like sweetness at the tip of the tongue. Calling the hop flavor "bitter" is not quite accurate. It's more like a brute spiciness that's nearly peppery in character. Big oregano and possibly mint flavors are also involved in a gripping aftertaste. Varnish-like, yet smooth, mouthfeel is downright numbing without being astringent. Like a bulldozer with a leopard interior. This is a big beer whose characteristics didn't quite resolve for me until I was nearly done with the sample (12 oz.), at which point my tastebuds were exhausted anyway. The first time I had this beer, I liked it a lot better than I liked this sample, and I have reason to believe that this bottle may have been mishandled.

I soon pour this golden/orange exilir into the pint and note the massive citrusy/hoppy aromas that are present. Reminds me a lot of Dreadnaught. First sips conjure more sweetness than I would have liked, but the hop bite is immense. Not as much balance as Dreadnaught and aftertaste is stuck with the syrupy sweetness of an ultra-hopped beer. The 9 percent alcohol never steps up to take center-stage, but you can certaintly feel it's effects.

The mix of hops invades my nose...and some citrus hints come throuh too. I could smell this one for quite some time...definetly more fragrant than the 60 minute. The first sip is great...a wall of hops hits my tounge and it doesn't hold back. The biterness is just right and the brew is very well balanced. The alcohol is virtually nonexistant in the taste. This beer will make any hophead smile. The barley and hops are near perfect...this is definetly one of my new favorite IPA's. Mouthfeel on this brew is perfect...a full body without being to overwhelming....I couldn't ask for anything more. As far as drinkability..I'm going to have to rate this quite highly as well. It tastes great, goes down easily and truly satisfies my craving for a wonderfully hoppy brew. I think the only major downfall to this beer may be its price tag...a little hard on the wallet...but it's still damn well worth it.

The hop flavor is displayed like a stuffed moose head for all the world to see. Coats the mouth with bitter, hoppy, potent oiliness but doesn't let you forget where this is coming from: Dried out malty flavor and carbonation combines to make this a fairly effervescent, refreshing beer despite it's high abv and insane hop content.

I am jealous of the bloke that won it in the raffle. This beer was quite good after being Randallized. It poured a dark, dirty amber in color, with little head. The hops were fresh and crisp and did a great job of covering up the alcohol taste. Without the Randall I think the alcohol might be slightly to noticeable to really enjoy this beer. It was a great sipping beer when you have time to sit back and really enjoy a beer. Not to be rushed, but savored.","MuddyFeet","Jun 28, 2004"

This beer has a depth of which I have not encountered too many times before. Very, very hoppy yet not too bitter. The malt base is superb. Lots of caramel malts and a somewhat wheaty base.

It is, of course, more intense than the 60 minute, which is the other DFH hop beers that I've tried. This one poured a deep gold with a substantial head and tremendous, long lasting lasting lacing all the way down the pint. The aroma is overwhelmingly one of hops to the point that it is all that I can smell. The taste is mahvelous, as Billy Crystal would say. A real hops treat, bitter as it should be but with a hint of sweetness at the end. This is a substantial beer with an hop oil feeling to it in the mouth. It goes down really smooth.

Rich hop and sweet bready malt come across. Fruity alcohol is apparent in the nose. The taste is incredible. The beer is so smooth, complex with slick hop oils and sweet sticky fruit. Not as grapefruit-like as some other Imperial IPAs. One burp will let you know that the hops are in charge, but they don't offend when the beer is being drank. They're hidden in there, nice and happy, not raw but mixed up in the malt. Mmmm. Slick and slippery, this one goes down without asking. I keep thinking about brandy, without the aftertaste. Rich and delicious all over. The alcohol is there, and really contributes to the flavor, but in a very good way. A pitcher of 9% hit me pretty hard. Still, the beer is a triumph.

The aroma is still predominantly hops (citrus, mint, herbal) with some sweet maltiness. The taste has some orange notes, it is slight yeasty and then finishes with herbal, minty, earthy hops.

After tasting the first sip, my face lit up with a smile due to tasting the very hoppy tones, which dissipated nicely throughout the sip, but then came the sugar I tasted at the rear-end of the sip. This sugar really came through and got me interested in how they got it to taste like cotton candy or rock candy, with hints of green grapes in there! This sealed the deal for me with this one! It was medium bodied, with good flavor, mouthfeel, etc. I honestly wish I had a 2nd bottle to crack right now! I definitely recommend.

Huge amount of piny bitter hops is present, with some heavy grapefruits, masking out all malt and yeast smells. The taste is sweet citrus, grapefruit mostly again, with the hops bitterness pushing in immediately afterwards. It has a bit of an earthy mossy taste too. This beer is pushing on being too sweet. The mouthfeel is a tiny bit thick with tons of sharp carbonation which along with the sharp bite of the hops, necessitates the slow drinking of this beer. The 9 cents of alcohol in here are quite evident, so watch out... drink too many of these too quickly, and you might find yourself in a bit of a pickle.

Beige head that dies leaving good lacing around the pint glass. Piney, grapefruity, sprucy and floral hop aromas with a touch of honey-like malt sweetness. In a strange sense, this is a really balanced Imperial IPA. When I say that, I mean that it is obviously aggressively hopped, but only retaining small amounts of the "sweetened iced tea" malt profile that shows up in a lot of domestic microbrewed pale and IPAs. That is a residual effect of the lupulin and humulin compounds in hops. This beer has minimal qualilties like that because I feel premium hops were used, as well as a well-thought-out grain bill.

Sweet alcohol breaks ground for the flavor, and thos citrus, almost mandarin hops take over, exchanging blows with the maltiness throughout the flavor.

4.3,0.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,"Wow. I like this beer a great deal. Very nice nose. I get a touch of alcohol and a great mellow hop scent, not spicy or citrusy, just nice. A little warm malt on the nose too. This might be my favorite "imperial IPA" I've ever tried. Very nicely balanced beer, that is just close enough to extreme in both malt/sweetness and hoppyness that it makes for an interesting and unique beer. Also the typical DFH taste is there. Don't know how to explain it, but I noticed it first in the 60 minute and its here too. Kind of like a "crunchy" flavor...nutty kind of. I really like it. Maybe its because of the continual hopping...you get some vegetal flavors...I don't know. It is quite drinkable, but I couldn't do more than 2 or 3 in a sitting. I'm still not sure how to score the drinkability field. But I think this is a bit much. The sweetly smooth hoppyness bothers me after a while.","cerevisiaephilus","Feb 21, 2004"

Nearly no head and scant lacing, although that could be a product of my girlfriend washing my beer glass's and not getting all the soap residue off. Oops. The smell of this beer is strangely like canned pineapple. I also thought the same thing about the 120 min IPA. Hmmm. Also a big dose of alcohol fumes as well as some earthy hoppy odors, almost skunk like. The taste is quite earthy and hoppy. Almost too bitter, it leaves your tongue a bit dry. The heavy hop flavor is followed by a weird sweet fruitiness, again canned pineapple is the best way I can describe it. The finish is alcohol and bitterness. The mouthfeel is good, not very carbonated really. Although strangely, it is a bit filling, which brings me to drinkability. Too filling for my taste, I doubt I would drink more than 2, although the unique flavor would bring me back again for seconds. All an all, a nice offering from Dogfish.

Nevertheless, an honest film for a beer of this caliber maintains the position. The smell is floral hops up front with definite orange character. Innocent malt is not absent from that sniff in the form of baked cookies. As it enters the mouth, it's rather "coating", thick and velvety as seems usual with dogfish head. First sip is excellent with a sausage+sauerkraut dinner, great combination. I appreciate the difference from all-cascade IPA, but still, the last sips seemed far more boring, one-dimensional, rather tart in mouth and all about agressive (unbalanced) bitterness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is top notch clean though and 9% is nowhere to be found.","Rastacouere","Feb 01, 2004"
4.23,-1.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a unique, bold golden yellow color. Active carbonation builds a respectable off-white head that subsides into a very fine, clingy lace. Complex hops are prominent in the nose (no surprise!), but there's an earthy, caramely malt scent that lends a pleasant balance. My only complaint about the nose is its relative weakness, even as the beer warms. Hops blanket the tongue nearly from the start with the sweet malt base forming an occasionally-detectable foundation underneath the bitterness and tartness. Finishes with strong alcohol warmth in the very back of the throat and a flavor that reminds me most closely of darkish maple syrup. Despite the intense cling of the hops, the mouthfeel is not overly sticky or syrupy. I love hops bitterness, and I also appreciate balance.

Not quite as overwhelming as the 120, but quite bold in it's own right and infinitely more drinkable, dangerously so. Pours out a faded orange color capped with a tight white head. Aroma is enough to make our mouth water, laden with sweet caramel malt, flowery hops as well as sime piney spice. Taste is not what you expect for an IPA this big, sweet and a bit malty at first, then in march the hops, just a bit sharp and spicy at first then bursting into mixed citrus glory. Very sweet and thick, quite full bodied all the way through. Lots of complexity in the background as well, with hints of oak and vanilla and just the right bitterness. Surprisingly smooth, the 90 minute is quite impressive.","mikeys01","Jan 28, 2004"
4.32,0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured out a hazy, burnt orange with a small white head and heavy, heavy lacing down the glass. I believe this is bottle conditioned as well. The smell was of pine and citrus fruit with a definitive astringent alcohol aroma, but it somehow worked for me. The taste was sweet and thick with citrius, tangerine, pine ---- a little bit of everything. This brew was very full bodied and much more balanced as an Imperial IPA than I had imagined. The aftertaste did mellow out a little but overall it was pretty sharp on the tongue. I would give the drinkability factor a little less than perfect just for the sheer ABV factor, but man this was really nice. I love their 60 minute (and think the price difference is only justified between the 60 & 90 if you really need that extra kick.

The hop flavor is layered and comes to your tongue in waves. At first, I was thinking more pine but then it seemed more citrus. It slowly builds up to a delicious bitter and dry finish.

The smell was loaded with lovely floral hops, numerous citrus notes, and sweet malt undertones...well done. The taste however, was phenomenal. I experienced light sweet honey and peach/nectarine-like maltiness which melded harmoniously with assertive and crisp bitterness. The bitterness isn't near the 100 IBU mark at all, but it is big. The citrusy nose, lightly sweet malts, and the level of bitterness are tuned to each other perfectly. On top of this, the mouthfeel was perfect: full and very silky...wow. I was blown away. I have tried the bottled version, both 750ml (nail man) and small bottles, in the past, but I don't remember it being quite this good. All of the above made for a highly drinkable brew, as the sweetness was well in check, and there was no sign of alcohol. Big flavors but not out of control big. Simply amazing. I think it should be dubbed "The Nectar of the Gods".","HiroProtagonist","Jan 04, 2004"

It is not as overpoweringly bitter as I had originally expected, instead it is maltier than I had thought it would be, even a bit chewey. It had a good bitter finish and pleasant aftertaste.

The look on my glass was mid-amber, slightly hazy, with a lazy white head and insignificant lacing. A good taste is had from the citrus hopping and is of a grapefruit and rind nature, followed by some caramel kicking in at the finish.

A shiny burnt amber color beer glistened in the pint glass and contrasted against the 1" head. The aroma provided an intense display of fruity esters and deep english style hops. The first mouthful revealed loads of complex malty goodness. The malts weighed on the tounge and then as the beer washed over the back of my tounge and throat, some serious hops kicked in and balanced out the mouthfeel like an IPA should. The finish left loads of deep hop bitterness, making me look forward to the next gulp. I could drink this beer all the time if I could afford it (not that it isn't worth the price though).

The smell is hoppy with some spice; like the 60 minute, there are some citrus undertones. The taste is hoppy, spicy (I think), with some pine tones (again I think).

A straight up fundamental hops aroma kicks some nice ass. Kind of syrupy but not really....very drinkable for 9% ABV. The hops is kinda fruity at first, but it doesn't last long before a total onslaught of blunt hops force beckons the devil upon the buds of taste. This process is an addicting one which makes this one heluva IPA. Dogfish Head is the best thing to ever come out of Delaware, except maybe Dover Downs.","AudioGilz","Sep 08, 2003"
3.33,-22.2,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"12 oz bottle. Pours a hazy amber in color with a white head that retreats pretty quickly to a mere ring around the side of the glass. Aroma of piney hops, malt and alcohol. Medium-bodied with a very sharp carbonation that stabs at the tongue. Malt and biscuit can be detected early on. There's a subtle fruitiness that lingers and then gets stomped on by the citrusy hops. Nothing about the taste really stands out in particular, other than the hop bitterness. Supporting cast of flavors are lacking in complexity. The Imperial I.P.A concept seems stretched a bit thin here and sacrifices flavor in the process. I'm glad I tried it, for it's not a terrible beer, but nothing outstanding either.","Winter","Sep 08, 2003"
4.16,-2.8,5,4,4,4,4.5,"I couldn't wait to try this one so I didn't mind spending the $9 per 4pack. Poured a glowing, light amber color with a frothy white, pancake head that had real food retention - the perfect looking brew. The smell is great while not being to obtrusive, mainly a floral aroma with piney notes and a slightly sweet, candy-alcohol aroma. The taste was very well balanced, not overly hoppy like some of the "hop-crazy" brews I have seen around this summer. This almost had a barley-wine type of taste to it, with the sweet barley flavors in the aftertaste rather than an extreme hop bitterness. The mouthfeel was also nice - very full and smooth. A great beer, one of the best I have had in a while. By the way, the head is still there.","nixhecks","Sep 02, 2003"

It poured a hazy copper color with very little in the way of a head. There was a white head for a short time, but that receded very quickly into some errant pockets of cubble clinging to the edge of the glass. Smell had nots of serious bitter hops plenty of alcoholic esters, maple syrup, brandy and pears. Taste was pretty darn good as well. Huge amount of hops thrown int with a ton of alcohol, which was not extremly well hidden, malts were almost non existent as was carbonations. I am not sure where it went to. All in all I liked the 60 Minute a lot better, and also like other "Imperial" IPAs such as Rogue's and the Dreadnaught better, but this was worth the money spent.

The over malting is balanced by the extreme over hopping. At 9% alcohol and 90 IBU, you would expect this beer to be much harsher and stronger tasting. It is surprising in it mellowness and subtly. Malts have a touch of fruitiness and sweetness to them. Hops are dominant and are floral and slightly spicy. Complex flavors. Thick taste, thick I will be picking hops otta my teeth for a couple of days. Grapefruit flavor intensifies as it warms. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. It took forever, several tools and a corkscrew to get the cork out, but it was worth it.

3.4,-20.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"The smallish head settled quickly to a wisp of bubbles around the edge. The aroma, as expected from an aged version, was a subdued piney hops, honeyish malt and fusel alcohol. The front of the beer is slightly sweet but that doesn't last long. The middle and end blur together as a hop and alcohol assault on the tongue. A saving grace was a drier finish than you would expect. Overall I found it a bit harsh. Even after 2 years in the bottle, I found the fusel alcohol/burning bitterness characteristics a bit overwhelming. I don't expect IIPAs to be the most balanced beers out there, but I expect them to be drinkable. I've had many that were better than this. The first couple of glasses were OK, but it became a bit of a chore after that. I think a cleaner, more balanced 12 oz version would be more appropriate.","pbrian","Jul 31, 2003"

Wisps of a sweet floral aroma are evident from a distance. Up close, the strong hoppy aroma has both citrus notes and very strong florals that combine with the malt to bring images of bubble gum to mind. The taste catches me off guard, as the powerful malt sweetness sends my head spinning. I'm becoming a bit of a hop lover, but malt is my first love. The sweet fruity malt gives way to a great floral hop taste the ends with just a touch of a honey note. Biscuity malt notes, orange flavored honey, a touch of pine, ooooh this is gooood! The mouthfeel is very full, but not thick in any way. Drinkability is too good, as I just noticed this was a 9% ABV brew! I was thniking I needed a case of this stuff, but realizing what I paid for one that may not be in the cards. Plus, I'd probably be snookered all the time becuase this stuff is excellent. Sam and the crew at Dogfish Head can really make a mean IPA. Actually, they make at least three. And this one is the best of the lot. If you see it, buy it.

Wow, smacks you right in the nose Hello ! Citrus, and grass dominate the nose, almost like a wood chipper. First taste is super charged hop bitterness as expected. Mouth puckering bitterness matched with a nice citrus charge. High abv seemed to make a presence causing more of a heat and slickness than I wanted from an IPA. I think this detracts from the enjoyment a bit, and drinkability for me. I had it with dinner and maybe it's better suited as a sipping beer, as I know see the website suggests. Certainly an extreme beer, but so far in my experience I would choose the Stone IPA over this one. I think this goes a little too far to be an experience in itself, and crashes your tastebuds into submission.","StevieW","Jul 18, 2003"

Leaves incredible stringy lace in drippy rings. Smell is all peachy, a bit citrusy and a piney/woodish backing, somewhat earthy, soft but nice and rich of hops galore. Taste is wildly smooth and soothing of peachy/citrus hops, one hell of a nice bittering effect thats very calm and easy. Some light earthy tones dotted in the mix with a blend of well balanced malts, gotta keep those hops in check, I suppose. Feel is full and quite bittering in a mild sense, in which it doesn't linger to much to be over the top in any way. This is quite excellent stuff, I don't care that its 9%, which is masked beautifully by the way, its way to damn easy to drink, which makes for a short evening.","tavernjef","Jun 15, 2003"

Also, thanks to the reviewer of World of Beverages in Norwalk, as I took a ride over and found this winner, along with Allagash Summer White. I'll be driving over tomorrow to get some more. FYI - I did not find the 9% ABV an issue - didn't even know it was that high until I read the bottle later.

I have also tried 60 Min and 120 Min (both very fresh) and thought they were much more intense. This sample actually seems like your run of the mill IPA. Not too hoppy, not too alcoholic. Maybe that is the trick; maybe after a few more sips I will be schnockered, with my tongue stripped to ribbons by the hops, and the only recourse left is to hammer nails into my skull. Dark gold, bordering on amber with huge white head that lasts and laces. Aroma was the most surprising part; it was remarkably subtle and much less hoppy than other reviewers have indicated. Perhaps that is a result of the small amount of aging it has received. Trademark DH sweet malts that actually seem very un-beer-like; closer to Dr Pepper or gingerbread or something. Hops are there, for sure: tangy, bitter, not particularly dry and not especially huge. A tasty brew, for sure, but maybe the DH hype has gotten a little too carried away with this one. They make several beers far superior to this.","Thrasher","Jun 03, 2003"

There is about 1 finger of head that dies down to a small line quickly, but leaves a little lace on the glass. The smell is a mixture of hops and citrus. The taste has just a little bit more of a hoppy tang than the 60 min. A hint of orange is in there somewhere underneath all the hops. The mouthfeel is very strong, yet smooth.

Initially it is like I'm snorting a handful of hops, but eventually a distinctivey orange-juice aroma begins to dominate -- very nice. It is followed toward the end of the beer by a piney, almost 'pine-sol'-like smell. The flavor is marked primarily by leafy hops, with notes of bitter grapefruit and green tea. Sugary malts are presented mid-palate, in the effort to balance out the sharp hop flavor, and they fade back into the bitterness of the finish.

4.55,6.3,4.5,4.5,5,4,4,"Slightly hazy orange color, carbonation rises like a swarm of killer bees from all over the bottom and replenishes a monster head. Laces in sheets. Screamin orange extract aroma, carries a foot from the pint glass. Surprisingly, a boat load of caramel malts fire a salvo onto the tongue and thicken the mouthfeel. A heavy dose of hops only drags the rope back to its side (with a vengeance) closer to the finish, with a blast of juicy bitter bitter. Aroma balances malt earlier, quite an interesting take on balance. A beer at war with itself. I loved the novelty here, would definitely buy again (unless I had a cold sore in my mouth ;>) ) Alcohol is a little obvious. Not a bad beer for my 500th review at BeerAdvocate...","ADR","Jan 08, 2003"

Zum wohl now there are some hops like a walk in the forest this beer fills up my senses. Hops of pine cone origin and a nutty trail mix-esque tone very full and malty just a heavenly combination for some not ready for the amount of hops this beer contains then it may be easier to just smell instead of consume. I orginally compared this flavor to a crashing wave allow me to just say this is a kick in the teeth full of flavor, it's is truly amazing how so many hops were put into this brew to retain a balanced flavor. Burping up hops this is great with syrupy sweetness mixed with a hazelnut caramelly edge to it and the hop resins in full cohesion to form a heavenly experience a must try for all beer lovers this is a staple in the realm of Imperial IPAs. Mouthfeel is full and syrupy but wow how drinkable is this stuff at 9% watch out because this beer is too drinkable at any occasion or function what a beer. A truly satisfying beer right down to my soul thanks Sam I will have to thank you one day for having the balls to make a beer this unique and wonderful at the same time.","WVbeergeek","Dec 23, 2002"

The 90 Minute pours a nice golden to orange color with a supple head that hangs in there and leaves a thick pretty lace on the glass. The aoma is that wonderfully familair, citrusy hop pungency.The taste is hoppy and robust but nicely balanced with an appropriate amount of malt.Mouthfeel is very good with a velvety almost buttery texture.Nice hoppy bite in the finish.

The taste reflected the smell. Hops were present but that is pretty much it as far as flavors. The alcohol taste was present as well. The beer finished as it started not that great and a small aftertaste.

The aroma pure fresh green hop. If you have ever picked hops you know that fresh slightly oily, slightly earthy green aroma. The hop taste is balanced with an assertive yet low key maltiness that seems to support the hops rather than battle with them. 90 IBU's and 9% ABV and you will be warm and hoppy all night long. Dogfish Head is known for pushing the envelope and this ale does just that. This is an ale that is meant to be and is BITTER. What a wonderful thing.","purplehops","Nov 18, 2002"

Hops dominate the nose with floral, citrus, and grassy, earth aromas.  This beer has a strong hop flavor with a substantial body and slick, smooth mouthfeel.  Hop flavors are all over the place though the earthy flavors stand out the most to me.  Floral and citrus flavors echo the aroma.  Malt taste is faint and yells in the background, "Here I am!" but the hops keep it restrained as they demand full attention.  The alcohol chimes in with a whisper shortly after.  The long, bitter finish grips the tongue and doesn't seem to want to let go.  This is really a hopheads delight.  Treat like a Belgian quantity wise as the alcohol content can easy send your head swimming.  I recommend this beer to people with a taste for hops.","DrewS","Nov 13, 2002"

A good deal of carbonation is present.  An aroma of hops and a touch of citrus.  A flavor of hops with some sweetness present.  Also some of the alcohol is present.  A touch astrigent in the finish with some bitterness.  The sweetness of this one is offset by the presence of the alcohol.  While not one of the hoppier IPAs, it is good and doesn't get offset to much with the sweetness.  A good IPA.","Wildman","Oct 31, 2002"

Surprising lack of hop aroma for such a high IBU. Seems to be lacking in hop flavor as well. Have I really gotten this used to hop bitterness or has this bottle been aged long enough that the hops aren't as much a part of the mix anymore? I'll find out tomorrow when I revisit the Arrogant Bastard. Has a flavor (from the yeast perhaps?) that I picked up in World Wide Stout and Raison D'etre. It's similar (vaguely) to some of the flavors I associate with Belgian yeast. As it warmed, I picked up more hops, mostly pine-like but some citric qualities, but never as much as I would expect from a beer that advertised its IBU.","aracauna","Aug 27, 2002"
4.85,13.3,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Well, what can I say about this beer. The label has a guy hammering a nail up his nose, I read that the hop process was used with one of those old-school electric football games (which would be the second best use for them since I saw one smashed over the head of an individual in a pro-wrestling match), and there is a damn cork in the bottle. Something ain't right here and I'm bound to find out what it was. Turns out, there is not much wrong with it at all. After having a minor grappling match with the cork, my efforts were soon rewarded with an exceptionally thick head on the pour. A almost ruby color in my glass and a burst of hopiness in the taste making this a great beer. I first had this at the IBF in Portland and now I remember why I kept going back for second and third helpings. A must have for any beer geek. This one is definately on the list to repurchase over and over.","sinistersteve","Aug 27, 2002"

4.12,-3.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"A bottle-conditioned IPA utilizing a single, constant 90 minute hop addition of Cascade, Columbus and Chinook. They originally did this by hooking and old "electric football" game above the kettle and adding hops to the top of it. As it vibrated, the hops were slowly shaken off the edge. Unfortunately, (since it makes such a great story and everyone has fond memories of electric football) it got sprayed with water and never ran again! Now they've got a slow moving auger. The 90 minute is available in bottle (and draft at the brewpub), but the 60 minute is draft only (update - 12 oz. bottles were added in March 2003!). It has an impressive hop aroma but I kind of expected more. The malt is very basic in flavor (not very caramelish), but rich with a good body. Thankfully, it's enough to handle the intense hop flavors. There's alot of yeast character including an apricot fruitiness. The alcohol is a bit on the high side but it may smooth out if aged. The bitterness is there. Really there. As one local beer writer said, "Feel the burn". Definitely on the edge!","NeroFiddled","Jul 22, 2002"

Taste is at first bitter as all hell, some estery fruitiness peeks thru midway, followed by hops and alcohol to lead the way to a tremendous hop finish. This is an IPA on steroids, highly drinkable even with it's in-your-face qualities. Slam a 750ml. bottle of this quick enough & you'll want to try re-enacting the picture on the label!

My sample was the 1 pint 9.6 oz. bottle.  Lets just say I'm glad I had this at home.  For the hops wallop this beer packs, it is surprisingly drinkable.

I've homebrewed beers with more bitterness than this, but I have to credit to the brewers for producing such a highly hopped product. I think this beer could be a little stronger, closer to the strength of a barleywine, which would make it a good choice for laying down in a cellar.

After the palette adjusts and the beer warms, tasty malt, fruity esters and a touch of diacetyl become part of the flavor profile.  They must've used a British yeast.  The hop character is definitely American, but those esters make for a bastard of an IPA.  Lots of alcoholic warmth in the finish.  A tad hazy with a thick creamy head.  This is a complex beer that must be sipped or your ass will be kicked.  I'm drinking this by myself since everyone else here loves wine.  I guess my ass will be kicked.  I'll place this a notch below Stone's 5th Anniversary IPA.","marc77","Dec 25, 2001"
