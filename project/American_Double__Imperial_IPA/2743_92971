The nose comprises sweetbread, mild booze, sweet resin, candied grapefruit zest, and a twinge of red apple.  The taste brings in more of the same, the sweet malts and fruity hops really making for a treacle-y sweet flavor profile for most of the time spent on my tongue.  Near the end, some dank grass shows up to provide a bitter bite for us.  The body is a lean medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, this is too big and sweet for its own good.  It's not a bad beer by any stretch, but it was a bit of a chore to work through.","TMoney2591","Mar 19, 2015"

This is a beast of a beer and the hop flavors are rather unique at times, going beyond the typical citrus and tropical elements although these are present and accounted for. Obviously some prior hop experience is a must in order to fully appreciate. Its a hot one from hops and booze perspectives.

Aroma is citrusy and piny; the hops hit you right away. Wonderfully balanced taste. The strong hops will certainly satisfy the hops head ; a great dry bitter hops finish that leaves you wanting more.

Overall I love it. A huge dose of piney goodness and sweetness to balance. My kind of big IPA. I can understand how the palates of those who don't walk on the wild side of flavor-town might be overpowered by this big luscious beauty.

4.5,14.5,,,,,,"The taste is where things get interesting. The 100 IBUs announce themselves well. But the hop profile changes. While pine resin is indeed there, there is also a real lovely grassy-anise flavor. That was cool. Finishes more lime than lemon... and of course a nice boozy warmth. Not to syrupy for a 10.1 ABV. I would imagine that this will be on tap at Raglan and Queensland Public in San Diego...","MisterGone","Beers"

2.9,-26.2,3.75,3,2.75,3,2.75,"Overall I wasn't a fan of this beer and I thought it was a very average example of a Tripel IPA, it had some big hop flavors, but the good aspects only showed up in the background and the flavors that stuck out the most weren't that great.  This beer didn't have good drinkability, it was a little smooth, a little warming, not too crisp, a little sticky, a little filling and the taste didn't do a good job at holding my attention, one is more than enough for me, no way I would want to drink another one in a row.  What I liked the most about this beer this beer was the appearance, this was a pretty nice looking beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the taste and drinkability, there weren't that good and they really held this beer back from being as good as it could be, the sweetness and green onion hops were my biggest problem with this beer.  I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's very easy to find a better tasting strong hoppy beer.  I wouldn't recommend this beer, it just isn't a great example of the style, but if you like lots of sweetness and green onion hops it may be worth a shot.  All in all I didn't like this beer, it just wasn't for me and it got hard for me to find the good in this beer the more I drank it.  It reminds me of the Devil Dancer that was released a couple years ago that was very green onion like.  IT's now my least favorite Green Flash beer and my least favorite Tripel IPA.  Better luck next time guys, this beer just isn't for me.  I'm starting to lose motivation to try new beers from this brewery, I keep on getting disappointed.","StoutHunter","Oct 09, 2014"

Had wonderful, clean lemon and piney aromas... and I am stunned to say definite mango as well. I am not used to such a distinct 'citrus' smell, it is usually a bit more general of a smell to me. Mango. The mango notes were also in the taste, along with a harsh bitterness (100+ IBU after all, but in a good way), a fresh piney hit, and not a bit of sweetness. Hop heavy. Hid the ABV very well. Clean and refreshing mouthfeel, medium. Very good feel for a DIPA. Such a great nose, I really like this. Will have to buy again some time.","Mikus","Oct 09, 2014"

But there is a pleasurable malt backbone that balances this brew out. I will definitely seek this brew out again in the future.

The taste is strong pine and bitter at the front and really sweet at the end. The mouth feel is syrupy and there's a strong alcohol presence. Overall I think this beer completely missed the style. For a triple IPA, the sweetness of the malt should never dominate the beer. This is definitely my least favorite Green Flash beer.","mc4z","Jan 30, 2014"

A great IPA (I'm a hophead), even better than Stone IPA, which I think is a great IPA. It's so well balanced that even at 10.0% ABV I couldn't sense the alcohol on the nose or on the palate. Plenty of hops, but so well balanced that they don't over power the taste.","PSLBeerGuy","Dec 12, 2013"

The hops cultivar is not widely known by name as one of the highly-sought New Zealand cultivars, and perhaps with good reason; it's profile is most comparable to the most sturdy and intense of West Coast (California) hops.","beagle75","Nov 15, 2013"

Taste matches perfectly, maybe my palate is damaged because it is really well balanced, tropical with some grapefruit and pine threw out.

It's medium bodied, modestly boozy, bitter in both the taste and lingering finish - no citrus rind, little carb, adequate sweetness, and little acidity.

4,1.8,4,4,4,4,4,"a huge ipa, showcasing the new Zealand hops, a great project this one. it pours hazy burnt orange color, little bits of yeast are visible if you strain the eye, but the overall appeal is lovely, under a robust inch of thick off white foam. the nose is quite bitter, tropical fruity, and full of zest. I smell an acidic mix of fruits from orange to pineapple, but there is a lightness and a brightness to this that is uncommon in such big versions of the style. its clean and sort of oceanic, a great mindset before the first sip. bitterness is obvious right away, and honestly most of the real flavor comes in the aftertaste, where minerals and piquant fruits marry beautifully. I don't get much pine as the label denotes, but I do get a unique hop profile, reminds me of a topaz single hop brew I had in saint Louis, but I know this is different. I am amazed how bitter it finishes for such a fruity flavor. it also comes across a lot lighter than 10.1% abv, although as it warms up its a lot more apparent. good carbonation and a sturdy body on this make it a nice fall ipa. its tropical vibe takes me on a needed vacation, and its alcohol to bottle size ratio allows me to forget all the stresses in my life. a nice escape this one. all green flash beers are brutally hoppy, and this one is the exclamation mark on the lineup. good good beer.","StonedTrippin","Oct 22, 2013"

Scents of citrus pith, pineapple, grapefruit, tropical fruit, and pine. A classic West Coast IPA aroma. Taste is of bitter pine, grapefruit pith, a bit of a spicy hop flavor, strong levels of hop bitterness, though not Palate Wrecker level, with a nice sweet malt backbone. Bitter aftertaste. Very good, it's hop forward but not overwhelmingly so, served very well by the malt balance. Mouthfeel was medium bodied with moderate carbonation, about what I expect for a DIPA. Overall this was a great DIPA, it hit all the usual West Coast hop forward flavors, balanced with a bit of malt. I'd go back to it.","Auraan","Oct 16, 2013"

4.22,7.4,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 1/10/2014. Pours moderately cloudy orange amber color with a 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of huge mango, passion fruit, pineapple, tangerine, peach, lemon zest, orange rind, floral, grass, pine, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity of tropical/citrus hop notes with a fair amount of malt balance; and great strength. Taste of mango, peach, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange rind, floral, pine, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Good amount of earthy floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of mango, peach, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange rind, floral, pine, light caramel, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity of citrus/tropical hop flavors with a fair amount of malt balance; and no cloying bitterness present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a lightly slick, crisp, and very sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent DIPA! All around great complexity of citrus/tropical hop flavors with a fair amount of malt balance; and quite smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 10, 2013"

4.06,3.3,4,4.25,4,4,4,"The brew poured a clear amber with a small white head that instantly gave off the aroma of hops. The aroma was of tropical fruit and dank hops with a hint of pine underneath that gave it a spicy aroma. The first taste had citrus rind hops with more of the dank tropical fruits and a spicy pine finish. The hops were appropriately aggressive and leave you with a strong bitterness on your tongue. The malt did give the Green Bullet a somewhat sweet finish, but the overload of hops definitely kept it in the background. The brew was easily one of the hoppier beers out there and the huge hops keeps the high alcohol at bay. If you want an assault on your palate the Green Bullet will definitely leave you in hoppy happiness.","brurevu","Oct 10, 2013"

Quite shocked at the abv for its smooth and balanced taste. This could easily be a regular drinker for me, although I admit the hops do get to be a bit fatiguing for my taste, as nearly all IPAs do for me. Still, an excellent example and one which shows DIPAs (because of abv?) seem to suit me more that a single motor-hopped brew. Good job, Green Flash.","Beer-A-Lot","Oct 10, 2013"

The taste was much hoppier than the smell, with a grapefruit laden, tongue tingling,hop bitterness. The alcohol was very well hidden, and the beer felt nowhere near 10% ABV.

Poured into a snifter, with a very thin layer of grey head that dissipates rather quickly, leaving an even thinner ring around the glass. No lacing. The color is translucent golden/orange. It looks crisp. Typical trip. ipa aromas of heavy hops and malt are prominent: sticky pine, with a slight hint of mint, which is super interesting. The flavor profile is only slightly reminiscent of your typical trip ipa: Green Bullet is not nearly as sweat, which I tend to appreciate about this beer. It is sticky hoppy with some malt in the background, but mostly this is enjoyably hoppy, with pine and citrus as well. It almost has a pulpy feel to it. It's crisp, but smooth, and I'd say rather drinkable for a trip IPA. I like it. Overall good beer, one I'd grab again given the chance. It's more like a strong double IPA than your common triple. Less sweet too, which is a good thing. Cheers.","rodlavers","Sep 27, 2013"

4.52,15,4.5,4.25,4.75,4.25,4.5,"New seasonal from green flash, had in bottle and on draft. Very interesting beer, pours a clean bronze colour with a small head. The aroma for me was difficult to pinpoint, although I certainly detected the tropical and fruity notes of the New Zealand hop varietal along with a small amount of pine and plenty of booze. The taste follows suit, I am quite familiar with some of the New Zealand hops, specifically the pacific gem which I am fond of, so while i sort of knew what to expect, my expectations were met and in many respects, superseded. Tropical and fruity notes certainly dominate, pineapple, mango, and guava hit you upfront. This is followed by a some citrusy/lemony notes which compliment well. The malt presence is very light; a quality I personally like in an ipa, and this allows an aggressive, dry bitterness to show through. Although I think the 10.1% alcohol is fairly well hidden, it is certainly noticeable but not in a way that overpowers the great flavors that are harmoniously profiled. Very clean and crisp on the palate making it surprisingly drinkable for its strength. I found that this offering drew on some of qualities of their imperial ipa and to a slightly lesser extent, palate wrecker. I found it interesting to drink, and just like the imperial ipa, whilst difficult to judge first up, by the end I was intrigued and converted. All in all, this is an excellent ipa, and for me, the best green flash offering to date. Despite the fairly steep price tag here in nova, I will be looking out for more of this again throughout the remainder of the fall/early winter.","davet100","Aug 06, 2013"

4.1,4.3,4,4,4.25,4,4,"Poured into a goblet slightly hazed menacing looking burnt orange,it just looked like one of them big ballsy brash hop bombs.Aromas of pithy grapefruit and leafy/floral hops with a sweet caramel and alcohol base.I found the flavors to be not as sweet and boozy as I thought they would be but the hops are big and brash with citric and leafy flavors coming in waves over the carame/biscuit base,the alcohol is there but it didn't hit me over the head.A really nice big hopped "triple" IPA as GF calls it,I liked it alot.","oberon","Jun 18, 2013"
