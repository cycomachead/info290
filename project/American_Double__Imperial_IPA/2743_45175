Smells slightly dank and piney, with just a hint of fruit and malt.  Taste is overwhelmingly bitter, but with a slight burnt caramel-like aftertaste that helps offset the bitterness and makes it quickly dissipate.  Hints of pine, resin, floral and citrus hops and nice sweet crystal malt.  Mouth is thinner than I expected but comes across as refreshing and almost dry, but with just a touch of malt body.

Deep orange color with a very beige, off white (what, eggshell?) head that compacts to half finger and holds. The aroma is big citrus with some resinous stuff in there for good measure. The flavor is just a deep and sustained citrus hit that gets an add on of earthy pine across the palate, with a nice Simcoe bitter hit to round out the pine in the finish.

3.89,-6.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"OVERALL: Good stuff. The malty backbone gives it a higher FG than some of the other examples of the style, but I enjoy that, which is obviously a matter of personal taste. I don’t remember this brew being so soapy either, so since the recipe probably hasn’t changed, I guess my palate has done a bit of re-schooling. Can imagine this soapy character comes from using citra as a bittering hop, which really isn’t my thing. Still, this is a very well executed brew and has a lot of things I like about certain higher ABV double IPA’s. Well worth checking out especially if you like hopper brews with higher FG’s. Thanks again Frank for bringing this along all those years. It’s made me a curious searcher ever since. Cheers!","Jeffo","Nov 09, 2014"

There is a big hop bitterness here but also a nice balance to it, nice flavors of grapefruit, lemon, tangerine. One of the better imperial IPAs I've had.","BrewChatKen","Oct 28, 2014"

A definite bite of alcohol and hoppy goodness.  Finishes with a warm feel that lingers in back of throat.  Definitely not for the faint of heart.  A pretty smooth mid mouth feel.  Pretty accurately named.  I love this company more every time I try.","Gobearswalter34","Aug 19, 2014"

4.26,2.4,4.5,4,4.25,4.25,4.5,"Overall: This is the most appropriately named beer I've had in recent memory. I'm a hop head and find this to be a big beer. Very bold and intense flavors. Really does challenge the palate. In fact, i think the initial taste was borderline overwhelming. However, the finish and aftertaste is so vibrantly citrus which is my favorite aspect of this beer. I love a beer I can still taste on the ride home and even once I get home. I don't say this often, but one of these bad boys is definitely enough. This isn't one of my favorites in the style, but it is quite an experience, and id recommend it to any hop head. Cheers!","Bone53","Aug 04, 2014"

A reddish golden bronze color sporting a nice creamy beige head, I am indeed preparing for a palate-wrecking experience. Skimmed a couple of reviews below and cannot resist mentioning ... To the guy who was confused, the mash is sparged with a further dose of hopped wart, as opposed to the more typical water. The basis for the beer is a hopped wort, further purged of fermentables by yet more hopped wort. In any event, the aroma here is perfumy sweet, floral and herbal yet with a subtle butterscotch vibe, citrus, vinous fruit like white wine, and some dry white pepper. Green Flash manages to coax some complex multifaceted hop flavors out of its IPAs and this is no exception. The initial tastes are on the light side, some candied ginger, sweet tropical mango and lychee, something decidedly floral ... Honeysuckle? These elements give way to some grapefruit and blood orange citrus, green tea ... The bitterness ain't wrecking my palate initially, although now there's some interesting burnt mint and leather flavors revealing themselves. Soapy, slick mouthfeel with a few bubbles but not too fizzy. And BOOM, there's the bitter: Juniper and menthol, celery stalk and black pepper. About halfway through the bottle, a rank, powerfully resinous bitterness assails the mouth, like oolong tea steeped with pine needles. Some dried apricot appears in the otherwise pungent finish. Quite thick and syrupy but this does little to reign in the hoppy assault. While I have had more bitter DIPAs, at least in terms of raw power, this one steals the show when it comes to balancing aggression with nuance. Had to track it down in BC rather than Alberta.","CalgaryFMC","Apr 30, 2014"

Rich nose of grapefruit, with hints of other sweet citrus, over a light background of pine and caramel malt. Medium body with a smooth texture. The carbonation level is on the low end of normal. The complex flavor profile is a hop assault over a nice caramel balance. Grapefruit begins the assault with notes of other citrus. It then progresses to pine coupled with a nice intense bitterness that is pine and grapefruit rind. Towards the end, a well balanced caramel sweetness emerges to somewhat soothe the palate. The finish is an alcohol burn at the back of the throat with lingering bitterness and tartness. This one is not for the faint hearted.","tillmac62","Mar 18, 2014"

The company says it is made with hopped wort... but all IPAs are made with hopped wort so I'm not sure why they advertised that in this particular beer? Also the 12 oz was under half the price of the 22 oz, so not sure what the incentive would be to buy the 22 oz... (maybe they weren't expecting the liquor store to sell the 12s as singles).

I've had their West Coast IPA before; this seemed less bitter, but I didn't realize until after I bought it that it's also an old bottle (1/8/13). However, that didn't seem to matter, as the hops don't seem to have faded but rather melded nicely with the rest of the beer. I'd like to try this fresh as well for comparison.

I don't favor it as much as the other Green Flash double ipa's, but its still something ill buy every year. This is just another great offering from G Flash. It has equal quality and class to their other double ipa's, but still remains different in character. This is more traditional ipa turned up a few notches.

This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it wasn't the smoothest, slightly crisp, a little sticky, not too filing and the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention, one is enough for me, i don't have the urge to drink another one. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance, it was a very nice looking beer, it had good color, head and lacing. What I liked the least about this beer was the heavy green onion/garlic aspect, it just doesn't blend well with the other hoppy aspects. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's not hard to find a DIPA that I like more for a better price. I would recommend this as a good DIPA unless you really like the onion/garlic aspect. All in all I was a little let down with this beer, I've heard that many people enjoy this beer, but I can't say that was the case for me, those onion/garlic hops really held this beer back from being as good as it could be. This isn't my favorite DIPA and it didn't make for the best first impression for Green Flash, better luck next time guys, this one just wasn't for me.","StoutHunter","Feb 25, 2014"

If you have a penchant for bitter brews...this might be your weapon of choice. For the price, however, I will take Stone's Ruination without a thought. This is my 4th Green Flash brew and although I enjoy Palate Wrecker, I will prefer their Green Bullet, as it is much more unique. If/When Green Flash' satellite brewery in Virginia Beach, VA launches, I hope that brews like Palate Wrecker will be more affordable in the East Coast....until then, I will take Stone's Ruination IPA.

Also reducing the rating on mouthfeel from 4.5-4. But it's still so good, I'm surprised it's almost gone already.

Smell is fruity with a little pineapple, orange, and a little a little mango. There is seems to be a little sweet malt in the background that gives the beer a tiny bit of balance in the nose but it's hop forward to be sure. Taste is definitely a little more malty in the mouth with a little leather and sweetness but the hops are the spotlight with the fruit smelled in the nose but more bittering hops as it's drank and slides down the throat. To be clear there is a little bitterness in the mouth but it really is more so in the throat. Mouthfeel is fairly thin to a tad thicker which is great for the style. Overall this is a nice example of this type of beer. I really like it.","NeedBeerHere","Dec 26, 2013"

It reeks of scent, flavor, mouth-feel, and anything else you might want. It has grapefruit notes out-the-arse, and it does indeed, 'wreck' you palate. But that's only an issue if you want to eat during, not after. Chase this with a slice of pizza, a filet mignon, or ceviche- it doesn't matter. Your palate- true to word- will be cleansed, save for a slightly lingering citrus note. They should--- for diet conscious customers--- put out nutrition info, this must be ~250-300 cal/bottle, if that matters to you. With that said, enjoy.

The taste was aggressively hoppy with a great blend of citrus, dank and piney hop flavors to make it a perfect Hop Bomb. While it covered my palate with a hoppy resinous residue it was surprisingly drinkable and an enormously enjoyable Double IPA. In short, I loved this beer.","brurevu","Sep 03, 2013"

Taste starts out with very bitter piney hops right off the bat, with some sweeter fruity hops following, more subdued. It gets more drinkable after each sip, and the caramel malt is more noticeable as it warms. Hop-heads will love this; others may find it too bitter. A great in-your-face DIPA; don't be expecting something called "Palate Wrecker" to be subtle.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Jul 20, 2013"

I've tasted several well-balanced, surprising delicious Imperial / Double IPAs recently that let the malts share the stage with a hop extravaganza, proving that a big beer can be both hop-forward and balanced, which is what made them quality beers. This beer is the opposite of that concept. It's going to be a while before my tongue forgives me.

It looks rich and full of flavor... almost overflowing with it. The aroma is very bright and bursting with fruit esters - kiwi, pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine, and a little dash of brown sugar. Getting to the actual flavor - it's got a good amount of malt sweetness that I did not expect, and the hop aspects start off with that grapefruit juiciness, then it evolves to"resinous," to a final super piny, drying bitterness. I welcome the harshness of the finish. It's amazing how one beverage goes from juicyfruit to such a sharp dryness. I love it. It's a heavy beer too, beware.

Stacks of bitterness dominate without all the ancillary hop flavors that I know and love. This tastes like what happens when I cook and reduce an IPA too much for the rest of the recipe. Bitterness is great, but not when it is standing alone. I suppose it is living up to its name of wrecking palates, and I can appreciate that, but I want more. More citrusy grapefruit, more malt backbone, or more sticky resin, this is a good beer but needs another dimension to become a great one.","watermelonman","Jun 11, 2013"

Green Flash has bottled pure hop essence in a container that can barely hold it, as I found out with just a single whiff. I can honestly say that this is one of the hoppiest beers I’ve ever had, which is a distinction I don’t take lightly.

Flavor is almost entirely bitter grapefruit pith, grapefruit rind, a tiny hint of grapefruit and a bit of pine. Very little malt character, very much a hop forward beer. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, with low carbonation. The beer hid it's alcohol content quite well. An excellent hop forward beer, pure citrus and bitterness, probably one of the best west coast DIPAs I've tasted.","Auraan","Apr 21, 2013"

4,-3.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Clear amber pour, with a small white head that left some splashes of lace on the glass. As would be expected, the aroma was dominated by hops, citrus pith and pine resin, with hints of a caramel malt backbone bringing up the rear. Lots of orange and grapefruit in the taste, resin, pretty intense WC hop bitterness, with a little tropical fruit and malt sweetness to take the edge off, but the hops were clearly in charge. Maybe not as intense as their regular IIPA, though I'd like to try them back to back to test that theory. Medium body, appropriately carbonated. Maybe a little intense for greenhorns, but a good brew for hopheads.","Rifugium","Apr 19, 2013"

The alcohol is covered up really well but still has a nice sting at the end. Mouth is quite smooth and medium bodied. Slightly above average carbonation. Very crisp and refreshing. Overall, I love this brew. You usually don't get this type of pine smell or taste in a beer. Usually it's more of a pine needle taste, but in this it's more like the resin from the tree. I was actually expecting this to be way more bitter than it is, but I think they basically reached the point where it's so bitter that it doesn't really seem bitter. This is definitely one of my favorite IPAs. I'm not sure if I like this or the Imperial IPA they make more. I guess this would be more for a hophead, while the Imperial is less bitter but has a lot more in the way of character.","MisSigsFan","Apr 13, 2013"

Personal preference perhaps, but I feel this is middle of the road (or a slight step above) for a DIPA today.","Huhzubendah","Mar 30, 2013"

Amber in color with a somewhat short head, but that's okay given the abv. It's got that dill/green onion and sour cream thing going on in the nose from the hops- I happen to love those notes, but I know many do not. Really nicely bitter in the mouth, with an almost beefy flavor rife with the herbal and onion notes as well as some pine to give it some backbone. This is no citrus bomb, but if you're into this profile you'll love it. Very firm in the mouth at first, but then with a creamy finish and a long, mouthwatering, lingering bitterness.

The aroma was very piney and spicy and very much in line with the West Coast style. The taste is where the complexity started to show up. There was a mouth puckering, tobacco like bitterness up front which stayed throughout the taste. The initial shock of bitter was followed by some tropical fruits, such as mango and pineapple. The finish was spicy, with notes of ginger and clove. The beer felt very dry and did not show much of the character of the malt. This definitely lived up to its name, as I can't imagine having another beer after this, except if it's another Palate Wrecker.","rajendra82","Mar 15, 2013"

While it’s not quite blisteringly bitter enough to truly wreck my palate, it comes dangerously and wonderfully close. Especially as I’m getting toward the end of my glass, the bitterness builds and builds with each sip that I take. I’ve been hearing raves about this beer for a while and I’m so glad that I finally got to try it. It’s insanely drinkable for a beer this bitter that clocks in a nearly 10% ABV.

5,20.2,5,5,5,5,5,"Have had on tap in San Diego and in bottles on the east coast. IMHO, this is the best of its type - super hoppy IPA's. Lots of resin, pine, grapefruit. Some reviews say that it's unbalanced...not enough malts. Well, it's called Palate Wrecker; balance was not the objective. That being said, it is still extremely drinkable if you like the style. While it might not be so "balanced" in a traditional sense, it is delicious. This is a great beer, though not for everyone.","DIPA10","Feb 24, 2013"

A hearty, heady mix of resin, pine, tropical fruit, pineapple, and citrus make for quite the hop presence. The bitterness is pretty intense as well, and just seems to keep increasing into the long finish. I feel like there are hop flowers stuck to the roof of my mouth. Warming notes of fruity alcohol also grace the finish. Medium-full body with a creamy, thick feel. Gentle carbonation takes pity on my alpha acid wracked mouth. Palate wrecker? Maybe, but I like it.","alexgash","Feb 23, 2013"

The smell is amazing, best beer I have ever smelled. The crazy amount of fruit in the nose is intoxicating. The flavor, while being able to hold its own, seemed to be the most neglected part of this beer. Amazing legs, crazy awesome scent, mouthfeel for days, and a flavor that leaves you wanting more fruit. The bitterness could be toned back, and with that, the ABV, I think would make this beer much more palatable and much more sensational fruit and pine. While I don't regret buying this, if I was looking for a radical beer full of fruit, I would grab a Green Flash West Coast IPA.","Brewsephus","Feb 05, 2013"

The first few sips were top notch with that piny IPA very strong on the tongue. You quickly realize why it's called Palate Wrecker since it definitely burns out some taste buds the more you drink. For me, this Imperial IPA class is stacked with world class beers and this might have fell short of the upper tier by just a bit. Definitely a must try and one I'd go back to but the heaviness of the hops on the tongue made it fall just a tad short.","sjones5045","Jan 24, 2013"

There are plentiful tiny bubbles visible rising in the glass. There are aromas of sweet and bready malts with citrus (grapefruit and orange) and piney hops. The hop aroma is pretty intense. The first sip lives up to the namesake of the beer. The hops burst in the mouth with the piney hops and the citrus hops are there, but not as strong. The malts are there in the backbone, providing some nice bready sweetness. The alcohol is well-masked here and I can't even taste it at all. This is an excellent beer.","acevenom","Jan 24, 2013"

The beer had a huge pine hop taste, overly so for my taste, with a very bitter aftertaste. The beer had a moderate to heavy feel, it was creamy, and was well carbonated.

Aromas blast the nose with citrus and floral hops, both tart and resiny. Very inviting and powerful nose. Flavors are all over the palate. Initial blast of resiny hops, both oily and bitter, followed quickly by floral highlights and a tropical fruit blend of grapefruit and pineapple. The caramel malt backbone does its best to balance this behemoth. The hops also impart a solid spiced highlight, mostly pepper, throughout the brew. Tangy and very bitter aftertaste, leading to a slightly oily, dry finish. Tremendously crafted brew that tackles a tall flavor profile and keeps it all so very drinkable.","GarthDanielson","Jan 21, 2013"

A wallop of pineapple and mango and other tropical notes on the nose. You can almost feel the bitterness of the hops in the nostrils. A burst of pineapple, citrus floral notes, mango, a touch of caramel malt, and grapefruit rind bitterness that is balanced out on the finish by the sweetness of the unrelenting malt body.

Lots of pine, tangerine, grapefruit (tons of grapefruit), some pineapple, nice dose of underlying biscuity malt with a touch of sweetness. Bitter, metallic, sweet, pine, resin, more resin, some grapefruit peel, some nice spicy hops - really hoppy (haven't said that in a while). Medium bodied with small, sharp fleeting carb leaves a active feeling beer with a character wet almost slick finish. Nice mouthfeel here. Good beer.","harrymel","Dec 30, 2012"

The nose comprises pine resin, citrus salad, and a kiss of booze. The taste finally brings the name's promise to fruition: The bitterness on display burned through my tastebuds like vikings at Lindesfarne. It was all rind, resin, oils, and whatnot, with no real hop flavors besides. An alcohol kick comes forth as well, creating a sense of vinyl/rubber when combined with the bitterness and the subsequently shell-shocked tongue. Things are too much for me, and they definitely detract from any kind of enjoyment on my part. Many pain winces were evinced. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a decidedly dry finish. Overall, I suppose this beer delivers what it promises, but that's not really a good thing...","TMoney2591","Oct 25, 2012"
