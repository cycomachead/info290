As I sit here drinking this, I'm definitely feeling a let down.  The look is great, and the nose is fantastic--tropical fruits everywhere.  But the taste?  Simply doesn't follow the nose as I'd hope.  Compared to SOS, HT, and other DIPAs in the 8% range this beer lacks the flavor complexity.  I almost feel like I'm drinking a Stone IPA.  Bitterness prevents me from tasting the tropical fruits I was hoping for.  I will try again, but definitely won't go out of my way to get this one.  Big let down.","Tbub18","Jan 17, 2015"

Taste is wonderful.  Nice juicy tropical, citrus hop notes.  A balanced malt background is there, but the hops still shine through.  Medium mouthfeel, nice and creamy.  Overall a great Double IPA, and I'm really glad I got to try it.","BayouBengal1537","Nov 25, 2014"

My only complaint is that it finishes a little thin, the flavor kinda of just stops and doesn't follow through to the finish.  def not a heady topper but I don't think it's trying to be. Way different profile.  But still good. I like it","BMFR1811","Sep 19, 2014"

Grapefruit dominant, slight malty sweetness up front merges with peach and mango flavors through the middle and a grapefruit bitter finish.  Nice medium mouthfeel, carbonation breaks toward smooth at the finish where it gets crisp and semi dry.  Honestly, one of the best beers I've ever had.  Big hop flavors, great look and feel and a to die for aroma.","HopBomb515","Sep 12, 2014"

Beautiful hazy yellow pour, and a taste than more than matches the nose. I guess there are not enough reviews to make this a top 250 beer but imo it's an absolute top tier dipa. Beer should be rated 100. Also very cool vibe at the brewery.","hoagzzz","Aug 29, 2014"

Second Fiddle came out on top with a rating of 5.0. Two of us feel it  is the best IPA out there. Scream came in a solid second at 4.5. It was a surprise to all three of us because we had not had it before. Great nose, nice color, great taste. Very Solid. Anti-Hero was well liked by all three of us and came in at 4.25. Gandhi-Bot also came in at 4.25, however it did not have the WOW factor. But Fiddleheads second offering Mastermind did not quite live up to our hopes; a little weak.","ricknelson","Aug 24, 2014"

Big hop flavors up front rounded by a semi-sweet malt profile that comes off as soft yet clean and easy drinking. A hint of honey. The hop profile is dominated by grass, orange peel and floral notes and finishes with a big bitter grapefruit pith finish. Medium body with a creamy mouthfeel. Overall it's an outstanding IPA although it's a little sweet and a little too bitter on the finish for my taste.","brianmandell","Aug 14, 2014"

4.4,0,4.25,4.75,4.25,4,4.5,"A hazy dark gold in color with a thick and frothy head that laces like crazy during the session. The smell is powerfully hoppy with both Christmas tree pine and tropical citrus fruit coming out with the most aggression. Looking for more in the smell I do find a bit of caramel malt relatively mild and completely overshadowed by the hops. So the taste has a bit of the malt too but again that is completely overridden by the hops which are totally the focus here. Big and brash full of flavor and quite bitter. Most of the flavors are citrusy and piney a great mix of the two that manage to compliment each other nicely. The body of this beer is probably in the middle of the range but carbonation is high which makes it quite lively in the mouth. This is also quite a strong beer but the alcohol remains well hidden through nearly the entire session but a nice warming characteristic does develop as the beer warms. Overall this is a first class beer a really great example of the style and one that I've got to get some more of.","fank2788","Jun 26, 2014"

It lacks a bit in the aroma department but only when compared to super melony beers like Lunch and Heady. The taste is all citrus and a hint of bitter with lots of bubbles and crispness. Overall, I wish I could get this daily.","mjstacker","Jun 26, 2014"

Perhaps that's what the brewers were going for given the theme? While I doubt this was brewed with lactic sugar, it definitely feels that way, and regardless, the hop profile melded with the base malts goes so well that it's impossible to deny that this is a serious force in the hoppy beer realm in the US. Deliciously stunning stuff, and highly recommended - as fresh as possible!","magictacosinus","Jun 14, 2014"

The appearance was a nice yellow, but the smell took me back when I gave it a sniff. Lots of grapefruit, mint, and orange peel came through. The taste was a great amount of bitterness paired with a semi-sweet finish that made for a nice refreshing taste but kept a nice aftertaste. Intense but not abrasive. Would definitely recommend for hop heads and IPA lovers.","WhiteHillsStore","Apr 29, 2014"

This beer does well at 8.8% and seems to be an anomaly. A firmly East Coast IPA with some West Coast flavor. Like Biggie let Tupac spit a few lines on a track. Great beer.","jbwimer","Apr 22, 2014"

Smell is not over powering. Getting some pine and maybe lemon, with some slight caramel. Light carbonation and very creamy on the first sip. Definitely pine and grass up front, a little bit of citrus to follow. Aftertaste of pine and lemon, very nice. Nicely balanced with a nice little hop bite at the end that sticks around on the tongue for a while.

It's a beautiful orangy DIPA with a thick white head and lots of hops/exotic fruit coming off the nose. The part that just doesn't hold up for me in this brew is as it warms... the hops get really abrasive. Other DIPAs I've had are definitely better on the back end. In fact, I've drain-poured because of the aftertaste -- it can be amazingly harsh/bad sometimes. Otherwise, it's still an amazing brew for the first three quarters. I would definitely be willing to trade if anyone is searching for it.","shigg85","Nov 23, 2013"

In body, the beer is clean of particles, but very hazy and nearly opaque. On the nose, this beer is big and beautiful. Pine needles, pinecones and sweet mango juice mingle with dank and spicy weed, grapefruit rind, and soft alcohol notes. From the can, the nose is just about the same with just a touch more roundness coming from the citric scents and less of the alcohol burning the nostrils. On the tongue, the beer tastes hugely and properly bitter with resinous pine sap sticking to the tongue. Sweet hops, alcohol, and light bread malt mingle with citric acidity to make up the side show. The finish is dry with only slight sticky sweetness lingering. On the tongue, the beer is medium bodied, with fluffy carbonation that gives velvet softness to the mouthfeel. The mouth is left sticky with resin and bitter tingling, the palate is wrecked. From the can, the beer feels slightly crisper. In flavor, the beer tastes of resinous pine, sweet mango, light pineapple, grapefruit, and apricot. Distinct fresh hop flavors bubble on the tongue and feel sticky and very resinous. The taste has a strong backbone of medicinal bitters. Mmm. A bit sickly sweet, but not too much so. The cloying alcohol seems most present in the finish which also features dry cracker malts at the very base of my senses and strong piney hops. Overall, this is a damn good double IPA. It would be excellent on a late summer afternoon. Great bitters, great hop character, and a great effect on the tongue. The alcohol is just a tad too much, but other than that I like this beer a lot.","Maxwell","Oct 16, 2013"

Would I take Heady over this? Yeah, definitely. But I can’t get Heady at my local shops. But would I take Gandhi-Bot over at least 90% of other DIPAs available to me in my market? Yes, yes I would. And, my girlfriend loves this beer—that’s called a win-win, motherfucker.

It's complemented by a nice sweet malt presence that doesn't back down. So it's both balanced and unbalanced in that sense. I'm impressed with how strong the components of this beer are. I'm not a huge, huge fan of the über bitter DIPAs but as far as they go, this is a very good one; it may well be the east coast version of Abrasive. (4.25)","Stevedore","May 27, 2013"

Sweet citrus hop aroma with plenty of earthy notes and a subtle malt presence. There’s some grassy pine needle and dank hop oils but the tropical/citrus fruits are most prominent in the nose. Lots of mango, grapefruit and citrus rind along with subtle biscuit in the flavors. Medium bodied with a complex, flavorful hop profile that is nicely balanced by a sweet malt backbone. Bitter and sweet notes play off of each other with hints of dry and bitter pine countered by notes of grapefruit and orange. The malt backbone adds sweetness with notes of caramel, toffee and biscuit without getting in the way of the hops. Overall, a well-balanced brew and very flavorful with a well-masked ABV making it dangerously drinkable.","CuriousMonk","May 23, 2013"

Nice hoppy aroma, citrus, pine, tropical fruit, light floral notes, some malty sweetness detectable. Again in the taste, lots of hops, orange, grapefruit, pine, pineapple, sweet malt base with a touch of honey and/or orange blossom in there. Definitely had a bitter bite to it, but the sweetness took a bit of the edge off, and it was pretty smooth for an 8.8% beer.

Gandhi joins the likes of Heady Topper and many of Hill's IPAs as some of the best-done IPAs in my book. I was astonished to learn that NEBCO has been in my former back yard for years and even more astonished that good old Connecticut could produce a DIPA to rival those of the Green Mountain State.

4.24,-3.6,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,4.5,"one of the most drinkable double ipas ive ever encountered. thanks to a wonderful trade with thebrewo, I got to enjoy two cans of this bad boy. the pour on it is tinted red, orange, and bronze, with some small yeast floaters and an amazing bone white head that rises three inches high and holds up well above the rim of my glass. the nose is fresh oily hops, high alpha, fruity and juicy, citrus and pine both, only mildly bitter. there is a decent coppery malt balance, but hops are of course the star of this beer. the taste is a lot like the nose, with a very fruity and complex hop arrangement. I would love to know which varietals are used, but I can say that there is a hefty tropical fruit element, its pineapple or tartish passion fruit. a little bitterness creeps into the finish, but not enough to slow down its drinkability at all. love the feel too, fuller bodied but kept swift by its lively carbonation. super creamy, and less sticky and filling than many other beers of this style. I had two cans back to back, and was only done because I didn't have any more. im not sure if this comes in 4s or 6s or what, but I could drink these forever. its amazingly fresh and refreshing at the same time, unlike a lot of big india pale ales. thanks to thebrewo for hooking this up, its one ive been hunting for some time now, and it surpasses even its hype. bomb!","StonedTrippin","Apr 13, 2013"
4.14,-5.9,3.25,4.75,4,4,4,"O-This beer is all about the hops. The incredibly aromatic hops deliver the right amount of bitterness that is balanced in part by the malt and in part by the alcohol. Overall, this very smooth beer is definitely worth a try and would likely put up a decent fight against even your favorite double/imperial IPAs. I would definitely try this again.","ElijahRivera","Apr 13, 2013"

HUGE floral hop bouquet in the nose, very sweet, floral, citrusy, pineapple, grapefruit. an excellent balnce of hop profiles.. west coast piney meets the citrusy grapefruit, with a pile on of northeast floral ipa style.. backed by a heavy sweet malt profile. this is up there with pliny, flower power, and heady. a resinous bitterness lingers for quite some time. the medium body pour is easy to drink due to the hops overpowering the booze flavor. low carbonation and a sticky feeling left behind, this is one of the better dipas i've had. nice and bitter.","facundoCNB","Apr 09, 2013"

The hops on the nose are just so sticky, fruity, and sweet, yet so bittered, herbal, and earthy. These mix with the perfect level of bittered pales, caramel, and bubblegum. This beer is actually a nice change for the style, as many tend to overwhelm the beer with doubling a certain ingredient, thus tipping the balance out of favor. Here, the balance remains through both the aroma and the flavoring, leaving us with a tasty, easily drinkable treat from the beer-quiet state of Connecticut.","TheBrewo","Apr 07, 2013"

4.15,-5.7,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"The beer aerates while gushing from its 12oz can into my DFH goblet. It has a slightly hazy, pale golden body with 2 inches of white head that fades quickly. As the head settles, there is a respectable amount of inner-glass lacing and head retention. The beer's nose is quite citrusy and sweet, but the alcohol is modest and well disguised. The taste is quite excellent with a wide spectrum of hop flavors including a bold citrus, grape, pine, and tropical fruits. The mouthfeel is a little bit too hop forward and bitter (could have used more sweetness for balance), but isn't over-extending its welcome. Overall this beer is a sipper, with a huge hop profile and alcohol content to keep you easily satisfied. I'd love to try this beer again in the future, but many more DIPAs are better.","ThePorterSorter","Aug 17, 2012"

Plenty of mango, pineapple, and sugary caramel mid-palate. The hops become more citrus-y and grapefruity toward the dry finish. Lingering orange, caramel, and resinous bitterness. Medium-full body with a nice, creamy feel. One of the better East coast DIPAs I have had the pleasure of trying.

I've had a lot of DIPAs, and I'd say this probably ranks right behind Heady Topper and HF's Abner (which were both two of the best beers I've had period). If you can get some fresh definitely pick some up. Like any great DIPA, this should only be drank fresh.

The aroma speaks of lemon-grapefruit and a pleasant caramel base. Very nice. The flavor brings lots more citrus bite and cramel sweetness. This approaches being cloying with a medium-heavy body and somewhat viscous feel. The hops are the theme here but it does carry some hints of cereal grain with the caramel sweetness. But let’s just call a spade a spade, it’s just a hop lovers retreat. Love it, tap or can, one of my favorites for a hop fix.","Durge","Apr 12, 2012"

A nice balanced hop, with again, a very light citrus presence. This is an easy drinker. The 8.8 is barely noticeable at all. The mouthfeel might be my favorite part of this beer. For a DIPA, it's not a tongue scorcher. You don't get the sense of getting burned out on this. It lays nicely upon your tongue, and has but only the slightest lingering bitter aftertaste.

The high alcohol would keep me from having too much of this bad boy, but I'd have no problem putting away 75% of a four pack. I'm just not sure how I'd feel. Brilliant hop character in this one that adds a compatible pine note to the pineapple. Very solid beer that is a worthy mention in style, just be sure you don't overdose on this monster incognito.

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, citrus, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, sweet alcohol, citrus, and citrus hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a damn tasty brew. Very well balanced flavor going on here with a great aroma as well. The CAN really delivered on this one! Maybe this is why Woody is on the CAN Quest... Only thing this brew is lacking is appearance, but who cares when it tastes and smells that good (and no, that's not a 'that's what she said' joke)... Get your hands on this one!

So hoppy and such a fruity sweetness to balance it out. This DIPA fresh is tough to beat. Pliny and Topper are the only beers off hand that I can think of that rival it. I absolutely love the hop profile of this beer. The alcohol is completely hidden and a clean smooth feel would be an understatement. Love having this brewery in my state. The only thing I can think of that distinguishes this beer on tap from the can is the ever so slight freshness of the hops and carbonation is dead on.

The smell is a mixture of piny hops and lemon zest, it's rather nice but still not strong enough to be in the realm of a bouquet. The taste is aggressively hoppy. The front end is a nice sweet floral taste, but quickly degrades into a bitter film left on the tongue. It's a pretty drinkable IPA, but I must admit that it does truly have some bigger flaws.

If it were sold closer to me, I'd make it an essential to have in the fridge at all times...Into an oversize wine glass, it pours a dull and dense foggy grapefruit-orange color and carries an aroma of crisp sweet grapefruit citrus and orange rind zest. From open to finish, this packs a mega punch of hops that elegantly ravages the palate with citrus bitterness and leaves your mouth feeling like what I can best compare to as the same mouth coating numbness you'd experience after eating a fresh whole small grapefruit. Though this seems a little extreme, I warn you. This is an Imperial IPA that will quickly make great friends with your palate after smothering it and sneaking its a.b.v. in through the back window. Thus, it also becomes dangerously smooth. So hopheads, REJOICE!","albertjr21","Dec 05, 2010"

Nice, tropical fruit aroma, mostly pineapple and orange, light grapefruit, and a mustiness from the yeast. Taste is very nice, not overly bitter. Good dose of citrus, pale malts give a cracker-like quality, lightly sweet, and again, yeasty. Flavor seems to be a bit light for a double IPA, but I'm glad it's not ridiculously bitter. Body is below medium, and carbonation is very light. Overall, it's well balanced and pretty drinkable, just wish I had known there was this much sediment in the bottom so I could have kept it out of my glass.

The room was now like a grapefruit tree stand. Color was a cloudy yellowish-orange, like fresh-squeezed grapefruit. My hops jones was starting to reappear today and I was not sure that it was welcome. Mouthfeel was medium and the grapefruit taste was intense, but it was not as abrasive as another DIPA from earlier this day. As a matter of fact, this was hoppy, certainly, on the tongue, but relatively unassertive in terms of its bitterness. I was liking this from the outset. The finish was zesty, like orange zest intermingled with caramel. Think one of those Brach's Orange Caramels that they may not even make any more. I remember them well as one ripped a filling out, much to my mother's chagrin and anger. This made me feel good about myself, just like stopping the lashings, even for a moment.

Bitter pine hops bombard my pallet and finish nicely with a decent malt profile and citrus finish. Again, just not what I expected.

The beer itself pours a hazy tawny orange with a solid finger of light ecru foam on top, which dies away after a short while to a mere single layer of bubbles languishing on the surface. The nose comprises a sharp pine, grass, a bit of wet hay, and plenty o' citrus peel. Some vague, dark sweetness pervades the background. The taste is quite similar, with the pine and citrus rocking full bore (who'da thunk hops being strong in a DIPA?), carousing with dark greens and a solid mass of toffee. The body is a strong medium, with active, though still moderate, carbonation and a somewhat chewy feel. It's like a light syrup that somehow wastes away into a watery purgatory. Whatever that means.

The taste is a bit of a letdown though, as there's a bit too much generic hop bitterness as opposed to specific hop flavors. The malt is noticeable, but just barely. The beer is adequately carbonated, without being particularly impressive either. I wanted to give drinkability a 3 because of the overly present bitterness to the taste, but NEBC did a great job of hiding the alcohol here so I'll kick it up a little bit.

At first, and take this as you will, it reminds me of Gubna, except much less intense and more drinkable. But some very nice tropical fruit notes seem to take over towards the middle and really gives the taste a huge boost. Nice bitterness too, the 85 IBU's are definitely noticeable.

The hoppy aroma, is somewhat musty, but with some pineapple and pine in there as well. Taste is all of dank, resiny pine like hops. It also feels like much more than 85 IBUs, but I am not going to complain or judge. Mouthfeel is medium, juicy at first, and ends on a bitter earth note. I will have no trouble finishing off the four pack, so drinkability is good for me. Final thoughts are that this is a hop lovers kind if beer. It drinks like a straight up IPA, with the ABV behind it to make it imperial.

4,-9.1,4,4,4,4,4,"16oz. can served at 50 degrees in my DT tulip. Poured a semi-translucent burnt orange with a one inch, creamy white head. Head eventually dissipates into a fairly consistent skim of a cap that coalesces around the shoulders. Delicate, concentric rings of lacing are exposed during the tasting. Nose expresses sweet grapefruit initially, with a hint of medicinal hoppiness at the back - perhaps a toasted quality in the mix as well. Taste reveals a citrus quality, without the sweetness. Some herbal/medicinal hops bitterness comes out right after the start and carries through to the latter half. Toasted quality also carries over from the nose, with the addition of a hint of caramel, before finally culminating in a lightly lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, with an assertive carbonation that falls just shy of prickly and finishes fairly dry. Ghandi-Bot is an exceptional DIPA with a well-hidden abv. My preference for the style tends to migrate more towards the sweeter end of the spectrum, but this is a solid brew. You won't be disappointed.","Jwale73","Apr 30, 2010"

The bitterness overwhelms the citrus leaving a strong bitter flavor, though not too resiny. Some of that sweet malt balances the brew but I will have to acclimate to the bitterness before I can proceed. At 8.8%, the alcohol is much better hidden than some other IIPAs but not totally disguised. Wow, I can't shake the bitter! As it warms, some of the citrus and alcohol come out.

4.22,-4.1,4,4.5,4,5,4,"Pours out a deep copper color, bordering almost on red, nice clarity, decent sized head, which makes for a nice looking beer. The smell has a nice floral hoppiness. Some resinous fruit is in there too. I get pine and grass, leaves (maybe green tea leaves) and pollen, smells strongly of hop flowers, with some powdery grainy smells. Very nice, I remember breathing it with the glass in front of me and reminding me of smelling blooming flowers. The taste comes out with this dry pine and grass flavor, with a kick of sticky bread in the end. You get tastes of citrus rind, orange peel and lemon juice. Still some leafiness - this to me isn't the fruitiest DIPA, but they don't all have to be. The finish comes back with dryness and leafiness, nice and resinous. The feeling is very nice, sticky and big, but not viscous and syrupy. Really nice in that aspect. The carbonation was lively and enjoyable, made this one easy to drink. The drinkability is good, not too potent, but a nice kick. I wanted a little more (too bad I was splitting it with like 4 people), but really glad to have tried it.","taylorhamrick","Beers"

4.53,3,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"have since had it in both growlers and cans and it is a little less of a bitter bomb in the aftertaste, but still super delicious. The cans are particularly good for keeping it fresh. Love the 16oz tallboys.--> the updated rating is from the can version","modernartblues","0"
