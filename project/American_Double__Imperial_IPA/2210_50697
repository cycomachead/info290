The aroma of sweet hops fills the glass.  The taste is smooth and hoppy and a bit sweet and the 9.5% ABV can only be detected by the warming sensation in your belly.

Pours clear medium dark golden amber with 1" off-white head that lingers and leaves lots of lacing. Very clean tasting. Lots of hop bitterness is balanced excellently with the caramel malt flavor. Because of it’s hop/malt balance and ability to hide it’s 9.5% ABV, this is a very drinkable DIPA. I really enjoyed this one.","Grainius","Mar 08, 2015"

It poured a crimson gold color with an off-white head that leaves excellent lacing on the glass. The nose featured aromas of oranges, lemon, dank citrus hops, and hints of strong pine. The mouth has a medium-plus feel with a velvety finish, accompanied by flavors of citrus, pineapple, pine, and pale malt sweetness - which makes this brew a cohesive winner. This is definitely a classic DIPA in my books. Pick one up next time you see one, you won't be disappointed. 95/100 @firestonewalker","thebeerfrontier","Jan 24, 2015"

That's too far, of course, but compared to other double IPAs I have enjoyed, this was not even in the top twenty. Perhaps it has to do with the attenuation of the yeast, but there was not enough malt sweetness to counterbalance the hops in this monster.","B-J-B","Dec 11, 2014"

A nice foamy white head that lasts a while. Like I said, huge aroma. Tons of pine, mango, and citrus. Maybe a little alcohol. Taste follows the nose with a nice malt backbone. This is a perfectly balanced DIPA. Alcohol barely makes its presence known. There's no way to tell this is a 9.5% beer until you're halfway done and already feeling buzzed. Mouthfeel is a little thick, but still amazing for a DIPA. Overall, unbelievable. I had this about a year ago and loved it, but coming back I love it even more. This is probably the most overlooked DIPA of the west coast and rivals the likes of Pliny, Sucks, and Enjoy By, and is more readily available.","MisSigsFan","Oct 03, 2014"

Finishes with a sweet caramel malt, yeast flavor and some good moderate citrus grapefruit hops bitterness on the end for balance.

Early on the hops smell is a little overpowering until the malt comes through to join it, and the resulting taste is a wonderful blend of caramel malt and tropical fruits, mainly pineapple. Extremely well balanced, easy to drink, and has something that appeals to the English ale drinker in me.","diablo14","Sep 25, 2014"

The alcohol is only present in the aroma, so this ale could get you in trouble. The modest bitterness is refreshing for a big beer like this. Is this an earthshattering DIPA? No, yet it holds it’s own in the West Coast Style. Recommended.","Shroud0fdoom","Sep 01, 2014"

I then took in an intense aroma of tropical fruit, oranges, watermelon and slight grapefruit. The scent takes on even more characteristics of floral dankness, sweet caramel and bitter Lupilin. It was then no surprise that this  has an intense and pungent flavor. It starts amazingly fruity with tropical fruit punch, watermelon, lemon, oranges and mango. The middle is sweet, lightly malty, with honey and caramel. It ends bitter and dry. FW lives up to the hype.","KYGunner","Aug 22, 2014"

I'll be needing to pick up a few more of their beers next time I'm at the store. I was a little hesitant going into these Double IPAs thinking they might annihilate my palate, but so far they have been awesome! Slowly becoming more and more of a fan.","REGreenBTRB","Aug 03, 2014"

Good as a sipping and savoring beer, but I think it would be good with a meal as well, but something this notable in flavor might be hard to pair with so the nice flavors of this beer don't get lost. While expensive, this beer is worth it, and I think I need to try this one again either fresh on tap or with an earlier bottling to see if I can capture even more of the hop aroma that this beer has in abundance.","damndirtyape","Jul 06, 2014"

There are some subtle flavors on the front end but drinks smooth for a beer with 9.5%. Everybody has their favorites but, IMO, this deserved the great reviews its gotten. It's probably the most expensive 4-pack I've bought, but it drinks like a champ so its worth the extra $$.","Eddiehop","Jun 27, 2014"

The grapefruit nose comes out if you let it warm up a bit. Flavor is delicious malt, floral hops, and a little caramel. This is a well balanced ale with delightful bitterness--not too much. Mouth feel is medium, with a little creaminess. Overall the is an outstanding ale, thoroughly enjoyable.","Dsimenson","Jun 18, 2014"

It pours a orange copper hue with a small white head that leaves decent lacing and film and has beautiful slick legs. The nose is hoppy with lots of pine, floral, and grapefruit notes as well as a nice malty presence. Very balanced and fresh smelling. The mouthfeel is super smooth and very pleasantly sticky. Carbonation level is just right. The flavor is an incredible balance of fresh west coast hops and malt sweetness. Nicely bitter but very balanced and easy to drink. Abv is almost completely hidden. This is one of the finest dipas that I have ever had. Hope to get some more down the road. Well done!","lochef81","May 30, 2014"

Taste is sweet and caramel-like upfront, before yielding to pineapple fruit and bubblegum, with a good amount of yeast and florals here and there. F inishes like a compost pile of grass clippings and day-old orange peels. Nicely carbonated body keeps it all alive and aloft.

Smell is of sharp citrus (grapefruit), piney resin and alcohol. Taste is sharp bitter hops, some floral notes, a malt backbone and a warming alcohol aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a bit sticky with moderate carbonation and coats the tongue quickly. The finish is bitter and dry, reminding me of very dry white wine. The alcohol was initially a bit too pronounced for my liking. About halfway through the glass my palette got used to this beer and I enjoyed its characteristics more.","xungmound98","Apr 02, 2014"

The bitterness comes thru in the first sip, with a bit of funk. The taste was malty - sweet with some alcohol burn. Overall, there are more complex doubles out there, I'd say this is OK, but maybe not unique enough to be outstanding.","WOBrewstraveler","Mar 28, 2014"

The group of 7 were divided evenly, 2 that favored IPA's, 2 that favored belgians, and 3 that favored Stouts. It actually scored highest with one taster, and low with two other tasters. Unfortunately this beer was too old to properly judge. It should have been a lot fresher in all fairness.","ricknelson","Mar 26, 2014"

My best of the day was Bourbon County Barleywine and this came in a close second. Even though I never heard of this before, the rating refelcetd in their menu was like a challenge; I had to try it. BLUF: It was every bit as good as the near-perfect rating it had; it was nice to see, felt wonderful and tasted like a fresh Sculpin should. This really was a great day for drinking...","Mdez","Feb 08, 2014"

The tremendous hop aroma (grapefruit and pine dominate) is balanced perfectly with the light malty foundation and the strong alcohol. This beer leaves you wanting another and another...until you realize just how strong it is. Best beer I've ever had.","Beer-May","Feb 05, 2014"

The only year round DIPA offering like this one we get is Hop Stoopid which funny enough reminds me of this one in flavor. I guess if I could criticize this one I'd have to say that it's a bit too bitter for what I desire in a DIPA but I know this is a West Coast beer so I expect it.","PaulyB83","Feb 03, 2014"

Carbonation is high, smell is nice and this beer goes down well. It's a nice beer for someone who is scared off by dark beers.

The aroma was layered beautifully, and the flavors were nicely balanced despite all the different things going on. It went from truly super sweet to truly super bitter. The aroma, flavors, and mouthfeel played together wonderfully, offering almost everything a hop-head like me looks for. This one was a roller coaster ride. A+","tmm313","Jan 03, 2014"

Flavor shape-shifts a bit even as it warms, retaining the character but inviting your palate to discern new and previously unknown taste traits. 9.5% ABV is barely perceptible. Sneaks up on you nicely. Try to keep a bomber in the home at all times. Go Firestone!","shacawgo24","Nov 22, 2013"

Clear but darker amber color than you would expect. Sniff the bottle again and the fruit aromas are stronger and linger while you savor your beer. Doesn't have the metallic bite that i often experience with IPAs. Fills your mouth without draining it of saliva. Almost dessert like. Not heavy or filling though. Powerful. Little to no after taste. Went well with some a crab cake sandwich.","uvachief","Nov 08, 2013"

The aroma is incredibly strong, and you can smell the sweet citrus and pine sap without even holding the glass near your face. You start to think that the flavor cannot possible live up the promise that the aroma has made. But it does, to an extent. It's not EXACTLY the flavor that the nose indicated (that would be unfair), but it's damn close. It's almost sticky on your palate. The flavors are almost thick. It's difficult to describe, but it's unlike any other DIPA I've had. When I compare it to some of the DIPA benchmarks like Pliny and Heady Topper, I start to wonder how this is not mentioned on the same level. Is it because of its availability? Let's put it this way.. If faced with having to sniff out some Pliny or pick this up at a good bottle shop, I'd buy this in a second, and wouldn't miss the Pliny one bit.","dwagner003","Nov 02, 2013"

Overall, I am very impressed with this beer, but, at about 6 months old, I have to wonder how much better it could have been had it been bottled more recently. I do love that fruit like beginning, soft biscuity center and creeping massive bitterness for the climax though. Obviously try this.","Neorebel","Aug 20, 2013"

What is notable about this DIPA is the heavy-duty malt backbone of this beer. You don't really get DIPAs with that nice complex maltiness. I loved it, quite a bit of a departure from current trends. Almost a bit veering towards amber colored. FInished well, good malt stickiness to finish. Pleasant alcohol level. Hops were good and American, classic American hop flavors, citrus, pine, resin, grapefruit-overall classic American flavor.","Reneejane","Aug 14, 2013"

This one is resiny tasty and smooth and amazingly well covers 9.5 ABV, but the hops are not bomblike.  Based on this I would lower ratings for look, taste and overall while raising mouthfeel, but given the age on this bottle I don't think it would be fair.  Will be on the hunt for fresher, hopefully less than a month old, before making any such changes.","scotorum","Jul 06, 2013"

I'm always slightly put off by the $8 bomber, but never disappointed once I've got it in my possession. I will continue to drink this -- it's one of the best easily obtainable DIPAs out there. It is a little bit one dimensional and is unapologetic about it, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.","jdhowe","Jun 17, 2013"

The head is thin and fades. Fruity aroma earns big points. But ultimately the flavor rules. Nice apricot sweetness, smooth, and a slight bitter in the aftertaste only. Very good double IPA by any standard. A define must try if you like this type of beer. Good introduction to double IPAs, but do not expect them all to be this good!","iSip","May 15, 2013"

Smells of tropical fruits, pine, and caramel. Taste is juicy blackberries, peaches, citrus and pine. Alcohol is well hidden and not overly sweet for a DIPA - well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium, sticky finish begs for the next sip. Overall a fantastic DIPA and one that is very welcome in Texas.","coldriver","Mar 31, 2013"

The carbonation cascades as if a stout while the minimally hazy orange liquid pools beneath gravity's grip. Nose is blunt: bold citrus with floral over/unders. Mouthfeel is bubbly, yet smooth. Tastes like grapefruit rind. Bitter citrus: mission accomplished. Surprisingly sessionable for a 9.5%. No percent boozy. Anyone have a filleted flounder I can eat?","Rast","Mar 24, 2013"

Smell is sweet flowers mostly; hops and pine are less prominent. Taste is bitter on the tongue, but mostly sweet malts upon swallowing, and then the hoppy bitterness comes at the finish, lingering nicely. Alcohol is not very noticeable and blends into the hop flavor; it's a good thing this comes in single bombers instead of 6 packs. Mouthfeel is as expected, crisp but a fuller body than the taste would suggest. Overall not the best DIPA I've had, but certainly a good one and one I'd pick up again.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Jan 20, 2013"

I suspect this is more or less what the brewers were after, and it's a good beer. If it cost as much as other DIPA bombers I probably wouldn't get it much, but since if was $3-4 less than other bombers where I live, I could see revisiting this one now and again.","sprucetip","Nov 08, 2012"

I can't decide what hop flavors are most dominant between floral (mostly in the aroma), citrus, and pine. Well balanced, complex, and pretty much just what I think of when I think of the DIPA style.

The beer is hazy and pretty opaque but really beautifully coppered. The beer smells big and boozy with lovely wet floral hops heavy with pine and hints of citrus and mango. Malt presence isn’t really apparent in the smell but there is a good alcoholic bite that suggests the 9.5%. The beer tastes wonderfully of citrus pine hops and nice light backbone of sweet pale malts, though there is a staled medicinal septic taste around the sides and it lingers in the mouth. Perhaps that is the aspirin taste that some reviewers are found of referencing. The afterburst of fruity hops after the swallow is fantastic and tropical, bringing to mind mangoes, pineapples, oranges, and grapefruits (all the appropriate hop-fruit analogs!). The alcohol is well hidden in the taste with just a nice warming as it goes down the gullet and a slight bite as the beer first touches the mouth. Mouthfeel is smooth with a slight bite from the carbonation at the beginning that swiftly mellows out to leave the tongue cloying with sweet bitters and slightly oozing with saliva. The sides of the mouth feel strangely dry considering how wet the tongue feels. Overall this is a great DIPA. It’s a little unbalance with a ton of terrific hops but not enough malt to cut back on the medicinal bitter sting, but it still tastes great that hide all but a ghost of the 9.5% alcohol. Plus who can complain about more hop flavor? Great hops in this beer.","Maxwell","Aug 12, 2012"

I have had it many times in the bottle and many times on draft. It is a beer that is sensitive to age as many of the IPA s are and if mistreated will begin to show its fruity side quickly. The ability of what seems to be mostly west coast brewers to make a balanced IPA at 9.5% without any significant alcohol sweetness amazes me and I wish east coast brewers could match the taste.I really would prefer less alcohol but its stablemate, Union Jack is not hoppy or bitter enough for my palate although still another excellent beer.","ETCO2","Jun 19, 2012"

A wonderfully hoppy aroma with some pine and orange in the front and some sweet tropical fruits, peach and a little malt coming in the back. As it warms, the sweet, fruity side of the aroma takes over. Flavor mimics the aroma quite well with a medium level bitterness to it. A crisp mouthfeel with some activity Lacking any creaminess or silkiness to it though. Overall, one of those beers I have forever wanted to try but always chose something else instead when at the store. Better late than never I suppose, this is a very nice beer from Firestone like I expected it to be.","denver10","May 20, 2012"

If I needed to draw a comparison, it is eerily similar to that of Lagunitas' Imperial Red in appearance, aroma but with a slightly higher bitter/dry finish. At almost $8 for a 22oz bottle, I would choose the Lagunitas offering simply for the value factor. However, if you have yet to sample Double Jack, do yourself a favor and treat yourself to at least one.","threeviews","Apr 19, 2012"

Just a knockout in the looks department, couldn't be more inviting. If you don't think a beer's appearance means much, just take a look at how this one compares to other DIPAs, many of which are notably hazier. Smells of resinous pine, somewhat floral and a little catty. There's some breadiness and malty sweetness on the nose too. Mmhmm. Taste hits with initial perfect balance, the hop flavor presents itself and vamps for a bit before the bitterness takes center stage and the brew dries out real hard. Bitterness just hangs and hangs, lovely. Taste-wise, you'd never know this beer rocks a 9.5 abv, totally stashed behind a malt decoy and a great wall of hops. Pleasantly medium bodied, a bit viscous and sticky, could maybe use just a touch more carbonation. All in all, an absolute work of art. It is easy to become jaded in a world where we've been handed big bold imperial IPAs for several years, but Double Jack manages to make a unique mark. I've had almost nothing in this style that I haven't enjoyed; remembering one among the rest doesn't always happen, and it does with this example. Not to be missed.","kc44","Mar 27, 2012"

There's a soft sweetness from start to finish. It tastes floral at first, but the bitterness turns to citrus by the finish.

The flavor follows with a building a sweet (at first) grapefruit hit which dries out with floral notes and that same pine resin. I love that this beer is really no heavier than a normal IPA.

The appearance is a light golden amber with a white frothy head, which recedes to cling around the glass without much surface lacing. A little more translucent than I would expect for a DIPA. The aroma is crazy, I am confused but I like it at the same time. You get the standard hop floral notes, pine and citrus, but there is something very unique about this brew. I read another review that described a "sweaty" characteristic, and I laughed because that's the best way I can describe it - like an earthy, sweaty smell. The flavor is bold but balanced, the bitterness of the hop character offset by the background malty sweetness. I don't know what combo of hops they used (I think I taste Simcoe in there) but whatever it is works great. The mouthfeel is very smooth, the abv is well hidden and just the right amount of carb, a nice followup to a balanced DIPA like this. Easily one of the best of this style out there.","Iceman77","Feb 17, 2012"

4.38,0.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O - A very good DIPA that leans on the hoppier side of the style, which isn't a bad thing at all. It brings a strong hop presence but has just enough malty sweetness to balance the beer overall. This is one of those beers where everything about it is good and there are no clear opportunities for improvement, yet it has nothing about it that screams phenomenal.

Taste follows the nose bursting with tropical fruit and citrus, tangerine, lemon, orange, lightly sweet malt rolls in around the middle, more tropical fruit flavours in the finish as well, just bitter enough. Oily, medium carbonation, medium-full body and quite slick. I really enjoyed this really drinkable stuff, solid DIPA, was told that this was purchased a while back but its so well made that the freshness wasn't an issue for me, could this be even more fruity when fresh? I know i will look for this next time i'm in the states though.","peensteen","Jan 11, 2012"
4,-7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a clear orange, with a transient white head. A light film and a tight collar retain atop this. Bright hops and citrus notes in the nose, floral with even a bit of tropical fruit suggestions. Lots of orange and tangerine really. Good malt character, I got a lot of caramel and toffee like sweetness. Taste is similar, chewy orange and tangerine notes with again, some tropical fruit leanings. Lots of malt in a sticky and sweet fashion, sets a good base for this beer. Profile isn't incredibly complex, but it's quite effective. Heavy medium mouthfeel, good chewiness and a moderate bitterness. Not the best freshness on this bottle I'd gather, bit the taste is well retained. I've love to revisit this fresher.","liamt07","Jan 11, 2012"

3.97,-8.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours orange-copper with a medium head. Great floral hop aroma -- citrus and pine. Taste is the same floral hops with a nice, balanced malt backbone. The pine flavor (and an almost earthy flavor too) comes out even more as the beer warms up. Smooth, drinkable mouthfeel, maybe a little sticky at times but that's understandable given the malts needed to balance the strong hop flavor. All around, a very solid DIPA.","scout","Nov 13, 2011"

The aroma offers some malty sweetness, as well as some hop and citrus notes. The flavor brings forth a huge helping of malt and candied oranges. Strong. Hop presence is there as well, of course, but the flavor seems dominated by malt, candied oranges, and a sweet presence throughout. Thick in body, even a bit syrupy.

Big big hop presence on the tongue, subtle wet hops though not aggrresive at all. Sweet fruity taste and feel, extremely smooth and delicious, finishes with a semi bitter alcohol warming .

Loads of hop-derived citrus aromas dominate the smell. Orange peel and fresh grapefruit. Herbal, resiny, and fresh-smelling. The taste is intense and exceedingly well balanced. The first note is of the hop bitterness....it's a biting sensation...followed by an agressive alcohol warming and a deep malt flavor. Pale malts...no real roasted character...bread and toast. The hops are showcased in this beer, amazingly hoppy. The body is solid. This is not a beer to be taken lightly.","Suds","Sep 24, 2011"

4.5,3.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall - This is a huge surprise in terms of a double IPA, and well worth a try. It’s lighter than most DIPAs in all aspects - the sunny color, the high citrus/low resin nose, and the expertly hidden 9.5% ABV. It may lack bitterness, but only barely. This doesn’t detract from the pleasure that is the citrus and florals. I think even the most hardcore hophead could enjoy this beer - for what it lacks in bitterness, it makes up for in presence. The hops, bittering and onward, are pervasive and complex.","paperbackfoster","Sep 22, 2011"

4,-7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a great honey color, which was way lighter than I thought this was going to be. There was minimal head, due to a rather careful pour. Because of this, there was really no lacing. A piney and citrus scent is what I got from this, also a honey kind of sweetness as well. Taste is on the citrus side, I'm detecting peach, and orange rind. There is also a resinous hop bitterness to it. Mouthfeel on this one is a bit thick, leaving a hop oil kind if bitterness in my mouth. Its on the moderate side of being carbonated. I'd have to say that this is yet another solid offering from Firestone, definitely something I would get again.","BrewtifulMind","Sep 20, 2011"

Some nice lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of huge orange, grapefruit, pine, caramel, and spices. Beautiful aromas here with big strength, this might be a fairly fresh bottle. Taste of huge caramel, pine, orange, grapefruit, spices, and a bit of tropical fruits. Nice amount of bitterness present on the finish with lingering notes of citrus, caramel, pine, and spices. Fantastic balance of bitterness and sweetness in this, nothing is overwhelming. Alcohol is practically invisible, only a very small warming on the finish noticeable. Medium carbonation and body, with a bit of a prickly and slightly creamy mouthfeel. Very drinkable stuff, I am surprised how easy this is going down at this alcohol level(9.5%).

In the taste, more of the same, bitter hops, pine, resin and honey like malt that adds quite a bit of sweetness. Medium bodied feel and alittle chewey. The balance of this beer can best be described as two opposites meshed together, big time sweetness and tons of citrusy bitter hops.

I liked it a lot, but could not drink too many of these at a sitting (beer fests in ONW excluded, of course).","Hopsedge","Aug 19, 2011"
4.42,1.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"OVERALL: This is a quality Double IPA and with its distribution expanding, especially to the Chicago Area, I think we will start seeing this beer gain more and more traction in the beer community. I'm guessing it will be on the front page of DIPAs on Beer Advocate sometime next year. It is very drinkable and accessible, but still robust and complex enough for a BA to thoroughly enjoy.","StoneTSR","Aug 18, 2011"

Although a bit dated based on FW's recommendations (110 days from bottling) this beer has a nice clear pour with above average carbonation and left a great lacing pattern. Smell maintained good fruit and taste and had an as expected heavy hop profile. Above average malt flavors help to subdue some of the 9.5% alcohol, but tend to leave a long, lingering aftertaste.

It treads the border with "too much" but doesn't quite go over. The flavor is very sweet, balanced by very high bitterness, and a vast quantity of citrus hops.

While Firestone Walker is undoubtedly one of the best Californian breweries, their DIPA comes nowhere close to touching the state's best examples.

4,-7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"The taste follows the nose initially. There are ample yet balanced fruity hops that dash across the palate, they soon switch to a pleasant caramel/biscuity maltiness. The finish returns to hops but more flavorful; they slightly linger/bite the tongue. This is a really hopped beer but not a hop bomb thanks to the balanced maltiness. When I say hoppy, it is a really equally hop flavorful as it is bitter so it avoids being a palate wrecker. This is one of my favorite Double IPAs, so glad FW has finally made it to the east coast.

4.29,-1.2,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, this beer is much lighter than I was expecting. The beer is a amber-tinted gold color, and it carries a massive, frothy, light, big bubbled 3 inch head that eventually breaks up and settles into a managable half inch film. The beer leaves a great lacing along the glass as the head settles, and also while you drink it. The nose is all fresh hops; spicy and resinous, aromatic and green, the hops smell like they were dumped in by a front-end loader. Buried beneath the green, there are a healthy dose of citrus-grapefruit aromas, as well as a light peppering to balance everything out. Much less malty on the aroma than most DIPAs, which is fine by me. The beer's flavors are round and robust initially, with a healthy showing of smokey malt sweetness and presence, quickly cleaned up by the drying and astringent hops presence, both fresh and floral, with a cedar and fresh-cut grass character that overtakes the palate. Aftertaste is where the citrus notes come back into play, helping to cleanse the palate and balance out the strong hoppy display. The finish is remarkably quick compared to the robustness and amount of flavor profiles, and it only slightly dries the mouth, leaving just enough flavor behind to beg for more. Extremely tasty and hoppy beer. Not for the weak of tongue.","GarthDanielson","Jul 08, 2011"
4.38,0.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is a fantastic DIPA - has the rare combination of extreme hop flavor while retaining superior drinkablility. I paid 7.25 for the bomber (near the shore), and it is easily worth every penny.","FickleBeast","Jul 08, 2011"

4.05,-6.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"O: A very solid beer...however. This brew was just lacking a certain "it" factor that I was looking for. Maybe I served it at too cold of a temperature. I'll have to give it a 2nd look and see if it was just me. A solid offering worth trying.","thomcatr3t","Jul 06, 2011"

The taste brings sweet pine hops and more bubblegum juniper just like the aroma suggested. Syrupy and a bit cloying with green bitterness and pineapple edges.

4.57,5.3,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the interplay between the sweet aspects and the bitter aspects of the flavor. While the nose predicted a sugary and juicy brew, the taste followed through with a bit of a changeup. At first there was some nice bitterness, but as the beer warmed and opened up, it gave way to a sweeter, more delicate flavoring. As a whole, this beer maintained simplicity, yet incorporated some complexity in the hop profile, keeping you guessing, and satisfied, throughout.","jwhancher","Jun 28, 2011"

4.33,-0.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"22oz. bottle served in my DT tulip. No dating indicated on the bottle. Pours a pale reddish-orange with a translucent clarity. Head was half an inch, creamy/foamy and off-white. Head eventually settles into a soapy skim with a dollop of white in the middle. Some spots and strands of lacing are present during the tasting. Nose expresses co-mingled aromas of sweet citrus and bitter rind with a slightly piny character towards the back. Taste follows nose - backbone is quite malty and the bitter/sweet dyad is nicely balanced. Additionally, there's just a trace of ethanol towards the back. Mouthfeel is medium-light (but closer to medium) with a slightly oily consistency, and a carbonation level that falls just short of prickly. There's also some residual alcohol heat that lingers at the back of the throat between quaffs. A really nice DIPA with great balance and very approachable at $7.99 a bomber. Would love to see this in issued as a four pack.","ChrisCage","Jun 21, 2011"

If you hanker for a high ABV hops bomb then "this is your Huckleberry" - you Will Not be dissappointed. If your looking for a strong malt backbone (sweetness) to counterract the dryness and bitterness, look elsewhere - this is all about the hops. But if you crave wonderfully bitter hoppy nuances that are not commonly experienced in other DIPA's, this is a treasure - mint and basil? It's here! For everyone, definitely not. But for a DIPA with some great depth and complexity, this is a must try.","blackcompg","Jun 19, 2011"

An assault on the taste buds - almost too much going on but in a good way. Orange, lemon, grapefruit, pith, mint, fresh-cut grass, several things I can't quite put my finger on, with just enough caramel and toffee to support the hops. On the heavier side of medium-bodied with moderate to low carbonation. Definitely a sipper but each sip invites another. Wow. One of the most unique, complex, and in-your-face DIPAs I have ever had in my life. Glad to see these guys getting distribution in NH now.","MrHurmateeowish","Jun 18, 2011"
4,-7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"O: Really, it's hard to argue this as not being a solid IPA; everything about it is good. It's also hard to see it as being truly great, though. The appearance, taste, and smell all seem to have the same character, and that character is truly just double union Jack. As double Jack, it's hard to beat it up for accomplishing double all of the characteristics of Union Jack, but I feel a little sad that FW didn't go beyond simply that. If you like Union Jack, you'll probably like this twice as much.","Klym","Jun 17, 2011"

Is it the best Imperial IPA ever? I'd say this, Dogifish Head 90 Minute and Hop Stoopid are some of the best I've had.

The flavor was very similar, I think I caught a bit of citrus but it was not hop forward at all. the alcohol was noticeable but didn't detract from the flavor.

The nose comprises caramel, plenty o' leek, pine, dank greens, and light grapefruit peel.

The body is at the lighter end of the medium spectrum, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a fairly solid DIPA, though the hop selection just didn't quite do it for me. The onion-i-ness and the pine-i-ness seem to battle it out with no clear winner, much to the detriment of my tongue.

Little bit of tropical fruit and hints of malty caramel deep underneath. Curiously after a couple of sips the head disappeared and the aroma really changed. I get lots of pineapple and lemon with hints of alcohol. Taste is bitter and resinous with just enough of a bready caramel malt base to keep this drinkable. Finish is a bit dry with a long lingering resinous aftertaste long after each sip. Creamy oily mouthfeel, medium level of carbonation, medium to thin body. This is a big hoppy monster, bordering on harshly bitter. I enjoyed this I'm glad I got to try this, but I've enjoyed other DIPA's more.","johnnnniee","May 18, 2011"
4,-7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a clear auburn gold with good head that dies slow and left lace pactches. Textbook piney citric hop aroma that is strong but with only hints of sweet caramel malt smells. I love the strong hops in this medium-bodied and almost smooth beer. Some balance as the beer maintains dryness thanks to crisp carbonation and also bread and caramel malt notes as well as a touch of sticky sugariness. Pleasant hint of tart fruit flavors like cherry or grape and I like that the ABV adds to a warming finish but doesn't bleed into the beer. Not a hop bomb but a balanced beer that still maintains a huge hop presence and is a good sipper.","clayrock81","May 18, 2011"

It is obvious that this is the bigger, more robust brother of Union Jack, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s better. The bigger, boozier qualities have overpowered some of the more flavorful and enjoyable hop and malt notes that make Union Jack so great.

Powerful grapefruit and pine aroma, resinous and pithy, a little citrus juiciness too. Malt sweetness, sort of caramel and toasted, up front followed by sturdy bitterness and more citrusy goodness. Alcohol followed in the finish, both flavor and warmth. Really quite balanced overall with an appropriate hop dominance. Full bodied with some residual sugar and carbonation that was slightly low. Nice texture. Overall, I have no complaints with this beer. It's well made and tasty, easy drinking for a big beer with alcohol under control but not absent from it's character.

Big notes of piny, tropical hop resins cling to the tongue with a lasting imprint of medicinal booze that warms the stomach.

As for the flavor it was what I expect in a west coast DIPA, hoppy bitter with a light malt sweetness. Again the flavor is tilted towards the hops so the hop head in me was quite pleased it was crisp and clean in the mouth making for a really enjoyable brew to drink.

Sticks all over the tongue, but carries the bitterness nicely through. Overall, this is good, but not amazing.

Among the detectable fruity esters, there are grapefruit, mandarin orange, tangerine, peach, plum, agave nectar, cherry, mango, kiwi, lemon, lime, marion berry, and strawberry. The finish is luxuriously long, and that seltzer quality slightly dries out the finish, and really adds a sprightly tingle. Add to this a great malt backbone that has a fruitiness all its own with a substantial body (similar to Hercules, but not as syrupy and weighty. The floral hoppiness in this beauty almost rivals the Plinys, and after awhile a seltzery saltiness develops, and while I’m not normally a fan of seltzer, it works perfectly here, and leaves one craving another taste.

This is countered by earthy, bitter pine needle flavor and a strong boozy presence. Subtle malt backbone with hints of biscuit and toast. As it warms the alcohol really starts to shoe and begins to dominate the flavor, making it a bit tough to drink down. Decently balanced at first but too hot for my liking.","corby112","Apr 17, 2011"

However, long sticky lacings adorn the glass from top to bottom throughout. Aroma is extrememly fresh cirtusy grapefruit and tangerine. Medium bodied with lazy, fine carbonation. Intense citrus hop flavor in the front with grapefruit, papaya, and tnagerine. These flavors carry from beginning to middle with a bit of malt presence. Finishes with an intense tropical flavor that tapers to a piney hop finish. After a few sips the alcohlic burn becomes appparent. Bitter pine flavor lingers a bit but is a pleasant reminder of how good, and how fresh tasting, this DIPA was.","IronLover","Apr 14, 2011"

As the beer warmed however, the harshness disappeared and it settled into a nice tropical fruit flavoer and aroma.

Delicious nose. Pineapple and tangerine. Hops are nice and fresh and the malt is forward enough to give it very good, sweet balance. Carbonation is too low, giving the mouthfeel a smooth but heavier than desirable texture. But the overall balance of the palate still makes it pretty easy to drink. Piny/grassy hops and just as sweet honey malt flavors. The hops are crisp and bright enough to lend some lightness to the beer but the malt profile is nearly as big as the hop. As such, it doesn't come across as bitter as you would expect and has an uncommonly clean finish that features very little in the way of resiny hops.

A frothy white head sits for minutes before reducing to clumps all over the glass. Smell is of sticky raw pine sap, bready, earthy malts, and a bit of grapefruit. Taste is sticky sweet with loads of piney hops. The grapefruit and citrus dominate the finish and leaves you thinking its dry but underneath there is a devilishly sweet malt backbone. Definitely need to rehydrate after one of these. Overall a solid DIPA, very much like a west coast hopped 90 minute.","Tripphop","Apr 08, 2011"

Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, slight floral hops, hint of wet hops, sweet malt, and a hint of alcohol. Overall, no one aspect surges but, the beer on a whole is great. Good appearance, aroma, blend, body, and mouth feel.

4.05,-6.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"A clear amber, bright and crystal clear, with a dense, off-white head with excellent retention and average lacing. The nose is much better than I was expecting. Very hoppy with a blend of bright and candied citrus, there's orange, tropical fruit, candied orange and pineapple, all present. There's a definite malt backbone present, with some caramel, but the nose is dominated by the hops. The palate opens with an explosion of hop flavor, again it's candied oranges as well as fresh citrus and some tropical fruit. The malt is much more assertive on the palate, with a moderate caramel presence, along with some honey. The hop character is rather juicy, making this really enjoyable. Bitterness is moderate, rather surprisingly so for a DIPA this big. Mildly sweet on the finish with plenty of juicy hop flavor, this is excellent stuff. The mouthfeel is particularly excellent - soft and creamy on the palate, accentuating the hop flavor, this aspect was the best part of the beer IMO.

It smelled very dry, of piny yet overly sweet hops and very sweet malt. The alcohol was right in your face and not well hidden at all. The flavors were a mix of dry, bitter hops with a load of sweet malt. There are a boatload of hops but this is way too sweet for my liking. Where's the balance? It's far too one sided. It tingles the palate and leaves you dry with a sweet malty aftertaste. I'm not impressed. This beer doesn't feature any balance. It's hoppy, so what, the alcohol was distracting. It's not just that it was present, but that is was dominant. I wasn't thrilled by this by any means but I'm glad I finally got to try something from Firestone Walker.","aasher","Mar 14, 2011"

Taste is a crisp heap of juicy oily hops that give off more citrus than earth. a nice mix but im leaning on the tropical side. A sweet middle giving off gum, a earthy finish.

First, the 9.5% is fairly high, even for the style, though - to its credit - you can't taste it anywhere beneath the sweetness and the hop astringency. Second, this is a damn good DIPA. It's a little meatier, more dank, more resinous, and more juicy than some people may like, but it's definitely right up my alley - if you like your hops dirty and nasty, this is definitely one to try out. No wonder FSW tossed this in barrels and made it an important part of FW14.

The smell is boooold citrus. Grapefruit and tangerine dominate, but a slight alcoholic heat is present. Flavors are amazing! this beer is sweet on the lips with citrus flavors and a solid malt backbone. i love what the munich malt adds to the body of this beer. it's a bitter beer for sure. the tail end of the flavor is a little hot, but surprisingly appreciated.It's thick mouthfeel is glorious. it's like sipping on maple syrup, that's how thick and viscous this beer is. i gave it a good solid "4" on drinkability because this beer is 9.5%. if i had more than one bottle to myself, my head would be hurting tomorrow.","berebrando","Feb 21, 2011"

Retention is very good, but lacing is spotty. The nose is pretty intriguing, a dash of caramel followed by a ton of tropical citrus and a hint of pine. It could stand to be just a little bit more pungent though. That same caramel sweetness shows up in the flavor, though it's still just a brief introductory note. The hop bitterness, while certainly present, is incredible smooth as it fades into the beer's finish. Gobs of pineapple, mango, and and orange crash over my palate, as again some resinous pine notes skulk around in the background. I feel fairly confident in saying Double Jack has the best mouthfeel I've ever found in a double IPA. It's a little bit creamy, but incredibly light and spry for its size. It drinks like it's 7% tops instead of almost 10. Carbonation is absolutely perfect, a ton of tiny little bubbles popping on my tongue as they bring the big hop flavor. With zero alcohol presence, and a remarkably rounded bitterness paired with more than ample hop flavor, Double Jack is an all time classic in the world of imperial IPAs","axeman9182","Feb 20, 2011"

4,-7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Draught at Toronado during RBSG09. This really is just concentrated Union Jack. the malt is just a bit sweeter, the hops pack more of a punch, and the alcohol is slightly more evident, though still well concealed. It's good, but I'm already a big fan of Union Jack and this doesn't bring a whole lot new to the table. I do appreciate all the effort it took to get such an intense hop aroma in there though. Since it is not very widely available, I can see myself indulging when I get the chance, but I wouldn't pay more for it if it came in bottles on the shelf next to its little brother. I think that FW has to start from scratch to make a winner of a DIPA","bulletrain76","Nov 11, 2009"

4.32,-0.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Tap @ Hamilton's. Poured clear gold with a bubbly white head. Thick, sitcky lacing. Tart, crisp hop aroma. Predominately grapefruit and oranges with some citrus zest and grass. Biscuits. Lighter than expected mouthfeel with a lot of carbonation. Very nice double version of the Union Jack. Pretty much the same flavors, just more of them. Fresh white grapefruit, tangerine, pine, and and herbal/earthy quality. Malt is biscuity and dry. Absolutely a must if on tap.","magictrokini","Sep 10, 2009"
4.23,-2.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a hazy golden yellow, some amber highlighting, very thick white head forms, slowly settles to a thick ring and layer, lots of lace spirals stick to the glass. Smell is real nice, lots of grapefruit, floral, orange peel, grass, big caramel maltiness, biscuit, very clean, hops don't blast your nose but are pretty balanced and well done. Taste is similar, pretty hoppy, but malty as well, caramel sweetness and biscuit, grapefruit and floral hops, a touch herbal and grassy, gives it a nice British/American DIPA feel, solid bitterness but not overwhelming. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, goes down smooth. Despite being a pretty big beer, this is just nicely balanced and drinkable. Real nice stuff, maybe not as enjoyable for me as the regular Union Jack but enjoyable nonetheless.","Viggo","Aug 27, 2009"
3.81,-12.2,2.5,4,4.5,3,3,"Tough one to rate for drinkability. I really like the flavors but it seems so heavy. I wouldn't consider drinking more than a pint not because it's strong but because it is so filling.","czechsaaz","Aug 26, 2009"

4.25,-2.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Had this on-tap at Barclay's in Oakland. Pours dark golden/light amber with a thin head that sticks around as a very thin cap, with nice but somewhat sparse lacing. Smells of lots of sweet malt at first, followed by a breadiness and grapefruit juice- smells like lots of Simcoe hops here. A bit spicy, and a tiny bit piney at the end. The taste is bigger and spicier with citrus and pine plus bready malts, and quite bitter in the finish. In the mouth, there are chewy malts and a bitterness that keeps on building. I think that the regular Union Jack IPA is one of the more balanced IPAs out there. This has become something quite different. Its still balanced in the sense that there is a lot of sweet malt to balance the huge hop smack, but this has become a monster- albeit a delicious one.","Georgiabeer","Aug 05, 2009"
3.73,-14.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Bitterness isn't high, and hop flavor isn't potent. It seems to me like this is a Double IPA in ABV alone. I was expecting a bit more from this beer because I really enjoy Union Jack.","HopHead84","Aug 03, 2009"
4.62,6.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Appearence is orange copper. Smell is that strong pine malt we are all used to with the UJ and seemed identical in appearnce. Taste seemed sweeter to me and much more enjoyable. The hops were there but seemed a little tame compared to UJ. There is more complexity with the Double Jack. There are different stages that start with the taste we are used to but stands out and leads to a sweet almost apple/citrus mouthful with a toasty and very enjoyable light malt finish. Nothing harsh about this for me. Alcohol is at the back of the bus on this beer. Drinkability is through the roof on this! The 9.5% would have fooled me. I could drink this everyday if it wasnt for the price being $25 to fill my growler. Im not a big fan of UJ but this one is an exception!","bargerking","Jul 29, 2009"
4.45,2.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"On tap at the Oregon Brewers Festival. Pours a beautiful clear amber with a thick, rocky head that rapdily dissipates. The smell is uncommon for a DIPA: you get the stereotypical pine/citrus notes, but you also get a peach/vanilla smell that doesn't show up much in this style. Mouthfeel is classic: medium-bodied with a just-so level of carbonation. The taste starts with the blend of its Union Jack cousin: floral hops with peach and light caramel. Then Double Jack flashes its DIPA bona fides with strong pine and lemon peel with a dry hop smack to the tonsils. A great beer that shows that a display of hop athleticism can coexist with more subtle and complex flavors. A class act.","chicagobeerriot","Jul 28, 2009"
4.59,5.8,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Fantastic DIPA that deserves regular rotation. First, let's get the Union Jack comparison out of the way. Double Jack is smoother with more sweet caramel malt and hoppier with quite a bit more fruit flavor. On to the review... Double Jack pours a bright orange-yellow without much in the way of head, but it's always difficult to judge head when the beer is too cold and on tap. The aroma is simply wonderful. It's a blast of candied pine, tangerines and grapefruit rind. The sweet malt is noticeable, but the hops are clearly the focus. The flavor is rich with hops, much like the aroma. The malt backbone provides good sweetness. It's well-balanced on my scale of DIPAs, anyway, which is to say not balanced but not quite as bitter as some. The flavor also imparts some other fruit flavors, apricots, peaches, other lighter stone fruits. I found the fruit flavors more varied and fuller than nearly any other DIPA I've tried. The feel is round and strong without any cloying sweetness or bitter astringency. Drinkability is quite good for the size and style.","popery","Jul 28, 2009"

4.16,-4.1,5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a brilliant reddish-orange that radiates from the glass and has a bubbly off-white head that dissolves into a swirly fine layer around the glass. The aroma is fresh citrus hops with some toasted malt in the background. The flavor is piney and citrusy hops upfront and is accompanied by some a nice touch of malt and finishes with a grapefruit bitterness. Its full-medium bodied and has a nice amount of carbonation. This beer absolutely blew me away. The aroma smells like a basket of hops and the flavor doesn't let you down. In my opinion this is far superior to my encounters with Pliny. This just has a nice malt backbone to accompany the delicious bouquet of hops.","DiabolikDUB","Jul 13, 2009"

2.81,-35.3,3.5,2.5,3,4,2,"D: This is a pretty decent beer, but the way they chose to release it (OMG mid-week Toronado release party!), the way they're being difficult about growlers, the claim that it would be the next Pliny the Younger, and the high price (more expensive than Pliny the Elder) built up expectations that this would be phenomenal.
