Enough carbonation to maintain a light head throughout.  Nice light lacing.  Aroma is a nice balanced slightly earthy hop note but not overpowering.  Taste follows the nose with an exceptionally nice balance of hops and malt.  The finish is a hair sweet but then the bitterness comes through and lingers on the tongue, but not objectionable at all.  This is a very well balanced beer for those who are new to IPAs.  This is always in my standard rotation.  Very nice.","KidDoc","Dec 13, 2014"

Aromas of subtle toasted grains, hints of caramel, floral and herbal spice highlights, and a blend of citrus and tropical fruit notes. A bit less nose than I was expecting. Flavors are citrus and tropical fruit forward, with a char undertone. Pineapple, mango, and apricot blend nicely with grapefruit and lemon zest. Cut grass, pepper spice, evergreen, and pitch notes from the hops provide a good balancing bitterness and dank feel. The body is smooth and light, with a fruit cocktail aftertaste. The finish has a tangy sweet cloy balanced by a solid resinous bitter note. Decent linger on a pretty tasty brew.","GarthDanielson","Nov 20, 2014"

Nose of tropical and citrus hops, with some pine in the background, over a light biscuit.  Light medium body with a nice slick texture.  Slightly above normal carbonation with a nice bit of effervescence on the finish.  The excellent flavor profile is complex and a masterpiece of balance. It begins with a balanced blend of hop flavors that flow into a moderate bitterness, that has a spicy note, over a slightly sweet biscuit background.  The middle is where the flavor components fade with the alcohol completely hidden.  The finish effervesces nicely and leaves you with a nice slightly spicy pine bitterness that flows into grapefruit rind.  Outstanding!!","tillmac62","Sep 25, 2014"

Pleasant mouthfeel with creamy and adequate levels of carbonation are there, which is a must for me.  Some complex flavors bouncing back between citrusy and piney hops continue to develop.  Initial swallows had extended moments of 'sweetness' randomly timed in my mouth.  I'm still waiting to figure out if ragweed and goldenrod are ruining the my nose or it's nose....as there doesn't appear to be anything of importance developing.  That said, it is an awesome Imperial, while not much to be said of the malt, and everything to be thanked for the layers of hop flavor.","JV-NH","Sep 09, 2014"

I don't believe this beer is. The label simply refers to it as an "Imperial Pale Ale" and while visiting the brewery they did not refer to it as a double IPA. As such, if you take it as a regular IPA then this beer is incredible and full of resin hop flavor. The light color appearance may surprise some but I don't see it as an issue. During my tour at the Troegs Brewery I got to sample this straight from the fermentor and it was fantastic. This is the single beer I look forward to the most when I visit Pennsylvania.","Tuck_leepulin","Aug 01, 2014"

Taste is much the same as the smell up front and through the finish. Very rarely have I had a beer so consistent from the smell through the finish. And in this case it's consistently citrus hops. Actually though it ends up being a bit one-note, even if that note is good. Full bodied. Fairly drinkable and a really solid IPA throughout.","burnstar","Jul 23, 2014"

The taste is bolstered by big malt that is slightly sweet....to balance the beer there is bitter hops with not much pine or citrus. The mouthfeel is full in body with good carbonation.

The mouthfeel definitely stands out on this and leaves a lot of other ipa's wanting in this department. Wonder what this would have tasted like when fresh. If you like the way your beer feels in you mouth and you like IPA this one is a must have, Cheers!","DrinkMoreBigBeers","May 03, 2014"

A little thick but in a good sticky way. The taste is better than I expected given the aroma. It is malty but with a nice hoppy bitterness. There is a definite bite of alcohol on the tail but it is pleasant. You can tell that this ale has seen better days but it is still a solid offering.

Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is full of hops, citrus. Taste is lots of hops, tropical fruits, touch of malts, tasty and refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer.","tone77","Jan 16, 2014"

I have become masterful at this practice and the pour was picture-perfect, resulting in two dense fingers of French Vanilla-colored head with excellent retention. A brief pseudo-cascade resulted, finalizing in a beautifully clear golden-yellow (SRM = > 5, < 7) and rather than fighting, Mammon, Croesus and Midas defaulted to yours truly, clapping as I took my first sip. I leaned in for a sniff first, taking in a tropical pungency of mango, tangerine, papaya and grapefruit. My mouth was watering and the hops monkey on my back also made a sudden appearance! I began to feel as though something historical was going to happen when I hit the "review" button, but then my homeboy, nick "the tick" D717 chimed in, reminding me that it would only be hysterical, as usual. I tied off, raised a toast to nickD717, and hit paydirt. Man, it came on like an Acela train between stations, high-flying and stopping for nothing and no one. The mouthfeel was medium, but who cares? I was gettin' my hops fix, baby! It had a tropical fruitiness underlain by a grapefruit bitterness and the monkey began to settle down. I looked down and ... Jumpin' Jehosephat! I had already CANsumed half of the beer in my glass. It may have been excitement, but I would rate the Drinkability high on this one, if such a designation still existed on this site. Finish was dry and biting and when I listened closely, I could hear the Zephyr winds blowing across the Sahara Desert. Phew! This may not make an ideal outdoor beer at 7.5% ABV, but in that case, I want to put Sunshine Pils on my CAN Want List prior to the summer.","woodychandler","Jan 07, 2014"

This wasn't an overly hoppy beer, but I enjoyed the citrus and fruit hints. This was a nice blend of malt and hops. In fact, I ordered not one, but three of these.

Smooth, easy to drink, for some reason I don't get much except a large dose of citric hops with a touch of breadiness that makes the mouthfeel somewhat filling. Not much else in terms of hop flavors like grapefruit and for some reason I really don't get any sweet malt notes. Maybe my draft was served too cold (it was definitely not at the recommended 45/50ish range) b/c I seemed to have had a muted experience compared to other reviewers. Still enjoyed this beer as the hoppiness wasn't overpowering or bitter.","clayrock81","Sep 01, 2013"

This one’s lovely to look at. Nose is peachy, tropical & floral. Has a little dank which I love and the malt is peeking out with some biscuit and honey. Taste is near perfection with no alcohol, some hop bitter and light malt to greet the palate. Light, clean but it falls short of crisp. The hops come up catty and earthy and the malt is fat with cracker and bread. Finishes bitter and a touch of grain. Of all the Troegs I have had this one is the least impressive. Troegs has it’s own brews to compete with and this one is good, it’s even better than good but it lacked nerve.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

4.1,0.5,4,4,4.25,4,4,"Troegs markets this beer as an “imperial pale ale,” but that’s not really a real style, and anyone who has quaffed this hoppy delight instantly recognizes all of the hallmarks of what tastes surprisingly closer to a hopped-up west coast-style IPA than the more balanced, maltier IPAs typically favored by east coast brewers. Perpetual boasts six different hop varieties — boiled with Bravo, Chinook and Mt. Hood; hopped back with Mt. Hood and Nugget; and dry-hopped with Citra and Cascade — and the Citra and Cascade dry-hop is the dead giveaway for why Perpetual exudes a delightfully citric west coast-style aroma and flavor profile. As an unapologetic hop head and New Yorker, I tend to scoff at certain east coast takes on my favorite style, but Perpetual is an IPA the northeast can be proud of.","LarryK","May 09, 2013"

4.08,0,4,4,4.25,3.75,4," Taste starts with grapefruit, floral, bread, and pale malt. Ends with piney resin and a bit of funk. Has a crisp but very dry finish. Slightly creamy, lighter moutfeel for an IIPA with moderate-heavy carbonation. I like the balance of flavor in this one, lighter and more drinkable than some other IIPA's.","JG-90","Apr 06, 2013"

Taste is where the money is made. Wonderfully balanced while still presenting a hop forward persona. Front starts with toasted malt, quickly leads to a gentle but mildly tongue scraping hop extravaganza. Subtle combination of pine and grapefruit with a good hop oily flavor. No trace of the alchohol.

Unfortunately, they impart virtually nil in terms of mouthfeel of the hop. Carbonation is high, alcohol is mildly stinging like an antiseptic. The bitterness just doesn't have any flavor to it, nothing in terms of pine, tropical or citrus fruit. Its kind of bland. Reminiscient of double take ipa, all bitterness, no substance.

Light golden orange color looks great. Smell is very interesting, with a combination of citrus hops and a grassy natural aroma which reminds me somewhat of Founders All Day IPA. The main difference here is more pine (and higher ABV), even though it's subtle overall. There is also a hint of sweetness which comes through somewhere in the middle. Taste is unique, too, blending elements of aroma with more emphasis on light citrus flavors, very soft lemon, grapefruit, and pine also subtly present. Mouthfeel is average, carbonation noticeable, less smooth than I generally prefer. Overall, this would be a fantastic session IPA, but for the 7.5 ABV.

3.88,-4.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Picked this up at DecCicco's in Brewster, NY. An amazingly clear yellow amber color with a very solid white head that deflates to a full but thin cover and a robust web of lacing. The aroma brings a mild citrus bread straw grass deal. A bit too mild to me but not unpleasant. The flavor brings a somewhat harsh grass hop with a nice grainy caramel bread. There’s a hint of alcohol but the grassy grain bite is the dominant theme. It offers a very liquid medium body that feels a bit glassy with very adequate carbonation. I detected a vague sulphur that wasn’t a bad thing. Toasted grains and lots of tongue grabbing hop bitterness. I like it plenty! Refreshing and a palate pleaser.","Durge","Sep 14, 2012"

Taste is dominated by huge floral hops aroma with light green hops notes and very little bitterness with some lightly sweet malt notes. Body is about average with good carbonation.

Taste is also quite hoppy, citrus, orange and lemon, some pine, malty towards the finish, assertive bitterness throughout, more hops in the aftertaste.

Well, it's clearly another well-executed, tasty brew by Tröegs that brings something unique to the table as far as hoppy beer is concerned. It takes elements of a traditional pale ale and a West Coast IPA and blends them. The result is an exceptional hoppy beer long on fresh, green, citric, piney flavors that exhibits quite a nice malt backbone. I highly recommend this one. Plus, a six will only run you about $11. In the world of craft beer, that's called a bargain.","hagbergl","Jul 31, 2012"

In my opinion, the best IPAs provide bitterness in the form of tropical fruit flavors such as grapefruit, lemon, and in the most desirable examples, peaches and sweet oranges. This one carries little, if any, fruity bitterness. Anyone who can find this IPA can certainly find others at the same price that are far superior.","deadonhisfeet","Jul 28, 2012"

Smell is lots of citrus mango, tangerine, pineapple, grapefruit, and pine. Taste is so perfectly balanced in the start and a nice sharp grapefruit finish. Body is medium for its ABV, perfect amount of carbonation, a little dry not complaining goes well, and dangerously drinkable. Now I consider this a regular IPA, not imperial and it is fantastic.

The sheer amount of hops packed into this small firkin is staggering. Possibly one of the best Troegs beers I have ever had.","orangesol","Jun 19, 2012"

I was really looking forward to this, because I missed it the first time around, but it didn't live up to the expectations I had. It's certainly not a bad beer (I'm giving it a 3.5 overall), but after I finish this case, I won't be buying it again. It misses the mark for me as an IPA and there are much better IPAs out there. If they wanted it to be something different, they should have named it differently. It's all sort of confusing. Worth a try, certainly not bad, but not really my cup of tea, either.","RnRManifesto","Jun 11, 2012"

My biggest complaint about the tap lines at Troegs: the ales are too damned cold. The hoppiness is lost to the temperature. As the ale warms, the hops become stronger, more evident. The citrus and zest are light but increase with each sip, strong but never out of whack. Pale malts aren't a factor but they keep the hops in","akorsak","Jan 07, 2012"

4.32,5.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Digging the artwork here, man. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sunset gold topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises plenty o' grapefruit (both yellow and ruby red), a touch of orange zest, an even lighter touch of lemon rind, a hint of pine needles, and a light smattering of sweet biscuits. The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger pine element (though it's still submissive to the fruit), a bit of mandarin orange, and a hint of pineapple. Tasty stuff, indeed! The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a rather dry finish. Overall, a very tasty IPA, one of the better ones I've had in a while. The sheer extent of fruitiness and dryness, though, makes it hard for me to think about drinking too many of these in one sitting. Oh well, it's great stuff regardless.","TMoney2591","Oct 24, 2011"

Lighter than most IPAs I have ever had. nice head, not much retention. Smell- light citrus, sweet bready malt. Some tropical flavors like mango. Taste- hmm. something not quite right here. The hops aren't very noticable. This bottle is about 2 months old I think, but it has barely any hops profile left. This doesn't even resemble an IPA. Maybe like a weak pale ale? Dissapointing.

Pale maltiness up front with mild fruitiness and faint alcohol spiciness kicking in later on. Medium bodied with fine, silky carbonation, fairly dry with no alcohol warmth.

4.15,1.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a wondrous, vibrant gold color with pure-white head, and lots of it. The body is hazy to the point of distortion, but not entirely opaque. The smell is of citrus, faint spice, more citrus, pine resin, straw, freshly cut grass, and bittering hops. An IPA scent for the ages. Taste follows suit, with grapefruit, orange, lemon, loads of hops, pine, grass, straw, and faint, faint caramel. A touch of cane sugar on the finish and in the mouth brings it down slightly, as it adds a sense of artificiality to it (not a gripe, just an observation). Mouthfeel is otherwise, crisp, bitter, and rejuvenating; finishes dry and slightly sticky. Overall, a great IPA that certainly stands out.","eclipse54","Sep 23, 2011"

Big grapefruit acidity and refreshing. Some negatives is the bitterness that is not supplemented with a prevalent malt base. Thin on the palate, but has an oily hop coating that makes me like this.

Here I was think it was a somewhat tame (but still quite good) India Pale Ale that drank more like a Pale. Silly me.

4.42,8.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Very clear gold beer with a nice fluffy head and good lacing. Head sticks around for a while. Aroma of hoppy goodness; a lot of citrus and pineapple standing out. The taste has all those hops, with the bitterness held in check just enough to let the subtleties shine through. Faintly malty undertones, vaguely sweet, nicely balanced. Carbonation is moderate; finish is medium short, w/first lingering hoppy citric notes and finally a pleasant, controlled bitterness. Impressive. Truly one of the best East Coast IPA's I've had to date. Get it, drink it, love it.","tobelerone","Sep 12, 2011"
4.47,9.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O - This may be the most robust IPA i've ever had because of the elaborate flavor, dominant hop character, and abv. If someone told me that it was a DIPA, I'd believe it. The most surprising aspect of this beer to me is that it looks nothing like an IPA. It's very clean, clear, and crisp like a pilsner with no sediment whatsoever. You wouldn't expect such a bland-looking beer to deliver this much flavor...highly recommend it!","BeerMaverick","Sep 11, 2011"

4.05,-0.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"From a bottle. Pours clear medium gold with a weirdly fizzy white head. Nose is a pretty nice balance of fresh hops and citrus rind, some candied orange. Mouth is fresh and balanced, hops focus on pine needles. A one-note bittering effect from beginning to end. Not as large and expressive as Nuggest Nectar. A decent IPA, good stuff right now, but not the greatest I've had recently and nothing to go nuts over. Succeeds in being nicely balanced and highly drinkable.","JAXSON","Sep 09, 2011"
4.35,6.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: This is a very nice brew from Troegs. It seems to fit into that vague "Extra IPA" territory between IPA and Double IPA, but that's mostly a matter of semantics. I really enjoyed the Citra and Nugget dry hop character, which definitely adds a distinctive (and nicely complementary) character to this beer. Troegs does good work with hoppy styles (see Nugget Nectar and Hopback Amber), and this is no exception.","Clydesdale","Sep 09, 2011"
3.95,-3.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Notes: Imperial Pale Ale hence IPA… Troegs always seems to be playing with this denomination, for instance with their Nugget nectar. It may work for them but meddles a bit the denomination of what is a nice hefty IPA, short of any imperial denominations I guess… Different than their NN, which I like more now, but at this price point this is a nice offering.","Daniellobo","Sep 09, 2011"
4.35,6.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: Troegs Perpetual is a true achievement. An APA with chops. It's flavorful, crisp, and clean and I must say I think they accomplished exactly what they were going for. This is a great beer.","siege06nd","Sep 09, 2011"
4.55,11.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"So perfectly bitter in the taste. Grapefruit and piney hops run rampant and really make for a balanced, albeit on the very hoppy side, pale ale. A lemon citrus taste is detected in the middle, making for a juicy mouthfeel. A very light biscuit quality is in the back that only makes the hoppiness stand out more, as it makes for a backdrop, like a blank canvas. The best part may be the ultra clean mouthfeel and finish. Crisp and dry, but still juicy in the middle. Aftertaste holds some of the bitterness to remind you just how potent it is and makes you want to take another sip. Although its 7.5% abv, it doesn't really show it at all, except for maybe just a breath in the end. This is one of those beers that goes to show that there doesn't always need a large amount of malt presence to make a great beer. There is some malt presence, but the hops really just do what they do best here. I am impressed with this one and will probably buy again.","chodinheaven","Sep 08, 2011"
4,-2,4,4,4,4,4,"O- Nice, reminds me a bit of SN Hoptimum. Grassy, piney and brash hop flavors! Certainly not ground breaking, nor is it even in my top 20 IPA's... but it was nice to try.","Thickfreakness","Sep 08, 2011"

I wasn't really sure what to expect from this at all, and I have to say it is easily one of the best East coast IPAs I've had and a strong contender against the giants in the West as well. Definitely hop forward, but from there it balances itself among the hop influences and hits nearly all major categories (floral, pine, citrus, spicy) strongly. I will most definitely be seeking this out soon to try again, an absolute joy.","nhindian","Sep 02, 2011"

Very IPA'ish on the bite, bit juicy hop burst with all the before mentioned citrus tones balanced perfect with the gentle malt in the background.

Taste: basically the same as the smell...if pine trees had flowers this is what the nectar would taste like. Hops hit u up front and malts slide down in the finish - perfectly balanced, and the balance is a delicate one, like walking a tightrope. Mouthfeel is perfect. Overalll - it lives up to the hype.

4.33,6.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"O: This is a wonderful IPA. This has to be one of the best American IPA's I have recently tasted, and quite possibly ever tasted. It reminds me of Bell's Two-Hearted in the taste profile, but it is more complex. Bell's is pretty much just delivering one flavor, while this has many tones and complexities in comparison.

Nice amount of bitterness present on the finish that lingers for a decent period of time with caramel, citrus, pine, and spice notes. Very nice balance of bitterness to sweetness.

Taste follows scent nicely with the bitter grapefruit and citrus rind notes, floral, grassy, piney and litly herbal notes also present in some form or another. Pale, lightly sweet biscuity malt provides a backbone and only a small touch of noticeable alcohol. Medium bodied, a touch bubbly, oily but clean. A very nice addition to the lineup...

3.04,-25.5,4.5,3,3,2.5,3,"This beer is as confusing as using the IPA nomenclature for an Imperial Pale Ale. Darkish golden color, light caramel and leafy hop aroma. Thinnish medium body and a touch of sweetness that barely balances a big dose of grassy bitterness. Weak grassy hoppy middle which overides the malt character. Slight alcohol heat gives it a little spiciness. Finishes dry on the tongue and bitter on the palate. Can't tell if this is just an out of balance big pale ale or an IPA that fails to deliver hop flavor/aroma. Even on its own merits without the confusing naming convention, doesn't fare much better.","Longstaff","Aug 27, 2011"

Taste is a mostly bitter hops, though not as abrasive as some hop bombs. Bone dry finish. Malt backbone has hints pale ale malts, so maybe I'm starting to understand what they mean by "imperial pale ale" rather than calling this an India pale ale, though the distinction seems minor and unnecessarily confusing. I'd call this a straight IPA since that's essentially what it is. Overall very solid "I"PA from Troegs though this is a beer that belongs in 6-packs (and probably year-round) rather than high-priced bombers though I'll enjoy the temporary treat for now.","Blanco","Aug 27, 2011"

Taste is more of the same. The bittering lingers but is well balanced with a nice malt backbone. I like the name Imperial pale ale. It really describes the aroma/taste well. It is balanced like a pale ale but hoppy and strong like an india pale ale. Another winner from Troegs. I hope to see it around again (for now it appears to be an August offering only).","cracker","Aug 27, 2011"

The beer smells malty like graham crackers with herbal hops. The Citra and cascade seem to be masked by the earthier Mt. Hood hops. The beer tastes very bitter with a little herbal and lime leaf hops. The finish is dry and long lasting. The MF is a little thin. Overall this is an okay beer, kind of misleading to call this an IPA. This being a fresh bottle, less than 2 weeks since bottling, it is rather disappointing considering how hoppy and flavorful Nugget Nectar is compared to this rather pallid beer.","Soonami","Aug 27, 2011"

First whiff reveals a truck load of raw citrus hops that makes me immediately regret buying only one. Palate is super fresh and hoppy with a perfect amount of pale malt to balance it out.

That is the way this drinks. It does not contain the hops and citrus that one would expect from a traditional IPA or IIPA, it has more of a malt backbone as a Pale Ale would. When judging this beer for what it actually is, the flavors are balanced and complex. The sweet citrus blends well with the biscuity malts and finishes with just the right amount of bitterness.","jgreenearrow","Aug 20, 2011"
3.11,-23.8,4,3,3,3.5,3,"Bottle 8-11-11 (fresh!) Poured into a Bell's tulip. Looks exactly like apple juice with a white cap of head on it. The nose is malt dominant with soapy, flowery hops and a smell my wife calls "those candy hearts you get with the phrases on them". I don't know exactly what she is talking about and yet I do. Not a huge fan of the nose. Flowery, bitter hops, a bready malt back, it almost tastes lagered some how. Not really a fan and surprised how much I don't like the hop profile for how fresh it is. Oddly bland for a really fresh IPA. Bitterness, but not in a fun way. If you try really hard, there is a pine presence, but mostly flowery. Nothing wrong with this beer - good mouthfeel and whatnot, but I don't like it. Also, Imperial Pale Ale for IPA? The definition of no errors, but distinctly average.","seeswo","Aug 20, 2011"
4.01,-1.7,4.5,3.5,4,5,4,"This seems to be more akin to an India Pale Ale, however simply saying it's an over-hopped Pale Ale would do justice as well.

Head retention is pretty good, and there's also a lot of lacing. Aroma is mostly citrusy hops (grapefruit, tropical fruits, orange peel), along with some pine hops and bready/grainy malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, the brew tastes like citrusy hops (grapefruit, lemon and orange peel, tropical fruit), pine and floral hops, and some bready malt. There's also a long lasting bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and creamy with moderate carbonation. It's smooth and goes down easy. I liked this brew a lot.

Why doesn't Troegs make an IPA anyway? At any rate, I poured it into one of those bumpy pint glasses. Nice fluffy head, with a light, golden color. Interesting hops smell with some sweetness.

Head forms a bright white pale color with thick even bands of lacing dwindling down the sides of my chalice. Aroma has a nice pungent citrus base of hops with some tropical and pine elements close behind. Really sweet sugar coated hop nose, basically hop candy with a nice biscuit breadiness to it. Flavor I guess we should remember kids their calling this an imperial pale ale, not an imperial IPA but it is labeled Perpetual IPA. A bitingly hoppy, mildly bitter experience presents with some warming alcohol and layers of hop oils carrying pineapple, citrus grapefruit, very flavorful profile amongst the big beer package of a 7.5 percent ale. Luscious layers of hop oils build up to a medium bodied ale flowing nicely.

It is a pleasurable experience from how refreshing it is to it's hop bite, touch of sweetness and light dry finish. This is a dangerously drinkable beer that I could see being consumed by the gallon.

It's much stronger out the nose of the bottle than poured into a pint glass, but man is it strong. The taste is marvelous. A very hop heavy effort. This is right there with the best of 'em. The mouthfeel is marvelous. You could swish and gargle with this and never get tired of it. Overall, this is one of my favorite beers...and certainly a top 2 Troegs beer.

Lacing was light but lasting. Nose was citrus hops up front with elements of floral and grassiness and spice. Taste is a very nice and refreshing - citrus, some bready yeast, mild bitterness and caramel sweetness. APA? Nah… this is an IPA taste for sure, but like most of my favorites - even with a refreshing bite, still overall quite nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is medium, mildly carbonated, and on the sticky side. At 7.5%, this is (carefully) sessionable. I am pretty excited about this beer. Nugget Nectar is our finest right-coast IPA ( I know, I know…not how Troeg's classifies it) but with limited (seasonal) availability. Now they have filled some of the void!

Overall a pretty good offering. This is as over hopped as Nugget Nectar is for its "style" to the extent that it is outside the normal realm. I don't know if calling this an Imperial Pale is a joke of sorts or if "IPA" is ambiguous. I guess "India and Imperial" are interchangeable.","stakem","Aug 13, 2011"
4.5,10.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5," The taste is definitely and IPA thorugh and through -so much herbal citrus and slight tangerine sweetness from the hops with moderately high bitterness, yet the flavor of the hops is the star with slight tropical tinges from the Citra yet some lemony aspects from the Bravo and gentle floral component from the cascade in there. I love how full and expressive it is. the malt is just there as a backdrop to pin all the vibrant hop flavors upon, very dank herbal and almost peachy at times with a gentle juicy hop tinge -an incredible amount of hop flavor which I am sure will get compared to Nugget nectar, yet it leaves no doubt this is the IPA they have been working hard to achieve with lots of practice blending on the scratch IPA series leading up to this. Overall it is great -Chock full of hops of the American high alpha ilk which should please anyone who likes dank, juicy and still moderately high in bitterness too. I enjoyed the drinkability of this most -a well crafted IPA.","Slatetank","Aug 12, 2011"
4.33,6.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"O - This is one bitter hop bomb of a beer that will satisfy any hop head. In fact, had this been sampled when blindfolded, I would swear it's a West Coast beer. The East Coast is rising to the extreme IPA challenge and this one ranks right at the top of the list in perceived bitterness, I'm really digging this beer. Definitely worth going out of the way to seek out, this is WAY over the top when compared any of the other beers I've had from Troegs and they've done a darn good job of designing a tremendously lopsided beer. Well done Troegs, could you PLEASE add this to your regular rotation?","jzeilinger","Aug 11, 2011"
4.3,5.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"ADDED NOTE: I agree with Slate, and would also not the brewer calls this an IPA. Should not be classed as an American Pale Ale","HoopTime","Aug 11, 2011"
4.22,3.4,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"O - This is exactly what the name says...Imperial Pale Ale...a great hop presence and flavor with an equally balancing malt bill...the flavors play off of each other perfectly","thain709","Aug 11, 2011"
