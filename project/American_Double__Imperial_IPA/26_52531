4.72,10.8,4.75,4.5,4.75,5,4.75,"Overall, another impressive beer by the boys from Munster. This one is almost as good as Cimmerian sabertooth Berzerker, which I gave a 5. It all comes down to personal taste, of course, but this one was just a little too muted for me to consider it worthy of a 5. Still an awesome, awesome, awesome beer. I enjoyed every sip.","do_ob","Tuesday at 06:56 PM"

Syrupy sweet malt with candied lemon and a piney bitter finish that's - on the whole - rather balanced just goes on and on. A great beer, but not a great DIPA.","AgentMunky","Mar 27, 2015"

Honestly it smells like dirt~ Almost a bit bitter I feel like I have to end this #Breview as this one still taste good, I don't think it is tasting the way 3F's intended it (If so, it was less than Impressive)~ Overall: Incomplete (Stay tuned for a revisit)","BrewUSA","May 29, 2014"

Somehow though, bitterness is in control, not bitter simply for bitter's sake. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, and drinkability is good for an DIPA. Nice brew, for sure.","ppoitras","Jan 19, 2014"
