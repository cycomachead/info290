Sadly, though, I find the lack of seams and absence of powerful flavors a bit disappointing. It lacks character, even though I appreciate just how technically sound it is. It's like listening to finely filtered Kenny G piped into an art gallery instead of John Coltrane live. I might pick up that album and listen again and again to marvel at the technique, but I'd really rather be in the smoke and sweat of a jazz club, even if going back means it won't ever be the same twice.","1sophrosyne1","Friday at 06:13 PM"

Turned out well as all the best aromas of a top-notch DIPA were released. Taste is (I'm writing as I savor) is superb. Though now on my "got" list it remains on my "want" list as in want more.

Being from Vermont, where massive IPA's are de rigueur, I totally expected more based on ratings and reviews. I obtained my sample(s), via trade. They are very fresh (less than 2 weeks). They arrived well packed and cold, so I don't think mishandling is involved. My first impression: this is such an average feeling DIPA in 2015. Sean Lawson was brewing this same beer a decade ago in his shed. It is relatively clean, smooth and true to IPA form.  But that standard sailed a half decade ago, at least in New England. Five years ago I might have been blown away. Today? I am sadly unimpressed. I am  dismayed at how this is perceived by the public.","Walruzuma","Feb 20, 2015"

Lattice work formed along the sides with consumption. About 1/4" to 1/3" of resurgent head consistently formed upon agitation. Smell was incredible, with an overall pungent floral smell with obvious hops and pine. Taste was a fresh, crisp fruity tartness, reminiscent of grapefruit. Perfectly astringent, with a slight but not overpowering pucker. Finish was a slow build of bitterness that progressed, but finished asymptotically smooth. Definite presence of pine and resin. Mouthfeel was medium, with some definite body though counterbalanced by its refreshing taste.

The first one consumed the next day tasted just as good as it did on tap, but I noticed my enjoyment slowly diminish with each one. Took about 3 or 4 weeks to drink all of them. Again, kind of a no brainer, but try to drink as fresh as possible. Some IPAs can sit a few weeks and you hardly notice a difference in taste. This is not one of them.

Nose brings an explosion of orange marmalade and pine.  The first sip brings orange to the fore followed by huge pine - tastes like I'm chewing a cud of pine needles.  Flavor is more bitter than many of the IPAs rolling out of CA these days, which is nothing but a good thing.  There is a reason this beer is a standard bearer.","mschantz","Jan 24, 2015"

Flavor is the only issue. It seems watered down in comparison to what I'm used to drinking - all the AIPA flavors are there, but it's all very subtle. Nothing overpowers, which is good, but when I grab an IPA, I'm looking for that hoppy wow factor and this just doesn't have it. That may be why it's so appealing to others, and if I wasn't big on IPAs, I'd probably make this my first choice. I think in the category of beer (in general), this is definitely a 5; but in the DIPA category, it's lacking....","brewqueno","Jan 17, 2015"

This beer did not cause me to stand up and cheer, nothing crazy in terms of smell or taste, but it is absolutely flawless in its delivery.  Looks exactly the way a IIPA should, nice beautiful golden with a small head.  Smells are west coast 101--pine and grapefruits.  Bitter as hell on the palate, but the balance is incredible, leaves you dry and ready for another sip.  So glad I had this beer.  Would I go crazy to get it again?  No, probably not.

I will try to find the Younger this year, but I have had a number of IPA's that hold up well to the Elder.   I enjoyed it and will enjoy the last three bottles but not sure if the all of the hype is well founded.

Clean malt, crackery backbone puts the hops on shine! Bitterness is soft and lingering, perfect early kettle bittering. Just enough malty sweetness to balance out all the hops. Thin bodied with great carbonation that doesn't take away from all the aforementioned flavor components. Alcohol is well covered, barely any warmth detected while sipping. What can you say, it's Pliny! I've had this tons of time (2 hours away from the brewpub). Been a while since I've had. Can't believe I've waited so long. Don't wait if you don't have to. A must have, at least once! Probly the DIPA going.","mac31","Dec 24, 2014"

4.3,-7.7,,,,,," Almost dough, smooth beginning with oily, wooden flavors of pine, until the hops become recognizable. In an impressive way. They deliver a fantastic grassy bitterness which gets coated up by wooden malts and pleasant, warm oak. Hops define the taste of this beer, without washing away any of the supporting, complex flavors. This allows a multi-layered depth on the palate, which results in a long, dry aftertaste, as hops take over in the end. Citrus peel, kiwi and lime add crispy, fruity hints to the hop impression, altough they don’t stand out too far on their own, but line up with the more present floral and herbal notes. The most pleasant thing about this Double-IPA is its perfect balance. While it is in fact very hoppy, nothing sticks out too much, nothing distracts from the unique complexity, very well done.","aleigator","Oct 29, 2014"
4.95,6.2,,,,,,"The pine aroma was immediate and a pleasant surprise.  Spectacular citrus-hop-piney balance and like many reviewers have said, the easiest drinking DIPA in existence that I'm aware of.  The smoothness reminds me a lot of Lawson's Finest Liquids DIPAs but has even less of a bitter tickle.  It's really amazing how smooth and balanced this beer is.   I can certainly see why this is arguably the best DIPA in the world.  Well worth the effort to find and having had Heady, Lawson's and others like Trillium, Tree House and Foley Bros.; Pliny deserves its due  near the very top of everyone's list.  Just a very satisfying experience.  Loved it.","Erockruns","Oct 29, 2014"

Hype can really kill things for me. As it poured I was struck by the honey color. Beautiful. 1.5 finger white head. The aroma was very pineapple-y. I took my first sip, and was completely blown away.  Each drink afterwards somehow got better and better. The taste was a balance between pineapple-y citrus and pine hops. The finish was exquisite. Pliny is perfectly balanced in every way. This was the best beer I have ever had and is likely to remain the best.","JohnIrving","Oct 27, 2014"

Great aroma but not as pronounced as expected.  Taste is an amazing isolation of citrus hop flavor.  Grapefruit, orange and tangerine in a wave of hop driven flavor with a perfect level of caramel sweetness to keep it in check.  Not overly bitter which allows all that hop flavor to come through.  Creamy burst in mouthfeel with a medium body that crisps up and finishes bone dry.  A showcase of hop flavor,  this is an amazing DIPA I'd love to try again.","HopBomb515","Oct 23, 2014"

Exactly the citrus, floral hop notes one hopes for in a DIPA. Pretty much the ideal hop character up front, immediate and sustained. A little alcohol on the finish with an appropriate stickiness to hold the hops until the next sip. Other reviewers with more refined palates can provide the specific hop profiles. Just get some if you can.","MisterGone","Sep 19, 2014"

I have been let down by so many hyped beers (ipa's especially) like all of dogfish beers, Stone beers like Vertical epic, The abyss.....etc... This beer has upheld its long reputation.  Most IPA's have to much weird citrus, earthy bitterness,  or are to malty sweet, etc.  Pliny has all the hop flavors I enjoy like sharp citrus, grapefruit, fruity, sticky resinous  pine but all in a harmonious marriage of pale and copper malts.  As IPAs get bigger and "better" I find that higher abv seems to equal sweeter.  Pliny is a great balance of hops and malt, not overly sweet or overly hopped.","IPA1978","Sep 11, 2014"

4.75,1.9,,,,,,"Went to look for a certain pumpkin ale today and saw people walking out of the cooler with these! Pours a crystal clear amber with short head that leaves a bubbly slick as it dies down. Nose on this is out of control - super citric orange peel and tropical fruit mixed with a soft floral aroma. Taste is solid all the way through, you get a quick bite up front, some spice and citrus in the middle and a lingering resiny bitterness on the back end; this beer hits it all. The alcohol at 8% is barely noticeable, but does leave you with a nice warming sensation in the belly. Mouthfeel is medium with a delicate champagne like carbonation. Overall I think this is a great West Coast IIPA, but I prefer a little more malt balance, and I'd say FW Union Jack is comparable if you can't find this. I really never expected to see it anywhere so pretty stoked to have tried it!","BeerWizard","Sep 05, 2014"

4.32,-7.3,4.5,5,4,4,4.25,"I have to say that even though this is clearly a really good beer, it's not without equal. In fact, I would argue that these days it has many equals. The strong bitterness of the hop profile is a little harsh and detracts ever-so-slightly from appreciating the nuances encompassed within the rest of the experience on the palate. The huge pine notes intermingled with citrus and hints of grass and tropical fruit are wonderful when detectable, though. Also, the malt profile does the beer no favors. The slight sourdough notes and marginally excessive maltiness again detract a little from the overall experience. Frankly, my favorite part of the Pliny experience is the aroma, which is amazing and unimpeachable. I know I'm splitting hairs and will gladly acknowledge that this beer is fantastic, but I just don't think it's worth the hype.","acread","Aug 11, 2014"

If it didn't taste good I'm not going to pretend it did just because of the name wrapped around the bottle. With that being said, I was a little disappointed. I have another one in the fridge, so after a second taste another review is definitely in order.","Burntknuckles","Jul 30, 2014"

Hops, grain, malt.. they finely crafted this one in every sense of the word. Head was a little light, but tight foams. Mouthfeel was very good for the hops which blended perfectly. finish was smooth. Is it the best beer in America? Um... no. Very very good, I would have it again and was able to buy a couple of bottles at a nearby store (2 bottle limit), but does it live up to the hype? Nope. The marketing strategy (and the limits on purchase) were brilliant and they have feed into the hype very well.... being from Utah it was my mission (pun intended) to find this beer and see for myself.. but honestly.. I think there must be a better beer out there somewhere (and for the styles I prefer, I have found a few)..","Curtis","Jul 29, 2014"

Great malt backbone with a bitter hop bite that keeps you coming back for more. The alcohol is well hidden, making this one of the more drinkable DIPAs out there. Heady Topper or Pliney, that's a tough choice!","bneel317","Jul 14, 2014"

5,7.3,5,5,5,5,5,"This has been one of my favorite beers for years, never got around to giving it a real rating, before, but I absolutely love this beer.  It is the perfect double IPA.  Very strong hops, explosion of crisp flavor in the mouth, yet it never gets too heavy by the end of the glass.  Truly fantastic beer and the epitome of the style in my mind.  The look, smell, taste, crisp feel;  Its all fantastic.","MikeSJbeers","Jul 12, 2014"

I had this on my trip to the brewery while visiting San Fran.. was worth the trip up there to santa rosa.. the flight at the brewery is insane 16+ beers.. they make a lot of good stuff.. hope to get back there soon.. highly recommend trying this beer if you can get a trade for it or get up there yourself to visit.","Kustom01","Jun 22, 2014"

Lemon, orange, and pine taste, but all subtle. This beer feels light and drinkable for 8% ABV. Perfect bitterness, and possibly the best balanced brew I have experienced. My wife, who generally hates double IPAs actually enjoyed this. Truly an awesome beer, lacking only the wow factor to make it my #1.","RobbDogg","Jun 15, 2014"

4.7,0.9,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.75,"Poured from bottle into RR bubble pint. Right off, this is a great looking beer. Crystal clear, nice 2 fingers of head that stick around and sticks to the glass as you sip. The nose sells this beer for me. Pine and citrus, especially grapefruit. Taste follows nose for me. Big hops, but in a very well balanced format. Not the hoppiest DIPA in the world, but it might be the most balanced and well done. Love this beer and I am not disappointed after hearing a lot of good stuff about it.","slackattack","Jun 14, 2014"

Normally, I'm not an IPA fan, but the fruity blend of hops here is so excellent - it's perfectly balanced with strong, sweet malt that keeps the aggressive hop flavor in check. The aftertaste was a bit strong, but that was easily remedied with another sip. The worst part of this beer is that it will be gone soon and I'll have to wait until I can reserve another!","Antnego","Jun 14, 2014"

I'm not really sure what else I can say about this beer that hasn't already been said many many times over. It is a near perfect example of a west coast style double ipa. It has a huge nose of citrus, dank, and tropical fruit. Excellent bitterness level and hop flavor that matches what is expected based on the aroma. It has a low amount of body and a fairly dry finish as I believe all west coast ipas should have. The first time I tried this beer was after a day of hiking in the north cascades and it changed my life and my outlook on what an IPA should taste like.

Opened a few weeks old bottle and poured into a tulip and saw a great 1.5 finger head form with great retention. Giving it a nice whiff you get a great scent for pine and other citrus notes. I had high expectations about this beer and after tasting it I can honestly say that they were meet. Not bitter at all very smooth and goes down at a relatively quick rate which can be a problem since its about 8%. I think the best part of this beer is that the more you drink it the more you enjoy it. It is consistently good and stays at the top of my top beers.

When you make a trade for Pliny, it sits in a hot truck on its trek hundreds/thousands of miles.

A frothy white head sat atop the beautiful liquid. Some lacing was left as the head quickly dissipated. The nose and the taste are typical of west coast IPAs. Citrusy fruit flavors swirl around the mouth. It goes down smooth and it is not overly bitter. Very flavorful and very smooth.

Some people say it's overhyped, which I don't agree with, but it depends on what type of beer you like. If you're an IPA fan and you think this beer is overhyped then I don't sympathize. But if IPA's aren't your thing then I can see how you might not appreciate it as much as someone like me who drinks almost exclusively IPA's. It is so perfectly balanced and smooth. Hoppy, citrusy, fresh, and perfect all come to mind every time I have a Pliny.","wcoastbeerlover","Apr 17, 2014"

The head is thick, bone white, frothy and long lasting. Plus there is silky lacing for days. The nose is dank and citrusy. An abundance of grapefruit, pine, grass, mango, and tangerines abound. The mouthfeel is great but I'd actually like it to be a bit stickier. The flavor is a balanced bomb of west coast hops; taking all the notes of the nose and making them shine even more. This is mist certainly one of (if not the) best dipa I've ever had. Just wish it'd show its face in Michigan more often.","lochef81","Apr 14, 2014"

I grew up in Escondido, California, and saw Stone grow from a roll up garage to a big, pleasant machine. Enjoy By is good, but I think Pliny the Elder is a tad better. It may be because I drink Enjoy By often, or it might be because the Pliny was fresh. These two beers are comparable, I love both of them. That is why I brought some home to Washington.","mabermud","Apr 07, 2014"

4.18,-10.3,4,4.75,4,4,4,"t + o: taste follows nose as you get a burst of nice citrus followed by pine and dankness. there is an underlying sweetness from the malt that is refreshing but not cloying. the bitterness level is much lower than most current ipa's. the problem with reviewing pliny these days is it tastes like a typical west coast ipa. I would probably pick sculpin above this if blindfolded, and I can think of a few more ipa's that I like more. but here's the thing - the reason all those other ipa's taste like this is because they ALL copied this. it is the blueprint, the archetype. I think this beer along with boston ale are the two most important American beers in history. without this, no IPA's and no explosion of interest in them. so although the rest of the field has caught up, I have great respect for this beer.","itsratso","Apr 05, 2014"

It's just scary good and it oozes class. The sort of world class liquid we all strive to find. I am amazed every single time I have this, and we are lucky to have such a grand offering available in the world of craft beer today. Pliny the Elder is a treat and I look forward to drinking this again soon. If you love dipa's then you must seek this one out! It's just one of those experiences everyone should have at some point.

As soon as I saw it we realized the first one was the wrong beer. They have Damnation on tap as well and mistakenly given me one of those. The Elder pours a darker golden color with about a finger of off white foam. It didn’t linger long but did leave a little lacing. The nose was huge! Lots of grapefruit and pine notes. Hard to smell the malts, but can faintly pick some up. The taste is excellent! Hops are not overpowering. Big malt body. Extremely well balanced. An extremely good beer.","Boto","Feb 23, 2014"

The hop aroma was strong and citrusy, with a light malt note to back that up. The flavor really matched the aroma well with no huge surprises. The dry finish and lack of alcohol warming makes this beer deceptively smooth and easy to drink, perhaps the most dangerous of the ones I tried. Folks not prepared for this alcohol content could put down a few of these before realizing just how strong they are! I have tried the bigger brawnier brother (Pliny the Younger) and that one takes it to the next level--more in line with a lot of the recent additions to the pantheon.","Jackofallbrews","Feb 06, 2014"

The hop taste I'm left with is neither overpowering nor is it fleeting and disappointing. For me, most IPAs I can only have 2 of before I feel I have "wrecked" my palate for the evening. Having recently just had Zombie Dust, which is so smooth that you almost don't notice you're drinking a hoppy craft beer, I feel that Pliny succeeds at not being too smooth so you can still recognize the craftsmanship and hops.","Bartos","Jan 24, 2014"

To start with, Pliny looks nearly as good as you could imagine in the glass. The nose is citrusy and inviting, but too tame and subtle for me. Taste follows the nose. Mouthfeel is very nice; medium-bodied and extremely smooth. Pliny is very balanced and an overall excellent beer; however, there are several IPAs I would recommend over Pliny, that are much easier to find. Good beer but don't jump through hoops to get it, and don't swallow all the hype.","gregb13","Jan 19, 2014"

On the palate, strong pine and grapefruit/citrus florals with huge hops balance well with smooth malts. Maintains head & lacing throughout. Moderate carbonation. Mouthfeel is full and thick.

The taste hits every note from the smell and is long and yum(couldn't think of better word there). The mouthfeel is light but rich and all the taste permeates.

The head lasts nicely, but does mellow down from its initial height to about a half-finger’s width. As the head dissipates, it leaves a nice sticky patchwork of lacing on the glass. In body the beer is crystal clear and clean, but does present a slight haze from the malt. On the nose, the beer smells of citrus and spicy pine. Floral and herbal notes dance around the edges of the nose but big citrus tangerine and grapefruit are the primary players in the beer. The nose is not blowing me away, but is just a very solid example of a hoppy beer dank pine and a touch of sweet caramel can also be sensed in the smell. As a whole, the smell tends to remind a little of a fresh pineapple blended with pine. On the tongue, the beer tastes surprisingly balanced. The bitters are big and coat the mouth, but there is a strong bready sweetness to add balance. Light stone fruit notes can be picked out in the hop character, as well. The finish sees the strongest bitter kick, which is a bit over powering and should feed any one’s bitter cravings. Acidity in the beer is light but bright on the sides of the cheeks. Again, this beer tastes like a classic DIPA. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet, candied citrus, expanding into fresh Florida oranges, with a touch of orange peel and rind. Grapefruit, pine needles, and pineapple dance in the back along with the malts superbly balanced sweet caramel bread, which helps to give the hops their candied quality. I wasn’t that taken with this beer on the initial sip, but that was foolish of me. Pliny is a subtle beast, building simple complexity from its hops, and making each sip different. Soft boozy heat can be felt in the back of the throat, but that is just another part of the complexity of this beer. This flavor is one I could sip all night. In the mouth, Pliny feels surprisingly on the light side of medium in body, with a fluffy carbonation that pillows the tongue nicely. Mouthfeel is slick, and crisp, making the beer dangerously easy to drink. Slight astringency can be felt as the beer moves across the tongue leaving the mouth only softly tingling with bitters. Saliva does gently pool in the cheeks, but overall the mouth is left rather clean and ready for further sips. Overall, this beer is a whale worthy of whaling after. Beautiful complexity and subtly make this a beer I could drink several of, which is dangerous for its ABV bracket. Where many of the modern DIPA’s slam you in the face with juicy hop character, Pliny is subtle and perfectly balanced. This will please the hop heads and even those that are skeptical to hops. My mother, a diehard stout fan, but “pale and hoppy beer” hater, actually loved this when I brought one over last night. My only complaint is that the nose is mild compared to some DIPA’s, but to be fair to Pliny, its recipe was developed before the designers of those other DIPA’s even knew they liked hops. Pliny the Elder is a pleasure to drink. I can’t wait to get my hands on more Russian River beers.","Maxwell","Dec 23, 2013"

Aroma is citrusy, grapefruit, very juicy, has some pine too. Tastes like the nose. very smooth and well balanced with the malt. Dont taste any of the alcohol. Overall, I think this is a fantastic DIPA, one of the first and best of its kind. Though slightly overrated, I think the high rating reflects the fact that this came out before most of the newer solid DIPAs in its class. I definitely don't think it's a top 5 beer , or even a top 5 DIPA anymore, but I'm sure it was both of these things just a few years ago. Now that competition in the DIPA arena has gotten tighter, there are so many other worthy competitors to pliny.","Moheban","Dec 20, 2013"

Had it been a little warmer, I would probably prefer Pliny... Looks like Heady by a hair in my opinion. That said, Pliny makes the perfect warm west coast DIPA!","BrewUSA","Nov 18, 2013"

First taste and there's more citrus along with some sweetness that hides a lot of hop. Balances well and is not overpowering.

And the taste, similar, hints of pine, citrus, grapefruit and lemon. Mouthfeel was just perfect. Not too thick, not too thin.

It really took until the second or third time I had it to really appreciate it against all the other hoppy beers I've had. Actually, the first time I had it ON TAP, at the brewpub, was the real revelation for me. The hops are full of both citrus and pine aromas and flavors and each sip allows you to taste a different part of this beer's magnificence.

I am so determined that my short review is quite adequate that I am willing to type out the minimum amount of words in order for this review to be posted. So, I am going to ramble just a bit because I feel that my first 42 words said enough to convince anyone that this beer is absolutely fantastic and should be sought after by any beer enthusiast. Most people specifically describe the appearance, taste, mouthfeel, etc., etc. My take on it is plainly simple. Find it, drink it , relish it, but you may depress over it because it's over and hard to come by.","nabit","Sep 21, 2013"

Being from Chicago, looking forward to my first taste of Pliny. Smell was okay. didn't get the pine smell others mention. Taste is best described as boring. I didn't get any hop bite or tingling or malt sweetness. Definitely easy drinking but that's not what I'm looking for in an 8.0 abv beer. Overall, glad to try but reaffirmed that there are plenty of great local (Midwest) beers to enjoy and much better West Coast options.","HinsdaleILbeerdrinker","Aug 28, 2013"
4.88,4.7,4.75,4.75,5,5,4.75,"Pliny the Elder pours a pale amber, lighter than expected, with a white, fluffy head that dissipates quickly. Not much lacing but that may be more because of the shaker pint it was served in. Aroma is big and fruity, lots of grapefruit, pine, and lemon. Grapefruit and pineapple hit the front of the tongue. Finishes dry. Mouthfeel can best be described as smooth, medium-light bodied with light carbonation, drinks much easier than its 8% ABV. Overall, this is one of the smoothest, easiest drinking Imperial IPAs out there. Outstanding job Russian River.","JohnG190","Aug 28, 2013"

I've had big IPA's with a lot more going on flavour-wise. In reality though, I know this isn't really a bad thing at all - the hops flavour is fresh and great, and thus complexity isn't going to improve the beer necessarily. I've never had an IPA before with the elegant balance and big body that Pliny has, glad I got the opportunity to do so.","JasonLovesBeer","Aug 27, 2013"

If they could sneak in just a little bit of counterpoint and ease off the carbonation just a touch, the beer would be perfect. Definitely worth a special trip to get your hands on this beer. Kudos to the staff at Russian River on a truly great beer.","Libationguy","Aug 11, 2013"

Poured into a Kenai River Brewing Pint and man this beer really is one of the best in the world. When something is hyped this month it is hard to really enjoy it, but this really is the standard by which all other West Coast DIPAs are judged and rightly so. It was already almost two months old, so I must say I don't think I have had the full experience, but man... The head was a little thin and the smell wasn't quite as expressive as I would have liked, but the flavor was really exactly what you want for the style, truly a hop heads dream.","oceanman907","Aug 11, 2013"

4.85,4.1,4.75,4.75,5,4.75,4.75,"Pliny looks amazing. A perfect yellow/amber/pale orange color with half an inch of white bubbly head. It has fantastic lacing as well. Sticky globules that hang onto the sides of the tulip. Aroma is wonderful too. Very floral and sweet. I love the hop balance. Lots of orange scents, with maybe a touch of lemon zest. Very floral, reminds me of this tiny yellow flower that grows here in FL. It also has the faintest hint of pine, which I normally don't like, but seems to be done really well in this beer. But where this beer shines is really in the taste. It reminds me of Six Point's Bengali Tiger. Well balanced, hoppy/sweet combo and delicious. Pliny somehow takes this all up a notch! Everything I get from the nose, is doubled on my tongue, and in the best of ways. There is also the slightest of biscuity flavor too. Mouthfeel is simple, bubbly, very lightly creamy, and the hops do not attack my taste buds. I love this about Pliny. Most IPAs will sting your tongue with the aggressive hops. Also, this beer hides the 8% ABV extremely well; not as well as Compass from ST, but very very well. It drinks like a great single IPA.","mverity","Aug 05, 2013"

Bad news was they limited it to one glass per person (was not loving that). Good news was the WOW factor. This beer is everything I expected it to be. Huge fruit bomb in the nose...super smooth drinkability with a variety of tropical fruits (too many to list going on here), hops, and some subtle bread notes. The hops were not at all overbearing as I sometimes find with this style of beer. The flavors were so balanced and tasty...This is without a doubt the best Double IPA I have ever had and could have easily drank this all afternoon despite the 8%.

Color was golden, Smell was wonderful with a nice hop forward, citrusy piney character and a hint of malt flavor. Mouthfeel was a little weak, but offset by the outstanding taste which was very hop foward , pleasantly bitter and just sweet enough with a malty finish and the alcohol is hidden well. My first from Russian River which I wish were available in my area. Nice to start with one of their best. It is hard to compare to other great DIPA's but it has to be one of the most balanced DIPA's I've had. Enjoyed with jambalaya and crawfish pie, a great pairing.","utah44","Jul 31, 2013"

3.94,-15.5,4,3.75,4,4,4,"Overall, this is a really solid double IPA. Currently the third highest rated beer on BeerAdvocate.com, I really had to keep my expectations in check on this one as I had been trying to get my hands on a bottle ever since I became an IPA junkie about a year ago. At first it didn't really blow me away. The aroma, while pleasant, wasn't really unique or particularly outstanding in any way. The taste was similar in that it was certainly enjoyable but nothing terribly interesting or exclusive. But then the beer warmed up a bit and surprisingly revealed itself as the extremely balanced and well-made beer that it is. It's not a hop bomb like so many IPAs released today. Instead, it quietly impresses you with its subtlety and balance. Despite this, I have to admit that it does fall short of the legendary hype but through no fault of it's own. It's still a beautifully made beer that I wound never turn down and if more easily available, would be a staple in my fridge.","WolfsbaneBloom","Jun 23, 2013"

Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, floral, pineapple, honey, light caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, tangerine, floral, pineapple, grass, pine, honey, light caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, honey, light caramel, floral, grass, pine, bread, and floral earthiness. Awesome balance and complexity of hop flavors with a moderate malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, sticky, and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent DIPA! Great hop flavor complexity and moderate malt balance; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering; but certainly not near the hype it gets.","superspak","Jun 19, 2013"

The MO blew it out of the water. The malts in this Pliny were definitely accentuated and the citrusy, tropical hops were not that present. I would love to get this relatively fresh so I can reassess and regrade this Titan of Industry.","ironchefmiyagi13","Jun 13, 2013"

The hops, of course, were front and center. But it did not nearly have the usual "hop blast" that every other DIPA I've ever had has. My wife, who tastes every beer I give her, usually makes a "scrunchy" face over the bitterness of the DIPAs I give her to try. This one, even she said is really good. This is a phenomenal beer. If I ever get a chance to buy multiple bottles of this, I wouldn't hesitate for a second, no matter how much it costs, to buy as many bottles of this as I could.","BrianJohnson","Jun 08, 2013"

Lots of brews focus on single areas, but this one excels in all areas of the taste (the initial sweetness, the bready mid-tastes, and the hop finish.) It does all this without tasting boozy and the smell accurately represents the taste. All of this is accomplished with a mouthfeel that doesn't fatigue the drinker.

3.2,-31.3,4,3.25,2.75,4.25,3.25,"This was my second DIPA (had Lagunitas Maximus in bottle the prior day). Was out in the Bay Area so drove up to Santa Rosa to try it right at the source - the Russian River Brewpub. Had a pint at the bar before dinner. It was definitely unique but not something I would seek out for future drinking. For me it finished too bitter and like the other DIPA I had (Lagunitas Maximus) had a hint of something rank on hitting the tongue. Comparing the two it was definitely preferable to the Lagunitas with more interesting flavor components and a smoother mouthfeel. I ended up getting a sampler of all 15 beers they had on tap after this pint, and ended up preferring several of their other beers (Perdition, OVL Stout, almost everything except the sour ales). Obviously YMMV and if you like DIPAs I can only assume you'll love this. Thinking about my preferences, I'd take a good Bock/Eisbock/Barleywine in the cooler months and a tasty Hefeweizen/Lager in the warmer months over Pliny any day. I'd still be up for trying a pint of Younger if I am around here in February just to make sure this tasting wasn't a fluke.","Nektar-der-Gotter","May 05, 2013"

An excellent beer, but not nearly as incredible as I thought it might be. I feel the aroma and look of this beer may be some of its most impressive characteristics. Dry, earthy, tart, yet sugary and delicious, this beer is a great Double India Pale Ale. I think it is fairly obvious that most of the beer nerds out there like to boast of Pliny's rarity and perhaps feel extra privileged to take part in the hype. It is very hard to find and I am fortunate enough to finally get my hands on it after approximately 4 years of searching. Do not get me wrong, this is an exceptional beer in its style, but definitely overhyped due to how hard it is to come by. Also important to note: there are plenty of other amazing IPAs and DIPAs out there that rival this specific beer. Overall, this does not disappoint. Pliny, you are delicious.","Agent1","Apr 19, 2013"

Its balance and flavors are so good, and are still considerably unique among so many beers even after all these years. May be my favortite beer during the summer time. Such a fresh, clean flavor profile. Simcoe hops are balanced perfectly. The slight champagney mouthfeel gives you a deliciously refreshing beginning with a semi-dry finish that begs for another gulp. The smell is good, but does not represent the beers taste and overal experience. I did notice the hop smells came through more as it warmed up a bit, but this beer should be served colder them most IPA's. I recently had PTY and although it was a great beer, (basically a bigger version of elder), I think Elder is a better beer as for as craft goes.","bkeach","Apr 19, 2013"

First, I have history with it. I have had a lot of Heady and associate some great memories with it. I'd be lying if I didn't admit this was a factor. But second, I love Heady's viscosity, its dense, dirty look and feel, and it's substantial sweet backbone that Pliny lacks.

Had this in my Hill Farmstead tulip glass. Pours a nice looking pale ale with a nice head that with moderate lacing that sticks to the glass, creating nice layers with every sip. The initial aroma is floral and super hoppy, but fades quickly. The light body holds only an initial hop flavor that fades quickly as your pallet declines with the bitter bite of the hops, and the flavor just seems bland after the first 2 sips. No real complaints with this beer, except that it didn't live up to the hype. Definitely a very good beer, but I would not go out of my way to have this. 4.27/5","Sambr0n1","Apr 07, 2013"

The aroma is that of resiny hops and citrus. Pretty standard, but still well done. The taste puts any fears to rest I had of this not living up to the hype down pretty quickly. It brings in a strong grapefruit flavor at first, with some tropical flavors in the middle leading to a big, resiny, piney finish that lingers for an eternity. The mouthfeel is smooth and medium-bodied, and the drinkability is exceptional. Overall, Pliny the Elder is an excellent double IPA. Highly enjoyable and highly recommended.","shand","Apr 05, 2013"

4.28,-8.2,4,4,4.25,4.75,4.5,"Poured a clearish orange gold body with monster two-finger head that died slow and left lace everywhere the whole beer. Huge hop aroma of sticky, wet, earthy hops with that familiar grapefruit and citric/clovey spice hop zip, along with some sweet or plush tropical fruit smell that is a tad noticeable and there is a touch of some caramel and/or bready malt. Beer is medium-bodied, easy to drink, incredibly smooth for the amout of hops in there and it packs a lot. Almost chewey and a dangerous session ale since you can't even pick up any alcohol, this beer is the exception of most DIPAs in that instead of crushing/drying out your tastebuds it wets them and leaves you wanting more. Not only are there the strong grape/citric hops flavors with spice but there is a sweetness to this beer that gives it nice balance and a strong, bready crackerlike malt backbone that holds everything up and what a delicious finish. For everything I heard about this beer it was definitely worth the wait.","clayrock81","Apr 05, 2013"

This beer has a golden-red, rather clear hue. A small white head. An amazing citrus smell that you know is gonna taste good, just from one sniff. Taste is very crisp, refreshing, and citrusy. Grapefruit mostly, with medium body. Could drink a lot of these in a single sitting. I still give an edge to Gandhi Bot as slightly better tasting, because as a local, I have my biases =), but I liked Pliny so much, I thought I would add to the chorus of complimentary reviews. Worth the hype in my opinion, of course I was lucky and didn't have to wait in a line or trade to get a taste, very fortunate on my part. Right bar, right time.","braugon","Apr 01, 2013"

Nothing could be further from the truth. This beer is simply fantastic. It puts all of my other favorite DIPAs to shame. It pours a rich golden amber that is perfectly transparent, with some bubbles effervescing. It has a nice thick dense, white head with great retention and lacing. The smell is amazing: fresh pineapple, mango, hops and grapefruit. The definition of fresh. The taste follows suit: sour citrus up front, some sweet caramel and mango in the middle with some herbal hints, and resiny hops to finish it off. Absolutely no booze. Silky smooth, crisp and refreshing. This beer is simply fantastic, and considering its price point, and availability (check local listings), I would go on a limb to say it is probably the best beer overall on the planet right now.","Samuel906","Mar 22, 2013"

There is a lot of hop bite but the juicy tropical flavors that jump out at you in more substantial DIPAs are there to a much lesser extent and they are subdued by the carbonation. This beer would be nice served extra cold and it would pair well with buffalo wings or mexican food. I would not recommend giving it to anyone as an example of a DIPA, as there are American IPAs that are less bitter yet have more hop aroma and flavor. It is, however, very consistent. I have had dozens of PTEs and they taste similar from draft to bottle, and whether they were bottled 5 days ago or a month ago.","flyingtoaster","Mar 20, 2013"

Heady is hazy, resiny and just blasts you with hop aroma and taste. This is more subtle. It's about a lot of great flavors mixed together with skill and subtlety and while I could drink this one with regularity, I think the days of it being at the top of the DIPA crowd are about over.","dougfur","Feb 28, 2013"

At the same time, it is gaining some pretty fierce competitors. First example: Lagunitas sucks, a beer with a very similar hop profile and a clear filtered character, which is more readily available and less hyped up (which is probably why it has lower ratings). Another example would by heady topper, which in a side by side test would defeat PtE in my opinion. It's raw, unfiltered character gives it the one-up on PtE. Don't get me wrong, this is an EXCELLENT DIPA worth trying and I'm jealous of those who can get it on the regzzz.","gcamparone","Feb 24, 2013"

They give you the bottling date on the bottle...mine was 1/29; tasted today 2/16. Vinny says don't put it away to age or the hops will fade.","brodericksloth","Feb 16, 2013"

4.92,5.6,5,4.75,5,4.75,5,"To date one of the top beers that I've drank. Clarity on the beer is ridiculous, and has a great orange amber hue. Aroma to me is floral. Taste is awesome, everything a double IPA should be, bitter, piney and aggressive. What makes this beer different for me is the smoothness as well and after a lot of hops it has a very smooth and clean finish with some lingering bitterness. Overall an incredible beer that I wish was more accessible and not so difficult to get. Got a few brought back from cali from a co-worker on a business trip. Had a another friend out that way this weekend and he was having difficulty finding it. This beer gives you a great excuse to take a trip out to the bay area.","RollTide7","Feb 16, 2013"

Lovely huge piney scent when poured from the bottle, Excellent two finger head with great lacing, Light light golden color with huge points for clarity, and the taste...oh the taste! Super hop forward with tons of spice with a long bitter, but mellow finish. Seems like drinking hop nectar. This beer is certainly tops for West coast IPA's and really has forced me to rediscover the whole style. I'd drink this when and where ever i can find it!","sketchpunx","Feb 10, 2013"

They proclaimed that this was the best beer ever in that bar. He carries some serious Belgium Ales and microbrews on tap from around the world. It was unanimous. Blown away with the Row 2 Hill 56. They identified the unusual hop taste. I told them about the Simcoe Hop only grown in Wakima Washington by 4 families. These guys certainly know their beer.","Five-0","Feb 10, 2013"

Aroma comes off this thing like heaven. Floral pine notes abound, with a zesty citrus on the nose. Thr flavor is a piney orange bite with a lot more body than I had expected. Citrus aftertaste balanced nicely with the malt backbone that still highlights that great hop flavor. Medium resiny mouthfeel. Very smooth. Hop candy for sure. Highly rated for good reason.

I won't go into a lot of detail because it's been so long, just the things that stuck out. The smell was amazing! I know lots of people talk about it but it was amazing. Sooo much Simcoe. As far as the hop taste, it makes it very evident that hop profile is more than just IBU's. Definitely big on Simcoe but I suspect Columbus, Centennial and maybe Cascades.

Great finish transitioning from the sweetness of the malt to the hop bite at the end. Medium body with good level of carbonation. Unbelievably easy to drink for the style (had 4 that day) and well balanced. A fantastic offering from Russian River.","ScottieD","Dec 01, 2012"

I wasn’t impressed with Dark Lord, either. There is too much hype over beers like that. Maybe that is what spoils it for me. Not sure. But Pliny the Elder is just that… a hyped beer that doesn’t live up to the hype. BeerAdvocate rates this 100. So do the bros. Would love to discuss this beer with them further.

Full flavor, very clean finish. It bites but than smooths like butter. It is actually a little strange. The fruit makes it sweet but hops make it bite. This beer stands out from your centennial, cascade blast of most. It is full of love! I never give a five! Hint of fresh juice and maybe a sweet flower. Simcoe maybe but just enough. The malt could be thinner for color but I love the power so I am just fine with it. Fresh beer! To say the least.","Intumemedical","Nov 22, 2012"

With a beautiful crystal clear rich golden appearance, there was a frothy one finger head, a little bit of lacing, and a constant stream of bubbles rising to the top. The nose was fruit, grass, resin, bread, malt, and hops. Taste was awesome. It had a wonderful sweet malt profile which seamlessly gave way to a massive hop bomb on the finish. The mouthfeel was very full and satisfying, with just the right amount of carbonation. I have never gave all fives to a beer before, but this one earned it.","Mojo","Nov 22, 2012"

What I will say is that it isnt overly distinctive, rather I found its real appeal in how well it was put together. Unlike Heady Topper or Double Citra which are wonderfully artful and unique beers, Pliny the Elder seems less creative yet amazingly thought out and well planned, like amish furniture. A perfect balance and of malt and hops, both playing off each other. Sort of a fusion east coast/west coast IPA. Good body, if maybe a little thin, and lively but not intrusive carbonation. Really just perfect. This beer doesnt stike me as being a centerpiece and while Heady Topper seems somehow more interesting, I dont think you could really do too much better than Pliny the Elder.","jmaharaj","Nov 10, 2012"

This is more about hops and less of the maltiness that some of the DFH IPAs are known for, and that's not a bad thing. It's different, and amazing in its own right.

4.92,5.6,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"So is it worth all the hype? It'd depend on the style you frequent most, with this being the godfather of the double ipas. Though I find my nine hour pilgrimage every couple months to be worth it, friends and family who aren't too into beer say it's simply "alright," which honestly is probably the best you can hear from someone who hasn't developed a palate for dipas or craft beer in general. All in all there's a reason it's the #5 top all time beer, if you drink a lot of ipas this is probably the biggest 'must try' on your bucket list.","lordofstarside","Oct 20, 2012"

But no, this is perfection in its subtleties, in its sublime BALANCE, that ever-important elusive quality... I am being honest in marking down aroma and taste to 4.5, but this bottle is over a month old and I have this deep-seated feeling that it IS a 5, when just a bit fresher.... indeed the brewer's labeling suggests this.

Incredibly easy to drink and extremely tasty, I am very happy that I was able to finally indulge in this world glass beer.

4.68,0.4,5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"This beer is just over a month old, so hopefully it is still fresh ;-) Pours a clear golden orange, with a hint of red highlights if held in the right light. The aroma is primarily lightly caramelized sugar and some grapefruit rind. There is also a hint of mint. The taste begins with a huge candied apricot flavor. Next is a dry table water cracker malt middle. The finale is an herbal, super citrusy toungue wrench... In a good way of course. Every few sips you get a burst of super sweet pineapple in the beginning. Mouthfeel is rich, despite how dry a DIPA this is. Overall an exceptional DIPA. I will say that Pliny the Elder is not my personal favorite DIPA, however, its not surprising to see it ranked so highly. You really can't go wrong here.","tronester","Aug 28, 2012"

5,7.3,5,5,5,5,5,"It is what it is. Much hyped, and much anticipated to drink when I received this bottle with care from the northwest coast. After taking the bottle out of my beer refrigerator, I allowed it to get to a bit above 50 degrees (I wasn't going to pair this with anything but tasty cheese, bleu and aged cheddar in this case). My wife happened to have made a nice salad of corn, cilantro, tomato, black and garbanzo beans etc. Anyway, the pour, a beautiful golden haziness. Vivid white fluffy head. The smell, as great as any other regarded IPA I've enjoyed (citrus/piney splendor). Artful lacing in the Chimay chalice used here. When I tasted this I immediately realized this is a benchmark brew. The balance is impeccable for a hoppy ale. Bitter sure. And the malt is there, but everything else is too and it is well, well done. Like I said a benchmark. Drinkability off the charts. If i have to pick one bottled beer that epitomizes quaffability, thus far this is it. I can only hope to vacation in northern CA soon in order to sample the Younger!! The only disappointment I had, and it's nothing that can impact the perfect scoring, is that I only have one of these! But then again that's all I need to realize PTE deserves the cult-like status it possesses. As a double IPA, everything is right-on.","TBoneJones","Jul 21, 2012"

If you don't see it, trade for it. Whatever you do, try some fresh Pliny the Elder. From what I've seen, beer doesn't get much better than this.","adam42381","Jul 05, 2012"

Sweet malts, citrus and a hint of pineapple. You know there are some nice malts underneath, but they stay below detectable levels supporting the spicy hops flavor. A beautifully balanced IPA.

Great, golden appearance with just the right carbonation. Wonderful, grapefruit nose with all the things you love about hoppy beers and none of the stuff that scares you away.

5,7.3,5,5,5,5,5,"There is quite a bit of hype surrounding this beer and it is nearly impossible to get on the East Coast. My tasting notes: Rich amber, slightly cloudy with medium carbonation. Strong piney hops on the nose. Tastes crisp and pleasantly bitter, very refreshing; not overpowering like many other American double IPAs. 8% alcohol, but very smooth, no strong fusel notes. Extremely well balanced with pine and citrus notes dominant. One if the best beers I've had in a long time. If we lived where this is distributed, Pliny would enjoy an honored place in the beer fridge. Salud!!","MAUEX_MFA","Jun 15, 2012"

A sweet, fruity aroma of some grapefruit and its sugars, its rinds, and a nice malt underbelly that gains in influence as the beer warms. Taste follows suit; grapefruit and its sugars, some rind, and a gentle malt underbelly in addition to some floral qualities that show itself throughout. A creamy, silky mouthfeel with some nice activity. Overall, a very nice beer. Perhaps it was simply a case of the tap being fresher but I do think the tap experience was noticeably more enjoyable. No knock on this bottle though which is still really good, and probably would have been better if I didn't have that initial experience to compare it to.","denver10","May 25, 2012"

I was lucky enough to have some fresh bottles sent to me (as fresh as they can be) however I was even more lucky in early January to get a growler set to me the same day it was picked up from the brewery and delivered to me super quickly!!! I can still remember the huge pop of the 2L swing top growler. So from the grower into a tall pilsner glass the color was light orangy brown in color with a thin white head that disappears quickly. The smell is very big and hoppy and sweet. The taste is super balanced with the amount of hop and sweet. All this high ranked IPA are all so hard to rate because they all are so amazing, it's hard to decide which one is better.","bobbypaulson","May 21, 2012"

It didn't live up to the legend it's been made out to be, but I figured that people would exaggerate a bit, and plus because I live near the brewery, it has the whole "local following" aspect as well. I should note however that it is better than similar DIPAs of higher costs (cough cough Double Jack...), at $4.39/ea at my work (when you can find it...). Certainly a good buy if you're in the mood for an IPA. I would even recommend picking this up over most "normal" IPAs because it's drinkable enough that spending the extra dollar or two on the bottle will earn you something that's that much better. If you're considering buying it though, or are ever in the area by the brewery, I would say don't hesitate and just do it. You'll be glad you did.","thebornotaku","May 19, 2012"

5,7.3,5,5,5,5,5,"Overall: The quintessential double IPA, created by the brewer of the first Double IPA, Vinnie Cilurzo. I've had this beer hundreds of times and every time I drink one, I am continuously taken aback by the balance, drinkability and sheer quality of the hops in this beer. There has been many imitations attempted by many craft brewers, but I have yet to taste a single Imperial/Double IPA that toes the delicate line of balancing in your face hops and bready maltiness. Do plenty of other craft brewers make bigger and hoppier beers? Sure, but none can make me appreciate the finer things in life as much as Pliny does. Every craft beer enthusiast needs try a FRESH batch of Pliny straight from the tap.","flayedandskinned","Apr 23, 2012"

It's like a watched pot that never boils. I've never seen a head retain so well. You think you're taunting me beer? Well, guess what, I'm reviewing you on BA, so I've got time. In keeping with the theme of this weekend past, the bouquet is as if a golfer at Augusta National had missed the fairway and ended up in the pine straw. While he waited for his partner to hit his ball, he dropped the big, juicy grapefruit he was eating into the pine straw. Hints of biscut malt come through as well. The mouthfeel is nearly perfect for this style. The oilyness is very pleasing and complimentary to the flavor/aroma. This is a masterfully balanced IPA. Everything works together to deliver a whole-is-greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts experience. It not only involves, it demands the attention of your sight, olfactory, taste, and tactile senses. Pine up front, then some orange citrus, and finishes with some grapefruit. Just a wonderful beer.","DocJitsu","Apr 09, 2012"

My biggest fear with Pliny was that it would turn out to be just another like so many of the rest, and that outside of a slightly fresher taste it wouldn't stand out. I am glad however to find that it actually is unique, with a flavor that isn't quite like anything else I have tasted. It is an amazingly unadulterated liquid form of fresh hop cones, which is pretty awesome. I can now cease scoffing at the masses for hyping this beer up beyond reach, as it truly is a magnificent DIPA. The best? Nearly, but it doesn't quite take gold in my book. I remember a time when this beer could be seen sitting in the cooler at a local store! I never paid any attention to it and by the time I realized what it was, so had the rest of my town, and now it never even makes it onto the floor, and only lasts a day or two when kept out of sight.","allforbetterbeer","Mar 19, 2012"

Smell is great, nothing but a one-stop education in American hops with their citrus, pine, and resin, but its strength is also its weakness; I feel like there could be more depth to the hop bouquet. I don't believe DIPAs need to be one dimensional on the nose, since in my opinion the best ones certainly aren't when it comes to flavor. Taste is a perfect balance of towering hop bitterness on a firm malt foundation, not too sweet, not too dry; while this is obviously a thoroughly bitter beer, the rest of the elements keep it in check and prevent it from overwhelming the palate. Goes down nice and smooth, just a little overcarbonated, but that isn't an entirely a bad thing as it kept my pace more toward where it should be. Overall, an absolutely stunning beer, a must-have, not the undisputed greatest double IPA I've ever had, but it is certainly fairly high up on the list.","kc44","Mar 19, 2012"

I've had many amazing beers, many of which are DIPAs, since I first drank this beer. I'll probably rank this highest, because it is in perfect balance and tastes incredible without overwhelming with hops (definitely still a hop monster, though!). This is a beer that I'd die to have easy, regular access to. It has a drinkability that these other world class IPAs (other than Double Sunshine) don't quite have. I could drink this like water and be on cloud nine. Drinking pints and pints of Heady Topper could be a bit taxing, as that's one aggressive beer.","greenmonstah","Feb 20, 2012"

I prefer this beer on draft by a small margin but it’s certainly exceptional in the bottle as well. Doesn’t necessarily stand head and shoulders above a handful of other DIPAs but gets all the attention nonetheless. Hard to say anything is better at this level of brewing achievement, just slightly different. The best of Kern, Alpine, the Alchemist, etc. are on par but if you like IPAs and DIPAs this is not one to be missed.","tobelerone","Feb 01, 2012"

This is one of the best smelling beers I have ever had absolutely huge piney aroma that smacks you in he face then a hint of some citrus. Taste follows the nose perfectly huge pine flavor right off the bat then some citrus and finally just a touch of sweetness from the malt. I wish there was a touch more sweetness to this but still its pretty outstanding. Mouthful is good for me its thin compared to other DIPA beers that are out there, and the carbonation is on point. This is a great beer I wished we could get some in Indiana at a price point of about $5 for a little over a pint I think this would be a great once a week beer to grab off the shelve if you could.","phisigben","Jan 09, 2012"

However, for me, a huge DIPA fan, this beer has always been a bit of a disappointment. I just don't understand the massive hype it gets, and when drinking it next to Heady Topper, it really pales in comparison. I'll always gladly drink Pliny, but the days of going out of my way for it are long gone.","starrdogg","Dec 17, 2011"

I poured this magnificent brew into a sniffer glass and was rewarded with a medium golden colored brew that gave a fingers worth of fluffy white head and good lacing. The well balanced aroma's of citrus, grass and pine pleasantly greet your nose. The taste is amazing, the crispness of citrus was perfectly balanced with a strong malt backbone that left a slightly sharp aftertaste on the tongue. Despite having a relatively high IBU count and above average ABV, this beer is extremely drinkable. I can't help but think, this is the perfect DIPA!","Topher78","Dec 09, 2011"

The beer pours a pale straw color with thin white head that is lacing. The smell is fresh hop with pine foundation, in addition there is some caramel malt undertones. The taste is very balanced between malt and hop...very smooth. Once the drink goes down a pine followed by grapefruit finish on the pallet. The mouthfeel is full bodied with minimal carbonation. Overall the beer is fantastic.","WoodBrew","Nov 24, 2011"

Instead it's quite balanced. Good hop bitterness throughout but not overpowering at all. Nice tones of grapefruit, a honey warmness from the alcohol (8%). For an IPA it's creamy as well. Honestly, for such a big IPA, it's extremely drinkable. It finishes very cleanly with just a bit of bitterness on the tongue. And an earthy exhale of pine and clove.","skinny0ne","Nov 19, 2011"

This has been (for years) one of my favorite beers and even as my palate has grown it has stayed one of my favorites.

4.35,-6.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The taste is awesome! It's tart and prickly from the hops, but still maintains a nice malty smoothness with cookie-like flavors underneath the bite. I get big flavors of lemon, grapefruit, and kiwi with some subtle hints of biscuit, honey, and butter underneath. It has a nice, firm mouthfeel without being creamy. It lacks that sweetness that a few IIPAs have that can make them taste medicinal. I didn't drink another beer this night because I wanted to see if I'd still be tasting this one the next day (I did).","deadonhisfeet","Nov 13, 2011"
4.89,4.9,4,5,5,4.5,5,"Overall - This is, without a doubt, completely deserving of a world class rating within the DIPA category!

Strong, bitter grapefruit and pineapple that is nicely balanced out by bready malts. Rings along the side of the tulip glass all the way down. So drinkable for a double IPA. Not usually my favorite style, but this beer won me over. World class, a must try.","Jacobob10","Nov 11, 2011"
4.77,2.4,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Lives up to the hype which is rare. A citrus/grapefruit bomb, but nicely balanced and very drinkable. Very hoppy and definitely not a sweet DIPA, maybe a bit thin for a DIPA. IMO just a notch below 2008 Hopslam in overall greatness, and much better than the 2008/2010 Hopslam which IMO seemed a tad too sweet. The only problem is obviously distribution and freshness. I would guess most styles like this the hop hit would fade quickly, I'm sure a two month old Pliny wouldn't be as good as as 30 day brew. But by trade or by internet store a must try for any IPA lover, and reasonable too. If I lived in Ca I'd have year round it's that good. Sane ABV levels too.","nc41","Nov 10, 2011"

It was different than most of the IPA’s I’m used to, being from the Midwest. Not bad, just different. I’m not saying I didn’t enjoy the beer but it was not quite what I expected from all the hype that surrounds it. HopSlam is another very hyped up beer but that exceeded the hype for me, this did not. The best I can describe this beer is “Simple Elegance”. No bells, whistles, bourbon or brandy barrel aging. Just straight away hops and kick a$$ IPA.","heysuz","Oct 20, 2011"

I just scored another (fresh) bottle this week and it's certainly better than I remembered. It poured a nice hazy orangy color which I love but others seem to deduct points for. I'm right, they're wrong. The hops and malt seem to be in balance with neither standing above the other. While this is an exceptional DIPA, there are a couple out there that are better (but not many). This is certainly a beer that I would pay a premium for and if it were available to me on a regular basis, I would drink the shit out of it. I like that the price point is reasonable for the quality of the brew.","bwmichaud","Oct 20, 2011"

Probably could be the number one. Theyre rather easy for me to aquire being that i live fairly close to the brewery so i have 5 in the fridge right now. Picked up three today. A great beer and fine DIPA, everyone should at least try this beer. Drinking a fresh opened bottle poured into a pint glass or pilsner glass nice and cold tastes better than the beer on tap.

About 2 fingers of bright white head sits on top of a clear golden beer. Amazing lacing and extremely long lasting head. Aroma is very nice as well. Big grapefruit citrus hop bomb. Very clean, very grapefruit, very citrus. Taste is great as well, clean, pretty dry, very citrus hop forward, with a big bitterness that follows everything else. Very enjoyable. Screw balance, this beer is all about the hops. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light for an 8% beer, with mid-high carb. Overall what a great beer.

Massive sticky lacing on the glass. The smell is bold, a combination of pine and citrus, a very clean aroma that's not overpowering. I'll admit, i don't drink a lot of IPAs or DIPAs, but this beer is extremely tasty. Again, the pine, citrus, grapefruit flavors are all well balanced and work harmoniously. The mouthfeel is crisp, smooth, and for lack of a better word, perfect. Overall, I waited a long time to try this beer, and in fact I had to overpay for it on Ebay just to get it. To say that I was skeptical is an understatement, as this beer has reached mythical status. But I can attest to it's reputation, this is a fine, fine beer.

There is potential for this beer to go down easy, and consume in mass quantities. It is not an IPA, just for the sake of being hoppy. Pliny the Elder is not trying to out-hop other beers.

5,7.3,5,5,5,5,5,"I made tasting this beer a bit of an 'event.' In a Glencairn Scotch glass to get more of the nose... which was a very complex & reminiscent of a spring meadow and sweet nectar. The taste lived up to the hype as well as the amazing aroma- hops of course up front, with a juicy citrus right in the middle of the flavor, finishing nicely with a pleasant bitterness. Did I mention fresh?? it's ever so fresh, it reminds me of drinking the purest bottled water. What's amazing about this beer is how balanced it is, and how the alcohol is masked... almost every IPA is somewhat undrinkable 'all day' in that it is not refreshing - it gives you a dry mouth after a while. This is quite the opposite... What sort of witchery is this??","Neorebel","Sep 15, 2011"
4,-14.2,4,4,4,4,4,"4's on the board. I think this one might have been a little old... probably about 3-4 months old... it was a bit ago and I didn't write down the bottle date so I can't tell you exactly how old it was. Regardless... poured a slightly hazy orange color with a finger of foamy white head that retained pretty well and left a little lacing. The aroma had notes of citrus and piney hops, with some sweet caramel thrown in. Not as much hop aroma as I would've liked, but see above. The taste was nice and balanced, nothing too overly present. There were notes of caramel, pine, citrus and some grassy hops. The mouthfeel was relatively smooth and finished clean. Overall a great beer... would have liked to try a slightly fresher one.","csiewert","Sep 15, 2011"

4.5,-3.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured a golden orange, filtered, with a fluffy white head that fades to some moderate head with great lacing. Nose has some bready grains and pungent citrus hops, unique to anything I've ever put my nose to before. Resiny, tropical fruits and pine all come through in varying degrees. Awesome. Taste has more tropical fruits, bitter pine notes and some sweet maltiness in a lightly sugary way working its magic secondary to the hops. Light alcohol as the sip fades away. Nice medium body, dry finish on every sip. Very bitter finish. Great drinkability, and everything I had expected from this - the gold standard from what I want in a drier DIPA. Fantastic, and I can only imagine this being divine when on tap. Get me more.","liamt07","Sep 06, 2011"

4.89,4.9,4,5,5,4.5,5,"On tap at the Horse Brass in Portland a couple weeks ago. It absolutely lives up to every accolade ever written. Not only is it the most balanced and refreshing IPA I've ever had, but the hop flavors, my god, it was unlike anything I have ever tasted. They melded together into one unified lupulin note that rode a delicious juicy malt wave down my tongue. No harsh bitterness or alcohol present. A true hop artwork that never strays too far in any one direction but stays perfectly focused on its expression of the hop.","sacrelicio","Sep 05, 2011"

4.79,2.8,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"O: Definitely in my top 3 beers of all time, possibly #1. I had this side by side with Pliny the Younger and it's really just about as good.

4.5,-3.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: While this was a solid DIPA, the taste was a little bit of a let down compared to the nose. I was expecting a big, bold hop profile, but it was rather soft and subdued with just a little bitterness. It kind of reminded me of the difference between Hill Farmstead's Citra DIPA and the Abner/Galaxy (Citra soft while Abner/Galaxy was just huge and in your face). Perhaps this is indeed a tame batch, I'll definitely give the next batch another try. Best DIPA I've ever had? Not this bottle, no. Great, but not the best.","Satchboogie","Sep 01, 2011"
4.95,6.2,5,5,5,4.5,5,"I must say this beer was everything and nothing I expected. After enjoying Unearthly from Southern Tier and realizing how amazing its Pineapple and Fresh hops qualities were, I told myself theres no way someone can top this. Pliny did. I know its hyped up, but it deserves to be. I gave the appearance a 5 because I love me some cloudiness. The aroma and taste was there but some about the mouthfeel told me 4.5. However! Definitely a dangerous beer. Do what you can to get it. New Yorkers should pick up Unearthly as a sneak peek. Stay thirsty my friends.","NickRivers","Aug 31, 2011"
3.93,-15.7,4.5,4,4,3,4,"Poured a very nice copper color with excellent head and some very nice lacing. Very nice scent, with a huge hoppiness right up in the nose (pine and some citrus), and some decent maltiness behind it. Nice flavors, with a nice two-row malty sweetness and a huge piney and slight citrusy hop flavor that is very much in front; good overall, but very unbalanced, even considering the style. Goes down fine, but there is quite a bit of hop scratchiness.","JamesS","Aug 31, 2011"
4.59,-1.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O - While I wouldn't say it is the best beer in the country, as Zymurgy magazine boasts, this is definitely a world-class beer. Maybe the best IPA I've had to date, but it's not something godly as some make it out to be. The ABV, though not incredibly high, is quite deceiving. You can easily put back a few of these in quick succession. Highly enjoyable.","matthewb9","Aug 30, 2011"
4.97,6.7,4.5,5,5,5,5,"O - I really see why this is at the top of the list on BA. I've been a huge DIPA fan and I love Stone's offerings, but this just rocks my world. So complex and original in the genre, with its perfect balance and drinkability.","DTJPPR","Aug 29, 2011"

4.7,0.9,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"This beast pours a hazy copper and yellow colored body with about a half inch of foamy, sticky, ghost white head. Ample wet lacing is left in its wake. The nose is greeted with a blast of lemon, grapefruit, other citrus, and hops. Some grass, straw, and piney scents make up the rear. Already, this one screams "big, west-coast DIPA." The taste begins with a rush of bitter hops, pine, and straw before lemon and citrus take over. Really just a well balanced, thought out brew. Being so fresh, the malt is nearly indistinguishable, and that is perfectly fine. I wouldn't change a thing about this tasteful experience. Mouth is crisp, refreshing, hop-sweltering, and finishes a touch dry. Overall, an incredible DIPA that lives up to its legacy.","eclipse54","Aug 28, 2011"

4.85,4.1,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"On-tap at HopMonk in Sonoma. It's a luscious golden amber with light highlights, a firm head and impressive lacing which lasted all the way down the glass. The smell is pine and floral and citrus and the taste is the same--hops hops hops! Hops hops hops! Bitterness! Flowers, citrus, pine! Just a little bit of cracker malt and a long slow dry finish. Lingering spice. I have had a lot of hop bombs before but what sets this apart is the mouthfeel--medium bodied with good carbonation and no alcohol feel or even that much sting, just hoppy goodness. Lives up to the hype.","lstokes","Aug 28, 2011"

They really showcased big citrus in the hop department here, making for not only a robust flavoring, but a unique beer in the sense that it didn’t really blend the hops, but rather had them all sing on their own. This is a standup beer for the style, and is something we could sip the summer away with.","TheBrewo","Aug 18, 2011"

Mouthfeel is very smooth, with the perfect amount of carbonation dancing on your tongue. Overall, I would say this is a very classy brew. Might I add that although this is my first time reviewing Pliny The Elder, I have enjoyed it on numerous occasions. I was lucky enough to try it before I even knew that such a site called Beer Advocate existed, learning off all the hype that surrounded this wonderful brew after my first taste.

I'm not saying this beer lacks a quality scent, I have to say that it is not the best. Flavor as well is greatly balanced, but lacks that bite or punch.

It's a beer I'll hold personally close to me for a good long while, and I'm privileged that I still have full accessibility to it so far. No beer is perfect...

I mean it was a good drinkable DIPA, but doesn't pack much punch, lacks on the alchohol, and lacks on the hops...maybe thats why it is so popular, is a more of an "appealing to the masses" style, rather than a good 13% or so DIPA like many others I've tried that will knock your socks off.

4.92,5.6,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Poured from a 16 oz bottle into a pint glass. Freshness date is 7/11/11, which puts it at a whopping 9 days old. It's strange, I used to live in northern California about 40 minutes from the brewery and I don't know if I ever got one in a bottle this fresh and now I am in San Diego. Go figure. Pours an ever so hazy orange-yellow. Frothy white head that leaves a little lacing and a thin foam on the top. The aroma virtually defines the word "hops" citrus (grapefruit, orange) and pine. A bit of malty sweetness and finally on the end I get another aroma that my friend used to describe as a "funky aged cheese" aroma. I thought he was a little crazy for a while, but I think I finally get what he was talking about. I also get a bit of the bubblegum backbone that people are talking about and I guess I would associate that with the malt sweetness I mentioned earlier. Medium bodied on the palate, with a nice bit of carbonation. One of the things I like about this beer is that it is not a thick sticky-sweet DIPA. It actually finishes fairly dry. That brings me to what might be my favorite and most impressive thing about Pliny. The balance. I think that in here at Beer Advocate and in the beer world in general, balance is under-appreciated. People get a taste for hoppy beers and they seek out more and more extreme examples of them. The beauty of this beer is that it has incredible complexity both in hops and malt, but one never totally dominates the other. In my opinion that is much more difficult to do than make an over the top hop bomb. Thats why for me, even though this beer gets an incredible amount of hype and attention, I still believe it is deserving.","BeerAmbassador","Jul 20, 2011"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, pine, pine hop, and citrus hop. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this is always a good brew. However, Pliny was much better out of the bottle. The growler that we drank was QUITE fresh, but it just seemed to lose a little bit of the edge that it has from a fresh bottle.

His beers are subtle in the way any man who is sure of his abilities can be subtle. In confidence, a well crafted beer can be flavorful, strong and smooth all at the same time.

The beer pours a nice golden orange with a decent head that settles into a thin ring. Aromas are beautiful: Sharp acidic citrus fruit, grapefruit namely, with pine undertones. No doubt this is a west-coast IPA. The hops and malts play nicely with each other on my tongue--dry saltine crackers and oranges with dabs of piney herbs. All-in-all it is an extremely balanced IPA, but at 8% ABV, I'm tasting booze way more than I should be. Unlike some IPAs, I did not regret reaching the end of the glass.

This was no commentary on the quality though, but rather that I had just gotten into craft beer, saw that at the time it was number one on the top 100 of BA, and had such ridiculous expectations that it was only possible for it to disappoint me. Since that time I've had a lot of beers, I've had a lot of IPAs/DIPAs, and returning to it now I can say that this beer is truly fantastic. If you haven't had it, don't panic and trade an arm and a leg for it because it's not going to destroy your world but definitely get it because it will deliver you a top notch, as-good-as-it-gets DIPA experience.","Klym","Jul 10, 2011"

The nose of the beer was incredibly floral, which gave a good indication of the hefty hop presence. [Being a hop-head I was very happy with the level of hops included in this beer] The mouthfeel was somewhat standard compared to other double IPAs I've tried, but the taste lasted just long enough to entice another sip.

4.5,-3.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The beer pours a slightly hazy orange/amber color with a big foamy white head that slowly recedes leaving behind lots of lacing. There is a steady stream of carbonation throughout the life of the beer. The aroma fills the room with floral, piney hops as soon as the cap is popped on this gem. The aroma really opens up as the beer is being poured and starts to showcase some citrusy notes as well. No real malt aromas to speak of The flavor is bursting with piney, floral hops. Not nearly as much citrus in the flavor as in the nose. Surprisingly there is really not much in the way of alcohol presence, hard to believe this is a 8% beer. Medium bodied and smooth with a moderate amount of carbonation and a dry finish. Really quite good, and I can see why it is rated world class.","PatLarsen","Jun 29, 2011"

Maybe it loses its qualities in travel, but it could not have been very old, considering the extremely short length of time it's available in store coolers. I suspect that the hype for this beer has been manufactured by limiting the supply, as I can think of at least a half dozen DIPAs that I would prefer.

The aromas are very similar to the taste, where the alcohol is quite nicely hidden amongst the hops and malt. Speaking of the malt, it is there in such a great way that this beer seems balanced.

Golden orange in color, Pliny The Elder has big notes of grapefruit up front, highlighting the array of citrusy hops.

This isn't a strike against it, it's easily top 3 DIPA for me. I think this is better than Maharaja (Maharaja being a bit too big and malty and overpowering in general) but a little worse than Hopslam (which blew my socks off).

I found it to have more carbonation that some of the other double I.P.A.'s I've had. Pliny gives off an incredible aroma of pine with barely a hint of fruit. It was a little too cold for our first few tastes so the hop explosion was very intense, but as the beer dropped in temperature you could taste every element to this beer perfectly. An initial hop explosion that leaves a citrus, grapefruit, taste lingering behind with absolutely no undesirable aftertaste. The only thing that I can find wrong with this beer is that it is incredibly difficult to find. Places were sold out of it or had limited quantities.

After your nose gets accustomed to the hope aroma intensity, the sweet malt aromas begin to show through. Burst of citrus hops on the palate with a delicate malty feel underneath.

As I said, a dangerously drinkable brew that will leave you warm and feeling pleasant after one bottle. Everything is perfectly balanced here. Less hoppy than imagined, given its reputation. A pleasant surprise. I expected Pliny to be an overrated, overly hoppy beer that would inevitably let me down given the hype but I was wrong. Quite sore it's not available in Wisconsin. I paid $20 for the bottle. Is Pliny a $20 bottle of beer? Probably not, especially considering it's a year-rounder, but worth it for the one time experience if it's not in your area. I don't know when I'll be able to have my next one, but I look forward to it.","locthebloke","May 17, 2011"

Initial smell is all tropical fruit – fresh pineapple, sweet orange, and mango. Pine needles and an elegant astringency from the hops follow the initial tropical fruit attack. Taste echoes the smell with the initial attack really showing off those tropical, sweet fruits. The fruit is followed by a nice transition to bittering hops. This is virtually the only IPA/IIPA that I’ve had the pleasure of tasting that has such a fantastic transition from the start to the mid-palate to the finish. Overall, bar none, the best IPA I’ve had the pleasure of enjoying. If/when I am on the west coast and this is available in bottle or on tap, it will be sought after….

4.68,0.4,4.5,4,5,4.5,5,"Overall - There's a reason why Pliny is the standard Imperial IPA. It does everything right. It may not be the most innovative beer out there, but it doesn't need to be, much like Sculpin is to single IPAs. I find it hard to find faults here. It doesn't have some of the cool hop flavors that I like in other beers (like the tropical fruit flavors in Nugget Nectar), but it's the most well balanced imperial IPA I've had.","HotHands","May 08, 2011"

Body is medium and the alcohol is well hidden. Flavors of grapefruit and Meyer lemon dominate with a touch of the herbal components coming through on the finish. This beer has always been worth the hype to me and it can't be beat for the price, incredibly smooth for a double and impeccable balance makes this a little too easy to drink.","wino47","May 06, 2011"
4.42,-5.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"O: I can't say this lived up to the immense hype, but damn if it isn't a truly great beer. The thing that sticks out most about Russian River's Pliny the Elder is the subtle balancing act, that it doesn't take EXTREME flavors and gimmicks to make a high quality and delicious bottle of beer.

I'd be very keen to try it on tap or from the source some day and do a re-review.","spicelab","May 05, 2011"

The flavors are soft and sweet. The pine, honey, grapefruit, oranges, and floral notes all mesh perfectly. The mouthfeel is near perfect for an IPA.

Taste is alot of bitter piney hops upfront, a touch of earthiness, rich malts that balance nicely with a hoppy finish, not overly sweet. Very drinkable for a dipa but i still like a touch more complexity out of what i am drinking - maybe some tropical fruit or heavier citrus notes.

Drinkability is on another planet due to the balance and finish, and the 8% abv is a complete nonfactor. I could have as many of these in a row as my body would allow, and it would be just as good at the end as at the beginning.

This DIPA is definitely worth picking up time and time again, and even though it comes in at 8% ABV, it's still very smooth and can be a little dangerous because of how delicious it is.

4.43,-4.9,4.5,4,5,4,4,"O: A great brew, for sure, but I'm not sure it is really worth all of the hype. It is also guilty of a new trend that I find to be exceedingly annoying; demanding that the customers consume the product immediately.

This one doesn't lack any carbonation. Perfect mouthful with each drink. Overall this beer is one of the worlds best. If you don't believe me read the 1,000 reviews.

I walked up to the bar and got my 1st one. The guy didn't remember me from before and got upset that I was ordering "his" beer! I told him that it's his fault because he tipped me off about it... Anyway it's got a lovely golden yellow color with a nice head in it. The aromas are breath taking. The flavors of pine like hops sting your mouth and make you beg for more. This beer is so tasty!

This had a beautiful bronze coloring to it, that normal run-of-the-mill IPAs cannot accomplish. (to be perfectly honest-I don't even like IPAs that much!) However, this was AMAZING. I was a fan immediately by the fact that the nose was lovely and floral and the taste was the smoothest IPA with the most IPA flavor. It wasn't choking me with hoppy bitterness.

Pours a gorgeous orange with a thick white cap and tons of lacing. Smells like a tropical citrus bonanza with plenty of pine. Pine is even more present in the taste. Drinkability is off the charts.

This is a beautiful beer, it has good color and looks quite appealing, however I thought that the mismatch of its grapefruit aroma and it's highly tart smell and it's low citrus draw made it oddly unstable on the palate. The extreme hop flavor was overpowering and only on the back end did I get any of what I was expecting. The taste is, as an Imperial IPA should be, a kick in the face of flavor, but it left me confused and wondering what the brewers thought when they tasted this paradox of smell versus taste. There are other Imperial IPAs that are true to their aromatic profile and I think that this beer seems to be an ultra-hopped beer in disguise. A good beer, but not something that I would tout as an example of a perfect beer.","jnelriley","Jan 24, 2011"

The East Coast DIPAs were just touched with just a slight bitterness that was no where near the intensity of the West Coast IPAs. Appearance wise, none of them are stunners or a big story to bring home but the Hopsickle and the PtE looked a cut above the rest.

The flavor ursts in mouth, with citrusy-sweet notes surrounded by the bitter-greens from the hops. Perfectly balanced and smooth in mouth, with a crisp finish. There is a light, sour balance to the bitter aftertaste, and no linger despite the strong flavors and characteristics. Wow! I think I just made a mess in my pants!

The aroma wasn't as itense as I expected considering all I had heard about this beer. I started to wonder whether this had been way overrated, but that all changed once I had tasted it. It had a wonderful piney hop taste without very much booziness or carbonation. This is the first time I had to travel to seek out a hard to find beer (at least on the east coast) and while it may not be the best beer on the planet, it is definitely the best IPA on the planet. This is not a beer that I would consider overrated, it definitely lives up to its reputation.","jonvan04","Dec 26, 2010"

Mouthfeel is medium all around, dried out by alcohol but sweetened by fruity hop flavors. Bitterness is slightly harsh, a little out of balance with the hop flavor. I can't really say I'm disappointed with a beer this tasty but it doesn't quite live up to the legend. In fact, I preferred the Blind Pig we had just prior to Pliny.

But what needs to be noted is that this brew is iconically quintessential. It's like a chic elite party. Everyone who's anyone is in attendance; they've all come out looking their best; and everybody mingles with flawless, elegant etiquette.

4.67,0.2,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"I was fortunate enough to have some Pliny shared with me. This particular beer had been bottled only 28 days before we opened it, so I feel confident it was a fairly accurate representation of how it should taste. This poured a deep golden or copper color with a decently sized white head. Head retention was good and it left a little lacing. Smell was of citrus and fruit in addition to the hoppy smell. I found it interesting that the smell highlighted the citrus but the beer has more of a pine flavor in the taste. Starts out with the citrus and a little bit of pine hop, then hits the little bit of malt in the middle and finishes off with a bitter pine hop. Mouthfeel is good, light/medium body with moderate carbonation. At first I didn't really appreciate Pliny, but I think I get it now. It's been a few months since I tried it last and now, as I sit outside a SoCal bar I appreciate Pliny. It still isn't my most favorite IPA or DIPA but it definitely makes the top 3. This is some dang good beer.","gkunkle","Nov 07, 2010"

So at least I got to this within about a month. It truly is an excellent product. The 8% alcohol is very well hidden. I enjoyed my serving in a tulip glass. The beer changes character, for the better, as it warms slightly. It reveals not only piney citrus, but hints of caramel malt. And although the piney-ness is predominant, it's smoooth and silky in the mouth. A terrific compliment to spicy tacos. All I can say is: go get some.

While the hop presence is strong, it's not as bitter as many hoppy beers are and just goes down smoothly. I love this beer.

I accepted a cool pint glass of honey-colored ale, yellower than the average IPA, a little hazy with a stiff inch of foam on top. A deep whiff: stonefruit, flowers, something faintly pungent that isn't quite spice. Very complex. Huge intensity from the first sip. More of the peachy fruit character, lavender, pine needles, a peep of acidity on the midpalate. Strong taste of alcohol on the finish tangles the flavor tapestry just a little, but what else do you expect from a mega-brew like this?

If you have ever eaten something so delicious that you find yourself craving it weeks later...well....you know where I'm going. I have read reviews knocking this hoppy delight and reviews praising it. My opinion after almost 600 different beers in 7 months is...get one ...drink one....it really is an outstanding beer.

The hop aroma coming off of this beer is something I've never experianced. It is like I am sticking my head in the hop fridge at my home brew supply store. 1st resinous piny hops, then citrus and grapefruit huge aroma. The taste is a hop assault. The malt profile is just so that it allows the hops to shine. Bitter, citrusy, fruity and sprucy/piny and oh so good. I think this is the 1st beer I've given 2 5.0 ratings too.

The nose comprises a hella-ton o' pine, along with some grapefruit, orange peel, maple sap, and a tiny bit o' caramel in the back, trying to maintain some semblence of a malty backbone. It's got me convinced it's hoppy... The taste follows very similarly, though the two DIPA elements are both sharpened for battle: The hops are especially fruity and flowery, while the malts (caramel and toffee, natch) are stronger, more up to the task of balancing out the hops. I gotta say, the hype has been dead on: this is the most balanced DIPA I've had in a long time. And quite tasty, too.

The beer pours a burnt orange in my Duvel tulip, with a frothy, 3 finger off white head quickly forming and lingering. The lacing is decent, but just a bit short of earning a 5 for appearance. A pungent hop aroma is present even as I pour, and grapefruit, pineapple, and bitter orange peels are appreciable. Each sip leads off with the briefest of flashes of bready and caramel malt sweetness, before a shotgun blast of hop bitterness asserts itself. This fades into a more citrus hop flavor, largely pineapple and grapefruit. If the hop bitterness vs flavor balance was tipped a little bit more towards flavor Pliny would get a 5, but it's not quite there. Carbonation is high, but to good effect as it helps highlight all the juicy hop goodness, and I'm surprised at how creamy the mouthfeel is given the relative lack of malt presence. I wouldn't expect to notice much alcohol at 8%, but I don't find any at all as I sip on Pliny, and it's so damn tasty that it's a struggle to stop and savor this despite the bitterness. Truly world class, and the template against which all DIPAs should be measured.","axeman9182","Jun 10, 2010"

Taste follows the nose with tons of hops. That hop bitterness is off the charts but in a good way, not like some other double IPAs that just fry the palate. Despite the abundance of hop flavor and bitterness there is a distinctly malty note towards the finish. The high abv is well hidden, although as it warms some alcohol notes find their way through. Drinkability is great too, could drink these all day were it not for the high abv. This is a GREAT beer but I think I got a little swept away in all the hype as I felt a bit disappointed.

5,7.3,5,5,5,5,5,"This may be my favorite beer of all time. I first had it at a brewfest years ago and nothing has really ever compared. I found a liquor store right down the street that carries the 16.9oz bottles and I couldn't be more excited. Russian River's distributors do a wonderful job of ensuring the freshest possible product makes it to their customers and in the case of Pliny the Elder is makes a world of difference. This bottle is dated at 4/5/10 and was poured into a tulip glass. The color is a cloudy golden amber, reminiscent of a Belgian tripel. A rich foamy head arises and it retained with fine lacing. The smell is gloriously fresh and floral hops with enough of a citrus-like honey sweetness to again remind me somewhat of a tripel. The wonderfully bitter hops on the palate are balanced with an interestingly subtle malt that gives the taste an orange peel quality to it. The fresh and resiny hops linger through the finish so much so that its almost like I've been chewing on a mouthful of them. The carbonation is spot on, giving it exceptional mouthfeel and allowing the full and glorious flavor of the beer to be spread broadly across the palate. Everything combines to make this a beer that beckons to be sipped deeply and savored. I really tried to think of a way this beer might be made better and the only thing I could come up with was if it was on tap fresh at the brewery. I may be somewhat biased because this is my favorite style but I have had enough regular and imperial IPAs to say this one clearly trumps them all.","hoppyhampy","May 07, 2010"

Lots of hop flavors, but also there is plenty of malt sweetness and caramel flavor. I'm the opposite of a hop head, but this beer tastes great to me.

4.23,-9.2,4.5,4,4,5,4.5,"Well, here it is. My first Pliny the Elder, at 7 a.m., after work. Bottle date is 3-26-10, 20 days old. Pours a bright, fuzzy orange with great rocky, fluffy white head. Looks just like the Blind Pig from yesterday, although the head on Pliny retains better and leaves some more lacing. Very little sediment. Smell is lots of pine and earthy notes. Citrus hides in the background. Taste is the same, pine and earth and lots of it. Dry hops. A bit of a biscuity feel, I don't really pick up any fruit flavors at the start but towards the middle I start to pick up citrus, grapefruit, and lemon. Nice hop burps. The balance here is seriously excellent though, and the mouthfeel is probably the best I have encountered in an IPA, period. Truly a creamy elixir, perfect carbonation. Alcohol taste is nowhere to be found, I would never guess this is 8%. Drinkability is also pretty great because of this. Truthfully I am a little let down, the taste isn't quite what I expected, I actually preferred Blind Pig to this for sure. But the mouthfeel, overall balance of malt+hops, drinkability, and the masking of alcohol are huge highlights, and it succeeds maybe better than any other DIPA I've had in all those categories.","Chico1985","Apr 15, 2010"

Besides citrusy hop character, another kind of fruitiness derived from either hops or fruity esters is evident and clean malty sweetness penetrates through the thick sheets of aromas. Excellent. Flavors showing less diversity then the nose suggested are of grapefruit and coniferous resins; semi-dry finish with lingering unharsh bitterness. The light-medium body is delicately carbonated.

4.82,3.4,4,4.5,5,5,5,"On-tap at TJ's in PA yesterday, reviewed from notes. Pours out a golden yellow with no head but a white ring and cloud. The ring actually leaves some light, spotty lacing around the glass. Smell is very good, reminds me of Sculpin but a bit less fruity and more pine up front. The hops lend pine, citrus, earthy and grapefruit notes. There is actually hints of malt which balance the nose for me. The taste is very similar. Very good hop profile balanced by a great malt backbone. The hops are citrus, piney, grapefruit and other fruity notes. The level of bitterness is perfect for an IIPA. Mouthfeel is also great. The medium body is very smooth with low-medium carbonation that suits the flavor perfectly. A bitter coat is left on the tongue. The beer has no alcohol presence, taste or MF, for me. Drinkability is killer. The taste and price ($5) were both amazing. The flavors stay very solid and the beer only gets more complex and enjoyable as I drink it very slowly. Could session this one for hours on end (not true of many IIPAs).","cbutova","Mar 21, 2010"

Pliny the Elder is one such. Fortunately, business brought us to the area and no time was lost in making the pilgrimage to the fount. Beer is a pale amber slightly hazy with a not much head but a decent lingering lacing on the glass (for what that is worth). Major impact on the nose with an intense full-on grapefruit explosion mixed with grassy and pine overtones. One can scarce forbear to taste and it is not disappointing: predominant citrus, some butterscotch undertones, that give way to lingering dry bitter finish.

Mouthwatering aroma of American hops with lots of pine notes, and some sweet bready fragrances in the background. I was blown away after one sip by how a beer with so much bitterness and hop flavor can come out so balanced. Loads of pine and white grapefruit hop flavor in the forefront, but with plenty of malt sweetness to back it up. There seemed to be a little bit of cannabis like skunkyness in the ultra dry finish that mixed in with the seemingly endless piney hop aftertaste and just the right amount of alcoholic warmth. Unlike other doubles like 90 and Hop Wallop, this beer finishes very dry, despite the amount of sweetness. This dry finish and the medium body make it all too drinkable.

Aroma is sweet hops coming forward as pineapple and other vaguely tropical smells. The flavor is super juicy, hops, sugary lemons and pineapple, despite initially sweet, it finishes dry, tangy and lightly acidic along the sides of my tongue. The ABV leaves a light tingle.

Pine and grapefruit notes are prevalent, with some added bitter citrus and well-balanced hoppiness. Taste was lighter than I had anticipated, but was plenty complex and had great hop presence and citrus chracteristics, balanced by a subtle maltiness that becomes more apparent as it warms up. Not as sharp and destructive feel as some other DIPA's, and just the right amount of carbonation to compliment the bite. The 8% abv is barely noticeable, and this is an extremely drinkable beer. I could go through several in an outing if unstopped. This is always in high demand throughout local beer stores, and is truly one of the greater DIPA's on the market.

This beer is so bitter (which is great), but it makes the mouth dry and insensitive for any other taste (and apparently I'm not the only user that thinks so recently). What a pity, because a beer should also be drinkable. I think the drinkability is highly overrated, the taste, for sure not. It feels a bit strange this beer is rated higher than Rochefort 10 and Westvleteren 8 on Beeradvocate, I personally think that the ratebeer.com rating reflects the quality of this beer better.

I could smell this beer when I opened the bottle. Wonderfully strong in the nose. Lots of hoppy aroma. Noticeable citrus and pine presence in the aroma. The taste is much the same. Absolutely delicious. Big hoppy bite, followed by a strong grapefruit taste...almost tastes like a grapefruit rind was dropped in. A fair amount of bitterness but not overpowering. A real lip smacker. Very strong taste and nicely balanced. Medium body and not a lot of mouth stick. It's got an almost "oily" mouthfeel to it and it makes me want to chatter my teeth.

It had more depth and body, and was the smoother beer overall. I love the Two Hearted, but it was a bit thin in comparison (I guessed the beers after a short time with the blind test). I also tried a bit of a HopSlam in comparison, but it is past it's prime now - too much honey, not enough hops. The Pliny is an extremely well balanced IPA, as good as any I've had.

First sip: mmm, nice but I think it's a bit too cold - it's masking the flavor. Swirl, let it sit for a few minutes. Mmm better, more aroma and flavor coming through. Nicely balanced, medium body, about 7.5-out-of-10 on the hop-richter scale. Halfway through, smooth, balanced, simple pleasing hop profile, that's not trying too hard.

In my opinion, this is what a IPA/double IPA should look like. Not too heavy on the dark malt to let the excellent hop character be the center of attention. Smell is of canned pineapple and grapefruit, with a little grassiness thrown in for good measure. A truly amazing smelling beer. Taste is similar to the smell, with pineapple coming in a slight bit less then the smell would have led me on to think. Lots of citrus and grassy flavor with just enough malt. As it warms the alcohol starts to lend itself to the flavor a little more. Mouthfeel is light yet not watery, with the hops being the dominant player here rather then having a sweet sticky mouthfeel from too much malt. Drinkability is good but not amazing.

I know, I know--it's named after Mr. Hop--but if you were to hand me this beer in a glass, me knowing nothing about it, I would comment on a subtle chalkiness attributable to the hop. Though I taste more lemon than I smelled, I would appreciate some more. The earthy, hoppy mouthfeel pulls more at my tongue and cheeks than it does at my teeth, and that's unusual. Perhaps I'm losing that sensation, but I expected more of that from this Pliny. It's 3,000 miles away and probably has to suffer some sorta despair on its undistributed route here.

4.32,-7.3,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Acquired thanks to a trade with goodbyeohio. Pours a thinly veiled gold with two fingers of fluffy white head that creates some nice lacing as it dissipates. The relatively plain appearance does little to signal what lies ahead (call it the Clark Kent of DIPAs). The smell is mango and pineapple with some light pine and vanilla underneath. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light for a DIPA with lively carbonation that helps convey a variety of hop flavors without ever feeling too heavy. Not as much malt balance as some may like: a pleasant but brief vanilla/mango sweetness at the beginning is quickly dispensed with as the hop show begins. However, Pliny is not a blindly flailing hop jambouree either; there is some subtlety underneath the brawn. When the sweetness fades, the grapefruit hop flavors come in, providing a delicate transition before the stronger pine notes treat your tonsils like a boxer's speed-bag. The finish gives a delayed dry smack to the back of the throat and then a prolonged hop aftertaste that contains only a hint of the 8% alcohol. Very drinkable for a beer this flavorful: despite its complexity and intensity, the mouthfeel keeps Pliny a lively elder. Pairs nicely with sweet & spicy BBQ.","chicagobeerriot","Jul 05, 2009"
4.9,5.2,5,5,5,4,5,"On the palate a huge hop bite then a small taste of maltiness with little to no sweetness then back again with a huge hop bitterness, this beer isn't about malt it's all about hops and it doesn't let you forget it.

Not much malts, but they're not a feature of this style--just enough to get a nice balance. Pliny the Elder was very smooth (probably the smoothest beer I've had) and had great carbonation.

Very hop-forward taste as well, again with a lot of citrus and herbal qualities; really complex hop profile. Quite bitter, but still very palatable. Very light biscuity malt in the background.

There is some sweet pale malt in there, I can smell it if I really try, but the huge hop aroma overwhelms. Hop flavor and bitterness hit up front and alternate across my tongue. The same citrusy and resiny hops dominate as well as some pine and a bitter herbal flavor. The bitterness is so pronounced that I can feel it in my throat a bit, but the beer is still totally drinkable. Some fruity esters pop up in the finish, pairing well with the hops.

I had several of these over the course of a week so this review reflects the combined experience, not a single glass. I thought that 8% was a little on the low side for an Imperial IPA, Hop rod Rye is also 8% and considered a standard IPA, and in my opinion a much better beer.

Served nice and chilly with a white bubbly, foamy head. Great smell of floral and fruity hops. Clear and deep golden with an amber color. The taste is great, but can change depending on when/where you have it. The best I've had was actually from the bottle - a great refreshing taste of strong floral hops up front, then the fruity hops hit your palate, followed by just the slightest hint of well-covered, crisp alcohol. Very refreshing and drinkable for a double IPA.","kdoc8","Jun 13, 2009"

4.07,-12.7,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a moderate one finger head of off-white, mixed bubble size foam, some stickiness to the lacing whereas the head mostly gone in about a minute or so. Light golden-yellow in color with a metallic orange tinge which brightens more than darkens, comes extremely close to transparency. There's a certain bluntness to the nose, like it kicks there door open and then just stands there unmoving in the door way, thick pink to white grapefruit, tangerine citrus notes resonant yet not juicy nor zesty per se, in turn the floral notes more citrus blossom than well-rounded "musk" and the peach, nectarine, pineapple, papaya fruit scents present more thrust than expansiveness, not insanely hoppy nor grassy but sufficient enough to put any malty scents way in the background. Medium-bodied, too tightly wound as well as aggressively carbonated to really get full-bodied. Peppery mouth entry, quite spicy, forestalls the grapefruit, mandarin orange citrus component for a tick or two. Pine resin clearer here, florality a little more hidden. Doesn't come off as that dry, hence more juice in the peach, nectarine, mango fruit and less tropical bite. Sweet tea leaf oils accrue with time and at the very end you can tease out some cocoa powder. Can't say it's not balanced but when you don't risk many agile dance moves, hard not to be.

The "C" hops are holding nothing back from the nose to the mouth as the piny citrus notes dominate everything. Given its status as a double IPA it is surprisingly uncloying with a clean lasting finish. However, the lasting impact of the hops on the tongue and roof of my mouth gets it a slight ding for drinkability.

It's the perfect hop balance, light on the peppery centenials or cascades and a hearty dose of floral varieties. There's a caramel plateau with a nice toffee crispness.

Entry is much like the nose, with strong oily pine and citrus hops coating the tongue in a most pleasing manner, sticky to a degeree. Malts although present, playing a meek second fiddle. Finish is semisweet malt with orange marmalade and grapefruit fade. I would like to drink this for the remainder of the afternoon into evening, but you just can't. With the some of all it's parts, one would think this would be cloying or over the top after a while, but it's not.

A scent of orange and a slight scent of pine as I pour it into a Pizza Port pint glass. Golden orange appearance with tiny bubbles floating to the top. The taste is hoppy but not overwhelming. Nice aftertaste and very refreshing to my palate. 3/4 of it gone and starting to feel a nice "feeling" from it. Mouthfeel is definitely still refreshing and hoppy as I finish drinking the Pliny. Overall, this is a very, very good beer that is definitely a top 5 on my list. The bottle is very tasty and when I can find them, I always take a few home. Starting to really feel "good" now. Nice! Tried this on tap at Father's Office 2 in Culver City. Wow! Hard to drink the other beers on tap because Pliny just kick a--! If you find this on tap, definitely try it.

It smelled more subdued than expected, like apricot and mango, with some lemon and honey. It tasted very tropical and sweet, but also very cleanly bitter. Main flavors were apricot, mango, and pineapple, supported by some resin (not really pine) and plenty of honey malt for very balanced flavor. A bit of alcohol was noticeable. It was slightly thick with no carbonation, and had a slightly bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a very clean and surprisingly sweet and balanced beer. Fantastic flavors with the different hops and malt playing perfectly together. Only a touch of alcohol taste made this very easy to drink. Could this have been better? Maybe a bit stronger scent and slightly fuller body. But those aren't really complaints, as this was a delight to drink.","Pencible","Mar 25, 2009"

You smell a smorgasboard of hops flavors, citrus up front, but it the piney notes that take the day and linger with you. The first taste is that bitter hop smash we all know and love but then it gets more complicated. It's the second half of the taste where the bitterness mellows and you can really appreciate the underlying flavor that makes this beer so great. The greatest aftertaste I've ever had in a beer . . . these great subtle pine notes just linger on your palate for minutes after your first taste. Has to be the best DIPA I have ever had. I am leaving some room on my score on the off-chance that I get my hands on a fresh bottle because I did think the front bitterness was slightly faded.

Brought some back and just cracked 'em last night with friends so I am reviewing the bottled version. A sharp looking beer. Super crisp and clear and light orange amber with a head that just don't quit. This beer has all aspects of hoppyness covered. Fruity, yes. Lots of citrus zest, orange, lime, and big plump pineapple juicyness. But the main flavor is pungent pine, bitter all the way through. Totally numbs my entire mouth, makes me all tingly, I like. Lingering long after the swallow too. You could take a sip of this beer and probably still taste it a minute later. I like that this IPA isn't just full of fruity hops like a lot of beers from the west coast, which can be nice, but it has that wrenching bitterness to it that really completes the bold character of the beer. Dry, yet quenching. Somehow crispy on the palate but plenty of body and just a pure pleasure to drink.

Very strong pine and flowery hop smells with the slightest hint of citrus and other fruits waft up to the nose. The taste is overpowered (in a good way for all the hopheads) by a piney/flowery hop taste. There has to be a malty backbone to supplement this hop_beast, but it is unapparent in the mouth.

I fully understand why this is one of the elite beers. There have been recent talk about freshness and this one was bottle on 2/16/09, then shipped across to Jax, so makes me wonder how good this is on tap. I was expecting something more in my face, given its popularity. Its like meeting Elisha Cuthbert, and she farts then picks her nose before shaking your hand. You're still amazed by the whole experience, but the simple labeling, and the lack of beer angels flowing from the bottle, no fanfare in the background, and every BA friend of yours, isn't ringing your phone off the hook to see how it really was.

Pours crystal clear and golden, fitting for such a famous beer. Creamy, two-finger, white head with great retention and lacing. Smell is great. A nice blend of hops. Some citrus/grapefruit but not overpowering, like some other west coast IPA's. A strong floral presence as well, some sweet malt too. Taste is boderline perfect. At first the hops seem somewhat mellow and controlled, but it hits you with a strong, bitter aftertaste that you dont want to go away. Detected both some piney and citrus hops and well as a distinct, but not overpowering, sweetness as it warms. Mouthfeel was medium, but still somewhat light. Very smooth and silky. Overall this is a great, well balanced beer. I guess I never noticed, until I did this review, that it is a Double IPA. The mastery of the balance is amazing and it does not come off as a Double and the ABV is undetectable. A truely great beer.","bunnyhustle","Mar 03, 2009"

I was afraid any review of this beer would be based on the reviews past, I tried to review only on it's own merits.

Nicely balanced initial flavor with bitter hops and malt transitioning to a slowly evolving sweet malt and floral/bitter hop aftertaste that seemed to have a peak sweetness in the middle and a long bitter aftertaste that sits on top of the tongue. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, moderately carbonated, somwhere near the line between syruppy and crisp. Very nice.

Whatever hops they used, its just perfect and we'll leave it at that. Awesome mouthfeel, and the finish is a lovely bitterness that lingers in your lymph nodes that makes you just want more, and more, and more. Drinkability is outstanding; for 8%, the alcohol is WELL hidden, I could drink this all night every night.

The color is a light orange/tan when light passes through (I usually prefer a slightly darker color for a double-IPA). The taste is amazing, hops are perfectly balanced and the malts are very present despite its lighter color. Its hard to tell if there is a dominant hop flavor (citrus, pine, melon...), but overall the hoppiness is very pleasant. The alcohol is not noticeable on the palate but after awhile the stomach begins to warm up. The beer has a good amount of carbonation. The drinkability is high if you are a hop-head otherwise it may be difficult to drink.

The first sip is truly amazing. With so much hop aroama you would think the beer would be way to bitter. It is the total opposite. This beer is extremely balanced with just the right amount of bitterness.

The tast is very hoppy but mostly sweet and citrus flavors integrated. It has some bittering notes but just during the swallow, not at the end where IPAs usually get bitter.

It's pretty amazing how this much bitterness tasted this smooth. The flavor had orange and grapefruit citrus character, as well as a note of cream, with a stong bitterness that was smooth and refreshing, rather than simply punching me in the mouth. Mouthfeel was creamy as well. Surprised that at 8%, I really couldn't taste the alcohol. Interestingly enough, as it warmed, it didn't change in it taste profile as a lot of beers do.

The taste is more of the same with accent on the citrus, plus biter hops followed by cotton candy on the side and back of the tounge. The mouthfeel is medium malty with a crisp note and the carbonation is lively. The finish is long with biter-sweet hops. This is one of the great IPA's, I'm glad I can get it locally.

The aroma is like a cut fresh pine tree mixed with tangerines and just a slight bit of malty sweetness. The taste is a full frontal assault with a pine branch. The piney notes are really an affront to the palate but the strange thing is it finishes really watery. I figured there would be a bigger bang at the end.

Head dissipated into a soapy skim in the center with a band of ringlets that coalesced around the edges; some spatters of lacing present during the tasting. Nose off the cap was sweet grapefruit and a little bit of piney hops. Flavors were much more balanced; not overly sweet not overly bitter; a residual aftertaste lightly lingered between quaffs. Mouthfeel fell between light and medium with a mild effervescence consistent throughout. Easy drinking with a well-hidden abv. I'm not really an IPA fan, but I'm really starting to dig DIPAs.

The hoppiness is in-your-face with bitter pine, fresh greenery, and floral bursts; however, it never gets too resiny or overly bitter. Plus, the malts provide a beautiful balance of light biscuit and caramel that neither cloys in its sweetness, nor outshines the hop character. Mouthfeel is crisp, perfectly carbonated, and refreshing, with a medium body and lingering hoppy bite. The alcohol is almost undetectable, and I kind of like it that way. Although the Elder came across more like a single IPA than an imperial one, I didn't mind. The hops were well-utilized and the drinkability was top-notch. Does it belong in the top 10? Maybe...

The taste is very citrusy with grapefruit and other citrusy flavors. Very balanced. The mouthfeel is incredibly creamy, full body with a dry finish.

4.17,-10.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Thanks again to Christina for getting me this gem. Pours a decent enough clear gold, with a small white head show. Head quickly becomes a white ring of lace, with some staying power. Smell is of earthy hops, reminiscent of onions or cabbage. Some bits of grass and citrus can be smelled in the background. Taste starts off with some sweet honey comb and citrus, and follows through with the onion like hops. Mouthfeel is slightly lighter than was expected, but full of flavor. Alcohol warmth can be felt after the first few pulls on this brew, but I could see myself going through another bottle of this without a problem. An impressive DIPA from Russian River. Reminds me a lot of Stone's 10th Anniversary DIPA, which also showcased that same onion like hop profile. Worthy of the hype? Not really in my opinion, but still a damn good beer, and one to seek out. Cheers","jamie2dope","Oct 16, 2008"

Leans more towards the pine than to the citrus side. Taste is pretty much a citrus and pine explosion that leaves the mouth coated with bitter hop oils.

Nice hop bitterness, plenty of bitter grapefruit rind, lemon peel, orange, and some thick pine resin. Some pale malt make up a decent backbone. Ever so dry on the finish. Sweetness is subdued. Very thick and smooth, creamy on the tongue with only the slightest bite from carbonation, which is in short supply. Alcohol presence is not quite hidden, but hidden enough for the high ABV.

The taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of a slightly sweet caramel malt that does a nice job backing up the hops.

Just a two-dimensional flavor, though, not much complexity. Could have used some more varied hop flavors in there.

Piney (or is that Pliny), grapefuity and floral. No malt detected in the aroma at all. Flavour mirrors the aroma with the addition of a slight grassy taste and an enormous, but not tragically agressive, bitterness. The malt flavour is very nuetral, its sole purpose to cut the hops so they dont burn your face off. Very, very dry finish. Has a lighter body (for a IIPA), which makes this a very drinkable beer.

4.87,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"Poured a surprisingly pale amber color with a huge foamy white head that leaves tons of Belgian lacing with every mouthful. I've been conditioned to expect a certain 'level' of color is required to achieve world class levels of mouth and flavor. This one convincingly shattering that myth, but i'd prefer a meatier color. The smell is aggressive, intense with floral piny resin and grapefruit. Hugely tangy with hops, the mouth feel is full bodied and compliments the flavor during and after taste. Full flavored the piny resin and grapefruit flavors explode and linger as anticipated. Interesting to taste RR IPA, Blind Pig and Pliny side by side. The fundamental elements flavor being the common thread...the difference really being the intensity in both the mouth and depth of flavor. Drinkability is a 4.75...i'm having a really hard time believing that this one is only 8% ABV. The intensity of the mouth and flavor textures hide the kick-in-the-as* that is inevitable. One of the best ales i've had the opportunity to experience...clearly topping off my venture to mecca. The real amazing thing about a Russian River sampler is the scope and breathe of their products.

4.64,-0.4,4,5,5,4,4,"As far as drinkability, there's a continuum, running between "session" and "imperial." Those which advertise themselves as "imperial" are far too strong to be drinking for hours on end. They are special examples of brewers' skill which should be sampled and enjoyed occasionally, and which most definitely don't lend themselves to excessive consumption. Though i wouldn't drink more...well, not much more...than a bottle's worth of this in a sitting, i can't get enough of it. I keep wanting to remind myself of the brilliance and complexity of this masterful beer, as well as to renew its flavor on the palate, which fades to a bitter (but not unpleasant) flavor of grapefruit rind, given a few minutes of typing without drinking. All in all, an impressive and unique take on the IPA style.","murdoch22","Sep 01, 2008"

In terms of style it is unparalleled, it is like nothing I've ever tried before, the further I get into this beer the more it changes, I keep wanting to go back again and again for another sip just to try and pull out more flavors. There is a grainy kind of taste that I think is a result of how bitter this beer is and it is slightly off putting but I've tasted it in other DIPAs before. This has been the hardest beer for me to judge. I'd say it lives up to the hype but unlike the Dreadnaught I think I'd be okay with just a bottle of this while I could drink the Dreadnaught all night long.

4.84,3.9,4,5,5,4,5,"Pours a relatively clear light-copper/orange color, foamy off-white head loosely forms and fades pretty quickly, leaving a thin layer of foam with some bigger bubbles around the edge of the glass, nice patchy lacing. This is probably the most pine hop aroma I've encountered in a beer....piney hops just leap out of the glass, and pretty much dominate the nose, though there are some sweet malty aromas as well. Taste is just explosively hoppy....spicy, sticky, resinous pine taste, bitter grapefruit, tangerine, and some delicate caramel sweetness. The mouthfeel seems a touch thin for an Imperial IPA, but in the context of the flavors in this beer, it's perfect, with a slight stickiness, and lingering bitterness that doesn't overpower you. So glad I got this in a trade, and this is a beer that'll stay permanently on my "wants" list. Should Russian River ever decide to distribute in MA, this would always be in my fridge.

The citrus scent is the most dominant with plenty of earthiness and pine scents nipping at the heels of the citrus scent, but no malt to really speak of in the nose. The flavor profile starts out with loads of hop bitterness leaning towards pine bitterness with the citrus fruit and tropical fruits flavors really coming in about mid-drink. The flavors are very pronounced, but they do not overpower you in anyway, but rather combine for a very pleasant flavor profile. The initial rush of hop bitterness if huge, but somehow the finish is soft and clean. I am very surprised as well at how low the malt flavor is, but still supports the hops brilliantly.

If anything I would say it could be the tiniest touch thicker, but I sat and debated whether or not to give the feel a 4.5 or a 5 for about 10 minutes. fantastically smooth, and defenitely one of, if not the, most drinkable DIPA I have ever consumed. It literally took me about 5 minutes to drink this. (good thing I have another one!) Totally refreshing, and beautifully smooth. A wonderfully crisp and pure brew. Art at its finest, defenitely my favorite RR brew as of yet. Beatification is great, Deviation was amazing, but this beer, is simply perfectly ideal for the style.

4.57,-1.9,4.5,5,4.5,5,4,"The aroma of this beer is just so nice; the dominant hop fruit notes are perfectly controlled by the softer herbal hop character. The flavor is a bit more herbal in balance and is quite scathing in its hop attack. Still the bitter, sharply herbal hop notes never get out of control, but this beer still makes me feel like my tongue has been abused and scraped raw by the aggressive hop character. This is most definitely a well constructed brew, and in some aspects this is quite definitive for the style. A benchmark for the style that I will never get enough of.","Gueuzedude","Jul 17, 2008"

It's mostly full of pine notes, that really linger on afterwards, which is my favorite part about the taste. The mouthfeel is everything a DIPA should be, with a medium-full body and solid carbonation.

4.7,0.9,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"M&D: Medium to full body. Just the right amount of carbonation makes the mouthfeel excellent. At 8% ABV the Elder (a DIPA) is as drinkable as any single IPA out there.

4.6,-1.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"This beer arrived shimmering golden orange in my half-liter mug with a big frothy head on top. The nose found sharp bitter citrus and hops. As for the taste, thsi should be renamed "Piney" the Elder, because there are a lot of piney notes in this bittersweet offering, but leaning towards being bitter. Hop flavors are sharp to the palate with a bite of grapefruit peel and a touch-up of ripe fruit. Surprisingly, this beer is "just right" in mouthfeel and drinkability; not heavy at all, so you can take on another pint voluntarily if you wanted to.","DoubleJ","Jun 20, 2008"

4.97,6.7,4.5,5,5,5,5,"I've had this on tap at the Russian River brewpub numerous times, and always bring a growler home. If I had to pick a single favorite beer this would probably be it. Rich gold in color, with reddish tints. The nose is astounding: pineapple, pleasantly musty grass- and pine-sap aromas, grapefruit, some of the kind of vanilla-ey aromas that you find in oaky chardonnay, along with funky tropical fruit scents---passionfruit, or even durian, though not overwhelming. With wines or beers, I'm a sucker for an interesting aroma, and this is definitely a beer worth swirling again and again to reactivate the olfactory blast. Flavors of passionfruit and grapefruit, with piney hops. All of Vinnie's high-hop offerings remind you that a simple IBU number doesn't really tell the story---this has got to be at 90 or more, but it's so well structured and balanced that you really don't taste "bitterness" or "hoppiness" per se. Instead the hops and malts create a structure that allows an amazing range of flavors to play across the palate with crystalline definition (this general point goes for the Younger, and RR's other hopped-up offerings as well). The mouthfeel is crisp and not at all cloying, but does have a noticeable tongue-coating quality. It's worth noting that while this beer is classed as an IIPA, it's far less heavy in body than most of the others of the type, and while the intensity of flavors definitely puts it in that category, it has a clean medium-bodied profile that drinks more like a regular, if mind-blowing, IPA. The finish is clean, bitter-grapefruit-rindy, and lingering. Two comments: 1. Thanks! 2. Never stop making this stuff!","rashmore","May 21, 2008"
4.67,0.2,4.5,5,4.5,4,5,"D - Overall, this is definitely one of the easiest drinking and most flavorful DIPAs out there. Usually this style of beer has trouble reaching a balance as the beer is either all hops or all malt. This one manages to bring the hops without being overpowering at all. There was also not even a hint of the 10% ABV in this bad boy which became a bit dangerous as I glasses continue to be filled. Overall a great RR Brew.","jeonseh","May 20, 2008"

Strong scents of pure hops, pine and grapeftuit. The palate shows the hops more than the "Blind Pig" and is drier but not necessarily any more bitter. Again, this is a very well balanced beer that has a bit more of everything than the "Blind Pig".","SQNfan","Apr 24, 2008"

4.67,0.2,4.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"Pliny The Elder poured a bautiful hazy golden orange with a nice creamy 1/2 inch head of white foam. This head of foam had excellent retention that left behind a small white film and tons of white lace around around the glass. The aroma was very potent with citrus hops, grapefruit, pine, a slice of lemon, a touch of grass, and then all this ended with more citrus hops. If there was any malt in here, it was beaten down by all the hoppy aromas. The taste was just filled to the brink with pine, citrus hops, a touch of lemon, grapefruit,and more citrus hops. I noticed that at the end, there was some alcohol, but this alcohol tasted like it was infused with pine and citrus hops. Even the alcohol couldn't get away from being hoppy and piny. The mouthfeel was medium to full bodied with a powerful aftertaste of citrus hops, pine, and grapefruit. This aftertaste will linger on your tongue for quite a long time. It was nothing short of being a wonderful hoppy beer. If I could, I would drink this one again at the drop of a hat.","AltBock","Apr 13, 2008"
4.75,1.9,5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours a clear copper-yellow with a small, brief, frothy head. As expected for the style, the nose is huge hops, but with more complexity than I'm used to in a DIPA. pine galore, but hints of grapefruit, lemon, green apple, grass, and some spicyness pull through. Palette leans more towards the citrusy zest side, with a lemon and grapefruit tartness being the dominant flavor profile. We get the expected hoppy bitter punch at the end (although it isn't overpowering), along with a mild alcohol warmth that finishes nicely. Mouthfeel is full, but not too sticky or syrupy (my personal pet peeve of the style). Overall, a dynamite DIPA, with a greater complexity and balance than any other DIPA I've tried so far.","0110x011","Mar 31, 2008"

Smells of BIG multi-dimensional hops, focusing mostly on pine. Some sweet maltiness in there too. Smell is so strong as it could give the faint of heart a nose bleed. Mouthfeel is light to medium. Tingles the tongue as is swirls around. Some malt sweetness discernable. Slightly viscous. Hops all through out and leaves the tongue feeling vibrant and alive. Not totally unbalanced but definitely destroys the taste buds in a good way. Really mellows as it warms, becomes almost winelike.

Medium body, Moderate carbonation. Nice long, smooth finish for an 8% beer. Some alcohol warmth and dry finish from abundant hops.

Has a strong floral hop taste, with a nice malt backbone sweetness that is always present but is cotnrolled by the hops. The beer coates your mouth with a sticky hop feel. While drinking many of these can be dangerous, I often find myself putting back quite a few, and so I would say it is very drinkable.","jwolfie70","Feb 12, 2008"
4.25,-8.8,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours from a growler into a honeycomb mug. Carbonation traveled well equaling a three finger off white head that sits like a foamm brick. It slowly settles leaving a ton of lace. Body is a golden honey straw in color. Nose is big and fresh with notes of flowery citrus, which is almost creamy with piney alchol notes that really get the taste buds going. On first sip a rush of creamy hops attack the tongue. This hop feel quickly becomes incredibly dominent with long bitter feel coating the entire mouth. This beer really has a good thing going with an effect as the only thing that satisfies the bitter mouthfeel is another sip. There is a bit of a malt feel that adds a bit of balance as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is a long and even almost creamy hop bitterness. Drinkability is nice as each sip rewards the last and beckons the next.","SPLITGRIN","Jan 27, 2008"

Caramel malt does make an appearance, just enough to balance the huge hop character. Taste starts off with a tiny bit of alcohol but is quickly taken over by the huge citrus hop flavor. Grapefruit, lemon, lime, oranges with a good pine undertone. With how much hop is present on the tongue, this beer isn't dry or very bitter at all. Caramel malt is actually quite noticable for such a hop bomb. Mouthfeel is medium bodied bordering on full with a whole lot of constant carbonation.

The bartender told me that it was an IPA, so I was surprised to read that it was 8% ABV, as it went down so easily. The beer's real strength is in its masterful hop bouquet (pine, mango, grapefruit) which fills one's nostrils to the brim, yet relents when hitting the tongue. Extraordinarily well balanced, these mighty hop flavors part, allowing the sweet bready malts to emerge. The only hop flavor to make it to the finish line is the resinous pine, which (in the humble opinion of this reviewer), keeps this beer from perfection. Aside from that bitterness, the mouthfeel manages to be creamy & crisp, a remarkable feat, and this ale goes down incredibly easy. Bravo!","jbsteiny","Jul 19, 2007"

The smell is nothing short of a joyous occasion; some pine resin, lemon, grapefruit, and some extra dankness that reminds one of the tropics. Bitter, resinous pine greets the tongue leading to some lemon and grapefruit, followed by more of the pine resin. Incredibly bitter, yet the hop flavor still overpowers the pure bitterness of it. Soft carbonation at about medium levels, body is medium with lingering hoppy finish. Crazy drinkable. Love this stuff and I wish I had an easier access to it.","badbeer","May 25, 2007"

The taste is very hoppy and light in body. This is a more drinkable beer than I ever imagined. It's like a beer you could sit down and just drink 4-5 and love every minute of it.

An abundance of citrus hop flavor with just enough sweet malt for it not to overpower like many DIPAs do. The beer is medium bodied and the alcohol is well hidden, just enough to provide some warmth.

Prudence said to hold off on further sampling until after dinner. My favorable impression of the beer improved once all those big spicy flavors were washed away by some water. To my taste there was a nice sweet malty backbone to the beer that supports the hops, there is clearly some alcohol there but it is well masked and ends up with a slightly drying quality to the finish. The 8% does decrease long-term drinkability, but treated with appropriate respect. Oh, wow. Amazing stuff.","jsbrendle","Apr 25, 2007"

Sticking your nose in the glass in one of the true pleasures in craft beer - lots of sweet, fruity hops and caramel malt in a near perfect symphony. Tastes like it smells, only better. Resinous, sweet citrus hop candy with just the right balance of caramel and biscuity malts. It glides across your tongue and finishes super clean, a bit dry and with no alcohol burn.

4.75,1.9,5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"his was on-draft in a 16 oz glass from the Russian River Brewpub in Santa Rosa. I have heard a lot about this, so was looking forward to seeing if it lived up to its reputation. The brews were all listed in various color chalks on a board behind the bar, and according to it this one checked in at 92 BUs and 8% ABV. When it was set in front of me I could smell the hops from two feet away. This one is potent! The odor just leaps out of the glass with piney and floral hops. You dont need to take a big sniff to get what is going on here. Besides the hops, there are also some wonderful rich malts, nuts toffee, caramel, and fruit. I cannot imagine a beer smelling any better than this. As a pub pour it came without any head, but after drinking off the first inch, and almost swooning in the process, I swirled it and got a nice fat off-white head that left lots of fat chunks of lacing on the sides of the glass. A beautiful light orange, this is a feast for the eyes and as the head slowly settles down you are so taken by its overall beauty you almost hate to disturb it. The flavor is similar to the nose, and while the malts and the hops dominate, there is a serious bitter finish worthy of a DIPA. The mouthfeel was excellent, very rich and creamy and simply glides across the teeth and tongue. It tastes just as good going down the pipe as it did at first sip. The brew is simply incredible. It has that wonderful bitterness that all great DIPAs should have, and hides the alcohol very well. It is too bad this is only available on tap, because I would love to share this with my friends so they can appreciate it also. I have been saving a score this high for just a brew like this. Ranks with the best beer I have every had the pleasure of drinking. Maybe Pliny the Younger will be that perfect 5.0 if I ever get to taste it","rkuhnel","Apr 08, 2007"

First smell reminded me of HopSlam, honestly. Has a sweet citrusy/grapefruity smell that I absolutely love in a big IPA. Could sit and sniff this for quite a while. First taste was unbelieveably smooth and sweet with a bitterness bash coming in mid-palate and lasting quite a long time. As it warms, the malty tones makes themselves known and it turns into a piney bitterness. I adjusted to the bitterness rather quickly and found this to be fairly well-balanced. Definitely full-bodied and sticky. Resiny feel left behind and there is little carbonation felt on tongue. Awesome and sneaky drinkability; deceptively smooth.

A fair amount of lacing clings to the glass as I make my way to the bottom. Smells of fresh, piney hops, sweet malts, grapefruit, apricot and a pleasant grassy note.

Creamy and soft malty body shows a nice spicy pepperiness and just a hint of alcohol. There is a nice lingering mild dryness to the finish.

The aroma was intense with sweet fruity, floral hops - very distinctive, kind of like fruity candies. Pine and grapefruit were also prominent and there was a light chalkiness or powderiness as well. Wow, this is quite a balanced monster. The bitterness is strong, but is kept in check by the malt until the finish where it lingers along with pine and grapefruit. It starts on the sweet side with a toasty maltiness. The hops (pine and grapefruit) really kick in after this, but stay balanced. There's also a pleasant fruit and floral quality to the hops that show up towards the end. Medium/full bodied, nearly chewy, with a luxurious, creamy texture. Alcohol wasn't apparent.

Aroma comes on complexly featuring an appealing amount of pineapple on top of a subtle pine/juniper base. By far, however, the pine is overshadowed by citrus juice, peaches, and grapefruit. The aroma could be described as candy like if it didnt trigger receptors in your brain that say: Warning Hop Blast Acomin! Feels tangy and acidic with a citrus medley blast of lime, lemon, grapefruit, and nectarine. Perfectly balanced (for the style) with a sweet malt base and only residual pine oils in the flavor.

Each drink leaves another level of lace clinging to the glass. The smell is pine, citrus, and loads of malty goodness. The taste is even better, walking a perfect tightrope between the strong malt flavor and the hop bitterness. With every drink, new flavors come out. At times it seems to have almost a candy sweentess, with some drinks caramel, and with other sips a doughy quality. It's almost chewy, with a tremendous mouthfeel. The drinkability is amazing.

The taste does not disappoint either. For a hop lover this beer is great. The bitter hoppy taste and citrus on the tongue and all through my mouth make this a very drinkable beer but at around 8% it is dangerous to put down and not have another. You can definitely taste the hops in your mouth long after the beer has gone down your throat as if you are sucking on a pine cone.

The flavor will cause the uninitiated to dial 911. As massive as the hops are in this beer, to me, still as I said four years ago, it is the malt backbone that separates this man from the boys. I've seen a few examples like this of hop overkill, but this is the only really big monster hop beer that tries to be a true, complete, well-rounded beer if you know what I mean.

It pours out to a beautiful golden color with a normal amount of head and intricate lacing, and the smell is that of pure, unadulterated hops (among other herbal aromas I've heard mentioned). The taste, however, is what has always blown me away: intense hop flavor that rivals few and makes Russian River's super-hot pepperonis seem bland and tasteless.

It pours a light golden color with a finger of white head that falls to a healthy coat over top that form a solid barrier to the liquid. Clarity is very good, but not pristine. Good looker. Nose is great. Candied grapefruit and oranges in a very sweet caramel glaze. Balance is fantastic. The hops are juicy and fruity and the malts are sweet, but not cloying. Nice. Flavor is nice as well. Very sweet in both hop and malt. Its right on with the aroma having candied orange and grapefruit and even sweet apircot flavors. After swallowing, there is a light peppery spice from the hop that moves right into a moderate bitterness that hangs on, letting me know its there, but its very smooth and not biting. Feel is thick with a light to moderate carbonation. The carbonation breaks up the fullness, making it more than highly drinkable. This beer is everthing I hoped it would be. No hint of the alcohol at all, very clean bitter on the finish, very juicy flavors, very nice mouthfeel. This beer is a keeper.

The body was clear pale in color, and the head was frothy and stable. The aroma was a milder version of the grapefruit and pine hops than the nephew beer. The hop flavor leaped off the taste buds with a citric and salty vigor. The malt was primarily a supporting player here, with a clean unobtrusive semi-sweet character. This was more of a spicy rather than bitter hop profile, which suited me just fine. The mouthfeel was medium and slick, with hops fading off rather than sticking around as a teeth coating film. This beer was very easy to drink, with no hint whatsoever of the 8% ABV.

Not much else, but this is an IPA - great smell for the style. Taste was amazing. One of the most perfectly balanced Double IPAs in my opinion. Nice touch of hops in the beginning, followed immediately by a lighter-bodied maltiness. This malt is not heavy at all (perfect for an IPA), but gives a nice balance and contrast to the hops that are to come. The malt here seems to be used more as a way to anchor the hops. The hops then take over at the end, and are very refreshing and citrusy. They linger a nice long while, perfect with the pizza being consumed at the same time. All in all, a perfect balance of hops and malt - something not found in many double IPAs. Mouthfeel is exceptional on this, exactly how I think IPAs should be - lighter-bodied (medium-bodied for an IPA) but full of flavor. Drinkability is perfect on this.

No, there's no balance here, but there's not supposed to be, and that is the main thrust of the impressive brewmanship. It lists so heavily hopwards, but never totally leaves its malt lineage behind.

Drinkability- well, I already drank half the growler, but... it is 8%... so, a score of 4 for that. Tastes like I could drink it all day, but with the alcohol content (no alcohol taste) it could well get one in trouble.

4.67,0.2,4.5,5,5,4,4,"Another offering I enjoyed at Russian River Brewing Co in Santa Rosa. This beer pored a bright copper to amber with a thick white head, that left a beautiful lace on the side of the glass. Overwhelming citrus grapefruit aroma. It has grapefruit rind, a little orange, grass and a bit of pine. Just a hint of caramel in the aroma on the finish. The flavor has loads of hop. Grapefruit, orange, pine, grass, hay, and every other descriptive term you can have for hops. There is a bit of caramel sweetness on the finish. The bitterness is ever-present, but not dominating. It has a nice, rich mouth feel, and is surprisingly drinkable. Awesome beer.","carln26","Oct 02, 2005"
4.62,-0.9,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Extreme hoppiness. And I mean it. But a damn-good hoppiness it is, combined with an oily, creamy mouthfeel that sticks to your palate and sucks the water out of your head. Lightly acidic with potent juniper berry and fruity grapefruit and lemon flavors, even after taking the plane from California. To heck with the ABV, I could still drink a few of these. A standout beer for sure.","PopeJonPaul","Sep 19, 2005"
4.7,0.9,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"I tried this double IPA on tap at the Russian River Brewery, and it was a focal point of my trip out to California. Needless to say I was not disappointed! The serving was in a standard pint glass, which sort of surprised me; I was expecting a 10 oz. pour. The nose of the beer was incredibly floral, which gave a good indication of the hefty hop presence. [Being a hop-head I was very happy with the level of hops included in this beer] The mouthfeel was somewhat standard compared to other double IPAs I've tried, but the taste lasted just long enough to entice another sip. I would definitely say that I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, and would recommend it highly to anyone who can find it. My only problem with this beer is that it is very difficult to get on the west coast. Russian River if you are reading this, please bottle the Pliny series, and distribute to the East Coast.","JustIPAs","Sep 16, 2005"

But most recently it was IMO 'best-of-show' at the 10th Annual Mammoth Bluespalooza at Mammoth Mountain CA. Up against 49 other outstanding, worthy competitors, Pliny once again showed how it has raised the bar for all other DIPA's to try and reach. Rich gold in color, clear yet translucent, almost looks like it would pour like honey. The rich smell of pine sap and grapefruit permeates from the glass immediately. Its almost like a wicked citrus fruit juice, except its 8.0%ABV is inescapable. It was the only tap that the other pourers were routinely sneaking off too to sneak a taste. A truly magical representation of the DIPA breed with a drinkability unequaled by any other. Now, dont get me started on Pliny the Younger . . .","lsholtzen","Aug 11, 2005"

4.74,1.7,4,5,5,4,4.5,"Light amber appearance, decent head of small bubbles. Laces in thick strings. Aroma is majorly piquant in lots of ways. HUGE hops, lupulin oozes out and sneaks into every corner of your mouth -- first citrusy and then ranging to pine and then back to a slightly sweeter pink grapefruit -- but always in your face. This is a partly comparative review, a face-off between this and Avery Maharaja IPA (as I was pouring it at the fest, I sucked down the last six ounces of Maharaja from a nearing empty bomber, well, about ten or eleven times), but frankly for me, its not a contest -- the Raj may win in body and sticky malt but the intense hops of Pliny just gush out in a way rarely seen in beerdom. One of the true best in class. Sometimes you get fairly detailed in a review, but just saying Pliny the Elder is INSANE says a lot. Hot damn, what's Pliny the YOUNGER like?","ADR","Jun 18, 2005"
4.62,-0.9,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I was pleasantly surprised to find this on tap in PA. My pint had a smooth orangeyellow color with a neat white head of tiny foam displaying excellent retention. The smell is of the hops, by the hops, and for the hops. It's an amazingly pungent green smell, absolutely piney, with strong bursts of grapefruit and lemon jucie made into a smoothie with spruce boughs. Wow. Hophead's dream. The taste is wonderful as well. The sharp hoppiness recedes on first sip and a light to medium malt base gives a slight sweetness before a rush of bitterness pours out in the finish. Sharp, nearly painful hop-bite in the aftertaste, but the blend is so floral, so raw and green and so sassy that it begs for more. I really enjoyed this beer. Drinkability might finally die when saplings start to grow from your palette, but I can't knock it too much on that fact. The most refined DIPA I've had, but if you strip something down this much and leave only the best, where else can you go from there? I'm sold on Rusian River and can't wait to try more from them.","99bottles","Jun 14, 2005"

I wax a bit here but this beer will wake your a-- up! I had no expectations and the pints opened my eyes to a beer that can hold a candle to my San Diego stonewarts- not as balanced as my masalade mama- but still very enjoyable,especially paired with the panfried trout supper. Aroma faintly of spring hynacith- but has the staying power of strong praire grass. Flavor grabs you in a hops vice, more a hops shroud.

Pliny is silk smooth with a great hop finish (25% simcoe hops). It reminded me a bit of Alpine's Exponential Hoppiness, which is one of my favorites. In leaving the brewery, I purchased a growler and kept it refrigerated for three days before catching a plane back to Southern California.
