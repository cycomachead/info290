This one is very smooth, well accented with hops, but on the malty sweet side. In my personal taste, it's good, and given that it's a partially oak aged blend, I would say it turned out quite well.

Overall a very creative and impressive drink. Drink fresh as the oakiness and the dry hops begin to fade in about 3 months (see bottle date on the neck of the bottle). If you cellar this you'll find yourself with a sweet old ale after 6 months or so (which is less interesting than this ale fresh in my opinion). With several years of aging this could become an amazing American barleywine (or a boring one) but I'd drink it fresh.","Harvest06","Dec 26, 2014"

The mouthfeel is not too thick, and this makes for the perfect autumn/winter beer.  The hops come through strong, as does the alcohol, but the overall aftertaste is smooth and balanced.  The aging in the oak of the two batches creates even more complexity in this brew, but doesn't have an overall woody taste.  As for Double IPAs, this one is the best.  This is also in my personal top 10 favorites, rating only behind Caldera's IPA.  Dogfish head does it again!","ColdBassHonkey","Nov 02, 2014"

Being on the west coast it seems everytime I get a Dogfish Head brew it's at least a couple months old. I'd love to try both this and 90 minute fresh, but even at a couple months the hops and oak really shine through in this one. A really good beer.

4.9,15.6,,,,,,"This is one beer that has a near constant presence in my fridge. Slightly hoppy (although the 70 IBU is masked very well) and dangerously smooth. Traces of oak and vanilla blend with the hop and the 10% leaves a slight heat feeling at the end. Perhaps the best balanced beer I have ever had, I find its warmth pleasant and comforting in the fall and winter yet the drinkability translates to a beer that is fantastic for sipping in the warmer months. While it is a bit pricey I would not pass it over. Give this one a shot if you haven't yet - you will not be disappointed.","Nick_Bousquet","Sep 18, 2014"

Better at room temperature but still has an odd essence. Not sure it would benefit from any bottle ageing.","RumDude","Aug 09, 2014"
4.39,3.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,"O - This was unique. The melding of big IPA elements with an oak aged beer is brilliant, balancing two big flavors to make a more subtle, deeper final product. One I'd like to actually cellar out of curiosity; I want to see how this ages. Brings something fresh and new to the IPA game.","Tsar_Riga","Aug 09, 2014"

4.1,-3.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 5/14/2014. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy orange amber color with a 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, caramel, toast, toffee, bread, oak, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of juicy citrus/floral hops, oak, and dark/bready malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, floral, grass, light pine, oak, light vanilla, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, caramel, toast, toffee, bread, floral, grass, light pine, oak, and floral/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance, robustness, and complexity of juicy citrus/floral hops, oak, and dark/bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a smooth, creamy, and lightly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent oak aged DIPA. All around great complexity and balance of citrus/floral hops, oak, and dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 25, 2014"

There is a stronger sense of barrel aging but less body. There's lots of vanilla but it's not sweet in any way. I like it but...if I'm going to use my ABV consumption allowance on the 10%, there are others I'd go to first.","seedyone","Jun 17, 2014"

Surprising smooth finish for me. Very almost velvety quality to how it goes down. I could have a few of these and be in deep trouble without even realizing it. Has the smooth oak aged feel but still has the bitterness at the very end that lingers nicely. If you get a bottle or are thinking of getting one, I highly recommend it. Very good and different take compared to the burgeoning number of DIPA's out there. Treat yourself.","Sound_Explorer","May 31, 2014"

This is a full-bodied IPA for sure. Not a beer you can get through quickly. If you let it sit in your mouth too long it leaves a really boozy aftertaste. But if you chug it down quickly, the honey taste serves to cover up the bitterness fairly well.

An agressively hopped beer with a big malt body. Sticky and resinous. Without a doubt one of the better offerings from Dogfish Head. Some tangy citrus, lightly sweet. The oak character is mild, which is probably a good thing. Overall, an interesting beer and one is have again.","Huhzubendah","Mar 22, 2014"
4.26,0.5,4,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,"I've had this in my fridge for awhile and finally decided to crack it tonight. This offering pours a handsome but unremarkable hazy orange with a thick foamy white head that lasts throughout the pour and leaves a very thick frothy lacing. The nose is quite sweet and malty with just a hint of hops and some vanilla oak notes. The mouthfeel is very smooth and pleasant with a great coating of the palate. It is definitely on the thicker side of medium bodied but given the taste one relishes in the lingering flavors. The flavor is outstanding. Deep and rich with malty sweetness yet fresh with a hop bite. All this is accented by the rich buttery oak and vanilla flavors from the aging process. This is a great beer and worth every accolade it has received. If you are looking for a hoppy dipa, then search elsewhere; but if you want a boatload of balance and richness, then look no further.","lochef81","Mar 21, 2014"

Wow, this is one smooth hopped-up high ABV brew! The oak-aged properties are obviously in play with this beer. Yes, the alcohol content is 10% but hardly noticeable among the citrus, oak and spice aroma. The taste appeared to be citrus, pine, some spices, and something else; not quite sure. There was an almost thick-like mouth feel with a creamy finish on the palate. Personally, for me, as the beer rose in temperature I enjoyed it even more. Again, Dogfish Head has amazed me with their ability to concoct an amazing craft beer!","dpgoblejr","Mar 12, 2014"

The nose is full of wood, sherry, and vanilla notes with subtle hops. The Northwestern hops taste amazing blended with the oak wood richness. This beer is very thick in the mouth, if you slush it, the beerexpands and deepens in flavor. I am not an over the top fan of 60 & 90 minute IPA but love Burton Baton.

Moderate hop flavor for an IPA with more than average malt sweetness. Not cloying. Getting some spicy tannins from the oak barrel aging in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is better than average. Decently thick and creamy with moderate carbonation. A very good beer. The oak aging adds some interesting complexity.","elmore","Jan 28, 2014"

Taste: Dried fruit and hops. The hop flavor doesn't over power the beer though. Allows you to keep searching for the other flavors. Very malty. A burnt woody flavor is there, but not a lot. Very smooth and the 10% is hidden well in my opinion. You could tell me 7-8 and id have no trouble believing it. Definitely up there on my favorites list.

The aroma has an almost sour presence with citrus notes behind it and woody overtones. The taste starts with a strong Warrior hop punch right out of the gate, moving to an oaky bitterness in the middle when the malt depth and prune notes surface. It finishes citrusy with a bit of lingering, drawling mouth feel. You certainly get the English Ale yeast throughout the experience providing a somewhat sweet foundation to the taste. Surprisingly drinkable for a 10%er. Another nice "Big Beer" from DFH.","Hoperator","Nov 29, 2013"

4.65,9.7,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Pours a nice dark amber. Resilient off-white head. Huge citrusy hop aroma. Taste has a great malt backbone. Tons of hops. Not overly bitter initially, but with a pleasant bitter aftertaste. Just a touch of burnt oak from the aged beer, although I'm not sure I would have noticed it if it wasn't in the description on the bottle. Nice full bodied mouthfeel. Boozy but it's not really noticeable. Dangerous. Overall, an absolutely great DIPA.","burnstar","Sep 24, 2013"

No head tastes like a sweet wine, always been one of my favorites, aged very well even though it aged much longer than I wanted. Really doesn't taste like an IPA, kinda like a sweet stout and barleywine concoction - very good!","dwalters","Sep 22, 2013"

The smell has some of the fruity notes one would expect from an IPA, mixed with a great oaky smokiness. Really fantastic. The taste is similar- a great balance between a hoppy IPA and a barrel aged ale. Definitely one of my favourite beers out there.","Cheld","Sep 18, 2013"

The beer poured a nice clear amber with thin white head that laced nicely. The scent was full of fresh hop that carried pine and citrus notes. The taste was very sweet and malty which helped to balance the bitter citrus hops. There was also a nice subtle back drop of pine. The mouthfeel was full body with subtle carbonation.

4.15,-2.1,4,4.5,4,4.25,4,"Not something I could have all the time, but it was a real treat to try this in midst of all the hype. The oak is not too refined, and I have a feeling this is best fresh rather than aged, but the earthy, floral flavors are pretty awesome overall, especially the vanilla/orange/tobacco combo that I previously mentioned. Indeed, it seems that aging hoppy, amber beers in oak bring out those aromas as opposed to the dark fruit/caramel flavor that the same process brings out in, say, stouts. Great stuff - definitely one of the most memorable beers I've had by these guys in midst of all the experimentation.","magictacosinus","Jun 27, 2013"

Each sip I discover different tastes, and its very, very smooth. I still can't believe its a 10%. IF you see this, BUY IT & TRY IT.","Tonmeister","Jun 16, 2013"

IT had a wonderful aroma, smells of fruit and malt. For a 10%er, this is tame and goes a bit too smooth for a high alcohol beer. Malty flavor comes out first with some vanilla, and a hop bite, the oak really tones this beer down. This was one of the best beers I've had. Great job by Dogfish!!","jduffy21","May 25, 2013"

(just an assumption) But I have to be honest, the more I drank it, the more I enjoyed it. After I got over the fact that it wasn’t as hoppy as expected, I actually really enjoyed this. Another plus to this beer was that it left a good aftertaste in my mouth. It left me wanting more.","oi_scout_jessie","May 13, 2013"

Yet, my taste buds were blown away after the first sip. There are so many flavors in this one and you can taste each of the beer styles that comprise its legacy. The smooth toffee flavors of the English Ale rest well alongside the floral notes of the IPA. The mouthfeel is smooth, almost silky, with a semi-sweet after taste that lingers ever so slightly. This beer is incredible, showing respect to the styles that give it its context and balancing them well. If you like imperial ales or IPAs, try this. This beer is beautiful.","jmendels","Apr 12, 2013"

Smells sweet and mellow, yet hoppy and floral at the same time. Like sweet citrus fruit blended with the spicier hop aroma. Taste is like the regular 90 minute, but mellowed out; sweetness predominates up front sliding cleanly into a tastefully bitter hop finish. Alcohol is not noticeable at all, which is surprising for 10%. Mouthfeel is smooth and relatively full. Overall a great beer; perfect for IPA lovers who also want a more mellow complex sipping beer.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Mar 29, 2013"

The IPA aspects are wonderfully hoppy and the wooden qualities imparted by the old ale are so brilliant that I'm surprised it hasn't been tried in any other beers (that I know of). Very very nice carbonation, intense but not annoyingly so. The sweetness of this beer is very vanilla rather than hoppy, but as the beer warms the hoppiness begins to dominate more. Excellent.","falc0n2600","Feb 25, 2013"

I'm not surprised many people have mistaken this beer for a barleywine, because it may as well be one. IT shares so many of the characteristics displayed by a hoppier version of an american barleywine. It just needs a bit more barley. Overall this is a fantastic beer. Ended up giving a few bottles to friends as presents since DFH is hard to come by up here, and they seemed very happy.","Zachtheporter","Feb 24, 2013"

Right away, after you open and taste, you get sweetness, and then bold strong ale that comes after. Not harsh, but smooth and subtle like good whiskey. I'm not one for imaginative fruits and spices, what I taste is craftsmanship. But there is a syrup/molasses scent emitting from my glass. A very rich, enjoyable aroma. I don't think there is another American style brew that can top this off. If you come across Burton Baton, buy it. IT'S Very, very, good.","CornellAquired","Dec 28, 2012"

3.96,-6.6,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"O - nice brew. The barrel element added a nice piece of complexity. Managed to blend the hops, malt and barrel very well. Each element is complex on its own, but doesn't fight the others. I think maybe this would have been a tad better at 8% ABV rather than 10%, as its pretty hot. But, I will certainly track this down again.","Beerandboards","Dec 07, 2012"

When it's fresh, it's REALLY hoppy, but the oak and malt keeps it somewhat in check, though it still leans towards the hoppy side. Age this for a year+ and the vanilla/caramel sweetness will really show itself, while the hops recede. A favorite beer of mine, in any state that I can drink it.

As far as style, it seemed to fall somewhere in between a barleywine and a milder DIPA. This beer is definitely worth a try just to experience the robustness of the bready yeast, the malt sweetness, and the graininess.

The sweetness is a little off-putting but the grapefruit hints are deliciously enticing. The beer tastes wonderfully bitter with an even better malty balancing that leaves this beer kissing my taste buds, with light spicy burning alcohol coming from the high ABV. The beer begins with bitter biting grapefruit and then opens briefly into sweet cloying malt and alcohol, before closing into a superb mixture of malty caramel and bitter grapefruit with light spicy notes from the bread and slight biscuity malts also coming through. This beer is superb, and gives me hope for barrel aged IPA’s. The finish is to die for, and the functions of both the imperial IPA and the English-style old ale. Mouthfeel is mellow and chewy, with lovely jelling feels on the tongue. It leaves the mouth dry with a slight linger of cloying malts and alcohol that’s wonderfully dampened by the bitters from the grapefruit hops. Overall this is a great off centered ale from Dogfish Head, and a superb balancing job. I’m very glad that barrel aged IPA’s work. I’ve heard that there are some great ones out there, and I’ve had some mediocre ones myself that dim the hops far too much, so I’m very happy to have seen one work.

4.03,-5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and I thought it was a good example of an American Strong Ale, it had just enough Old Ale aspects as it had DIPA aspects, it blurred the line between the two and it was what it intended to be. This beer had ok drinkability, it went down fairly smooth for how strong it was, but the sweetness and warming alcohol would prevent me from wanting another, one is just enough, it's a sipper. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and the complexity in both the aroma and the taste, they were both nice. What I liked least about this beer was that the sweetness got a little out of hand and I would like to have more barrel flavors and aromas in this beer. I might buy this beer again for a special occasion, but at $3.89 a bottle it's pretty expensive and there are many other beers that taste similar for a better price, so I don't think I'll be buying this again anytime soon, but I recommend giving it a try especially if you are into the higher octane stuff. All in all I have to say that Dogfish Head delivered just what I thought they would, another strong and complex beer that's a good once in awhile beer, I enjoyed it and I'm really interested in the idea of blending beers and would like to see some more brewery's experiment with this, good job guys, this is a good beer to sip on.","StoutHunter","Aug 29, 2012"

Flavor is bready malt, dark fruit and pine hops right up front, a malty hoppy middle and pine and citrus hop finish. Resembles a hopped up American barley wine. Moderate to heavy body with good mouth feel. High ABV, but complex enough to be great as a single glass. Begs to be aged. I will comply.","LiquidAmber","Aug 03, 2012"

It's heavily hopped, and sufficiently bitter, but doesn't allow the hops to be the singular focus of the recipe... allowing it to develop and become a multidimensional brew. It seems (to me) that a lot of today's IPAs participate in a hops-arms-race... focused on maxing out their IBUs and blowing you away with piney citrusy hops. Other dogfish head ales are no exception. And that's all great sometimes. But for this beer the brewers were able to take a step back, find all the crucial, fundamental elements of what makes those two-dimensional IPAs so appealing, and add plenty of depth and complexity. You'll love it.","DivaTron","Jul 22, 2012"

Oaked IPAs can tend to go overboard, but this one has the perfect subtelty of vanilla oak in both aroma and flavor. Serious warming alcohol going on, but not overpowering. Color is a beautiful copper with a creamy head. Neat beer here. Revisited this a few times and batches seem to vary. Sometimes a big candy sweet bomb (less thrilled with that), but when super fresh some batches are huge hop bombs. Downgraded a bit for the variety but still enjoy this one. My opinion is that this is best enjoyed after a month or two. The flavors seem to blend more seemlessly when the hops aren't overbearing and it hasn't yet turned into an overly syrupy barleywine.","BMMillsy","Jul 03, 2012"

The fact that I enjoyed a beer that I ordinarily would not should tell you it's good. Fans of IIPAs, Old Ales, barrel-aged beers, and interesting interpretations of styles should seek this out.

Poured with a rich, rocky off-white foam that slowly reduces to a thick cap that leaves huge sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. Resinous citrus hop aromas are prevalent with a musty earthiness and intensely sweet maltiness. Creamy smooth feel with soft, delicate carbonation. Earthy, musty flavor up front that gives way to a quickly emerging citrus hop flavor into the middle. Citrus and sweet malt flavors through the middle toward the end hat transition to a mellow, musty, vanilla flavor right before the finish . Finishes with a bitter pine hop bite that ushers in a final earthy, musty flavor before a piney hop and slightly boozy finale. Fabulous feel and flavor complexity.","IronLover","May 15, 2012"

The oak is not too dominant as is found so often with oak aged IPAs, it blends very well with the medium bitterness, caramel sweetness, and earthy citrus hop flavors. Very nice.

I'd recommend trying this at any age.","BigCheese","Apr 21, 2012"
4.13,-2.6,4.5,4,4,5,4,"O- Although the oak is not normal for an American D-IPA, it adds something fun. It does, however, cause it not to have the taste characteristics I look for in a D-IPA. Not enough citrus in the taste. I feel obliged to take off points from the taste for the things it is missing for this style. It really needs a style category of its own. It is not sessionable because you can really only drink one or two in a day without getting hammered. It is a terrific brew worthy of sharing with only the most special guest. It is a little pricey, but I think it is worth it. It wont make my "best double ipa" list because it is not true to the style, but it makes my "top 5 beers ever" list hands down. Very well done and worth the price and the wait. Another great Dogfish offering.","HoppySailor","Apr 21, 2012"

The old ale blended with the IPA and aged in oak for a month is just perfect. I just had this after a Sierra Nevada Hoptimum(which I love) and the smoothness of Burton just kills it. All week I've had different beers and the oak and old ale/IPA just keep bringing me back to it. Easily my favorite DogFishHead to date and along w.

A thin laced tight bubbled ring forms around the glass, decent legs and sticky slime. Piny citrus hops burst through with a full alcohol plum, big caramel malt follows with a sublte earthy wood, big vanilla and alcohol on the finish , so intersting. Smooth grapefruit flavor without the bitter excellent malt backing, big juicy fruit taste can't get enough. The oak really shines on the taste and gives it such a mellow fresh tasting candy like feel, no booze to be found. Big on feel an body, extremely smooth and mellow for such a big beer. Overall this is a real treat. Fantastic malt an oak profile buttery smooth feel. Not a hop lovers delight however because of the aging process.

Crisp hoppy flavor hits first, then follows with sweet honey and grapefruit. Finishes off with oak and some residual hop flavor. Enjoyed this beer alot. Had a very dogfish head style taste that remindes me of 90 minute ipa. Could have a little smoother finish, also fell it was a little too sweet for my taste.

There is a sparse film covering, but it is minimal. The nose is subtle to start, but grows rapidly towards overwhelming, with resiny, fresh hops abundant, and a light malt sweetness in the background. The beer's flavors are rich and full, with a roasted malt backbone. A flourish of hops ride off onto the palate, with a peppering and rich, resiny character. Some light citrus highlights and an oaky, earthy tone, as well. The aftertaste is a good balance of malty sweet and hops bitterness, with some oak character, as well. The finish has a mid-linger, and slowly clears the palate, leaving a slight film in mouth. Good brew. Strong flavors on a very easy to palate body.","GarthDanielson","Jan 07, 2012"

What ever it is, it smells like a sack of grapefruit from the valley. The Rio Grande Valley - where John Wayne pretended to kick ass and act in that movie from a million years ago.

Much warmth also at the end, from the amount of alcohol, obviously. The 'bite' that you would expect from an IPA is much more mellow than I expected. I would say the perfect amount of bitterness of the hops. The balance is very nice. Mouthfeel is great, too.

It hides the 10% alcohol very well and is overall a solid high end IPA. At 15+ for a four pack, it's a bit expensive, and for the price you could easily get 2 six packs of something just as good. The beer lives up to the hype, but is not outstandingly better than it's competitors.","BenHesk12","Dec 30, 2011"

Aging a beer that is usually best fresh and still keeping the hoppiness intact is not easy, but Dogfish succeeds here. The oak dries out the body a little bit, which counteracts some of the sweetness from the malt. It is still a little bit heavy on the caramel malt for me, but the oak reduces the impact. Overall, this is pleasantly drinkable.","KickInTheChalice","Dec 23, 2011"

The aroma of hops is incredible - strong, lively grapefruit up front with extremely fresh floral notes as well. Very sweet, almost candy-like. I haven't had the pleasure of such an aroma since I've had Flower Power or Pliny - my two fav. IPAs. After a healthy mouthful the beer glides across my palate with a pleasant tingling sensation. At first I am picking up the bittersweet piney flavor and at the same time, a dry earthy, wooden finish. There is this syrupy, yet biting nature of it enveloping the entire experience, which is warming me up as well. I just realized this beer reminded me of a casked IPA I recently had on tap. I think I may save one of these and open it next year... It's a very complex, interesting beer, worthy of savoring!","Neorebel","Nov 28, 2011"

I’d recommend it to anyone who enjoys the hoppier side of things, and anyone who enjoys a complex thinker at the same time. It seemed like it’d be on the pricy side, but after getting into a bottle I’d say it easily warrants the sticker price. Any and all DFH naysayers should drink this beer. Love it.","fmccormi","Nov 27, 2011"

3.88,-8.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured into 13 oz tulip. Pours a cloudy reddish orange, with a one inch head, nice looking lacing, not a ton of it. Smell is some orange, pine, a little breadyness, and some fresh cut grass. Taste is similar, with some oak and some alcohol. Not as much as fresh, but this was bottled on 11/22/10. Never figured out if I like more fresh or with time, I have aged a few on the suggestion of my fellow BA's. Definitely less boozey, but as a hop head less tasty for my liking. Body on the heavy side, but drinkable for it's abv. A very good oaked DIPA.","SawDog505","Nov 12, 2011"
4.17,-1.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"O: this is an extremely well balanced brew. It doesn't hit you with that overly bitterness that characterizes some IPAs, which is a nice feature. Highly recommended.","olimpia84","Nov 10, 2011"

3.82,-9.9,4.5,2.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Overall, this is a very interesting beer.

4.24,0,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Overall, a very solid beer, of course, from Dogfish.

Definitely worth a try on tap.","barczar","Nov 02, 2011"
4,-5.7,4,4,4,4,4,"o - Overall a very nice beer, but again, not what I look for in an IPA. Lots of wood and caramel and not a ton of hops. Would like to have this one again, but not when I'm looking for something hoppy.","mdfb79","Nov 02, 2011"
4.08,-3.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"T: A good deal of sweetness upfront followed by some nice notes of oak and hop resin. Usually, oak aged ipas don't do it for me, but the oak was restrained enough in this to let the rest of the flavors shine. Really nicely done.","notchucknorris","Nov 01, 2011"

3.83,-9.7,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Bottled 7-20-11. Nice hazy spice color. Smells of C hops very earthy some burnt sugar and a little pine resin. Head develops and hangs on. Taste follows the nose but the sweetness is there and the alcohol is there too. Slight damp wood aromas circulate in the mouth. Very well carbonated. As it warms it becomes a bit winelike. Over all decent but not worth the money.","jizfiasco","Oct 20, 2011"
4,-5.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a lightly hazed orange-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, orange citrus and a small oakiness.

4.08,-3.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"I was surprised by the sweetness of this up front and then was hit by the bitterness and alcohol which lingers for quite a while. This is a man's drink. If IPAs were considered the Martini of ales, Burton Baton would be an Old Fashioned. It's deceiving though, as the alcohol flavor is present, but not overwhelming and the flavors absorbed by the barrel wood help offset this flavor. This is the first DFH beer I've thoroughly enjoyed, and I have to think it has to do with the lower viscosity which balances out the flavors much better than their other IPAs. Now if only I could find a 4 pack in my area!","Philousa","Sep 27, 2011"

Sweet malts and oak to start off taste, subtle but present hops in the middle; a little piney, some dark fruit, ends with a nice bitterness paired with a warming from the alcohol.

Waited to try it until I could no longer resist at a bar. Like most offerings from the company, I am disappointed. Lacks depth and is too boozy.

This doesn't do so badly if treated like an aged barleywine, but I imagine this to be a more dynamic offering fresh.

Unknown, so I'll give my opinion based upon what I think this beer COULD have been: One month in oak didn't add much. This still has a strong IPA presence. I would like to see this after 6 months on oak. I'm a big fan of DFH 90 min. In my opinion, this was good, but there was too much of the 90 min present to really allow me to classify this as a separate distinct beer. I liked the idea, perhaps more time on oak would allow for development of its own name.","Nesued","Aug 27, 2011"

4.55,7.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"On Tap at the DFH brew pub. Pours hazy orange hue with a long lived white head and much carbonation. Aroma is of apricots, herbal hops with hints of caramel malt.

The smell is definitely oaky and there is q alcohol presence as the beer warms. But my nose was stuffed up so I didn't get much else. The flavor is oaky with spicey hops and a definite warm alcohol presence in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation.

4.13,-2.6,4.5,4,4,5,4,"Love this brew. I'll start with a review of the '09, this is what I am basing my score off of. Bottled 03/30/09 C. Consumed 08/22/11. Color is a deep burnt orange. A fine white foam rises quickly with minimal effort. After a minute, it reduces to a small ring around the glass with spotty clings. Aromas are very woody at this stage, much of the hop gusto has mellowed and melded into the beer. Caramel, cinnamon sticks, oak, and red licorice are all strong in the nose. flavor is very bold and rich. Again, the hop intensity has really dropped, but this allows pine sap, vanilla, oak tannin, caramel, and baked apples to dominate the palate. The finish is nicely firm and intensly bitter. The fine carbonation is very present and compliments the bitterness to form a prickly full bodied finish, cleansing the sticky nectar off the tongue. The mouthfeel is delightful. Up front the beer is very rich and the oak really shines through with this age on it. The faded hops compliment the malts greatly, the malt base has gained more sweetness and the hops have reduced to a sticky pine flavor and a hint of sweet fruit. Nicely mouth coating, and the intense finish with a great deal of carbonation and bitterness refreshes the palate for another sip. Love this beer, 2010 and 2011 review to be added another day.","Tripphop","Aug 22, 2011"

The feel is medium with okay carbonation, there is a little bitterness in it. The taste is a little vanilla, some oak, the malts and a little lingering bitterness, much more of a vanilla oak malty taste than an IPA one.

Taste does not have the malt-up-front Im used to and expect in the DFH IPA. Much more subtle. The vanilla/toffee character comes across stronger than I expected too.

3.94,-7.1,3,4,4,4,4,"Poured a 12 oz. bottle into my new fancy Stone tulip! Bottle dating seemed to have rubbed off, most likely a newer release bought at Whole Foods for $2.79. Aggressive pour yielded little head but the sediment in the bottle clouded up the beer, left an unappealing dark copper hazy appearance, not much carbonation. Smell was nice caramelized wood, slight piney hops, not overtly alcoholic even at 10%. The taste was just as good, again with the caramel but the hops are less pronounced. Not a ton of carbonation but it works, I like the malty back bone and very little hop bitterness. The alcohol is well integrated here. I had expected this beer to be reminiscent of a barleywine and it did remind me more of a BW than a DIPA. I really liked what the wood treatment did to this DIPA. Good beer, I will drink more of this, and may cellar a few.","wchollif","Jun 07, 2011"

He knew his own shortcoming, Kyle Rancors wasn’t the most outspoken person, or the most witty, but he had the ability to defrag your kernel faster than most in that bustling metropolis. That wasn’t an entendre, his skills were really that misaligned. Sure, he could carry average banter, had a working knowledge of Gray’s Anatomy that made him seem cloyingly sweet, just no one that a girl wanted to have a raucous session with. Performing maintenance on servers that helped others find love just seemed like an ironic twist of lemon into his heart.

Taste is also if pine. Oily textures and it I'd evident that this gas been aged in oak barrels. As it warms, the alcohol starts to peak its ugly head. A low carbonated beers makes it smooth to drink. Complex as there are different levels at various temperatures. I keep checking the bottle that claims 10% abv. This is hard to believe because it is easy drinking us very well balanced.

You can tell they made sure that every single taste wasn't full on in your face but everything is just enough there so that it has this complete unique blend to it where it all combines into one taste instead of a bunch of separate tastes. Alcohol is very well masked and if anything adds the spicyness that mixes in with the subtle vanilla and oak wood tastes perfectly. Almost too perfectly well balanced. With it being well balanced the two most outright flavors are of course the sweet toffee malts and citrus hops with the other tastes (oak, wood, vanilla) coming in subtly. A plus beer all the way around and another all time favorite from Dogfish Head.","thebrood1987","May 22, 2011"

Smell is tight, evergreen hops with a ton of citrus, a lot of mineral, and a little medicinal.. with some muted malt aromas. Taste starts off kind of vanilla-like, then morphs into those tight hops. A bit more of that mineral upfront as well. The finish is an absolute oak beast, very sweet IPA all the while, but tastes like a ton of wood.

A dense white head forms and follows the beer down the glass, leaving pretty heavy lacing in its wake. The dark copper liquor is completely clear with moderate carbonation. The nose is apple skin, dried apricot, and slightly piney hops. The flavor shows apricot, honey, and hops, with a slight minerality and a sourness at the finish. The wood shows at the very end, lending a nice balance. The alcoholic strength does not show. The mouthfeel is heavy and coating. Overall the beer is a nicely balanced IPA, not just a coarse hop bomb, but with a definite bitterness. Both the wood and the hops are restrained, allowing the malt to show through. A very nice American IPA that is a refreshing change from the overdone oak and hop teas that are flooding the market.","MCDuhamel","Mar 16, 2011"

3.88,-8.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This bottle was purchased based on the sad news of DFH pulling out of WI. Pours a cloudy, golden-red color with a finger of off-white head that leaves lacing (not that I care). Smells malty sweet with a touch of hops. I don't get any barrel in the nose. Smells pretty good. The taste is very enjoyable - a bit maltier version of 90 minute with just a touch of oak. Hoppy, but balanced. The mouthfeel is medium heavy with good carbonation. Very drinkable and something that goes down quick. Maybe a touch too sweet to be great in that department. This is an oak aged ipa that extreme hop lovers won't like, but I think people who appreciate balance do. That said, this beer isn't as balanced as 90 minute.","seeswo","Mar 13, 2011"

Smell is of citrus hops, a bit of malt and alcohol. A lot of alcohol in the taste I noticed. This is more malty than the IPAs I usually get here in the PNW. So it was a fun diversion. Taste is mostly dominated by malts and oaken bourbon tastes. Alcohol still comes in pretty hard. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation is pretty muted, but this beer has a full feel.

They are just about right as far as I am concerned. There is also a nice earthiness going on. The body is fairly heavy but at the same time creamy.

The hops have faded and it's sweeter than normal but it doesn't really take away too much. It's still pretty good. It tastes more like the Squall right now.

Starts with some refreshing citrus hops, grapefruit and orange, before moving onto some more pine notes as you get into the beer. The oak is definitely present at the finish along with a little vanilla which creates a sweet malt to balance out the beer perfectly.

The flavor is quite complex, initially a citrus/spicy hop flavor hits, followed by a smooth, caramel-raisin malt, and then finishes with a bit of warming alcohol and a pronounced hop flavor and firm hop bitterness.

A truly great aroma is like lingerie on a gorgeous woman and this was that. The flavors were also a delicious, complex, big blend. I tasted (multiple?) caramel malt(s), chocolate malt, a lot of wood (oak), residual sugars, tropical fruits, complex citrusy hops, and spices. Weird for a Double IPA and very sugary for one as well. Yet I have trouble deducting points for this because I feel it is trying to expand the idea of what an Imperial/Double IPA could/should be.

The nose comprises light, crisp grapefruit, green apples, vanilla, and a more-than-healthy amount of creamy caramel. The taste echoes the smell, with a strong caramel base highlighted by some sticky pine and light citrus. The body is a stoic medium, with a moderate carbonation and a slightly resinous finish. Overall, a more-than-solid DIPA, though it would have been nice to get more oak (rather than simply a firm maltiness).

The taste is more bitter than I was anticipating from the aroma, with a tongue prickling bitterness the entire time its in you mouth. Underneath that there's a good deal of warmth from the alcohol and a full, creamy body with nice, toasted malt flavor. The finish is lingering and astringent.

It pours a beautiful deep amber with plenty of head. The nose entices with aromas of pine, citrus, and oak. Taste is similar, with plenty of aggressive hops rounded out by the oak. This is a wonderfully complex beer, with lots of flavors mingling harmoniously. I could drink this all night (or at least until the 10% ABV puts me on my ass). Definitely a top 10 beer for me and easily my favorite Dogfish offering.","MrSnrub","Apr 22, 2010"

The aroma is nothing like an imperial IPA, and that might be a good thing. Lots of caramel and toasted malts hit the nose and a very very subtle citric hop component in the background. One taste and you realize this is a truly imperial IPA indeed. The first rush is a doughy, sweet, sticky kind of experience, but the citrusy/grapefruit-like hops follow it up right there, ready to kick some ass, and it might be yours! This beauty sticks all over the place - tongue, cheeks, teeth, throat, and makes you want to go back for more. I'm yet to be disappointed by any Dogfish offerings.","raoulduke37","Apr 21, 2010"
4,-5.7,4,4,4,4,4,"OK, I have to ding this one a bit for lack of complexity. I'm really not getting the "two thread blend of young and wood aged Imperial IPA." In fact, it's reminding me a lot more of my first Bell's Hopslam, which I had for the first time (and did not review) about a week ago. Not a whole lot of complexity, just pretty much in-yo-face hops. To me, a better balance of hops to malt would help bring out the hops. As it is, the tongue suffers burnout after one beer. A good beer no doubt, but a bit off the charts for me.","jettjon","Apr 20, 2010"
4.25,0.2,4.5,4.5,4,5,4,"Well, lotsa of flavors, the smell is much more blended than the taste. The flavor is a damp wooden kind of quality, Oak I suppose with a very bitter edge on that Oak. The juiciness of the hops comes after the bitter edge and supports it to the aftertaste, which retains much of the bitterness and the Oak. The malt in this is sweet and supportive to just how big this beer is but I have trouble telling when it's at play in the profile. The mouth feel is full and sticky, much better than most IPAs or even Doubles I've had lately.","Thur123","Apr 19, 2010"
4.17,-1.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Poured into tulip a dark amber, brownish orange with a nice tan creamy head that gathers excellent lacing all over the glass. Appears rather dark for an IPA, but is expected due to the oak aging and blending of these ales. It does actually look quite a bit similar to the 90 minute, but this should come as no surprise. Scent is nice oaked maltiness, with a bit of hop fruitiness concealed in the background. Very balanced. Great smell here, really enhances the entire experience of this ale. This has a great, creamy feel about it. Not overly carbonated, very pleasing to the palate. The alcohol content is masked on this bad boy, making it super drinkable. Just be sure to consume wisely.","BabyBastard","Apr 19, 2010"

Little head for a DIPA (and too dark), but thick with good retention and evidence of lacing. Aroma has brown sugar, sticky flora, oak, and alcohol. The flavor prominently features caramel malts in large quantities along with an assertive bitterness with some resinous and floral hopping. The finish maintains the floral hop flavor with an excess of caramelly cookielike malts. This beer is overloaded with its simple, cloying malt character and while it is balanced with bitterness there is not much complexity in the hop bill either. Despite all the malt and hops it is still a bit hot too. Medium to ful bodied with a tight, medium-full carbonation.

It tasted like citrus/piney hops, toffee, roasted malts, some honey and a hint of wood. It was interesting to have the malt in there.

4.79,13,4.25,4.5,5,4.5,5,"11/27/13-a very well aged bottle (3+ years at least) that looked great after the pour; 2 finger creamy beige head that faded very slowly and left incredible lacing coating the sides. The nose is very sweet, like a blend of dark fruit, syrup, rum/wine, vanilla, oaky, brown sugar, citrus hops a light booze; the sweetness jumps out, but is very complex and somehow soft and alluring. There are some many fruity notes that I won’t even attempt to describe the intricate aroma’s associated with this brew – get one, age it and experience it for yourself. Flavor is sweet and boozy, again with a massive dark fruit presence that includes cherry, red grapefruit, pear and rotting apple, syrup/molasses, rum/red wine like merlot, vanilla, oaky or smoky notes, brown sugar, citrus hops, floral hops, cinnamon and light booze like bourbon; the oak aging seems to have overtaken the hops from the DIPA blend, but the flavor is very smooth and complex, port-like in the way it forces you to sip and savor. This is mellow and hides the ABV wonderfully, with so much flavor that it’s almost like a wine at this point with mead like qualities in a good way. It’s very hard to accurately describe the flavor, but quite easy to state (again) that this is a very delicious hybrid and definitely worth seeking out","CHickman","Mar 07, 2010"

It was a nice reminder to make an appointment with the dentist but a rather underwhelming beer. The beer looks fine, golden amber with a small white head. The aroma is honey, hops and sweet malt, a warning of things to come. There's a hint of oak, which I wish was about ten times stronger. The hops are sort of a tropical fruit lifesaver note. The flavor is way too sweet with no noticeable dryness from the wood or balancing bitter hop bite. The hops come through as a candied version of themselves, which sorta works in the 120 min but falls flat here. I can deal with one or the other, but the sweetness combined with lackluster hop flavor are what killed the beer for me. Squall remains my favorite DFH IPA by a wide margin.","popery","Mar 04, 2010"

Low dryness in the finish with a fruity, rum-like aftertaste. The hops produce a juicy bite, but Burton is very malty for a DIPA.

The aroma is a clean, bright citrus, light grapefruit and a hint of caramel bread and raisin, very nice. The flavor offers awesome tart citrus pine enveloped in fruit nougat thickness. There's a note of alcohol for sure but this is reasonably drinkable, presenting a smooth, viscous brew. Touches of licorice and caramel/vanilla, root beer, somewhat cloying. There are some herbal nuances here as well. Just a fun blend of things that combine IPA bitterness and old ale malt complexity. This could become a regular item for lts of folks, including me. It's finely carbonated for a lively but full mouthfeel. It disipates quickly on the tongue with a delightfully tart kiss, begging for more...and more.","Durge","Dec 29, 2009"

The initial taste is a strong burst of heavy hoppiness typical of most IPA's but the surprise was the lingering taste in the mouth. Definite hints of citrus, pine resin, toffee and perhaps maybe even butterscotch, blend for a smoothness in the drinkability.

For a special treat, you can leave one ounce of beer in the bottle and put it in your car in the hot sun for a few hours. Makes a great air freshener...seriously. Love it at any age, fresh or old, love it warm, love it cold. Basically a combination of my favorite two styles...double IPA and aged strong ale.

Both had a little aftertaste bite. 90 was crisper. Burton was medium bodied and oily. Drinkability? I liked it a lot, but this is a 10.0 ABV, better drink it at home.

The flavor is BIG and soft. Nice caramel malt body with warm sweetbread notes. It has the big hop profile that I've come to expect whenever DFH does an IPA, and they do them about as well as anyone. The bitterness is just right, and doesn't overpower the malt. The oak barrel aging does a nice job of smoothing everything out and adding a somewhat chardonnay-like oaky note. It really speaks to the level of effort and devotion that DFH puts into its beers that it can continually push our limits to review them. This is a very special beer, to be shared only with loved ones... and kept away from the unbelievers. Or so they say.","BenSelf","Aug 06, 2009"

Some woody earthy hops too. Tastes of caramel, vanilla, lots of oak, quite fruity too. Flavours of brown sugar are huge. The hops don't play as much as a role as I thought they would, and overall this is a lot sweeter than I expected. The finish does show earthy caramel malts with fresh hop bitterness. Long finish.

As far as drinkability this is something to appreciate at a very moderate pace. The fact this is 10% is very well masked by the big flavor.

Mouthfeel had a nice residue to it, this beer stayed on my palette for a bit, and its what I have come to expect from an Imperial IPA. Unlike some doubles there is a much stronger malty backbone, which I prefer as it increases the complexity of the taste. Hop citrus taste up front, with a hint of Oak throughout with a nice resiny smooth finish of malt. Nice and complex. Drink ability is up there but it is not something I would slam. This beer is to be savored. Very few Imperial IPA are better.","Tetano","Jul 17, 2009"

4,-5.7,4,4,4,4,4,"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. Bottled on 03/30/09 indicated on the label. Poured a translucent amber with a one inch, frothy, off-white head that sizzled and popped below the cap before it eventually settled in a consistent quarter inch of foam. Copious tiny bubbles present in solution. Creamy clumps of lacing congealed as the brew receded. Nose was resinous, with caramel, a hint of grapefruit and some light oak qualities. Wood comes out in the taste, but lacking some of the big malty, grapefruit character of a typical DIPA. Exceptional balance - wood nicely blends with the other flavors without kicking you in the teeth (like oak-aged Unearthly does); some resinous hops comes out at the finish. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and lightly effervescent - not really oily or viscous like some DIPAs. Good drinkability with a well-hidden abv at 10%. A nice, slightly more complex alternative to 90 Minute.","Jwale73","Jul 05, 2009"

At first, the oak flavor is quite subtle, but becomes more prominent after a while. It's surprisingly light and has a noticeable, but not overpowering bite. You'd never guess the ABV is nearly as high as it truly is. Great beer. I'd certainly buy it again!","McNealc31","Jul 03, 2009"
4.09,-3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a clear copper color with a tight dense khaki colored head that settled into a light cap. The aroma is of piney, grapefruit hops, asprin, and a bready honey malt. The taste starts off sweet, some honey, oranges, mangos and sugar. This is followed by a piney, resiny bitter hop blast. Light asprin characteristics in the end. Typical DIPA. Moderate to full feel, semi-tingly carbonation leads to a smoothish feel. The sweetness is high but is offset by the bitter hops, none seem to dominate. Alcohol is well hidden on this one. A real nice DIPA, good offsetting flavors with hidden ABV make this very drinkable.","Gmann","Jul 02, 2009"
4.08,-3.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Another winner from Dogfish. This is a lot like a cross between the 90 and the 120 minute IPAs. The hop presence seems a little stronger than in the 90 but the alcohol is toned way down from the 120. The oak aging comes through a bit with a slight vanilla flavor, but overall it's not too noticeable. Nevertheless, this is a good beer that works quite nicely as a nightcap.

3.76,-11.3,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours out a beautiful clear copper, with kind of a small head, but very dense, which leaves a bit of lacing. Very pretty looking. There's a bit of earthy hops, with some spicy and fruity notes - primarily tropical fruits, but a strong syrupy presence is most notable. A bit estery with a lot of toasty malts, and a bit of wood as well. I can imagine it smelling much worse, but it doesn't smell like a DIPA (then again, I guess it really isn't a DIPA - only half of one), there's nothing harsh, but I'd love to smell more hops. In the taste, the old ale sort of dominates, like a hoppy old ale. Low bitterness, a bit of oak cask flavors. Some kind of roasty, not quite bready, but crackery malt tastes come through well. I can really taste the yeast in this in some respects - something reminds me of raw yeast, like the little vials. But when you get to the hoppiness, this one really shines. It's not piney, or bitter, or resinous at all - there's a wonderful tropical fruitiness to this, like mangoes, maybe a bit of tart cherry, and a nice kick of lemon-lime in the end. The alcohol is actually barely even noticeable. The feeling is still a bit syrupy, maybe its the kind of low level of carbonation. I can also notice the esters quite well because of that. The yeasty flavor kind of throws it off for me, but still I like this much better than the 90min. This one tasted pretty much how I exptected to. Though I hadn't noticed the alcohol as I was drinking it, I can imagine that I'll feel it soon. I think the smaller pour was just about right for this.","taylorhamrick","Jun 27, 2009"

Oak takes the lead in the smells coming from the beer with the malt right behind it and citrus hops in the back ground. The taste is something revolutionary for me as the Oak, Malt, and hops are perfectly balanced. Nothing in the taste out did each other, the Oak and malt I felt were balanced on the same level with the hops just behind it a bit. Carbonation levels were great and helped the aroma and flavors out extremly! This beer's 10% is hardly noticed and for a beer at this calibur it is always welcomed.

The color is very similar to 90 minute, an amberish, deep copper hue with off-white head.. It's actually got a really beautiful deep red/amber. Simply perfect. the smell is very hoppy but also has a sweetness that is present right behind the hop and is almost the same strength, really showcasing what you'll find in the flavor. The oak presence provides a really nice base. The hop and sweeness in the flavor are balanced perfectly, with a creamy mouthfeel, its like cream soda mixed with hops (which sounds gross, but the beer is amazing)..

In the nose the juicy pink grapefruit to tangerine citrus gets run down by the caramel, vanilla oak elements, this creaminess also seems to buttress buttery malts and a mix of apricot, cherry, pineapple and date fruit scents, as it warms more pine and molasses comes out. Full-bodied, fluffy carbonation makes it expand rapidly in the mouth, almost overfilled. Very sticky texture in the mouth too, halfway through the glass your mouth pores feel clogged. That said, the momentum in the sweet grapefruit, lime, tangerine citrus as well as the pine sap keeps up the pace. More hoppy here with flowers and wet straw, the oak caramel, molasses tend to blend into the alcoholic whomp. Balanced like a bull in the ring, charges, snorts, charges again.

Taste is a lot like the 90 minute but with the oak kick in there (what else would you expect?). Has a bit of a strong alcohol taste (well, it is 10% ABV) but it's wicked smooth and absolutely delicious. Very well balanced and drinkable.

Mellow, but still bold and sticky-sweet. This aged very, very well and is a very different experience than the first bottle. I gave away my fourth bottle, so this is my last review for this batch.

Initial taste is strong and alcoholic (it's 10% ABV), with a complex, bourboney (from the oak barrels it's aged in) and kinda sweet taste that rolls on the tongue and leaves an almost sour aftertaste.

Brewed on date appears to be in February 2008, consumed at the end of May 2008 after being jealous that I didn't attend the DFH dinner at beerbistro in Toronto two nights before. Pours a cloudy, medium gold with a bit of head and just a bit of gentle carbonation. Aroma isn't too strong, and reminds me of some sherry-like barleywines - not my favourite thing, so I'm concerned. Ends up there's nothing to be concerned about. First sip is nice - very full and rich. The flavour is complex, like a Belgian. Hops are not dominant, but provide a nice bitterness as the beer goes down the throat a bit hot. Oak is noticeable. Full bodied. A nice sipper.","sstackho","Aug 09, 2008"

According to the Dogfish Head website this is a combo of their 90 Minute IPA and English strong ale stored away in the wood casks until it's ready for bottling. The wood aging gives this a smokey and slight caramel sweetness all of it's own, subduing the smack of hops that the 90 brings with it and mellowing the bitter bluster that a good portion of strong ales bring with them. As the sips go on and the beers warms a little the a citrus tang from the hops becomes more noticable but never over take the proceedings. The flavors of the oak and the 90 Minute IPA compliment each other nicely and the full & creamy consistency of the beer itself make for a pleasent feeling in the mouth and down the throat. The aftertaste has something like a cinnamon and citrus thing going on but it's not overbearing nor does it carry too much stickiness with it. If you're looking for a straight up D-IPA this is probably not what you're looking for but if you're interested in seeing what kind of things can be done with one, giving it a flavor exclusive to itself, this is one to pick up.","Dalem","May 18, 2008"

The smell was of piny hops,Oak and malt. The taste was a nice hop bite, and full of malt, balanced with Oak. It went great with the full head that dissipated about half way through. The mouth-fell was very smooth and velvety not much alcohol taste with the 10% abv. This beer put a warm feel through my body that went to my feet. I bought 2 of these and they are ready to drink now but I think ill age one just for the hell of it. The only thing I would change about this one is make it a tad more Oak'y tasting.

4.03,-5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a slightly hazy, dark amber color with plentiful off-white head. Aromas, if memory proves true, are nearly indistinguishable for a 90 min. The strong citrusy and piney hops dominate, but an earthy, candy like sweetness is present, a sign of oak? Alcohol notes are present too; overall its bouquet is comparable to a citrusy fruitcake. On the palate, the 90 min likeability is burdened by an aged, old hop feel. Oakiness isn't like any other oaked beer I've had. It's subdued, provides a firm tannic feel, slightly astringent, but sweet in the finish as well. The malt profile provides plenty of honey like floral flavors with lots of sweetness to balance the hop presence. I would liken this to a dry-hopped old ale rather than a DIPA. The finish brings some puckery dryness and vanilla notes reminiscent of the oak. Overall, another crazy beer from DFH, enjoyable, but I'm content with just one bottle.","dreadnatty08","Mar 25, 2008"

You've gotta hand it to DFH, they do an amazing job getting the beer to taste and smell like you just stuck your nose into a handful of hops. The flavor starts off with dark caramel malt, followed quickly by by hop bitterness and flavor. The hops are nice and citrusy, plenty of grapefruity flavor. I'm pretty sure I taste Chinook and some other American "C" hops. There is a hint of oak in the finish but it's light and not overpowering.

3.22,-24.1,3.5,4,3,3.5,2.5,"12 oz., bottled on __/16/07 (the first number of the ink-jet printing was rubbed out), brewed with Northwest hops. By the end of the bottle I found myself reviewing this beer based on overall impression rather than to style - had I reviewed to style it certainly would have garnered lower points. Anyway, the beer pours into the balloon glass a clear, dark copper, with low carbonation and an inch of khaki head that leaves a few rings of lace. Smells of malted grain first, followed by grapefruity hops, which are in turn followed by vanilla and sweet, oaky bourbon notes. Starts quite nice, but becomes sweet and lightly boozy, and my aroma score is an average of those sentiments. On the palate, it is malty sweet - quite cloying actually. It's very fruity, backed by vanilla and oak, with additions of dark fruits and some buttery diacetyl. The hops are beaten down by the massive malts, and relegated to mere supporting roles, giving hints of citrus and pine, while imparting only a mild bitterness. The body is full and too heavy, with low carbonation, drying tannins, and a long, sweet/dry finish. It has a good aroma and some decent flavors, but is way off-balance. The beer is way too sweet, which lowers the drinkability immensely, and the hops are definitely there, but have a hard time making themselves known, which is odd for a double (albeit offbeat) IPA. I was very excited to finally find this, but was ultimately let down. I'll let the other bottle mellow for a couple years and see if it improves.","mmmbeer","Feb 27, 2008"

At 10% they pack a much meaner punch then the close 90 minute IPA. You can tell a difference in the effect but the effect is great. Again and again Dogfish Head does it again.

Oak and vanilla are prominent in the aroma, with a little bit of piney hops and soap in there for good measure. Smells sweet, and the taste follows up big time. I actually was not a huge fan of this -- I realize the oak aging dulls the hops and increases sweetness, but for me it was surprisingly cloying. Maybe it was just the surprise factor, but I didn't find it as amazingly drinkable as some people have. Flavour is heavy on the vanilla, caramel, cotton candy, and molasses. A little bit of field fruit and grassy hops in there as well. Mild bitterness shows up in the aftertaste. Well above average, but not knock-me-out wow.","crwills","May 09, 2007"

Nice hoppy nose, faint odors of oak and tobacco, also possibly pears. Taste is very smooth. You can definitely taste the oak, it helps to mellow the characteristic extreme hop bitterness DIPA's usually have. It tastes more like a very hoppy barley wine than a DIPA. Very full bodied and well balanced.

There are also flavors of candy sugar, a chewiness from the malt, maple, and charred oak. A little on the sweet side, but the oak tannins and hops both balance the flavors.

The reserved bittering hops are also welcome to me so that it doesn't end up harsh and chalky on the back of the throat. This beer is pretty velvety and easy to drink now. If one were to age it, I would do so in the cooler than at room temp as you don't want any oxidation taking this beer over. The fruitiness is plenty already from the hops, so you just want the age to meld the flavors rather than adding its own complexity.

Its like smelling a liquified custard of vanilla and orange zest. In the flavor, the 90 Minute certainly comes out more, in terms of the hops. The other beer this is mixed with brings on a lot of honey sweetness with dulled oak tones which are then mingled with the citrus hops. Finish is sweet with a closing bitterness from the hops and a bit of an off-putting medicinal-like alcohol quality. Too sweet. Mouthfeel is warming, slick, and heavy, with mild carbonation.

Reminds me of Raison d'etre at first. Hops are there but not as dominant or even as playful as a standard IPA. This isn't a 90-min recipe redone. Seems like they're going for more class here. It works too. The betas are present here - there's a bit of medicine and a sharp dryness. Whisky. Maple. Charcoal. Also some bubblegum, but that vanishes fast.

Not bad, could age well I suppose.","Bierguy5","Mar 01, 2007"

Was a rich copper color with a finger of head that slowly dissipated to a constant foam with some lacing. The aroma was hoppy but not as much as you'd expect in an ADIPA. It was really dominated by a sweetness that was quite surprising in it's intensity. I expected some sense oak aged but wow. The taste was unusual to say the least. Again not what I'd expect for an ADIPA. The sweetness was overpowering at first and then just too much to deal with as I made my way thru it. Gotta say I don't like this one very much. Out of balance and out of style. Not a drain pour but damn close. Now I gotta figure out what to do with the other 3 I have. (2.5, NA, ML, N)","TexIndy","Feb 28, 2007"

4.25,0.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Purchased at whole foods thanks to Kim, chilled and poured into a tulip glass. Creamy coconut flesh colored head appeared about two centimeters thick with nice clump lacing. The body is a dark, ruby (strawberry), amber color with purple shades (like iced tea) and visible bubbles maintaining the head. The smell is an aromatic blend of caramel malts, toffee, and a tinge of vanilla from the oak. Hops, Im going to venture a guess, but maybe tettnanger, cascade and something else for bittering. Needless to say there is a nice hop bouquet, not as forward as I thought it would be though, yet it expresses that sort of light tropical character. Notes of alcohol are present as it warms; yet they are not in any way a deterrent. Flavor wise I get toffee, notes of honey, deeply fermented malt and I can almost taste maple syrup and even hints of mint. At moments I also detect something not unlike an orange liqueur. As it warms it can almost seem abrasive, but it is still quite palatable just the same. Personally there is something fall like to this brew. I very much enjoyed this, however it is definitely not something to loose your head over,add one another slightly risqué, yet tasty brew from Dogfish Head.","mmcave","Feb 27, 2007"

Hops were there, but in back of the sweet flavors. Mouthfeel was medium to heavy, and not exactly highly drinkable. The sweet tastes seem to overwhelm everything.

I believe it's a 50/50 blend, with their 90 Minute DIPA making up just one half of the equation. In taste, it's lacking the hop assault most of us expect from a DIPA.

Still, it was a pretty good beer, but like some of the dogfish beers i've tried, the flavor profile reminds me of a wine's flavor in that it's rich with very subtle flavors.

Instead, the vanilla notes are very powerful and backed by a grainy malt note that I usually associate with brown ales or possibly alt biers. On the palate, the first sensation is a huge oaky sweetness; it's a big, juicy, fruity (strawberry?) and vanilla sweetness. At first the sweet notes are nice, but they start to get cloying at the mid-palate and in the finish. The trouble is that the palate isn't composed of a whole lot other than that sweetness; it's unbalanced by bitterness. Mouthfeel is thick and a bit heavy, with medium carbonation.

Being a DIPA, I expected a lot more hop in the aroma. Taste was quite sweet and malty with some notes of maple syrup, grape, vanilla and oak. Hop flavor was there, but didn't really stand out until the beer got closer to room temp. Alcohol was very well hidden. Drinkability was good for a high alcohol brew. I was expecting a hop bomb and never got it. This beer reminds me alot of DFH's Olde School barleywine. It's very sweet and the hops never go over board.

Some thinnish lacing left along the glass as the beer recedes. The smell is sweet, with notes of oak and hops and citrus and pepper. The taste really packs a punch. Crazy malted citrus flavor up front. Think of a juiced-up half-grapefruit, half-raisin on steroids; it strikes under the tongue extremely sharp. But unlike most double IPAs that I've had, the hops never really develop in the finish. I kept waiting for them to attack the back of the tongue and throat, but they never did. The malty sweetness of the beer is almost too overwhelming here, almost syrupy at times; it needs a higher dose of hops (and I've NEVER said that about any DFH brews before) to counter the malt and the oak here. They just seem to take the reigns early, and never really give back control to the hops. Too bad, too, because the Burton Baton has a lot of potential. Still, it's not a bad brew.

The taste is quite interesting: The two IPA's being blended both show themselves separately. Up front there is a smooth but resiny taste then it transitions into a full bodied, bold, and almost malty sweet double IPA. The oak takes any kind of edge off of this strong brew.

(If the nose was indeed the taste, this would be even more amazing.) For a 10% ABV it's very drinkable. One of my favorite aspects of the flavor is the hint of buttermel, that's right buttermel - that's wosion (woo-shun) (word fusion) of Butterscotch and Caramel... especially present in the aftertaste.

This is not what I was expected since it is more reminiscent of a barley wine then an IIPA but it was very enjoyable nonetheless.","Phyl21ca","Jan 09, 2007"

The taste has some caramel sweetness to it, as well a slight citric hop taste, but no real bite like you would expect from an Imperial IPA. I am really enamored by this beer.

The nose is piney with a hint of citrus and some biscuit notes hiding in the background. This thing is smooth and creamy, very nice. The bitterness and the sweetness are nicely balanced. The bitterness is piney and the sweetness reminds me of vanilla. When I had this back in January the oak was very prominent, now it is just mixed in with the vanilla, and that is good, I thought it was a little too much then.

I'm not sure if I'm happy with the masked hops. The hop head in me wants them to come out, but the oakyness that seems to be pulling them down is thoroughly appreciated. Mouthfeel is full-bodied, light carbonation. Easy to drink with the alcohol hardly being noticed. Not your typical DFH experience -- a lot of malt and hop balance. Full of complexity.

The head dissipated over a few minutes, but left behind a long-lasting collar. Wow! The results of my first sniff were a bit unexpected - and in a good way. There's a really rich malt character with lots of caramel. Notes of vanilla, wood, and alcohol blend well with a muted hop presence. The first sip didn't disappoint either. Initially heavy, nearly syrupy, the sweetness slowly gave way to vanilla, oak, and alcohol - a definite whiskey vibe. Subsequent sips flashed back and forth between strong yet tempered bitterness, rich malty caramel and toffee, faint citrusy hops, and high end whiskey. Each time I went back it was almost like having a different beer. Superb. Full bodied all around, bordering on heavy, with carbonation on the light side. Alcohol warmth was apparent almost throughout, made more pronounced yet retaining some softness due to the oak aging. Unfortunately, this numbed my taste buds a bit after about half a bottle. To me, this was more like a fine old ale rather than a DIPA. Regardless of semantics, this is a sophisticated gem of a beer - truly a work of art.","DrJay","Oct 29, 2006"

Citrusy hop aromas blend with a sour, almost funky malt and mineral scent. Huge bitterness, like Chinooks or something on a thick bed of malts spiked through with ferrous metal flavors. Citrus pith lingers in the aftertaste, while alcohol warms from the belly upwards. 10% abv is pretty huge, and the interesting flavor profile valiantly struggles to stay in front of it. I think this is about a year old, but the alcohol has not quite finished melding yet. Medium-thick mouthfeel with prickly alcohol slickness.

The oak qualities come through with some vanilla brilliance. The hop factor seems to be somewhat subdued while the malt character and woody textures flourish. The taste is sweet and sugary. It remains very clean though and avoids the overdone crusty dirtiness that ruins other less fortunate beers. The oak qualities lay some accents on the flavour and truly add benefit. Slight alcoholic heat. Quite nice. I am not quite sure this reminds me of an Imperial IPA in any way however. Looking past labels I am still inclined to say this is a treat.

A slightly less than balanced bittering makes this hard to qualify as a DIPA IMO. Oak aging is barely evident. Moderate to full body is enjoyable with the right amount of carbonation. Good beer, but not as good as I was hoping for, I think it needs more hops and oak.

Oak and alcohol flavors are prominent, and it goes down beautifully for a 10% abv. beer.

The wood contribution is very lovely, mellowing out the bitterness, yet retaining the hop flavor, and also adding notes of vanilla and wine. Very dynamic, complex and interchanging flavors. The malt provides an adequate backing, but are easily conquered and beaten by the pleasing hop flavor.

Very candyish smell, with quite a bit of tropical fruit, like pineapple and papaya. Initially sickly sweet slick phenolic flavor, reminiscent of cotton candy, juicy fruit gum, and cream soda. I also get a slightly chalky finish, like milk of magnesia or peptol bismol. The hops just don't come through to balance much here, although they begin to assert themselves a little after a while. Mouthfeel is light and fluffy for such a seemingly viscous beer. Drinkability can be summed up as "Ooof, my stomach hurts." Unique but not great.","bultrey","Feb 23, 2006"

Creamy vanilla, wood, apricot and peaches, a short but sharp floral hop bitterness and a noticeable alcohol bite at the end, though still quite drinkable for 10%. Mouthfeel is smooth, medium-bodied and lightly carbonated. I really enjoyed this one. For those days when you want 90 Minute, but just don't have the energy, this is your best bet.

I really don't taste the oak (as I have in other beers that have oak aging), but I think I detect some grapefruit in the taste as well as the smell.

There are multitudes of carbonation streamers rising to the surface as the head slowly, slowly settles into uneven mounds that left minimal lacing. The smell is both malty sweet and hop fruity, with notes of oak and bark. Oranges and floral notes stand out as well. The taste is lush and sweet initially. The hops presence becomes known only in the finish. Oak and wood notes are present as well. Big, full bodied and with a creamy slick mouthfeel. The 10% alcohol shows up only after swallowing and as a gentle warming. This is definitely more malty than hoppy, as I expected a distinctly pronounced hop bite, but it still goes down quite easily.

I must admit, I get a bit nervous about oak-flavored beers. Very often the oakiness overpowers just about everything else in both the aroma and the flavor. So it was with a bit of trepidation that I took my first sip. Mercifully, however, the oak character here is fairly restrained  difficult to detect, even. Instead, the aroma is characterized by a mild spiciness, citric fruit, with something of a brown sugar scent. The flavor bears a significantly heavier imprint of oak than the aroma, but is still restrained enough to allow some of the other characteristics of the beer to show through. Malty, sweet, and sugary at the start, the beer finishes with a rather unexpected slight sour tinge. My biggest complaint with the flavor, however, is actually its sugary sweetness. There are some interesting features to this beer, but this feature renders it a bit too cloying for sustained drinking.","mzwolinski","Jan 20, 2006"

The malt has notes of raisins, currants and a bit of caramel. I really like how the spicy oak notes, along with the hint of woody astringency, combine with the spicy and herbal hop notes. The two accentuate each other and form a melodic whole.

Heavy notes of apple and pear, even a hint of maraschino cherry sweetness. Alcohol presents itself early, blended with a soothing oak character. Heavy hopping in the finish, yet integrated. Pine sap and a touch of citrus, with an underlying earthiness. Just enough of a bitter snap in the finish. An oaky hoppiness in the aftertaste. Fairly full bodied, with a sleepy carbonation.

A few dozen slow, long-spaced streamers run through this translucent, sediment-free liquid. Smelled cool, it's a bit unassuming, like sniffing at dry herbs (oregano?) or stale biscuits, with definite whiffs of vanilla and oak in the finish. By the time the beer is at room temperature, though, it has absolutely blossomed, getting thick with bitter hop oils and even a basil-like sweetness. The taste profile evolves similarly, but to cut to the chase, think: grapefruit salsa broiled with a drizzle of maple syrup; mango chutney heavy on the cardamom; toasted caramel sweetness spread between bitter planks of pine. Absolutely superb three-pronged attack of sweet, spicy, and bitter. As the sweetness falls away and leaves behind a high and dry mouthfeel, I feel like I have to lick the bitter varnish off each and every one of my teeth. So smooth that you have to rely on your warming belly to realize that you'd better take it easy before this Baton cracks you across the head.

Although it is 10% ABV, its not hot or solventy, although it is easily tasted, and a little too strong. Definitely needs more time to cellar. This beer is just way too sweet for me, that unrelenting malt just makes it hard to drink. I wish the oak was stronger also.","dauss","Apr 17, 2005"

4.5,6.1,4,4,5,4,4.5,"12 0z bottle. Nice appearance with a hazy orange-ish body and a creamy dollop of white foam atop. The head retention is very good and it leaves some nice splotches of lace at the outset of the glass. Oddly enough, the Dogfish Head yeast is more prevalent in the nose than the hops are... odd, unless they were looking to show off some or the oak-aging. There's some wet-straw, a spoonful of sweet fruit, some nuttiness, a brush of woodiness, a touch of diacetyl, and a drip of honey. It's intriguing. The body is medium-full and dextrinous; and it slides so smoothly, almost oily across the palate with only a caress of very-fine bubbled carbonation on the tongue. The flavor mirrors the aroma with little more to offer than a mild vinous quality and a note of vanilla, but again, it's intriguing and engaging! The wood is clearly a massive part of this beer, and that alone deserves some attention as it's a great example of the type of flavors that the wood imparts, and it can even give you an idea of how these similar characteristics appear in in wine. On that same note, the 10% alcohol is apparent in the same way that it might be found in a fine wine. It's doesn't ever step from the wings but you always know it's there; and it plays a major role in the direct flavor and overall character of the beer. It appears in the finish once the dribble of juiciness runs off the palate, and it helps to dry things; but it's almost immediately backed by the drying, raspy nature of the wood. Tied together just a little more tightly, this could be a brilliant beer.","NeroFiddled","Mar 23, 2005"

3.23,-23.8,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"This beer didn't really blow me away. I was surprised, as Dogfish Head usually pushes the limits of brewing and makes some of my favorite beers. This however was a bit odd. And don't get me wrong, I generally like weird beers. Pours a fairly clear golden amber color with a bit of white head resting on top. Scent is very hoppy at first, all citrussy, but there's this strange scent that it's mixed with... oddly reminds me of catfood or tuna or something. Interesting, different, but not particularly appetizing. Taste was much the same. A bit sweet and not quite bitter enough for a double IPA. The aged flavor doesn't really work here with the mix. Average mouthfeel but something just isn't quite working with this beer. Seems like all the flavors clash rather than work with each other. I kind of got bored of drinking this one after a while. Maybe a little tweaking and this beer could be improved.","twelvsies","Mar 08, 2005"

Right before the hops come in, the palate turns oaky with some tannins. Interesting. Hops are resinous and spicy and provide an ample bitter burn. Alcohol is there, but isn't out of whack, it just adds to the complexity. Medium-full bodied; starts with a frothy, creamy-yet-bubbly mouthfeel, and then gets thicker in the finish.

Aroma is mostly citrus hops with some slight caramel tones. It even exudes a little biscuit aroma and just enough alcohol to tickle your nose. Taste is a sweet, citrus (grapefruit) flavor with a buttery feel up front. The finish is a little bit of biscuits along with some drying alcohol, which gives a little oak barrel flavor. The feel is a little oily and smooth with a bit of dryness on the finish. Lots of bellywarming from this one! A little sweet for my taste, and I expected a little more floral hops than it gave, but I have another and I want to age it for a year to see what happens! Very enjoyable!

Its as if someone took a torch to an orange rind and caramelized the oils. Taste has the same citrus sweetness with a bit of citrus oil bitterness. There is just a slight woody note. Its if the 90 minute and the wood aged parts are fighting for the title. There is also a taste there that i cant find, but it is so deep and good maybe a bit of lemon tartness or is it more floral, or a combination? There is a nice bit of sweetness to counter act the hops. Mouthfeel has a touch of sticky sweet hop notes like a natural citrus candy. Well carbonated and very smooth. This is tip top drinkable. Not quite as great as the straight 90 minute in my mind as something is just a little different and less. Overall however this is a great beer.

The 90 Minute IPA has always been one of my favorites, but this may be a hair better. It becomes lighter on the pallette when it warms and the hops really "blossom."

That said, this wasn't quite what I expected, but I still like it. I liked the earthy, woody aroma of this ale. I liked how the earthiness and vanilla-oakiness emerged among the caremelly malt and herbal hop flavors. I am surprised by the clarity of this brew. I'm not surprised that as I poured this light amber elixir there was little foam, yet a tingle of carbonation that seems to accent what bitterness hides beneath the sweet malt and oaky flavors. Double IPA? I don't think so (not enough hop spiciness) -- more a well attenuated barleywine to me -- that I think really needs to age some more, so I'm tucking the remaining bottles away in a place where I'll forget about them.","marcobrau","Feb 22, 2005"

There is an apparant sweetness throughout this brew but it does not overpower or take anything away from the wonderful caramels and hops.
