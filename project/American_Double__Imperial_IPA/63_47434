Malt aroma is of sweet grains and hops are strongest with notes of spice, citrus and slight resin. Tastes strongly of floral and spicey hops with faint notes of citrus, also faint sweet toast from the malt. Well balanced. Feels slick in the mouth,  lighter bodied with close to lively,  spritzy, carbonation. Finishes long and strong with a good balance between sweet and bitter, however leaning towards bitter.

3.75,-9.2,4,4,3.75,3,3.75,"22oz bottle claims 9.5% ABV and best by 04/07/15.  Served in a tulip glass.  Golden orange color, lightly hazed, with an ample white head.  Yeasty aroma.  Orange peel, citrus.  Really big citrus hop flavor, with an almost grapefruit-like astringency.  This bottle conditioned XPA really is all about the hops.  There's very little malt backbone, and I think I detect a bit of wheat, perhaps used to deliberately subdue malt flavor.  Carbonation is on the high side in this bottle.  As previously reported, all-day IPA enthusiasts will probably love this, but otherwise it's just ok.","hreb","Mar 11, 2015"

Flavor's like aroma, has a slight sweetness, good tartness, and the proper bitterness for this kind of beer. Has a nice mouth filling feeling yet with just the right buzz from good carbonation for excellent body. Also delivers some alcohol warmth.

The aroma really isn't that strong. Most of what I can make out is apple. On tasting, there is a slight malty taste, quickly followed by a hoppy explosion. I can taste a hint of apple at the end. Kind of a bitter, soapy aftertaste. The taste is good, but there is something a little off, and it may be the soapiness at the end. I will say that I drank this a little over a month after the date on the bottle, so my review may have been different if I drank it earlier.","jngrizzaffi","Jul 19, 2014"

4.1,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 7/15/2014. Pours light hazy/cloudy bright orange color with a 2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big tangerine, orange peel, lemon zest, pineapple, mango, peach, papaya, apricot, light caramel, bread, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with great complexity and balance of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of tangerine, orange peel, lemon zest, pineapple, peach, apricot, mango, papaya, light caramel, bread, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, orange peel, lemon zest, pineapple, peach, apricot, mango, light caramel, bread, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent DIPA. All around great complexity and balance of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 13, 2014"

Though not as well balanced as it should be, it’s a far cry from your kick-in-the-teeth bitter IPAs out there. Try it if you love hops and are looking for something new, but don’t bother if you are still getting used to/learning to appreciate hops.","Louisville-Beer-Reviews","Jun 21, 2014"

Smooth, a rather flavorful hoppy beer as the hops are not one note. I get not only a strong citric vibe but also some tropical and grapefruit which, along with touches of caramel, give off a little sweetness. Beer is well balanced and also has a bread/cracker like edge just to make sure it isn't too hoppy and aids a rather dry finish.","clayrock81","May 09, 2014"

4.5,9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall: With Deschutes on my "breweries to try" list, I randomly ran across this bomber next to the regulars in my local gorcery store. I picked it up without hesitation and glad I did. I don't get the prominent malt bill that others mention. It was almost all hops with a sweet malt undertone which I prefer in an IPA/IIPA. This must be due to this bottle still having a few months before the expiration date. It reminds me a lot of Two Hearted actually. At first, the taste didn't quite match the smell with it's subtleties, but as it warmed, it became bolder. Also one of the smoothest IIPA's I've had in recent memory. Lastly, at $6.99 a bomber, it's reasonably priced. Really an excellent beer across the board and looking forward to trying their other stuff.","Bone53","Apr 28, 2014"

Alcohol, which for its strength was virtually undetectable in the aroma and flavor, takes nothing away from the feel and makes for dangerous drinkability. One honestly could drink more than a bomber thinking nothing of it before getting hit with it. It's frothy and unbelievably creamy on the palate. A little dryness kicks in to give the balance many don't consider when thinking about mouthfeel, and a bright sort of crispness stays with it while letting the creaminess rule.","Brenden","Apr 05, 2014"

I appreciate the huge burst of floral, fragrant, and piney hops that come through, then disappear quickly. This is followed by a pleasant, medium hoppy bitterness that carries through the palate. I believe this along with the higher maltiness of the beer makes this beer very drinkable. I pick up some minimal dankiness along with some nice resinous notes. There are some regularly occurring citrus/grapefruit notes. There are faint hints of pineapple/tropical I perceive in this brew as well. I love the low carbonation and creamier mouthfeel of each sip. However, I am not too big on the residual sweetness left over from fermentation. The caramel and minimal grainy flavors near the end of the palate are welcomed. If you like your DIPA's on the sweeter side, this is a brew you should have, if available.","mac31","Mar 31, 2014"

The appearance is a handsome golden amber color with a thick white head that gives way to a very substantial film and lacing. The nose is surprisingly subtle for this style of ale. There are alot of piney and floral hops with a substantial malt background. You can definitely tell the beer is super fresh but not of the traditional west coast California variety. The flavor follows suit beautifully. Not too bitter, not too malty; just super balanced. This reminds me more of some of the awesome ipas produced by dogfish head than the typical west coast ipas. If this is any sign of the quality of the other offerings from this brewery, I cant wait.","lochef81","Feb 17, 2014"

The smell is very malt forward with a pungent alcohol presence, however there are some nice bready aromas and slight citrus characters mixed in at the back of the nose. The taste is interesting, not what I expected at all, bitter and fruity up front (fruity not necessarily citrus) with a nice sweet malt flavor and finish with a bitter/acidic aftertaste. For me what is missing is the hops smell and/or taste from what I would expect from this style, not necessarily a bad beer just not what I expect from the style. So overall this is a decent beer and is something worth trying, just did not seem to agree with my pallet as it was a bit bitter, lacked a real hop component, and left me with a bit of a acidic aftertaste (maybe due to the high ABV)","mjmadden","Jan 29, 2014"

It certainly is a medium sized brewery, with a craft beer heritage. I have always liked their Inversion IPA and most of their selections. Brewforia, one of the many great beer pubs in Boise, has the Henge on tap. I happened into Whole Foods to try a bottle of this "Experimental IPA" before I fill a growler with this brew. Poured tall into a 12 oz glass, stunning head , creamy white and tall as the mountains in the near distance. Lacing lingers and stalls and falls slowly down the glass sides. Taste is smooth, very smoth, caresses the palette, citrus hints of grapefruit, not as much as other reviewers describe, orange, hints of lemons, finishes clean...At 9.3 ACL no whispers of the high alcohol, but after a 22 ouncer got a sweet buzz going on. Not as complex as some IPA's but still a great IPA! Keep the experiment going. Cheers.","Goliveidaho","Jan 19, 2014"

Appearance is your classic IPA copper with surprisingly high transparency. A pleasant citrus hop IPA aroma wafts to the nose and upon first sip an overpowering bitterness hits the palate. Bitterness through and through that starts and finishes hard. Mouthfeel is soft and light. To me it seems the beer has the bitterness of a double IPA without much of the additional complexities or depth of flavor. On the other hand, the 9.3% alcohol is masked incredibly well. This is a strong and bitter IPA without much flavor and a thin mouth feel. Not bad, not great, this is another Deschutes beer that you can tell is high quality but makes you think the brewers played it safe. Someone will have to explain to me why this is an experimental IPA.","BenHesk12","Dec 27, 2013"

The taste began with a grapefruit hop profile with sweet vanilla malt tones and a slightly piney finish that lingered on the palate. There malty spine kept the Hop Henge from becoming completely overwhelming and gave it the perfect balance to make this a fantastic IIPA. There was a medium to full body on that made the brew satisfying and well rounded.","brurevu","Oct 09, 2013"

Tart, chewy yellow and orange fruits play with your taste buds as bitter evergreen American hop cones ruin them almost unnoticeably. For an American lover of Belgian beer and hops, this is heaven. This review is from memory and I've certainly neglected some flavor components, but sell you soul for a bottle of this experimental IPA batch if need be; it's worth it to experience for yourself.","sam_bliss","Apr 14, 2013"

Full-bodied and very sweet. A nice flavor. The sweetness is accompanied by a good dose of hops. Pretty nice balance, but I think a little too heavy on the sugary caramel flavor. Hits every part of the palate. Strong carbonation, full-bodied, and pretty thick. Very good imperial ipa. I love the hops (which don't overpower at the front or end), but would tone down the sweetness.","lunarbrew","Mar 27, 2013"

4.48,8.5,5,5,4,4.75,4.5,"Hop Henge. The "Experimental" IPA. I don't know what is so experimental about it...It doesn't really *taste*out of the ordinary. A medium hoppy DIPA, light on bittering hops. It's got a nice mellow hop profile, nothing like the usual super floralness of something like Pliny the Elder, or the super bitterness of anything made by Green Flash. High ABV at 10.6%...I should have written this review after a few sips instead of 20 oz. deep into the bomber. Nice color and lacing on this with a lingering head. Some citrus smelling hops and some yeast in the smell. Well rounded with the mouthfeel, doesn't go to one extreme or the other. Well balanced dry/sweet character. Really tasty if not basic/classic example of the style. If one were to come across a DIPA kit in a brewing shop, this is the beer that kit would produce. Not to say it isn't great. I like it. My favorite Deschutes brew thus far.","Jemonster","Mar 14, 2013"

Good amount of carbonation coming off the glass. Smells of wonderful, juicy tropical fruits like mango, papaya, guava, pineapple, orange, some pine, floral, grass, small amount of grain. Resinous, yet sweet smelling. Taste starts with lots of hop qualities as expected: resinous pine, orange, mango, papaya. Sweet even in the beginning. May of added some dextrose sugar. The the middle brings a modest malt backbone. More than I detected in the taste. A light biscuity note, as well as some sweet carmel and grain. The finish does an excellent job of showing off the hop qualities, yet still staying pretty balanced. Lots of tropical fruits like mango, pineapple, papaya, as well as resinous grass, pine, floral notes. Tastes a lot like different flavored gummi worms. Little hint of alcohol. Full body with a creamy and sticky mouthfeel. The sweetness throughout really helps to cut the bitterness and balance the beer. A really solid double ipa.","brewskis","Feb 23, 2013"

I am tasting a nice blend of hops with some faint fruit notes, perhaps apricot. The mouthfeel is a little too thin, needs more bubbles.

Anyway, this stuff pours a clear amber-brass topped by a finger of cream-white foam. The nose comprises pine needle, pine resin, grapefruit rind, mild toffee, and fresh grass. The taste brings in more of the same, with everything buttressed by a foundation of sweet caramel that blends very nicely with the various citrus fruits. (Wait, can a foundation buttress? Oh, well...) The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sticky-ish finish. Overall, a very nice DIPA, indeed, one that includes a lot of hop flavor without overwhelming the tongue with it and without losing a sense of balance. Good times.","TMoney2591","Feb 05, 2013"

Moderate retention, good lacing, and low carbonation- not too bad looking. Smells of hops with a strong citrus undertone. Grapefruit, passion fruit, apricot, and some lemon. Sweet malt and a hint of alcohol make a rigid backbone bringing it all together; fruits are really what sticks out here. Taste follows the nose well, strong fruity hop first and foremost. A ton of citrus accompanied with a mild malt mask the alcohol well. Very juicy with a wet finish- nothing special besides that going on here in the mouth. Overall this beer isn't very bad, the balance is way too tilted towards the fruit for me though. I have another bottle I was going to drink tomorrow, I'm not sure I'll pick up any others though.

4.38,6.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours deep golden with abundant amber and orangish hues. Two finger fluffy bright white head, above average retention wispy lacing here and there. Big citrus blossom notes, pineapple, sweet malt with a touch of caramel and solvent alcohol on the nose. Mandarin orange, pineapple, continued flora, bready, but lightly sweet malt midpalate. Finishes smooth with some citrus rind bitterness, a touch of spruce, and warming alcohol. Very impressive mouthfeel, creamy, smooth, carbonation is abundant but not intrusive; full bodied. An extremely balanced DIPA that is right in my wheelhouse. Hop Henge is bitter enough to satisfy even the most die-hard hophead, yet is not too overpowering that it would turn off those that prefer less intense DIPA's. Exceptional brew!

Smells of candied orange peel, hibiscus, pineapple, and overripe papaya with just a hint of mango. The tropical fruits carry the majority of the flavor, with plenty of caramel / toffee malt to compensate and orange peel coming in third place on the tongue, kicking in about mid-sip alongside a mild sort of peach and nectarine sweetness. Like drinking a fruit basket, but amazingly smooth and creamy in texture, and with a snappy carbonation to boot. Really well done and definitely worth trying.","WastingFreetime","Jul 08, 2012"

This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a solid IPA with some nice hop aromas and flavors.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 04, 2012"

The mouthfeel is on the fuller side with an appropriate level of carbonation. It coats the mouth very well. The drinkability is very good. A great first brew from Deschutes.

I also get a subtle taste of malt. Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin, but that seems to increase drinkability. Alcohol is pretty high, but you wouldn't know it by the taste.

I keep falling back to an apple, and pear flavor. Very drinkable. For almost 9% it's amazingly drinkable. This is by far the best brew I've had from deschutes.

There's a lot of delicate fruitiness that is intriguing in the first few sips, but after a half-glass you wish the volume was turned up a bit. Other than that, I think this one is pretty yummy. Despite my slight gripe with the flavor, I don't think anyone can deny how refreshing this beer is. I smack my lips together after every sip.

Flavor is pretty good, though I suspect it has mellowed a bit during its trip from Deschutes to Minnesota. It kind of reminds me of my homebrewed Furious clone, which is good for me, but potentially not so good for Deschutes. A bit on the sweet side, not as bracing as I might expect.

Lots of pineapple with hints of caramel and an odd soapiness. Piney, bitter hops attempt to balance out the sweet malt, but come up short. Very thick and chewy mouthfeel that I typically love, but the sweetness coupled with the soapy aftertaste really kill the drinkability for me. This isn't a bad beer, but there's something about it that just rubs me the wrong way. It's got a lot of good qualities, but enough little issues that I really can't give it more than an average review.

Sharp flavor here as the resin like hops took all the moisture out of my mouth and left me parched, dry and looking for more.

Don't like the soap, love the rest. Never really smelled an IIPA like this before. A low-key hop flavor with just a touch of citrus balances well with a low-key malt flavor. Finishes a lot dryer than expected. Pretty mild in flavor, with just a touch of that soapiness. There is something else in there I am having trouble identifying. Gum is the best I can come up with. I can't seem to describe the flavor legitimately in a positive way, yet I don't think it is bad. Definitely interesting and a bit different than most IIPAs. The mouthfeel is right on, good carbonation and a reasonable amount of residual sweetness. I'm giving it an overall bump because I like it more than the taste rating impies. Certainly not amazing, but not poor by any means, and kind of interesting.","seeswo","May 06, 2011"

A great lacing is left around the rim and sides of the glass. This beer is the standard on how a DIPA should look. The beer smells of citrus, tropical fruit, and bitter hops. You can definitely smell the 95 IBUs. I taste bitter hops, grapefruit, and a hint of caramel on the back end. Well balanced carbonation and great texture on the pallet. Overall this beer is a great example of the DIPA style. I think Deschutes hit a home run with this "experimental" beer and this should become one of their regular offerings.","brian44556","Apr 17, 2011"

Crystal clear light amber to redwood color, hue drops off enough at the rims to evoke more of a metallic rust orange, only a few bubbles floating around. While the nose does present a pinch of white pepper as well as moss, tar and something like volcanic ash, truly it's about being as sweet as possible, caramel, butterscotch, milk chocolate team up with orange and grapefruit pulp to fill up your nostrils, the apricot, peach, pear fruit verges on syrupy with a touch of honey, given all this curious lack of staying power. Full-bodied with a sticky, clingy mouth feel, as if it wants to glue itself to your mouth pores. The carbonation is weak, if remaining at a consistent low drone. More bread, pie crust accents here, some custard as well in addition to the base of butterscotch, caramel, coconut and molasses. The tangerine, pink grapefruit citrus wet, juicy and equally sticky itself. Touch of golden raisin and fig to the pear, peach, yellow apple, mango fruit, lacks the tang to get more tropical. The pine element is mostly resin and sap. Its density starts to fatigue the palate once you're halfway through the bomber.

3.58,-13.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"A clear copper color with a fair off-white head and very good lacing. The aroma offers mild citrus grass biscuit. Nice but slightly mysterious. The flavor says honey grass and a touch of pine peanut. Grass dominates with a scintillating carbonation in a medium bodied brew. There is a slight alcohol note with lemon biscuit. The feel is slightly viscous with very subtle carbonation. Fair drinkability. Not in my wheelhouse for an IPA but a decent version worth a try.","Durge","Feb 25, 2011"

Poured red-orange/amber with a one and a half finger off-white head that subsided to a half finger slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, and grapefruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, and slight alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The alcohol flavor cuts out the nice flavors on this one unfortunately. Had a great aroma going on here. Good flavor as well (minus the alcohol aspect). If the alcohol aspect was covered up a little more with some sweetness this one would have been awesome. Still pretty good and really glad that I got to try it. I suggest you do the same...","thagr81us","Feb 21, 2011"

I also get a bit of strawberry in the nose as well, which is interesting and inviting. Taste is VERY sweet. Maybe a little too sweet. I get citrus flavors (grapefruit and orange) as well as some melon and strawberry. I could see why this is known as "experimental" as it is different than most DIPAs I've had. There is less bittering hop flavor than expected. In fact the hops and malt seem to balance each other somewhat. Mouthfeel is nice, but a bit on the syrupy side. Drinkability is sort of high as this is a tasty beer, just some things are different. Definitely not one of the best attempts at a DIPA though.","DovaliHops","Feb 20, 2011"

I didn't have a good pour so the head is a little small, but that was my fault. Aroma is as balanced as one can get. Citrus hops, pine, honey, zesty peel and even some sweet sugar tickle the nostrils. Flavor-wise, there is a bite from the hops but a sweetness from the honey. The 9% ABV is masked by all the great character going on here. A slight amount of acidity rests in the stomach and gives this a heavy punch, which it should since it's a DIPA. 9%, can't tell from taste and hasn't hit me yet. Another great job by Deschutes.","spree92","Feb 13, 2011"

Now, after drinking more the genius of the beer shines. The hops appear to take over and dominate throughout. Now don't think i am saying this is all hops and nothing else. What I am saying is the hops are on the front of the taste and remain through the finish. Bitterness appears non existent considering it claims 90 or 95 IBUs.

Aroma of bright citrus and floral hops. Light amount of sweet caramels and hops. Flavor is quite piney up front. Surprised me, but not in a bad way. The big but sweet pine taste lasts throughout and well into the finish, but a good amount of balancing light caramels even this out. Very floral, sharp, and astringent. Palate is medium bodied and oily before an extremely dry finish with a spicy, sticky, strong hop taste that lasts for a very long time. Overall, a very interesting IPA.

Bright, fresh hops with sweet, malty notes on the nose. Full bodied and almost syrupy with a fairly prominent malt profile whose sweetness compliments the hop bitterness by making them seem lighter (fresher,sweeter) on the tongue. This is how I like my double IPAs. Big and bold hops balanced with malty sweetness. The only drawback with this is it can take away from the drinkability. I've had a few that drink more like a barley wine than an IPA but this one walks the line pretty damn well.

Bright citrus with grapefruit pulp and tangerine and lemon and mango. Bitterness is fairly clean. A little rough around the edges, but not much.

Big time hop flavor, citrus and pine dominate, but there is a nice sweetness in the background. Bitterness never becomes too much.

Great Stuff here, alcohol becomes a little too noticeable as it warms up however. Medium full body, but the sweetness starts get cloying and sticky as get to the bottom of this bomber.

A shift of some bittering hops to the flavor and aroma side of the boil would make this one a lot more satisfying.","jbphoto88","Mar 05, 2010"

This is big hops with the perfect balance of malts, making this bomber at 8%+ go down smooth like candy. What seperates this is the balance of the beer, hops, malts, then a nice dry hop finish that lingers. Not to boozy, but also there to punch you in the nuts to let you know what's up.

TASTE citrusy and floral hops, sharp bitterness overpowers strong malty sweetness that balances fairly effectively. Bitterness lingers, and some dryness in the finish. FEEL med carb and fiz, rich, full body, warming and a drying bitter finish. OVERALL an honest attempt is made to balance this classic example of the Great NorthWest Hop Bomb.

The body is full and mildly carbonated. This is some potent stuff. I really feel that their should be separate ratings for each of the versions since the hop characters of each are different and meld differently with the malts and have highly variable ABV's.

Not sure if rye was used in the malt bill. Finishes with a nice lingering herbal tea leafyness. Somewhat bitter finish, but not over the top. Surprising for a beer approaching 90 Ibu's.

This brew is pretty drinkable and does not seem as bitter as the 95 IBUs the label claims. Im not the biggest IIPA fan around, but this beer is one of the tastier versions I have had.

Initially has a little bite of pungent, bitter hops. Recognizable Deschutes malt bill comes through mid-palate, with toasty/spicy flavors and vague hints of fruitiness, almost woody-- similar to the Inversion. Hops are bitter throughout, mostly a white grapefruit pith bitterness that lingers well beyond the clean, dry finish. Sort of an old school hoppiness: rough, bracingly bitter and completely lacking the trendy tropical fruit juiciness that is showing up in so many IPAs lately. Not a quaffer; this is a good one to sip and ponder, as it is tough to nail down and it improves as it warms.

Hop Henge is orange/amber in color and pours out with a two-finger head which readily dissipates, leaving behind just a wisp of foam and spotty, sticky lacing. Smell is of candied citrus hops: the caramel malt backbone adds the sweetness to the tangerine-like, slightly piney hop profile. One whiff reminds me of juicy fruit gum. This a seriously hoppy brew, as the taste betrays. There is a significant malty backbone, however Hop Henge is all about citrusy, spicy hops with a dash of pine. It's damn tasty, and the tangy finish lingers for quite some time. Mouthfeel is near perfect IMO, medium thick with an oily, resiny texture wrapped around lively carbonation.

Does deliver a bitter and chalky close as a result of the relative dryness that lingers on the throat after the swallow.

The flavor is amazing - floral, well balanced, delicate. It has hints of apricot. There is a small bite of alcohol, but nothing offensive. The hop character suggests a full, ripe flower. The mouth feel is clingy, leaving a beautiful, delicate bitterness on the finish. If you want a hop bomb, this is not your beer.

Smells of citrus, and tastes of grapefruit and orange with a mild bitter aspirin aftertaste. There's a lot of citrus tingle on the palette. Not the most intense DIPA I've had; in fact, it's on the mild side for a DIPA. More like a good solid IPA. At any rate, while it's not the most powerful DIPA I've had, it's a solid entry from Deschutes and very drinkable. Too bad they don't make this one all year, as Inversion is not that big of a deal.","PhxHorn","May 02, 2008"

4,-3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Solid 4's for me, a good beer but nothing really stood out as "great." Pours a nice copper color with thick rocky head, good retention and lots of lacing. Smell is a blast of hops, very nice fresh hops. I personally didnt really notice too much of a citrus smell, just good ol bitter hops. Taste is on par with smell. It wasnt as bitter as I expected (or maybe I'm just getting used to IPA's). Dominating hops, a touch of sweetness too it, but a very small touch. Bitter, somewhat oily feeling left on the back of the tounge. Moderately carbonated which seemed perfect, somewhat full bodied.","bunnyhustle","Apr 22, 2008"

The taste is mellow and comforting. For 8.1% ABV this IPA is pretty soft on the palette. Mouthfeel is full and drinkability is (in my opinion) far greater than many imp. IPA's. I love this beer. Another fine limited release from Deschutes.","hammy","Feb 27, 2008"
4.03,-2.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a dark copper hue with a nice two finger fluffy white head that qucikly dies down to a thin layer leaving a very impressive lacing. Let's just say I can smell this one from across the room. Powerful creamy hops of mostly pine mixed well with a very noticable caramel malt that created a very unique DIPA scent. Taste is a very earthy hop flavor of dirt, woody pine, and grass. A tiny bit of alcohol on the tongue towards the end, but doesn't over-power at all. Aftertaste is a bit dry, but a nice mild citrus hop flavor with a creamy malt balance. Mouthfeel is somewhat full and thick with a great combination of just enough carbonation. Pretty solid DIPA, definitely can't complain. Good one to enjoy for sure.","BeerTruth","Aug 20, 2007"
3.75,-9.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"A very good beer, which seemed to show off the hops more as it warmed. My general experience has been that malt is what usually comes forward with increasing temperature, so this was a nice surprise. Not a "top shelf" DIPA for me (like 'em a little less sweet), but one I would certainly drink again.","","Jul 26, 2007"
4,-3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Amber in color with a decent white head that laces my pint glass and leaves that lovely sticky film. Aroma is hoppy but not at all piney or grassy. I have to disagree with the previous reviewer in that this doesn't quite fit the bill of "West Coast IPA". Sure, it is hoppy (with a nice fruity flavor) but there is no citrus or pine flavor that always jumps out of the San Diego IPA's. This is closer to an Inversion style IPA. Either way, this is an excellent value for $3.50 per bottle.","ArrogantB","Jun 29, 2007"

Strong northwest hops and citrus in the nose. Palate hits strong of hops up front, but mild on the back end. Very subtle in the aftertaste. Very pleasing. Very light sugary sweetness rounds out the flavors. Medium-bodied, thanks to big malt presence. Very likeable as it permeates the mouth.

The smell is good - complex floral and citrus hops. The taste was a little disappointing, though the higher alcohol content is very well masked.

From the moment you begin pouring, the "ginormous" amount of hops used in this brew produces an aroma that hopheads live for. Tastes very grassy and hoppy. The hops overwhelms any malt that might be in the beer. It tastes absolutely wonderful. Very very smooth and very drinkable. The hop bitterness hits the entire mouth and slowly evaporates to the back of the throat. The 8% abv is hardly noticeable at all....

The aroma brings a dose of chunky caramel malt with an earthy hop under it. There is a mild citrusy sweetness and an apparent alcohol. The flavor is a little rough to me. It has a little solventy character from the combination of the alcohol and bitterness. The caramel comes through as a nice sweetness along with the citrusy hop. The bitterness clings on the finish. Mouthfeel is moderate to thick with a very fine carbonation. Overall this one is okay. The flavor isn't as melded as I would like but it drinks well.","kmpitz2","Feb 22, 2007"

3,-27.4,4,4,2.5,3,2.5,"Poured in an imperial pint glass, the Hop Henge is bronze colored with a thick tan head, which rescinded to a small, lingering top coat that left a pretty, sticky lace. The aroma is really nice and bright, lot of cascade and piney NW hops, a little brown sugar, but also really stong fusel alcohol. The taste is not nearly so pleasant. Initially there's a nice sweet, bready malt flavor, but it's quickly overrun by exxxtreme bittering hops and omnipresent fusels. Whoa, thats harsh, the aftertaste feels like I just took a shot of rubbing alcohol. And at only 8.1% ABV, pretty amerteurish...maybe their ferm. temps ran away from them or something, what ever it was, I'm far from impressed. The mouthfeel is really pretty nice, creamy and not to thick, with a light carbonation that is easily roused. The drinkablilty was very low for me because I just didn't like it at all. It was so bitter and boozy though that it managed to numb my senses, and by the second half of the bomber I was able to pick up some steam, though I was really just to get it over with.","ccrida","Feb 11, 2007"

Loads of hops, and a touch of alcohol, though its pleasing rather than distracting.Long bitter after taste. Sweet and semi-dry finish, good on the palate.

Nice aroma of sweet, fruity hops and a touch of grapefruit mixed in with a decent amount of sweet caramel malt. The hops really come through on the palate - right up front, huge, citrusy, assertively bitter hops that yield just a bit to some moderately sweet malt by mid-palate. Towards the swallow the hops take over again, with a bracing bitterness that yields a pleasant finish. Body is substantial enough to hold the flavor well, without being too sticky.
