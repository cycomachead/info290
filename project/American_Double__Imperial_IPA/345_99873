Coppery colored liquid, neither shiny nor dull, somewhat translucent as well, very few visible bubbles. The nose has a good amount going on, lots of pine and grapefruit, tangerine citrus, peppery, leafy without seeming green, the fruit is tropical pineapple, nectarine, mango with apricot, more edgy than wet and juicy, for the punch it packs it also possesses a sinewy, punctuated dissolve. Full-bodied, sappy and heavy in mouth feel. here too leans on the pine, citrus and herbal matter for the cornerstone of flavor. Not that floral but has a patina of malt sweetness and brioche style breadiness. Mango, papaya, pineapple, nectarine, apricot fruit bright and succinct at once. A touch boozy but no heat in the throat. The stickiness prevents it from being a thirst slaker but that is clearly not the intent. Big, bold and proud of it.","farrago","Feb 19, 2015"

Putting it up to my nose it has a dankness, citrus, lemon, and a slight sweetness (could be slightly stronger but still very appealing).   Taste follows the nose with more complexity and starts citrusy, lemony, has a pepper note, salty, dry in the back end with a slight bready tone, then a bitterness that lingers.  Carbonation is perfect for this beer and the mouth feel is medium to full, as the beer goes down it has a slickness to it.  Probably the double IPA that victory has made.

4.64,8.2,4.75,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Even with a relatively careful pour, the lively brew overflows the IPA glass with steady, slow rising carbonation. The end result is a staggering whipped cream-like head that mounds over the top of the glass, adorning a golden honey colored ale. It's a little lighter than I expected, and the color and clarity afford a great view of the myriad particulates that are suspended in the liquid. After a good while, there is still ample foam retained, and lovely lacing on the glass.  This one looks like it belongs in a commercial. The aroma is incredible. Dank, earthy and aromatic. Very bright and floral. A bit of pineapple and tropical fruit flair. Absolutely luscious! The first sip is an explosion of complex hop character. Tart earthy spice, minty pine and citrus zest. Artfully balanced with just enough malt sweetness to play along, without becoming cloying. The alcohol is well hidden, so despite a cumulative booziness on the breath, it's undetectable. The mouthfeel is juicy. Exceptionally fresh and lively. This is hands down one of the best double IPA's I've ever had. Nothing is to excess, but it is brimming with complexity and character. I would be happy just smelling this beer. Fortunately, the look, taste and feel are up to the challenge too. This is a marquee example of an American IPA and what passionate brewing can produce.","JohnnyI","Jan 18, 2015"

Pour is very hazy light orange in color with a thick foamy white head that fades to a thin film with little lacing within minutes.  Smell is sweet citrus fruit and candy corn.  Taste is grapefruit, lots of grapefruit and sweet malt flavor that blends very well with a pleasant hop bitterness that lingers a while on the palette.

Clean white head is prominent and quite willing to stay for the party. Some decent lace on the glass. The nose is big and fragrant with lots pineapple and other tropical fruits, citrus. There are peppery notes of spice and alcohol heat. A bit of a lemon honey malt undercurrent. Taste is superbly balanced for such a strong brew. The light pils type body and mild honey sweetness are quickly engulfed in the blanket of hop melange. The tropical qualities really stand out at first and the body develops and unfolds into a piney progression that blossoms in a grapefruit skinned finish, with a light minty flourish that opens up the well concealed alcohol as a vaporous fusel cooling of the tongue. Feel way to light and supple for a DIPA. Smooth, lightly creamy carbonation. Quenching and refreshing feel puts you in trouble when it comes to staying sober. It just goes down like as a session ale. This is a great all around DIPA and while not Pliney it is a great, easy drinking take on the stye. Love it.","scootny","Dec 14, 2014"

Lovely oily hop aroma with a citric orange or grapefruit like smell. Initial taste is a strong balance of malty, spicy, and citrus fruit which is overpowered by a grassy and strong dry and bitter hop finish. Not such strong carbonation but the feel is a pleasant and creamy. If you like hoppy aroma and taste, this is definitely the beer for you. I have thus far enjoyed all of victory brewing companies products, and this is no exception.","Gajo74","Nov 07, 2014"

4.75,10.7,,,,,,"From bottles expiring 09 March 2015: Intense pine and moderate grapefruit aroma.  Tastes of strong hops with pine, citrus, and flowery notes nicely complemented by somewhat sweet, bready malt; some spiciness that starts fading mid-palate.  Long moderately drying finish with grapefruit pith and flowers, and moderate hop bitterness and lingering sweet-saltiness on tongue; some nasal alcohol fumes.  Reminiscent of Sierra Nevada's Hoptimum—but with more citrus and flower here—and Bell's Hopslam—but sweeter here—if I recall correctly.  I seem to be drawn to brews with grapefruity esters.  An excellent American DIPA, with a subtle Arcimbaldo-esque figure on the label representing its rather silly name.  —Reviewed 27 October 2014","BubbleChamber","Oct 27, 2014"

With no particular wants in mind I picked this up, read the description on the side and knew I had to try it. This ended up as a want twice and for good reason. Smells and tastes primarily of citrus, mostly grabbing grapefruit and apple, surprisingly brings a brisk spice aspect once the pine comes forward. Aftertaste is dry and suitable to taste. Mouthfeel is crisp with biting carbonation. So easy and pleasurable to drink, my new personal go-to.","Vivelepositif","Sep 14, 2014"

The aroma is full of sweet citrus with a faint earthy characteristic.  There is an assertive hop flavor and bitterness right up front, yet the hop flavor and bitterness are perfectly balanced. Flavor is predominately citrus—like chewing on a grapefruit/orange rind. There is little malt taste present, but I don’t think this beer really needs a malt balance. The mouthfeel is very crisp, with a dry finish.  A truly exceptional DIPA.","thomda11","Aug 28, 2014"

Taste is dominated by huge citrus and grapefruit notes with some floral undertones and some bitterness. Malt presence is hard to distinguish under the huge amount of hops used in this beer. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very good but a little bit too strong on the bitterness in my opinion.","Phyl21ca","Aug 21, 2014"

The aroma is very hop dominated; particularly citrus. The taste is the same - strong citrus hop note but very well balanced by the rich malt backbone. The slightly bitter finish is so good that you almost don't want to lose it with another sip! The carbonation level is superb and the mouth feel quite rich. This is overall a top tier IPA that is perfect for enjoying slowly as you unwind from a tough day.","Retroman40","Aug 07, 2014"

Aromas are very big on orange zest, tropical notes, and spiciness (lots of zing), and caramel malt underbelly. Hops up front present as a citrus peel medley with a touch of resinous notes. The mid-palate is a soiree of sweet malts and spicy flavors, before a pleasant orange peel finish. Aggressive but well balanced. This is quite good, and I'd happily buy more.","droomyster","Aug 06, 2014"

The nose is big and beautiful with lots of citrus and tropical fruits, really juicy with some nice dankness. The taste is just like the nose with some some great bitterness balance off all that sweet fruitiness. The beer is full and round in the mouth without being heavy.

These are the flavors I enjoy most in this style, bright citrus and tropical notes, a natural sweetness that is held perfectly in check by the hops, a wonderful transition to citrus pith and then finishing with the natural bitter dryness of stone fruit pits, leaving traces of the citrus and tropical flavors between sips. Victory has hit a home run here, right out of the park. A Must Try.","blackcompg","Jun 24, 2014"

The beer has some very strong hop notes. The notes consist of orange and an earthy smell with a bit of tarty apple. The earthy smell is a bit strong and curls the nose a little bit but is certainly bearable and gives the beer a fairly unique aroma that isn't found in other hops. No real malt backbone to detect. The beer taste is somewhat similar to the smell. The taste has the orange notes and earthy taste from the smell but the orange/grapefruit notes are stronger than the pungent taste. The flavor reminds me a little of an orange creamsicle. There also appears to be a slight malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with very little carbonation. The feel is creamy. Overall, a fairly unique DIPA and worth getting at least once.","HattedClassic","Jun 18, 2014"

Aroma of citrus hops with hints of pine, apple family and light tropical fruit. Flavor very nicely integrated pale malt supporting flavorful citrus, piney and slightly dank hops, very herbal and fresh tasting with a lingering citrus rind, piney and herbal hop bitterness. Medium bodied with pleasant light creaminess. Not as intensely hop bitter as the aroma suggests, but the depth of flavor is remarkable. Little flavor from the malt, but it adds body and a supports the fruit and hop flavors very well. Probably a not absolutley fresh bottle, having travelled across country and into Washington's Byzantine distribution system, but still top notch. I will make this a top priority next time I'm in the east to drink fresh. Excellent hop flavored IPA.","LiquidAmber","Jun 16, 2014"

Lace is spotty but present. Smell is amazing. Big nose of peach and mango dance out and are followed by a tangerine sweet citrus note. Taste follows starting tropical with more mango than peach. Tangerine fight there way in mid palate and are met with an earthy and herbal edge that's very welcomed. A hoppy, citrusy and slightly piney finish make you forget how sweet it started. Initially very healthy carbonated and lively mouthfeel is refreshing. It smooths out a bit over time, taking on a creamier feel with a body that never surpasses medium. It's amazing what they've done here. A legit DIPA that drinks like one of the top in the class and can be had anytime. Great job!","HopBomb515","Jun 07, 2014"

Citrus for sure in the aroma, lots of grapefruit and even a touch of pineapple and lime. Citrus comes through again in the taste with a hop bitterness that doesn't really kick you in the teeth or leave you wanting. Not a whole lot of maltiness, but just enough to smooth it out a touch.

Beautiful light orange color, slightly cloudy. Nose is strong citrus, with a bit of pine and a twinge of sharp bitterness. Taste follows, bright orange and lemon flavors balanced by a bitter kick at the end. All flavors are very smooth, this one's a bit lower on the sweet/malty scale in favor of the hop blast. Light and pleasant mouthfeel. Overall, a great DIPA, not quiet on level with the very top tier, but for the availability and price this is one of the best value beers available.

Very fresh (but to Greg's chagrin... no bottle dates). Good thing that I trust The Andersons. Light golden hue (exactly what I aim for in my homebrewed IPAs; and never achieve) with 1/2 finger of marshmallow white head which left some lacing. Not a huge nose (especially compared to the fresh Citra-Hero from earlier), but a good nose. Very fresh... notes of citrus and pine. This was also v. cold from the fridge, and the aromas amplified a bit as I nursed this beauty. Lemon zest and a shockingly clean bitterness opened the salvo... with a huge PUNCH of pine on the end. Something about the clean taste of this beer... follow me here, makes it taste like you are drinking it off of an ice block (circa 1997 frat parties in run down colonials in Bloomsburg PA; in a GOOD way). Just amazingly refreshing. Great IPA mouthfeel. Good carbonation, crisp, a bit dry, and not oily. Again, clean comes to mind. I never knew that something that was so clean could come from the Philadelphia area (just kidding, let's go Mets). I don't really have to tell you to buy this, do I?","Mikus","May 13, 2014"

Victory is on the other side of the state from me so this one is available for a great price point which has made it a main stay as I usually buy it by the case. After drinking so much of this I know this beer hits its sweet spot about 2 weeks after its bottled and packed.They used Simcoe, Chinook, Citra, Mosaic hops on this one and I loved what they did with them. A mix of a few old school hops with some newer tough to get ones. They let the hops control the show in this one but its not quite the hop bomb that a Heady topper is. I wonder what yeast they used in this because I feel like its contributing some of the Mango/peach notes in this one. Either way this is an excellent beer no matter how you cut it even if you don't have to travel to the ends of earth to get it.","Evahflow","Apr 24, 2014"

Smell was pleasant and wonderful with hints of what I would describe as almost leaves of a lemongrass plant. Taste is truly fantastic and I was unsure if I would like I would enjoy this DIPA since I've been let down before by highly raved about brews. Clean, crisp, medium-bodied mouthfeel and very easy to drink. Overall the aroma of the beer did not match the taste but for me this made for a wonderful beer. Great DIPA that I can't wait to get my hands on again!","dpgoblejr","Apr 21, 2014"

Moved to AZ ten years ago and could not get it until recently. when it came available a few months ago, I immediately picked up some of the Prima Pils and it lives up to my memory and remains a great pilsner. being a huge IPA and double and imperial IPA guy, I was really excited when I noticed DirtWolf at Total Wine. I got a growler and brought it home to pair with some rare seared sushi grade salmon and kale salad. dinner was great, but in short the DirtWolf was a drain pour, a waste of $6.99 IMO. it wasn't like the keg was bad, maybe it was, but rather this beer seemed to have the hop profile, but it seems like a one dimensional beer, no backbone to speak of, flat tasting yet with seeming plenty of carbonation. vinegar like. just kind of a cheap IPA. I would probably buy a 12oz bottle one time to try it again to see if I had a bad batch or if I just wasn't in the mood, but from the growler experience this stuff is not good. I dumped it.","ZionNation","Apr 17, 2014"

Resulting color is a medium gold that is wonderfully opaque. Aroma is mostly true to form: Flowery and bold. I did note hints of burnt toast which was not expected but neither was it deterring. Outstanding taste that leaves zero doubt that you are experiencing a hearty double IPA... Very bold. Mouth feel is obvious and lingers. This double IPA outshines its beloved predecessor - Hop Wallop - while not losing any of Wallop's appealing characteristics. The hop blend used is outstanding and is balanced to near perfection. Bonus points to Victory for its creative labeling.","The-Sud-Truth","Apr 15, 2014"

Poured a beautiful golden yellow with very tight bubbles and a nice pillowy head. Nose is all hops - strong dried pineapple, citrus fruits, some peach and apricot. There is pine there as well but the fruit aroma was strongest. Taste follows the nose closely - lots of fresh pineapple juice with some peach in there. No hint of the 8.7% in there at all, though it is very, very sweet - strong honey-ish malt profile, some yellow box cake sweetness. Some mango in there as well. The mouthfeel started creamy but ended dry and made me want more. Overall this was great and really delightful. Will certainly have again.","jwchestnut","Apr 06, 2014"

I have had a few Victory beers years ago, but I thought I would revisit this one and I got this one at a good deal at a local place that was running a storewide sale, So I figured what the hell? This one has a nice hazy golden color too it, not too many floaties in it, which has been common this year, it was smooth but left a bitter bite on the back of the palate which lingered for a while. It is nearly 9% abv which might get too you because overall its pretty smooth for a DIPA, It does have an earthy dirty dankness to it, which I liked. I am planning on doing a review of Stone Enjoy by as a comparison, because I have heard it described as dank as well. This is a good beer and I actually have two four packs to go through so I am happy of my purchase and may give Victory a chance again. I truly did enjoy this one and look forward to working through the two wolfpacks I purchased, I just wish they had it in six packs, but sometimes that is the way of the world.","humuloner22","Apr 06, 2014"

The grapefruit and pine smells are overwhelming in this one and hit you right as you pour the glass. There's also a ripe mango, some clean malts, and a floral quality to the nose. Grapefruit again shows up big in the taste, with lemon peel, grass, mouth-coating hop resins, and clean, sweet malts. It finishes dry and very bitter. There's a nice level of carbonation in this beer that tingles the back of the mouth and enhances the sting of the hop bomb.","itsscience","Beers"

It was slightly hazy as there were bits of sediment in the bottom of my glass, but nothing like that detracts from a beer in my book. The aroma was full of dank tropical fruit hops with a hint of peach underneath. The taste was a full hop explosion that started with the tropical fruitiness and dank tones that melded into citrus notes that ended in bitter prickly pine that danced on my palate and lingered between tastes. This was definitely a big aromatic and multidimensional Double IPA that was easily drinkable and a well executed beer. Very fruity and very balanced.","brurevu","Apr 02, 2014"

The color looks like a saison, while the head reminds me more of a pale ale. Lacing is lacking, with the bubbles falling back into the drink. Slippery instead of sticky. Lots of pine with lemon and grapefruit, some pitch, and a hint of sweet fruit like apricot. Flavor is surprisingly sweet, but not close to cloying. Like a Mexican sweet bread made with darker flour and a kiss of lemon. The back end is smooth but decidedly bitter with the citrus and pine playing their part. Finish is very dry, drying the mouth, and the body is rock solid. This is a very good double IPA more in line with the West Coast style where the hops really shine and the malt gets out of the way. This goes the Lagunitas route with the sweet malt, making it a showcase, but not the main event. I wouldn't mind having this more regularly and I'm glad Victory is back in the Bay Area.","Philousa","Mar 11, 2014"

Not overly bitter, but hugely hoppy, and the hop varieties they chose make a great team. It doesn't wear its big ABV like a badge of honor, but keeps it under wraps. This is just a big ol' tasty fruit cocktail of a brew, and absolutely worth finding. Great beer.","jokelahoma","Mar 07, 2014"

Powerful hop flavor that mixes the dank side with the citrus and not too bitter. It's got enough body, but feels light and the alcohol is well hidden. A solid DIPA that drinks like an IPA.

I could not, however, get over the onion that I kept noticing, especially on the finish. I tasted three different bottles with the same result.

This ale pours a hazy golden amber color with a lot of white head that gives way to a nice film and substantial lacing. The nose is the best thing about this beer. It is super fresh and hoppy. Lots of notes of citrus, pine, and some great skunky weed. There is a slightly malty note but it is minimal at best. The beer pours fairly thick and sticky definitely on the heavier side of medium bodied. The flavor is hoppy and citrus but not overly so. There is more malt on the tongue than there was on the nose. This bottle seems very fresh and is quite good but I feel Victory's Hop Ranch is a better offering on the whole. That being said, I'd never pass this up if I saw it in a store again.","lochef81","Mar 03, 2014"

The beer has a slim head, moderate lace, and some serious effervescence. The smell is of earthy, fresh, herbal hops. Some malt is behind the hops, but far, far behind (it's been lapped). The taste is not at all balanced...spicy, peppery, tingly hops...and some serious warming and spritzy carbonation. Beautifully interesting. The finish is bitter and lingering. Expected, and not exceptionally creative, but this is a full force, very enjoyable, serious beer.","Suds","Feb 13, 2014"

4.33,0.9,3.75,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,"Overall: I don't think Dirt Wolf lives up to the hype. Maybe it's because I've been indulging in Enjoy By, Head Hunter, Chillwave, etc., but it seems too watery, and whatever good flavors are there, are muted, borderline astringent, and comes off as a bit of an imitation of the greats in my opinion. However, this beer is still solid, local to me, and reasonably priced, which is why I keep coming back.","Bone53","0"

Oh yeah, pine, biscuits, resinous hops. Perhaps a touch of tropical fruit in the flavor, but not much. Alcohol presence is certainly there, but not overly so. Definitely a balance of malt to hops, though favoring the hop character. Medium to full bodied for the style. Lingering hop bitterness and bready notes. Overall, pretty tasty.","Huhzubendah","Feb 12, 2014"

So smooth and polished bringing a ton of fresh and wet nature upfront followed by a beautiful soft complimentary bitterness on the trail. Honestly the growler never stood a chance. The balance and polished nature of this beer is just so harmonous it will be near impossible to just have one, or two, or three. Not to be a factor the price point at $12 a growler is perhaps the best bargin in craft beer i have ever had and ends up easily as a possible top five double ipa canidate in my book. It is worthy the hype, seeking out, waiting in line and multiple case purchasing (and this comes from a guy who primarily drinks em one and done as singles). Dont worry about the hops expiring, the cases will never sit around that long. A definite wow factor beer for me.","beerthulhu","Feb 08, 2014"

The hops are pungent in the nose! The flavor starts with a bitter assault of pine hops which is followed up by fruit, orange, grapefruit, with heavy bitterness throughout. This definitely packs a huge bitter punch with mild malt character mixed in. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated with moderate body.

Pours a nice clear gold- hue with a finger that settles to a really nice espresso like head. the color is brighter and more translucent than most other DIPAs I've had. Aroma is subtle - not a huge nose on this one at all. Taste is fantastic- really emphasizes the hops without a boozy contribution which can sometimes interfere with the taste in DIPAS, in my opinion. There's a nice, clean hop bitterness that lingers on the back. Mouthfeel is also great- light and not sticky or chewy at all like a lot of DIPAS I've had. More like a low abv ipa mouthfeel, which is amazing for an 8% double. Overall, One of the best DIPAS I've had in awhile, glad to see Victory come out with something great as I had kind of lost interest in them recently.","Abstract_Alegebra","Feb 01, 2014"

Mint, melon, jackfruit (bubblegum), and of course citrus, come forward balanced out with malt sweetness, and a great lingering bitterness, followed with the alcohol.

Pours a translucent golden-orange with a loose, sudsy, one inch, cream-colored head that eventually settles into a frothy cap. Swaths of lacing coat the walls of the glass during the tasting. Nose expresses citrus zest, a hint of tangerine sweetness and an earthy/musty character. Taste consistent with nose; however, there's also a suggestion of Simcoe hops (aka cat pee) spice and pineyness in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a lively carbonation that offers a bit of a bite at the finish. An interesting an complex DIPA. Not something I would consider a go-to for the style, but really quite enjoyable. Nice job Victory!","Jwale73","Jan 25, 2014"

The beer looks like it has a fairly thin body for a DIPA, but I don’t think Victory aspired to achieve balance…this beer is clearly about the hops. In fact, American hops crush your nose from the time you pop the crown. At first, there is some subtle underlying pine scent, but the big ones are grapefruit and citrus. Clearly, this is a heavily hopped beer but is still less than that overwhelming dank bitterness you get in some DIPA’s. The citrus flavors help to keep this bitter beast palatable and the carbonation is medium, which makes it easy to drink. You are left with the pine and grapefruit after you drink, which subsides when you get the blast of citrus in your nose while enjoying your next sip. Overall, this is an enjoyable DIPA that I would drink again, but I was expecting a bit more based on what I have heard from others.","mearner","Jan 17, 2014"

Up front look for tropical hop flavors, pineapple, papaya and mango. Along the mid-palate is a tart-citric hop flash and bitter resinous piney presence. On the back end look for that bold brash rustic earthy bitterness. Finishes slick with a lingering bitterness and fruitiness that builds with every sip. An amazing blend of hops that showcases their fruity sweet characters and balances with their bold bittering properties. Mouthwatering to say the least. (At cooler temperatures you can taste more of those earthy bitter flavors while as the beer warms you can expect to taste more of the fruity sweet hop flavors)","jtierney89","Jan 08, 2014"

A sparse, film, bright white surface coat of head clings throughout while you drink. Aromas of wet, resinous hops, with bitter notes throughout, tangy citrus highlights of tangerine and grapefruit, subtle pine notes, and a rich caramel backbone. This smells pretty damn good! Flavors are roast and resin forward, with piney notes throughout. Subtle citrus highlights accent the bold malt backbone of caramel, and there are kicks of pepper, cut grass, pine tassel, and bitterness throughout. Very dynamic and layered palate, with a resinous undertone throughout that is a hophead's dream. Very tasty, and very drinkable despite increased ABV and heavier taste profiles. The body is robust and smooth, yet kept light with the increased carbonation. That same carbonation also helps clean up the finish, which comes together as a crisp, slightly effervesced, bitter finale. Great beer!","GarthDanielson","0"

4.08,-4.9,4,4,4.25,3.75,4,"Enjoy by 3/27/14. Golden pour with a strong head that laces well. Nose is of hops, mostly earthy (dank) and citrus, but there is pine in the background. Light medium body with typical carbonation resulting in a smooth, but not slick, mouthfeel. The taste is a mixture of hops against a slight sweetness. Dank and citrus flavors are the most forward, with pine in the background. The bitterness component has grapefruit characteristics. Smooth finish with a lingering grapefruit tartness and bitterness over a nice dankcentric aftertaste. Well balanced overall.","tillmac62","Dec 25, 2013"

This big, satisfying, but also reasonably drinkable. It's going to be hard not to crack open a second bottle. This beer's a real pleasure.","tempest","Dec 21, 2013"

Feels more like 10+% beer and most of the interesting flavor falls off mid-palate.","corby112","Dec 16, 2013"

The nose is a bit weaker than expected, though I can't determine exactly how fresh this bottle is. I gather some notes of citrus, pineapple, peppermint, and grass. The taste packs in the right amount of hoppy bitter-fruitiness and backbone malty sweetness with a slightly lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, quite effervescent, masked alcohol, not too bitter/sweet, slightly dry finish, and pleasant lingering bitterness.

The taste was loaded with grapefruit, and very bitter. The whole flower hops were clearly the star attraction here, and the malt was very unobtrusive. The alcohol level was shockingly well hidden, as there was no burn of any kind. The finish was very dry, with an herbal bitterness. The beer was light and slippery in the mouth, providing a refreshing jolt of bitterness in each sip that did not linger on or coat the mouth. This was truly in the dry West Coast mode of DIPA presentation, and I love that style of beer.","rajendra82","Nov 30, 2013"

Malts are more candy-like in the flavor. Kind of sweet for me. Hops are solid, though, but I'd like more of that grassy/oniony flavor to break up the heavy maltiness.

Nose is floral and festive for the beginning of this Advent season. Taste is lovey bouquets, but nothing close to the intense hop bitterness I was hunkering down for given the "imperial" label. Wonderful balance and subtlety! DirtWolf doesn't bowl you over like a clumsy rhino, but rather hunts you down as a pack and brings you to where it wants to take you with time. Aftertaste is Christmas tree pine. The perfect ale for a family pack hunt for an evergreen.","Rast","Nov 29, 2013"

As a lover of big beers and preferably double, or triple ipas, the DirtWolf was destined to be right up my alley. However I didn't expect this beer to take over my palate and never let it go. I love this beer, fantastically floral and earthy it pops onto your tongue and placates it with a wealth of intense hops and dry malt back.

That's a great thing but not nearly as great as discovering this for yourself - Victory has a winner here and the only shame with this beer is that it comes in 4-packs, since I'm craving more of this as I type my review out.","JerzDevl2000","Nov 15, 2013"

Small particles of sediment are seen floating around in the beer after the pour. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and some earthy, herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with grapefruit and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that has a huge citrus presence that comes through especially well in the taste.","UCLABrewN84","Nov 13, 2013"

Lots going on in the aroma-first peach, melon, and citrus, then pepper, grass and pine. So potent, almost seems minty. Some evidence of bready malts to balance the hoppy goodness. The flavor is a continuation of the aroma, hoppy from the tip of the tongue to the back. More citrus rind, some grapefruit pith, and the finish leaves you with a trace of caramel. Big, fruity, and earthy and it begs you to drink up in spite of the abv, which could be ignored if you weren't careful. Well done! Nice addition to the Victory lineup.","qchic","Nov 12, 2013"

A big wallop of hops, but they tend to blend together. Some pine on top of the others. The taste is good. It has a good bitterness, but the taste is a bit unusual. The various hops blend together into a distinctive bitterness, without having any one specific aroma on top. Maybe a hint of pineapple coming through. The malts are hidden. Definitely dry. Interesting. It definitely grows on you.","Boto","Nov 05, 2013"

Aromas of big lemon zest, pineapple, peach, mango, tangerine, orange zest, orange rind, floral, grass, pine, light honey, bread, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of hop notes with a fair amount of malt balance; and good strength. Taste of big lemon zest, tangerine, orange zest, orange rind, pineapple, peach, pine resin, floral, grass, light honey, bread, and floral earthiness. Large amount of pine resin bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest/rind, pineapple, peach, pine resin, floral, grass, light bread, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of hop flavors with a fair amount of malt balance; with a great crisp bitterness/malt balance that never gets cloying. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an insane DIPA! Awesome complexity and balance of hop flavors with moderate malts; and very crisp and dangerously drinkable for the ABV. An incredible offering all around.","superspak","Beers"

Unfortunately it also means that DirtWolf is probably at its prime for only a month or so before it becomes ignored by anyone who knows how to read a bottling/enjoy by date. Get it while it's fresh, the price is very reasonable. Would I drink it again? Yes, I imagine it would be really good on-tap.","JamesMN","Oct 28, 2013"

Aroma is heavy on the fruit...melon, grapefruit, and tangerine with underlying pine resin and a floral pungency. Heavy, ripe, oily fruit in the flavor. The focus seems to be more on a melon-like greenness and big time pineapple rather than citrus. Medium bodied with an oily slickness and a fairly tame bitterness for what it is. Pretty sticky - not overly sweet, but I`m not sure I could have more than one without it wearing on my palate a bit.

It’s like every part of it is outstanding, but set at Level 9 instead of 11. That said, this is a fantastic new DIPA, and it’s great to see Victory take a new swing at a hypercompetitive style and show that they nail it just as easily as they do their long-time standbys. Great beer and a greate value—seek it out.","fmccormi","Oct 26, 2013"

The argument for a 'Kicking Against the Pricks' designation is a sound one, maybe even an altogether reasonable one (the large extent of its substance being already explored and the debate of preferences being, somewhat moreso than others, subjective). However, with its poignant aggressiveness and general lack of risks noted alongside its immediate (and, at times, deserved) acclaim, I'm going to go ahead, follow my heart, and give it a solid 'Murder Ballads'.","QuentinCall","Oct 25, 2013"

Not much malt to be found, except a little sweetness in the background. The taste is similar. Lots of hops, sweet and full of flavor. Citrus, stone fruit, some pine and a bit of tropical fruit.

It is not a beer that holds up to the standards I desire of the few excellent west coast beers available on the east coast such as Firestone or Green Flash. The initial smell is not of grapefruit and the taste is not as hoppy and bitter as my very narrow palate desires. I can understand when a brewer does not want to go more extreme in order to sell more product. I think this is a nice compromise for a product that I would drink again but do not dream about while finishing another shift at work!","ETCO2","Oct 22, 2013"

Aroma has citrus, earthy layers of hops fresh off the vine it's a green fresh hop experience in a year round offering, it's crazy. Flavor wise it explodes with hop bitterness bringing you to the edge of comfort on the palate with insane herbal, citrus, tropical fruit hop bitterness. I'm in love, and it's way too drinkable at that. No freshness dates on the bottle, you have to check this beer out it's packed with loads of whole leaf hops bringing a DIPA from Victory to another level. Candied citric hops ride the flavor out not too sweet finishes more balanced than most hoppy offerings but doesn't kill the palate and hop head experience with malt sweetness. An enjoyable beer to be had by all, especially those beer drinker's who are craving hops. It's my third bottle and the hops just keep getting more and more addicting, this is the type of DIPA that is going to sell out in cases, smooth carbonation oily slick mouthfeel medium to light bodied goes down without any effort. Great beer I'm glad this is going to be available year round, big step for Victory Brewing.","WVbeergeek","Oct 22, 2013"

4.29,0,4.25,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,"Overall I thought this was a very nice beer and very nice example of the style, it really highlights the tropical fruit and citrus hops nicely while not being overly bitter and being pretty drinkable and refreshing. This beer had pretty good drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, clean, not filling, and the taste did a great job at holding my attention, I could see myself drinking a few of these without getting bored with it. What I liked the most about this beer was the hop profile, it was great, it wasn't too better and it really showcased the kind of hops I love. What I liked the least about this beer was the carbonation, it wasn't bad but I thought it could be toned down just a little. I would for sure buy this beer again, I may have to pick up a four pack next time I'm at the store. I would recommend this to anyone who loves hoppy beers. All in all I'm a little impressed with this beer, it came pretty close to being as good as I had heard it was and while it's not my favorite of the style, it's still a damn good beer. I thought Hop Wallop was a good beer, but I think this one is better and I don't think I'll be missing Hop Wallop anytime soon, so far DirtWolf is my favorite beer from Victory.. Great job Victory, I've been overlooking this brewery a little but they sure got my attention now, keep up the great work guys.","StoutHunter","0"

Medium to lowish carbonation for the style, slick, but still feels light enough on the palate. This one gets lighter as I go, and is dangerously drinkable.

This certainly did not disappoint and all the positive reviews are well vindicated. It pours a clear straw gold colour with a white fluffy head. Aroma is wonderful, a real citrus bomb with a blast tropical notes. The taste follows suit, the citra hop dominates with tropical notes of peach, mango, and papaya. The other hop varietals bring good balance and flavour, and while citrus remains at the core, but there is some grassiness and spiciness that keeps things interesting. The bitterness is present, and whilst hoppy, isn't overpowering and supported by a modest malt bill. This beer is extremely smooth and the alcohol impressively well hidden making it dangerously drinkable. All in all, Victory have done a great job here in producing an excellent ipa that stands out in a very saturated market. It is also an impressive departure from Hop Wallop, which despite being a decent brew, is left in the dust by this. I expect as distribution continues to widen people will remain impressed by this beer, and at $10 a four pack, it is very accessible. Highly recommended!","davet100","Oct 18, 2013"

Smells of dank pine, mango, pineapple, grapefruit, marmalade, floral, light breadiness, and some carmel. Taste is filled with tons of pine and grapefruit. Beginning brings wet pine, grapefruit, and mango. The middle brings bready malts, carmel, as well as more grapefruit and pine that is not as intense as before. The finish turns to more of a tropical fruit like papaya or guava, as well as a sweeter grapefruit and mango. Not much breadiness like before, but do get sweet carmel to somewhat balance the onslaught of hops on the finish. The resinous pine comes back and adds a west coast style dryness to the beer. Multiple hop flavors linger on the palate. High medium body with an oily and sticky mouthfeel. Get tons of juicy citrus and tropical fruits from the citra and mosaic, yet you also get lots of spicy pine and grapefruit from the simcoe and chinook.

First off this brew has a fantastic smell of citrus and mild earthy hops- smells very much like many west coast citraesque beers. I wouldn't call this a one sided or lopsided hoppy brew, but the hops come forth with an a vengeance and stay with you. The malt backbone is there but it in no way takes away from the hoppy nature of the brew. I personally love this quality of DirtWolf as I am not so much into malt taking away from the hop presence in many DIPAS. This is easily in my new top 10 DIPAS and I will certainly buy more. The only downside is that it comes in a 4 pack! I am able to bet Heady on a weekly basis so this is a great rival and slightly less expensive. I strongly recommend this brew to all who desire a hop forward DIPA where the malt takes a back seat as it should!","80x2HopHead","Oct 12, 2013"

4.4,2.6,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its drinkability, but this didn’t come too far after its bright aroma and flavoring. Our first thought when sniffing back on this guy was “Heady Topper”. It seems like, across most aspects of the beer, they were attempting to mimic that exact profile, with bright and tropical fruitiness, clean malts, and insanely juicy, but invitingly clean hops. To compare to Hop Wallop, the beer that Dirtwolf (I keep thinking, saying, and typing “Direwolf”…can’t shake it for some reason!!) is replacing, it is very different. The former attempts much more to knock you to the ground with as big a hop bitterness as they can muster, whereas here, the goal appears to be cleanliness of blend and form, drinkability, and more delicate (but explosive) hops inclusions. Either way this is a welcomed beer, and Victory really nailed this one. While this may not be the most “original” DIPA, this will easily become a fridge regular as it’s got just the right blend that makes beers like this so approachable, with a consistent experience that is reproducible every time.","TheBrewo","Oct 12, 2013"

Poured with a healthy, rich, white foam that slowly reduced to a soapy cap that left sheets of wet lacings on the glass. Pungent citrus hop aromas are dominant with malty sweetness just barely eking through beneath. An incredible aroma. Medium bodied with even, refreshing carbonation throughout and tangy, dry finish. Pungent citrus hop bitterness arrests the taste buds at first with a tangy bite. Fresh tangerine and grapefruit flavors through the middle almost as if you’ve just taken a bite of either one. Malts characters are allowed some attention from the middle to the end. Finishes with a citrusy, bitter hoppiness that is accentuated by the crisp dry feel. A touch of booziness creeps in as this warms. I’m a big fan of Victory and even this exceeded expectation.","IronLover","Oct 05, 2013"

Definitely a pretty big citrus bomb with almost a peach/tropical hint to it. Perfect balance of sweet to bitter as nothing took over the other. Incredibly smooth mouthful and drinkability. Couldn't even detect the alcohol. Actually liked this beer better than the enjoy by and is easily in the top 5 dipas that I've ever had. Victory nailed this one. Probably won't reach status of heady or Pliny (probably due mainly to how available it will be so there isn't the rarity factor) but if you're looking for a citrus forward dipa, this would be tops on many list. Factor in price point ($2 a bottle locally) and you won't find a better dipa out there for the price (and probably worth twice...no, no actually it sucks cause I don't want the price to go up).","mj81","Oct 04, 2013"

The beer has a nice fluffy head that lingers and lots of lacing. Very aromatic. I don't get any citrus or tropical flavors at all, it's just straight up cat piss for me. It's a fine beer and many will love this, just not for me.","thlayli87","Sep 28, 2013"

4.85,13.1,5,5,4.75,5,4.75,"Can i just start by saying, WOW! I haven't reviewed in a while but this one deserves a review. I had a Pliny the Elder yesterday, so my tongue knows a good IPA right now. And this one has a huge tropical nose. I could smell it as soon as I opened the bottle. Tropical fruit and dankness. The mouth feel is extremely similar to Pliny, it has the smooth roundness and fizz just around the edge of your tongue that makes it refreshing and bountiful at the same time. There are waves of flavor starting with the tropical fruit, pineapple and mango, pouring into the green dank of pot and lemongrass, dropping right into a bitter cherry and round biscuit crispness. I know crisp and round? I don't get it either, but there it was. It lingers for a long while then cuts out abruptly. For my money and hopefully availability, this is one of the best DIPA's on the market. This stuff knocks Lunch off the shelf.","redleaves","Sep 27, 2013"
