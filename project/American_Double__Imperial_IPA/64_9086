First sip tastes like cotton candy dissolved in rubbing alcohol. Hot alcohol exhale. Spicy apricot with caramel middle. Hoppy candy finish. Intense heavy alcohol laden mouthfeel. Big flavors, rich sherry like linger - very few beers compete at this level.","DoctorZombies","Tuesday at 08:37 AM"

However, I am just not liking the flavors and I don't think they are well integrated. They are all over the place. This just seems like a mess. It reminds me a lot of Double Crooked Tree (which I didn't care for either) for reference, or a Molotove Cocktail on the more positive side. It is definitely along the American Barleywine lines more so than an Imperial IPA. I would be open to trying one with some age on it. It cant really be worse for me.","WesMantooth","Sunday at 03:44 PM"

Today I enjoyed the third bottle of 2013 dfh 120 and found it much more pleasant, in fact, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Very hoppy, foamy white head, still slightly boozy in taste, but at this point no more so than your average imperial ipa. 100% improved from one year ago.

Poured a burnt orange, amber color with a thin head that quickly disappeared.  Aromas of booze, booze and more booze with some malt and hops lying beneath.  Little scared what it might taste like.  Turned out to be pleasantly surprised.  Yes lots of booze with a little burn on the finish but a nice mix of malts, hops with fruit.  Caramelized sugars are in there as well.  Sweet taste that lingers on the aftertaste along with hops and booze.  Leaves a tangy taste in the mouth.  More West Coast IPA than East Coast pine tree.  Still sucks the spit out of your mouth like all IPAs.  But less than most.  However, I am guessing a full glass would dry you out due to the alcoholic content.  Probably the perfect beer for outdoor hockey season on a cold day or night.  However, I sure as heck wouldn't be driving and drinking more than 1 of these beers.","uvachief","Mar 09, 2015"

I recall submitting a post about the only beer I ever drain poured. DFH, forgive me. My best guess is that I didn't check a bottled on date when I danced with this devil more than 7 years ago. Despite claims that it ages well, I am digging the hoppy experience I'm getting from a super fresh bottle. One whiff and a bed of hop cones made their way up the nasal cavity. That intensified with the first sip, featuring multiple layers of citrus notes on steroids, tethered with a honey-like sweetness that conditioned the effervescence of the warming alcohol. Fresh baked bread, so doughy and sweet -- this brilliant mothereffer is one exceptional treat. Hats off to Sam and his entire crew. I am sorry that I revisited this world-class beverage with reservations. My palate just did a flawless rendition of Beethoven's unreleased symphony.

Incredibly sweet, overwhelmingly so, the sweetness cut simply by the warming booze. Perhaps as it warmed some acidic hop notes emerge, but they're quiet at best and do nothing to stem the tide of sickeningly sweet malt and booze. I applaud the novelty of it all and the effort to experiment/expand our notion of beer...but this just falls incredibly flat.","breadwinner","Feb 02, 2015"

I enjoyed this over a 2 hour period and appreciated the changes as it warms. This is a great beer, but is difficult to find and expensive when you do.  For me, personally, that takes away from the beer. Definitely worth a try if you're curious. You won't find too many beers like it.","ColdOneKev","Dec 06, 2014"

As the yeast gorge themselves on the massive amount of sugar, they are unable to process it all and are thus left with not only a high alcohol content but also a powerful sweetness. But even this sweetness cannot outpace the bouquet of hops present in this extravagantly hopped beer. With an extremely high price tag, this is not one for the light of heart. If you love extreme IPAs then you will love this beer.","NinjaJesus","Dec 02, 2014"

Some hop profile in the nose but it definitely takes a back seat to the boozy, malty caramel notes. Taste is enjoyable. No burn but some bite. Sweet malt character shines through. Some brief hop notes in the finish. More hops in the aftertaste than anything. Mouthfeel is thick and heavy. Overall I really enjoyed this. Loved the fresh aspect of it.

1.5,-63.5,,,,,,"This beer is ambitious and that is all it is. I like Dogfish Head as a brewery, and I am really glad they are in Bloomington and Indiana on the whole, but this beer frankly is just awful with no redeeming characteristics. I ended up drain pouring it. I have had enough beers like Founders Devil Dancer that I can appreciate an ambitious attempt at making a one-of-a-kind beer, however, this beer is just too much. There is fine line between a pleasant beer, which rather than attacking the palate attempts to work with it, and a beer that fights your palate every step of the way. I wouldn't recommend this beer to my worst enemy.","TCJ0100","Oct 19, 2014"

I enjoyed and shared this beer while watching a beautiful summer sunset. The beer's bright golden/orange color blended beautifully with the changing sky. As I said, I shared this beer and even half of it got me quite buzzed. This is because the alcohol content is so strong; if you are looking for a beautiful high this is the beer for you. The hops aroma and taste is intense yet it achieves for me a perfect balance with delicious syrupy and caramel like malt sweetness. One of the few beers I can give a 5 to. Quite possibly perfect. We're it not so expensive ($10+ per bottle) my fridge would be stacked with these beauties!","Gajo74","Oct 13, 2014"

4.13,0.5,4.25,4.25,4,4,4.25,"2011 Vintage. Poured into snifter, a honey gold amber with a razor thin off white head. Aroma upon pouring is sweet floral bouquet, honey and caramel malt notes, some brown sugar. Taste same as aroma, has a nice fruity, citrus orange alcohol flavor with a mild hops bite, which has undoubtedly been mellowed by the aging. Plate is a full creamy and smooth body, with good carbonation. The finish is a combination of all the aforementioned taste and flavor, although they intensify as it warms up, the ending is sweet with some light annotations of some vanilla and earthiness and actual bitterness intensifies a bit as well. alcohol seems to be well hidden. Almost barley wine style. Overall a very good, full flavored after dinner drink.","Samp01","Sep 29, 2014"

4.75,15.6,,,,,,"Had this on tap for the first time after many years of drinking bottles. I love this beer no matter how it's served, but I do recommend aging it for about 3 years before drinking. When it's fresh it's all hops and booze. When it's aged all sorts of different flavors emerge, the boozyness goes away and it changes color from blonde to more of an amber.  It kind of tastes like bourbon when aged with a nice vanilla/raisin lingering finish. Be careful when drinking, this one will knock you flat on your ass.","ConanSachler","Sep 26, 2014"

Tastes pretty good actually. Not really an IPA flavor though. Much more like a barley wine. Lots of alcohol burn. Feels more like drinking liquor than beer. I’m glad I have someone to share with.","kkleu357","Sep 26, 2014"

Knowing that, you go into it knowing that there will be an alcohol presence in every sip.  I drank this one over the course of about an hour or more and by the end as it warmed it mellowed quite a bit.  I enjoyed this one for sure.","JStampler","Sep 24, 2014"

They really produce a good beer. This 120 falls right in line, and probably to the top, with their other beers. I am a fan. They have a way of filling every gap that their water allows. Excellent flavor and I am happy to have made the trade (just one!) for a heady. Highly recommend for anyone, not just IPA fanatics like me.","EraDehops","Sep 20, 2014"

While the taste has those I also get some slight apricot bitterness with burnt orange peel hiding in there too. The alcohol content is very noticeable in this one, but that adds a lot to its character. Grab some and cellar for those cold rainy days.","screamking","Aug 14, 2014"

Outstanding appearance but not as sweet a nose as the 60 and 90. Wow, now that is strong beer, you definitely notice the alcohol in the flavor but does not taste as strong as it is, but you do get the warmth as the beer goes down. As I drank the beer if continued to grow on me, I adjusted to the alcohol and then it became tastier and tastier as it warmed. A great beer and I have to say is worth the price.","JamieDuncan","Aug 13, 2014"

Start out mild but builds very quickly.  Strong caramel sweetness with a citrus note.  The scents and flavors compliment really well. Definitely use a food ipa glass.  The alcohol content is a bit high for my taste but the overall deliciousness of the beer overtakes any negative. If you're a hops fan this is a must try!!","MikeRusso","Aug 13, 2014"

Caramel malt, toffee, and dark fruit aromas with citrussy ripe orange and lemon zest followed by an undeniable booziness. Medium bodied with a thick oily feel through the middle and hot, boozy finish. Caramel malt and toffee flavors up front with ripe citrus flavors in tow that are overwhelmed by heavy, boozy heat from the middle to the end. Finished with a very boozy sweet toffee aftertaste. The bottle says it ages well. Maybe 2 years was too long? This was a very boozy English Barleywine to me. I'd be interested to see what a fresh, unaged bottle tastes like in comparison to this. But, I'd rather put my $10 toward a 4-pack of Burton Baton.","IronLover","Aug 10, 2014"

3.25,-20.9,,,,,,"Having had this on tap and out of a bottle and into a snifter, I just cannot dig it. I tried, really hard, but this beer to me is hype. Cool, 18% give or take, but I want flavors and there is just an overwhelming alcohol taste/nose burn from this that I cannot ignore. Don't get me wrong, I'm very happy I tried it and also glad I have a bottle to cellar, but overall, the experience of sharing a glass on tap and sharing a glass out of the bottle was just unpleasant. I love dogfish head, but this one, is not something I would seek out. There are plenty of great high-teen ABV beers and great high ABV IPAs that I would enjoy splitting with someone, but this tasting (actually these two) was more unenjoyable than all of them.  Bottom line to me, is that there is a great deal of hype behind this beer. Maybe I just don't get it. Maybe I don't have the palate. But both my girlfriend and I, who do almost nightly tastings of new/different brews could not dig this either of the  times we've had it. I would only recommend this if you want to say that you've tried it. But, check back in a few years after I've aged one ;) not that I expect my opinion to change much.","Ngntjp","Aug 07, 2014"

Pouring it and taking in it's aromas, my taste buds started salivating immediately. It has a very potent citrus and pine scent with a very enveloping tone of vanilla and herbs giving it a sturdy weight. The actual taste itself lives up to it's aroma completely. It is very rich with a powerful hop flavor! I picked up on some of the finer notes of vanilla, spice, raisin, and a slight mineral flavor all wrapped up in tangy notes of orange and pine. I love this beer. It is truly complex and makes you think about what your drinking. In my opinion, enjoy this one like a fine scotch or bourbon. Just a few sips and I got a head buzz from all those hops! warm it up a little in your glass and your golden. I plan on buying a couple more bottles and letting them age.","AyeMito","Jul 29, 2014"

The aclohol esters are strong and sweet, balancing against a floral note. The big 18% ABV comes up loud in the taste, as well, dominating initially and fading out quickly. The remainder of the flavor is hard to describe. The bad is full and thick and smooth. This is one to sip and enjoy, if for no other reason than it retails $10 or more a bottle.","delta490","Jul 26, 2014"

Let not that be an insult to the brewers: the folks down at Dogfish Head are absolute artists when it comes to beer and have crafted an absolute behemoth of a beverage here. The complexity in the flavor is off-the-charts, and the mouthfeel is absolutely a work of art for a beer of its stature. However, with that being said, DFH 120 Minute, in all of its over-the-top glory, strikes me as a strictly once in a blue moon treat. Something this intense needs to truly be savored and simply can not be enjoyed regularly. I will be purchasing another bottle to age for a few years, and may not find myself drinking it again until said bottle is sufficiently aged.","ThePaintedGrey","Jul 13, 2014"

Taste was nice at first, (by the end of the bottle, I had enough) with a real malty sweetness and a really subdued hop character - hard to believe that the IBU's on this are at 120. Very nice tasting - sweet, with a warmth like a distilled whiskey. I can't say that I didn't enjoy it. I did, it took me around an hour to sip through 12 ounces. I'm glad I tried it.

This aged version is very sweet and fruity, really reminding me of the flavors I get with old and strong ales, much like an ultra-amped version of Old Curmudgeon or Third Coast Old Ale. Very glad I tried this aged, and looking forward to a fresh one. Be careful, this is likely a one-and-done, do not drive after a glass of this BA's :)","blackcompg","Jun 25, 2014"

Honestly, I would rate this in the top ten beers that I've ever had the pleasure of tasting and a world-class beer that truly stands on it's own. I'm still not sure if I'd call this an IPA or even a triple IPA. It's more of a cross between a double IPA and an american barley wine. I'm glad that I finally had the chance to try this fresh. I've been cellaring a couple of bottles for over a year. Looks like it's time for a vertical tasting!","ZachHodgson","May 02, 2014"

Golden amber hue is ideal..slightly foamy head and surprisingly creamy - not thin at all. Taste is very boozy and hops are almost overpowered by the booze.

There's a HUGE hop characteristic to the taste with grapefruit, apricot, orange juice, and orange peel notes. Pitted against that is a cloying sweet malt backbone with molasses and burnt sugar. A lot is going on here and it's overpowering on the palate. The body is full, rich, and boozy: it tastes like someone took a bag of those orange slice jelly candies, liquefied them, and added rum. I also get the taste of plums and raisins, so it has some flavors that are not typically found in double IPAs or other hoppy beers.","itsscience","Mar 26, 2014"

I could have downed a few of these in a sitting but there's no way I'd still be sitting up straight at that point. This was brewed on 2/17 of this year and boy,did it still taste fresh. If it were possible to brew mead and toss in some floral and earthy hops and then add some Belgian sweetness in for good measure, this would be the end result. Nothing on the shelf is quite like this and this is one of those beers that has to be sensed to be believed. A really wonderful surprise here!","JerzDevl2000","Mar 25, 2014"

This beer is much better fresh and I’m glad I had a few fresh bottles this spring since the aged bottle I had in March did not impress me. This 3 month old bottle was great so my view is to drink this beer fresh. This review raised the overall scores across the board here on BA, as this is how I recall this beer being when I first had it years ago. Buy it fresh and drink it. Cheers!","CHickman","Mar 14, 2014"

It is bold, has a lot of character and you can certainly taste the alcohol. However, unlike most beers, the strong alcohol flavor takes nothing away from the taste. If anything, it adds to it. This is a beer that you want to sip on and if possible, condition if for a while as it ages very well. Overall, this is one of the best beers around. My only complaint is the appearance is very plain. However, we all know that it doesn't make a bit of difference to the taste which is why this beer gets a perfect overall score in my book.","topharry123","Feb 15, 2014"

Not as "hoppy as most IPA's surprisingly. The 90 is also very good, and a lot easier to find. This is more of a rare find/special occasion beer for me.","fire34fighter","Jan 04, 2014"

More Liqueur than beer, this beverage needs to come with a warning. A warning that it should only be consumed in small quantities after a hearty meal. Very much digestif-like.

The taste kind reminds me of white wine (Chardonnay); however, It has a much more complex taste than wine. It's surprising how smooth this beer is for its alcohol content. It goes down very smooth for the 18% ABV contained in the beer. I would definitely buy this one again. My only advice is please drink responsibly because this beer is very smooth for the amount of alcohol that it contains, making it a really good beer.","Tonmeister","Jun 04, 2013"
4.57,11.2,4.5,4.25,4.75,4.25,4.75,"overall: I was expecting a not very drinkable alcohol bomb, and what I got was quite different. For the high ABV, this was way more balanced and drinkable than I would have ever expected. You can actually pick out hops and the malt backbone and not just the alcohol. Dogfish Head took it to the extreme with this one, and it came out amazingly balanced. For the curious, this is an easy choice, just buy it. Worth the $10, will buy again on special occasions. You feel great after just one...","Roman5150","Jun 04, 2013"

4.25,3.4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"All in all I thought this was a good beer and a very good and extreme example of the style, once you get past the intensity there some nice layers of flavors and aromas that make it a pretty complex beer that's nice to sip on. It didn't have the best drinkability, it's going to take me quite awhile to make it through the whole bottle and I really don't see a way that I could drink another one unless I wanted to get completely wasted, one is the perfect size and it would also be nice to split with someone. What I like the most about this beer was how complex it was, it seems like every time I smelled or sipped it I picked up a new aspect that I didn't get before. What I liked the least about this beer was the high amount of sweetness, I know beers this strong are always pretty sweet but this one was bordering on syrupy sweet. I would buy this beer again, If I see it again I would like to get a couple bottle for the cellar, I have no doubt that this will age well and hopefully it will get a little smoother with age, I would recommend this to anyone who likes strong and intense beers, just because you like a couple IPA's doesn't mean your ready to take on the hop and alcohol onslaught which is 120 Minute IPA. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, it wasn't as harsh as I was expected but it was still a very intense beer that isn't for the faint of heart. Dogfish Head did a great job with this beer, I know when a brewing a beer that is this strong it can get to be pretty difficult and it shows how confident Dogfish Head is to regularly make a beer that's this intense and so difficult to brew, it takes balls to do something like that and you have to be a little crazy, but it all comes together as one hell of experience that everyone should have least once. So far this is the strongest beer I have ever had, I think it's about 18%. Good job Dogfish Head, it's nice to have a brewery like you guys that makes special beers like these that are great to have on special occasions, here's to 600 more reviews.","StoutHunter","May 23, 2013"

Medium to smallish head which dissipates quickly, yet laces nicely. Wonderful citrus fruity/produce market aroma. Oranges, pine, lemongrass, melon. Big sip... Sweet, full bodied. First thing to go through my mind is the word Barleywine. Citrus, dark fruit and big brown sugar. Far from tasting like an IPA, except for the hop bitterness across the very middle. The back end is surprisingly sweet. Good lingering aftertaste. I found this to be more carbonated than what I expected from reading other reviews. Alcohol is masked well by the ABUNDANCE of flavors, but is HIGHLY evident as soon as it hits the belly. Alcohol hits you similar to a warm red wine buzz. Body is slightly thick and sticky. A good beer to sip and swirl, and it warms very well. One word description of this beer: Relaxing.","jgurley","May 04, 2013"

Flavor started off with a nice hit of hop bitterness. Finish was very sweet. Lots of malt and full bodied. Not as boozy as I would have expected.

Taste was also very different and hard to detect much hops. Tastes much like it smelled for me, primary flavors were malty, caramel, figs etc. super high alcohol content not that noticeable. But beer is very sweet and different than I expected, (not hoppy at all). Glad I tried it but tastes more like a barley wine. Hated it at first, but grew on me as I got accustomed to the different taste. Definitely a unique brew that was a little misleading for me.","RollTide7","Feb 22, 2013"

I like the novelty of an 18% abv beer but it isn't something that I would pick up every year. I will cellar one to see how it changes.

The 90 minute IPA is my beer of choice. After having this, that has not changed. The biggest surprise from this beer is the sweetness. It is sweet like the Three Philosophers is sweet, with an IPA finish. Very interesting beer. Very tasty. I drank an entire 12 oz bottle to myself over a two hour period.

And for the love of all that is holy, DON'T DRINK ONE AND DRIVE!!! Just by volume, this beer (This batch) is equal to a little over 4 Bud Lights in alcohol, or 2 shots of Jagermeister. It can do things to you, most of which are nice, if you (as previously mentioned) don't have anything pressing to do. Great with a Don Collins Rum-Dipped Cigarillo (From Viejo San Juan, Puerto Rico.... Look them up online, order some of their cigars and RUM, and thank me later!), or some applewood smoked Jerk chicken. I love this beer. If you don't, you haven't had it yet.

Floral, citrusy...and oddly enough, there is a good amount of dark fruits. I'm picking up some raisins and figs. Sweet vanilla as well. Taste is...oh so boozy! I guess I was expecting this though. Sweet and boozy vanilla flavors with pine and citrus. Figs and raisins with some sweet apricot flavor. Hop flavor, but not very bittering. Burning, stinging floral flavors. Mouthfeel is full bodied. Drinkability is fair. Overall, this beer is very interesting. I've been longing to try this beer, and didn't go into it with very high expectations. It exceeded my expectations.

Flavor was pretty potent still for a beer a few years old. Very malt and hop forward. We both thought it was edging towards becoming a barleywine in terms of characteristics. Quite easy going down, so mouthfeel was good. Extremely tasty beer, but it's a tad hard to justify the pricetag.

And, the alcohol is well hidden for this level of ABV; so, it is also an easy drinking beer. It is well worth trying for hopheads and double IPA fans. This is a first class offering in the hyper competitive arena of big, hoppy beers.","Beer_Runner","Nov 17, 2012"

Drank slowly to enjoy all of the hoppy flavors we love coming at you larger than your normal hop experience. Pours with a nice mellow head and a deep shade of autumn color. Nose is sweet caramel and hops, with a definite presence of alcohol but to be expected. The taste is smoother than the aroma - while alcohol is present - it is not the first experience which is more sweet maybe a Belgian candy with floral to spicey hops present.

I bought 3 of these to try out. Interestingly, the first I drank straight from the bottle - which, honestly, I prefer 90% of the time. But my first Dogfish Head 120 I hated. I thought it was horrible, and actually hard to even finish. I compared it at the time to how kerosene might taste. But a few nights later I poured it into a frozen glass. Wow. I have no idea what makes it different, but it was. It went from horrible to great, and after drinking the last one I just wish I had more. Truly one of my favorite beers I've ever had. I found it to indeed have a bitter taste, but a very smooth and not overly hoppy bitter taste. Hard to explain. Also - as the glass and beer got warmer, it got even better. Don't hesitate to try this one. But - give it a chance. I often find good beer takes a while to "come around" and this was no exception. I don't know if this review will help you.

The smell are of strong hops, pine, obvious alcohol. The feel is medium to think, I can taste the alcohol right away. The taste is okay, a load of alcohol very noticeable, some burn, some hop bite but its overshadowed, a load of sweetness, this is different, pushes the boundaries of beer.","DavidST","Sep 13, 2012"

4.47,8.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Lets get right to it people. This beer stands as one of the most unique brews I have ever had. A colossal 18-21%abv, an IPA that scares most away, but the ones that dare to try it are truly amazed. I would say it may not be something that a stereotypical " hophead" would potentially enjoy, because it does not possess the bite of hops that one would expect. Don't get me wrong, the hops are certainly present and ready to drop nuclear bombs on your palate, but it is a smooth, maple syrupy texture/taste that really makes this beer excel. Not a hint of alcohol, some mild heat going down, no burn in the throat whatsoever. It is not even overwhelming in any fashion, which of course is a positive considering the ABV and how easily this venture could have gone horribly wrong. Smooth, maple syrupy and full of hops, this beer is simply excellent.","jsm1289","Aug 26, 2012"

4.13,0.5,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"DFH 120 appears to be slightly hazy, with a golden brown/amber hue. It's head is only a thin sliver, but it is quite sticky and frothy. There seems to be some light carbonation, as I see bubbles rising from the bottom of my ordinary glass. Ultimately, the appearance is very good. The aroma is 'roasty,' and spicy, although I pick up a lot of pineapple and bitter citrus hop notes as well. Curiously, it seems the brew has a malt backbone to it, along the obvious truckload of hops. Now for the taste- wow! First and foremost, It really knocks you over with the alcohol presence, very full body, and thick, syrupy mouth feel. I was right about the malts... believe it or not, there is a good amount of malt sweetness ever-present in the flavor. For the hops... these are the more 'piney' hops that come right in with the malts. With the ABV and body, it bites so hard it's almost like taking a sip of hard liquor. I'd almost say there is some balance here, but once the finish kicks in and the beer is down the hatch, the very, very dry, bitter hops do take over completely. Not that I mind, you see. I knew exactly what I was in for when I bought this. A real treat for hop heads, American strong ale fans, and if you age this one, I'd imagine you'd come out with something similar to a Barley-wine.

While it was a very great quality IPA, I have a hard time justifying buying a case of beer for over 40 dollars let alone 200, but I was given the opportunity to buy a bottle for 10 bones from a friend. One bottle had me feeling it. Very nice to sit with and sip on slowly. Should be served at a warmer temperature than most. Again, final regards are that this beer is very good but no where near worth what it is priced at. I'm pretty sure it's hand-bottled, which means that most of the money is just going to employees that haven't been replaced by machines yet. Good for the economy bad for my wallet.","DewTheBrew","Jul 26, 2012"

3.98,-3.2,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, 2012 D bottling(pretty fresh as my store got it in this week). Pours hazy golden orange color with a dense 1 finger off white head with very good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers, Pretty good lacing sticking to the glass, with plenty of alcohol legs as expected. Aromas of big pine, citrus rind, grass, lemon zest, grapefruit, honey, herbal, floral, earth, caramel, and a a bit of alcohol. Pretty nice aromas with some good balance and complexity. A lot less booze in the aromas than I expected; booziness seems to drop off a bit more as it reaches room temps. Taste of big citrus rind, lemon zest, pine, grapefruit, herbal, floral, honey, caramel, earth, and light herbal spiciness. Light amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus rind, grapefruit, pine, floral, caramel, honey, and light herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice hop flavor balance and complexity; with zero booze in the taste. Medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, oily, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Approaching syrup viscosity but it’s not a bad thing here; as the carbonation balances things out. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a warming noticed after the finish. Goes down impressively smoothly. Overall this is a damn nice DIPA given what this actually is in terms of the style. I was quite impressed how smooth this was; with a nice hop flavor balance and absolutely no cloying sweetness at all. I am beginning to wonder why everyone cries that this one is horrible fresh. This is very well done considering all of the insanely over the top brewing and dry hopping it takes to create this one. Really enjoyable.","superspak","Jul 15, 2012"

Grassy hops dominate upfront and transition into heavy sweet malt and then finishes with a piney bitterness and booze. Moderate carbonation is present with a heavy, syrupy body that coats the inside of the mouth. An extremely unique brew that is absolute alcohol bomb. Expect the heaviest malt backbone present in any IPA, which leads many to compare 120 Minute to barleywines rather than other IPA's. However the Dogfish Head IPA hop profile is plainly evident in this brew and this brew truly does remind me of an extreme version of 90 Minute IPA.","chanokokoro","Jun 17, 2012"

It recedes to a thick ring and a couple rocky islands of foam. The aroma is hoppy: grassy, citric, piney. Not actually as hoppy as I expected. There is also a light sweetness in the aroma. The first taste is floral bitterness, with a touch of malt. Next I get pine and syrupey flavors. As it leaves the palate, I get a touch of citrus and a lot of alcohol warmth. There is a flavor in this that I dislike, it's about 2/3 the way through, it seems medicinal but that may not be a perfect description. The mouthfeel is one of the thickest I've tred for an IPA, no suprise there, but the body is slightly lightened by a ticklish carbonation. This isn't exactly what I expected it to be, but that seems to be how DFH works, they make delicious things that make you scratch your head a bit.

But I don't think that's what Dogfish Head was going for when they made this. This is a good, interesting beer that crosses beer styles to sit with overall quality beers, instead of reigning in a certain niche. Sure, it's challenging to drink, but I like that a lot. I want something to stick out in beers I drink. This is certainly no session beer. This is one that you're going to fight with a little at first.

I'd say the ABV hits you more readily in the DFH Santo Palo Marron, which is only 2/3 of this brew's ABV.

The nose is very muted, no hop character whatsoever, malty with clear caramel malt character. Bready. Hint of abv. The taste is a disappointment. Immediately upon the palete is a strong alcohol heat, no hiding it. Strong and aggressive. Mildly bitter with a lot of bready malt, again little hops. Way to strong and sweet, unbalanced. Medium bodied and adequately carbonated. Overall, this is a boozy beer. Too expensive and not enjoyable. I will not be back.","hopfacebrew","Apr 13, 2012"

The aroma is very sweet and boozy, smelling more like a brandy then a beer. The taste, again, is closer to booze than beer. There's a little bit of hops, but it's really tastes a lot like brandy. I poured out some Remy VSOP to confirm my suspicions. Any way, it is still pretty good tasting, with just a bit of prickly hops on the backend, and plenty of sweetness and fruit on the front. The mouthfeel is thick with a decent level of carbonation. Overall, it's just too damn sweet without other dimensions to even it out.","shand","Apr 04, 2012"

4.22,2.7,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"As one of the reviewers below said, Dogfish head's 60 minute was one of the beers that turned me toward craft brews, and later, forever forsaking the NASCAR fair. Somehow, I'd missed the 120 minute until now. Among my beer loving friends, it has not been loved. Liked, perhaps, but nothing of the fan-fair I'd expect from a beer with even more (!) hops. I have come to find that it is in fact possible to over hop a beer. The 120 Minute was accused of this, and I echo the sentiment. That is not to say, by any means, that I don't enjoy the beer. I really like it and certainly recommend it. I'd even say it's come to enjoy a certain celebrity status, and perhaps should be tried at least once for that reason. But, lacking much else in complexity, this is a pure hopper, and it is strong. I've given this a slightly higher overall mark than I did for it's other sub-catagories, and I'd have to admit I'm not sure why. I can tell you two things though. The first is that this isn't complex; the smell is hoppy, so is the appearance and the taste, not much more needs to be said. The second is that I haven't had a good beer in a while, so having some type of quality round out my evening is a major plus, even if the hops are a bit smothering.","andrewm190","Mar 27, 2012"

Aromas are citric and floral hop, grapefruit, orange, pineapple, mango, with caramel and grainy malts. Tastes are complex with notes of sweet fresh pineapple, citrus, mango, grapefruit, caramel, and honey. It's sweet with a large amount of booze that is noticeable. I was surprised at the lack of bitterness on the finish - the sweetness rides right on through the finish. It goes down too easy for the enormous ABV, while being creamy, smooth, and full bodied. Towards the end as the ale warms, the alcohol gets hot. Overall, this was a treat I've wanted to try for some time, but never was at the right place at the right time. At $10 a bottle I probably wouldn't get it again, but definitely glad I finally got to try it!","barnzy78","Mar 16, 2012"

Its an experience, and I was glad I split the bottle, because I'm not sure I'd be able to finish it myself. A bit too boozy for me, but is interestingly balanced.

4.75,15.6,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Not the traditional IPA by any means. It poured a deep amber, and gave off a smell of solid alcohol, a step away from the usual flowery wave that comes with IPA's. Inhalation though was the real factor which gives this beer all of the esteem that Dogfish places behind it. First taste, is that of a very light IPA, after which it puts your taste buds into a race, firing flavor after flavor at you. The flavor reaches a peak about 10 seconds after you swallow, when it enters the final wave of a citrus. Don't look to this for a session, because the near 18% when mixed with the overall show-stopper stature of this brew puts all subsequent beers in a lower light. If you consider yourself an IPA person, than this should become your pride and joy, after you experience the complexity of the flavor which honestly is in a league of its' own.","StoutKing","Mar 02, 2012"

Really complex flavor profile, as you'd expect. Really hoppy, really malty and really boozy all at the same time. Citrus dominates the hop profile with sweet and tangy grapefruit and orange hops, but a bit of pine as well. No bitterness. Really sweet sticky malt. Caramel and even a bit of toffee, but it fades and the hops take over more the further into the beer you get. Then there is an overlying presence of alcohol throughout the entire flavor profile. It's quite tasty tho and doesn't overpower. Very viscous and sticky. It's a very complex and unique brew and definitely worth a try or 3.","uustal","Feb 29, 2012"

4.34,5.6,4,5,4,4,4.5,"Served on-tap and poured in a snifter, the beer is a bright, vibrant, hazy orange marmalade color with a frothy, dense, inch high head that is light tan in color and has very decent retention and cling. Aromas are a hophead's dream, with a blast of pine tassels and resiny, sticky, green fresh hops, balanced with a slight grapefruit citrus characteristic and subtle malt presence. Flavors are huge, and they explode the palate. Robust caramel malt backbone that is quickly surrounded by a roasted character that gives rise to the floral and resiny hops that abound. Wet, green, and heavy are the best descriptors I can give for the hops presence, with a slick, oily feel on the palate. The citrus from the aromas becomes much more subtle on the palate, being slightly absorbed into the malt presence and being somewhat overowered by the solid booze presence. Wow, this is a heavy hitter. The aftertaste is a rich tang of malt, with some peppery hops character making itself known. The finish is slick and rich, giving a slow recession off the palate. It really allows you to take it all in before the tongue recovers for another sip. This is a tasy brew!","GarthDanielson","Feb 21, 2012"

It may have been the heavy malt backbone that hid some of the hop flavor, but to me this was no more hoppy then their 90 min IPA. Taking price into consideration I would take 90 min IPA over this any day. The 120 was well worth a try and one to have very sparingly on special occasions.","Darkmagus82","Feb 20, 2012"

Piney and citrusy resin aromas burst from the tulip-shaped glass, with very noticeable hints of alcohol (nail polish) and a little earthiness. Super sweet brew, hints of honey, cherry, pinecone, citrus and alcohol. A chewy, big body with low amounts of carbonation becomes more complex and rewarding as it warms.

When I think DIPA, I automatically think of big, resinous, citrusy hop flavors, of which this ale doesn't really display all that many. The malt dominates this one, and while I would expect that of a Belgian quad or a Belgian strong dark ale, I would not expect that of an American DIPA.

Once in the glass, the aroma changes quite a bit however, with the resinous hops becoming more muted behind sweet fruit malts. The palate is thick and sticky, with intense hop character married to honey-sweet malts reminiscent of Madeira. As sweet as it is hoppy, this will not be to everyone’s taste, but there is almost no other way to support such a supersaturation of hops.

A spice like scent is created from the bready sugary malt meeting with the bold alcohol scent. So complex, the nose on this beer is insane. Caramalized fruit explodes on the tongue. Bold sugar meet grapefruits, tobacco, sweet fruits and subtle alcohol. Gigantic on body and feel, through the roof. Subtle and sweet despite the 18%, you only really feel the booze through the heat not in taste or on the nose. Overall; this beer is insane, its aggressive with hops, malts , alcohol and sugar.

But I don't think DFH's intention was to hit the mark. I really wished the hops played a bigger role in this beer. It was just a little sweet. However, as the beer warmed, I found it to be more enjoyable. I think some aging would do wonders for this beer. I'd say it's worth a try if you can get your hands on some.","Mahlik","Dec 03, 2011"

The smell is powerful, with tons of dark fruits, huge amounts of toffee, caramel, and just a hint of sticky malt. The flavors are so complex, reminds me more of an American take on a Barleywine than a Double IPA. Lots of caramel and toffee, mixed with a sweet cherry and Tropical Fruit Palate. Also noted are molasses and dark fruit resins, a rush of hops balanced it out nicely. A slight burn on the back of the throat from the ABV. Surprisingly drinkable for such a large ABV. The mouthfeel is rich and sweet, with a highly complex palate... albeit a smooth, oily texture to make for a nice end of the night brew. Excellent and VERY tasty! Love it!","beergod1","Nov 28, 2011"

3.65,-11.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured a slightly hazy orange brown, moderate amounts of retention and lace. Nose has loads of hops and citrus notes, mild pineapple among other things. Herbal notes, that I'm sure come as a result of the sheer amount of hops here. Some fusel alcohol. Massive malt base - caramel and toffee, some toasty malt notes as well. Taste has lots of resinous hop flavours, lightly toasty malts and sugary caramel and toffee notes. Chewy and sticky feel, but not extremely heavy. Ethanol and heat in the finish, fairly bitter but not palate shredding. Super sweet and rich overall, a sample of this was adequate. I wasn't terribly blown away with this, but this was certainly an experience.","liamt07","Nov 22, 2011"

4.57,11.2,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Smells coming from the bottle are deep caramel and molasses. Pours a dark brown with a one finger head that quickly recedes into a very patchy lace. Beer appears to be mildly carbonatedas there are some bubbles steadily rising to the surface of the glass. Beer has a very potent aroma of brown sugar that can be detected at quite a distance from the glass. Beer goes down smoothly for such a high abv. Slight alcohol burn followed by heavy sweetness and a touch of bitter hops. The mouthfeel is full but not as creamy as I had hoped, but seems to be appropiate for a sipping beer of this strength. Every sip of this beer I take I grow to like the beer more. At this age of a bottle it has matured into a lovely very large barleywine and is would sit well with those looking for a very sweet and balanced barleywine that hides it's abv very well. If I hadn't known it was 18% I would have guessed it to be around 12%. Have not had this beer fresh, but would imagine it to be an animal of a beer. Looking forward to getting a fresh bottle and doing a side-by-side tasting. Overall I feel this beer is a well put together barlewine/IIPA that does what it says on the side of the bottle, (ages well.) Would give it a 4.5 out of 5 and will purchase again.","bebbcorp","Nov 20, 2011"

4.08,-0.7,3.5,4.25,4,4,4.25,"Pours a lovely golden color, see through and clear. No retention to speak of and the head dissipated fairly quickly. Aroma is boozy which resides to the large sweet malty body. Aggressive hopping also allows a large pineyness and earthy/resinous dominance on the aroma. The taste is a balance of three extremes. Those of hops, alcohol, and sweetness. For me these three meet a middleground which I found very complex and satisfying. Alcohol on the palette is detectable but the sweetness and hop flavor and bitterness mingle and make it not hot. Huge pine resinous type flavor with a little citrus. Honey and caramel-like flavors balance with the huge over the top hoppiness. The beer is full bodied and a little syrupy. Carbonation is good. The mouthfeel does not get in the way of enjoying this beer, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this. Overall, I love this beer. The balance of the extremes is very impressive. This beer is not for everyone, but for hopheads with a sense of adventure you will love this.","ShemRahBoo","Nov 15, 2011"

Rich toasted caramel malts and a large overlay of Booze. Pungent. The first couple sips very surprisingly smooth. Creamy caramel, toasted Portuguese bread. Hops aren't overly bitter. A dark fruity character upfront and a pine sap finish. As it warms up the booze really starts to come through. The malt flavors start to become syrupy medicine halfway through the glass.

The smell is great. Like sticking your face in a bushel of hops. At first the taste is a little much. Extreme sweet hops with alcohol. Once your taste buds recover the sweet, juciy hoppiness takes the stage with some oak and citrus making an appearance. Mouthfeel is medium, not as heavy as you'd expect from something this big.

I bought three bottles in giddiness because DFH was the beer that got me into craft brews and ever since i have been looking for this. Well, 3 years down the line and with complete palate change i am still pretty impressed with this. Is it very sweet and malty? yes. Is it a hop heads dream? absolutely not.

3.85,-6.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Bottle poured into a Chimay Goblet. The beer pours a copper color with a quickly dispersing head. Beer is slightly cloudy but enough only to barely notice. I am surprised honestly at how bitter this beer is but with only how lightly the scent of hops emanates from it. If I had smelled this not knowing what it was, it could be a normal pale ale. Taking a sip however immediately changes your taste buds. There is a lot of malt, backed by a generous hop flavors, and a sweet finish. This is a completely different style of DIPA from say a Stone Ruination. I would say there is almost an element of a Barleywine in this brew. The ABV of 18% is not too severe on the palate, and this bottle is a 2011 release. The beer gets more fragrant, complex, and flavorful as the beer warms into the low 60 degree F range. It will warm on you too, as the abv and the sheer style of the beer makes this a sipper, rather than a session beer. I had to keep readjusting the smell score as it kept changing as the beer warmed. My final thoughts: I like this beer, is it something I would pay to have on a regular basis? No, not even if I could, as in CT this is rather a PITA to find. But it is an enjoyable treat that is definitely different than many of the throw as many hops in as possible style DIPA's.","bornridiculous","Oct 25, 2011"

More reminiscent of Olde School than WWS. Not alot of carbonation. Boozey and somewhat bitter near the end with a bit of a raisins. This is the freshest I have had this and I thought the aged ones tasted like someone dropped a shot of vodka into a 90min. Fresh, however, this beer has more of a different taste to it.

This is like...a liqueur. The mouthfeel is very syrupy. This is thick as sin. Again, it's more like a cordial. Ironically, this has more burn to it than liquors of the same ABV. Craziness.

First taste is a strong IPA, not my favorite style in general but it’s very hoppy and has a nice bitter taste to it. Defiantly some pine flavors and I can smell and taste the hops. Then the alcohol hits and burns the back of my mouth. While I’m glad I got to try this one, between the lasting alcohol flavor that lingers far longer than the actual IPA taste, and the price tag of 9.99 or so, it’s not something I would drink a lot or buy except to try maybe once a year if that.","codysjb","Oct 14, 2011"

The nose comprises heavy pine resin, mentholated honeydew, rich caramel, and a hardy backbone of alcohol. The taste brings in much of the same, with everything taken to the nth degree. Honestly, it's all a bit much when put together like this. The body is a heavy-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a nearly chewy, syrupy feel. Overall, what could have been a decent DIPA is hindered by what I can only call too much girth and presence.

Baking spices along with spiced apple pastry, rich oloroso sherry, currant and booze soaked raisins and a touch of figs as well. Very nice complex nose definitely more fortified wine than beer. The taste brings sweet barleywine like malts with enough alcohol to wash it away - i might be able to tell the abv is this high but it is so well balanced it never comes across as hot.

Extremely pungent citrus hop aroma, complemented by hints of caramel, toffee, molasses, toast, and vanilla. Taste is very sweet up front, probably less sweet than you might imagine.

They offered 4 oz. samples of the beer which sounds about perfect to me; halfway through the glass it got kind of rough. I'd have it again, but would want to keep it to the 2 or 4 oz. pours.

On the tongue the alcohol is a little less, but I was definitely overwhelmed by the warmth of it. Lots of caramel and malt with a small bit of citrus hops, but barely.

Surprsingly this beer is much less hop-forward than even the 60 minute, never mind the 90 minute, and it is also much sweeter and has way more of a noticeable alcohol character. I have also heard about as many positive reviews as I have negative. I have a feeling that many of the negative reviews are due to the fact that most expect it to be a hop-bomb that completely blows away 90 minute ipa...this is far from the case, but it is definitely a great beer that it worthy of the hype...I just wish it was easier to access. If I had to compare this to another beer in terms of similarities...none really come to mind, but this beer is more similar to a Belgian Tripel or even a Barleywine (sweeter styles)...definitely not comparable to any other DIPAs.

Smells like big hop oils, with that signature DFH sweetness and the most uncanny Chinese Orange chicken sauce aroma (and I mean that in a good way). Taste is huge, perhaps too huge. Big bitterness from the hops that brings out a dirty, earthy orange rind character and heavily boiled hop essence followed by cloying molasses sweetness and a finish on the tongue that's somewhere between an evaporating shot of liquor and a light and fizzy cane sugar soda. This beer, especially if you plan to drink the whole bottle, is a big-time sipper, so don't expect to finish a glass within a matter of a mere few minutes.

The flavor carries the aroma's torch, with an addition of a modicum of actual piney hoppiness, which is impressive given the circumstances.

Poured into my dfh snifter, shared with a good friend. Pours a MURKY dark dark orange, bordering on brown color. Completely opaque. Smell- buttery, sugary, some vinegar, spice, apple. Wow. A lot going on here. Taste- some astringency, a warm buttery flavor, sweet apple. Almost a tart type finish- This is very very complex. So much going on in this beer. Mouthfeel- it has lost a lot of its carbonation, but you don't even miss it here. Something about the crisp tart finish of the beer doesn't even make you think about the potential flatness of the beer. Drinkability- especially improves as it warms. Came out of my cellar at 55 degrees, and didn't really reveal itself fully until almost an hour passed. This is an epic beer....and truly demonstrates why you age beer and what it can do. My final thought is that this should be classified as an old ale after a few years...very hard to consider it part of the IPA family.","lnashsig","May 29, 2011"

Light head with a bit of lacing. Lots of grapefruit, sweet orange, and fresh bread, a bit of piney hops on the nose. Velvety mouthfeel. Just a bit of bite on the front of the tongue, quickly disappears into a very grapefruity, sweet citrus, and a bit of herbal hops. Very surprisingly, the hops are not obnoxiously overdone. The peppery alcohol is very dominant, but the 21% is VERY well hidden. Bitterness of cooked apple on the finish. This was one of my first extreme beers and one I had to shell out big bucks for.

Smell is almost fusel alcohol and intense sugary. The smell is essentially not good. The taste, however, is sublime. Sweet like an aged American Barleywine with faded hops in the middle the finishes with slight bitterness. There is an almost bready sweetness present throughout that I don't find cloying and somehow seems in balance with the rest of the beer. Great mouthfeel, with good carbonation and that thickness the beer essentially has to posses. Makes a wonderfully smooth sipper - very drinkable for the alcohol content.","seeswo","Jan 12, 2011"

Smell is lots of malt and a decent amount hops but not as much as you would expect. There is an alcohol/solvent/cleaning fluid facet as well. Lots of pine. Taste is not for the faint of heart. Super sweet malt and syrup. A large fruit flavor dominates. Orange really. Huge amount of hops to keep it in check and still it is more sweet than bitter. Having said that the finish is entirely owned by the buds. Super clean and dry with enough hop oil to hack through the high gravity sugars. Mostly pine in nature there is just enough grapefruit to cut and dry your mouth so you keep coming back. Feel is just short of thick and chewy. It is surprisingly close to your run of the mill DIPA. Carbonation is lively and right where you want it. Any more and the flavors get out of control any less and you are drinking syrup from the bottle. Drinkability is much better than it should be.

Nice lacing on the glass. Smells like caramel, slight hops and warm alcohol. Very thick mouthfeel that brought forth a sweet caramel and brown sugar taste. There is a faint hop presence that hags out in the cheeks and sides of the tongue. Very complex each sip gave way to new flavours. I have to say it was much sweeter than I thought it would be, but still one of the best I have tried.

The flavor is very sweet and syrupy- somewhat too sweet to be very drinkable. Surprisingly enough there is almost no taste of alcohol or hops- the sugary sweetness of this brew masks everything else.

Raisin, plum, sweet malts and the alcohol burn completely overpowered any hops for me. Mouthfeel is relatively heavy, creamy, and very syrupy. This is much too sweet and boozy for me.

The beer itself is a fiery orange amber that looks dangerous. The aroma tells me this must be a pretty fresh bottle. It is malty for sure, but I am able to pick out a nice orange, grapefruit, apricot and sweet flowery hop bouquet as well. I've had this beer several times, and every time I seem to take something different away from the experience. It is extremely sweet with a very sugar cookie like pale malt profile. The hops are much less prominent than in the aroma, but I am still detecting the classic "minute" hop profile that this shares with its smaller siblings. Candied orange, apricot, pine and cidery sweetness. If this was a hoppy barley wine, it would be great, but for a triple IPA, not quite enough punch. If the ABV was toned down a bit I think this would be a real winner through and through. The body is full and thick, fairly syrupy really, with a finish that is a bit on the sticky icky side, but could be much worse. I just realized that I keep having to remind myself that this thing has a near 20% ABV. It is hot without a doubt, but not as hot as one would expect. This is a sipper and not all that drinkable, but I always welcome the chance to share a bottle with a friend.","zoso1967","Jul 08, 2010"

I've read (on the internet and on the bottle itself) that this beer ages particularly well. Most IPAs I try to drink as fresh as possible, but this could be an exception. If there is a way to bring out the complexities of this brew, and a way to tame it a bit, then that's exactly what I want to do. Simpler than its ultra-strong DFH counterpart, World Wide Stout, it's not so elusive to me; it doesn't hide behind anything.

And it stays good the whole time while leaving nice lacing. Very surprising for the alcohol content. Color of the head is off-white, somewhat yellow almost. Some dusty sediment as well. Booze is quite up-front in the nose, also getting hops and grapefruit. Taste is better than I thought it would be, first thing I notice is the alcohol is very well-hidden (I think this batch was 21%). It's there, but I would've guessed 12 or 13%. Malts are definitely overpowering the hops. It is very sweet, but not overly so. The main tastes I can get are grapefruit, vanilla, it has a liquor-like presence, almost like thick scotch or rum. Bready and boozy in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is good overall, but the syrupy-ness, sweetness and booze starts to get to you after a while. Drinkability is obviously low, for those reasons, who would drink 2 of these anyway? I've never had this fresh but I'd say age did this beer some good. I liked it much more than I thought it would.

Citrus oils and solvents are upfront, huge bread crust malts follow, with all I can describe as hop fuel. it is really just hops all the way, and not in a way I have encountered before. Upon first taste, I was unprepared for the experience, and let the beer sit for a while longer. I poured a 4 oz sample, and that was more than enough at first. Straight up hops, tonnes of citric pithy flavours, some fuesel components, orangey malts, very alcoholic. The hops here are an all out pine blast. Like eating pure pine needle extract. This is so intense that I had to drink it over 2 days, 3 servings. This is a boozey hop fest in the mouth. Not for the beginner or faint of heart. This is a sipper, and I think this one should be aged for a few years to really let the intensity become a bit more well rounded. Overall, it has huge alcoholic and pine notes in the finish, syrupy and sweet. An experience I will remember for sure. A good beer, but perhaps a little too intense for everyday enjoyment. Certainly a treat! Thanks again Eric!","mrmanning","Feb 14, 2010"

The taste is overwhelmingly hops, hops and more hops. They take on a sweet apricot flavor that I really like. The body is full and rich. Sweet like candy and subtly strong.

Some spotty strands of lacing revealed on the tilt side of the glass. Huge, malty nose, definitely reminiscent of a barleywine. Lots of dark fruit (i.e. plums and prunes) and breadiness, with a suggestion of citrus acidity in the mix. Taste consistent with nose - wow, this is a total malt bomb; also getting some brown sugar and molasses in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, with a light, smooth background carbonation and a slightly oily quality. This is a pretty decadent treat.

This would be an amazing brew if the alcohol calmed down, maybe a year or two in the cellar will do the trick. The label states that it is the holy grail for hopheads.

Quite a bit of lace initially brought on by the head. Malt/sweet monster of a beer. Huge alcohol astringency and punch. Feel is very syrup-like. Warming finish. You can taste the carmalization of the sugar in this beer as well as smell it through the hops. The spice of the hops is very enjoyable in a very earthy way, not the usual hop bomb grapefruit attack of citrus. Much more sweet than I expected and the hops are not playing the bitterness roll that I thought they would. Very enjoyable. Can't wait to have my next one of these.","stakem","Nov 12, 2009"

(It has a nice, amber color, but a scant head.) Though I haven't tasted Southern Comfort in decades, it reminded me of that. It's drinkable, and it masks its alcohol content quite well until the dwindling aftertaste. This beer lives in the twilight zone between the beer/wine abv's and the hard liquor abv's.

3.26,-20.7,4,3,3.5,4,2.5,"Pours a nice and clear burnt golden orange, the last little bit of the pour provides a nice cloud of haze that falls through, and then clears up nicely. The head is moderate, but I mean, it's got to be hard to carbonate a beer this high in alcohol, leaves minimal lacing. But it actually looks nice. The smell is primarily peachy alcohol, some raw sugary smells, a bit of raisins and dates, a tiny bit of esters, maybe some tart cherries, a tiny bit of spice, and a sweet, syrupy maltiness. The taste is kind of interesting, like bread pudding, maybe french toast, soaked in rum, with raisins, dates, plums, cherries, etc., just like a syrupy, sweet, kind of malty, bready burst. Just huge on flavor, a bit of esters, some light tart cherry hoppiness, nice, but not as much hoppiness as you would expect from 120 minutes of hopping and 30 days of dry hopping. But the alcohol rules this one for the most part. Not my favorite thing in beer, but actually, for the ABV, this one seems like much less than it actually is. And surprising, a lot less syrupy than even some other DFH beers. It actually does a nice job finding the balance between dry and sweet. Very good. Light carbonation, and any burn provided is upstaged by alcohol burn. The drinkability, well it speaks for itself. It took me well over half and hour to finish 4-5 oz, and I can say that the last 5 or 6 sips will probably take me another 10-15 minutes. Very slow drinking. But overall, an interesting beer, though for the amount of stuff that goes into it, it has a few less dimensions that I would expect. Not an everyday drink, maybe not even possibly a once a year thing for me. But it's worth the experience I'd say.","taylorhamrick","Jul 20, 2009"

Due to the extremely high alcohol content I was expecting the head to be minimal at best, and am very pleasantly surprised. The aroma is very hoppy with lots of pine and citrus. There is a lot of malt too, but it is soft and easily takes a back seat to the hops. The alcohol is present in the terms of adding a slight cough syrup note. It is, however, a lot more subdued than I expected, and I like that. The taste has a bite...wow. There is more malt here with an almost mead like honey character. The citrus, and pine from the aroma are present, but the malt masks the bitterness which I'm sure is in there somewhere. The mouthfeel is full bodied with appropriately low carbonation, and a silky texture. Overall, this is a very interesting beer, and huge kudos go out to DFH for dreaming it up. I certainly couldn't drink this every day, or even every month. But I'm could picture myself sipping this down two or three times a year, and thoroughly enjoying it.","KarlHungus","Jul 17, 2009"

Aroma is strong, hoppy, and surprisingly fruity - the orange and hop aromas battle for dominance, so one whiff is hoppy while the next is of orange. It pours a hazy orange-amber with a fairly thick and rather persistent white head. Flavor is richly orange and a little sweet with a firm hoppy but only slightly bitter hop undertone.

Smell is intense of piney hops, citrus, sweetness, and alcohol. It almost smells like some sort of sweet, hard candy. Taste is similar. Strong, sweet, intense malt. Some caramel, candi sugar, and just general sweetness. A little bit of pineapple and/or general citric hops as it hits the back of the palate. Alcohol and a very warming/burning sensation as it goes down. Thick and creamy mouthfeel that I really enjoyed, somewhat velvety. Overall a drinkable beer in the sense that it is possible to drink this and enjoy it. Not drinkable in the sense of, "lets get a 6'er and slam it."

However, at 10% abv higher than the best DIPA in the world (Pliny the Younger, in my experience), I was expecting some sort of extreme flavor or something otherwise outlandish. The mouthfeel isn't even as thick as many a much lower proof barleywine. At any rate, the beer is a fairly thick golden liquid with a good head. The hops dominate with a citric-orange flavor, but the malt isn't terribly far behind with an excellent caramel sweetness. The beer is fairly sweet but, shockingly, never cloyingly so.

The taste is a complex mix of mostly sweet alcohol - brown sugar and molasses - but then there is a surprisingly subtle underlying hop bitterness that holds it together and really keeps things interesting. The hops come through more as the beer warms. Medium body with very little carbonation and a nice oiliness.

I can tell that it's got a good amount of hops, but it has none of the bitterness or astringency I associate with traditional hop-bombs. The fruity-citrusy flavor predominates, with a complex mouthfeel that is smooth, sweet, rich and hoppy all at the same time. The alcohol is incredibly well hidden; if I had not read this beers reviews I would never have guessed the ABV.

4.4,7.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours an opaque, deep-orange with a small off-white head. I can smell the floral and citrus aromas with the beer sitting on the desk next to me. The first smell is full of bright-orange aromas coupled with a sharp alcohol bite. A light floral note sneaks through the back, screaming of some crazy-hop infusion. I can tell it's bitter, but the smell isn't really letting that lose. It's more sweet, citrusy, and floral than it is outright bitter hoppy. I know those aromas are in fact derived from the hops, but it's different than I would have expected. The first sip is significantly less intense than I expected. The citrus bite hits right up front, mostly citrus zest, with a larger emphasis placed on orange than lemon. The ABV, all 21.00% of it hits the tongue at the same time as a slightly grassy hop note, burning just a little bit on the tongue before the swallow. A pronounced burning hits the throat, but it's by no means harsh, just a general sense of warm. A mild sweetness cuts under everything, brightening the beer up just a touch. After a few more sips, the citrus flavor becomes a little sweeter, more reminiscent of a real orange than the zest. The alcohol picks up a bit as well, warming and biting harder than it did earlier. After a little warming, this thing picks up some serious power. The hops still don't carry too much of a bitter taste, but they certainly make up for it with the insane amount of floral and citrus notes that come into play. The alcohol hits the same way, strong, intense, and delightful. There's a subtlety here that is lost in other DIPAs, Southern Tier Hoppe comes to mind. Somehow, with almost twice the alcohol, it tastes less like vodka and more like a damn fine beer. Quality all around. I'm looking forward to Black and Tanning this with World Wide Stout. It should be an exercise in ludicrousness. The overall profile is a little unbalanced for my taste, but not enough so to really hurt this thing. It's over-the-top, but deliberately so.

And, frankly, I don't see how it can be considered an IPA; sweet with a noticeable lack of hoppiness.

Some of those big Suzuki Burgman and Honda Silverwing scooters are 650ccs and cost close to 10 grand... then, what's the point? Why not just buy a motorcycle? If you want to pay upwards of $10 for 12 oz of something boozy, why not just pick up a good single malt or a good upscale bourbon? I understand that this is not distilled, but there comes a point when beer really isn't beer any more.

Every Hop Head should try it once...OK twice","GCGrant","Feb 03, 2009"

It's more like a port in terms of the sweetness, but the flavors are all over the place with a nice focus in the hops, with a slightly bitter finishing bite that regresses back to sweetness. The hops flavor doesn't stay long though because of the extreme alcohol. The flavor endures for a good 30 seconds after swallowing this beast with all sorts of sweet fruity goodness.

I guess I didn't know what to expect from a 21% beer, but I was at least expecting somewhat of an IPA taste. This tasted like a really strong, bitter, slightly carbonated wine. In my opinion, no resemblance whatsoever. I would probably have rated this beer higher if I knew what I was in for when I tried it for the first time. I would definitely say its worth picking up, but do not do so on the shear fact that you like 60 and 90 minutes as there is almost no similarities other than the name. If you like barley wines, definitely pick one up and try it. If you are a big IPA fan and are looking for a new imperial IPA to try, heads up, grab a bear republic, stone ruination, a 90 min, or something else. Only available in 12oz singles, my suggestion is that if you havn't had this yet, split it with one other person and/or pour it into a wine glass. The 25-27% ABV Sam Adams Utopias is normally poured in 2oz and this seems like beer that is best in small servings. I poured this into a pint glass and drank the whole thing and when I buy this again I am just pouring it into a small drink/wine glass and drinking a little at a time.

Indeed, there is a ton of malt in the smell and flavor, but it is (somehow) balanced quite impressively, that is, while working on this scale, with hop. It doesn't look the way I thought it might look (its a very cark, cloudy copper/orange). It smells very strongly of both hop and malt, moreso than even the 60 min IPA's malt aroma. The taste has a lot of hoppy tree/forest-like essence right behind an upfront flavor of dark cherries and raisen sweetness. The mouth isn't nearly as heavy as I was expecting, aside from the somewhat-extreme taste, its ABV isn't so noticeable in the mouthfeel. It is a little syrupy, however.Drinkability is a hard one to determine... on one hand, it's pretty extreme in aroma, flavor, etc. And, of course, its over 20% alcohol (and, I believe, something like 500 calories according to the DFH website). However, it definetely gains points for not being really that difficult to get thru or swallow. Its really good.

4.32,5.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"My bottle is the latest batch to come out as it was bottle 7/7/08. Poured into a snifter because I was told this batch was maltier than the usual so I figured I would go with that instead of a winge glass or tulip. Poured a cloudy auburn with gold tints that gave one-finger head that stuck around forever and left a slight lace ring. A complex array of sweet malts like caramel, butterscotch and maybe honey or something. Also in the nose is a great hop presenece that brings both citric fruit notes (lemon) and some tart and dark fruits like sour apples, pear and a little black cherry. My first instinct when trying this is that it would be a "hopbomb", and it VERY hoppy, there is a thickness and stickiness to it from the sweet malts (mostly caramel in this regard). There is also tart and citric fruit tastes in this fuller-bodied beer that rolls across the tongue for the most part (like I said, a tad sticky at some points). The only drawback is a very minor alcohol burn on the backbite which stems from the immense ABV%. For that reason (the ABV, not the burn) and the cost (I'm not rich) prevent me from sessioning this bad boy. This reminded me a of Belgian Triple and maybe a heavy Dubbel, and is one of the best beers I've had in a long, long time. If you haven't tried the current batch I recommend so immediately.","clayrock81","Aug 14, 2008"

The smell is amazing: hops, hops, and plenty of booze hit the nose square as the beer is held. One can open a bottle of this in a wide room and everyone will smell it without putting it up to their nose. Slight vanilla undertones to the massive floral hop notes in the nose of this beer. Also, slightly sweet in the nose, I'm not sure how to describe it, but the beer is definitely not all hops. The taste is I feel described above: massively hoppy and boozy, yet strangely tempered into a hazy brew, easy to drink. Mouthfeel is actually a big thin; makes me wonder what they left out of this beer. Probably nothing; probably I'm a Russian Imperial Snob, but for such a heavy duty beer I was a bit dissapointed.

Amazing sweet smell of white grape juice and figs. Sweet tastes of honey and maybe a little raisin or fig in there as well. This beer feels like it's just melting in you're mouth with all of the fine carbonation. I didn't even notice the hops at all until the end where I detected a mild hop bitterness.

On first sip you get a very up front spicey alchol induced fuzzy feel all over the mouth. Big notes of citrus rind, rum soaked pears and syrupy sweetness. At 21% alchol this is a bottle best shared but if you have it to yourself sip it all night long. The hop profile is very subdued by the alchol but it is there, mostly on the end of the palate.

Lacing is actually on the glass even with the high alcohol. Very slight 90 minute comparisons, the alcohol is really overpowering taste and smell. Almost done and I think my tongue is dead, I could drink another at this point (though, no need too.) Drinkability got better as I neared the end on this bottle.

There are very few beers of this magnitude around, which doesn't necessarily make it a great beer, but it's hella fun nonetheless. Pours reddish-brown with a one-finger, thick off-white head. Spotty streaks of lacing are left behind. I'm very surprised that the aroma up front was big on the malts and caramel and not a hop attack. Oddly enough, the alcohol and hops are barely discernible to the nose. Taste of sweet raisins and malts in the beginning, then the hops and alcohol heat kick in toward the end. The caramel sweetness covers up the alcohol heat pretty well, but there is some true bitter complexity to the whole experience. Mouth-feel is rich, almost creamy at times. It's full-bodied and carbonation is decent with some bubbly activity throughout. I'll have say beers like this definitely have their place in the beer world, and it's awesome seeing people experimenting and pushing boundaries.

Don't get me wrong the body was very big but very well balanced nonetheless. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of spicy, piny, juicy hops. This is balanced with a nice malty sweetness and maybe some apricot fruitness too. A good boozey aftertaste tags along in the aftertaste.

The mouthfeel is full bodied and very syruppy with a soft carbonation and an alcoholic finish. The bottle says "enjoy now or age for a decade or so." The bottled on date was not entirely readable, but appeared to be in 06. My impression is that this is a beer that really needs to age to mellow. The flavor is nearly overpoweringly sweet . Almost like artificial sweetener mixed with cough syrup. I would definitely not buy this again, especially at its very high price. Not sure what everyone sees in this one, and I sort of wonder if I got a bad bottle, but I won't be trying it again to find out.

So strong it is just not very refreshing and the hops ratio is so overpowering that it obliterates the palate so that every other IPA you try within the next few hours tastes like a pilsner! Looks fantastic though and smells like heaven. Strangely, I was getting faint vinegar notes in the times I have tasted this beer. I applaud DFH for taking this style to the limit though! Just not for me. 90 Minute through the Randall is my ultimate DFH choice.","Hoppington","Jan 06, 2008"

Extremely sweet on the palate, huge alcohol hits immediately (think schnapps). Lots of honey and peach flavors at first, with caramel and candy, followed closely by the huge citrus hop kick. Not overwhelmingly hoppy as would have expected, much more dominant malt sweetness, but still the hops resonate. This beer is every flavor of a great IPA amplified by 10. Alcohol warms the throat and stomach. The mouthfeel is all syrup and slick. Drinkability? Considering the 21%, very.

3.93,-4.4,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"I picked up a 12 ounce bottle at Walnut Liquorette (for $13). The color is dark yellow to light orange as it pours into the glass and clear medium orange in the glass with a modest, fluffy head that sticks to the glass, leaving a dense lacing as the beer drains away. The smell is surprisingly sweet and suprisingly mildly hoppy with an earthy background. The mouthfeel is sticky (which I like) and the taste is sugary sweet with a much subtler hoppiness (at first) than I expected. As the beer warms a bit, more hoppiness comes out in the smell and the flavor. But still, this is definitely not in the mold of a CA-style IPA or DIPA (I don't mean that as a complaint, just a comparison). I suppose the hopping is more nuanced, but with my (non-super taster) palate and frame of reference, I'm afraid some of that nuance may be lost on me. For me, the sugary sweetness is most noticeable; and due to it, I couldn't drink a whole lot of this beer in one sitting.","PhiloPsych","Jan 03, 2008"
3.85,-6.3,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Bottle with just a bit of age on it -- almost a year (bottled January 2007, opened 1/1/08) -- that I'm comparing to a much newer bottle (two months) from the newest batch of 120. Pours with excellent clarity and a small, yellowish head that fades to a collar on top of a dark amber body with some nice darker-brown "highlights". The nose is nicely balanced between the hops, which display a fine-grained, metallic grittiness (think 300 sandpaper) and the malts, which give off a honey graham note. On the palate, the sweetness of the malts and the bitterness of the hops are far more well-integrated than in younger bottles. Nice fruitiness that's hard to put a name to -- it's halfway between citrus, berry and tropical fruits -- comes out at the mid-palate. The finish sweetens significantly but somehow ends with hop dryness. Mouthfeel is improved with age, but still shows a lot of hotness throughout the palate. It's expected with a 21% ABV beer, but it's still distracting. Overall, 120 is much better with a year of age on it. The flavors play much better together, the sweetness is toned down a bit, and the hop astringency is gone. I would guess that 18 to 24 months would be the perfect age at which to drink this beer.","geexploitation","Jan 01, 2008"

The smell is alcohol, hops and sweet malt, under-attenuated sweet malt anyway, in that order, it is more like a liquor than beer, without the hops I wouldn't call it a beer by smell. The taste is very much the same as the smell however I'd call it fairly mild in comparison to some of the other extreme beers that I've had. Sure the alcohol is very noticeable, but it isn't overpowering, the sweetness tends to build but doesn't become cloying and there is enough of a hop presence to keep things in check and balance the sweetness, which is one of the places that World Wide Stout by dogfish fails. Mouthfeel is good rich full warming, peppery due to the alcohol and it leaves a residual sweetness and wine like drying sensation that is quite pleasant. Drinkability is ok but not very good, come on this almost isn't beer, definitely a sipper make sure you have no where to go for a while after you order one of these but worth every penny when sampled on draft, if you've only had it in the bottle, seek it out on tap!","fank2788","Nov 29, 2007"

Hops and malt are both present in the aroma, as is a bit of fruitiness and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is downright thick. The flavor is very sweet, almost syrupy, followed by alcohol in the end. You can pick up hops and malt in the flavor, but this is not the hop bomb many might imagine. This is a sipper, the alcohol is definitely noticeable. Not something I would drink on a regular basis, but definitely worth a try.","Drew966","Aug 26, 2007"

The malt is super sweet and smoky. The malt seems to outweigh the hop bitterness in my opinion, leaving this ale a little too sweet. Despite this perceived flaw this is still an excellent beer that any IPA lover should try at least once. The drinkability is low given the extreme flavor and alcohol percent. I would recommend sharing a 12 oz serving between two people. After half of this beer my taste buds felt numb and burnt out.

I have a few 12 oz. bottles of the stuff, but I have been reluctant to open them without cellaring for a while. The beer was a dark, tawny orange with a frothy tan head that subsided kind of quickly and smelled of amber and pale malts with a layered hop character. The taste was arresting and beautiful. Caramel-y and hoppy, this is the way a Double IPA should be. It wasn't a brutal and bitter hop slap in the face the way you'd expect something boiled with hops for 2 hours and then dry-hopped for a month to be, the malts came through excellently; it was amazingly well-balanced from the hops and malts to the different varieties of hops in there.

3.73,-9.2,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"The appearance was burnt orange with a sticky lacing that hugged the glass leaving little room for a great head. 120 minute had a very sweet and tropical smell while the alcohol was surprisingly not too noticeable for a beer at 20% ABV (Alcohol By Volume). The first taste brought a punch of caramel which flowed into a tropical fruit much like a pineapple then finishing quickly with hops. I expected this to be intensely hoppy but it yielded an overpoweringly sweet, thick and syrupy taste and mouthfeel with an astonishing hop balance. This DIPA (Double India Pale Ale) is definitely a sipper; very thick and heavy with little carbonation and high alcohol. Although the price seemed quite steep, one could justify it in ratio (ABV/price) to wine. The 120 minute term refers to the full two hour boil of high-alpha American hops. In addition to the full two hour boil, DFH radically dry-hops the fermenter daily for a month and then ages the brew for another month on whole-leaf hops!

The owner was more than happy to sell it all to me since no one else in this neighborhood was buying them. The beer poured a hazy amber/orange color with a rather large half inch head that receded quickly. The aroma was very malty and alcoholic, with the hops hidden in there somewhere. Where are the hops? Taste was hot alcohol, extremely sweet honeyish malts and citrusy hops. The longer I sipped on it though, the hops became overwhelmed by the massive sweetness. I was expecting a hopsmack in the face and instead got kicked in the balls with an un-Godly amount of malt. Mouthfeel was very thick and sticky in the palate. One 12 oz bottle is all I can handle.

I wish it were less sweet so the bitterness and hop flavor could come out to play. I love this beer and its a great sipper after dinner but I want more out of it. I know I am asking a lot since DFH puts so much into it but a man can dream. The most impressive thing about this beer is its smoothness.

The hops come in at the finish, with some citrus flavors and just a slight presence of alcohol. Feel is slick and heavy. Viscosity reminiscent of liquor. This is a sipper for sure.

The aroma starts strong with a bitterness suggesting grapefruit, very crisp. Give it a little longer and there's a hint of sweetness, cherry perhaps. The appearance is a beautiful golden brown with plenty of floating goodies suspended evenly throughout. The first roll onto the tongue is startlingly thick and sweet. Tangy at the tip of the tongue and a heavy apricot rolls to the back of your mouth. This is strong stuff and proves itself quickly as it warms its way to your belly. By the third or fourth swallow you feel like your mouth has been converted to a new level of thinking and the dark cherry bitter-sweetness reveals itself with authority. This is obviously quality stuff but probably a bit too much ale for my palate. It stays tasteful at the front but overwhelms me a bit at the finish. I added a little mild cheddar cheese to this taste experience which was a nice pairing, but for me this definitely demands thoughtful sipping. It definitely holds its carbonation as ten minutes into this glass the head looks as good as it did a minute after the pour and the bubles still sizzle on the tongue. There is some degree of an oak overtone here as the flavor matures over the long haul. But this is still some strong stuff, I imagine somewhat an acquired taste for most. Taking it slowly I found that as it went closer to room temperature it seemed a bit tamer to the tongue, more manageable so to speak. I will need to try this again, hard for me to rate as a relative neophyte. But it is quite a taste sensation and a heavy brew to ponder! This won't be my favorite Dogfish brew but I have good faith that it is another quality offering for those fans of this variety. However you shake it, it is impressive.

Given that this is four years old, I think I would prefer a fresher version that has more hop presence. The sweet malts are just too much in the aged bottle. There is some bitterness on the tail end which helps the finish of this beer immensely.

4.28,4.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"The Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA. The "Holy Grail" for hopheads. This 20% "imperial" IPA certainly pushes even the most avid beer lover's perception of beer. It falls right in line with the rest of the Dogfish Head beers adorned with the CAUTION Dogfish Head exclamation point, daring the drinker to crack it open. On this occasion, I have had the privilege to open my 2006 vintage alongside my friend's 2003. It pours into my Dogfish Head Raison D'etre oversized wine goblet with pale golden amber body. At 20% ABV, one would expect no head at all but the head surprisingly erupts from the 2006 version whereas the 2003's head barley creates a film. The head of the 2006 leaves a nice film over the beer the whole way down leaving lace down the side of the glass. The aroma is almost nothing but malty sweetness, however this is also surrounded by notes of alcohol and citrusy hops. The taste is up front with the sweetness, followed by the alcohol, and finished with the bitterness and flavor from the hops, but the sweetness dominates over all. The 2003 is certainly sweeter. The beer exhibits more than a full body with an extreme amount of dryness on the finish and surprising lively amount of carbonation. In the end, the Dogfish Head 120 minute IPA is a very interesting beer. The warming sensations it brings can make it one of the most enjoyable beers on a cold winters night. However, its not an every night or even every week beer for that matter. If you are looking for that truly extreme beer though, this is the one you are looking for.","MSchae1017","Feb 17, 2007"

You can smell the sweetness synonymous with an American Double IPA and strangely, no alcohol smell is present. The taste is rich, woody, sweet, creamy, and bitter towards the end.

I imagine it's hard to hide 21% ABV. Looking for the bitterness here. Can pick up a piney hop taste if the swig in mouth is kind of for lack of a better word, "chuffed" around. If cellaring this mellows the hops, then I believe you want this as fresh as possible. Heavy mouthfeel and oily. Hardly any carbonation in mouthfeel.

Very sweet malty flavor. Much more than I expected, and the first drink went down like a shot with the high ABV%. The hops came through mostly in the aftertaste. Smells a little malty, but I could smell more hops than I could taste. Nice mouthfeel. Light/medium carbonation, medium full body. For me, this is not very drinkable because I could only drink it in limited quantities. It's also too sweet for my taste. Perhaps I could acquire a taste for this one over time, but at $8/bottle that probably won't happen anytime soon because there are so many more beers I still need to taste.","BeerCheese","Jan 26, 2007"

If you've had Stone's 10th Anniversary Ale, there is a certain onion/garlic presence, which was also present in this beer. Taste was really sweet and juicy, almost too sweet. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, with the alcohol really making itself known. One is more then enough for me. DFH prides themselves on making high gravity beers that don't taste like hard liquor, but in this case, you really can taste the alcohol.

The color is a dense musty orange, amber, with darker tones centering about the lower middle. The sent is great, to the best of imperial IPA, lots of hop character balanced well with sweet malt notes. Fruit and sugar all over the place. There is a small hint of Alcohol; it is possible that this sent only occurs to me because apparently this beers ABV is 21. I definitely do not smell 21 Abv in this, which makes this a deliciously dangerous beer. Honestly I think theyve done an excellent job concealing it. I must say that of all the strong beers Ive had this one is the beer you should be most careful of. At about 9 dollars a 12 oz I doubt Id buy it all the time, but since its around so little Ill buy every one I can just to show off to friends.

It's an experiment - I've heard it described as a "pixie stick hop bomb" - but I think it does what it does well. It's a thick, viscous syrup - think afterdinner drink (and at roughly 20% ABV, it's proofed like one). The aroma is afterdinner drinkish too - sweet almost plum brandy. It's sweet, it's hops-in-your-face, it's overboard - all that it's supposed to be, but also quite tasty. The version I had was from 2004, so the hops have likely mellowed out a bit.

Like novocain for the tongue and hot butterscotch for the throat, and a sweet beer reduction left on the lips. Numbing hops and numbing alcohol. A note of saccharin. Side note: it would make a great beer sorbet or salad dressing, or a sweet marinade or beer demi glaze for that matter. A near-liquor concoction with chewy malts and bitter oily hops galore.

The taste is extreme as can be expected and pretty sweet. I felt that at times I could feel sugar swishing around in my mouth but not overpoweringly sweet like a syrupy beer.

The ABV is glaring in the nose, but decidedly more down-tempo in the taste, or as understated as 21% can possibly be.

Kind of a fruit/cherry juice thing going on and a wood aged tannin flavor too. Malts are surprisingly strong and hold up quite well. Best part is that the hops are not nearly as astringent as I imagined. Medium mouthfeel that improves as the beer warms but in the sense that the beer evaporates off the tongue and becomes more light bodied.

Smell is sweet, caramelly malt up front, hops very faint but present, slightly grainy and grassy, followed by some light alcohol notes that finish out the nose. Taste is super sweet, huge alcohol presence, no suprise there, leaves a crisp and dry aftertaste with a hoppy bitterness. Mouthfeel is slippery and smooth, fuller bodied with low carbonation. Drinkability is impressive given the extreme +20% abv, sips smooth and wonderfully complex balancing act between some super heavy sweet maltiness and heavy hops. However, would recommend enjoying only one in a sitting, as the alcohol is smooth enough to catch one off their guard. Would purchase again.","danielocean03","Aug 18, 2006"

Then the alcohol hits, strongly, but it doesn't seem like 21%. There is a lot of risidual sweetness in the finish. All in all, the sweetness is the most dominating characteristic. The taste really is much more similar to a barley wine than any other double IPA I've had. In fact I've many barleywines with a more noticable hop character than this. The mouthfeel is very smooth and rather heavy. This isn't very drinkable. But it's not meant to be. Overall this is pretty good stuff and amazingly smooth for the alcohol.

Many places carry the 60 minute or 90 minute ales but it took a trip to Portland, ME to actually find a single bottle of 120. And trust me, I have been to a lot of incredibly savvy, beer filled distributors in the past. So was it everything that people had talked about and more?..eh, not exactly. Maybe I had hyped it up too much in my mind as being one of these holy grail type beers, high ABV and extreme drinkability, but it took almost 2 hours to sip through the heavy, almost syrupy liquid. No doubt on the ABV, this stuff packs a punch, but I could only find one person at a party of 35 who enjoyed it.(side note: it was a little tiny girl who said it was better than the summer ales she was drinking, go figure!) The reason was probably the strange sweetness that accompanied the brew. It was a very strong flavor that I'm sure is added to make consuming a high-test alcohol and hop beer more drinkable...but as I am a fan of the pure hop taste it kind of ruined the fun for me. Would I drink it again? Probably not, as one BA said before it could have been better for a late night in the dead of winter instead of at a 4th of July BBQ like I tried. It was 6.99 for the single bottle, a bit pricey but in the limited quantity not outrageous. Still, in the spirit of try everything once I would recommend it to all BA's and hops lovers alike.","maristfan","Jul 06, 2006"

Not very complex yet, but I would surmise that's what the cellar is for with this beer. What I would give to try a 5 year old version of this. Mouth is rich and creamy.

Taste is of a very sweet, make that an almost sickly sweet malt, with a slight edge of fruitiness. Strong alcohol flavor is in the mix. Some citrissy hop flavor fades into the background.

The next was a little easier with a taste of hops, followed by more alcohol that left a little burn at the back of my throat. There is no hiding this alcohol. Had a nice full almost thick mouth feel.

I was expecting a great hop smell, but the sweet smell over powered the hop smell. It smelled of candied sugar with a hint of hops and alcohol following. The beer (like the 90 Minute) first hit me with a overly sweet taste, and followed with a decent hop presence. Alcohol warming definitely is a flavor in the profile, but not as dramatic as I expected in such a high abv beer. I don't think this beer tasted like a DIPA, but more like a really sweet barleywine. The mouthfeel was medium to thick and really coated the tongue. The drinkability was good for such a high abv beer, but sweetness really detracted from the overall experience.

It pours a very clear orangey/amber with a thin 1/8" off-white head that leaves some bits of lacing. Upon closer inspection it appears unfiltered and even has a few beads of carbonation. Overall, it looks much better than I expected for something of this strength, but it's nothing to rave about. It smells of gentle fruits/hops (citrus, apricot), alcohol, and lots of sweetness. The taste is very sweet as well, with a dose of caramel, perhaps some smoke, and a good amount of fruits (orange, apricot). It is pretty bitter, yes, but... 120 IBUs? It's all hidden by the intense sweetness of the malts, which is also evident in the almost syrupy mouthfeel - it's one of the thickest beers I've come across. Also one of the most warming. Each sip feels like I just drank a liqueur, but I suppose it is as strong as some cordials. Not sure if I'd classify as a double IPA, as the malts seem to take the forefront here, and at times, the 120 reminds me of a barley wine. Apparently many reviewers here feel the same way. Too over the top I'd say, though not a bad beer. I'd like to see them tone the malts down some and let the IBUs come through.

More hop flavor also. The alcohol taste is quite strong, but not enough to ruin it. It does burn the back of the throat slightly. You can certainly feel the alcohol peeking into the bloodstream. The mothfeel is slightly thin, perhaps because there's so much alcohol, carbonation is medium. This one is definitely a sipper.

Its strong and syrupy sweet to start with, and while bitter, is actually kind of balanced, which was not what I though I was getting into. The sweetness is like syrup and powdered sugar on French Toast made with lots of vanilla. The hops are not overpowering, not out of line. They are bitter and resinous, but blend well with the super-sweet malt profile and hints of alcohol, which are amazing light for a brew this strong. I was expecting, and kind of hoping, that this would be more of a super bitter hop brew, but the sweetness is so prevalent it fairly well balances the hops. Syrupy body and very light carbonation. Not bad, but not what I would call drinkable and not what I was hoping for.

Big, caramel malt flavour kicks things off, and the alcohol warmth begins at the midpoint. This is also where the hops pick up, starting with pine and changing to orange/citrus towards the finish. Great balance. Full, viscous body that's just short of syrupy. Medium dry finish from the bountiful hop resin.

Flavors start with hop-tangerine, oranges, a *really* sweet malty, some cinamon and then APRICOT. There is a tiny moment of piney and pineapple to the hops. Hop bitter and co-ho comes along only during the swallow, prior to the swallow, the beer is all about the sweet and fruit. There is a gentle alcohol sting, that in no way presents as 20%. The aftertaste just hangs around forever. There's just a ting of carbonation forming on my tastebuds that combines with the alcohol on the inside of my lips. This combination counters some of the sweet and fruit. I think this beer need more hops and some caramel. To me, it's just too sweet and I felt like I wasn't able to catch everything that was going on. Thick mouthfeel and mildly caronbated. The beer just sticks to the tongue.

Plenty of hops going on but it seems its so hopped its a hop induced sweetness. Not quite cloying and the alcohol really plays a part in balancing that out. Tasty stuff, that would be better with a touch less sweetness in the flavor, but at this strength that might not be possible. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy with a coating sweetness. Towards the end of the bottle the sweetness really started to get to me which hurt the drinkability a touch.

I too thought that at 20% + it might be barley wine style-ish but on tap it was not nearly as syrupy as say foghorn or bigfoot. Dogfish hit a homerun in my book, for this depth this is unreal. You could slug this stuff if challenged but yet sipping provided a much nicer experience. I really did not feel an overwhelming alcohol nose or flavor. It flowed nicely with barely any head, correct carbonation, just enough to slide over the tongue. After a little 4 oz version the alcohol hits you, the strength on the start is way less than barley wine in notice-ability imo, although I understand the comparison.

Lots of residual sugars. Alcohol, though hidden well by the sweetness, tries to offset the syruppy texture and cloying aspects to some avail but ultimately suffers. It does however provide another depth of flavor. Slight grassy hops lie underneath but are faint until the finish. They are stronger in the finish but here the alcohol kick comes in for real. I feel it trickle down my body warming me up instantly. That is very good and very intense but the flavor profile seems to lack a depth or creativity that the really excellent beers have.

I am quite surprised by this because as an imperial IPA I expected overwhelming dominating hops, but this is not the case. It is very sweet, smooth and drinkable.

I cant say the bouquet is telling me much, there is a big malty-alcohol sweetness and the hops are noticeable but hollow, vague flowery notes. The smells are more intriguing than inviting; regardless I took a sip. My first swallow was so sweet! Was I drinking a solution of sucrose, Saccharin, Aspartame, Cyclamate, and Acesulfame K? Yes, it was that sweet. It took a little work before I noticed the hops; it never even approached a balanced point. An IPA? Pure BS. Frankly it never became that tasty either, yes it was good but Im not sure why this beer is in existence. DFH likes to push the envelope and experiment but what is the deal with 120? The maltiness is not complex enough to be a barleywine and the hops are too drowned to be an IPA. The brewers did a topnotch job at hiding the massive alcohol content in the taste; the effects of the alcohol are noticed elsewhere (i.e. the brain) but the cloying sweetness is just too off-putting. It is full bodied, thick and unyielding; the minimal carbonation makes the mouthfeel feel a bit sluggish. This is a one-try beer for me, I always wanted to try it and I am very happy I did.

Hops are promised on the label (they are both depicted in art form and mentioned in the text) but this beer is not about tasting extreme amounts of hops. As a homebrewer, I know that truckloads of hops had to be added to this beer in order to balance all the malt, but this does not taste like other double or Imperial IPAs that I have sampled. Far from it actually. That said, Dogfish Head 120 is quite different and I do like how the hops sort of surface here and there in this beer. They appear to be sort of in the shadows. Faint whisps of hop aroma (mostly a grassy aroma) combined with caramlized sugar. The malt aroma is so strong strong it almost reminds me of sniffing a cognac. The color of this beer is a light copper to my surprise it pours with a decent amount of carbonation with a soft white head of foam. The first flavors that I detect remind of a syrupy sherry more than any beer, especially and IPA. A bit grapefruitiness is detected as the beer warms up and a hop bitterness also emerges. The finish is otherwise dry and grows more bitter as the beer warms up. I liked this beer, and I loved the interplay between the massive amount of hops and malt, but I did not find this too be the extremely hoppy beer that the label and the hype seems to suggest. This is not an Imperial or Double IPA (this is reflected in some of my marks above), but it succeeds in pushing the envelope of strong beer, and I think it succeeds in being a very unsual beer which is precisely what Dogfish Head beers are good at being.","marcobrau","Feb 18, 2004"

It poured a dark clear amber with a very small head. The smell was very malty with a lot of alcohol. Now as to the taste, very caramel malty sweet then when it felt like it was too sweet the bitter/citrus hop flavors just take over, followed by the heavy alcohol after taste. I also detected hints of what tasted like pineapple? Crazy! This is an extreme beer. Not for the faint of heart, very exaggerated flavors in every way. Mouthfeel was surprisingly good, although I swear I could feel the alcohol evaporating off my lips. I gave the drinkability a high rating only because it went down waaaay smoother than I expected. However I don't know if I'd really drink more than one in a row. This beer begs to ask the question, "can there ever be too much of a good thing?" I recommend this to the hop heads and extreme beer lovers. Although to the hop heads expect alot of sweet malt in order to balance out the profuse usage of hops.

It was sweet and fruity with apricot tones -- dangerously pleasant, in fact, considering the ABV. I didn't even detect bitterness or alcohol in the aftertaste.

Taste is quite warm, moderate malty sweetness mostly, a bit complex yet mild, subdued fruityness of melons and a few darkened qualities with yellow raisin and fig. Some toffee and butterscotch meld together with a schnapps-like boozy warmth. Ends with a little extra kick of warmth, somewhat port-like and/or even vinous in character. Feel is well rounded, smooth, clean, and pretty full with a little burn of booze nearer the end and has some nice lingering sweetened mixtures that come through late in the finish...ah yes more malts...and more warmth. This is a major sipper and a great warmer-upper. I can see how some would be put off by its unusual presense and unexpected character, I went in with an open mind not trying to judge it from what I knew about the long hopping process this brew has.

This doesn't seem anything like an IPA to me, and not really even a double IPA. But I doubt it fits any style's definition very well.

It is far to sweet, again with the syrupy taste with banana and vanilla, and piny hops. There are minimal tastes of malt and the aftertaste is very sweet. There is a fair amount of carbonation, but the beer feels very thick, almost like congnac. At 20% ABV, this is definately a sipping drink, not to be drinken like a beer.

The start is sweet with a hint of dark fruits and pineapple syrup. The hops come in quickly with some slight grapefruit notes, but are not as sharp as I would expect. Some acidity from the hops sticks in the mouth past the finish, but even the hoppy finish it is still overly sweet. I really felt the alcohol in this one go straight to my head by the end of the glass. I couldnt image drinking more then one. This brew is a bit too sweet for my palate especially when I was expecting a high octane IPA. The sweetness and alcohol degrade the drinkability, and make it seem more like an IPA/barley wine.

Finish is oily to be sure, with an alcoholic burn as it goes down. Similar to Dogfish's World Wide Stout, this extreme beer is very drinkable for its overly substantial alcohol content (21% abv), although it's not on my list for continual drinking. If you can locate a bottle and have some funds to part with, I would suggest giving this special brew a try.","Jon","Jul 26, 2003"
3.93,-4.4,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Tried this after a 60 Minute IPA. Great looking IPA - beautiful amber color with light head that screams "Drink me!". Strong hop aroma. Much maltier and hoppier than the 60 Minute version, but this was expected. The malt taste lingers long on the tongue, allowing extra time between tastes. This is an IPA to savor the flavors and drink slowly by itself (not for pairing with food). I bought it at $9.99 a four pack, and the price is worth it.","Gavage","Jul 25, 2003"
3.38,-17.8,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Overall this was far from what I expected. If I didnt know before hand what this was I would have thought I was drinking a very young barleywine. I would like to lay down a few 750s and try them in a few years to see how this one matures. My hats off to Dogfish for the attempt but I dont think I would call it an IPA (strong dark ale perhaps?).","purplehops","Jul 13, 2003"
3.82,-7.1,4,4.5,4,4,2.5,"I normally won't review from memory but I had this last night and it was pretty memorable so here goes. It poured a very thick & light gold in color, with very little carbonation. Aroma was very sweet , along with taste, which was heavy on the apricots. Suprisingly the alcohol was masked well. It seems like Dogfish head can mask 20% beers well but fail to mask a 9% beer's alcohol...weird. Anyway, the hops really did'nt make much of an impact until after the beer went down, surfacing after the sweetness had receded in the aftertaste.A very nice mega-hoppy finish. I really enjoyed this beer and would try it again, not just as a novelty but because it was actually good.","avylover","Jul 06, 2003"
4.1,-0.2,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Overall, this beer is good, but bewildering. 120 Minute !PA conjures hops during a forbidden tango with trails of wilting would be suitor taste-buds in the background. Instead what we end up in this admittedly young brew is a sweeter strong ale with an overriding alcohol run.","drewbage","Jul 05, 2003"
4.6,11.9,5,5,4.5,5,4,"Dogfish Head Craft Brewery all hail to this amazingly revolutionary brewery that push the envelope and shake the industry up to keep things exciting. Here is one of the finest Imperial IPAs I have come into contact with 120 minutes of continously hopped amber goodness with an off white cream toned short lived head, but at 20% abv it's all good. Aroma contains a plethora off hop tones including those of the floral, pine cone, and citrus (grapefruit) varieties along with one very distinct alcohol nose butterscotch. The taste is strikingly sweet with overly ripened fruit tones apricot and plum notes very nice very hoppy, but amazingly balanced with one hell of a warming effect. Mouthfeel is syrupy and full carrying all of these flavors very nicely. The drinkability at 20% is straight rediculous and at 25.6 oz. beware don't crack a bottle of this by yourself because you might be tempted to finish it.","WVbeergeek","Jul 04, 2003"
4.54,10.5,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Dogfish Head has another great beer here with their 120 IPA. Was fortunate to get a bottle from the trusty Vintage Cellar. The 120 poured smoot, pale in color, some white head. Nice to see decent carbonation in one of these bolder beers, as compared to some of the Sam A. products. Alcohol presence was well balanced by the flavors of the IPA, are similar but much more pronounced than those of it's younger cousin the 90 minute IPA. Good hoppy aroma and flavor, along with a good maltiness.","mikeys01","Jul 02, 2003"
4.28,4.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"I scored one of these(at 17 bucks I couldn't convince myself to get more)while on vacation in Virginia. This beer poured a clear copper amber color and formed a huge foamy white head that left laticed lace as it subsided. Very little carbonation is present. An aroma of hops and malt, but surprisingly balanced. I thought the hops would have been more dominating with the usual Dogfish experimenting, but I was wrong. A slight hint of caramel is also present with a touch of pine. The flavor was of malt and hops with a medium caramel like taste with a warm aspect of the alcohol present. The finish was a medium creamy body with a sweet finish and warming alcohol. After Imperials, IPAs are one of my favorites. As with World Wide Stout, while this was a good beer, the pushing of the limits pushes it out of the top contention for IPAs if it can even be called that anymore.","Wildman","Jun 20, 2003"

3.93,-4.4,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Dark amber/light copper color. Nice off-white head. The aroma is very hoppy, but not pungent. Just a good hop note with a few alcohol esters. The taste is very sweet, with noticeable alcohol, but not like drinking schnapps (which generally has the same ABV). For all the hops, the malt dominates. The mouthfeel is solid, but actually seems lighter than expected. I guess all the alcohol cuts it a bit. The drinkability is fairly good for a brew this strong, but who in their right mind could drink a 750 ml bottle? I wouldn't mind seeing this in 12 oz like WWS. This is a very good, interesting sipping beer.","aaronh","Jun 09, 2003"

3.52,-14.4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Notes: I had been waiting for this beer ever since it came out, unable to find it in Virginia yet. I am hoping that when I purchase a few bottles and let them sit for a few months that the flavor will soften and be a little better-balanced. For me, the choice is clearly the 90-minute IPA.","OldFrothingSlosh","May 27, 2003"

3.97,-3.4,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Wow. Apricot fruity, with a muzzy haze of hop flavors and aromas all over the place - not really bitter (actually quite sweet and syrupy, but not cloyingly so) but the hops are really trying hard to keep up with all of the lmaltiness going on here. The alcohol strength is extremely well hidden - dangerous. I keep expecting a bitterness to balance the malt, but that's not what this beer is about. There are a lot of floral, citric, and herbal hoppiness behind the malt that make this one well worth quaffing. A bit too big for extensive drinkability - NOT a session beer by any means. But it does work well as an homage to the flavor of hops.","sponberg","May 23, 2003"
4.38,6.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I bought some from the online source vintage cellar in VA. I just opened a bottle last night and in my opnion it was close to amazing. Nothing like the 24% wws which to me tastes like hard alcohol. The 120 minute actually is not hoppy enough to meet the sweetness but it is damn close to. It is a beautiful beer. Not too carbonated (like most beers that use champagne yeast are). It is actually hard to taste the alcohol. Nothing like earlier reviews from people who tasted the keg and said it was spoiled or too thick or gooky. This beer looks beautiful and professional and it is a joy to taste. I guess this beer proves the theory that at a certain point hops can get more flavorful or bitter in a beer because it still wasn't enough for me. Great job Dogfish.","davidlown","May 12, 2003"
4.28,4.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"This beer had a deep golden color, with a viscous of a fine dessert wine. Nice lace because it just clings not to carbonated but suites me fine. Not too big on the aroma but still nice. Mouthfeel of a belgian with the sweetness which tapers down the high hops this has in it. It is amazing that this beer is so well balanced for 20.04% abv. This is definately one of the best put together extreme beers on the market.","sprinkle","May 09, 2003"
3,-27,3,3,3,3,3,"Nothing subtle about this IPA, or for that matter, any Dogfish brew. Deep cloudy gold with white foamy and fizzy head and plenty of sticky doily type lace. The aroma is mostly strong hops with a blast of alcohol. A medium amount of sweet doughy malt and very highly hopped with strong metallic and grapefruit peel bitterness. An In-Your-Face-Strong, wild and raw tasting brew. Oh! Little tiny bits and particles of interest.","BeerResearcher","Apr 28, 2003"

This beer is still young so there is hope yet. Right now, this beer is just too big for itself. Not as good as the 60 and 90 minute versions. bleh","scottum","Apr 06, 2003"
