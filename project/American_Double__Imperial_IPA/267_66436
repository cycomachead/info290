Tastes of grapefruit/citrus, light earthy/grassy, barley, sweet malts.  Medium body and a bit on the heavy side with the carbonation, pine and citrus resin on the tongue with a sweet malt aftertaste.

Flavor reveals a tropical fruit dominant base, which becomes resiny and bitter in the finish. Muddled mango, pineapple, and tangerine add intrigue. Lightly sweet caramel and toasted malt are accented by herbal notes. Flavoring hop dominant example of the style, with enough malt character to support, but not overwhelm.

4.25,-0.9,,,,,,"This is a very good double IPA and great starting point for the uninitiated. On the nose it's got tropical fruits, pineapple was the biggest one for me, but also mango and lemon. Pours an opaque golden color with a white head. It's medium bodied, astonishingly easy drinking considering the ABV, and packs a prickly hop bite. On the palate it retains those fruits, peach, pineapple, mango, lemon, tangerine, with an excellent balance to both the alcohol and bitterness. Fantastic IPA I can't wait to have again.","BrewChatKen","Oct 28, 2014"

Nose of tropical fruit, with mango, melon, and apricot, on a toasted backbone, with subtle piney notes. Flavors are melon forward, with piney and grassy hops notes to follow. Very well balanced. Subtle pepper and roasted notes. Smooth and light, with a fruity and bitter aftertaste. Frothy, clean finish. Very solid beer.","GarthDanielson","Oct 26, 2014"

Taste is malt focused as well, with rich caramel malts and toffee notes, balanced by just a little hop flavors. Perhaps there is hop fade here, but if so it didn't translate to lingering bitterness as it often does, as I get none. Really drinkable for a DIPA.  Overall a wonderful DIPA and a refreshingly "English" take on the style.","HuskyHawk","Oct 14, 2014"

4.35,1.4,4,4.5,4.25,4.75,4.25,"Pours a slightly murky glowing orange with a medium off white foamy head. Receded quickly and leaves a good deal of lacing. The aroma is marvelously sweet. Pine, citrus, and honey lead the way. Some light floral hops along with the citrus. The citrus aromas are strong, with loads of grapefruit, lemon zest, and orange peel. The taste comes with an explosion of juicy citrus and sweet caramel malts, along with some nice pine resin. Decent amount of hops, not enough to knock you on your butt. The malts and pine subside a bit as it warms, letting the citrus further shine. A lot of sweetness going on here. Actually remind me a bit of an American Barleywine. A little bitterness is present with the sweetness, but not too much. A little bit of bite from the alcohol as it warms. Never seen a beers flavor transform as the temp changes quite like this one. Not much carbonation. Despite being a bit sticky, this one is a dangerously easy drinker. One of the most masterfully masked ABV that I've ever seen as well. Overall, not the strongest DIPA you'll see, but the balance and ease of drinking is what makes this one a must try.","majorbase2","Oct 07, 2014"

The first large drink you get some bitterness that is immediately replaced with some sweet citrus and malt, and finishes with that IPA bitterness, but not too bitter, just right. The swallow leaves your mouth a little dry, and the aftertaste is actually sweet and a little sticky. The carbonation is low but the beer itself has some substance, a weightier feel on your tongue. With the alcohol content, was surprised at the absence of a strong alcohol taste. As this beer warmed up a bit, it seemed to get sweeter and smoother.","Landon518","Oct 02, 2014"

That's a shame and may or may not be the fault of Odell, but either way, it affects how the beer tastes. Even so, this is a really nice beer. Well-balanced between the hops and the all malt that would be necessary to get such a high ABV.","mayamike","Aug 06, 2014"

The beer is clear and filtered with a very foamy and slightly creamy off white head that dissipates quickly but leaves a ring around the inside of the glass. The beer smell has a strong grapefruit smell with hints of pineapple and strawberry as well as bits of sugar. The beer tastes similar to the how it smells. The beer has very sweet and caramel tastes along with the hop bitterness. The taste has grapefruit hops but other flavors dominate the taste. The sugary sweetness arrives in the form of pineapple and slight hints of strawberry flavors. The beer has a heavy body with a smooth and really clean feel to it. However, the beer still has a slightly sticky aftertaste. A very good beer and one of the best DIPAs that I have had.

Taste is more balanced, harsher malty backbone, with bold hoppy flavors. The hoppy flavor is more oily then it is floral. While its well carbonated, there is a "flat" feel. Overall in my opinion its quite overrated, too sweet but too harsh.","vette2006c5r","Sep 21, 2013"

It looks like a IIPA is supposed to look, smells like a IIPA is supposed to smell, feels like an IIPA is supposed to feel and, most importantly, tastes like an IIPA is supposed to taste. What I particularly enjoy is how there are juicy citrus hops, but also a tempering pine/cedar flavor and just enough caramel to to keep things in balance. Its not a one-trick pony. The feel is also wonderful. Top notch.","spoony","Sep 14, 2013"

Flavor best can described as juicy with tropical fruit and sweet malt backbone balanced by grapefruit bitterness that turns a bit floral/herbal. For such a high ABV, the alcohol is well hidden. Medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel that finishes slightly dry. Very drinkable (for such a high ABV) and extremely tasty. Overall, a very well balanced and crafted Double IPA.

The nose is passionfruity/slightly floral/white grapey and has a hint of candy sweetness. The taste is quite distinct and unique; surging sugary sweetness and a very interesting tropical fruit hop profile make this similar to drinking a slightly muted dreadnaught. The mouthfeel is medium-full and potently sweet bodied with creamy effervescence, masked alcohol, and has a modestly bitter (yet incredibly hoppy) finish. This is a delicious 4-pack, especially considering the price, and I hope to try it fresher in the future.","ThePorterSorter","Jun 24, 2013"

You'd never guess this was such a huge beer, considering how smooth and easy drinking it is, but you know it's a DIPA because of the complex hop explosion.

It is more a homage to hop character, with a restrained bitterness and minimal malt character that lead to a blank canvas for the hops to display their subtle nuances throughout the sip and into the dry finish. Very interesting and very well executed, I would absolutely get it again given the chance.","Siriusfisherman","Mar 31, 2013"

Beneath all the hops is a touch of sweetness from the malt. The flavor is quite hoppy--very fruity and floral with solid hop bitterness. The malt is not lost in this beer and some candy-like sweetness plays off the solid bitterness imparting a long-lasting dance of bittersweetness. The body is perfect for the style--full yet not chewy with moderate carbonation. Overall a wonderful DIPA--well worth picking up a 4 pack!","uwmgdman","Nov 03, 2012"

Aromas are amazing - tropical fruits, nice floral hop bouquet, pineapple, mango, wow. 1st sip gushes with fresh, juicy, ripened pineapple, with orange, passionfruit, peach. Biscuity malt makes an appearance but the sweetness gives way to a more pungent mango/piny bitterness, but finishes oh so clean. Alcohol is well concealed. Mouth-feel is creamy but a little resiny, hop oils coat the palate and ride out the intense pineapple and mango flavors. Overall, a truly remarkable DIPA.

Each sip of Myrcenary is so smooth it almost hurts. The citrus flavor shines thru and marries oh so perfect with the bitter twang. It is amazing how that citrus flavor just hangs around. The alc. is lost in there which is great but it all works together for a velvet like finish. I love this beer. My 2 fav DIPA's are now both out of CO.

This will go toward the top of my favorites list. I'll revisit this one very soon. A true hop-heads delight. I'd say its the best DIPA in "fly over country" and will give any coastal, hop-forward DIPA or IPA a run for its money-- even the legendary Pliny. I'd also claim that this is better than Hopslam.

The flavors are a nice mix of pineapple, citrus, clean and light pine and a light honey malty sweetness. It's very, very good. I love IPAs that aren't loaded with caramel malts. The alcohol isn't very noticeable at all. This one is light bodied and very easy to drink. Very easy. It's just a nice combination of aroma, flavor, and drinkability.

3.84,-10.5,4,2.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall - A strong player in the DIPA style. The hops, while plentiful, play in a more unique way than this beer’s peers. Holding back in the aroma and steering clear from that traditional hoppy bitterness, this hop profile is all about an acidic feel and fruity flavors. I feel there’s almost more bitterness from the yeast than the hops. I’m always a proponent of the bitter start/floral finish hophead IPAs, but this ‘Myrcenary’ upsets the status quo without apology, and with success.","paperbackfoster","Sep 29, 2011"

My first sip is a very nice citrus flavor followed by a mouth drying burst that makes me want to have another sip.

Smell is a tiny bit disappointing, a bit of cantaloupe and some pine. Taste is initially a wave of sugar cookie sweetness, followed by a little bit of candied lemon. A bit of ethanol is detectable here. It finishes with a quite herbal, grapefruit rind finish. Mouthfeel is silky smooth, low carbonation. Overall an amazing Double IPA, other than the slightly lackluster aroma and perceptible alcohol which bring it's score down a bit. I certainly plan on getting this again.","tronester","Sep 07, 2011"

4.2,-2.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Myrcenary pours a nearly opaque tangerine, with the color lightening towards yellow in the right light. The white foam tops out at only about two fingers tall. The head retention is well above average, but the lacing is just average. The nose is a tropical vacation, it's an absolute pineapple and mango bomb, with a bit of peach thrown in as well. There's just a light bit of candi sweetness in the flavor profile to keep things interesting, otherwise it's an all hops affair. Bitterness is enough to grab your atttention, but stops short of being aggressive. The close of each sip is exactly what the aroma promises, a full on tropical fruit assault. Mango has stepped up to tie with pineapple for the lead, with peaches pulling up the rear, and just a drop of citrus juice added into the profile. The body has a little more presence than I might have hoped for, a little more lightness would have done wonders. Carbonation is right in the comfort zone, bubbly and active, though it's a minor, minor quibble that it could be just a little more so. Myrcenary is a solidly above average imperial IPA, and I'm glad I picked up a whole four pack instead of just a bottle.","axeman9182","Aug 22, 2011"
4.3,0.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"O: This is a very nice Imperial IPA that is blends together excellently.. The 9% ABV is evident but married with the spiciness/resiny, slight sweetness and moderate hoppiness make it a glass you keep picking up and before you know it, the bottle is gone.

Needless to say, the nose alerts us that copious amounts of hops were used to achieve such an amazing aroma. Just enough malt to lift this beer up, the body is a bit chewy and has some depth. Big smack of juiciness from the alcohol and hops; soon after, the hops break off and explode with bitterness and a flavor of grapefruit rind that does not seem to go away. Small nugget of malt flavor in the middle. As the bitterness levels out, the alcohol comes back around with its warmth. Juicy with a semidry finish. Epic in its own way, it’s a sipper, but one that will grow on you if you are a true hophead.","BeerAdvocate","Jul 28, 2011"

This brew went a little too quick. Just watch out, Odell's did an amazing job hiding the alcohol in this one, you can literally go from a Sunday sit down taster to a tits out Friday night banger if your not careful.

4.07,-5.1,3.5,4,4.5,3,4,"O'Dell has heralded Spring with a suite of new and appetizing beers, all with a perceptible bow to the fragrances and flowers of a Colorado Spring. Although our state is beleaguered by capricious weather, most especially in March, April and May, O'Dell suffers from no such inconsistencies. Their Spring line-up has been excellent through and through, beginning with the very vernal Myrcenary. This beautiful example of an IPA pours out with a pure white head, and the body exhibits moderate clarity the color of apple juice. Hops, a bucolic whiff of farm soil, a graceful note of pineapple and the yeastiness of a freshly toasted English muffin are complemented by the thick, battery sweetness of pancake batter, all in an evanescent and airy stream. The flavor is, simply put, a light, well balanced IPA with a fresh and brilliantly added squeeze of lemon flavor. Most reviewers reported a significant taste of pine, but I never tasted anything remotely that dark or oozing. Rather, I detect a collection of light citrus flavors with mild hops and bitterness. The Mycenary has enough astringency to bill itself a refreshing summer beer, but never enough to make my taste buds recoil, and the light and bright flavors of fresh lemons impeccably blended with the hops' astringency are a completely unique approach to a Spring season and its accompanying palate.","GarrettB","May 26, 2011"

First thought is that this may be the best beer made in CO today.Def not ever. But today?... quite possibly. Closest thing to pliny and that supreme grapefruity, hoppy delicious taste this side of the continental divide. hope this isnt just a good batch, and becomes something consistent, and consistently available. time will tell if this beer is in line with my first take.","cmfinger","May 16, 2011"

4.27,-0.5,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"It’s been a long day. Let’s hope that this beer hits the spot. I had this when it was on tap at Old Chicago for the St. Patrick’s mini tour. Odell has since then started distributing it in 4 packs. I jumped at the chance to taste it again when I found it on the shelf a few weeks ago. Pours a hazy golden color, with a small frothy head. The nose is an eruption of hop character. Orange citrus shines through, followed by pineapple, with resinous pine underneath. This is a hop head’s wet dream. Citrusy pineapple hops start, and grassy malt sweetness finishes. There’s a beautifully understated bitterness level that’s soft, velvety, and smooth. The malt profile has kind of a honey-almond quality. It’s just there to keep the hops in balance. I think it could stand to be a bit bigger, but Mycenary aims for quaffability, and in that respect it succeeds. Mouthfeel is medium and the carbonation level gets out of the way. For a beer that packs 9.3% ABV, this is dangerously drinkable, as the hop bitterness and solid malt profile hide the alcohol. Too often double IPAs come across as too harsh. That’s not the case with this beer, as it’s well rounded and quite enjoyable to drink (again, think quaffable), despite the monster levels of both bitterness and ABV. A very effective hop delivery vehicle.","eclaycamp","May 15, 2011"

Medium body with fairly soft carbonation. The taste starts of with an oily hoppiness that’s drier than the aroma with mango, floral and spicy traits and the malt presence is less prevalent than on the aroma. There is also a cracker taste to it. The finish is quite resiny and clean. This hides the alcohol very well and is dangerously drinkable.

4.5,4.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O. Overall I am pretty impressed. I really like regular Odell IPA and Myrcenary delivers as well. Nice citrus and tropical fruit hop flavors. I like Odell's malt flavor in their IPAs. I think it lets the hops shine. Very glad this is going to be a year round release, just wish Odell's was distributed in Iowa.","siradmiralnelson","Apr 02, 2011"
4.35,1.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I could have tried this on my trip to Arizona but didn't know what it was when I saw it on a tap list. So I had a bottle here at home. Very nice DIPA, not super bitter. I should probably pick up a 4 pack.","Mdog","Apr 02, 2011"
4.92,14.7,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Some nice lace on this one. Smells like some top end sticky icky. Not too bitter...not too sweet, this beer is well balanced. The alcohol at over 9% is well hidden. A very session able beer and good news it will be a year round release. This is the good stuff as Julio would say.","dave43","Apr 01, 2011"
4.37,1.9,4.5,5,4,5,4,"This beer pours a hazy orange color. The head is one inch of firm egg shell white foam that recedes slowly into sticky lacing. The aroma is of mandarin orange, grapefruit, hibiscus, and a hint of pine. There is a lot of complex hop goodness going on in this aroma. The taste is a lot more citrusy than the aroma with the floral and pine elements hidden in the back ground. There is also a bit of heat during the finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a silky texture, and low carbonation. Overall, this is a really good DIPA, but I wouldn't quite call it great.","KarlHungus","Apr 01, 2011"
4.41,2.8,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Massive thanks goes out to Rake for this one as an extra in a recent trade! Served from bottle into a Surly Darkness snifter. Poured a hazy yellow-orange with a three finger bone white head that subsided to one very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, grapefruit, citrus, and grapefruit hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, pine, grapefruit, lime zest, citrus, citrus hop, grapefruit hop, and hints of sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this beer wowed me in all aspects! The complexity of this one on the flavor was nothing short of insane and really surprised me once I started digging. The aroma was good but did nothing in the way to prepare your palate for what was to come. Also had a very nice bitter bite from the hops as well on this one. I saw this mentioned in a thread recently and HAD to crack it open, really glad I did. Definitely worth introducing this to your palate, trust me, they will become good friends.","thagr81us","Apr 01, 2011"
4.8,11.9,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Odell, you have hit a home run! Keep this on as a seasonal or year rounder if feasible. I'm wishing I had bought more than a 4 pack of this. This was great on draft as well","russpowell","Mar 31, 2011"

4.92,14.7,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"O: This is one of the most well balanced IIPA, I have come by. The smooth and light character is well achieved with the high ABV and the flavors of the hops are fresh and some of the best hop profiles seen. I will seek this out to have on hand at all times. A top 10 best brews of all time for me.","GDBEERMAN","Mar 30, 2011"

4.12,-4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pour yields a peach-colored brew with a good white head with moderate retention. Good sticky lacing as it falls down the glass. The nose is really overpowering with an overload of tropical fruits, mostly mango with a bit of pineapple. Behind that, there's a touch of citrus. The flavor is along the same lines--no malt, just plenty of hop character. The flavor isn't as strong as the nose would suggest, though still quite nice. There's a decent amount of bitterness in the background, as well as a bit of alcohol to balance. Not too bitter; the hop flavor seems to be the showcase here. Overall, a very nice beer that I will gladly have again.","Thorpe429","Mar 29, 2011"

4.35,1.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a sexy pale golden with slight haze, and thick creamy white meringue-like head. Nose is the expected tropical fruit delight, as well as floral delights in there too. Some herbal/grassy notes are present also. Palate is surprisingly tame, not a whollop in your face DIPA at all, just a smooth textured beer that is nicely balanced with the tropical fruity hops and candied malt. Not overly bitter. Very balanced, tasty, drinkable.","yemenmocha","Mar 26, 2011"
4.22,-1.6,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Good amount of carbonation. Very smooth beer. A little hot as noted, but still very nice. All in all a very good beer. Not quite on par with pliney, hopslam and the like, but getting close.","bfields4","Mar 26, 2011"
4.08,-4.9,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Notes: Myrcenary is a medium to full-bodied DIPA, with a creamy mouthfeel that stands up to the intensity of the hops. For what it lacks in aroma, the taste and the long finish make up for it. A very tasty example of this style, and very easy to drink. Well done, Odell!","WYVYRN527","Mar 25, 2011"
4.62,7.7,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Nose has tons of fruit, mango and peach like but also some citrus, fantastic. Head was soft, fluffy and retained for a good time. Poured somewhat pale in color and hazy. Lacing was present and pronounced throughout the glass. I was a bit concerned with the ABV being 9.3 but it is hardly noticeable. Tasted of more fruit and less citrus/grapefruit than the Odells IPA. The carbonation was on the lower side but it works very well. The taste and nose just kept growing on me as I drank it, quickly becoming a favorite.","chodez","Mar 25, 2011"

4.2,-2.1,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"I like this overall, but I don't think it is quite top-tier. I think it is drinkable as hell, but I prefer the hop bitterness to stand out a little more in my DIPA's. This is a very good beer however and I am more than happy to be able to access this one year round.","jera1350","Mar 22, 2011"
4.32,0.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I had been looking forward to this one for awhile and it did not disappoint. Odell makes a nice IPA and it's no surprise that their new DIPA is a solid addition to their lineup. I can see myself picking this up on a regular basis.","drumrboy22","Mar 22, 2011"

4.1,-4.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Draft. On tap at Old Chicago in Eden Prairie. Poured into a pilsner style 10oz glass a slightly cloudy orange amber color with a slight white head that leaves laces as it settles. Strong hop resin aroma in the nose with mostly citrus rind notes. Medium/heavy mouhfeel. Pretty sweet upfront but expected as a DIPA. Nice smooth citrus hop flavors. I get a lot of apricot out of this one in the flavor as well. Lingering bitterness. Abv is well hidden and this drinks incredibly well.","kbutler1","Mar 04, 2011"
3.48,-18.9,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Upon first sniff I thought it was the same as the regular IPA. It smells more hoppy though, especially after it warms up. Taste is very hoppy, sort of spicy hoppiness, I think I like the regular IPA much better. The mouthfeel on this is too syrupy for my tastes. If you are looking for a hop bomb this might fit the bill but the syrup aspect tells me I won't be buying this again. This is better than the double IPA I had from Odell at Falling Rocks 10th anniversary party several years ago.","ArrogantB","Mar 03, 2011"

3.54,-17.5,3,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Had this one on tap this afternoon at the Odell Brewery in Fort Collins. Pours a medium golden color with nary a head. Aromas of earthy hops, some pine and caramel.

4.92,14.7,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"The aroma is grapefruit with slight hint of pine. The appearance is golden hazy. The flavor begins with a 2row malt taste followed quickly by citrus hop flavor and then the flavor rolls across the tongue with flavors of pine and resin. The finish is only slightly bitter which leaves you wanting more. A great beer and I understand the name comes from the brewer extracting the mycerene hop oils that are considered bad at boiling but Odell found a way to use those oils.","burtn","Feb 27, 2011"
