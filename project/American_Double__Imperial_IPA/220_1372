The hops in this beer are nice and citrusy and give a lot of pine notes.  I liked the beer a lot and would suggest trying it.","JPowell712","Yesterday at 06:13 PM"

But as a simple consumer and beer lover, I am quite enamored by the impeccable balance this beer achieves while still exhibiting great complexity. It is perhaps a little too similar to the rest of the Lagunitas canon, especially for a limited release, but it is one of those beers I would look forward to regardless of my mood, my craving, the season, etc.","BethanyB","Jan 24, 2015"

On my rating scale, Stone RuinTen is a perfect 100; DFH 90-Minute a 97.  I'll give Maximus a 94.  One of the best values in the IIPA genre!","DeanWormer","Jan 21, 2015"

There is a slight grassy hop with astringent aspect and mild sweet malt following. The hop bitterness is not overly aggressive yet there is a slight acidity in the background which adds to the complexity with some grapefruit juiciness and herbal character that counters the malt sweetness as it finishes with a mild alcohol flavor which only detracts slightly . This is a very good Imperial IPA with nice amount of hop flavor although a bit sweet -in general worth trying and highly drinkable for the style-Solid.","Slatetank","Nov 12, 2014"

Behind these are melon and a sharp lemon dishwasher powder essence.  The orange and pine are dominant with a good malt backbone.  Becomes more phenolic with warming.  Hides the alcohol.

4.75,19.3,,,,,,"delicious!!!!!! VERY VERY VERY excellent example of a double IPA. very hoppy and straight forward. This (thankfully) isn't a malt bomb like Southern Tier Un Earthly or 2xIPA. you can actually taste the hops (unlike southern tier malt bombs) not to hate on southern tier however,  it's just that their beers I mentioned are extremely sweet and malty. This one however is very hoppy and bitter. Just how I like :)  . Extremely smooth. (Just had a whole 6 pack because I couldn't help myself and I rarely do this). It really is that easy and smooth to drink. Thanks Lagunatis,  for making every beer I have drank from you just as delicious as the last one I've tasted. This one some what reminds me of Undercover Investigation Shutdown DIPA, but is a bit more bitter. (In a good way)","bman13","Sep 20, 2014"

4.09,2.8,4,4.25,4,4.25,4,"This is what a decent DIPA should taste like.  A very dark amber with a hint of orange.  The smell is dominated by the citrus and pine hops.  The taste again is very "hop forward" with the malt taste coming in later with the very good finish.  The mouth feel is very rich and the carbonation level is perfect.  My only warning is that this beer gives absolutely no warning of the rather high alcohol percentage and after a couple could sneak up on someone unsuspecting.  Overall this is a great DIPA worth every penny.","Retroman40","Sep 20, 2014"

It's a working man's IPA not the best but at the same time for someone that still appreciates a good double/imperial IPA and doesn't want to throw down $6 a bomber it serves a mighty fine purpose in my monthly rotation. Don't let this review knock you it's just something you shouldn't have to seek out but if it's on the shelf and you haven't tried it yet, it beats most domestic IPAs by a stretch.","putonyourwalkingshoes","Jul 31, 2014"

Stone, Founders, even Lagunitas IPA, none of them can compare. I know its all personal preference but damn this is a damn good beer.

Certainly don't go into this one expecting a substitute, but it's a nice, unassuming DIPA that would be easy to sit back and have a few (or a bomber) on a pleasant weather day. I could also see it pairing with food rather easily. Perhaps it could be called a "starter" Double IPA, if such a thing exists.","LambicPentameter","Jul 08, 2014"

The nose is a blend of sweet citrus (orange and mango) coupled with notes of grapefruit and pine over a sweet caramel background. Almost full bodied with a rich creamy texture. The carbonation level is normal with a touch of effervescence on the finish. The complex, yet balanced, flavor profile is outstanding. It begins with a tart burst of citrus hop flavor like the nose, flows to a mild sweet citric bitterness which recedes into a caramel sweetness. The finish is smooth with a burst of sweetness and lingering light tart bitterness. A complex brewer's masterpiece of balance, flavor and bitterness.","tillmac62","Mar 21, 2014"

Lace that stuck like glue to the glass. Incredible citrus and floral hop aromas. It's a DIPA but is really well balanced. Also higher on the ABV but no bite from the alcohol content. Medium+ carbonation and less than average viscosity. This is a very sessionable DIPA in my opinion. Next time I'm going for the growler fill. PS - I paired it with some roast antelope which is a bit gamey, they both worked well together.","BVukelich","Feb 07, 2014"

Better balanced and more complex than the aroma suggests. Dry and sticky with grassy pine, spruce tip and resinous hop oils followed by hints of juicy grapefruit, orange pith, pineapple and mango. The intense hop profile is countered by a malt backbone with strong caramel sweetness, toffee and toasted bread. The malt presence is stronger than I usually prefer but in this beer it provides excellent balance without hindering the complex hop flavors. The high ABV is excellently masked with a touch off boozy sweetness in the finish but there's no heat to speak of. Complex, flavorful and dangerously drinkable. Another very solid beer from Lagunitas.","corby112","Feb 04, 2014"

It's not the best West Coast IPA, but it certainly seems to epitomize everything that's good about them.","HookerBrews","Jan 22, 2014"

Balance of sweet and bitter is pleasant and satisfying. Overall, this is a very solid ipa from one of my favorite breweries but it is not a stand out.

4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"From my tasting notes: It poured a golden amber with a strong fruity hop aroma. The Maximus had a good grapefruit hopiness with a sweet malt backbone that helped round out the flavor. This is a really nice IIPA that is more on the citrusy hops side. I am having trouble finding a bad Lagunitas beer, and the Maximus may be my favorite so far.","brurevu","Nov 26, 2013"

The flavor was more of the same with tropical fruits, grapefruit, and some booze standing out. The mouthfeel was syrupy with a hint of carbonation. Overall, this is a good double IPA that was fill in for Sucks.","thegodfather2701","Nov 25, 2013"

At a slightly lower ABV and price point than other highly touted IIPA's (Dogfish Head 90min, Myrcenary to name two of my favs) this makes a valid argument for being the one I stock regularly in my fridge for its benefits to my wallet and its drinkability.","laglocal","Oct 20, 2013"

4.22,6,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/3/2013. Pours moderately cloudy golden orange color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, lemon zest, pineapple, tangerine, orange zest, floral, pine, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity of hop notes with a moderate malt balance; and great strength. Taste of grapefruit, lemon zest, tangerine, pineapple, orange zest, floral, grass, light pine, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, floral, light pine, light caramel, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity of citrus/floral hop flavors with a moderate malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent DIPA! All around great complexity and balance of hop and moderate malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on the for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 18, 2013"

Sure, it's stronger than an IPA, but it seems rather unique to me. Not that hoppy, though the hop presence is unmistakable, and rather malty. I'm a big DIPA drinker and this was my first a while ago, but I hadn't had it in a while. So different from others that are really bitter and aromatic. This almost seems to me to approach a strong ale in style. Not a great DIPA but still a great beer, if that makes sense.","Qbdoo","Oct 05, 2013"

Aroma is a pleasant sweet toffee, grapefruit, raspberry, almost a bit of an old wine fermented sweetness. Taste is herbal weedy hops, orange/grapefruit/kumquat citrus bitters, perhaps some green tea, vegetal flavors to go along with the citrus pith, all underlain by a sweet graham cracker backbone. Nice complexity here although the sweet grain orange peel finish is a tad boozy and maybe a bit coarse. There is some pine too but to my palate bitter citrus runs the show. Nice intermediate level IPA, beginners to this style should start smaller but there are bigger hop bombs out there that are also sweeter from a malt standpoint.","CalgaryFMC","Aug 25, 2013"

Pours a dull, burnt orange hue with a slightly hazy clarity and a dense, two-inch, cream-colored head topped with tiny clusters of bubbles concentrated across the center. Head eventually settles into a creamy half inch cap with thick swaths of lacing coating the sides of the glass after each tilt. Nose expresses citrus notes, rind, a hint of toffee, a slight earthiness and perhaps a touch of grapefruit seed. Taste consistent with nose; however, a bit of an herbal character comes out and dulls the toffee sweetness. Finishes with an earthy bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a faint oiliness to the texture, an even carbonation and a light astringency. Overall, a decent balance to the malt profile; however, the flavors come off a bit muddled without really deciding if it wants to be more sweet or more hop forward. It could be an old bottle, but a bit difficult to determine without freshness dating.","Jwale73","Aug 07, 2013"

Taste starts sweet and goes from bitter to tang as it moves over the tongue, good citrus going on and you keep wanting another sip. A nice crisp mouthfeel with a slightly oily finish that holds the bitter tang on the back of the throat.

3.76,-5.5,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,3.5,"overall: too sweet, could use more alcohol and more dominant hop notes, instead this beer is very sweet, sugary, and malt heavy for a DIPA. May be a stylistic choice, as I prefer grapefruit and citrus dominant IPAs where the malt takes the backseat in the flavor profile, the finish is just too sweet for me. Most Lagunitas beer's I think are on the sweet side, but I usually like most of them, this one was just average at best. I would much prefer Hop Stoopid, Lucky 13, Undercover, or Lil Sumpin Sumpin.","Roman5150","Jul 04, 2013"

I actually like Lagunitas Imperial and Double IPAs much better than the their regular. Maximus is perfectly balanced. Tons of great hop/pine/spice flavors that are in perfect proportion. This brew also has very little bitterness so perhaps it would be a good IPA for people looking to expand their tastes. A definite go-to IPA for me now.

Lagunitas is slowing becoming one of my new favorite breweries simply because they make good beer for a value price. I'm looking forward to trying their other offerings. 4","screamking","Mar 04, 2013"

Taste is a bit of malt up front, followed with a serious hop blast. The finish is bitter hops with lots of dry grapefruit. Mouthfeel is good. It's nicely carbonated and there is just a hint of alcohol warming. Overall, an excellent double IPA. Hoppy and assertive.","DoreenAndDave","Dec 09, 2012"

3.92,-1.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"another big brutal hoppy offering from lagunitas. pour is surprisingly orange, glowing, but the head is a let down, white but small. the nose is big sweet and bitter fresh hops, some english malts but they are way back. sweet up front, bitter on the back end, just what i like. the taste is the same, maybe a little too sweet for my palate as a big ipa, but it doesnt last long, and its not sugary, just like fresh hop sweetness. could stand a touch more carbonation, but the body is a nice medium, and its pretty drinkable for its abv. for once the yeast in a lagunitas beer seems to be different, my main knock against them has been all the same yeast for everything, but this doesnt appear to be that, which i am thankful for. overall a good beer, a 6er to share, a little sweet, but a nice wintery ipa. cant taste the booze at all, just the hops.","StonedTrippin","Nov 28, 2012"

Tastes quite good but I would have much more of a hop bite. I should also note that this beer was put in an ice cooler as soon as it was purchased, and although it remained cold at all times I'm sure the temperature fluctuated more than I would have liked so I intend to update this after drinking a fresher bottle without the added variables.","MacQ32","Oct 23, 2012"

Tastes sweet at first, then bitterness builds, the carbonation scrubbing and sustained; mouth-feel is slightly thicker but not out of typical for a DIPA. Some flavors of citrus, and mango maybe and pineapple, and new electronics, and the alcohol is moderately prominent, and lightly warming.

A vibrant tropical hop character makes it an enticing drink. However, being that the size and bitterness are somewhat tame for what we now expect from an Imperial IPA, it doesn't really stand out above the crowd anymore. That doesn't change the fact that it's a tasty beer at an appealing price ($10.99 six-pack) with wide availability. That's a winning combination.","ryan1788a5","Jul 08, 2012"

I have had many more Lagunitas since, so I don't think it would hold that throne any longer. But its' a good beer, for sure. I'd say, as DIPAs go, it leans more toward the malty sweet Maharaja type, but without as much body, richness, or caramel malt. It's not a typical Sand Diego style hop bomb at all, but the simpler grain bill gives it a cleaner canvas for the hops to perform upon. But the hops, to me, are more flavor focused than bittering. I'll have it again.","sprucetip","Jun 29, 2012"

Not much life to the bubbles. Smell is all citrus, with some bubblegum and some underlining biscuit malt scent spewing outward. A lot of grapefruit with mango. Taste is pretty subdued. The malt takes forth and takes over what looks to be a nice citrus bomb. I get it, but not the citrus burst i crave. Some mango, orange and grapefruit mixed in with malt and a hit of alcohol toward the end of the glass. Feel is medium and not as syrupy as some other DIPA's that I have had. A small amount of alcohol is in the aftertaste with biscuit flavor, A nice attempt at this beer, but not on the top tier list. I will find a fresh ass bottle and review that when I get a chance to compare.","BARFLYB","Apr 17, 2012"

Taste is immediately citric - oranges and lemon, then a very ample malt infusion subdues the bitterness, and loads in some feathery sugar notes, finally a bit of pine resin surfaces and slight lingering bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is great, it holds together well and has just about perfect carbonation. An interesting beer, not as hoppy-bitter as I'd expect from a DIPA labeled Maximus, but its got some nice hop flavors and is a good drinking beer nonetheless.","JackieTH","Apr 03, 2012"

Citrus hops are dominant, but malts make their presence known. There's a nice bite to the finish and a tingly mouthfeel.

I really like the fact that this beer makes all the right moves where other double IPAs tend to misstep: It's not overly syrupy, it doesn't overwhelm with too much bitterness at the close, and it doesn't allow the higher alcohol content to translate into a boozy taste.

There's a slight hint of spice in the mid-palate, with a touch of malty sweetness on the back-end. Much the same way that DFH 90 Min is a hoppy yet sweeter style IPA than the 60 Min, this Maximus brew is a little bit on the sweet side. Despite being rated at over 70 IBUs, the Lagunitas Maximus DIPA is quite easy to drink, and verges on refreshing.","TheCorkStopsHere","Jan 23, 2012"

The tast was refreshing...had a nice hoppy bite but not pucker-up bitter. It tasted like a pine forest smells. Unlike other IPAs I've had this one was even a bit sweet - probably due to the 8.2% Alc. The action swirled around the back of my tongue and throat and descended all the way to my toes with warmth rebounding to the top of my head. I've drank a 22oz bottle during this review...time to go get another!","RedBiddy","Dec 02, 2011"

A one inch slight off white head, that settles after a minute, to a nice foamy film. Pretty lacing, not in excess. Smell is tons of citrus, pineapple, mango, tangerine, pine, and grass. Taste is all of that, with a wallup of grapefruit in the finish, oh boy. Body is on the thinner side for the style and that makes it so drinkable. This is a great beer and a great price. Plus a freshness on bottle dated 298. Lagunitas rarely fails. DIPA six packs, less than $10, less than a mile way, Merry Christmas to me.","SawDog505","Nov 18, 2011"

Feel is medium, I actually more sweetness on the tongue than bitter hops. The taste is far sweeter than expected and I'm not sure if the beer is older but the hops aren't very predominate, I get a load of malty sweetness, the after taste is a little grapefruit hops which is nice and it lingers for a while.

This beer is the same way it has the sweetest at the start then the bitterness kicks in in full flavor. But since the next sip you get sweetest at the start it doesnt make you cottonmouth halfway threw. Like some dipa or ipa might have. Drank it in a glass by bonfire so didnt notice the color to much but its the taste that matters anyways.

Lots of citrus and hops. Slightly carbonated. Feels bubbly on the tongue. Nice overall. Has a bit of a strange after taste. Would get a bit old after awhile.

To get a decent head you have to get aggressive with the pour but when done right the look of the beer is excellent. Smell is soapy then sweet and finally piney, smells like it is gonna be spectacular. The taste is exactly like the nose with a hint of citrus that is not noticeable in the scent only not as forward as you would expect. It's a bit less powerful than the smell suggests but I really like this beer as I have returned to it many times. I would rate the beer higher if it was classified as a a regular IPA but it need a bit more to be concidered a DIPA. Regardleas most of lagunitas stuff is A or higher IMO.","jizfiasco","Jun 27, 2011"

The taste is a pretty nice citrus hoppiness with a sticky malt sweetness. The hop flavor is pretty basic not a whole lot of depth and/or variation. The mouthfeel is sticky and a little slick. I really can't stand a slick on my pallet. The slickness detracts from any potential for crispness and "refreshing or quenching" attributes.

The smell is piney, yet citrusy, with notes of grapefruit and some cinnamon following the malt backbone. The taste is hoppy, but I definitly cant tell this beer is clocking in at 72.41 IBUS as the malt sweetness balances the hops out nicely making for a smotth taste with some bite. The alcohol is not apparent in the taste either, and makes this beer dangerously drinkable. For such a large beer, the mouthfeel is pleasently smooth and balanced with a slight lingering hop bitterness upon termination. Overall, I am very pleased with this offering. Great example of a double IPA. I always seem to be pleased with the offerings from lagunitas.","dcook11","Apr 19, 2011"

The pine and orange hop flavors kind of clash with each other and they just don't seem to work well with the caramel malt. It seems like the caramel is too dark to work well with the malt and it covers the hops while also bringing out their harsher qualities. I have had more than a few excellent hoppy beers from Lagunitas and was expecting more of the same from this one, which makes it all the more of a disappointment that Maximus was as unremarkable as it was.

Green hops and peppery notes on the nose, with some citrusy (orange and grapefruit) highlights. Creamy smooth body, the beer has a sweet malt backbone with heavy pepper and hopped overtones that hit the back of the tongue. Citrus tones again help to balance all of the flavors. Slightly sour and bitter aftertaste, with hops puckering the tip of the tongue. Lingering finish, yet still smooth. Very easy to drink, and pretty tasty on top of that.","GarthDanielson","Mar 03, 2011"

Not bad by any means, but it's definitely not what I was expecting with the name and a description that claimed it would "strip the enamel" from my teeth. This would be a good introduction to the style for someone having doubts about whether or not they can handle it. It's like a Double IPA with training wheels.","jporf911","Feb 27, 2011"

Considering this is a west coast IPA, I was expecting more hops and more pine notes...but I get a lot of citrus and malt. I get grapefruit and pineapple along with sweet malts. A lot of sweet malty flavors. The bitterness is not "in you face" at all and the hops are there, but not the main attraction. I know this bottle isn't very old either... Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy and full-bodied. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a very tasty beer. I was just expecting something a little more hoppy and bitter.

Sweet thick malts mix in with the tropical, grapefruit, flowery and fruity loop type hops. I'm glad the store next to me just started offering this so I know it'll be fresh for a couple months now.

Medium bodied with little carbonation as expected. Goes down a bit chalky and dry, but has a slightly creamy core.

Pours a dark amber bronze with copper hues, a sliver of eggshell white head, and strands of lacing on the tulip. Smell is piny and floral hops, barley, a touch of toast, citrus fruit (lime?), liquor, butter, and toffee. Pretty standard DIPA aroma, albeit a little malt-forward. Taste follows the nose with some taffy and caramel sweetness upfront, burnt sugar, pineapple, and bubblegum mid-palate, and a grassy, citric hop bitterness to end. A small trace of acidic tartness accompanies the aftertaste. Simple flavour for the style but still very appealing. Mouthfeel is creamy-smooth, fuller than medium bodied, silky middle with a boldly bitter spiciness on the tongue and semi-dry finish. A respectable Imperial India Pale Ale, and fairly enjoyable overall, even if it's not a world beater. Worth a try if you ask me.","cratez","Nov 28, 2010"

4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Amber orange in color, with a tan-to-white head with decent retention, especially for an IPA. Pleasant aromas of orange, other citrus, and some sweet malt. Malt flavors create a smooth, sweet flavor to balance slightly bitter, but not overpowering hops and citrus. I think the citrus flavors tend more toward oranges (combining with the sweet malt for an orange-creme effect), then transition in more bitter grapefruit flavors. Medium bodied, with mild carbonation. Good drinkability for the style, although that means maxing out at two bottles.","malloyca","Sep 12, 2010"

I must admit I'm not all that concerned about a "weaker" DIPA as long as the flavor delivers, and unfortunately, the flavor is a bit too one dimensional to be truly great. This is a decent DIPA, but if you are looking for an IPA/DIPA from Lagunitas, go for their Hop Stoopid or the IPA. I guess 2 out of three ain't bad.","OttoBomb","Mar 07, 2010"

Wonderful flavors of an IPA with sweet aftertaste, which is indicative of a Lagunitas brew. Hops come out in the initial touch to tongue but move towards sweetness- very little if any bitter aftertastes.

The flavors are all backwards for a DIPA: malt overwhelms the hops, sweetness overwhelms the bitterness. it is light for a DIPA, and a little over-carbonated in my opinion (especially since the emphasis is on the malts and not the hops). Drinkability is great due to its being on the light side, but the beer as a whole does nothing to give it a boost. disappointed with this one, especially since lagunitas has been blowing my mind lately. oh well, if you're not Stone, you can't do everything perfectly can you?","jdklks","Jun 27, 2009"

At it's price ($11 for a 6 at my local market), it's not going to become my Torpedo killer but I'd drink it any day of the week given the opportunity. Lagunitas makes a good brew.

Sweet honey and sweets malts also vaguely come through at the finish of the nose. The flavor is much the same with peach and apricot dominating the flavor profile. Sweet malts follow through with just a slight alcohol burn on the finish. I'm surprised that so much boozy flavor comes through in a beer that's only 7.5%. The mouthfeel is surprisingly sweet.

Produced a thick off white head that had fine retention and left some clumps of froth and a lot of lacing. The aroma was extremely hoppy, very citrusy in the aromas that it gives off. For me it is reminiscent of grapefruit but with other hop aromas also there. Malt is there but I am having a hard time identify its aroma properties but think it is caramel and slightly roasted. The flavor is pretty much all about the hops but they are not overbearing as the flavoring they give is excellent. Those hop flavors seem to be all orange and grapefruit, not picking up to much in the way of pine. Also there is the malts, the malt here comes out more and is more distinguishable than in the nose as you can taste a nice underlying caramel. Overall this was a nice brew, I would say that as I got close to the end I did get tired of this one and was ready to move on. Though I say this I did like this brew and would get it again.

Mouthfeel is fairly light, finishing dry- but unlike a few West Coast IPAs I've tried, this isn't a total hop bomb. Though bitter, there is still some balance here. Grassy hop aftertaste.

Sweet nose of orange peel, lemon peel, pinch of baking spices, malty but not roasted, tightens up well as the scents dissolve. Medium-bodied, heaviest during the attack, here adds in some bitter hoppiness to counterbalance the malt, chocolate sweetness alongside the orange/tangerine citrus, ginger, brioche breadiness.

The label lists 72.41 IBUs, pretty low for a 2IPA. First sip... wow, lots of hop punch, but balanced with a citric sweetness and some malt towards the end. Finishes long, honey/malty, and bitter. Perfect mouthfeel- sticky malt with adequate carbonation. Really, really enjoyable IPA, the best new IPA I've tried in months.

The hops are a bit tart, which is enjoyable, with citrus and pine flavors. There's some balancing malt, but it's just not strong enough. Otherwise, the beer is good.

4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Update - On cask (02-13-13) Enjoyed at the Grill Next Door this cask ale shows a pretty golden amber, clear with a generous white head and chunky lacing to spare. The aroma brings a nice blend of citrus and tropical fruit with a nutty malt aspect and a bit of alcohol. The flavor brings on much the same with a pleasant blend including mango, pineapple and banana with subtle grass and lemon hop edges. There's a little woodsy pine and tea bread ideas. All of this presented in a medium bodied brew with modest but decent carbonation for a cask ale and a slick, somewhat heavy feel.","Durge","Jul 09, 2008"

Contains sharp, floral, citric hops with some spices in it and some type of malt (coffee, cocoa?) that led to a dryness and flavor punch in the middle.

This is a great brew that I would seek out next season, it taste a lot different to me than the 07 version. I noticed the six pack said 7.5 abv and the bottle said 8.4 so I guess they are not wasting those old 6 pack containers, thats green and good.

Lots of bitter, citrusy flavors mesh well with the sweet honey-like malts. Mouthfeel was slick, oily and smooth. Very easy to put down several of these at one sitting.

Nose is fairly mild, some caramel malt and dry hops. Taste is similar, a lot milder than any other DIPA I've tried. Caramel malt comes through first, oddly enough, and then the piney hops show up. Feel is fairly average, medium body with good carbonation. Overall, this one's alright, although for the style it's a bit of a weakling. I'm not sure why they don't just call this one a regular old IPA. At 7.5% ABV, it's right in the higher IPA range.","soupyman10","Feb 26, 2008"

This is not an in your face IPA. Other reviewers were wanting more out of this, but the gentle bitterness is a standout for me. Probably Simcoe and other gentle giants making this a VERY drinkable beer that still hits you with lots of hoppy goodness. Not the harsh grapefruit pith one comes to expect form the heavy duty IPA's.

Balancing sweetness is subdued with a sweet bread like flavor. Mouthfeel is dominated by the clean bitter pine. Dry. I found this to be an extremely enjoyable DIPA.

There's a also good lingering hoppy bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit oily and dry. Drinkability is good, it goes down easy and the alcohol isn't very noticable.

Opens with the floral/herbal bouquet, which gives way slowly to a citrus finish, with a long grapefruit kiss lingering on the palate. Malts are pretty nondescript, and don't quite provide the needed depth with a milder DIPA like this one. Mouthfeel is good, nice body and plenty of carbonation, and drinkability is excellent.

3,-24.6,3,3,3,3,3,"This Lagunitas brew poured a dark rusted copper color with a glimmer of sunshine yellow at the bottom of the beer. It had a small quarter of an inch head of white foam that quickly dissipated away into a few white and foamy rings and a spatter of fizzy white bubbles that acted as its lace. The aroma was a bit on the light side featuring some citrus hops, a pine tree, a pinch of caramel malts, and some grapefruit that had some orange zest behind it. When it warms up a bit, a slight aroma of sweet juicy fruits emerges from the background. For something they say is brewed with hops, malt, hops, hops, yeast, hops water, and hops, it's actually quite tame in the bitter department. It was hoppy, but not that hoppy. Behind the tame citrus hops is some pine, grapefruit, and some toasted malt. It only had a small aftertaste of citrus hops and pine. This has to be one of lightest DIPA I've had so far. In the massive world of IPAs, this one needs to stick out a little more because it's easily forgettable in that world. In you want to get into the world of DIPAs or any kind of IPAs, then you should start off with this one, due to it being a very mild IPA or DIPA. For me, this one is enough.

The hop aroma is a blend of fruity Cascade and Chinook; with matching Simcoe pine needle. Some crystal and pilsener malt aromas loom in the background. Toasty pale malt and light caramel make up the sweet side of a very hoppy beer and for a brief moment the malt commands the flavor, then a barrage of american hops storm the taste buds - abrasively balancing the overall charater. Lemon, orange, and grapefruit-rind tones meet pine sap and grass clippings. But it never overwhelms; the aftertaste is drying- but more of a showcase of hop character than senseless IBU's. Medium-body and mild carbonation accentuate the oily mouthfeel and allow a residual sweetness to accompany the delicious hop resins that coat the tounge. The drinkability of this beer really shines; a Barleywine-caliber complexity that you can knock back like a session IPA.","PBRstreetgang","Mar 24, 2007"

It's no hop monster at this stage in its life, but instead is a well-balanced and drinkable IPA.

Smells is at first hops right in the kettle, grape fruit, grass, pine, sour orange juice, the underlying hints of malt are there as it warms, but they are completely overshadowed by hop aroma. Taste is slightly astringent with light citrus notes not unsimilar to bitter orange juice from concentrate. Malt is present but only in that it provides for the grounds for hop to work, although Id personally like a bit more fruit complexity from the hops. The flavor coats the tongue and lingering on the side of the cheeks. I enjoy this, but I find it just another in the long line of enjoyable IPA/ double IPA. Personally I need a little more to woo me.

4.23,6.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a nice dark amber with a light tan head that starts out thick and leaves decent lacing. The smell is of spicy and fruity hops with stone fruit predominating. The taste is grainy with a good malt background and with a pronounced grapefruit pith bitterness thats balanced by all the malt. Definitely a maltier version than most dipas. The mouthfeel is a little thick and grainy, it feels substantial in your mouth. This hurts the drinkability a bit, as it definitely fills you up. Still a solid beer, and for the price a great value.","Georgiabeer","Dec 28, 2006"

Aroma of C-hops is quite powerful with lots of citrus and floral notes. Taste is quite bitter with huge citrus and floral hops with a big grassy feel. Malt is more subdued then I would have liked it with limited caramel. Body is about average with medium carbonation.

It smells of white grapefruit with a malty background and hints of tropical fruits and apricot. There is a big bitterness with a good malt backing and flavors of leafy/green hops, apricot, biscuity malts, faint tropical fruit, lingering hop oils, and a sweetness that creeps in near the end. It has a sturdy mouthfeel that is lightly numbing and drying, with prickly carbonation that seems almost artificial on top of a medium body that has a fairly long finish. Overall it's tasty enough, but the mouthfeel is a bit awkward, as it took an hour for the carbonation to smooth out enough to be tolerable.","mmmbeer","Aug 28, 2006"

Subtle alcohol in the nose. I get similar flavors in the taste with caramel and malt leading off. The citrus from the hops hit first in my mouth and each sip finishes with a lingering of hop bitterness and piney hops. Body is moderate but could be more substantial, I think.

Long lasting bitter aftertaste that has a flavor not unlike chewing on a piece of hay. Mouthfeel is dry with some slickness...a little different.

Perhaps this brew is missing a bit of warmth and fullness, akin to lets say, Arrogant Bastard, but this is in no way a criticism.

The taste followed the scents with a very bitter overall taste that had a nice bite to it. Grapefruit-like hops seem to dominate with a floral accent. Slightly chewy texture in my mouth with a lingering bitter finish. Biggest flaw with this beer is the lack of complexity. I think more malt (pale perhaps) would add depth and layers to the flavor and bring more the surface than just hops.

4.28,7.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"This beer poured a cider/honey honey color with a nice off white head that fell to a incredibly uneven film that left some very nice lace. Smells of dry, sour cherries and plumb skin along with a musky, earthy hop. Upon my first sip a powerful rush of pine zipped in around the base of my tongue. That was unique. In the remainder of the flavor, the pine flavors really dominate right into the smooth finish. Hop-burps reiterate the same fantastic pungent pine. The hops also lend a nice sweeter orange to the overall flavor. The malt supporting this pine maelstrom is very subtle with just the slightest hint of caramel and smoky marshmallow that leaves my mouth just a bit sticky in the finish. The mouth feel is medium bodied with a smooth, almost creamy carbonation that leaves the tip of my tongue tingling. If you are enthralled by the piney elements of hops, this beer is a must. Im not a card carrying hop-head, but I thought this beer was original and very well crafted. Also, I must say Im getting some of the best hop-burps Ive ever had.

3.83,-3.8,4.5,4,4,4,3,"Maximus comes in the 650ml brown bottle, with another one of their relatively nondescript labels, with large black and green lettering. The give-you're-head-a-shake stories on the sides of the bottle are always diverting though(and they make more sense after a couple bottles). If it were not for them, the Lagunitas labels would be extremely boring. Maximus pours very agreeably, forming a rich bed of beige-yellowish foam. The underlying bubbles are a little larger, but the consistency of the foam viewed from the top is compact and ice-cream like. Thin lacing, but it clung well and formed paint-like splotches. The beer is dark rust in colouration; equal parts orange and red. Lighter than an amber, but darker than most pale ales. At first the liquid appears quite limpid, but there is a very fine haziness upon closer examination, and as you pour the last bit you can see the sediment clearly floating in the beer. Delightful looking brew. The first sniff after pouring the beer is quite malty, but as the head lessens and the beer breathes a little, the expected dark-wood spicy hops assert themselves. The beer is quite balanced to me though: instead of the hops being dominant in the aroma, the malting holds its own against them, as evidenced by the inescapable sugary sweetness throughout. I will say that the hops DO increase in magnitude the more the beer sits and aerates. The aroma is a little similar to Brown Shugga'. Other aromas include some milkiness, maple syrup, pepper, tree bark, and a great woodiness from the hopping. Raisins, definite dried prunes, figs, and a faint hit of vodka-like alcohol lurking underneath. Plenty of complexity to be had. The west-coast hops add all sorts of earthy vinous notes: spice-filled and warming. Sometimes cinnamon-like, sometimes seasoning salt in nature. As expected, the hops really do define the taste of Maximus. The aroma does not suggest the astringent dryness of the taste. The malt is just as present as the hops in the SMELL, but the taste changes all that: on the tip of the tongue, save a small bit of white-sugar sweetness, the woody hops start to add their bitterness. By the middle the cinnamon and grapefruit and lemon are all there, and the finish is dizzyingly dry, at first. The finish is all about mouth-puckering. After sipping, though, the dryness lessens. The taste is not as filled with nuances as the aroma, but still very tasty and full of flavours like burnt toast, mollasses, pomegranate seeds, honeycomb, toffee, ground coffee, and a strong metallic presence, like copper. The malting, when it can be appreciated, is very syrupy. Everything hides behind the massively bitter finish, though. This is extremely low in carbonation, feeling slick and oily on the tongue. Full bodied and quickly warming. Whilst I love to try these, the inherent problem is the lack of solid drinkability--for me, these Double IPAs will never be good session beers, and will never surpass a good amber or even a balanced IPA for quaffability. These will be the exceptions, not the rules. I love them, but would no more drink them daily than I would eat blue cheese, caviar and roast beef every day. A lovely beer to try though, even if not as jaw-droppingly hoppy as might be expected from the DIPA categorisation. And yes, the dryness stays in the mouth almost endlessly unless you pair Maximus with something like aged cheddar. The sharpness softened the hop-bite, and the cheddar added some new tastes.","Cwrw","Nov 08, 2005"

Not an aggressive beer at all, it strikes a good balance that makes it quite drinkable.","DrJay","Jun 23, 2005"

The body throughout this brew is fairly creamy and full, and the finish to this brew is simply excellent with a really nice citrusy, spicy, bitter finish.

The taste is a touch sweeter than others of this variety (I2PA, Ruination, Dreadnaught); it's quite good, with skeletal malts, but it lacks that grapefruity bite that a double often produces (a plus or minus depending upon your preference, I suppose).

Taste gives you a shot of some nice malt, but quicky gets to the point of the DIPA, piney hops, with a slight citrus character. Mouthfeel is and drinkability are both good for the style.

The nose was big, fresh, and juicy with a well-developed grapefruit-lime citric and resinaceous (pine) hop bouquet. A perfumy maltiness backed things up nicely. The taste presented a rich and peppery melon-citrus-brown sugur tinged malt profile that carried aloft a spicy-pine-citric zest hoppiness which increased in intensity into the wonderful and perfectly bittered finish. Some spicy brown sugar flavors was carried through into the lingering notes. Pricks of tartness here and there add extra interest and balance. The body was creamy and very smooth, feeling like a soft down pillow in the mouth...really quite nice for the flavors/character of the beer. Overall this is a great brew, and a fantastic deal at $3 a pop, or $2.50 on sale in my case.

3.63,-8.8,4.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"A hazy copper color, pours a bit on the thick side with an off cream to tan colored head that is fairly thick and lasting. A hoppy aroma with notes of fruit and citrus, perhaps some aromas of a blooming field of some type of flower. A full mouth-feel, quite thick for an IPA, even for a strong one. This was yester-years American Barley-Wine. The hops are there, but not as up front as I was expecting. A sort of orange-nectar hop flavor. This beer is quite malty as well. Lightly sweet, which gives this beer a hop nectar type taste. This beer was not as bitter or hoppy as I was expecting. It is pretty good though. I is a bit too thick for my taste though.","Gueuzedude","Oct 26, 2003"
4.48,12.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"What a beautiful beer! This one poured a gorgeous amber color with a perfectly foamy white head. I must also note, the bottle was very cool indicating not only the ABV but the IBU's and the OG. The beer had a wonderful hoppy citrus scent with a healthy dose of pine and a great malt sweetness. The taste was incredably smoothe and more balanced than I thought it would be. There were a lot of hops for sure, but they were not overberaring and were balanced out wonderfuly by the malt, slight peppery spice and the silky smoothe mouthfeel. At 7.5%, this beer could do some serious dammage, but it is so easy to drink that I just might have to take that risk!","Dmann","Oct 18, 2003"

These west coasters sure do know how to hop a beer! Aroma: Huge citrus and pine tones flood the senses but the just as massive amount of malt in this beer is prevalent in the scent very rich and fulfilling on all levels what a beer. This beer is as heavenly as the ocean breeze it's just way to nice, a smell that is all by itself a must try. Taste: Honey syrup tones lie beneath a wave of juicy hop citrus and pine and earthy goodness what a friggin beer we have here. So many layers of hops within the beer yet so complex with malt sweetness and don't get me started on the texture. Mouthfeel: Full bodied as they come with chewy texture gelatinou head adds to this experience there are proteins and texture in the foam by itself whenn blended with the beer, all I can say is wow. Drinkability: Despite all of these huge massive tones of flavor, aroma, appearance, this beers drinkability is increased by the complexity alone and once you taste and fully enjoy this cherished beer than you'll be able to relate to this review seek this one out yet this is an original experience from beginning to end of the beer.","WVbeergeek","Sep 18, 2003"

4.28,7.5,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"A brilliant, crystal-clear amber body reveals deep gold highlights when held to the light. Its short head of creamy off-white foam holds well before dropping to a thin surface covering; and leaves some very nice lace throughout the glass. Perfumey, floral, citrusy (mild grapefruit) and piney hops greet you in the nose over a delicate, caramel-laced malt. It's quite engaging and very welcoming; although not as brash as some of the bolder IPA's tend to be! Nice! The body is medium and it's lightly crisp in the mouth. All of the variety of hops found in the aroma dominate the flavor profile; and it's caramel-laced and biscuity malt acts as support. It's exceptionally well-balanced for such a boldly hopped beer. It boasts a 7.5% alcohol content and it displays a bold, drying bitterness that carries over into the aftertaste with some lingering hop flavor. Overall, it's a very clean and straightforward American IPA that maintains a great deal of balance and offers a clean, fresh, hoppy, and malty character! Impressive! One to try.","NeroFiddled","Aug 15, 2003"

Fresh squeezed grapefruit. Taste and smell are spot on for a west coast IPA. Sticky, resiny, and earthy bitter hop flavor and slightly toasted malt undertones. A touch less hoppy, but more full malt backbone than the Bear Republic version I had last night. Not sure if that's either good or bad. Hop freshness cleanses the palate and leaves a bitter, crisp finish on the tongue. Puckering hole on the tongue. Crisp and clean, medium bodied, and very tasty. I had this with grilled chicken spinich salad with grated horseradish cheese. Very good taste and well worth the effort to track down.","StevieW","Aug 07, 2003"

Initially light body with a quick smooth malt flavor followed by a decent floral hop spice. The body barely helps emphasize the malt by the light texture creates an easy drinking ale.

4.32,8.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"After spending Saturday night drinking Stone IPA on tap in San Diego, I popped a bomber of Maximus in the comfort of my own home on a late Sunday afternoon and was quite pleasantly surprised. It pours more or less standard issue IPA color: golden with a hint of orange. The head is white and foamy and leaves a little layer on top of the beer to the bottom of the glass. The smell is aggressively hoppy but not overwhelmingly so. Aromas of grapefruit and pine float over the glass. In the first few drinks, the hops really seemed to dominate, but things come together nicely after that. Underlying the hop bitterness is a nice sweetness that becomes a bit more pronounced as the beer warms. The mouthfeel is good, and it goes down well for a beer if its ABV and IBU. This is my favorite Lagunitas so far.","mickeymac","Mar 09, 2003"

4.27,7.3,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Another Big Bad Boy from Lagunitas, and a challenger to Stones great line of IPAs. The color of the beer as it breathes away in the glass is a murky golden amber and the head preposterous in size, frothy in its texture as it degrades; it leaves a thick sheet of lace to cover the glass. Hops dominate the nose, with the underlying malt and citrus crispness I so admire in quality IPAs, what a pleasure for the senses. It starts sweet and the top middling in mouth feel and the finish all Hops, with a moderate carbonation and a droughty aftertaste, another winner in my humble opinion from a great brewery.","Gusler","Dec 22, 2002"
4.04,1.5,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Hazy bright oxidized copper color with a gusher of a head. Tames in about a minute to 1/4 of an inch and foam laces respectably. Hoppy aroma, oily and gravelly citrus rinds that set the nose hairs off. Hopped-up flavor, but not four alarm burning -- more of a sense of candied orange rinds that sit at one high level of bitterness. There is an underpinning of brown sugar malts in this beer that is more noticeable on warming. Finishes slightly thin, but refreshing...a nice bomber, here.","ADR","Dec 19, 2002"

Strong floral hops in the aroma with notes of lemon and orange peel. The I.B.U. is a 72.41, so as you might expect, its quite bitter. Hop resins dominate the flavor with notes of tart, fresh grapefruit. A definite treat for hopheads out there.

Grapefruit and slightly perfumy hop nose upfront, but a wave of slightly tart fruity esters follows.  Light caramel malt sweetness is perceptible in the aroma as the brew warms and the hop oils dissapate, but is still overshadowed by the classic citrusy hop nose. Very aromatic.  Although assertively bitter, it isn't cloyingly so, and yeast fruitiness, light caramel and biscuit / victory malt is discernible and well - integrated.  Tastewise, it is reminecent of a grapefruit w/ brown sugar sprinkles.  A touch of butterscotch adds complexity.  A tad thin in body, but otherwise a fine IPA.  Finishes surprisingly sweet and crisp, almost light on the tongue.  Although not quite as good as some other "double" IPAs, Maximus is still a well - crafted and appetizing brew-- it's a bit too drinkable and could catch up to you if you love hops.","marc77","Jul 24, 2002"

Contrary to what someone wrote on this page, I did not find the mouthfeel syrupy -- just crisp and refreshing.  The 7.5% abv was well-disguised.
