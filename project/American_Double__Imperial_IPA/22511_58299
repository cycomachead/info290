5,7.8,5,5,5,5,5,"My favorite beer to date.  Opague amber orange, nice lacing but the difference maker with Abner is the nose.  Holy shit!  Huge mango nose and pretty much any other citrus and tropical fruit you can think of.  Smell is beyond a 5.  Taste follows and although slightly boozy at the finish it's still absolutely crushable.  I can't get enough of this beer when I'm in VT and my mornings suffer as a result.  I can go on and on about Abner but you'll just have to try it yourself.  If you are heading up to VT with the highest expectations and you fear that as a result Abner may be a slight letdown what will likely happen is it will be better than you could've imagined.  It's that good.","HopDeezy","Mar 31, 2015"

When leaving the brewery... and not knowing when I'll get to try this brew again... left me feeling a bit empty.  It is everything it is said to be... simply awesome. Having to hunt this stuff down for one glass... keeps me from ranking this a 5 across the board. This is a beer that should be #1... but will never be... because it won't reach enough mouths to experience such a piece of beauty in a beer. The fact that it is a 12 here... is only data... purely data.","fulcrumbs","Mar 30, 2015"

Abner is the holy grail and well worth the drive into the NEK of Vermont, regardless of where you're coming from.

This is up there with heady, and with it's raw character and perfect balance, it's safe to say that it can give heady a run for its money.","gcamparone","Beers"

Huge green nose with spruce tips, grapefruit rind, and almost a dankness/ditchweed character.  The beer has just enough sweetness and drinks like liquid hops.  Minimal bitterness cold, while there's a bitter kick at the end as it gets closer to room temperature.  Absolutely world class.  The body is so clean, and the mouthfeel is so smooth.

Rather, it invites you in to savor all the layers of flavor and fermentation expertise that go into the beer. The somewhat tame nose confounded me somewhat, but the experience of actually drinking this beer is one not soon forgotten.","hail_seitan","Jul 07, 2014"

It is one of the best hoppy beers from Hill Farmstead outside of Societe and Solitude #6 and Susan, of the ones I have had.","dar482","Mar 19, 2014"

Poured from tap into a tulip glass at Prohibition Pig in Waterbury, Vermont. Deep orange/amber color and expected cloudiness. On the nose, the scent of citrus pine was easily overwhelmed by grapefruit/orange scents. On the palate, hops assert and the malts were nicely subdued. On the palate, the theme repeats itself, with a nice, clean hoppy burn on the end. The mouthfeel is more than drenching full/substantial. I think I like this well-crafted monster (dare I say it) better than the infamous Heady Topper of similar profile. All in all, a remarkably fabulous experience!","JohnParadee","Feb 01, 2014"

Pours a murky yellow/orange. Small head but great lacing left on the glass. The smell isn't overwhelming but it's very pleasant. Citrus is dominant. The taste is very well balanced. The citrus and grass/pine mesh well and nothing specific stands out. There is a nice slight bitterness, and it's not too sweet. Carbonation has held well. Mouthfeel is creamy, medium bodied, and spot on, like most HF ipas. This has to be my favorite HF beer, if not my favorite of all time. It's so easy to drink with so much flavor. Abv is hidden very well.","Mikeypnh","Oct 12, 2013"

I also get some of the honey flavor; presumably from a light malt. The color also hints that they used lighter malts. Mouthfeel was a tad thin, but I did enjoy the hop 'sting' on the tongue.

While the nose gives a strong, balanced, juicy rendition of the liquid to come, the ultimate taste is astonishing from that first sip. The hops remain dripping wet, sweet, and juicy, but take on a curiously strong bitterness of grapefruity rind and citrics. The yeast works its way in giving bitterness, along with that harder well water that is so apparent, but seamlessly inclusive. The feel on the sip gives just about all you could ask for, with frothy brushes of creaminess and enough pucker to wake you up. This is a must have from Hill Farmstead, and well deserved of the reputation it has thus far attained.","TheBrewo","Jun 28, 2013"

I get a bit of that sauteed onion and garlic with fresh herbs type of impression right after the initial citrus juice impression, but it fades on the finish. Super smooth bitterness here, very drinkable 8% IPA!","BeerZack","Jun 06, 2013"

4.96,6.9,4.75,5,5,4.75,5,"O - Hill Farmstead prides themselves on making hop forward pale ales, and this is a shining example of their craft. Not like many of the Imperial IPA's you see out there that seem to have either bitterness or sweetness turned up to ten. As they classify this as an Imperial Pale Ale, I see this designation most fitting. You get the best of a nice clean pale ale with the best of a Imperial IPA showing off its hop muscles. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone as this is a beer that transcends all tastes. Impeccable...","nesarebad","May 31, 2013"

I don't want to say it is less complex than Heady, but I would say it doesn't try so hard to highlight every single hop known to man....and as my gf states "it doesn't make your face feel like its being blasted off with hops)... what it does is take a large amount of hops, balances them extremely well, keeps them in check with natural carbonation, still bursts forward with amazing aromas and adds a little of that special "ingredient" that makes HF worth that never ending drive... a very well made beer that lives up to the hype that the brewers have tried so hard to get away from....

Hops for days hits you in the face and it hurts so good. I think of this as a perfect mix between Lawsons doub sunshine (more tropical) and Heady Topper (more citrus). I found a perfect mix between citrus and tropical fruit, however that hoppyness took the cake. I pick up on some more earthy resinous tastes that I quire enjoy, but not as much as some DIPAs- well ballanced I was fortunate to drink it fresh as hell so the carbonation was on point.

Smell is excellent; very hoppy, tending more towards the citrusy side, but it's complex. Tastes very much like the smell. It's full of hops, but well balanced with a bit of malt. It's not overly bitter, but not even close to sweet. Mouthfeel is outstanding; Full, with real body, perfectly carbonated. Overall, this beer is all about balance.

A vigorous swirl regenerates the head and washes away the lacing. The nose has a subtle hoppiness that's slightly floral and citrusy followed by a modest sweetness. The taste manages to pack in even more flavor that reminds me of a cleaner, more drinkable heady topper (...which seems insane to say). The beer has an absolute perfect balance between hop fruitiness, bitterness, and sweetness from the malt and added sugars. The aftertaste is slightly citrusy and bitter and finishes semi-dry as a gush of carbonation carries the beer down into the depths of my innards. This beer is certainly world class and worth trying...but I can't see it being bottled for the masses.","ThePorterSorter","Feb 07, 2013"

The alcohol is noticeable in this one but it integrates quite nicely. Of the hoppy HF offerings I have had lately, I give this one a slight edge over the others for having a bit more distinguishable character.

4.54,-2.2,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"From the source, 1 week old. Looks like other Hill hoppy beers I've had. Opaque, sort of orangeish deep honey. One finger white head. Not much if any lacing. The aroma is so complex. Pine, citrus, dank wet hops, almost earthy dirty grit. Very green hop aroma. Pretty insanely complex flavour to match the complex aroma. Citrusy, pithy, and well yes bitter. Abner is a little dank. The biggening is all hops, then you get some malty quality. There is certainly a little crystal malt in here adding a hint of sweetness to balance the hop assault. On my palate this beer is full, juicy from the hops, and well rather good. Could be a hint more dry. Overall this is a tad sweet for me, but that is the only thing I could possible say to take away from how awesome this beer is. Balance, huge hops, great balance, top notch.","pmlondrigan","Aug 04, 2012"

The aroma reminds me of the Ephraim, I pick up some mango, tangerine, pineapple, and some grass. The flavor sure reminds me of the Ephraim as the aroma clearly suggested at the beginning. Sweet pines, some lemon, mango, and pineapple are detected across the tongue as well. Thin and smooth mouthfeel with excellent carbonation. This is a very dangerously drinkable DIPA from Hill Farmstead. Glad to have tried this one out!","CuriousMonk","Apr 24, 2012"
5,7.8,5,5,5,5,5,"Beer pours a beautiful hazy yellow-orange with a nice white head. The appearance makes me think of citrus fruit for some reason, and really is the perfect color for a DIPA. Smell is incredible - I get a blast of citrus fruits and amazing hops. The taste follows suit, it's really like a party in my mouth, bright citrus flavors take the lead, but this is incredibly balanced and easy to drink for a DIPA. Mouthfeel is pretty much perfect, medium-bodied with excellent carbonation a bit of tingling and even some stickiness. Overall, this really might be my favorite beer ever. I've had it countless times, but drinking it on tap is the way that this beer needs to be consumed. Some of the growlers have held up really well, others not so much, but it would only get this score from me on tap. When served straight from this tap, this beer deserves a perfect 5.0 score, the best score I've ever given to a beer on BA.","starrdogg","Apr 11, 2012"

That's not something I would say easily, simply because Elder (IMO) stands apart from almost every other DIPA out there due to the way that it captures both, the delicacy that hops can bring with their power. Abner, in my book, is the only other beer this big that does that. Juicy citrus with a melange of tropical fruit (ripe papayas, ripe mangoes, ripe oranges). A touch sweet on the mid-palate with a blend of citrus juice sweetness (from the hops) and some light caramel malt and honey. Drying on the finish with an exquisite blend of mellow bitterness and ripe, redolent fruit. Bitterness is moderate throughout, in balance with the fruity sweetness that the hops bring. Not particularly resiny either. Medium-light in body, this beer is a little too carbonated (initially at least), and has a wonderful finish. Of particular note is the lack of a green/leafy hop character that many hop-bombs end up having. Absolutely delicious, exceptional stuff, my favorite HFS beer yet.","DefenCorps","Feb 20, 2012"

There's a dry malt backbone here that does actually provide some body and heft, though it isn't a sweet beer at all.

Head faded quickly but decent lacing. Nose is tropical/citrus with very little bitterness. At first sight and smell, I am curious as to how old this keg is. The last time I was in this establishment was late April, when I tried HF Double Galaxy. I have to say the Abner was delicious but not as impressive overall as the Double Galaxy. I am still very impressed by Hill Farmstead; I just think this keg was a bit aged and muted for a highly rated DIPA.","ElGallo","Jul 27, 2011"

Little if any malt evident in the aroma, but I'm sure they did indeed use some malts in this beer. Taste is Bitter pine and earthy. Hints of caramel malt are there for a nano second but this one is all about the hops. Finishes rather dry with a long lingering spicy bitterness. Moderate carbonation, medium thin body with a resinous tart mouthfeel. I enjoyed this one, but it wasn't my favorite of the night. One curiosity is that all of the Hill beers I had were very cloudy, not sure if that is the way they are supposed to be or if we had trouble pouring.","johnnnniee","Jul 10, 2011"

Still, I get considerable dry citrus, pepper and light pine on the nose. The flavor profile replicates the nose in this dry, impressively hoppy IPA. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a fairly long, bitter finish. Alcohol is well disguised in what is another outstanding IPA from the folk at FH.

4.57,-1.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Looks like a HF IPA. Color is a hazed, murky dull golden copper with a bubbly white head from a hard pour. Adequate retention and minimal lacing, suggesting this wasn't the best growler fill. Aroma is dank pine and citrus resin with biscuit malt and minimal sweetness. Very fresh and intense. Much more sweetness in the flavor which goes a long way in balancing the intense resiny bitterness and making this beer enjoyable. Hops start tropical and juicy before turning dry, raw and piney in the finish. Carbonation is a little low given this a growler, but not as bad as I expected upon initially opening. Thick, chewy and syrupy this a much denser and filling beer than my other favorite VT DIPA at the moment, Double Sunshine. In my opinion, consistently the best east coast DIPA for those seeking an intense hoppy and resiny fix.","yourefragile","May 31, 2011"

Picture perfect appearance, a nose so good I want to take a shower in it, use it as cologne, spray it on my beds sheets, capture it in a bottle and carry it everywhere with my nose constantly propped against it. The scary part? The taste is even BETTER! How could this be possible! 9 times out of time a great nose on an IPA is led by a letdown of some degree or at least matches the nose.

Small spots of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses citrus, a floral character and light toasted malts. Taste is earthy and floral with some light bittering at the finish. There's also a slightly tart and herbal quality in the mix. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively, crisp carbonation. I have to say that I found Abner to be really quite tasty and interesting, and one of the best domestic Farmhouse Ales I've had to date.

A big blast of grapefruit, lemony citrus hops hits you instantly when smelling the beer, very nice. Taste has a lot of the grapefruit, lemon, orange again with a slight bit of pine. No hint of alcohol at all. Very tasty dipa. Great silky smooth mouth feel and perfect for the style in my opinion. I had 2 glasses and I would of had another couple if I had a DD with me. Very glad to finally try this beer and highly recommended. One of the best east coast ipa's for sure in my book.","gibby","Jan 31, 2011"
4.62,-0.4,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Huge thanks to Andrewinski1 for bringing this gem back from his Vermont trip. Four days old when we drank it! Can't beat that with a stick! The beer pours a hazy deep straw color with about a finger of creamy white head. The aroma is simply divine. Deep blood orange and tropical fruit in the aroma with a great bitter grassy hop aroma to round out the nose. Really a nice balance of bitter and sweet on both the nose and the pallet. The flavor is a lot what the nose would lead it to be. Sweet candied grapefruit zest and orange juice to the front and it finishes nicely with a complex hop flavor. Kind of a sweet caramel finish to this one. The feel is a nice medium body with good carbonation. I'm impressed at how well this held up in the growler. Overall, it's tough to get better than this one for me. I wish this was as available as Pepsi.","Bendurgin","Jan 27, 2011"

4.6,-0.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"A bitter DIPA from the East, never in a million years did I think something on this level would be produced over here. Feel is bitter, medium, with enough malt to keep things in check, no problem on the carb, Im yearning for more. There are no coasts anymore, Abner is the one, go get it.","BARFLYB","Jan 25, 2011"
4.62,-0.4,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"The carbonation held up well (the growler was filled three days ago). The body is light to medium. This is syper drinkable. Hope I can make the trek back to Vermont soon.","andrewinski1","Jan 25, 2011"

Good carbonation levels and a nice bitterness. A really tasty brew. Thanks again, Shaun.","Thorpe429","Oct 04, 2010"

4.54,-2.2,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Growler brought back from autumn fest- thanks Scott!!! Pours a bright, clear orange with a thin white head. Smells like HOPS!!! Tons of citrus. Good god, like a west coast gem, but from the VT!!!! Taste is similar - a nice citrusy start but with a fairly bitter finish. Just wonderful! Thin, light mouthfeel. Can't wait to get more of this, along with the other HF beers!","DrDogbeer","Sep 29, 2010"
4.5,-3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Wow, just another fantastic hopped-up offering here from Hill Farmstead, with bold hop flavors, impeccable balance, and a ridiculous drinkibility for the size. This took a little bit to work its magic on me but once I got into that second glass, I was a believer. I hate to sound like a full-blown mark for this new brewery, but man, I really do think that these beers are that good.","Kegatron","Sep 18, 2010"

4.42,-4.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability is great. This is one tasty DIPA. Lots of hops, some citrus notes and a good malt backbone to hold it all together without taking away from the hops. Shaun has done a great job with this beer and Vermont is really stepping up their game in the DIPA department. With Head Topper from the Alchemist, Hopzilla from Lawson's and now Abner, I think California has some good competition. Definitely grab a growler of this if you can. Highly recommended.","sisuspeed","Jun 21, 2010"
4.32,-6.9,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Super clean and wonderfully bitter, but balanced. The 8.2 is hidden like a Westy 12 in a carry-on bag. Dank and delightful. Well done, Shaun!","SFLpunk","Jun 10, 2010"
4.35,-6.3,4.5,4.5,4,4,5,"Well-balanced and subtle. It takes skill to make this style enjoyable from the tap and nothing is spared in the end result. Rivals the Alchemist.","Brad007","Jun 08, 2010"
4.52,-2.6,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"On tap at the grand opening. Pours a dark golden color with hints of orange, slightly hazy. Piney hops in the nose with a hint of malt. High hop bitterness backed up by some body and high hop flavor; slight grassy/vegetal notes. Alcohol is somewhat hidden but detectable. Finishes well and hops linger on the tongue. Tasty and enjoyable, but not quite as complex as Edward, IMO.","skivtjerry","Beers"
4.32,-6.9,4,4.5,4.25,4,4.5,"I think this one is worth another sample (mainly to see if the age of my growler played a part in my tasting experience) but I'm not even close to liking this as much as the Edward IPA.","koopa","0"
