4.8,8.8,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,5,"Poured a deep gold, slightly cloudy, with about two fingers of creamy white head, which lingered quite a while and left nice lacing. Aroma is a nice, big nose of hops; noted the peach. Taste is a nice blend of the malt sweetness and hops, again with notes of peach. Moderately carbonated, but too much so. A nice, full, mouth feel and a good drink for its big ABV.","delta490","Oct 10, 2014"

Really smooth, well integrated flavor profile and this drinks like a smaller ABV IPA, but with so much flavor, which is impressive. (4.5)","Resuin","Oct 01, 2014"

4.75,7.7,,,,,,"As you pour you can smell the bready malt and fruity, citrusy hops. It pours hazy amber with a 1” finely bubbled foam cap. This medium full bodied beer exhibits very fine soft carbonation that produces an exceptional creaminess that leaves thick lace. The surprisingly smooth palate starts with a creamy malty sweetness and then some yeast driven light fruits play with the tropical citrusy hop fruits and then the flavors dissolve into a prolonged citrus rind grapefruit bitterness that lingers. The brewer achieves a perfect balance between the big alcohol and the layers of malt and hop flavors.","pat61","Sep 10, 2014"

Flavor is bitter at first, earthy, then hoppy. Some caramel flavors. Very well balanced beer. I’m more of a hop forward type of person, but this one is still great.

4.24,-3.9,4.75,4.5,4,4.25,4.25,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a tulip glass. Appearance is a nice rich Longhorn orange with a creamy head that laced the glass...very tasty appearance. I was highly impressed by this beer's aroma...it was your typical piney-tropical profile but the medley here: mango & papaya & fresh pine really sang. The taste & mouthfeel weren't quite as immaculate as the smell but still lived up to the FFF standards one would expect. The peachy papaya flavor worked with the hoppy body, and the smoothness made the bomber an easy pleasant drinker.","ESkirv","Jun 19, 2014"

4.45,0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Served on tap at Spinoza's in Beavercreek, Ohio. The appearance is unremarkable, but with a solid head and fairly sticky lacing. The smell is tropical fruit--not as pronounced and appealing as, say, White Rajah, but still quite good. The taste consists of mango, orange, and lemon flavors, and the bitterness from the hops just isn't here--imagine, a DIPA without bitterness--instead is sweetness from the citrus hops. The mouthfeel is unusual, but not bad at all--this beer is on the thin side (it could pass for a session beer if not for the high ABV) and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a DIPA well worth trying.","DeFaz","Apr 14, 2014"
4.79,8.6,5,4.75,4.75,5,4.75,"Great beer! There is a serious complexity to this beer. While it has the hop forward properties of any other DIPA's its smooth, and without a lingering bitter finish. There is a bitterness to it, but there is a malt complexity that changes the finish to make it smooth with a hint of sweetness. This beverage got better with every sip.","ICMTM","Apr 14, 2014"

4.8,8.8,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.75,"Three Floyds Dreadnaught is an American Imperial #IPA with a 9.5 ABV~ She pours hazy, but brilliant in color, an opaque honey yellow, a color I quite never seen before~ LOADS of tiny bubbles~ Little to no head, yet moderate lacing~ Feel is light to medium, yet remarkably satisfy and surprisingly rich~ Nose is extreme Honey and Pine off the rip, Carmel and Malt linger in the back round, also all your other typical IPA Citrus/Earthy scents~ Taste is just like #heaven, Grapefruit, Honey, Mango, Biscut, Pineapple, Cream, Tangerine, Malt, Peach, Pine, Papaya, Bread and Orange~ Such a sharp, crisp, clean, well balanced, yet intense brew~ No one flavor over bares, its all delivered with a nice creamy balance What should also be mentioned is how much of a 'Malt' presence stands out in what typically is a 'Hop' forward style, awesome surprise by #3F~ 9.5 would never be guessed, as there is virtually zero burn on the back end~ Honestly, if I drowned in Dreadnaught... I would die an extremely happy man~","BrewUSA","Jan 17, 2014"

They seem to be the only ones to be able to do that so well. Lots of citrus on this beer. Again you should be careful because the alcohol is high and it is easy to drink. Good mouthfeel, strong nose of citrus styled hops, the taste is really outstanding. It also is a pretty sexy color for an IPA.","vinny21bal","Nov 25, 2013"

The feel of the beer was heavy, almost felt like syrup in the mouth, but I was able to get past that. The bitterness lasted from beginning to end with the alcohol making its presence know.

4.84,9.8,4.75,5,4.75,5,4.75,"Thanks to NW2285. Pours out of the 22 oz bomber a cloudy golden orange with a thick, three finger eggshell colored head. Nice retention with soapy lacing throughout my Spiegelau IPA glass. The aroma is heavy on hops - lots of citrus, hint of pine, with some grassy/floral notes. in addition to the wonderful hop aromas, one can also detect sweet malt and some biscuity notes.  On the front of the tongue there's sweet citrus, toffee, and bread. Dreadnaught finishes with nice bitterness with hints of tropical fruit, rose, grass and sweet malts. Full bodies with a thick mouthfeel and effervescent carbonation. Overall, if this isn't the best DIPA on the market, it's pretty close. Another homerun FFF.","JohnG190","Aug 10, 2013"

4.54,2.9,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.25,4.5,"O: Sure enough, this reminds me a lot of DFH 90-minute IPA. The hop and malt profile both feel very similar to me, except this is slightly more bitter on the finish and slightly thinner in the body. On the other hand, it does not get too cloyingly sweet as easily upon warming, which is very nice. I think for ease of acquisition, 90-minute wins out easily, but if money were not a factor, both were fresh and easily obtainable, I could see myself choosing either brew, but probably favoring the Dreadnaught. A very nice beer, to be sure.","jdhowe","Aug 06, 2013"

Pours lightly hazy bright orange amber color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, peach, pineapple, floral, grass, light caramel, light pine, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of hop notes with a moderate malt balance; and great strength. Taste of tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, pineapple, peach, floral, grass, light pine, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Light floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of big tangerine, orange zest, orange rind, lemon zest, pineapple, peach, floral, grass, pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of citrus/tropical hops flavors with a light-moderate malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, slick, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warning noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic DIPA! Fantastic complexity and balance of citrus and tropical hop flavors with a moderate malt balance; and very smooth and fairy crisp to sip on for the gravity. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 24, 2013"

There's a lot of balance here, and yes, while it is indeed quite hoppy, the bready, crisp malt profile (which is for once not too syrupy) smoothens things out and provides a lot of balance to the beer. Really great stuff - I just wish it wasn't $13 a bomber outside of the brewery (where it is instead $10). I was happy to try it, and wouldn't pass it down again, but I'm fortunate that I have DIPA options that quite similar and good in their own way around here that are slightly more affordable.","magictacosinus","Jun 28, 2013"

A really nice IIPA, but a bit too heavy in the sweet malt department for my tastes despite the big hop presence. Doesn't rank with Lawson's Double Sunshine or Heady Topper. 3 Floyds makes some great beers, yet Zombie Dust is the standout for me.","Hendry","May 27, 2013"

I remember this beer being a bit better on draft at FFF when I had it last year; it was smooth, hoppy and sweet all at once. It is not a hot mess like some DIPAs can be, which is a nice plus in my book. More balanced than APW, even fresh. Solid DIPA but I'd take a good number of it over Dreadnaught- like Pliny, Heady Topper, Sosus, Permanent Funeral, IIPA, etc. Very good DIPA but FFF makes better beers. (4)","Stevedore","May 19, 2013"

4.15,-5.9,4,4,4.25,4,4.25,"Overall, what we liked best about this beer was its upfront spiciness and bitterness through the flavoring. This was due to not only the herbal, earthy, citric, and raw resiny hops, but also due to the equally as dirty plastics and grit littered about the grain bill. Despite all this, the balance through the center of the sip showed great sweetness to balance, aiding ease of drinkability. The nose also shows decent balance, but as in the nose, the booze comes way, way forward with warmth, pushing you back a bit. This beer is naught for the faint of heart, and while it may not sip the quickest, it is definitely in line with what we’ve come to expect from Three Floyds.","TheBrewo","Apr 18, 2013"

I am very fortunate to know some young and single beer advocates who travel to breweries and am thankful for the overwhelming kindness they show when sharing. Three Floyd's is great, Dreadnaught is not, I repeat, not a bigger version of Alpha or Zombie as I'd dreamed. That said, I like it for its uniqueness. It has some intangible quality that my palate can't pick out yet (I'm new to IIPAs). It is boozy and not as hoppy as I'd have thought, but there's a taste (caramel?) that I need to keep drinking. I may revisit when I convince Mike to share another. It is WAY easy to drink for the ABV, beware! Cheers!","Bones10","Apr 08, 2013"

The hops are really understated, though it is pretty bitter and there's a fair amount of booziness too. Mouthfeel was fine, maybe a tad over carbonated and syrupy, but fine. Overall, this beer was dissapointing, given it's BA rating. There is really no individual quality for me to be impressed with. It's a perfectly good, but not remarkable high-alcohol DIPA. I'll try it again if I get the chance, but only to see if this bottle was just a dud, or old.","dougfur","Apr 02, 2013"

Way too dangerously drinkable and though it may blow out some palates, I polished off this gem and was sad there wasn't more in the area. I am spoiled living in the Bay Area with the abundance of amazing IPA's but this, my friends, is a worthy find and should be searched out. Thankful to have had the opportunity to try this.","kaseydad","Feb 16, 2013"

I like the beer, but the hop character isn't as potent as I want. Lots of "buts", which says a lot about it. It's really good; it could be a whole lot better.","zeledonia","Feb 15, 2013"

Aroma smells of mango, peach, grapefruit, and pine. I wish I could say the flavor was as fruity and complex as the aroma; alas, I find it difficult to discern much besides the bold flavor of pine resin. Grapefruit is appreciable, granted, and some bready malt does come through in the finish once the hops have subsided, but it's a struggle to gauge anything more. This IPA is true to form, with over-the-top hop bitterness relentlessly accosting the taste buds. If you love DIPAs, you'll probably love this.

Aroma was about as expected, fresh and hoppy, citrus, pine, some tropical fruits. More of the same in the taste, a bready malt base was present but obviously dominated by hops, citrus, pine, tropical fruit, stone fruit, decent balance of sweet and bitter. Lighter medium body, moderate carbonation, alcohol mildly detected, but overrun by hoppiness. Very good IPA overall.","Rifugium","Dec 17, 2012"

Average IPA color and texture I was not "wowed" by it aesthetically. The aroma was nice, hops and citrus but as the label said I was detecting mango. The taste was simple at first but as I delved deeper I was more and more impressed. Obviously heavily hopped this IPA is smooth and light yet tasty. I got mango and citrus flavors but the hoppiness blended well with both. I enjoyed Dreadnaught immensely but more so the deeper I got into the bottle.","KYGunner","Dec 08, 2012"

4.5,2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured into a snifter this I2PA pours slightly hazy golden-orange color with a bright white head that leaves very nice lacing along the glass. The aroma is intensely hoppy--lot of grapefruit, some spicyness, pine and underlying sweetness. The flavor has a lot going on--loads of piney grapefruit hop flavor upfront with bready, boozyness mixed in. The hop bitterness is sharp and assertive and acts to dry the swallow with lingering hop flavor and hints of booze well after the swallow. The carbonation is moderate and medium-full. Overall one hell of a beer--love how the hops work with the underlying bready/boozyness. More please.","uwmgdman","Sep 21, 2012"

4.25,-3.6,4.5,4.5,4.25,4,4,"This beer looks pretty tasty, by all indications of its clear amber color and nice white head that leaves a good lacing on the glass. The nose follows suit suggesting a great piney, fruity, bready aroma. The taste is where it throws me for a loop. I get the fact that Three Floyds wants your tongue to be like scorched earth with this beer and makes no apologies for making such bitter beer, but bitter beer is not good beer in my opinion when not backed up with a malty backbone. It's a strong beer but needs more body and more caramel malts to sweeten it up a bit for all the hops they used. The malt the beer has in it is good as if you try to get pass the bitterness the caramel comes through, but it's so hard to distinguish through all the bitterness.... just needs more balance. Nice medium body and well carbed, overall nice beer just not balanced at all.","Prospero","Sep 21, 2012"

I find the intense bitterness and boozy character of most DIPAs (and Barleywines for that matter) to be too abrasive for my palate (Yet I can't find an imperial stout too big to enjoy). While this definitely nears abrasive territory for my palate, I still find it very drinkable and very tasty. I would compare this DIPA to Lagunitas Hop Stoopid, as they deliver comparable citrusy hop blasts but also present a fair degree of balance and drinkability.

Dreadnaught might be the most intense hop aroma you can find in a beer. Pine and grapefruit notes are among those you are likely to discover. A tongue-bruising rush of hops is apparent on the first taste. Strong grapefruit, pineapple, and peach notes are detectable. These notes are centered on a biscuity backbone that allows the flavor action to lay on the tongue. In the aftertaste, a warming sensation is noted. The pineapple notes become sweeter in the aftertaste while the grapefruit notes run steady. The taste linger in the mouth nicely.","JohnnyHopps","Jun 17, 2012"

Quite a bit more mango, tropical fruits and harsher citrus in the finish on the palate. A sugary cookie-dough like malt with a substantially bitter finish.

The flavor starts with a gentle pale malt sweetness from which the hop character and flavors build. The same fruitiness as found in the nose together with a medium bitterness. No hint of alcohol and very well balanced. Finishes clean and crisp with a lingering bitter fruity sweetness. Very good. Medium to Full bodied with good carbonation.

This first smell I get is tropical fruits like mango and pineapple, then some citrus from grapefruit and a little piney aroma. The grapefruit comes through on the taste more that the mango/pineapple that I was getting so strong from the smell, the piney flavor is also there but a little subdued compared to the other flavors. There is also a nice sweetness that complements the bitterness. The mouthfeel is in the middle compared to others in the style not nothing really stands out, the carbonation is good. Overall this is a great beer I don't buy a lot of bottles of this for personal consumption but when on draft I do tend to get this a lot compared to other DIPA that Indiana has to offer.","phisigben","Feb 16, 2012"

4.92,11.6,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Dreadnaught pours a beautiful orange/yellow in color with a nice one finger white head. Massive sheets of lacing on my snifter glass. This brew is fairly clear, and easy to see the good carbonation rising from the deep. Holy Crap. Great nose on this one! I could smell it the second the cap came off. Lemon, pine, grapefruit, hops, pineapple... Really amazingly good, balanced citrus nose on this one. I can't think of anything to improve. Woah. The taste is amazing. This is a hophead's dream beer, and thus, I love it. Hops all the way around w/ the malt backbone holding it up, but out of the way. The hops are literally destroying my palate half-way through the bottle. Awesome. A small citrus flavor on the back end before the hops comes and destroys what's left of it. Feel is smooth on the front and end, and hop bite everywhere else. Great carbonation as well. Overall, this is definitely one of the best beers I've ever had in my life. If you have a chance to try it- RUN- and pick up as many as your arms will hold. Really glad I got a chance to try this beer. Cheers!","jayhawk73","Jan 04, 2012"

It's up there with Pliny the Elder, Heady Topper, Gandhi-Bot, and Hopslam for me. Simply great, and now I must get more.","angrybabboon","Oct 31, 2011"
4.7,6.6,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Wow, this is an awesome DIPA, and is by far the best of the Three Floyds I've tried thus far.

4.47,1.4,4.5,5,4,5,4.5,"O: Top notch. One of the best IIPAs I've ever had. I'm an IIPA freak too and it's really no surprise given the reputation of this beer. That tends to make me a touch more skeptical going in though - maybe skeptical isn't the word, more careful. I'm careful not to let the previous reviews skew my own personal feelings on a beer and I think I gave this one a fair shake. This one settles in nicely on the podium with a bronze medal in IIPAs. I give the gold to Pliny the Elder, Silver to Citra, and bronze to Dreadnaught. Very, very well done, Three Floyds. Very well done indeed.","suspect","Oct 29, 2011"
4.5,2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a crisp orange-gold, like white grape juice. Thin white head with little lacing. Powerful aroma of sweet tropical fruit, honey and a touch of pine. Reminds me of a slightly maltier Hopslam. Taste follows the aroma, complex hops with just enough bready malt to hold up. Light on the tongue and highly drinkable.","rab53","Oct 28, 2011"
4,-9.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall - Essentially 4.0s across the board. Overall, a wonderful DIPA. I don't know that I can put it in my top 5, quite a competitive group those five, but it's certainly within my top 15, maybe even my top 10...but we'll have to see about that once I've tried Arctic Panzer Wolf and Apocalypse Cow, both of which I also recieved from Kayn169! Thanks again, Jason! Can't wait to crack the others. Anyways, definitely do yourself a favor and try this beer if you like IPAs/DIPAs. It's a good one.","matttttYCE","Oct 28, 2011"

A hopheads delight. I'm guessing this beer was very fresh because I tried it the first time I saw it on the shelf here in Ohio. I'll have it again and again in the future.","Bonis","Oct 16, 2011"

5,13.4,5,5,5,5,5,"This has and probably always will be one of my favorite beers.

Muted pineapple almost bordering into mango, but overshadowed by a wall of bitterness. Lots of pine, sweet complimentary malt, but the sweetness is mild and short livid.

Smell is of tropical fruits (peach/mango) and some vanilla aromas. This smells like it could be slightly infected. Taste is of the tropical fruits, vanilla, malt, and citrus zest on the finish. Like I was sensing in the smell, there is a slightly infected taste that comes out as vanilla on this one but it surprisingly works well with the intended flavors. A medium hop bitterness sticks to the palate after each sip. This beer has a good carbonation level with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good DIPA with some nice tropical and citrus aromas and flavors.

3.74,-15.2,3,4,3.5,4,4,"Dreadnaught pours a slightly hazy light orange. The white head eventually hits two fingers in height, and shows pretty good head retention. Outside of a solid ring marking the foam's high point, lacing is pretty spotty though. The aroma is a bit underwhelming in the intensity department, but it delivers plenty of tropical fruit notes, with some prominent citrus aromas present as well. There's a distinct, yet subtle caramel sweetness at the open of each sip. The bitterness it makes way for is remarkably restrained for a double IPA. The hoppy back end starts off as wonderfully fruity as the nose is, but midway through the trademark bitter grapefruit flavor of Centennial crashes the party. Whatever other hops are used for late additions do an admirable job of blunting the harshness of Centennial hops, but it does ultimately shine through a bit, to the beer's detriment. The body is impressively spry for a beer approaching double digit ABV, but the carbonation is just a little too dull. Dreadnaught's a decent imperial IPA, but I find it's 3 Floyds stablemate Arctic Panzer Wolf to be the clearly superior brew.","axeman9182","Aug 22, 2011"

The aroma is a combination of piney, grassy and fruity (grapefruit, orange) hops. Smells good. Slightly grapefruit hop bitterness gives way to an abundant soapy bitterness balanced with some a bit of malt. The middle to finish of this beer is a bit off-putting with the soapy flavor and harsh finishing bitterness. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light for the ABV and style with good carbonation. Overall I just don't get this beer. This is the second time I have had it and both times I don't think it works. The hop profile finishes fairly off-putting, though it seems close. I'll have to try this one at the brewery some time.","seeswo","Aug 10, 2011"

The workers were diligent and took religious holidays often, but the field was almost conscious of its need for crop rotation.

Without much knowledge of this beer I managed to get the bottle and give it good home for a little while. Eventually I opened it up and poured it for myself. This brew looked really nice, had a bright yellowish color with a light amount of haze to it. The head was creamy and thick looking, leaving a real nice lacing on the glass. The smell of this beer had a wonderful mix of tropical fruit aromas like Pineapple, Grapefruit and Lemons. The taste was also had the same flavors as it did on the nose plus the excellent addition of Pine. This beer was very refreshing. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and had some good carbonation to it. Overall I think that this is the IPA that changed my perception on this style. I hadn't really been a big fan of them till I had this one.

Good foam action, generating a two finger head of thick, slightly off white foam, that I could take a nap, well almost. Far from clear, it most closely resembles a 8 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell, ooo la la, aromas of flowers from the hops, sweet nectars, but mostly grapefruit, lemon and other citrus flavors from the massive use of hops. Taste is lots of what I like. Flavors of grapefruit, pine, lemon peel, and lime are in the forefront, with a sweetness from hints of malt, orange, and guava. Mouthfeel is creamy, thick and zing. A slight dryness on the sides of my tongue and soft palate. I would like some more of this...please.","beerprovedwright","Jun 06, 2011"

3.88,-12,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Found at Lovejoys in Austin, TX this IPA shows a deep, clear copper color with a decent off-white colored head and very good lacing. The aroma offers a faint citrus biscuit/oak. Pleasant but not very distinct. The flavor brings an immediate citrus hop burst with lemon-lime bite and sweet leafy-grass edges, almost a bit nutty. It’s a medium bodied brew with minimal carbonation for a near glassy feel. Plenty drinkable and a tasty IPA that’s easy to recommend for those seeking a bitter treat.","Durge","Jun 02, 2011"
4.15,-5.9,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"This would be in my top three of the style. It is more towards the fruit/citra/amarillo side of things in taste, more smooth than bitter, and goes down well.

4.53,2.7,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Medium mouthfeel with oily hops abounding. Although I generally prefer DIPAs with a little less sweetness, this one does not offend with its sweetness due to the deep hop profile. Highly recommend.","FanofHefe","May 25, 2011"
4.17,-5.4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours golden with pure white foam, lots of nice super tiny bubbles and some but not much lacing. Smells like fresh mango and citrus, lemon, balanced with some caramel in the secondary. Taste leans more towards the citrus than tropical fruit, with a fair amount of caramely malt. The flavors are fairly muted, and I can't tell if this is just a freshness issue (bottle is from a trade). Long finish with a fair amount of piney bitterness. Medium bodied, medium-high carbonation, and no noticeable heat. Overall, very tasty, citrus-forward DIPA.","pmarlowe","May 24, 2011"
4.45,0.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Had on tap at FFF brewery this last weekend, reviewing from a bottle. Light golden color. Weird, because I poured two glasses. The first had a tiny head, the seconds head was about an inch deep. TONS of citrus on the nose. Tastes of grapefruit, orange, lemon, mango, and then more grapefruit through the finish that lingers through the aftertaste. Very very nice. Reminds me of alpha king without the bitterness. This stays sweet, hoppy, and fruity with very little bitterness. Very nice brew. So glad that I can find it year round "back home again in Indiana".","1Adam12","May 24, 2011"

4.32,-2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"On my second tasting I am picking up a ton more fresh sweet fruit. Mango, grapefruit, orange, peach etc. with some slight pineyness. Freshness is key with this beer (of course). Less malt comes through but remains strong with huge caramel flavors. Finish lasts but alcohol is very well hidden. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer the second time around. Drinkabiltiy was awesome and I could have easily had more. Great, great DIPA.","Kadonny","May 23, 2011"

4.79,8.6,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Many thanks to Alex (page101) for hooking me up with this on an awesome trade! Clear orange-yellow pour with two finger head, good retention and incredible lacing. The smell is nothing short of heaven! Huge citrus notes with freshly picked resiny hops and a touch of bubblegum. The taste is just as incredible as the nose. Tons of citrus, fresh picked resiny hops, and pine, but perfectly balanced with just enough sweet caramel malt to offset the bitterness. The alcohol is non-existent making this scary drinkable. This is probably the smoothest imperial IPA I've ever had. Maybe the best. It's definitely in the same class as PTE, Hopslam, and Sculpin. What a way to be introduced to Three Floyds!

It is unbelievably creamy for an Imperial IPA. The nose is rank with ripe tropical fruit and the bitterness on the palate is aggressive, but there is a really solid malt presence behind all those hops and it makes the drinkability go through the roof without adding excessive sweetness to the beer.","deadonhisfeet","May 20, 2011"
4.92,11.6,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"O: Lives up to the hype, a fantastic DIPA, second only to Hopslam from what I've had so far, and even then, a very close second indeed. Drink it and be happy. Too bad it's not in Iowa, but Illinois is not that far away. Oh, yeah.","AmericanGothic","May 20, 2011"

The aroma is big citrus, with a hint of sweet malt accompanying. Taste follows the nose with huge orange, pineapple and mango flavors dominating. A very nice caramel malt backbone balances the hell out of this brew making it less bitter than I anticipated. This isn't a bad thing, however, as I am enjoying the complex marriage of sweet malt and citrus hops that is in play in this beer. The finish is both bitter and sweet with a nice dryness at the end. An appropriate level of carbonation lends a somewhat creamy texture to the beer, which is very satisfying. Overall this is a wonderful DIPA from Three Floyds.

The pine is of lesser note in the flavor than it was on the nose, and that's fine with me. Bitterness in the aftertaste is just perfect.

Regarding taste, you initially get hit with a flavorful mild fruit taste, but it fades into a musty bite that reminds me of the aftertaste of the awful Four Horsemen. It gains some points back in the fact that this "middle-after taste" goes away and leaves you with a reasonably happy palate.

On the tongue it's a huge hop presence, pine resin, sharp, extraordinarily bitter. In the mouth it's not as huge as I had expected, maybe a medium-full body with a gigantic hoppy bitterness that lingers on and on and on. As far as drinkability, it's not something I'd turn to over and over because of its rather abrasive nature, which while pleasant in moderation could easily become overbearing. A huge DIPA.

More orange and mangos to compliment the obvious hops. The mouthfeel is silky smooth and probably one of the smoothest beers I have ever had. I cannot believe this beer is 9.5% I would swear it is no more than 6. Everyone trys to compare Hopslam to this beer. While I love Hopslam, Dreadnaught blows it away.

4.02,-8.8,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Three Floyds Dreadnaught IPA is actually a Double IPA and a BA top 20 beer. The beer when opened smells like tearing the rind off of a plump florida grapefruit. The beer is a orange-red amber with a good tuff of soapy white foam that clings and stays. The smell is very fruity with citrus notes as well as other more delicate notes like pear and mango. The beer is enamel stripping bitter and it coats my mouth and tongue like microscopic fiberglass shards. There is plenty of malty caramel sweetness, but it's a bit too much with the clinging bitterness that it makes for an unpleasant aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good with fine, soft carbonation but this is difficult to drink much more than the 7-8 oz pour I got from a bomber split 3 ways.","Soonami","Nov 28, 2010"

The nose comprises honeydew, watermelon, pine, sweet caramel, and mandarin oranges. The taste starts off with a small sortie of sharp pine and mint flavor fighters, which then dovetails into a mild carpet bombing raid by slightly minty caramel bombers. The lack of hop intensity leads us to think this may be an old bottle (without dates, we'll never truly know)...or that people are imagining hops that aren't there. Still, despite this, it is a pretty nice flavor. The body is a stolid medium, with a light carbonation and a dry, kinda sticky feel. Overall, a solid DIPA, not one of my favorites but one that can still hold its own against many challengers.","TMoney2591","Nov 12, 2010"

That having been said...This beer pours a hazy golden orange with a frothy white foam head. There is still a wonderful piny aroma mixed with the citrus of oranges and lemon. The flavor still has some bitterness from the hops, but the general flavor has long since left the building. I shall assume the age is at fault for the balance that exists between malt and hop here. This beer is pretty good on the palate and drinks well. A good beer if you can get it, a great beer if you can get it fresh.","Vdubb86","Nov 12, 2010"

Has a 2 finger fluffy white head that has good retention and great lacing. Smells mostly of grapefruit, mango, and pineapple with a good floral presence too and a little grain and sweetness from the malt. To describe the taste in one word, it would be juicy. All of the citrus and tropical fruits one can think of experiencing from hops are in here. The citrus fades to a bitter pine resin flavor that lingers and combines with the sweet and slightly wheaty malt presence that balances the taste out nicely. Feels a bit thin in body, but it is still coating and sticky, oddly enough. Moderate carbonation. Drinks so much better than any other DIPA I've ever had. This is not what I was expecting, and that is a great thing. I think I might be coming around to hop-bombs, and its beers like this that are making a strong case to buy IPAs and DIPAs more often.

Pretty good amount of sweetness to balance, but there just wasn't as much bitterness as I was hoping for. I actually thought this was a bit on the weak side for a DIPA.

The hoppy followthrough isn't as smooth as usually enjoy but it is still not abrasive on the palate though. I can see why this brew gets such awesome reviews...","thagr81us","Aug 03, 2010"

This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate level of carbonation that at times feels a bit low.

Mouthfeel is very smooth and silky not to sharp like some IPA's can be. Drinkability this beer I could drink all night but this could get you in trouble due to the higher ABV.

Appearance is a somewhat cloudy orange/golden color with a very beautiful, full frothy white head. I can smell this beer from a couple feet away. The sweet fruits are very strong. I'm getting a TON of orange and tangerine along with a lot of sweet honey. The hops are not very strong in the scent of this beer. I'm also not getting much pine or floral notes in the nose either. Now to taste this bad boy... Wow, My palate gets hit with some very sweet hops at first. Then it moves to the citrus fruitiness of the orange/tangerine. A bit of grapefruit as well. Then I get some sweet honey on the back of my tongue followed by an amazing hop bitterness. This beer has lived up to the hype for me. Absolutely divine! The mouthfeel is the perfect amount of chewiness for an IIPA. The drinkability is scary how high ABV it is. You can't even taste the alcohol until it warms up a bit and toward the end of every sip. Then u get a little warming sensation going down, but I really like that from an IIPA. OUTSTANDING beer!

Smells great, tropical fruits and piney hops are flooding my nostrils. I love all the fruit I can smell, this is very attractive to me. I take my first sip and I'm bombarded with a giant hop flavor! After my taste buds become used to the hops I notice the juiciness. Tropical and citrus fruits all over the place. Great mouthfeel, the carbonation is perfect to bring all the great flavors to life.

At first I get alot of floral notes, citrus, and some pine with a nice caramel malt. More fruitiness comes into play later on with a really great mango taste and tons more citrus. Caramel is a bit part of the taste but hops are definitely king here. Reminds me of 90 min IPA. Mouthfeel is very good, creamy and fluffy with good carbonation. A little booze bite but not much.

4.32,-2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"First beer of the night for an awesome three beer tasting. Thanks to Chico1985 for trading for and sharing this one. Reviewed from last night's notes. Poured out a golden-yellow-orange with a head of about one to two fingers that has decent retention. The head is off-white and looks creamy but a bit bubbly also. Thick lace is left on spots of the glass and a fine cloud of white bubbles is left on top of the beer. Smells of lots of fruit hops (mango, pineapple, orange), citrus peel, some pine and earthy hop notes and a bit of caramel malt. The hops do a good job of fulfilling my needs. I even get some white grape hints. According to a friend's mom, "it smells like aftershave." Taste is also good. The hops are more piney and earthy in the taste than in the nose. I get grassy notes as well. The hop bitterness is medium-high and at a level that I enjoy. The white grape juice notes become present at higher levels as well. The fruit/citrus hop notes (mango, lemon, orange) come in bigger as I get further into my glass. The caramel malt rounds out the beer in a nice way. Apple notes even become present at some point. Mouthfeel is moderate bodied with medium level of carbonation. It feels nice for the big flavors. The warmth is of a low level and feels like less than 9.5% ABV. The bitterness lasts long on the palate but at a good IIPA level. The body is moderately creamy but a bit more wouldn't hurt. Drinkability is good. The price ($10) is nice for a huge beer with great flavors and well hidden ABV. The bitterness would get to me after a while but I wouldn't session it anyways.

This is my first introduction to Three Floyds and I think I found my new favorite brewery, sorry Magic Hat. WHAT?!? Magic Hat? Yep, The thing I love about Magic Hat, now Three Floyds, and even Cigar City is the fact that they don't brew "normal" beers.

This bottle has warmed up quite a bit and the carbonation has diminished somewhat leaving me with a very silky Dreadnaught. Very complex fruit and spice flavors are delicately woven into the malt backbone of this beer. While sipping this I actually flash back to an IPA from Minnesota, Masala Mama, which I haven't had for a couple years. There's this sort of burnt caramel sort of flavor that surfaces in Dreadnaught. I love how the malt and hops flavors mix and create such a tasty combination in this beer. There's just something about this perfect combination of hops and malt in this beer that induces joy. Still my favorite DIPA.","marcobrau","Mar 12, 2010"

Nice citrus whiffs with a malt presence to fill it out. I personally felt that the smell was the best part of the beer. The taste was less of a palate assault and more of a journey in picking out the flavors. As it warmed the citrus opened up and got flavors of apricot and melon.

The nose is very appealing. Lots of citrus hops along with floral notes and the typical malts of a DIPA. Taste is spot on for me. This baby is loaded with alcohol but the flavor is everything but full of alcohol. Much like the nose there is a lot of sweet citrus comprised of oranges and lemons up front with a very enjoyable bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and drinkability is high. This is one of the better DIPA I have sampled. Will definitely add this to my annual purchase even though it comes with such a high price tag. Credits to you FFF.","abrand","Sep 15, 2009"
4.37,-0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Thanks to iconoklaztor for the opportunity to try this beer. The reputation of this beer is hard to ignore. Pours a clear amber color with one inch of off-white head that had good retention before settling to a thin cap. Heavy spotty lacing is left on the glass. Slightly sweet aroma before a complex hop profile of citrus and tropical fruit takes over. The flavor is complex as well. Not up to Pliny levels but it is very good. The caramel malt gives just a touch of sweetness but the hops are fully on display with their citrus and fruit notes. I am wavering between 4 and 4.5 because of how hot this beer is. My preference is to have the alcohol a little bit tamer than what is demonstrated with Dreadnaught. The alcohol also hinders drinkability. Medium body with a soft carbonation gives the beer a nice soft texture. The alcohol cleanses the palate and adds warmth.","morimech","Sep 13, 2009"

A blast of pine and sour then malt smoothness with a touch of alcohol on the finish. This seems like a perfect balance of hop bomb and smooth malt.

Grapefruit and orange rind with some citric hops and a pleasant piny finish. Some hints of caramel from the malts, but remains bitter on the finish.

The beer pours a deep gold with little head but lots of lacing. The smell is thick with clementines, limes and floral hops. The flavor is similarly great. The hop flavor is very strong nearly to the point of having a solvent character. The malt is still quite sweet adding an excellent caramel character. The hops taste strongly of oranges, sweet and citric. The defining characteristic with DIPAs for me is the bitterness level and Dreadnaught is within the optimum range for me.

4.53,2.7,4.5,4,4.5,5,5,"Pours a very pale orange, almost a dark straw yellow type color. Kind of light, it's fairly clear, with a bit of haze, on the second pour, I could watch a little cascade of haze fall through the beer. Really a beautiful sight. The head is massive, and pillowy, it looks loose, but it has incredible retention, and leaves some decent lacing. This one looks like PTE, it's a little paler than you'd like, but stands up perfectly in the other categories. The smell doesn't jump up immediately and punch you in the face. I could actually smell it, in brief intervals, at a distance, before I even tried, but it's not as powerful as some. The smell is very pungent. There's a leafy kind of spiciness, resting on top of some smells of tart fruits, maybe a bit of tropical fruits. Very little resinous smells, but there is a bit of citrus, like orange and maybe a bit of sweet grapefruit. The maltiness is slightly crackery and subdued, which is a good sign, it means this is fresh. The taste comes off upfront with a kind of sweet, powdery maltiness with a thick layer of grassy, almost herbal hops. Then comes the fruit, something is almost like biting into a young peach or plum, or maybe a juicy tart cherry. Really pleasant and great. The bitterness is subdued, but it comes in little bursts, along with some resins, and some citrus peel kind of feeling. The leafiness of the hops is really a great introduction to the ultimate taste, it kind of draws you in, then seems like something familiar, the turns to something altogether unfamiliar, it comes out punching, with the fruitiness, which is out of the ordinary, I mean, you can find it in other DIPAs, but a lot of times its battling with either bready malts, or really piney, grassy hops, but the fruitiness comes off alone here. Really interesting and wonderful. I'm really loving it more as I get into it. The body is perfect, the perfect balance between dry and sweet, it's a bit full, you know, with some nice sweetness and some hoppy resins, but it stays dry enough to keep you diving back in for another drink. This is definitely a bit more full than it appears. The carbonation is light, there's a nice tickle, and it keeps it lively without stinging. Nice. And overall, this is a brilliant beer. I mean, I could really see myself drinking this every day if I had the opportunity. If you ever get a shot to try it, and try it fresh, I would recommend it without hesitation. Really a standout DIPA.","taylorhamrick","Jul 16, 2009"

4.65,5.4,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Fresh from the brewery. Pours deep gold with only a slight veil. Three fingers of resilient head developed with a standard down-the-middle pour. The smell is mostly on the fruit side of the hop family: peach, lemon peel and pineapple, with a little bit of pine and carmel underneath to round things out. Mouthfeel is full-bodied with medium carbonation. The taste leads with a hop uppercut that should please any DIPA devotee: orange and mango make an appearance but pine is much more present in the taste than the smell would suggest. About halfway through a sip, the beer takes a brief malt break, giving you a nice taste of carmel to balance things out before the finale. The finish is classic for the style: prolonged, full-flavored bitterness with complex citrus accompanyment. A standout DIPA that demonstrates everything that hops can do.

The flavor has tons of juicy hops that burst with grapefruit and tangerine. There is a big malt body that is on the sweet side, but a massive bitterness perfectly balances it. Full bodied with creamy carbonation. Malty, but in a way that enhances the hops instead of takes away from them.

Taste wise is very similar, grapefruit and hops are pretty apparent. Kind of piney but not much and citrus. Surprisingly not very bitter if any at all, goes down really smooth.

A lot of what I would describe as perfume. Quite a lot of malt for a DIPA and very sweet. Beer is very balance as the bitter hops are balanced by the malt. I am sure this is a good quality, but I tend to like the hop bombs. Very fruity taste, but again, a bright floral peach/apricot rather than grapefruit. Mouthfeell and drinkability take a hit for me as Dreadnaught is a bit thick and syrupy, which is a huge knock in my book.

It almost takes over for the hops, providing a sweet creaminess under the hops. Almost like vanilla ice cream. The flavors really battle each other here a bit, and I'm not sure if I could say this beer is well balanced, but it makes for an interesting brew, and a nice change next to the many super piney IPAs out there.

The mouthfeel of Dreadnaught is a feel I love on high gravity beers that are malt forward, but I think this beer would benefit from the crispness of higher carbonation. I see this beer as a good candidate for aging into a remarkable barleywine. Would I buy more if it were available? Perhaps.

The smell is an overwhelming hops punch, with some sweet citrus and pine hints in the far background. Taste follows through on the promise of the smell, as this is a very hoppy ale. There is a far greater sweet malt backbone that helps balance out all those hops. This makes for a unique, and good, sweet/bitter mix. I really like the taste.

The bitter hops are the forfront of the berr mixed in with some slight malts. I was expecting to have a bit more sweet taste then bitter. It's very interesting but not what the smell leads you to.

The head sticks and clings to the glass as you drink. A beautiful aromatic blend of citrus and pine hops aroma with just the slightest hint of sticky resinous hops. Malt sweetness is palpable but subdued compared to the hops aroma. Could use a touch more vibrant citrus aroma to put it a bit more over the top and earn the 5 for smell. The creamy rich caramel malts combine with a bread crust heartiness to prepare the palate for the bitterness to come. The hops flavors are bold and crisp and cling to the palate as the beer passes to the stomach. The bitterness slowly fades but is never excessive or harsh. A citrus hops flavor remains on the lips once the bitterness has subsided. Would be perfect if there was just a hint of hops flavor up front to accompany the malt. Medium to Heavy body. Carbonation is enough to buoy the head and eject the hops' aromatics into the air but not too much to be gassy. Rich creamy and superb. This is an absolute must for all hop heads.","BWH3","Dec 31, 2008"

Initial flavor is somewhat sweet, with fruits that come out as it warms a little (I think it is apricot, but it could be mango or some other fruit). Flavor turns drier with the hop presence. After taste is very hoppy and you tend to keep that taste in your mouth for a while. Light to medium body, limited carbonation, limited lacing, and obvious alcohol involved.

Smells big on hops, lots of juniper and spruce as well as some caramel, grapefruit, citrus rind, and a slight alcohol warmth. Tastes of earthy notes are quickly taken over by a sweet caramel flavor followed by an explosion of hops; citrus, grass, and a huge pine cone forest attack mingling with some spicy hop notes as well. Medium in body with good carbonation, a big bitter hopbomb with a good caramel backbone to balance out the assault and sweeten it up a bit. Pine loaded with a dry but sweet finish and some alcohol warmth but not overpowering. A superior DIPA with fantastic hop flavors and a good sweet malt presence.

Taste is much more balanced than the nose with a great malt profile and superb hop flavors. Some orange/grapefruit citrus flavors with some pine showing up. Malt and hop resin mixture provides almost an orange glaze flavor. A good crispness toward the finish. Hop bitterness is good on the finish, but the malt sweetness also lingers. Mouthfeel is almost perfect, I think it could be just a tiny touch thinner, but it is damn neer perfect. Drinkability is very dangerous here.

While there were tons of hops, they were well-balanced with some sweet malt.

This poured a clear reddish amber color(on my second pour, the yeast which had settled to the bottom poured out and now it's a hazy reddish amber). The smell is slight, but has a hoppy as well as a butterscotchy smell. The taste-where to begin? It has an almost burning hop presence, with citrus and earthy flavors predominating, although there hints of spruce or pine as well. There is a strong sweet malty flavor and a hint of butterscotch to round it out. While I wouldn't call this a smooth blending of contrasting flavors, it is instead that harder to achieve all- out war of competing yet complementary flavors, all of which demand my attention.

The hops are still pronunced enough that you realize they are there and they give you enough of a kick to say Wow. Plus, it is hard to believe that this is actually 9.5% ABV. I have to say the bottle is good but lacks a bit compared to the on tap. If you can get it on tap, drink it because it will be one of the best experiences of your beer life.

There's a good citrus and spicy hop element that lasts into the aftertaste, but the malt is too big in both the aroma and taste. There's also the distinct, almost toasty Three Floyds house character that's especially big in the aroma, which is nice, but is another element that is bigger than it should be in comparison to the hops. I'm not sure if I should commend this beer for its drinkability, but it went down fairly easily. I guess I was expecting more hop bite. Alas.","tempest","Feb 01, 2008"

Hops, hops, hops, of course, but also plenty of citrusy notes. Lemon, orange, grapefruit. Notes of pine and alcohol, too. Wow! The smell hit me as soon as I popped the cap. Tasted like a hop sensation. It's been a while since I've had a hoppy brew and this reminded me of how much I love them. Both deliciously sweet and harshly bitter at the same time. I love it.

Heavy pine and grapefruit scent with slight scents of orange citrus and more hop resins. The first taste is all hops. This is so well balanced because the hops are not overpowering or overly bitter but fresh and provide a unique flavor. The malt is a perfect balance to go along with the heavy hop bitterness. Sweet caramel notes also come into play as the beer warms. The mouthfeel is very heavy and coats your entire mouth and throat on the way down. The drinkability is very high for me.

Hops offers a big herbal spiciness and pine oils that are softer than expected. Citric fruits with a mellowed acidic bite. Burnt caramel, prunes on the tart side, and big sweetness...candied sugar with flashes of honey. Finishes with some larger pine notes, herbals again, spicy, and dry. A nice weight to the mouth on a silky smoothness that leaves a little slickness on the palate. Carbonation diminishes to allow just a nice crispness. Alcohol heat is largely unnoticeable...dangerously drinkable. Some of the bright hop flavor might have been lost in the aging but enough remains and lends to a nice richness and balance. A tad pricey at $11 for a bomber.","cabsandking","Nov 14, 2007"

A nice balance of piney hops and maltiness that was not too sweet, yet very bitter in a good way. Some slight heat from the alcohol, which is barely noticeable. I didn't detect it until the end of my glass. I got that nice warm, relaxed feeling you get when you finish a DIPA.

The world has never been the same again. Pale mahogany and slightly hazy upon pouring with a modest yet structured head. The (obviously hoppy) aroma is arresting, but the palate is what it is all about. Others have written extensively about it; suffice it to say that, after Dreadnaught, almost all other beer is boring.

Nose is a rich hoppy mouth waterer with citrus, pine, mineral and even some silky vanilla notes laced in. As you first sip this one you get the well developed long rich hop feel that is prestigously unipue. Silky and nicely balanced with long citrus rind and honey. Almost sharp like cheese on the mouthfeel, while leaving a thickness on the buds. Warms the belly well. Delicous long term sipper that is not at all obtrusive.","SPLITGRIN","Sep 23, 2007"

This is due to the fact that, while nearly all the examples I have had have been very fun to taste, have lacked any significant complexity, and have failed to create any deep philosophical wonderment.

Pours from the bomber a hazy orange type color with a small white head that stays for a moment and then just simply leaves a small white head on top. Smell is pine hops with some fruits coming through like grapefruit. Taste is all hops with grapefruit and leaving a bittering delicious hop feeling. Mouthfeel is somewhat sticky and allows your palate to concentrate on the bittering hops without too much overpowering carbonation.

Alcohol is not present other than a little warming. Carbonation is perfect as is the medium mouthfeel and crazy drinkability.

The alcohol makes an appearance, but not overwhelmingly so. Mouthfeel is very viscous, almost to the point of excessiveness. I enjoyed this beer more when it was cooler (~35 F vs. 45 F). The aftertase is good, but the alcohol seems to play a bigger role than the bitterness of the hops, producing a more pungent feel that I would have liked. This is just a nit-pick, however, as the mouthfeel still ranks highly. Overall, this beer is absolutely drinkable, enjoyable, and complex. The hops burst through, but are not without their complements of sweetened malts and alcoholic overtures. Definitely worth the price tag, and worth searching out again.","wagenvolks","Jul 08, 2007"

Thick after taste with less citrus and more something or other, cant really put my tongue on it. It leaves the taste of Fall in the back of my mouth.

The aroma is a strong blend of pine hops and sweet malts. The taste is dominated by an absolutely wonderful blend of hops against a strong malt backbone. Pine dominates but makes way for some undertoned citrus. There is a decent alcohol presence, but it is strongly masked by the beers great taste, making a heavy beer seem lighter than it is, and also making it incredibly easy to drink.","atsprings","Jul 01, 2007"

The aroma is very nice, the pine and citrusy (grapefruit) hops are strong, with a bit of malt in there too. Taste is mostly piney hops, with some grapefruit hops and sweet malt noticeable. It starts off a bit sweet, and has a nice hoppy bitter finish. Mouthfeel is very full, and it's also slick, smooth and a bit syrupy. Carbonation is low and the alcohol isn't very noticable which makes this very easy to drink. Overall I think this is a very good beer.

Smell is a blast of pineapple and fresh pine. Hop dominated scent with a hint of bready malt that tickles the nose. Flavor is definitely not what I had expected. Pretty mild orange/mandarine hop burst at first that is balanced out by a very nice pale malt. Aftertaste is somewhat dry, but not over-dry by any means. By far the smoothest DIPA I have had to date. Full bodied with mild carbonation. Drinkability is scary good, gets even easier to drink as it warms a bit. My first sample from FFF, can't wait to get my hands on some more.

However the roasted pineapple, smoothly bitter finish balanced by this swetness, and the funk is actually pleasing and complex rather than being a distraction. Other 3F products brought from Chicago showed no spoilage so I can believe that this is the effect the 3F were going for. A mellow, sweet, highly aromatic DIPA that is a nice example of the style.

Inside the beer there is a continuous flow of carbonation bubbles flowing from the bottom of the beer. The aroma is bitter American hops reminding me of something citrusy. Also present in the nose is a sweet fruity malt backbone. In the taste the hops become more present with a red grapefruit flavor the over powers everything. The malt trying not to be out done, but fails at this, brings out a strong backbone behind the malts giving it a sweeter taste. It is a big beer that leaves a long dry finish that begs you to take another drink, one of my personal favorite beers.","cproioi","Apr 02, 2007"

Pine hops slightly overpower the citrus and floral, but it's a nice blend. Taste is hard to pin down. The sweet malts blend nicely with the hops. The interesting hop blend is not as aggressive as I would expect from 3Fs. Not too sweet, which is my primary complaint in the genre. Very easy to drink by DIPA standards.

The first pour yielded little to no head and hardly any rising carbonation. No sediment or haze either. The last of the bottle was different story because it contained the yeast from bottle conditioning. The second half had a one-finger white head and haze suspended in the beer. First smells are immediate with a sweet juicy grapefruit smell along with some piney hops in the background. Kept picking out more floral hop smells also. Very surprising and complex. Taste started off with sweet juicy malts switching to fruity and bitter hoppiness. Long and drying bitterness that is also sweet. Almost like a champagne effect with of course better flavors. Slick and oily mouthfeel and decent carbonation feel. A slight booziness comes out as it warms but is otherwise well-hidden. If I had this all of the time, I would have drank it faster, but that's not the case here. Great drinkability and intruiging balance between hops and maltiness. A lot of DIPAs in my opinion come off as too malty. This one IMO is spot on.","vwcraig","Mar 28, 2007"

Several of the other reviews I read talked about a nice size head so not sure how fresh this one is but here it goes. It was a copper color with a few pieces of yeast floating around. It was mostly clear until the final pour when more yeast got in there and clouded it up some. The smell was out of this world. Pure smack in the face hops. I'd had several of this style lately and this is top 2 in smell. The taste was also tremendous. The hops attack the palette and have you begging for mercy but in a good way. Since it is intense this is best suited for a nice long drinking session instead of a quick thirst quencher. Again top of the style for me.

Never has my tongue felt the way it did while drinking this brew...well except that one night in Austin, but I digress. The appearance of this beer is nice enough, a yellow/orange hue with about a half finger head on it. Upon first whiff, my olfactory senses were cranking with the aroma of a whole lotta citrus, oranges to specific. And wow, could you smell the hops! The taste of this beer, as stated before, was a crazy. It numbs the back of your tongue with an overpowering (naturally) hopped up taste. It is also very bitter. I'm not ashamed to say the first few sips were on par with witnessing Rosie O'Donnell in a bikini. It was that rough. However, after the opening stanza of sips, the orange and citrus flavor started to creep up and neutralize the bitterness a little. As I said, in the mouth, it definitely sticks on the tongue and provides a unique feel. As far as drinkability goes, well, I drank it. Can't say how many more times I will though. Definitely not something I could sit down and have a few of, but definitely something to break out every once in a while. Once you get paste the first few sips, if you get past the first fews sips, the taste and sensation get a better and become part of the norm.

As it warms, aromas of peach skin, grapefruit rind, floral citrus, and fresh cut grass blend together to form a corniacopia of american hop madness. Also detectable behind the hops is a toasty malt aroma and faint buiscuity notes. The flavor is sweet at first, with caramel, pale malt, and a subdued nutty flavor. Then an onslaught of herbal, minty, and pine hop flavors. The Aftertaste eventually dries, with a peachy/orange taste lingering and a sharp alpha acid sting that only true hop-heads could call "balance". The body is medium-full, and a fine, slow-moving carbonation keeps the mouthfeel fliud enough to allow ease of consumption, while qualifying the syrupy viscosity expected of DIPA's and Barleywines. Finshes with substantial residual toasted malt character and a myraid of american hop complexity to match. A real eye-opener as to what a DIPA can be.","PBRstreetgang","Jan 27, 2007"

I rate this beer the way I did because I respect its complexity, and it pretty-much delivers what it promises, but its not really my style. I know what I'm about to say is BA heresy but sometimes folks, big beer is just gross beer. You can go too far, and I think Dreadnaught really walks the line.

4.48,1.6,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours oily slick, a deeply hazed bright orange-flecked amber. Modest but long-lived head of medium sized parchment bubbles. The head dissolves to floes of fine bubbles and a popped collar. Globs of thick, sticky lace cling to the glass. Spartan carbonation streams laze trails of fine bubbles upwards. Thickly sweet pine and fresh crushed orange rind aromas waft from the glass, there is also a bright, clean blossom note, and a bit of sweet tarts thrown in. Promising and inviting. An initial hit of alcohol laced hop juice blasts home. Huge doses of orange rind and pine sap sit atop a thick malt base that provides ample backing while still allowing the hops to remain center stage. After the initial hit, the alcohol is well masked through the middle until the finish where it spikes the tongue with its warmth. The hops are absolutely wonderful in this; fresh oily, and resinous and the huge quantity of hop oil lasts long into the finish. This has a huge body and yet there is enough carbonation to make it feel almost medium. The hops leave a slick trail on the tongue which gets a bit numb. Absolutely a hop monster and backed with an ample body. Everything about this beer is big: aroma, taste, mouthfeel and, unfortunately, also the price tag. At $11/bottle, this is a steep indulgence.

Spicy orange citrus hops dominate the forefront of the palate, with a presence of pine and resin, but are rapidly brought into check with some bready caramel malt sweetness. Ridiculous layers of fruity complexity can be found within the hop bitterness on this one. Sticky and full on the mouthfeel, with a dry oily finish that lingers on tremendously.

The bitterness is balanced masterfully with the fruit. It finishes dry and makes you want more. The taste lingers on your palate for quite some time.

It smells pretty good; obviously, hops dominate mostly floral, but there is a touch of malt and a little bready yeast too. The taste is hops upfront and hops to finish but you can actually taste some savory maltiness, a little sweetness and a pleasant yeastiness. Even though this is apparently equal in ABV to the Dogfish 90 this is much much smoother and does not have the unpleasant raw alcohol character of that brew. It's got nice body and a true complexity rather than just being a hops and alcohol extravaganza.

Produces a thin, 1/4" head which fades to a thin wispy coating. Beautiful, rich, sweet fruity aromas of oranges, pineapple, grapefruit, peach, pine needles and caramel fill the nose. The hop aroma profile in this beer is simply incredible. Mouthfeel is moderately full, but silky smooth and a perfect subdued carbonation level. The flavor would in my estimation be pretty tough to surpass. Perfect balance here between the hops and malt. Starts sweet with notes of caramel candy, toasted malts, and apricot. The hops then kick in with avengence showing off flavors of pink grapefruit, orange, pine resin, flowers and herbs. Finishes with a stout, assertive hop bitterness which is followed by a mild alcoholic warmth. Just a beautiful, classy brew.","macster","Aug 15, 2006"
4.47,1.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours bright amber. Nice white head, smooth carbonation but not too much to impart an acidic flavor. Aroma gives off the freshest hop odor you'll get this side of Dogfish Head. Slightly grassy, like many IPAs, but in addition strong pungent, sweet, oily hop aromas abound. The flavor carries a fantastic blend of floral hop tastes, with sour apple, grapefruit, and sweet citrus at the forefront. Yes, many beers carry these hop flavors, but the Dreadnaught manages to make them taste FRESH. Almost no alcohol phenols present, and though there is a great sweetness to this beer, it is not presented as a malty heaviness.

4.31,-2.3,3.5,5,4,4,4.5,"Very cloudy, almost murky, but vibrant burnt orange with a very small, slightly off-white, creamy head that quickly diminishes to light wisps of bubbles. The nose is huge. Heavenly hops aromas of pine, citrus and resin and backed up by a malt backbone that miraculously isnt completely shut out by the monster hops. The buttery toffee aroma it brings adds balance and makes the nose mouth-watering. Fabulous. The taste follows suit with more of the same balance between the two heavyweights. Theres the spicy, bitter hops that rush in full-force initially, but quickly back off a little to let the malts show through with a sweet flavor vaguely similar to an oatmeal cookie made with some brown sugar and a touch of molasses. A good amount of fruit in there, along with a little white wine and a hint of licorice. The finish is bitter and long, with hops oils refusing to let go of your cheeks and tongue. It has a medium-full body oily texture and low carbonation. What can I say, I think I set the bar a little to high on this one. However it almost met up to my expectations, I think mostly because of its fantastic aroma and great balance. Im not sure if Id consider this one of the best DIPAs in the world, but it certainly was an enjoyable experience that brought a smile to my face. Thanks, hero27, for the opportunity to try this big beer.","ski271","Jul 20, 2006"
4.82,9.3,4,4.5,5,5,5,"I wasn't originally planning on reviewing this beer, but after tasting it I was more then obliged to give it the review it deserves. It pours a sublime amber color, with a medium sized white head that quickly turned to a small white lacing. Smell was full of complexities...lots of grassy earth, some herbs such as cinnamon, some grapefruit tastes, and plenty of hops to go around. Taste really made my day. The citrus flavors along with the intoxicating hop flavors completely complimented each other in a way that few other ipa's i have tried have achieved. The mouthfeel was absolutely perfect, balanced in every sense of the word...hoppy yet smooth to the point of being almost too good. If this beer wasn't suvch a rarity for me, I probably would have drowned my glass in one fell swoop, but under the circumstances, I savored every single sip. This beer is the reason why beer should be respected and revered as an artform. I would go so far as to say that this is the best Imperial IPA/IPA in general that I have ever tasted. I never thought that another brewery could exceed dogfishhead 90 minute ipa, but this one completelly blows it out of the water. If you ever see this beer or have the oppurtunity to get it, dont even ponder it for a second, just get it, i promise it will not fail to satisfy. One of the most lovely beers i've ever tried.

I still have to give Stone IPA the nod for #1 in American IPA's overall, due to its uncanny ability to be purely bitter and hoppy yet surprisingly crisp and refreshing, but this now stands as my favorite of the few DIPA's I've tried, and is definitely in a league of its own in terms of smell and flavor.

4.53,2.7,4.5,4,5,4,4.5,"Maximum respect to nflmvp for sending this my way in a trade. Poured into a Duvel tulip, Dreadnaught is a glowing orange mass with a dense, clotted ecru foam head. Orange and tangerine blossom citrus scents mix with a thick and sweet crystal malt aroma. Perhaps this isn't the freshest bottle, but I expected a bit more "oomph" in the aroma. Orange spiced sugar cookie dough, with a pleasant finishing pine and grapefruit pith bitterness. Some peach flavors emerge, as well. As it warms, more and varied fruit flavors become noticeable. This is much more balanced than I expected. Many reviews emphasize either an extreme blast of hops or a gargantuan sweetness, but I find that this strikes a nice equilibrium. There's a slightly sour, almost vegetal aftertaste. Quite interesting flavor profile, to be sure; many different hop-induced flavors are apparent, but not a single one stands out as a "crutch" flavor. There's lemon verbena, grapefruit, bitter orange, nectarine -- a very surprising and welcome panoply! It's not as juicy as I like my IPAs to be, but it's not too thick and syrupy either. 9.5% alcohol is expertly masked. All told, this is indeed an excellent DIPA, but not quite at the top of my list. Overall, it's beautifully crafted and surprisingly balanced. Glad to have had the opportunity to sample it.","orfeu","Jul 02, 2006"

Taste is loads up with the lemon and citrus, but the grapefruit is most definately dominant, almost like a concentrated grapefruit juice. Be prepared, full of juicy hops.

Taste starts with a nice solid caramel malt, slight biscuit, which quickly gives way to a huge wave of hops, citric, almost puckering grapefruit, finishing with a nice lingering bitterness. As the beer warms, a more piney note begins to come through on the finish. Gentle warming of alcohol in the throat, though hardly detectable in the taste. Even though this is all about the hops, there is a big malt backbone that balances them out and prevents the palate from being overwhelmed.

Light to medium in body, the carbonation feels subtle, but overall the mouthfeel carries a silky smoothness which is nice. Drinkablilty is great for this brew, even if it is a strong one.

Very inviting to us hopheads!! This is exactly how it tasted as well - grapefruit all over the place, on top of the caramel malt backbone , and more grapefruit again.

The taste starts off slightly bitter, then there are orange and grapefruit flavors floating around, with a bready background holding it all together. Good level carbonation leads to a smooth dry finish. I am surprised with all the hop flavors that it isn't oily, I guess that's one of the reasons it's rated so high.

Was very pleased with the other 3. Poured a golden/orange color with considerable chill haze and minimum head. The chill haze dissipates as the beer warms which confirmed that it was chill haze and not floaters from being bottle conditioned. Leaves nice lacing. Smell is all hops and lives up to what i was hoping for. Taste however just didn't deliver. Overly sweet caramel flavor that overpowers the hops. Alchohol is well hidden. Overall just did not live up to what i was hoping for. I have another one in the cellar and will re-review if my opinion changes.","beermanbrian","Jul 04, 2005"

Pours a two finger off white head over slightly cloudy and light orange or copper colored liquid. Smells of grapefruit pith, gentle pine needle, and apricot. Much more fruity than I was expecting. Tastes is rich sweet with nice grapefruit bitter. Not too rough of the grassy co-humulone but certainly enough to intrigue. The hops hit front and high, then they drop lower and to the back of the mouth. Great bitter with a nice aromatic hoppy aftertaste. Fruits are gentle and consist of apricot and (with reaching) some pear. Really nice mouthfeel, it's not just thick, it's thick like an oatmeal stout. Carbonation was moderate to md-heavy. The best offering I've had from 3F.","mentor","Jun 13, 2005"

Slow and steady streams of bubbles were visually evident. From the second I opened the bottle, I was blasted by massive aromas of grapefruit and orange blossom honey. Sticking my nose into my imperial pint glass revealed big-time apricot and pine sap. I couldn't wait to try it and then, goddamn, I said goddamn! Hugely spicy and super sweet all at once. The bittering dries the mouth and builds gradually and lasts until who knows when; I couldn't wait long enough to find outthis stuff is top notch. Another gulp. Sweet, honey-laced grapefruit pith. A pine tree that offers grapefruit instead of pine cones. A perfect balance of malt and hops, that although powerful, neither is too aggressive. There's always something that balances the other out. The mouth was unbelievable. Fine carbonation coupled with a medium-thick, slick body contribute to an amazingly delicate feeling on the tongue; it's as if someone draped a piece of silk across my tongue. The mouthfeel and taste combo easily garners a perfect score. I always question the price of 3F beers in my area but this one was well worth it. Glad I bought two.","oxmasterscream","Mar 26, 2005"

There is a very nice caramel malt backbone to this one. The sweetness is balanced by the magnificant hop flavor. Super citrus taste, but not in the puckering grapefruit manner. More of a citrus spectrum. Moutfeel is creamy, and highly drinkable for the octane on this one. I would love to drink this one more, but at the $9.99 price tag my wallet would be very mad at me.

We warmed up with some lesser beers before finishing with the two big beers of the night, this and Hop Rod Rye Ale. Sadly not impressed with either. Appearance of this is a slightly cloudy lightish amber with a very slight foam on top, slightly below average. The aroma is of an American Pale Ale - the sticky malt and the orange and grapefruit hinted hops rise in a pleasant, though not astounding manner. Nothing impressive so far. Mouthfeel is tingly and medium bodied - not quite as stickly as expected, though it has a tackiness that clings slightly to the mouth. Acceptable. The alcohol is well used to bring flavour and warmth. Flavour is orange flowers with a smearing of honey. There is a wow! intensity about this, and that seems the biggest asset. Impact. The flavours don't move much from front to finish, though it does linger pleasantly, shifting as it fades in the mouth - but here I am struggling to find good things about this, the 5th best beer in the world. It's nice. It's big. It has impact. It lingers nicely in the mouth. It's really not that great.","SteveP","Oct 10, 2004"

Smell is of citrusy hops, floral hops, and a sweet toffee smell. Absolutely perfect for the style. Taste is gigantic. Packed wall to wall with a hop bitterness that is on par with the best American double IPA's (Rogue, for one). I served this only slightly colder than room temperature, because I wanted the full brunt of the hops onslaught. Mouthful is also perfct. Smooth and slick, almost motor oil viscosity.

A bit of caramel malt sweetness lead the way into a citrus and pine hop overload with a dominant tangerine fruitiness. Mouthfeel is very light, carbonationg relatively low.

Hops, all over the place and then some, and a bit of alcohol and some heavy malt. Quite complex adventure. The first sip then adds some, grass, grapefruity, but more than that. There's a mineral saltiness in there, alcohol peaks and thick malt layers, honeyish chewy malt. Texture is smooth, creamy, very thick. Definitely my favorite I2PA and it may even convince me to seek a few others out, but I'm still far from sold to the green side, the hophead clan. Worth another tribute to Raindog for providing me with this modern classic.","Rastacouere","Apr 19, 2004"

4.75,7.7,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Thanks to fellow BA Qarre for this bottle!! Using a nice clean pint glass, I poured myself a lovely beer. Hazy medium amber with a huge frothy head, that died down quickly, but still left a layer on top which left little bit of lacing throughout my glass. Smell is surprisingly rich and creamy, of candied hop pinecones. Taste is also rich and creamy...alcohol is not really detected via taste or aroma, but I can't ignore that warm alcohol feeling in my tummy :-) Mouthfeel is on the full side of medium, very smooth. I know the malt is in there someplace, but the hops are very smooth, and come across as grapefruit and sugar. That flavor lingers, but surprisingly the bitterness is kept to a minimum. I couldn't give it a five for drinkability, as I only had the one bottle. I would love to try this on tap, and then to see how many I could drink...Definitely a very tasty beer.","PatandDavid","Apr 11, 2004"

4.15,-5.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,"After much searching for a trading partner to get this elusive brew, we finally meet. Thank you AragornUnplugged. The beer leaves the 22 oz. brown bomber (with a really funky label I might add) and finds itself in my imperial pint glass. The appearance is clear orange amber color with a nice white head, both pretty standard for a good IPA. The head leaves a lot quicker than a single IPA which is likely due to the high strength of the brew. Carbonation is also low and is gone rather quickly. The aroma is surprisingly mild for an imperial IPA. It is clearly hoppy, but the aroma does not hit you across the room like a Ruination or a Celebration. There are strong notes of alcohol and caramel malts on the nose as well. The taste is quite sweet with a strong peppery kick due to the hops. Smooth silky mouthfeel with a syrupy thick consistency. Strong alcohol burn detracts somewhat from drinkability. Overall I think this brew is very close to being on the fence to being a barley wine, not that there is anything wrong with that. I will try to eventually get some more to cellar to see if it ages well like a real barley wine. Too bad, it will take a quite a while to get some more in.","rajendra82","Mar 26, 2004"

4.77,8.2,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Largely clear, coppery-bronze in hue, the white head reached about a finger in height before dissipating to soapy foam. The subsequent lacing was very minimal. Honestly it looks like a typical IPA. Then I took a sniff. Its not normal! A violent assault of hops assails my nose, grapefruit rinds, grapefruit flesh, a forest of pine trees and a wild flower potpourri. The potent aromas are big, bold, and juicy. It is oh so inviting, my mouth is watering. Let me start the description of the taste this way, after about two sips I had hop burps. Sometimes when I quaff a Double IPA the gross trusting of hops down the gullet gets tiresome and sometimes I really yearn for a little balance. But Three Floyds has proven an IPA can be produced that is massively hoppy and unforgiving in its lack of balanced. Yet it is graceful and soothing but it also manages to be threatening as well. I am impressed. The hops are so juicy, so oily, so fleshy, so bitter, and so tasty! The hops stick to my lips. The malt influences are minimal and damn near pointless in mentioning, maybe, I mean maybe I could detect a trace of malty sweetness in the form of caramel. At this point I dont care, the hops have captured my attention, I am hooked. The alcohol provides some noticeable warmth. I could jibber-jabber about how great this tastes all night long, so Ill move on. Medium-full in body, very syrupy, the carbonation is very modest but it seems appropriate for the hugeness of this beer. If drinkability is a question of do I want another? The answer is an overwhelming YES!! This IS the best tasting IPA I have ever had. It is great; it is wonderful it is near perfect on the tongue.

The malt was still noted but the hops balanced it very well. The citrus notes peaked my interest in this beerHmmm, dont I have relatives in Ind. That can ship me some of the stuff.

The nose to this beast is unlike anything I've smelled to date. Citrus and hops grab you by the nose hairs and never let go. The first sip is like a thousand little hops jumping up and down on the tongue in a dance to please the beer gods. Oily slick as the dance is finished with a slight malt after taste. Finishing this is down right depressing because the flavor never disappoints and always leaves the mouth wanting more.","Ahhdball","Mar 13, 2004"

As I held the beer up to a light it left a beautiful clear amber/golden hue. I put this beer up to my mouth expecting a bitterness not to be described put i was pleasantly surprised. I will not lie, this is a hop monster but it is also incredibly balanced. A nice malt backbone supported the hops wonderfully. The mouthfeel is extremely smooth but leaves a bit a oily hop resin on the tongue. This is one of my favorite beers. Hopefully sometime Nick Floyd will see fit to lower prices on this bad boy.

Far from ordinary were the energetic aromas wafting from my glass...lush peachy malts were followed by a blissful bouquet of fresh floral hop notes without the resin spectrum. Taste...just as I suspected, a masterful piece of work, sure to earn the love of any imperial IPA fan. A zingy citric malt backbone with notes of honey and dried fruit sweetness was rounded out with an exceptional herbal bitter finish...which lingered on long after a sip was taken. A fantastically melded collection of flavors and hoppy bitterness. The alcohol was well integrated and remained well-hidden. The beer felt smooth and full, with a good level of carbonation..all in all quite satisfying. I imagine I could drink a 22 oz bomber of this at least.

4.52,2.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Turbid light bronze hue. Stiff, dense, persistent one fingered head leaves frothy lace. The aroma is dominated by a vibrant, fruit driven melange of ripe melon, sweet clementine, lemon zest and juicy, slightly acidic pineapple notes. Mild ethanol heat, yeast derived bready tones and simple caramel malt surfaces as the volatile hop oils dissipate. Bright, well rounded and appetizing aromawise. Orange flesh sweetness incipient in flavor is quickly complemented by a combination of bittersweet lemon marmalade and sharp, sappy notes of crushed pine needle. Fruit character is dynamic, beginning with a citric acidity then becoming akin to ripe peach mid palate, before stabilizing as a static, sugary honeydew presence. Malt character is underwhelming, but subtle biscuit tones and light toffee provide ample foundation for the assertive hop profile. Moderate in body, with a firmly dextrinous, slightly syrupy mouthfeel. Finishes with a light, but transient surge of residual sweetness, which lends a lingering impression of hopped orange candy. Ethanol warmth surfaces slowly from the esophagus, reminding the palate that this isn't your everyday IPA. Dreadnaught is a rich, superlatively hopped brew. Assertive hop bitterness and vibrant hop flavor ride parallel, and neither becomes obtrusive. With a more pronounced and distinct malt profile this would be untouchable. Superb overall, and unparalled in drinkability.","marc77","Dec 14, 2003"

Each takes a turn at the front of the stage, then slips in to play a supporting role for the next star flavor. Mouthfeel is also very well done, being at once light but yet solid. However, the carbonation expands just a bit too vigorously (a nit-pick, yes). But this beer goes down very well. I said to myself, I thought this was a double IPA? Then I check the ABV.

If it makes sense this beer's aroma smells like buttery sweet caramelized whole leaf hops it's hard to picture that but once you smell this you realize why this is the most incredible hop nectar I have ever quaffed. Taste: Equally if not surpassingly more amazing than the aromatics, layers of sugar and hop bitterness blend into one orgy of flavor on the palate the piney, slightly earthy, citrus tones of the hops are met with an equally amazing caramel syrupy sugar quality from the malts used here. Clears out the sinuses with hop bitterness and fulfills your sweet tooth at the same time, now that's what I call a beer. Mouthfeel: The creamy texture sends you directly into complete indulgence mode here with juicy hop resin and a full bodied via the malt profile this beer is here to please not only beer enthusiasts but to turn the macro drinker toward the light. Drinkability: Well, it has to rank up there in one of my most amazing tasting experiences of all time, Three Floyd's has redefined an Imperial IPA for me watchout west coast here comes the midwest.

3.92,-11.1,4,4.5,4,4,3,"don't drink this beer too cold, if you froze it , it would not suppress the calling of the hop! only by letting it warm would the malt come through to bring a slight balance. the last drink was more enjoyable then the first. truly an electrifying experience from three floyd's, i would love to do it again!","hopjack13","Sep 21, 2003"
4.82,9.3,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Full mouthfeel throughout, each ambrosial sip and heavenly gulp is packed full of hoppy flavor and body. Slick and creamy. Way too smooth for the evident hop profile brimming with citrus tones. Don't get me wrong, it was incredibly, delightfully, pleasurably, enjoyable to get pushed around by this whale of a beer.

4.65,5.4,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Now I could be wrong, but I think there might be hops in here. HAs a hazy orange-amber appearance with a thick white head that slowly dissapates into a thin lace. You would never guess that this is 9.5%. Well after you try to stand up you'll probably realize it, but not from the taste. The hop aroma is very piney with grapefruit coming through in the taste. Another beer following the trend that bigger is better. Maybe the hops are a little extreme, but this beer isn't for everyone. It's for the hopheads.","dmarch","Sep 11, 2003"
4.89,10.9,4,5,5,4.5,5,"It pours a light umbery orangy colour with a bit of haze from the yeasty bits floating around. Nice rocky foamy head that stuck around. The smell is that great citrusy hoppy aroma in spades. The taste is well ---- its damn near amazing. Nice strong malt and a blast of hops. It is definately not for the timid. The mouth feel is smooth with the residual drying effects of the hops. Drinkability is high-- perhaps too high considering the ABC of this beer.. You can seemingly drink it all night, but if you do .. the morning will be hell.","TinusTime","Sep 11, 2003"
4.95,12.2,5,5,5,4.5,5,"This monster pours a golden orange with a very slight haze, which the bottle describes as a result of bottle conditioning. Huge foamy uneven head..this brew means business. Aroma hits you like a ton of ripe grapefruits. Massive citrous hop aroma, just begging to be sipped. Tons of hop citrous flavors dominate the palate, and my nose is singed with an alcohol bite. Decent malt backbone here as well, balancing things out bit. This beer is bitter, but the massive flavors of grapefruit and orange rind keep things in check. An assault on the senses. What sets this out front is the decent malt backbone and completely resinous mouthfeel. It's thick and slightly sticky, full of hop resins. Drinkabilty is top notch for a beer of this caliber. I could drink this all night (but i'm scared). The best IPA, if not beer, I've had.","avylover","Sep 09, 2003"
4.4,-0.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured with a very large tan head that lingered for a good while, eventually dissipating to a good lace. Nice orange-amber color. Slight haze at first which cleared as beer warmed. Carbonation rises to the surface from the sides of the glass. The aroma immediately smacked me in the face from a couple feet away. Smells of hops and fruit - orange, pineapple, and fruit cocktail were all noticeable. Lots of hops hit the tongue, yet the taste was quite fruity sweet as well with some spice notes towards the end. Malt is apparent, but I think the sweetness in this beer is more from the hops. Dry finish with a somewhat bitter aftertaste that lingers for a while; the hops continuing to maintain a foothold. Theres a very full, smooth, slick, mouthfeel. Carbonation is moderate. Slight alcohol feel, but for the most part the alcohol is very well hidden, although it does become more apparent as the beer warms. Careful though... At 9.5%ABV, if you cant taste it, youll certainly feel it! Great brew, but the high alcohol content does lower the drinkability of this one a bit. This beer was very complex, and seemed to have lots going on. When I finished this brew, I though to myself... If the Belgians brewed an IPA, this is what it would be. I could probably drink a few of these (not in succession though) and find different nuances each time.","byrd","Sep 09, 2003"

Pours a deep ruby/brown color topped off by a moderately thick white head, which left a thin, sticky lace splattered on the sides of my glass. The aroma is definitely not for the faint of heart. A healthy punch of what seems like a thousand types of hops, attacks the olfactory senses, leaving them begging for mercy. Slight aromas of smoke, fruit and alcohol are also detected. The bold taste of hops will beat you down like a pimp beating his ho. There is a nice sweet and charred oak flavor left on the palate on the finish. This is one vastly complex brew, how can they fit so much hop flavor into one bottleI guess well never know.","Scooter77","Sep 07, 2003"
4.52,2.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"A copper colored nectar with thick creamy foam. HUGE aroma of fresh hops, grapefruit,hop resins and oils, deep floral hops. Layers upon layers of hop aromas with some alcohol sneaking in (and a bit of smokiness) Very full bodied but not sticky or cloying, sweet bold complex malt flavors battling with citrus hops and alcohol. I can pick out caramel,raisins,light molasses flavors with overripe cherries,cedar, and tobacco. A rather dry pleasant bitterness in the finish. This is a very bold, aggressive Imperial IPA where you have to battle the alcohol dragon to finish the glass, not for the light hearted or hop impaired! Beware...","jeffboo","Sep 05, 2003"

Taste is more of the same. You had better be a hop lover to drink this! But there is some malt sweetness thrown in there just to confuse you. Oh so very good!

4.57,3.6,4,4.5,5,4.5,4,"Ok, I have to admit, all those people who have been trumpeting the praises of Three Floyds were right. This is an awesome beer. The aroma is very hoppy. It's what you'd get if you could crossbreed tangerines with a pine or a juniper plant. I'm also getting whiffs of balloon rubber, but that doesn't make any sense. The flavor is surprisingly well balanced. I was expecting some major hops bitterly unbalancing the beer, but the hops are nicely balanced by the thick almost chewy malt flavors. The perceived bitterness is surprisingly low with the actual flavors of the hops coming through. The malt is toasted buttered biscuits with a bit of caramel sauce and maybe a little maple syrup. The beer is sweet, but not cloying. The body is a dark amber topped by a nice too-dark-to-be-off-white head that isn't a permanent fixture, but not wimpy either. Damn this is good.","aracauna","Jul 28, 2003"
4.52,2.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"22oz. bomber poured into a pint glass. It pours a slightly hazy orangish-amber color with one finger of head. There is good head retention and lacing throughout. The smell was a burst of citrus, mostly grapefruit, and hops. The hop smell is not overwhelming at all, very nice. The taste is a near perfect blend of sweet malt and fresh hops. This one is not overboard on the hops as the "imperial" IPA label would suggest. The fruitiness can still be found in the taste too. The body is thick and almost chewy, good for an IPA. The drinkability is fairly nice for being a 9.5% brew. What a marvelous IPA!","SheepNutz","Jul 14, 2003"
4.87,10.4,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"As soon as opened the bottle the aroma just blasted right out at me and I knew I was in for a treat. Big citrusy aroma, orange, passionfruit, grapefruit and white grapes come to mind. Beautiful almost orange color, slightly cloudy from the bottle fermentation and a frothy head yielding good retention. This is the biggest IPA I've had that wasn't from the west coast. This ale has a smooth medium bodied texture that is slightly chewy and nearly perfect. I find this similar to Moylans Double IPA and maybe even better. Flavors are grapefruit, hops and more hops with malt somewhere in the background. Only a slight bitterness in the finish. I didn't realize the abv was 9.5, and wouldn't have known it if I hadn't read it here. I didn't taste it but I certainly feel it. This is one giant IPA. If your a fan of the big west coast IPA's as I am, you will love this one!","BierReise","Jul 11, 2003"

It pours a cloudy amber-orange with a very nice two-inch sticky head. Lace is very well. Carbonation is good to produce soft white hang-around bubbles.The aroma is most impressive. Alot hits you from the beginning to end with a floral, citrus dose of hop. The taste, again complex. You got citrus with grapefruit at the start. Sweet, almost a wine cooler citrus taste, then a surprise hop kick all the while a nice warmth blankets it all. This is the most creamy smooth IPA i've had to date. It has a cotton soft feel but does not leave a cotton mouth. Drinkability, almost to drinkable. At 9.5abv it would be easy to get ahead of ones self. With all thats being smelled and tasted here, im good for about one 12 oz. per serving, but thats just me.","chilidog","Jul 06, 2003"

A wonderfully aromatic smell hits you, beginning when you open the bottle and continuing until the last drops are gone. The smells are primarily those of citrus fruits (grapefruit and oranges in particular) and flowers. Great sweet, citrusy, hoppy taste.

Numbing with my pleasure! lol There's definitely enough balance in there to provide some serious drinkability for such an extremely hopped brew. The alcohol is pleasantly warming and very well masked. Exceptional is an understatement for this beer. This beer is a voyage. It's like smoking a certain plant for the first time.

Dreadnaught was menacing straight out of the growler with an aggressive, revearse cascading pour, exposing a foggy amber color and a puffy, cumulous head that settled into a thick slick along the top of the beer with great lace retention. On inspection from my nose the Dreadnaught revealed an intense pressure of hops. There were huge citrus aromas in the form of mango, orange and lime and notes of sour apple and cherry. Dreadnaught tickled my pallate and flowed down my throat with such ease. The hops were not at all overwhelming as there was a a fair bit of malts, which had a wonderful equilibrium between smokey undertow and candied fruits for an interseting brandy effect. Thanks to the malts there is a perfect balance in what would have been a too intense flavor.This beer kicks some serious ass!","GreatPondBrewer","May 24, 2003"

Taste is nothing short of intense, and is not for the faint of heart. Huge notes of just plain raw hops exist throughout the life of the brew, and linger long after. Even though it's incredibly hopped, it seems very well balanced, too, with a sturdy malt backbone holding its own along the way. Mouthfeel was very smooth and oily, especially from the handpull.

The malt is also present to balance this beer just right. Well not quite balance as the hops will never relent. Thick, slick and chewy make for a great combo.

It didn't disappoint. This beautiful combination of a piney and critic hoppy taste were overwhelming at the start.
