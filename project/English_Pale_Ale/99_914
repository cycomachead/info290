3.38,-1.2,3.75,3.25,3.5,3.25,3.25,"Copper color, pretty thin head that laced Ok. Light aromas of orange and biscuit. The taste was pretty thin as well, with some subdued citrus flavors. Not much punch in the background- like an un-hoppy session IPA. Mouthfeel was fairly light bodied. Overall it was not too good, probably would only drink it if it was the only beer available","timontheroad","Mar 13, 2015"

3.74,9.4,4,3.75,3.5,4,4,"Really not bad for the price, I find the flavor mirrors the style of a true English pale ale; that is the malt and hops are in harmony.  The Cascades shine through more than the EKG's, making this a truly American "English" pale ale. I am quite pleased with its simplicity.","Bryan0Leavey","Feb 20, 2015"
