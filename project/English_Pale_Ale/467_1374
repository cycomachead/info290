3.58,-3.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Overall, this was our first rating undertaken at a sports event.  It was a rather impromptu decision to attend the game in the first play, but once we got there we searched high and low for something on the crafty side.  This was clearly our best option, but for the $13 each we paid, it was made that much more bittersweet.  The aroma and flavoring were pretty generic, and the hearty toast of those adjuncts effectively blocked out any balancing hoppiness lingering in the background.  We were glad to get to sip on something more our style, and something local, during the game, but with that markup it clearly wasnâ€™t worth it.","TheBrewo","Feb 01, 2015"
