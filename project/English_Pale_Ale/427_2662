Not near a London Pride but still coming on it´s own. tiA bit watery and bland, like other ales from Marston´s, but honest and surely true to the style. Those waters at Burton on Trent, English hops and malts, are very well balanced and i could have this again.","DiUr","Sep 25, 2014"

3.27,-9.2,4,2.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,"500ml bottle. ½ pt glass. Earthy & caramel notes as cap is removed. Copper color, chill haze appearance. Off-white medium bubbled froth creates close crown showing fairly good retention & leaving rocky rings. Slight sulfur, wet stone, caramel, slight wood & piney aromas. Sweetish upfront yields to nutty bitterness, slightly grassy & mineralized notes. Medium body. Moderate to low carbonation. Oily to watery texture. Controlled bitterness by malty bed, slight caramel & earthy flavors linger into a dry bitter finish. Biscuit & mild toasted hues on the aftertaste. Nice Session beer.","GONZALOYANNA","May 06, 2014"

By the time I get to my seat it has settled into a warm, golden colored ale with a good half inch head. The first sip, usually a big sip, doesn't usually reveal too many of the beers bitter, or more fruity notes. But about half way down, wow. Suddenly the beer comes alive and reasserts itself at the top of the drinkability board. It has a really smooth finish that makes for easy drinking. And fast drinking if your not careful. Or you are careful! I usually find 3 or 4 pints of this ale starts the night off splendidly. As I say, if this beer is done right and looked after and poured well, it is the best. But a bad Pedigree, that hasn't been stored right, or is poured badly, or even chilled(!) ruins the flavors of this excellent English ale. There is no real smell as I find; slight, and only very slight fruity notes, but mostly a light hoppy style of aroma. This is a truly remarkable beer. I find this beer is at it's best when served from an old fashioned pump in an English pub. The canned variety doesn't quite work for me. Although I wouldn't refuse a 4 pack.","12SteveS","Apr 25, 2014"
