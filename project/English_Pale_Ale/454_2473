3.78,14.2,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"A great tasting Pale on tap at the brewpub. I had this right after their ESB. They were almost exactly the same color, a nice dark amber. It was decidedly hoppy, but still had a good balance. The hops were of the earthy spicy variety, not fruity or piney like a typical American IPA. The beer was very smooth, I kept liking it better as the glass neared the empty mark. Highly recommended for anyone who likes a good Pale Ale.","Billet","Jul 28, 2014"

3.48,5.1,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 3/23/2014. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange, apple, floral, grass, pine, caramel, toast, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/grassy hops and moderate malt sweetness; with solid strength. Taste of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange, apple, floral, grass, pine, caramel, toast, biscuit, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of earthy pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange, apple, floral, grass, pine, caramel, toast, biscuit, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and solid complexity of citrus/earthy hops, bready malt, and light yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and some slight cloying bitterness after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly prickly/sticky mouthfeel that is ok. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish. Overall this was a very solid English pale ale. Good balance and solid complexity of citrus/earthy hops, bready malt, and light yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 27, 2014"

Being a pale ale, it's not the most exciting beer in the world, but it's insanely drinkable, has a very nice mouth feel, and the finish is clean. A refreshing English Pale Ale that I'd love to have again. One of the best that I've had of the style. Seems that I'm the minority, as a lot of people don't care for it that much.

Leaves a good amount of lacing. Definitely a clean looking beer. Smells a lot like a wheat ale, only leaving odd the additional lemon scent. I also smell some mild grains and very light malt. The taste pretty much follows the nose. Tastes predominantly of very smooth wheat along with a very very light malt. Definitely an easy drinker. The mouthfeel pretty much remains the same, except it allows some very slight fruityness to come through. Overall, this is a great summer beer and VERY easy to drink.

The taste brings in more of the same, but the grass is stronger now, and the caramel has morphed into a mild, lightly biscuity toffee.

On the nose there are biscuit malts, oats, wet grass, and dried fruity esters. In the mouth the hops serve more for the slightly bitter, maybe a little tart, medium finish. Before all that is a dry malt bill, toasted biscuit, with the slightly bitter finish more tacked-on than seamlessly integrated. The oat note in the nose and in the mouth kind of comes across like a pale oatmeal stout, which is sort of strange but it works. This is a strange beer, and I like it quite a bit. I lack reference points for English pales but I like the subdued hop presence, and if indeed those are oats that I was getting, I'm a big fan of that too.","EricCioe","Mar 05, 2011"

I must say that the head is loose, and it sort of fell down, and only left a bit of lacing. The smell is very raw, and there are sort of 3 elements. First I noticed a distinct graininess, with something like lemon zest on top of it. Then there's a yeasty smell, with a bit of a fermentation smell - as if it was actively going on. Then there's an airiness to it a real lightness to the whole beer. The taste comes first with this slight pale maltiness, almost like it's mixed with lemon-lime soda, almost some artificial (read: un-malty, like sucrose). There's just a little bit of all of the normal stuff in this one. The body is somewhere around medium-thin, and the carbonation rushes in with every drink, almost stinging and biting. Lively and interesting. Fairly enjoyable and easy to drink. I doubt if I would come back to it with so much more out there.

3.5,5.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A nice light orange color body supports an assertive (maybe a mispour?) white foam head with some unusually large bubbles. Smell manages to be flowery and earthy at the same time. The first thing that strikes me about the taste is the malt profile, it could be because i've been drinking Eisenbahn's Pale Ale in Brasil for the last 3 months which is super flowery and citric and i haven't adjusted to our pale ales yet. But malt is definately what i first notice. A light (I emphasize light) citrus taste rounds out the flavor. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both ok, nothing special and nothing bad. An ok pale ale by my book.","soper2000","Jul 16, 2004"
3.87,16.9,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"I'm bumping up the taste a half point after a second pour. I left the bottom half inch in the bottle and with it all the harsh taste.","ken3c","Apr 23, 2004"

3.33,0.6,3.5,3,3,4,4,"From the cask pours a light golden/tan cloudy liquid with a white thick head. The head stayed for a while, the lacing was minimal. Not much smell to this beer, perhaps a slight floral smell. The taste was immediately astringent, sour and grainy. It did have a good floral hoppy finish. There was a little bit of bitterness, but not much. Medium body, smooth and easy to drink. Not a bad beer, it did grow on me as time went by. I do enjoy almost anything on cask, and although this did not blow me away, it was pleasant.","Bierguy5","Dec 09, 2003"
3.66,10.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep copper color with three fingers of fluffy white head. There is lots and lots of lace left over. The smell is both a little malty and a little hoppy, but overall a little weak. The taste leans a bit on the malty side, lots of bread and caramel flavors. Some yeast present in there as well. A little bit of hops left on the back of thre tongue. The mouthfeel is fairly thick for the style, maybe a touch light. The drinkability is pretty good. A decent pale ale.","SheepNutz","Aug 29, 2003"
3.5,5.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This brew is a light peach colour with a lovely white cap of foam. Aromas are of light bready malts and subtle british hops. The taste is nicely balanced, bready, biscuity, and more. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, and the drinkability is a notch above average. I liked it.","francisweizen","Jul 16, 2003"
3.18,-3.9,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"There are so many pales ales on the market. It seems like every brewer has to have one in the lineup. Arcardia's offering pours out to a light amber in the glass with a decent head. Nose is that of light fruit and hops. The taste is good, but doesn't grab you in the way that many pales do when the hop twang hits on the swallow. A good beer to recommend to those who haven't been exposed to the style.","proc","Jul 03, 2003"
3.23,-2.4,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"Rich orange amber color reminiscent of a newly minted penny. Pours partly cloudy (neither clear nor hazy). A finger's worth of tight, off-white head that is fed by relatively active carbonation. Smell is neither distinctive nor offensive--generically sweet malts with detectable caramel. Surprisingly hoppy up front, but that bitterness gets even stronger shortly after. In between those surges of hops one finds a baseline of caramely malts. An interesting fade to a bubbly finish. Mouthfeel is merely OK--rather watery at the start and a bit clingy when all is said and done. The overly strong hops and lack of integration make this a ho-hum pale ale.","BitteBier","Jul 02, 2003"
3.98,20.2,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"This is the beer I tell my friends to try who want an introduction to microbrews. There are no real hugely noticeable flavors but more of a withdrawn blend of flavors. The beer is more complex than I thought it would be with a good blend of hops and somewhat of a nutty taste in it. Anglers Ale goes down easy and is an enjoyable beer to have, esp. in these hot summer days.","granger10","May 19, 2003"

3.21,-3,4,3,3,3.5,3.5,"A clear amber body topped by a billowy ivory head. The head lasts and deposits great lace on the glass. The nose is malty and gives off English style hops aromas. The flavor is of a bitter with plenty of malt backbone and hops overlay. Incomplete blending of the flavors creates a sense of disharmony in this beer. Pleasant yet disconcerting. This one would need to be an acquired taste. Long, lingering aftertaste. This reminds me of some Irish cream ales I've tasted that give a lacquer-like sense.","AtLagerHeads","Jan 07, 2003"
3.21,-3,4,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Decent light body and good carbonation make it pretty drinkable. Nothing offensive about this beer, but I won't go out of my way for this one again.","cretemixer","Jan 06, 2003"
3.33,0.6,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a hazy copper - gold, with an amazingly persistent head and quite a bit of suspended particles. Aroma is very light, with some caramel and floral notes, with a touch of orange. Flavor begins with caramel and toasted malts, with some herbal spiciness and finishing bitterness. Not very sweet, and very subtly flavored. Mouthfeel is light and creamy. An very mild pale ale that would be an ok session beer. Nothing spectacular, but decent.","zerk","Dec 24, 2002"
4.13,24.8,4.5,4,4,5,4,"The perfect golden-amber quaffer when trolling for Walleye or just watching someone else do it on TV. A nose full of dirt and a few curls of lemon skin. Earthy hops linger against an artful toasty backdrop. A precise carbonation makes this beer a session treat. English, indeed!","inebrius","Dec 18, 2002"
3.1,-6.3,4,4,3,2,2.5,"Hazy copper pour with little chunks of yeast forms a thin white head with large bubbles. Moderately carbonated. Starts with a brisk pleasant english hop note which quickly dissolves into a somewhat muddy, subtle wet cardboard mustiness. Leaves the tongue with a mediocre glaze. Not being a big fan of EPA's to begin with, I would rate this as just "average". Could definitely benefit from harder water to achieve a brisker mouthfeel.","Mitchster","Dec 11, 2002"

I’ve been disappointed with this mixed twelve pack, the tastes are fairly faithful to their styles, but the flavor is very middle of the road. This style has a fairly under whelming hop, a little malt and a whole lot of nothing. I’ll pass it by next time.","jackndan","Nov 09, 2002"
2.8,-15.4,3,3,2.5,3,3,"Part of and Arcadia sampler: Not a very good translation of the style. Pours a clear amber color with a medium off-white head that disappeared quickly. Thin and quick lacing. Aroma was malty and slightly pungent. Flavor is mostly malty with a hops presence and kind of sour aftertaste. This was too mild to be a great EPA in my opinion.","Dogbrick","Beers"
3.13,-5.4,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Pours a nice orange-amber color, modest beige head, the lace pleasant as well, but they vanish quickly, leaving lumpy globs upon the glass. Malt nose dominates, clean and crisp, the start slightly sweet, thin top, finish is charmingly hopped, enchantingly acidic, droughty long lasting aftertaste. As with the Nut Brown, pretty much run of the mill, and drinkable, which is why we buy beer.","Gusler","0"
