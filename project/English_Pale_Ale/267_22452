3.89,2.1,4.75,4.5,3.5,4.25,3.5,"I enjoyed the abundant fresh hops character of this brew - it is highly aromatic. However, the palate was a bit dry for my taste, lacking a solid malt backbone to stand up to the hops. My reference for this sort of style is the Anchor Liberty, one of my favorite beers. The Odell 5 Barrel is still very enjoyable, though.","maedhros09","Jan 02, 2015"
