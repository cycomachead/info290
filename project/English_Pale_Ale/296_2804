Slightly grassy bouquet with a lemony-lime odour. Very earthy taste, heavy tasting, unpleasant. Not much by way of a hops, could be an abundance of malt but whatever it was it didn't work; with warming a distinctly sour finish. I found it hard to finish this beer, in fact, I didn't.

Looks and smells more like a european lager. Tastes of minerally hard water, slightly drying grain husk, lightly smoked tea leaf, and lightly hopped. Has an earthiness to it and slightly silky lactose accompanying the other flavors. But feels rather thin. In general I feel that this beer is lacking in many aspects. Not enough malt or hop or anything to overshadow the the thin yet hard water.

1.94,-45.8,3.5,2,1.5,3.5,1.5,"Pours a nice golden colour with a decent white head that laces fairly well. A lot of grain, but also a slight skunky note in the aroma, which I find really disappointing, but somehow predictable. Luckily its not too dominant in the flavour, so I'm glad I drank this on day of purchase and not later. Very grainy flavour with grass, earth and lemon (I'm guessing the last three are from the hopping). Overall too much grain for me to enjoy, and I even picked up on a slightly unpleasant corny undertone that reminded me of macro swill. The mouthfeel is smooth with medium-light body and carbonation. Drinkability, however, suffers greatly from the inbalance of flavours and the nagging hint of skunk. FFS, sort it out. I'm not the first one to have noticed this with this brewery. St. Peter's lighter beers seem to be skunk magnets due to the bottle colour, which is a terrible shame because their heavier, darker brews are fantastic.

It's a subtle buttery, burnt caramel nose, but with a hint of coconut liqueur. For such a mild scent, it's surprisingly bold, though expectedly rich and buttery. Pretty good! It's very heavy and syrupy in the mouth, and with a complete lack of carbonation, letting only the hops dictate any pep. It's a pretty tasty beer--very cozy, but a bit too dense and sweet for extended drinking.","Opethsprite","Nov 04, 2007"

The mouthfeel is just a notch heavier than a macro lager. This is a very drinkable beer, and would probably be far more impressive on cask. The only thing that gets in the way of this becoming a house beer for me (other than that I'm a homebrewer) is the nearly $3 a bottle price. This is a nicely executed English Ale.

It pours a very nice orange gold color and displays decent lacing, though minimal head retention. It's got a great nose too. Notes of citrus and coffee are predominant with some hops showing through. The flavor however, is underwhelming. It's mostly coffee and musty yeast with a bit of weak citrus. Not nearly as good as the nose. The mouthfeel is somewhat thin as well. There was also a lot of yeast sediment in the bottom as well which may have contributed to the musty flavor. All in all, it's not a bad ale, just disappointing. Everything leading up to the flavor was quite good only to be finished with mediocrity. However, the bottle is pretty cool, so it's worth having at least once.","JWFokker","Oct 10, 2006"

Taste is full and more complex than I expected from the look and pour creamy sweet malt mixes well with a nice bitter hop kick at the end.

Smell was a little left to be desired I thought. It was malty, hoppy, and slightly buttery, but It just seemed to be all over around. Luckily the taste made up for it. Malts mixed with honey hit the palate first then blend in with the hops that last through the aftertaste. Finishes on the peppery side but has that wet spot in the aftertaste.

Mouthfeel is light bodied, to the point of feeling watery, and carbonation is low. Taste is biscuity, slight caramel, and funky, bitter English hops.

Wonderfully pure, watery sweet fruit like melon, bartlett pears and white plums. It tastes like it smells. What luck to have a plate of this kind of food with this kind of beer. Neither are my usual, but they go together seemlessly. It's not that the fish is very good either...careless, powdery breading, plus I burned one side. But it loves the beer. It seems like a brilliant compromise between the many robust Pale Ales you get in bottle from Britain and the need for lighter alcohol, more refreshing beer. Faint gas pressure makes it just creamy, nearly like a Nitro package, but there are alive, unpasteurized flavors alight on my tongue too: a permanent delicate bitterness from boiled hops forms the base for moss, lychens, birch bark, driftwood, romaine hearts, whipped cream and lemon leaf.","putnam","Aug 02, 2003"

I noticed however that the sweet tastes came out more as the beer warmed a bit. Out of the 3 beers I've tried in my pack, which are the cream stout, old style porter and the golden ale, I've noticed that they all have a slightly roasted or burnt flavor to them, which I think is very tasty. Another great brew from England.","Dmann","Jan 21, 2003"
2.65,-26,3.5,3.5,2,4,2,"at first, this beer tasted like charcoal, and nothing else. it was very very strange. as i went through it, i got some nice sweet malts and hops that were balanced very well, but i could not shake that terrible charcoal taste. i don't know if something was wrong with this beer, but it was just not good at all. body was smooth with very light carbonation, which would have made it very drinkable if the taste was not so horrible.","ElGuapo","Jan 11, 2003"
4.27,19.3,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Notes: A very tasty little golden ale, such a complex brew for a smaller built ale. It also feigns as a cask ale with the lighter carbonation, this real “real ale”.","Jason","Sep 06, 2002"
3.6,0.6,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a deep golden color with adecent creamy white head that fades to a lasting, thick film.  The smell is of earthy hops and some slight toasted malt.  Smooth toasty malts are evident with some very subtle earthy hop tones in the background that don't really do much to add bitterness to the brew.  The brew is smooth and not at all crisp as it should be for the style and this detracts from the drinkability of this brew.  This is a nice brew but not a good golden ale.  It lacks the hoppy bitterness and crispness that is typical for the style, if you know that going in though, it is a good tasting brew.","Murph","Aug 11, 2002"
3.82,6.7,3,3.5,4,4,4,"This beer tastes solid, a traditional english ale.  It is worth tasting if you can find this, and you get a flask-shaped bottle ta boot.  Cheers!","BillyBrew","Jul 21, 2002"
3.35,-6.4,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A nice golden colored ale, not heavy, low carbonation.  The after taste is only slightly hoppy and not bitter.  The ABV is 4.7%.","jdhilt","Jun 17, 2002"
4,11.7,4,4,4,4,4,"This is more of a Best Bitter IMO. Deep gold (of course) with decent head retention. Malty grainy nose and a hint of floral hop. Definite ale like fruity-ester character and a partially dry finish with a lasting bitterness. Quite smooth and drinkable. With the exception of the ginger-lemon spiced ale, St. Petes puts out some good brews. Definitely worth a try.","inebrius","May 17, 2002"
4.45,24.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"First off love the bottle, great idea to use a flask style bottle. I bought this yeasterday and had 2 right away. As I poured  the first the color was just great and the aroma made my mouth water. I noticed that the beer had a thin head that vanished quickly. Very easy to drink, this is a beer you can have several of and not feel the effects of gravity. If you see this beer do yourself a favor and buy it.","Reverand","Mar 04, 2002"
