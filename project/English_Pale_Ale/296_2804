A good example of a traditional ale; goes down nicely. Worth sampling if you have the chance.","jazzyjeff13","Feb 06, 2014"

3.41,-4.7,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a orange/amber in color with a thin white head. Some spotty lacing is seen but settles back down the glass. The aroma is at first a mild' skunky' (as is COMMON for some reason with brews in green bottles) and is of malts with a hint of floral hops. The taste is MUCH better than the aroma with some buttery malts coming through. Lower carbonation which fit this one to a tee. Actually easy to drink as I wasn't sure.","BeerWithMike",
