4.08,22.2,4.25,4.25,4,4,4,"I think I remembered this differently or my tastes have changed,  but I think several years ago this tasted more dynamic than the 6 pack I just finished from Merrimack, NH. Haven't had it in so long I thought I'd try it out rather than all the crafts I've been drinking. I do understand where the 76 okay score stands with this one as it was just that.","megamick","Mar 23, 2015"

3.63,8.7,4,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,"12 oz. bottle. Copper color, thin head with short retention. Sweet caramel malt aroma. Flavor of bread, caramel and vanilla. Slightly sweet with a very mild bitterness. Light to medium body with mild carbonation. It could be a tad less sweet and more complex but, in limited circumstances, it holds its own. An enjoyable pale ale.","loubar","Mar 07, 2015"
