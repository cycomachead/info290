The taste is a tad hoppy, but not to the point of overpowering with plenty of bitterness and it's a refreshing and pleasant Ale that goes down quickly and demands a second sip straight away. The beer takes its name from the famed fighter aircraft that fought over the skies of Britain during the Second World War. One of the finest English beers I've tried in awhile.","Metalbrew","Jul 31, 2014"

3.95,11,4,4,4,3.5,4,"It was a small, 11.2-fl. oz. bottle, so I thought that I could invert it until the pseudo-cascade began and foam began approaching the top of my glass at an alarming rate. It settled into two puffy fingers of tawny head with good retention. Color was a solid amber (SRM = 13) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a soft, buttery quality, undoubtedly from using hard water in its production. Biscuit malts were also present and I watched the head slowly fall, leaving some nice lacing in its wake as I anticipated that first sip. Mouthfeel was medium and the flavor was bready, biscuity, buttery and slightly sweet. I am guessing East Kent Goldings hops for a mild grassiness. In keeping with the style, this was much more restrained than its American counterparts and as such, was a nice change of pace for yours truly. I rarely truck in either imports or bottles and so this was a rare treat. Its relative mellowness was like a cup of tea after that coffee porter. Warming, the taste took on a nice nuttiness that only enhanced its mellow flavors. Finish was semi-dry and quite refreshing. Well done, lads!","woodychandler","Jul 14, 2014"

This is one of the few British beers with full body flavor and easy to drink that I enjoyed. I hope to see more of this beer now that it is available here in the States.","Ipetitt","Jun 16, 2014"

There was a really sweet - deep malty note to this beer but a solid hop not on the back end. Really unique beer and easy to drink with a lower ABV.","Tybo","Jun 16, 2014"

Taste is on the assertive side, definite lemon tones and tartness.Bitterness follows but is a bit one-dimensional, seems a little unbalanced. Carbonation level is a bit high as well.

3.75,5.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"The Spitfire Kentish Ale pours a muted gold into the pint glass, solid 2-finger off white head caps the brew. The aroma is very floral/herbal with a mild spicy undernote. Toffeeish malt and biscuits initialy on the palate, the solid bitterness grips and follows through to the finish with some nice tree fruit flavours. Nice medium bodied mouthfeel, though maybe a touch spritzy. All in all a very tasty bitter. Big thanks to Mike for lugging this one back for me.","Hefe","Mar 02, 2006"
3.38,-5.1,4.5,4,3.5,2.5,2.5,"M&D: overly fizzy on the mouthfeel and shows no sign of softening after quite many sips, making the drink slightly too stimulating for the relatively mild flavour and a surprisingly light body. The nose of this bottled version is perhaps clearer and more aromatic than the cask verion, but the flavour and structure is way below supposed performance.I'll rather stick to the casked Spitfire in the future.","wl0307","Dec 16, 2005"

4,12.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a dark copper color with a tiny head. Smell is weak, but definitely has lots of nuts in it, like a brown ale. The taste is aggressively nutty like a nut brown, but a small hint of citrus in the finish. Quite refreshing and pleasant. Much more of a craft beer than I would have expected from this brewery. Water is also pretty evident in it, but it helps with the ease and makes it go down without a problem.","Toddv29424","Apr 02, 2005"
2.95,-17.1,4,4,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Aggressive carbonation and lots of hops and dry bitterness. Brown but big hop bubbles are nice. My son liked it, it was Ok for lunch, but only a so-so.

3.53,-0.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Taste: Very hoppy, actually I was quite surprised of this hoppy taste as I smelled none. A tiny finish of malt is present, but I find her taste to be rude actually, not very polished, reminds me of a raw beer. Agressive taste of hops followed by malt then nothing, nothing to balance and finish this beer.","3Vandoo","Jan 21, 2005"
3.2,-10.1,3,3,3.5,3,3,"Bottle: Poured a nut brown colored ale with a nice off-white foamy head with average retention. Aroma is comprised of lightly roasted malt and bitter hops. Taste is better then your average bitter with some lightly sweet malt mix with biter hops leaving a clean dry taste at the end. Overall, an above the pack English bitter.","Phyl21ca","Oct 29, 2004"
3.82,7.3,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Tasted amazing, malty sweet, caramel and crystal, a tad of dyacetal, a heap of hop (nowhere near an IPA, but good) but well balanced. Carbonation was clingy, and just right. A nice dry hoppy finish, lingering dryness, and a warm happy glow.","revdrjbob","Sep 24, 2004"

Flavor is simple but enjoyable... some caramely sweetness gives way to a lingering herbal bitterness. Mouthfeel is far too carbonated for the style... but settles a bit after a few minutes. Body is medium and the finish is dry. All in all, a pretty decent pale ale, but I'm sure it's much better on cask than in bottle.","zerk","Jan 09, 2004"

This was the only place I saw this, as I usually encountered Speckled Hen in most of the pubs I was able to frequent. I ordered it because I thought Spitfire was a superb name for an English beer, and therefore had to try it! Was a reddish amber color, if memory serves, with a nice, compact white head perched on top. Smelt of sweet malt and floral hops. Taste started with a malty sweetness that was subtle, not dominating, with the bulk of the taste created by the hops, which gave a satisfying, citrusy zip to the taste buds. I really like English bitters, and this one went very well with my bacon & Stilton hamburger and chips.","woemad","Jul 15, 2003"

It poured and was deep brown with some ruby color also. It had a rich and creamy thick head. It smelled of flowery almost fruity hops. It was delicious to the taste. It was moderately complex and very flavorful. It was slightly fruity and had another flavor that I just couldnt quite figure out. It was smooth and extremely drinkable. If I ever encounter this brew again I will not hesitate to drink it and hopefully purchase it.","tang214","Mar 23, 2003"
3.85,8.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Cool Bottle! I like the color it is when it pours out, a golden caramel color with a light colored head to it. The head doesn't stick around too much, but when it is around, it is nice. There is some settlement on the bottom of the beer, looks like syrup or something. Anyways, has a nice refreshing taste to it and doesn't dissappoint.","JISurfer","Jan 10, 2003"
3.6,1.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Nearly carmely-ruby pour with minimal head. Smell is rather pleasant but also somewhat meek--a straightforward blend of hops and malt. Taste is heavier than expected, a bit syrupy though not unpleasantly sweet. Like the smell, the taste is dominated by the usual balance of hops and malt, with the flavor profile not changing much between start and finish. The more I drink, the more the medium-bodied malts seem to come through (i.e., this one improved as the glass emptied). Syrupy texture detracted from the mouthfeel a bit, but this is acceptably drinkable.","BitteBier","Jan 05, 2003"
