4.31,21.8,4.25,5,4.25,3,4.25,"By far the best Pale Ale I've ever had.  It has a great look out of the bottle - amber hue - although not much of a head or lacing.  The smell was just superb - not your run-of-the-mill pale ale scent.  Mouthfeel was okay, too carbonated for my taste, but speaking of the taste, it was great.  Hints of fruitiness to go mix quite well with the bitterness of the ale.  Overall, I consider this the best Shipyard offering I've had to date.","jjamadorphd","Mar 14, 2015"

3.62,2.3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured into tapered pint glass.  Poured about an inch head with a pretty Amber color.  It has a super sweet smell with burnt sugar and malty caramel notes.  It has a strong malty bread notes upfront with a piney hoppy aftertaste.  Not a bad beer at all.  Nothing special, not a lot going on, but solid.","mtvolkens","Jan 27, 2015"

3.96,11.9,3.75,4,4,3.75,4,"Overall:  Very good beer, with good toasty, malty, slightly sweet, slightly bitter flavors.  I’m very glad to see that a beer named for one of my favorite historical American heroes also tastes good.  I’ll certainly get it again!","Jeffreysan","Dec 06, 2014"
