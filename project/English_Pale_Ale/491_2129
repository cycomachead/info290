3.58,12.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"375 ml bottle into pint glass, best after 8/22/2013. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste lemon, pear, apple, cracker, lightly toasted bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, lightly toasted bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Good balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is a very solid English pale ale style. All around good balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 01, 2015"
