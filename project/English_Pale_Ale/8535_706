Smell is of malt, fruits, and a some grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and grain flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat but creamy mouthfeel.

The taste brings in more of the same, along with some very light orange peel, white bread, and a moderate touch of dark greens.

Taste is okay: biscuity malts with a dull, earthy bitterness that is sadly mediocre for such an initially attractive beer.

The lacing and retention are first rate. The carbonation is nil, and I'm not sure if I had this on tap whether it would come off quite this flat, or whether this is the physics of the nitro-can. The taste is very smooth, very flat, somewhat dry, and overall quite a light body. There is no real hop characteristic until the very end, where it does come through to an extent.

Hints of dirty corn and cardboard get in the way of a relatively nice malty aroma. The malty smell reminds me of that in a czech pils, or a german kölsch. The taste is surprisingly good, despite the unfortunate smell. The best parts of that smooth malt come out and are complemented well with a light hop affect at the end.

A definite malt presence with fruity notes. Taste was of a tradition-tied English ale; not overpowering, but good and refreshing. Malty throughout with just a note of hops thrown in for good measure.

I get some pear and banana scents here, but nothing too strong. The taste is pleasantly subdued as well. Very British, this Tetley's. Nothing too wild on any front. But consistently pleasing, for sure. Tastes malty and a bit sweet. Very yeasty/bready in flavor, with some mellowing hops hard at work. Finishes bitter and chalky. Mouthfeel is silky smooth at first, but that chalkiness is hard to ignore at the end. On the whole, however, I'd call this a very drinkable session beer.

The flavors evident mimic the aromas and this produces a very smooth drinking beer. I would like to have this beer on cask rather than in the nitro bottle.

Rather quaffable (with a sidenote that I typically don't enjoy N2 beers as much as their CO2 counterparts). This beer has a good English feel to it, but leaves the overall experience rather lacking.

The immensly thick "tight" head (almost no bubbles, just cream) was nearly as good as the ale itself. The smell was about typical for this style which is unparalelled by any other style of brew in my personal opinion. As you drink this truly exeptional liquid, the thick, creamy head leaves a most lovely lace, which is so thick, one would hesitate to call it a lacing at all. Coating, perhaps, more closley describes it. The taste is quite strong of malt, with a faint hint of banana on the finish. The mouthfeel is near heavanly, aswell. It's quite lightweight and goes down smooth and easy. I don't know why I even bother with so many other styles of brew.

Nose is full of sweet malt, slight toffee, ripe starchy fruit, and a hint of floral hops. Flavour is quite balanced, the sweet malt blends right into a mild hop finish, with some weird alchemical event occuring between them that I can't seem to peg. It's spicy but it isn't, and it's fruity, but it isn't. There and gone before you know it.

It gives you the refreshing feel of drinking beer from a keg or tap (as is intended), but you get some taste and bitterness that you don't find in a lager. I would love to try the real thing, like Fuller's, on tap in England. These are not beers I will drink that often, but in Florida in August, I find it quite refreshing.

The body is medium with an exceptionally fine carbonation that leaves it quite creamy and silky smooth in the mouth. The flavor is surprisingly full starting with light buttery toffee/ caramel / nutty maltiness, revealing some fruit towards the swallow, and finishing with a powdery dryness that lingers. Very well balanced. This is an excellent ale to enjoy at the pub as it is, but I'd really love to try this without the nitrogenation as I suspect it may be softening the overall impression of the beer, and particuarily the bitterness.","NeroFiddled","Nov 18, 2002"
