3.14,-5.1,3,2.75,3.5,3,3,"I wasn't keen on this ale upon drinking the first bottle.  However, I have finally decided this is an okay brew.  There's not a lot of carbonation, the head starts out at about half an inch and quickly dissipates to  a thin white peel.  This is not an offensive drink, nor is it world class.  But if you just want to enjoy a nice ale blend, then this might work for you.  I'll buy it again on occasion.","kd45-music","Nov 30, 2014"
