4.23,16.5,4.25,3.75,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Overall: While the carbonation in a can is higher than might be stylistically appropriate for an EPA, it is an exceptionally drinkable medium-body beer with great flavor characteristics. Don't expect the huge hop profile that you would from an APA... it is a true EPA in that regard.","jrich8919","Feb 10, 2015"
