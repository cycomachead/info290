3.21,2.2,3.5,3,3.25,3.25,3.25,"Overall: yet another 'quite nice but not really great' beer from Wychwood that commands AU$72 for a case of 12. The only really decent Wychwood beers I have had are King Goblin and Paddy's Tout, yet all of their range are massively expensive. I wouldn't compare them to Monteith's, since Wychwood don't have any particularly nasty beers, but I would certainly not suggest them to anyone looking for value-for-money in a brewery. I'll continue to have a single of each of their beers, but a case? Not a chance.","SmashPants","Dec 02, 2014"
