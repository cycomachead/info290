3.69,2.8,4,3.75,3.5,4,3.75,"Nice easy-drinking beer, very mild in all the attributes that I care for like hop-malt-yeast balance.  More bitter than aromatic, but still very mild by my palate.  Aroma was more bold than flavor, reminded me of a Belgian blonde in maltiness and yeastiness, but didn't deliver those notes on the flavor.  Mouthfeel was pleasantly light, and carbonation was medium-low.  Fans of bold ales may find this a bit boring, but it would be a good summer beer.","Alejandro1983","Nov 01, 2014"

3.7,3.1,,,,,,"Overall:  I like this beer.  Sure, as a blonde, it's not especially rich in character; however, it's eminently drinkable and low-enough ABV to provide a nice little session.","flagmantho","Jul 30, 2014"
3.63,1.1,,,,,,"An unassuming but satisfying beerâ€”smooth and refreshing with considerable fruitiness and just a little sweetness and bitterness to keep things balanced.","The_Mad_Capper","Jul 27, 2014"
