3.75,3.6,3.5,3.5,3.75,4,4,"O - Underrated English pale ale, and probably BBC's best regular offering. I remember enjoying these many moons ago and I am pleased to see how well this one has held up over time. Would love to see this included in variety packs over the lager. Not as good as the very best English Pales (Fullers, etc.), but solid nonetheless. I can see me picking up a few of these over the course of a year.","TempeBeerMan","Feb 05, 2015"
