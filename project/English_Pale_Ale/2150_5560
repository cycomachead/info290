4.34,6.4,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"O- As far as the English Pale Ale style goes, this is quite outstanding.  It would be tough to find a beer more tasty than this while still residing within the traditional style guidelines.","Immortale25","Dec 07, 2014"

4.22,3.4,4.25,3.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Overall: being a Yorkshire ale I feel I should stand up for Landlord but really there's no need to - it's a popular draught brew in several pubs hereabouts and is a deserved reputation as a good, solid pint. One of my favourites if I'm drinking out.","interzen","Nov 19, 2014"
