3.78,13.9,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy bright orange color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, orange zest, pear, apple, honey, toasted biscuit, light caramel, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of bready malt, fruity yeast, and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, orange zest, pear, apple, honey, toasted biscuit, light caramel, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Slight earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange zest, pear, apple, honey, toasted biscuit, light caramel, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. very nice robustness and balance of bready malt, fruity yeast, and earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.7%. Overall this is a very good English pale ale. All around good robustness and balance of bready malt, fruity yeast, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 20, 2015"
