4,12,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured from 12.7 oz bottle into schooner glass. Appearance: a 1" white head drops quickly with some light lacing left behind. Color is deep golden with plenty of sediment from bottle conditioning. Lots of streaming carbonation. Aroma: floral and some citrus hops are dominate, with some biscuit and cracker. Mouthfeel: fluffy and frothy with a mostly wet finish. Flavor: toffee, butterscotch, caramel, biscuit, with plenty of hop balance in the background. Overall: very well done. Enjoyed this brew.","Foyle","Jan 31, 2015"
