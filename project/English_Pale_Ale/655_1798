3.52,10.7,4,4.5,2.75,3.5,3.75,"Overall: This beer is all over the place. It smells so much better than it tastes, which is weird. I remember liking this beer a whole lot more before I got into craft. But honestly, I think it was brewed better back then, too.","JuicesFlowing","Mar 23, 2015"

2.04,-35.8,3.75,2.75,1,3.5,2,"Not sure why people drink this. Pretty and creamy, but has a distinct taste that I associate with cheap beer, and got worse as it warmed up a little bit. Couldn't finish it. Creaminess caused it to be heavier than rice lager alternatives so it's not even much good as an ice cold binge drinking beer.","bareju","Mar 18, 2015"
