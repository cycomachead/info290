3.06,-8.9,3.75,2.75,3,3.25,3.25,"Pours a clear, deep gold/pale amber, producing 1.5 fingers of somewhat lasting, beige, frothy head that leaves sheety webs of lace. Aroma thin malty caramel, floral/herbal hops & not much else. Taste is biscuit malt with a hint of caramel & toast, with a slightly dominate earthy floral/herbal citrus & pine hop profile that provides bitterness. Hop forward & not balanced as the style demands. Finishes dry & more bitter than expected from the style. Producing a lingering caramel/toast & dominant citrus peel/pine resin bitter, astringent aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with slightly less than moderate carbonation, moderately heavy astringency, creamy with a light pepper bite in the finish.","mothmanscott","Mar 19, 2015"
