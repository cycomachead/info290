Like nothing I have ever tasted before, a truly unique brew that is incredibly balanced and still complex and interesting to taste. My expierence in pale ales has been Sierra Nevada/West Coast type stuff, and dont get me wrong, I love the brews that come out of the West coast but this is just so different yet still so enjoyable to sip on. Go buy one! Cost me 3.50 at PW Mart in Poway CA, a decent price for a really outstanding beer.","theteleman","Apr 05, 2014"

While the malts are probably more likely to draw the bulk of your taste buds' attention, the earthy bitterness provided by the English hops is a perfect counterweight to their biscuity, toasted sweetness. This is one of the best EPAs I have ever had the pleasure of trying, although at this price point ($3.85 per bottle) it's not exactly the cheapest tipple as far as this style goes. Well worth a try for any English ale fan.","thehyperduck","Aug 17, 2013"

Scents of caramel, honey, sweet malt and slight apple juice. Not amazing, but it entices one to taste. Flavors of grainy malt, slight caramel and honey sweetness, particularly in the middle of the sip, though both are extremely muted and a nice moderate level of bitterness with some floral hop flavors. Finish is slightly dry. Very well done. Subdued, yet with a hoppy character. Not greatly hoppy like an APA. It balances it's bitterness with a nice grainy malt back bone and a very slight sweetness to make it quite drinkable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. Perfect for a session ale. A classic English pub style, executed extremely well. The best EPA I've had, well worth drinking.","Auraan","Jul 26, 2013"

4.02,1,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Enjoyed at Bohemia in St. Petersburg (FL), which, incidentally, may be the best spot in this town for quality food AND beer. This beer pours a rustic clay-amber hue and is capped with a soapy off-white head which is not as hearty as I was expecting, given the style. The nose is lightly floral with hints of honey and something like rosewater, and it shows very little caramel or butter for an EPA. The flavor shows a bit more of the sweet caramelized barley and offers a slightly citric hop note, in addition to the aforementioned floral nuance. This brew scores points with me for the overall skew of the profile away from buttery malt and earthy tea-like hop, towards a more clean, lively and zesty direction. The feel is quite nice, very refreshing and retains a great deal of tooth. Overall, this is a very nice brew, as are most Sam Smith's.","ktrillionaire","Aug 16, 2011"

I did not rate the beer down too much for this, because I would have been rating the beer on my expectations and not the quality of the beer.

This beer would also go well with roasted chicken, a variety of seafood dishes, or Indian food. Sometimes, the best beer and cheese pairings are easy to find if you stay local to the region. Try this beer with a mild, English cheese such as Caerphilly. The earthy, creaminess of this cow's milk cheese will pair beautifully with the citric qualities in the beer.","KDeLibero","Feb 24, 2011"

The organic version seems more complex but you can't beat the balance of the origional pale ale. Feels a bit full in the mouth for a Pale Ale but that is a minor complaint.

4.12,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"This beer pours a nice buttery yellow with a bright white head that quickly settles to a thin film. The smell is a bit unusual for a pale ale as there is a significant amount of yeasty esters giving off clean fruit aromas. This is over the top of a bit of mineral tang which seems standard for lighter beers from sam smith and a base of pale malt. The fruit is upfront in the taste but followed by classic pale ale bready malt flavor. This is balanced by just enough hop bitterness yet the other hop characteristics are relatively low key. The mouthfeel is quite lively as the carbonation is moderate to high and the finish is pretty dry and clean leaving a bit of bitterness and light fruit. Overall a surprising beer that is quite different from Samuel Smith's standard pale ale.","fank2788","Nov 27, 2010"

Fully clear, yet with a haze, light catching a glance of the sun on a summery day, pumpkin orange with some yellowing near the rims, hardly any visible carbonation. There's a thickness to the nose which belies its fresh lift, the sour orange to grapefruit citrus creates a full zest in your nostrils, more yeast than bread, plain yogurt, uncooked oatmeal, maltiness appears more textural than presence of specific scents, dollop of dried honey, green apple and pear, sneaky and hard to describe complexity. Medium-bodied, much more firm than heavy, sets itself authoritatively in your mouth. Lots of mandarin orange, grapefruit, lemon citrus, pulp richness and neither sweet nor sour. More yeast and yogurt with more multi-grain bread with some honey mixed in. Same late harvest apple, pear, peach character, ripe without too much juiciness. Momentary shadow of flowers and hops stiffens the finish and brings punctuation. While pleasing to just throw back not a simple sipper either.","farrago","Sep 24, 2010"

The taste is has the same equilibrium as the aroma. There is nice malt up front, and a slightly hoppy finish. It lacks a little of the pizazz that the aroma has, but it is solid nonetheless. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a wonderful beer.

The aroma is quite nice and simple, with that nice fruity british ale yeast ester character, mixed with the smell of sweet caramel malts. A very clean aroma. This is a tasty beer: first flavors are the mild fruity english ale esters, which mix in very well with the crystal malts to form a beautifully balanced, dry, refreshing ale. The finish is slightly crisp, and dries the mouth, kind of like tea does, in a very refreshing sort of way. The carbonation is plenty strong, but not excessive, and easily bites through the body of this beer. I could drink several of these. This is such a well balanced beer.

The mouthfeel is full not fizzy, not syrupy; but liquid that can taste flavorful, while doing what beer is meant to do, quench your thirst. Their is a fine balance in this beer that allows hints of sweetness and grain to come and go on your tongue without as much dry bitter flavor as an English style ESB.

It tastes of faintly tart fruit, leaves, citrus (esp. lemon), with hints of yeasty toast and butter.

The nose displays quite a bit of yeasty fruitiness (tangerine, apricot) and some mineralish character over a biscuity malt. It's smooth in the mouth with a medium-light body and gentle tingle from the moderate carbonation. Fruitiness appears up front in the flavor, lightly tart and citrusy over a bready and biscuity malt base that's just slightly caramelish.

Through the finish herbal hops emerge and dry everything out. I get a favor faint note of cocoa in the finish, which seems odd, given the presumed malt-bill, but not out of place flavorwise at all.

Flavor was middle of the road, some malts, a touch of hops, some wheat notes, with some lemony crispness toward the finish. Mouthfeel was light and thirst quenching. Really did the job.

This beer is a nice orangey brown with just a slight head. There's lots of banana and phenol in the nose -- very similar to other Sam Smith's beers. Tasting reveals that familiar Sam Smith's sweetness, but this beer is differentiated by the pleasant, just-above-mild bitterness in the hop finish.

The smell was kind of subtle but nice with a very earthy hop scent and mild citrus notes in there too.

The aroma is fruity and a bit musty. The first sip is full of fairly sweet, caramel malt flavor, and gets fruitier and juicier towards the finish. A light bitterness exerts itself about two thirds of the way to the finish, which is flowery, slightly dry and lightly bitter. The taste of minerals that the Tadcaster brewing water and unique fermentation is famous for shows up towards the finish; especially as this pint comes up to room temperature. Overall, a very easy drinkin' English ale, with some delicate flavors that are probably eclipsed by other more assertive British brews. It's certainly worth trying and makes for a good session beer; athough a bit strong for such classification.","marcobrau","Aug 31, 2004"

The taste shows the same malty and fruity notes as the smell; caramel, figs, apples, raisins, pears, with a thick herbal/straw like/grassy hoppiness, lasting in the palate. Hints of alcohol, kind of surprising since its only 5%. I didnt really think about the mouthfeel as I had this beer. It was hard to isolate it from the taste. Is that a sign of weakness? Maybe.

I believe this to be a very good beer and a fine example of a British Bitter. I would put it at the top of my list of bitters, but it still won't top out Sam Smith's Pure Lager on my pecking order.

Apple undertones and a biscuity base. Hops don't work with the malts too well and seem a bit off. But this is definitely a nice easy beer to drink and relax to.

3.33,-16.3,3.5,3,3.5,4,3,"For an organic ale, this isn't bad at all. I've had some really gross organic beer, and this one was pretty much normal. Aside from the buttery flavor, it's a tasty brew. Worth a try at least once.","UnionMade","Sep 29, 2003"
3.78,-5,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Appears a copper orange with a fluffy textured creamy head nice sized sticks around for a bit and leaves full ring of lacing with each sip very nice appearance here. Aromatics include a delicate floral hop aroma with a choir of biscuit malt singing in the background. As for the taste nice complex yet subtle flavors including a fruit presence in the malt deriven sweetness not bad at all more of the biscuity flavor profile, and hop burps are apparent just mildly hopped delicate "Organically Produced" ale. Mouthfeel well can't complain slightly syrup in the texture medium body smooth wish I found it on cask. Drinkability could very well be a session except I bought this for 3.50 for one bottle so, nope not going to make it a go to but decent and palatable.","WVbeergeek","Sep 12, 2003"

3.68,-7.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This is a nice ale by Samuel Smith. Pours a cloudy amber with a very nice white head. The beer is a great lace creator putting lots of sticky lace all over the glass. The nose is of both malt and hops with a decent balance of the two. The same is true of the taste which has a very substantial malt backing and good bitterness from the hops. Decent body although a little watery as it warms. Very drinkable brew.","AtLagerHeads","May 24, 2003"
3.38,-15.1,4,3.5,3,3,4,"Clear golden appearance with a whitish medium-bubbled head of about 1/4 of an inch and decent duration. Nice slightly thick and complex laces. Fairly un-aromatic and surprisingly grassy for a Pale, almost like a Grolsch in aroma. Malt is straightforward, minimal brown sugar and a bit of freshly-baked white bread. Hops are minimal, slight sense of paprika and re-inforced by the aroma close to the swallow. This brew has a tight balance, but unfortunately, the body was pretty lacking to me -- a teeter-totter balanced by little weight on either side. Too expensive to be a session brew of choice for me, but it is certainly drinkable.","ADR","Apr 15, 2003"

Pours a golden color with a thin white head and a little carbonation and thin lacing. Earthy, fruity and yeasty aroma. On this thin side and lacking in any obvious flavor. Unbalanced but drinkable, still I'll go back to the Imperial Stout next time.","Dogbrick","Jan 14, 2003"
4.5,13.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a thin and pale amber color with a big frothy white head that billows out of the glass and coats the sides while drinking. Nose is quite floral with notes of fresh lemon and citrus. Smooth and crisp in the mouth. Taste is a combination of a sweet fruitiness and a bready maltiness blended nicely with just the right amount of hop bitterness. Finish is crisp and refreshing. This is a very enjoyable ale and a great session brew.","Morris729","Jan 12, 2003"

This is the third Tadcaster that I have been disappointed with. I surrender. It is just a medeocra beer, light with no body. Just a step above the Macros.","bewareOFpenguin","Dec 15, 2002"

4.51,13.3,5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Sam Smith’s Organically Produced Ale:  In an Imperial Pint bottle (18.7 ounces).  Brown bottle.  A deep golden yellow beer, with a thick, creamy head that lasts and lasts.  Mild aroma, very faint malt aromas.  The initial taste is not impressive, but then the fullness and richness of the beer hits.  Very, very smooth mouthfeel.  The taste is not at all sweet, but rather is a very biscuit/rye bread malt taste, which is very pleasant.  There is a crisp bite of hops that helps this beer finish clean.  Well-balanced, and it is very easy to drink.  I can imagine sipping this one throughout the night.","jackndan","Nov 11, 2002"

Medium body and smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Starts with big malt flavors, but not sweet, more of a grain or bread-like taste. Follows with some light sweetness and finishes with a touch of citrus and hop flavor, with a slightly bitter end. Very easy and pleasing to drink. Would make a good session brew. And it's quite tasty.","Lupe","Nov 02, 2002"

Nice malty aroma with just a hint of spice.  The flavor is very clean with a small lingering hop bite and a drier malt character.  Very drinkable and quite a bit tastier than many of its extra pale peers.","beernut7","Oct 10, 2002"
3.76,-5.5,4,3,4,4,4,"Pours a slightly hazy but brilliant copper color.  Smells of of sweet must with a little bread and yeast.

Aroma consists of esters up front, giving way to light-medium toasted malt and moderate hop. Taste is spot on classic English ale. Precisely balanced flavors; malted biscuits, semi-tart yeast, relatively assertive hops. Smooth, slick mouthfeel. Well done.","John","Aug 15, 2002"

Decent palate, malty, caramely with a nice complement of hops, very balanced. Slightly malty finish with a kiss of hops at the very end. Medium body.

4.03,1.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Golden in hue with a crystal - clear, almost lager - like clarity.  Moderate but persistant ivory - white head leaves lace.  The surpisingly refined aroma consists of a slight floral Goldings hop nose, and crystal malt sweetness. Unripe pear and tart fruit yeast esters round it out. The mouthfeel is quite smooth partly due to the relatively low carbonation, but residual dextrins add to the smoothness as well.  The mild hop bitterness does its job in balancing the mild malt sweetness.  Although not dominant, the tart fruity esters are well integrated and add complexity.  The signature diacetyl flavor is much less pronounced than other Sam Smiths brews.  Although it's not as complex in flavor as other English pales, the overall balance of hop, malt and esters make for quite a quaffable brew.  Why doesn't Sam Smiths used brown bottles for all their brews?  This one tasted fresh and definitely unskunked.","marc77","Apr 13, 2002"
4.13,3.8,3.5,3,4.5,5,4.5,"Pale lager like appearance was a bit of a letdown, I was expecting a darker brew.  Good head retention, but only slight lacing.
