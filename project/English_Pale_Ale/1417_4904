3.67,-1.1,4.25,2.25,4.25,3.75,4,"500ml bottle pours nice deep bronze color with bright white head that slowly settled to a lasting thin 1/2 pencil head. The aroma was malty with a hint of fruit hut all in all the aroma is low with a very little citrusy hop presence. Taste is malt forward rich bread and caramel notes throughout the palate. Bitterness is strong which leaves a nice dry finish. A very refreshing sessionable beer that is one on my favorite English bitters I had while in the UK.","CStang67","Jan 23, 2015"

3.8,2.4,,,,,,"This pours beautifully, as an English Ale should. Nice foamy head that gradually dissipates. Black Sheep leaves some faint lacing and has minimal carbonation- again, true to the style. The flavors are excellent - caramel, nuts and overall  earthiness with a minimal hop profile. This is a wonderful beer - a nice treat when I feel a longing for a plough man's lunch at the local.","Bunman3","Nov 16, 2014"
