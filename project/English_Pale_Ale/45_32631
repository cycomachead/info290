2.1,-41.2,3.25,2.5,2,1,2,"Overall (2/5): Brooklyn Summer Ale is just not a very good beer; for me it epitomizes the problems with summer beer. Its light body and light flavor are simply not interesting; inadequate carbonation only makes things worse. The 80 on BA and the style listing being English Pale Ale is a quite deceptive. This is mediocre to bad beer that doesn't even get the simple task of quenching one's thirst right.","hagbergl","Jul 11, 2014"

Aromas of bread sweet pilsner malt offset with some floral and spicy hops and just a touch of earth. The flavor follows the aroma. Sweet bready malt with enough spicy hop to balance but add a bit of non descript fruit. Light to medium body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a bit of a watery mouthfeel. Nice enough easy drinking beer, I prefer a bit more flavor and body, but this would do fairly well on a sweltering summers day.","johnnnniee","Jun 14, 2014"

Taste is big on the bread malt with some underlying citrus flavor that blends with the malt for a very pleasant finish.

Taste of lemon zest, lime, pear, apple, cracker, bread, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, cracker, bread, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a bit. Nice and pleasant balance of malt and hop flavors; with no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a smooth and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is very solid blonde ale. Good balance of malt and hops flavors; and very smooth to drink.

The finish is dry and enjoyably malty. Any hops in here are fairly well hidden. A lot of "summer" beers are hit and miss for me and this is a hit. Definitely one of the better ones.

This helped to maintain smoothness and ease of drinkability through to the end of the glass, with no one flavor or component really outshining or overpowering any of the others. The core ingredients, however, felt a bit cheap, with adjuncty inclusions to the malt bill, and a rather skimpy hop thrust. While the hops were there, you had to look for them, meaning that you were left looking for the refreshment and cleanliness in your beer. This is really not the drinker’s job for a commercially available summer beverage that you would hope would want to do the job for you. That said, the beer went down smoothly enough, and is definitely something you could swill a few of while taking in playoff hockey at a bar with some friends.","TheBrewo","Jun 24, 2013"

It pours a hazy golden orange color, and a quickly vanishing fizzy head. The aroma is primarily a dull, earthy hop character that is expected for an English-style pale ale, but it lacks depth. The flavor profile is more varied, with a biscuity malt base balancing against a combination of lemony, grassy, and earthy hops. The fine, prickly carbonation drowns out any sense of complexity, though. Overall, this is a light and drinkable beer, but it is mostly uninteresting.","devilben02","Sep 07, 2012"

I'd call it more of an American/English pale ale hybrid. You get the malt notes that are common in English style beers with the citrus hop flavors that are usual in American ales. Brooklyn Brewery should consider renaming this one, if for no other reason than to stand out in a sea of bland Summer Ales.","JamesMN","Aug 22, 2012"

Cool that it comes in cans also, for festivals and camping purposes; smart because thats really its only application. Descent summer brew...","DrinkSlurm","Jun 23, 2012"
4,12,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a medium yellow with a frothy white head. Smell is pleasant and more powerful than expected. Hops up front with some malt coming through as well. The taste is a nice mix from start to finish of the hops and malt, with a bready flavor. A nice crisp beer, light mouthfeel, nothing overpowering and great flavors. Overall a great summer beer, great session beer.","wingman14","Jun 23, 2012"

This is a simple brew that's quite tasty and easy drinking, especially during the summer. The mouthfeel is good light with good carbonation. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation.

4.1,14.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Nice lemony citrus aroma with abit of grassiness comes out of a very pale beer. The lacing recedes very quickly. This beer is very refreshing, and unique in the world of summer ales. It is very quenching and dry, with a bit of citrusy hop flavor, but you have to search for it. Carbonation is spot on for a summer quaffer. And that's just what this beer is for me. Nothing more, nothing less. Very well done and is a great summer beer if you want to quench your thirst with a very well-made light ale. Incredibly drinkable.","Finn","Aug 26, 2011"

The taste is slightly bitter with just a hint of lemon, and sour grain with a bitter citrus and grassy aftertaste. The beer is light with lots of carbonation and a dry finish. This is better than most summer beers and I really enjoyed the slightly sour accent.","JMad","Aug 25, 2011"
3.5,-2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pale, brassy clarity, and the lacing puts on a good show while sticking to the glass. Hoppy, salty, fresh grain, very faint butter, taffy and a hint of apple skin in the nose. Crisp with enough smoothness to get by; semidry, malty palate. Very savory for a summer brew—fresh and light biscuity grain meets a subtle salt and butter combo. Hops drop a leafy herbal component on top. Very drinkable, and among the more complex summer seasonals out there.","BeerAdvocate","Aug 24, 2011"
4,12,4,4,4,4,4,"It's a summer ale so don't expect anything too complex but Brooklyn do a good job of combining a few different styles in one thirst quenching beer.

The scent has a lot of buttery diacetyl, which is what I love about this style, as well as some biscuity caramel malt, with a fair amount of citrusy hops as well. The taste starts off with a nice, bready malt profile, nice caramel interlaced with the diacetyl, a nice amount of fruitiness which I think is coming from the yeast, a nice amount of hops which are mildly bitter, pretty floral and give off slight citrus tones as well. Just a dash of lemon zest. Medium bodied and somewhat dry.","Tballz420","Aug 19, 2011"

2.06,-42.3,3,2,2,2,2,"About the only thing they got right on this beer is the carbonation. If you live here in the Land of 10,000 Lakes, it'll remind of a high-end version of Schmidt, particularly with the aftertaste (that's not a good thing). Only thing is, Schmidt costs half of what this beer does. Other than a slight grapefruit tang, it's bitterness has no complexity and almost no malt to offset it, so it's watery and unsatisfying. They were going for crisp and refreshing and fell short. Right now, I'm regretting passing up the Sierra Nevada Summerfest Lager (which I know is good). Sometimes you try a new beer against your suspicions, and it pays off. This was not one of those occasions. I know Beer Advocate requests that we respect what the brewer was going after, but in a case like this where you get a cheap tasting beer for an expensive price, people deserve to know.","Merchant46","Jul 04, 2011"
3.32,-7,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Taste was decent. Definitely in the summer style. I felt like it was a cross between an IPA and a stronger Blue Moon. It was just hoppy enough that faded and lent way to a citrus taste. It was refreshing and light, but ultimately not my thing.","kevo237","Jul 03, 2011"
3.5,-2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - Not a bad beer, but really nothing particularly special.

The smell light citrus and by light, if you see some one put an orange wedge in this, take their glass remove the orange and chuck it at their head, is by far the best, not to much but no lacking. There is not need to enhance the taste with a freaking slice of orange. The carbonation to this summer delight, I feel is, again not a can of Bud, but not a can of Guinness canned Draught Stout .

As for an English Pale Ale? I don't know about that. Maybe the keg has been sitting for awhile and the hop character has died down a bit and a fresher beer might've been more hoppy, which I think would've been desirable. Still, worth it for what it is.

This faded reluctantly down to just a small thin film across the top and that pretty much stayed the entire time. Now there was a good amount of side glass lace present here and this had a really nice effect of the look of this. I know it was a pale ale, but it was really starting to look like an IPA. Smell was very hopped, but also nice and light. Very nice blend of floral hops and light grassy grains. The flavor was very similar to this as well. A very nice hopped up front greeted you right away and was quickly followed up by the nice and almost a touch of sweet grain like back to it. Long drawn out dry finish left a really nice taste and follow through. The feel was great. Lots of carbonation really helping to push it along and lighten it up nicely","mikesgroove","Feb 25, 2011"

It's fairly light, of course, but there are some earthy hops on the finish to add a little interest.

Smells a bit earthy, with green/spicy hops and a dash of sea salt. It has a mild, yet pleasant flavor, with bready/biscuity malts, a light, crisp fruitiness, and the same hops as in the aroma, which contribute loads of flavor but impart only a mild bitterness.

A hint of butterscotch in the aroma, accompanied by a fragrant EKG herbal hop scent. First sip if full of sweet Marris Otter and delicate Two-row, with a strong toasted note and mild caramel backing it up. The aftertaste starts out hoppy like soft Fuggles and herbal EKG, then a slightly spicy Tettnanger or Hallertau flavor brings the taste into perfect balance and level bitterness. A suggestion of diacetyl and fruity english ale character slowly becomes more apparent and pairs with the medium carbonatiion and light body to achive a mouthfeel that is both lively and complex, but also non-cloying and lusciously smooth. The finish is malty but not residual and the hop tones fade away gradually with the mineral character. The drinkability is simply phenomenal and this beer is a testament to the lower ABV styles that are just as satisfying as the modern-day Double and Imperial ales of great strength.","PBRstreetgang","Jul 20, 2007"

The maltiness is quite distinct, however, hitting you squarely in the nose aroma-wise, and then following in the flavor. It's straw-like, grassy, and a touch earthy - and the hops that follow are very much the same. To guess, I'd imagine there's some Maris Otter mixed with a non-floor malted base, and Fuggles with a bit of Goldings thrown in. There's a mild bit of fruitiness to it, but it's really just about the rounded malt and hop profile. It's not complex, but it's not intended to be. It's lighter than a pale ale, well, at least less bitter, and basically just a nice, easy drinking ale that's got some nice flavor to it.","NeroFiddled","Jul 02, 2007"

3.73,4.5,3.5,3,4,4,4,"Crisp and refreshing at the opening of the sip, and not nearly as bubbly as I feared. Late breaking wheat taste is easy on the palate. Recovers nicely from a substandard outward measure. Definitely could be consumed in quantity in the summer months, particularly outside. Worthy of the Brooklyn moniker.","daliandragon","Jun 10, 2007"
3.13,-12.3,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Light golden body with lots of bubbly carbonation. The smell is strong in the grassy grains over a light texture of wheat, similar to a classic pilsener. Light in the mouth and quite easy drinking with a sharp bite of carbonation and just a hint of bitterness at the finish. Very different from your stereotypical "summer ale" by staying away from the citrusy fruits that we are accustomed to. Not bad, just not what you would expect from the style.","Neehan","Jun 08, 2007"
3.72,4.2,3,3.5,4,4,3.5,"D. definately a session beer.","pieper","Jun 08, 2007"
4.12,15.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,5,"12oz bottle from Lou's in Augusta. Light amber almost yellow body with a thin film of off-white head. Citrusy hops and caramel malt equally share the aroma, though it's not overpowering. Biscuit malt plays a big role, with some citrus hops in the background, along with hints of a mint-like quality. Again, not overpowering. Light in body making this very drinkable. All around enjoyable light summer beer, though having enough good flavor and aroma to satisfy. One of the best summer beers I've had.","MrHurmateeowish","Jun 06, 2007"
2.96,-17.1,4,3,3,2,3,"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- *Extremely* puffy and fizzy in the mouth... disappointing and unlike any other offering I can recall from BB.","yelterdow","Jun 05, 2007"
3.5,-2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Eeeh... It's beer. A blond alte style that is basically dull and problematic that is modestly improved by a slight wheat addition. Curious as to why a brewery the caliber such as Brookly would even bother. The beer pours a brightly colored straw with active carbonation that is held below 7-up status by the wheat texture. Smells half malty, half grainy and with a light lemon-gass note. The flavors closely mimic the aromas with emphasis on the light malts. The feel is light, and kept from watery by the wheat additions. Fairly clean and crisp in the finish with a light grain-hust astringecy and hoppiness. It's a fine hot-weather brew, but does not inspire any deep thoughts or contemplation.","BEERchitect","Jun 05, 2007"

3.55,-0.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Pours a clean, clear amber color with a two-finger head which dissipates slowly leaving a nice amount of lace along the glass. The aroma is floral but biscuity at the same time. No citrus, but some faint light fruit scents. A subtle earthy feel to it all around. The taste is clean and refreshing, with distinct wheat beer notes. Some yeasty character as well, with a decent hop balance. I'm not sure of the ABV here, but there's a slight alcohol pang in the aftertaste that I could do without. But for the most part it's a very tasty beer. Not too complex, but to the point and refreshing. Mouthfeel is nothing to write home about, but it's an entirely drinkable beer. And true to its name, this is a great summertime session beer. Just don't go in with super high expectations and you'll be relatively pleased.","Atlas1","Jun 02, 2007"
3.33,-6.7,3.5,3,3,4,4,"Nothing earth shattering about this beer...but for something I can get at the bodega at the end of my block it's pretty awesome...great for just kicking back on a lazy hot night","DaggerEyes","May 30, 2007"
3.28,-8.1,3.5,3,3,3.5,4,"Notes: I had it with grilled teriyaki shrimp skewers with pineapple over a mesclun greens salad, and it was a decent match for such a light meal. Not a terribly interesting brew as far as taste or nose goes, but as a light, easy drinking summer ale it fits the bill.","Kendo","May 29, 2007"
3.35,-6.2,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"On tap at Mammosers in Hamburg,NY.Poured from the tap a dull light to medium golden a thin white head sat atop not much retention to it,light toasted grain aromas with a faint citrus note but its really faint.Crisp and dry toasted cereal grain-like flavors with a mild citric quality showing thru in the finish.Kinda boring to another run of the mill summer ale I suppose.","oberon","May 27, 2007"
3.05,-14.6,3,3,3,2.5,3.5,"Overall: Just a plain, non exciting brew that isn't quite an American Wheat, but doesn't fit anywhere else. A little below average, won't go back.","Illinick","May 24, 2007"
3.62,1.4,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Brewed and bottled in Utica. First saw this last year at Croxley's Ale House on Long Island as a draft-only beer. The bartender did not know much about the beer, except that it was called a "summer ale". I did not review it then as it was dark in the bar and I had been drinking other beers beforehand. This is basically Brooklyn's Light Dinner Ale (2 reviews listed; aka Croxley's Blonde Ale - 1 review listed) put into a bottle. Pours a clear, bright gold with a nice white head. The English malt gives it a faint bready smell and flavor. At 4.5% ABV, it is an easy drinking light-bodied beer. The flavor will not knock your socks off, but it does finish with a clean, crisp, lemony-citrus bitterness that reminds you are not drinking a macro lager. Not meant for the beer-geek crowd by any means, but it should make its way into some coolers during the warm summer months.","BeerFan","May 21, 2007"
3.3,-7.6,3,3,3,4,4,"Actually quite crisp and clean. Again, this is not a bad beer, but it doesn't seem to fit the style.","bluegrassbrew","May 18, 2007"
3.07,-14,2.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Pours transparent yellow with almost no head. Looks much like a maco lager. I could barely pick up a malt smell to it but I guess it was there. The taste is pretty average. Sweet carmel malt and it finishes very clean. Mouthfeel is low carbonation with a medium weight body. Somewhat watery and goes down smooth. This is pretty drinkable and I bet it would be a great transition beer for the BMC drinker (since they are so similar).","PittBeerGirl","May 18, 2007"
2.59,-27.5,3.5,2,2,3,4,"Yes, this is a "summer type" of beer. Yes it is light and drinkable. Other than that, I can't say much about it. I hate to say it, but it's a bit of a disappointment from Brooklyn. Usually they produce some great brews... this one just doesn't impress. I know the label says Ale, and BA says american pale wheat... but I swear that If I tasted this blind, that I'd guess it was a continental lager, and a mediocre one at best. The one thing that this beer does well, is it will appeal to many of the uninitiated, and welcome them to the world of good beer, and great Brooklyn products. Other than that... I won't be buying it again.","phisig137","May 18, 2007"
2.85,-20.2,2.5,2.5,3,3,3,"12 oz bottle poured into a standard pint glass. Appearance was a hazy golden yellow- typical standard "summer ale" colors. Smell was of citrus fruits most noticeably, lemons. The taste was light and fruity- not much going on here- highly carbonated. This is a sessionable brew with the 4.9% ABV, but this one lacks character and distinction.","DavidSeanNJ","May 18, 2007"
3.03,-15.1,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Pours a clear golden,with a fluffy head. Not much retention or lacing. Smell is of weak citrus. Body is light with some carbionation. Taste is of light citrus up front,with a bitter finish. This beer was disappointing. Average,but just barley. I would not drink it again.","riversider76","May 18, 2007"
3,-16,3,3,3,3,3,"D - Good session beer. Not much seperating it from the other Summers I've had; a lot less phenolic than the Saranac.","yourunclewalt","May 14, 2007"
3.86,8.1,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"The lower abv. fits the busy summer season. On the go this beer won't way you down, it does the quenching thing after a mow and even the macro-friends will handle and like this brew.","chilidog","May 12, 2007"
3.13,-12.3,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Yet another Americal pale wheat that dares to be unoriginal. It's easy enough to drink, but doesn't even begin to challenge the palate. This is one of those wide-open styles that seems to invite (if not embrace) varied interpretations - yet many still brew these plain renditions. This particular beer is well crafted, but thoroughly uninspired - as are many in the style.","MaltyGoodness","May 11, 2007"
3.65,2.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I was not expecting a light style beer at all. The Brooklyn Summer Ale tasted a lot lighter than Sam Adams' Summer Ale with a little more clean water and no perceptible hint of alcohol. This beer would be good for lounging around while watching the Dallas Cowboys trying to play tough with the Phili Eagles like I did today with a roast beef hero.","bonbright7","Oct 08, 2006"
