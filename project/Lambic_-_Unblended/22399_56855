4,8.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a cloudy yellow body with abundant, effervescent carbonation bubbles and a one finger bubbly head. Overall impression of appearance is of a nice lambic in color, perhaps a bit too much carbonation for an unblended lambic, but quite on point for a Geuze. Scents of funky barnyard yeast, a bit of a smokey and enteric quality, which while usually demerits for a lambic are not unpleasant here, though these aromas fade quickly, replaced by light fruity, including citrus and apple, hints of honey, light hints of tea and mild honey aromas. Overall impression of aroma is of a sour ale that is quite nice, sour, wild, barnyard and fruity combine nicely to form a good aroma profile. Flavor begins highly sour with notes of barnyard funk, Kombucha tea, light lemon juice and light green apple. Middle is still sour, with notes of tea, Kombucha tea and barnyard funk with notes of hay. Finish is tart and somewhat dry with notes of hay, Kombucha tea, tea leaves and light green apple. Aftertaste is tart with notes of Kombucha tea, green tea and light fruity flavors. Overall impression of flavor is of a very funky, barnyard-forward sour with a very apparent Kombucha flavor also present. Unique and quite pleasant and refreshing. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation and a tart, puckering feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a light, highly carbonated sour that is quite refreshing. Overall this is a nice beer. Perhaps a bit too simple in flavor, but its aroma makes up for that, and the flavor is still quite nice. A good, refreshing beer and an interesting version of a lambic.","Auraan","Mar 14, 2015"

3.9,5.7,4,4,4,4,3.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy bright golden straw color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of tart lemon, pear, green apple, hay, straw, grass, herbal tea, wheat, leather, oak, musty funk, light vinegar, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/funky yeast, herbal tea, and oak notes; with good strength. Taste of lightly tart lemon, pear, green apple, hay, straw, grass, herbal tea, wheat, leather, oak, musty funk, light vinegar, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very slight tartness/spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, green apple, hay, straw, grass, herbal tea, wheat, leather, oak, musty funk, light vinegar, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of fruity/funky yeast, herbal tea, and oak barrel flavors; with a great balance of the tea and lambic character with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 3.5%. Overall this is a very nice spiced unblended lambic. All around good complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, herbal tea, and oak barrel flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 21, 2014"

Left a touch of lace as it diminished into a thin froth. The nose is quite nice with a huge bouquet. I felt like I was in a citrus stand on a fine mid morning in summer near a farm. Lots of tartness of lemon, orange, and acid that is meshed with the tiniest whiff of a well tended field behind a farm. The quaff is refreshing, crisp, and effervescent. I can easily down the whole glass but I do prefer to savor it. It pairs very well with shrimp cocktail. Overall, a steal for $12/750ml.

For a beer of little ABV (3.5%) it packs a punch in the flavor dept. This could easily be set down in a cellar for years with no ill affect.

I have blended beer and kombucha in my brewing - mostly not very successfully - so I wanted to try this for a long time. I would be happy to brew something like this for refreshment ( with less herbal notes) and I would go through a keg easily over a few weeks.

3.8,3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Shared with a few friends on a Friday night. Pours a fairly clear pale golden color with a decent white head that shows moderate retention. Smells of tart and funk, no really. Lemons and yellow mustard mixed with truffles and barnyard. This is quite an odd aroma, but it kind of works. Taste is tart funk with a nice puckering of lemons dominating the flavor. Earthy barnyard mixed with fungi round out the flavor. Medium body, spirited level of carbonation and a puckering tart mouthfeel. I enjoyed trying this, but I couldn't see me drinking more than the 6 or so ounces I had in one sitting.","johnnnniee","Oct 11, 2011"
4,8.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Conclusion: I don't even know how to rate this beer. It feels a bit like it is in a class of its own, and I don't have anything to compare it too. Lambic is such a crazily broad style that I can't say that this beer fits or doesn't fit. I like beer like this, that just "is". I don't personally love the flavor of this beer, but I enjoy it enough to drink the rest of the bottle with pleasure. If only it were less carbonated...","allforbetterbeer","Sep 30, 2011"

There are lots of lemony and orangey flavors, the beer is very sweet, very light, refreshing, and definite summery aide. I wasn't picking up strong hints of the tea but the lambic is very evident. This beer is very naturally carbonated, especially right after the first pour. Things mellow a bit shortly thereafter. The beer is very low ABV, which comes as no real surprise because there is zero booziness to this beer, not even hints. It's an interesting, fizzy, almost champaigne like experience at low ABV. This one does push the dimensions of how divergent and varied beer can be. It's unique but I won't be rushing out for more anytime soon.","albern","Jul 02, 2011"

3.56,-3.5,4,3,4,3,3.5,"Finally, my first review of an Unblended Lambic! I was lucky enough to find this at Dutch's outside of Cincinnati. It pours a rich and severely cloudy apricot orange in color with a bright white head that quickly dissipated. It smells of tea leaves, honey, and mint. It's a nice threesome and formidable enough. The flavors are pretty subtle and the flavor fades very quickly. It tastes of tea leaves plus a belgian pale plus souring yeasts. The mix is kind of strange and awkward. The finish is so fast you have to ponder what just happened. It has a lightly sour tinge that leaves a leafy, minty flavor behind but like I've said, it's short lived. It drinks a little too light and as I've stated, it finishes fast. It's hard for me to fully endorse. Is it a solid drink? Yes. Is it worth it worth the 8.99 price tag? Also a yes. It's two older styles combined to make an interesting beer. I say go for it.","aasher","0"

3.92,6.2,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Not extremely familiar with kombucha, but it definitely sounds intriguing, especially when some lambic is involved as well. This concoction pours a hazy amber-orange juice topped by a bit more than a finger of fairly rapidly-diminishing white foam. The nose comprises orange peel, lemon zest, coriander, black pepper, parsley, clove, and limeade. The taste holds notes of lemon, lime, green apple, cinnamon, mild pepper (by this I mean hot, a la jalapeno or something), cilantro, and lightly tart green grapes. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a sticky feel. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this unique brew. I'm not sure I'd actively seek it out very often, but it is a very nice change of pace.","TMoney2591","Feb 28, 2011"
4,8.4,4,4,4,4,4,"The appearance is a orange cloudy body with a white frothy head. The nose is a bready orange combination with some lemon lime citrus in the back and some slight pepper and vinegar on the nose as well. It may sound hodgepodged, but it' actually really nice. The flavor carries the bready yeast flavor with it. The flavor I most prominently get is an orange-cinnamon flavor. There is a touch of the lemon tartness that carries throughout the body. I find everything about this beer to be greatly appropriate for both its style and my taste buds, it's a very good beer.","Vdubb86","Feb 28, 2011"

This place warrants a visit all on it's own, but a quick stop for a Vanberg & DeWulf's Lambrucha was just what I needed to strip away all the Mexican fats & flavors of Arturo's tacos. It's probably one of the most refreshing beers I have ever tried! Two of my favorite yeasty fermented flavors (lambic & kombucha) blended into one low ABV, palate cleansing beverage. Highly recommended if you can find it (apparently it's only currently available in Chicago).","burnheartsMKE","Feb 25, 2011"

4.04,9.5,3,4,4,4,4.5,"Golden clear with no head or lace, this doesn't look like much. The nose is actually pretty enjoyable. Lemon and tea are most noticeable, there's a herbal tea tannin character with mild spices. The kombucha contribution is rather noticeable. As it warms up, I get some spruce and juniper, this is mildly gruit like. The palate is the same, with more tea tannin, bright sour lemon and a drying finish that's got herbal tea and lemon peel. Light body, moderate carbonation, the finish is drying and tart. Solid stuff, this is pretty darned refreshing and quenching. I would drink this again.","DefenCorps","Oct 05, 2010"
3.4,-7.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"This is certainly an interesting combination, despite the similarities between kombucha and Lambic, I feel that the former dominates the flavor and aroma profile of this blend. Perhaps this is due to the simplicity of the lambic that was blended in. This is extremely light and refreshing and this definitely goes down quite easily on a warm summer's day. This last and the fact that it is an interesting use of kombucha are the main selling points for this. Worth trying, but I can't seriously see myself getting this again, but I am also not a huge kombucha person.","Gueuzedude","Sep 16, 2010"

Not sour in really any sense of the word. Fairly carbonated.

My favorite Kombucha, G.T.'s Kombucha, has been pulled off of shelves by the FDA as a result of a Lindsay Lohan (seriously!) instigated investigation into alcohol content in the G.T.'s.

4.3,16.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"wow. great concept. avante guarde and it works for me. hazy burnt gold with some glowing pink highlights. white head that fades pretty quick. Nose is barn, wet hay, lemon, preserved lemon, lemon rind, grapefruit, spice, minerals... sort of like a lambic, but sort of like something else. this is a very tough beer to review, and it must be even harder for people with no experience with kombucha. taste is tart/sour preserved lemon, wet hay/ barn and kombucha. perfectly blended to me. very good job. the line is blurred between what is beer and what is "tea" (or adjunct), and generally, that is the point in specialty/adjunct beers. light-medium body that seems beefed up by the prickly carbonation. supremely refreshing and super easy to drink. think gose, geuze, berliner-weisse with a little twist. great value as well as being a little milder than some of it's relatives, leaving your palate craving for more abuse. it may sound strange, but this beer reminds me of Miles Davis' Bitches Brew. It may seem harsh and biting to someone that doesn't know what they are getting in to, or to a mind that isn't open, but the raw, primal, living essence and soul of this beer speak volumes about where we've been and where we're going. extremely complex and flavorful for a beer with such a low abv. i'll be drinking several of these this summer.

2.07,-43.9,3.5,1.5,2,2,2.5,"This beer has a medium body which is on the lighter end of the spectrum and tastes more like a lambic than the aroma suggests. Very spicy up front with tight carbonation and hints of zesty pepper along with a slight puckering tartness which quickly fades into a slightly creamy lactic center. Dry finish. The vinegary presence from the aroma is the only sour/funky element of this beer but it is overpowered by the heavy spice presence and earthy tea leaf flavor. Also, some slight acidity. The tea leaves provide a slight tartness but really is just very earthy and unpleasant. An interesting idea that doesn't work so well.","corby112","May 09, 2010"
