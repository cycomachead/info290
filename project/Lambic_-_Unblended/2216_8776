4.01,-2.4,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"I couldn't have asked for a better beer after that long walk in the rain. The Drei Fonteinen's young lambik poured a pretty amber color with a thick and creamy white head. Carbonation was almost non-existent and the beer had a generally flat appearance aside from the froth. Vinous aroma that isn't shy on woodiness. Tart and dry with white wine and lactic notes. Balanced and easy going with a touch of citrus flavor in the finish.","DaPeculierDane","Nov 05, 2003"
4.18,1.7,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"sampled on cask at the brewery's restaurant. dark orange in color with a nice, thick head that lasts. smells tart and sweet, complexities showing immediatly. beautiful balance of sweet and dry flavors. finishes with a tartness, and dry enough to make me want more.","texashammer","Mar 02, 2003"
4.52,10,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5," This was the second straight Lambic that I had ever had, it was again far mellower than I was expecting. Of course it was 'sans-carbonation' (say it with a Cajun man accent its much more fun that way) and had a quite noticeable acidic aroma. The acidity promised in the nose was surprisingly subdued in the taste. It was much more of a balanced / mellow acidity, which I am surmising, was the result of a bit of age that helps to smooth out Lambics. The beer itself was quite a revelation. There was a fair amount of musty character, and an appetizing hint of mushroom and a bit of character nabbed from a proper strong stinky farmhouse cheese. All in all it was a great aperitif for the impending gastronomic exercise that I was about to have.","Gueuzedude","Beers"
