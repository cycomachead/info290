4.13,0,,,,,,"Similar flavors of lemon and crabapple, sharp and acidic sourness, not unlike straight lemon juice. Dry oaky finish, citrusy and a touch briny. Very low carbonation as is expected, body has substance though. Tasty and very sour, a slow sipper to savor. Bockor has brewed lambic since 1981, and their coolship is on the brewery's roof, little known fact...","emerge077","Oct 26, 2012"

3.9,0,,,,,,"D- really cool to see how the lambic process works with this 4 year old brew. I had this with the new lambic side by side and it was fucking cool to see how it changed. Mad props to the great lambic blenders.","oglmcdgl","0"
