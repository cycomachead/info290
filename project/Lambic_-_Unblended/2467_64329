4,0,,,,,,"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma has a lot of wheat and yeast notes, with some lemons also thrown in. The flavor is similar. I get some light funk, with some tart lemons, Belgian yeast and a hint of tartness. The beer is fairly dry and is easy to drink. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.","Mora2000","Dec 11, 2010"

4.21,0,,,,,,"Bottle: Poured a lightly hazy yellow color lambic with a super large foamy head with excellent retention and some very good retention. Aroma of light barnyard with some tart notes and dominating french oak notes. Taste is also heavily dominated by tart notes with light barnyard notes and some dry french oak notes. Acidity is well balanced by light sweet notes in the aftertaste. Body is somewhat full with great carbonation. Very easily drinkable thought maybe not as much as a Girardin gueuze.","Phyl21ca","0"
