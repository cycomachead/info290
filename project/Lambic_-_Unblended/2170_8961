4.15,-2.6,,,,,,"Has a low carbonation, which leads to a fruity beginning in which mandarin, oak and lemon peel stand out, accompanied with slightly lactic notes. Acidity get more intense, the longer it stays on the palate, leading to a very sour overall impression. Still, it is very enjoyable due to barley malt and dough yeast, keeping the beer in balance. Lemony fruitiness stays on the palate with a dry sourness, leading to an even dryer finish. Easy drinkable and complex at the same time.","aleigator","Beers"

Aroma gains complexity as the beer warms. Taste is sour with light carbonation. Not much alcohol present and a touch on the watery side. The bitterness lingers on finish. Very smooth and light overall with a nice sour kick that's not overpowering. Purchased for $40, a bit steep but enjoyable nevertheless.

The nose is amazing with a huge musty funk and sharp tartness along with hints of oak, sour lemon, and barnyard. The taste follows suit with sharp, almost cheesy notes initially along with hints of barnyard, tart lemon, earthy funk, and oak. The mouthfeel is smoothly sour with very little carbonation and a tart, puckering, oaky finish. Overall, an amazingly flavorful and hugely drinkable Lambic. Highly recommended!","beerdrifter","Jul 23, 2014"

4,-6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a pale golden orange body with minimal head and lace. The aroma is typical tart/sour with a touch of acidity as well as wood/oak. Brew is more of the same as the beer is smooth and easy to drink as it comprised mostly of a sharp, acidic sour tartness but it comes across less sour apple/cherry and more sour/tart tropical fruit. In other words, for as sour as this beer is there is a bit of both oaky woodiness and sweet fruit notes to this beer, and it's not just sour but also a touch of funkiness. These are the sours I like b/c it's more complex than drinking some highly carbonated sour juice that some beers of this style are like.","clayrock81","May 26, 2014"

Nuthin, but I expected that. Aroma of sour vinegar, sweet sugars, a tiny hint of mint. Smells very pleasant. Flavor is sour but not puckeringly so, sweet with some peachy influence, a bit of vinegar, fermented apples maybe, and a bit of spearmint in the back. Completely flat, but I was told to expect this. Honestly I think the flatness takes a bit away from the brew. Slightly dry finish. Mouthfeel is medium, but somewhat heavy for the lambic style that usually comes off extra dry and light to me. I like the flavors but the lack of carbonation isn't my thing. More like drinking a dry white wine than a beer. For $40+ I'd rather have a couple Fou Fones, or one of many other things. Glad I got to try it though, and get my Unblended Lambic tick.","BMMillsy","Feb 19, 2014"

Medium body, dry and tart in the finish. Low carbonation. This is a pretty amazing unblended lambic.

4.12,-3.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Right before the Tap & Table closed they were doing a beer of the week special. The description they had on this beer sounded like it would be pretty amazing. So I bit the bullet and bought a bottle to bring home with me. The following day I had gone to a friends place and we split the bottle together. Popped the cork out and gave it a pour, the hazy orange yellow liquid didn't produce much head or lacing. The smell was filling our noses before we even had put the glasses to our faces. The funky smell was very prominent, the deeper you breathe this one in the more aromas that come out. It had a really interesting sour grapefruit aroma in there mixed with earth and wood. The flavor of this beer is acidic at first, tart citrus flavors like grapefruits and some apple in there too. The taste then fades into a much smoother earth flavor. The mouthfeel is almost medium bodied. Overall I found this beer to be pretty good for it's style, I can't see myself ever buying it again because of the cost. I don't enjoy this style enough to drop almost $30 on one bottle. However if you like the style and you have the money do yourself the favor and try this, it's impressive.","Knapp85","Jul 05, 2011"

Poured yellow-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cherry, and funk. The flavor was of sweeet malt, cherry, funk, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The cherry aspect on this one was quite nice and enjoyable with the funkiness going on in it. This one was quite easy drinking with the earthy aspect.

I have never had a review that was this mixed, but I really think that this is a really good beer and that this particular bottle just lost some fizz.

It doesnÂt quite hold up in flavor where it is juicy, horsey and astringent. There is this herbal bite that feels almost like a tame jalapeno, which would be paired with a straight hay juice shot.
