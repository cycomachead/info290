Served from a 10 L bag-in-a-box into a Drie Fonteinen ‘3 Fountains’ Gueuze glass. Poured a golden yellow-orange with a minimal white head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, vinegar, fruit, and subtle cherry. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, cherry, and subtle vinegar. It had a light feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. This was my first time experiencing an unblended lambic in “cask” form. It was really quite interesting. All of the flavors were very delicate rather than being bold and in your face. This one was quite still from a carbonation standpoint. I’m really glad that I got the opportunity to try this one.","thagr81us","Jul 15, 2009"

4.27,10.3,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Served from a traditional stoneware crock that had been filled from the barrel. This beer was completely flat, it had a lemony sour aroma with a hint of mustiness to it. Lightly sour, completely dry and devoid of sweetness. Tastes a bit of grapefruit with a hint of pepper/ spiciness in the finish. A bit of astringency as well could be detected. Overall quite refreshing and thirst quenching. My strongest flavor association is one of grapefruit.","Gueuzedude","Beers"
