5,14.9,5,5,5,5,5,"Pours an energetic ruby tinged amber with incredible, very fine carbonation. The head rises to about one to one and a half fingers and then quickly recedes. It is very unusual to find such fine, champagne-like carbonation with the light beer body to hold the bubbles together and produce such a fine mouthfeel. The aromas include some fruit and citrus – maybe grapefruit punctuated by a little barnyard. There are so many tastes, they are so well blended and balanced and they create such a flow of flavor in your mouth that it is hard to identify them all. There is a little fruit, malt, and a couple of different hop aspects. You can taste both the old lambic hops (dull, stale with a lot of tannins) with the fresher hop character (spicy and bitterer). The beer also has a wine-like quality to it as well as the kind of oak you would get with an oaky chardonnay. The tartness balances well with the different varieties of the hop. The tannins from the old hops and the bitterness and spiciness from the newer hops, the lemony/grapefruity tartness, and the barnyard funkiness all blend together in a very amazing way.","pat61","Mar 18, 2015"

Creates a vivid, tart mouthfeel, driven by a dough, leathery funkiness. The taste inherits both, green apples and musty white grapes among a gentle amount of white citrus peel, accompanied by their earthier stonepits. Malts turn even more intense during the finish, calming the brews lactic acidity, while creating a very interessting counterpart to citrus peel and mild hops.","aleigator","Feb 12, 2015"

4.31,-0.9,,,,,,"Had this one at the source: Cantillon Brewery itself. Pours golden, clear, with a nice fluffy white head on top and lots of floaties (got the bottom of the bottle here). Aroma is straw, a bit of tripel-like funky yeast, some vinegar, dryness. Flavor follows closely with funky yeast, straw hops notes, pears, apples, dryness on the finish with lingering grass and yeast funk together. Very light bodied, super crisp, and pretty refreshing. Unique brew with plenty of sour, but also an interesting note with the addition of the cold hopping. Liked this significantly more than I even expected. Good stuff.","BMMillsy","Sep 12, 2014"

Given that it's unblended, I can only imagine that the beer itself changes somewhat from year to year, with the fermentation being spontaneous. I would be curious to sample other vintages to see how different it actually gets.","LambicPentameter","Sep 07, 2014"
4.75,9.2,,,,,,"Sweet and sour tart right up front. A sense of sour funked out candied peaches and apricots that were left out in a damp basement for a few weeks. Tiny hint of some raspberries. Almost like a pollen filled spring day in a meadow. Fizzy carbonation (just right) leaves a perfect dryness to the finish. Almost champagne-like. Mild hop bitterness (as compared to American beers) dance well with the aforementioned flavors. A star! My first Cantillon- Enjoying in Le Maraise in Paris! Will go back and get more methinks.","JeffoC6","Sep 07, 2014"

4.6,5.7,,,,,,"totally different stuff from cantillon here. all barley malt instead of some amount of wheat in here make it quite a bit more sturdy then their lambic types, and the hops are definitely more aggressive in flavor, although still really mild, especially by American standards. the beer has a darker caramel color to it, plenty of hazy as per usual with cantillon, and a tall and lasting dull muted whited head of tiny bubbles. the nose is more funk than sour, with some textured sweetness in there, and then of course the oaky mature lacto thing to finish. the taste is just like the nose, exactly like it, with the barley malt influencing this beer more in terms of body I think than flavor. the hops have an earthy dried herbal character to them than likes the bigger body, and carbonation is effervescently bright. I like the slightly richer feel to this, and the longer finish not usually there in their lambic. maybe a little less unique and distinct than some of their other beers, like say fou foune or the lou pepe fruit beers, but I think its quality is as good as any, and its definitely a new direction for them. stoked to have shared this bottle with my brother, who loves sours and wilds but until now has never had a beer from cantillon. we both really enjoyed it.","StonedTrippin","Aug 17, 2014"

4.39,0.9,3.75,4.75,4.25,4.25,4.5,"75 cl bottle poured into a tulip glass. A murky ruddy orange-amber hue with almost no head once everything settles out, just a speckling of white bubbles floating there. There is a neat effect where a sip leaves some lacing composed of tiny bubbles that evaporate almost instantly. Sublime aroma, decidedly funky and sour with assertive lime, lemon, horse blanket, aspirin, flower shop, root cellar, and white wine all vying for one's attention but with nothing sticking out in an unpleasant fashion. Palate is similarly complex yet dominated by dry and sour hop and wild yeast elements with pretty minimal sweetness aside from a faint tinge of caramel, discernible in the finish if you concentrate. I get apple cider vinegar, lemon and lime peel/rind, baby aspirin, champagne, tannic grape skins, horse blanket or dry canvas sheet (seems like an apt descriptor, sorry!), and a general forest floor earthiness from start to finish. Supremely tasty sour and more pungent than some other common examples I've tried from Petrus and Rodenbach. No sugar in this sucker. The label is careful to state that this is not a lambic, which is interesting, probably on the basis of the lack of wheat and hopping regime. Very low carbonation but not flat, airy light body and a massively sour finish that manages to hit woody, hard candy, and hay elements before descending into a super-tannic green apple and white wine vinegar finale. What a beer. For some reason my ratings seem high but shall stand. I agree with Jeff Sparrow in "Wild Brews", this bridges the gap between lambic and American sours nicely.","CalgaryFMC","Jun 25, 2014"

Very sour and tart aroma, but thankfully the beer isn't as sour/tart/unbalanced as the somewhat wineline aroma. There is some funky spice and there's a touch of sweetness and oakiness that balances the sour, tart flavors of mostly cherry and touch of grape. Not a big red wine drinker but this reminded me of some light reds (no heavy merlots or cabs). Wish I could describe it better but it is a must try and enjoyable sipper.","clayrock81","Sep 15, 2013"

A good dose of acidic sourness that's balanced really well with the hoppy bitterness this one provides. Even though my overall score might not suggest it, this one is well worth the effort.

Not sure what year this bottle was--I think it was 2011 or 2012--and it had some of that gnarly sediment on top of the cork. Hazy orange-yellow pour, effervescent, with a small, fizzy, white head; moderate retention and a bit of lacing. Aroma had a funky sourness to it, wet grass, citric acid and floral notes, some woodiness. There was a rather subdued sourness up front in the taste, lemon pith and grass, horseblanket, notable (and somewhat unpleasant) hop bitterness, floral and somewhat vegetal notes, raw celery, bitter and a bit medicinal in the finish. Dry mouthfeel, light-medium to medium in body. It's decent, but not really my thing.","Rifugium","Jul 04, 2013"

The retention is pretty strong but the lacing is minimal. The smell of the beer is funky, it's slightly acidic and has a bit of oak on the nose too. The taste of the beer is tart at first, it settles down as you drink it and the sweetness comes through a little more. There is plenty of fruity acidic elements in the flavor with the malt balancing it out a little. The mouthfeel of the beer was much thicker than I expected, I was surprised by it's thickness. Good amount of carbonation as well making this beer come to life. Overall it's a pretty good brew, it had some surprising elements to it which made this really enjoyable.","Knapp85","Mar 07, 2013"

Poured a hazy yellow-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet mat, funk, sour, earth, floral, and pepper. The flavor was of sweet malt, floral, sour, tart, funk, fruit, spice, and pepper. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. Surprisingly I had never had this beer before grace my palate. I have quite a few set aside, but had no comparison about how it tasted fresh and how it will be aged. At least now I can answer the first part of that. I really enjoyed this one quite a bit. The pepper aspect was definitely a nice touch as it mixed really well with the funkiness going on here. Another solid offering from Cantillon.","thagr81us","Dec 31, 2012"

The taste reflects the aroma with some grassiness to balance out the acidity a little. Still pretty acidic and has a hint of bitterness. Fairly sour and a little drying in the mouth and throat (not unusual for a sour). Mouthfeel is pretty much perfect. The carbonation helps alleviate some of the excess acidity in the beer.","wd40","Dec 21, 2012"

I’ve got them on a lambic at home right now that I brewed and never having had this beer it was a must try so I had something to go by. It was much darker burnt orange than any of the other Cantillon offerings I had had the day of the tasting. Lots of floral notes in the nose, my guess would be from the late hop additions this beer receives. Had a really nice sweet, green apple tartness to it. This beer also had a more pronounced maltiness. I also noticed this beer had a much heavier mouth feel than the other traditional lambics that were tried. Overall I like to taste the difference of this beer with the different grain bill and hop additions against the traditional lambics.","cps98","Dec 10, 2012"

My only (slight) complaint is that the hops are too subtle and attenuated - was hoping for more in the aroma. When I had this on tap in Brussels it seemed hoppier, but perhaps the time that has passed has allowed the hop notes to fade. I suspect this is a beer best consumed young. Anyway, another quality offering from Cantillon and well worth your time. Grab one if you come across it.","jazzyjeff13","Nov 17, 2012"

Poured at good temperature with huge, fluffy, thick, cream-colored head that settled after a bit and some lace. Color is a clear amber with a single lazy bubble trail. Aroma is tart sweet with a barest hint of hop. Flavor's like nose and again hop is in the background, more bitter. Body is a little soft as a result of low carbonation. Does have a few high point from the bitter/yeast combination, but it's not offensive. Finish is like flavor and relatively long.","drpimento","Jul 18, 2012"

Scent is very funky (it's Cantillon, what did you expect?). Floral hoppiness with some sweet stone fruits and green apple. A bit of grass along with intense sour aroma. Taste is very tart at first. Very sour in the middle, with a surprisingly bitter/hoppy finish. The most hoppy Cantillon I have ever had, but work really well as it remains extremely funky and sour. Slightly earthy and grassy. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, somewhat fizzy, and highly carbonated. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is another great Cantillon. They never let down.","DovaliHops","Jul 16, 2012"

3.65,-16.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5," The dry sharp flavor with lots of acidity is in the taste right off the bat with hops and oak that give a mild cedar like aromatic wood element w/ mellow bark and almost grapefruit like sour fruit in the tertiary. The woody and citrus combo is intense with both sour and bitter blending to give a bitter herbal and lemon rind taste which also has a gentle oak accent. The hops seem to come out more toward the finish as the woody sour flavors are all over the entry to middle taste. The taste is so puckering w/ light bitter leafy edge it seems at times like a juxtaposition and others like a wierd tug of war. The drinkability is not that high for me, it is interesting and intense, but overall seems like an assault on the palate without any where to retreat, this stirs the acid in the stomach and is a bit overwhelming mixed with other lambics enjoyed, it just comes off too sharp ...it would be difficult to have multiple samples in my opinion.","Slatetank","Nov 19, 2011"

It appears that it may be slightly oxidized. The aromas consist of perfume like qualities, floral acid, and moderate vinegar. It tastes quite acidic and has a particular spiced bite to it. It does have some floral and tea components as well. It's interesting to say the least. It drinks light in body and dries out your palate, yet not as much as other Cantillons. Overall it's an interesting beer and worth a try. I'm curious to know why they named the beer Iris.","aasher","Nov 04, 2011"

Punchy lemon flavor blended with a dusty straw taste. Iris has an acidic and bitter finish, this is slightly off putting. I assume this comes from my buddies decision to age this beer.

Sour/tart up front with a decent balance of musty/earthy oak along with subtle pale malt, earthy, bitter hops and crisp light fruit. Very complex and well balanced with a nice amount of citrus and other sweet, vinous fruits balancing out the sour funk. In addition, the hops used make this beer very unique for the style. The dry and cold hopping results in a earthier, slightly more bitter lambic than usual, but not to the detriment of the other characteristics. There's still plenty of funk but this is slightly better balanced and easier to drink than some other Belgian sours. Recommended.","corby112","Jan 21, 2011"

Pours dark golden/copper with a nice level of carbonation and head. Micro bubble lacing that coats the glass.Nose- apricots, lemon, green apple, oak, but overall very fresh fruit forward. Taste- hops are definitely in the foreground- woody bitterness intertwine with the moderate acidity. Lack of wheat gives the malt more sweeter flavour to the malt. Finish is drying from the hops and cheesy.","oakbluff","Oct 03, 2010"

It is flavored slightly like apricot. Soon after, a good sour flavor kicks in. It isn't too puckering. Some yeast flavors linger. I find it very tasty. It has a medium body and low carbonation. As I said, very little puckering sensation--just enough to let you know its there. Not much coat, just what you would expect from this style. It's very drinkable. Not too sour and very refreshing.

4.28,-1.6,4,3.5,5,4,4,"Iris pours what initially appeared to be a murky dark orange/brown, but proper lgihting revealed it's true nature, a relatively clear and radiant orange. A most impressive three finger creamy bone cap forms, and head retention is excellent. Lacing is nonexistent, but this doesn't come as a huge surprise. The nose is enticing, but fairly one dimensional. It's pure, unadulterated musty barnyard funk, the same classic smell associated with many wild ales. It's not bad, but I was hoping for a bit more, and I hope the beer is a little more exciting than this. After even the first sip any fears were assuaged. A brief splash of malt and oak segues beautifully into a wave of tartness. It's half sour apple and half citrus, like a sour apple blow pop dipped in a little bit of citric acid (and I mean this in a good way). The earthy barnyard funk that so dominated the nose finds its place here on the back end, closing each sip and lingering just long enough. Body is on the thin side, as one usually finds with a beer fermented with such voracious yeast, but it coats my tongue with each sip. I do find myself wishing the carbonation was a bit more lively and expressive though. I find that any true sour or wild beer can't be rushed and must be savored, and the same is true here. Aroma and mouthfeel are minor chinks in Iris's armor, but I'm happy to overlook those when faced with a beer that tastes as fantastic as this one does.","axeman9182","Sep 12, 2010"

Pours a very lovely amber orange color with a large white head that fell slowly leaving whispy rings of lacing. Aroma is nice and tart, semi-sweet, doses of lemon and light funk. Taste is acidic but not overly tart, and funkiness/cheese factors are kept to a minimum. Splashes of lemon rind, a bit of leather, and a gentle herbal hoppiness that's not bitter but certainly present. This really is a great beer. I was expecting this to be super sour and tart considering it's unblended and age 3 years, but the acid is very pleasing and complimentary to the bready, darker malts. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin and there's virtually no carbonation. I would almost believe this is close to flat if I didn't see small, wandering carbonation bubbles in the tulip glass. Good drinkability considering it's a sour beer.

Lots of layers here, with faint soapy hops in the finish. Looking forward to comparing this to a Cantillon that is not dry-hopped, don't think I'll miss the hops too much as they're almost like an afterthought in this beer.

Flavor is bitter citrus evoking primarily grapefruit, with little cloves on the finish, and a huge astringent/tannic aftertaste that builds and peaks at 5 seconds. Really adds to the feeling of biting grapefruit and is not entirely appealing (from maybe a few too many days in the barrel). The bitterness is tempered as the beer warms toward room temperature.

Tart lemon flavours contribute the bulk of the sourness, and leave a clean feeling in the mouth, not unlike a dry white wine. Funky horseblanket and hay notes add further layers of complexity.

Vinegar and lemongrass midway with a hint of unripe cherries. Aftertaste is pretty earthy and dry with leather and dust flavors on the tongue. Light and dry body with a big puckering mouthfeel. Pretty strong carbonation but it fits very well with the style. The abv is pretty low, but the crazy tartness is a bit much for my tastebuds. Not bad, but the price tag is a bit of a turnoff.","BeerTruth","Dec 12, 2008"
3.78,-13.1,4,3.5,4,3,4,"2005 vintage. This is the first unblended lambic I've tried. Pours hazy orange-gold with a bubbly white head that quickly disappears. Musty aroma of yeast, lemon, apple, spice, and old wood. Taste is fruity, citrus sweet up front, but instantly turns into a dank acidic sourness with an apple wine/vinegar bite. As it warmed the sourness lightened up just a bit. Dry, sweet finish akin to a Flemish.","magictrokini","Dec 05, 2008"

Bitter, sour, flower petal bitterness, perfumey, just not at all good.

Sour, ascerbic aroma of brandied pears, olives and some green grapes. Also a little parmesan cheese and some cask aroma. Sour dry flavor of olives, oak and more cheese, all very funky. I dont have much experience with true Lambics, so I never know what to expect or garner from the situation, but even since my run in with NG Sour Brown, Im more interested in wild fermented beers. This is wildly funky beer. In a way, I feel like Im drinking green olive juice. Very much pimento in this beer. Theres a nice subtle, floral sweetness in the background thats lifting and airy, and really brings a lot to the table. This is much more quaffable than my previous experiences with past lambics. Palate is some how dry at first, then finishes sweet and supple. A softness and smoothness to this beer. My bottle keeps gushing. Interesting and woody, a lot of tooth and chewiness. Enjoyable.

4.47,2.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Ahhh. It's not my everday beer by any means, but when I get the itch there's nothing like a super fresh super sour funky lambic from Cantillon. Had this one on tap at Sunset. Appears a golden color, with little to no head, and great clarity and shinyness. The best thing about a world class beer like this is the freshness. Everything about it screams fresh and wild. The scents coming off this one are like apple and pear skins, a hayfield, and a slight grassy and herbal hop quality. Taste, as expected, is quite sour, but not unpleasantly so. Complex, musty, funk after taste supports the ripe fruityness and sourness. I don't know if it's just the power of suggestion, but this beer has a really nice hop quality to it that makes it particularly unique. Once again, tastes how a big wild field smells in the fall. Excellent slick yet super dry mouthfeel. An incredibly natural and hedonistic beer.","twelvsies","Oct 21, 2005"
4.5,3.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"From Notes: Tap version sampled at Redbones on a dinner stop home from Maine. Dark slightly hazy orange/sunflower with a nice small but tightly packed head of white/off white foam. Aromas of barnyard funk, and wild yeasts abound, with a nice actual malt base, and some real heavy handed hoping (for a Cantillon) making this one quite unique and different, for a brewery that prides itself on being unique and different. Taste is sharp and funky, sour, with all of the gueuze qualities we know and love. The hops add a slightly citric sharpness to the finish of this one, which is as dry as ever. Mouthfeel is refreshing and bubbly, making this brew totally drinkable. Another great brew from these master lambic makers...","francisweizen","Sep 13, 2005"
4.03,-7.4,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"750ml bottle with "2000" on the cork. The cork bursts out of the bottleneck and several ounces worth of foam goes rushing onto the countertop. I struggle to get the bottle under control. People are already complaining about the smell. I guess that's a good sign. Poured into a champagne flute, the beer is about the same color as raw honey or the light maple tabletop on which it is standing. A single thin, vigorous line of carbonation runs through the liquid, connecting to the bottom of a gruesomely pock-marked, 1/4" deep head that's the color of dirty dishwater. No cling or lacing. The smell isn't quite as offensive as I had hoped. It remindes me most of malt vinegar, the acidity being more acetic than uric. There are residual odors of cork and yeast. Tastes like sour dirt, and how. Sour enough that I'm wincing after each sip. Horrifying copper sourness rots through a layer of apple skins into a field of dead cabbages and finishes with leather and must. At first, the acids have my tongue trying to turn itself inside out, but the mouthfeel evolves to become refreshing and vibrant. Drinking it begets its own drinkability. Intense, intense stuff; and so complex it'll probably take me a few weeks to figure out if I actually liked it.","NearerMyBeerToMe","Sep 11, 2005"

This beer poured a hazy amber color with a healthy 3 finger head that fell to coat the beer generously. Upon smelling it, I was taken back, even thought I had this beer once before. Sour and fruity notes hit me first, followed with tart and acidic barnyard funkyness kicking me in the face directly afterwards. Wow. The flavor is something that has to be experienced to understand. Immediate sourness and acidic flavors assaulted my tongue. This was as close to making me pucker as a beer can without making me actually do it. Damn, this beer is fine. The feel was moderate with a slight carbonation to keep it lively on the tongue. The flavors and aroma on this one is so far beyond the norm, that it can be nothing but greatness.

3.62,-16.8,4,4.5,4,3,2,"Lambics are an enigma to meso much wildness and unrestrained flavors. This beer was no exception. Ive been sitting on a bottle (cork says its from 2001), and finally gave it a try. Its a truly unique brew. The cork, which was quite damp through half of its volume, was extruded with a loud Pop. The brew is a hazy orange with a billowing white head. Aroma is a mix of deep, woody oak and musty manure. Theres plenty of lemony, vinegar-like acidity going on in the smell as well. Its a totally un-hinged, wild aroma. The taste is solidly acidicit crosses the line from tart to downright mouth-puckering sour. No malt is detectable through the acidity, though there is a notable oak character and bitter hop finish. The oak is not unlike that of a decent Chardonnay. Unfortunately, the sourness made the beer very difficult for me to drink. Maybe it would be a wonderful aperitif, but in anything other than small quantities, its a rough-sell. Extraordinarily interesting, and completely wild","Suds","Nov 06, 2004"
4.32,-0.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Wow, I've got a young one here, picked up at "From the Vine" in Columbus. Cork is dated 2004. Cork came out with no gushing. Pours a light orange with a minimal white head that retreats to just the sides of the glass fairly quickly. Nose is not as assertive as previous Cantillon's that I have had. A sharp fruity/citrusy aroma is well guarded by notes of cork. A slight musty smell creeps up at the end, but it remains in the background. Taste is very citric. Large hints of grapefruit are present. Finish is very tart and cutting. Musty flavors are only found in the middle as the finish reminds me a little of lime concentrate, pretty acidic as well. Very unique. I'd like to try this after cellaring for a few years. Out of all the Cantillon's I've had, this is easily the most accessible. A quality beer for sure, but if I had to choose one brand it would be their Gueuze.","soper2000","Nov 01, 2004"

Rich barnyard funk with a bit of honey, oak barrel and pale malts in the aroma. Initially tart, but a honeyed sweetness does shine through, sometimes reminiscent of sour apricot or peach. Ooh, there's some hops in there, too, they interact with the tartness very nicely. Oak barrel aging is evident in the taste, as well. Delicate carbonation is good for this ale.

4.53,4.1,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Cantillon Iris was served from a corked (2001), capped, and foiled 750ml bottle. In a chalice, this beautiful beer was a brilliant and shiny copper color, and was topped by an everlasting, fine, and creamy off-white head that left sheets of luxurious lacing wherever it touched. The carbonation was varied and fascinating, consisting of slower small streamers, and large speeding bubbles that would hit the surface with such force they could be seen making bumps in the head from above. The nose presented an aggressive sourness with a soft musty grapefruit component followed by herbal juniper berry and powdery floral perfumy notes. On the palate, an up-front oaky dry sourness with an assertive raw lemon accent explodes then gains a tannic bitterness before slowly dropping off, leaving lingering herbal/grassy earthen lemony aftertastes. The body is very smooth, slick, and richly full, serving to counter and balance the dry oaken sourness. The vigorous carbonation matched well with the flavors and character of this lambic. I found this beautiful all-malt lambic to be wonderfully aromatic, robustly flavorful, and a pleasure to drink.","HiroProtagonist","May 05, 2004"

It paired wonderfully with the aged sharp cheddar, prosciutto, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and rustic bread. Cantillon definitely delivered once more with this beer. This is a world class beer, whose only flaw, given the specialty designation on this beer, is that perhaps it is not quite distinctive enough from a traditional Lambic, but how can I really complain since I do love Lambic.","Gueuzedude","Feb 02, 2004"

This has a steady waft of the funky horse blanket - barnyard thing, without the canned tuna and arrogance that the Vigneronna has. Otherwise its nearly the same with citrusy notes of grapefruit, lime, and lemon, floral deepness with the roots and all, earthy and highly sweet. Taste is quick and tart with citrus rinds of all kinds, moslty lime and grapefruit, dry and sour puckering sweet with nice floral notes creeping in. Lots of layers to the souring tartness, musk, fresh flowers, grasses, sour candies, citric acidicness, dirt, sour, sour, sour. Whew, its packed. Full on tartness, sourness, and sweetness. Its actually not bad, it takes a few sips to get used to, but as you snap your senses around it and it warms, its pretty good. Still though, its a big time sipper with all that tongue drying, cheek puckering, lip tingling sour tartness.","tavernjef","Jan 18, 2004"

Again with the barnyard/horse aroma that could be off-putting to some, I'm just always pleasantly surprised when the beer doesn't taste like it smells. A dry crisp fruityness when tasted. The carbonation is not overwhelming. While not overwhelmingly tart, I can see that this would not be as much as a session beer as others.

4,-8,4,4,4,4,4,"Once the crown cap was removed the cork moved a quarter inch above the bottle lip on its own. This beer wants to be consumed. I was amazed at the loud pop produced when the cork was removed. 3 years in oak and its still so lively?! The beer poured with a lot more head than I expected and smelled almost like vinegar. I have to stop now and admit that this is the first true lambic I have tried, so the smell worried me a bit. Iris has a nice reddish-tan cloudy appearence. It is a color I find somehow comforting. Its first taste was not as sour as I had assumed by smell, but still very tart. It finished sharply bitter. Once the initial sour shock has passed it smells of apples and grapes. I will agree with past reviewers on the "grassy" aftertaste. I am surprised that oak is not discernible. Iris has a nice light mouthfeel - I would have liked to try this in the dead of summer. After reading the love them or hate them comments about true lambics, I am very happy to say that this beer is quite refreshing and I look forward to trying other examples of the style.

A little of that funky barnyard stuff going on. It's almost like sucking on one of those sour gobstoppers. Interesting to say the least. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated. Maybe medium body at best.
