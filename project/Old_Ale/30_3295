4.06,5.5,4,4.25,4,4,4,"Poured a deep clear reddish brown body with a thin cap of head. Overall impression of appearance is true to style, quite nice. Scents of rich, sweet malt with notes of caramel, molasses, toffee, raisin and fruitcake in the foreground, supported by aromas of nutty malt, hazelnuts and coffee in the background with a mild warm alcohol also present. Overall impression of aroma is of a true to form, very complex example of an Old Ale. Malty, rich and warming. Very well done. Flavor begins malty sweet with notes of hazelnut, caramel and molasses upfront with medium-low levels of vinous and sweet fruity esters and a light roasted malt and chocolate presence. Middle continues these flavors, picking up more pronounced notes of raisins and hazelnuts, alongside a slight warming alcohol. Finish is sweet with notes of raisins, vinous flavors, caramel, molasses, light nuttiness and medium-light bitterness from roasted malt contributing flavors of coffee and chocolate and a light warming alcohol. Aftertaste is lightly bitter and nutty with notes of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee and hazelnuts. Overall impression of flavor is of a nice Old Ale, one that fits well to style, with just a touch higher bitterness than is usual. Still a good example of the style and quite pleasant. Mouthfeel is full bodied and chewy, with low carbonation and a sticky feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a very true to style Old Ale. Overall this is a fantastic Old Ale. It has a pleasant aroma and a very nice flavor, aided by a pleasing mouthfeel. A very nice Winter ale, one of the better examples of the style.","Auraan","Feb 24, 2015"
