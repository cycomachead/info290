4.06,5.5,4,4.25,4,4,4,"Poured a deep clear reddish brown body with a thin cap of head. Overall impression of appearance is true to style, quite nice. Scents of rich, sweet malt with notes of caramel, molasses, toffee, raisin and fruitcake in the foreground, supported by aromas of nutty malt, hazelnuts and coffee in the background with a mild warm alcohol also present. Overall impression of aroma is of a true to form, very complex example of an Old Ale. Malty, rich and warming. Very well done. Flavor begins malty sweet with notes of hazelnut, caramel and molasses upfront with medium-low levels of vinous and sweet fruity esters and a light roasted malt and chocolate presence. Middle continues these flavors, picking up more pronounced notes of raisins and hazelnuts, alongside a slight warming alcohol. Finish is sweet with notes of raisins, vinous flavors, caramel, molasses, light nuttiness and medium-light bitterness from roasted malt contributing flavors of coffee and chocolate and a light warming alcohol. Aftertaste is lightly bitter and nutty with notes of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee and hazelnuts. Overall impression of flavor is of a nice Old Ale, one that fits well to style, with just a touch higher bitterness than is usual. Still a good example of the style and quite pleasant. Mouthfeel is full bodied and chewy, with low carbonation and a sticky feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a very true to style Old Ale. Overall this is a fantastic Old Ale. It has a pleasant aroma and a very nice flavor, aided by a pleasing mouthfeel. A very nice Winter ale, one of the better examples of the style.","Auraan","Mar 22, 2015"

In my opinion the nose was not off the chart but the real experience is when I began to sip it.  The beer poured very dark and looked appealing from the get go.  It had a good amount of carbonation and mouthfeel to make it enjoyable and lively.  The malts kept this beer at a enjoyable sweetness level without pushing it into a desert beer category.  I did not think the alcohol was "hot" and was masked by the beer.  The beer changed in a favorable way for me as the beer warmed.  The bitterness was very mild.  Normally I am disappointed by some seasonable/holiday brews but what started as a single bottle turned into a trip for a six pack for me.  Very well done!","VTR","Dec 17, 2014"

Maybe I'm just expecting too much out of the style/my palate is spoiled by so many good RIS's...... It just needed to have a bit more punch for me. If it were a bit cheaper I think I'd be a little less critical but I've mostly seen all Avery beer checking in at around $10-11 a six.

Subtle, but nice, nose of dark fruit (plums, figs) over a biscuit like sweet base with strong caramel notes.  Almost medium body with a slickness that becomes more pronounced as it warms.  Above average carbonation with some effervescence in the middle and finish.  The flavor profile is intense, very complex and well balanced until the finish. It begins with a smooth blend of flavors that tend to cascade to the forefront.  Sweet biscuit and caramel begin, then yield to the dark fruit over a very mild toffee note.  The middle is mildly bitter with a citric rind like note that fades into bitter dark chocolate. The long finish is where the alcohol comes to the forefront, but is somewhat masked by a residual sweetness.  A grain alcohol like aftertaste lingers.","tillmac62","Nov 11, 2014"

Had it on a cold night with a buffalo burger and it paired very nicely.  8.3% is a little high for the alcohol content, but Avery seems to like that sort of thing, so I went with it.  Nice and dark and roasty, not at all bitter despite the 45 IBUs, but not overly sweetened by the malts.  Definitely a fan of this one, and it's among Avery's best beers.","dcscientist","Oct 28, 2014"

Served in a DFH Signature glass, the beer pours a murky brown color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. Aroma is nice and malty, the brew smells like caramel, toffee, nuts, and some chocolate. I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some dark fruit, brown sugar and dark bread flavors noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and smooth with moderate carbonation. I liked this, it's good on a summer day and would probably be good on a winter's day too!","bluejacket74","Jul 03, 2014"

Aromas of big caramel, raisin, plum, brown sugar, toast, biscuit, brown bread, pepper, herbal, floral, light chocolate, light roast, and herbal earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, biscuit, raisin, plum, brown sugar, brown bread, pepper, herbal, floral, light chocolate, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, brown bread, brown sugar, raisin, plum, pepper, herbal, floral, light chocolate, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and earthy/spicy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly slick, bready, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice old ale style. Good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and herbal/spicy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on.

To attempt to get notes further than that is an effort in futility. The taste also hints at complexity that never quite makes it's way out behind the thick wall of lightly roasted malt and fruit. A very light booziness and a light amount of citrusy hops adds a bit of life to the beer. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium, and the drinkability is very good. Overall, Old Jubilation is a good beer. It's best aspect is probably it's drinkability, this goes down very easily for the relatively high ABV and strong malt flavors.","shand","Jan 09, 2013"

Aroma of milky bar chocolate and some caramel, some nuts,,hazelnuts, Smooth taste of coffee and cream, hazelnuts,white chocolate,figs and some whisky fudge. Mouthfeel is pretty nice, gives the impression of fullness but its actually very drinkable I liked it but again its not as good as i wanted it t be.

The taste is rich of toffee and even some slight chocolate notes with some nice alcohol warmth in the finish. I could see drinking this on a cold night around the holidays. Overall it's a decent brew, i enjoyed it, but curious to see what some cellaring time will do for it.","AngusOg","Jun 28, 2011"
4.05,5.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,"The color of this holiday brew is a semi-transparent dark brown with a fair tan head and good lacing. And placing a finger aside of my nose, I detect a mild evergreen aroma over a stout-like charcoal malt. There’s a near cherry spritz to it. Pretty decent. The palate finds deep licorice malt and more evergreen. It blends nicely with a unique herbal sweetness. This may not be everyone’s favorite but I’m liking it. It’s medium to full bodied with very subtle but effective carbonation, resulting in a heavy, near chewy feel. This is pretty impressive. Not a session beer but it goes down readily considering the style and ABV of 8.3. Very enjoyable and recommended for your holiday pleasure, or a cool June night like tonight.","Durge","Jun 06, 2011"

The taste however let me down so very much. The flavors are of burnt biscuit and coffee, with an odd aftertaste that really messes with you. The hoppy bitterness doesn't really help the beer, in fact I would say that it hinders it. However, amongst all of this it is a palatable solid brew that I would still consider good.

The nose comprises roasted malts, light fennel, brown sugar, light maple syrup, and walnuts. The taste holds notes of brown sugar, light roasted malts, walnuts, and light maple syrup. There's a decidedly watered-down kind of feeling to everything. The body is a straight medium, with a light carbonation and a kinda watery feel.

Not a ton of punch to the nose, but the flavors are pretty interesting. Dry malt profile with a fair dose of burnt character and toasted wood, perhaps a little smoke. Bitterness aplenty, flirting with astringency. Hop flavors are quite earthy. As it warms, it gains sweetness that seems to be lacking a partner in crime.

I get a tiny note of cocoa in the nose too. I wish this one was stronger, would be awesome blend if it was. Taste is pretty cool. Get some nice malts, roasty ones, a decent hop profile, cherries, cocoa. There is a bit of a dry alcohol taste that really keeps this one from shining.

This example is a bit more hoppy than many of the winter warmers I've had since and is a very big beer. With that being said I'm a fan. You definitely taste every bit of the 8.0% alcohol but its balanced out by some beautiful toffee and caramel notes with just the right amount of spice present in the background.

Sweet nose of mocha, malts, anise seed, chestnuts and cherry, plum fruit scents, there is an odd pepperiness to it as well, not sure why it's there, turns a bit herbaceous just before it dissipates, overall clings to your nostrils well and lingers for some time. In the mouth it's medium-bodied with a dense, muscular feel, the carbonation is tight and kind of explosive, not the creamy or soft sort of fizz. Even with palpable caramel, malt, chocolate elements not that sweet, restraint found in the currant, cherry, plum flavors. Hint of clove spice and cola.

Hazelnut is right there, with caramel, toffee, roasted malts, toast, dates, and just a bit of vanilla. This is really a great tasting beer. I don't know if its the fact its been sitting for close to 6 months now and has really come together or it is that great. I think I'll have to re review when it comes out again in November.

Taste is rather odd and a complete let down from the smell. first is a rather cloying sweetness of brown sugar and then comes a piney hops. Some winter spice is a bit abrasive on the tongue too.

First taste is real nice with a touch of spice and caramel, backgrounds of biscuit and nuts are there. The hops give a different candy like taste. Feel is undercarbonated to me, but that is a minor part of a nice coating feel. this is a very easily drinkable brew, and I really feel this Winter Warmer has the character of an English Barleywine.","mnstorm99","Feb 12, 2009"

Nicely balanced flavour, still a lot of malt character but with mild bitterness and fruity notes. Faint mint in the finish along with subdued alcohol and lingering chocolate/toffee malts.

3.73,-3.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear ruby red color with a sticky egg shell colored head that left some lacing. The aroma is of sweet red grapes, candied cherries, a bready honey malt, and a hint of hops. The taste is big on bitter resiny hops which is supported by a sweet bready malt. The dark fruit flavors (grape and cherry) serve as subtle notes towards the end. The feel is thick and chewy, borders on being slick from the ABV, fairly soft carbonation, finishes sweet. The drinkability is fine, again a bit thick and boozy. Good if you are only looking to drink one.","Gmann","Jan 14, 2009"

Still, I like it quite a lot.","BretSikkink","Jan 09, 2009"
3.43,-10.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Poured a dark brown with a nice tan head. When held up to light, it was dark ruby red. It looked like the red light district in amsterdam at around 3AM, pretty cool. Smelled sweet and malty, some hints of christmas flair-type spicing around the borders of my smell capabilities. The taste was very malt forward, with hoppy bitterness on the finish. Thick and gooey, the flavor got more interesting as the beer warmed. You defintely knew the alcohol was there the entire time, but it wasn't too overbearing. I am not a fan of the majority of christmas beers out there and this didn't break from that trend. Better then most holiday brews though and on a cold winter night, I could see sipping on one of these for an hour or so.","SwiftyMcBeer","Jan 09, 2009"
3.62,-6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Taste is of cocoa powder, sweet caramel, and raisins. There is a touch of bitter hops in the background. Finish is very dry and slightly acidic. I would prefer a more viscous mouthfeel. Not bad for the cold winter months, Not great though.","hckyfn9999","Jan 08, 2009"
3.75,-2.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"First impressions: rich, slightly burnt malts, with winter spicing taking a back seat at first, yet after the beer goes down it's the spices and hops that linger on the palate, the hop bitterness stays for a bit. Yes, there's a nice hop presence for balance, nothing to extreme, but good to see considering a lot of winter warmers don't seem to care about hops. That's one thing I notice, the other thing is that it seems a lot fuller than other winter warmers. It's not thin at all, a nice rounded-out medium bodied beer. The carbonation helps promote a nice slick mouthfeel, slides right down the palate. The only thing I have against it is that while some hops are nice for balance, this one seems a little too hopped by my tastes, and for me, that takes away a bit from the drinkability. Keep in mind though, I love malt bombs and am less big on IPAs, so a lot of you folks will probably appreciate that quality more than I. I have to say, I didn't notice it was 8% ABV until I was halfway through the pint and looked at the top of the review page. The alcohol hotness doesn't really stands out, but blends with the bitterness a bit. Still, one of the better winter warmers out there it seems, and while not spectacular, not a bad brew during the long cold months.","damienblack","Jan 07, 2009"
4.28,11.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"A clean dark brown beer. Has a nice creamy beige head and leaves good lace. The aroma has a nice sweet spice character. With a sweet toffee note and a good backbone of spice. As it warms notes of cinnamon, allspice and clove wander through the aroma. As the beer hits your mouth it is filled with flavor. Sweet toffee, spices, coffee and tobacco all run all over your tongue. Then there is a nice dry hop bitterness on the finish. This is a great winter treat.","ybnorml","Jan 04, 2009"

3.68,-4.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"A nice Winter Warmer that fits the style well but doesn't particularly excel in any category. Old Jubilation has a nice appearance, deep brown liquid with a good beige head. The aroma is predominantly light malt with a metallic tinge. It's not bad but a bit weak. The taste is somewhat boring caramel malt with good spicing and a lightly bitter finish. The spices are particularly well done with clove and cinnamon dominant and never take on the annoying artificial character of so many other beers in the style. Unfortunately, Old Jubilation just fades into the background of my winter warmer memories. It's well done but a bit boring. I would recommend it to fans of the style or those looking for a simple entry point to winter warmers (of course, the latter seems like a bizarre audience that I just invented).","popery","Dec 31, 2008"

For 8% it isn't harsh by any means and goes down easy, but I find it lacking in taste and aroma.

Alcohol has a definite, biting presence and sticks in the mouth for the short, bitter finish. Medium and light carbonation mouthfeel with large alcohol presence.

Flavors of whole grain bread mingled with a hop bite and metallic undertones; some nice, sharp, fruity hop layers occupy the taste buds for the majority of the taste. The alcohol is late in coming and doesnt taste as strong as it really is, noticeable only after a few sips as it begins to warm the insides.

Smells wonderfull, but very unlike a typical warmer -- more like a double. Plum, fig, cherry ride over a chocolate-caramel malt with none of the spiciness that I associate with winter beers. A delectable dessert. Tastes much the same, but less pleasurable for whatever reason. Like some malty fruitcake, it's got a creamy mouthfeel and a suprisingly dry finish. It masks the 8% very well, just the warmth makes it through, not the fire. It is more drinkable than most dubbels, actually, but compared to other warmers, I think it's too sweet to drink more than one unless you've got a real craving.

Very rich, amazing feel on the palate. I just got some old school bubblegum, you know the rock hard sticks of bubblegum that came in Topps baseball card packs in the late 80s?

It does mellow out a bit as the beer warms to room temperature, and reveals some fruitier tones. The taste is quite good. Rich malt flavor with notes of caramel, plum, and coffee. Possesses a nice hoppy balance, even the hops are not terribly prominent. Very nice beer, here. Mouthfeel is sturdy, but a bit thinner than I might expect from a warmer.

First whiffs are faint and of rasin-studded poundcake; then a huskier grain mash aroma settles in, providing chocolate and slightly overripe apple notes. There's a surprising vinous quality to the flavor, with black cherries, plum juice, and a slight cinnamon bitterness at the back. A noticeable alcoholic sharpness finishes the swallow, all angular-like, leaving a woody-earthy-vegetal kiwi fruit dryness in the aftertaste. Substantial abv (8%) lends a decidedly slick quality to the mouthfeel. A very slight peppery sensation as it goes down. This is a fine brew, but it leaves me somewhat puzzled and unmoved. I'm really going out of my way this year to try as many winter seasonals as I can, and I must say I still am having trouble getting my head around what "Winter Warmer" means stylistically speaking.

3.73,-3.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a mysteriously dark brown, almost black, that only gives off highlights when held up to direct light. Sticky Brussels lace gets left behind in spite of a head that starts out fluffy and ends up sparse. The aroma has very prominent hops, metallic and cirtusy with a minimal malt payload that shows up mostly as a graham crackery smell. On the palate, the first thing to come out are sweet malts that remind me of sweetened citrus fruits. After that, the hop bitterness arrives, tickling the sides of the tongue. The finish is long and actively bitter, with plenty of action on the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel is prominently harsh with hop oils and relatively unbalanced by malts, especially for a beer of this style. Overall, this is a hop-head's winter warmer, with little in the way of malt feel and balance, but it is nonetheless pretty tasty.","geexploitation","Nov 11, 2006"

The date really comes across strongly. Spice is milder than I expected. The finish has a lingering bitterness. Hard to characterize. The spice does not meld well with the citrus hops.

As far as I can tell, the aroma does not offer a great amount... a hint of hops, and some dryness, but fairly subdued. The flavor on the otherhand is a veritible explosion of goodness. the best way to describe this I think is a heavily roasted, slightly spiced porter. The roasted malt flavor is phenomenal, and finishes out the palate without being overly dry. A very light amount of spice can be detected, but very mild, coriander, and perhaps cardamom. Finishes dry, with a slight bite that lingers for a few minutes. One of Avery's better 12 oz. beers I think, and it does quite a nice job of hiding it's 8% alcohol too.","phisig137","Feb 02, 2006"

Sweet chocolate tastes are most notable, with a touch of dark, bitter chocolate in the mix.

The head bubbled to two fingers, decent for a slow pour, a foamy tan that laced well. Smell was nutty and malty-sweet, with some cocoa and plum. Taste was excellent, deep and rich, with hazlenut, cocoa, dark fruit and black tea, with a just-right hoppy finish.

Good roasted malt taste mixed with coffee, chocolate and a hop as well as roasted bitterness. Slightly alcoholic and warming. Raisin and plum flavors noted. Higher than normal carbonation. A good complex brew but a bit harsh still. I think I will let the other 5 sit for a bit and try one again when it gets closer to Christmas - it should smooth out some.","sabrills70","Oct 29, 2005"
3.93,2.1,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"One of the latest effects of the change in the ABV limit law in Georgia in 2004 is the major increase in availability of good domestic micro brewed beers, one of which I poured in my oversized wine glass tonight. Avery Old Jubilation came is a longneck brown bottle with a wintry scene on the label. The poured beer looked clear, chestnut brown, with a tinge of red. The head was dark beige, and formed quite nicely to a one finger thick foamy consistency before fading away to a covering of bubbles. The aroma was accentuating the malts in a big way with a sweet, musty, roasty smell. The hops were there as well, but provided more of a floral background smell. The taste was much more of a balance between hops and malt, with a stronger than anticipated leafy bitterness reminiscent of tobacco juice. The malt was a mix of brown sugar, toffee, chocolate, nuts, peat smoke, and dates. The mouthfeel was silky smooth and rich with a sticky quality to it. The aftertaste was like a lingering peat flavored candy. The alcohol content was well hidden behind the subterfuge of all this complex layering, with no noticeable burn. A good seasonal offering from the Colorado brewery who can do big beer right most of the time, and this is one of those times.","rajendra82","Oct 28, 2005"

The flavor is initially quite hoppy like their IPA (citrus, floral and some pine) followed by a spiced character (nutmeg and allspice), some chocolate, toasted bread and some warming alcohol notes. The mouthfeel is a little thin, but smooth and the drinkability is pretty good.

Aroma was sweet molasses, caramel, plums, and other dark fruits with a nice dose of grapefruit hops coming through, an indication of what is to come. Taste has a nice sweet complexity upfront, with hints of figs, prunes, roasted malt, nuts, and toffee followed by a big dose of piney resinous hops and a slight alcohol taste on the finish. This is a lot more hopped than most Winter Warmers I've had, and in this case it really turns out well, since the balance is right on. Medium bodied and very drinkable for it's alcohol level.

It is one that keeps well, so that's why I am reviewing a winter seasonal near the first of August. This beer is big and bold with a whole bunch of flavor. It is very close to a British Stock Ale in flavor and strength, though with a bit much hops for both styles.

Underneath this wall of citrus there is some maltarome mostly chocolate/roast and some caramellic notes. Impressive and wel dosed arome's with maybe litle overdone dryhopping but alltogether a wonderfull adchiefment. Tasting this is also something, roasted nuts in orangejuice with wodka is a way to discripe this warming, fresh & fruity and bitter barleybrew. Woww maybe litle to much for time and wheather( sunny and round 85-90 outside at 1:30 pm) but most welcome to my tasting buds!

I was thinking big malty sweet beer, and it is a bit sweet up front, but oh look out for them hops. The flavor kicks in midway through, and by the end you've got a big ball of chewy piney hops in your mouth. It's pretty bitter towards the end, but not overwhelmingly so. After a few sips my stomach is nice and warm. A tasty, interesting brew that redeemed itself after the pour.","HappyHourHero","May 30, 2005"

Nose is sweet, sweet, with fruity tones (grape?) as well as malt and molasses. The nose definitely lets you know there will be hops in the tasting that follows. Taste is sweet, dark fruits and malt. Hops prominent, moreso than I usually expect in a winter warmer, but not overpowering. Alcohol is evident throughout. Velvety mouthfeel, moderate carbonation.

3.84,-0.3,3,4,4,4,3.5,"Nice brown-amber color but the head was virtually non-existent. The aroma was dominated by sweet caramel and molasses along with some slight piney hops - rather nice, though perhaps a bit subdued. The flavor was definitely spicy overall - a nice blending of the sweet complex malt flavors suggested by the aroma along with maybe a hint of a roasted character, overlaid with spicy hops that finished with a slightly harsh character.

The nose is a sweet, malty sensation that lets the slightest breath of hops come through. The first taste reveals all sorts of flavors...chocolate, raisin, fig and apple come to mind. The "Jubilation" is evident as the alcohol makes itself known rather quickly. Definitely a sipper. The flavors become more pronounced as the beer warms.

At first the diacetyl was overwhelming, but after sitting for a bit, the smell improved. The taste is a very creamy smooth repeat of the aroma (although a better balance of the buttery flavor) along with a nice blend of hops taking a backseat to the malts. This smooth beer is a medium to heavy bodied beer that drinks down really well for the ABV. Very likeable beer! Thanks to pineywoodsrooter for this one! Cheers!","BeerAngel","Jan 21, 2005"

The head that was created was a light tan/beige color, creamy and bubbly in consistency, and it lasted fairly well considering it sat at the bar for a few moments before it made its way to me. The lace that was produced was fairly intricate and present all throughout the glass down to the last sip. The aromas that came forth were on the non-complex side, sweet malts, grains, dark fruits (raisons, prunes, plums), some earth notes as it warmed, hops and some alcohol notes. The flavors showed more complexity then the aromas, notes of chocolate malts (tad bitter), dark fruits (raisons, plums, prunes), which complimented the bitter chocolate, light hops (spice) tad on the alcohol and hops throughout. If finished on the slight bitter side (chocolate malts) with slight spice and on the dry side. Body was on the fuller side. Again one of those beers that become more complex as it warms.

There is also slight earthy hop notes appearing here and there as this one was put down. Taste mimics the aroma in most ways with the sweetness hitting you first and strongest with the same fruity and caramel malt flavors with an earthy hop tone keeping it from being overly sweet. As this one warms and you consume more subtle complexities start coming out with various spices and flavors coming forward. There is a slight bitterness to the finish and a pleasant lingering taste as well. Excellent mouthfeel here with every sip covering your mouth with a thick, rich and creamy taste.

Sweet bread like malts, medium somewhat chewy mouthfeel, sweet caramelized sugars, and light phenolic fruit. Tiniest hint at rum or brandy, but only behind the heavy sweetness.

The taste is so beautifully balanced with elegant hop flavors and a hearty malt backbone. It is sweet like a Mackesons stout and just as light and drinkable. Nice hints of roasted coffee/bittersweet chocolate. Good cold as it is when it warms. Got it at the stuffed sandwich in san Gabriel.","lou91","Jan 21, 2004"

This is what a strong/old ale is supposed to smell like....wonderful! The taste is malty and strong, but the alcohol is well integrated in this brew and the hops that hit hard on the finish round things out nicely. The mouthfeel is creamy and chewy and the drinkability is excellent as well. A great strong brew...","francisweizen","Jan 21, 2004"
3.35,-13,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Pours a deep, translucent red with a light creamy head. At first, the nose is full of robust malt aroma, progressing towards a sweeter, more herbal nose with noticeable alcohol as it warms. A number of flavors jump out of a thick, warming body: sweet malt, allspice, honey, and molasses. The bitter, malty finish lingers on the palate for quite a while. A good winter warmer, with emphasis on the warm. For >6% alcohol, it still packs a punch.","ElGordo","Jan 14, 2004"
3.72,-3.4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"A nice deep garnet color, and it is quite clear when held up to the light. It has a nice fruity, lightly spiced and hoppy aroma. This beer has a nice hop contribution, for some reason I was not expecting this, but it is good. The taste has some fruity - cherry notes as well as some light subtle spice character (as I understand it this is all done without the use of any real spices). The finish is slightly astringent, and is accompanied by a light sweetness. There is a bitter hop finish as well, though not IPA like but it is quite pleasing.","Gueuzedude","Jan 14, 2004"
4.03,4.7,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"The small, off-white head is filmy, leaving tiny little spots. Dark, dark, clear mahogany liquid. Nose is nutty with toffee (almost like peanut butter in burnt toffee). Dark chocolate toffee is joined by bold hops in the front. A thick chocolate malty middle finishes hoppy bitter. Yum! Aftertaste is just a little metallic, but only when cold. This one needs to warm up to show itself off. This is a very good, aggressive Christmas beer. Kind of like a maltier version of the New World Porter. I could drink lots of this!","kbub6f","Jan 12, 2004"
3.88,0.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Deep reddish-brown color with a decent off-white head that leaves a good lacing in my glass, fruity and malty aromas.

4.38,13.8,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A deep mahogany brew rests in my glass, topped with a creamy, sticky head of cream-color. The nose suggests Christmastime spices, but the website suggests that they used no spices whatsoever in the brewing of this ale, apart from, of course, our friends the hops. A woody and nutty aroma with hop crispness is present moreso than the aforementioned, however. It's very crisp on the tongue as well, but also deep and malty in a warming way. A well-placed hop bite at the beginning, balanced in the middle by thick grain and caramel malt with a nutty and woody character. Leafy at the back, leading to a crisp finish. Subtly creamy mouthfeel. A fine beer, perfect for a winter night with a book or other form of quiet enjoyment.","hyuga","Dec 21, 2003"
4.22,9.6,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Overall Impression: Very tasty. Big brew that hides it’s alcohol well, and tames a generous dose of hops.

4.1,6.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours out to a a dark amber in the glass with a very slight head. The aroma is somewhat fruity with some fresh malt thrown in. The taste is good, with a nice malty, slightly sweet mouthfeel giving way to a light, yet tasty hop dose on the finish. A very, very drinkable beer and one that masks the 8% ABV very well. This breweries offerings have been readily available in my area (Detroit) for awhile. I'll be exploring their other beers soon.","proc","Dec 15, 2003"
4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"A very well-rounded winter ale. Dark garnet red color and spicy aroma. Big malt, with faint pear essence and carbernet wine. Hops are well balanced against the malt, giving a beefy finish to the beer. The high abv is woven into the flavor and not at all prominent. Overall, a very "traditional" sort of strong ale, and a very nice seasonal offering.","Brent","Dec 10, 2003"

The hop floral aroma greets you first, followed by the fresh and slightly earthy malt sweetness; also a fine brandy like top also present in this magnificent nose, start is ambrosial, rich in malt, with the top middling to full in its feel. Finish is moderate in acidity, the hops forceful in their spicy presence, bittersweet aftertaste ends this great work of the brewers art, with each new beer I sample from this brewery, my admiration grows by leaps and bounds.","Gusler","Nov 30, 2003"
4.25,10.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"I like this one. At first, it was alittle bit too hoppy for me, but then the hoppiness "calmed" down. The color was a deep amber with a nice frothy creamy head. The head lasted a little bit and then went down to a thick laceing. The smell was quite malty, mixed with a beefy and fruity body. The taste was similar to the smell, but more on the semi-fruity side. Mouthfeel was creamy/bubbly and balanced out pretty well. All in all a good offering from Avery. The first brew from them that I have had, and most likely not the last.","JISurfer","Nov 29, 2003"

4.12,7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a very dark amber color with a light tan head that fades into a nice amount of lace. The nose is quite lovely and is the highlight of the beer with aromas of dark fruits and rum-soaked raisins and just a bit of molasses. Fairly full-bodied with a nice delicate level of carbonation. Taste begins with notes of plums and raisins with a touch of brown sugar followed by some unsweetened chocolate. A roasted nuttiness has a brief showing before some drying alcohol finishes the taste. Overall, the 8% ABV is well hidden and this makes for a fine drink on a cold evening.","Morris729","Nov 07, 2003"
3.82,-0.8,4,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"I'm guessing this one is from last Christmas season, and at 8% abv and bottle conditioning if handled properly by the good folks at Vintage Cellar this beer should have survived. Bottle gives no dates or info about the brew. Appearance: Deep ruby brown colored body with nice sized tan head leaves perfect rings of lacing with close clusters of tiny patches clinging to the glass very nice. Aroma: Plum like over ripened sweetness with some deep piney hop character going down, a layer of bready yeast note all flows very well aromatically. Taste: Deep thickets of hop bitterness here a mild sweetness comes through with a bready yeast flavor a bit musty but suprisingly quaffable and interesting. Mouthfeel: Medium to full body mild carbonation goes down too easy at 8% abv. Drinkability: A bit complex to enjoy in session but a wonderful beer to sample and enjoy may track some more fresher bottles this coming winter.","WVbeergeek","Oct 10, 2003"

Big bubbles form a billowing, rocky head that doesn't hang around terribly long but doesn't disappoint either. Smells like the outside of a not-quite-sealed bag of chocolate malt, some prunes, and some very light spices. Great taste! Very smooth and easy to drink. Malty sweetness with a tofee kick. I could see a latte lover enjoying this beer -- but tell mom not to get the "grande" size with this one. So drinkable despite it's abv. Very good beer.","marburg","Mar 07, 2003"
4.17,8.3,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Crystal clear, mahogany in color with a quickly thinning dark-beige head (despite a vigorous pour) atop medium-sized bubbles and mild to moderate carbonation. Lacing is coincidentally, like frost on a window. Aroma is rich with plentiful, citrusy hops (Bullion); warm, bready, sweet malts; a hint of caramel, and faint nuts. There is a distinct "lime" character to the hops, and makes for an interesting aroma. Mouthfeel is moderately smooth and soft in finish with a medium-firm body. Taste starts with brisk, floral hops, fades into a firm, yet not overly sweet, earthy malt backbone, and is followed by a soft, toasty graininess. Raisins, dates and figs are minimal without any noteable vinous qualities. The finish is extremely smooth in mouthfeel, however there is a harsh flavor hop towards the end with some astringent roasted grains...the malts are beefy and linger while coating the tongue. Alcohol is hardly noticeable in taste, but creates a pleasant warming effect. Despite others comments that they taste spices, Avery's webpage states that this brew is not flavored with spices, and I don't taste them. This is a complex and rewarding brew, and certainly would benefit from cellaring (the hops are a little rough at this point). If it were a musical scale, it would be Dorian:)","Mitchster","Mar 04, 2003"
4.42,14.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Old Jubilation has a medium-full body (about as expected from an 8% offering) with a nice, tight, non-prickly carbonation falling somewhere between soft and crisp. The flavor is malt driven, but not Crystal maltsI taste mostly dry chocolate malts. In fact, its the dryish aspect of the darker malts that give this beer a good chunk of its earthy, dry, pipe-tobacco-like character. The finish is the samelingering, dry, roasted maltiness with a solid bitterness that doesnt taste particularly hoppy. I understand that this beer is single-hopped with Bullions, but I wouldnt know what a Bullion tasted like after having this beer alone, as the hops seem to mainly impart malt-balancing bitterness in the case of Old Jubilation. The sweetness is very appetizing, even as its juxtaposed against the dryness of the high-kilned malts and the hops, leaving a beautiful combination of brown sugar and roasted, sweetened nuts in my mouth. What a beautifully balanced, complex ale. I wish I had more of this one","TXHops","Feb 24, 2003"
4.17,8.3,4,4.5,4,2.5,5,"Brilliantly clear crimson hue. Topped by a thin, spotty but well retained foam layer that leaves isolated pleomorphic foam aggregates. Sweet, maple syrup laced dark caramel sweetness is ensued by hints of buttery malt and faint dark caramel seemingly above 100 lovibond that provides a roasty edge. Pleasant, mild, dark figgy fruitiness couples with mellow spicy hops to round out the aroma. Brown sugar sweetness at first in flavor is immediately ensued by bready, lightly burnt malt notes and an mildly earthy hop flavor. Light buttery diacetyl emerges slowly and complements the rounded dark caramel. Subdued, dryish date like fruitiness appears late concomitantly with moderate, non descript hop bitterness. Unfortunately a bit shy in body, with an unexpectedly thinnish mouthfeel that falls short of supporting the malt profile. Finishes cleanly sweet, w/ notes of dark chocolate and brown sugar sprinkled crusty bread lingering on the palate. Old Jubilation is a delicious brew. The only noteable weak link in the chain is the weak mouthfeel, perhaps a result of excessive filtration. It is nonetheless an absolutely drinkable, tremendously quaffable brew. It's akin to a Goose Island Christmas Ale / Youngs Special London Ale hybrid, albeit filtered and/or heavily fined.","marc77","Jan 30, 2003"
4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Fluffy, cobwebby off-white head which leaves some lace on the glass. Aroma is mild floral and spicy hops with notes of chocolate. Deep copper-red, which is more brown than red. Full-bodied and moderately carbonated. Flavor is notes of chocolate, caramel, nuts, slight diacetyl, dark fruits, followed by spicy hops and slight warming alcohol (this is 8.0%? I'm surprised) Finish is roasted malt, paper, and light grain bitterness.","comat0se","Jan 27, 2003"
4.26,10.6,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This bold holiday seasonal presents a deep, reddish-mahogany body topped by a frothy light-tan head that holds well and leaves some interesting Brussels lace throughout the glass. The nose is somewhat limited but reveals a sweet grainy malt, some dark fruitiness (raisins, prune), and a touch of floral hoppiness. The body is full with an exceptionally fine carbonation that caresses the tongue before becoming nicely creamy. The flavor is quite rich with a chocolatey note that's entwined with threads of soft dark fruit (raisins, plum, red grape) and balanced by an understated bitterness. The long finish lingers with residual semi-sweet & lightly chocolatey malt, a drying touch of alcohol, some thin hop flavor, and a light bitterness. Very nicely done with alot of character and a very good drinkability despite it's full maltiness and strength.","NeroFiddled","Jan 14, 2003"
3.98,3.4,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Aromas of citrus and caramel. This rolls into a tea-like caramel/toffee malty flavor that has citrus, spice (cinnamon?), and chocolate around the edges - very, very good. For some reason a hint of mint (due to the hops & spice, if any spice is actually used?) appears in the finish - not a bad thing, and sets the flavor of this one apart. The alcohol is very well controlled. Nicely done.","sponberg","Jan 02, 2003"
