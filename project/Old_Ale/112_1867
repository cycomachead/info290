4.45,8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a burnt caramel color with an average head. Sticky lacing on the glass, no "legs" what so ever. In fact I've never seen a beer that stuck to the glass quite like this. Smells of honey and oats. Taste is very rich, but mellow with the high ABV. This is definitely at the top of my ales list.","ScotB260","Mar 24, 2015"

4.82,17,4.75,4.5,5,4.5,5,"O - 5 - One of the absolute best representations of the old ale style I've had and one of the tastiest beers I've had the pleasure of drinking in a LONG time. For fans of these two beers, it almost reminds me of a delicious hybrid mixture of Founder's Curmudgeon and Backwood Bastard. A+, 5 star beer. HIGHLY recommended to stock up on and cellar for a special occasion!","Beer-Revelry","Mar 17, 2015"
