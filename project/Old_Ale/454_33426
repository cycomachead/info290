3.59,-0.8,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,"The beer pours a cloudy gold. The aroma is almost as if it's a barrel aged beer. There is no hint of hops. The first impression of its taste is its sweetness -- almost too much -- with some maltiness and slight funk and hops. Unlike the aroma, there is no barrel aged character in the taste. The beer has a full body and light carbonation. Overall, it is a good beer but not likely one that I'd go back to often.","breakingbland","Dec 22, 2014"

3.9,7.7,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 12/30/2013. Pours fairly hazy/cloudy deep orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, cherry, apple, herbal, grass, light leather, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, cherry, apple, herbal, grass, light leather, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy herbal/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, cherry, apple, herbal, grass, light leather, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity and balance of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice old ale style. All around good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 16, 2014"
