3.79,6.2,3.75,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Strong, malty aroma has an earth overtone that brings to mind fallen leaves, as well as hints of cloves and caramel. Pours a barely translucent warm dark woody brown with a fairly thick tan head. Flavor just says "autumn" with roast malt and earth tones plus a hint of cloves. Itâ€™s almost like drinking the very essence of autumn. Smooth texture has decent body and fizz. An excellent brew to celebrate fall.","Cyberkedi","Nov 30, 2014"
