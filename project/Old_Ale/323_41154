4.7,10.6,4,4.5,5,4.75,4.5,"M/O- This is probably the fullest bodied a beer I've had to date and very possibly will remain in that position for a long time.  The carbonation is smooth and velvety, allowing the flavors to eloquently flow around the palate.  Surprisingly, this isn't cloying at all and the dryness leaves me craving the next sip....I'm very impressed by this characteristic!  Overall this is a stunning brew that is on another level than most others....I very highly recommend this!  It is complex, very easy drinking, and becomes a shame when its done.  I will seek this out again and feel it is worth the price of admission!","ChrisCage","Nov 06, 2014"
