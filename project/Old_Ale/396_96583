4.08,2.8,4.25,4.25,4,4,4,"Full bodied with light carbonation. Very chewy. A very good beer which would have been even better if the alcohol was hidden somewhat, and the beer wasn't so sweet.","hardy008","Mar 07, 2015"
4.16,4.8,4,4.25,4,4.5,4.25,"Deep brown in color with ruby highlights and some penetration to light.  A fingernail of khaki head covers the rim and a third of the top of the glass.  Light Brussels lacing.  Wonderful aroma of dark malt, dates, hazelnut, and dark rum.  The taste is a burst of dark malt, hazelnut, toffee, dates, and dark rum.  The mouth is thick, chewy, and there's a warmth from the alcohol.","Franziskaner","Mar 07, 2015"

3.97,0,4.25,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall: a solid old ale. at about a year old, this one still has quite a bit of booziness. slowing the slightest signs of age but only in a good way. it will be interested to see where this one goes in the future.","SportsandJorts","Feb 22, 2015"
