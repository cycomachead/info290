Aroma of bready and dark caramel malt, dark dried fruit, molasses. Flavor is sweet, rich caramel malt, molasses, dark dried fruit, particularly figs and dates, boozy. Finishes thick and sweet with nice residual dried fruit flavors. Heavy bodied with a rich creaminess. Just what I'm looking for in an old ale, this borders on an English barleywine, but has even more maltiness. A bit hot, but plenty of rich flavor to support the alcohol. I remember enjoying this in the Decadence version, and am glad it's in regular rotation now.  I'm going back for a few to cellar.","LiquidAmber","Sep 05, 2014"

4.04,1.8,3.75,4,4,4,4.25,"love the old ale style, and how many different ways it gets brewed. this is one of the more classic english types, almost a barleywine, but with a lot more pronounced malt fruitiness and a more drinkable overall beer, but there are plenty of similarities. very english in nature, tons of yeast character here, bready and toffee-esque flavors, and plenty of chunky yeast floccy bits in the beer too. radiant burnt caramel color, with a lasting thick but mellow tan head, nice looking brew. the body i found to be just a touch thin, but the flavors are all rich enough it doesnt really need to be any more beefy. the toffee grain profile is big, the alcohol stands out just enough, and i find the whole thing quite decadent, despite having an earthy middle and self cleaning finish. not overly complex, but extremely sturdy at 11% abv. a beer to let warm up, drink slowly, and in good company. all of the big alesmith beers are so well done, this one should serve as an example to other american brewers looking to make old ale, its that good.","StonedTrippin","Aug 05, 2014"

Nose reveals dark fruits (some grape) and a suggestion of caramel or toffee. Taste follows nose - more dark fruit and less caramel/toffee; however, there's also a slightly metallic quality. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a carbonation that falls just short of lively - perhaps a little too assertive at this point. Overall, a decent old ale but not worth the price point. Based on the metallic quality in the flavor profile, I don't anticipate this will age well.","Jwale73","Aug 01, 2014"

4.06,2.3,4.5,4,4,4.25,4,"2013 "Old Ale" big bottle from a trip to the brewery back in November (pouring on 4/11/14). Pours deep dark purplish reddish brownish amber color with a one finger khaki head. Aroma is dark fruits, plums, raisins, fig, sweet brown sugar. Big malts here as expected. Flavor is very sweet with hints of those same prune and fig notes found on the aroma, some nice caramel, and more brown sugar sweet to finish. Just a hint of subtle dry hop bitterness to finish and balance things out. I can see how this would age incredibly in a bourbon barrel. Big body, medium soft carbonation, and a sipper. Very nice in style. AleSmith just does everything well.","BMMillsy","Apr 09, 2014"
