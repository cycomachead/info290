3.88,-3.5,3.75,3.75,4,4,3.75,"maybe if this years batch was 12.4% abv, the heat could balance the sweet.  As is it now, enjoyable but underwhelming.  It took me three days to finish the bottle, as I would have a small glass and then decide I wanted a better beer, so I'd grab a Backwoods Bastard or a Hopslam ( cork the Hibernation and stick it back in fridge)","Jjski","Mar 21, 2015"

3.7,-8,3.5,4,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Deep dark brown in color with just the faintest trace of a fingernail of khaki head around the rim.  A touch of light seeps through when held up to light.  Light Brussels lacing.  I smell plenty of sweet whiskey along with vanilla and caramel.  The taste is packed with sweet whiskey and dark malt.  The mouth is bone dry and sticky.  There's a warming from the alcohol in the fade with a gentle burn.  2014 vintage.","Franziskaner","Feb 08, 2015"
