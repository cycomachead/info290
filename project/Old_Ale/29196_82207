3.66,12.6,3.25,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"I love a drinkable, flavorful, solid ale. This one fits the bill. It is an amber-copper color with a frothy white head. The aroma is malt forward, with a little fruit. Slight background of herbal hops. The flavor is balanced...nice malt backbone with firm bitterness that lingers. Full in body. This is a well made, drinkable ale.","Suds","Jun 09, 2014"

3.48,7.1,4,3.5,3.25,4,3.5,"However, the lengthier description also makes it sound like an older, endemic style of American beer. The above scores are what I'd give it as a California Common. It was a crisp and refreshing beer. If you're expecting the fruity malts of an old ale, then skip this. If you want an easy drinking summer beer, this will suit you fine.","RichardMNixon","Mar 03, 2014"

The taste is the same, light and crisp, with a sweeter flavor; some apple notes. The body is rather light and the beer is overall watery. Overall its by no means bad, but nothing too special.","vette2006c5r","Dec 27, 2013"

3.16,-2.8,5,2.75,3,4,3,"My initial pour produced two fingers of fizzy, rocky french-vanilla colored head with decent retention. Color was a deep coppery-amber (SRM = 9) with NE-quality clarity. Nose gave off a metallic twang along with a piney hop character. Mouthfeel was medium, approaching fullness, and the taste was odd for the style, more caramel malt-forward than I expected or would have liked with the hops almost a passenger along for the ride. I got a quick wash of grassy mintiness on the finish, but this was not my bag, especially in light of the style. That said, I have gathered that they like to play around with styles and such at SBC, but they need to play just a bit more with this one, IMHO. YMMV.","woodychandler","Oct 23, 2013"

3.69,13.5,4,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.5," The flavor is very crisp up front with sligth spice and herbal flavors from the hops which seem to have a fruity influence alongside the yeast with slight toasted and caramel flavor from the malt base with some mild sweetness in the finish. Overall this is not a bad beer to me, it does have more of an English yeast and hop flavor than American Pale ale qualities, but I found it pretty drinkable for the style.","Slatetank","Apr 10, 2013"

3.56,9.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"The beer pours a deep golden/amber color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma decent. It has a bone dry pale malt scent along with a light touch of caramel malt for color and body. The hop aroma is adequate, but nothing to write home about. The taste is decent as well. It has a crisp, clean flavor with a solid malt character and a mild hop bitterness. It goes down easy with a very dry finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty solid brew, but nothing I'd go out of my way to find.","WesWes","Feb 09, 2013"
3.38,4,3.75,3.25,3.5,3.25,3.25,"This is quite a mild apa, if it's even that. Lots of malts with a minimal hop presence. What's there barely nips, though at least there is something. Seems earthy and restricted. Biting carbonation. Easy to drink, sure, but not really that interesting. Of probably try this if it were on cask.","RblWthACoz","Jan 21, 2013"

And yeah, it's hard to shake that phantom macro-lager profile, though this definitely has more to offer. Let's talk about marketing & expectations here. They call this a "stock ale" on the label & website, which to me says "old ale", though it's 5.5% ABV & listed on BA here as an American pale. Maybe I'm a little shy on my history here, but I really didn't know where to calibrate my expectations of this beer. Hopefully my appraisal didn't suffer, but it was a bit confusing. Regardless of what it's "supposed" to be, the lack of balance really hurt it.","OneDropSoup","Nov 11, 2012"
