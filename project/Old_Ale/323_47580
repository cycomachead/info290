4.1,-4.2,4,4,4,4,4.5," deep caramel smell coming off of this, literally took me by surprise. Nice aroma of oak and alcohol mixing and swirling around with it now, really starting to pick up steam the warmer it got. Warm oak infused notes of brandy like alcohol running over the tongue, so sweet and sugary. As you roll it around you start to notice there is a little bit of a bitter bite to this one. Way down deep under all of the malt, there was a subtle bitter hoppiness, very grainy and earthy, but it was there, and really pushed through on the finish. Long drawn out finish it was, The alcohol was so well blended, it was a deadly combination. Soo mellow and smooth, understated, it lured you in and would not let you go. The body was as rich and smooth as the flavorDeep dark fruit now coming through for me, really started to actually dominate the scene all together. Huge raisin and plum notes giving it that sweet but yet tart dark fruit flavor we all come to love. A spicy touch in the back perhaps, but here comes that little bit of bitterness to wrap it all up.","mikesgroove","Nov 15, 2011"

The flavors are so lackluster that I can't help but feel I am not having the same bottle as a great deal of reviewers on this site. That said, The flavor characters remain in tact, but they are just so mellow and two-tone. Yes there is sweetness, and yes there is the barrel wood; but dare I ask, where is the flavor? Fruits make appearances like apparitions in a long since abandoned home, and I would like nothing more than than to revitalize their home. Phantom flavors don't belong in barrels, which makes me believe the bottle may be compromised to the point that I question even doing this review. However, considering the fact that I have reviewed the prior beers in a horizontal, I feel obligated to put it here. Please let me know I am wrong in saying this beer is bringing open handed-slaps to a boxing match. Hit me with flavor, don't leave me wanting.","Cavery","Jun 12, 2011"

It's hard to really explain but it's great. The beer tastes sweet and with a whiskey back bone. There is some vanilla in there not much chocolate but a little bit and a good amount of smokiness there too. The flavors are strong and very pleasing.

Color: black that seems black oil. Viscous texture, almost like a liqueur. Aroma of vanilla, oak, whiskey, something smoked, roasted malts, bitter chocolate and coffee, all that just in aroma! Flavor of roasted malt, sweet, sour, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, wine (Madeira and Porto) and especially whiskey and oak wood. Low carbonation and long aftertaste of whiskey, alcohol and coffee.

Wonderful taste, the whiskey flavor is very much there, and unfortunately dominates, even more so than the other aged versions; still has some nice dark roasted malt attributes, though, and it shouldn't be a surprise that it's so whisky flavored.

That said, it was difficult to ignore this offering, given that I recently finished the 12 and 18 year old Highland Park malt whiskies, and trying the 40 year old, by proxy, I just couldn't say no.

4.29,0.2,4,5,4,4.5,4,"Very dark, nearly black, with not much in the way of visible edges. It had a thick tan/brown cap of very fine bubbles, good head retention with sticky, spotty lacing. Great aroma. Lots of whisky character when the bottle was opened, more of a refined alcohol that you get from a good scotch rather than a boozy nose. Notes of caramel and vanilla, lots of malt, a hints of chocolate and smoke, plus a bit of oak. Mild to moderate bitterness, toffee and caramel sweetness, whisky, light vanilla and woodiness. There was a bit of wood tannin dryness and booze, but it stayed refined and pleasant throughout. Full bodied with low carbonation made of up fine bubbles. Mild warmth and a tingle of alcohol on the tongue. Nice texture. I quite enjoyed this. The marriage of beer and whisky really worked.","DrJay","May 03, 2010"

3.97,-7.2,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,"330ml bottle from the LCBO. Pours pitch black with a thin cap of tan head and dots of lacing on the snifter. Aroma is oak barrel, whisky, almonds, sweet dark fruit, and herbal English hops. A bit creamy. Taste is chocolate and roasted malts, woody and bitter, some liquor, raisins, a little hop spice, and a toasted, flaked oat finish, very dry and chalky. As the beer warms it becomes more vinous and fruity, but its not as bold, flavourful, or complex as I expected. I let it sit for 45 minutes before drinking, so the temperature can't be a problem. Mouthfeel is velvety, slick, oily, parched and oaky aftertaste, a tad boozy. Overall, this is a damn fine ale, with most of the technical elements that define the style, yet the taste underwhelms, and I don't love it like I thought I would.","cratez","0"

4.42,3.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"11.2 ounce bottle, bottle 54407, bottled on January 20, 2009. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours very dark brown with a half inch tan head. Head retention is good, but not much lacing. The brew smells like roasted malt, chocolate, dark fruit, smoke, peat, iodine, oak, and vanilla. The Scotch Whisky aromas are pretty strong in this brew! The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, it's all Scotch and malt. And as far as I'm concerned, that's a good thing. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it has low/moderate carbonation and it's a little bit coating although it does seem a bit thin at times. Drinkability is very good, it's smooth and pretty easy to drink. Overall I think this is a pretty good beer, but then I like malty beers and Scotch. That and I liked the other Ola Dubh beers I've tried.

3.85,-10,4,4,4,4.5,3,"This brew pours black as night (looked more stout than old ale) w/ a thin tan head. Beautiful lacing that continued to hang on the glass throughout the sampling. The nose on this one was of strong chocolate and roasted espresso beans up front w/ oak, light scotch, and vanilla pipe tobacco in the background. Taste was pretty much on point w/ the nose, with the addition of burnt toffee, woodiness, and a slight alcohol warmth on the finish. Medium bodied - kinda slick on the tongue, and leaves dry and clean. This was an enjoyable offering, but this is more scotch than beer in my opinion, which takes away from it's drinkability. Definate sipper. Not that it matters to the review, but this one is extremely pricey @ $19.99/11.2oz. bottle. Overall, not amazing, but nice and would sample again anytime.","mikeyv35","Jun 26, 2009"

Not very boozy, and the whisky notes are incredible. On the palate, the nose is replicated, opening up with the whisky, along with a mild licorice, brown sugar, nuttiness.

Superb, and my favorits of the series after the 30 year cask. Pours black with no head, but no worries here. Smells of peat, the barrel, and whisky. Very smooth and balanced and not in the least bit hot- compared to say, the 18 which was quite so. The taste is beautifully balanced with lots of restrained whiskey character. Briny, smooth, peaty, malty, and simply whiskyish. Wonderful. Ultra smooth in the mouth and deliciously drinkable.","Georgiabeer","Feb 20, 2009"

Looks very similar to the 30 yr in that it is an ink black, this one has little to almost no head though. Very low carbonization, as well, it really looks like ink, really... The whiskey smell is apparent, with some sweet malt hints. A very warming feeling as soon as it hits your mouth, the whiskey is once again significantly present. There is some , maybe caramel, sweetness in the background that provides an interesting dynamic to the whiskey. I enjoyed drinking this to start off my evening at the Brick, but the strength of it, and the whiskey, makes it more of a beer that stands on it own. Definitely a distinct, and delicious flavor.","bhalter8","Feb 20, 2009"

Smells mostly of whisky with some burnt roasted malts in the nose. First sip is tangy with a rush of whisky being by far the most dominate flavor. There is chocolate and a tad of coffee along with some burnt malts and dark fruits all a supporting role. As it warms, some vanilla and smoke appear adding to the beer's complexity. There is absolutely no carbonation present and the beer is fairly light bodied. I sipped this in a vertical of Old Engine Oil, 12 Year, 30 Year, and a shot of 12 Year old single malt Highland Park Whisky.
