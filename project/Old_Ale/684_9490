4.47,10.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"2008 vintage, poured into a Gulden Draak Tulip. Pours a dark, slightly murky mahogany orange amber. One finger, fine off-white head and nice lacing. Aroma of wood, light caramel malt and dark fruit. Flavor is mellow sweet and caramel malt, wood and vanilla, nicely integrated. Finish is somewhat dry, earthy and hop bitter with a final suggestion of the woody notes. Body is medium with a bit of creaminess. This has aged beautifully and is a very nice aged old ale. I hope I get a chance to review this fresh. It came on the market 2 years old and has aged an additional year in my cellar.","LiquidAmber","Jul 27, 2011"

3.92,-3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"2008 vintage shared by Thirstybird. Pours the color of cider with no head, just a cluster of bubbles and a swirl of foam across the surface. Some spots of lacing, but no retention. Nose expresses light toasted malts, toffee, prunes and a trace of ethanol. Taste follows nose with the addition of a hops character all on a malty backbone. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an even carbonation. All and all a very drinkable beer, but somewhat light for the style with a well-hidden abv.","Jwale73","Nov 28, 2010"

4,-1,4,4,4,4,4,"We are loving this beer, as it grows on us sip after sip. Cellaring this beer could add to the complex character that it possesses, though it's just fine to sip now. A perfect pairing would be with a mild Manchengo cheese and some ripe figs.","BeerAdvocate","Sep 16, 2009"
4.35,7.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured an opaque, dark reddish-brown with a small tannish head. Nose is full, caramel. Taste of a big earthiness, detect wood, caramel, fruits and a nice feel of booze. Mouthfeel is sweet, coating, caramel very present as with booze and those wood like elements. Very good!","barleywinefiend","Aug 11, 2009"

4.37,8.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"D- Very drinkable until the 10% ABV catches up with you! I imaging this brew will age quite nicely as well!","jgasparine","Mar 31, 2009"
4.25,5.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Been holding on to this one for about two years. A 12 ounce bottle - 2005 vintage. Uncapped and poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass. The ale appears a rather cloudy color akin to fresh dark brewed iced tea with around two fingers of creamy light ecru colored foam. The head leaves a minimal lace on the inside of my glass. Nose and flavor consist of lots of brown sugar, molasses, dates, raisins, figs, pine, oak, vanilla, dried cherries. nearly full bodied with just about the perfect amount of carbonation for an old ale of this age. Quite smooth drinking with only the slightest hint of alcohol warmth in the throat as the ale warms. Very nice!","ClockworkOrange","Mar 22, 2009"
3.59,-11.1,2.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Dark amber to brown in color and quite murky due to high sediment. The sediment was a surprise as I poured carefully into two glasses for my brother-in-law and I and dumped the bottom. I figure some of the sediment was suspended in the bottle somehow as it wasn't settled out despite having sat in my fridge for about a month. Stong malt nose with just a faint whiff of hops and perhaps some evergreen notes. Strong flavors of malt with quite a bit of booze presence. There are some bits of wood flavors, presumably oak but it really just comes in as wood. About what I expected for the style. Not as drinkable as I had hoped. I think that the mouthfeel and the body was failing a bit to carry the alcohol. I suppose its pretty decent, but not my favorite. There does seem to be some spice and evergreen in the finish and as I "grow comfortable" with this beer it begins to grow on me a little bit.","Ragingbull","Feb 01, 2009"
4.28,5.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"The mouth is full and warm, the alcohol hiding but not biting. Carbonation is just enough, everything in this department fits well into the whole. Taste is wallowing in dark fruits and alcohol. The booze isn't oppressive, but it doesn't hide at all. And, I really like it. Its a strong, heady beast of a beer, have to take some time to get through it, but its a treat. Bitterness is spot on, toasted grains and caramel malts, quite nice. In all, a good beer, a good name, a must try for big beer fans.","objectivemonkey","Dec 21, 2008"
4.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"D: Big flavors and sweetness, not to mention the 10% alcohol make this a sipper rather than a guzzler. However, this is a smooth drink and goes down quite easy. Very dangerous combination.","Japerrault",
