4.47,10.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"2008 vintage, poured into a Gulden Draak Tulip. Pours a dark, slightly murky mahogany orange amber. One finger, fine off-white head and nice lacing. Aroma of wood, light caramel malt and dark fruit. Flavor is mellow sweet and caramel malt, wood and vanilla, nicely integrated. Finish is somewhat dry, earthy and hop bitter with a final suggestion of the woody notes. Body is medium with a bit of creaminess. This has aged beautifully and is a very nice aged old ale. I hope I get a chance to review this fresh. It came on the market 2 years old and has aged an additional year in my cellar.","LiquidAmber","Jan 13, 2012"

Some spots of lacing, but no retention. Nose expresses light toasted malts, toffee, prunes and a trace of ethanol. Taste follows nose with the addition of a hops character all on a malty backbone. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an even carbonation. All and all a very drinkable beer, but somewhat light for the style with a well-hidden abv.","Jwale73","Jul 27, 2011"

4.25,5.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Been holding on to this one for about two years. A 12 ounce bottle - 2005 vintage. Uncapped and poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass. The ale appears a rather cloudy color akin to fresh dark brewed iced tea with around two fingers of creamy light ecru colored foam. The head leaves a minimal lace on the inside of my glass. Nose and flavor consist of lots of brown sugar, molasses, dates, raisins, figs, pine, oak, vanilla, dried cherries. nearly full bodied with just about the perfect amount of carbonation for an old ale of this age. Quite smooth drinking with only the slightest hint of alcohol warmth in the throat as the ale warms. Very nice!","ClockworkOrange","Sep 15, 2009"
3.59,-11.1,2.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Dark amber to brown in color and quite murky due to high sediment. The sediment was a surprise as I poured carefully into two glasses for my brother-in-law and I and dumped the bottom. I figure some of the sediment was suspended in the bottle somehow as it wasn't settled out despite having sat in my fridge for about a month. Stong malt nose with just a faint whiff of hops and perhaps some evergreen notes. Strong flavors of malt with quite a bit of booze presence. There are some bits of wood flavors, presumably oak but it really just comes in as wood. About what I expected for the style. Not as drinkable as I had hoped. I think that the mouthfeel and the body was failing a bit to carry the alcohol. I suppose its pretty decent, but not my favorite. There does seem to be some spice and evergreen in the finish and as I "grow comfortable" with this beer it begins to grow on me a little bit.","Ragingbull","Aug 10, 2009"

Taste is wallowing in dark fruits and alcohol. The booze isn't oppressive, but it doesn't hide at all. And, I really like it. Its a strong, heady beast of a beer, have to take some time to get through it, but its a treat. Bitterness is spot on, toasted grains and caramel malts, quite nice. In all, a good beer, a good name, a must try for big beer fans.","objectivemonkey","Jul 09, 2009"

It opened with a loud "pfffft", letting me know that all was well with this oldie. The color of this gem is a ruby tinged brown, that is just not quite clear. There was a fairly large off-white head on mine. A wonderful mix of fruits, floral, woody and spicy aromas. Very smooth and rounded taste. A faint tartness to it with some fruits providing that. Spices, malts and a tinge of alcohol in the background. Very warming as it goes down. This is very good!","Boto","Dec 13, 2008"

4.32,6.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"a beautiful Old Ale, and a beautiful brew in general. Again, this year's (consumed this year) seems a bit fresh and a touch hot. It's highly enjoyable right now, with some earthy heat overtaking some of the honey and maple sweetness. I can only imagine how this one will mature in a few years. Definitely worth a try, and if you can save a few (or find an older batch) then it's bound to be ephemeral bliss.","djeucalyptus","Oct 29, 2008"
4.1,1.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"2008 vintage. Pours a dark amber, rusty brown in color with a good sized cream head that slowly dissipates. Sweet maltiness in the aroma, some raisins, caramel, berries and breadiness. Some alcohol is evident in the aroma as well. Taste is a good blend of caramel maltiness, some cotton candy sweetness, a biscuity bread flavor, slightly toasted, and some grassy hop bitterness. A warmth of alcohol in the finish. Medium to heavy in body, slightly creamy feel, drying in the finish and a well balanced warmth of alcohol in the end. Very good beer, much better as it warms. Maybe a little understated, but I like the fact that it is somewhat simple and straightforward rather than having too much going on. Will age some for a year or two and check back. Thanks Bottletrek for having this in stock, my first order with them.","hoppymeal","Sep 17, 2008"
4.1,1.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 Oz Bottle via footy. Unique savory nose packed with freshly trodden moss, wet mushrooms, strawberry seeds, pinyon smoke, and barbequed salmon skin. This fights an even handed battle with your typical Old Ale malt aroma, lightly of wood and sweetened with raisins and brown sugar. A heavily blush amber rushes into the glass with a sienna tinted ring around the edge. Core of carbonation. Flavor is an intense amalgam of unique flavors, rich and savory. The unique earthy qualities of the nose have been downplayed into a more refined essence with some grilled vegetables, Mediterranean herbs and light balsamic vinegar, young. The mature fruits and pale strong ale esters glow a little in the middle, before being swept away by a nicely grassy and fresh hop body, bittering on the way out in a traditional feel. Alcohols perks up the back end over a rather fluffy texture and something not fatiguing. Spicy mixed nut smack. Delicious. Further down, spritzy lemon soda and citrus arrive in the middle of the hop body. An excellent, flavorful, well rounded, nice brewed example.","CharlesDarwin","Aug 07, 2008"

Smell is mellow and balanced and very rounded and obviously aged with malt and light hops and oak all in harmony. Taste is light to moderately tart and oaky with almost a kriek like flavor to it in addition to a smooth maltiness. Oaky, hoppy finish to it. Age has changed this quite a bit from what it was, I was told, but still quite good, and highly drinkable.","JDV","Apr 06, 2008"

Definite notes of chocolate and coffee. Little bit o' citrus, little bit o' pepper and other kitchen spices. Better-than-average mouthfeel and a pleasant roasty aftertaste that I really enjoyed.

Taste of toffee malt and subtle dry fruits is well balance by some medium NW hops with s a subtle piney finish. Full body with some adequate carbonation and no alcohol was noticeable.

Toffee and butterscotch malts on the nose, along with light vegetal hops, some oak, yeast, and a little sugar. Toasted malt and herbal hop bitterness up front on the palate. Turns fruitier and sweet, with developing notes of butterscotch and caramel. Pine sap and herbal bitterness towards the bittersweet, warming finish. Medium-full body. Would feel syrupy if not for ample, ticklish, bottle-conditioned effervescence. Smooth, warming, and very good.","alexgash","Mar 24, 2007"
4,-1,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a quite cloudy reddish-brown, with an average sized yellow-tan head that dissipates rather quickly and leaves very scant lacing. Smell is very oaky, with piles of sweet malts coming through as well. Caramel and sticky-sweet dates and raisins show, with some spicy alcohol and whiskey in the mix as well. Taste is fruity and funky at the same time, with cherries and plums mixing with earthy tomes and wood. A touch of bitter chocolate and tobacco appear as well, and there is a definite alcohol presence which isn't quite welcome. Finish is quite dry, with some yeast and oaky tones, and it lingers well. Mouthfeel has plenty of body and is nicely warming, but lacks a bit of punch. Drinkability is quite good. A nice old ale, it's got plenty of character, but it just doesn't quite stand out as much as it could.","Mandrake","Mar 22, 2007"

Thick layer of sediment left at thte bottom of my glass. Complex smells with lots of thick malt, and a nice warming alcohol aroma. Sweet malt, dark fruits, and more warming (but not really burning) alcohol. Thick and clinging mouthfeel, creamy and smooth. Very well made old style ale, high alcohol content is well balanced and hidden. Good to savor on a cold day. Assume it would cellar well, and round out nicely.","BigBry","Jan 21, 2007"

3.85,-4.7,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The taste is sweet up front with lots of malt sugars focused here. It quickly picks up toasted & even roasted notes though, especially through to the finish where it reminds me of dark cup of coffee at times. Chewy toasted grain notes that even have an astringent edge to it are noticeable in the finish too. Caramelized notes of dark, concentrated fruits and chewy malty sweetish notes of malted chocolate balls sort of mix and help to balance out the more toasted / roasted aspects of this brew. The beer, despite it relatively light color, even finishes with a bit of roasted grain derived acidity; it is at a low level here and really seems to balance out the sweetness more than detract. A touch hot in the finish at times, or more accurately, and much more appropriately, this beer provides a bit of a warming character, which is quite nice on this cool autumn night. This is one beer which should age quite well, I'll definitely have to pick up a few more of these.","Gueuzedude","Nov 15, 2006"

The taste lacks the same depth as the aroma, it opens with some of the chocolate malt flavor but stays low on the sweetness, leading to a finish that's stronger in flavor with some roasted character and minor bitterness. Alcohol is fairly well-hidden for 10%. The mouthfeel is nice, leaning a bit to the thin side, with lower carbonation.

3.6,-10.9,4,4,3.5,4,3,"This one pours a hazy dark brown with a sizeable, creamy off-white/cream head. The aroma is fairly vinous and creates an almost whiskey-like aroma from the malt and alcohol. The barleywine like fruitiness also adds to the impression of strength, without any actual alcohol flavors. The wine in the flavor is actually a little off-putting to me, but its a complex beer that deserves a try.","aracauna","Jan 27, 2005"

4.32,6.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a very clear ruddy brown color, at first appearing to have no carbonation, but with thin wisps of tan foam swirling at the surface after a few seconds. Aroma is nutty caramel sweet, like a piece of fine English toffee. Some apple cider mixes in as well and the nose. Flavor is a very nice balancing act, with a clear vintage/old ale character and just enough oak to notice without making you feel like you're chewing on acorns. Sweet and caramely, nary a hint of hops here but they're not notably missing either. Malt sweetness transitions into a slight spiced bruised fuity tartness. Mouthfeel is full but the Woody isn't overly thick in body. Comes off smooth, complex, and very tasty. A very pleasant surprise. Thanks to weefisheads to turning me on to this one.","mikeys01","Jan 15, 2005"

4.22,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"This was from a 12oz 2003bottle sampled on 12/15/04. With a fairly vigorous pour no head emerge just a few random bubbles over a murky brownish amber body. Aroma is very earthy, ripe dark fruits and nice malty sweetness to it. There are strong notes of smokiness and a wood in the nose as well. The flavor was heavily sweet and smoky which seemed to balance out fairly well over an earthy hop bitterness. There are woody notes as you would expect and a slight noticeable alcohol presence. Notes of dark fruits were there also and this ends on a sweet and fruity tart note. Mouthfeel is pretty good with almost a full feel to it that is a but syrupy sticky. Pretty good drinkability too on this interesting brew. Overall the flavors meld well together forming a pretty unique brew.","meathookjones","Dec 22, 2004"
3.77,-6.7,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"November 2001 Vintage in 750ml. Poured dark and nearly still looking like a stale cola - dark brown with some ruby hints. The nose was great, especially if you like oak which was smack dab in the middle. The taste was oak, sweet sherry and dried orange peel in a rather light body. It is very easy to drink meaning the alcohol is not evident but it may need some food to compliment the unique tastes as the label suggests. I've had their Barleywine and Imperial Stout aged in oak and both work better than an Old Ale. I can't remember what this tastes like fresh but aging is not a major help.","lou91","Nov 15, 2004"
4.33,7.2,4.5,4,5,5,3,"Slight sour, deep dark malt, dry oak and many red wine qualities. Over oaked? Hardly. The deep, rich, fruity malts meld with the wine qualities perfectly to create a very well made beer. Once again I am shocked at one of Fish's barrel aged offerings.","Crosling","Oct 02, 2004"

3.24,-19.8,2,3,3.5,4,3,"Poured a dark cloudy Brown ale with no attempt at forming a head let alone retaining it. Aroma is very sweet and malty with a strong alcoholic presence. The flavor began with a sweet malt flavor that quickly segued into a smoky flavor with a piney almost minty hop bitterness. I did not like this beeras much as the Fish Tale IPA but it still had qualities about it that were outstanding. The flavor may have been off but the body is very nice as it has a semi-thick viscous texture without overwhelming the drinker. The body allows the flavors to be conveyed more smoothly than a higher bodied beer while the carbonation is mild enough to not contribute any carbonic bite. Overall this beer has aspects of it which are ideal while it is also in need of a little fine tuning.","RenoZymurgist","Aug 02, 2004"

Lacing in glaring spots. Aroma has some dark cherry right away, other dark fruits emerge gradually with some fig, dates and darkened citrus. Caramel and toffee notes hide underneath a bit of earthy wet woods. Some fairly apparent ethonal heat and even a bit of phenolic hints peep in as well. Taste has a nice toasty caramel overall. Warm, soothing, welcoming, first few sips, very gradually and subtle flavors creep across the palate with some slight dark citrus orangeness, some fig and cherry, also hints of pine wood from hops decorate the finish with some solid warming effects. Feel is about medium, well rounded, gets fuller towards the end, creamy with some fine warming qualities throughout each sip. A nice rendition of a Old Ale style, one I tend to favor more then the English variety.","tavernjef","Jun 09, 2004"
4.12,2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This was a 2002 edition. The beer looks like boot polish but smells like a Belgian Pine forest if Belgian had pines. The flavour is vinous yet refined. I felt like Fish was trying to replicate a Gale's Old ale which is fine with me. This is a big beer and needs to be savoured after dinner with some strong cheeses. It is so cool that Fish produces a Barleywine and a Imperial Stout as well as this Old Ale. These guys are giving Rogue a run for the money as best PNW brewer.","canucklehead","Apr 05, 2004"
4.07,0.7,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,3,"Old Woody 2003 was served from a 12 oz. bottle. In a pint glass, the beer was rich reddish nut-brown color, and was topped by a light tannish head that quickly disappeared altogether. The nose nearly knocked me off of my feet...big booziness, dark roasted chocolate, and a smooth yet robust bourbony maltiness. I found it to be quite enticing once I got used to the overt booziness. The taste was monsterous and boozy as well, reflecting the nose closely. The rich roasty nutty-chocolate malt base was soaked in a bourbon-like booziness, and had accents of vanilla and earthiness. This gives way to a potently bitter finish, though it is difficult to determine if this comes from hops or alcohol. I enjoyed the level of sweetness thoughout: it was toned down compared to many old ales. All of this sounds off-putting, but I found that booziness worked very well with the malt profile and finish...and made for a very enjoyable experience. The body was full enough for the flavors but the carbonation was certainly too low...making the flavor less lively than it could have been. As one would expect from a beer of this intensity, it is not very drinkable...12 oz is more than plenty. In the end, a walloping bear of a beer with character, best enjoyed in cold weather as a warmer. I imagine this one would do very well in the cellar for at least 2 years.","HiroProtagonist","Mar 09, 2004"
3.78,-6.4,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"This was the 2003, 12 oz bottle. It pours a dark caramel with reddish hues and a thin, tan head that leaves a nice lacing. Not quite opaque in the glass, but very dark. The aroma is light and woody with a distinctive alcohol presence. The alcohol is far less (though not un) distinguishable in the flavor, which is big and malty with the "woody-ness" appearing more in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat syrupy. This is a very nice strong ale -- particularly if you are a woody-beer lover -- but it's a bit big to drink a bunch in a sitting.","jtfest","Mar 04, 2004"

However, I will remember this one well if they never brew another. I hope they do (or have). This is worthy of the arrogance on the label which says "Artist Series" It is highly drinkable if you enjoy a challenge. Thank you Fish.","faernt","Jan 01, 2004"
4.3,6.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Update  I sat down to review this again the week of Christmas 2004 and, guess what, it hasnt changed a bit.

4.59,13.6,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"750 ml bottle simply capped - no cork. Bottled in November 2001. A two to three inch head of creamy light-tan foam rests majestically above a cloudy dark-brown body which reveals some reddish-mahogany highlights when held directly to the light. Eventually, the head drops to a creamy collar and thin surface covering; but it also leaves some very nice lace throughout the glass. The nose is distinctly oaky and reminiscent of good bourbon with a whiff of alcohol above the sweetish malt. The skins of dark fruits, a touch of molasses, and some light acidity follow; leaving the bouquet fairly complex and immensely enjoyable. The aroma alone could be enjoyed for the better part of an hour! The body is medium, creamy, and silky across the tongue! Its flavor explodes in the mouth, rich with chocolate-laced caramel and molasses... and drenched in alcohol and fruit juices (cherry, prune, orange, red grape, plum, raisin)! The bitterness is low-level in comparison to the rich maltiness at this point, and it's quite well balanced. It's very wine-like in many ways; and it finishes with a wash of drying spicy alcohol, some light cocoa, and some residual fruitiness and lingering chalky bitterness. It's surprisingly warming for being only 10%, but it's not overdone as it works well within the character of the beer. This beer will probably improve through cellaring for another two to three years, and may hold for much longer than that! I'd recommend this as a great fireside beer with a good book (let's say "The Count of Monte Cristo"), but it's just too strong and warming to get through more than one or two chapters. Maybe it's best for simply relaxing in front of the fire during a fall or winter night - or on the porch during a cool spring or summer evening as the sun goes down. And for the cigar afficianado, this is a prime choice! But for fans of oak-aged beers, this is a must! Exceptionally well done and well worth seeking out.","NeroFiddled","May 31, 2003"
4.05,0.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"This beer shows a nice deep scarlet red hue. Very slight chill haze is noted. A nice looking thick and creamy light beige head sits on top of the beer and sticks around for a while. Great retention. ( I wouldn't expect anything less from a beer named Woody.) The lace coats the glass in sheets. Aroma is primarily sweet. There are also subtle hints of cherry, wood and bourbon. The mouthfeel of this beer is very smooth. Velvety. Body is about medium-full. The taste is unique for an Old Ale. The aging in wine barrels really adds some woody and oaky/bourbon-like/winey notes to the beer. The alcohol presence is fairly blunt. A little too much for my liking, but acceptable. The aftertaste is primarily that of sharp bitterness from the EtOH. With a lingering hop presence as well. The meat of the flavor profile is a sweet, fruity, alcohol driven blend. Not a bad beer. But not one I'd buy for that price again. Aging might do wonders for this beer.","Bighuge","Apr 24, 2003"
