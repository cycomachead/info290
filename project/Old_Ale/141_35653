4.54,16.1,4.5,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.5,"Certainly a very good to excellent barrel aged brown ale. Fantastic oaky nose and taste! I was half-way through my glass before realizing I was getting tipsy---11%!? Very smooth and drinkable so be slow with it. 4.5 out of 5.  Much better than other beers with more hype and brewery induced exclusivity.  Just because a brewer limits production, doesn't necessarily make it better beer...","Murphious","Mar 15, 2015"
4.19,7.2,4,4.25,4.25,3.75,4.25,"o: A really pleasing version of Old Brown Dog, dangerously easy to drink given the very high ABV.  Probably worth cellaring some for six months to a year.","scotorum","Mar 14, 2015"
