3.61,0.8,3.5,3.75,3.5,4,3.5,"Interesting beer, pushing the lines of wine and beer a bit closer. The malt profile of this beer really lend well to the wine elements. Without knowing what went into this beer I'd think it was a really grapey and earthy double esb.","rawfish","Apr 09, 2013"

3.43,-4.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Pours blood red in color with a finger of off-white head. A weird combination of smoke (maybe the char from the oak?) and grape. Heavily toasted malts with some sweet caramel and fruit coming through. Sweet with a decent grape character but fairly watery. A touch of toast along with the dark fruit character.","womencantsail","May 18, 2012"

Smell is of malt, fruit, and wood. Taste is of malt, brown sugar, fruit, and wood. There is a woody aftertaste with each sip that lingers on the palate. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good and interesting beer in terms of the ingredients.","UCLABrewN84","Feb 15, 2012"
