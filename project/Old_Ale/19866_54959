3.45,-3.6,3.5,3.5,3.25,4,3.5,"Overall - This is a lot better than I remember it.  I just remember an acetic mess last time I had a bottle.  This has a much more controlled brett flavor with an enormous amount of molasses.","Alieniloquium","Jul 23, 2014"

3.75,4.7,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"such a strange beer here, almost like a stingo, with the tannic acidity of the wine, and a funk to it beyond what we are used to in barleywine and old ale as we know them. murky dark brown amber colored beer, thick and sludgy, but still rather carbonated by the looks of it, with a nice tall chai tea latte colored head. the nose is really barrel influenced. tons of red grape character, and if i was told this was made with must or juice, i wouldn't argue it. light acidity from the vino, lots of fruit. the grain marries in well, but this is different from almost anything I've ever had, its not sweet at all, instead super dry. carbonation is enormous too, which you almost never see in this style, but its already nothing like anything in the old ale style I've seen. burnt cherry and dark caramel and toffee flavors from the grain and wine barrel, mellow oaken middle, with a zippy and tannic finish. this must be first use barrels, or have spent eons in the barrels, its just so wine forward. its rare these days that i find a beer that challenges me like this, its always cool to find something so unfamiliar and well put together. i don't like it half as much as the saisons upright does, but i have to tip my hat and commend this beer, there is really nothing like it. i see this as post thanksgiving dinner beer, maybe i will revisit it in that context. pricey but worth checking out if you have a curious palate.","StonedTrippin","May 29, 2014"

3.6,0.6,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall, reminds me a lot of Great Divide's Hibernation, but more pricey and not quite as good. It's a little too sweet and cola like. Was surprised to see this had some brett, didn't pick that up at all.","Beaver13","Feb 09, 2014"

1.85,-48.3,2,2,2,1.5,1.5,"Pour is murky and muddy dark brown with virtually no head. Nose is heavy dark malt, molasses, caramel, brown sugar, dark berries all mixed together and not really working well as a group. Taste is brutal, overly sweet and messy. Malts sugars with burnt grain and burnt caramel, overly sweet berries with just way too much sugar. Body is full adding to the unpleasantly with virtually no carbonation.","cpetrone84",
