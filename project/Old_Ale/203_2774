3.63,-9.3,4,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a bottle named "Greene King Strong Suffolk Dark Ale" with a picture of a bull on the label. The beer is a dark, crystal clear, ruby coloring with no head. Pretty vibrant in the glass. Nose of very sweet, rich toffee, tangy caramel, sugary sweetness, fig, date, and hints of roast. Very sweet throughout. Flavors of plum, date, dark cherry, and roasted toffee, all on a bready and sugary backbone. Very slick, oily, robust bodied, with an old world fruit rich and sweet aftertaste. Rich, dark sweet linger on a slick, smooth finish. Big beer.","GarthDanielson","Jan 18, 2015"
3.71,-7.3,3,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured from a half liter while sitting in my house London.  Still working my way through so many English brews I haven't tried before moving here.  Mostly interested in seeing how this compared to Old Peculiar.  Brown...not much else to say...not much head or staying power, but could be the glass wasn't cleaned properly.  Nose...light malt with that old ale stale hop smell.  I find it odd that I'm starting to like that a little bit after smelling it in so many beers here.  Overall flavor and mouthfeel seemed to style based on the other English old ales I've had here.  Enjoyable, but probably not everyone's bag.  Pretty good beer.  I really need to do a side-by-side with Old Peculiar and will update this review if I get around to that.","captaincoffee","Jan 18, 2015"

4.18,4.5,4.5,4,4.25,4,4.25,"Overall: It’s interesting to go directly from The Bruery’s Coton to Olde Suffollk. Both beers are great examples of the style, but on completely opposite ends of the spectrum for alcohol by volume. Both have been aged to perfection. Both have a minimal contribution from hops. Both have rich dark cherry and brown sugar flavors, but one clocks in at 14.5% and the other is 6.0%. It’s enlightening to see that these Old Ale flavors can develop, regardless of the alcohol. I guess you could call Olde Suffolk a “sessionalbe” Old Ale (4.25/5).","mhaugo","Apr 18, 2014"

Despite the odd flavors of this ale, and the way it isn't quite like anything I have tasted in an old ale or otherwise (the closest was a 3 year old Cooper's Vintage Ale), I sipped it greedily till the bottle was fully drained into my glass and my glass was almost empty. From this, I conclude that this is a tasty ale that should be regarded with respect considering its unusual aspects. If you have the chance, try it.","allforbetterbeer","Oct 11, 2011"

This one is a blend of stock ale that's been aged for 2 years along with a fresh batch. Aroma of dried fruit, oak, wet hay, tannins, and a hint of alcohol is very complex, yet pleasant. After a few sips, the dominant caramel sweetness gives way to a more roasted toffee like character. For a supposed heavy-bodied beer, the finish is somewhat dry, probably from the higher than expected carbonation level. If I had a library adorned with leather & rich mahogany, I'd probably dabble with this style more often (in a snifter of course). Unexpectedly delicious.

It's a good malty beer, it tastes like caramel and bready malt, toffee, nuts, and some oak. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating with low carbonation.

The blend of two ales must be the key with this one cause there is a fresh hoppy taste followed directly by a strong smooth burst. Almost finishes like a whiskey or a dry wine, I can't quite put my finger on it but it works well. This beer is a bit pricey for my liking but it worth every penny to enjoy once in a while.","kinger","Jul 29, 2008"

Somehow, despite all my gut-feeling hesitations about this beer, I am really enjoying it. I think that this is because there is still quite a breadth of flavor here (despite the guessed at filtration).

For the most part, a sour citrusy taste dominates with oak in the background from start to finish with flashes of many other elements such as caramel, grain, vanilla, and dried fruit. Not sure if I cought it all as it seems with every sip I catch something else in a flash. The mouthfeel is a little thinner than what I would expect with a beer of this compexity but I like the moderate carbonation. Overall I have to put the drinkability just a little above average because, while it's a complex and interesting beer that I would have again if offered, the sour citric quality leaves an odd character to it that for just doesn't quite meld well with the other flavors... definitely worth a try though as I can see how someone else might rate this one much higher than I have.","PCaravan","Dec 15, 2006"

The smell was very interesting, and also unexpected. Very wine-like. It actually had a fruity / grape smell. There was a substantial amount of roasted malt in the background, clearly identifiable, but the wine - grape - alcohol smell was easily noticeable and right up front. Peculiar. The taste was reminiscent of wine, as well. Malty for but a moment when you take a sip, then turning tart and very wine like. Odd indeed as I have never had an ale with these characteristics, though I have read of them. Mouthfeel seemed light and was much more carbonated than I was expecting.

This beer pours from a brown bottle a dark brown with ruby being evident with a decent head. Smell is malty and vinous. Taste is definitely vinous to some extent, malt is a strong part of the taste, notes of oak are also apparent. This is the second one I've had, I liked it more the first time, they were labeled differently, this is a review of Olde Suffolk, last time I had the Strong Suffolk. I'm not sure if there is any difference between the two, or if any differences could be attributed to how the beer was cared for or just my mood.

Of all, i disliked the mouthfeel most. There was some carbonation, but it was a little thin. I would have liked and expected a bit more fullness.

Shy balsamic cherries initially surprises until they are reached by mellower red grapes reminiding of a tart red wine. Added to the yeasty hints, this was like a liquid raisin bread with an interesting dark malt profile (roasted chocolate, nuts). Unfortunately, it didnt really hold up in the taste department where its more meaty rather than richly bready and desserty and just far less complex and developping. Theres this unique fruit tartness thing going on under an apple clothe, but it heads nowhere. Flavor evolution made me think of a cone without a summit.

It topped off at a half finger, which quickly faded to a soapy residue. Did not lace. The nose on this ale is wonderful; great potency initially, the aroma, at its best, is literally mouthwatering. The strength does die a little in time. The bouquet is wine-like upfront, followed by oak, light but noticeable raw alcohol (like brandy), malts, and a hint of buttery-cream. The palate is not as biting or raw as some Old Ales; this could be an attribute of the blending of the two ales (see the back of the label) or I have an older bottle. Anyway it is very unique tasting, malty upfront but that is quickly followed by a mellow woody-winey-creamy taste then a kiss of alcohol follows; the finish is divine, seriously. Figs and fruit, subtle sweetness, distant and suppressed hops (aged?), a kiss of wood, a note of dry bitterness. Yeah, it is that damn good. The carbonation is light but appropriate, medium-full body, all in all, a very respectable mouthfeel. A tremendous quaff, something to savor, I would love to drink this on a regular basis. I snagged a couple bottles of this fine brew in Des Moines for $3.50 each. I wish I bought more. Recommended. Seek it out.","bditty187","Nov 21, 2003"

Theres a fine carbonation one the tongue and the feel is quite smooth on the palate. Sweet malt starts with some dark fruitiness. Vinous notes come through quite well along with a woody/oak flavor.

The roast character is not overpowering and seems well placed in the beer. The blend of the fresh beer definately adds a youth to the final beer that makes it enjoyable. A bit more flavoring hops would make this beer stand out, but that might not be to style.","bobes","Aug 16, 2003"
4,0,4,4,4,4,4,"Sampled at From The Vine monthly beer tasting Aug 4th, 2003: Pours a dark amber-brown with a medium beige head and thin lacing. Aroma of smoke, caramel and malt. Smooth drinking with a nice caramel/maple and malt character. There is also a nice spiced aspect to the flavor that offsets the sweetness. The finish is semi-sweet fruit and malt. Good stuff.","Dogbrick","Aug 06, 2003"
4.45,11.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I really enjoyed this beer and mix of flavors, gets better as it warms, complexity and balanced seemed right on.","fattychubs","Jul 14, 2003"
4.15,3.8,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"It's dark amber with a solid thick coating atop. A strong malty aroma is very pleasant and full of caramel notes. Flavors are dominated by malts at first and it's wonderfully toasty and sweet. Hops come through just enough for an awesome finish. This stuff is friggin awesome, kind of similar to some Scotch Ales I have tried, but smoother.","AudioGilz","Jun 03, 2003"
4.25,6.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Thin, small-bubbled head. The beer very dark and murky... cloudy and dark brown. Smells like honey and woods. Not too sweet. I really like the oaken flavor. It really tastes and feels well-aged. Smooth, with a little bite. No lingering sweet aftertaste. wonderful beer.","dwarbi","May 19, 2003"
4.32,8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Very buttery on the palate - smooth, oily, hints of diacetyl but not from Ringwood. Then the flavors expand - coffee, chocolate, bitter hop, molasses, and a certain hardness that I can't put my finger on. Undercurrents of alcohol are also present. Finishes with a molasses and toffelike flavor that works well. Simply unbeatable with a well-aged cheddar. Very drinkable, as I keep trying to nurse another sip out of my empty glass. Very complex, eminently drinkable brew - three of these, a fire in the fireplace, and a hunk of 5 year old Balderson's cheddar would be an evening fit for a king.","sponberg","Apr 27, 2003"
4.42,10.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"You can smell the alcoholic grains right away, even as it pours out. Has a strong musty bread aroma, yeasty but perhaps more like a burgundy or whiskey. Has some molasses, citrus fruit, and wood-like notes. The taste echos the smell, very complex and multi layered. Its smooth and mellow with a nice fruity dryness that speaks volumes of fresh grains, lets see, had sweet caramel maltyness, some molasses, fresh bread, flour, citrus fruits, small woody and hop notes dance around helping balance out the citrus and alcohol. It has a wine-like feel in the finish and feel, sweet citrusy and dry. Highly drinkable with its complex smell and flavor you'd expect it to knock you on your ass. But its so mellow and smooth. It reminded me sort of a dry lemonade spiked with whiskey. It became more drinkable and dry as it warmed, I liked it a little more when it was colder, but had to drink slowly when it was cold. Packs a good punch when cold.","tavernjef","Mar 23, 2003"
4.05,1.3,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Drinkability...with the nice flavor and a little alcohol warmth...I could drink many of these","stegmakk","Mar 19, 2003"
4.67,16.8,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"It poured thick and the color was a clear reddish brown, with a tan head and nice lace on the glass. When first smelled, I got a french vanilla and candy aroma. The taste of chocolate, molasses and roasted malts, with a hint of yeast. This is a smooth ale, with a little bitterness in the end to balance out his fine beer. As it warms up I started getting a different flavor, like french vanilla and other complex flavors. What a pleasant surpise to find this beer. Everytime I take a sip, the flavor changed as this beer warms up.","BeerManDan","Feb 25, 2003"
3.23,-19.3,3,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Comments: Unfortunately the aroma ruined the enjoyment of this beer for me.","Denali","Feb 18, 2003"
4.73,18.3,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Absolutely brilliant deep mahogany/ruby colorperhaps even lovelier than the gem itself. Magnificent malty and fruity aroma. Complex flavors consisting of a deliciously hefty malt backbone, huge fruity grape, plum, raisin and toasted caramel. Hops are only for balance, though some faint piney notes can be detected. Alcohol gently warms the body and soul. Mouthfeel is medium-full, carbonation is low-moderate. Mmmmgrape juice burps. This brew is a unique blend of 2 year old oak conditioned and new ales. Incredible beer, an automatic classic. A must try, seek this out.","John","Jan 29, 2003"
4.35,8.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The taste develops as the beer warms. Nice caramel and bread flavors, with a winelike acidity biting the tongue slightly, or perhaps it is the tannins from the oak vats. Nonetheless, this is a very mellow and smooth beer, that has a very nice body behind it. A real winner if you can find it in your area.","brakspear","Jan 29, 2003"
4.15,3.8,4,4,4,3.5,5,"Pours out a deep, dark brown color, under a full, lush cocoa-colored head. Generously aromatic, issuing hints of nuts, coffee, cream, toffee, butter. Malt is very prominent, hops take the backseat. Taste is smooth and delicious, with a slightly oily palate. Body is thick, rich, texture is very nice, and the finish continues the sweet, candyish flavors found initially in the nose,and they rest leisurely on the tastebuds. Puts me in mind of a brown ale, but done right, with flavor. Perfectly balanced, perfectly enjoyable, a tasty treat. A good ale with dinner, or in lieu of dessert.","feloniousmonk","Jan 26, 2003"
4.12,3,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Deep ruby in color with a thin, tan head. First aroma open opening is sherry-like with a medium-strong alcohol nose. As it sits, the malt comes to dominate with hints of molasses, a bit of cinamon-like spiciness, and a noticeable tartness. The flavor starts smooth and malty, but then quickly develops some spicy hop notes. A very light fruitness as though from an English pale ale is detectable mid-palate, but soon yields to a re-assertive spiciness as the finish develops with a moderate hop bitterness and a roasty malt character which lingers on to the aftertaste. Medium-full in body with a slightly dry finish, but *very* well-balanced. Quite pleasant.","mzwolinski","Jan 20, 2003"
3.84,-4,5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"The palate is much better than the nose (yeah, I tasted it during the sour milk nose too). There is rich bready licorice, and molasses. Although this was initially served at cellar temp (today 55F) it got better and more complex as it warmed. The finish is long and winey, and there seems to be some tannins giving structure. An interesting brew that I'll try again to see if that sour milk thing was an abberation.","Realale","Jan 03, 2003"
3.88,-3,4,3.5,4,5,3.5,"A deep brownish ruby color when held up to to the light in a glass. Smell of faint oak. I taste a hint of caramel with a sweet aftertaste that remains a while. The most noticeable thing I get is the mouthfeel with a syrupy coating. It will cause you to sip the beer rather than gulp it. There is some biting alcohol presence if you allow the beer to sit still on your tongue for a bit. I let the beer warm up some because it seemed so subtle but it didn't change too much. A subtle beer other than the mouthfeel.","mjohn27603","Dec 21, 2002"

4,0,4,4,4,4,4,"Smashing! Dark and lacy without much head. Malty black currant nose. Caramel and light chocolate balanced with some mossy hop. An odd style, nonetheless tasty. Indeed, quite tasty.","inebrius","Aug 26, 2002"
4.38,9.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Very dark ruby-brown color, nice 1/2 inch head that holds an elevated "ring" inside the pint glass. Dank aroma, a little molasses. Nice roasty flavors that persist to the swallow. Coffee flavors, a little raisin, and chocolate. Some sense of grape, as well. Nice complex malt flavor. A blend of an "Old" Ale with a new batch, this brew reminds me of the blended beers of "yore"...very nice stuff.","ADR","Aug 15, 2002"
4.35,8.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"an awesome little english strong ale, an excellent blend between, malt and hops, medium body with a dry finish, i like it a lot.","rastaman","Jun 02, 2002"
4.32,8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Solid beer. Dark with a brownish-tan head. Smells of roasted chocolate and caramel, hints of coffee. Very unique taste, all of it good and just sweet enough. Definatly a keeper.","packetknife","Apr 28, 2002"
4.48,12,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Nice reddish brown color with light brown head with reddish hues.  Aroma is very enticing.  Really unique flavor with quite a bit of complexity...  every sip seems to bring out different flavors.  Hint of sourness in the finish.  Very easily drinkable. Didn't know what to expect when I opened the bottle, but I was pleasantly surprised.","jreitman","Apr 11, 2002"
4.72,18,4,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Wow did this beer surprise me. I expected a pale english style ale. The color is a dark caramel with a thin light tan head, that quickly evaporates. The smell is simialer to a stout or dopplebock and its appearance is too. The first tast is a strong heavy roasted caramel that finishes with a crisp hop flavor. This is the most complex beer I have ever tasted, and it is very very good ! Nice warming finish from the alcohol. I would keep this one for special occasions.","StevieW","Mar 27, 2002"
4.12,3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Poures a deep brown with some ruby-like tint to it with almost no head to it,very nice aroma of oak and caramel with some brown sugar.A real sipping brew here to savor the different flavors some big oaky notes along with some brown sugar and caramel with this,an almost cola-like flavor as well, as it warms the oak comes thru even more.A real nice old, ale here one to savor.","oberon","Mar 01, 2002"
4.45,11.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This is a quality, unique ale.  Pours dark brown with a tan head that leaves a nice lace.  Loads of flavors packed into a relatively light beer.  It's winey, oaky, with a tad of sourness.  Finishes easy.  Makes you want another.","pbrian","Feb 14, 2002"
