Flavor fades on palate in time leaving me ready to place that joy producing elixir right back on there as soon as possible. I will fight those urges and make this wonderful glass of beer last. And I'm going to buy some more. Worth the price I paid.","garymuchow","Sep 10, 2013"

4.23,6.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"It's a very complex, drinkable, moderate strength (but still pleasantly warming) beer that (except for the unfortunate slight metallic finish) is a joy to experience.","7ate9","Jul 13, 2012"
4.17,5,4,4.5,4.5,2.5,4,"Pours a thin slightly murky dark root beer color that is headless. Tons of dark overly ripe fruits dominate the aroma with plenty of age (sherry notes) and some booziness comprise a great nose. First sip is surprisingly good and tasty. Similar to what the nose indicted, the taste is full of those lovely dark overly ripe fruits like plums and figs. It starts super sweet but quickly finishes with a bitter twist that really captures my attention sip after sip after sip. Though thin bodied and lacking some carbonation - I donâ€™t care as this puppy has plenty to offer.","ATLbeerDog",
