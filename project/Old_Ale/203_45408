3.58,-3.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a copper-amber with short but dense head.  Smell is malt and the typical fuggles/EKG wet cardboard hops.  Taste is a tad sweet, but has malt and a touch of hops to balance it out, although it feels a bit off on the balance and mouthfeel to me.  Funk on the finish, which would seem out of place if it wasn't an old ale oak-aged blend.  Overall, pretty good, but not great.  Would be worth a side-by-side with Old Peculiar and Olde Suffolk to compare apples to apples.","captaincoffee","Dec 12, 2014"
