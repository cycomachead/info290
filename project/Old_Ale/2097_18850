A huge note of brandy and honey soaked raisins right away, followed by some burnt brownie, dark chocolate covered raisin, a little bit of tobacco and some rye bread. Finishes sweet and malty with a slight dryness from the alcohol. Mouthfeel is near perfect. Slick but well carbed, which hides the alcohol ridiculously well. Top notch.","notchucknorris","Feb 01, 2015"
