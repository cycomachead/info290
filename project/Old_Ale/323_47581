4.91,16.6,4.75,5,5,4.75,4.75,"According to the label, it was bottled in 2011.  Poured a nice inky black, but with very little head.  The taste was exceptional and smooth, with the scotch present the whole time but never overpowering.  Though the head was slight, it did lace the glass nicely as I drank it.  Overall, a wonderful experience.","MacGyver88","Feb 17, 2015"
