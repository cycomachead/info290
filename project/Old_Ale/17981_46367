The flavors mesh together perfectly hitting both the sweet and bitter taste buds equally.  Alcohol content is present to the tongue but for a 10% beer it's well masked by the other big flavors which is ok, I think this beer was intend to be a sipper.  Nice drinkability, I like this one a lot.  Really cellarable I've had it fresh and aged and both are awesome.  Another impressive brew from Cigar City.","AndyAvalanche","Dec 11, 2014"

4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"This poured with a very rich color of chocolate brown with a thin layer of tight knit foam. The nose was strong with barley malt and sweet chocolate with a underpinning of dried fruit. The flavor was a barley bomb with huge amounts of dry yet sweet barley malts. The sweetness eased into chocolate with a soft prune finish. The feel was slick and full with almost no carbonation. Very good barley wine, maybe not BCBW but really good.","KYGunner","Jan 25, 2014"

Smell is of malt, brown sugar, candied fruit, citrus zest, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with dark fruit and caramel flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of toasty bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and sticky mouthfeel.

It's slightly bready with some toffee and cherry. The flavors are initially very sweet with plenty of cherry, biscuity malt, molasses, sorghum, toffee, and is has an earthy and yeasty finish. It drinks somewhere in between an old ale and aged barleywine. There is definitely a good amount of sugar. It drinks light and a little sticky. There isn't any alcohol presence at all. This is a nice beer to share but drinking an entire bottle by yourself would be a challenge. If you like barleywines this is definitely up your alley.

The flavor is similar, but is verging on being too sweet. Caramel candy overtakes some of the toffee flavors. The tropical fruit comes through more clearly in the flavor along with the prune, dark fruit notes. As it warms, it takes on a bit of a Robitussin type taste, but not really in a bad way. Interesting. Mouthfeel is nice and full with pleasant carbonation. Not too hot, very nice and warming and very smooth as well.

The smell of the beer was a little spicy and to me was very inviting. The taste of the beer was very nice, spices colliding with some sweet malts that create a nice warming effect.

Interestingly enough, while this beer is a lot darker and a lot sweeter, I see the similarity in flavor profile between this beer and Lil’ Warmer Double IPA that was made from the second runnings of this beer. For drinking fresh and enjoying the hops, I would seriously like to see the sweetness toned down in this beer; as it is though, it will likely age quite interestingly for a long time (assuming it doesn’t turn into a bottle bomb from all the available residual sugar). I had been forewarned about the excessive sweetness so was ready for it, additionally I was in the mood for something sweet tonight and this has certainly fit the bill; I could actually see myself really not enjoying this beer if I hadn’t known beforehand about the ample sweetness, but as it is, I am quite enjoying this beer.

The palate opens big and sweet with honey, caramel, toffee and an earthy bitterness, leafy and petrichor-like. Full in body with low carbonation, this is solid.

I'm curious if this was better fresh, when the citrus was more present - I can imagine it creating a sort of Terry's Chocolate Orange vibe.

Light roasted malt with hints of chocolate and coffee followed by the piney and tropical fruit hop characteristics. The rest of the flavor is rounded out with candied oranges, fig, and booze soaked prunes. The feel is big, heavy and chewy. Very sweet overall and sticky. A touch of bitterness pops through in the finish. Not a spicy winter warmer, but a sweet one. The Old Ale label seems to be spot on.

Full-bodied, bottom heavy and once it gets into your mouth only moves when prodded. Apricot, red cherry, raisin, fig, pear fruit spiced up by nutmeg, clove, allspice and a touch of cumin, cola nut and vanilla bean present and accounted for. The brown sugar element has a somewhat caramelized, cooked quality to it. Plenty of downy fluff in the carbonation, lacks the muscles to lift things up into the air.

Very slowly settles to a quarter inch with thick lacing down the glass. Smell: loads of caramel, dates, and a little raisin. Soft and sweet tropical fruit, mild pineapple and candied citrus, resinous, leafy note. Taste: seriously sweet and syrupy upfront but with loads of hop flavor and bitterness. As with 2010 still overly sweet, but this year’s balances out much more. Upfront a blast of brown sugar, non-maple syrup, orange and pineapple juice. Mint and anise notes mid sip. Orange citrus and a little tropical fruit softness throughout. Syrupy upfront but with enough carbonation to push it to creamy. Much better than 2010, but still too sweet.

There are a lot of powerful, strong notes that don't seem to meld together, really.

Slightly vinous with hints of dark fruit, mostly grape, plum and raisin. Very complex but a bit unbalanced with possibly to prominent of a dry piny hop character. This will probably open up nicely as it ages and the hops fade, allowing the other flavors to shine through.

There is a noticeable alcohol character on the front end which is not surprising at 10% but it mellows as the sip progresses. Has a nice rich sweetness that is on the heavier side but not in a bad way. The roasted malt character is even slighter in the taste as it is overpowered by the sweetness. This one is hard for me to pinpoint the flavors in the sweet character, but overall this a very enjoyable beer. Nice to try a Winter Warmer that is different than others.","ugaterrapin","0"
4.42,14.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"D - This is a well made beer that thoroughly succeeds in its role as a winter warmer. The malt character is excellent, it compares well to the best English and American examples of the style with a complex blend of dark sugar and roasted/caramel malts. The hops balance well and the strong fruity character is an unusual twist on what I would normally expect in this sort of beer. The fruit character works, especially in the aroma, nevertheless I can't help but think that a more traditional pine or earthy hop character might have made for a more balanced and subtle flavor profile. I enjoyed this beer and I would be really interested to see how one would mellow and age for next year.","nickfl","Dec 22, 2009"
