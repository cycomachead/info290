3.46,-10.6,4,3,3.75,4,3,"Couldnt taste any hopps.  Was hoping for more from their description.  But it was strong and had (warming) qualities.      Very bready with strong alcohol.  No head, wasnt expecting one.  If the hopps came through i would be crazy happy.","KillerJigger","Jan 23, 2015"
4.15,7.2,4.25,4.25,4.25,3.75,4,"Pours a clear, red/brown color.  One inch head of an off-white color.  Great retention and great lacing.  Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, slight yeast,  caramel malt, hops, hint of pine, and a hint of wood.  Fits the style of an Old Ale.  Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of sweet malt, yeast, alcohol, hint of roasted malt, slight hops, caramel malt, and a hint of wood.  Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, blend, and decent complexity.","Tone","Jan 19, 2015"
