3.59,-0.3,4,3,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Pours a deep bronze color  with lacy half finger off white head atop.The aromas are pretty lackluster with some faint green apple and brown sugar noticed.Obviously malt driven wich it should be for the style.Some malty fruity notes on the palate with some"cakiness",as it warm I pick some nuttiness even more so in the finish.The first of many holiday beers I am sure of this season,not bad but it lacks a little.","oberon","Jul 13, 2014"
