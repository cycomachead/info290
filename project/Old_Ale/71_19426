4.26,1.7,3.75,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,"This was the 2010.  Purchased at Fuller's Brewery along with a few others.  Poured amber brown with cream head.  Was a little more carbonated than expected.  Sweet caramel malts on the nose with just a whiff of that of that old ale funk.  Really full mouthfeel with lots of mincemeat/stonefruit and dark malt.  Really surprised at the flavor at "only" 8.5%.  Tastes like an even bigger beer.  Well done.  Will taste the other 2010 I have in a couple years to see how it changes further.","captaincoffee","Feb 10, 2015"

However, this past Christmas, I opened and shared a bottle of Fuller's Vintage Ale from 1999 and DAMN was that tasty. 15 years out and still kickin'.","nohops4me","Feb 03, 2015"

4.21,0.5,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Overall, a pretty good beer and worth getting when you can. I would highly advise to get two in order to age one since the notes taste like it will become even richer with a bit more aging.","HattedClassic","Feb 01, 2015"
