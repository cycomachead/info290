Either it isn't quite my thing or it needs far more aging.","ryannosaurus","Nov 13, 2014"

3.75,0.3,,,,,,"On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. As part of a Widmer/Cigar City barrel aged set. Smooth & tasty. All buttery on the nose & tongue. Less corn than the bourbon barrel. The ABV & price will keep this in check but it is definitely one for the books & bucket list.","seedyone","Jun 21, 2014"
4.25,13.6,,,,,,"Superior in every way to the rye whiskey aged version, which appears to have taken all of the nice, sharp edges off of this brew. Which is excellent. Wonder which side of the fence the bourbon version will fall on?","maximum12","May 29, 2014"
