True, its wine counterpart may have a better flavor, but I find it incredible that beer can even taste or make you feel this way...

Nose reveals dark fruit, toffee, some oxidation, sugary notes, leather and a suggestion of plastic as the brew warms. Taste - well, it's past it's prime.

4.07,17,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"2007 vintage. Well, if this were a true prize-winner, rather than something prized by the creator, would it compare to the massive achievement of Pabst's blue ribbon way back when? Let's see: This stuff pours a slightly brackish sienna topped by a finger or so of glowing off-khaki foam. The nose comprises red wine grapes, oak-y toffee, a hint of walnut, a breeze of earthy greens, a sprig of spearmint, and a strain of vanilla through the back. The taste brings in more of the same, though the grapes, still lightly tart, are forced to a more background role (though not exactly in the background itself) in favor of a sweeter, richer, slightly buttery-er toffee. In fact, a general sweetness pervades until those grapes force a tannic tartness through and help dissipate everything in a cloud. There's also a sense of spiciness in there as well, one composed mainly of cinnamon and brown sugar, but it's mostly muted, and so doesn't really clash with everything else, fading instead with that aforementioned cloud. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and an ever-so-slightly vinous feel. Overall, a lovely, complex beer. I wish I had a fresh one to compare it to, but I'm prepared to say that the past five years have been quite good to this beer. I look forward to future engagements with various incarnations...","TMoney2591","Dec 01, 2012"
3.38,-2.9,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"500 ml bottle into snifter, 2007 vintage best before 12/18/2010.

Aromas of huge prune, raisin, fig, toast, red wine, molasses, caramel, chocolate, bread, earth, tobacco, and light herbal. Pretty nice aromas with good complexity and balance. Taste of raisin, cherry, prune, red wine, toast, molasses, caramel, roasted malt, chocolate, earth, tobacco, wood, light cardboard, and herbal. Moderate wine-like earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark fruit, toast, roasted malt, chocolate, earth, tobacco, cardboard, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Pretty nice flavor balance with good complexity; fair amount of oxidation noticed; slight cloying flavors noticed after the finish. Light carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, syrupy, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is decent. Alcohol is fairly well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a pretty solid old ale. Some good flavor complexity with decent balance; though a bit cloying, it was quite smooth to sip on. This was fairly enjoyable.","superspak","Nov 27, 2012"

The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some brown sugar. However, it tastes mostly like slightly tart dark fruit. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and has good carbonation. I think this is a solid brew. Nothing impressive about it, but it's certainly not bad either.

Dare I say it? Too complex? OK, let's do this... raisins, plums, figs, brown sugar, caramel, a sourness akin to limes or lemon zest, alcohol, wood and dried apricots. Dominated by sweet malts but lacking in enough hops to balance it. A monster of an ale! As I came to the end of the my glass the dark fruit really came through. The mouthfeel was watery and syrupy (due to the lack of carbonation), and the body medium/full. A unique experience but intense, very much (too much) like drinking a sherry or a port.

Hops all but disappear with a little aging, but the malt and rogue yeast make up for their absence. An excellent candidate for cellaring and vertical tastings. A four year old bottle stored in a less than ideal setting shows a huge Bretty pineapple profile along with some light acid development, but the structure and depth of dark fruitiness is still spot on with no sign of oxidation.

It tasted like sour cherry and brown sugar, with earthy toffee and a bit of musty raisin and plastic. It was watery with some carbonation, and had a bitter / sour aftertaste. Overall this had great scent and a nicely aged taste. I tried a Gale's before that was oxidized, so this was much better! It was surprisingly carbonated, but also a bit thin for my taste. It was also more sour than expected, but it still hid the alcohol pretty well, so it wasn't difficult to drink.

Poured from the bottle into a mini snifter, beer is a deep amber brown with no head, just some bubbles on top from the pour. As I swirl the beer around the snifter it leaves small dots of lacing on the glass. The nose is very complex, a mix of fruity, spicy, earthy and oaky tones. Black licorice or anise also comes to mind. The taste falls a little short for me, while sharing some of the complexities of the nose, the flavor is reminiscent of watered down whiskey and is also watery on the mouthfeel and dead on carbonation. There is also a drying, acrid presence. Drinkability of this one is lowered by the fact that I don't really enjoy this old ale.

As I drank it, it started to grow on me, but I was still confused by the description (made it sound like the greatest thing since sliced bread). In my experience in England, if you went into a pub and they poured you something this sour, they would assume the keg had "gone off" and would have promptly dumped your pint and given you another... so, as a sour, I think it's fine. Will I buy some more - no. I scored it with a middling level of confusion over the beer type. If it were categorized as a sour I would score it higher.","aeroguy","Jun 14, 2009"

Quickly coats the palate with browned apple flesh, tart cherries, and toffee, before giving way to a finish of ethanol and vinegar. A little improvement as the beer warms, but not much. Mouthfeel is too thin and watery for an Old Ale, and the increased bubbliness and dry finish work against the drinkability.

I kept going back to smelling this drink and then taking a nice pull with a good chewy mouthfeel and though 9% ABV I'd say I could have another so drinkability is quite good.

After that some sweet malts come through along with some more dark fruits, grain, alcohol and a note of bitterness to finish things off. Mouth-feel is medium to full-bodied, and there's very little carbonation present, as evidenced by the aforementioned lack of head.

There's also a good amount of malt which, while not adding much sweetness, provides a silky caramel addition. A little cherry-raisin fruitiness comes through at the end.

Notes of brandied fruit, soy, raisins, and a little bit of toffee. I'm not enamored of the mouthfeel. Absolutely no carbonation and too thin in the body makes this a little bit of a chore to drink.

Flavors supported the aromas, but added caramel, malts, dark fruits, figs and dates, and a strong (fusal) alcohol flavor. The feel was heavy on the palate with a mildly oily texture.

Theres plenty of sweet (but not cloying) flavour elements of malts, caramel, raisins, plum pudding, spices and old sherry. Just enough hops to stand up to the sweetness.

Cheesey and black-strap molasses aromas, solvent alcohol, dusty English noble hops, carob, and a small amount of dark berry notes. Overall, pretty pungent smelling. I'm allowing it to breathe and warm for a bit, it's not like I'm losing any carbonation. First sip purveyed a viscous mouthfeel and a subtle mineral saltiness. It struggles like there was some Fuggles and other nobles in there at one point, but the alphas are long gone, other than some residual grapeskin-like vinousness. What's left is a potent snifter of fusel alcohol-laden funkiness. A very intruiging brew, it comes across at times as having cheese-like and wine-like qualities to it.

This beer is slightly oxidized in flavor, but this adds a certain richness to the beer. This is a nice sipping brew, with some notes akin to a Flemish Sour ale; slight vinegar, rich maltiness, sour, and balsamic. This grows on me more and more as I sip it.

Full, and warming sensation throughout the taste. Finish has an alcohol bite, with a slight hop bitterness. Theres a molasses-like undertone in the taste as well.

3.06,-12.1,2.5,4,3,2.5,2.5," Taste is flat, no carbonation whatsoever. Slightly sweet, with some tart fruitiness-black raspberries is my perception. Ethanol is very much in evidence. I could not have finished this one if it were a 12 oz serving. Finishes like a wood smoked Port wine. Be careful with this one. The alcohol may not be as evident in the taste as in the aroma, but it will quickly alert your brain cells. Another disapointment from Gale's. I won't blame the fall of the British Empire on this one, but I've had much better. Maybe, I'm just getting the wrong vintage at the wrong time. Or, I just don't like ales that look and taste like wine.","merlin48","Feb 18, 2004"

The flavors were almost shery like, little carbonation, more like a flat oxidized wine than an old ale. Some oak and spice flavors with middle of the road alcohol flavors. I had hoped for more.

3.96,13.8,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Vintage 1998 9.2oz bottle - Color is a deep muddy brown with super nice dark ruby highlights within, medium sized soft spongy beige head that sits a while before misting away, lace is fast dripping in sheets with minimal stickage. Aroma is light of mostly ethonalic alcohol and phenolic cleaners with some notes of pruney fruityness ans a bit of sweet oakyness. Kinda vinous with a kick. Taste has the flavors derived in the smell with a bit more liking, quite vinous with a sweet oakyness, a bit tartly too. Prunes, and sweet green raisins make the mold of sweetening along with a milding grab of sourness. Most of the alcohol noted in the nose barley make any appearance within the taste really. Good feel, medium to full with a mild yet lively character. Not a bad beer at all, a bit weird compared to some of the same style, but drinkable and interestingly good.","tavernjef","Jan 07, 2004"

Prominent malt, but nary a hop to be heard from, and a long, lingering finish. Halfway in, this messy monster starts to tame, and feels almost mellow, but that is to laugh. Alcohol content comes through, then, too, and does it's warming business, not to mention other effects. A perfect winter warm-up, an excellent tonic against late-December chill. This time, I felt that the cute little Gale's 9.3 oz bottle was a mistake, and I could take a bit more of the stuff, for the glass emptied before I wanted it to. Gets darkier and fruitier toward the end, while that 9% tip-toes up to the cranium to do it's dirty work. A choice sledgehammer indeed to send me off to dreamland!","feloniousmonk","Dec 28, 2003"
3.3,-5.2,4,4,4,2,1.5,"Deep burgundy color lacking carbonation, head, or lacing, obviously. The cork was extracted in good condition. Intense vinous aroma -- incredibly port-like with caramel (tawny port), grapes, alcohol and a slight bit of black licorice. Burnt chocolate, caramel, port and corky/oaky flavors persist. Additional notes of overripe fruit and residual malt sugars are prevalent, as well, in addition to toffee and vanilla flavors (which are imparted by the wood). Syrupy, lifeless mouthfeel is incredibly viscous and oily that it lends very little to this brew, even though it's expected. This is a definite sipper, no doubt, but it seems to be so overly complex that it cannot be enjoyed on its own. Even the usually miniscule nine-ounce bottle seems to be more than sufficient in this case. It's almost a chore to drink more than half of the bottle. This is a beer well-suited for an intense cigar, dark chocolate or other rich desserts -- it simply doesn't work by itself, at least at this point in its life (it's almost eight years old). While this particular sample stood out in some categories but not in others, its longevity is most impressive. A must try for fans of tawny port.","Jon","Dec 11, 2003"

Probably best to leave this about 5 years to let the beer mellow a bit. However, I have to admit that as a Gueuze fan, I was really quite partial to the extreme sourness the 2001 exhibited.

3.9,12.1,4,4,4,4,3.5,"I had the 1996 vintage. Very dark color. Little head, fruity, raisiny nose. Taste was completely sour - I have had a younger bottle (98, I believe) in the past that was much less sour and more malty. It tasted like a poor mans Hardy - lighter in flavor and much less complex. I happen to really enjoy sour beers, so I was not disappointed - but if you have this vintage and don't don't want it totally sour you may want to drink up soon. The 1996 vintage is probably not a good example of the Old Ale style (as tasted in 2003), which is why the score is a bit low, even though drinking this beer was very enjoyable.","ColForbin","Oct 20, 2003"

Smell: Malty, balanced by woody-fruity aromas. Taste: Incredibly complex. The sweet, caramel malty flavor is balanced by oaky, port-like flavors, hints of figs and dates, and a slight sourness with dries the beer's finish a bit, but not as sour as this beer can sometimes be. Mouthfeel is somewhat light for a Old Ale, but works quite fine with this beer. Balance makes for a very drinkable beer, despite age and complexity.","saltydog","Oct 19, 2003"

I almost sent it back until the barkeep said they're all like that. Mouthfeel is obviously watery and a little syrupy. Color is dark caramel, with a raisin smell. Flavor is mostly sour and alcoholic, but some notes of caramel and raisin emerge. It became more like sipping port or cognac, but I couldn't get my mind to totally believe that due to the sourness.

Nice full rounded feel, not slick, nor not much presence of any carbonation. Nice belly warming alcohol shot as well. A real treat.

On to the flavors: a little wood, a little rum, a little brown sugar, a little bark, a little dark fruits and a little dates and raisins. All together though, not a lot of anything real tasty.

Some earthy flavors of wood (mostly oak) and leather come across towards the middle followed by some strong notes of heavy red wine and a bit of raisiny sweetness. Quite a complex beer that is to be drunk slowly and every sip savored. I think this would do just fine if aged for a few more years.
