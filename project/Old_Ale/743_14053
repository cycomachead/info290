4,7.5,4,4,4,4,4,"The taste is raisin, rum, slight oak, pumpernickel bread, and dark cherry.  This definitely tastes a bit like a dubbel, yet I still get old ale.  Complex and dangerously drinkable.  This may be my favorite from the brewery.","tigg924","Jan 10, 2015"
3.3,-11.3,4,3.25,3.25,3.25,3.25,"Overall:  This is a pretty decent beer, but not great.  Some good malt flavors, but a little too much licorice for my liking.  However, because a portion of the proceeds of this beer goes to charity, specifically, the Wolf Sanctuary of Pennsylvania, Iâ€™ll get a few more bottles of it to support that charity.","Jeffreysan","Jan 06, 2015"

3.66,-1.6,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.5,"12 ounce bottle poured into a snifter glass. Color is very dark brown/almost black, but when held up to bright light, it shows a deep ruby, cloudy red color. Deep tan head, with little lacing. Aroma is a blend of caramel, chocolate, and some spices like cloves I believe. Taste hits with a good balance of hops and malt. The malt comes through slightly over the hops, with good heavy caramel and a slight chocolate flavor. Slight spice flavor in the background without overpowering. Crisp mouthfeel. Well balanced and pretty smooth for a warmer with a decent kick.","KWrightVT","Dec 29, 2014"

4.9,31.7,4.75,4.75,5,4.75,5,"For me this was the perfect example of a winter warmer ale.  The taste is bold and warming.  The subtle booziness doesn't overpower the flavor but you can feel it's there!  The dark color gives way to a perfect blend of spices and smoky flavors.  This may be one of my all time favorites!","JPowell712","Dec 21, 2014"
