4.45,4.5,5,5,4,4.5,4.5,"Overall, it's a world-class beer.  It's not something to drink a six pack of, maybe not even a second bottle, but each single is an amazing rendition of the style.","RickS95","Mar 25, 2015"

4.02,-5.6,4,4.5,3.75,3.5,4.25,"12oz bottle poured gently into hotel cup. Cola brown body with no head and great tan lacing. Aroma is caramel, nuts, molasses, dark fruits like plum and fig, anise, a touch of bakers chocolate. Taste initially borders on strong sweetness with chocolate, brown sugar, raisin, and maple syrup flavors. Light bitterness comes on the swallow with nutty and tobacco notes. Some smoke and band-aid flavors come late. Medium-full body, thick syrupy texture, virtually no carbonation, boozy sweet and tongue-coating finish.","SierraFlight",
