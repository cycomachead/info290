This is a fine beer, and I wouldn't be disappointed if I brewed it, but I was expecting something a little bit stranger and interesting.","allforbetterbeer","Dec 01, 2014"

4.24,9.6,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"wow, what an interesting and delicious beer. one heck of a take on holiday beer. dark dark brown in color, hardly any head, but it doesn't need one to impress me. its rich and silky looking, more like a big porter than an American old ale, with minimal light moving through. the nose is oddly smoked, much like the bestefar they make, with some honey sweetness and a huge roasty body, dark and chalky. the taste is similar, with a short lived campfire vibe for a minute before bitter dark, and finally sweet dark malt flavors come in waves. the finish is dry for the looks and style, with a sharp fusel alcohol untidiness. I like the complexity, depth, and richness of this beer an awful lot. not something I could drink a whole lot of, but I surely appreciate its uniqueness. i don't get the tartness others did, this was smooth all the way for me. in what I can only imagine to be freezing cold Norwegian winters, this is a beer I would want to have on hand. I would strongly recommend it for the holiday season here in the usa. it changes what I thought old ale could be, excellent product.","StonedTrippin","Nov 16, 2013"

It smells like dark fruit (raisins, plums, cherries), chocolate, caramel, and roasted malt. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some berries and spice. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and coating with moderate carbonation. I think this is a good overall brew, I might have to pick up another bottle soon!

There are raisins, plums, and red grapes that dance over the tongue. The mouthfeel is thick and moderately carbonated.

4.17,7.8,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"this was a winter warmer style porter quality beer with a sweetness of a aged hop quality. afterall. the hop was about a year and some old at this pine... but hopping resembled something of a tangerine citrus. nice and sweet chocolate covered citrus. palate was that but not as syrupy as expected. rather lean and quick finish of something some bright. note of tangerine, chocolate, clove, and fruit cake sugar. dessert... and simple fruit character.","rtepiak","Dec 27, 2010"
4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"I bought the Nissefar on a whim for Christmas festivities. My family is hosting for the first time ever this year, and I have been running around making everything perfect - a huge tree, decorations, real garlands, candles, yard lights, stockings, fires in the fireplace, eggnog, everything. Who gets to host xmas is a little bit of a contentious point in my family, so I felt a lot of pressure to make things perfect. I made sure to point out the origin of this beer to my Norwegian family, too much probably, but in the end they were busy making gingerbread houses and playing with my son and shopping, and Nissefar ended up turning from one of my holiday touches into my little personal moment of appreciation, and for this purpose it served admirably and lets face it, mouthfeel etc was not even a consideration.","beardtongue","Dec 24, 2010"

This is countered by the sightly roasted chocolate/caramel malt flavor resulting in a slight sweet creamy feel mid palate.

4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"D: Very respectable choice to drink by the fire on a winter evening. Excellent warming character to this beer. Not a beer to drink several of in a setting. Better suited to slowly savoring/contemplating. Could have gone for a second, perhaps.","JohnnyP3","Dec 14, 2009"
4.66,20.4,3,4.5,5,4,5,"D - Based on the apperance and the readily apparent lack of carbonation, I was expecting the worst form this beer. I was decidedly wrong. The aroma is quite nice with a well balanced collection of rich, velvety chocolate and spice character, but it only begins to hint at the flavor. The beginning is relatively light and slightly acidic with just some minor caramel flavors, but it comes to life in the finish with a wonderful depth of flavor. There is a dark, bittersweet and earthy cocoa flavor that compares in richness and intensity to only a few other beers that I have ever had. It speaks volumes about this brewery that they have created a beer that is able, at this relatively modest level of alcohol, to display flavors that I have only ever seen in over the top, extreme imperial stouts. What's more, these flavors take on a different sort of clarity and depth because of the light body and relative simplicity of this beer. I think this beer is quite an unusual achievement, or it would be for almost any other brewery, but I have come to expect nothing less than excellence from HaandBryggeriet.","nickfl","Dec 08, 2009"
4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Holiday ale or not, this one is a decent beer. Pours near opaque black, perhaps very dark brown with light tan head that is rather thick. Nose has a chocolate-whoppers candy sweetness to it. On the palate there's more dark chocolate coffee goodness with enough hops to balance it out so it's not overly sweet. Rather easy drinking for the style.","yemenmocha","Dec 05, 2009"

3.65,-5.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Light to medium body, feels a little thin. This one has its moments, but the taste is just too strange for me to want more. Not really sure what makes this a Christmas beer, and I don't think it was worth it. Interesting to try but I won't be revisiting this.","Vengeance526","Nov 28, 2009"
4.2,8.5,4,4,4,4,5,"Dark malts, sour, very low carbonation, Nissefar is probably not a beer that will make everyone's Christmas wishlist, but I think it's great. The beer pours an opaque coffee black with a very small mocha head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is in the fruity stout/porter malt range with some vanilla, oak and faint souring. The flavor is sweet and sour with a soft hop bite in the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth, like drinking a beer pre-carbonation. Nissefar is a different and enjoyable experience if you don't mind some sour in your flat porter.","popery","Nov 05, 2009"

3.15,-18.6,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"An aggressive pour yields negligible collar and spotty lacing patterns from this dark brown beverage. The smell from the bottle neck was chocolaty but from the pour a highly roasted malt and coffee aroma. The mouth is bright and tangy from a sour character. The first bit of taste flags the burnt and smokey flavor that becomes monolithic. Its equally as tart as the feel. Not my favorite.","jjayjaye","Sep 02, 2009"
4.1,5.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"500ml bottle from 8/08. Pours opaque, very dark brown with a small beige head. Strong chocolaty, dark malt on the nose, along with some dark fruit. Slightly tangy. Dark roasty taste, again with plenty of cocoa. Slight sourness that works really well here, surprisingly. Dry finish. Medium, creamy body. Really pleasant-drinking, if unconventional, porter.","philipquarles","Jul 18, 2009"

Definitely has a different character than most American Porters, and I really dig the risks they took in creating the unique flavor profile. Probably the fruitiest porter I've had yet, great balance though and a real treat. Seek this one out, it's underrated.","Bubba83","Jan 14, 2009"

3.99,3.1,3,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,"pours a hazy dark brown with some sediment in the bottom and absolutely no head and almost no carbonation. Smells strongly of European licorice, bitter chocolate, and deeply roasted grain as well as a touch of sweet malt. Interesting. The taste is quite deep and rich for an American Porter. Less licorice here, but it is still quite noticeable. There is a a fai bit of malty sweetness and some herbal bitterness and molasses. Still, the overall effect is dry, not overly sweet. Rich and delicious. The mouthfeel is smooth, but lacks carbonation and is the tiniest bit sticky as well. A little thick to drink too much of, still, quite interesting.","Georgiabeer","Dec 22, 2008"
3.63,-6.2,4.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick, rocky tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a wonderful black patent and chocolate malt scent that's dry and earthy with just a hint of sweetness. The taste is decent. It has a smooth, yet almost soda like feel. It's thick with loads of malt complexity. There is a weird tangy, bitterness to it. The mouthfeel is just above average. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. I just can't get over the thick, almost flat beer aspect. This is an interesting beer. The malt bill seems right on and the appearance rocks, but the mouthfeel really ruins it for me.","WesWes","Dec 21, 2008"
3.55,-8.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured from a 500ml bottle (Batch 169, brewed Aug. 08) and served in a snifter. This beer poured jet black with a few cola colored highlights near the edges and a thin head of bubbly, tan foam. Minimal lacing. The aroma consisted of roasted malts, baker's chocolate, and some slightly vinous dark fruits. The flavor included charred malts, chocolate covered cherries, plums, and a hint of underlying toffee. A nice, mellow roastiness lingers but is not bitter or overpowering. The mouthfeel was full-bodied and slick/oily. Light carbonation. An interesting Christmas brew. The flavor is a bit vinous and full of dark fruit, but it is also rich and malty.","mdm46410","Beers"

I just dont like the acidic finish.","nick76","Dec 07, 2008"
4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Smooth, full mouthfeel with little carbonation, although the flavors are well enough restrained that the bubbles aren't missed. I'm impressed with this take on the porter, even if it's not exactly what an American Porter is normally like.","BretSikkink","Nov 29, 2008"
3.15,-18.6,1.5,4,3,3,3,"Poured like rusty stagnant black rain water from an old pipe. Absolutely no head whatsoever even after a rather assertive pour in hopes of getting some kind of foamy cap...nothing. Immediately, I think something is amiss and suspect that there is something wrong with this bottle, until I read that many other people have said the same thing. Oh well, moving along. The smell is terrific, which really surprised me after that truly lackluster performance in the pour. Very malty with loads of sweet, toasted grains, toffee, and perhaps a pinch of spent coffee grounds. All of these are reflected in the flavour, but not with the intensity one gets in the aroma. Mouthfeel is about what you'd expect from a holiday beer boasting 7% as far as weight, however, there is ZERO carbonation. Overall, I found this rather strange. Why would a Norwegian brewey choose to replicate an American Porter for their Christmas offering? How can their other offerings be so well crafted, yet this pours into your pint glass like cold coffee with a little bit of black mushroom soil dissolved into it? Oh well... I'm still glad I got o try this one, and it isn't *terrible*, it just looks odd when you pour it. These guys can do much, much better, though!!","SilentSabre","Nov 23, 2008"
4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"How does a Norwegian Christmas beer qualify as an American Porter? Huh...well, this pours black into a Duvel tulip black with a mocha foam. Spotty network of lacing, looks nice. Cocoa, anise, pumpernickel bread in the nose. Rich and roasty taste, blackened malts, chocolate or carob, sassafras, molasses, with a mild amount of residual spice that lingers in the aftertaste. Low carbonation, sort of a smooth lactic feel. Kind of average yet well crafted, for the money i'd much rather have a sixer of Anchor OSA.","emerge077","Nov 17, 2008"

4.15,7.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Bottle conditioned, 500 ml. Very dark colour, nearly black. Large brown head. Delightful aroma of roasted malts, dark chocolate, coffee, prunes, caramel and oak. Flavour is not quite as complex but still good, bitter roasty and coffee notes combined with bittering hops dominate, on a background of dark bitter sweet chocolate, hints of English liquorice. Roasty bitter aftertaste. Anyway, this is a very fine effort from Haandbryggeriet. Not a beer for the traditional Scandinavian Christmas dinner, but try it if you have chocolate pudding for dessert - or simply enjoy it on its own!","Sigmund","0"
