Pours a clear sepia with a nice fluffy and fine-bubbled wheat head. Malty flavor has a strong cocoa overtone, which I found rather enjoyable. I detected hints of apple and caramel as well. Texture has firm body and good fizz, leaving a malty and chocolaty finish. This is a good beer for the fall, when the leaves are turning and itâ€™s time to break out the down comforter.","Cyberkedi","Nov 21, 2014"

3.48,-1.7,4.5,4.5,3,3.25,3,"Somewhat disappointing entry that I was hoping would be a nice, dessert-like beer. I think a chocolate version of the Old Tom would be a nice beer, but they need to beef these up with more malt, more body, and more flavor. Twenty years ago the British would have been busting our chops for selling watery beers. Looks like the shoe's on the other foot now, Winston! Get it together, will ya?","deadonhisfeet","Aug 21, 2014"

3.2,-9.6,,,,,,"330ml old shape bottle. Snifter glass. Slight winey & fudge chocolate aromas as cap is removed. Pours mahogany in color, cloudy appearance. Beige foam, close crown, nice retention. Roasted, herbal, brown sugar, chocolate & toffee aromas. Crispy upfront, roasted & black cocoa flavors. Medium body. Moderately high carbonation. Oily to watery texture. Slight licorice hints & herbal notes resolves in a long bitter/sweet finish. Chocolate tones on the aftertaste. Smooth drinkability.","GONZALOYANNA","May 26, 2014"
