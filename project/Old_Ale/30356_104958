Doesn't really have typical holiday spices to me, but that is not a criticism. A nice brew. Bought it at a reduced price after the 2013 holiday, and had aged in my cellar for a year.","JebBeerFish","Jan 03, 2015"

3.26,-11.9,3.5,3.75,3.25,2.5,3,"This beer has all kinds of potential. I think the Old Ale notes are quite good when they shine through and I really like the amount of oak and barrel flavor. The mouthfeel really hurts it for me and the bacteria also take away from the good aspects of the beer after a few sips. I would like to try a non-soured version of this. Just lacks a total melding of the flavors presented.","cbutova","Dec 26, 2014"
3.18,-14.1,3.75,3.25,3.25,2.75,3,"O - It has potential but it's pretty much a mess. Old ale flavors are just decent, the brett is kinda boring for brett and there's too much of it, definitely too foamy. Not bad, I assume something went haywire with the brett and/or oak barrel.","Chico1985","Dec 26, 2014"
