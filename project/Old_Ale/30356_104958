Aromas of caramel and brown sugar, a hint of oak and higher spirits, a bit of papery oxidation, and a light lactic cherry fruitiness. Light chocolate comes out especially as she warms. The flavor is sweet and dark sugary up front. Alcohol, tart cherries, tobacco, and chocolate fly in midway through. Finishes with a lingering caramel and fruity tartness.

Decent lacing, retention for a beer of this strength. Stewed berries, cocoa, brown sugar and apricots in the nose. I think there's some barrel presence, but it's kinda hard to tell what's what. Possibly some spirit and oak knocking around. It smells like sugar cookies, fruitcake and rum (that's more a function of the alcohol and fruitiness, rather than any sort of guess at the barrels used). The taste also has lots of fruit and heavy sweetness. A tad medicinal. Some definite booze. Light chocolate. Berries and apricots soaked in caramel, wine and booze. Thick feel. Never gets too sticky, though. Interesting stuff. Definitely more legitimately old ale-ish than I expected, which is fun. It's not a barleywine, and there's a whole bunch of stuff going on.
