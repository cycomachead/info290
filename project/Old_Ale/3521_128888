Flavors are roasted and sweet forward, with apple, subtle creme, tangy toffee, cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. A wee bit off-balanced. The body is robust and boozy, with a candy apple aftertaste.

4.3,10.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into snifter; no bottle dating, but is a recent release. Pours slightly hazy dark reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, raisin, cherry, fig, date, brown sugar, chocolate, nuttiness, tannic red wine, vanilla, oak, leather, tobacco, musty funk, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity/funky yeast, and oak/cocoa notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, raisin, cherry, plum, fig, date, brown sugar, chocolate, nuttiness, tannic red wine, vanilla, oak, leather, tobacco, musty funk, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast/oak earthiness. Some light earthy yeast spice and slight tannic tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, raisin, cherry, plum, fig, date, brown sugar, chocolate, nuttiness, red wine, vanilla, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/bready malt, fruity/funky yeast, and oak/cocoa flavors; with a great yeast/malt/oak balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, fairly creamy, and slightly tart/tannic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible old ale style! All around fantastic complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity/funky yeast, and oak/cocoa flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 07, 2014"

Flavor reveals a fairly sweet, buttery, nutty toffee start, which becomes dry and toasted mid palate, anchored by a cherry character reminiscent of the aftertaste of cough syrup.  Wish the medicinal finish weren't quite so pronounced. Incredible aroma. Finish is more dry than I'd prefer, but I guess that's the Brett, as I just read the description.","barczar","Oct 24, 2014"

The nose is all over the place, with stronger notes of vanilla, dark fruit (with some apple and pear) and cocoa taking control here.  The taste follows suit.  Really intense and layered, with so much malty depth.  Unpretentious despite its complexity.  A big beer at 10% ABV, but not overly boozy.  Seriously, this is one fine beer.

The beer presents a strong metallic/penny/blood flavor when cold, to the point of seeming decidedly off-flavor, but this fades and is completely gone by the time it gets to the recommended temperature.  Many beers served colder than recommended only sacrifice peak flavor.  In my experience this is a less common one, one that will be downright off, even to the point where you may be tempted to write off the beer. So let this one sit on the counter for a good 20-25 minutes if pulling from a conventional refrigerator. You will not regret it.","Nutwood","Oct 03, 2014"

I wasn't sure how it would work in an Old Ale, but I hardly noticed it at all. My only issue with this beer is that I like Old Ales to have deep, intense malt character and to display good malt complexity. There's too much going on here with all the fruit notes. The flavors, while good, tend to get muddled. I liked this beer, but I'm not sure all the added ingredients enhanced the flavor all that much. Right now, I would prefer a top-shelf, standard Old Ale (like North Coast Old Stock Ale) to this. As I continue to experience more beers, my tastes might change and I might warm to this more.","deadonhisfeet","Aug 22, 2014"
