4.29,10,4.25,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,"D: This one ended up being a pleasant surprise.  I had high hopes (as with any de Proef collaboration), but the aroma seemed a bit disjointed.  Then the taste (see above) put my concerns to rest.  It is an interesting (especially for style) and complex offering.  This one is best enjoyed on its own...a good winter sipper.  Seek it out!
