3.58,-5,2.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,4,"Look: clear dark amber, creamy head, and plenty of yeast chunks so that's never appetizing but it is probably bottle conditioned. Smell: mineral,light caramel malt, ripe stone fruit. Taste: sweet almost cloying, plummy,spicy, malty but not grainy bitter toffee and there is some hop bitterness but not overwhelming. Feel: medium high body good carbonation, low astringency. Overall : a solid old ale","Matonika","Nov 27, 2014"
