A bit more like a whiskey or brandywine, especially when the minimal carbonation stilled, it is really only the malty bready richness, smooth on the tongue, which reminds the drinker that this is still a beer. A fine sipping beer for me, but hard hitting and not very subtle in character...perhaps some dried fruit notes, molasses sweetness, but not true 'esthers' as in a barleywine, and a slightly metallic alcohol edge although the creaminess covers this...

The beer was pretty malty sweet with that hint of dark fruit and alcohol, but the taste was certainly big. As others have noted the beer felt more like a Barleywine, very heavy.

There is also a strong, sweet malt backbone as well as a little bit of resinous pine.

Not particularly a fan of the stickiness, but it comes with the flavor (more or less). Other old ales I've tried - most notably Curmudgeon - have been a little lighter in color and texture.

Aroma of bready and caramel malt, earthy with some nuttiness. Flavor is understated nutty, caramel malt up front with a big hit of alcohol and hops. Interesting spicy wood flavor middle and hop finish. Nice job. The alcohol is a little hot, but the flavor progression is good and malty. A nice old ale.","LiquidAmber","Jul 02, 2012"

4.1,8.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Very much a high alcohol barleywine reminiscient of Bigfoot under the old ale title. This is a bit hoppier than your standard old ale. Dark ruby body with a thicket of khaki tan head, this thing pours pretty viscous for the color. Aroma has big earthy piney notes with big ripened fruits, plums, raisins, and tart apples. Malt sweetness is layered between caramelized sugars and toasted malts, with interwoven layers of big ripened fruit...more raisin, plums. You could definitely lay this big bruiser down and not worry about it's aging potential, you know this thing is going to get better. Mouthfeel is full bodied a bit tamer with hop bitterness than your average Bigfoot release, finishes balanced between hops and big malts. Moderate carbonation carries things extremely well, doesn't become cloying or harsh despite the big malt/hop action going on, highly excited to try this beer...much better than any other organic offering I've come across.","WVbeergeek","Dec 20, 2011"

The flavor is pretty straightforward- sweetish, rummy malt with molasses notes stiffened up by grassy/herbal malts and a touch of alcohol sharpness. Mouthfeel is round and clean, trending dry due to the sharp hoppy aftertaste. Pretty decent, though I feel it's a tad hoppy for the style ( I was a little surprised, visiting their website, that they claim it's 100 IBUs). I must have gotten a pretty fresh bottle of the stuff- a little aging would take the edge off nicely, and at 9.7% ABV, you can let it sit for a while.

It was fairly thick with some carbonation, and had a bitter metallic aftertaste. Overall this didn't taste like I expected, with a lot more spice and hops, and a lot less malty sweetness. It still tasted clean and was enjoyable, and it hid the alcohol well, so it was pretty easy to drink. It would be nice if age would provide a more prominent maltiness, but I think there is an equal chance the flavor would simply ending up fading over the years. Who knows.

Unctuously thick nose of scotch whiskey, molten caramel, butterscotch, carob coated raisins, ginger cookies, barley, plum/prune, not crisp enough to seem toasted but it's all malt and no hops. Full-bodied, more of that alcoholic rum or whiskey action, no burn but "heady" to say the least. Caramel, toffee, molasses, all the standard descriptors, oats and barley, mulled prune juice, dates, milk chocolate, orange juice. The carbonation makes a good faith effort to rev things up but ultimately can't. So, better just relax and accept the steamroller of sweetness flattening your tongue.

In fact the hop notes get quite a bit more aggressive, with quite a sharp, herbal edge to it as the beer warms up. The malt picks up a hint of roasty character as it warms up as well, though this is pretty subtle. This ends up being a nice beer to be drinking in the colder months of the year. The rich malt plays the leading role, but it ends up being nicely balanced out by a biting hop character. Despite this balance, the beer ends up not as well integrated as I would prefer.

Even though alcohol is noticeable it's not too sharp. There is a metallic characteristic going on. Still, there's enough to it to make it be fine to sip on a 22-ouncer. I don't know that Old Ale would have come to mind, maybe a DIPA? But, it would have been in my first few guesses, I suppose. They tried to add a hoppy character to it while maintaining sweetness, I assume. Works well enough, but not to any great degree, IMO.","jwc215","Aug 19, 2008"

The taste is a malty mouthful with a certain warming alcohol that is obvious but not all that distracting. It is aqueous but it shows a nice viscosity, almost resinous, plenty of maltiness here and plenty of alcohol. This sometimes almost seems like a "malt" liquor, not Colt 45-like, but a liqeur of malt. There's a sweet Dr. Pepper quality about it and the bitterness is pretty steep, dry and perhaps herbal. It's drinkability is probably minimal due to the alcohol presence.","Durge","May 24, 2008"

Rich, thick notes of caramel candies (think "melted Sugar Daddy") balance well with brown sugars, raisin, plum, and resinous hops. Mouthfeel is on the thicker side of medium, and the body is smooth--not exactly creamy--but chewable. Finish is sweet caramels and some pine, with the alcohol note very well masked. Overall, Triple Exultation is a winner, just like Eel River's Ravens Eye Imp. Stout...they're 2 for 2 in my book. I'd definately seek this out again.","wagenvolks","May 14, 2008"

The head disapates a bit with each sip but leaving an almost perfect ring of lace on the inner surface of your glass. There is a real sweetness early as each sip rolls over your tongue. I get a real taste of candi sugar, that come to a quick halt, taken over by the alcohol burn. The alcohol while not harsh or an off flavor but is pronounced enough for me to quickly think about laying a bottle of this brew down. My bet is one will find time will be a real friend to this beer. The finish is balanced by a west coast hop finish very apparent with a lasting drying out effect, that precedes a lingering carmel aftertaste. While so far, I've found some ups and downs with Ell River beers all will be revisited to confirm my taste. This one; I will look forward to with much antisapation, perhaps 2 to 3 years down the road (from that aged bottle) when the alcohol and hops have found an even better marriage.","NJBeerguy","Feb 07, 2008"

Finishes sweet like drinking a piloncillo syrup. Mouthfeel is full, slick, and oily. This could use a decade or so to rest. Heavy handed, to say the least with no subtle nuances at all.

There are characters of burnt caramel and dried fruits with a good subdued hop base that is doing its job in the background. The alcohol certainly weighs down the beer on the tongue, it is heavy, but not so much that the beer is undrinkable, it is definitely a sipper. While I do consider this a very enjoyable beer, I can't see myself drinking it all that often, I'll stick to barley wine if I want something heavy like this beer is.","atsprings","Jan 17, 2007"

Dark sweet fruit (raisins, etc.) and a touch of toffee flavor come through mid-palate. Finish is sweet and a bit hot from the alcohol.

Fruits and carmel are added to the flavor and with the high alcohol content this is almost too rich and powerful. A bit of sweetness. Somewhat bitter finish. Interesting brew however, and should please those that like their dark beers big and bold. I opened a second bottle. I let this warm up a little to about 45 F. It again poured with a giant foamy light brown head you could have eaten with a spoon. Nose is even more intense. The flavor was much improved, and much smoother.
