4.45,7.7,5,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Rich, smoky aroma has a strong overtone of fine whisky and a hint of caramel. Pours a deep, warm sable with a thick, fine-bubbled tan head that leaves some good lacing. Smoky mocha flavor has a firm whisky note and hints of caramel and molasses. Firm-bodied texture has a good amount of tingle, and leaves a smoky, syrupy finish. Most worthy.","Cyberkedi","Dec 16, 2014"
