4.1,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 7/2011. Pours nearly opaque dark brown color with a small dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, brown sugar, raisin, peat smoke, wood, tobacco, leather, toast, light vanilla, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and deep complexity of dark/roasted malt and barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, brown sugar, raisin, peat smoke, wood, tobacco, leather, toast, dark bread, vanilla, light clove, and roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, brown sugar, raisin, peat smoke, wood, toast, tobacco, dark bread, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice flavors with deep complexity and great balance of dark/roasted malt and scotch barrel flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent barrel aged old ale. All around great complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and scotch barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","0"

Whatever the flavor version of sight unseen is. Looks like used motor oil. Very little carbonation, pitch black, syrupy and with the barest hint of a fleeting dark caramel froth. It smells of old places. Fruitcake, wood, hay, it just makes me picture an ancient house in the English countryside somewhere. The taste is fantastic. It is very subtle given the way the beer looks and pours. It is light and dark, if that makes sense. Dark chocolate, carob, wood, it manages to balance all of these really, really well. It masks the alcohol well and just is really surprisingly easily drinkable for a black, viscous brew. Mouthfeel could use carbonation. Probably not stylistically but it would break things up and add a little levity to this serious beer. Overall, really, really nice. Not as challenging as some old ales can be, with a lot going on and it manages to remain very approachable. Its like that physics professor you had in college who was so smart it drained your calculator battery when he entered the room but he managed to be so entertaining that you never forgot him.

Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, molasses, smoke, wood, whisky, and some oxidation aromas. Taste is much the same with dark roasted malt, cocoa, and whisky flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody bitterness and a very slight tang on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some complex aromas that I am enjoying slightly more than the flavor.","UCLABrewN84","May 12, 2013"

There's some streaming carbonation that is visible on the side of the glass, but there isn't a lot of it. There are aromas of dark roasted malt, oak, vanilla, and some alcoholic character from the scotch. There's some sweetness from the malt as well as the alcohol. The taste follows the nose for the most part. There's a nice malt backbone that has some dark roastiness and toffee sweetness that mingles with the oak, vanilla, and scotch. Those oak characteristics really blend nicely with the flavors. The body is medium to full with light carbonation. The beer is smooth and drinks pretty well for a bigger beer. This is an excellent beer.","acevenom","May 12, 2013"

4.08,-1.2,4,4,4,4.25,4.25,"this is a very interesting beer, superior in some ways to the 18yr, oddly. the pour is a matte black color, deep chocolate brown, fairly thick, and with only a thin finger of tan bubbles. the nose is raw cocoa and scotch, its musty and oaky, and the malt is about as black as it can be without being bitter and burnt. the alcohol smells are beautiful in this beer, the barrel has obviously done quite a bit to this. the flavor is surprisingly unsweetened. there is some vanilla and toasted coconut, but none of that is sugary. the alcohol adds flavor without burn, and it actually has a very mellow feel. dark chocolate and bran muffin are the dominant flavors in the finish, in addition to the scotch whiskey. full body and a smooth feel, maybe a little chalky, but the finish is long and complex. there is much to appreciate about this special brew, a very different tune to this than the American barrel aged beers. there is something particularly well refined about this, polished and calculated, intentional, as opposed to the sometimes random chance barrel offerings from this country. very impressive.","StonedTrippin","Feb 28, 2013"

The smoke is pretty well blended, but if it were a little more in the background I think I would give taste a higher rating. As it is, it is a beer worth a try. The base old ale is very good and the addition of the whiskey casks adds a lot of richness to the beer. Looking forward to having this one again in a few years.","wd40","Nov 10, 2012"

There is definitely some noticeable scotch flavor here without any booziness, and the fairly thin mouth makes it easier to drink. Still pretty expensive (about $9 here for an 11.2 oz bottle) but a good occasional sipping old ale.

4.2,1.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Picked this up at the biggest beer store in the UK, Beers of Europe Ltd. Bottled in Sept. 2009. Pitch black pour with two finger tan head with decent retention and lacing. Earthy, peaty, woody, whiskey notes dominate the nose. Roasty malt sweetness with lots of chocolate are also present. The first sip is intense and full of rich, peaty smoke. As it comes to temperature it really mellows out and opens up nicely. Complex roasty taste with hints of bittersweet chocolate, oak, vanilla, espresso, caramel, and just a touch of raisins, peat and whiskey. The mouthfeel is slightly oily but smooth as silk. Was really expecting a lot more alcohol burn but it was subtle at best. Drinkability is off the charts for a beer like this.

The brew was light bodied or to say thin in the viscosity department. You get a ton of peat in the nose but so the barrel did its job.

It tasted similar also, (roasted barley and burnt coffee and molasses, with a strong oak and peat finish), very dark and roasty with even more peat and burnt coffee flavors. It had a bit more carbonation, and a stronger peat and oak aftertaste with a bit of alcohol warming. Overall this was bolder and had more scotch character than the 12 year.

4.31,4.4,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"330 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Bottle No. 61520. ABV is 8.0%. Pitch black colour, big to moderate and creamy tan head. The whisky oak cask with peaty smoke and notes of tar comes through in the aroma, followed by notes of roastiness (roast malts, coffee) and chocolate. The aroma is more mellow and subdued than the 12 y.o., but still nice. The flavour has also here loads of rich malty sweetness, immediately followed by distinct notes of peaty smoke - it is again quite amazing what impact the whisky cask has. Dark chocolate in the middle. The finish has a firm bitterness from the hops and burnt malts, while the peaty smoke lasts through the long aftertaste. A truly impressive beer, but if you don't like scotch whisky at all, this might not be the beer for you. Not easy drinking (somewhat smoother than the 12 y.o., though), but a great sipping beer, and a real treat for any lover of peatiness.","Sigmund","Apr 10, 2009"

Definite dried fruit in the way of prunes or raisins. Flavor is similarly monstrous and delicious. Hops come through a lot stronger, and heavy roasted malt, dried fruit, light chocolate. Smoke and whiskey flavors. Cookies and some light brown sugar. Body is solid, almost oily at times, with mild and smooth carbonation.

Aroma of sweet malt with distinctive barley notes from scotch. Taste is a mix between some really nice creamy barley notes from the barrel and some light roasted notes from the original beer. Body is quite full with a nice creamy texture, no apparent alcohol and good carbonation. Very good overall and easily drinkable which makes this one the best in this series.","Phyl21ca","May 26, 2008"
4.13,0,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"11.2 ounce bottle, bottle #07310, September 2007. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. Aroma is roasted malt, peat, smoke, Scotch whisky and oak. The aroma is a little weak, but still nice. Taste is a little bit different than the aroma (and stronger than the aroma), it tastes like chocolate, Scotch, smoke, peat, oak/wood, dark fruit (raisins, plums) and coffee. Mouthfeel/body is medium with low/medium carbonation and a nice creamy/coating feel to it. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and goes down easy. Overall I think it's a good beer, I'd definitely buy it again even though it's pricey.","bluejacket74","May 25, 2008"
3.97,-3.9,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: Decent drinkability. A little too sweet in my opinion. ABV doesn't seem to hamper drinkability at all. Not too bad overall.","jaxon53","May 25, 2008"
4.12,-0.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Most impressive, this one is. As the lable suggests, the beer plops into the glass with a viscous, heavy appearance, rich chocolatey looking head formation that simmered to a trace before holding firm; laces well. Aromas are a fantastic display of mellow, rich, heavily toasted malts, ester-heavy grapes, plumbs, figs, dates and fruitcake. A bold rum-like aroma melds all the characteristics together. Backup notes of peat, campfire, cocoa, and a nutty coffee give much complexity. Flavors are much the same, but with a focus on the Porter / Scottish Ale notes with a hard boozy note. The tannins from the wood give a distinct nutty flavor with a mild balanced astringency and creates a moderate powdery dryness in the feel. Other textures are a fully weighted stout feel, a moderate complex bitterness, and a deep warming sensation from the alcohols. The whisky characteristics come through the flavor and aroma long into the finish. A long, lingering aftertaste keeps the beer going long after the last sip. A fantastic beer; can't wait for the 30.","BEERchitect","May 21, 2008"
4.55,10.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5," Overall, delicious. I felt like it had a unique three-phase taste, coming on like a Scotch ale, with cream porter/stout character in the middle and whiskey aftertaste. I agree with other reviewers that it could have used a little more "oomph" to be perfect, but this was very different and enjoyable. Take your time with it and savor.","busternuggz","May 14, 2008"
4.65,12.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"This is a fantastic beer. From beginning to end is an experience that is a pleasure each step of the way. It's classified as an Old Ale, but I would compare it more with a barrel aged stout. The subtle nuances of the single malt really add to the excellent qualities of the beer to make it more than the sum of its parts. If you haven't tried this yet, definitely seek it out.

4.07,-1.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Pours a thick black with some ruby highlights and a nice thick brown head. Nose is mostly whisky and malt slap. Taste follow with thick thick malty flavor and intense scotch whisky flavor. A nice peat-like flavor and some subtle smoke. A little bit of pruney fruit flavor just through the middle. The scotch provides a slight funk through the middle that I am not a gigantic fan of. Mouthfeel is very good, nice and viscous without making you chew on it. Drinkability is ok, but as low an abv, it could go down a bit smoother, although, it is after all a whisky cask brew! Overall this is a very interesting brew. Outside of beer, I prefer scotch to bourbon, but for barrel aging, I am gonna have to say that bourbon is king, at least in my opinion. A great and unique beer from harviestoun, just wish it was a little bit cheaper. Interested to see how this guy cellars, along with the 30 yr. good brew, but defenitely a sipper!","AKBelgianBeast","Apr 13, 2008"

4.35,5.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The Ola Dubh 16 pours a jet black with a thin layer of tan foam on top. Smell is of whiskey and coffee primarily, with hints of chocolate behind it. Flavor follows suit. This is an incredibly balanced brew however. Whiskey is dominant, but not overpowering. Chocolate, coffee, and hints of vanilla and oak all settle in nicely behind it. Alcohol is incredibly well hidden by the flavor of this brew. It's rich and thick, but it goes down smoothly. This is a brew that could be easy to drink, but it's better enjoyed as a sipper. I think I prefer this to the Ola Dubh 12. It's just so balanced and well-crafted.","YonderWanderer","Apr 02, 2008"
4.5,9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours inky black with a great initial head that fades to a thin ring but leaves some very nice lacing. The smell of this one is a good bit more intense than that of the 12. More pronounced single malt aromas and more vanilla from the oak, but probably less caramel and honey aromas from the malt and oak. Very nice level of peatiness- a step up from the 12, but still very nicely integrated with the malt and oak. There is a touch of vinous aroma as well- perhaps the barrels were sherry barrels before they held the whisky? Bigger flavors in the taste as well, but oh so smooth and silky. Extremely well integrated flavors with a very nice tang of peat as well as some subtle oak and the vanilla flavors that can be attributed to it as well as some sweet malt, and a hint of dark fruit and pear and a very dry finish. Silky mouthfeel with some very refined tannins on the finish. Delicious. No hotness at all, I could drink this all day.","Georgiabeer","Beers"
4.17,1,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Intriguing. Pours a dense black with minimal head (never an issue for me). An intense aroma of chocolate and whiskey. The flavor is smokey (but maybe more of an ashen smokey, in fact like a high end Scotch) and slightly boozy. It's not as complex as I anticipated, but this is one of the few beers I've had recently that made me think I need to try 2 or 3 more before I can really appreciate it. There's a pleasantly bitter (but not really hoppy aftertaste). The key question: is it worth the $9 I paid for an 11.2-ounce bottle. I think, after I've had a couple more, I'll say "yes." Then comes the next question: am I intrigued enough to try the 30 for $19 a bottle? Not sure yet. Stay tuned.","Flyer","0"
4.08,-1.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"D: I found this to be harsher, rawer, and not quite as complex as the 12.

Still excellent, though.","GbVDave","Mar 26, 2008"
4.03,-2.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This one's a pretty smooth sipper despite the larger smoke profile but it, imho, isn't as complex as the 12 and I'm definitely leaning towards the 12 when it comes to how much it satisfies my palate.

4.35,5.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer poured a dark motor oil color with very little tan head. Had descent lacing present. The aroma was of smoke and chocolate. The taste was a nice smokiness almost a BBQ type smoke to it. Had a nice hint of hops as well. The body was a bit lighter than expected with almost no carbonation. Once again a great beer for a nice cold night. I couldn't detect much difference between the 30 year and the 16 year. I didn't do a side by side.","Beerbuddha","Mar 23, 2008"
3.83,-7.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Dark black body and a foamy head formed after a cascade of bubbles made for a very Porter like appearance. A shade more brown than the 30 year cask version. The smell was mild at first but started to grow on me with the mix of roasted grains, black coffee, and tobacco. The taste was little more roasty and tannin laced than the older casked beer, and there wasn't as much of a vanilla bean character. Alcohol was warming and and soothing. Mouthfeel was quite astringent. Very well crafter beer, but the special 30 is better.","rajendra82","Mar 23, 2008"

Taste shows a bit of the rubber flavor up front, a little apple that is not quite but almost tart, then a nice smoky woody flavor blends in and lasts into the finish. Mouthfeel is medium in body, a bit of tingle on the tongue, an alcohol warmth without a bite and a dry smokey finish.

Mouthfeel is full body with a creamy carbonation level, my only criticism is that I would liked a thicker stickey mouthfeel. The drinkability is a perfect sipper with the alcohol well refined. If you love single malts scotch and beer than this beer is for you with a great influence of imperial porter mixed with the smokey peaty single malt overtones departed by the time in the scotch barrels.","sfoley333","0"
