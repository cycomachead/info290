3.97,-1.2,3.75,3,4.5,4.25,4,"It's mahogany color, only issue in the appearance is the head, which is minimal and short lived. I like how the brewer used the oak's astringency coupled with the hops and alcohol. The Fact founder's only adds oak, not oak and bourbon is also nice because the oak only adds a note to the beer's overall profile, without dominating it. It's a good beer that's fairly unique.","riverotterrob","Saturday at 03:26 AM"
