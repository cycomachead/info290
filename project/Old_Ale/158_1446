4.08,1.5,4.25,4.25,4,4,4,"Poured a rich, cloudy deep reddish brown body with a minimal lacing of tan head. Overall impression of appearance is of an Old Ale indeed, old looking and quite beautiful. Scents begins malty rich, with a massive amount of sweet burnt caramel, molasses, rich chocolate and light roasted malt and supporting notes of dried fruit, cherry and raisin mostly, and warming alcohol. Overall impression of aroma is of a very malt forward Old Ale, with rich supporting aromas lending a warming quality overall. Flavor begins malty sweet with notes of burnt caramel and toffee and nutty malt, balanced by a mild bitterness of dark chocolate and roasted malt. Middle middle opens up further chocolate and roast malt flavors, with a light smokiness and notes of dried cherries, evident, yet light warming alcohol and light notes of leather. Finish is lightly dry with flavors of roasted malt and dark chocolate mingling with notes of caramel, molasses and dried fruit and medium levels of warming alcohol. Aftertaste is lightly sweet at first, with notes of caramel, becoming gradually dry with notes of rich dark chocolate and roast malt. Overall impression of flavor is of a very old feeling Old Ale. It tastes rich, deep and malty, yet is also warming and tastes musty and old. A pleasant combination in this beer that lends it a warming, rich, satisfying quality. Mouthfeel is full bodied, chewy and rich with light carbonation and a sticky feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a fantastic Old Ale. Overall this is quite the nice Old Ale. It feels rustic and warming in all respects, as the style should feel. A malt-forward aroma and flavor are aided by warming alcohol and a thick feel to make a rich, satisfying beer.","Auraan","Mar 15, 2015"
