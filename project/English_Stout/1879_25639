3.83,-1.3,4,3.5,4,4,3.75,"Martello Stout is a no-fuss, super approachable stout that still manages to check-off all boxes for the style. English-minded and ringing in at a reasonable 4.8%, it's right in the sweet-spot for a go-to social settings pint and, I believe, is best enjoyed exactly as that.","biegaman","May 18, 2014"

3.95,1.8,,,,,,"Very smooth and easy to drink. Pours a lighter shade of black with minor bubble and just thing lacing. A nose of delicious roasted malts and espresso. Taste follows the nose but adds notes of vanilla offset by bitter cocoa. Exceptional finish with malt coffee linger.","byronic","Feb 27, 2014"

I wouldn't go as far as to say it's the best stout around, but it matches Picaroon's gold medal winning Timber Hog and Gahan's Sydney Street Stout. I'm glad it's in stock here now, it's a great, flavourful English stout.","Ivanhoes_Backpack","May 11, 2012"

4.1,5.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"O: This is a great stout. It has a balanced bitterness to malt, carbonation is well present yet does not distract from flavours. Flavours are well balanced, non competing, all complementing.","Kremlock","Jan 19, 2012"

3.82,-1.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall – A good representation of an English Stout by Garrison. As soon as I got a whiff of this brew’s aromas, I knew I was in for a flavourful stout. Appearance could use a little work (I would have preferred better head retention). One of the better Garrison offerings that I have tried.","leaddog","Dec 09, 2011"
