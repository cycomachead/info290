3.55,-1.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Overall: A sipper where the port comes through big. This is about as different a stout as I have had in a while. You must like port to enjoy this one and I do. However, the taste is a bit too strong and different for me, so this is most likely a one and done.","tigg924","Apr 03, 2009"

3.08,-14.7,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"This was a nice and complex beer. It poured into my tasting glass nice and dark brown, with hints of red highlights. It has some head, and little lacing. The smell was sweet, with some notes of fruit, and the bitterness of dark chocolate. I drank it, and it was very flavorfull and had a unique taste due to its port wine attribute.","StevenBilodeau","Jan 19, 2009"
3.15,-12.7,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"D- This beer was a one and done. Actually I don't think I finished the very end of this one. I didn't expect a whole lot with this one and it didn't surprise me. Might drink again if someone buys it.","alleykatking","Nov 28, 2008"
3.41,-5.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a three finger tan head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Totally black color, no high lights. Medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Slight roasted coffee nose. Flavor is semisweet roasted coffee. Small burnt coffee finish. Not finding any port. Halfway between a sweet and dry stout. $4.99 for a 500ml bottle from Manchester Wine and Liquors Manchester, CT. Best by 1/23/10.","jdhilt","Sep 10, 2008"

3.58,-0.8,4.5,4,4,1.5,3,"The concept interested me: a stout "enriched with port wine." Pours almost black with a generous amber head and fruity, hop-spicy nose. The mouthfeel on this one hits you before the taste--too much carbonation. It takes a while to settle down, but when it does, what emerges is an especially dry stout flavor with winy, port-like topnotes. All in all, a disappointment, though I would like to try another one, and compare it with other O'Hanlon offerings, if I can find them.","poetaster","Feb 27, 2008"

2.65,-26.6,3,3,2,2.5,3.5,"This is an english ale so the flavors tend to be more on the mild side. Hats off to O'Hanlons for crafting this beer, I just wish they would have turned it up a bit louder.","beace","Dec 26, 2007"
3.23,-10.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"Anyway, this is not an especially interesting beer and certainly does not live up to its promise.","charlzm","Dec 26, 2007"
3.04,-15.8,4,2.5,3,3,3.5,"Decently drinkable and very light. Don't think I'll buy this again, theres too many better beers out there.","t0rin0","Dec 12, 2007"

2.34,-35.2,4.5,3,2,1.5,2,"D: I bought this beer on the assumption that it would create an interesting marriage between beer and port wine, but it turned out just to be a mediocre stout. I would say to the creators that they should use more port, try a different blend, I assumed this beer would be around 8-9% before I looked at the bottle, but at 4.5% the port would have to be very understated, as port is like 17-19% alcohol, fortified with brandy. I'll finish the bottle, for sure, but I won't buy again.","Halcyondays","Oct 28, 2007"
3.81,5.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Very easy to drink and not bad as a stout, but more port character would have been welcomed, as would a touch more smokiness to give it more of an English Stout character. A nice appearance, body and smoothness but more richness in aroma and taste (with more port character) would bring this to a higher, more unique, level.","jwc215",
