3.29,-10.6,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Darker brown pour, with a small cap of tan head that mostly dissipated, spotty lacing. Basic roasty malt aroma, and not much else. In the taste, dark malts, coffee roastiness, yeasty esters, grains, earthy hops. Not too bad, but nothing really interesting going on. Body was medium, mouthfeel a bit thin, but English stouts can swing that way. Not undrinkable.","Rifugium","Oct 08, 2012"

3.7,0.5,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a near black with a small foamy off-white head. The most noteworthy aspect of the smell of this beer is roasted barley, chocolate, and caramel. It's slightly bitter, but not overwhelmingly so. Otherwise, a pretty smooth stout to drink along with a burger or steak sandwich (which, both by the way are great at this brewpub.) Leaves a fair amount of lacing on the glass. The only complaint is perhaps a slight watery taste to it -- just didn't leave me with that sense of "Wow, what a great fresh beer!" that you get at the best of breweries.","oldirtycaffrey","Apr 12, 2012"

3.94,7.1,3,4,4,4,4,"Pours nearly black, maybe some deep ruby highlights when held up to the light. Doesn't really have much of a head, so then it gets little lacing. Smell and taste are pretty good though. On the sweet side with toffee, but has a nice roast component. Medium body, low carbonation, smooth finish. Slightly bitter coffee/roast finish. Paired well with the pulled pork sandwich I got at the brewpub.","garuda","Nov 29, 2011"
