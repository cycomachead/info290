4.55,19.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Bought from the brewery right before Xmas, opened on St. Patty's Day 2015. Needed my stout fix do what the heck. Already had my corned beef and cabbage. Pours dark with nice soapy, large off white head. Smells of chocolate, some coffee espresso, and a touch of vanilla. A bit of burnt roast malt character. Tastes like a chocolate milkshake. Nice & lushy, foamy full mouthfeel. A tad sweet but okay given the chocolate character. No hops in nose or aroma, and that's fine. I don't want any hops in this kind of beer. Just enough bitterness though so it's not cloying. Overall, a fantastic beer that was fresh from the brewery and kept cold in the fridge since then. A very well made beer.","jwhancher","Feb 24, 2015"

4.15,8.6,,,,,,"The chocolate really ends a nice element to this beer.  Also, I aged this for just over a year, and I think that smoothed thing out a bit.  Certainly wouldn't call this a blockbuster, but the chocolate works well with the vanilla and light espresso.   Mouthfeel is soft, smooth and long, and drinkability is terrific. The beer is just a bit thin on the palate, but I thought that was OK, for style and for a non BA stout.  Really a very enjoyable, easy drinking stout.","John_M",
