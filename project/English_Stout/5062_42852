Its a time capsule into two-hundred years ago. However I do acknowledge that the advancements in brewing have allowed to a superior brand of Stout in today's market.","BEERchitect","May 29, 2013"

3.49,-4.6,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Dark brown, nearly black pour with just a tint of ruby. Two finger caramel-colored head with good retention and decent lacing. The nose has some solid roast with hints of cocoa, coffee, leather, and a touch of smoke. The taste follows suit with hints of coffee, dark chocolate, tobacco, cocoa, and smoke. Medium bodied with light carbonation but a bit thin for a stout. Overall, a solid English Stout, but nothing too special.","beerdrifter","Feb 17, 2013"
