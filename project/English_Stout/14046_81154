3.99,13.4,4,3.75,4,4,4.25,"clever beer this one, an oyster stout also brewed with clams. i expected a way more seafoody beer, i almost expected this to be gross, but i was so curious i had to grab it. pours like a nice rich stout, dark mocha head on a big black beer. nothing out of the ordinary there, save the high viscosity and low alcohol. the nose shows some light briny saltiness, but its less about the sea as it is about the protein added from these little critters. they add a ton of body without a ton of fishiness, not at all what i was anticipating in this one. there ids a coffee smelling side here, and its a little weird with the oceanic properties, but it comes together in the flavor, where its less of a raw bar and more of a chargrilled shellfish profile. the dark malt helps to balance, and all that protein gives the beer a slick yet large body, interesting to say the least. the finish is remarkably dry for what it is, and the beer on the whole is very good. never though clams would make a good addition, especially to this type of beer. i dont love love it, but i really admire it. more cleverness for the italians. It would be neat to see this done in a series or beers all with one accent flavor for shellfish, curry, herbs, wine, could be even more interesting in terms of food...","StonedTrippin","Dec 27, 2014"

Tastes of roast malt, salt/brine, a little pine and dark chocolate.  A briny and roast malt aftertaste with a hint of oyster.  Medium body medium carbonation","GregJ","Dec 15, 2014"
