3.68,-1.3,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.5,"Pours a dark almost black with a small quickly fading head. some light lacing. Aroma is of dark roasted malt, yeast and caramel malt, some mild notes of burnt toffee and caramel as it warms up. Taste similar to aroma with some mild espresso like bitterness from the roasted malt. A medium body with mild carbonation, smooth. Finishes with sweet roasted malt, caramel, moderately dry and some mild bitterness and light toffee caramel ending. Aroma and taste become more prevelant as it warms up. Overall a good, smooth and flavorful brew.","Samp01","Sep 16, 2013"

3.31,-11.3,4,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,"A friend brought this back from England and I got a small glass of it. Black color, standard looking stout. Aroma is roasted malts, not bad, nothing special. The flavor was good, a little dry and chalky but some good malts. Mouthfeel was a bit watery. Overall, not bad but not great. I wouldn't buy a bottle of this if given the opportunity.","ArrogantB","Nov 18, 2011"

3.2,-14.2,3,3,3.5,3,3,"500ml bottle. Pint glass. Enjoyed on decÂ´11. Pitch black with beige, large bubbled, froth. Close, quickly dissipated, crown. Yeast & toffee note aromas. Bitter upfront, slightly fizzy, followed by sweet malts & hints of coffee. Velvet palate. Light body, medium carbonation. Dry bitter finish & dark fruits on the aftertaste. A little more viscosity will be appreciated for a Stout.","GONZALOYANNA","Apr 13, 2010"

4.03,8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Excited to see a Stout with the word hop in the name because that is just the way I roll. Not so much in the hop department but a decent stout nonetheless. Pours a rich black with a lacing one finger head into my Tusker pilsner glass. Head diss spayed quickly leaving me a nice coke float with hints of chocolate and coffee subjected by the malty dark cookoff. Body of this stout is medium not too filling. Great to go along with my not quite the black keys. Will probably pick up a few more in the future as winter rolls around.","jhtipton","Oct 17, 2008"
