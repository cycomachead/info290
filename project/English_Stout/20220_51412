2.88,-17.9,3,2.5,3,3,3,"OVERALL: Nothing special. The aroma was especially weak, unfortunately. The flavor picked up the slack a little, though even there it was unmemorable. Nothing wrong with this one per se, just nothing all that right about it either. Pass and try something else.","Jeffo","Nov 02, 2014"

3,-14.5,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,"Taste is dark sweetness to start, some oatmeal in the middle, and a slight tartness to the close. Mouthfeel is kind of thin, and smooth in a flat beer way, and drinkability is okay, in the it goes down easy, but again, not in an impressive manner. This is not all it was cracked up to be.","ppoitras","Jul 26, 2012"

3.95,12.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"This is definitely worth a try, but given the price and relative heft-of-body, probably isn't a great session choice for most people. As far as OCB stouts go, this is a very respectable choice that I will probably imbibe again some time.","thehyperduck",
