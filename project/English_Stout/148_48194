4.13,5.1,4.25,4.25,4,4,4.25,"I have to admit, I set my expectations quite low for this one, just by looking at the clear bottle. Couldn't be more wrong! The beer looks pitch black with small head after the pour, though  with great retention. Nice. Smells quite interesting: the usual roasted malt and chocolate tones are supported by some kind of acidic aroma, which is reminding me of dark fruits, which I find quite pleasant. In the mouth feels very creamy with small amount of bubbles. The taste is pretty unusual for a stout. Usual coffee and a hint of chocolate are there but the backbone is still sweet, acidic, dark fruity. Lasts vey long revealing some small amount of bitterness.  Would buy this again!","RickyS","Feb 14, 2015"

4.08,3.8,4,4,4.25,3.75,4,"Poured from a bottle into a chilled glass. Malt aroma with cocoa influence.  Very pleasant. Colour is black with tan head, and I mean "no light gets through the glass" black. Taste has very little bitterness. Sweet malt flavour with a definite chocolate presence. Mouthfeel is medium-light and very smooth. A stout this sweet is a pleasant surprise.","vikinggary28","Feb 03, 2015"

3.93,0,4.5,3.25,4.5,3.25,3.75,"Pours black as a starless night.  World Class head volume, outstanding lacing and retention.  Light nose of roast and chocolate over a slight mineral note.  Heavy light body with just a hint of smooth texture.  Above average carbonation level with a bit of effervescence in the middle and finish.  The outstanding flavor profile is reasonably intense, a bit complex and very well balanced.  It begins with chocolate sweetness which is a blend of bittersweet dark and milk characteristics.  The middle has a very subtle bitterness from roast and hops over a distinct classic mineral note (think chocolate soda).  The finish is a slow fade of rich sweet chocolate with hints of vanilla.  This is an excellent choice to introduce someone to stouts.","tillmac62",
