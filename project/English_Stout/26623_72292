3.63,-5.5,,,,,,"On cask at North Bar in Leeds. Served in a half pint with half a finger of tan head topping off a black yet translucent appearance. Aroma is fairly heavily cooked barley malt with notes of bitter chocolate. While drinking the tan foam sticks to the glass. The flavor is dominantly malt with a heavily roasted malt flavor that lingers with a moderate bitter finish. The mouthfeel is a bit thin.   Overall a decent stout. Serviceable but nothing special.","deebo","Feb 19, 2014"

3.94,2.6,5,3.5,4,4,4,"On-tap. 1/2 pt glass. Enjoyed on marÂ´13. Pitch black appearance headed by a so close & creamy crown. Foam lasts until the end. Floral aromas rounded by subtle roasted notes & citric underneath. Crisp bitter upfront. Roasted malt flavors & gentle licorice touch. Full body. Moderate carbonation. Dried nut astringency reamins into a long dried & bitter finish. Citric on the aftertaste & coffee-like infusion. A big one!!","GONZALOYANNA","Sep 25, 2012"

4.12,7.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Deeply dark and tasty. Goes overboard with the roasted malt, but I rather like it. Dry, with plenty of bitter notes from the malt and hops. Aromatic hops add an interesting dimension to the flavour, though individual characteristics can't be picked out. Good body with light carbonation. The only thing that might benefit this beer would be conditioning with live yeast. Quality - well worth trying if you come across it.","jazzyjeff13","Apr 08, 2012"

4.03,4.9,3.5,3,4.5,4,4.5,"O: Excellent, one of the finest examples of this style. Tastes very similar to Elland - 1872 Porter but maybe less sweet. Not a session beer but a beer to be savoured till the last drop.","BrewSage1985","Mar 30, 2012"
