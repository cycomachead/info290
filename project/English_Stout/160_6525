3.8,2.4,,,,,,"A bottle from the lcbo, good lacing and a pleasant roasty spicy aroma, a bit vegetal. Taste is smooth, with a gentle bitterness with a really nice English hop profile, long drying finish. Pleasant drinkability, good balanced porter.","mick303","Nov 08, 2014"
4,7.8,,,,,,"This one pours as a very attractive beer. Plenty of brown foam with satisfying light roast malts flavours. Feels great swirling around the mouth. Beautiful Wychwood additional. Will look for this one again.","-steve-","Nov 08, 2014"
