This is actually a very tasty beer; an imperial English mild ale, perhaps.  But a bourbon aged stout? I don't get it.  Still, I would definitely reach for it again; it's very tasty!","Roguer","Mar 14, 2015"

3.33,-10.5,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.25,"O: So-so. A decent enough beer on it's own terms, but doesn't really fulfill expectations for a bourbon stout. Looks OK, while the aroma and flavour are quite sweet and boozy with hints of brown sugar, dried fruit, stewed leaves and woodiness. Lacklustre body - too thin. The malt character isn't beefy enough to match the aging and doesn't provide sufficient balance. The result is slightly cloying; a sort of 'light' bourbon stout. Drinkable but not memorable - no need to hunt this one down.","jazzyjeff13","Feb 02, 2015"

4.25,14.2,4,4.5,4.25,3.75,4.25,"Innis & Gunn Bourbon Aged Stoutâ€™s flavor immediately leans sweet, channeling dates, caramel, toffee, and touches of chocolate.  There are boozy touches of cooked fruit and alcohol soaked oak barrels.  The mouthfeel ends up being thick between the sugary nature and the high booze.  The elements of bourbon tend to take over toward the end, giving off burnt chocolate, caramelized sugars, and the flavor of preserved fruit.  The finish goes on for some time moving closer to bourbon as it goes.","TastyFoodAndDrink","Jan 19, 2015"
