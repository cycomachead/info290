3.28,-6.3,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Had this from a hand pumped cask at tap and table in Emmaus a while ago. The beer came out as a deep brownish black color with a thin tan head on top. The head narrowed itself down to just a thin line over the beer. The smell of earth, and roasted barley were prominent. The taste was a little less intense that most stouts. It was dry and roasted... A little watery too. The mouthfeel was light and smooth. The cask killed most if not all the carbonation here. Overall the brew was decent. It's nothing I'd go a distance for to have again.","Knapp85","Oct 07, 2009"
3.57,2,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Not the best English stout I've had; indeed far from the greats, but with just enough interest going for it to make it worthwhile.","lacqueredmouse","Aug 29, 2009"

3.59,2.6,4.5,3,3.5,4,4,"Thick midnight black with an abundant crop of camel-colored foam, weak in the nose with only basic stout aromas of coffee, chickory, coffee, and roasted nuts. Not bad but not special; as for the flavor, it is also somewhat disappointing - I've had stouts not brewed with port that have more of a port flavor (not to mention barleywines). There is a trace of sweet port, but mostly this is an ordinary (but good) stout with a textbook taste of cocoa, coffee, burnt toast, and a bit of brown sugar. Properly full and soft feel, well matched to the flavor, and dry in the finish with a lingering burnt nut aftertaste. Not the wonderful digestif I'd hoped for, but still a perfectly good stout even if it is rather gimmicky.","soulgrowl","Jul 05, 2009"

3.51,0.3,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"This beer pours a nice dark,ruby,cola colour with decent carbonation that leaves a frothy,long staying two finger head with heaps of lacing very nice looking,the aroma is just above average with hints of blueberries,dark malty port and some weak coffee,it has an average mouthfeel with tastes of dark roasted malty coated hops which finishes very smooth with no taste of port at all in fact i think the port perfectly balances out this beer to give it a very smooth finish,quite a nice beer that would buy again.","ADZA","Jan 23, 2009"

3.52,0.6,3,3.5,4,3,3,"Pours jet black with a large tan head, which holds retention well. Smells of roast and port, more notes of the latter, but no esters. Has a good roast taste with high bittering, which is a nice complement to the sweet, winey port. This has a medium full body but finishes dry due to the high hopping rates, which is a tad unexpected. Overall, an enjoyable and unique beer, but not astounding.","mrandolph","Aug 23, 2008"
4.31,23.1,5,4,4,4.5,5,"I wish more of these would cross The Pond. A subtle stout, rich but also smooth at the same time. The malts give a good roasty flavor. Recommended.","BeerSox","May 01, 2008"
3.03,-13.4,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Bottle: Poured a clear black color stout with a good size foamy head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma of dry roasted malt notes with some subtle notes of port. Taste is also an average mix between some dry roasted malt notes and some sweet port notes. Body is a bit too thin for the style in my opinion with some good carbonation. I guess this is OK but not something I would necessarily seek again.","Phyl21ca","Apr 29, 2008"
3.06,-12.6,4,3,3,3,3,"Bottle at home ...a deep black colour ... with a small tan head ... slightly sweet rum malt nose ... sweet fruity roast malts with a little alcohol ...sweet berry fruits ... low carbonation ... medium body ... its just not got the depth i look for in a stout","cgarviereg","Feb 18, 2008"
3.53,0.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Bottle at Chaucer's Pub in London, Ontario- A deep brown pour that lets in some light, is topped with a frothy mocha cap with nice retention and lacing. The aromas here are dark chocolate, black coffee, some dark fruits, cherry, a smidge of hops, but no port to speak of. Tastes strongly of black coffee mixed with dark chocolate, a bit lactic, some slightly fruity components which may be from the port. Bitter towards the end, but a bit thin in terms of a stout. Pretty good.","mrmanning","Jan 15, 2008"
3.28,-6.3,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"I am not sure what to make of this beer. As it is, it is a nice English stout. I don't detect much port character here, and so I don't really understand what the brewer is trying to accomplish by making this "enriched with ruby port." Something I would try again if I saw it though.","champ103","Jan 07, 2008"
