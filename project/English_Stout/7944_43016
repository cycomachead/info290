3.6,-3.2,3,3,3.75,4,4,"O) A nicely done ale; not even close to being a stout, and it doesn't claim to be one on the bottle, so the BA type is wrong.  This is a beer to drink slowly and appreciate.","Malt_Man","Nov 23, 2014"
3.01,-19.1,3,3.75,2.75,2.75,2.75,"Overall: Is it a stout? Is it a porter? This is a beer with an identity crisis in more ways than one. It's not that it tastes bad; I like my beers malty and this one isn't too bad albeit a little one-dimensional. I think it's trying to be two things at once and doesn't really hit the spot on either count. Compared to something like Sam Smiths Oatmeal Stout, Bad King John is looking pretty woeful. Not a drain pour because I enjoyed the taste, but I can't see me seeking this out again.","interzen","Nov 21, 2014"
