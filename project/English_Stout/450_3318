3.43,-9.7,3,2.5,4,3,3.75,"Love Stout doesn't really live up to its luscious description, but that doesn't mean it's a bad beer [I noticed on the website that draft versions of this beer are on nitro, and I can see this beer taking on a richer quality there]. As it is, this is a pretty flavorful, very drinkable stout, and I personally don't care for hoppy stouts, I'll keep this one on my radar.","Sneers","Mar 27, 2015"

2.92,-23.2,3.25,3,2.75,3,3,"Overall: This was worse than i imagined. It reminds me of Guinness Extra, which is far from a compliment. Everything about it screams weak, musty, and watery. A six pack runs $10 around me. A bomber is the same price. Thats a freakin joke! Im surprised by some of the high ratings. Glad i only got a single. Everything iv had from this brewery is average at best. Pass this one up in all seriousness.","Bone53","Mar 25, 2015"
