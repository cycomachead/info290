Yes, the chocolate tastes like one of those cheap samplers you get at the drug store-but hey that's the fruity chocolate I grew up with.  As Forrest Gump says-life is like a box of chocolates you never know what you are going to get.  This is the cheap roman raspberry chocolate piece.  But thats still pretty good.  FWIW I thought this beer was decent and my husband really likes it.","PittBeerGirl","May 14, 2014"

Apparently I need to put together a longer review. Don't know why; this beer is just bad.","ABSOLUTENUT","Nov 16, 2013"
3.14,2.3,4.25,3.25,3,3,3,"The taste is overwhelmed by the cherry or tart zestiness of a bottle of champagne for lack of a better description. Hardly what I expected from a chocolate stout. Chocolate seems more like an after thought.","puboflyons","Oct 14, 2013"

3.02,-1.6,3.75,3,3,2.75,3,"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is jet black with a thin, foamy, filmy, light tan head. Nose of toasted oats, chocolate syrup, and some hints of bitter coffee. Flavors are sweet, with the chocolate syrup heavy on the forward tongue, and some roasty notes in the back. Way too sweet and sugary for me. Thin, slick body that tries to be creamy but misses the mark. Chocolate sugar once again in the aftertaste, with a bittersweet linger in the slick finish. Not for me, but a true chocoholic might dig it.","GarthDanielson","Jun 12, 2013"
