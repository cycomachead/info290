3.55,7.9,,,,,,"O: A decent stout, and certainly more characterful than some of their other brews. Looks alright, while the aroma and flavour are replete with roasted malt and coffee notes. A solid bitterness rounds it off nicely. Body is OK but could stand to be a shade creamier. Goes down easily enough - worth sampling if you have the chance.","jazzyjeff13","Jan 13, 2013"

3.68,11.9,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Smoky aroma has notes of licorice, molasses and coffee - plus a strange, yeasty, almost plastic-like overtone, but this may be from something odd that happened to this particular batch. It pours a nice opaque sable with a fairly thick, if not too persistent, light tan head that leaves some generous lacing. Flavor has a strong smoky note plus tones of licorice, molasses and coffee and a hint of unsweet chocolate. The mysterious plastic-ish note seems to diminish as I consume the beer. Smooth texture has firm body and a good amount of fizz. Not the best stout I’ve had, but still pleasing.","Cyberkedi","Nov 23, 2011"
