4.03,3.9,4,4,4,4.25,4,"Overall: As stouts go, it's not a bad one - if you're looking for something with an insanely complex flavour profile then you're in the wrong place. However, if you're after a good, drinkable stout which is a cut above the typical Irish offerings then this is a good bet. Widely available and well worth checking out.","interzen","Jan 25, 2015"

3.92,1,4,3.75,4,3.75,4,"M&O: in general the carbonation level is executed pretty well, although the body feels at times thinner than perhaps desirably so; all in all this Double Stout has retained a moderate body and flavour profile, crafted in a way that the balance in flavour, good level of dry-ish bitterness and approachable drinkability make it a session-type stout. One pint is definitely not enough at any sitting, to me at least.","wl0307","0"
