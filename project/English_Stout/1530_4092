The body could be a shade thicker and perhaps slightly less carbonated, but it's none the worse for that. Goes down a treat - worth sampling if you come across it.","jazzyjeff13","Jun 25, 2013"

3.6,-3,3,3,4,4,3.5,"500ml bottle, bottle-conditioned. appearance - dark brown with subsiding head. smell - faint roast grain. taste - medium sweetness and bitterness, slight molasses. mouthfeel - quite chewy indicating good body, average-lively carbonation. overall - the archetypal stout, like guinness ought to be.","gutbucket2","May 24, 2013"
