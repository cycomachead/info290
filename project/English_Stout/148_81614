3.62,-0.3,,,,,,"Mouthfeel is very thin and watery, with a light body and almost no carbonation. This is a light, easy drinking session stout with limited flavor but high drinkability. It was alright overall, with its looks being the most impressive part of this brew.","CHickman","Nov 02, 2014"

4.25,17.1,,,,,,"Pours a solid pitch black in color with a good 1/2 finger creamy off-white head that actually lasts the whole drink. Pours like a Guinness, in layers from the nitro cap that is in the bottom of the can (does not move around though). A good amount of lacing is seen when sipped that sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of dark roasted malts and black coffee. Bit more going on with the taste with a hint of dark chocolate in the mix as well. Finished with the roasted malts BUT isn't strong nor harsh at all. Very smooth finish actually as I wasn't sure of how this brew would end up. Lighter+ bodied with perfect carbonation. Overall, I really liked this brew.","BeerWithMike","Sep 25, 2014"

3.75,3.3,,,,,,"Think this is much better on draft than canned. Rich roasty malt, dark chocolate notes, becoming fairly bitter and lightly charred at the finish. Nutty malt forms the backbone, and that nitro mouthfeel is rich and velvety. Only detracting quality is a lightly metallic finish.","barczar",
