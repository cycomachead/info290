2.98,15.1,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,"was stoked to try a korean stout, but this was disappointing. medium brown in color this looks a lot more like a brown ale than a stout, and its small tan head dies fast. smell and taste are the same, watery chocolate malt and a generic ale yeast with a metallic finish and moderate bitterness. long and dry as it swallows, and just way too light in body to fit the stout style in any way. a passable dark ale, but an utter failure as a stout. none of the three hite beers i had were awful, but none of them were stand out either. preferable to other asian imports, but thats about it.","StonedTrippin","Jul 25, 2013"

3.27,26.3,3.75,3,3.25,3.25,3.5,"Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours a very dark brown, appearing nearly black in the glass with a one finger tan head with decent retention and lacing. Faint aroma of toasted malt, coffee; with a slight sourness. Flavor is better than the aroma, but very attenuated. Faint dark toasted malt, hints of coffee and chocolate. Finishes very light with memories of dark malt. Light bodied, but decent carbonation. An odd little beer, for a brief moment after tasting, all the right elements of an English stout are present, although subdued, but flavor fades away to a very light finish. This tastes like a high production English stout that has been slightly watered down. It has potential if the pleasant flavors present would be more intense and with a bit more body. I suspect this would still be a locally welcome beer compared to many of the very light Asian beers. Worth a try and drinkable, but most other stouts would be a better choice. I would rate this higher compared strictly to other beers from this continent, but it is labelled as a stout and has to stand up in that company.","LiquidAmber","Dec 31, 2012"
