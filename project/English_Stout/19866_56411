I just don't think is what was intended, and certainly isn't to style. Still finished it without a problem.","macrosmatic","Jun 16, 2014"

4.01,1.8,3.75,4,4,4.25,4,"Opening medium light in body with a prominent roasty note, a grainy acidity that has flavors of coffee and cocoa, burnt caramel and a mildly briny and moderate chalky calcium flavor. The blend of chalk and brine is excellent here. Drying on the finish with a creamy dark chocolate character to go with the lingering acidity, this beer is delicious.","DefenCorps","Dec 30, 2013"
