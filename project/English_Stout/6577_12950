3.84,1.1,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"500ml bottle, bottle-conditioned. ap: almost black, long-lasting thick head. sm: roasted barley. ta: blackcurrant. mo: fairly light due to high carbonation. Ov: worthy stout, with a tang that is not sweet. Full of flavour. One of the longest-available bottle-conditioned ales in the UK.","gutbucket2","Jul 19, 2012"
3.95,3.9,4.25,3.5,4,4,4.25,"Old school. Dark but not cloying, well-attenuated, no coffee or chocolate notes - just lean black malts. A winner.","StJamesGate","Jul 12, 2012"

4.02,5.8,4.25,4,4,4,4,"Fantastic - an excellent stout with a big flavour. Decidedly malt-driven, with plenty of roasty notes and bitterness. Looks the part, and the body is well-judged. This is exactly what I imagine when I think of the perfect English stout. A sterling effort from the Titanic brewery, and well worth sampling if you come across it.","jazzyjeff13","May 27, 2010"

4.28,12.6,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Notes: Best before 09/05/11. Solid example of a nice sessionable stout. Plenty of flavor especially given the ABV and flavor. This helps put away the myth that beers need a high ABV for high flavor. Well balanced and good integration of all the typical stout flavors. Really enjoyable stout, it's unfortunate that it doesn't get exported. Definitely worth grabbing although I'm not sure if it's quite good enough to go to a lot of trouble for.","FreshHawk","Oct 22, 2006"

3.35,-11.8,4,4,3,3.5,3,"This beer pours a jet black colour with nice carbonation that leaves a one finger creamy head,it has aromas of dark roasted coffee,chocolate and blackcurrants,it has an above average mouthfeel that feels full at the start and finishes a little light with notes of roasted expresso coming thru with a watery hop finish not bad but definately no world beater by any means.","ADZA","Aug 30, 2005"
3.28,-13.7,4,3.5,3.5,2,3,"OVERALL: A nice beer, could drink a few, but there are others out there that are more impressive. I won't be looking for this again, but if I came across one by chance I wouldn't hesitate.","Jeffo","Feb 13, 2005"
4.03,6.1,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"M&D: superbly balanced on the body and smooth on the mouthfeel, yet retaining a light, even refreshing palate throughout. The sourness and bitterness are tuned to such an extent that every single element is in a harmonious state A remarkable old-fashioned stout on draught!","wl0307",
