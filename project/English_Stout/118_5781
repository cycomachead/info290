3.99,3.6,4.25,4,4,3.75,4,"Overll - this is a good stout with decent flavour and a great look and smell. Drink this beside a Guinness man and feel like a man next to the goon beside you. No offence intended to the Guinness boys but this one has real flavour. The MF lets it down slightly  and the burnt nature of the malt profile overpowers some of the other flavours but having said that I do like it.","BeerDrinkersWorldTour","Dec 02, 2014"

4.64,20.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.75,"  Overall, I'll give Dragonhead Stout - Orkney Brewery a  4.75. I thought it would have a slight astringency due to the brewery's home nation take on most beers, but this was smooth the whole way through. As a huge fan of viking/folk metal, this certainly caught my eyes at the local bottle shop. I am quite impressed with this offering by Orkney Brewery and plan on purchasing and reviewing more of their products in the near future.","Caveworm","Oct 11, 2014"
