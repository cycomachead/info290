1.7,-44.1,3,3,1,1,1.5,"Look: Very dark brown almost black color, shiny foamy head; Smell: Roasted malt, chocolate and some acidity, like radish; Taste: Roasted malt and toffee, unripe hops; Mouthfeel: Sour, high carbonation and medium body; Drinkability, very bad, i guess it's made with hops too green or not mature enough.","roddwolff","May 15, 2008"
2.97,-2.3,2.5,3,3,3,3,"Fruity and quite sour on the palate - really, venturing into Flemish territory, it's that sour. Could this have been the brewer's intent? If so, then he has odd tastes, and an odd comprehension of the style. Sour orange, unripe strawberry, a hint of prunes. Quick, sharp finish and fairly fizzy carbonation. I am not sure what to make of this beer - as a stout it can only be called a failure, but it succeeds, in a way, as a sour ale.","soulgrowl","May 10, 2008"
2.16,-28.9,2.5,1.5,2.5,2.5,2,"Not impressed with this beer overall; maybe it was the fact that it was brought back all the way from Mexico in a cargo hold before I got to drink it, but it just doesn't seem very well thought out. At least it's in a cool blue bottle!","alexw","Mar 02, 2008"

2.48,-18.4,3,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,"Drinkability: Great looking bottle, but inside is a beer that is not so great. If they hadn't watered down the malts so much, this wouldn't have been such a bad beer. One is more than enough for me! If you're a bottle collector you should consider buying just the bottle, but if you're just a beer drinker, just be careful.","AltBock","Sep 29, 2007"

2.33,-23.4,3.5,3,2,2,2,"Pours an opaque black with a head that really doesn't stick around long at all. If it did, I'd be more inclined to give a higher score. Nose is a mix between smoky, roasted qualities and dirty water. Seems to have a bit of cheap licorice candy fragrance as well. Not impressed. Flavor is just way off. So thin and watered down and just dirty in general. Lacks elegance, body, or grace. I am not even going to bother with elaborating. Feel is thin with low carbonation and still that dirty water edge. No way is this drinkable. This is going down the drain. Avoid like the plague. I bought it because it was a cool bottle. If I had read reviews beforehand, I would have avoided. Avoid, avoid, avoid.","RblWthACoz","Jan 18, 2007"
2.9,-4.6,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,"Overall - A very strange brew and not really in a good way.. possibly the weirdest stout i've ever had... maybe worth a try once...","mdagnew","Jan 15, 2007"
3.61,18.8,4.5,3.5,4,3,3,"Interesting! At the outset, you have to give credit to this brewer for venturing to make a stout in Mexico. This bottle can't be beat, I love the long neck. The smell is new to me... maybe I should have expected it, but this Mexican beer has a hint of lime to it. Also a sour yeast nose, I don't have an idea where it comes from. The taste has the same sour notes, but the addition of a roasty finish. Pretty thin both in taste and consistency, but this makes it easy to drink. This would be a great beer if it was on tap at a local bar, but it is definitely not something I would seek out.","Toddv29424","Dec 01, 2006"
3.48,14.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"500 ml blue "liqueur design" bottle, bought in Edinburgh. "Lote 00148". ABV is 4.7%. Black coloured beer, reddish brown in the highlights. Large to moderate tan head. Unusual aroma with notes of balsamic vinegar, dark fermenting fruits, ensilage, burned rubber and glue, hints of chocolate and liquorice - good and not-so-good at the same time. The flavour is moderately roasty, fruity and acidic with distinct notes of smoke, hints of liquorice. The mouthfeel is a bit thin. Very far from being the best porter in the world, but worth a try.","Sigmund","Sep 09, 2006"
1.75,-42.4,2.5,2.5,1,2,2,"Drinkability: Who knows, maybe Lot #133 is right on the money. Though, I will say that that blue bottle is the bee's knees!","ChainGangGuy","Sep 04, 2006"

3.16,3.9,4,3,3,2,4,"This is kind of like a watered down stout for people on low carb diets, but that doesn't really make sense. So essentially, it's pointless. It would be worth a try if it weren't as expensive as it is. Definitely not, as the bottle claims, 'Mexico's Finest.'","Lupin","Jul 23, 2006"
1.94,-36.2,3,1.5,2,2,2,"Nice looking cobalt bottle with a tag around the neck. Sour, off aroma as it pours a black with decent clarity and very little head. Taste is extremely one dimensional with a bit of off malt flavor and some of the sourness promised by the smell. Mouthfeel is thin; drinkability is pour. This beer is all hat, no cattle.","CH3CH2OH",
