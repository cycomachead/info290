3.3,-9.6,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.25,"330 ml. bottle. Pretty cool bottle, pours ana lmost black colour with asamll head that goes away in a minute, levaing some lace. Smell is chocolate, or rather chocolate liquor cream, I can't smell any other thing, even if chocolate is not really that pronounced. I also expected a thicker body. Taste is chocolate liquor cream, with notes of dark fruits, but again is somehow a faint one. It's really pleasant, but it could be stronger in every sense. But I'll try it again if i have the chance.","janubio","Sep 12, 2012"

3.6,-1.4,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Quite nice - the chocolate definitely comes across. The taste is more milk chocolate than cocoa, and rather sweet, but it blends nicely with the roasted malt. The weakest element is the mouthfeel, which ought to be thicker and more substantial. However, it goes down nicely enough. Worth trying.","jazzyjeff13","Aug 02, 2011"

3.58,-1.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"O: Kind of a disappointment (that's what I get for being a sucker for advertising). The chocolate flavor is there, but is lacking in depth. Overall it's pretty easy drinking, which makes it a little underwhelming.","BMoldy","Jun 06, 2011"
