3.3,-9.6,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.25,"330 ml. bottle. Pretty cool bottle, pours ana lmost black colour with asamll head that goes away in a minute, levaing some lace. Smell is chocolate, or rather chocolate liquor cream, I can't smell any other thing, even if chocolate is not really that pronounced. I also expected a thicker body. Taste is chocolate liquor cream, with notes of dark fruits, but again is somehow a faint one. It's really pleasant, but it could be stronger in every sense. But I'll try it again if i have the chance.","janubio","Mar 10, 2013"

The weakest element is the mouthfeel, which ought to be thicker and more substantial. However, it goes down nicely enough. Worth trying.","jazzyjeff13","Dec 13, 2011"

There are hint of berries and caramel, but for the most part, this beer smells and taste like a high-end dark chocolate, though it's not terribly dark, maybe 40% cocoa.

2.95,-19.2,3,3,3,2.5,3,"Bottle: Poured a clear light brown color porter with a large foamy head with OK retention and some light lacing. Aroma of dry coffee notes with light chocolate ester is pleasant. Taste is also a mix between some nutty malt with light notes of dry coffee and very subtle notes of chocolate. Body is too thin for style with good carbonation. A bit disappointed as I was expecting a lot more chocolate and a fuller body.","Phyl21ca","Jun 27, 2010"

Putting the chocolate aside, just as a stout this beer is a little lacking. There is a touch of choclate on the nose but it isn't defining. The palate is a little uneven and lacking in direction; bitterness is mild and body is light-medium. Overall, drinkable but not memorable.","juju7","Apr 26, 2010"

3.92,7.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"330ml bottle courtesy of Adil. Thanks friend! Deep murky brown in colour with bronze hues and a sliver of bubbly white head. Not much lace. Smell and taste are vanilla, milk chocolate waffers, toasted nuts, cookie dough, cream, and a smoky, charred roast to end. Pretty straightforward, but I like it. Leans more toward a porter than a stout. Medium, spicy mouthfeel, a bit light, though not watery, excellent coffee/oat chalkiness in the finish. Another BA said that you can't go wrong with chocolate beers, and this is case in point: it's unspectacular, yet so damn drinkable. There's a strong and enticing cocoa essence and the beer is remarkably balanced. A tasty, quaffable concoction. I'm now intrigued by what Meantime has to offer...","cratez","Mar 07, 2010"

3.2,-12.3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Creamy thick black body with a slight tan head and lots of carbonation. The aroma is milk chocolatey, with very sweet caramels, almost sticky sweet, a bit like the Tia Maria liqueur. Initially very sweet flavours up front, lots more chocolate, with a gradual shift towards bitterness at the end. This is a bit too sweet for me, which makes it a bit hard going. It's certainly an interesting beer and is brilliantly crafted like all Meantime beers.","PartyBear","Beers"

3.8,4.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D: A good beer that is decent as a sipping beer. But it's not fantastic and if you are willing to go up a few notches concerning ABV you can find way better chocolate stouts.

3.51,-3.8,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"OVERALL: Pretty solid stout for sure, but the taste profile doesn't quite deliver the chocolate like the nose advertises.

4.2,15.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"From a 300 ml bullet-shaped champagne-like bottle, this beer is utterly black with a thick tan head. The head is wonderfully stable and long-lived. Despite the warnings on the bottle to serve very chilled, I had the beer at slightly above cellar temperature. The aroma is enticing...immediately noticeable chocolate, accompanied by black roasted grain. There's a little malt, vanilla, and butter aromas as well. The butter isn't a diacetyl smell, but seems to go hand-in-hand with the chocolate - It also becomes more pronounced through the glass. The taste is surprisingly semi-dry and nicely bitter (I guess that I expected more sweetness). Fairly complex taste that centers on the chocolate malts and roasted/burnt grain. The mouthfeel is creamy, with a moderate carbonation and a medium fullness. It's not as thick as it could be. All in all, there's not much to dislike in this beer. It seems well put-together and is an interesting brew.","Suds","Sep 15, 2007"
3.82,4.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"D - A nice, interesting beer. Like the coffee porter it's something I'd drink on a semi-regular basis but 2 back to back would be too full on.","brendan13","Mar 31, 2007"

Distinct aroma of chocolate / cocoa, also notes of roasted malts and vanilla. The flavour is quite smooth and sweet with a very moderate roasty bitterness, again with distinct notes of chocolate / cocoa and vanilla - a bit too much for me. Still a nice "change of pace" beer.","Sigmund","Feb 04, 2007"
