4.17,11.5,4,4.5,4.5,2.5,4,"Overall a pretty good beer. The taste of this beer is what really sets it apart. It isn't really anything new or unique but the execution is just superb. The super light mouthfeel was quite offputting but otherwise a rather nice beer.","Jamesthebrit","Oct 26, 2011"

4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"Served from tap by the brewer himself into a snifter. Poured a massively dark brown with a half finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, dark chocolate, big leather, and dark fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and leather. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I was really surprised by the leather aspect that came across in this one as it was the first time I had experienced it in an American Stout where it wasn't intentional. This added a nice level of complexity to the brew on-top of the other flavors and aromas already present. Mouthfeel was a little better than most I have had in the style as most feel watered down. Worth trying if you go to the brewpub as it was quite enjoyable.","thagr81us","Jan 02, 2009"
4.18,11.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pitch black, creamy tan head that retains well. The nose is oat-riddled, caramel, sweet, and not too complex. Flavor is the same way...not necessarily complex- but delicious. Amazing for the price. Smooth and creamy feel to it-oaty finish. Highly enjoyable as well ad their IPA","scottyshades","Dec 14, 2007"
3.21,-14.2,4.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Overall impression: A serviceable stout that goes down just fine on a cool winter evening. My overall rating here is somewhat inflated by the appearance, but there's no denying it's a great-looking brew.","PDXHops","Jun 06, 2007"
3.45,-7.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Mouthfeel is a much more watery than expected, the rough edges really need some work. However it is drinkable and would offset a very sweet creamy dessert quite nicely.","czfreeman","Nov 17, 2006"
3.31,-11.5,4,3,3,3.5,4,"On draft at the brewery. Opaque pour, almost no aroma with this. Light roasted malt. Some coffee, roasted/burnt malts, very little if any chocolate. Needed just a little more of pretty much everything you expect from a stout. It was very drinkable however. Of the 3 I sampled, this was probably the best at BRBC.","Bung","Aug 04, 2006"
3.7,-1.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: Enjoyed this one decently - it wasn't anything groundbreaking or amazing, but it's a solid, drinkable, reasonably-abv%ed stout with a good array of flavors and aromas and nothing particularly wrong with it.","CrellMoset","Jul 19, 2006"
3.35,-10.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Drinkability: Solid for one of those less-than-sweet stouts.","ChainGangGuy","Jun 24, 2006"
