1.3,-65.3,2.5,1.25,1,2,1.25,"This is a very bad example of a barrel aged beer.  Flavors are muted under lageresque type corniness in the beer.  Not sure what it is, but another poor example of beer making by lost rhino.  I should have known not to even give this a try due to the dust covered bottles on the shelf when I bought this.","4thelvofbeer","Jan 01, 2015"
4,6.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall:  This is a good stout, boarding on very good.  Great flavors of malt and some coffee and sweetness.  The only hang up I have, and it’s not really a hang up, but a comment, is that the beer is labeled as a barrel-aged stout, bourbon barrel-aged actually, but I don’t get much bourbon flavors or any wood.  Still, it’s a very good stout, and had it not been labeled as a bourbon barrel-aged stout, which makes the drinker anticipate certain flavors that this beer lacks, I would have rated it much higher than I have.","Jeffreysan","Dec 20, 2014"

3.77,0.5,4.25,3.5,3.75,3.75,4,"O - I enjoy the bourbon barrel aging, but it can easily be overdone and overwhelm the beer flavors.  Some I've had taste like someone just poured a shot into a stout  This beer seemed to have about the right amount of aging flavor.  The barrel aging dominated, but wasn't too much.","VirginiaBeerMan","Nov 06, 2014"

3,-20,,,,,,"Draft pour at Mekong.  Dark black mahogany color.  Very little head so wondering how old the keg is.  Smell roasted coffee and oak with a hint of Tennessee whiskey.  Tastes of chocolate with coffee and I want to say rye. Lightly oily in the mouth.  Goes down smooth but has an odd after taste.  You get a wash back of coffee and roasted malts buried under slight whiskey.  I don't taste a strong ABV here.  Mild for stout, but it is an English stout.  Russians make it almost burn.  I'm not a fan of the after taste.  I think they used whiskey barrels instead of bourbon barrels.  I prefer bourbon.","uvachief","May 17, 2014"
