4.08,29.1,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall: very good quality Australian version of the English Stout. Used to be 4.9%, but now for some reason is 4.4%, tastes a bit more like a very strong-flavoured English Mild rather than a Stout. Still very tasty though, and I assume Carlton did it to bring the prices down when the Aussie Gov't decided to charge more the higher the ABV.","SmashPants","Oct 07, 2010"
3.3,4.4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"O/D - Nothing special yet not bad for a macro dark ale or whatever style it's intention is. A tad sweet, but otherwise I wouldn't have a problem drinking this over Carlton's other offerings.","tbeckett","Aug 12, 2009"
3.31,4.7,4,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,"O - Not sure about the categorization as English Stout but it is surprisingly good. It is very basic really but it works. I cant think of anything better from CUB.","dansmcd","Mar 13, 2009"
2.74,-13.3,4,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Not a bad drop from the world’s worst brewer. Mild, dry porter. Inoffensive style and somewhat lighert in palate weight than the beer (I think) is trying to emulate (Tooheys Old). Excellent colour - its actually black! Surprisngly easy to drink as a quaffer.","Stew41","Dec 09, 2008"

3.04,-3.8,2.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Like I said: it's not unpleasant. That's pretty decent praise for a brewery which comes up with some of the most diabolical beers on earth. While it certainly is lacking, it has some pleasant characters, and I'd certainly rather down a pint of this than of Carlton Draught or VB.","lacqueredmouse","Apr 24, 2008"
3.39,7.3,4.5,3,3,4,4,"I am truly in shock! Fosters Group actually makes a good beer! I'd be happy to drink this any time - it's hard to believe that this comes from the same company that makes Carlton Draught and VB.","LittleCreature","Sep 11, 2006"
3.12,-1.3,3,3.5,3,3,3,"Quite drinkable but I felt it was lacking. Not something I'd actively seek out but OK every now and again.","madvoice","Jul 29, 2006"

3.03,-4.1,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Would I drink it again? yep, but only if I am in the mood...the final sweetness left after the swallow just seemed a little artificial & syrupy for my general liking.","WHROO","Apr 12, 2006"
3.7,17.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Overall - Tastes a bit like a dumbed down porter, but enjoyable nonetheless. A good beer from one of the most boring breweries in the world.","Cs1987","Feb 04, 2006"
3.35,6,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Not much bitterness... I think the term Mild is best applied here. This beer is, basically, mild & inoffensive.","vancurly","Jan 18, 2006"

3.38,7,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"As far as I know this is my first English Stout to date. Poured into a Stella Artois chalice a black color, with a little bit of brown towards the bottom of the glass and a small white lace head. Not much in the nose department besides maybe a bit of burnt coffee and some smoke characters. Taste was decent, with coffee, light chocolate all up front and a roasted background. Mouthfeel was light to medium bodied, with a surprising amount of hop bitterness right up until the end. Being on the light side made it a pretty easy beer to drink. Not a beer with a myriad of complexities or anything groundbreaking, but it is still an easy drinking beer. Not bad, not great, still probably worth a try.","jamie2dope","Nov 01, 2005"
3.49,10.4,3.5,2,4,4,4,"Pours a very deep dark ruby color with some tan head that's really not as creamy as I'm used to with stouts or 'black ales'.. There really isn't much aroma to this beer at all, I think I smell a faint faint hint of chocolate malt, but I can't be sure. The taste is pretty mellow for a stout, but looking at the bottle, they're not claiming it's a stout, just a 'black ale' and for that, it tastes good. Balanced flavor with some chocolate notes to it. Not a whole lot of bitterness, but there's a little hop flavor on the back end. Mouthfeel is very creamy, not much carbonation at all. All in all, it's a very drinkable beer, the flavor is not overly strong, but it is there and it's good, which is more than most macro beers have.","Kulrak",
