3.98,2.1,3.75,4.5,3.75,3.75,4,"Deceptive indeed, as well as very tasty. Certainly played up the chipotle spice but the chocolate is revving at full force as well. I find this a tasty beer, but couldn't have it very often. As an interesting beer it really captures that mayan spiced hot chocolate feel, with a really satisfying spiciness to it, smoky, earthy, and bittersweet. Quite nice and enjoyable.","mick303","Feb 20, 2015"

3.78,-3.1,4.25,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Jet black with a ring of eggshell-tan head with good lace. Smell is a big chocolate and cocoa powder upfront, touch of peppery spice that gives a bit of a nostril tingle, not a ton going on but certainly delivers on being a chocolate-chipotle stout. Taste is all chocolate initially, milk chocolate and hershey syrup, chipotle is subtle initially but is a little more noticeable as it warms and shows up in the finish, roast and a touch of sweetness from all that chocolate. Medium-light carbonation, light-medium body. Not bad to have once in a while but not something I could drink on a regular basis, still quite drinkable.","peensteen","Feb 14, 2015"

3.77,-3.3,3.75,4.25,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Pours black under minimal creaminess coating the surface and leaving behind strings of lace here and there.  Smell is immediately chocolaty followed by vanilla and a little pepper.   Flavor follows suit with an increased chili pepper note, though it never gets spicy.  Roasted malt, cocoa, nuts, and some fruity yeast.  Less intensely chocolaty than the smell, closer to more of a standard stout with a pepper twist.  Medium bodied with some tingly carbonation and lingering bitterness. Not bad.","wedge","Feb 06, 2015"

4.05,3.8,3.75,4.25,4,4,4,"The nose is heavy milk chocolate, a little earthy green pepper, lots of lactose and roasted malt.   This smells amazing.  The flavor is similar, lots of chocolate, earthy dryness, bitter hops and just a bit of heat.  The heat from the pepper plays well with the chocolate.  This is pretty balanced and the flavors pair well.  Really enjoyable finish too.","nmann08","Jan 30, 2015"

3.87,-0.8,4.5,4.25,3.5,3.75,4,"This pitch black brew with a small tan head has a complex and interesting aroma.  You can smell the chocolate and chipotle.  The flavor is powerful and refreshing but this is not a style of beer that I am an aficionado of.  If chocolate flavored beer is a must then this is a must.  if you are feeling adventurous I would try it also.  It isn't bad, in fact I enjoyed the more I drank of it (go figure)","ordybill","Jan 19, 2015"

3.79,-2.8,3.75,3.5,4,3.75,3.75,"Average looking pour, but really nice fine lace. Lots of chocolate on the nose and to taste. Charcoal and a bit of smoke. Nice roastiness, bittersweet. The chipolte is not big and in your face, but it gives the beer a wonderfully odd note that is quite enjoyable. Creamy, lingering finish and a tingle from the pepper as you go along. Fun and interesting, a tasty brew, but basically a one off I think.","TerryW","Jan 18, 2015"
