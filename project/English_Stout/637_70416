3.85,16.3,4,4,3.75,3.5,4,"Maybe I am under the influence of some odd spell cast when I opened the bottle, but I feel that this is an underrated brew. "Belgian stout" should perhaps be a separate style designation, at least for splitters such as myself. Maybe this could use a few rougher edges to add complexity and character? In any event, might be worth a second look if you hated it on the first pass.","CalgaryFMC","Feb 22, 2015"
