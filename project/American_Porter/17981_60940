Smells of chocolate, breadymalt malts and roasted coffee. The taste is all that, but so much bigger. Dark chocolate, roasted, smokey coffee and a nice hoppy bitterness on the end. Several have compared it to a black IPA, but it's definitely a porter first-and-foremost. Medium thick mouth that's fairly oily. I really, really like this one.","MartzMimic","Jan 27, 2015"

3.69,-9.1,4,3.75,3.5,4,3.75,"My initial, heavy handed pour resulted in a pseudo-cascade which created three fingers od dense, deep-brown head with great retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown (SRM = 44) with garnet highlights. Nose smelled more of dark things - tar, charcoal, tobacco, dark chocolate, dried dark fruits, leather than of hops, but the proof of the pudding is in the tasting. My first sip filled my mouth with a big, thick dollop of dark chocolate pudding. No, I mean, beer, but it was like a Jell-O pudding cup and I thought about inviting Bill Cosby over to share this with him. It had a bitterness, to be sure, but it went more towards enhancing the coffee-like inherent bitterness than making it "American" in terms of its hops. I was reminded of the fact that I am not a fan of Black IPAs for almost the same reason. The dark malts get in the way of the hops, almost wasting the hops, as opposed to showcasing them. This was not quite as much of a turn-off for me, but I have also had Porters that I enjoyed much more. The finish was dry and bitter, but whether due to the malts, to the hops or a combination thereof, I could not discern. If they decide to CAN this beer, I will revisit it, but otherwise, this was a one-and-done.","woodychandler","Feb 07, 2014"

Some hints of chocolate, cherries, malt, and a little smokiness. Taste is interesting, bittersweet chocolate and heavy on the dried fruits. Finishes with smoke, charcoal, and raisin. Nice flavor but definitely not a classic porter in the sense. Mouthfeel is thin and light bodied, very little carbonation. Soft on the palate. Overall another excellent CCB offering.

I like that it maintains all the trappings of a dark beer that drinks and feels like an IPA, but without coming off as an ABA/CDA/IBA, etc. As for the relatively low appearance score, it may be that I poured this on the cold side and, for what it’s worth, I seem to weigh appearance much more heavily than most people, but it’s still not a bad looking beer. I just can’t get enough head, in most cases (har har, I know . . . ). Definitely worth trying, if you like porters and / or hoppy dark beers.","fmccormi","Oct 27, 2012"
4.58,12.8,4.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Detectable yeast with complex and balanced esters, earthy and assertive hops, spot-on chocolate, coffee and roasted barley notes that are far and away from the blunt and deragotory shouting of flavours (sadly) in most American-brewed porters. Hazed opaque, deep, deeeep brown colour with reddish tints towards the glass's edges, rather than a flat black all the way through. Instant classic in my book, tastes REAL in a way that's hard to pin, just nothing is off, or excessive or blunt. The beer is a whole being, ingredients playing together really well. I loved this last year, but never reviewed it, and I think I may have fallen for it even harder this release. A must-try for Porter fans, and one of CCB's best brews, in my opinion (FL native here, too)!","IcarusComplex","Oct 26, 2012"

Medium bodied with a little higher carb than preferred for the style and a hint of dryness on the finish (which is nice). A good beer from my standpoint.

A small tan head forms and spreads out to the sides of the glass leaving a nice lace around the brim of the glass. This beer smells of coffee and sweet chocolate. I gather small notes of char, like this is a smoked porter. Taste is hoppy, grassy, with an after taste of chocolate and coffee. The taste doesn't seem to be quite in line with the smell. Mouthful is on the thin side and beer seems to be well carbonated. Overall another good beer from CCB. This porter ranks in between the 1st and 2nd tier of its class.","brian44556","Jul 03, 2011"

A similar vanilla sweetness to the nose and a some goof hop bitterness which works well with everything else going on here. Mouthfeel is full, super creamy and velvety, just spot on.

Toasty malt and dark chocolate dominate the nose with only light traces of piney hops, mocha, toast and alcohol. The taste is led by bitter chocolate up front with some semi-sweet and toasted malt and caramel on the midpalate. For being labeled an India Porter, the hops are pretty light. The dry finish is even more bitter chocolate and mild coffee notes with very little alcohol presence. Medium-to-light bodied with slightly high carbonation for the style. The dry finish also has a very slight alcohol warming effect. Pretty drinkable for an 8% porter though the dryness and bitterness wear a bit on the palette.

Head settles rather slowly and clings to the side of the glass. Good lace. Nice rich aroma of roast, dark chocolate, tobacco, and leather. Some sweetness in the nose as well. Rich mouthfeel, medium. The taste has several nice transitions starting with a sweet chocolate taste that moves to bitter leather and dark chocolate. Lingering bitterness. I like the taste but would rather not have the lingering bitterness. I guess it is suppose to be aggressively hopped though. Much hoppier than most porters I have had. I'm glad the hop taste was on purpose because I definitely would have knocked it for that had I not known. Pretty good but I do rather enjoy my porters a tad less hoppy.","kbutler1","Oct 01, 2010"
3.88,-4.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This stuff goes down easy with minimal burn and high drinkability. Just about every dark beer that I have ever had from Cigar City was a knockout and I hope they keep pumping them out like this. I really enjoyed this different style of beer and would say that if you can get some go for it, because I know that I will be trying to trade for more soon. This is what I would call a perfect fall beer and easy enough to drink more than one unlike some of those belly busters out there now. Thumbs up in my book,","Bmoyer0301","Oct 01, 2010"

4.22,3.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Cigar City has my vote for one of the most interesting breweries in the country right now. Jose Marti isn't really a go-to porter, but it IS unique, tasty and another feather in the cap of the the white-hot guys from Tampa.","kkipple","Sep 28, 2010"

4.42,8.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"D - This is a really excellent porter. The malt character is both complex and smooth while the significant hop presence balances things out and also provides an unusual character for a beer of this style. I am especially enjoying the lingering spicy coffee flavor that comes in the aftertaste as it shows the best of the beer's smooth, but robust character. More nice work from Cigar City, this is the best of several porters that they have put out recently.","nickfl","Sep 22, 2010"
3.91,-3.7,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall, I'm excited to see CCB bottling more brews in 6 packs. Seems like Jose Marti might need a little work to achieve greatness, but this really is a solid porter with an interesting twist. Wait and watch for my review of the Maduro Brown they put out. That brew blew me away.","TKEbeerman","Sep 21, 2010"

4.64,14.3,4,5,5,4,4,"D: Another amazing beer from Cigar City. This beer in many ways is similar to Stone's Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale but with more of a malty body and thicker mouthfeel.","rmolledo","Sep 19, 2010"

4,-1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Streaming a DVD quality version of Iron Man 2 online while drinking this little surprise I found 2 the store tonight. Dark, rich and the lightest bitter on the back of the tongue Well crafted American Porter from Cigar City. Even my girlfriend liked it. Coffee in the nose and makes up much of the taste, but is very well balanced between the 8% ABV and the rich malts. Yum. And a reasonable price for CCB. Just over $10 with tax.","blivingston1985","Sep 14, 2010"

4,-1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"D - Pretty drinkable. A nice porter but nothing that blows me away. Provides a lot more chocolate flavor than most with a mix of milk and dark chocolate notes. I enjoyed this and would drink it again but doubt I'd seek it out.","jpmclaug","Sep 08, 2010"
3.92,-3.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"O: I enjoyed this beer. Well brewed with no major defects. I would have liked some more smoothness / carbonation. I would pair this beer with my morning eggs and bacon.","adkirkish","Sep 04, 2010"
