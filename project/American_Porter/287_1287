Medium bodied with a nice slick texture that approaches creamy.  Above average carbonation with effervescence from the middle on. The flavor profile is of average intensity, a bit complex and is masterfully balanced.  It begins with a blend of roast, dark fruit and dark chocolate that reveal themselves in that order.  The roast lingers to the middle where it meets a mild hop bitterness.  The finish is a slow fade of roast and hop bitterness over a slightly sweet note.  A good laid back porter, but not outstanding.","tillmac62","Dec 04, 2014"

Taste is mostly malty with elements of coffee. Finish is slightly bitter and hoppy. The feel is perhaps my favorite attribute; although it is a dark beer, it has a deceptively light, creamy and lively carbonation which lends itself to a crisp and refreshing taste normally associated with lighter beers. I had this beer with chocolate and it was a great pairing. Overall a nice example of porter.","Gajo74","Nov 18, 2014"

4.03,4.4,4,4,4,4.25,4,"Very dark brown, almost black in color with a soft tan head.  Good retention throughout the duration of the beer.  Pleasant, mild aroma of dark chocolate and roasted malts.  Flavor is much of the same with roasted malts and a hint of chocolate to round it out.  Medium bodied with a slight bitter finish and goes down easy.  Very solid porter here.  Not too heavy, not too light.  I picked this one up in NY but if Bell's distributed in NJ this would be something I would purchase regularly.","Jacobob10","Nov 11, 2014"

3.92,1.6,4,3.75,4,3.75,4,"Pours a very dark brown, bordering on black. A light tan head caps it, dissipating quickly to a thin layer that leaves some soapy lacing. The aroma is nice, a little restrained, but hitting all the right notes, with rich roasted notes, mild earthy hops, and some nice coffee tones. The taste is just a little more forward, incorporating all the aroma elements and superbly blending them. No one aspect dominates at any point. The body is a little thinner and there is a slight carbonation tingle on the finish.","delta490","Nov 08, 2014"

Some acids courtesy of coffee, toasted barley, and a bit of smoked peet. Mid-palate it is coffee, some cocoa, and a lingering tartness. The back palate is all malt and biscuits with some lingering coffee notes. Fairly dry, but still very drinkable. Like a good cup of Arabica. Aftertaste is all coffee and toasted barley. 4 out of 5. Very good. Recommended.","digitalflood","Oct 22, 2014"

Aromas of big chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, toffee, coffee beans, toast, light dark fruit, cream, and herbal hops. Very nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of milk chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, toffee, toast, light coffee, earth, and herbal hops. Lingering notes of milk chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, toffee, and herbal hops on the finish for a bit. Nice balance and robustness of flavors; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, slick, and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice porter. Nice balance of nicely robust roasted flavors; very smooth to drink. Very enjoyable and sessionable porter.","superspak","Nov 03, 2012"

Scent of caramel, roasted malt, and milk chocolate. Taste follows the nose very well - with additional notes of a lighter coffee and a hint of what seems like chicory. Really a fantastically balanced porter, and while there is nothing standout spectacular about this brew - in my opinion it is *the* baseline for what a porter should taste like, and that is definitely a remarkable accomplishment.","srv33","Jul 29, 2012"

The appearance is textbook, not too much of an opaque overachiever, with a head that lasts as long as one would like. Appealing flavor qualities spend too much time fighting with acidity and questionable synergies, at one point tasting a bit too much like unscented hand soap. Its fine, and it manages to thread the needle of porter status; it just leaves the drinker wondering if it couldn't be even better.","beagle75","Feb 02, 2012"

I'm not totally sure I'd call this a porter if I stumbled upon this recipe, but I'd call it a damn fine session stout. cheers to Bell's for another fine beer.","chicagoabbot","Nov 20, 2011"

I was getting some roasted malty sweet tones in the nose, maybe a little coffee. Mouthfeel didn't disappoint and got better as the bottle went down and temp of the beer increased. Taste was like a robust porter with a slight hint of coffee and sweetness, maybe a little treacle. This reminded me of the college days and I longed for more.

I probably won't buy any more of these from Trader Joe's, but I'm going to try some that I get from my friends at The Wine and Cheese Place and see if there is a difference.

Taste is of roasted malts and coffee up front, some hops are present, a touch of chocolate. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer.","tone77","Aug 06, 2011"
3.8,-1.6,4,4,3.5,4,4,"The beer pours a solid black, with only a finger and a half of light tan colored foam rising from the pour. The head does display both admirable retention and lacing though. The nose reminds me of a milk stout. There's some black coffee and roasted grains, but there's also a sweetness that reminds me of a lactose infused beer. Those same three things are what jump out in the flavor. The roasted grain though increases in presence to the point that it lends a slightly acrid note to the beer. The mouthfeel is solid on this one. The carbonation is spot on, a bit on the subdued side to let the malts shine forward, but the body could stand to be just a touch more substantial. Bell's Porter is a solid porter, and one that I wouldn't mind picking up a six pack of every once in a while if it was distributed in New Jersey.","axeman9182","Aug 01, 2011"

Again rich coffee on the tongue, sugary sweets, toffee, chocolate, and wholesome nuts. The feel is light to medium despite its heavy color, very rich, savory and tasty. Overall this is a damn good porter, it hits all the right spots, and has a nice complexity that makes it very enjoyable beer.","gabedivision","Jul 19, 2011"

4.4,14,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"O: A different take on a porter, more akin to a stout. I love the creaminess and dark roast aromas/flavors. Definitely something I'd go out of my way to get again. A solid "A" brew. I think I prefer this to Bell's Kalamazoo Stout, at least out of the bottle. This rivals my all-time favorite Edmund Fitzgerald. I'll have to put them up head-to-head someday to see which one comes out the winner. But it'll be a damn close call.","DrewV","Jul 10, 2011"

4.15,7.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is an extremely dark brown coloring, with a healthy, frothy, biege colored head that starts around the one inch mark and quickly settles into a sparse film. Aromas of coffee, sweet nut, and oak. The beer is light and crisp in mouth, and the flavors are light and creamy coffee, with a slight bittering at the end, with highlights of caramel sweetness. The increased levels of carbonation keep the beer light in mouth, and the finish is crisp and quick. The aftertaste is hazelnut coffee. This beer, although light, leaves a great lacing along the glass. Very tasty and light, making it way too easy to drink...good problem to have.","GarthDanielson","Jun 20, 2011"
4.07,5.4,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Yum, another fantastic American Porter to add to my favorites. This one nails it in terms of malt aromas and flavors. The carbonation seems a bit weak on this bottle, but its a minor gripe. The beer is fantastic on the whole.","plfahey","Jun 18, 2011"

Faint hint of vanilla and some earthy, grassy hops way in the back. Dominated with roast, slightly dry finish. Medium bodied, but a bit thin on the tounge.

3.6,-6.7,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Bell's porter looks the standard mix of deep dark browns mixed with some black with a bit of seepage when up to light. A big inch of loose brown foam that left no stick, eventually died down. Smell is the standard porter roasted malt mixing in with some burnt and vanilla. Taste is roasted malt, vanilla, peat, chocolate, slight bitter coffee. Feel is a bit thin, I would say a step under medium, it needs a boost. Carb is adaquate but lacking as well. I drank it and next time I'll opt for a Founder's porter. The feel kinda kills this one for me.","BARFLYB","Feb 05, 2011"

On the lighter side for the style, but very well balanced and with a long, slightly bitter, and slightly peppery finish that exhibits roasty notes and some earthy depth. Smooth, and although somewhat light bodied, it has a long finish. Quite good.","Georgiabeer","Jan 23, 2011"
3.57,-7.5,3.5,4,3,4,4,"When the beer hits your mouth, it's sharp - not in a hoppy way, but in a way that's more aggressive than most porters are comfortable being. But the mouthfeel is great; a near-perfect level of carbonation filled with coffee and burnt chocolate. The drinkability is also top-notch but loses a point because it's so filling. I feel like I'm ready for a nap after a bottle and a half.","sobis1dm","Jan 21, 2011"

The flavor is moderately malty -- a little roast, definitely chocolate and just a bit of dryness and hop bitterness at the swallow.

Head's gone after about 3 minutes leaving a few islands on the surface. It's a shame because the first few sips were my favorite. Very strong chocolate/coffee smell, it's refreshing and lingers for a while. Taste is excellent. This is what I want when I get a porter. Sweet smoked chocolate and coffee malts give way to a quick bitter ending with a pleasant aftertaste. Nothing is overpowering and everything seems to be in a good balance. It's a lighter bodied porter with some mild carbonation but it is very good. If I'm in the mood for a porter, this is the first thing I'm looking for.","hangh","Dec 28, 2010"

The smell is chocolate mixed with coffee, and some hops. The taste is a mild taste of chocolate at first, than the coffee kicks in followed by some hops and raisins. The aftertaste reminds me of chocolate covered raisins. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, and even though I have only tasted four or five porters in my life and am fairly new to the style I'll admit that this is the smoothest and most drinkable one I've had so far.","DannyDan","Dec 26, 2010"

It pours a deep ruby brown topped by a short finger of ecru foam. The nose comprises light roasted malts, a very light hickory smoke, brown sugar, light molasses, and a good helping of black pepper. The taste goes a bit heavier on the pepper and smoke (less of the latter) and adds some mild greens, but, beyond that, everything from the nose returns on the tongue. The body is a lithe medium, with a moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a very nice porter, but a bit too dry and fizzy for me to really get into it. other than that, though, it's pretty solid.","TMoney2591","Dec 12, 2010"

A roasted malt aroma with touches of chocolate and coffee, with a touch of molasses at the end. The chocolate, coffee, and roasted flavors dominate the taste, then a strong bitterness with some grass and pine flavors, but mostly a lactic bitter flavor. A slightly watery feel that grows to more medium bodied feel. The finish is dry to the point you pucker your lips. This by far one of the best porters I have ever had, the classic color and rosty aroma. A flavor that leaves you wanting more and a feel that cleans the palate.

4.6,19.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours a beautiful dark brown with 2 inch tan head formation. The pouring suggests a medium body, which is later confirmed. The head is persistent and settles in at 1.5 inches a flat, creamy top and plethora of micro-bubbles intermingled with larger cavities up to 1/8th inch. As you drink this ale the Belgian lace is well formed and decorative. The nose provides deep roasted notes. Hops are not evident. The porter has a medium body with a light cream texture. The suggestive chocolate and coffee notes join the maltyness, making the ale very nicely balanced. Carbonation is pleasant. The alcohol is moderate and not noticeable on the palate. Combined with delicious lingering this porter definitely invites repeat tastes. Another moreish ale! Light enough to be a restorative and a refresher, yet full enough of flavor to satisfy most any palate.","carlborch","Aug 06, 2009"

(More chocolate/coffee scent comes through as you come close to finishing the beer.) Taste is kinda bland, very minor chocolate and coffee notes but I keep feeling like this beer seems to be watered down. Not much carbination, mouthfeel is ok but nothing exciting.

There's a cm thick head with loose bubbles that fell down into a little ring and left just a little bit of lacing. Looks just like most other porters. The smell is about what I would expect as well. Some coffee, dark chocolate, just a little bit of cola like sweetness. Nothing intense or too incredible. This doesn't set itself apart in the smell. But the taste is what amazes me. I mean, everything that a porter should be, this is. And there's not a thing to upset me here. There's immediately a dark chocolate bite, with a bit of a syrupy caramel taste underneath. Then the coffee notes hit, and burst with the carbonation, very pleasant. There's almost a creaminess to it, which is enhanced while there's still a head. I really like this in the taste department. I mean, just perfect for a porter. The mouthfeel is nice. Fairly low carbonation, right in line with what I want. Not a stand out, though its hard to stand out in this style I think. Of course this was a perfectly enjoyable drink. I mean, I would recommend it as a top-notch porter. If you see it, remember that it isn't an imperial anything, but it's a perfectly lovable beer.

The beer is much better as it warms up as I've found in drinking a couple of these in the last week. But I'm wondering if this is the freshest porter possible from Bell's, because I find this batch was made on Sept. 5, 2008 (batch # 8726). I purchased the 6 pack at Mid-Town Liquors in Bridgman, MI on March 14, 2009 so I'm a bit surprised to get a porter made 6 1/2 months earlier. Still, I enjoy porters so the review must go on. Not quite as good as Founder's Porter, which is in a league of its own, but this Bell's brew holds its own with a rich, delectable smell and taste. Obviously, age hasn't affected this porter.

It's medium-bodied, has a good deal of density which appears to have been accounted for by the highly active carbonation. Plenty of chicory bitterness to tussle with the chocolate, cappuccino, caramel flavors. More roast here, both flavor-wise and texturally. The hazelnut, Brazil nut, macadamia nuts lend an attractive thread throughout. The plum, cherry fruit muted here. Moderate corn and grain notes but never gets "hoppy" per se.

Smelled of malt,chocolate, and burnt coffee. Maybe a hint of alcohol. Tasted of burnt coffee, chocolate, malt and a slight cream flavor. Had a slight bitter aftertaste that hung around awhile. Felt smooth and thick in the mouth. Carbonation was good. I think this is one of those beers that if you did a session with it, you would have to be carefull.

The taste is similar to the aroma (but stronger), it tastes like bittersweet chocolate, roasted/burnt malt, coffee and some earthy hops.

Basic, but enjoyable smelling porter. Taste begins with smoked barley and dark chocolate with freshly brewed coffee. Wheat bread and cane sugar midway with a slightly dry, but clean, aftertaste from the hops. Soft, smooth, and creamy feel with a light to medium body. Carbonation is light and fluffy.

Poured black with some deep brown highlights around the edges. One-inch fluffy off-white head. Scents of chocolate and malt. Taste similar to nose, but not as flavorful as the nose had implied. Some subtle roasted coffee character, as well as a little bit of hops bite at the finish. Mouthfeel was somewhat lively, but also a lit less full-bodied than anticipated (not quite watery, but also not quite medium-bodied).

It sweetens a some in the middle then breaks up to a clean finish. Feel is smooth with a lighter medium body. Leaves a little oily feeling, but has a very clean finish.

I would definitely recommend this beer to someone and I will probably drink more of this one in future.","kbeals","Mar 19, 2008"

I'm not saying it needs to be insanely extravagant, but porters (and not Baltic style) are just being overdone with mediocrity these days, if you'll excuse the semi-oxymoron. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed this, but I don't know if I could tell the difference between this and hundreds out there. Again, Bell's is hit or miss with me, and this is somewhere in between, but there are much better examples with more flavor and balance and nuance and complexity out there to try.","asabreed","Feb 18, 2008"

3.83,-0.8,4,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,"The beer poured a beautiful midnight black with a luscious tan inch and a half head. While the beer was being poured it gave a coarse fizzing sound, almost like pouring a soda into a glass, kind of bad news. At first the head had a very coarse texture with large bubbles, but as I began to drink, the head condensed into nice tight bubbles. The beer did not carry a very heavy scent to it, but I did smell almost candy sweet malts, biscuit and croissant aromas, matched with faint scents of coffee, dark chocolate, toffee, and the faintest scent of floral hops. The taste of the brew was incredibly sweet. At the forefront of the palate was a heavy sweet biscuit taste, the beer probably had a strong base of two-row malts. After letting the beer acquaint itself with my taste buds, strong flavors of black patent malts became prevalent, as well as a good dose of chocolate malts. These ingredients produced flavors of coffee, dark chocolate and faint hints of charred oak. The high point of this beer was definitely the body. The body of this porter was captivatingly smooth, like cashmere rolling across the tongue. Overall an excellent offering by Bells.","KingNoonan","Feb 01, 2008"

A bit of melted snow in the finish. Roasted French roast coffee in the finish lingers, but doesn't overwhelm.

Lots of roasted malt in fairly good balance with the hops that show up later on. A touch of chocolate and maybe a bit of dried fruit too. Not as flavorfull as the Edmund Fitzgerald, but good, nonetheless. Feel is a little thin for a porter, although the carbonation is good.

3.88,0.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The 'tap' version of the beer offers a better experience than from the bottle. The beer is typically colored with a deep walnut hue and nearly opaque. Well headed and modestly carbonated gives visual weight and stability to the brew. Faint aromas of coffee, chocolate, toasted malts, and heavy cream. The flavors of malt sweetness pronounce early, but are quickly tempered by bold columbian coffee notes and acidity, fresh bitter hops, walnuts, cocoa, and milk sugars. Creamy textured and silky smooth, not relying on carbonation to lighten the feel. Finishes with a simple coffee and milk aftertaste that lingers into a slight bitterness. As nicely flavored as I had remembered, but better bodied from the tap.","BEERchitect","May 03, 2007"

The hops were very subtle, almost unnoticeable, but seemed to do their job balancing out as the malt was not over aggressive. This is certainly a full bodied porter for one that is only 6%.

The smell of this brew is unremarkable, but one can pick up a bit of roasted malt and some yeast. As for drinking, this beer is pleasantly light for a porter leading to it being very drinkable. At the same time, however, it does not seem to quite live up to the advertising of its appearance. As dark as it looks, this beer does not have quite as complex nor as deep a flavor as I would expect. This flaw is remedied if one allows the beer time to warm a bit as I feel that this makes the beer a bit sweeter and allow some of its 'maltiness' to come out.

A small brown head is present for just a flourish before retreating to a thin coating. Nice aroma of rich roasted malt, with a hint of dark sweet fruit. Palate is nice and complex - roasted malt, raisins, muted fruity hops, and a little bit of lactose sweetness. Body is nice and sturdy, although it could stand to be a bit creamier. Overall, a nice, well-balanced porter.","ElGordo","Jun 29, 2006"
3.88,0.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Near black in color. Perhaps the bartender poured it a little too safely, but regardless, there was no head. Roasted malt and dark chocolate on the nose. Full-bodied mouthfeel. Flavors of dark chocolate and roasted bitterness are detected first. Then the flavor sort of takes a step back midway through before a strong vinous finish. Hop bitterness is higher than average for a porter, but adds more depth the overall flavor rather than detract from it. Very enjoyable. 5.25% is a little high to qualify as a session, but I could drink this all night long.","Winter","Jun 27, 2006"

The taste was similar, but more complex, with some flavors I couldn't pick out. Maybe banana. Plenty of generic "dark roasted" flavor, but it was good.

Flavor starts out sweet and fruity, with notes of apples and grapes. Dark roast malt flavors are light, well balanced with the sweets. Very little hop bittering makes for a sweet finish.

Very solid looking beer. Nose is not quite where I was expecting it to be. I'm getting nuttyness, light roast and a kiss of caramel sweetness. There is a touch of coffee when I take a really big whiff, but the nutty character is dominant. Flavor is better. Very solid roasty character, moving to a light coffee with caramel sweetness and light chocolate notes. This is a tasty brew. The sweetness and caramel follow up in the finish as well. Feel is at the fuller end of moderate with a solid moderate carbonation to balance things. Substantial, but not overwhelming. This is easily a session beer. I think the flavor and feel are the best parts of this brew. A porter I could have any season. Its pretty good.","kmpitz2","Feb 17, 2006"

Smells chocolate with some black patent and a grassy dry coffee. Tastes wet sweet fighting a dry roast. Noticable chocolate is complimented by and compliments the malt sweet. A strong, but not over-bearing cherry sour from black malt pulls the beer in an interesting direction. Well done. Woody or cotton-like hop feel with a Fuggles flavor. Nice lacing on the inside of the glass. Md body and a bit too sharply carbonated.

Ordinarily, I'd be much more surprised at how hoppy this porter is, but it really can't compare to the Summit Great Northern--which is a good thing.

It has the roast malt with espresso aromas Im used to, but there is also a bit of walnut, and toffee in the nose. The flavor was a real surprise. There is a sweetness to the beer that is tough to characterize. It has a bit of black cherry, more of the toffee, and the espresso in the finish. The hops just give it a nice kick of bitterness.

Interesting on my palate and not what I have grown accostomed to from the several porters I've had. Not very much sweetness or chocolate notes at all. Mouthfeel is nice, creamy and well-carbonated which makes drinkabilty good. I could put a few of these back, but the bitter, smokiness might get to me after a couple.

Dark roasted malts contribute a nice roasted coffee and chocolate flavors to the malt backbone of this brew. Bitterness balances the malt well carrying through in the aftertaste.

The head is rather thick and is a creamy, brownish ivory color. The aroma is the weakest aspect of this beer in my opinion. I don't get the complex roasted scent I normally pick up from a porter, but rather an almost unpleasant smell that reminds me somewhat of my least favorite Bell's concoction, the Third Coast Beer. The taste is definitely a step up from the smell, but still is not up to what I consider a really good porter. The hoppy, chocolately, roasted elements that make up a porter are all there, but seem a little hidden behind a rather boring watery base. I doubt I'll pick this one up again.","profzoom","Sep 24, 2004"

Pours out a deep black colour with a dark walnut brown nimbus, big spongy biege head that eventually recedes to a ring and leaves some lacing. Some floating sediment can be seen even in the black body, suspended yeast particles would be my wager. Very enticing bold aroma of dry roasted malt, dark chocolate, and almost a burnt hickory woodsy aroma kicking around in there, as well as small traces of coffee beans. The flavour profile seems pretty simple to me, just a whirling unison of roasted malt and sweet chocolate, with a dry earthy aftertaste, but it works in all the right places. By far the best porter I have tried all year. A little watery in the mouthfeel, but that is the only slight blemish I am experiencing.

Not to roasty or smoky like many other porters, but close to a perfect porter blend. The matiness bleds extreamly well with the roastyness.

Smell is one complexing delicate nose of sourness of fruits, much like lemon-lime and oranges mixed but dulled and kinda dark, very calm, but I can definately detect a sour-like quality. Somewhat like super fresh sourdough bread yeast. I love it, whatever it is. That destinct Bell's quality. Aroma continues into some deeply roasted malts with cocoa hints and hop notes with a very slight coffeeish note as well. The taste is more complexing madness that starts mildly tangy, somewhat dullish fruit and hops, reminded me of mandorine oranges and of oriental salads with sesame, vinegar & soy sauces, but very good and not to sour at all. This is one pleasantly interesting porter. Flavors continue into some slight light and tangy smoothness of roasted malts, subtle in layers, and a really good mix of earthy tangy dryness thats a bit tingly and all in all very luscious and interestingly yummy. The more I drank it the more I absolutley fell in love with it. Feel is a smooth medium body with subtle layers of tangy dryness, damn nice.

Light and surprisingly drinkable. Not at all disapointing but alas, short of the Great Lakes standard. I certainly wouldn't refuse a pint but next time I'll go for the Fitzgerald.","mickstepp","Apr 01, 2003"
4.15,7.5,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"This beer pours a very dark brown color with a nice creamy tan head that clings to the glass and leaves rings on the way down. The aroma of this beer immediately lets you know it is not your everyday porter. It has a strong roasted coffee smell to it. Initially the taste is a strong coffee flavor and finishes with a hoppy/chocolate flavor. After the first drink, I was blown away by this, and thought maybe it was too much coffee flavor for me; however, as I drank it, it kept tasting better and better. Saved a couple of bottles for the next day, and it tasted even better. Overall this is a strong flavored porter that just tastes better with every drink.","darklager","Mar 29, 2003"
4.47,15.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Very dark brown, medium sized thick and tan head. Strong aromas of chocolate, coffee, a little hops as well. A very enjoyable mouthfeel, creamy and smooth with a perfect amount of carbonation. Strong flavors of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, and some hops on the finish. No sourness detected here, just a very kick ass porter.","AudioGilz","Mar 13, 2003"
4.85,25.6,5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Having it on tap raises the mouthfeel and drinkability from 4.5 to 5.0, making it "The Perfect Porter". (Take that Bert Grant!). Exceptional in every way.","Mitchster","Feb 10, 2003"
4.42,14.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Nearly black in color, with a full, dark tan head. Aroma is rich and roasty, toasty, even slightly burnt. Dark chocolate comes out on top, with hints of nuts and spices. Full-bodied, good texture, with loads of tingly hops. A fine rendition of the style.","feloniousmonk","Jan 14, 2003"
4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability: Pretty good. The sourness isn't all that welcome, but it's only a small part of the flavor profile. It's not as thick as most porters I like, but it's quite good. Combine that and the modest alcohol level, and you have a porter I could sip from all night...and it's even better on draft!","MJR","Jan 07, 2003"
3.23,-16.3,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Deep brown in color with a light brown head. The aroma is sour with roast malt aromas, and chocolate notes. The flavor is a burnt roast malt, with chocolate and coffee flavors. The hop bitterness is present as well as bitterness from the roast grains. The finish is sweet and tart. The tartness I gather comes from the yeast used. Overall some good flavors and aromas, but the tartness kills this beer for me.","BeerBuilder","Jan 06, 2003"

3.06,-20.7,4,3,3,3,3,"At first I thought this was very good...I got a chocolate flavor right off the bat....seemed like I was drinking a milkshake...then that trademark Bell's yeast flavor emerged...I like it in some of their beers...In this one, I'm not real fond of it...It is black in color..nose is sourish like that yeast strain..the finish is also somewhat tart...Not an outstanding porter in my book...slightly above average.","ZAP","Nov 26, 2002"
4.36,13,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,"head of krausen but I don't know how long it will stay, as I always devoured it before I could find out!  The taste is relatively flat, in that no ingredient stands out above the others, A perfect balance in harmony.  It so inspired me, I am trying to clone this beer for My own understanding of what it takes to build THIS Beer.","kennywoodbrew","Nov 06, 2002"
3.29,-14.8,4,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Great natural look but it smells like a sack of government grain that has been rained on for two or three seasons. The taste gives nice, clearly defined cocoa and coffee. Dry. An echo of metal and rotting grain on the palate. This was probably my first brand of Porter. The question is: Has KBC quality changed or have my tastes? Probably both. I can't imagine ever having been entranced by such mediocrity.","putnam","Oct 12, 2002"
4.08,5.7,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"This is a good porter, very dark brown/black, light tan head, Coffee/caremel flavors with a burnt/smokey malt flavor. If you are into elements of burnt malt this is the porter for you . Overall I'd recomend it, when I am in the mood for a hearty rustic beer I grab one of these.","jtw5877","Sep 20, 2002"
4.15,7.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Thei beer poured almost black with little head.  A small, bubbly tan head.  Little lace.  Some carbonation.  Aroma of burnt malt, chocolate and coffee.  Flavor of burnt malt, coffee and chocolate.  A slight bitter finish to it.  Good beer and worth checking out.","Wildman","Jul 13, 2002"
4.75,23.1,4.5,4.5,5,4,5,"Damn, what a way for me to come off of my month of no brews.  The brew is black and pours with a huge tan head that never completely fades and leaves a nice lace on the glass.  Tons of roasted malts in the nose and some underlying coffee and chocolate.  The taste starts off chocolately sweet with some very nce malt.  As the taste lingers it turns into a nice coffee and roasted malt bitterness.  The bitterness stays on the tongue and leaves you craving the next sip.  Good slick mouthfeel and extremely drinkable.  After finishing this on I was left wishing I had a whole sixer in my fridge.  This is one excellent porter.  Everything this style should be and probably my favorite porter to date.  Thanks to Deuce for the sample.","Murph","Jul 01, 2002"
4.05,4.9,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Deep chestnut hue with flashes of mirked ruby when held to light. Stiff, thick, creamy, and billowy tan head leaves dogged lace. Notes of carob, dark caramel and sharp coffee - like black patent malt in aroma, while the signature Bell's tart fruity yeast esters is quite prominent in aroma as well. Mellow diacetyl combines with chocolate malt to lend a buttery cocoa richness. Toffeeish sweetness upfront in flavor yields to notes of lightly burnt bread and butter. Residual sweetness becomes fructose in nature and date like mid palate, but is well tapered by a combination of roasted grain and hop bitterness. Trace yeast derived tartness and soft butterscotch emerge late, adding an agreeable pruneish fruit and buttery tinge which complements the stately cocoa presence. The body is moderate, and while carbonation is high, ample dextrins facilitate a nearly creamy mouthfeel. Finishes both gently tart softly roasted with fleeting notes of molasses and coffee liquor. A well balanced porter with well integrated roasted malt and ester character. Soft, almost breezy on the palate, and thus superbly drinkable.","marc77","Jun 20, 2002"
3.63,-6,4.5,4,3.5,4,3,"Bell’s Porter: With a strong/malt aroma that you can smell as soon as it hits the glass.  Thick, dark color that you can’t see through, even after its been held up to the sun.  The head is thick, creamy and very long lasting.  Wow, this is extraordinarily rich, with strong burnt malt flavor, and a long lingering aftertaste of coffee/espresso.  Not for the faint of heart.","jackndan","Jun 18, 2002"
4.18,8.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"I've been drinkin this mash since the zoo brew started long ago..  This is a fine effort, a must try for porter lovers.  Black with the typical strong chocolate coffee flavor.","stoutman","Jun 01, 2002"
4.5,16.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer is dark ruby, almost black. It pours a pillowy cream light brown head that has some retention. There really nice chocolate and roast tones on the nose. Very nice bitterness in the taste coming from the roasted malt. There's a bittersweet chocolate taste making its presence known as well. Smooth and velvety mouthfeel. Medium body. A nice lingering bitterness. Very solid porter.","Bighuge","Apr 22, 2002"
4.7,21.8,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"I love this beer.  Dark, roasty, excellent malt presence with a nice hop finish.  Definetely a beer to drink during the cool weather.  Bell's does not make beer for those with sensitive taste buds.","proc","Feb 16, 2002"
4.59,18.9,3.5,4.5,5,5,4,"My favorite style of beer and Bell's is up to the challenge of one of the best bottled Porters I've ever had...toffee/coffee, with excellent mouthfeel...it can get chunky as its unpastuerized, but that's not at  all offputting to me....this brewery seems to be expanding its regional distribution, so eventually the world will expect great things from this outstanding regional...","ADR","Feb 15, 2002"
4.28,10.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Robust porter indeed. As stated in previous reviews, coffee and chocolate abound. Full, rich body and mouthfeel. One of several clear favorites from a Canadian brewfest this past summer (I'm finally getting around to reviewing some of them).","John","Feb 06, 2002"
