4.24,10.1,4,3.75,4.5,4.5,4.25,"On nitro tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Great looking head & lacing that may be smoothering the aroma but not the luscious taste & texture. Nowadays I distinguish porters from stouts by the lack of coffee/chocolate. This is a classic example, IMO, of just that. Don`t get me wrong, I really enjoy it & appreciate the vaca from the tropical aspects. Needless to say the ubiquitous vanilla & sweet are not missed. Malt is ruling this roost.","seedyone","Feb 26, 2015"
3.8,-1.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"12 oz bottle poured into shaker pint. Dark opaque brown body with a tan half-finger of head that settled to a ring. A good amount of lacing is deposited. Aroma is malty - toasted bread, coffee, chocolate - with a touch of hops in the background adding a spicy herbal note. Taste is toasted malt sweetness early then hop spice in the end. Medium body, slick texture, low-average carbonation, long semi-dry roasted finish.","SierraFlight","Feb 22, 2015"

The aroma was of bitter coffee, and blueberries (surprisingly!).  Sweet tasting maltiness on the first sip, followed by some bitterness, with that dark roast coffee taste lingering on the tongue.  Overall very tasty, a fine porter I would try again.","rorjets","Feb 02, 2015"

The chocolate malts are up front here, with a taste of fresh baked cookies. Not overly chewy, but with enough body to keep this as a solid option during Spring or Fall, before you need to go to the real warmers.","Barnoloid","Jan 11, 2015"

It's a nice change of pace beer, but my criticisms would be that the hops are a bit sharp. Get a nice grassy English strain in there and I think I'd like it quite a bit more.

I may have picked up an exception to the rule (I sure hope not), as this beer was wild and foamy with yeast fermentation straight out of the bottle, but it is for sure a winner.

It should come as no surprise then that their Mudpuppy Porter, a stout's younger brother, should be just as crafted in regards to dark malts and, sure enough, it is!

Smells of dark chocolate, a little splash of coffee, and that's about it. I can't really find the expected scent of toasted or roasted malt. Tastes of the roasted malt I was expecting to find in the nose. Further investigation reveals a bit of sweet malt and earthen hopping in the flavor once the beer has warmed up for a bit, and a medium body and carbonation level.

Packs a lot of caramel and toffee into the beer. The chocolate mouthfeel is the kind with no sweetness. Dry. Pretty enjoyable around a campfire when you're just drinking the sessionable stuff.

The nose comprises maple syrup, light molasses, light chocolate powder, cinnamon, brown sugar, and toffee. The taste holds notes of light roasted malt, coffee, toffee, dark chocolate, brown sugar, molasses, and a fairly strong contingent of wood (I'd say oak, but I'm not entirely sure here). The wood and dark-chocolate bitterness combine to take away from the other elements, to the slight detriment of the overall flavor. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish.

Coffee is quickly picked up by the nose, however, nothing too powerful and a faint chocolate shows up after a couple inspections. The taste is confusing me as the smell of the beer doesn't add up to what I imagined the beer to be; this, however, is not a far from a bad thing as I find that the introduction of hops and low ABV balances out this beer to be easily drinkable.

It is very faint though...too faint really. The taste is a little stronger, but still weak for a porter. If I concentrate really hard I can pick up the roasted malt and some cream, and although it is nice it is almost not worth the work. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a less than smooth texture. Overall, this beer is a mild disappointment. I enjoy spending time breaking down a beer, and finding all kinds of nuances in it. But this beer seems like all I'm doing is breaking the beer down without finding anything.

There is a moderate carbonation in there and the clarity appears to be fairly good, but the darkness makes it hard to tell. I find a light chocolate and roast with a ton of lacto sweetness and some butterscotch notes as well. The flavor is again very butterscotch sweet with noticeable lacto sweetness, with a more subdued chocolate, a slight sharpness from roast that melds well with a solid hop bitterness on the finish. My initial thought on this one was the it was rife with diacetyl, but I really think it is an overpowering lacto character that I am getting. Either way, it is not me favorite. Mouthfeel is on the light end of moderate with a moderate carbonation. Overall, I just can't get past the overriding lactose sugar quality I am finding. It overpowers the brew and really gets in the way of the chocolate and roast notes I want to find. I would not get this one again.","kmpitz2","Sep 19, 2007"
4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Enjoyed on my summer joy ride through the state of Wisconsin, thanks to the "Mayor of Hammertown (in Wisc.)" for the hospitality and fine Central water beers. This one was sampled on tap and bottles, this is a review of the bottled version. 12 ouncer, poured dark dark, brown/amber, with a initially puffy dark tan head, leaves plenty of sheeting, then fine lacing. Nose is pure chocolate, yum. Lots of chocolate, some vanilla, cocoa, dark toasty/crusty malts. Nice, malty, flavorful, chocolate milk shake style porter. Smooth and filling, with a late hop bite and dry out. Nice.","Billolick","Sep 06, 2007"
3.82,-0.8,5,3,3.5,4,5,"This pour beers a somewhat inky black, with a head that just never seems to quit. Aroma is somewhat roasty, but an inadequate prelude to the flavor, which is light and drinkable but also somewhat roasty. This beer is very drinkable (more than I expected for a porter) yet also decently flavorful. A bit odd for the style, but fairly pleasantly surprising.","BeerBelcher","Aug 24, 2007"

4.15,7.8,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"This beer is all about dark roasted, chocolate grains. I comes close to the fine line between porter and stout with some of the grains, but still won't be mistaken for anything but a porter. The grains aren't particularly innovative and there isn't any crazy dry-hopping. But there's a dark, rich flavor, backed by an intense bitter cocoa and coffee aftertaste. Consider that the body is quite drinkable and that the ale is pleasing to the eye, and you've got a winner.","tempest","Apr 23, 2007"

4.2,9.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Thanks to nflmvp for sending this my way. Poured from a 12oz. brown bottle into my Sierra Nevada shaker "pint" glass. Appears a translucent dark brown color with about half an inch of tan foam that disappears within a minute. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt, and molasses are most evident. Tastes primarily of rich roasted malt followed by bitter coffee and cocoa with maybe a touch of vanilla. Creamy mouthfeel, bordering on full bodied with medium to moderate carbonation. One of the best in it's style. Highly recommended if you can score some. I'm going to enjoy the last half or so of my glass with a chocolate almond biscotti.","ClockworkOrange","Mar 22, 2007"
3.38,-12.2,4.5,4,3,3.5,3,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4" brown head over the almost opaque brownish burgundy brew. Head fades slowly, with lots of lacing. Aroma is powdered chocolate, with darkly vinous notes. Taste finds the same parts as the nose, but the dark fruits overpower the malts, providing a tartness that I can't really appreciate in a porter. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both quashed somewhat by the tartness which just invades most all for me after I get it in my mouth.","ppoitras","Feb 19, 2007"
4.15,7.8,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a deep dark brown with a fluffy tan head, and great lacing. Dark chocolate, toffee and molasses in the nose. Solid flavour. Strong, coffee, roasty and bitter, with a dry finish. Great mouthfeel and body. Also has a nice initial sweetness in each sip. Quite well hopped for a porter, and I like it. Very nice porter. Recommended.","baiser","Jan 13, 2007"
4.23,9.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Mouthfeel is thin, somewhat creamy, bolstered by that roasty aftertaste. It's not as thick as a stout, though the flavor makes up for the less robust mouthfeel.

4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Recommended to me by an extremely helpful clerk at Riley's Wines of the World in Madison, WI, who said it was one of his favorite go-to beers. Pours dark with a nice big creamy head. Smells nutty, chocolately and roasty. Taste is very nice. Bitter roasted coffee flavor with some bitter chocolate nut taste too. Not too thin, not too thick, good carbonation. A nice example of the style from a tiny little brewery in WI. Definitely would drink this again.","aforbes10","Jun 13, 2006"
3.5,-9.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Aroma is sweet cream and milk chocolate with little in the way of roasty notes. A dark brown body holds a pinky thin creamy, tan head.

3.95,2.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"12 ounce bottle. Mud Puppy Porter pours out a very dark brown color with a big, creamy head. Very strong citrus in the aroma, along with chocolate and cherries. Good roasted flavor, but a little too tangy and fruity. I would have liked more emphasis on the roasted chocolate flavor. Finishes with flavorful hops, but not overwhelmingly hoppy. Mouthfeel is a tad thin. This is a very good porter with many interesting flavors.","beveragecaptain","Nov 29, 2005"

4.03,4.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Looks very pretty, just like I'd want a porter to--extremely dark brown that glows a beautiful red where the light comes through. Nice tan head. Smells roasted and burnt, very refreshing after my unfortunate dalliance with Baltic porters yesterday. Tastes very nice, burnt coffee and bitterness. The only drawback is occasional flashes of alcohol. Mouthfeel is full and lively. Ah yes, my old friend the porter, reconstructed faithfully by Central Waters. Very smooth, a lovely beer.","battlekow","Jul 21, 2005"
3.88,0.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a deep brown with a decent tan head which fadesrather quickly but leaves some good lacing. Nose is robust, strong roasted coffee and bitter chocolate with a hint of hops. Taste follows suit with a yummy mix of burnt coffee and dark chocolate. Not overwhelming, but strong - good for a porter. Mouthfeel is medium, a little creamy and a little thin. Drinkability is very good, could have finished a sixer with ease. Overall a solid porter from Central Waters, a little Wisconsin brewery which I've been impressed with to date. Not the best porter I've had, but not bad by any means...give it a try if you can find it.","Golden2wenty1","Jul 17, 2005"

4.35,13,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Silky smooth, crisp and clean in the mouth. Carbonation is exactly where it should be; nothing getting in the way of the taste. It's very hard to set this down, as it goes down so easy. A 6 pack for the evening is definately a good idea. A classic porter, very comparable to St. Peter's Old Style Porter, which also stands out in front of the pack.","Skidz","Mar 19, 2004"
4.28,11.2,4,3.5,4.5,5,4.5,"This brew is a dark dark brown with a good tan head and lacing up and down the glass. Aromas of hops and chocolate appear when smelled. Starts out with a bitter hops followed smoothly by a dry chocolate finish ending on the sweeter side. Sits in the mouth well extremely creamy porter that was very enjoyable. Could drink multiple ones of these, not as filling as most porters for me.","abents","Mar 04, 2004"
3.95,2.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"A hoppier porter than most, especially in its aroma.  This beer pours a dark leather brown with a nice frothy tan head that reduces but lingers.  The somewhat floral hop aroma dominates at first but then roasted malt comes through.  The taste is well-balanced, but I prefer more roasted malt flavor.  The body is a bit thin as well.  Still this is one of the better porters being brewed in Wisconsin right now and it is very drinkable.","brakspear","Sep 30, 2002"

Aroma is chocolatey and a bit hoppy (guessing cascade because this smells similar to Sierra's porter).  This beer has a very creamy mouthfeel.  Beautiful.  Taste is robust.  Chocolate notes are evident.  Nice bitterness.  I tend to like hopped up porters and this one seems to be on high range for hopping in a porter.  Really smooth and drinkable.  Very good porter.","Bighuge","Apr 01, 2002"
