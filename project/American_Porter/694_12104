There’s too much hops in it which completely overpowers the traditional porter-style flavors of roasted malt, coffee and dark chocolate and because of that I don’t really like it, however, hop heads should like it.","Jeffreysan","Dec 29, 2014"

I do in fact like this beer, and it was a pleasant surprise. I will probably buy it again, just not when I have a taste for a porter.","Extrajoker00","Oct 28, 2013"

I've have it had a couple of times not in season and its been ok but considering Troegs hops this up much more than a porter(Style wise should be) the fresh version is way better. Still not my favorite porter, but the mix of dark malts and citrus/pine hops is tasty. I got this at the brewery before it hit stores near me(2 hours away) so its really fresh and awesome, having had old versions the hops aroma/flavor fades and the malts that remain aren't enough to make a great porter(i.e. the over hopping makes this beer). A nice hoppy Porter.","LI_PO12","Aug 29, 2013"

3.8,0,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Dead Reckoning Porter pours a deep brown, lightening noticeably to amber along the outer edge of the glass. A finger of wispy light tan foam sits atop the beer, sticking around for a quick minute before leaving a nice amount of lacing caked to the inner wall of the glass. The nose is based around some nice mild chocolaty and nutty aromas, but there's a definite citrus background note. The balance in the flavor profile is shifted a little bit more towards the hops. The malt comes across as more straight ahead chocolate/roast and less nutty, and it's all followed by a bitterness that catches me off guard for the first sip or two. The finish is decidedly grapefruit, displaying a hand for hops that was just a hair too heavy for my taste. The body has just a little bit of a chewy aspect to it, perfect for a low ABV malty beer, and carbonation is just lively enough to let you know it's there. I enjoyed Dead Reckoning, but it was trending a little bit too much towards a black IPA for me to consider it a truly great porter.","axeman9182","Nov 18, 2012"

4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer pours a dark brown color. It has a finger of tan head resting on top. The head has good retention, and it leaves a nice sheet of lace behind on the glass. The nose has a nice bit of roasted malt in the forefront. There are some nice aromas of coffee, chocolate, toffee, and a bit of hop presence. The taste starts off with Roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee. There are also some flavors of toffee, caramel, and a bit of hops. The finish leaves some lingering roasted malt and hop bitterness lingering on the palate. The body of this is on the heavier side of medium, and it has pretty good carbonation. It goes down easy and has a nice rich smooth feel to it. There is some roasted bitterness, as well as a little bit of hop bitterness. There is some chocolatey sweetness that comes through as well. Also, there is a bit of dryness to it. Some roasted malt and sweetness lingers on the palate. This has good drinkability. I could easily have a few glasses of this. The taste is really nice, and it has a nice feel to it. Overall, I think this is a solid porter and a solid all around beer. I really enjoyed it, and I recommend trying it out.","JizackFH","Nov 22, 2011"

3.49,-8.2,4,2.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a deep, dark, amber-highlighted, black-brown coloring with a thin, tight bubbled, foamy, light tan head that settles into a slick film. The nose is effervescent, with light character overall, and little bits of nut and coffee are discernable. The beer's flavor is rich, with dark chocolate and black strap molasses sweetness, and a hazelnut-coffee bitterness to blend and clean up. The aftertaste is slightly bitter and cloying, with a rich chocolate and dark fruit sweetness. The finish is cloying, as well, with a good linger. The beer has a light and smooth body, but carries an awesome cling.","GarthDanielson","Nov 06, 2011"

3.73,-1.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"The burnt smell translates to the taste in a burnt like bitterness that is somewhat similar to coffee. Burnt woody qualities come to mind. A hop presence is there as well and may contribute to some of the bittereness, but it is in the form of coffee like flavors. The dark roasted malts take on an edge that makes the mouthfeel dry and crisp, even into a longer finish. There is a certain blandness smack dab in the middle of the taste and mouthfeel however that takes away from the overall product.

Add some caramel notes as well to the smell and some light-moderate caramel and soft chocolate malt flavors, and there you have it. But, yeah, this is predominantly fruity and hoppy.

The head is a sparse light tan cover that disperses quickly with fair lacing. The aroma is a meager malt/citrus hop hint. The flavor delivers a tart leafy/citrus hop over a shallow charcoal malt. It's a little thin with very fine carbonation. Mouthfeel is tingly with a slightly silky but dry touch. The flavor is a little slim which seems counter to my previous experience from the bottle, but it's still pretty good with its hop tones over a classic porter flavor.

4.01,5.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. Pours a dark brown color with with sort of roasted almond edges and walnut brown when held up to the light. This beer produces a large creamy looking head that sticks around and gives excellent lacing. Dead Reckoning is one very good looking beer. The smell wasn't quite what I expected. It's not bad, but the hops are what stand out the most, but not to strong. The malts are a little more difficult to detect, smells more like an ale than a porter in my opinion. When we move to the taste however it's a big step up. I actually placed it at a 4.5 but elected to move it down to a 4. I figured it was more because I was so delighted at the flavor after being a little dissapointed by the smell. The malts are much more easy to distinguish in the taste, initially sweet, and I almost feel like I can pick up something extra, almost like a vanilla flavor, but I can't completely put my finger on it. The hops completely take over from that point on, providing a very nice aftertaste from the hops. Call me crazy but it tastes more like a citrusy than piny in my opinion. The mouthfeel is pretty good, but I think it could be a little heavier for a porter, it's pretty light. I know it's an American porter but I feel like this could be a little more robust and smokey still. It makes up for it in the drinkablity category though, an extremely drinkable porter, or beer in general. Got it in a mix a six and I'd get a six pack of this by itself, I could go for another one tonight. A good year round porter.","AndyAvalanche","Feb 02, 2010"

Nice roasted malt flavor, dark chocolate comes out with a slight coffee flavor. Hop end is nice, sticks around at the back of the mouth and adds a nice bitterness as well as flavor. Finishes pretty dry and I think is enhanced by the residual hop presence. Hops give both pine as well as some citrus flavors. Has a nice feel but could have a slightly thicker.

This will make it easier to have more that one in a sitting but deviates from style a wee bit. I have to say the dark roasty flavor makes me wanna add hops to my morning coffee. The aromas however seem to be lacking. When i pass this one out I can see my pals giving it a wiff and I tell them just taste it. Carmel malt roasted barley and bitter hops take the main stage. A bready character comes out in the finish leaving you with a small amount of sour hops. All of the usual suspects are present for a stout or port and so much more. Troegs needs to have a year round stout/porter I wish this was it, needless to say I will be awaiting this every fall only.","llllDrGONZOllll","Dec 20, 2009"

The fizz really killed any sort of flavor it may have had. At first I assumed it was some take on a baltic porter but as I continued I started to doubt that. Maybe I got a bunk beer I think, I have another and its the same. I'm not ruling out that I may have had a bad 6'er but maybe it just wasn't for me.

Flavor is mostly bitter at first, then a bit of bitter chocolate sweeps in followed by a touch of sweet molasses. subsequent sips reveal smoky, dark malts and more piney notes.

The taste is bitter and semi-dry, with lots of roasted and kilned malt character. Think bread that's toasted a little too long, but not quite burned.

The aroma is faint but is a pleasant blend of roasted malts with a pretty sturdy, citrus hop presence. The flavor presents the same blend with a bracing bitterness that leads off with an off-dry grapefruit and orange peel flavor. This is followed by a caramelized malt sweetness that softens the edges of the hop bitterness before finishing with a semi-sweet caramel flavor. There's a lively carbonation that gives this beer a very refreshing quality but while the flavors on the finish are nice it could last a bit longer. Overall I found this beer very drinkable and I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would. Hopefully I'll be able to pick up some more of this before it's gone for the season and I'd highly recommend everyone doing the same. I believe they won a medal for this guy at the GABF this year and it's easy to see why. I'd say this is probably one of my top 5 early fall beers of 2009. Loved it.","apbarwood","Nov 09, 2009"

Nevertheless, my addiction to the habit of trying as a wide a selection of beers as my abilities allow me to find has lead me to another porter, this time from Troegs. I poured the 12oz into a pint glass, and it looked stouty (dark brown-black with a 2-finger tan foam). The smell is mostly roasted malts, maybe a little sweet but mostly roasty. The taste is all roast, a little bitter but I suspect from roast rather than hops. It seems to me that these flavors are just about right for a porter, just not my thing. The body is slightly heavy, a good indication of a nice malt bill, and drinkability is fine except for the roast flavor which is a little objectionable to my tastes. Overall solid, Troegs always satisfies for a style.","TurdFurgison","0"

The underlying malt profile of this beer has a very delicate grainy pilsner like feel to it under all of the roast and hops. The mouthfeel of this beer is silky smooth with a creamy character that massages the tongue, a soft carbonation and medium-full body - exceptional. A nice drinking porter that has a much different feel than most American versions.

There's plenty of hop flavor on display here as well, tobacco being most prominent to my palate, with a bit of citrus rind beneath it. Medium-light in body and carbonation both. The finish has a surprisingly bold hop bitterness, which is met by an equally strong bite from the roasted grains. Pretty big flavors here for a 5.40% brew, but it works.

The beer is a dark dark brown, with ruby edges and an inch of brownish head that leaves nice trails of lace. Nice and aromatic, with roasted barley and green hops that move into tropical notes down the road. On the palate, there are black/roasted malts, caramel, dark chocolate, coffee, tropical fruits (pineapple, pink grapefruit, orange) and a fairly high bitterness on top of a medium, dry and tingly body.

This was backed up by some malty sweetness, bittersweet chocolate, and some roast. Medium bodied and quite creamy, with a drying, roasted malt character.

The smell is hops-dominated with a pine a grapefruit, and like I said the flavor is big on hops (especially as it warms), almost to the point of being a black IPA. Maybe it is.

Has a thicker bitter edge to it. I will say that the flavor profile is consistent, though. For being a porter though, it is odd. Not really the typical kind of thing.

Drinkability is high, the only thing that limits it is one's tolerance from bitterness which you get from both ends. This seems to me like the opposite end of the porter spectrum from anchor.

Roasted nuts in the back with a very hoppy finish.

4.25,11.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid roasted and chocolate malt scent along with a faint hop aroma. The taste is pretty damn good. It has an extremely smooth roasted malt flavor. It's light in the mouthfeel, but very dry and earthy. There is a slight chocolate malt sweetness, but the Chinook hops dominate with a huge bitter blast. The bitterness seems to work well with a dark malts, which can produce a mild bitterness themselves. The mouthfeel is great. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a highly drinkable beer. It goes down with ease and finishes with a dry, bitter, roasted taste; yum.","WesWes","Sep 26, 2007"

The aroma is of overwhelming grapefruit - it's Chinooks all the way. In fact, I can barely smell anything else. This is a bit off-putting as this beer is allegedly a porter. There isn't enough roasty or chocolate aromas at all. Same goes for taste - it's dominated by Chinooks; tastes a lot like a grapefruity pale ale with the lights off. A bit too acidic as well. There's only a touch of roasty bitterness in the aftertaste but again, the Chinooks are so overwhelming that it's hard for any other flavors to surface. Mouthfeel is just a bit thin as well. All in all, this is a really strange tasting beer for a porter. It's out of balance and weighs too heavy toward the Chinooks. Great name though.","oxmasterscream","Sep 18, 2007"

Very nice lacing all the way down, too...but maybe 'cause I used one of my new Sam Adams glasses that BA was so nice to give us founding subscribers?! Anyway, I don't like too much hops, as I always say. They DO have their place, but this "porter" was waaaay too hopped up. Very typical of Troegs.. Really tasted like all hops with the smallest, faintest hint of chocolate malt in the very background. As the beer warmed, though, the hops were dulled down a bit, and the other flavors came through better. I love to support the locals...but this is one I'll pass on in the future. Their Nut Brown is much better, as is the Troegenator! Those are my two very favorites from Troegs...and my buddy's as well. Mad Elf isn't too bad, either. All the others seem way too hoppy. If you can try this for free...I'd do it. Otherwise, don't expect a normal porter with this one. Not my cup of tea. Think I'd rather have a cup of tea...with some brandy.

Smells faintly of roasted and crystal malts. Tasted like a brown ale with caramel and light roast malt flavors balanced by hops. Finishes with hop bitterness and a little more of the afore-mentioned malts. No decent coffee or chocolate notes like most porters I've had, but I don't think this could be called a porter by any stretch. It was like a mediocre brown ale eloped with a mediocre porter and had a homely baby. I had higher hopes for this one, because I am a fan of their oatmeal stout, so I know they have the skill to bring on the darkness. Do over!","dedrinker","Aug 31, 2007"

3.65,-3.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours an almost opaque brown darkness with a short wispy light tan head that fades slowly. A good amount of lacing, some 3D. It even smells DARK! A mild roasted malt and coffee aroma. It smells like it's going to be creamy, but that's not the case, IMO. Medium bodied, the mouth feel is adequately carbonated and conditioned by a major tingle from the hop that leads into a genuine bitterness in the flavor. The roasted malt taste is at first masked by the complexity of what's going on with the mouth bitterness. There is a delayed transition to the coffee flavor finish that lingers significantly. Interesting beverage. I can only manage one of these at a siting.","jjayjaye","Aug 16, 2007"

I also sampled this one on draught at the brewery, but I preferred this cask sample, and so i'll enter this review from my notes into the db here. Anyway, this one is very dark cocoa, brown, nearly opaque with a wonderful cascading head of casky, wish-washy, tan foam. The beer settles into a beautiful looking pint and the head lasts well and leaves wonderful lacing for a cask offering. Aromas are all dark roasted malts, chocolate, toffee, and caramel with some nice green, dank hops as well. Upfront taste is roasty, bitter, and almost astringent with soem lactic properties creeping in as well. The alpha acids and resiny flavor of the hops really make this one come together nicely. Very hoppy and super roasty, this one is the best of both worls with a wonderful cask mouthfeel, which is medium bodied and well structured. Drinkability is amazing as well. The brothers are damn proud of this one, as they should be, a real stand-out from a brewery that seems to have several stand-outs! Superb.","francisweizen","Jun 06, 2005"

4.5,18.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer poured a dark chocolate brown/black color that no color passed through. The cream that it produced was thick, rich, heavenly and light cocoa powder colored and long lasting, till the end of the glass, matter of fact after the last sip there was still a small amount of foam on the bottom that I was trying to force up the glass into my mouth. It produced a thick and sticky lace on the sides of the glass either in sheet forms or clumps the whole way to the bottom. The aromas that came from the glass were big and rich dark coffee, cappuccino, cocoa powders, dark chocolates, roasted nuts and malts, hops (flowers) and some caramel. The flavors were a reflection of the aromas just more pronounced and creamier. Tastes of hops (flowers), dark fruits (hints), earth tones, dry ash, caramel, coffee, roasted malts and nuts, some sweet malt, cocoa and bitter chocolate. The after taste was a dominant chocolate cappuccino. This beer was medium to a light heavy body. Slightly dry but fully creamy and satisfying. Great combination of flavors and tastes, an experience for all the senses. Creamy, rich, seductive (sure, why not), well balanced and a all around fabulous beer. I can see this being made year round in a year or two (I hope).","Jarod","0"
