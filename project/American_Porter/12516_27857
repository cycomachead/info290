3.91,3.2,4.5,4,3.75,3.75,4,"Overall: Porters are one of my favorite styles, but its hard for me to find one that i truly love. I usually stick with my top 3 (Eddy Fitz, Founders, Smuttynose), and Old Leghumper gives me justice as to why. Not enough balance between roasted and chocolate malts, and I get a stale quality to it. It also goes down like water and I prefer my beers to be full bodied. I consider this a third tier porter, under the 3 i previously listed as top tier, and Black Butte being second tier.

4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy very dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, biscuit, light coffee, herbal, floral, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate hop notes; with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, biscuit, caramel, light coffee, herbal, floral, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roast/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, biscuit, caramel, light coffee, herbal, floral, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors with light-moderate hop presence; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice porter. All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 05, 2014"

Almost medium bodied with normal carbonation. The flavor profile is nice and a bit complex. It begins with the dark malts delivering a caramel and coffee taste against a slightly sweet background, progresses to a slight roast bitterness and finishes cleanly with a carbonation burst with a hint of smoke. Quite nice!","tillmac62","Jan 31, 2014"

3.55,-6.3,4,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Overall I thought that this was a slightly above average American Porter that drank well on this cold and snowy night in Michigan. This was a pretty straightforward American Porter that was all about the roasted malts. This beer had Ok drinkability, this one went down smooth but I think after one the sweetness would start to get to me. What I liked most about this beer was the robust and chocolaty aroma and taste, it had just enough roast for the style and the added chocolate flavor was nice and made this beer stick out a little. What I liked least about this beer was the mouthfeel and the high amount of sweetness, the body and carbonation need some work and the sweetness got to be a little much once this beer warmed up. I wouldn't turn this beer down but I don't think I would buy it again, for the same price I can get Founders Porter and it is just as robust but not as sweet with a much better body. This is worth of a shot if your really like the style but I just don't thin it's a top tier American Porter. I was glad I gave this beer a try and it was pretty solid but there were more then a couple things that kept this from being a great American Porter, another solid example from Thirsty Dog, good job guys, I will be searching out more of your beers.","StoutHunter","Jan 29, 2012"

The carbonation was actually fine. I thought it was going to be a little flat due to the lack of head from the poor, but the carbonation was just right. I think this is a one and done beer for me.

The small, prickly carbonation was energizing but also largely distracting (even thought it also covered the moderately high alcohol level).

There was also a caramel sweetness that lurked in the background. Mouthfeel was good, but I prefer my porters to be a bit thicker.

It pours a translucent dark garnet-brown topped by about a finger of ecru foam. The nose comprises pepper, molasses, brown sugar, roasted and toasted malts, and a hint of sharp hoppy florals in the background. The taste forces the pepper and malts to the fore, backed by something akin to smoked leather and salmon (seriously...am I on acid...?). Some hoppy bitters lurk in the shadows, stabbing seemingly random passersby, but never really coming into the light. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lingering ashy finish. Overall, a decent porter, but the roast is a bit much, too far on the smokey side to be porter-ly effective.

The flavors were rich and chewy, starting with the aforementioned sweet malts then fading into elements of nuts, roasted malt and coffee. The finish has hints of hops and a general bitterness.

Nose is predominantly chocolate malt; intense off the cap, but much more diffuse in the glass. Taste consistent with nose with just the slightest hops bittering at the finish.

Fairly black body, with medium carbonation and topped with a finger of brownish head that manages to leave some light lacing, despite reducing to almost nothing. Chocolate, coffee and dark fruits are the predominant aromas, but are backed with a dash of hops and perhaps some anise. Tastes of coffee and chocolate with maybe some lactic notes, and green/spicy hops that impart a medium bitterness. It has a medium body with annoyingly high carbonation and imparts a decent finish. Not that bad of a porter - could be more robust though. And the carbonation was distracting, taking way too long to work itself down to a drinkable level.","mmmbeer","Feb 14, 2008"

I found this porter to be medium bodied with moderately low carbonation that combined to impart a smooth creaminess to the mouthfeel. Sweat roasted malt flavors blend beautifully with hints of caramel and a touch of alcohol and then finishes with a mild burnt dryness that is clean and well balanced.

On the palate the flavors are smooth but very robust -- this is an Americanized porter, with lots of roasted malt goodness, substantial bitterness from hops and malt, and big, heavy mouthfeel.

The initial tastes includes moderate chocolate and carmel tones that give way to a toasty coffee-like finish.

From what I saw when the bartender put the drink down was that it looked like they just had squeezed 100 black ink pens into a pint glass. It was that BLACK! Of course if they did squeeze 100 pens into my glass, then my beer wouldn't have had a 2 finger head of tan colored foam. I really couldn't tell what was going on in the smell. The aroma was on the light side with roasted dark malts with a hint of caramel in the background. That was nice and all, but for some reason the sweetness of the malts and the caramel mixed into what I believe was a minor sour smell. That minor sour aroma doesn't belong there. The taste was that of dark roasted malts, roasted nuts, and with a trace of sweet caramel at the end. I really couldn't taste any hops in the initial taste, but they did manage to show up in the aftertaste of the mouthfeel. Other than the hops in the mouthfeel, I thought it was a bit on the weak side. It wasn't as thick as I like my Porters to be. After all of that, I could see myself having another one of these on-tap.

The taste is mostly of a roasted coffee flavor, very delish in a typical porter style. The roasted malts can be tasted as well, with very little carbonation to interfere with the rich flavors being taken in. Aftertaste is of an oily nutty flavor. The mouthfeel is a little less than expected, it could be creamier and more full-bodied in my opinion.

Lighter in color than I like in a porter, it's almost copper with good head retention and decent lacing. Aromas are expectedly of black malt, cocoa, and coffee. Flavors bring out a moderatley malt sweetness with a touch of black malt without becoming charcoal like. The cocoa flavors take on a milk chocolate flavor, but not texture; instead of a prefered bitter-sweet cocoa. The coffee notes are soft--more of a cappucino flavor and bitter. Hopping is a bit aggressive for style, but not to bother. The texture is light for style, not quite watery, but light. The finish is a bit sweet and alcoholic. Never packs much of a punch.

The name alone demands that you try this beer.","AtLagerHeads","Sep 29, 2004"

2.82,-25.6,4,2,3,3,3,"Drinkability and overall: Easy going down but not very inspiring. A pretty average porter that got worse as it went. With all the good porters around here (especially Great Lakes) I see no reason to go back to this brew. I'll stick to their Russian Imperial Stout and go from there.","mattcrill","Sep 01, 2004"
4.37,15.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Slick feel as I took the first sip which brought good malt, chocolate, and coffee flavors. A slight tinge of bitterness from small amounts of hop followed up to make this one of my top porters.","Ahhdball","Aug 07, 2004"

4.1,8.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Wow. This was one of the best porters, right up there with my favorite. Of course, I'm comparing to Cumberland's Nitro Porter, so I prefer a creamier porter, but I know that is not true to porter style. This is about as accurate as it gets. It was dark, smelled robust, had faint coffee and chocolate flavors and finished above average. This is my third favorite beer brewed by Thirsty Dog and the best of the Ohio micros that I've tried.","Ricochet","Jul 10, 2004"

4.12,8.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Deeo dark brown with a small tan head that dies quickly. Superb aroma of roasted malts, chocolate, slightly herbal hops, and slight booze. A very balanced taste that starts off with slight hops and roasted malts. This is quickly followed up by some nice milk chocolate and weak coffee notes. The finish is dry, and to the point. The mouthfeel is creamy, but a tad thin and the drinkability is good. Nice stuff...","francisweizen","Jun 22, 2004"
4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a deep brown with no highlights. Small, tan head that stayed for a while. Smell is a nice roasted almost coffee-like note. Deep rich and robust here. You get some dark malt, combined with a nice roasty taste, with little hop flavor or bitterness. Slight coffe taste in the finish. Medium body with low carbonation. This is one of the best that T.D has to offer. Nice example of a robust porter.","Bierguy5","Jun 20, 2004"

3.73,-1.6,3.5,3,4,4,4,"This is pretty dark, especially for a porter, as it looks black from a distance. There wasnt a lot of light coming through even up close. Theres a weak roasty aroma. The flavor is roasty and not bad. Its a little sticky which makes for a nice mouthfeel.","aracauna","Jun 05, 2004"

4.14,9.2,5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"	A rich roasted malt aroma takes center stage. It also has a strong alcohol aroma to its bouquet. The taste begins sweet with a burnt coffee taste. Its odd; I cant really detect the alcohol in the taste. Ends with a roasted bitterness. Medium bodied mouthfeel that seems to fit the style to a tee. It leaves the mouth slightly coated. Overall a very good and drinkable porter. I will definitely be having this one again.","crackerpooch","Apr 12, 2004"
3.97,4.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Old Leghumper is good beer, all things considered. It has the flavor profile that I like (more chocolate than coffee, light on the hops) and has a reasonably full body. This is my first Thirsty Dog brew, but I look forward to trying more of their offerings. Love the label; the dog tags on the women's ankles are a nice touch. "So many legs... so little time!"","BuckeyeNation","Apr 02, 2004"
4.42,16.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This was definitely one of the ones I was looking forward to, and I wasn't disappointed. A sweet and fairly robust porter, and certainly amongst Thirsty Dog's best...one that I'd be glad to find bottles of!","beergeek279","Mar 15, 2004"
4.27,12.7,3.5,4,4.5,5,4,"Drinkability - a wonderful robust porter, I could salt away 3 or 4 of these, but will instead spread them out over several evenings to prolong the goodness.","brewdlyhooked13","Mar 01, 2004"
4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"No best by date on the label, but let me say the label is classic shows a black dog chilling among a group of shapely legs and states.."So many legs... So little time!". That's good stuff the appearance is dark black with ruby highlights peeking through around the edges with a large massive tan head leaves specks of sporadic lacing. Aroma: Chocolate and coffe tones with the dark roasted malts just doing there thing along with a mild hop tone thrown in. Taste: Is a robust creamy barrage of milk chocolate and mild coffee excellent fullness to the flavor with a tad of finishing hops here great porter. Mouthfeel: Full bodied texture very nice and slightly chewy to me even carbonation good stuff. Drinkability: A classic session porter very similar to Crooked River's Robust porter which I really miss seeing around the Morgantown area.","WVbeergeek","Mar 01, 2004"
4.32,14,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"To begin with, the name alone earns this beer some positive points. Fortunately, the beer itself is not a let down either. I've had this beer both at the brewery itself as well as in bottles once they became available. The aroma has definite hints of coffee and a maltiness. The taste is at first a settle chocolate flavor followed by an aftertaste of coffee. You can taste the maltiness from beginning to end. I think this is a good beer to start out the night with because it is a little heavier being a porter. This beer also scores points for its great taste even from a bottle as opposed to a draught from the actual brewery. Great label too! "So many legs, so little time!" Indeed!","drifter","Feb 28, 2004"
3.65,-3.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured extremely dark ruby red, almost black color that formed a medium tan foamy head that receded quickly and left trace lace. It had an aroma of malt, chocolate and a touch of coffee. The flavor was of malt, coffee and a touch of chocolate. A bit of a bitter finish with a somewhat light body for this style. Not a bad porter.","Wildman","Feb 07, 2004"
3.32,-12.4,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"A dark brown with tints of red. Very little head and almost no lacing. The smell was of bittersweet chocolate and almost a raisin aroma. Tastes even more like raisins and chocolate but is entirely too sweet in my mind. The aftertaste is again a lingering sweetness that I wasn't looking for. This wasn't a bad beer but it wasn't that great either. It seemed to be missing the full body that I associate with porters.","stewart124","Jan 30, 2004"
3.78,-0.3,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Very dark porter with a thin but dark tan head. Try looking through one during the next solar eclipse. There is a slight hint of maple (someone at Thirsty Dog must be a fan of Sammy's Triple Bock). Good mouthfeel and flavor. I definitely enjoyed it but could not spend the night drinking these. Don't serve it too cold, it really became much more flavorful as it warmed up.","bigbubba","Nov 13, 2003"
4.13,9,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"A very good, smooth drinkable porter. It doesn't have that burnt bakers chocolate bite but was it does have makes it smooth and appealing. It pours black with a contained cascading head. Lace is not much at best. The aroma of roasted coffee. the taste also coffee like with chocolate, malt and slight hop. A smooth hop oil mouthfeel is left making this porter almost cream like. I like cream in my coffee, so this is a porter i'll go with time in time again.","chilidog","Sep 01, 2003"

3.72,-1.8,5,3,4,4,3.5,"This brew pours a small head of dark brown colored bubbles and an opaque black brown colored body. It had a mild malt aroma. It was very smooth and had a mild coffee flavor.

4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"How can you not order this beer when the advertising poster shows a black lab in a roomfull of nicely legged ladies, only shown from the waist down, and the caption "So many legs, so little time."  Presented as a robust porter, but it was pretty restrained, more like an English porter.  Deeply roasted malts with nice flavor, but lacked enough "uumph" from the hops to be robust.  So little time.","Brent","Nov 08, 2001"
