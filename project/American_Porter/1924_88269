You may be able to pair this with something else like ice cream or maybe a burger, but even then I'm not sure about that.  I'm of two minds on this beer - the aroma is great and its a neat treat, and yet one I'm finding is more than enough with this beer - I'm not inclined to have more.  It could be that because I had this after being already full from dinner that this is just too much, so I need to give it another try next time I find it, it for no other reason than to savor that amazing aroma.  So a good beer, but maybe to extreme for me.  I've had other dessert beers that I finished and wanted more - not this one though.","damndirtyape","Feb 28, 2015"

Chocolaty sweetness, roasted nuts, black malt, and some earthy hop bitterness.  Medium body with some creaminess, finishing dry.  I could drink a few of these.","wedge","Jan 17, 2015"
3.19,-15.8,3,3.25,3.25,2.75,3.25,"   Chocolate and Peanut Butter is one of my favorite flavor combinations, and I would like to find a beer that is a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup in a beer as a dessert beer. This is an enjoyable beer, but the chocolate and the peanut flavor needs to be increased by a factor of 3. The peanut flavor is not really peanut butter  so much as dry roasted peanuts.  Mouth feel-wise, I would like the beer to be thicker and more creamy in texture. I would like to try this on draft to see if the chocolate and peanut flavors are more pronounced.","JebBeerFish","Jan 17, 2015"

For a dessert beer, I have not had much better. The smell of this beer is near perfection. Taste of the chocolate and peanut butter is not far behind. Only gripe is the porter is a tad bit watery, would be better with a thicker, smoother stout feel. Also, you really could only take down one or two of this in a session. However, when it comes to dessert drinks, this is top notch.","Antc2382","Jan 16, 2015"

The color is fine, but the body is a little light for a porter, I expected this to just sit in my stomach. You could definitely taste the peanuts, but something was still missing. It's ok, give it a try...but someone will (and may already) make a better version.","MarkQ617","Nov 11, 2014"

I did enjoy it, but everything about the peanut butter screams artificial. I think I would have preferred more chocolate and less peanut butter. i could only drink one of these as a desert beer, and have to wash it down with a good IPA. The body is also thin and watery, but after all said and done it is a solid brew for what it is intended to be.","Bone53","Oct 05, 2014"

Strong roasted malt backbone, starts sweet but finishes slightly bitter.  Can definitely taste peanut butter and chocolate.  Fairly medium bodied.

Amazingly the aroma slowly transfer to the taste as it warms up which is followed by some dark mild toasted malt and caramel. Palate is a full smooth and creamy body. The finish is more of the same but gets slightly richer as it warms up some more some mild bitter notes for balance. Overall a very tasty chocolaty peanut butter flavored brew. Very enjoyable to drink.","Samp01","Sep 29, 2014"

4.09,7.9,3.75,4,4,4.5,4.25,"I initially passed on buying this beer when I first saw it. I didn't think peanut flavors in a beer would work, even with a porter or stout. Surprisingly, DuClaw pulls it off exceptionally well. The look and feel are what would be expected in a porter, dark, light carbonation, medium body. Somewhat disappointingly, the head is on the small side and there is little lace. The peanuts come out predominantly in the aroma and in the taste middle to finish, where it is secondary to the roasted malt. The roast characteristics are more traditional porter, much lighter than some of the more recent "super" porters, such as Founder's Porter, that drink more stout like. The finish is mildly bittersweet, perhaps a bit too mild, with a bit of peanut earthiness.","LittleDon","Sep 27, 2014"

3.25,-14.2,,,,,,"Thinnish half finger head, doesn’t stick around long, a dusting across the surface, the lacing slides off in slippery sheets. Opaque dark brown liquid, turns to a rust orange near the surface which allows you to see how much chunky particulate there is inside, a few beads of bubbles visible. The nose is almost entirely peanut butter, some chocolate powder, has some roast but basically you might as well open a jar of Skippy and put your nose in it. Light to medium-bodied, carbonated attack prevents it from soaking into the mouth, weak finish. Here the peanut butter is just as strong, chocolate and maybe it is psychological but there’s also grape jelly. Burnt roastiness, lactose and challah bread along with sweeter nuts. Actually wish it was sweeter so it would have a clearer purpose when consumed. Lacks smooth flow and tends to gum up from front palate to rear. One trick pony that is fun once and that’s about it.","farrago","Aug 24, 2014"

Its really more of a nutty presence than peanut butter, but a nice touch nonetheless. I like the fact they steered clear of hops for the most part, it would have ruined the nice sweet, chocolaty profile they were aiming for. Mouthfeel is decent, but I wouldnt mind a little more viscosity. Low carbonation is about right for this kind of beer. I like this, quite a bit actually...I would definitely recommend this.","twiggamortis420","Jul 10, 2014"

3.79,0,3.75,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"I used my usual heavy-handed pour if for no other reason than to get a pseudo-cascade rolling in the glass. This produced not quite two fingers of dense, deep-tan head with good retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. I found the nose to be more muted than the Horny Goat. Here, the chocolate was more prevalent with the peanut butter underlying it, which struck me as being perhaps more palatable. Mouthfeel was medium, thinner that the Horny Goat, but more in line with what I expect in a Porter. The taste was unexpectedly rich and here I was reminded of my paternal grandmother's birthday cake icing, usually on Devil's Food Cake. She would buy frosting mix (do they even sell that any more?) and mix it up in a mixing bowl using a mixer, and once it achieved a certain creaminess, she would add in chunky peanut butter to thicken it and then slather it on the cake. As a kid, I really looked forward to birthdays at our house, but now, I would probably find it too sweet. Now, to clarify on this one - it was sweet, yes, but not as sweet as the Horny Goat. The finish was semi-dry, at most, but there was still a good bit of sweetness lingering in evidence well past the swallow. Just like with the Horny Goat, this would be a one-and-done for me, but given a choice, I would take this one before a Horny Goat simply because it just was not quite as sweet. More damning with faint praise, I suppose.","woodychandler","Jun 30, 2014"

The peanuty nose got my expectations really high! And then I tasted it....oh god.. it's like burnt toast drizzled with acid... not even remotely like peanuts or chocolate for that matter. Prickly carbonation and unnatural chemicaly flavors feel like they are leaving mild burns in my mouth. It gets worse as it warms up. The smell is only there to tease me as to how good this beer could/should have been juxtaposed with this abomination. I got about halfway through the bottle and couldn't take it any more... one of my very few drain pours. I'll give it this much, it's unique, but that doesn't make it any good.

Nose on this beer is great - think peanut butter cups with just a hint of roast. Taste follows nose; however, not as bold as the nose and a little watery. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light) with a light, even carbonation, a thin body and a slight oiliness. Overall, a pretty decent porter - great nose, but falls apart in the flavor profile and mouthfeel. A decent porter, but nothing to write home about.","Jwale73","Jun 22, 2014"

Then anytime I had a brownie or any chocolate dessert, I added a dollop of peanut butter. I want to say I prefer Big Gruesome over this, which I have also reviewed, but I'd really have to try them back to back.","EvoRich","Jun 09, 2014"

3.74,-1.3,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"peanut butter is a gnarly ingredient in beer. i mean, brilliant, but when do you add it? i can't see it working in a mash, maybe in a bright tank, but wouldn't it all congeal all weird in the cold and not impart much flavor? if it was added hot, wouldn't it melt and make a greasy beer with no ability to hold a head? lots of questions, and this beer doesn't answer a single one, but i like it for trying. i think my problem with this one is the base beer, not a real robust or full enough bodied porter for the flavors its trying to support. nutty not the nose, more peanuts than peanut butter per se, which I'm fine with, and a cocoa finish. bitter malt and maybe a little over hopped in the taste, but i like the integration of the peanut flavor. more chocolate would help this i think, as would m,pre body on the base beer, but the level of roast is nice and works with the nut complex, and the carbonation is there. seems like it was fermented a little too arm or something, i get a slight staleness to the yeast, but other than that, i enjoyed this quite a lot. could use a few tweaks, but a very cool use of a tricky and perplexing ingredient.","StonedTrippin","Jun 07, 2014"

Aromas of full bore peanut butter on the nose. Seriously, it's like you just dove into the middle of a Reese's cup. Holy shit. If you really dig in there, you can get some chocolate highlights, but this bad boy is almost entirely PB on the nose. Flavors fall off a bit, but still solid, with a blast of bittersweet baker's chocolate followed rapidly by a wave of that same peanut butter character. This is one of the better applications of the peanut butter characteristic that I have encountered in the beer world. The body is light, crisp, and dry, with a rich, sweet, roasted peanut butter and chocolate aftertaste. This is a goddamn liquid candy bar. The finish is slick, clean, and dry. Amazing beer...it really is perfect for a candy loving fat guy like myself. What a fun brew!","GarthDanielson","May 31, 2014"

Really not an enjoyable drink and one that i struggled to finish. You can probably get a sample of this at a growler station, even a single purchase will make you doubt judgement later. Im pretty close in scoring to the ba average for a great deal of time, but this one i just cant agree with.

I like that it's nicely balanced, not too much of any flavor, and still a beer first. Too unusual to be a session beer, but tasty and easy to drink nonetheless.","TappaKeggaBrew","Mar 18, 2014"
4.01,5.8,3.5,5,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Didn't plan on reviewing this until I opened the bottle and got that smell. Here we go. The pour is a dark brown, very thin, whatever small head there was went fast. Seems very carbonated and bubbly. The smell is huge in peanut butter, with chocolate in there, as well. It's smells great. Like a candy bar or dessert. Peanut butter upfront on the taste, not a lot of chocolate, though. A faint hint of bitter chocolate, and a little roastiness. It's very thin and carbonated, just how I expected it to be. There is a bitter aftertaste which isn't my favorite. Overall, a nice beer and a good change if you are looking for something new.","Mikeypnh","Mar 18, 2014"

It smells like chocolate and peanut butter with hints of cream and oat. The taste is all over the map for me. I am not necessarily saying it's a bad thing, but from a taste perspective, I feel there is too much too fast in this beer. You have the chocolate, the peanut butter and other flavors fighting for your attention, and they were at times too much. I think this would be a great dessert beer and I won't say I'd never order it again... but it's not at the top of my list.","tmbgnicu","Mar 15, 2014"

Sweet milk/cream, peanut butter, chocolate, almonds, Reese's peanut butter cup to be exact. Taste carries over much of the peanut butter chocolate and sweetened milk/cream.

This beer reminded me of a peanut butter snack food that I used to eat as I kid, but I just couldn't put my finger on exactly what it was. It was a medium body with some carbonation.

Good head, lots of tiny bubbles, and decent lacing. Nose is perhaps the best thing going on here -- more chocolate, toffee, caramel, vanilla, coffee notes than peanut butter. On the palate, the same flavors dominate, although peanut butter does appear. Reminds me a little of the taste you have in your mouth at the end of a baseball game after eating a bag of roasted peanuts (which is also slightly bummer). But the biggest problem with this beer is the absence of character in the mouthfeel -- it's just a little too thin. Nevertheless, glad I tried it.","JohnParadee","Dec 28, 2013"

The beer is dark, nearly black, with a thin tan head. The aroma is outstanding. Nutty, with lots of chocolate...literally, it is like smelling a chocolate bar with almond and walnuts. Some underlying malt and a little coffee notes contribute to the smell. The taste is slightly sweet, with plenty of balancing bitterness. The nut and chocolate tones continue through the taste.

This was bottled on 1/29/14, guess what it looks ruby cola deep brown, with a nice tan mocha head forming nicely. Fine speckled bands of lacing, great looking beer sitting in my glass. Aromatics are peanut butter to the core, think peanut skins and Jiff. Wonderful smell A+ there's not a better smelling beer around with this much similarity to a Reese's peanut butter cup!!! Flavor is dry finished with the peanut butter/dark dry chocolate notes coming forth, I'm glad it has these flavors without stepping into the dessert beer/diabetes realm like some of the Southern Tier Choklat and Crème Brule overt sweetness. There's a natural roasted malt finish with lingering salty peanut notes between sips, man I dig this beer. The first time I had it was a couple months back at Caliente in Bloomfield. Nice to see they are getting distribution in PA at Giant Eagle Market District. Mouthfeel is slick with peanut butter oils and medium bodied with even flowing carbonation it just works, I drained my glass faster than I should but damn it's so good and I thankfully have 5 left!","WVbeergeek","Nov 20, 2013"

Notes of toasted cocoa are up front. Very smooth. There is a nice sweetness. First you taste a cocoa, but that fades to the peanut butter. Almost like liquid Reece's. I say god damn! So many people have tried and failed, but this one tastes like a liquid Reece's peanut butter cup and that's amazing. Will add to my regular rotations for sure.","JeffBrenner","Oct 01, 2013"

I'm deathly allergic to peanut butter, so I was extremely tentative (with meds in hand). Anyway, when I did, it had a coke color with virtually no head and thin lacing. The smell was of nuts, but not peanuts to me, but then again, I don't have the most accurate sense of smell when it comes to peanuts- since I'm usually getting the willies when I smell them. It also smelled like a porter, but I didn't pick up on the chocolate. The taste was nutty. It reminded me of fresh hazelnuts and was pretty tasty. The only hint of chocolate came on the aftertaste. The beer had a thin mouthfeel, but the carbonation made up for it in spades. Would I have it again? You bet.","BuzzLitebier","Sep 22, 2013"

Color is a translucent cola-black with just a bit of latte foam colored head. Smells of roasty malt, chocolate and peanut shells (not particularly sweet) and maybe a hint of cola/vanilla. Taste is big and bready, with dark chocolate type tannins--no real peanut butter to speak of beyond the nose. Surprisingly crisp finish. Silky, slightly viscous mouthfeel almost like a barleywine with a surprising amount of carbonation.

Looks like a great porter with a black body, one finger tan head, some lace and to bastardize I'll say it has an aroma similar to a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup (or any PB cup, to be honest). From there I felt it went down south after that. Smooth, light to medium body that is slightly chewey and bready but quite frankly the peanut butter and chocolate tastes are muddy. It's more like a watered down (with alcohol) peanut butter cup milkshake. I didn't have trouble finishing my pint but I couldn't bother with this again. Also there's a hoppy bitterness and crispness that I wish was more subdued since this is supposed to be a sweet beer, or at least sweeter than your regular beer (even porter).","clayrock81","Sep 01, 2013"

Soapy wet lace. The nose is peanuts. Dry roasted peanuts, a little salty. Reminds one of a reeses peanut butter cup. Some milk chocolate comes through as it warms and some dark fruits. No alcohol on the nose. There is a little tiny hint of floral way in back. This has a great malt toasty smell too. Taste is peanuts and more peanuts. Follows the nose all the way. The body of this beer is thinner than you would expect from the smell and not very creamy. Malt is deep and has some toast, roast and unsweetened chocolate to go with all those peanuts. Little hint of vanilla. It finishes dry and with some hop bitter on the back palate and in the aftertaste. The dark fruits are lost to the peanuts but they are there in the background as a touch of earth. There is even a little hay on the palate. It’s salty like peanuts and warms slightly as you sip it. This was very enjoyable beer. Unique and very smooth. It’s as though they took your favorite candy bar and made it into a beer.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

It smells ok, but it doesn't taste anything like it smells. The reason people buy this is the combination of its interesting name and the idea of having a beer that tastes like chocolate and peanut butter (nutella for the most part). This is my first DuClaw and I live in MD. They have just never attracted me, with their graphic design or reputation. I'll stick to Flying Dog. This got a drain pour, since I was already stocked up on beer bread. I probably could have gone with an even lower score.","gillagorilla","Apr 27, 2013"

The flavor of the malt is almost biscuit-like in that it has a dry quality, with some oily dry peanut butter taste in the finish.

Perhaps it might taste a little bit better fresher with the hops being a little bit more prevalent, coffee being stronger, and overall flavors being bolder. Overall a decent beer but probably not something that I'd be seeking out again even if it was fairly easily attainable in my area.","jaasen64","Feb 17, 2013"

Peanut butter up front, some chocolate next, a hint of bitterness at the finish. Well done. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a quality brew worth seeking out.","tone77","Feb 16, 2013"
3.96,4.5,4,4.25,4,3.5,3.75,"Dark brown-black pour with a monstrously creamy off-white head about three fingers thick; nice retention and blankets of lacing. (Note: this was a keg kicker.) Aroma was pretty much straight up Reese's pie. Not much else to say other than "yum." The taste reflected the nose, peanut butter, sweet chocolate, toasted bread, a bit of roast in the finish. The body was the weak point here. It was pretty smooth, but also pretty thin, and that caused the otherwise great taste to weaken after a few sips. It was still a good beer overall, and possibly the best I've had from DuClaw. This would probably be a great nitro beer.","Rifugium","Feb 15, 2013"
4.06,7.1,4,4.25,4,4,4,"A dark brown body with a creamy tan head. Some mild spider web lacing left behind as the cap falls to a thin layer. Robust porter notes of dark malts, cocoa, and roast with a layer of peanut butter over top. Strong peanut nose. On the palate, milk chocolate/cocoa rolls over the palate first with medium roast coming through mid palate and peanut butter quickly in tow. The finish is some lingering sweet chocolate, peanut butter, and mild roast. Smooth, creamy feel with low carbonation. A little on the lighter side of medium bodied. I've had a couple of these chocolate/peanut butter beers lately and this is easily the most peanut forward and tasty of the bunch.","ColForbinBC","Feb 11, 2013"

I make a special trip down from Delaware every few months to try DuClaws brews (hopefully they start shipping to upstate Delaware soon) and they might miss on one or two, but this one was just as advertised and a home run in my opinion!!!","greyghost86","Feb 09, 2013"

The aroma is certainly the highlight here, but the flavor doesn't really disappoint for an experimental-type brew. The peanut butter works pretty well, although I probably wouldn't drink more than one of these in a sitting. I highly recommend trying it so you can judge for yourself. I am happy I picked up a few bottles, but I won't be rushing back to the store for a case.","NoLeafClover44","Feb 04, 2013"

The retention is thin, the lacing is scattered. The smell of this beer is loaded with roasted peanuts and dark malts. The taste of the beer is chocolatey with a really good peanut flavor in there too. The mouthfeel of the beer is smooth, kind of light bodied and smooth. Overall this beer was pretty good. It's more of a dessert beer but it's not overwhelmingly sweet. It's interesting though. I like it.","Knapp85","Jan 25, 2013"
