After drinking this one I think I have found a new favorite.  You can absolutely taste the vanilla and the coffee flavor is a little more pronounced than in other porters.  The mouth feel is nice and thick an heavy.  The smell is almost like that of an Irish coffee.  This is a great beer to try if you are a fan of the Leinenkugel's Snowdrift Vanilla Porter.","Harry-Porter","Feb 08, 2015"

Pours fairly crystal clear very dark brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, brown bread, vanilla, light nuttiness, light herbal, and toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and coffee/vanilla spice notes; with decent strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, vanilla, toast, brown bread, light nuttiness, light herbal, and toasted earthiness. Light coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, vanilla, toast, brown bread, light nuttiness, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good complexity and solid robustness of dark/roasted malt and vanilla/coffee spice flavors; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very solid spiced porter style. All around good robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/roasted malt and vanilla/coffee spice flavors; and very smooth and easy to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 12, 2014"

Another go at the case on a different night had me pour out 3 of them because they seemed flat/tasteless. Of the ones that seem ok, the mouth feel is a bit watery. Vanilla extract is prominent. Coffee? I don't taste much coffee, maybe it is the base and the vanilla is up front, I don't know. I am concerned with what I feel is a lack of consistency bottle to bottle. If I didn't waste so many already, I'd probably return the case, although I have never had to do that before. If I had to give advice, I'd say avoid it. The best I have tasted in this category is Wolaver's Alta Gracia Coffee Porter. Breckenridge Vanilla Porter is also solid, but no coffee there.","DannyMick131","Nov 19, 2014"

Notes of chocolate wave throughout. More vanilla than coffee, which makes me happy. Probably my second favorite from Atwater, as I like the voodoo, as well.","barczar","Jun 25, 2014"

It's also better than the last Atwater I had yesterday (so is just about every other beer I've had in the past couple months). But as a porter, it's just not particularly successful. Not only does the dominant flavor come off as artificial, there's literally nothing else to it. Dare I say it tastes like a porter that would come from Blue Moon or Shock Top? Yep, I'm totally saying it. It's going to take a lot for Atwater to get back in my good graces after 2 stinkers.","ThisWangsChung","Jun 09, 2014"

It's not that things smell off, they just smell somewhat artificial, somewhat ill-fitting. I dunno. The taste holds notes of light roasted malts, fake vanilla, light vinyl, and a twinge of toasted marshmallow. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a thinly fluid feel. Overall, this stuff has definitely gone downhill since I first tried it those few years ago. It's overly thin, thoroughly artificial, and even a bit plastic-y.

Smells of vanilla and coffee beans as you would expect. Nothing more to the smell other than that. It tastes literally EXACTLY like a Medium-Dark coffee would. Lots of java, Lot's of coffee flavor, With a hint of chocolate and a TON of vanilla. In fact, This beer is so delicious that I didn't even want to swallow it. I wanted that vanilla flavor to last forever. The mouthfeel is pretty thin, No other flavors come through other than the ones I have stated. Over all I was very impressed with this, I figured I'd end up giving the 6 pack away. And hell, I got these beers for free so it was an absolute steal.

Pours a matte black with little head or lacing. Great vanilla aroma, but I'm, you know, into that. A little thin on the mouthfeel, but not bad. Really good flavor dominated by the vanilla at first, but with the coffee, and some chocolatey note at the end. Good stuff.","Sdesenberg","Apr 11, 2012"

Smell is roasty sugars (vanilla) and definite chocolate character. Taste follows with mild bitterness and complimenting vanilla and chocolates. Still a bit light bodied for me to want all the time but the carbonation makes it creamy. The friend debated on a 6 pack, and given her tastes i think it would have been a great purchase.

A little too mild on the level of carbonation. A dark grain bitterness resides on the tongue accented by the alcohol warmth.

It tastes very, very good, but it's so sweet that it would be very tough to drink more than one. Like most porters it does have the smokey flavor at the as an aftertaste, which is relieves the sweetness a little. Because it's so sweet, it really effects the mouth feel and drink ability.

The flavors were dominated by the espresso-like richness of coffee roasted malt sweetness in the middle and a biter coffee finish again at the end.

Taste is much more subdued than the nose and somewhat disappointing considering the boldness of the nose. Also detected a little bit of a citrus-quality, which threw the coffee flavor completely off.

Fortunately, as it warmed the green pepper like flavor receded. This left me with something that was coffee flavored and there was a hint of vanilla too.

This seems to be a beer with a lot of promise and potential... this means that it really isn't there yet. Opens up with a burst of roasted grains and coffee, with back-up notes of cocoa and cream. The color is a nearly opaque, dark brown with a somwhat fizzy head retention. Robust looking, jut a bit flat. The flavors are bold charcoal and coffee, but little after that. The vanilla is barely detected and there seems to be an overbearing coffee / fermentation sourness that won't let any other nuances shine enough to make a difference. The beer seems under-malted, which hurts the flavor roundedness and textrues. The beer is fast fleeting, leaving a powdery, dry coating and lingering coffee bitterness.
