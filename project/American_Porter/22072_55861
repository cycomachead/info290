Pours fairly cloudy nearly opaque dark brown color with a 1 finger fairly dense tan head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin ring of lace that lingers. Minimal lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, raisin, plum, cocoa, roasted malt, light coffee, caramel, toast, dark bread, light char, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good complexity of dark/roast/bready malt notes with light-moderate fruitiness; with solid strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, dark bread, light coffee, herbal, light raisin/plum, and toasted earthiness. Light herbal/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, dark bread, light coffee, light raisin/plum, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of dark/roast/bready malt flavors with light yeast fruitiness; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice porter. Good balance and robustness of dark/roast/bready malt flavors with light yeast fruitiness; and very smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 01, 2014"

Smells like roasted malts, chocolate, and some noticeable hops to me. Thought it was going to be like Jose Marti from Cigar City. Dont get hops with taste though, which is fine by me. A little boozy, and a hair on the sweet side. Mouthfeel is wet. Easy drinking enough. Reminds me of Samuel Smith's Taddy a little bit. Nice roasted flavor with a little coffee/smoke at the end. Not going to compete with Great Lakes Fitzgerald, Rogue Mocha, or Deschutes Black Butte, but overall a very good porter that I would recommend trying.","WesMantooth","Feb 13, 2014"

Settling, it turned into one of the most unsettling beers ever. It was as dark as night in the middle of the ocean. SRM = 44+. I think that the Kraken may have been at the bottom of the glass. It was so deep-brown and dark that even the white bits was black. Nose was rich, like a chocolate cake made with dark chocolate. Velvety, chocolaty, but with a charcoal smokiness that just put me over the top. Mouthfeel was medium, but with a silkiness that reinforced the cake analogy. My, my, my. Finish was smoky, chocolaty, like my 5th (or so) birthday cake. More, please.","woodychandler","Aug 21, 2013"

Here's the Revolution Brewing canned Eugene Porter with one of my favorite Pete Johnson blended cigars, this is his and his brothers project which translates as the workshop...I guess it's a way for them to branch out their creativity even more and involve his family in the business away from his Tatuaje lines. Anyways here's the beer, pours a pitch black body with absolutely no ruby highlights seeping through this thing eats the visible light spectrum up, light tan head forms thick and dwindles slow with minimal patchy streaked lacing around the sides of my nonic pint glass. First up the nares are filled with a deep dark chocolate creaminess minimal earthy pine accented hops peak through the waves of dark kilned barley. Really nice dry porter leaving the drinkability factor really high, I get dark chocolate roasts mild espresso with a hint of dark cherry fruit peaking through ending in a creamy velvet decadent place on my palate. Flavor wise I like the way the alcohol and the dark beer features dark roasts, earthy hops, and hints of fruit intermingle so nicely with a 6.8% abv canned porter this place ain't kidding around it's a revolution. Furthermore, I'm glad I'm adding some flavorful smokes to the mix because the synergy of both worlds is really complementing the overall experience mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with dark dry roasted malt finish lingering roasted malt bitterness and hops in the backend with a bit of warming effect left between sips from the higher abv in this American aggressive porter.","WVbeergeek","Apr 21, 2013"

The brew smells like roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, and some dark fruit. It tastes like roasted malt, dark fruit, caramel, bittersweet chocolate and some light hops.

The smell starts with big bold waves of chocolate and roasted barley. A touch of cream comes through next and smooths things out. Then comes a reasonably aromatic hop profile that adds a little pine to the mix. The taste has some sweetness up front with a heavy malt profile. Dry roasted grains, bitter chocolate, and some piney hops (Chinook?) balance things out. The flavors pop and provide for a very robust porter. Mouthfeel is smooth and appropriately carbonated. Overall, this is one of my favorite porters around, the only thing that competes with it is Founders Porter. This is a solid beer and an awesome value at $10 per six pack. This has become a mainstay in the fridge, enough said.","homebrew311","Dec 06, 2012"

This beer was named "Best beer in Chicago" in 2010. I don't recall who named it that, but I don't necessarily disagree. I've had this on tap, on cask, and even Bourbon Barrel Aged... it just won't stop being awesome. It's 7% abv is quite well hidden (8.5% in the BBA version I believe), and if it's fairly big body wasn't there to slow you down, you could easily find yourself quite over-served after more than two or three.

It is fairly thick but not nearly as chewy as the Founders Porter (my current benchmark for the style). Definitely the best beer they had on tap for their opening.","philberinghele","0"
