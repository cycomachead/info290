No big bottle Imperials, etc. in this mix. Wouldn't be a fair fight.]  Color is black, opaque with light (hardly discernible) carbonation. Slight smoke roast in the nose with an initial coffee-like flavor on the tongue, subtle bitterness, soft (very soft) carbonation and a light mouthfeel that actually benefited this very dark beer.  No astringent or off tastes. Deep roasted malt flavor that didn't linger after each sip. Quite refreshing and drinkable. I was pleasantly surprised.  I set this at just over 3.6 overall as a benchmark. We'll see how the other 5 stack up.","tugdriver7","Feb 23, 2015"

The looked is okay it has good color but was lacking in the head department and looked way to carbonated to me. The smell is a little hard for me to explain so I'm just going to say that I found it unpleasant and way to reminiscent of something like bud light. Here is my biggest problem, the taste. Now porters and shouts are by far my favorite types of beer, they are like liquid dessert to me. This beer has not one quality of the many porters I have had in my days. The taste to me is a sour and minerally. The feeling I found to be over carbonated, water, and dry (not actually sure if that belongs here). Anyways overall from first drink to the last I didn't enjoy this beer.","Drevis","Dec 31, 2014"

It puts you in the mind of black coffee, with a light foam head. The smell is rich with grains and some sweetness. Now for the taste it is thick but smooth tasting. There is a lot going on in this brew. At first there is a bold rich taste but it is clean and smooth at the end. The is a real nice balance to this brew. The mouthfeel is nice and clean with no bad aftertaste. Yuengling did a nice job with this brew. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out of 5. I would get this again.","nicholas2121","Aug 02, 2014"

3.79,12.8,3,4,3.75,3.5,4,"DATE TASTED: December 19, 2013... GLASSWARE: Guinness pint...OCCASION: prep for The Desolation of Smaug with a review of another old favorite... APPEARANCE: as expected dark black with a dragon's red eye when held to the light; head is two-fingered at the start; brown slush settles quickly; zero lacing.. AROMA: caramel, chocolate, and vanilla with some peaty notes--a rugged and ready mix of winter scents... PALATE: slick, medium-bodied; drinkable and soda-esque...TASTE: sugary slightly chocolaty and smoky, with some lactic presence too--a balanced, pleasant experience...OVERALL: like The Hobbit\, this beer doesn't disappoint, despite repeated viewings--er, tastings--and though the critic in me knows bigger, bolder, more unique porters exist, I find Yuengling's version more sessionable, less demanding and in line with the spirit of the genre--fortified ale for the working man...","dacrza1","Dec 26, 2013"

The original spelling of his last name must have been Jüngling, meaning "young man". In fact, the English word youngling comes from jüngling. But, despite what they say at their web site, jüngling is not pronounced "ying-ling". That certainly makes it sound oritental, doesn't it?","nofunyons","Aug 17, 2013"

Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch tan head that didn't stay around for too long. There isn't much lacing, either. The brew smells like roasted malt, caramel, bittersweet chocolate and some grain. It tastes like roasted and grainy malt, and some light coffee, chocolate, and dark fruit. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a little bit slick with good carbonation. It's not exactly a robust porter, but it is smooth and easy to drink. For the price, it's a decent, drinkable brew. If you're looking for a porter that's very easy to drink, this is a good pick.","bluejacket74","Feb 22, 2013"

There is also a vanilla and molasses aroma that comes out as the beer warms. Taste is much the same with a slight tartness and a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer that smells better than it tastes in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Nov 06, 2012"

Aromas of raisin, roasted grain, chocolate, light coffee, and light herbal. Ok aromas with decent balance and weak strength. Taste of chocolate, roasted grain, toast, biscuit, caramel, light coffee, light fruits, and light herbal spiciness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, roasted malt, toast, caramel, and light herbal on the finish for a short bit. Solid flavor balance, but does not feel very robust as a porter should be; no cloying flavors at all after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy mouthfeel that is ok. This was quite thin feeling. Alcohol is well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a decent porter. This was not as robust as I would expect from the style; but the flavor profile is good, though a bit weak; and is still quite enjoyable and easy to drink.","superspak","Oct 21, 2012"

Even the standard and fairly cheap darkish beer in Upstate New York, Saranac Black and Tan, is superior for taste and complexity.","tiltedglass","Oct 19, 2012"

Light aroma, but not nominal, mostly light caramel notes with a background of pale two-row and roast with a hint of cereal adjunct. Roasted notes and deep caramel on the tongue, with a background pale malt backbone and mild roasty bitterness. Aftertaste has a lingering roast note that is quite nice, and a moderate caramel flavor than hangs on through a mildly drying finish. Very mild earthy hops, maybe English or just light on the late additions and heavy on a solid balancing bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium with mild carbonation that leaves the palate slightly dry but allows a good malt presence to be established. High drinkability due to lighter body and a mouthfeel with a cleansing aftertaste that is not overly dry or devoid of residual sweetness from the malt. Great Porter for the price; and best interpreted a mixture of the English and American styles.","PBRstreetgang","Jun 04, 2012"

This porter had very little complexity, and tasted simply very watered down. I find it difficult to believe that it can be justified as a true "porter", in the traditional sense. I suppose that many Bud Light drinkers would find it a challenge to drink it, but those used to top rated porters will likely be disappointed. It appears that the motivation for the brewer to place this brew along side their lager is more for marketing (in the larger retail sense) and less a decision based up the promotion of real quality. Perhaps it will fill a need for the masses who are just starting to experiment with..."dark". I will not buy it again, in spite of its relatively inexpensive price (about 7 dollars per six). I will spend the extra 2 bucks and get much better quality. I was able to down 3 of 6, and discarded the rest down the drain.","freystout17","May 27, 2012"

A lot more flavor and mouthfeel than the Lager. This Porter pours a very dark almost black with a solid tan head and leaves plenty of lacing. The taste and smell is somewhat malty, smokey and a hint of hops. Overall it is a pretty good Porter at a reasonable price for the budget conusious drinker.

3.11,-7.4,4,3,3,3.5,3,"Yuengling Porter pours almost solidly black. Just a hint of cherry highlight peaks through when the beer is backlit. About three fingers of light caramel foam forms the head of the beer. Retention and lacing are both solid, if unspectacular. The nose has some characteristics of a porter, but it's definitely a bit dull/muted. Specifically, there's some roast, and a little bit of a mild chocolate aroma. My comments would basically be the same for the flavor, some roasty grains and chocolate, but a whole lot of blandness to go with them. The body is on the light side, which makes the beer quaffable, but it toes the line of being watery at times. The carbonation comes off as a tiny bit too active, but everything in the mouthfeel is close to being really dialed in. Yuengling Porter feels like a halfhearted attempt at a craft porter, but it's a harmless enough glass of beer to drink.","axeman9182","Feb 27, 2012"

Twisting off the top (in my mind there is absolutely no detriment in a twist off top) I get some grapes mixed with roasted malts. Pours into a tulip shaped glass to an only slightly translucent deep brown with a foamy tan head. Taste is somewhat macro adjunct saki-like rice malt with nice mild bitterness and roasted maltiness in the background. Mouthfeel is good with an ideal carbonation and good viscosity.

Bitter, hoppy (but not overly), with hints of bitter cocoa, especially on the aftertaste, which lingers but is not altogether unpleasant. Ultimately one-dimensional, and unremarkable, and I wouldn't call it sessionable either, though it's not prohibitively strong in terms of alcohol or flavor. Slightly cheaper (and more bitter/hoppier), though not necessarily more prolific, than German Schwarzbier (such as Köstritzer), I question whether the savings are worth it.","zaphodchak","Jul 29, 2010"

The flavors were pretty good being mostly of coffee and roasted malt, though there was little complexity beyond that. As it warmed I did get some hints of nuts as well.

Very subdued roasted grains with a dominant creaminess. Medium body with a good mouthfeel, a lot of which comes from the great head that sticks right iwth the beer the whole time. Taste is still a little metallic and macro-y but not bad at all. The creaminess along iwth the head/mouthfeel really pull this beer through.

The brew looks great dark brown/light black color with a good-sized tan head that had great retention and left a nice amount of lacing. The flavors just don't do it for me, reminds me of a basic bland lager in taste. The flavors seem to have a strange astringency to it, but not from a charcoal, etc. It took me a while to finish that six-pack as I seemed to only reach for one when my fridge was empty of anything else.

It didn't get better from there. The taste was thin and a little sour with only a hint of malt flavor. Hops were barely there. It was served colder than beer should normally be served, but its chill was the only thing that really made it quasi-palatable.

The taste is a bit sour and tastes like the big brewery beers that turned me off of beer before I discovered stouts. There's a hint of chocolate malt roast here and there but it's way in the back, barely noticeable. The appearance was the only thing right about it: dark brown with a nice creamy head.

The roasted malt was balanced very well with the hops in this brew, and an aftertaste of coffee or weak cocoa finishes rather nicely. A fuller, stronger taste would have made this beer even better, but I was not disappointed when comparing it to other porters. A creamy mouthfeel and a medium- to full-body made this beer very enjoyable. It is also one of the most drinkable porters I have had.

The hops were there enough to keep it from being a sweet beer. I've had this beer a ton of times in the past, but this was the first time I really took it seriously. Not bad.

4,19,4,4,4,4,4,"a great dark pour with a flavorful coffee aroma turned me on to this beer. it has a very smooth coffee flavor with a hint of chocolate. this is simply a great porter. i did not expect anything out of this beer, and it ended up being a perfect example of a porter","ElGuapo","Jul 27, 2002"
4.3,28,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The Porter pours a dark brown color with a reddish tint and a small tan head. On the nose there is a slight aroma of toasted malts. On the palate the flavors consist of roasted malts, chocolate notes, coffee flavor, and a small hint of caramel. In the finish hops kick in a bit, ends slightly bitter and dry. Yuengling makes a great porter.","WilliamPhilaPa","Jul 26, 2002"
3.78,12.5,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Thick, dark, and delicious. Not as much of a bitter flavor as other porters, which I found to be quite pleasant. Richer flavor of coffee than others as well. As of now this is my favorite of the Yuengling line. An excellent offering!","IrishRedRock","Jul 20, 2002"
4.4,31,4,4,4.5,4,5,"While everyone else is drinking their Yuengling Lagers, you can sit back and enjoy this baby, which is a bit heavier, and a lot tastier than its cousin. Great for times when you want something a little heavier, and still want the Yuengling label.","stingo","Jul 18, 2002"
3.38,0.6,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Not too bad.  Yuengling sometimes stikes me a a mainstream brew, but this is a pretty good interpretation of a porter.  Nice and thick, with some good knife-and-fork qualities.  Prost!","goindownsouth","Jul 05, 2002"
4.34,29.2,5,3.5,4.5,4,5,"I am not going to go into detail about the characteristics of this beer because so many have already taken care of that.  However, I do want to salute this beer and make it known that it is definitely worth a try.  This is a faithful porter, although it is not technically a porter, that can be stacked against many of the great porters throughout the United States.","Maestro","Jun 24, 2002"
4.1,22,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours with a healthy two-finger deep tan head. Color is deep brown with red highlights. A nice fresh & roasty aroma greets the nose, tastes great...a light-bodied porter for sure, but the roastiness carries through to a dryish finish. This makes it quite drinkable indeed, a great session beer! Goes very well with a pulled pork sandwich, try it and see. Overall, a well-made and refreshing porter.","beerluvr","May 27, 2002"
4.18,24.4,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"In my opinion, this is one of the best domestic porters available.  This beer is rich and dark brown in color, almost reminiscent of coffee.  The head is nice and light brown.  Fragrance is of toasted malts.  Flavor is nice and chewey thanks to the abundance of toasted chocolate malt.  Slight hoppy finish. Coats whole mouth.","psugrad98","May 26, 2002"
3.71,10.4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours very black with only a little light getting out around the edges and a nice thin tan head that stays all the way down the glass.  The brew rings the glass on its way down and leaves a nice lace.  The smell is a little thin.  Nice roasted malt aroma but no hop aroma whatsoever.  The taste is also a little thin.  Nice roasted malt bitterness and some malty sweetness as well but not much else.  A nice coffee character as well.  The brew is very smooth on the palate and very drinkable.  For the price of a six pack I really feel that you can't go wrong with most of Yuengling's products.  Not the best porter but a great session brew especially when you factor in the cost.","Murph","Apr 29, 2002"
3.95,17.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Note: Unintentional cellaring. Somehow, four of these ended up in the back of a case of homebrew bottles and were entirely forgotten about for three years. Good to know it ages well, as I have one bottle left from Christmas 1994 - the last bottle of the last six my dad ever bought me. Maybe someday I'll crack it open.","sponberg","Mar 31, 2002"
3.21,-4.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,2.5,"Very dark, almost black, when held up to a light though, a slightly red hue can be seen in the core of the glass.  Roasted coffee hits you right off the bat when you first taste it.  Bitter chocolate also there.  I feel it is a bit harsh as the hop bitterness and the bitterness of the coffee flavor make the beer, overall, a bit bitter (surprise).","bmills1608","Feb 14, 2002"
