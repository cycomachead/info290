Smoked Porter, however, is a winner. What's most impressive about this beer is that, despite the big flavor, it's still relatively smooth (as a fine Porter should be).

4.08,1.7,4,4,4.25,3.75,4,"At first glance this beer is black and foreboding. A closer examination shows it's really a deep, dark brown with some underlying crimson. The head is a frothy off-white finger of foam that stuck around for a good while. In time, some splotchy lacing remains, as well as a thin cream coating on the surface. A classic porter profile marries with smoke to create an interesting metallic aroma. Reminiscent of a burnt bread slice from the toaster. Faint chocolate notes and trace hops are present too. Very earthy. The flavor is a tasty mix of roast and sweet dark chocolate. There's a nice bitter kick in the finish with a distinct smokiness that lingers. You can almost breathe it in. The texture of the brew is pretty average. Medium mouthfeel with lively but controlled carbonation. Just right. Not overly complex, or potent, but discernible as a porter or light stout with some added flair. It leans toward the bitter, dry end of the spectrum, but never approaches puckering or unpleasant. I've had other porters that are silkier and more balanced, but this delivers in all the right ways for a smoked beer. Quite delicious.","JohnnyI","Jan 08, 2015"

Considering it is made by Stone, you kinda sip down wondering if you're just missing something, expecting it to maybe come out a bit more as it warms, but it never happens. This might be one of the most "meh" beers I have ever had and by far the worst Stone. Tastes more like Miller or Budweiser attempted to make C.D.A.","RenzoD","Nov 23, 2014"

Nice complex nose of chocolate, light roast with toffee/coffee notes, a very subtle hint of dark fruit and a light smoky character that becomes pronounced as it warms.  Light medium bodied with an almost smooth texture.  Good carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish and in the middle.  The flavor profile is quite nice, balanced - with a smoky skew - and complex.  It begins with roast, then fades into a light chocolate sweetness.  The middle effervesces into a burst of smoke and light hops over a well balanced bitterness.  As it flows into the finish, hints of dark fruit emerge.  The finish leaves you with a nice smoky aftertaste that lingers over hints of bitter dark chocolate.","tillmac62","Oct 20, 2014"

Vanilla, toffee, tart cherry, a touch of coffee and a full amount of smokiness that makes bacon ring through my mind. Not much carbonation and the flavors made it feel like I was drinking flat soda (in a good way, for those who deem it possible) towards the end. Very enjoyable!","Phigg1102","Jul 23, 2014"

The appearance of this brew was fascinating... a deep black at the top of the glass, with a rich, translucent scarlet around the bottom of the glass. About a finger of a tan head which dissipated quickly. The aroma was overpowered by smoke, with some deep malt coming through as well. Taste was again overpopwered by smoke, with some dark fruit and malt undertones. Mouthfeel was smooth and enjoyable. Though this was definitely overpowered by the smoke (duh asshole, it is called smoked porter...), it chilled out as the glass warmed. Though it is somewhat like drinking a porter in a smoky room, at least it was more like yummy smoking meat smoke, as opposed to smoky bar smoke. Probably won't seek it out, yet intrigued by the chile pepper and vanilla variants. Worth a try if you like your beers dark.","Mikus","Jul 14, 2014"

The finish was perhaps too bitter for my liking. Although good, it's not great, and falls short of being top tier for me. I will almost always grab for a more straight forward robust porter such as Founders or Smuttynose over this. However, this will be added to my cookout rotation. Recommended for sure!","Bone53","Jun 27, 2014"

This offering pours a very near black color with a thick tan head that quickly dissipates and leaves a nice film and lacing. The nose is robust and roasty. Lots of coffee, dried fruits, leather, and a slight smoky quality. Not as abrasive as in some smoked beers. The flavor confirms the nose. Smooth and rich and roasty. Coffee, vanilla, and chocolate abound and are accented by the slight smokiness. Mouthfeel is rich and luxurious; almost more stout like than porter. This is an excellent beer. Stone does a great job of balancing the flavors without making the smoke too prevalent. Well done!","lochef81","Jun 24, 2014"

The smoke was not overt, but was there like a distant fire. Coffee, chocolate, dark fruit and shoe polish dominated the scent. The taste was complex and shifting from sip to sip, slightly sweet at first, then bittering on the swallow, with again a light impression of smoke on the backside. I'd say this has more carbonation than most Porters, but this is not a detriment at all. Overall a great porter, if not a very smokey one, I'm impressed that I'm noticing nuances several sips in. Hats off to Stone, I need to track down the Smoked Porter with Chipotle now.","SFNC","Jun 06, 2014"

Quite nice, very on point for a porter. Scents of slight citrus peel, roasted malt, smoked malt, dark chocolate and black coffee. A very good porter aroma with a nice addition of smoke, very nice. Flavors of black coffee, roast malt, cocoa powder and slight smoked malt with slight caramel in the middle and finish. Bitter and roasted aftertaste. Very well done, true to style for a porter with just enough smoked character to add complexity. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with low carbonation and a creamy feel. Very good, very much a porter. Overall this is a good porter with a nice layer of complexity added to the aroma and flavor with the addition of smoked malt. Very good, recommended.","Auraan","Dec 23, 2013"

Stone Smoked Porter does everything very well and the flavor and mouthfeel are phenomenal. This beer isn't a heavy or super rich beer like an imperial stout, rather is the signature chocolate moose of beers with a delicious yet complex flavor profile and a light, creamy mouthfeel. I could drink this beer all night, and am quite disheartened that I've finished off the bomber. Probably one of my all-time favorites, I better get this again!","Bockrules","Oct 07, 2013"

Bottle has an awesomely long explanation of the beer on the back which I am too lazy to read right now, but I appreciate the detail and will come back to it. Smells awesome, malty, nutty, wood smoke, musty tobacco - smells like your weird uncle's cabin in the woods. Flavor is so dark and smoky, adequately hopped, and lightly sweet. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and carbonation is light. I really like this beer, and I'm envisioning a number of future occasions where it would be appropriate, most involving outdoorsy activities and large fires. Maybe not for everyone, but I like this beer. Quite a bit.","BeerWizard","Sep 26, 2013"

3.25,-19,4.5,3.25,3.25,2.5,3.25,"Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer and I thought it was a pretty average example of the style, there was nothing about the flavor or aroma that really kept me coming back for more, it wasn't as bold and as aggressive as I expect most beers from Stone to be, so to me it felt a little out of place. This beer had decent drinkability, it was fairly smooth and not filling but the flavor didn't do a good job at holding my attention and I think a glass would be enough for me, a whole bomber is a little too much for me and after one pour it started to wear on me. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance, I thought it was very good and it's one of the best looking Porter that I've seen in a while. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was out of place for the style and it just didn't work that well with this beer. I would buy a fresh bottle just to see how different it is but as far as getting a beer just to enjoy and drink I don't think I would get this again, it just doesn't keep me coming back for more. I wouldn't really recommend this beer, it's not really smokey or porter like enough to recommend. All in all I thought this beer was a disappointment, I had high hopes for this one since stone rarely disappoints, but this one just fell flat and it didn't really highlight those porter and smokey flavors and aromas as well as I would like. Better luck next time guys, this beer just didn't do it for me, but I would still like to try the chipotle version of it.","StoutHunter","Sep 13, 2013"

It's not necessarily something I'd work into a regular rotation, but I could definitely see stocking a couple more bombers for when the mood strikes. The clerk where I bought it "warned" about the smokiness, but I didn't find it that over-powering at all -- certainly not enough to be off-putting. It fell right in the range I'd expect from a self-proclaimed "smoked porter." Another fine product from Stone, reasonably priced a $4.99 for a bomber.","LCB_Hostage","Mar 18, 2013"

4.05,1,4,4.5,4,3.25,4,"Overall a very nice experience in a Porter. It has a very good appearance with a moderate head and good carbonation. The aroma is what really makes this beer an experience. A nose fulling experience with good complexity and a nice smokiness. In addition, the taste does not disappoint. It is both full flavored and relatively clean. I can drink a full 22oz bottle and never feel like I'm being overwhelmed; very satisfying. The one potential weakness of this brew is the mouth feel. From the initial aroma, one gets the impression that it should be smooth and silky on the tongue. Unfortunately, after the fine initial experience with the aroma and color, the mouth feel comes across as somewhat watery. However, close your eyes and concentrate on the flavor and you won't notice the weak mouth feel after a few sips. Overall about a 4 out of 5. It's good enough that I keep a few bottles in the back of the refrigerator as a regular stand by.","RenaudNW","Feb 26, 2013"

Smoke and roasted malt pick up the front of the flavor, too. Smoked flavor is the major player here, but it doesn't overpower the substantial malt bill here. Burnt toast is big here. In the background there are subtle coffee and mocha flavors. Finally, there's a bitter edge to bring out the dry finish. This is a really good smoked porter and worth coming back to again and again.","hreb","Feb 23, 2013"

I'm not sure what effect has resulted from allowing it to go past it's BB date; perhaps a reduction in hop aroma? I was expecting it to be smokier - it appears that the brewers held back on the rauch to produce a brew with a well-judged balance between smokiness and traditional dark malt flavours. The hoppy pine notes that define Stone beers are noticible but take a back seat for a change. However, the overall effect is unique; how many other breweries combine smoked malt and hops the way this beer does? A solid brew with a delicious range of flavours - it goes down a treat. Well worth sampling if you have the chance.","jazzyjeff13","Jan 26, 2013"

Still not much flavor, but the aftertaste is still here a few minutes after I swallowed. This is good, but not the best offering from Stone. Sorry guys, but Fate Brewing has you beat on the smoked porter.","rickyleepotts","Dec 10, 2012"

Roasty malts and light smoke throughout with a mellow roasty faint smoke finish. Not as smoky as a rauchbier or Smoke Jumper, but nicely made and tasty. Surprisingly tasty for a 6% beer. Medium bodied. Worth a revisit.","LiquidAmber","Aug 02, 2012"

Has a mild smoked scent. Taste is robust yet still sweet with caramel malts finishing with a smoking flavor that delivers a hoppy after taste.","Lemke10","Aug 02, 2012"

As is typical of Stone beer, there is plenty of lacing left on the side of the glass. Mild smokiness could be detected in the initial pour. The nose reveals more smokiness to accompany the dark roasted malt. There's a mild aroma of chocolate and hops. The smokiness is prominent, but well balanced along with the taste of the dark roasted malt and chocolate. The hops are faint in the background. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. The beer is smooth, making this a highly drinkable porter. This is an excellent beer.","acevenom","Jul 06, 2012"
3.93,-2,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - Surprisingly tart on the tongue at first. The low abv allows for a smooth, smoky ride. Imagine coming home from a campfire, the smell of smoke on your clothes - smoking a cigarette after eaten a lightly hot pepper about ten minutes prior. That doesn't make much sense. But it sounds good right now so I'm gonna leave it in the review. Light on the palate, certainly not alcoholic, and easily sessionable. I want to have this out by the campfire.","Jesse13713","Jul 05, 2012"

The hops are milder than other big porters that I've sampled, so the notes center less on black coffee and more on chocolate malt and stewed plum flavors. There is a dash of smoky flavor in the background, as advertised, but I might have missed it if I were not looking for it. Overall, I found Stone Smoked Porter very drinkable and pleasant, a beer that I will definitely pick up again.","SylviaFaye","May 14, 2012"

The nose is that of roasted malt, chocolate, piney floral hops. Not as smoky as anticipated. The flavor delivers more smoke as expected but not so much that you feel like you're sucking on a charcoal briquette. Pleasant. Again roasted malts and chocolate. Medium bitterness from the piney earthy hops. Finishes clean and smooth with a lingering roasted smoke flavor. Medium bodied and well carbonated. I am typically not a fan of smoked beer, but this has a gentle enough smoke character that it is enjoyable. Good beer.","hopfacebrew","May 08, 2012"

4.63,15.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"At 5.9% ABV this is one of Stone’s “lightest” offerings. Parenthesis, only because it pours a dark coffee black with a billowy topping of crème colored foam. It has a light roast aroma, with just a touch of smoke. It’s subtle, nuanced and delicate to the point where it would be easily overlooked had it gone a shade lighter. Flavorwise the smoked malt makes its presence known without being bombastic or assertive. It complements the roast characteristics in a way that makes it a team player, an integral component of this beer’s flavor profile. There’s cacao nibs and a light hop bittering to round out the team, with a little sweetness on the body. It’s delicious and deliciously drinkable and I enjoyed it tremendously.","elNopalero","Apr 16, 2012"

This beer's flaw, if it can be called that, is that it doesn't have enough of what's already there. The on Randall and Knob Creek vanilla bean version I had had much more character and got more interesting as I drank it. This sort of stayed good but not great. But if you're wanting a mild-flavored and drinkable smoked porter, this is a good bet and it's relatively cheap price makes it an easier choice for a purchase.","BeardedRiker","Apr 10, 2012"

Pours a really dark brown, with huge 4 inch light tan head, that takes its time settling into a half inch of bubbles, with a crazy amount of lace. Smell smoked barley, biscuit, leather, and tobacco. Taste is mainly smoke, leather, and maybe some peat. Body is pretty large for its abv, lots of life, easy drinking, and not on the dry side. I am not a huge fan of the style, but this a great example. As always Stone does its thing and thanks for the best by 2/28/12.","SawDog505","Jan 14, 2012"

3.88,-3.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"A dark brown color, pretty much opaque with a decent light creamy tan head and good lacing. The aroma is surprisingly vague with just the suggestion of some herbal malt and a whisper of charcoal. No smoke whatsoever. The flavor again does not bring an obvious smoke either but there is a little grassy smoke and more mild charcoal malt. There’s a citrus tartness that nearly defines this brew which surprises me greatly considering it’s a smoked brew. This is a medium bodied brew with tiny bits of carbonation and a near resinous, yet glassy smooth feel. It’s a quality brew in feel but I bought this for a smoke taste experience and it’s so subtle as to really be nothing that warrants a smoke title. This brew is just a decent porter that features grassy hops and tart citrus over mild charcoal malt. Good, but ultimately a disappointment.","Durge","Nov 13, 2011"
4.23,5.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Wow. I finally tried this stuff. Picked up a bomber from Jasper’s in Nashua. Pours like oil, black and completely opaque. Cream colored one finger head that recedes quickly. Vanilla, caramel, coffee, and maybe licorice (?) in the aroma. Full bodied mouthfeel, roasty malt character, chocolate, medium sweetness, smokiness, and just a bit of hop on the backend. This was a great brew, and replaces Anchor as my favorite porter.","tylerss20","Nov 09, 2011"

The smoke is very dominant in the taste of this beer which is what you want in a smoked porter, however there seems to be a lack of balance. There is a slight estery taste, but it is very subtle and is gone almost as soon as the palate detects it. As the beer warms in the glass the toffee starts to become more pronounced. This beer is good, however I can think of many smoked porters I would reach for before I grab this again.","osusullins","Oct 28, 2011"

Having done this, I don't think this will hold up in the mouth beyond a year. I get a lot more licorice like flavor than I can ever remember getting in this fresh, but it's more or less flavor that's remnant of former smokiness. This isn't going to dethrone Alaskan Smoked porter for aging, but I can see it being a worthy experiment.","Cavery","Oct 08, 2011"
3.96,-1.2,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Overall, I thought this beer was nice, but not something I would really seek out again. I like porters or stouts with a nice smoky character, but this one was too subtle. The smoke was barely detectable. It was a solid porter though.","ahq514","Oct 04, 2011"

4.2,4.7,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Full and rich flavor of dark roasted malts. Coffee-like bitterness attached to the malts that touches all parts of the palate. Very balanced overall, as just a hint of barely sweet dried fruit touches the front of the tongue. Dark chocolate is hidden, but detectable in an off-hand way. The coffee bitterness and mouthfeel is where this beer succeeds. Lingering mouthfeel of coffee and dark roasted malts stays for a long time, enticing you into another sip. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light and airy for such a richly flavored beer. At the same time there is a certain heaviness to it though, probably from the heavy handed use of ingredients Stone is known for. The carbonation is on the higher side as well, giving a little zip to the coffee flavors. This accentuates the flavors in a very positive way, especially for the lighter sweetness that quickly gives way to the bitterness. This is a very good porter, and obviously another quality beer from Stone.","chodinheaven","Oct 04, 2011"
3.82,-4.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Drink- I will say it is one of the better in the “smoked” arena. It's just not a favorite of mine. Not gonna bash and give low grade. Still a good beer, because I believe I would enjoy the vanilla variation.","FosterJM","Sep 29, 2011"
4.15,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson-brown with a 1 inch foamy tan head that settles to a thin cap. Thin tight rings of lace mark the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt, smoked malt, and some rich dark toasted bread aromas. Taste is of roasted/smoked malt, toasted bread, and some minor cocoa bean flavors. There is an assertive roasty bitterness that sticks around after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a bubbly yet smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good smoked porter from the tap but I prefer the bottled version slightly more.","UCLABrewN84","Sep 27, 2011"

4.17,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Poured half of the bomber vigorously which produces a huge creamy tan head. Settles relatively quick to a point where it's still foamy and substantial, but you can see the beer through it. The foam laces well, and the body couldn't be blacker. Deep black coffee black. Smells very roasty. Smoke and char in the nose. Deep roasted malt flavors. Smoky, with a hint of bitterness. Slight cola and mineral aftertaste, with something that reminds me of toasted marshmallows. A nice carbonation and medium body keeps it from being too heavy, and is superbly drinkable. More hickory smoke and coffee as it warms. A nice after dinner beverage. Finishes dry.","ggilman","Aug 20, 2011"

Great smokey malt flavors with a well-balanced chocolate and "breakfast" flavor. This beer would go great with some bacon and eggs. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a creamy finish.

4.05,1,4,4,4,4.5,4,"O - The smokiness is actually far more muted than I expected on a smoked porter, but I might be biasing the review by expecting a higher smokiness. The smoke is definitely there, but not inyoface. A good offering that would go remarkably well with a bbqed brisket. I'll revisit this again sometime soon.","Wreckoncile","Jul 22, 2011"
4,-0.2,4,4,4,4,4,"22 ounce bottle. Pours dark brown color with a 2 finger light tan head with great retention that reduces to a fairly thick lacing cap. Some slight lacing sticks to the glass as well. Aromas of caramel roasted malt, some chocolate, and smoke. Aromas are pretty standard for a porter with some good strength as well. Taste of caramel, chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, with some smoke and nutty flavor as well. Decent amount of bitterness on the finish that lingers with coffee, chocolate, and smokey flavors for a bit. Medium carbonation and body. No alcohol noticed in the taste or finish. A decent amount of creaminess is also present, with very smooth drinkability and great flavor balance. Overall, a very nice porter, didn’t blow me away but this is an all around solid brew. Very tasty stuff.","superspak","Jul 16, 2011"

Taste is classic, clean roasted maltiness. Smoke is subdued, not overpowering, slight. A little hop on the end. Flavor is big but with a refreshing, smooth carbonated mouthfeel. Smoke comes alive as it warms. Has a surprising lightness. Excellent porter. The smokiness and bit of hop bite raise the bar on this one. Dry and a little sour/bitter on the finish. This would be a PERFECT dessert beer. The roast and smoke would offset sweetness nicely.","jgurley","Jul 08, 2011"

The taste is very good, more flavor than I expected, here the smoke flavor is present, I taste smoked roasted malts, a slightly burned flavor and there is some hoppiness on the way down, very nice.

Smell is milder than expected, dark roasted and chared malts are the dominant components with actual smoke taking a backseat and barely making itself known. A touch of earthy hops on the back. Taste brings a nice roasted malt profile, light touches of chared wood and faint chocolate. Again the smoke lacks any sort of umph - ive had beers that contained so few smoked malts they didnt name their beer with that description and they still had more umph than this.

The taste is chipolte that lingers and on top of the coffee notes, a little lime. The mouthfeel is light and smooth with a dry finish.

3.8,-5.2,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours a surprisingly big two finger head, I didn't pour it too aggressively. The head is an off white, tan color, and it has some soapy bubbles and some small creamy ones. I can tell the beer is leaving excellent lacing. You cannot see through the body of this beer at all, it is black, but not pitch black, it has hughes of brown and red, which is a little unfortunate for a porter in my opinion. Overall it looks really good, other than that hughes of brown and red. Also, the head has faded more than I would have thought, oh well. As for the smell, it's not really outstanding, I mean it's good, it's what I would expect from stone, but it leads me to think that it's not going to be A- quality, contrary to what the rest of BA says. You get a nice roasted malt smell, but it's not any roastier than most of the stouts that I have had. There are some nice chocolate aromas, and perhaps a small hop aroma as well. Is smells pretty smooth, and perhaps creamy, but overall nothing outstanding on the smell, good, but nothing unique. I really don't know how to rate this on taste, because it is a good beer, all around it's a good beer, but it's really just a little boring. There is nothing wrong with it, but there is almost nothing unique about it in any way. It tastes just like a regular old porter, it's done well, but just very normal. I do get a nice creamy feel to it which is very nice. There are the chocolate and roasted malts in here, and the smallest hop bite, maybe 1 IBU? haha, no but really. Overall I just wish the flavor was more powerful, it's not a very full flavor. I want to give this a 4 on taste because all the flavors are there and it is creamy and smooth, it's just not as flavorful as I would have liked, and it's pretty boring, so 3.5. I have to give it a 4 on mouthfeel because even though the mouthfeel isn't outstanding, the creaminess makes up for it; I mean it's a thin mouthfeel, but at the same time it's creamy. Drinkability is one thing that I will give this beer kudos for, it's a porter, and yet it's not hard to drink at all, it does down very easily. Overall I'm a little disappointed with this beer just because it's not very creative and not very flavorful, but at the same time it's a pretty well done beer and there is nothing wrong with it, so I will for sure enjoy drinking it.","MaltsOfGlory","Apr 06, 2011"

Great balance of flavors between the sweetness, medium bitter dark chocolate, and light pleasant smoke. Ends on a roasty note with mild smoke and piney hops. Body is slightly creamy and finishes mediumm dry. Very nice drinkable porter. The light smoke adds a really wonderful twist to this brew.

3.55,-11.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"D - This is essentially a roasted/smoked IPA. The porter characteristics show up early in the nose and taste, but the hops take over and pretty much wipe them out. This is the first porter I can think of where most of the finish is grapefruit, but occasionally chocolate/caramel sticks its head in for a moment. Most American porters I've tasted are really junior stouts. This is a brew that follows the American west coast trend of making it all about the hops. It's not my idea of a porter, but hop heads are likely to enjoy the experience, especially if they also like their malts well-roasted.","BuckeyeSlim","Jan 27, 2011"

The foam looks great but the lack of true black isn't what I look for in a porter. It smells or rich, woody smoke and is pretty appealing. It's a little more subtle than I'd like but it is solid. I prefer a good amount of smoke. I'm not getting any of the hoppyness that others have mentioned. The flavors are solid but not awe inspiring. It's a little sweet on the palate and as you swallow you get the char, wood, and smoke. It doesn't really have any coffee to it. I'd describe this as pretty mellow. This drinks exceptionally smooth and is in between medium to full in body. I do like the after taste but again, I'd prefer more smoke. This beer is solid but nothing too special.

It produced a thick, light-colored head, which in turn produced a thick patterned lace. The smell was average, above average for porters. Faint hints of chocolate, and coffee can be detected if you strain your nose. But the taste is where this beer shines. The start is full of chocolate and coffee, with a nice full-bodied mouthfeel. The finish reveals a nice light slight bitter smokiness that mingles with the coffee still on the palate. In all this porter is a very drinkable session beer, that would go with just about any meal.

The taste starts initially as spicy but then throws a coffee tasting bitterness followed by a campfire smoke-like swallow. Works very well. The only thing I really wasn't digging was the mouthfeel.

The aroma is smoky and full of that charred porter goodness that many of us love. The smoke is so well balanced here that it flows seamlessly through the flavor. They do not joke when they suggest barbecue on the bottle. The flavors are sweet and malty up front with the smoke beginning to rise in the mid-palate and by the time that roasted char comes through in the finish the smoke peaks and hangs around like a campfire in the early morning.

Interesting aroma of roasted and smoked malts, blending seamlessly together with notes of chocolate, hints of dark fruits. The flavour is first fruity, then chocolatey and smoky, but the smoke is not overdone. Some hoppy and roasty bitterness in the finish. This is an excellent and well balanced beer!","Sigmund","Jun 08, 2010"

Nose has a classic porter aroma with roasted malt coupled with what seems like Pete smoked malt dominating the back end. The taste of pete smoked malt also dominates the flavor that lingers through the long aftertaste. Medium feel and moderately carbonated. As it warms, more standards porter characteristics come through to win the fight of porter verse smoked malt. Flavors of bitter chocolate and coffee also come through in the nose. Pretty good with some citrus hops even evident in the finish.","stakem","May 19, 2010"

Color is a deep ruby, almost black, with a inch thick, creamy, espresso-colored head that quickly subsides to a fine layer which laces thinly down the glass. I don't know what Koch is talking about because the peat malt is unquestionably the defining character of this beer. Still, it's not overwhelming so you can still enjoy the bittersweet chocolate malt behind it. The texture could be a bit thicker but the beer still manages to be rather creamy and soft.

Taste is pretty good, chocolate malt, dark malt, some near coffee flavors, some piney hops (slight), and a bit of smoke. The smoke here is actually more pronounced in the nose than the flavor. Slightly creamy body, though it falls flat at the front of the palate. It could use (I can't believe I'm saying this) a bit more carbonation. Or more body. Pretty easy drinker here, although I feel as though it is due to the moderation in smoke flavors. A good introduction for me to smoked beers, but next time I might just go for a smoke bomb.

This is my first "smoked" beer and maybe it's supposed to be this way. but i will try it again if i ever find it on tap somewhere.","ditch","Aug 10, 2009"

I could feel very little carbonation from the glass, all wasted in foamy head, and had to drink straight from the bottle to get a feel for how much carbonation was present. It tasted better after the carbonation loss, not a great flavor, earthy. I could not find any chocolate, anywhere. I generally like Stone products, but this is a very pedestrian effort. To be honest, I can't believe this is the same beer that the majority of other reviewers rated!

All i get from it is a sort of yeasty, black-malt sweetness. Kind of coffeelike in essence. Not a lot of smell to it. Taste is very good, however. Deep in excellent porterness, dark sweet malt balanced very nicely by a healthy dose of hops at the end. The sweet-pushed hops are what slightly linger on the palate. I'm not getting a great deal of smokiness, but there seems to be a bit. It's basically a slightly smoked porter, a very nice touch. The smoke lingers a bit on the palate too, now that I taste it. Light-heavy in body, sufficiently coating and lingering. Drinkability is pleasant if not amazing. This is an excellent beer, and I will continue to treasure it.","damienblack","May 30, 2009"

Creamy mouthfeel, coffee-like bitterness up front. Finishes with a thick, dark malty flavor with a lot of chocolate. As it warms you can smell some overripe plums (I guess? it's some kind of sweet fruit). It does kind of remind me of black licorice (I doubt I would have gotten that if I hadn't read the back of the bottle but whatever). I should have let the bomber sit out of the fridge for 20 minutes or so to warm up, since as I drink it its getting way better.

The aroma was not nearly as 'dark' as I was expecting, roasted malt, earthiness, peat smoke, rye bread and wood. The flavors were rich and robust, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, peat smoke, sweet pipe tobacco, earthy malt and a good balancing hop bitterness. The long bitter finish was pleasant and well organized as one experiences with high-quality chocolate. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body full and the carbonation perfect.

There was slight bitterness in the finish with apparent hop flavor. I had this with some texas sliced brisket and the taste immediately changed. The beer became way too hoppy.

The smoke is strong but not overpowering, however, this is the only aspect I found original about this porter. Normal texture, tastes of coffee and fairly smooth.

Pours to an opaque balck with a creamy head that's foamy with big bubbles on top. Upfront the taste hits you with everything: roasted malt, hops and smoke. Then one by one they peel off, first the roasted malt peels off leaving a smokey bitterness, then the smoke fades abit and leaves mostly bitterness with a hint of sweetness. Mouthfeel however seems a little thin for this complex brew. Not as chewy as one would expect for a porter. However that is not a factor that affects the flavor, nor the drinkability. In my opinion it actually improves the drinkability. Great selection by Stone.","mooseisloose","Feb 01, 2009"

The pour hinted at something exciting, as it showed near black with reddish edges & a small burnt beige head that quickly left, with off-white minimal lace. The aroma held an unexpected hop quality & minmal malts & smoke. The flavor likewise pushed hop bitterness at the sacrifice of smoked malts & chocolate-coffee elements that just reared their taste. By no means a bad pint, just a bit too hoppy for my porter wants.","selecter70","Jan 27, 2009"

Not even a finger of light tan head dissipates quickly, though a ring retains well. Smells of highly pungent smoked malts including dark chocolate and, more deeply, some fruits. The first few sips were heavily influenced by smoked malts with burnt chocolate and caramel; each of these initial sips ended with a hoppy bite, convincing me this beer was well balanced. However, after about the third sip, the hops completely overtook the palate. Though the ashy aroma stuck around, I could not pull the smoked flavor out of the hops for the remainder of this bomber. Light to medium-bodied, medium carbonation and oils coating the palate completely, mostly with bitter residue. Overall, this beer was hoppy but not unpleasant (just more than I expected from an American Porter). The smoky factor made me think of fireplaces, and I certainly experienced that warm, fuzzy feeling.

Full-bodied, very smoky with a strong chicory streak, gives it a more dark chocolate and bitter profile. The raisin, plum fruit sneaks onto stage, sweetened by molasses crisp notes.

I just kept wishing that it was a little more full-bodied and I wanted a little more bite from the alcohol - maybe I'm just used to imperial stouts.

Taste is chocolate, nuts, roasted malt, with a smoky flavor that is very distinguishable but does not knock you over the head. A little sweetness in the middle though with a surprisingly mild hop bitterness towards the finish. I have never tasted a brew quite like this; besides being a very intriguing smoked beer, it is a fantastically balanced porter in my opinion. The taste only improves as the beer warms. Drinkability is excellent due to the (thankfully) low-ish ABV and intriguing flavor that has you wanting more immediately after the taste from the previous sip has diminished.","ljbrisson","Jan 02, 2009"

Toffee, chocolate, coffee, roasted and some toasted malts w/ hints of coffee and bread malt with moderate dryness produce a balanced beer that hits on many strong points of porters.

The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a tad more carbonation than I generally like, as I expected from the large head. The alcohol is fairly low, but with such bold roasted and smoky flavors, this isnt a beer you want more than one in a night. It is, however, an excellent version of a smoked porter.

4.23,5.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured from a 22 oz bomber into a pint, well twice... Had this before at Taco Mac, but didn't want to review at that time. This time I had it with a steak at home, and it was an excellent match. Pours a deep, dark, black color and a nice thick caramel head (aggressive pour). The smell was not as overwhelming as some other smoked brews I have had, not bad, just not that strong. Light smell equated to lighter smoked flavor, but definitely an excellent, thick porter. Personally, I have been hit or miss with the smoked brews, but this one accented the flavor well, while not overtaking the rich porter tastes of the chocolatey malts. As rich as this brew is, it goes down easy (but filling). It's not the alcohol, but the thickness that makes one bomber about enough (well maybe it was the steak too). Definitely an excellent porter.","bhalter8","Dec 30, 2008"

The nose is so complex you can dig-out all kinds of aromas. Like I said, a beer geek's beer - you could study this one for hours. Some may be turned off by this one, but I find it really fun.

The taste is very well-balanced, and like the smell, isn't as bold or complex as expected, but remains tasty and satisfying nonetheless. I would go as far as to say the seeming innocuousness of the aromas and tastes are part of what make up the special charm of this brew.

Head was fairly big with solid lacing that drooped off after 2-3 quafs. Nose was on on strong roasted malt and hopearth secondary aroma.

I expect a lot out of a Stone beer, and the Smoked Porter didn't quite live up to my expectations. I don't mean that it was bad. It's a big, flavorful porter that pours a rich, dark brown color and supports a nice-sized, coffee-cream head. The appearance is spot on, but the smell unfortunately doesn't punch as much as the look. Rich chocolate sweetness predominates the nose, but it lacks the complexity of a bigger beer. I'm not being very forgiving here, but I was hoping for more smoke and more interest from this entry in Stone's lineup. Smoke is also disappointingly weak in the flavor profile. It's there, but I was expecting and hoping for it to punch me in the face. Chocolate and coffee were both stronger for me than smoke.

Moderate hop bitterness actually left a mild tang on my tongue but the semi-sweetness of the malt balanced it nicely. Some faint but interesting grassy and lemongrass-like hop flavor. I felt that the mouthfeel was a tad thin for a porter but it was rather drinkable for that reason. This was a decent beer, don't get me wrong, but there definately was a lack of boldness for this style in the mouthfeel, the hop bitterness/flavor/aroma, and especially with the smoke flavor and aroma.

The color is rather teaky around the edges of the glass but become nearly black in the middle, with a tan head that froths up nicely and fades quickly. There's a nice amount of smoke in the taste with a solid porter platform that I'm sure would be fine on its own. The smoke isn't overpowering and even tastes a bit salty. A nice hit of malt up front and just a tinge of hops as it goes down. I had this with pizza and apple pie-- a great combination! Very much worth drinking, more than once. (Just ignore the bloviation on the bottle's label: as on other Stone bottles, the staff brags a bit too much about themselves.)","gfreed","Oct 05, 2008"

4.15,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Had this on-tap at the Brick Store Pub. Pours a nice black color with an adequete head that fades to a ring. Smells lightly smoky and quite creamy. Taste is similar. This is far less smoky than any of the Schlenkerla beers, but the smoke is noticeable and beautifully wedded to the rest of the brew. The surprising thing to me about this beer is how creamy and smooth it is. The rich, creamy body marries very well with the smoke and helps to balance everything nicely. The Alaskan Smoked is far more smoky tasting, but in that case probably because the body is not as robust and creamy as this is. The balance in this beer is a thing of beauty. I recently tried a bottle of this that had been aged a year as well, and although it was still drinking beautifully, the smoke was even more subdued. I also like the fact that this doesn't have that much residual sweetness, despite the creaminess. A very nice beer.","Georgiabeer","Oct 02, 2008"

Smell somehow doesn't reveal the smoke that I expected, only on a very small scale toward the end. Very nice chocolate scents, luring me in. A bit of cocoa and a touch of coffee. Again, the end displays the smallest hint of smoke. What a great tasting beer! The smoke is definitely here now. Still, it only provides an added complexity to the beer itself. Nice chocolate flavors, toasted caramel and roasted malts. Smoked barley plays well with the rest of the flavors. Shockingly, the hop presence in the finish of this one is nearly on the level of the Pale Ale. Well, maybe not, but it wasn't expected so much here as it was there, and I welcome it. Excellent medium body that is silky smooth, with a nice roast/smokey finish that works wonders. I could drink a couple of these no problem, though a regular Porter such as Black Butte would be easier to return to on a regular basis. A very unique brew and the smoked barley does it good.","ncvbc","Sep 27, 2008"

Notes of chocolate, smoke, dark fruit and a rush of hops hit the palate. Big, full, chewy and warm mouthfeel that is balanced and smooth. A fine porter from Stone that could use a little more smoke character, but overall very enjoyable. The salient hops push this closer to a stout. I dig it.","itcomesnpints","Sep 26, 2008"

Tasted like an average porter; roasted malt and a slight sweet chocolate flavor. However, as it warmed up a little, the smokiness started to emerge a little bit. The smoky flavor was still not as bold as I expected though, but that's not a bad thing. Excellent, full mouthfeel.

Rich and dark this is a looker good swirling tan head and loads of tacky lacing. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth but lacks a thick creaminess I like to find in a good porter, it does get better as it warms but still doesn't hit the right level. Flavor is real nice. I can smell a bit of the smoked flavor as I drink, my taste buds first pick up on some chocolate and caramel followed with a bitter coffee taste.

Unfortunately this beer didn't pour much of head, mostly I think, because it was much cooler than it should have been. While it was pretty cold, the lacing lasted all the way down. "Amazingly rich, dark and delicious yet this is our least understood beer." This is off of the back of the bottle. Unfortunately, I have to disagree. While, I do agree with the dark and delicious part, I can't figure out while people wouldn't understand this beer. The only thing I don't get is why they would call this a "Smoked Porter". I couldn't find any smoke in this beer. The aroma is dark chocolate, a bit of coffee and apples. The taste follows suit with bitter, baker's chocolate and java. Still, there is absolutely no smoke involved in its flavor. I think the reason I like this beer is the lack of smoke flavoring. Really this beer tastes more like a thin double stout then a Smoked Porter. The mouthfeel is full; it is much thicker than most porters. I find this beer really drinkable. It's tasty and smooth but the one thing its not is Smoked. I think I would review this beer much higher if they would have left off the Smoked moniker.","hwwty4","Apr 27, 2008"

Drinkability is good. Overall this is an ok beer. Defenitely funky for a porter and quite soft for a smoked offering. I realize they intended for a subtle smoke, but it is the porter brew itself I find a bit off. a decent beer, but one I probably won't buy again.

Definitely the kind of porter you could have several of with ease.","Iceman77","Dec 16, 2007"

Pours the darkest brown I've seen, just shy of black. A small tan head formed but it didnt last long and no lacing either. Smell is of some sweets, some caramel, but mainly that of a smoked meat or fish. Taste is good. The taste is a complex blend of the actual smoke flavor, some malt hints, some of coffee, a bit of malt and small touch of bittering hops. It does have a slightly heavy mouthfeel and leaves behind a rather thick and almost oily aftertaste that I wasnt fond of. Overall an easily drinkable beer, light on the ABV and best at a warmer temp.

The smell reminded me of fresh caramel followed by a hint of smokiness. The taste was definitely smoky with a taste of bitterness reminiscent of dark chocolate. This bitter sweet character was carried through to the end of the swallow which left the palate with a pleasant, bittersweet aftertaste that makes a man not want to brush at night.

The taste is a bit light for me, i kinda expected a bigger flavor, a nice smokey taste sticks out in the end. no offensive taste, so still pretty good.

The aroma is rich in a dark way, with notes of smoke mixing with chocolate and crystal malts. On the palate, smooth sweet malts first off, with restrained smokiness in the background. Well-rounded, earthy bitterness comes through at the mid-palate and mingles with bitter roasted malts and that smoky aspect; those elements compose the long, dry finish. Mouthfeel is a touch more thin than it could be, and quite rough moving over the mouth. Overall, this is a fine smoked porter, but it's missing that extra gear.

But beyond that this is a beer to be appreciated for the subtle character of the smoke. It's not a rauchbier and it's not over the top, especially by Stone's standards, and I think some see that as a weakness. When I first had this beer five years ago, I rated it even higher--in part because I was younger in my tasting and it's a really nice, complex beer that's not overwhelming or an extreme beer. On draft at RFD, it was also open and accented it's strength. Love this beer and will drink more whenever I get a chance.","FightingEntropy","Apr 24, 2007"

Smells like a rauschbier. Malty, smoky, even peaty like a scotch. Wow! Burnt toffee, coffee, and baker's chocolate for sure. Tastes smoother than I expected, and remarkably little hops for the Stoners. Goes down smooth, but I think it's a bit too smoky to be a real session beer. Something I'd get on its own, or to mix it up, but I can't see putting back three or four of these. That said, it is seriously delicious if you like smoke and roasted malt.","jbsteiny","Apr 23, 2007"

The taste was also mellow, but a good mellow, not like a ridiculously overkill stout. I was lovin' it already as a re-introduction to the dark side hehe. I remembered it was smoked all the sudden and there it was in my mouth, a perfect level of being smoked. Good job to Stone on that (when do they do a bad job?)

With the beer served cold I couldn't seem to find much in the aroma initially. I was happy to find that once it started to warm luscious notes of really bittersweet chocolate would arise. A faint dose of hops that are become slightly dulled behind hints of smoke. It's important to distinct it as 'smoke' - because it isn't really 'roast'. We're not talking rauchbier, but there is a distinct absence of roast and that quality has been replaced by the character of smoke - like that off a barbecue. Subtle enough though. Fairly luscious bitter sweet flavours in the taste department as well. Notes of toffee, chocolate, English pudding, trace bits of (now,) roast malt. A little less texture than I'm use to with Stone beers, but certainly the right degree of carbonation. The mouthfeel is a little underwhelming to be honest. That character of smoke (like that found in a smoked meat) is present but very unassuming on the palatte. A nice porter.","biegaman","Mar 19, 2007"

This one is reserved, and lets the malt run the show...pretty much. All in all, I was a bit surprised at how mild it is, but it remains really drinkable.

Not too much on the nose, or maybe my sense of smell is just dead tonight, but I can't really smell anything notable. Taste: aww yes, this is a good porter. Lots of rich bitter chocolate and coffee flavors with a nice smokey after taste, a little bit of sweetness there too once it's left to linger on your tongue. I've had other beers with "Smoke" in the title and the smokieness often overwhelmed the rest of the tastes, not the case with this beer. This one feels a little acidic as far as mouthfeel, and it's not as smooth as I hoped, but certainly not anything that's going to keep me from enjoying it, but it doesn't go down as easily as I hoped, but that's probably good because it'll keep me from drinking the one bottle I have too quickly.","theWrkncacnter","Jan 12, 2007"

I thought the smell was a bit lacking though, I expected more smokiness to come through. This beer has wonderful flavors: dark chocolate, burnt coffee, plenty of roasted malts, and a slight smokiness...which once again I was preparing myself for more of a pronouced smoke flavor but still do enjoy it. This has a pretty good mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation. This beer is very drinkable and would love to pair it with food. Wish Stone would start to distribute in Iowa and even Minnesota. Awesome beer, Stone Rocks!!!","RobertDwight","Jan 07, 2007"

Taste is bang on- roasty sweetness with just the right amount of smoke. The smoke is not overpowering at all. Appropriate carbonation for the style and very drinkable. Hop presence is quite muted, at least for by Stone standards. This must be their least hopped style. A great porter in my mind.","oakbluff","Jan 07, 2007"

Stone brews are awesome and big and flavorful, but the seem to not get it done in the mouthfeel as well to me. One of the best stone beers I've ever had. Quite a brew.

3.86,-3.7,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"I really like porters and stouts. But unlike most Stone brews, I have to say this one is not the best in its class. It is a solid offering from Stone, but, in my opinion, nothing really special. It pours a big, dark tan, bubbly head. The color is black coffee. The head is not long lasting, but leaves a creamy lacing all the way down the glass. Surprisingly there isn't much aroma to speak of. Maybe I served it too cold? The mouthfeel is lighter than I like for a porter or stout. Flavor is roasty, smokey, almost burnt up front, hollow in the middle, and finishes with a bit of a sour kick. The stouts I prefer (e.g., Pizza Port's Old Viscosity and AleSmith's Speedway) have more alcohol than this, too. This beer is somewhat comparable to Guinness. Though I do prefer it to Guinness. It is not as creamy as Guinness--in fact the carbonation is a bit much for a porter, I think. The flavor is better and more complex than Guinness in my opinion. Overall a very decent beer, but not my favorite porter and certainly not my favorite from Stone.","PhiloPsych","Dec 17, 2006"

Nice fluffy tanish off-white head with decent retention. Smells of roasted malt and some mild alcohol hints. Smells like a big malted porter. I was rather disappointed by the lack of smoky flavor. I was looking for more of a smoked and roasted mouth feel. There are hints of the roasted malt and mild hints of smoke but not to the extent I would have liked. Very full bodied with a nice mild touch of hop in the aftertaste. There certainly is a decent mix of flavors throughout the whole brew. Subtle hint of chocolate. Well not everyone will agree on some things but this one was a bit disappointing for me. All there other offerings have been quite delectable but to each there own. Maybe I will give this one another go later this month. It is tasty and drinkable and matches well with pretty much any food. Pumpkin pie and some Thanksgiving treats were my paired foods.

The smoke fades into the background behind the chocolate notes while the finish lingers with a hoppy smokiness. Bittersweet to semi-sweet chocolate fills the medium body.

3.12,-22.2,4,2,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured from a slightly chilled 22 oz. bottle into a Ename chalice, the Smoked Porter was midnight black with a thin tan head which left only slight lace. This was my first smoked beer, and although I have heard good things, I was a bit skeptical. Furthermore, I should say that I'm generally not a big fan of Porters. The aroma was extremely sweet, with flavors of caramel and malt but no smoke, and was not very appealing to me. The taste however was much more balanced and a pleasant surprise. It was a bit sweet, but not nearly as much as the aroma would lead you to believe. There was a definite smoky taste, that if anything was more subtle then overwhelming. The main story here was the richness of the malt, which the smoke did a fine job of balancing out, making this porter much more enjoyable to me then they normally are. However, there was a fairly strong alcohol taste for only 5.9% ABV. The mouthfeel was rich and a bit syrupy from all the malt, but the balance provided by the smoke made this a drinkable porter worth checking out.","ccrida","Oct 13, 2006"

Smells of sweet malts, very light alcohol underneath, with hops smelling grassy and gentle in a british way, but also blended with that northwestern american hops aroma. A subtle dopple like sweetness in the aroma as well. This smells like a lot is going on in a good way, and it's already not what I was expecting. Expecting a hop bomb of an ultra smoky porter... Here goes...tastes mostly brown actually; the smoke it faint and in the finish. Charred malt peaks through past the smoke and there is only a little bit of that to add complexity but not offend. The taste is classic dark brown/light porter with a few twists to give it complexity. It's balanced in hops actually. More comprable to jinx than I expected! Mainly just a note darker and a tad less smoky. I can see this as a porter, but it seems to have a lot in common with a medium bodied brown ale apart from the color. I like both browns and porters, and so it was more of a surprise expecting a near-stout kind of porter. A tasty, english style, balanced-flavored brew! Mouthfeel is medium with not intrusive carbonation ,in a really good way; very solid, which contributes to being one of the most excellent, easy drinking, sessionable beers I've had in a long time, and the 22oz split with a friend went down far quicker and more easily than I imagined!

Tastes surprisingly chocolate-y, while the usual coffee flavors coming out fairly strong also. This porter doesn't overplay the smokiness like so many smoked beers do...instead it seems to add a smoke element to an already great porter. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, but it remains quite drinkable even at room temp. Overall, a very good brew from Stone.","hero27","May 30, 2006"

It has a stronger smoky taste to it, along with it tasting like chocolate and roasted malt. There's also a slight bitter coffee-like aftertaste, which is good. It's very full flavored overall. The mouthfeel is thin, and it goes down pretty smooth with not much carbonation at all. I'm very partial towards dark beers anyway, and I would place this one close to the top of the ones I've tried.

Toasted cocoa and chocolate cake batter up front in the taste with an earthy compost-like hop flavor following. Sharp mineral twinge at the finish. Smoke flavor does not emerge until late in the aftertaste. On a second sip, however, it seems that a foretaste of the smoke is detectable in between the sweetness of the cocoa-inspired malts and the bitter hops. Okay, no, as the beer warms, the smoked flavor really does emerge, but not too strongly -- it permeates most of the sip, but only in a gentle, "Hey, I'm a smoked porter, remember?" sort of way. Medium body and silky mouthfeel overall. Without a doubt, one of the top American porters. Matched nicely with smoked gouda on pumpernickel. "Enjoy by 1 05 05." Whoops.

The aroma immediately said "Stone", with a sweet spicy (mango chutney?) melody harmoniously laid on top of a classic roasted-coffee porter background, and a strong hint of smoke. It pours beautifully dark and clear, with a nice creamy head which subsides quickly into a drinkable thin film. Even though served quite warm, the flavor and mouthfeel didn't quite live up to what my eyes and nose had promised--I prefer porters that pack just a little bit more sweet, roasted maltiness--but it was still quite good, with the smoke flavor again perfectly balanced. And it all finished very clean, making this one very drinkable porter.","petemorris","May 19, 2006"

Head dissipates within a minute or two, leaving very little lacing. Smells of smoke, raisin, coffee and hops. Tastes very "hoppy", but nice. Goes down smoothly, though it is a very "thin" beer as far as dark beers go. The light feel allows it to go down smooth, and it is very satisfying. One of the better porters I have had, but I still think that if you like a full flavored dark beer, a stout is the way to go.","sagito327","May 18, 2006"

I have had a handful of things before with smoke in the title, only to be terribly disappointed to discover no smoke in either the smell or the taste. This had plenty of smoke, however, but just enough. I also got a little bit of a bready smell and some chocolate hiding in the back. Positively one of the best smelling beers I have had in a long time. The taste matched the smell with a nice "meaty" malt right up front and plenty of smoke. A small amount of caramel and burnt coffee make appearances toward the finish. Mouthfeel is very smooth with a fantastic level of carbonation. This beer is just amazing.

The sweet taste of chocolate, with hints of coffee, then followed by the smoky flavor that finishes each taste.

Mouthfeel was medium, but not much. I could maybe settle for 12 ounces instead of 22. The bomber was a bit much. I was disappointed by the lack of smoke flavor and the sweetness.

Its very sweet, but the sweetness is balanced by some fruit, mango, a bit of pear. The smokiness comes through midway through the drink. The finish really has balanced.

This is probably due to the bitter hop bite at the end. Mouthfeel is pretty full as would be expected. Fills all the expectations for a porter with the added smoke flavors as a bonus.

Poured out of the great looking bottle a dark black color. small bubbly head becomes creamy and smooth-looking. the whole thing looks fantastic. Odor is slightly smoky, but more like roasted malts. Also some wet oak log smell and molasses. Taste was smoky as all hell at first and then a hard malt bitterness and hints of chocolate. simple but great. i likey.

Its only mildly bitter at first, but give it some time. It feels thick on the tongue, smooth, and has a dryness to it. Good carbonation.

Nose was burnt in essence, as one would expect it was very earthy, mellow, and malty with hints of cocoa powder more than chocolate. Taste was surprisingly subtle for a Stone beer, usually they are more in the "knock your socks of syle" but this one's greatness lies in the subtle suggestions of cocoa and earthy wood with a distinct spiciness in the finish. Smoking is not overwhelming but adds a unique flavor component which makes the beer more interesting than most.

Medium in body, this brew has good weight to it and a persistent flavor profile. For a porter it is very concentrated and robust... chock-full of all things good and necessary in a brew of this style.

Starts with a sweet malt flavor, transitions into burnt brown sugar caramel flavor, and finishes smoky and dry. Slightly alcoholic. Soft yet big and a little bit chewy, a little bit sticky.

Dark brown, but not opaque, with a hefty brown head on there. Nice and bubbly. Smell and taste are loaded with complex chocolaty coffee notes and a nice smoke character that really separates this beer from others in the style. Really nice. Definately much hoppier than I expected as well, with a really killer bitterness not usually found in porters.

I've had only a few other "smoked" beers in my day and this one is probably the least smoky, which is good, because that makes it easy to finish the 22oz.

This beer leaves a smokey taste on the palate. It is slightly aggressive in flavor, I think due to the smoke. It is a little over carbonated.

Brown roasted malts enter my sinuses, as well as a bit of smoke and caramel. Not overly complex in aroma, but nice. Taking the first sip, a sweet caramel flavor jumps out at me along with a bit of smoke flavor. By the swallow, the smoke takes over the body of the flavor, and leaves a huge smoke aftertaste in my mouth. Again, not overly complex, but comes through with what it promises in style. A little sweet up front, and smokey and a little bitter on the finish due to the smoke and the little bit of hops I taste. Carbonation is rather high and a little strong in my opinion, but the milky quality of the head seems to come through making this a much smoother swallow; nice and creamy! Overall, I enjoy everything Stone distributes that I can get my hands on, and this is just one more example in a style (smoke beer) that I am not as crazy about.

The aroma is of a fire that had you wake up to the next morning and all you smell is the wet charred wood. The flavor is of charred malts and charred wood. Almost as if I licked the inside of a wodd-burning kettle. So good. IT wafts uo the back of the nose. There are also very deep notes of dark chocolate wrapped into the beer.

This wonderful flavor comes on smooth as silk, dripping with fat malts. Roasted grain presence steadily increases, till the flavor is chock full of it. Hints of bitter chocolate and truck stop coffee float around, seeking attention. The smoke I was looking for comes in towards the end and really stands out in the finish, leaving a semi-dry roasted flavor. Smoked malts really add a fine touch to this robust brew. Mouthfeel is pretty full for a porter, which is good - it helps to back up this bold flavor. Hella drinkable, not too heavy or alcoholic, but that smokiness is just so damn enticing.

The head expanded to a large volume then declined after some time. Lots of lacing. The nose is mostly chocolate and some roasted malt flavor but not all that I was hoping it would be. The flavor on this beer was really thick and malty. Very roasted in the body with a mocha bitter combination on top. Never sweet but quite malty. Hops are more apparent in the finish and slightly bitter in the end. There is a smoky undertone to this beer but I wish it would have been stronger. Does age lessen the smokiness of a beer? This is probably the 2003 so maybe the smoke flavor diminished. All in all this is a really, really good porter but I just wanted a stronger element of smokiness in there.","granger10","Jul 25, 2004"

The body is ruby brown in color, and is much clearer than almost any other porter that I have come across. The smoked malt clearly imparts a burnt roasty aroma to the beer. The hop aroma is light and faintly grassy. The taste is refreshingly acidic (lemons mostly), and bitter-sweet chocolate with almonds, with a smoky grain flavor constantly lingering in the background. There is also a hint of cracked peppercorn in the aftertaste. The body is light on the palette, with a creamy smooth texture enhanced by the soft carbonation. The finish is chalky and bone dry, leaving you craving the next sip. The beer is amazingly drinkable, and would make a good companion on a hot summer day.

Brew poured to almost black color with a nice head that stuck around for about half of the brew and then broke down to pretty good lacing. The aromas of this brew where of caramel, chocolate, charcoal and of course a sweet smokiness. Excellent aroma coming from this brew. The taste was very much in line with the aroma, but the roasted malt flavor was prevalent. Also could notice a bit if a hop hit but is was difficult to track that one down. Nice think brew that I think would be incredible during the colder months but was happy to give it a try with it being close to 80 out! Over all a great brew and would track this one down again!","Stimack","May 08, 2004"

Some toasted grain also peeks through along with a hint of smokiness. Hop flavor is light, herbal when noticed. Lingering roasted flavor. Medium-full in body, creamy, and smooth.

Carbonation is just perfect and such a smooth feel on the tongue. Here's where it gets interesting. Shared this with two friends and they just kept going back and forth on the flavors that kept coming through. Roasted, toasted barley, hops comes to the palate for a brief visit only to be replaced with perhaps a caramel but I think chocolate. Stone just keeps our minds working with the combinations of flavors in all of their brews. Definely one of the best Porters I've ever had.

Very sweet though with lots of crystal? malt making up honey and maple flavors. Subdued hops profile that gain Stone a bit of respect from me. Chocolatey sweet, just very malty altogether and finely balanced once the grassy green hops finally kick in, but it's no standout in my books and is actually a bit watery in the finish. I can definitely see where the brewers are from when they claim this to be their less understood beer though.","Rastacouere","Apr 19, 2004"

Nose is roasted coffee beans and dark caramel along with some fainter aromas of smoked grains. Fairly full in body with a somewhat heavy and chewy texture and a very smooth level of carbonation. Taste begins with some sweet malts and milk chocolate followed by flavors of fresh brewed coffee and some earthy notes with touches of smoky charcoal and peat with only a mild trace of bitter hops towards the finish. The smoky and peaty notes remain in the aftertaste, becoming more pronounced as the beer warms. Another winner from Stone. Purchased from Liquid Solutions.","Morris729","Apr 06, 2004"

The head was poured small, but it was light and creamy and left a strong lace. The aroma was of chocolate and roasted goodies. Tiny bit of hop aroma. Not a whole lot of smoke. The taste was full of chocolate and sweet roasted grains. Astringency was low. Mild hop flavor barely balanced the chocolate sweetness. Smokiness was restrained. Not dry. I ordered a filet mignon and I don't think they went too well together, go figure. Anyways, this porter is medium bodied and very smooth. I had this a few months ago in the bottle and it was terribly astringent. This tap version was very nice.","oggg","Apr 02, 2004"

The smell was semi-sweet with a fair amount of spicy undertones. Just a slight hint of coffee. It started out with a sweet cream taste with just the right mix of a coffee taste. The middle was laced with a spice that I just can't put my finger on. The finish was just slightly bitter with a slight kick of smoke.

The brunette head reached two fingers in height and the retention was nearly flawless. It took a long while before it faded noticeably. The subsequent lacing was massive. It was a beautiful sight. The nose was quite unexpected. Where was the smoke? I mean I could detect the American hops the second I started pouring it and once I took a sniff a good amount of roast chocolate malts and coffee hints were detectable. But where is the smoke? Frankly it just smells like a big Porter. Thats not really a bad thing but the label is misleading thus far. The palate is tasty; I think I found what is meant by smoke, I detected a burnt flavor. Unexpected. Disappointing. Still, tasty. I guess this is the difference between a Smoked Beer and a Rauchbier. Back to the palate, the big roasted flavors dominate but allow room for a reserved bite of hops. This is a well-rounded Porter that is very easy to drink. I am digging the fact that the alcohol content so modest. This is the first Stone beer that does not reign down pure anger in the form of hops! Still, Im digging it. I mean the drinkability is sensational. I want more! The mouthfeel is pleasant, the carbonation seems a bit small and the body is medium-full, still I found it a touch slick but this is hardly a big negative. All I can say is this is a delicious Porter with a straight-ahead tastiness that is hard to rebuff. I bet this could be paired with an array of BBQ and grilled food.

Goes to show you, add a flavor to what starts as a good beer, and it has a chance to be a winner. It drinks easily and freely, which is obviously a good quality.

Enormous roasted flavors in the nose: dark chocolate, roasted coffee, and some campfire aromas are dominate. Some westcoast hops seem to be wafting in the background. Mouthfeel is full bodied, rich and creamy, yet has a mild spicy hop twang. Nicely carbonated. Taste is dark chocolate and roasted coffee, as might be expected, but you can easily sense some hop character. Campfire smokiness is present throughout, but is understated. Some dark fruits try to emerge as it nears room temperature, but get knocked back by the bittering hops. This is a very well crafted brew, but is a bit too heavy in character for my preference in a Porter. This one seems a lot closer to a Stout than a Porter. Too thick and rich to get superlative marks on drinkability.","merlin48","Jan 31, 2004"

Of course, it's no Schlenkerla as far as smoked beers go, but you know it's not trying to be that kind of a smoked beer. Sometimes less is better, and if this beer was more aggressively smoked, I'm not so sure I'd like it as much. It's found a certain kind of chi.

In my opinion, it has the proper color, hearty balance of hops and malt, nice mouthfeel and a lingering finish. Although I cant detect anything special about the malt notes.

That said, perhaps my expectations were just too high -- it's a good beer, and if I'm really looking for a load of hops, I'll look here again. But, in my opinion, for a smoked porter, this is far from well-balanced.

The smell is that of most good porters - roasted malt, notes of black coffee - but with a beguiling smokiness hovering in the background. This smokiness sets the mood without dominating it. The taste is again a study in smoky restraint. The coffeeish, roasted malt taste is filled out and accentuated by the smoke flavor, which adds a rich, silkiness to the proceedings. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy, like any good porter. This is a wonderful beer, and I deeply regret having purchased only one.

Its topped of by a thick and creamy tan head that dissipates moderately, leaving a thick, sticky film on the sides of the glass. Every time I smell the sweet aroma I detect a different scent. The major aromas are roasted malts, coffee, dark chocolate, and caramel with just a hint of butterscotch. There is a great balance of charred oak smokiness intermixed with the sweet aromas. The taste matches the aroma perfectly; ever aroma that I detected is represented very well on the palate. There is a nice coffee-like aftertaste that lingers around for a while. This is a beautifully well-balanced, full bodies brew. I could see myself drinking this beer all night long. Its absolutely wonderful.","Scooter77","Aug 22, 2003"

Heavy molasses rolls across the tongue and the finish leaves some bitter coffee and raisin. A bit of smokey tingle in the aftertaste. Brown sugar and toffee come out as the glass warms.

The smoke smell didn't dominate the traditional porter aromas of bitter roasted coffee. Taste was much the same. Smokiness was no where near dominate and let the subtle good porter flavors show through. Hints of creamy chocolate show through, or am I dreaming ? Wow what a tremendous beer. No where near as smoky as those August Schlenka Rauchbeers. Full bodied, very much inline with what you would expect from a porter.

It was very, very dark, and the head was remarkably tight -- almost nitro-tight -- and dark tan as well. I thought I was looking at more of a stout. The aromas were nice, though I was hoping for just a tiny bit more of a "smoky" aroma. Definitely chocolate and sweet sensations, though. Very full-bodied with some big chocolate flavors. I really enjoyed it and thought it was exceptionally drinkable -- but I wanted intensity, passion, and, goddammit, smoke!

The fairly high hops with light a metallic and somewhat grapefruity bitterness deserve some attention as well. Lightly sweet with a dry edged body. A hint of dark chocolate and coffee offer contrasting flavors to offset both the malt sweetness and hop bitterness. A smoky edge is more apparent in the aroma than in flavor. A light hop floral bouquet and sweet malt give way to a comforting smokiness. The beige/tan head dissipates at its own slow pace then lingers as fine lace.

Leaves a nice dryness on the tongue, I am guessing this beer goes really well with a nice juicy steak. Very good porter, if just getting into rauchbier this is a nice one to start with, very mild smoke taste and aroma. All together very well done, everything is tied together to form a complete full flavor. A medium to light bodied porter, this beer definitely turns the tongue into a desert, very dry mouthfeel. All in all very drinkable smoked porter, but even with my love for Stone this is a dinner beer for me.

It keeps a creamy collar and thin surface covering throughout the glass, and leaves good lace as well. The nose is quite enticing, with a chocolate and caramel base that's enhanced by a soft peat-smokiness. The smoke is just enough to add to, and enhance, the aroma of the beer. The body is medium/full, creamy, and velvety smooth in the mouth. The flavor, much like the aroma and mouthfeel, is quite smooth and round. This beer is exceptionally well balanced in all regards. It's softly sweet with a combination of milk chocolate and caramel, a light touch of smoke, a supportive bitterness and some background hop flavors. It finishes with a lingering roastiness, mild smokiness, and dull bitterness followed by some light, grassy hop flavor. Although the subtle smoke gets lost in the flavor over the course of the glass, it remains in the nose. Very nicely done, and highly drinkable with just enough smoke to give it a little bit of complexity and keep it interesting throughout one or two.

4.17,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Black with a touch of amber, if you hold it up to the light, and a thin but persistent head. Aroma of chocolate, a touch of coffee, and a light touch of smoke. The flavor begins with coffee and a bit of chocolate... with some spicy and slightly bitter hops blending in. The smoke flavor complements the beer very well, but in no way overpowers it. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, with a medium body and low carbonation. A very well done beer.","zerk","Jan 03, 2003"

4.1,2.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"After trying some of Stone's other offerings I expected an over the top, smoky, thick porter on the imperial side. What I found was a very nice, medium bodied, roasty porter that was tasty and very drinkable. To me the smokiness was negligible, but this didn't detract from it's merits as a decent brew, in fact it was one of the better porters around, just not quite what I expected. A nicely balanced beer with plenty of bittersweet chocolate and coffee and a subtle hop bite in the finish. Another fine Stone brew.","QXSTER1","Dec 15, 2002"
4.29,7,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Very balanced taste. Dark malt (yet without that deep roasted bitterness..spot on for a porter) and sweeter malt with enough hops to keep the sweetness in check. The mouthfeel is lush and medium-bodied. A subtle smokiness comes through in the finish and sticks around on your palate, very nicely done.","johnrobe","Dec 14, 2002"
3.81,-5,4,3,4,4.5,4,"I'm not an experienced drinker of smoked Porters so I have little basis for comparison. I like the look of the beer. Nice and dark with a decent head. The aroma was subtle and I tried to pick up the smokiness but really couldn't. Mostly it smelled like a pale ale just not as hoppy and citrusy.The beer has a nice velvety mouthfeel but was a lot crisper than I thought it would be. I expected either chocolatey or bitter or both. I was a little disappointed in the amount of smoke in the taste (after all this was my first experience with a smoked beer). It was there but very faint and in the background. I should say that I'm a huge Stone fan so I hold their beers up to a very, very high standard. This beer was good but not as rich and smokey as I would have liked. I drank it cold (right out of the 'fridge) and perhaps too cold. I think I'll try it again when the weather gets brutally cold and I'll let the beer warm up to closer to room temperature","mickstepp","Dec 08, 2002"
3.88,-3.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This porter pours a deep rich black with garnet highlights. The head is a light carmel color with lots of staying power. The aroma is malty with notes of smoke and dried fruit. The taste starts smooth with plenty of malt flavor and finishes with a smokey bite and an aftertaste of hop spiciness and smoke. The mouthfeel is quite velvety and smooth. A very enjoyable porter. The smokiness is balanced with the sweetness of the malt quite well. Personally I wish there was a little more umph (sp?) to it. I feel like I have been teased in that it left me expecting more than I got. None the less this is a very nice porter. Has potential to be a great porter.","purplehops","Dec 07, 2002"
4.17,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Very dark, almost black in color with a 1/4 inch tan head. Robust and full bodied but not over powering. The smoke is well balanced with the rest of the beer. There are hints of chocolate in the beginning that give way to the smoke flavor. Redbones has this on tap and I can't wait!","CharlesRiver","Nov 30, 2002"
4.37,9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours dark brown to black and somewhat opaque. Brownish head. Aroma is of smoke and roasted malts. Taste is of chocolate and coffee and of course smoke. The smoked malts really give this beer character and a unique flavor. Fairly heavy for a porter. IMO, Stone's is a little heavier and maybe a little sweeter than the Alaskan Smoked Porter. Personally, I prefer the Alaskan slightly over the Stone, but take your pick, they are both exceptional beers. I'm beginning to hold Stone Brewing in very high regard.","PhantomVodoo","Nov 28, 2002"

And the lace seemed to last to the end of the glass. The aroma is deep malt, lightly smoked, caramel, and even a hint of coffee and elements of chocolate. The taste is of a sweet malt, caramel hints of coffee/chocolate and smoke. It is nicely hopped, and I really enjoyed the smoke qualities in this beer.","Jarod","Nov 26, 2002"

First sip starts out with a slickness coupled withfaint chocolate flavors that turns into roasted coffee like flavor in the middle. The lingering aftertaste is very dry and roasted. After my first swallow, I was wondering where the smoke flavor was, then about 10 seconds later it kicks in and is very nice - not overpowering at all. After each swallow the flavors just seem to last in your mouth forever.","Longstaff","Oct 22, 2002"

4.7,17.2,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"As deep as garnet gets, before we call it brown, the head is "Chocolate", frothy, long lasting; the lace clings in thick sheets till the very bottom of the glass. Nose is deep malt, lightly smoked, sweet, caramel, and even a hint of coffee. Front is sweet malt, the top is medium to full, the finish is of course "Smokey", nicely hopped, light to moderate carbonation, dry, and a nice long lasting bitter after taste. Call me a "Stone-o-phile", but I like the over the top hops, high ABV, big malts and that robustness, only found in a few brewers beers, such as "Alesmith".","Gusler","Sep 30, 2002"
3.85,-4,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a deep dark color with a thick head. I was a bit disappointed with lack of smoke in the aroma. Being a Stone brew, I expected to be overwhelmed with a smokey aroma that would bring back memories of camping. With the lack in aroma, it is made up for in taste. You can taste the smoke, but it doesn't overwhelm you. This is probably the worst Stone brew I've had, but that doesn't make this a bad beer. I wouldn't have any problems buying this beer again. I just expected more out of this beer coming from a great brewer like Stone.","sinistersteve","Sep 21, 2002"
4.77,19,4.5,5,4.5,5,5,"Almost completely opaque. Light brown head composed of tiny bubbles that stays pretty well. Quite a bit in the nose, lots of smoked peaty malt, chocolate, and caramel backed by leafy hops. As for the taste, the expected smoked grain. This is most apparent with retro-olfaction, but is definitely a big presence throughout. Lots of roasted grain and dark chocolate, very bittersweet up front. Leafy and slightly rind-like hops come out more in the back, but are subtle and balance perfectly with the malt. Very slight fruitiness, plum-like. Perfectly smooth and creamy mouthfeel. I'm a big fan of smoked beers, and this one is amazing. I am very impressed, I love this beer. I bow to the great gargoyle.","hyuga","Aug 29, 2002"

3.03,-24.4,4.5,4,2.5,4,2,"Up to now, I've liked every Stone beer I've had the chance to try.  This was almost true for the Smoked Porter, but it is the defining character, the smoke, that turned me off.  Beautiful to behold in the glass.  The nose was a surprising sweet, thin chocolate.  Up front, a very nice robust porter.  Then the smoke flavor emerged at the end, and I found it to be a disconcerting stale bar-smoke like flavor, rather than a peat or wood smoke.  Had this been a straight porter, I think I would have loved it.","Brent","Aug 14, 2002"
4.38,9.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Another great beer from Stone. This one is not as edgy as Arrogant Bastard but still unique. Very dark color with a thin and lasting beige head. The aroma is smokey of course. Medium body, and the smoked flavor was not overpowering and complemented the malt perfectly. Slight bitter chocolate in the aftertaste. Well done.","Dogbrick","Aug 13, 2002"
4.27,6.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Virtually black in hue, w/ deep garnet aorund the rim when held to light.  Persistant beige head leaves loose lace.  Chocolate malt, carob, butterscotch, dark caramel and smooth black patent comprise the aroma, while smokey peated malt is surprisingly subdued.  Quite appetizing aromawise.  The malt profile is very smooth & lacks any black patent sharpness, allowing mellow chocolate and dark caramel malt to provide a flavorful base sweetness.  Hop bitterness, although secondary, counters this sweetness well, lending an overall cleanly bittersweet chocolate profile.  The use of peated malt is conservative but adequate enough to add a pleasant smokey undertone.  Moderately bodied, w/ a dextrinous and enjoyable mouthfeel.  Finishes very clean, w/ chocolate flavors abruptly ending but light peat smoke briefly lingering.  This is a tasty, well balanced and highly drinkable porter-- It's perhaps the most subtle brew by Stone I've had.  Agreeably mellow.","marc77","Aug 09, 2002"
4.47,11.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours almost as black as black can be, only the barest hints of light getting around the edge.  The brew has a nice brown head on it to start but once that fades there is no lace at all and no more head.  Huge roasted coffee, chocolate, and smoke aromas dominate.  Starts off like a straight up porter with some nice bitter coffee and roasted malt flavors before fading into a bittersweet dark chocolate taste.  The porter taste fades and the beer appears to be done but then a huge smoked quality comes in and slaps you in the face.  Smooth and creamy, this is one seriously drinkable beer.  Damn these guys know what they are doing.  A big thanks to Greg and Co. for making these beers.","Murph","Jul 31, 2002"

4,-0.2,4,4,4,4,4,"The flavors in some order (changes sip to sip) - citrus hop; an oiliness similar to that found in an oatmeal stout; smoky maltiness; chocolatey maltiness; roasted coffee maltiness.  Take the late, lamented Big Indian Porter, subtract some of the malt, add in hops & smoke, and you have this beer. This is NOT a bad thing at all. The finish is very nice - a little sweet, with some smoky-roasty-dry malt overtones.","sponberg","Jul 15, 2002"
3.93,-2,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"It's close to black with a surprisinlgly strong tan head.  Even after it warmed, it gave off only a slight smell, with the smoke just barely detectable.  The smoke flavor is also subtle with lots of nice roasty malt swimming around.  Drinking it is a bit like chewing on a little bit of black patent and chocolate malt.","mickeymac","Jul 11, 2002"
3.9,-2.7,4,4,4,4,3.5,"It's a cross between the smell of your clothes the morning after you stayed up late staring into the campfire and stale cigarette smoke. That's the dominate aspect of the character, or at least the middle anyway. The beginning is more a good porter, warm and malty without crossing into stout territory. The ending is bitter hops with the lingering stale smoke. Actually, given the almost pitch black color and tan head of this beer, I'm surprised the malt doesn't play a stronger role in the flavor of this beer. This would be excellent with grilled pork or some of the smokier barbeque I've had.","aracauna","Jul 08, 2002"
