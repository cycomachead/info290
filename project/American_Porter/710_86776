3.48,2.4,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 3/17/2014. Pours crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of milk chocolate, vanilla, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light nuttiness, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and vanilla notes; with decent strength. Taste of milk chocolate, vanilla, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light cocoa, light nuttiness, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Minimal roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, vanilla, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light cocoa/nuttiness, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Good balance, complexity, and solid robustness of dark/bready malt and vanilla flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth and lightly creamy mouthfeel that is okay. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a solid vanilla porter. All around good balance, complexity, and solid robustness of dark/bready malt and vanilla flavors; and very smooth to drink. Definitely very toned down for a porter, but the flavors were quite nice and balanced. A pleasantly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 27, 2015"

Very light hints of vanilla on nose, more overpowered by maltiness. Vanilla more readily apparent on tongue, with background notes of cherries, milk chocolate, brown sugar and a fleeting hint of raspberries. Carbonation floods the tongue then fades away fairly quickly. Creamy and smooth feel, almost chewy. Somewhat hard to discern that it is 6% abv. Tastes lighter to me. Overall, a decent dessert beer. Nothing to write home about, but palatable and pleasant. Would taste good on vanilla ice cream!","sporklift87","Feb 20, 2015"

As a regular porter, it’s pretty decent, possessing some good roasted malt and slight smoke flavors balanced with some nice caramel-like sweetness, but as its advertised as a vanilla porter, and because it has very little vanilla in it, I find it to be very disappointing.   If I’m in the mood for a vanilla porter, I’ll grab either the one made by Breckenridge or Ballast Point’s Victory at Sea, both of which are infinitely better beers.","Jeffreysan","Jan 25, 2015"

4,17.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Leinenkugel's Snowdrift Vanilla Porter brewed by Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company, with an ABV of 6.0%  This brew pours out dark brown color with a nice off white head.  Snowdrift Vanilla Porter has the look of cola, not saying that's a bad thing. The smell is rich with malts and grains.  You also pick up on a hit of vanilla. Now for the taste, it is bold with flavor. You also pick up on tossed malts and grains.  There is also a mild vanilla sweetness at the end.  Leinenkugel's Snowdrift Vanilla Porter has a lot going on. The mouthfeel is bold but smooth. There is nothing overpowering in this brew, it has a nice balance to it.  Overall I'm giving  Leinenkugel's Snowdrift Vanilla Porter  a 4 out 5.  Nothing bad about this brew.  I would buy this brew again.  Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company did a nice job with this brew.","nicholas2121","Dec 20, 2014"

Popping the top I get a deep roasted waft with vanilla undertones.  Pours into the SAPP to an opaque motor oil color with a twofinger tan head that recedes to one finger.  On the taste the brew starts with a toasted flavor very quickly followed by a sweet and barky vanilla stomp.  Mouthfeel seems a bit thin and the vanilla a bit overpowering, making it taste more like a Mr. Pibb than a vanilla flavored porter.  Much too sweet without any pronouned bite to take the edge off.  Might taste better as a hot toddy.","mooseisloose","Dec 06, 2014"

The Crack! was loud enough to sound Reveille throughout the house and once everyone had heaved out and triced up, it was time for an inverted Glug. The dark beers really cry out for this as the pseudo-cascade is much more evident in them. It settled into a dense, two-finger cap of light-brown head with great retention. Color was a deep-brown with garnet/ruby highlights (SRM = > 37, < 44) and it was as beautiful a beer as I have seen in a while. Nose smelled of vanilla, coffee and chocolate and I may have had this in a different, hotter form at Starbucks at some point. Just sayin' ... Mouthfeel was pretty full for a porter and the vanilla and chocolate were prevalent initially, giving 'way to the coffee roastiness. I was happy to note that they reigned in the roasted malts as this could have been way too bitter. Instead, the flavors meshed nicely to provide a pleasant, but not overpowering, sweetness to the melange. I even enjoyed the relatively sweet finish although, as a self-avowed hophead, this is not my usual cuppa tea. Truth in advertising at its finest.","woodychandler","Jan 31, 2014"

However, a friend of mine was raving about the vanilla flavor so I was surprised at the strong fruit flavor. Its very fruit forward with the strongest being cherry. It feels as though the ingredients were just mixed together and immediately bottles. The color also wasnt as dark and somewhat red tinged (or maybe that was my imagination). Lastly, it was definitely thin. I do want to try it again 'with a different mindset' but I dont have high hopes.","deadxmastrees","Jan 06, 2014"

Aroma has an interesting mix of dark cocoa, hints of vanilla, and mild coffee accents from the dark roasted barley malts added to this beer. Flavor is dry and bitter with baker's chocolate, toasted malts, hints of soft sweet caramelized malt sugars, and a hint of vanilla character. The dark roasted malts has a bit of sour acidity from the dark malts or mix of creaminess from the vanilla and dark roasted malts nice mix of cocoa/coffee roasts in the malt character makes it, no alcohol presence weighs in at 6% abv. Pretty tasty crossover beer, makes a solid offering for winter and thank God it's not fizzy and yellow, or fruit/wheat infusion. They have done a nice jobs with their seasonal offering lately, keep it up Leinenkugel's!!! Mouthfeel has some nice creamy textures medium to light bodied for a porter but rock solid carbonation levels. Overall a welcomed addition to the Leinenkugel/MillerSAB family.","WVbeergeek","Dec 05, 2013"

It was also good enough fro me to remember a year later as I saw this out and grabbed a bottle to refresh my memory. This is one of the best porters I have had. It is well balanced and easy to drink. It's low ABV makes it a great session ale and at around 15 bucks for a 12 pack, it's a steal! Try this beer if you like smooth, easy drinking stouts and porters.","mitch3114","Jul 14, 2013"

A tingle of green hops runs down the center. The feel is lighter to medium bodied with a too thin and astringent presence in the mouth. Just a touch of sharpness at least adds a little something to this. This was a pretty weak Porter in all categories and I just didn’t care for it a whole lot. Next…","Kegatron","Mar 15, 2013"

Smell is very faint, sweet, vanilla and roasted malt. Taste seems like it is trying to be a russian imperial stout, the alcohol comes through, but it isn't a very high ABV. Starts with almost an aluminum flavor (even though this was from a bottle), and kicks into an artificial vanilla, with some roasted malt, but middle and end are dominated by the alcohol flavor. The aftertaste has some roasted notes but the alcohol is still king of the palette. Mouthfeel is too harsh, with a medium light body. Overall the beer could have had a few minor changes to come out a decent porter. I would pass on this one, many other great porters out there.","wingman14","Feb 15, 2013"

The nose hit offers a distinctive charcoal malt with a delicate vanilla carmel sweetness. Not very strong but pleasant for sure. The flavor brings out a fizzy vanilla malt with a grassy edge that hints of charcoal and root beer. This seasonal offering is medium-light bodied with somewhat overactive carbonation while finishing with a somewhat chalky feel.

Pleasant aroma of chocolate, toasted malt and vanilla. Flavor follows, with sweet toasted malt, vanilla, nuts and a hint of chocolate. Similar to a nut brown ale. Light to medium bodied. Expecting a bit more body from a porter, but the flavors are nice, well integrated and pleasant tasting. A decent light bodied porter.","LiquidAmber","Feb 10, 2013"

It has a very pleasant taste that is well balanced. The body is a little thin but then again it is a porter and not a stout so with that said it is pretty good with good carbonation. I prefer breckinridge vanilla porter over this but it is still a good beer.

Little to no hop flavor or bitterness is detected. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet creamy mouthfeel. I bought some Big Eddy Imperial stout a few years back and I was blown away. Since that time I keep trying their regular beers hoping to revisit the magic, but it just doesn't seem to happen.

2.45,-27.9,3.5,1,3,2,3,"Initially, it pours a very thin head of about half a finger, which dissipates quickly leaving moderate lacing. The look is a deep, dark, brownish-black with just a tint of red when it catches the light. The nose is deceptive and it doesn’t hold much of a smell when compared to its strong taste. A malty porter with a complicated palate but a lingering cocoa after taste that is reminiscent of a dark chocolate candy bar. I really like the way a vanilla-coffee flavor bursts at first taste followed by the overbearing cocoa finish to really add a varied taste experience. The Snowdrift holds a slight bitterness to it, almost like coffee and the mouthfeel is strongly carbonated but smooth. This is a bit more on the darker and bitterer side than most beers but pretty standard for a porter. It warms the drinker and is perfect for enjoying on a snowy winter night while cozied up in a ski chalet somewhere.","FratyardVines","Dec 04, 2012"

This beer didn't have the best drinkability it was smooth, but the flavors didn't hold my attention so one would be enough for me, there's no need to drink two in a row. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it wasn't the greatest but it turned out to be the highlight of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the watered down flavor and mouthfeel, it needed to be bolder, richer, and less carbonated. I won't be buying this beer again, I would much rather have a Vanilla Java Porter from Atwater the flavors come through much better in that beer, I wouldn't recommend this beer. All in all I was let down with this beer, it seemed to lack those robust flavors that a good Porter should have and the mouthfeel also held this beer back, I'm chalking this one up as another average at best Leinenkugel's beer, I thought Fireside Nut Brown was a much better winter seasonal.","StoutHunter","Nov 23, 2012"

The brew smells like vanilla, roasted malt, milk chocolate and some coffee. The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, except that the chocolate flavor is both bittersweet and milk chocolate. Also, I think the flavors are a little stronger in comparison to the aroma. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit smooth and creamy. I think it's a solid brew.

Let's find out: This stuff pours a deep ruby-sienna topped by a finger of light khaki foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, toasted barley, and some mild chocolate in the deep recesses. The taste holds notes of roasted malts, cocoa, vanilla bean, and a touch of light bubblegum at the very end. Things are kinda chalky all-around, though, detracting somewhat from what could have been a pretty tasty vanilla porter. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly smooth feel. Overall, a nice porter, one that deals with the vanilla pretty well (meaning they don't either overdo it or make it ridiculously sweet). Not bad.","TMoney2591","Nov 20, 2012"

Leiny's has been known to lay an egg from time to time and I think this is one them. While drinking it, or forcing it down, I kept looking to see if it was almost gone because I was sick of it.

I wished I had bought something else. Leinenkuge calls it a porter, but it tastes nothing like a porter. The taste is like caramelized water with a hint of vanilia. It sort of tastes like bitter root beer.
