4.3,7.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Had to pick this up at the Novato, CA Bevmo as I cannot get it across the Bay. Snifter pour and I am met with a hazy apricot colored ale and a nice fluffy cream colored foamy head. The aroma consists of butterscotch, dried apricots, slight orange and a hint of alcohol in each whiff. The taste is fruity...almost like biting into a juicy fruit. A blast of bitterness and sweetness are produced together. The label states it is "sherry-like" and I do not disagree. There are some wheat-ish characteristics (which is to be expected) but very subdued. There is also a dull grapefruit aftertaste that stays on the tongue. Mouthfeel is relatively smooth. Overall I wish I could get this closer to home but it is definitely worth the scenic drive to bring a few bottles home. This may be a little too sweet for some, but it is a refreshing change to the mass of beers produced. Great beer.","kaseydad","Aug 07, 2011"
4.42,10.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a hazy honey orange color with a 1 inch whitish-orange head that fades to a thin cap. Nice foamy rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus fruits (especially oranges), orange juice, and some honey notes. Taste is of citrus zest, orange juice, and honey flavors. Very nice smells and tastes with this one. There is a slightly acidic quality that hits in the back of the throat. This beer is crisp and smooth with a slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer and the first wheatwine I have ever had. I think this is a really tasty beer and I will definitely get more of these going forward.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 29, 2011"

3.87,-3.3,3.5,4,4,3,4,"Star Brew Triple Wheat Ale pours an absolutely pristine clear orange. A hard pour results in about four fingers of bone colored head. Retention is alright, but lacing is practically nonexistent. The beer smells exactly like candied orange peel. There's a nonspecific sweetness that plays nicely against the zesty citrus hop notes. The flavor takes that basic profile and just refines it. What was a general sugary sweetness can now be described as a healthy dose of honey, with just a swirl of caramel to keep things interesting. It's enough to take the bite off of any bitterness from the hops and leave things open for the finish. Orange is joined by suggestions of grapefruit and lemon, as well as some pale fruits that. There's also a subtle, but definite heat from alcohol on the back end. It's not loud enough to ruin my enjoyment the beer, but is enough to keep it from being truly great. The body is nice and middle of the road, neither especially rich nor thin. The carbonation though barely registers, and results in the beer coming across as a bit syrupy. Star Brew Triple Wheat Ale is a slightly different drinking experience, and one that's somewhat enjoyable despite its slight flaws.","axeman9182","Jun 18, 2011"

The beer is a bit hot-I think that’s where the horseradish or whatever it is is coming from. Medium bodied with a slick texture. Smooth, but hot. A decent beer with some nice flavors going on.","trappistlover","Apr 28, 2011"
4.46,11.5,5,4,5,4,4,"Pours an orange color with bubbles constantly rising so that's a good sign. High lacing with grapefruit aromas. Notes of orange on the tongue after the alcohol burn wears off which is about 2 seconds. If it weren't for the burn I'd swear I was drinking orange soda. At 9.2% this is a good sipper since the fruity aspects hide that.","BigB415","Feb 21, 2011"
4.15,3.8,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Hazy golden hue with two finger white head. Sweet, sugar, alcohol aromas. There's some sherry wine aroma in there too. There's some wood aroma, too. Wood soaked in sherry. The sherry flavors dominate this rather smooth concoction. Nice, mild carbonation. Smooth, tropical fruit (melon) flavors as well. The mouthfeel is a little thick, but not as much as previous batches. Unfortunately, there's no bottle date. I've had this beer before and this particular bottle seems rather tame. Usually the sherry/wine flavors are too strong, this is actually pretty damn good. It's not sticky. The malt comes through pretty good, almost like burnt grain, but not smokey. The wine and melon flavors are a really good combination. For such a big beer, this one is really mellow. Good for sipping, I'd like to buy another one and age.","100floods","Dec 22, 2010"

To be honest, there is probably more here that I'm not getting, but I can tell you that I keep getting more every time I smell this beer & it's pretty damn good!

It had a solid bitterness, citrusy hop flavour, some toasted cereal, fruit, and a spicy alcohol finish. The aftertaste brought forward a piney character that wasn't apparent until that point. The carbonation was very fine and quite creamy, lower than expected. Full bodied with a pleasing texture, a bit of stickiness, and mild warmth. Overall, a very well made beer.

3.85,-3.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours yellowy gold and very clear with a small white head that recedes quickly. Aroma is soft honey sweetness, hints of prunes and ripe fruit. Hints of sweet citrus in the aroma as well. Taste is also fruity, some very subtle citrus, with a nice nutty wheatiness that develops mid taste and lingers into the aftertaste. Medium to heavy in body, decent bitterness and a good sized drying mixes with a slightly sweet and cloying finish. Alcohol is very well balanced but evident in the taste. An easy to sip beer, very subtle aroma and taste wise, nothing reaches out and grabs you. The wheat presence is most evident in the taste and is quite nice.","hoppymeal","May 24, 2007"

I have grown to *love* the Marin Star Brew <insert number> Triple Wheat Ale, and always pick up a couple of bottles each year. An annual favorite that, despite its reported lower ABV from last year, is still a damned fine and tasty brew - well worth seeking out!

3.61,-9.8,4,3,3.5,4.5,4,"Poured from the 22oz bottle into my Duvel tulip glass. A darker golden body is topped by about an inch of sturdy, creamy white head that leaves minimal lacing on the glass. Not a whole lot of aroma - light caramel malt, a touch of dark fruit, some grassy hops, and a generous whiff of alcohol. Palate is light mellow wheat and malt, becoming sweeter towards the finish. A moderate hop profile holds notes of sweet plum, grass, and a touch of pine. Body is velvety smooth, with very light, mellow carbonation - just beautiful. Although the high alcohol content makes it a tricky proposition to tackle an entire bottle, this is a highly enjoyable beer. Find a friend to share it with.","ElGordo","Aug 20, 2006"

Never having had a wheat wine, I can't compare to other beers in the style, but I can say that I will be trying more within this style when I get the chace. Really a delicious brew that is worth seeking out.","mitchfor3","Aug 15, 2006"

4.43,10.8,4.5,4,5,4,4,"Drinkability- Because of it's sweetness, it's not an everyday beer or even close to any kind of session beer. Probably a really good beer to have every once and a while though.

3.15,-21.3,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Mouthfeel and drinkability - nice amount of carbonation and left a little bit of bitterness at the end.

The nose has some bubblegum, a little touch of biscuit, backed by a lemony citrus character. The taste has a quick punch of bubblegum, followed very quickly by herbal hop and mild citrus. Hard candy character on the finish along with a bit of alcohol heat. Mildly sticky mouth feel. OK drinkability.

Cloying & malt liquorish.","Crosling","Mar 31, 2006"
4.49,12.3,4,5,4.5,4.5,4,"Flavor is not as strikingly complex, yet yields more and more nuances as it warms. Mild sherry comes through, and the hops bite more and more as it sits, which better balances the esters, and yes, the booze. It's like an impatient kid playing hide-and-seek. He hides well, but after you let him sit long enough he starts looking for YOU. Spices interplay well with the serious wheat bill this brew is packing, all making for a very enjoyable experience. Carbonation is light. This pup's delicious. More and more impressed with this brewery (and Moylan's) every time I try a new one.

3.78,-5.5,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"This beer is a classic example of temperature making all the difference. There was nothing especially outstanding about the nose or look on the pour. It was golden, clear with subtle hop and alcohol in the nose. Tasting it cold, there was nothing to write home about. As it warmed it was crisp clean and boozy with some vanilla in the aftertaste. The malts and alcohol dominate  I hate to say like a malt liquor but this is what it reminded me of. A rare beer style that should be experienced- not my cup of tea but a good buzz for trying.","lou91","Sep 23, 2005"
3.85,-3.8,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"2002 Vintage bottle with the number 2280 in big numbers in the middle of the label. This beer poured with a very interesting look to it. The color was pinkish orange with a thin swirling head on top. The pink color in it was like something you'd see in pink lemonade or grapefruit juice. Very good looking beer. The aroma of the beer was wheaty and bready wit ha touch of burned sugar sweetness. The flavor comes on strong like a barleywine. It has a sweet syrupy flavor with hop bitterness at the end and tangy caramel notes in the middle. If there were such a thing as a Wheat-Barley Wine, this would be it.","BrewMaster","Nov 19, 2004"
4.28,7,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"2003 vintage, *2450* from a 22oz bomber. The initial pour delivers a surprisingly clear, deep golden body with the exception that particulate can clearly be seen rising and falling amidst its turbulent, effervescent carbonation. A second pour, however, changes all that and it takes on the haze normally associated with the style. The foamy, bright-white head holds exceptionally well and leaves solid sheets of lace about the glass. The nose is yeasty and fruity with a touch of pepper, citrusy with hops, and backed by a wheatish malt. The body is medium-full (or is it full-medium?) and the natural, effervescent carbonation bristles on the tongue. Its flavor is bold and rich with a slap of lightly-tart fruit and yeast at the outset, followed by a luxurious wheat-based maltiness. A peppery spiciness appears towards the swallow; and it finishes dry but with a note of sweet, sugar-cookie-dough-like malt that lingers amidst a gentle spiciness from the alcohol. It's an impressive brew; yet it may be slightly over-done as the alcohol becomes obvious even within a twelve ounce serving (cutting down on its drinkability). Still, this is an excellent beer to enjoy while relaxing in the backyard on a cool summer evening as the sun sets. Recommended.","NeroFiddled","May 22, 2004"

Appearance: Deep orange slight cloudiness with a massive cream colored head that is quite resilient. lacing stays in thick patches appearance is all bueno here.

Taste: Nuts, cream, fruit undertones, hop bitterness leaving it's mark in full, a massive wave of flavors that have to be picked apart this is a tough one here. I found this beer while living in SoCal but never gave it a shot, so here I am well over a year trying it a gain I thought a triple wheat sounded interesting and boy was I right, with a bready belgian yeast sharp tones of wheat malt this beer is incredible still after the aging process I am currently searching for a fresh sample to compare so send it my way.

4.7,17.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Hot damn, this was a big surprise and one of the best beers I've tried in while. Enjoyed from a bomber ebmossed with Marin's logo and "Star Brew 2280," it's a 2002 vintage. It's honey-color with a fairly large white head that leaves lace all the way down the glass. The smell is sweet and candy or bubble-gum like. Hops mingle nicely with the sweet smell. The bottle says it's "sherry-like." Maybe sherry-like flavors are present, but mainly it's a thoroughly enjoyable sweetness that is not the least bit cloying. The mouthfeel is delightful, and this beer gives no clue that it weighs in at 9% abv. This one's a masterpiece that I've left sitting in the cooler on many previous trips to the shop. I won't make that mistake again.","mickeymac","Apr 08, 2003"
4.8,20,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Wow, this is a great brew from the start. It poured a hazy golden amber with very little foam on the head. The smell was of hops and malt with a hint of caramel. The taste was of a heavenly nature. A complexity of malts and hops, with a sweetness/bitterness that is well balanced. I highly reccommend this beer and will try to buy up all that is left. This has to be one of my top 25 beers.","BeerManDan","Jan 31, 2003"
4.77,19.3,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Pours a crystal clear golden orange color with a nice thick white head on top that lasts a fair time.  Huge malty aromas with some big fruitiness as well.  Possibly some grapefruit/oranges and some darker/sweeter fruits with a nice vinous quality.  Sweet malty sweetness not unlike what you would get from a barley wine but not as heavy.  Complex fruitiness like a BW as well but on the lighter side as well with some lemon/orange/grapefruit flavors as well as some slightly tart grape/vinous quality.  The alcohol makes itself known only in its warming qualities.   Velvety smooth and very creamy and very easy to drink due to its wheat beer lighness.  This "Wheatwine" is a lot like a barley wine but light in color, body, and types of flavors.  It still has all the great complexity of flavors but lighter fruits, body, etc.  Somewhat like somparing a dubbel and a tripel.  Lighter in body and color but equally as complex and flavorful.  This is one great brew and I will have to get a few to cellar.","Murph","Oct 12, 2002"
4.69,17.3,4,5,5,4.5,4,"Slightly hazy light orange in hue, covered by an ivory white head that settles into a very tight layer that leaves intricate lace.  Citrusy hops hit the nose upfront, then are ensued by spicy alcohol and sweet green fruit esters reminecent of kiwi and white grapes coupled with grainy wheat tartness. Very intriguing aromawise. Caramel malt and butterscotch become discernible as the brew warms and the volatile hop oils dissipate. Flavorwise, smoothly sweet medium caramel malt quickly gives way to nutty and buttery notes, leaving an initial impression of rich peanut brittle.  This then yields to a melange of a citric hop flavor, subdued wheat tartness and candy coated apple sweetness.  Moderate and clean hop bitterness oddly emerges after hop flavor towards the end of the taste, partially offsetting the assertive caramel malt presence.  The combination of fairly low carbonation, ample residual dextrins and wheat protein that escaped fining and/or filtration lend a smooth, viscous and slick mouthfeel.  Finishes w/ a bittersweet combo of brown sugar sweetness and light hop bitterness.  The myriad of flavors hide the relatively high alcohol content.  Star Brew Triple is a rich consortium of buttery malt, light wheat tartness, and signature citrusy west coast hopping.  This brew epitomizes American microbrew creativity.  Delicious and truly unique.","marc77","Aug 28, 2002"
