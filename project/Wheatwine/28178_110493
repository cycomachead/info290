Nice to try, but not something I might seek out again.","johnnnniee","Dec 05, 2014"

3.93,0.3,3.75,3.75,4,4,4,"Batch #293296. Poured from a bomber into a snifter, the beer is a bright, vibrant, hazed, ruby-copper coloring with a thin, tightly bubbled, halo of off-white head. Aromas of pineapple, apricot, orange zest, and a subtle spice blend layer on the initial sniff, with a smooth and grainy backbone, some cinnamon and coriander spice, candied sugar, and a subtle booze note noticeable the more you dig your nose in. Flavors are robust and rich forward, with a smooth ribbon of tropical fruit highlighted with vanilla cream. Wow, pretty damn tasty. An almost immediate warmth hits your palate and throat, as well, but washes away in a slow fade. Woody notes, subtle spices (again), and a toasted bread backbone support all these transitions occurring on your palate. Smooth in mouth initially, but kept with a slight edge thanks to a slow, steady flow of carbonation throughout. The aftertaste is like candied fruit, with the pineapple, apricot, orange peel, and other sweet notes coming off with a slightly candied character. It's nice. The finish is slightly cloying, but again the carbonation cleans up just enough to keep things smooth and friendly. The increased ABV is hidden very well throughout, with the only nod given in the initial warmth you get. Solid brew!","GarthDanielson","Jun 07, 2014"
