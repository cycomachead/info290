4.04,-4.3,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a clear dark copper color with a foamy beige head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, caramel, brown sugar, and some slightly fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is easy to drink but I think the smell is better than the taste.","UCLABrewN84","Jan 08, 2012"

4.42,4.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I love this beer, maybe my favorite wheat wine. Poured a nice medium amber color, with a little bit of white foam on top. Big aromas here, with cotton candy, pear, some light hops and caramel. On the palate, this one is big, boozy and syrupy, but in a very good way, with big cotton candy flavors. An excellent interpretation of the style.","emmasdad","Dec 28, 2008"

4.27,1.2,3.5,4,4.5,5,4,"D: The best wheatwine I've had, though I haven't had much of the style. Very drinkable high alcohol brew.","Halcyondays","Jul 29, 2008"
3.93,-6.9,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"D-A sipper for sure, much akin to a brandy like beer. A late night, wintertime, fireside brew!","Deuane","Feb 03, 2008"
3.58,-15.2,3.5,3,3.5,4.5,4,"Pours a deep clear copper with lasting tan head ring and sheet lacing. The aroma is big with dark fruity esters, caramel and mild alcohol phenols. The taste begins with a welcoming thick viscous sludgy sensation that ushers in loads of fruity esters like cherries, dates, raisins and faint pepper. It also comes across as mildly hot. A boat load of fruity esters really showing up throughout. Could use more age. But at this age it is still yummy.","BigMcLargeHuge","Nov 10, 2007"
3.85,-8.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"D - Pretty good. Much better than last year's version, which tasted medicinal.","MisterClean","Jun 15, 2006"
4.3,1.9,4,4,4.5,5,4,"I give it a good drinkability because I enjoy a thick beer with tons of flavor, however some wouldn't call this a drinkable beer. It is an absolute sipper and 8oz will do just fine.","epearson","Nov 21, 2005"

4.35,3.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"A deep ruby with golden brown highlights, with just a light dusting of head. A strong alcohol aroma and hoppy one-two punch in the nose. The alcohol content's warming effects are noticeable, but there is also flavors not unlike fruit punch, with a slightly grainy kick to it. Goes down easy, but drinking more than one or two in a night seems like too much of a great thing.","germaniac","Beers"
4.33,2.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Very highly recommended, along with Rubicon's other yearly strong ale, the Blonde Bombshell Barleywine.","warmstorage","0"
