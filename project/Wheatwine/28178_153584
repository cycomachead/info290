Hint of oak and bourbon are throught the entire nose. Taste has more fruity aromas forward then the nose with flavors of orange, apple, caramel, bourbon and oak and a faint acidity in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium to thick in body with light carbonation and a slight dry sweet finish.","Fcolle2","Jan 28, 2015"
