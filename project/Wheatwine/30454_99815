2.74,-29.4,3.25,3,2.5,3.25,2.5,"Ah, finally having another wheatwine. It's been too long, kids... Anyway, this stuff pours a mostly clear amber topped by a half-finger or so of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises white bread, orange peel, mild booze, and a hint of cream. The taste ups the booze ante, along with the requisite burn; then there's a sense of off Cointreau being suffocated by wet white bread slathered in Country Crock. Then add a sprig of mint and astringent pine resin. Ooph. The body is a hefty medium, with a very light moderate carbonation, a slightly syrupy feel, and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, this was just an unpleasant wheatwi--make that an unpleasant beer in general. No nuance, no real niceness, this seems rather rough for a wheatwine.","TMoney2591","Feb 23, 2014"
