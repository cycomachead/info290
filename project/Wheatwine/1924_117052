4.29,8.1,3.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Overall â€“ This is a quite a wonderful barleywine. While rather sweet, the thick rye and bit of hop flavor that comes at the end of the taste really help balance the beer and make it a nice slow sipper. This flavor profile mixed with the wonderful aroma and fantastic feel, make this one a must try if you get a chance.","Darkmagus82","Jul 23, 2014"

4.25,7.1,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"The beer is opaque and dark brown with a thin, tan cap. The aroma brings brown bread, lots of booze (in a pleasant way), fruity esters , a hint of spice, perhaps some clove. Really big flavor. Rye bread and a delectable sweetness that never becomes cloying. I'm typically not a huge fan of wheatwines / ryewines, but this one really hit the mark. A surprise winner from DuClaw. Recommended.","Huhzubendah","Apr 14, 2014"
