3.91,-0.3,4,4.25,3.75,4,3.75,"Pours red/brown/copper. Strong smell of apple and fruit. Smell very sweet. Taste is sweet and boozy. Fruits and sugary candy. My first experience with a wheat wine. Don't get me wrong... It is good and worth a try. It is a bit on the sweet side for me. Maybe the jury is still out on this style for me.","Brackh","Jan 03, 2015"

3.9,-0.5,,,,,,"True to style with it's grainy sweetness, the originality of Vern's Wheat Wine is in its fruitiness. This is a great wheat wine with everything I look for in the style plus that interesting apple and cherry factor. I hope this site is wrong about this being discontinued because this is more fine work from Straight To Ale.","ThickNStout","Oct 10, 2014"

3.42,-12.8,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.25,3.5,"I’m amazed to be drinking an 11% abv beer from Alabama. While Vern’s Wheat Wine is a pretty good beer, it’s a huge step forward for a state that’s had its beer shelves flooded with mediocrity. It’s alright. Definitely worth a try…especially if you live in Alabama.","prototypic","0"
3.97,1.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"O- very nice beer would definitely drink ago. Easy drinking for 11% worth trying if you are able to find it. As it was only brewed once and running out. Grab one if you see it and try it.","nedvalton","Nov 09, 2012"

3.65,-6.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O: I liked this beer, but it didn't seem anything like the previous wheat-wine I just tried. This tasted like an Old Ale to me, and didn't have the light malt character or hop profile I'd expect from a wheat wine.","sommersb","Aug 21, 2012"

3.32,-15.3,3,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Overall: A solid attempt at a tough style, especially laudable due to the brewery's infancy. If the booziness could be contained just a bit more, it would be a phenomenal brew. I probably won't go out of my way to buy this again, but I by no means regret giving it a try.","brherren","Aug 16, 2012"
3.97,1.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"As to the other review, I hope the headache went away and that reviewer is feeling better. I quite enjoyed this wheat wine. It has an almost "spiciness" to it that is quite unique. To be honest at 11% this is quite smooth and drinkable for what most would think would be a sipping ale. The color is a cloudy reddish color and the mouthfeel has many components besides a bit of booziness which would be expected for something this high in abv. All in all a great rendition of this sparsely attempted style. Good job Straight To Ale.","jebwhitley","Beers"
3.14,-19.9,4,2.5,3.5,3,3,"O: Pretty average. I almost believe this beer may contain sulfites. After two sips I received the worst red wine like headache.","barleywinefiend","0"
