3.03,-18.8,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,"Reviewed blind as part of Blind BIF 7. Figured I'd bring this over to my Hallowe'en shindig, share some blind fun with others. This stuff pours a clear smoky topaz topped by a finger of relatively short-lived sienna foam. The nose comprises honey, light maple syrup, light clove, and a touch of rye bread. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a touch of wheat and a large amount of waxy orange rind. The bitterness of the latter really detracts from the overall experience for me (others in the room felt otherwise). The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally smooth feel. Overall, an alright wheatwine, but one that suffers from overly high bitterness. I do like the approach of a dunkel-wheatwine, though...","TMoney2591","0"

3.28,-12.1,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"O- Not gross. But....kind of a letdown. a bit disappointing due to price paid. NOT CHEAP. Sat on this since last spring. Surprised that I taste NO MAPLE. Booze seems higher than advertised ABV.","capeannbass36","Nov 30, 2011"

2.63,-29.5,4,3.5,2,2.5,2.5,"Overall this way just a huge miss for me. Maybe it is still too young and the sweetness and unbalanced flavor profile will further meld together, but I am skeptical. Not recommended and definitely not worth seeking out in my opinion.","claspada","Aug 05, 2011"
4.68,25.5,4.5,4,5,4.5,5,"Taste starts sweet, dark fruit in the middle, and then a maple sugar flavor at the close that is unlike any I've experienced in a brew. As if I melted a maple candy in my mouth with the mouthful of brew. Slight bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, and drinkability is sipping but definitely keeps you coming back for more. This brew surprised me, even better than hoped.","ppoitras","Aug 05, 2011"
4,7.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall pretty good, some booze esters, sweet, nice bitterness to sweet malt and syrup ratio, the hop flavor could have been a bit more dominant.","jlindros","Jun 26, 2011"
3.73,0,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"O - Overall I didn't think this beer is not that bad. That being said I'm not a fan of spending $16 for this. Still not the worst interval I've had. Would like to get another bottle to age and see what happens with the flavors.","rudzud","Jun 03, 2011"

2.76,-26,4,3,2.5,3,2.5,"O - I don't really care for the taste of this beer, and it is kind of hard to drink. Kind of a weird combination of maple, citrus, and hops. Not working for me, and don't care to have this again.","AgentZero","May 19, 2011"

4.23,13.4,4.5,4,4.25,4,4.5,"Overall- Definitely a sipper. I really dug this beer. Most maple syrup drinks/beers taste odd to me, but somehow the balance of the citrus hops really worked with the earthy maple and wheat sweetness. At nearly $20 a bottle, it isn't cheap, but if you can snag one of these and split it with someone it is definitely worth trying.","Auror","Apr 01, 2011"
3.2,-14.2,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"D - The alcohol isn't very well hidden for a beer that is only 9.2%, and this drinks quite heavy - I actually thought it was stronger. While the flavor and aroma are largely what is described by the label, the components seem to clash, and the bitter finish is just plain unpleasant. I didn't really want more than a few ounces of this one. I'd perhaps try it again to see if the alcohol and hop flavors dissipate, but I didn't really enjoy the other flavors enough to think that it might turn into a great (or even good) beer.","MasterSki","Beers"
4.37,17.2,4.5,5,4,4,4.5,"Overall, a well put together beer. One that is good now, and probably will become even better with a year or two in the cellar.","connecticutpoet","0"
