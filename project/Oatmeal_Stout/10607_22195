Aroma is a sweet chocolate and coffee mix with some smokey roasted malts. The taste has more of the sweet oatmeal than in the aroma. Light and sweet coffee as well as chocolate. A bit of smoke towards the finish. Silky, creamy mouthfeel thanks to the nitro. Damn drinkable. This beer really shines on the nitro tap. Overall, worth seeking out.","PicoPapa","Jan 08, 2013"

The head has good retention, and it leaves behind some scattered lace on the glass. The nose is of dark roasted malt, chocolate, toffee, light hops, and cream. It smells really nice. The taste follows the nose pretty well. There is a nice roasted malt flavor and bitterness. There are some flavors of coffee, dark chocolate, toffee, and mild hop flavors. The finish leaves some lingering roasted malt and hop bitterness on the palate. This has a medium body, that is leaning toward full, and good carbonation. It goes down smooth, and it has a really creamy feel to it. There is some sweetness and a nice roasted malt bitterness that balances it out. The roasted bitterness lingerings on the tongue for a bit. This has good drinkability. It has really nice flavor and great feel to it. It is quite creamy. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer, and I would buy it again.

I really thought this was a great, albeit aggressive, take on the style. The flavor and aroma are full of big chocolate flavors up front with roasted barley around the edge. The malts are followed by a powerful citrus hops kick that provides a great bitter contrast to the cocoa notes. This is easily one of the best oatmeal stouts I've ever had.","tempest","Jan 15, 2010"

3.92,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,"D--What's the ABV, like six percent? Hell yeah I'll have another! The smoothness of the mouthfeel and the dry back end of this brew make it easily sessionable, especially in December about-to-snow temperatures.","TheycallmeTim","Dec 31, 2007"
3.95,4.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall, this was not an overly complex take on the style. However, it was a solid take IMO. I would recommend it, but not above a few other brews in the category.","Nickls","Apr 26, 2007"
3.53,-6.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a murky brown. Tan head. Oddest color I've seen in a long time for a beer. Nose is sweet malts. Flavor is kind of funky. Earthy and slightly metallic edge. Malty flavors and a pretty thick aftertaste. Feel is decent. Thick on the liquid and a good enough level of carbonation. I am going to drop the drinkability though on this one. Sure it's pretty good, but the funk edge on this one is almost too far out. Not my favorite from Sixpoint.","RblWthACoz","Apr 24, 2007"
3.28,-13,4,3.5,2.5,4,4,"Looked good  near black with about an inch of tan head courtesy of the nitro tap at the Blind Tiger, which left nice rings retained well by the pint glass. Smelled good like a good stout should  roasted chocolate malts swirled with toffee; the oats were present if didnt come through as much as I like. But on the tongue, the diacytl that produced that pleasant toffee aroma was overwhelming. I wished Id ordered a second Chelsea Dry Irish Stout. I didnt taste a whole lot here because of the overwhelming buttery flavors, but theres some molasses and roast coffee going on. It was smooth and creamy, despite. Id try it again just to make sure that I didnt just get a bad batch, but I was disappointed with this one.","jbsteiny","Mar 25, 2007"
3.78,0.3,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Notes: the bartender at BTAH didn't know whether this was a porter or a stout (though she did pour it like you would pour a nitro-tap Guinness, so at some level she must've thought it was a stout or had been trained to pour it thusly). I didn't think it was strong enough to be a porter, so I was guessing at the time that it was an Irish Dry Stout. Knowing now that it was an Oatmeal Stout makes sense, but I usually find that Oatmeal Stouts are a little more creamy. Still, this was not bad at all, and I'd like to try it again knowing now what it is I'd be drinking. . . .","Kendo","Mar 24, 2007"

4.2,11.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured an opaque black color with a large cascading head. Great retention and lacing. Nose was heavy on coffee and roasted barley. Taste hits you with a sweet sugared coffee and toasty barley flavor. Also to be found is light caramel, powdered chocolate, and mild hops. Nice mouthfeel and very drinkable. Tasty!","lehows","Dec 30, 2006"
3.53,-6.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice creamy tan head which lasts a little while then leaves some nice islands and some sticky lacing. the nose is slightly malty with some caramel undertones. The taste is malty and bitter with a slightly dry finish. Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad oatmeal stout, glad to have had a chance to try it out.","Wasatch","Mar 20, 2005"
3.68,-2.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"The taste was mostly dominated by hop character, with the oatmeal roasty/sugary flavor playing second fiddle. To be honest, the hops dominated the flavor a bit too much for my liking. Notes of coffee and chocolate are present, but barely. Mouthfeel is full and creamy, and the beer is quite drinkable. Overall the beer is a quality brew from a quality brewhouse, but it doesn't keep within the style very well. I would have liked to see more oatmeal charcater in the flavor. Still, it's worth a try.","BBM","Mar 18, 2005"
3.76,-0.3,4,3,4,3,4.5,"On tap at the Blind Tiger 3/19/05. Dark chocolate brown that you cannot see through at all, with a touch of a dusting and ring of thick, heavy khaki head. Not much coming from the aroma -not very strong, just a bit of coffee, some semi-sweet chocolate, and a tiny bit of hops. Smooth and silky, it flows nice and you really do not feel the carbonation-which I enjoy. A lot of dark coffee and sweet chocolate in the flavor, and a lot of flavor left to linger on the palate. Very nice and very drinkable.","shapudding","Beers"
3.73,-1.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"I enjoyed a pint of this tasty brew at the Blind Tiger Ale House. Pours black without any light shining through. Dark tan head, puffy with good retention. Leaves well developed lacing. This one sports a roasty malt nose. Notes of coffee and toasted grains. Mouthfeel is a bit hollow in the center, not quite the velvet the brewers were going for. Still a nice take on the style, subtle and balanced, worth a try to support this new Brooklyn NY, brewery.","Billolick","0"
