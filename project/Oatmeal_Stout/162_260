4.56,9.6,3.75,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,"Pours rich and thick like a stout should. Very dark appearance with less than expected head. Rich, smooth taste with just the right carbonation. An extremely delicious stout!","NHJimD","Feb 28, 2015"
4.23,1.7,4.25,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"The flavor is a bit subdued but smooth and delicious. There's a ribbon of sweetness that tastes like marshmallow cream, caramel and toffee. The stout like characteristics then shine through with roast, char, chocolate malt and Graham cracker. All the while I tastes tinges of molasses and dark fruit. Supposedly this was just $5 for a bomber, it was given to me. If that's the case this may be the best deal in craft beer.","KYGunner","Feb 25, 2015"

4.38,5.3,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,"Toasted marshmallow on the nose, coffee and cocoa on the palate, this beer delivers.  Pours thick, rick, and midnight black.  The alcohol is balanced nicely with the full flavor and sweet malts, with just a twinge if bitterness reminding you to keep drinking.  Smooth and wet, this one makes a great case for the oatmeal stouts.","Foxybrau","Feb 01, 2015"
