4.1,2.2,4,4,4.25,4,4,"Head dissipates immediately- color has a hint of ruby, like a chocolate cherry Dr. Pepper. I wish the smell had more oatmeal but the taste is very balanced. Not too malty, not too chocolatey, and the aftertaste is very pleasant. Chocolate and coffee linger for a while.","ElJacobian","Thursday at 08:11 PM"

4.06,1.2,3.75,4,4.25,3.75,4,"Dark brown with ruby edges. Some roast on the nose.  Decent roast in the flavor profile is accompanied by a touch of chocolate.  The finish is dry and bitter.  The body is spot on but it's more fizzy than I might have expected.","57md","Mar 22, 2015"

3.78,-5.7,4.25,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"The beer hits of cocoa, light roasted malt, powdery chocolate and a creamy/almost lactose flavor. A good amount of flavor throughout of creamy chocolate and coffee, but in general a medium beer for the style.","dar482","Mar 21, 2015"
