Under the sour notes I can smell the peanuts so I can see where it would have potential in a healthy batch. First time I had it was in their first release of six pack bottles when they were still using the gold caps instead of the white with black logo on it. All of that run of uber gubber and pbj were infected and recalled. Maybe I was so affected by that batch I can taste any amount of misplaced bacteria in every newer batch.","BlissJunkie","Jan 04, 2013"

3.42,-5.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,"O: I'm a bit torn on this beer. On one hand the nose is quite strong and meets the advertised tones of the beer. On the other hand, the flavor profile indicates something is not quite right. Hard to tell if this is a yeast issue, sanitation issue, oil issue or simply my palate on the intended beer. After I've had half the glass, the tartness has become less evident allowing the peanuts and malts to resurface again. Would I drink again? Yes. Would I prefer on tap? Yes - as I've had less issues with novelty beers deviating from their former selves associated with bottle conditions and dating issues. Worth a peak as a beer.","harrymel","Sep 06, 2011"
2.87,-20.7,4,4.5,2,3.5,2,"O - Wasn't going for a lactic tart stout. Beer has a lot of potential with a very nice roasted peanut. Unfortunately like way too many Shorts beers, this one was horribly infected. They really need to get that under control.","AgentZero","Aug 23, 2011"

3.13,-13.5,3.5,3,3,4,3,"OVERALL: I appreciate the attempt and the willingness to experiment, but this was not my thing. Peanut butter tasted somewhat synthetic and out of place in the beer, while it also masked any other attempt at creating complexity. This is a bit of a novelty that I can see people trying once, but I just can’t imagine drinking this on a regular basis. It was interesting, but it’s a one-and-done for me. Thanks again TheSevenDuffs.","Jeffo","Jul 11, 2011"
1.89,-47.8,4,2.5,1,2.5,2,"12 oz. bottle. Pours a medium black with a quickly dissipating tan head. Aroma is coffee, light peanuts and...dammit, there it is again. The sour smell that means for the second year in a row I’ve fallen prey to infected Goober. Taste, lightly roasty with subtle peanut butter and yep, a foul, sour finish. Mouthfeel is unpleasantly slick and lacking in body. God, when will I frickin’ learn with Shorts’ oddball releases?","sleestak4life","Jul 06, 2011"
3.65,0.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Overall – Very interesting beer. Some of Short’s beers don’t work…I think this one does. While I wouldn’t grab a six pack of it in the future, it actually was better than I was expecting and as stated was a great way to cap the night after having such a sweet fruit beer.

4.07,12.4,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall, well, it works. Interesting mix of flavors. Nothing aggressive or offensive. Couldn't see sitting down and drinking a number of these, but one a sitting is good. Seek it out for nothing more than the novelty works.","JamnesCameron","May 16, 2011"
3.3,-8.8,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Massive thanks goes out to beeruser for sharing this one with funkydelic and I at an impromptu tasting! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller sampler wine glass. Poured a deep dark brown with a minimal off-white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted peanuts, salty, and slight fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, nutty, and subtle saltiness. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. Nothing too awe-inspring going on in this one at all. It honestly reminded me of eating roasted peanuts on both the aroma and the flavor. More so in the aroma though, as it wasn't as salty in the flavor fortunately. Glad I got to try this one, but doubt I would have it again.","thagr81us","Beers"

3.67,1.4,3.5,4,4,2,3.5,"Pours very black with dark red highlights when held up to the light. There is no head but there is an oily film on the top of the beer. Very little lacing that drops down into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smells of dark roasted malts, oatmeal, and peanut butter. Very rich taste of dark malt, roasted oats, and roasted peanuts. Definitely lives up to its name in the taste category. I don't think I have ever seen another beer that is brewed with peanuts. The mouthfeel is what kills this one for me. No carbonation and very watery on the palate. There is also a weird acidity that lingers on the tongue after each sip. Overall, this is another good and interesting beer from Short's that I am glad I got to try. I love peanuts so this was something neat to see. I just wish the mouthfeel was a bit better.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 19, 2011"
3.25,-10.2,3,3,3.5,3.5,3,"O ~ an experiment worth a try.. possibly blend this with a strawberry lambic or framboise? I know Short's does a PB&J, which is also interesting. The last one I had held a bit of a soury funk to it...so not sure it was 100% all together..","vande","Apr 19, 2011"
3.8,5,4,4,3.5,4,4,"(12oz bottle from rayl101!). Pours near black/dark brown with thin khaki head. Aroma has lots of peanut, peanut shell along with some dark chocolate/cocoa nibs. Smells very rich. Taste is roasty bitter, but the sweet, slightly tangy malts quickly cancel out the roast. Medium bodied with a creamy texture. The finish is dry, but not overly done. This is a well-balanced beer with several things working together pretty nicely. I think they did a good job here.","trappistlover","Apr 14, 2011"

4.15,14.6,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours jet black with a small light tan head. In the aroma, dry peanut butter and sweet oatmeal roast. In the taste, a roasted malt and a sweet oatmeal to a dry nuttiness.

3.08,-14.9,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Pours an espresso black with a dark khaki fingers worth of head. Nose of a slight acridness and metallic quality. Touch of stale coffee roasted stale peanuts as well as some jammy artificial fruit. Taste is a sour fruit, more stale coffee and lingering cigarette smoke on the taste. Also pick up some roasted peanut when searching for it. Easy drinking and well carbonated for the style. Didnt do this much of a favor after just finishing my first breakfast stout, no where even close in quality.","Trilogy31","Apr 05, 2011"
3.38,-6.6,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"O: It wasn't hard to split this bottle between my girlfriend, and she definitely liked it more than I did. It isn't too bad of a beer, but just not really my thing.

3.07,-15.2,3,3.5,3,2.5,3,"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style, with moderate carbonation. Overall it was a very interesting beer. It really did taste like a roasty bag of peanuts. I got a lot of the salty, earthy, peanut shell flavors to it and not nearly as much of the peanut butter flavor I expected. It was interesting and a cool beer to try but I couldn't drink that much of it. In my opinion, a little more stout flavors coming through would have gone a long way. It also felt a bit salty overall. Very cool beer overall, and they did a pretty good job at getting some real peanut flavor to come through. I just don't think it was for me.","billab914","Mar 27, 2011"
3.95,9.1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"O:Another interesting beer from Shorts, a lot of nutty flavor dominates this drink with some underlying sweetness. A overall easy drink that is one worth trying.","SuperNova777","Mar 23, 2011"

2.45,-32.3,3.5,3.5,2,2,2,"Something went amiss here...it could be a problem with my storage or possibly a bad batch from the brewery.

3.65,0.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,3,"D: This one really got the aroma down, but like a few other Short's beers, I feel that the taste is a letdown in comparison. Having this next to the PB&J, I felt this was the worse of the two. However, when I blended the two beers (2 parts Uber Goober to 1 part PB&J), it better captured the peanut flavor that PB&J was lacking.","Arbitrator","Mar 17, 2011"

2.9,-19.9,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Pours black with an initial faint tan head which fades rapidly to nothing. No lace on glass. The nose is not surprizingly nutty for a beer made with peanuts. Power of suggestion says = peanuts in here. Tastes band-aidishly plastic with a "brown" earthy dirt-like finish. Kind of like the peanuts weren't wasted or something. Mouthfeel is bland. In all fairness I do note some possible interference from previous glasses. Overall, this is unique, but would not seek after it.","wethorseblanket","Mar 01, 2011"

It's not as bad as most of the reviews make it out to be, you can definitely tell that it was made with peanuts.

I don't care what anyone says about oats only being for body, I can taste oats, there is some taste familiar in every oatmeal stout, including this one.

4.36,20.4,3.5,5,4,3.5,5,"Poured black with caramel-colored edges, but almost no head at all, and only a few minor scraps of lacing. Smell is definitely dominated by peanut butter, with a faint note of roasted grains and some malty sweetness supporting it. It's a very enjoyable scent. Mouthfeel is sort of appropriately buttery and chewy, and the oily body feels full in the mouth, but vanishes a little disappointingly quickly on swallowing, causing you to realize it's thinner than it first tasted. The peanut flavors are very present in the overall coating left in the mouth, but they come into the flavor profile late, offering rich, velvety tone instead of bombastic sweetness, which actually impresses me, as I don't necessarily expect that kind of restraint in a Short's. On the downside, it's a trifle watery, and there isn't a whole lot more to the flavor profile beyond some mild, basic stout characteristics: e.g. some chocolate notes, a charred quality, and a very mild, malty-seeming bitterness in the aftertaste that could be a subdued hop bite. Drinkability is exceptionally high, and like most people, I love peanut butter as a flavor, so it's really easy to enjoy this one. It's not quite complex or bold enough to be a full-blown A, but it's probably the most pleasantly drinkable Short's beer I've yet to try. I'd give it a B+ on my own, but the BA calculator tallies it out as an A-.","bfflo","Dec 10, 2010"

The smell is very much a roasted smell of coffee, peanuts, and some chocolate. The taste is of peanuts, a little bit of chocolate, caramel, some hops, and the ending taste is of coffee. It has a little bit of bitter in the taste, but mostly has a sweeter taste to it that is well balanced. The mouthfeel is a smooth creamy taste that has a nice medium to full body to this beer.

It did have the peanut butter and choclate notes but I don't think the tart sourness is intentional. There was also a little booze and coffee notes as well. The brew was medium in body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a sweet, tart, and boozy finish. It did not drink that good due to the sour character on this oatmeal stout.

The nose is exactly what the bottle has promised, an oatmeal stout with peanuts. The peanut aroma isn't overpowering, but it is pleasantly noticeable in the background. Unfortunately the peanuts don't have the same effect in the taste. The flavor of the roasted oats are overpowered by the salty, oily quality of the peanuts.

A dense, mocha head appeared during the pour and refused to go away, even after the glass was empty. Chunky lacing, almost streaky, covered the glass. Nice aroma. You can smell the peanuts for sure, pleasant roast, earthy and sweet with a bit of fruit, faint licorice and cherry. Now this is a sweet stout! Lots of lactose and malt, roast, chocolate, nuts, raisins, and a bit of berry sourness in the finish. Bitterness was present throughout, but was fairly restrained. The peanuts are there, but aren't overpowering. Medium bodied with average carbonation, pretty smooth and silky. For such a sweet beer, this didn't feel unbalanced at all. Just enough bitterness and a fruity tartness kept it all in check. Good stuff.","DrJay","Jan 15, 2010"
3.61,-0.3,3,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,"(D)- Certainly an interesting idea for a stout. Most of it works well together, however, it does get a little disjointed. Sometimes it doesnt quite know what to taste like.

If I had tasted this blind, I would have suggested it was a medium-bodied farm-house ale with a snappy finish. This is tasty and fun; Unexpected but delicious. Very well-developed Belgian lace forms and stays put. The stout lingers with definite peanut, oatmeal and chocolate notes. Excellent at cellar temperature.

3.63,0.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"D: This is actually pretty relaxing and drinkable. The recipe could use a bit of tweaking, but who else would even think to make a peanut-based Oatmeal Stout? If it was just a touch sweeter I'd like it more, I think.","danielharper","Dec 24, 2009"
2.77,-23.5,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,2,"It's funny, these limited edition Short's releases are going to get at least B+'s across the board, but so far are unimpressive.","Telix","Dec 24, 2009"
4.37,20.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"D: A must have for any fan of both peanuts and stouts. A one of a kind brew that is both tasty and well produced. Worth seeking out.","Avagadro","Dec 24, 2009"
3.65,0.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - I prefer Mystery and Cup A Joe to this one....not bad.","Sean9689","Dec 23, 2009"
3.52,-2.8,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Very interesting beer in that Short's really did incorporate a peanut butter flavor and aroma, but the booziness and charred malt flavors keep it from being outstanding for me.","WeisGuy","Dec 22, 2009"
4.16,14.9,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Overall, an interesting beer because of the peanut flavor.","webmanspidey","Dec 21, 2009"
3.97,9.7,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,"D: With the smooth mouthfeel this one goes down easy. Not really much alcohol for an 'Imperial Oatmeal Stout' as the bottle claims, but what alcohol there is, is well well hidden.","spartanfan","Dec 20, 2009"
4.27,18,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Short's really did a nice job with Uber Goober, it comes across as advertised. I have been very impressed with all three of the special stouts that Short's has just brought out: Mystery, Cup a Joe and this one.","kegger22","Dec 17, 2009"

4.2,16,4,4,4.5,4,4,"drinkability is good. pretty well balanced, with just a little alcohol warmth showing through. i like the extra depth from the peanut and chocolate characters. good stuff!","grub","Apr 12, 2009"
4.27,18,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, goes down pretty smooth. Even though sweet it isn't overly sweet. Thanks a ton Derek!","Viggo","Jan 30, 2009"
4.3,18.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D-Quite nice and certainly unique. Would have liked more of a fresh peanut quality but the dry roasted flavour works better with the malts. A very interesting and well done brew.","Deuane","Dec 21, 2007"
4.35,20.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured a dark black color with an averaged sized off white head. Aromas of roast, some lighter oatiness, nutty, chocolate, and smokey. Peanuts. Tastes of roast, chocolate, oats, and nutty. I like the way the peanuts were done and presented 'themselves' in this beer.","hopdog","Beers"
4.52,24.9,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"This is a one of a kind original. I would encourage anyone to give this beer a try -- it's definitely worth it!","Sudmissle","0"
