I would like to have pulled a few more aroma and flavor notes out here. It is one step up from a Guinness extra stout for me but no more. Will not venture to this again.","Albianfire","Tuesday at 08:33 PM"

Overall I would describe the taste as good but nondescript.  I would not drink it just to drink a beer--I'd reach for the organic chocolate or imperial stout.

Today I chose to give the old Oatmeal Stout a proper review. The beer pours with a giant, frothy cappuccino colored head, a full 2 fingers over the top of the glass. Picturesque! Like a root beer float. The awesome staying power of the head lingers over a deep black liquid with slight transparency and cherry accents. A distinct but mellow browned butter aroma greets the nose. Along with hints of raisin, smoke and minerals. The flavor is of mildly sweet butterscotch with subtle sour bitterness. Lime-like spiciness meets a roasted character with an herbal tobacco taste in the finish. It's a nice marriage of flavors, but the bitterness, though not excessive, still manages to overpower the malts a little. The brew is medium-bodied with adequate carbonation. Unremarkable, but suitable for the style I suppose. Overall, this is a staple for a reason. There's quite a bit of character packed in to this tame ABV offering from the English legend. If you've never tried it, it's a must have on any beer-tasting checklist.","JohnnyI","Feb 02, 2015"

Upon first taste, nothing other is oatmeal is present, but quickly the dark and roasted malts assert themselves. Sweet milk chocolate shows up towards then end to round out the flavor profile. Nice touch. Feels smooth, carbonated and very, very drinkable. Definitely lighter than I expected with almost zero bite. Overall, this oatmeal stout is much simpler than other American stouts (lower ABV, no syrupy qualities, or caramel notes), and therefore, can be critiqued for being a bit two-dimensional, but maybe I'm biased. Nevertheless, this is an oatmeal stout for anyone interested in getting into stouts. Worth every penny.","Jonoesh5","Jan 18, 2015"

An earthy, roasted malt, bread and hint of burnt sugar. Taste is grainy, malty sweet, creamy, with a slight hops finish. Taste gets even better as the drink warms. I drank it without food, but would love to try again with chocolate. Feel is robust and full bodied; a meal in and of itself. Active carbonation that settles as the drink warms.

That said, it's probably the weakest of the Sam Smiths stout lineup (the Imperial is my favourite) but then it's up against some pretty stiff competition. Best enjoyed at your leisure - this really is too good to just chuck down your neck with wild abandon.","interzen","Nov 29, 2014"

Fat mousse like head of mocha colored foam that lasts, falls to a ring and leaves lace.  Nose is deep with roasted malt scents.  There's a sweet lush caramel , a bit of weak coffee, bitter chocolate and some scent from oats in the background as well.  This beer has an earthy woody scent too that is hard to pin down. Taste is luscious. Smooth, creamy and full.  The sweet caramel is first to grace the palate and then a big roasty taste follows. It has a bit of bitterness to it and it dries on the tongue leaving the coffee a bit stronger than on the nose and the bitter chocolate to come to finish.  At the last moments there is that woody and earthy taste again with that sweet and very soft caramel to linger alongside all those big roasty flavors of bitter malt.  I detected no hops on the  nose and I can find none on the palate save for that bit of woodiness and to say this beer is well balanced and a delight to the disposition if you ask me.  I like it precisely because it's not too sweet although it has an ample sweetness. Finishes with a bit of bite from carbonation.","utopiajane","Nov 16, 2014"

Subtle nose of dark fruit (plum, raisin) with light notes of roast and chocolate as it warms.  Light bodied with little texture.  Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish.  The flavor profile is laid back.  It consists of a blend of light roast and chocolate with a distinct mineral note. If you look for it, you can find the oat character. The finish has a slight metallic twang to it.  I suspect this bottle may be old, since what I'm tasting is nothing like the other reviews here.  If you don't bother to bottle date, then the reviewer can't take age into consideration.","tillmac62","Oct 29, 2014"

Love the smell after you take a sip of it near your nose it leaves you wanting more of it. The malt flavors are not over powering and coats your mouth with a sticky film that makes me love this stout so much. I would definitely recommend this stout to anybody who would love trying a stout for the first time.","Lager_stout_87","Oct 01, 2014"

I do wish I could find it on tap more though. All of Samuel Smith's dark beers are impressive and I suggest everyone try them at least once. One of the best things about this beer is the mouthfeel, the oatmeal really gives it that silky texture that I love in my dark beers. This is also one of the first beers I had when I was getting in to craft beer, back when I wasn't really into IPAs.","PaulyB83","Jul 23, 2014"

Both are solid offerings if a little light. However, SS do make some of the smoothest beers I've had. I prefer this over the porter, but ill stick with the imperial stout over both of these for now.

4.44,5.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured a rich, deep opaque black, with dark brown highlights around the edges when held to light and three fingers of thick tan head that receded slowly and left abundant lacing down the glass. An excellent stout appearance, exactly what you look for in the style. Scents of soy sauce, roast malt, notes of dark chocolate, hard Yorkshire water and Samuel Smith's yeast. As it sits chocolate aromas become more prominent, alongside some faint hints of coffee and roast malt. There is also a low level of floral hop aromas. A very good, balanced, wonderfully presented oatmeal stout aroma. Flavor begins with a semi-sweet flavor profile reminiscent of dark chocolate with roasted malt undertones and notes of coffee with cream. Moves into a more bitter flavor, though still with an underlying slight sweetness and a greater flavor of roast malt. Finishes semi-dry with a roast malt presence and notes of coffee with cream. Aftertaste is roasted malt bitterness and hint of nuttiness from the oats. There are slight earthy notes throughout, mingling with the roasted malt flavors. A very nice overall flavor profile that is complex and deep, yet approachable and rustic. Very true to style. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with medium carbonation and a smooth, creamy, slick feel. Very true to form for the style and quite the wonderful beer to drink as a result. Overall this is an excellent, classic example of an oatmeal stout. It hits the style perfectly from aroma, to flavor, to mouthfeel and is simply a joy to drink. A wonderful beer.","Auraan","Jun 12, 2014"

Probably not, since the store I buy it from sells it for $3.50 a bottle and I can get a better tasting oatmeal stout with more abv at the same price.","Lordhelmit","May 19, 2014"

3.91,-7.1,3.5,3.75,4,4,4,"Enjoyed from 550 ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. A dark coffee brown brew with reddish tinting and a decent-sized brown head. Aroma is rich and malt-forward, with cocoa powder, fruity yeast like apples and pears, medium-roast coffee, and a faint caramel sweetness putting in appearances. A well-rounded, sophisticated, and multifaceted brew as one would expect from such a classic, featuring chocolate milk, almond, caramel, vanilla, and coffee flavors, with the caramel gaining traction later as the dark malts lose some steam. Sourish and tangy from acidic dark malts and fruity yeast esters, yet smooth and creamy. The body is lighter than expected. Finishes long, smooth, and earthy, with a little butterscotch and a cereal grain type of sweetness. I get little in the way of harsh burnt or charred notes. Depending on the source one consults, oats either fail to add much flavor while contributing body, or they do add an astringent flavor note ... I certainly get the latter here although the source is difficult to pinpoint. In my mind (and to my palate), this is considered the prototype of the style for a reason. Less sweet than a milk stout but has some of the same desirable mouthfeel characteristics.","CalgaryFMC","Mar 02, 2014"

I won't say it's a bad beer, but why it gets such high ratings on here, I cannot understand why. It has high carbonation which is ok, but it lacks kick or punch that good oatmeal stouts have. The head was not very dark, so it just seemed weird to have such a dark beer with a light head. Some people might enjoy this beer and I think those that do do not like strong tasting beers. If you are looking for a step up from a Guinness beer this might be for you, but if you like strong intense beers, which I expect from an Oatmeal stout, this beer isn't for you.","Dave2010","Dec 17, 2013"

Roasted and toasted malts with bready cereal flavors up front. Hop bitterness slowly emerges through the middle and expands to the end converting the malt notes to dark ripe fruit flavors.

Taste same as aroma. Palate is a rich creamy body with light carbonation. The finish is sweet mildly roasted caramel and chocolate malts, some dark fruity flavors with light bitterness on the end for balance. A very good, tasty and nicely balanced brew.

I bought it in a 1 pt, 2.7 fluid oz bottle and wish I had gotten at least 2 of them. Wonderful taste and mouthfeel. I was sad to see the last sip in the glass. Gonna go pick up a couple of the four-packs tomorrow. Would definitely recommend to anyone who likes or even slightly enjoys a good stout.","beervionics","Jul 14, 2013"

Not like Kona Brewery's attempt at "coffee beer", but good coffee- and without even trying. If you have ever drank malta or any other high-quality, non-alcoholic malt beverage, you probably know what I'm talking about. This beer is dark, smooth, and just unforgettable. The head has more staying power than Guinness Extra Stout, and the head alone is more flavorful than the body of most beers. This stuff is expensive and hard to find, but totally worth it.","schnauzeborne","Jul 08, 2013"

There's a lot of people claiming tons of smokiness in this and I really don't get it. Mild chocolate and toasted oats. I would like to taste more oats to be honest. Body is smooth and silky.

The aroma is sublime... cereal grains are intermingled with sweet chocolate and some light fruit esters (green apple & pear). Fortunately, the flavor is just as fantastic. Along with the aforementioned aspects, we also get some molasses, raisin and a trace of crisp bitter hops. The finish is quite earthy & roasty, with a light mouth feel. Thoroughly enjoyable and complex.","Neorebel","Apr 29, 2013"

Love the look. Smell: Licorice, bitter chocolate, sough dough bread. Classic stout flavor.. well balanced, malty, rich and goes down smooth. Mouthfeel: Dry, medium to heavy texture.

Pours crystal clear almost opaque dark brown color with a nice 2 finger dense and fluffy light tan head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, cocoa, molasses, oatmeal, dark bread, toast, light apple, floral, and earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt notes with some light fruitiness. Taste of caramel, molasses, cocoa, oatmeal, toast, roasted malt, dark bread, floral, and roasted earthiness. Light floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, molasses, oatmeal, cocoa, toast, roasted malt, dark bread, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark malt notes with moderate hops; with great flavor robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent oatmeal stout. Very nice balance and complexity of dark malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 14, 2013"

The taste is sweet, with slight bitterness, where you can tell the oatmeal and the expected caramel/coffee. The full, silky body also has high drinkability, with a very comforting, malty, bready, aftertaste. Absolutely excellent for a session drinking with your best friends.","HabiMendes","Feb 05, 2013"

I get intensely sweet caramel, honey and a splash of espresso on the nose. But the flavor is watery on the start and the finish. The little hops character which is there is well balanced against the unique sweetness the oats add. So I do get why it is a widely enjoyed stout, but I prefer something more flavorful. It is good, just not my favorite.","Kevin73","Jan 22, 2013"

Nothing maroon or reddish tones. AROMA: It has very defined or intense odors. TASTE: Very smooth and creamy, a little sweet, no conflict and, therefore, quite bland. After a few minutes, it leaves a sour taste that is not unpleasant. Despite being an oatmeal stout, I notice no difference with respect to that. Overall rating: Not as good as they say. I thought a beer right, but nothing more. Perfect for those who do not want the ales or protruding tastes or smells of that love or hate.

Head retention is just alright, and lacing, while left in a solid ring near the top of the glass, is fairly spotty underneath. The nose is highlighted by a soft coffee aroma, met by a light touch of fruity esters. The flavor adds a mild chocolate flavor, which plays well against the subtle, coffee with cream roast. Those classic English esters help close things out. The body is wonderful, subtly full and featuring that great silky character that one finds in a well executed oatmeal stout. The carbonation is on the low end of the spectrum, just as it should be. There's nothing overly complex or "in your face" about Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout, it's just a flawless rendition of one of my favorite styles.","axeman9182","Dec 14, 2012"

A large, fluffy, dark caramel-colored head forms quickly and retains a little better than average. Once it dissipates, splotchy and spiderweb lacing is left on the edges of the glass, while a thin cap sits atop the beer. Aromas are comprised primarily of sweet chocolate and sorghum. While these aromas come through distinctly, they are not overly bold. There are also notes of roasted malt and ripe cherry. Mouthfeel is smooth, and not too viscous. The mild hop on the finish accentuates the light carbonation scrubbing. Flavors come through almost as distinctly as the aromas. However, everything is mild. In a time of craft brewers competing for the biggest beer, it's nice to sip a stout that has a lot of flavor in different varieties without having my palate overwhelmed. Mild chocolate, sorghum, and ripe fruit esters occur, essentially in that order. I regard this a quintessential stout.","DocJitsu","Oct 25, 2012"

4.28,1.7,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"A cascading dark tan head eventually settles majestic atop this dark brown brew. A slow disintegration results in a landscape of rocky lace. Big nutty and sweet aromas overlay dark chocolates, sweet bread and a hint of plum. Tastes nutty with a little less molasses sweetness involved. A vein of dark licorice coincides with a quick punch of cocoa toward the end. Weighs unexpectedly light to medium, and one could argue there's a wateriness, although the argument would be short lived as inconsequential. This is not an overly complex beer, but it is a well balanced and eminently rewarding beer that shows revisitation of basic (sometimes forgotten beers) can be just as rewarding, if not more so, than tasting the newest of trends or extremes.","stephens101","Oct 18, 2012"

Smell is a sweet cocoa and expresso. Taste is really sweet which i didn't care too much for. Reminds me Hershey syrup. I also get a bit of vanilla, expresso, and just a touch of nuttiness and fruit (cherries?) which I noticed when I had Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale. Mouth feel is quite smooth, but the carbonation and sugar leave my mouth feeling like I had a soda. Overall I can't say I'm big on it.","theHoff77","Oct 02, 2012"

At first the raisin stood out, but as the beer warms I get more of the roasted flavor. Body is med-thick with gentle carbonation. I haven't had many oatmeal stouts, but I rather enjoy this one.

At only 5% abv. this could be your shot at a sessionable stout, so long as you don't fill up and can afford it. A sort of original in the brewing world as well, so it is hard to say anything bad about it at all. A great beer, looking forward to my second bottle.","Siriusfisherman","Dec 21, 2011"

2.55,-39.4,4.5,2,2.5,3,2.5,"Overall I was unimpressed with this beer and I thought it was a bellow average Oatmeal Stout. What really hurt this beer was the fact that it kept that same super sweet malt profile that the other two beers had and just as it did in those beers it overpowers the flavors that define the style, in this case it overpowered the nice roasty and chocolate flavors that should be shining through. This one is a little easier to drink than the other two but it still doesn't have good drinkability, I wouldn't want more then one glass of this, the malt profile is a turn off and it doesn't hold my attention. What I liked most about this beer was the look, it looked pretty spot on for an Oatmeal Stout and it had very good head retention. What I liked least about this beer was the nasty overly sweet malt profile that all the beers in the holiday pack had, it overpowered the nice flavors that should be the highlight of this beer, it made for a pretty disappointing aroma and taste. I won't be buying this beer again or their Holiday pack, all the beers had the same bad malt profile. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who likes oatmeal stouts, it is pretty easy to find one that it much better then this beer. This beer was a let down and doesn't compare to the American Oatmeal Stouts I have tried, they are on an entirely different level. I was pretty let down with this beer and their holiday pack, after looking at the ratings I figured these would all be solid beers, but they weren't so either I hate the malt profile that they use in their beers, or I got some of last years holiday pack but with no dating I can't be sure and I hold that against them. The best thing from this holiday pack was the glass. This is the worst Oatmeal Stout I have had to date and so far I am not a fan of this brewery, I will be very reluctant to buy another beer from them, so far one of my least favorite brewerys.","StoutHunter","Dec 07, 2011"

It's a lovely mix of coffee, malts, oats and nuttiness. It's a creamy, heavy stout with just enough carbonation. It tastes fairly malty with huge notes of coffee and chocolate and a little sweet, oat background with a smooth, fairly bitter finish. Overall this is one of my favorite beers and as a result have tried several other SS brews, all of which have been great as well.","brandon911","Nov 21, 2011"

Random thin lacing. The smell is awesome. It's sweet, and smells of oats and chocolate. This beer tastes sweet to start with. After that, you can detect dark chocolate, oats, and raisins. It's got a complexity about it that I admire. The mouthfeel is very, very smooth. Overall, this is a great stout. It's actually very complex in it's flavor, it is easily drinkable, and it's 5% ABV is great for a session. An excellent choice from the UK.","JuicesFlowing","Nov 12, 2011"

Notes of oatmeal, cream, chocolate, some malt, in the aroma. Mouthfeel is top notch. Silky smooth, rich, surprisingly drinkable for such a full beer. Flavor is yeasty, chocolate, oatmeal, cream, vanilla, and a bit of hearty smoked meat. Finishes very smooth, with the mildest of hop bitterness. Really a superb beer, certainly my favorite sweet stout, and the best Sam Smith.","tylerss20","Nov 09, 2011"

I had the barkeep warm this a bit before serving it to me so I'm sure that helped immensely. Aromas of oats, roasted malt, a slight of coffee (?) and some sweetness. Taste was great: roasted malt, oats (like oatmeal that I could chew), a slight bit of coffee, some chocolate, and no hop bitterness to finish.

3.9,-7.4,4,4,4,3,4,"My pour created two foamy fingers of deep-tan head with great retention. It looked like the top of a root beer float. Color was a deep, dark brown with cola highlights at the edges. Nose had a roasty, chocolaty sweetness, not really dark chocolate, but more like chocolate and smoke or chocolate and charcoal. Mouthfeel was more active with carbonation than I would prefer from a beer whose brewers are calling "silky". Taste was rich, chocolate and a light smokiness, to me more of a dessert beer than an everyday beer. I have to agree with them about the "bittersweet finish", but it was more sweet than bitter. I tend to think of bittersweet in terms of chocolate and this was somewhat sweeter than that, but there was also a modicum of bitterness.","woodychandler","Jun 24, 2011"

Carrying through the flavor is a refinement and clean flavor - and the beer finishes very clean. The oatmeal creaminess and roasted malt flavor shines in its subtlety and combines with a slightly sweet dark fruit flavor. The body is a little thinner than desired normally, but with good carbonation. I wish there was a touch more assertiveness in the flavor - a bit more roast or chocolatiness, but more importantly, there is a slight flavor in there that I do not like. I want to say it is a touch of sweet smokiness? Don't hold me to that, but there is something in there that brings it down a notch for me. Regardless, this is a good beer.","seeswo","May 11, 2011"

No alcohol to be found anywhere, this could be a session beer no doubt. Different enough from Sam Smith's Imperial Stout so that there is room for both of them in your beer fridge.

I personally prefer the American Oatmeal stouts (there's something about genuine English beers that are cloying to me - their unmistakable flavor profile gets old quickly to me for some reason) - maybe American beers are just a bit "crisper" or "cleaner."

The mouthfeel was very impressive for a bottle, smooth, body, and not over powering. Drinkability...1 to 2 everyday for the rest of my life and I would be a happy man.

I had been wanting to try this beer for a while and was hoping to be blown away; I'm a big fan of their imperial stout and brown ale. Sadly I'm only left thinking it was all right.

3.88,-7.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"550mL bottle. Pours a very deep, dark brown color with a big frothy tan head. Moderate amount of lacing. Aroma is earthy with some caramel and vanilla. Taste is a blend of chocolate, vanilla, caramel and coffee flavors. Not nearly as earthy as the smell would indicate. Slight tangy flavor. Rather heavy mouthfeel. Basically the benchmark by which other Oatmeal Stouts are measured, this is a great beer at a fair price.","PicoPapa","Feb 08, 2011"
3.43,-18.5,4,3.5,3,4.5,3.5,"This beer poured a dark raisin brown with a one finger, creamy beige head. When picking up the aromas the first thing I think of is Newcastle. It's very, very malty and there are slight dark fruits, namely raisin. The flavors are very malty and sweeter than expected. There's light chocolate, light dark fruits, and light roasted malty sweetness. The flavors are just meh. The mouthfeel is perfect though. This beer is exceptionally smooth. It drinks well but for an oatmeal stout I've had quite a few that're better than this. The flavor just throws me off a bit. It's still solid, just not worthy of the rating in my opinion.","aasher","Feb 08, 2011"

Thin mouthfeel for a stout, with less "chewiness" than others, but made up for with added flavor complexity. Malt swirls with coffee and bread grains for a hearty taste even if a bit liquidy. Carbonation is on the light side but crisp. There's definitely a place for this one in the world of stouts.","CountJustinian","Feb 07, 2011"

These two aromas compliment each other greatly with providing the desired smell/taste up front with the undertone armoa/taste he;ping to stand these main charectors threw.

4.1,-2.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pour: Pitch black with fluffy cream-white head. Decent retention and smooth lacing. Smell: Bready, sourdough almost; yeasty and grainy, with a soft, sweet, sugary toffee caramel note; molasses, maybe? A bit of a metallic edge, though. Taste: Smooth, sweet-ish, medium body, but with some character. A bit watery entering the mouth before a creamy, toffee-sweet character usurps the palate. Fairly clean and very smooth; silky and buttery; and just a pinch of hops and grassiness, as well as a pinch of gassy metallic sourness, in the finish. This is pretty nice, a winning, easy drinker. Pretty mellow, but still complex. There is a bready sweetness that sticks out, and gives it an almost candy-tinged character. I am on the fence as to whether this is a positive or negative. Like their Imperial, this Samuel Smith leans a tad sweet for my liking, though not to the point of ruining anything; and like their Taddy Porter, there is a slight, weird pungency in the background, which I'm not sure how to feel about exactly. Still, there's no question this is a quality brew that makes for some good, pleasant sipping. Of the oatmeal stouts I've tried, this remains one of the best.","bfflo","Dec 12, 2010"

Smooth as silk, each sip leaves you wanting more, every sip is a revelation. It is the most well balanced oatmeal stout, period.

Has a definite malty aroma, smell and taste is sweetish fruit, chocolate. Oat flavor is also noticeable and adds a nice dimension to the taste. This is surprisingly refreshing and for a stout I find it less bitter than expected. Would be highly drinkable, has a lower ABV than most stouts at 5%. A bit "tamer" than I expected, but still a damn delicious stout, looks pretty too. I would love to try this on tap in England someday.

Taste is very nice, lots of malts, some toffee and even coffee. Very nice flavors in the mouth, with a very nice finish. Very sweet throughout and pleasant.

The nose is full of sweet dark malts, it's really sweet up front and reminiscent of brown sugar or molasses; pretty much something to that nature that I really can't place my finger on. It's not the most complex aroma, but it's very pleasing and well done. The taste is sweet through and through. It's not bad but the flavor seems a bit bland. I can detect the dark sweet malts and a slight flavor of oak. It finishes with a bit of a coffee taste. Like I said, it seems bland, maybe subtle is a better word, but this is really an enjoyable drink. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, honestly what I would want from an oatmeal stout.

It's "oatmeal" label made the oat-taste stand out in my mind, but the flavor was filled mostly with coffee, chocolate, and perhaps some kind of herb like rosemary perhaps.

It isn't hoppy, but instead is well balanced like any English ale should be. I just drove twenty miles to find this beer and it is so smooth and well worth it. No American beer can match it.

3.98,-5.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"550ml bottle served in my Sam Smith nonic. Poured a deep, rich brown, almost black in complexion with some ruby highlights around the base of the glass. Head is dense and frothy (almost nitrous-like) and tan in color. As the head sizzles and pops and slowly collapses, it exposes a pockmarked surface and thin sticky webs of lacing as it settles into a solid half inch cap. Malty nose with the suggestion of coca, brown sugar and flaked oats. Taste consistent with nose; however, I get a little milky sweetness in the mix (perhaps some lactic acid) and a slightly metallic quality that comes out at the back. Body is light-medium, a bit on the thin side and a little watery, but goes down very smooth as the carbonation is very even and subtle. I tend to like a little more mouthfeel in my oatmeal stouts; however, this is a very pleasant and sessionable brew. Probably my favorite offering from this brewer.","Jwale73","Feb 05, 2010"

Huge oat flavor along with the roasted barley and malts. Nice bittersweet chocolate flavor that gives the beer a dryness. Just fantastically well rounded, gently bittered and perfectly roasty.

Its almost like if you were to put a little dark chocolate and a splash of milk in a cup of coffee.

4.5,6.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Almost black in colour, but you really need to look at a bit to notice it's brown tone. Very dark. Almost opaque. It's espresso look-a-like body is crowned by crema-like head, tightly-formed with a rich tan colour. That cap of foam shows excellent retention and clings thickly to the walls of your glass. Deep brown sugar aroma underpins notes of coffee and raisins. Tastes more breakfast roast than french. Initial coffee flavour gives way midpalate to fruit and semisweet chocolate. Finishes with a medium bitterness. Throughout, there is an underlying gentle sweetness. While not the heaviest stout around, the oats do give it some noticeable weight on the palate. It feels much heavier in the mouth than it does in the stomach. Very smooth and velvety, with very little carbonation. Well-rounded and flavourful, and a pleasure for all the senses. Outstanding.","mintjellie","Nov 16, 2009"

I like it quite a lot. the feel is a most a light-medium, but there is a very crisp carbonation that makes things a bit more exciting. the lightness of the beer, but the intensity and darkness of the taste make an interesting combination that I find quite chugable.","erz316","Nov 11, 2009"

Very fragrant nose of black grape, blackberry fruit, black licorice and sweetened coffee, hard toffee, minor oats and other grains, nothing bitter here, very dominated by the fruit. In the mouth it's medium-bodied, the carbonation has a fine prickle to it and keeps things spinning around the palate. More sheer roast in the coffee flavors, bringing out more dark chocolate and cocoa as a result. Hint of witchhazel. Remains noticeably grapey, you also get red plum, cherry and blueberry fruit. Good grip, not too creamy, stands up for itself and not over ingratiating. The toast also teases out additional breadiness. Good length as it finishes, dries out steadily, tidy ending.

Immediate flavors of over-ripened dark fruit, coffee, chocolate and burnt barley/hop bitterness brings in the finish.

With the pour comes a decent sized off white, light tan head that goes down fairly quickly after the pour but still leaves a small head for a while leaving some nice lacing down the glass. The aroma is roasted malt and chocolate. The taste is fairly the same with the chocolate and roasted malt and is kind of sweet. Has a sort of medium feel to it and is a little creamy.

Upon decanting it to a fine Guinness ale glass, it tastes rich and mellow with hints of clove, oatmeal, and a nice, malty finish. It is strong but never has any bite to go with the alcohol. It's very drinkable for a stout. Less bitter than Guinness bottled (the only good versions for me were on tap and in the Draught bottles and Cans with the Widget). Mellow, easily drinkable, rich, complex taste, and easily quaffable. Too interesting to be a session beer. I would give Samuel Smith an A- for this beer. Makes me feel warm and friendly drinking one.

There is a slight butterscotch flavor to the beer that detracts ever so slightly, but this one is well worth seeking out. There is also a milkshake quality to this beer, and it has the characteristics of a lactose-milk stout.

I'd take this over any coffee after dinner or for breakfast. Initially very smooth and velvety then the carbonation takes over. Low carbonation which I think gives it a heavier feel. Nice crisp bitter finish. Man I can drink this all day.","dyingwrist","May 25, 2008"

The nose is the weakest part of the beer with some malt smokiness and a coppery smell. Taste is defenitely the strongsuit here, and is immediately a roasted malt flavor that is huge with great smokiness and a wonderful burnt meatiness that sits well through the middle. The finish has some hops, but not enough to be bitter. Very silky mouthfeel through the middle, but still good carbonation. A grainy feel towards the finish detracts a little bit. aftertaste lingers smoke. Drinkability is superb, as there is a lot of flavor here for 5% without feeling abrasive or too soupy.

An even mouthfeel, slightly chewy and very creamy, and a complex mix of malty goodness combine well with the relatively light carbonation all add up to an excellent experience.

The scent of sweet roasted malt was most present. The taste followed as well with only a bit of bitterness. It went down sweet and wet with a medium body - not too heavy and not too thin. This is a nice switch from the stout of a Guiness. This is also a bit more sweet and malty than Gray's.

Not much hops at all detectable. This is a very sweet brew. For my taste is needs some bitter hops for balance. This is definitely a dessert beer and would go good with (or on top of) vanilla ice cream. In my opinion I have to rate lower on drinkability due to the lack of balance and excessive sweetness.

Dark brown, with a decent head that disappeared quickly but left a nice tan lacing all the way down the glass. All malt (dark toasted grain) in the nose and the taste starts with the same "dark roast" taste, but balances nicely. No change as the glass warms. And no perceptible alcohol taste. Very nice.

The flavor is excellent for a stout - goes down crisp and smooth with no traces of bitterness what-so-ever... This is an exceptional beer that I will definitely purchase again..

This six pack of 12 ouncers has been sitting in my basement for at least three years now and that's how long it's been since I had what was always one of my favorites (just got caught up in variety lately). So I was curious if this fine brew would hold up at all. It did pretty well. A very dark mahogany/black with a medium tan head and a super Guiness-like lace that wouldn't quit. The aroma is a fine mix of raisin, fig, coffee and smoke. The taste brings all that and more in a somewhat acqueous, lightly carbonated classic. It is somewhat winelike which I don't so much recall so it may be due to the unusual incubation period! I also pick up some roasted nuts and it's a bit more smokey. Very smooth with a nice coffee bitterness. Surpisingly drinkable but not really something I would want to drink too generously. Even after brutal storage this brew pleases.

4.23,0.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"My first oatmeal stout. It pours almost black, with a perfect tan, to dark tan head. Smell was not as strong as I thought it would be, but hints of chocolate and mocha. Taste of this beer is wonderful. Sweet milk chocolate, and hints of coffee, then followed by the slightest hint of dark chocolate. Mouthfeel was good, very creamy. Overall drinkability was good, however it would be hard to have more then a few of these at a time.","nickynick","Oct 11, 2007"
4.53,7.6,4.5,4,5,4,4.5,"D: A great drinkable lighter stout. When I first had this beer on my 21st birthday it really stood out from the other drinks I had on that day, and almost 2 years later it still stands up. One of the best all-around stouts that I have ever had, certainly a joy to drink.","Halcyondays","Oct 08, 2007"
4,-5,4,4,4,4,4,"D - I wouldn't suggest trying to knock back a couple of these right after a meal..as this could be used as a meal itself..very filling..low ABV so it sessions well..as far as the taste goes..each sip is inviting and the brew is begging you to go for another taste","meechum","Oct 07, 2007"
4.13,-1.9,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"I was delighted when I came upon this stout in a little hole-in-the-wall place that had NO redeeming qualities except for keeping this and several other Sam Smith's in stock. People, this is a very nice drink. It pours very dark (not black) and has a pretty thick, tan head that disappears after a few minutes. The smell is nice, lightly sweet and not overwhelming. The taste is similar- you notice caramel (or something that tastes like it) but its not sugary. The taste itself isn't heavy- its hearty and complex, it almost tastes like it should be good for you in a whole-grain kind of way. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I expected from a stout, but pleasant. It's a heavy, meal-like drink; maybe you could have 2 in one sitting if you ate light beforehand. Overall, if you should find this one, you really need to try it.","MyGoodness","Oct 05, 2007"
4.2,-0.2,4,4,4,5,4.5," The body is really the main draw here. The oatmeal lends a silky texture that is just sublime and fits the palate perfectly. This also renders the beer very easy to drink, ensuring that a solo drinker can handle the entire large bottle. A top notch stout from one of the world's great breweries.","ElGordo","Oct 02, 2007"
4.8,14,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Dark, rich, expertly balanced, and savory. Very approachable. American brewers take this ball and run with it, accentuating some of the subtle notes in this enjoyable brew, such as the patent malts, with their flinty and almost ashy flavor. Some Americans also push the oats and flaked barley, making for a more full, slick mouthfeel. But if you're looking for a traditional, consistent oatmeal stout, this is one to admire.","MrBen","Oct 02, 2007"
3.33,-20.9,3.5,3,3.5,4,3,"Pours nice from the bottle with a fair amount of head, even if it's not as much as I'm used to seeing from a stout. Nice dark tones, but again not as dark as I'm used to seeing in a stout. It has a slight stout aroma, but nothing as strong as I'm used to seeing from a stout, just a hint of bitters and a very, very slight waft of oatmeal. It does go down smooth, it's texture being its best quality in my opinion. It has a nice stout flavor, but there is not one flavor that really comes out, making it a mild stout.","JamesS","Sep 19, 2007"
4.17,-1,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Another good one from Sam Smith's. I have nothing bad to say about Sam Smith's except their beer, although outstanding, is way overpriced. This one pours a nice creamy head.

4.2,-0.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This is a good beer. Dark in color - completely black with light behind it. Head was about a finger-width upon pouring at about 40F. May have been a little cold for this beer. Head dropped to a nice lace in about 3 minutes. The smell is a little harder to pick up than some stouts, but it has a nice roasted aroma. Upon tasting, I found that it has a strong roasted grain flavor with bitter and alcoholic undertones. The alcohol does not stand out, and you have to search for it to find the taste. This drinks very well, better than Guinness in my opinion. The mouthfeel is thick and coating, which is expected of this style.","ralree","Aug 26, 2007"

It slowly settled into a constant foam with some lacing. The aroma was roasted and chocolate malts with a sweetness in the background. It was weaker than I remember so might need to rereview later. The taste was great. Nutty and chocolately. Very smooth from start to finish. Almost session beer smooth. The taste won't blow you away but you find yourself drinking it down and going back for more so I bumped the drinkability to reflect that. Mouthfeel was good but wanted a little creamier. It was just a little watery. Overall, an excellent brew that I highly recommend. This one has a home in the semi regular rotation. (4.5, RR, T, Y)","TexIndy","Aug 18, 2007"

Very roasted taste, almost smokey, as if the malt had actually been roasted over a fire. A nice, thick mouthfeel that was ok despite the summer months.

The taste is similar, with a smooth creamy lightly roasted maltiness that is very smooth and has notes of chocolate, vanilla, and sherry.

The taste of the oatmeal stout is not as pronounced as Smith's Imperial. It has a subtle roasted flavor, bit semi-sweet chocolate. The mouthfeel is as smooth as it gets, velvety.

Huge frothy beige head that stood two fingers high at it's peak slowly falls away to moderate glass-coating lace and a thin coat of film on top. Smells are roasted dark coffee and chocolate, malts, sweet caramel and toffee notes. Also a slight earthen grainy character present. Taste is sweet and roasty, chocolate and espresso flavors abound, finishes on a slightly bitter roasty flavor with a dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, medium to full bodied with lower levels of carbonation makes this one just silken-smooth. Drinkability is also great, very enjoyable stout characteristics and roasty complexity coupled with the low abv% make this an easy to enjoy oatmeal stout. Highly recommend and will seek out again.","danielocean03","Jan 01, 2007"

The smell is chocolate malt, dark fruit, molasses and oatmeal. The taste is much like the smell with a bit of acidity coming through. The mouthfeel is nice and full with a good level of carbonation and a plesent coating feeling the beer fills the mouth well.

I have had this beer a few times and I remember it tasting a lot more richer and creamier.

Beyond that, there are molasses, cola, rooty, licorice and anise smells; a very complex nosefull. The taste is so smooth and round on the palate with sweet, syrupy, molasses and chocolate flavors tempered by an alcoholic warming touch and a restrained hop presence.

I would start with some hops - There's practically no bitterness or hop flavor/aroma. And the body is good for beer in general, but not really for oatmeal stout.

Smell was dominated with lactates, accompanied with some light coffee and chocolate. Also in the nose were oats, a hint of something metallic, and also a somewhat pungeant vinnegar smell. Taste was a bit musty, but big on the oatmeal and chocolate flavors. This is a pretty big beer to be had, but in a good way in that this one could have fallen short. I have had many oatmeal stouts that just seem big and clunky, just pure heavyness without anything to really mention except its bigness. This oatmeal stout on the other hand has alot of personality and can be easily identified as being a Samuel Smith offering. As far as drinkability, although I enjoyed it, one bomber was more then enough for me, simply too much thickness for me. You can't really go wrong with this brewery, they time and time again provide classic esamples of the styles that they brew.

Even better than I had remembered, quite honestly. You can actually smell the oatmeal present, on top of a bit of smoke, with some sweet malt, and very, very subtle chocolate, as well. Smells absolutely delicious. The taste is very pleasant, exhibiting most everything present in the smell. The oatmeal itself is a bit less in the taste and more in the smell, but the smoke and chocolate along with the sweet, roasted malt are all very much present here. Mouthfeel is smooth and gentle.

In terms of mouthfeel, the beer enters strong and fizzy but as it moves back in the mouth it settles into a creamy oatmeal-y flavored mouth cover that is so damn enjoyable I don't want to swallow.

A strong caramel like smell to it, with a bit of fruity apple peel to it. This has an awesome flavor. There is a hint of coffee type malt that comes out toward the end of the swallow and leaves me saying Wow! A chocolatey, coffee. Up front it is that sweet malty, smell, maybe a little tamed. But regardless it is amazing. The apple peel flavor in the nose is not as strong to my tongue. Mouthfeel is not really syrupy, but it has a strong body to it. Very, very drinkable.

Very sweet roasted barley aroma, with some molasses notes. Sweet oats and deep roasted flavor is robust but not overwhelming. The lack of any hop profile is compensated by the bitterness from the malts, leaving a balanced flavor that is non-residual, but also not too dry. Light carbonation and a full body lend a smooth and drinkable character that compliment the rich flavor.

Its a pleasantly liquid beer, going down easily but not as thick or substantial as Id prefer. The finish is pleasingly bitter.

Flavors are similar to those in the nose, only much more bold, rich, and full. Never gets astringent or grainy. Big body finishes with flavors of plumbs and grapes (not wine).

I will definitely buy this again and would love to actually try it with ham and eggs.","droomyster","Mar 06, 2005"

This beer has an amazingly smooth mouthfeel, which I assume is from the oats. This is an incredible beer that I am especially partial to, as it is one of my first introductions to quality beer.

The beer's aroma has the usual coffee and chocolate notes found in most stouts, but there's a also fairly major fruity presense that pulls it all together. Normally I'm not a fan of fruit flavors in beer, but I like it here. It's not overpowering, and it's a nice compliment to the slightly sweet character of the oats and the chocolate flavors. The mouthfeel is very thick, just as an oatmeal stout should be. The finish could've used a little more bitterness, but it's not that bad. All things considered, this is a great beer. It's much more understated than Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout, and I like it better that way.","bearrunner44","Jan 28, 2005"

The color it pours is black comprised of red, looking though at the right angle shows the beers color of ruby so dark it becomes black. It makes sense as the stout is just a built up amber and this beer is a near perfect in color in my eye. The nose is a little lacking as the malt seems subdued, but there is a presences of earth roastedness and chocolate oats that escape. This has a great feel in the mouth of silky oat protiens that carry a roast bitterness that is delightful, still this beer has a metalic aftertaste that I couldn't seem to shake.

Following a nice smooth and sweet oat flavor along with a slight molasses take hold which adds a complex sweetness to this brew.

It slowly settled to a nice collar with some excellent lacing. This head survived several swirls. The aroma is good. Smelled something of oats, chocolate malt, and faint hops. Very pleasant, but not overwhelming. Taste was very rich with a complex development of oats, chocolate malt, and other darkly roasted malt flavors. Starts sweet, then finishes with a touch of hop bitterness for balance. Excellent! Mouthfeel was every so slightly thinner than I expected, though it did not seriously hurt the beer.

Some alcohol warming detected, even though this is only a 5% ABV beer. Flavors are smoother and more pronounced when letting the beer warm a little. A little hop bitterness provides balance. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, although a bit thinner than expected from an oatmeal stout, but it still manages to leave a thin coating on the glass and in your mouth.

3.95,-6.2,4,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Very dark brown body with a thin beige head. Just like the mcneills oatmeal stout, you can grab the oatmeal just by smelling. Deep malt profile full of chocolate, licorice, brown sugar sweetness and something powdery alike flour. There's no mistake on the tongue, this is a sweet stout, with caramelic peaks, tons of oatmeal, some powder sugar perhaps and nevertheless a great balance due to subdued english hops. Silky medium body, highly quaffable, definitely the most obvious definition of the style I've faced. On the other hand, it never comes close to approaching the imperial stout in terms of complexity.","Rastacouere","Apr 19, 2004"

A smokey chocolate character is present, but this is a pretty well balanced beer. No flavors were too strong or really propelled me to ponder this brew any further.

4.24,0.7,4,5,4,4,4,"When I was a young associate attorney at a big downtown law firm, I loved Starbuck's coffee. When you are expected to bill 2500 hours a year, a good caffeine jolt in the early morning is great. I realize now that I am older (and hopefully wiser), that my Starbuck's obsession was not so much because of the great flavor of the coffee, but that the buzz from said coffee was so intense that it made it seem better than it actually was. Add to that the fact that those coffees were 6 bucks a pop, and it really puts into perspective what a bunch of hype and elevated expectations can do for a drink. So goes the SS Oatmeal Stout. The head on this beer is nominal. The taste is OK, the smell is phenomenal. Overall, this beer is good, but not great. It will give you a good buzz, and tastes delicious. The aroma is fantastic, and the color is darker than Darth Vader. I still think that it's high listing is a self-fulfilling prophecy, though. There is no way this beer is better than Chimay.","Trentonator","Mar 30, 2004"

The flavor was beautifully full, and maintains dimension without being overly complex. There is a wonderul sweetness that accompanies this beer.

Smells like lightly roasted grains, caramel, and honey. Flowery hops with very mild bitterness. Taste leans definitely towards toward the fruity sweet end of the spectrum, with a mixture of plums, raisins, and cherries.

Ah that smell, rich sweet malt, toasted grains, coffee, earthy, sweet milk chocolate, a treat for the ocular and olfactory sense, start is ambrosial and rich in malt with the top middling in feel.

4.17,-1,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"I had this a few nights ago at a tavern in the 355 ml bottle and wasn't impressed (old, musty, excessively yeasty). But I decided to give it another shot for this review, and picked up a 550 ml bottle from a different establishment. So: pours a deep, deep brown; basically black at the center; rosewood/chestnut highlights appear when brew is held to light. Not much of a head on first pour, just a thin film of foam... a more vigorous pouring on the second attempt revealed an off-white to tan, dusky head about two fingers deep that eventually settled slightly. And the aroma... what a difference there was between this bottle and my previous sample! So much fresher, with a pleasant smell of fresh bread, rolled oats and a raisiny touch up front, sustained by a pervasive cream sherry sweetness throughout. The flavor continues the trend: more distinct cream sherry tones accompany a dark (almost pumpernickel?), oatmealy midpalate while remaining subtle and light. Suggestions of black bread, prunes, and puffed wheat cereal round everything out, punctuated by a bit of English hop dryness. Near perfect mouthfeel. Creamy and light, stunningly silky and smooth, but also tingly, dry, and warming... almost distributes itself across the palate without you even trying. Nowhere near the density I expected from such mealy flavors and aromas. Drinkability is hampered (if you can call it that) only because the brew is deeply satiating and filling--a beer to be savored and slowly digested--a bottle at a time will be enough. Tasty; soothing.

The smell has hints of roasted toffee and carmel and a little bit of coffee scent as well. The taste is out of this world, not only is is the smoothest stout you could ask for, it tastes just as it smells with a carmel, toffee and coffee flavor but with just the right ammount of sweetness to round it out.

Thick beige head eventually calms down to reveal a bit of the cherry color on the outside rim that was noted by some other reviewers. Don't know where that cherry hue comes from, but it makes for an exceptional appearance. Dark malts and chocolate dominate the nose, but there are hints of fresh baked bread and cooked oatmeal. Smooth, full bodied and filling in the mouth. Taste is of a well balanced stout that ehoes the nose. Very tasty. I took my time with this one because it's just too good to finish(it's my only one). One of the best that I've reviewed. My only complaint is a somewhat unpleasant syrupy aftertaste, but I guess that goes with the territory. Can't wait to get some more of these.

The mouthfeel was velvety, creamy and very easy to enjoy. Taste wise I found ample stoutlike qualities-chocolate, mocha etc, yet this one had that oatmeal thing going that perhaps gave it the complexity to make it just a bit more unique that other stouts.

Mouthfeel is not as creamy as, say, a Guinness, but still nice. This beer is initially easy to drink, but one winds up slowing down because its very filling, otherwise I'd give higher marks for drinkability.

But this is one stout I will always fall back upon and enjoy thoroughly. It's damn near opaque with a well-retaining tan head. The aroma is mostly burnt chocolate malt, faint coffee, sweetness, and hops. Same goes with the flavor as far as I'm concerned. It has a buttery, if slightly thin but still thick enough for a stout mouthfeel. And it's creamy....drinkable as all hell. I only prefer the Imperial because I'm on a robust kick.

The stout poured an almost jet black (just a slight shimmer of red--but the lighting was low) with a deep tan head. It had a distinct musty smell and only the slightest hint of fruit. The mouthfeel was excellent; it was viscous and even creamy with little carbonation. The taste had a heavy maltiness, like caramel, and again the subtle citrus fruitiness lingered on the back of my buds.

I think my efforts could have been better, but overall appearance was good: very dark liquid with a "thickish" foam which settled in nicely (forgot to check my glass prior for head maintenance). I sensed a very pleasant roasted and alcoholic quality in the smell and my tasting quickly followed. Very fine taste indeed. Full, up-front roasted flavor and great finish. Mouthfeel was also super (oatmeal-enhanced?).

Initial sweetness reminds me of Spaten Optimator but doesn't ever fully give way to the dry crispness of alcohol.  Creamy, carmely middle with a lighter version of the typical stout profile.  Drink after drink, and I just can't pin down the flavors (and that ain't a bad thing).  A pleasant mouthfeel and good drinkability top off this wonderful experience.","BitteBier","Nov 01, 2002"

I've never really been one to study the smell, appearance, and mouthfeel of beers like some of the aficionados on this site, but I just can't help it with this one. From the wonderful smoky aroma from when you first pop the cap, to the beautiful tan head that never goes away, to the slow caramel-like finish, this brew is a winner all the way.

The aroma offers a bright fruitiness, some light chocolate, a mild roastiness and a hint of butterscotch. The body is light-medium with a very fine, restrained carbonation that gives it a silky smooth mouthfeel. The flavor is sweetly malty with a good dose of fruitiness up front, followed by some bittersweet & dark chocolate notes as it crosses the palate, and finishing with a more noticeable bitterness, some nuttiness, and a long lasting gentle roastiness. Clearly balanced toward the sweet side. There's a mild diacetyl here that seems to pull the whole thing together. It never appears to become more than just a light butterscotch note, but it helps to round everything out so nicely - smoothing out the roastiness, and maybe even helping to keep the sweetness in check.(?) A very nice, and highly enjoyable beer, that is soft & sweet & light but also offers alot of character - allowing it to fill a variety of different roles. Highly recommended.","NeroFiddled","Sep 23, 2002"

It wants stout to be black black black, which this isn't. This is more of a Dunkin Donuts black coffee color than a Peet's espresso. But who cares about looks? Sweet, candied, roasted oats. It smells like something you should feed a reindeer; even some fruitcake spices are lurking underneath making the whole aroma very yule. Oh yeah, nuts too. And tobacco. A cigar-chomping, gluttonous Thrasher. A perfect attack of silky malty toasted almonds, brazil nuts and millet with a shy bitterness that gives definition and cut to the finish.

I tried this based on the beer advocates rating, and it was better than I thought it would be. Of all the beers I have had, this is the most memorable. Of the Stouts I have had I would rank them: 1. Sam Smith Oatmeal  2.Young's Double Chocolate 3. Young's Oatmeal. 4. Old Rasputin Imperial","StevieW","May 18, 2002"
4.6,9.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"I was skeptical that this beer could live up to it's reputation, but it truly is a wonderful stout.  The color was spot on and the head nicely colored and creamy.  Nice full body with a fair amount of complexity.  Chocolate and roasted malt flavors mixed with flavors I could not identify.  The beer finishes smooth and dry with only the slightest hint of bitterness.  Overall, the best oatmeal stout I have had.","jreitman","May 15, 2002"

4.52,7.4,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"As luck would have it, my local packy just got a fresh shipment the day I noticed it was at the top of BA's Top Beers list.  Giddy-up!  Pours black(duh) with thin tan head.  Roasty aromas with a slight Yorkshire yeast "twang". You can almost smell the smoothness.  The stuff slips down your throat so quick you become thankfull it comes in a big-ass 550ml bottle.  The contrast between sweet, smooth and silky mouthfeel and the drying bitterness of the burnt malt and hops is amazing.  I haven't had this in many years but will most definately buy it again very soon.","pbrian","May 08, 2002"
4.56,8.3,5,4,4.5,5,5,"pours out an opaque murky brown colour with a huge rocky head that reduced quickly but left lots of patchy lace. aroma of dark roasted malts, ripened fruits and butter. full bodied mouthfeel is complimented by the roasted malt. incredibly silky smooth and satisfying. chocolate, caramel, toffee and some fruitiness in the taste profile, and the use of oatmeal really takes the edge off any bitterness that is present, and makes the drinkability all the better. certainly worthy of all praise and deserving of it's high rating.","budgood1","May 04, 2002"
4.7,11.6,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Had this last night and realized how good this beer is.  It had been awhile since I drank this stout and decided to pick one up after seeing it sitting near the top here for some time.  I should have done it sooner.  I actually had a Youngs Double Chocalate Stout afterwards and this is the one that was rememberable enough to review tonight.  Quick overview - Deep dark color, ruby tint when held to the light, rich, creamy tan head.  Roasted malt aroma, rich and creamy taste with notes of coffee and chocolate.  No decernable hop bite, and goes down smooth as silk.  I will pick up some more tomorrow.","DrewS","Apr 28, 2002"
4.66,10.7,5,4,5,5,4.5,"Sam Smith’s Oatmeal Stout: 550 ml clear bottle, gold foil top.  Rich, dense foam head stands a good inch and half over the rim of the glass.  Very light aroma, with a hint of coffee with a drop of cream.  Very smooth, rich creamy malt taste, with very little aftertaste.  No carbonation.  This is a fantastic beer, rich and creamy.   This beer will definitely replace your dessert after a big meal, although a slice of tiramisu might be nice on the side.  This has to be in my top five, and is highly recommended.","jackndan","Apr 27, 2002"

3.84,-8.8,4.5,3,4,4.5,4,"This is an excellent beer. A meal itself. The smell turns me off slightly but it is quite tasty and feels good in the mouth and throat. It feels like it hits lighter than a 5% though, which is good IMO. I suggest having it without a meal, it's deserving of attention.","packetknife","Apr 21, 2002"
3.88,-7.8,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,"Big bubbled head, softly persistent and light tan in color. Slightly less than jet black color, muted aroma. Pleasant creamy malt flavor, no hint of a hop bite. Long on mouthfeel, short on super interesting flavor. Nice beer and example of style, love the pillowy globs of foam on the pint glass, but it needs more flavor. There is that characteristic nuttiness to the profile that I find interesting and nice to note. This beer review might suffer because of a back-to-back comparison with Rogue Shakespeare.","ADR","Apr 17, 2002"
4.5,6.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The thick beige head tops the nearly black hued brew-- a hint of a deep but clear garnet color is discernable when held to light.  It's appetizing in appearance.  The very pleasant aroma is comprised of chocolate, butterscotch, mild roasted barley and a hint of yeast - derived fruitiness. The meager hint of Kent Goldings is dominated by the malt notes. Silky smooth mouthfeel like a good outmeal stout should have.  Bittersweet in flavor from a superlative balance of residual sugars and bitterness from roasted grain and moderate hopping.  The mild diacetyl combined w/ the chocolate malt flavors lends a rich, dark chocolate note.  Finishes w/ sweetness on the tip of the tongue and a mellow bitterness that coats my palette.  Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout is the epitomy of balance.  Compared to many microbrewed versions it's quite sophisticated. It's worth the extra price.  I've forgotten how good this is.","marc77","Apr 16, 2002"
4.2,-0.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Excellent. There is such a nice balance to this stout. It has a slight sweet taste that combines with that of lightly rosted coffee with a molasses finish. Man, I sound like a food critic from a fancy restaurant just now. Ouch. I've said it before and I'll say it again...the oats make beers of this style like a meal.","proc","Apr 15, 2002"

4.15,-1.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"This beer appears black and has great tan head with great retention (which I have not seen lately from a bottled beer).  Beautiful cocoa/coffee aroma.  The brew rolls over the tongue like velvet.  Taste of coffee beans and bittersweet chocolate dominate.  There's a nice bitterness here.  The hops aren't distinguishable, but the bitterness is.  I think the bitterness is probably more due to the roasted malts.  Great Oatmeal Stout.","Bighuge","Mar 27, 2002"
4.66,10.7,5,4,5,5,4.5,"This is one of the best beers I have ever tasted. Beautiful black/ruby color with a lacy tan head.

4.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"This is a fine, fine beer. Damn near perfect but I have to fault Sam Smith for using clear glass bottles. Despite that, this sweet stout holds its flavor pretty well. Creamy beige head atop a black beer although not as dark as SS's Taddy Porter. Very sweet, an excellent dessert beer; a marked contrast to the equally pleasurable but much spicier Imperial Stout. The oatmeal is detectable but insignificant compared to the amount of sugar, which puts a nice cap on the warm malt character. The beer equivalent of coffee with cream and lots of sugar. Low in alcohol but too sweet to drink lots of.","Thrasher","Mar 03, 2002"

It may be a better than average stout, but plenty of less expensive stouts are better. Considering expecations, I found the taste to be rather bland and lacking in subtlety.","mickeymac","Feb 18, 2002"
