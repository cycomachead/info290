3.98,2.6,4,4,4,3.75,4,"Overall, this was a nice cap to our tasting night at Toppling Goliath.  It is really kind of unfair that we tasted this on the same night as Zee, Sue, and Tsunami, but it was certainly nice to see the more malty, roasty side they have to offer.  The beer was smooth, flavorful, and easily approachable.  The oats and accompanying malt base was nicely singed at the base, making for that fuller experience.  Otherwise, the brew wasn’t as memorable as their hoppy beers, as we’ve already alluded to.  It does hit the spot if you’re in the mood, however, and the staff is more than happy to blend you up something creative using this beer with any others they have available at the time.","TheBrewo","Jan 25, 2015"
