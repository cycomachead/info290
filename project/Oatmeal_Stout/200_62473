The other gripe I have is in the body of this brew, it is lacking just a bit and seems lighter than it should for being advertised as an oatmeal stout. I would have liked to seen a bit more fuller or smoother body from the oats. Otherwise this was a pretty good brew.

There is a nice roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. A bit thin for a stout in my opinion.

The nose comprises roasted malts, buttery toffee, toasted wheat, and a kiss of cocoa. The taste brings in more of the same, with a touch more cocoa and buttery biscuit than before. Thankfully, the roast never gets overdone, as happens on many occasions in the oatmeal stout world. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth, creamy feel.

The beer smells of chocolate, roasted malts, and the slightest hint of coffee. This beer tastes of stale, burnt coffee. Also caught notes of watered down chocolate oats. Unfortunately this beer doesn't taste anywhere near how it smells. The mouthful is pretty thin and I don't catch that silky smooth finish a good oatmeal stout contains. Overall this beer is very, very average. If it wasn't for the the decent appearance and smell, which are both pretty good, this beer would be very below average.

Flavor is old coffee and minerals, chocolate milk made with water instead of milk (I guess you'd call that chocolate water), charred coffee beans and a lingering metal note that recalls sucking on a penny. Unfortunately, this beer derives no full mouthfeel or silkiness from its use of oats, and so my tongue derives no satisfaction. About what I expected from Mendocino.","illidurit","Apr 05, 2011"
