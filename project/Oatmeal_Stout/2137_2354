3.65,0.3,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.25,3.5,"Overall : I enjoy the beer but there's a lot wrong with it. First off, there's no oatmeal. If you're going to advertise "oatmeal stout" on the label, I should be able to detect it with one of my five senses. This is very much an English Stout, as it's a bit too intense for a milk or sweet stout and is wreaked with kilned malts. Drink it ice cold, because as it warms up its flaws become glaringly clear. It's basically very burnt and charred, mixing with some dark chocolate and dirt and hop. It's decent but not outstanding.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Mar 14, 2015"

3.65,0.3,4,4,3.5,3,3.75,"Overall: I remembered not being very impressed with this last time. True, it's not the smoothest, richest, most flavorful oatmeal stout, but it has a nice balance of fairly subtle flavors and it's pretty drinkable.","maedhros09","Feb 23, 2015"
