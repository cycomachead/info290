2.37,-34.5,2,2.5,2.5,2,2.25,"Lacks that great silky and creamy body I find and look for in this style. From there it cascades downward with a heavy dose of fruits and something that feels like yeast off flavors (reminds me of my early homebrewing days). Very underwhelming compared to the great Stouts out there today.","cbutova","Jan 17, 2015"
