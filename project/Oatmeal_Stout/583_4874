3.82,4.7,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,4," The flavor is roasted and nutty with an almost coffee-like roastiness with slight yeasty and vegetal aspect which is okay with some toasted notes from the malt in the background and light spice from the hops I am assuming. The flavor has a bitterness of roasted grain with slight vegetal creaminess with more burnt malt flavor lasting into the finish. The flavor is good with some light cocoa on the tongue near the last taste adding a nice depth to the combination of malt and yeast flavors. Overall this is pretty decent, actually it is a very drinkable stout with nice layering and even though it is a little more carbonated than most it is not too sweet and the roast level is pretty spot on without becoming too much by the end of the glass.","Slatetank","Aug 25, 2013"

Bitter coffee, burnt sugar, light char, glimpse of dark fruit, roasted malt, faint chocolate and oats. Maybe some salted peanut. taste is slightly metallic up front. Body is thin and watery. My first thought is; "this is more like a porter than a stout." Has no depth or creaminess. Travels the palate way too quickly. Follows the nose with weak flavor of coffee, chocolate and the fruit has disappeared. Malt is weak and although this has balance it is lacking in intensity and depth. There’s a hop bitter mid palate that settles in back and without it there would be hardly any aftertaste except for the raw oat taste and a salted peanut flavor. I think this has potential but it just isn’t finished yet. It needs some tweaking.","utopiajane","Jul 17, 2013"

Go for this if you enjoy a nice, roasty stout with good oaty and grainy attributes. Don't order if your looking for a medium bodied brew or anything less than medium-full.

A foamy dark cream colored head sits on top. The head dissipates to a thin layer with random bubbles, but by the end there's hardly anything. Sticky lacing. It's hard to get a bead on the aroma, bitter chocolate is present. It tastes of bitter chocolate, burnt malts, and maybe a hint of oats. It's not all that complex. The mouthfeel is lacking. It's just too watery. Overall, I didn't know what to expect. I'm not overly impressed with Schlafly's offerings, except their Pumpkin Ale.

The taste is coffeeish, roasted malt, some espresso notes, & not as smooth as expected taking into account the flakes used to make this style. It's quite reserved but a decent stout.

The flavors were equally taut, bitter coffee, caramel with a milk chocolate finish when the malts balance out. Malts are a little chalky though.

It also made a nice accompaniment to a mushroom-smothered pork chop. Its a dark, black beer with an exceptionally creamy light-brown head. An aroma of deeply roasted barley and oats is appealing. The beer also has a pronounced and lingering coffee and smoke smell. All together, its very nice. The taste is a mix of dark chocolate, roasted grains, oats, and a distinct malt sweetness. The hops are very toned down in this beer, which has a loud grain and oat quality. Fully body with a mouth-filling feel. Its an extremely satisfying beer. Its a moderately complex beer, but theres not so much going on that it doesnt go well with food. Im very pleased to have found this one.","Suds","May 07, 2005"
3.24,-11.2,3,4,3,3,3,"This beer is dark brown, a bit light for a stout. There is a decent tan head. The smell of chocolate is inviting but the taste just doesn't live up to it. It is not really bitter, it's more of a sourness or sharpness. Maybe I just don't like the particular hops used. Or maybe they were just too skimpy on the fermentables. The mouthfeel is thin and sharp, and it is highly carbonated. Drinkability is average. Overall it is average, it just doesn't meet my expectations compared to other oatmeal stouts.","bigbubba","Apr 28, 2005"
4.08,11.8,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Very smooth and very easy to drink. I want another already. The body is a little thin for this style, but it is still relatively filling.","whynot44","Apr 23, 2005"
4.14,13.4,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"This may be a bit better on-tap at the Tap Room and I've never had cask beer but I could imagine it being great there as well (something I MUST try on my next trip to St Louis). A worthwhile oatmeal stout","DPMomutant","Apr 12, 2005"
2.91,-20.3,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"Dark brown in hue, blacker in the middle, redder around the edges. Shiny. The head was beige in color; at the apex the foam was almost two-fingers in height before it quickly faded to a clumpy, soapy cap. The subsequent lacing was unorganized and moderate in its coverage. I like how this beer looks. The nose was unimpressive. It lacked any sort of assertive oat sweetness or roasted qualities. The loudest smell was metal, tin to be exact. Smells like a bottle too. Weak astringency tries to shine through. Im not impressed with the nose and I cant call it inviting. The palate is not impressive either. Like the nose the palate lacks any sort of assertive oat sweetness or roasted qualities. In fact this beer doesnt even taste like an Oatmeal Stout to me. Porter? Sure. Regardless of what it is, this beer really isnt that good. At best the palate is ordinary with very weak (and irrelevant) kisses of roast, char, day old coffee grinds (diluted), and some caramel sweetness. I have lost interest in this beer quickly. I should have never drunk the bottle version; I should have let the image of the cask-conditioned nectar stay at the forefront of my mind. The finish is clean, way too clean for a quality beer. I also dont like the rawness that sits at the back of my tongue, it is disjointed and it fails to add anything to the taste. Yawn. Ive had very few Oatmeal Stouts that tasted less like an Oatmeal Stout. Sad. Medium in body, firm carbonation but it fits the mouthfeel well. However there is something stiff and lifeless about it. I felt compelled to swallow just to get it out of my mouth. It is hard to savor anything that way; no loss really as this beer doesnt have any flavors worth savoring. Drinkable? Well, it is easy to drink because there is nothing there but that is hardly what Im looking for in a beer. I am hugely disappointed in this offering. I cant see returning to this beer in the future. This was purchased at the Tap Room in St. Louis as part of a mixed six-pack. I say skip it.","bditty187","Apr 06, 2005"
4.67,27.9,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Near pitch black in hue, 1/3 inch dark tan head with intense patching and sticky lacing. Roasted malts, oats and some dark chocolate can be detected on the nose. A massively smooth and slick palate. Dried oats, burnt coffee, hints of chocolate and blended roasted malts to be found in the body. Nearly too easy and smooth, for the style oh-so thirst quenching. Tender hop bitterness and sweet malts coupled with strings of black licorice; oily-slick and lip-smacking good, enough word describers? Well rounded and full of great flavorings. This stuff is world class on cask, liquid gold!","GeoffRizzo","Mar 11, 2005"
4.3,17.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Yeah, so overall, this is awesome. Really. The cask conditioning transforms this from a pretty good stout to a spectacular one. Definitely on the must try list.","amicar","Mar 08, 2005"
4.1,12.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This beer pours a dark reddish brown. The head is creamy tan. It fades fast leaving decent laces. It smells very malty. There are hints of caramel and chocolate. The malty aroma dominates though. It tastes malty and sweet. The roasted malts are quite apparent. There is a light caramel taste. This beer is carbonated perfectly. It leaves a sweet caramel like taste on the palate It is easy to drink. It is just a little thin. Most stouts are very thick, but this one seems just a little thin. This would be a good session beer because it is not too strong and the flavors are not too intense. I would definately drink this beer again if it was avaliable here in California.","OStrungT","Feb 28, 2005"
3.91,7.1,4.5,3.5,4,3,4.5,"On tap at the TapRoom was just as good as from the bottle. Still, dark brown/black with an impressive brownish head that laced throughout. Carbonation is less, taste is still malty chocolate with a small underlying hop kick. Still a little thin for a stout. But still very drinkable for one, two or a session","Vancer","Feb 14, 2005"

2.95,-19.2,3,3,3,2.5,3,"Pours a dark black/brown with a minimalist head. Smells sweet and full of chocolate. Deception. Taste is weakly coffee based with a lot of the barley bite that I look for in a stout sadly absent. Scant traces of vanilla and espresso round it out but it's too late. Mouthfeel is way too watery for an oaty. Borderline soda like quality in the carbonation. It's drinkable but not by me.","yankeeheel","Sep 30, 2004"
4.02,10.1,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Chilled sample in a pint glass. The beer pours a dark brown color with a soft fluffy beige head foamin up easily and residing on the surface for a long time. Aroma is sweet toffee, and rich roasted malt, some slight nuttiness perhaps? No real hop presence I can detect. First sip reveals a creamy, silky textured brew with very mild carbonation. Flavor is very roasty up front and rolls to a big malt sweetness of chocolate and caramel, some nuttiness here as well. The finish is slightly coffee bitter but is still appealing. Very smooth and tasty brew. Another winner from Schlafly!!","sulldaddy","Sep 11, 2004"
3.62,-0.8,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Flavor is ra big roast impression dancing hard on the palate for a time before a smooth slick body supports a caramel malt that leads to a hoppy finish that plays with the remaining roast.","drewbage","Sep 11, 2004"
4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"I had this beer courtesy of a beer trade with MJR. 12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Beer pours with a redish brown color and a moderate head. The aroma is heavy with grains, acid, and alcohol. The flavor is complex with hints of coffee, black tea, citrus, pumperninckel bread, malt, sweet hops and a grassy note.","BrewMaster","Sep 02, 2004"
4.06,11.2,5,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a winsome onyx color; the head is a cap of frothy chocolate and the residual lace a sticky sheet. The aroma of burnt sugar, light coffee, sweet malted grain and quite pleasing this nose, start is rich and sweet, the top full and pleasurable to the palate. Mildly carbonated, the hops pesky in their bite, sweet and dry aftertaste, a quaffable brew tis true.","Gusler","Oct 26, 2003"

3.41,-6.6,3.5,2.5,3.5,4,4,"I was taken aback initially by this beer's aroma, a bit offputting as it gave a sense of spoilage. This faded with the miniscule, mid tan head and let the taste predominate. The pour revealed a deep reddish black color that will barely pass light, ruby red at the edge. The taste is of smoked or burned sugars. The finish leaves bitters in the back. Solid body with decent mouthfeel, perhaps a bit thin for the style. Very thin ring lacing. A final touch of licorice in the finish is sensed. Not a bad offering, but better are available.","AtLagerHeads","Mar 20, 2003"

Dark roasted malty chocolate burnt coffee flavor, nice bitter hop finish, hoppy for the style this is not a sweet stout it is dry and bitter, but it is great oatmeal stout, better on draught than the bottled.","maxpower","Feb 07, 2003"
4.13,13.2,4.5,4,4.5,3,4,"Only complaint is that the body is very thin or light. A thicker mouthfeel would make this an excellent beer. It might be more drinkable as it is, but the thinner body is disappointing. This is for the bottled version.","yemenmocha","Feb 01, 2003"
4.45,21.9,4,4,5,3.5,4.5,"Jet black with an inch and a half of head on it. Smelled of malt and chocolate. Smooth and creamy the first hit and a malty finish to it slightly bitter but nothing dramatic.

4.3,17.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I sampled the Oatmeal Stout cask-conditioned at the brewpub. The flavor was much better than either the bottled version or the regular draft.

The cask version even seemed to have slightly more malty aroma than the other versions.","UncleJimbo","Dec 27, 2002"
3.83,4.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"pours out black as night. thin head and nice lacing. light aromas of burnt roasted malt and a bit of hops. dark roasted malts are evident, even burnt or woody in profile. malts add bitterness, but an above average hop presence adds some more flavors, and a bit of additional bittrness in the finish. pretty smooth, as an oatmeal stout should be. a slightly thin mouthfeel is masked by the above average hopping. can't find too much fault here. a good stout!","budgood1","Dec 12, 2002"
4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Nice deep dark color with a tan lace.  The aroma is of roasted coffee.  The sweet dark malt sweetness with a hint of sour and a dark malt sweetness.  The full body supports a slight bitterness in the finish.  Very drinkable and relatively tasty.","beernut7","Nov 04, 2002"
3.13,-14.2,3.5,3,3.5,3,2.5,"Sampled at Schlafly's Tap Room at the St. Louis Airport. Served in a frosty mug - which really sucked. No head. Hardly any aroma. Smoky, sooty taste with nothing in the way of oatmeal sweetness or smoothness. Lingering aftertaste that was decent but slightly reminiscent of Dr. Pepper (corn syrup). This was disappointing. It had that unpleasant tar and meat quality found under the surface in so many American micro stouts. The description said: "this stout has sweetness from caramel malt, and bitterness from roasted barley..." which doesn't make sense to me, unless they threw in some unmalted roast barley, but that seems unlikely. If in St. Louis, Morgan Street Brewpub has a better stout.","Thrasher","Jul 09, 2002"
