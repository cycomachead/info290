4.25,14.2,,,,,,"Prune, coffee and grain on the nose. Pours bright black under a 1‚Äù finely bubbled tan foam cap. The palate starts with grain, chocolate, light coffee, and fruit. The roast is fairly mild and the beer starts with a little sweetness but dries out with a hint of sour on the finish. Above average carbonation and a medium full body. Very easy to drink.","pat61","Oct 10, 2014"
