Nose is fairly subdued, but suggests molasses, brown sugar and a hint of acidic, dark fruit in the back. Taste follows nose, but there's also a slightly metallic quality towards the back. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied and a little overly effervescent for the style - a little watery and somewhat lacking in consistency.

The smell is what you might expect from an oatmeal stout, roasted barley, coffee and chocolate, maybe a hint of vanilla. The taste is well balanced, with the slight sweetness of chocolate malt being countered with an unexpected bitterness. Roasted notes are quite prominent and there is a slight oxidation present which hurts the taste score. The mouthfeel is full-bodied and the carbonation is more aggressive than creamy.

There is a bit of alcohol acridness in the nose as well. Taste was the same way, crazy amounts of overly smoky coffee (almost burnt) and then subsiding as it sat for a short time, becoming creamier but still maintaining a hefty coffee toasty flavor.

3.84,3.2,3,4,3.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability: An enjoyable (and highly drinkable) stout. If you're a fan of the style, I'd definitely recommend it. It is a nice fallback session stout around these parts since it is widely available in this area.","hero27","Feb 15, 2005"
4.12,10.8,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel has a silky smooth creaminess to it with just enough carbonation to make it lively on the palate. This is a stout that I wouldn't mind sessioning with and is a nice suprise as I just picked it up on a whim while I was in Iowa. Recommended.","orbitalr0x","Feb 06, 2005"
2.83,-23.9,4,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"I emailed the brewery and they suggested the off taste came from the fact that I had an 8-month old bottle; since they don't pasteurize their beer, that's past its prime. I will definietly buy more fresh beer and revise my review at a future date.","DrunkMcDermott","Feb 01, 2005"
4.1,10.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 oz bottle obtained from To Your Health (Coralville) in Janurary 2005 and consumed that same evening. Freshness date says November. Pours thick and silent with a half-finger brown head...and with a chocolate smell. Appears utterly pitch black, even when held up to a light. Smell has a nice blend of chocolate and coffee. Taste takes a while to take hold. Chocolate and coffee run around playing tag in my mouth. First one dominates, then the other. What an interesting experience. Hazelnut comes in late and the finish is dry and roasty. Body is medium heavy and carbonation is strong (too heavy for the style IMO). The flavors are really well-balanced in this beer. I find this to be one of the most drinkable stouts I've ever had.","mentor","Jan 06, 2005"
3.88,4.3,4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"This is my first experience with an oatmeal stout. I must say, being an Iowa native, I am quite surprised to see that a state with such a strong love affair for sissy yellow beer could produce such a deliciously black nectar. This was my third favorite of Millstream's product line when I took the tour earlier today. It pours quite dark with a small tan head. Tastes almost like a Guiness, but not quite as dry or harsh. While I can appreciate this beer for what it is, it would not be my choice for a medium to heavy session.","neonbrown82","Jan 02, 2005"
4.03,8.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Dark brown body. No light penetrateth. Creamy, toasted-tan head. Nice. Good lacing. Sweet, roasted barley with notes of coffee and chocolate. Smells good to me. Sweetish mocha sweetness unfolds, amidst lightly roasted barley. Full-bodied, and velvety-creamy. Slight homebrew funk. Reminds me of Lake Superior's Sir Duluth. Overall, a very nice oatmeal stout that would make a great session beer.","alexgash","Dec 30, 2004"
4.32,16.1,4,4.5,4,4,5,"This is one of the most drinkable stouts that I've ever had. Sweet malt upfront, not roasted and bitter, just a hint of coffee and toffee mixed with and oaty aftertaste. Really nice, but not very complex or strong. Good mouthfeel, but not great, and, like I said, this is the most drinkable stout that I've ever come across.","mynie","Oct 30, 2004"
3.19,-14.2,2.5,3.5,3,2,4,"Dark brown with the usual Millstream fizzy and short-live head. The aroma is full of sweet chocolate and roast with a bit of oatmeal. The flavor is fairly big, but comes across as a bit thin. The body is really watery for the style and unsatisfying despite the flavor being pretty good. This brewerys best beer is definitely the Johns Generations, an excellent witbier.","aracauna","Sep 23, 2004"
3.48,-6.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Thanks to BuckeyeNation for the trade. Pours a very dark brown color that lets a little light through. Thin beige head that dissipated rapidly. Not much lacing until further down the glass. The aroma consists mainly of coffee as well as a touch of malt. Medium-bodied with a milky texture. Roasted coffee, malt and a touch of tart fruit in the flavor. The finish is smooth with a lightly bitter character. Nothing too exciting going on here, just a run-of-the-mill Oatmeal Stout you can find anywhere.","Dogbrick","Aug 16, 2004"
2.85,-23.4,4.5,4.5,2,3,2,"Taste is far too sweet; it has tart, tangy, tones that aren't doing it for me. Lots of malt and oat sweetness thats becoming uncomfortably close to wine-like for an oatmeal stout. Dark cherry and some charred wood notes actually make a way in towards the finish, but the sweetness here is over the top for me. Perhaps this has gotten past its prime. The smell maybe eludes to what it may have once existed in flavors, but this is a sweetified, tangy mess. No matter how hard I try, I cannot enjoy this bottle. Looked and smelled promising, but the taste promised nothing but an overly sweet twang of undrinkable soda pop syrup.","tavernjef","Jul 29, 2004"
3.8,2.2,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Backwash: Quite an interesting beer. Labelled as a lager, you would hardly know it but for the slightly diluted body and perhaps the simple flavor profile. Still, it provides a good deal of flavor and enjoyment in a tight, refined package. A fine local choice.","Dantes","Apr 19, 2004"
3.85,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Millstream Colony Oatmeal Stout is a good version. I'll have no problem drinking locally after tasting this beer.","BuckeyeNation","Mar 18, 2004"
3.32,-10.8,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,2,"I guess this beer caught me off guard. Just being a beggining beer drinker I haven't had much experience with darker beers. Personally I wasn't a big fan of the nutty taste. It had an almost coffee dark taste to it. If you are a fan of darker beers this one will be the one for you. It's tastes are complex enough for a dark beer fan.","beerfan82","Jan 20, 2004"
4.4,18.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Call it a stout, or call it a dark lager, Colony Oatmeal Stout is one fine beer.","RedBaron","Nov 18, 2003"
2.95,-20.7,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,3,"This beer is a completely black beer, with a small, brown head on the top. The smell is of clean, lagered water, and of chocolate. The taste is a bit peculiar, clean lagered, chocolate, pretty sweet, a tad bitter, and something else, possibly some fruit. It just seems a bit confused, something about it but this isnt my favorite.","Tballz420","Nov 01, 2003"
3.64,-2.2,4,2.5,4,4,4,"Dark black color, small head. Aroma is mildly choolate, but kind of weak. A medium bodied Oatmeal stout. Roasted malts, chocolatly and slightly sweet. Mild hops, slightly spicy. Big taste, full flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is very dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nice stout.","beerguy101","Sep 02, 2003"
3.45,-7.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Not a bad brew at all, but the lack of top-fermenting yeast did not please this stout-fan's palate at all, only left me yearning for a true stout.","feloniousmonk","Jun 18, 2003"
3.93,5.6,4.5,4,4,3,4,"The beer pours that most lovely of colors A deep mahogany brown to black, the head is plentiful, light chocolate in color, the lace sticky thick sheets that adhere nicely to the glass. Sweet roasted barley dominates the nose, hot milk chocolate also come to mind, caramel and quite a pleasure to Sniff. Front is sweet, the top is middling in mouth feel, with a pertinent acidic bite, hops pleasing to the palate, the aftertaste bittersweet and dry. The beer is drinkable, although a bit "Watery", would classify it as a "Beginners" introduction to the dark side and stouts, so maybe I should temper my criticism.","Gusler","Dec 03, 2002"
3.57,-4,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"This beer is a dark ruby.  It is capped by a fizzy brown head that recedes to and edging within seconds.  Chocolatey and coffee-like on the nose.  Pretty nice.  This stout features some bittersweet chocolate tones as well as burnt malt.  Also present to a small degree is dark fruity tones.  Everything melds together nicely.  Not as creamy of a mouthfeel as I like in my stouts, but drinkable nonetheless.  Not too bad.  Not too great.","Bighuge","Oct 21, 2002"
3.8,2.2,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Good solid black appearance, but lacks the oily thickness of other stouts.  Smells of dark chocolate.  Taste is appealing with bittersweet chocolate in the front, more bitter at first and sweet afterwards, and a good maltiness in the middle.  Hops are slightly present, smooth and easy down the pipe.","jmatthew","Oct 11, 2002"
3.64,-2.2,3,4,3.5,3,4,"Nearly opaque jet black hue, w/ a hint of hazy deep garnet when held to light.  The light brown head settles quickly into a thin layer that leaves sparse islands of bubbles. Sharp, coffeeish roasted barley combined with chocolate malt dominate the aroma... dark caramel malt sweetness is intially subdued but becomes more assertive as the brew warms.  Fruity esters are completely absent.  The flavor is an appropriate extension of the aroma, although w/ a more prominent malt sweetness.  An initial snap of roasted barley bitterness gives way to sugary caramel, then moderate hop bitterness and chocolate malt emerge, lending a bittersweet dark chocolate character mid palate.  Light in body for style, but with sufficient dextrins for a smooth mouthfeel.  Finishes somewhat dry, w/ roasted grain bitterness lingering.  Colony is an enjoyable oatmeal stout, but doesn't possess any outstanding qualities.  Although it lacks the "silky" quality of a good OS, the drinkability remains good.","marc77","Sep 05, 2002"
3.83,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Thinnish (once again, Millstream) in the mouth. What presents itself is smooth and silky. Boost the body of this just a little, and it is a very, very solid oatmeal stout. Above average as it is. Easily consumed.","cokes","Aug 27, 2002"
3.82,2.7,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Low carbonation and head as expected, nice and chewy with a chocolate/coffee flavor.  Smooth throughout with the malt and hops balanced.  I see why it is brewed year-round.","jdhilt","Aug 12, 2002"
4.2,12.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Black and creamy looking, this beer also smelled wonderful.  I thought I could smell the oatmeal.  Smooth ,velvelty and somewhat sweet, this beer was quite nice.  It has an understated richness, but with enough hop presence to not make this too cloying.  I very much enjoyed this brew, even in the summer.","AaronRed","Aug 04, 2002"
3.58,-3.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Notes: Very drinkable and quite clean ... not your usual over roasted character found in a lot of oatmeal stouts, just good easy drinking. Goes perfect with any kind of chocolate.","Jason","Jun 14, 2002"
