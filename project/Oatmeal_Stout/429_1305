3.9,4.8,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 5/12/2015. Pours clear nearly opaque dark brown color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, molasses, toast, brown bread, light smoke, light dark fruit, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted/bready malt and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, molasses, toast, brown bread, light smoke, light dark fruit, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Light herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, molasses, toast, brown bread, light smoke/dark fruit, and herbal/roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/roasted/bready malt and light earthy hop flavors; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth and moderately creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice oatmeal stout style. All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/roasted/bready malt and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 08, 2015"

3.95,6.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall : hey, it's not bad, in fact I'd put it amongst the top ten or maybe five stouts ive tried. Better than most oatmeal stouts I've had. I recommend it, perhaps Alaskan is better at their darker beers.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Jan 11, 2015"
3.49,-6.2,3.5,3.75,3.25,3.75,3.5,"Chocolately nose, mild apple-like acidity, mildly sweet maltiness balances the roasted character. In the end the acidity and fairly mild roast character threw me off a little, although I did like the sweetness and the overall range of flavors.","maedhros09","Dec 29, 2014"
