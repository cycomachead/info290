3.68,5.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 12/10/2014. Pours crystal clear very dark brown color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of milk chocolate, caramel, cocoa, toasted oats, light coffee, brown bread, herbal, floral, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted/bready malt and moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of milk chocolate, caramel, cocoa, toasted oats, light coffee, brown bread, herbal, floral, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Light herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, caramel, cocoa, toasted oats, light coffee, brown bread, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and complexity of dark/roasted/bready malt and moderate earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice oatmeal stout style. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted/bready malt and moderate earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and easy to drink. Not as bold as some other oatmeal stouts; but still very well rounded and nicely enjoyable in flavors.","superspak","Nov 27, 2014"
