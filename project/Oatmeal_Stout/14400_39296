4.09,4.1,3.75,4,4.25,4,4,"Great roasty aroma. Nice brown head. Isn't as black as I prefer but has a nice dark color. Incredibly smooth. Bigger end of a medium body. Tastes pretty dam good.","RenzoD","Mar 13, 2015"

3.18,-19.1,3.5,3,3.25,3,3.25,"Basic stout appearance, dark brown-black, translucent around the edges, with a thin off-white head. Roasty aroma. Not much else to say there. In the taste, dark roasty malts, cacao, underlying milky sweetness, hints of anise. Body was a bit on the weak side for a stout, especially an oatmeal stout. This might make for a good nitro beer, but as is, it didn't do too much for me.","Rifugium","Feb 28, 2015"

3.72,-5.3,4,3.75,3.75,3.25,3.75,"O: Some inconsistencies, not really smooth.  Takes you on a journey, but its more like a dark cold road than pleasant meadows.  It grows on you though, and is nice in the end.  Bought and drank in Chiang Mai, Feb 24th, 2015.","patre_tim",
