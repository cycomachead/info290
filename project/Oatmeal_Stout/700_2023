4.04,0.2,4.5,4.25,4,3.5,4,"Overall: This is a pretty good oatmeal stout, but it does have its flaws. I thought the nose was great, but the taste doesnt quite live up to it. Mostly a subtle chocolatey, hop bite. I also feel that the finish is a bit too bitter for this style. Its still solid and worth the $6 i paid for the bomber, but probably won't go for it again","Bone53","Feb 15, 2015"

3.79,-6,4,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Decent low-key stout. The bone dry finish almost recalls a dark lager, although there is some complexity in the ashy/dry versus sweet contrast.","CalgaryFMC","Feb 12, 2015"

3.76,-6.7,4.25,3.75,3.75,4,3.5,"On tap. Pours very dark with a thing,brown head. Aroma is of medium intensity. Roast and mild char. Not very sweet smelling. The flavor is a match to the beer's scent. Low in sweetness. Roast, bittering dark malt, and chocolate. Finished with another layer of hop/bitter. A Stout that leans away from sweetness according to my palate. Body is fairly full. Higher carbonation. Could stand for some more sweet balance.","VelvetExtract","Feb 06, 2015"
