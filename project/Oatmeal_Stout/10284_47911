3.08,-21.6,4,3.5,2.75,3,3,"Bottle.  Started at 54 degrees.  Dark, dark brown to black, nice medium tan/camel foamy head with some staying power; smell is malt, slight oats.  Something dark and well-roasted, as it warms.  Taste is straight forward at first, nothing distinguished, no chocolate, sweetness or even heavy oats, but then gives way to a rising bitterness that just lays there persisting on the tongue.  Maybe the beer is turning bad, but it smells ok.  Maybe it's just not my cup of tea.  I think it is just a burnt/bitter, slightly acidic taste. Mouthfeel is light to medium but finished thin on the tongue, giving way to that bitterness that lingers (oh yeah, I already covered that part).  I could say something predictably silly, like, "it's a crime to recommend Convict Hill" but that would be pushing the rules and there are many raters who seem to like it well enough.","marieli","Mar 06, 2015"
