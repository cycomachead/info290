3.91,1.3,3.5,3.75,4,4,4,"Notes: Black-brown dark mahogany body with ruby highlights. The creamy dark tan head drops to an average collar with minimal spotty and streaky lacing. Medium bodied with a median carbonation level = smooth and almost creamy. Chocolate/fudge and strong golden caramel and toffee notes greet you in the nose. The flavor adds a bit more nuttiness and some yeasty fruitiness to the mix. Leafy and grassy hops add balance along with a solid bitterness. Richly flavorful and satisfying without being overly malty or full bodied. Drinkable, and (bonus!) fairly inexpensive.","NeroFiddled","Jan 23, 2015"
