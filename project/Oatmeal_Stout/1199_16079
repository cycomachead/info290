If nothing else to reaffirm that nitro is such a waist of good beer.  Maybe there is an actual oatmeal stout lingering somewhere?  I can't tell however, cause there is no character at all.","champ103","Jan 24, 2015"

One of my go-to beers when I'm at Founder's Brewery, but I dont think I've ever bought this in bottled form.","jasonpeckins32","Dec 29, 2014"
