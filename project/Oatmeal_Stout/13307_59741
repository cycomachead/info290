4.06,6.3,3.75,4,4.25,3.75,4,"Smoke actually doesn’t have the biggest influence on the palate, but it is recognizable in an enjoyable interaction with the malts, adding an unusal flavor to this great beer. Arguing from the perspective of loving a typical Bamberg smoked beer, this smoked stout entirely lacks the characteristic hints of saltiness. It is even more astonishing that it doesn’t need those, because of the complex coffee flavor, which stays in balance due to the malty smokiness - enough complexity is established in a different way, than they do it in Bamberg. The coffee flavor of this beer might already be enough to make this great, as it is very smooth, almost creamy, intense flavoured, and changes its taste on the palate during the tasting process.","aleigator","Jan 07, 2015"
4.14,8.4,4,4.25,4.25,3.75,4,"Intensely smoked.  Lots of wood, peat, pork and bacon flavor.  Moderate roasted malt and coffee blends well with the smoky notes.  Well balanced overall.  One of the better smoked beers I've had.","bnes09","Jan 01, 2015"
