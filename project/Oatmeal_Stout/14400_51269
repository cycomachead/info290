3.9,1.3,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,4,"Body may be on the light side, and the expected smoothness and creamy texture is present yet uneven. No real matter. The flavors manage to carry all the weight. Moderate carbonation. Finish is dry and roasty, a little earthy and astringent. Some mouthfeel issues notwithstanding, this is a tasty stout well worth sampling. Great ester presence and the roasted elements are balanced out nicely by some sweet special effects. Down with disease.","CalgaryFMC","Mar 16, 2015"
