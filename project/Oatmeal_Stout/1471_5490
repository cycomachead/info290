3.87,3.2,4,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"This has a nice dark pour with a brown head to it.  Immediately I could pick up the aromas of chocolate and coffee.  The taste was very strong, tasted of roasted malts and coffee with hints of chocolate.  The finish was a little on the bitter and smoky side.  Left my mouth feeling a little dry.  Not a bad brew, but I prefer others in the Dark Horse series.","JPowell712","Mar 12, 2015"

3.31,-11.7,4,3.5,3,2.75,3.75,"12oz bottle poured into stout chalice. Black and opaque with a two finger tan head that leaves a little lacing. Aroma is molasses, cocoa, coffee, and roasted malt. Taste is bittersweet chocolate, coffee, malt, and chicory bitterness. Medium body, thin texture, lively carbonation for a stout, and an astringent finish.","SierraFlight","Feb 16, 2015"
