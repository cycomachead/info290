3.79,-1,3.75,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Pours a clear, deep brown having a garnet hue at the edges when held to the light, producing 2+ fingers of tan, shortlived, foamy head that leaves a stringy wash of thin lace. Aroma is led by rich dark coffee followed closely by deeply roasted malt & nuts in a background that hints of woody vanilla, chocolate, molasses & a faint touch of dark fruit. Taste is less robust than the nose: coffee & roast, dark malts, hints of char, dark unsweetened cocoa & cola. The lightly dry finish exhibits char, unsweetened cocoa & low cola like sweetness. Aftertaste is dry, bitter chocolate, roast & a more exaggerated burnt note than in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, low-moderate carbonation, creamy but not as chewy as expected from the oats, with a light prickly bite beginning at midsip and lasting through the finish.","mothmanscott","Mar 02, 2015"
