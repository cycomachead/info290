The aroma is of dark roasted malts with some fresh roasted and ground coffee beans. Very nice. The taste is pretty much the same with a nice flavor of coffee that is not strong or overpowering like some coffee stouts I have tried. Very smooth and goes down easy. No strong, no bitter and no harsh aftertaste at all. A great Coffee Stout! Medium-bodied with lower carbonation.","BeerWithMike","Mar 19, 2015"

4.09,6.2,3.75,4,4.25,4,4,"Black in color with a thick tan head (caffe crema?).  The smell is intensely espresso.  Coffee beans...highly roasted...some background roasted barley and malt, but the coffee is in front.  The taste is similar...coffee, with a stout bitterness and a lot of creamy mouthfeel.  This is an excellent brew.","Suds","Feb 15, 2015"

3.92,1.8,3.75,4.25,3.75,3.75,4,"Poured into a snifter.  Color was dark brown but not quite opaque.  It rather resembled coffee.  Very light milk-colored head.  Strong smell of coffee.  Very strong taste of burnt coffee but lacked other, complimentary flavors.  Starts strong but finishes rather weak.  It could have used some chocolate. Very light carbonation.  Not a bad stout but cannot be compared to, say, Founders Breakfast Stout.","MacMalt","Feb 08, 2015"
