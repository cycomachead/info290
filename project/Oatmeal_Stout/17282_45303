3.98,-3.2,4.25,3.75,4,4.25,4,"Excellent balance of black coffee with black malts, each jumps out while neither dominates. The coffee is a heavy roast, and the big bitterness plays well. There's a subtle,  bready caramel undertone. But dark chocolate and roasted beans are the big flavors.","tempest","Feb 09, 2015"

4.03,-1.9,4,3.5,4.25,4,4.25,"The flavor does not have that strange flaw really, but instead has light roasted malt, cocoa, and lots of great stiff espresso coffee flavor. A really well integrated coffee beer, albeit on the lighter side of robust qualities at 6%.","dar482","Jan 30, 2015"

4.18,1.7,4.5,4,4.25,4,4.25,"O - A very good beer.  Definitely an upfront coffee flavor but the coffee allows some other flavors room to breath.  A real nice stout.","SammyJaxxxx","Jan 12, 2015"
