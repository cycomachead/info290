Pours an inky black with a loose, 1/8th inch khaki-colored head that quickly disperses towards the edges leaving a residual sudsy slick across the center.  Nose expresses a light roasty presence, a suggestion of artificial sweetener and perhaps a hint of cherry juice.  Taste follows nose - cherry quality is more apparent; however, the flavor profile is missing the roasty/chocolately character I've come to associate with the style.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light) with a carbonation slightly too assertive for the style and a feint acidity most likely attributable to the cherries.  Overall, a bit lacking - not enough roast or flaked oats presence and the texture could have been creamier.","Jwale73","Feb 09, 2015"

The color is jet black—a really nice looking beer. The aroma is a bit subdued, consisting mainly of toasted malt with a hint of raisin. The taste is outstanding and smooth.  The predominant flavors are that of oats, dark chocolate, toasted malt, finishing with a slight malty sweetness. The really is a good balance of flavors.  The beer has a medium to light body with a modest amount of carbonation.  Overall, one of the better Oatmeal Stouts I’ve had.","thomda11","Aug 23, 2014"

Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, oats, dark bread, caramel, light coffee, light herbal, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and oat notes; with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, dark bread, toast, oats, caramel, light coffee, light herbal, and roasted earthiness. Light herbal/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roast, dark bread, toast, oats, caramel, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, oats, and light hop flavors; with great robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy, smooth, and lightly slick/bready moutfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent oatmeal stout. All around great balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/roasted malt and oat flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 30, 2014"

The aroma is of malt, coffee and hints of toffee; its very fragrant and I found myself simply enjoying the scent. This stout drinks with the freshness and smoothness of the finest ales, it's flavorful and refreshing which is unusual in a stout. Very smooth and light on the stomach, I tasted a rich maltiness, subtle coffee and chocolate notes. I am so impressed with this stout and rank it amongst the very best ales I've experienced.","KYGunner","Nov 20, 2012"

Nose is a 1-2 punch of milk chocolate and roast; it's straightforward yet pleasingly intense and inviting. As a minor complaint, it's a touch thin at the swallow in spite of the smoothness imparted by the oatmeal. Pretty much everything else is spot on, though. A bit of milk chocolate midswallow, but this is more about darker and sharper roasted flavors, which work well with the citric hop bite. Lengthy and satisfying dry finish. This is definitely one of those "I totally forgot how tasty this was" brews.","PDXHops","Oct 09, 2012"

The head retains well and leaves some lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma is roasty sweet from the malt and there are smells of coffee and chocolate as well. I can detect some oats as well. The taste follows the nose. There are flavors of dark roasted barley malt, mild bitter coffee, bitter chocolate, and some mild hops. The flavors are creamy and mildly sweet. The body is medium with a creamy mouthfeel. It is smooth and the carbonation is moderate. The drinkability is very high. Overall, this is an excellent beer.

I had a lot of deep-tan/light-brown head initially, but it finally settled into a thick finger. Color was a deep, dark-brown with limited light penetration except at the edges. Nose smelled of coffee, dark chocolate and charcoal/wood smoke. Mouthfeel was on the thin side for a stout and it had a taste like fudge - dark, rich, smoky. Finish was equally fudgy and I probably would not want more than one, being that I am self-avowed hophead.","woodychandler","May 28, 2012"

Taste is much the same, and the mouthfeel is pretty thick and smooth, as an oatmeal stout should be. Nothing here that knocks my socks off, but definitely not a thing wrong with it either.

In a way I give it points for English restraint despite its American pedigree, but in another way I really wanted it to open up and give me more.

What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and the mouthfeel they were both very good. What I liked least about this beer was the higher amount of sweetness, if that was toned down a little this be would pretty much be perfect. I would for sure buy this again when looking for a good priced and sessionable Oatmeal Stout, and I recommend in to anyone who enjoys the style.

Aroma is malt, roast, cocoa, hint vanilla. Flavor's like nose with just right carbonic tang and some bitterness that all balance just right. Body is full and carbonation is exactly right.

The flavor follows the aroma nicely- the roasted grains taste nice and rich. There is a subtle undertone of floral hops as well. Oats and chocolate really come out in the finish. The mouth feel is not nearly as thick as one might expect - a few points off for that in my book. Maybe Imperials have me spoiled...

The fruit character tastes yeast-derived. There's a mild sweetness, rather sugary on the mid-palate, that seems strange. Drying on the finish with a blend of robust roasty bitterness, a blend of oatmeal and coffee, this beer is medium-light in body and moderately carbonated. Not the slickest oatmeal stout I've had, I find the carbonation a little higher than it needs to be, lending a mild acidity to the finish. Still, this is an excellent beer, and one that I will attempt to drink more often.","DefenCorps","Nov 08, 2011"

Taste follows suit with no one component being the star here, moderate roast, bitter chocolate stronger than other flavors, but not over the top. Medium bodied, lightly earthy and grainy but smooth. A very nice traditional style stout which doesn't overdo any particular component and thus becomes highly drinkable.","rfgetz","Oct 17, 2011"
4,-1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Revisiting this beer to see how my perception of it has changed (if at all). It pours a seemingly straight onyx topped by over a finger of light brown foam. The nose comprises toasted biscuit, light roasted malts, toffee, toasted oats, and a few sprinkles of cocoa for good measure. The taste brings in more of the same, with the cocoa playing a stronger role, the roast darkening, and some light coffee coming into the mix as well. The body is a light-feeling medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth, creamy feel. It seems a bit light and thin, but the creaminess (present in every AV beer I've had thus far) makes up for it, and then some. Overall, a very nice oatmeal stout. The thinness holds it back some, but it remains an enjoyable drink.","TMoney2591","Oct 15, 2011"

The oatmeal comes in nicely, along with some milk chocolate, caramel malts, and roasted coffee. There's also a touch of nuttiness on the finish. It's nothing unique, but refined to perfection.

3.77,-7.1,3.5,4,4,3,3.5,"Barney Flats pours a typical stout black. The tan foam topping the beer is a shade or two lighter than normal, and comes up to a little bit over 3 fingers in height. It fades a little on the quick side, and aside from a solid ring at the head's apex. The beer almost smells sweet like a milk stout. There's some dark chocolate and some citrusy hops, it almost smalls like a chocolate covered orange peel. The aroma is a touch weak overall though. The flavor has the same general structure as the nose, but it's more bitter dark chocolate and a bit less citrusy. The mouthfeel is a bit of a letdown, given that it's one of the things I look forward to most in a good oatmeal stout. The carbonation is spot on understated. The body though is neither full and rich, nor silky smooth enough to compete with top notch oatmeal stout. All in all I enjoyed my glass of Barney Flats, but given the choice I don't think I'd ever grab this over other beers like Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout or Velvet Merlin.","axeman9182","Jun 18, 2011"

A rich and sweet oaty aroma from the malts partnered with a supporting chocolate. Absolutely beautiful. Overall, I'd say this falls into the sweeter side of oatmeal stouts. Starts off sweet with some cocoa and coffee flavor, middle you get the characteristic oaty flavor, and finishes off with a great roastiness. A wonderful moutfeel to this; velvet, creamy, and medium bodied. Simply a great oatmeal stout, my biggest complaint is that it isn't more readily available here in Denver. This should be a staple in every liquor store.","denver10","May 12, 2011"

I was expecting a huge oatmeal push like Founders Breakfast Stout but I shouldn't be comparing this to founders BS.

If a stout for breakfast isn't up your alley (understandable), have breakfast for dinner, or try it with spicy chicken and cheese enchiladas (with an egg on top!?). The creaminess and the oatmeal will help to mellow out the spice. It would also pair really well with a blue cheese such as the Colston-Bassett Stilton that is in season for the winter.

Very roasty, with hints of oatmeal, vanilla, caramel, chocolate and butter. Flavor is not as intense as I hoped, but not really bad: coffee, sweet malt and enough hops to balance out what the roasted grains do not. Some chalky-mineral-like quality in the finish. Mouthfeel is too thin and gassy. Overall impression: delivers an intense yet superior look and smell with a less-impressive yet solid flavor, finish and feel. One of the easier-drinking oatmeal dark ales I've tasted. I think they should increase the grain bill, maybe add some more base malt to boost the gravity and add roasted barley--something not mentioned on the ingredient list on the label. Is that an oversight? If it really has no roasted, non-malted barley, shouldn't it be called an oatmeal "porter"?","EagleTalon","May 15, 2010"

The smell is great it smelled like candy. The mouth feel was hearty and covers the tongue, it fells like how a stout should feel. The taste could have scored higher but I probably just had my expectations a little high. It doesn't taste bad by any means its good and would do well with a desert.

Full-bodied, the high level of carbonation plus the overall lack of sugariness relieves a lot of downward pressure. Not that if "lifts" per se, but forward movement is not a problem. Flavorwise, the roasted coffee, heavy cream, dark chocolate, toffee, oatmeal elements charge right up on you. Taking this into consideration, isn't malty in an obvious way.

Oats bring the sweetness to the palate along with dark chocolate. Very light roasty bitterness follows.

The hops hang around in the background nicely balancing the character without announcing their presence unless you look for them.

Almost as dark as Victory's Storm King I delved into when I jumped the gun 30 or so days ago but really, I don't recall ever seeing something as dark as those. Colorwise it's right on hue with any previous oatmeal stout I've tried and a peanut butter colored head that faded fairly fast. A very roasted scent reminding me of an ealy winter bonfire. Warm and mellow caramel, oats and coffee flavor on the front end. Like breakfast on a cold morning where ya need something to warm your bones before you go outside to dig the car out of 8 inches of snow because even though the kids got a snowday ya have to go to work. Granted, one has to wait to the workday is done and the chillun' are in bed before relaxing with a laid back yet hearty brew but this one is a great reward.

Taste isn't dominated by the oatmeal though; chocolate, burnt caramel, a little charcoal, followed by the solid oatmeal aftertaste. It's good to see a beer deliver taste as described on its label.

Hops actually appear quite a bit in the aftertaste, somewhat bitter. Mouthfeel is full bodied, smooth, creamy, with a low to medium carbonation.

The mouth is fairly heavy, and the low carbonation affords it an elegant smoothness. This is a fun oatey, not too complex, but very tasty.","mjc410","Sep 27, 2006"

Nice lacing left throughout. Aromas have a roasted chocolate malt flavor and bit of sweet dried fruit. Flavors are heavy on the roasted chocolate and coffee end, with a nice balance of hop bitterness up front that then gets blasted by the deep roasted malt characters, a bit of earthy, bready grain flavor is also present on the back end. Overall a great stout with a thick, creamy mouthfeel and just smooth, smooth, smooth...outstanding.","sockeye101","Sep 18, 2006"

Palate is nice and rich - roasted malt, lactose and oatmeal sweetness, and just a mild hoppy bitterness towards the finish. Body is rich, smooth, and creamy - just wonderful.

The chocolate and coffee flavors shine through. As the taste lingers in your mouth, however, it is taken over by its rather sweet qualities. This is quite enjoyable. The mouthfeel is nicely thick.

A slight tinge of alcohol as well. Taste is very surprising and refreshing for a west coast stout. Too many these days try to knock-you-off-your-feet with HUGE flavor, but this really appreciates the finer subtleties of taste. The dark grains leave a lingering taste in the mouth that is both sweet and bitter (sweet towards the middle of the tongue, bitter on the sides).

The brew carries a nice thickness, but remains smooth with nice carbonation. It was easy to drink, although the flavor could have been a touch sweeter.

I have had this beer several times over the years and right now, it's not coming off as dry and sharp as I remember. This is not a bad thing, mind you. Comparing Barney Flats to the classic stout, Guinness, this is more malty, nowhere near as dry, less roasty-bitter and more fun to drink, nitrogen slow-pour be damned.

Tastes even better. Silky smooth chocolate and roasted malt. Just enough coffe flavors to give it some testicles. The oats really milds the flavors and texture.

Smell is thick and ripe, big coffee, chocolate and roasted malt overtones with hints of dark fruit and molasses. Taste matches the aroma well, big coffee, dark chocolate and roasted flavors come through with a dark currant background and a light molasses flavor. The mouthfeel is thick and very smooth, a nice oatmeal stout for sure, the finish is slightly sweet and lingering.

Real smooth medium mouthfeel, lighter and not as thick as most stouts. Definate plus. And as a result of the more medium mouthfeel and texture it's less filling and super drinkable. I actually finished the whole sixer last night. I meant to save half for the Red Sox opener tonight, oops.

The taste is very nice, roasted malts and chocolate are the first thing that I notice with highlight of caramel and coffee. Also notice the up front tastes breaking to a hop-ness that goes well with this brew. Not the best oatmeal stout or even stout I have had but a solid offering.","Stimack","Mar 20, 2005"

Malty with a good coffee flavor. It is rather creamy. It coats the inside of my mouth with a creamy, sweet layer. It goes down smooth. Good carbonation. This beer would make an excelent session beer because it is low in alcohol. Also, the flavor is not overly aggressive, but it is not too bland. If you see this beer, you should at least try it. I will buy it again. Good oatmeal stout.","OStrungT","Mar 11, 2005"

Lots of creamy caramel and chocolate flavors, buttery and bitter-sweet. Notes of dark, pit-fruits, creme-brule, figs, and raisens. There's the requisite oatmeal creaminess and texture.

Roasty assault up-front, followed with a mellow malt smoothness that's enriched with clean flavors of oat and finishes off with the combination of drying hop bitterness and the bitterness of scorched malts. Mainly sweet, overall, but dry enough in the finish that it makes it drinkable.

(Disclaimer--I have, with previous servings, encountered rich, billowing heads on this beer that really make for a handsome sight.) Color is near opaque black, but the tiniest of ebony highlights are in fact there. And then--chocolate syrup and malted milk flood the nose! with a nosefeel of light, frothy cream--Milk Duds! Somehow, it doesn't cross the line into cloying, because halfway through, these aromas turn raisiny as delicate bitternesses of hops and roast coffee come to weigh in against the extravagant chocolate and malt. More chocolate-covered raisin flavors up front become a bit smokier and more bitter at point of swallow, with a bit more hop in the aftertaste, softly. Where's the oatmeal, you ask? Patience... for with time and warmth, the flavors almost... "settle" into oat, dark bread, even a bit of peanut. Quite a smooth transition between these elements. Mouthfeel is lightly milky with a good deal of carbonation, but less chewy/mealy than some other Oatmeal Stouts. This is quenchy rather than coating, with a less residual character. However, this boosts the drinkability. I can (and did) spend the first bottle exploring and the next five bottles quaffing!

The head that was produced was a light to medium brown color, that was pretty dense and thick. You could stick your finger in it and have a small peak present. It was sticky and full, as well as the lace that was formed, when dried on the sides it had to be scrapped off the glass. The aromas that came from the glass were of roasted and sweet malt, oatmeal and oat grain, black coffee, toffee and chocolate. The taste that was dancing across my tongue were of roasted malts and coffees, light hops (which I swear were toasted) were on the bitter side, sweet chocolates, oat grains, and it ended with a combination of sugar coffee (black), some cocoa, and more roasted flavors which was dry in the finish. The aftertaste was mostly of a roasted grain and coffee. The body was on the heavy side, and very enjoyable. The mix of sweetness, roastiness and dryness was very pleasing. It was creamy on the tongue and quite smooth and easy going down. I like the way they combined the coffee, the chocolate flavors and the light oatmeal flavors to create this enjoyable beer. Very drinkable for the season.","Jarod","Jan 21, 2004"

Flavor is creamy and sweet from the get-go, which is just how I like my Oatmeal Stouts. The coffee and chocolate flavor had a nice light hops and raisin finish to balance it out. Not the best Stout I have had but it is definitely up there, and is not very expensive either.","Dogbrick","Nov 13, 2002"
4.07,0.2,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Dark brew with mahogany highlights that pours with a decent tan head.  The head slowly fades to leave a ring around the top of the beer with a nice trailing lace on the glass sides.  The aroma is one of roasted coffee and sweetness, with a slight hint of alcohol.   The mouthfeel is light for a stout, but very smooth.  The flavors are very good in this beer.  Coffee, roasted malt, chocolate, a little fruitness, and a hint of nuttiness make this a really complex beer that is topped off with a good dose of hops.    I believe the hops help create the relatively clean finish.  The flavor develops very well as the beer warms.  This is a very good beer that could be great, but it lacks the "chewy" mouthfeel that many good stouts present.","aaronh","Nov 11, 2002"

4,-1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"First time I have had this since becoming an advocate. I like AVBC beers so I thought I'd try it again.   Very dark with a malted milk ball colored head (inside filling) Head stayed pretty well but lace was only sparse.  Smell was mellow and sweetish.  First sip was very roasty and burnt toast like. As the glass was drained the taste smoothed out a bit.  Good solid oatmeal stout from one of my favorite domestic breweries.","Mark","Nov 10, 2002"
2.95,-27.3,5,2.5,3,3.5,2.5,"As they say on the bottle "recommend as a nightcap."  I could prob drink a few but certainly not a session beer as I like in most oatmeal stouts.","RBorsato","Oct 08, 2002"
4.33,6.7,4.5,4,4,5,5,"Black with creamed coffee-colored head. Nose is shy with notes of fresh roasted almonds, hazelnuts and chocolate. The deal with this beer is that it is so velvety smooth while it delivers subtle layers of coffee, nuts, cocoa, blueberry and eggplant flavors. Liquid velvet I tells ya. Nothing exotic, but then again, a stout is prose, not poetry. Drink more than one.","putnam","Oct 05, 2002"
3.9,-3.9,4,4,4,4,3.5,"A really dark black beer, just about opaque. Thick brown-tan colored head, which only started to form half-way through the pour. Huge head at first, but it does not last long and soon settles down, then dissipates completeley - leaving almost no lace at all on the glass sides. Massive roasted malt tastes explode in the mouth, with a hint of coffee, burnt caramel and some whisps of chocolate. But the burnt caramel and roast tastes are far from pervasive, which is good, and soon make way for a nice roasted bittersweet finish. Lovely rich dark stout with a well-balanced roast and hop character. This beer gets better as it warms up. One of the best US Oatmeal Stouts I have tried to date. I will definitely buy this again, but next time let it warm up a bit more before supping it !!!","TheLongBeachBum","Sep 25, 2002"
4.37,7.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"It pours black, with a tan brown head that works its way up the glass.  It smells roasty with a good nose full of hops.  The strong roasted flavor also comes through nicely but doesn't overpower the hops.  It has a great, chunky mouthfeel.","mickeymac","Sep 05, 2002"
3.66,-9.9,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This beer poured almost pitch black with no light getting through it.  The head was a bubbly dark tan that subsided quickly and left little lace.  Very little aroma present, with hints of malt and coffee.  The flavor was of malt, coffee and chocolate.  The body was a bit light for a porter.  The finish had a bit of a sour aspect, but nothing to ruin the beer.  An alright oatmeal stout, but for price, I think Goose Island does a better job and of course it can't touch a Samuel Smith's.","Wildman","Aug 01, 2002"
3.53,-13.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This is definitely worth a try if you haven't already.  The head is a very dark tan which is always appealing to me.  The taste is fairly uniform throughout the entire pint-Oats.  Some may describe this as simple or mediocre but I enjoy that in a beer if the taste is good.  Not my favorite of Anderson Valley but definitely a good choice.","Maestro","Jul 03, 2002"
2.5,-38.4,3,3,2,2,3,"After one taste, (maybe two), I poured the other two bottles down the drain. For sure I promise not to rate any Anderson Valley Beers. Because I'll never buy another one of there beers again. Five tasted and not one rated above 2 (average).","BeerManDan","Jun 28, 2002"
4.05,-0.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a deep dark brown/black that doesn't let any light in and a nice creamy brownish head.  The smell is roasted malt and oats.  The flavor starts off with the roasteds but then goes through oatmeal, coffee, chocolate, and more roasted.  The brew is nice and creamy across the tongue and highly drinkable.  Yet another very good beer from Anderson Valley.  I haven't had anything from this brewery that wasn't great.","Murph","Apr 21, 2002"
4.43,9.1,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Pours a thick brown head. Opaque appearance. Smell is roasty and a bit sweet. Very creamy mouthfeel. Velvet-like. Coffee tones present on tongue. Bittersweet chocolate and toffee also present. Sticky sweet tobacco. A nice lingering bitterness. Very well put together Oatmeal Stout. One of my favorites.","Bighuge","Mar 22, 2002"
3.88,-4.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"No doubt this is an oatmeal stout, strong roasted malt flavor.  Black, thick and chewy, very smooth and creamy.  The ABV is 5.7%.","jdhilt","Feb 15, 2002"
4.37,7.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Hard to lay down $9-10 for this one though it is worth it. This is a kick ass stout with a long roasted finish.","Jason","Jan 25, 2002"
4.97,22.4,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Beautiful!  This brew is absolutely delicious.  Superb silk texture.  Strong roasted malt, cappucinno.  Potent roasted malts on the nose.  Super dark brown head, with a tint of peach.  Anderson Valley Brewing Co. hasn't failed me yet.  Excellent craftsman.","Jordan","Jan 21, 2002"
4.84,19.2,4,5,5,4,5,"Yeah, this is an all-timer. Pour it in a cognac glass to get the full effect My beer is bigger than your beer type of bragging rights. The oats! Roasted oats are yum-yum good. Big warm fuzzy beer that you just want to curl up with. The smell alone will drive 'em crazy. Always reliable, always on, always a joy to drink. And I don't even really like stouts...","jonnylieberman","Nov 04, 2001"
4.76,17.2,5,4,5,5,5,"One of the great Oatmeal Stouts.  Sweet, yet doesn't fade.","AaronRed","Oct 06, 2001"
4.7,15.8,4,4,5,5,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this oatmeal stout. Very robust, complex, extremely flavourful and textured. In a market of wimpy and nitro'd stouts, this one stands out. However, the $9.99 a 6-pak price tag stood out the most. As much as I liked it, I would not drop that kind of money a second time.","Todd","Aug 06, 2001"
4.06,0,5,4,4,4,4,"The sweetness and hops of this stout seemed more like a strong porter, but overall it was well done.","Brent","Apr 25, 2001"
