4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer is dark brown with a small tan head. The aroma is roasty, with notes of coffee and chocolate. Nice tasting beer. Light and simple. Easy drinking. A touch of hop bitterness in the finish. Well balanced. This is a nice brew that I wouldn't mind drinking again.","Huhzubendah","Jun 20, 2012"
