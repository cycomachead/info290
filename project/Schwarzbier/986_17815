3.74,6.6,3.75,4,3.75,3.5,3.5,"Pours opaque black with minimal head. The aroma has a nice deep and dry roasted barley note followed up by notes of pumpernickel and dry lager yeast. Taste starts with a neutral malt flavor and quickly becomes intensely roasty. The roasted notes bring on smokey flavors towards the end. Finish is clean and dry. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated with a light to medium body. Overall, lots of flavor packed into this, but it was a bit one note. Would have nice to have a little more depth to all of the roast.","homebrew311","Sep 25, 2013"

Color was a deep, dark-brown allowing light penetration only near the top of the glass. It was as deeply dark as Rader's heart must have been to commit such atrocities. Nose was rich with a smoky chocolate scent, like a liquid dark chocolate bar. Mouthfeel was medium and the chocolate taste even more pronounced on the tongue than it had been on the nose! Understated hops? More like unspoken. This was very sweet, especially on the finish and between that and its > 4% ABV, I would not find it "sessionable". Hey, that was their claim, not mine. Stylistically, I have no problem with it, but the style is just not my cuppa meat, dig?","woodychandler","Jul 05, 2013"

Though all of the characteristics of something great are here, they're so subtle that the beer might teeter on the edge of blandness.","Dmart1223","Jan 09, 2013"

3.75,6.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours a black color. 1/4 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of roasted malt, coffee, sweet malt, and slight oatmeal. Fits the style of a Schwarzbier. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of slight earthy malt, roasted malt, slight coffee, and a hint of sweet malt. Overall, decent appearance, good body, and good feel.","Tone","Oct 13, 2011"
3.83,9.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Good schwarzbier. Poured brownish-black with a moderate tan head. Dark roasted malts in the nose, caramel and dark chocolate. Similar taste, with big roasty malts, licorice, and some cocoa bitterness. Smooth and silky, not quite full-bodied, and very drinkable.","Rifugium","Aug 17, 2011"
3.55,1.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours an almost opaque dark brown color with a 1/2 inch beige head that fades to a thin cap. Random legs of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smells malt/biscuit, some fruitiness, and a slightly smoky aroma. Taste is exactly like the smell. This beer has a high level of carbonation which makes for a very crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer and the first of the style I have ever had. My first beer from Wynkoop.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 15, 2011"
3.33,-5.1,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Nice dark lager, not opaque but certainly quite dark. Not too much lasting head. Dark brown amber highlights to light. Smell is clean, dark malts, coffee notes, hint of spice, like caraway or cinnamon. Taste is of smokey charcoal, slightly sweet dark malts, some balancing hops. Clean finish. Thin in tastes, a little metallic. Not great, but certainly drinkable.","SamN","Feb 26, 2011"

Not a complex flavor or aroma - mostly hops in there. Flavors of hops linger just a bit, then fade. Light carbonation, good for sipping.
