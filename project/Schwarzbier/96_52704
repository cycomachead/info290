3.72,1.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"A black lager. Pours, well, black, medium size bubbles a little lacing. Smell of molasses cocao, reminds me of a porter. Taste is much the same, strong chocolate and molasses tones, a bit of tobacco too. Leaves a clean aftertaste, fades quickly, very light mouthfeel for what it is. How light its mouthfeel is almost reminds me of an oatmeal beer, like The Poet, though this is a bit sharper. Solid beer for what it is, though a little underwhelmed overall.","srv33","Jun 29, 2012"

Tan head bubbles up nicely, but dissipates quickly. In spite of being a winter lager, it seems a bit musty in the nose. Some nice roast malt, mineral, light off spice. Roast continues in the mouth, but lacks depth or a layered dimension to the taste and is a bit light and tasteless off the back.

4,9.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought that this was a good and solid Schwarzbier that managed to stick out from the crowd with some added nutty flavors and aromas that made it one of the more complex Schwarzbier's I have had to date. This beer has good drinkability, it has enough flavor to hold my attention, while going down very smooth and not being too filling, if I had another one I would drink it, I could maybe do four of these in a session without getting bored with it. What I liked most about this beer was pretty much everything, all aspects of this beer seemed to be right where they should be. There wasn't anything about this beer that I didn't like or would change, this beer doesn't need to messed with. I would buy this beer again when looking for a nice and sessionable Black Lager, this makes for a good darker beer to have with dinner and it paired nicely with a bowl of chili. I recommend giving this beer a try, the extra nutty flavors make this not your average Black Lager. I was impressed by this beer, I don't have the best history with Magic Hat beers, but this proved to be one solid Schwarzbier that proved to be pretty unique with the added nutty flavors, I know this beer isn't a traditional take on this style, but it comes together nicely and tastes good so I'm not holding that against them. IF you are leery about giving Magic Hat another try, man up and try this beer, it might change your mind about this brewery. This isn't my favorite Schwarzbier but it is one of the better and more unique ones that I have had.","StoutHunter","Jan 05, 2012"

Smell is luscious with roasted grains, cocoa, coffee, burnt caramel and English style hops. Earthy and mild. A gentle fruitiness flows through. Taste is more of the same with a big charcoal bitterness. Dark roasted malt and smokey grains in the front with some mild sweetness. A touch of soap in the finish before more char and leafy hops and hop oiliness. Nice chewy feel that does not impede drinkability with an active carbonation. A very nice winter session ale that is begging for big smokey meats and cheeses.","scootny","Dec 30, 2011"

The light that could get through just gave off a red hue inside the glass. The head was thin but has a light brown color to it. The smell of the beer was a lot like a German Lager with some roasted malts and chocolate in the mix. The taste of the beer gave off a lot of chocolate and dark malt flavors, it had a good bitterness to it as well. The mouthfeel was on the lighter side which I thought was impressive.

Flavor has an early dark roasted bite moving into a lightly sweet chocolate malt followed by a very nice coffee smoothness and finishes with full combo of roasted and toasted malt notes. Body is moderate with a creamy feeling. This brew wasn't anything special when it was cold but as it warmed up, the deep roasted and toasted malt notes really brings about a barrage of flavors that really do work well together.

The sweetness disappears on the first sip, it's unsweetened chocolate again, with a hint of coffee (black...no cream or sugar). Those bitter flavors are joined by a hint of hops on the swallow.

Howl finishes pretty dry, as the bitter coffee lingers into a mildly dry, leafy hop finish.

If I could compare it to a person; remember that gothic chick that was in high-school. Well she seemed dark and probably smoked ciggs cause she thought it was "cool". Well then when you got to know her and passed all the black clothes and make-up, she was sorta sweet, but yet still dark. Yep that's this beer.

Head eventually settles into a fairly consistent quarter inch cap with a thick band of lacing exposed during the session. Nose is very subdued - a hint of chocolate malt, lactose and maybe dark fruit. Flavors are somewhat watery; a roasted/smokey quality comes out, as well as a touch of chocolate and lactic acid. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a very lively background effervescence. Not a bad session beer, but lacking some of the flavor representative of the style.

All I could smell was smoke, and not the nice campfire kind.. the week old Marlboro kind -- it almost seems as the roasting went a little too far. I battled through and took a taste, but again, the burnt smoky flavor was too much. Let this one sit for a few minutes to let the air hit this and hopefully mellow some flavors and draw out others, but to no avail. Took another drink and that was it, I had to pour the rest.

MH doesn't have a whole lot of dark beers in their lineup right now...even the occasional ones. This actually reminds me a bit of a blend of Jinx, and Heart of Darkness.

Hops continuous in the background, adding earthy notes and a pinch of citrus. Light body with a good carbonation level. Slight drying finish could stand to be a bit smoother.

When I got the first taste, I thought it must be the bbq ribs, so I had water and bread before trying again. It may have needed a little time to warm up after coming through a cold tap.

While I've enjoyed beer from Magic Hat in the past, I've found some to be just so-so but not this one. This beer, poured into a standard pint glass looked just like a still winter night, black, with a head of light brown/beige sky. The head dissipates a bit as one drinks down but still remains till the bottom of the glass,(trust me it's so good each sip will invite you back the bottom of the glass arrive quickly). The nose is a faint roasted grain aroma with a hint of coffee. The taste is velvety chocolate and the suttle aftertaste of a sweet mild morning coffee. The finish lingers in such a way as to invite another sip (that I just had to have right away!). The ABV at just 4.60% make Howl my new sessions beer. If the boys at AB want to really know what the meaning of drinkability is, this is drinkability with flavor. I think I'll Howl but, not at the moon, all night.","NJBeerguy","Nov 19, 2009"

I first sampled this at a Brewpub, but I am reviewing it after having a full pint. Had about an inch of head at the beginning, but after the first sip it started to dissipate until it just became lacing. The beer is a dark, black Lager, not Ale, with roasted, chocolate-esque & coffee-like overtones. It seemed like a Porter, but the aftertaste, body and finish is very much Lager. I liked that it was smoother than a Stout or Porter, not as heavy. My regret is that I only bought one bottle because this single pint left me thirsting for more.","Cagden","Nov 18, 2009"

This is not a thick winter warmer by any stretch, although the labeling could fool you. There are definitely mild roasted notes, maybe a touch of molasses in there too from the dark malts.

3.9,6.6,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,3,"12oz bottle purchased as part of a 6-pack at Shaw's in Derry, NH. Pours a pitch black body with slight brown-red highlights around the edges and nearly an inch of somewhat short-lived light tan head that clings to the side of the glass. Smells roasty, somewhat nutty - coffee comes to mind - with slight fruit and vanilla notes. Tastes roasty too, with a definite cappuccino-like quality, with some nut, hints of milk, vanilla, and a tinge of butter (I'm guessing from Ringwood yeast?), but not enough to overwhelm the rich sweet roastiness. Medium to full in body with moderate carbonation. This one is somewhat of a sipper, despite the low ABV and lack of viscosity, due to the complexity of the flavor. Not the best Schwarzbier I've had - I'm guessing this was made with ale yeast? Could stand to be cleaned up a bit leaving it with less-no diacetyl (which is another thing hurting the drinkability of it for me), but overall a pretty good beer, and one of the best that I've had from these guys by quite a wide margin.

It was however still on tap at the brewery a few weeks ago so it doesn't seem completely retired. They could have at least revamped Roxy Rolles to fit the fall season a little more, perhaps even put a pumpkin twist on it.

The beer is a little thin in the mouth, but there is a creamy texture similar to what you would find in a milk stout. Overall this is a good beer that has a very good mix of flavor and low alcohol.","Mora2000","Oct 27, 2009"

3.65,-0.3,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Haven't had many schwarzbiers, but they seem decently straight forward. This one reminds me of Left Hand Milk Stout from what I remember. Pours a pitch black color with a light tan two finger head that retains decently, nice and creamy. Leaves medium lacing behind. Smells of sweets, roasted malts and chocolate, strong nose but not a great one. Tastes of roasted malts and chocolate. Mouthfeel is moderate with a bit of creamyness to it, leaves a sweet grainy taste on the tongue. The carbonation is a bit much, really throws the beer off IMO. No alcohol warming at all. Drinkability is decent, the taste is not bad, the mouthfeel kind of throws this one off, great price, no bad flavors to kill this one, can be sessioned, probably won't buy this one again specifically.","cbutova","Oct 17, 2009"
3.53,-3.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Certainly not like the (defunct) Orlio Black Lager but still quite drinkable. There are definitely better styles out there but given MH's recent track record, hopefully this is the last "new" beer they'll have on the horizon as they've already killed off much better beers.","Brad007","Oct 16, 2009"
3.83,4.6,3.5,3,4,4,4.5,"Taste is sweet, coffee and chocolate, low carbonation makes it very smooth and rich. Awesome winter beer, very tasty and malty, really surprising this is a lager!","kingcrowing","Oct 15, 2009"
