The aroma is pleasant, with nice deep roasted malt, slight coffee and maybe some hints of anise or liquorice. The taste is really phenomenal, with the roasted flavors up front and center and a nice earthy hops in the background. There is a pleasant silky mouthfeel and and little bite from the hops. This is a really good dark lager, full of flavor but not too heavy.","delta490","Mar 22, 2014"

4.25,9.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a finer of off-white head over a clear very dark brown liquid. Smells dry coffee roast with a little bit of cherry sour to the roast. Newspaper and mild earthy noble hops. Tastes dry roast with a mild sweet chocolate playing underneath. Very light alcohol and absent of esters. Earthy hop bitter carries into the aftertaste with the lingering dry roast. Medium light in the mouth with moderate carbonation. I'm not a fan of this style, but this beer is a pretty decent drinking for a Schwarzbier.","mentor","Sep 25, 2013"

The taste is even better: roasted caramel and chocolate with crisp and gentle hops for a clean ending. Fantastic amount of flavor for such a light beer.","RichardMNixon","0"
