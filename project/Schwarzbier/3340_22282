3.57,-4.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was a nice example of a Schwarzbier, it had pretty much all the aspects that I look for in the style, but when it came down it I found myself wishing that the roasted aspects weren't so covered up by the other aspects, but I thought the rest of this beer was pretty well done.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, fairly creamy, a little crisp, not too filling and the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention so one bottle is enough for me, I don't have any urge to drink another one in a row.  What I like the most about this beer was the mouthfeel and appearance, they were both good and they were the highlights of this beer.  What I like the least about this beer was the roasted malt aspects were very restrained and I wish they showed up more.  I don't think I would buy this again, but I wouldn't turn one down and I can't say I would recommend it as a great example of a Schwarzbier, but if you really like the style then it's worth trying.  All in all I liked this beer but I didn't love it, it was solid, but it still needed some work.  It's not my favorite beer from this brewery and i would say it's just  little above average for the style.  I think it's solid, but with a little more work it could be very nice, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Dec 23, 2014"

I smell plenty of dark and sweet mat.  There's a hint of smoke in the aroma.  The taste is comprised of sweet,dark malt.

Pours a dark chestnut amber with a one finger light tan head that dissipated fairly quickly to a ring around the glass with wispy lacing. Aroma of sweet toasted malt, molasses, light nuts and a hint of hops. Flavor follows with toasted malt, a slight nuttiness, rye bread, finishes slightly dry with light grassy hops, faintly metallic. Light bodied with nice carbonation. The flavor is subdued, but very nicely balanced. Flavors are good enough that they make me want a slightly more intense version. Still nice schwarzbier that popped up in our market and is apparently a one time only arrival. I'll have it again if it shows up.","LiquidAmber","Jun 15, 2013"

I've struggled with this style before: having trouble finding any strong flavours and any depth, this was better than most. Far from robust and flavoursome it did however have something about it. There are chocolate and coffee notes in the taste and it does feel a little richer than most German Black Lagers I've encounted. Considering the price (less than two pounds): this was a good deal.","BlackHaddock","Nov 24, 2012"
