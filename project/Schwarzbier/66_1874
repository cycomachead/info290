This stuff pours a clear smoky topaz topped by a finger of charred cream foam. The nose comprises mild roast, light toast, and a touch of cashew. The taste intensifies the roast a bit and replaces the cashew with a bit of rubber. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, an odd little schwarz, really. The rubber character is pretty off-putting, but the rest seems to finish rather cleanly. I have no idea how old this bottle isw, so perhaps age has had an effect, but it seems fresh enough, just lackluster.","TMoney2591","Oct 12, 2013"

Thick clumps of lacing were exposed during the session. Nose was chocolate, lager yeast, a bit of skunk, and some citrus notes in the mix.

The nose smells like dark soda,slightly sweet with some faint hints of chocolate and a bit of noticable hoppage. This Schwarzbier is loaded with caramel,sweeter than I'm used to,not bad,and quite enjoyable. An underlying nuttiness and very obviously hoppy finish bring this back within the realm of the style.

Flavors are a bit more subtle than expected but mesh rather well. On the lighter side of medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Not the most robust Schwarzbier I've tried, but there's nothing wrong with this one. It's tasty and very drinkable. A solid Schwarzbier.","MrHurmateeowish","Jun 05, 2008"

I smell pilsner hops, toasted malts, and caramel undertones. The flavor is great. Nice and toasty, with a light body and creamy body. The malty body is delicately balanced with the slightly skunky hop flavor. The carbonation is noticeable and it adds a little bit of dryness and spice to the drink. At 4.9% ABV, this is plenty sessionable. I love a good schwazbier.

Seems very watery, what is there reminds me a bit of caramel but also finishes a little odd. Has a sweet flavor and has a slight hop ending. This brew was a let down, I enjoy Schwarzbier very much but IMO this just did not meet the cut.

Bland, and rather bright for a "dark" beer. The aftertaste lingers with the dry unsweetened cocoa note and sime residual hop spice. This saves it from being swill. Motuhfeel is medium and the carbonation is just fine. I wouldnt borther drinking this again. I was searching for an imported schwarz to get better aligned with the style without knowing what to pick and grabbed this one because it was there, but it seems this may not have been the best pick.

A good starting point for those shy about dark beers because it is so light in body.","ark57","Mar 18, 2004"
3.93,4.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Dark brown pour with some reddish light transmission. Nice head of 1/2 an inch of rising foam and with excellent lacing properties. Smell of light nutiness, malty sweetness and just a touch of grape. The mouthfeel is shy of medium but with a sharpness lent by fresh and grassy hoppiness that reminds me of its Mai bock cousin, and a beer I've had a soft spot for. Biscuity and honeyish malts compete early, but the attenuation is very nice and the beer dries to a satisfying finish. Well-balanced and more interesting than some other Schwarzbiers, slightly skeletal in body but with an added complexity.","ADR","Mar 12, 2004"
4.18,11.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer goes down pretty smooth and has a great taste. This is a top pick of the style for me.","jsolack","Mar 07, 2004"
3.92,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"I didn't have real high aspirations for this beer, as I have been unimpressed by the style in the past. Maybe it's because I had this after a couple of pilsners, but I really enjoyed it (particularly the taste). This is to Celebrator what Blanche de Chambly is to La Fin Du Monde. Nice, chocolate malt flavor, smooth and tasty. Somewhat thin and watery, and ultimately inconsequential. Nonetheless, a nice beer. I liked their pils quite a bit, also.","JohnnyDuvel","Feb 06, 2004"
3.13,-16.5,4,3.5,3,2.5,3,"330ml bottle labeled Einbecker SchwarzbierPoured an ice tea color brown with a thick head that is slowly settling down. Aroma is slightly roasted with a note of caramel. Body is a bit on the flat side. Flavor is a bit sweet and a bit weak also. Finishes dry. Overall very average and not worthy of future consumption.","BierReise","Feb 05, 2004"
3.8,1.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Color is a bit off with a clear chestnut brown with a ruby-like glow within, the head more then made up for it though, solid, finger high, thick and firm off-white top that sat a good while before fading down to a thick skim, globby small lacing. Aroma is roasty and sweet of malts with some plum and raisin undertones. Flavors are sweet and lightly dry of a roasted quality that aren't withstanding some length or boldness, not that its really all that necessary for the style but it seems to be over quickly. There's some nice subtlities to the roastyness with toffee, caramel, dark fruits, and grasses that help keep its pleasing tone, the finish is fluffy clean and slightly dry which is nice as well. Slight metalic bittering sneaks in nearer the finish. Feel is lightly creamy with a smooth light carbonation and hold of drying qualities within its medium body. Its a nice little drinker, mild and easy.","tavernjef","Feb 03, 2004"

3.17,-15.5,4,2,3.5,3.5,3.5,"slightly tannish head with a deep garnet dark brownish color. skunky aroma...that's it nothing else is decernable. smooth balanced with a slight bit of malty (munich?) background, no hop character at all but I wouldn't want one either. nicely balanced and very easy to drink. this would be excellent on tap.","shippos","Nov 26, 2003"
3.48,-7.2,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Tan colored head doesn't leave any lace, but clings to the sides as it sinks. Light caramel smell, but mostly malt. The beer is dark brown in color, with a ruby hue. An even mix of toasted malt with a pinch of caramel and a floral hoppy bitterness make up the taste. The carbonation is pretty evident in the mouthfeel, and the finish ends slightly bitter.","HappyHourHero","Nov 22, 2003"
3.7,-1.3,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Drinkability: While a very enjoyable beer, the dryness is a little more than I care for. I could not drink many of these back to back. Maybe after repeated exposure I will adjust to the dryness.","Loki","Nov 10, 2003"
2.95,-21.3,4,4,2.5,2.5,2.5,"This beer pours a clear dark reddish brown color with a moderately large rocky tan head. The smell is of sweet roasted malt. The taste/mouthfeel was moderate to thin with a sharp effervescence and little of the maltiness that was promised by the aroma and very little aftertaste. I thought I had a great beer from the aroma but was sadly dissapointed at the flavor. What was there wasn't bad but there just wasn't enough of it.","fattyre","Oct 31, 2003"

4.08,8.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"This was one pretty looking beer. Deep brown in color with lots of colorful highlights shining through. Taste was very even and went down really well. Flavors came at me with a sharp crispness. Toasted malts were there, caramel malt flavor followed, a roasted bitterness came through after that. Dark fruit taste was in the mix also. Well balanced and well crafted.","granger10","Aug 24, 2003"
3.95,5.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Named Einbecker Dunkel in Europe - allegedly the same beer (the Schwarzbier label is supposed to look trendier in the US). And it's definitely a Dunkel, not a Schwarzbier! Reddish brown colour, bread yeast and just a hint of coffee in the aroma. Flavour leaves you with the impression of drinking this beer in a bakery (this is not necessarily an insult to the beer - it's probably an OK accompaniment with a few sandwiches or even Danish pastry). Drier than I expected. Not as good as the Einbecker Ur-Bock Dunkel (and not nearly as good as Aass Bock, which I enjoyed 1 hour earlier) - a bit watery, but still a drinkable dunkel that won't offend anyone.","Sigmund","Aug 09, 2003"
3.91,4.3,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This beer poured a very dark brown (almost black) but clear with hints of red if held to the light. The foam was creamy and tan, and it clung to the glass and left some lace. The smell was modest but cocoa, caramel, and malt could be discerned. The taste was cocoa, mild chocolate, and caramel malt with very low hop presence. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with a slightly bitter, crisp finish. The body was medium with moderate carbonation feel. The drinkability was very good. This beer was easy to drink.","UncleJimbo","Aug 02, 2003"
4.12,9.9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This beer pours a very dark amber color with very small head and a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is sweet and fruity - very pleasant. Alcohol is also slightly apparent in the nose. Malt is very apparent in the flavor. It is very smooth and the mouthfeel is very good. The fruit taste is pretty strong in the taste, making it very pleasant on the tongue. Great beer.","clvand0","Jul 26, 2003"
3.95,5.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"pours out a clear and dark garnet colour with deep ruby hues. very pretty! a light tan head appears and slowly dissipates to a thin fine lace. lovely dark fruit and candy malt aroma with the typical german hop notes wafting about. a quite reserved but tasty dark malt flavour hits the tastebuds...light choco and caramel...sweet dark fruits peek through...all rounded out by some noble hops in the end. a somewhat skimpy, but silky smooth mouthfeel lets it slide right down my throat. a hint of crispness in the finish and you're left wanting to take another sip quite quickly. damn easy drinking and rather tasty to boot. a fine german brew.","budgood1","Jun 08, 2003"
3.58,-4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This brew poured a medium tan head with small to medium bubbles. The lacing was very sparse on the sides of my mug. I had a hard time trying to figure out the aroma on this particular brew. It had a smooth taste, but it was on the watery side. There was no bitterness noted with this brew. It lacks character and I was not very impressed with this drink.","hotstuff","May 24, 2003"

3.45,-8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Dark brown coloring with a reddish hue. Fruity aromas of grape/date with some maltiness to boot. Taste is dominated by tangy/fruity notes--apple and appleskin come to mind. A little bit of malty sweetness comes into play as the beer warms, but it remains a tart sort of brew all the way through. Solid but unspectacular.","doerickson","Oct 03, 2002"
3.47,-7.5,2.5,3,3.5,4,4,"Sometimes a guys gotta' wonder if there are drinking the same beer as others are, but my experiences differs from many on this one, especially with the aroma, which was all hops (including a noticeable aroma upon opening the bottle). Now a nice german lager hops, but no indication of malt. Dark brown to black with hints of garnet when held to the light. Clear. Short and thin head. Starts as a European pilsner and that's a taste that remains throughout. Middle to finish brings on the roasted malt flavors. The longer the beer sits the more the malt comes through. It's all very short lived. Interesting mix of flavors. Medium to high carbonation. Interesting beer, probably more of a dunkel than schwartzbier.","garymuchow","Aug 24, 2002"
4,6.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Mahagony in color and only slightly transparent with a light tan head.  Very interesting and complex nose.  Pretty well rounded with a medium body.  Caramel contributes to the generally sweet taste of the beer. Light bitterness in the finish.","jreitman","Jul 16, 2002"
