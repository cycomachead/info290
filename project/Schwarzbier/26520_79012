4.4,9.2,3.75,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The palate opens with juicy, bitter grapefruit juice and pine before segueing into a blend of caramel, toffee and cocoa before finishing with a wonderful juicy hop bitterness. Nutty, earthy, with hints of burnt sugar, the blend of flavors is particularly harmonious here, bringing to mind one of the better ABAs I've had, Hill Farmstead's Jimmy. Medium-full in body with moderate carbonation, this beer is soft and creamy on the palate. The finish is just fabulous, especially the balance between the flavors of citrus hops, pine bitterness and the roasted malt flavors. Awesome stuff.","DefenCorps","Nov 25, 2014"

Moderate hop bitterness lasting long into the finish of each sip. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation.

Really nice, pronounced olfactory presence: toffee, chocolate milk, roasted grain, alcohol. Taste is that of a quality schwarzbier with a certain hoppy tang that becomes more pronounced as the beer warms to a proper serving temperature. It's not outstanding, but certainly respectable and serviceable. Mouthfeel is a little aggressive, but adequately thick.","Altrurian","Apr 28, 2014"

4.19,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,4,4,"The beer pours a deep, chocolaty brown with a massive head of creamy, sand colored bubbles. The head sits two finger’s widths above the glass with a nice lasting retention and a puzzle grid of thin lacing. On the nose, the beer smells delicately of roasted coffee beans and damp pine forests. Smooth dark chocolate works its way into the nose alongside musty earth and subtle dankness. The balance on the nose between hops and malt is quite nice and intriguing. As I sniff for longer I start to sense oranges dipped in chocolate, which is quite inviting. On the tongue, the beer tastes bitter with roast and hoppy bitters. The finish brings a splash of sweet chocolate and bready malts, and a pop of citric acidity also lingers in the finish. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet citrus lemon, quickly falling into bitter pine resin and decadently toasted bread, blending roasted coffee and espresso bean flavors through rich dark chocolates. Subtle grass and herbal hops work their way into the finish alongside a beautiful burp of milk chocolate and toasted oatmeal bread. The aftertaste is of moderately bitter pine resin, which sticks to the roof of the mouth. In the mouth, the beer feels on the light side of medium in body with a middling carbonation and a crisp, snappy mouthfeel that provides nice drinkability and scrubs away some of the heavier roast and bitter flavors. After the beer leaves, the mouth is left with slight spittle in the cheeks, soft bitter burn down the middle of the tongue, and a sticky resinous feel on the roof of the mouth. Overall, this is a beautifully balanced hoppy lager. Terrific pine and roasted malts tango on the tongue in a way that I very much appreciate. The closest thing to compare this to would be an American Black Ale, but this beer is miles ahead of that style in terms of balance. This could please a hop head and a roasted malt lover at the same time. Another superb beer from Jack’s Abby.","Maxwell","Apr 01, 2014"

From the taste alone, it reminds me of the lager version of a "black IPA" when you take a porter malt bill and mate it with an IPA hop bill, only in this case, using bottom-fermenting yeast and a cold fermentation. I wish I had more of the style to compare to, but it's pretty good nonetheless, if roasty and piney are your thing.","tectactoe","Jul 30, 2013"

Color is a deep rich brown and the aroma is primarily dark malts. with a hint of hops. This is an extrememly tasty beer, just fine for a cool spring day. Although the significant hopping does not intrude on the overall balance, this beer could use a little more "middle". This is obviously amped up from the traditional style but still in the family. I wonder what the draft version is like?? This one was kindly laid on me by Jamie Magee during a visit to Iron Hill Lancaster.","BeerIsland","Apr 19, 2013"

The aroma is heavy on chocolate, molasses and doughy malt. Some pine and citrus hoppiness in there, as well. There’s more sweet roasted malt character than I expect from the style. It’s a pleasant aroma, but it’s more of a schwarzbier on steroids than a hoppy schwarzbier, at least in my opinion. I’m getting a fair bit of roast fruitiness. Pretty rich. Clean lager flavor. The taste is fairly sweet and still quite rich. Lots of fudge and treacle. Big coffee and pine needle finish. Again, over the top for the style, but still a very well made beer and quite tasty. I’m still not convinced that big hops and big roasted malt works well together, but this is a pleasant enough attempt, and I’m sure fans of American Black Ales and whatnot will like this beer. Very creamy mouthfeel. A bit much for the style, but who cares. This is a very good beer, and I would have called it an ale in a blind tasting. Knowing it’s a lager, I can bit out some of that clean yeastiness, but the hops and malt are too big for me to have guessed right.","popery","Apr 13, 2013"

This is a well made beer from start to finish. Clean and drinkable. Nice roasted but not burnt malt base, impressively bold and spicy hop profile.

3.87,-4,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a very dark brown, but not quite black with a fluffy tan head. Smell is a really nice mix of hops and roasted malt/chocolate, not unlike a black IPA. The flavor follows the nose, thought it doesn't quite come together as well I had hoped after an awesome aroma. Both the hoppiness and roastiness of this beer are quite nice, but there's a bit more of a clash in flavors than I had hoped for. The two types of bitterness don't quite coincide as well as I've experienced in the best of black IPAs, and thus it comes off as a little overly bitter. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side for the style and carbonation is high. It doesn't detract much from the experience, but it could use a little more body. Overall, this may be the first Jack's Abby beer that I wasn't absolutely in love with. I love schwarzbiers, but black IPAs are hit and miss for me and this beer comes closer to a black IPA than a schwarz. There's certainly a uniqueness to it, as it has some lager characteristics, but it could be a little more balanced.","starrdogg","Jul 23, 2012"
