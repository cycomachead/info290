It was like I just got done running a 5K and slammed a gatorade. One of the most session-able beers I've had in a while. Well done, but I'm not surprised, Live Oak makes some of the finest beers in TX.","Dajtai007","Mar 10, 2013"

4.5,13.9,4,4,4.5,5,5,"I get a nuanced roasty aroma that’s on the light side, with a wonderful caramel malt profile coming across. The flavor has a nice roast profile to it as well, with a light hop bittering and a delectable body. This lacks the cloyingly sweet flavor and heavy body that I find unwanted in my Schwarzbier —yet there’s just enough sweetness to round it out and a flavor which holds up even as it warms. Wonderful! Perhaps the closest beer to a Death & Taxes I’ve had in Texas. Bravo, Live Oak, bravo.","elNopalero","0"

3.58,-9.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"The beer pours a black color with a tan head. The aroma has a lot of roasted malt, as well as some very light smoke and some light chocolate. The flavor is similar. I get a lot of roasted malt, as well as some chalky, powdery chocolate and some grain notes. The beer is fairly dry. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.","Mora2000","Apr 03, 2012"
4.5,13.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O. Another delicious beer from Live Oak, possibly the best brewer of German and Czech style beers in the US. Every time LO brews a new beer they do it superbly, and if you can do the simple things to perfection you're doing every bit as well as someone who goes for the weird and esoteric. LO Hefe, LO Pilz, Treehugger, Big Bark, and now this. What a joy to be living in the same town.","omnigrits","Mar 24, 2012"

4,1.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Just had the new Live Oak Spring Seasonal on tap at the pub we work at. It pours an opaque black, but in the light it reveals ruby red undertones. The smell has flowery and spicy notes in addition to the maltiness smell. The taste is very nice, it has a hoppiness (that isn't too bitter) and is well balanced with the roasted malts. The feel is relatively smooth with a nice dry finish. This is the first Schwarzbier we've had so we don't have a lot to compare too, but overall we thought it was a very well done beer.","Kornoms","0"
