Lightly chard malts, light coffee and smoke. Lightly carbonated and little if any alcohol flavor make this highly drinkable.","orangemoustache","Oct 23, 2014"

4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours crystal clear dark brown color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, dark bread, smoke, light char, and roast/smokey earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark, roast, smoke, and bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, dark bread, smoke, light char, and roast/smokey earthiness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, dark bread, and roast/smokey earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of dark, roast, smoke, and bready malt notes; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Very clean flavor and finish as well. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is a damn nice schwarzbier style. All around great complexity and robustness of dark, roast, smoke, and bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 21, 2014"

3.97,7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and pretty good example of the style, it had all the aspects that I look for in the style with a nice and roasted flavor while still maintaining a light and drinkable body. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, not filling and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, I could drink a few of these and it makes for a nice and sessionable beer to enjoy in the wintertime. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style it was, from the taste to the aroma to the mouthfeel this was just what I would expect from a good Schwarzbier. What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, it wasn't bad looking, but I thought the head could have been a little better. I would buy this beer again when looking for a Schwarzbier and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the style. All in all I was happy with this beer, I was looking for a good Schwarzbier and this beer delivered. Good job guys, this was a good example of the style and I enjoyed drinking it, keep up the good work.","StoutHunter","Oct 16, 2013"

I guess it is the chocolate malts but every sip I get a toasted marshmallow that picks up about 1/2 way thru then finishes and just lingers.

Distinct dark sugar sweetness in the end, but finishes dry and a bit bitter. Love this beer!

2.85,-23.2,4,4,2,2.5,3,"Pours a dark brown/light black clear color. Smells of German hops and roast barley. Tastes like nice and strong roasted malts, much more roasty than a Koestritzer, which I think is great. Also much hoppier than the German version of this beer, which again is fine because the beer's authors stick to clean spicy and earthy hops. But this beer misses the whole point of the Schwartzbier; the roast flavor is not balanced with maltiness or brisk sulphury yeast flavor! Kidd needs much more Munich malt and a more flavorful German lager yeast. As it is, this beer comes across as a subdued stout, and I like my stouts to be more roasty and more estery, thank you very much. Kidd's designers seem to have simply applied the American beer transformation to a Schwartzbier: clean up the yeast, simplify the lightly-kilned malts, and accentuate the highly-kilned malts and hops. I understand that this will sell, but it's just a formulaic interpretation.","drummstikk","Sep 24, 2010"

Schwarzbier is one of my favorite styles and I actively seek them out where I can. This one poured beautifully, rich black/mahogany in the glass with a gorgeous tan to brown head. Subtle hint of (smoky?) malts in the nose and then that initial taste. Rich roasted malt and then (ugh!) smoked malts! Like drinking a great black lager mixed with the ashes of a campfire. Definitely not as bad as a Rauchbier, but the same smoked malts render the Schwarzbier only moderately drinkable (unless you're a smoked malt fan... and I'm not).

Pours a very dark brown/mahogany color with two fingers high of light tan colored head that settles to a fair cover and leaves healthy swaths of lacing. The aroma delivers a wonderfully deep malt and slight juniper with a bit of Mars bar chocolate and definitely an occasional licorice waft. Very intriguing! The first mouthful brings another element adding obvious smoked ham over a much more reserved herbal hopped malt. I imagine some licorice edges as well. But generally this is not as wonderful as the aroma suggested. It's quite thin in body with modest sprite carbonation. There is a little dryness in the feel, but it's a reasonably drinkable brew. I would like to see something with more body and flavor that holds together better. It's sort of weak and watery but it's not bad. Worth a try if you like the style.","Durge","Sep 09, 2010"

The flavor is well indicated by the nose with the sweeter notes like caramel and chocolate hitting the palate first and are finished up with a bitter, acrid burnt taste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a creamy carbonation and a dry, acrid finish.

Very little lacing is left behind at first, but after a few drinks some slim fingers of lace wrangle themselves to the top of the glass. Smells of roasted malts. Tastes big on the roasted malts at first, but after a few drinks some vanilla and nuttiness come out. Goes down smooth, kind of like a subdued doppelbock.
