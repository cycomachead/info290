Not much aroma; maybe a hint of medicine and booze which I wasn't crazy about. Taste was o.k., it was clean and smooth like a lager. Feel was good. Refreshing. I need to try other beers from this style.","Gajo74","Mar 31, 2015"

It is a clear, dark red-ish brown that holding it up to the light looks like a nice strong tea.  The half-finger of beige head disappeared quickly but left a small ring around the glass throughout.  The nose has nice earthy tones of straw and wood with perhaps a hint of chocolate.  Its body is smooth with just enough carbonation to notice.  Yet seems exceedingly thin for a dark beer.  All things considered I'd have this again.","thehooksman","Sep 04, 2014"

Its retention was such that I held it up to the light to check for color and clarity only to be flabbergasted by its ruby color and stunning clarity. Nose smelled of dark chocolate and freshly dug soil. Earthy as all get-out! That they could accomplish this in a lager is amazing. We make some great lagers here in PA, thanks to our German heritage, but this is great for a west coast concern. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full and I was getting flavors of dark chocolate, smoke, tobacco and earth in the mouth. Finish was semi-dry and very tasty with the smoky chocolaty flavor really lingering. I might try this out on my work colleague, Spike, who is not generally a fan of beer. I almost forgot to mention the lovely sticky lacing that remained in my glass.

You could effortlessly crush several of these in a sitting. This would be an interesting introductory brew for people who are scared of flavor or dark beers. Think premium lager but with a visual identity crisis and the faintest amount of dark grain flavor that is quite soft and squishy.","stakem","Nov 28, 2012"

The aroma is flush with dark bready malt and a very subtle underpinning of chocolate. The beer is carbonated on the palate and smooth as it rolls back. Cocoa flavors mix into a pleasant malt profile of dark bread, becoming slightly bitter at the end. The hops add additional earthy bitterness and leave the palate dry. This is an easy drinking brew, and tasty to boot.","BeardedBoffin","Nov 13, 2012"

Was not sure what to make of this beer from the looks, I was expecting a normal stout. Pulled from the cold fridge and poured into a glass, out flowed the deepest mahogany color with an off-white head. I wanted to allow time for this beer to breathe, nonetheless for unknown reasons I was compelled to quaff it down and was hit with pallet punch of flavors. The aromas of coffee, black cherry and licorice are mixed in with lightly roasted malts and a bit of dark chocolate. I enjoyed every minute of this beer immensely, regrettably some people might find this similar to Guinness.","smokinyodas","Oct 21, 2012"

Tastes more strongly of coffee than in aroma, with same citrus tang which seems to provide the flavor balance rather than a pronounced hop flavor. Dry, brittle molasses and malt provide the majority of the body.

4,8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Smooth medium sized body with brisk carbonation. Roasted malt with a touch of caramel flows in pungent chocolate which is washed away into an amazing balancing act thanks to the hops. While the flavors are mostly subtle except for the pungent flavor bomb on the mid-palate, theres lots of subtle complexities of charcoal and dark fruit, plums, black berries, cherries and raspberries. Extremely sessionable with bold flavors, and subtle ones if you want look for them. This beer is meant to be drank cold though! and actually, i think it tastes better straight from the bottle rather than a glass. Once this beer warms, those nice roasted chocolate notes become harsh and medicinal. Just keep it cold and you have one of the most flavorful session beers around.","jtierney89","Sep 06, 2012"

I have I say that this is one of the most under-rated beers ever. It is a beer with a fantastic amount of flavor considering its price point. I know Full Sail has won a lot of awards for this beer and they are well deserved, my only complaint is that it isn't actually very "sessionable" at 5.4% ABV, if it was 4.8% or under I would make this a go-to.

Rich brown to orange in color while remaining fully transparent, shines vividly in the glass. The nose is not really that smoky and puts the spotlight on caramel, honey dolloped breads, brown sugar, cola bean and a touch of café au lait, minor element of grains and yeast, the plum to black cherry fruit has some prune in it, average length and staying power. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is not that big, however, it does steadily churn across the tongue and relieves some sweetness. That said, the smokiness here too is a barbecue grill nature and plays to the molasses, caramel, brown sugar, grilled nuts, cola and mocha chocolate. More breakfast danish sort of breadiness than dinner breads or pretzels, no pronounced hops presence. The fruits more a mix than distinct flavors, dark berries and cherries. In the end it’s the carbonation which saves it and allows it to be “sessionable.” Could put back 2-3 before getting bored.","farrago","Jan 04, 2012"

On the smell all you really detect is malt, maybe some chocolate notes too, but not much else, it just smells really crisp and very smooth. Wow, very robust taste that just hits you up front and stays with you for a while. Yeah there are some definite chocolate notes in here, and of course I taste a lot of malt, it's a very simple beer, but really well done! It just tastes like there is nothing wrong with it at all, they didn't do much, but what they did, they did it really really well. I might be picking up a tiny tiny hop bite in the end, but not much at all. For this being a "sessionable" beer, it's really very robust and well done. Is it the best beer I've ever had? No, but I'm very surprised and pleased at how good it tastes. The mouthfeel is more than I expected, it doesn't have a watery feel at all to it, it's a legit mouthfeel.

A residual sweetness that hinted of alcohol, but everytime I thought the sweet would become cloying or the alcohol overpowering, it seemed to back off and the flavor remained fairly balanced. A bit on the thin side and lacking any real dramatic flavor, but I get the "Session" tag. Not bad.

Not all that drinkable, many real session beers (less than 4% abv) are richer and have more flavor. I guess compared to a dipa this is sessionable, but it really isn't that good of a beer.

In my opinion, they nailed it with this one, balancing great character with overall drinkability in a style of beer rarely brewed in the U.S. Just a couple of suggestions---Although the brewery advertises just drinking this straight from the bottle, like every other good beer with this much character, it greatly benefits from being poured into a glass. Also, don't drink this one as cold as you would a pale lager, as it definitely masks the roasted malt character which is the best part of this brew to appreciate.","AustinBeerLvr","Nov 07, 2010"

It is a moderately strong aroma, but is rather simple. The taste is like the aroma, but weaker. Even with its simplicity it would be nice if there were a little more pizazz to it.

On the palate it is light and watery, with some faint malt and roasty components there, and pretty much screams that it is a "3.2 beer" from Utah or other similar state (but it isn't!).

There's a healthy amount of wheatiness in their as well, not unlike a dunkelweizen with less yeastiness. A slight woddy/nutty quality is also present, but very subdued.

The darker color of these beers comes from the use of roasted malts, which is basically barley or wheat roasted until the grain has a dark brown color. The Sessions Black Lager is truly unique with its old school squatty bottle, its retro looking label and great flavor. The beauty of Sessions is that it is not a microbrew, not a macrobrew nor an import, it is all of them and none of them at the same time. The beer itself is smooth, dark and surprisingly refreshing with initial tastes of chocolate and caramel malts with a touch of citrus. The hops and malts are balanced nicely providing a long, smooth and slightly bitter finish. Definitely a beer I will drink all summer long!","WhatsNewinBooze","Nov 08, 2009"

This so easy to drink, some ex-girlfriends may be getting texts at 2 in the morning.","HairOfTh3Dog","Jun 30, 2009"

The flavor is sweet upfront with chocolate-like flavors. Its light bodied with a good amount of carbonation. This is a very drinkable dark lager with really no bitterness to speak of. Something to mix it up for those Mexican dark lager drinkers.","DiabolikDUB","Jun 27, 2009"
