Perhaps a black KÃ¶lsch would be a better description.  22oz bottle served in a curved stout glass.  Beer pours on the brown side of black, with a thin tan head, and yields a mild, malty aroma.  Flavor is mild and fizzy.  Like, a lot mild, though what flavors there are (nutty, hazelnut) are pleasant enough, except for the high carbonation this could be a legitimate session ale.","hreb","Feb 05, 2015"

It's a difficult style to pull off, IMO, because it doesn't quite excel in any particular area. This one has some uniqueness, and it's undoubtedly due to the ale yeast used. Don't go out of your way for it, but definitely something to try if readily available.","TheSixthRing","Jan 11, 2015"

3.75,2.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Big thanks to the BA who sent this one out to me as an extra in a past trade. Shared this one with my doppelganger after a day at the gun store. Served from bottle into a New Jersey Devils (my inner Penguins fan is pissed!) shaker. Poured a massively dark amber brown with a four finger off-white head head that subsided to a minimal amount very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, earth, earth hop, and subtle spice. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, spice, earth, earth hop, fruit, dark chocolate, and subtle fruit hop. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. For the style there really wasn't a lot of roastiness going on in this one as it was more sweet and earthy than anything else. While this was kind of surprising, I really didn't mind it too much if I am honest. This did keep it quite enjoyable throughout the beer, but it just fell a little short of what one would expect from the style. Still a good brew, but just not up there for the style. Worth your time trying at least once, but if you enjoy the roastiness this one MIGHT not be for you.","thagr81us","Mar 04, 2013"

3.6,-1.6,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Finally got around to trying this. Black Ale that was made like a Schwarz Bier sounds interesting...especially the ale yeast instead of lager yeast. Pours out like a porter. A good dark brown and as it settles in the glass its dark as night. No light gets through the brew when held up to the light except for the top of the rim of the beer. It has kind of a light brown hue. The head was a thick creamy khaki color that faded away quickly with a very thin head stay around. The smell, when cold has a hint of bread and chocolate at front and a subtle roast in the end. The taste has a very sweet flavor with a hint of roasty peat and bitter chocolate. No hops at all. Very sessionable dark beer with flavor that does not stick around. Its tasty and makes you want some more. The mouthfeel is very thin. Not too carbonated. Very watery texture. Its not bad but its color yells thick dark goodness but the low 5.7% abv is most evident in this portion of the beer. I have had 8% dark beers with a thicker mouthfeel but similar flavor. However, this is not a negative, just a part of the beer that is hard to anticipate when pouring it out of the bottle. Giving a second pour I looked more at the liquid and it looks like cola, which confirms the very thin mouthfeel to this beer. This is a good beer. Not something that screams buy again but its definitely one worth trying. Its an interesting beer. It has properties like a porter and of a schwarz bier. And overall, for under 4 dollars, worth the price.","Vancoubeer","Nov 03, 2012"

His finely tailored suit of rich velvet fit precisely and his jet black hair was slicked with a fragrant pomade. âCarlton, please, slow a bit!â He called to the carriage driver. He lifted the lacy ebony curtain and looked out into the dark night and noticed a single cat, staring intently upon the carriage as it slid to a stop. The cat peered knowingly and its obsidian coat shined in the night. It appeared to nod and signal to the magistrate. With a blink it disappeared. Sir Grimsley looked up and noted the mandate from todayâs proceedings laying on the adjacent seat, unexecuted. With a forceful sigh, Sir Grimsley signed the stay of execution and set the prisoner free.

3.33,-9,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall, nice beer, easy drinker, low ABV for sessioning with the pals. I like that they are a small brewer and they have great potential!! I would retry their brews if I had the chance but they seem a bit immature still.","quetzal013","Jan 27, 2011"
3.5,-4.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"One finger light tan head, medium dissipation with minimal lacing over dark brown/almost black opaque body. Nose features good dose of roasted malt balanced by floral hops. Taste is predominantly roasted malts, picked up some faint chocolate notes once it warmed significantly, citrus hops, no bitterness to speak of on backend. Medium mouthfeel, decent effervescence, a wee bit sticky. This is what they are talking about when they call CDAs hoppy Porters. I know I'm spoiled by my proximity to Barley Brown's Turmoil, the benchmark for the style evidenced by first Gold medal at GABF in the category, I just didn't find this that interesting and certainly not hoppy enough for my liking.","jdense","Jan 01, 2011"

3.85,5.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability is also good. The more I drink this the more I think it could be a black lager. Interesting and tasty whatever it is...","flexabull","Nov 30, 2010"
3.51,-4.1,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Drinkability-Smooth and drinkable, but frankly a bit boring. Billed as as black ale, this beer is a darker brown ale with a bit more roast.","olmatty","Oct 07, 2010"
3.53,-3.6,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"poured a dark brown in color with brownish yellow highlights that had a thin head and left a little lacing on the glass. The aroma was filled with toffee character, slight hops, various grain notes, and an slight spice. The taste was also dominated by the toffee like a dopplebock with caramel, various grain, and mild citrus notes. There was a touch of hops but were very subtle and mild spice on the backend. The brew was medium in body with a moderate amount of carbonation which had a grainy, slight sweet, but malty finish. It drank good but was not my favorite from the nite. Definitely a session beer after a long day at work","Gobzilla","Aug 08, 2010"
3.33,-9,4,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,"When properly carbonated, S1nist0r (note the buried '10') Black Ale is probably about as good as this brewery's Apocalypse IPA. If it was more easily available, I'd give it another go round to see if my suspicions are correct.","BuckeyeNation","Aug 03, 2010"
3.8,3.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Picked up in Oregon, brought back. Into a Bernardus chalice, this is a very dark, oily black beer with a head that receded nearly immediately, leaving a light film on top. Chocolate and cocoa, slightly powdery smelling, dominate the nose. Pretty good flavor, with lots of chocolate malt balanced by moderately high bitterness (no hop flavor though), and a very light roast overlaying it. Not complex, but a good enough generic dark beer.","allengarvin","Jun 06, 2010"
3.82,4.4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"And hey, a nice herbal burp results with this one! Overall, Sinister (or S1nist0r) is an enjoyable and solid beer that offers a somewhat interesting take on the well-worn brown ale style.","Metalmonk","May 28, 2010"

3.6,-1.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,4.5,"Imagine a decent american porter flavor profile but strip away the body, replace it with the mouthfeel that approches light lager territory. I enjoyed it, but it just didnt fully come together for me.","zoolzoo","Mar 02, 2010"

The flavor is rich and polished with deep, dark flavors. Has a great texture and balance. Finishes smooth and balanced but with a slight edge from the alcohol. Very nice!","cbarrett4","Oct 20, 2008"
3.9,6.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"D: Tasty and 'sessionable' (though not beholden to the strictest definition). Have enjoyed, if not raved about, this beer whenever I've had it; certainly worth a try.","msubulldog25","Beers"
3.91,6.8,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Either way, Wildfire's Black Ale gives me no cause for complaint, for it is a genuine pleasure to consume. It is a very chocolaty beer not far removed from a brown ale but in a darker shade of chestnut. It has a chocolaty aroma, a solid head, and wild abstract lace. The body appears clear in the sense of lacking haze or particulate matter, but is nearly opaque brown. It tastes smooth and malty with solid but not overpowering bittering courtesy of Perle hops. Worth seeking.","RedDiamond","0"
