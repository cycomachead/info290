3.88,6.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"12 oz can in a basic pint glass. The brew pours a dark chestnut brown, quite hazy, with tan head and lacing. I don't get much in the way of smell, maybe a slightly caramel flavor, but that is to be expected with a lager. The mouthfeel is bright and bubbly, and light-to-medium bodied. The initial taste is nutty, bitter, with some toast. There's not much in the way of aftertaste. At 5%, this is highly drinkable. Overall I enjoy this and would buy again.","gabrielsyme","Mar 21, 2014"

No off flavors that I could detect. It just seems a bit shy, like a wallflower at the homecoming dance. The biggest complaint against this beer is not about what it is, but what it could easily be. It's a solid "almost" brew, and one I'd almost grab off the shelf again.","jokelahoma","Feb 10, 2014"

4.06,11.2,4.5,4,4,4.25,4,"The Crack was loud and inspiring, so I employed an inverted Glug into my Schlafly CAN Sessions CAN-shaped glass. I had two fingers of dense, light-tan head with good retention. Color was garnet (?)/ruby (?) (SRM = > 34, < 44) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled very chocolaty and I was ready for some beer to hit me. Mouthfeel was big and full and the taste was both caramel and chocolate and I was really digging it. I ate some spicy curried chicken for lunch and this was a welcome respite from the heat. Finish was smoky, chocolaty and caramel. This was more in line with what I expect from Schlafly and I wish that I had another for the upcoming Hula in the Coola Day (01 Feb, annually). Man, I really dig drinking well-made lagers when there are so many crappy ones on the market.","woodychandler","Dec 06, 2013"

The faintest notes of malts. Taste is light, mild, some roasted malts, really not much going on. Feels light in the mouth and overall nothing special about this beer, mediocre at best.","tone77","Nov 17, 2013"

4.01,9.9,5,4,4,3.5,4,"The black lager introduces a strong roasted and smokey flavor to the wheat taste of a basic lager. It can best be described as an alcoholic iced coffee with a little wheat to it. I personally love it, but it wasn't released in 2012. In 2013 Schlafly released a canned version which i'll review separately after i've given it a try.","Pyramid_Head","May 03, 2012"

3.85,5.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle, bottled on 12/9/2011. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a mahogany brown color with about a half inch off-white head. Both the head retention and lacing are decent enough. The brew smells like roasted and bready malt, coffee, nuts and some chocolate. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some caramel and a bit of an earthy flavor. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit creamy and goes down easy. I think it's a solid brew overall. I'd buy this one again, hopefully a fresher bottle next time around. Still, even now it's worth a try at $1.75 for a single bottle.

Starts off with a bit of malt sweetness and roasted grains, then opens up to a smooth caramel/coffee/smoke balance. Ends with a slight earthiness, along with a touch of roasted grain bitterness and toasted malt. Thin-to-medium in body, with a mildly acidic finish that adds to it's clean and crisp mouthfeel.
