Aroma is chocolate, dark roasted malts, fresh cut pumpernickel, toffee, caramel & a hint of smoke. Only a faint hint of dark fruit & rye is weak. Taste is similar with the addition of smoke, a burnt note & more & darker chocolate among the bread, dark malt, caramel & toffee. Slightly bitter, with only a little rye spice from mid-sip into the finish. Bitterness declines in the aftertaste which is rich with burnt/roast notes.

Aroma is smoked malts right off the top. Dark, evil, with hints of campfire, peat, dark roasted chocolate and a good bit of almost a licorice touch to it. As I take the first sip a rich and creamy feel overloads the senses. Wonderful and rich, dark and foreboding, it seems that it is just meant to be evil and dark. Loads of roasted and smoked malts just rolling across the tongue. Lightly dry finish leaves just enough room for a small amount of smoky flavor to pop its head in and really give it a nice solid finish. great job","mikesgroove","Jan 31, 2012"

Poured a massively dark brown (almost black) with a one and a half finger tan head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, coffee, toffee, caramel, cream, dark chocolate, smoke, and dark fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, oatmeal, dark chocolate, coffee, smoke and subtle caramel. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The aroma on this one was quite inviting and pleasant. The flavor on this was a little surprising as the smoke comes through a lot more on the followthrough than it does in the aroma. A definite must try for fans of the style or the curious alike.","thagr81us","Dec 27, 2011"

3.83,0.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Growler fill from GBX in Greenville. Jet black with a nice 2 finger tan head. Spotty lacing. Smell is of coffee and figs. Not a lot to the smell. Taste is more in line with a porter than a schwartz, but that is not a bad thing. Different for the style, but has a touch of dull aftertaste that is distracting. Perhaps it's a growler thing, but I do like the ease of this beer and would consider it a session beer. Notes of coffee and some mild figs with some roasted malts on the end with a hop kick. Feel is more porter like as well, but a good bit of carbonation on this one. Overall- A pretty good effort and one I would hit again. It falls more in line with a porter/stout than a schwartz. Easy to drink and perhaps a bit too much hop on the end.","TheDinger","Dec 07, 2011"
