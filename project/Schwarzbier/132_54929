3.92,-2.2,4,3.75,4,3.75,4,"Enjoyed from a 22 oz  bottle in a pint glass.  This fine black lager pours a thick black with a fantastic brown head of dissipating foam that dies down to a thin ring and light lacing.  Nose of chocolate, light smoke, sweet malts, and black raisins.  Flavors are strong sweet up front, a raisin note come through on the rear blending in nicely with the chocolate notes.  This is a seriously slick brew with light carbonation for a lager with a smooth mouth feel that finishes lightly bitter from the malts and lightly bitter hops.  Nice.","Brutaltruth","Mar 05, 2015"
3.24,-19.2,4.5,4.25,2.5,4,2.75,"I was highly disappointed by this beer. I didn't really have a lot of expectations, but I didn't expect this. I had the Guinness Black Lager recently, and loved that. So I thought, "hey, a black lager, this should be good". But this was way worse. Again, a lot of this is just personal preference, but I just don't like the flavor profile and/or balance of this beer. It's far from terrible. But I think the smokiness is just really out of place in a lager.","mchegash","Mar 02, 2015"

The fairly full texture helps to smooth out the otherwise sharp bite of the roasted malt and hop acidity, though the roastiness is still a bit much. The aroma is wonderfully appetizing. Very tasty and bold on the whole.","The_Mad_Capper","Feb 22, 2015"

Taste is very bitter -- this is not for the faint of heart.  Solid, crisp chocolate bite heavy on the malt.  With all organic ingredients, this is a very complex, interesting beer.  There was a slight sourness in the finish, but I would definitely pick this up again for a great Thanksgiving or Christmas meal.","oldirtycaffrey","Dec 10, 2014"

3.83,-4.5,4,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Bomber poured into a tulip glass. Amazing in its opacity, pitch black with no light getting through the murk, capped by a rich cafe latte-colored head. Nose features some very pleasing malt acrobatics, prunes, raisins, dark roast coffee, a whiff of caramel, and some earthy herbal hops. Palate includes all these elements plus some dry chocolate flakes and light ash for good measure, starts sweet and roasty, almost stout-like before going very crisp and dry for the finish, as per the style. Nice creamy mouthfeel adds to the stout-like vibe, as does the low key carbonation. Some noble-type hops add a little pepper and vanilla perhaps. Great stuff and manages to deliver more robust flavors than maybe one would expect from a lager of this ilk. Is is TOO sweet? Perhaps. Here's where I channel my Micheal Jackson-like disregard for uber-rigid style guidelines in favor of just enjoying the show.","CalgaryFMC","0"

It drinks more like Duck Rabbit's than the previous two with the weight and boldness. A great beer. Toss this into six packs and I'll be a happy camper.","joe1510","Jan 29, 2014"

The flavors were similar to the nose (with accentuated rye bread/pumpernickel, and bitter chocolate tones), with a touch more astringency on the finish than I anticipated.

Flavor is fairly hoppy. Hops seems a little muddled...I'm not really familar with Independent and Revelolution. Flavor through the middle is roasty, with more of a burnt aftertaste. Carbonation is relatively light, barely cutting through the (compartively) heavy grain bill. Seriously, I feel like I can taste little particles of nearly ashen roasted barley on my tongue. Of course the beer is too opaque to see if there's actual grain or any other sediment suspended in it. Compared to this, other schwarzbiers are lagers with food coloring added. This is an enjoyable expression of the style.","hreb","Jan 23, 2013"

Smells of dry toasted malts, some coffee, some dark cocoa, some soil and a little bit of almond. Nice nose. Taste is dry and toasted with a slight sweetness and a ton of coffee ground and soil character. Medium light bodied with lower carb and an appropriately dry finish.

4.18,4.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"this is one of the best beers ive had in awhile. it took me totally by surprise how much i got off on this stuff. it pours jet black, dense looking for a lager, with a tall and lasting coffee colored head of tiny bubbles. the nose is really dark roasted barley, nearly burnt, with notes of coffee and raw black chocolate. its earthy and organic smelling, dank in a way, and more hoppy than i expected, but not quite in the cascadian dark ale range yet (at least as far as the nose goes). the flavor is amazing, it starts off really bitter, like espresso but not acidic, its got a touch of smoke to it, black soil, and then comes the hops, slightly citric, but more bitter than anything, adding a nice compliment to the already dry bitter malt profile. the beer then smoothly but swiftly transitions in a crisp black lager, lighter than its been until now, suddenly being at one refreshing and warming. the heavy cloud has lifted, and the beer finishes like any lager should. what a journey. mouthfeel follows suit, starting heavy as hell, like a massive stout, but it then relaxes to a lager feel, crisp and clean. there is so much flavor brilliantly packed into this beer, which starts sturdy and ends delicately. this may be the best rogue beer ive ever had, and it has inspired me to buy some of the other grow your own series beers from them, as this is simply exquisite. the first beer to blow my mind in a long time. it went expertly with spicy blackbeans and escargots over angel hair. what a gem this is!","StonedTrippin","Nov 28, 2012"

Aromas of huge dark chocolate, charcoal, smoked meat, wood, coffee, caramel, dark roasted malt, vanilla, and some herbal hops. Wow, nice aromas here that threw me for a loop. I was not expecting to be hit in the face with smokiness. Taste of big dark chocolate, dark roasted malt, smoke, wood, caramel, nuttiness, and light herbal spiciness. Decent bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, smoke, and caramel on the finish for a while. Medium carbonation and body; with a highly creamy, lush, and smooth mouthfeel for a 6% beer. Hardly any alcohol present other than a slight warming after the finish. Very drinkable stuff; and it is also very robust in flavor for the gravity. Overall this is an outstanding schwarzbier; with a very robust flavor profile, and easy smooth drinking.

Very nice earthy and grassy touches throughout as well, with a touch of molasses maybe as it warms up. Rich chocolate like flavor almost coming through in the beginning and then turning over to a more roasted and smoke like flavor. Lots of different earthy tones here were coming together rather nicely. A touch of caramel or molasses like sweetness in the middle and some of the bittering effects in it towards the end.

Very nice looking dark brew. Nose is sweet to very sweet, with lots of chocolate/smoky notes. Toasted malt and burnt toast, powdery cocoa, hints of coffee. In the mouth, it’s not nearly as sweet as the nose advertises. There’s a definite burnt character, and flavor is surprisingly dry compared to nose. Hints of mild coffee with dark chocolate bitterness. Firm but not overwhelming; enjoyable. Mouth is a bit thin and watery, bubbly, and quenching. Overall, looks and smells great, though a bit underwhelming taste. Overall good for style. Tasty and quenching, traditional. Not an “extreme” beer by any stretch, but good overall.","jettjon","Jun 03, 2011"

4.11,2.5,5,4,4,4.5,4,"One of several beer birthday gifts from my wife a from May. Poured it into a Duvel Tulip glass. This was by far the best looking schwartzbiers I've ever had. It pours out pitch black, much like a heavy looking Russian Imperial Stout or Double Stout. The darkness consumes the glass, no highlights can be seen. The beer produces an insanely big dark brown colored head, initially it looks like some pretty good lacing, but it doesn't really stick around that much, it leaves a ring around the top. The initial pour comes up big and almost produces like a nitro type effect. The smell is good, much of it smells like dark malts, slight hints of dark chocolate and coffee. Not as much of a hop presence as I expected, but present and accounted for, earthy/spicy. The taste is good, I feel as if it is a little more complex than the smell. Big dark malts again, dark chocolate and black coffee. Hops are a bit stronger, they blend nicely, still a bit earthy. Call me crazy, but I detect a smokey flavor that I didn't notice in the smell, maybe some peat or a German smoke malt. The mouthfeel is incredibly excellent. It's a full bodied big feel, yet at the time it's both soft and smooth. Slight bitter finish at the end, I'm digging it. Drinkability is good. I'm liking this beer more and more as I drink it. I thought I read somewhere that the ABV was around 9 but it's only 6. I might have had it sooner if I had known that. When it was cold the hops weren't as noticeable so I'm wondering if they dulled out at all over the last 3 months.

Had the smell of roasted coffee, campfire embers, peaty malt scotch, and potting soil. We both couldn't stop smelling it and rattling off something else we each smelled. Taste was just as delicious. Very intense bitter dark chocolate, espresso, molasses, and brown sugar were flavors that I detected. Mouthfeel was much more thicker than I was expecting.

A viscous black pour into a nonic pint glass resulting in a solid black appearance with thin reddish dark tan head that stuck as lace in a minimal way. The aroma lent towards a smoked or rauchbier style, as well as dark coffee and a hint of lemon hop. The flavor was a near-burnt smoky malt with black coffee, dark chocolate and bit of hop to round it out. Not on the sweeter end of schwarzbiers/black lagers. Nice body & mouthfeel with presence of alcohol, but not overwhelming or distracting. Hearty sipper that did not push any extreme...nicely balanced.","selecter70","Mar 18, 2010"

Overall this was the perfect schwarzbier, for my tastes. It had a great smoky profile that was bold but not overwhelming (like rauchbiers).

Indeed, the nose is super-smoky, yet at the same time, there's a counter-balancing sweet milk chocolate side as well, followed on by licorice, caramel, banana compote, charred driftwood, mixes in cookie dough and uncooked oats, admirable complexity. Full-bodied with little heaviness, the smokiness creates enough perfume that maybe you just ignore the weight. Along with the burning kindling you get pork rinds and general grill fat notes. Bitter coffee grinds, dark chocolate, cocoa, anise seed play big roles. Hard to find any real fruit or citrus flavors in there. It's almost like a dessert created on an open pit fire.

It's like a double stout lager. It's incredibly dark and full bodied; more than any other black lager I've had. The mouthfeel is decent.

4.23,5.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall, a really good beer. Not really a traditional schwarzbier is my option. More like a porter or a stout in my opinion. Either way, a flavorful and balanced beer. One of Rogue's better seletions and certainly worth trying.","Gosox8787","Feb 19, 2010"

4.03,0.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"After a vigorous pour with beer is black with a half inch head that sticks around long. The aroma is of roasted malt, some graham cracker, hints of baker's chocolate. This smells like a stout....a nice stout, but a stout nonetheless. The taste isn't same burly as the aroma, but it is still very stout like. In fact it reminds me a lot of a good Irish Dry Stout. There is some nice, light roasted malt with some light graham cracker too. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this beer is certainly not a Schwarzbier. There is nothing about it that indicates it was brewed with a lager yeast. The front of the bottle calls it a lager, but the back simply says it is brewed with "German yeast." The thing is German yeast isn't a lager yeast. Germans brew ales too. And if memory serves me right Rogue considers its pacman yeast a german yeast. Thus, I consider this to be a good stout brewer with Rogue's signature yeast. Whatever it is, though, I think it is very good, and would like to see it in six packs.","KarlHungus","Feb 18, 2010"
4,-0.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours viscous and jet black with a chunky brown head that leaves a lot of sticky lace. A very roasty nose with some earthy hops. Smooth, chocolately and highly roasty, but not burnt or toasted. Fairly chewy mouthfeel but very smooth and fairly clean. Hops are barely discernible other than providing a fresh, minty bitterness to support the roasty malt. Finishes pretty long and roasty but clean. Drinks more like a milk stout than any style of lager, although it shows lager smoothness and clarity of flavor. A supple, round, stout-like lager; very tasty.","bcm119","Feb 17, 2010"
4.02,0.2,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"D - A tasty black lager I would certainly not hesitate to try it again if I saw it on tap, but the price of bombers doesn't make this seem like a good value -up near $10 from what I am told which comes out to around .45 cents an ounce - I understand the terroir involved tends to increase the price, though","Slatetank","Feb 17, 2010"

Not saying Dirtoir is a bad beer (quite the opposite), but don't advertise a Lager and give me something that looks, smells, and tastes like an Ale. Roasted black chocolate malts add a healthy dose of perceived bitterness; hops are earthy...soil and coffee grounds in the finish. Decent mouthfeel, a bit on the thin side but nicely carbonated and smooth across the palate. All in all, a tasty entry into Rogue's catalogue. Looking forward to the "Second Growth" series...I wonder if they'll make a hop-forward beer with the first generation of their hop plants?","wagenvolks","Feb 11, 2010"

My local beer store told me Rogue called them directly and that they would only be selling these Chatoe Rogue beers to smaller mom and pop type beer stores, so I was a a little skeptical as to why they would do this, and not release it on a large scale (I guess it has to do with the whole grow your own thing).

Head retention is good, and there's also a lot of lacing left behind on the glass. Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate and some coffee. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like burnt/charred and roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, coffee and some hops noticable in the finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and is well carbonated. Drinkability is very good, it's smooth and quite enjoyable to drink. I think this brew seems more like a robust porter than a schwarzbier, but I'm not complaining at all. I think this is a pretty good brew, it's worth a try if you come across it.","bluejacket74","Feb 05, 2010"

3.93,-2,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours jet lack with tons of fine and slowly forming foam, a la nitro. Foam is quite tan and leaves a ton of lace. If you handed me a glass of this without knowing, I would thank you for the wonderful looking stout. Lots of dark roasted coffee, chocolate and a touch of smoke in the nose. Lighter than it appears, the crisp effervescence makes for a nice mouthfeel. Taste is lots of dark roasted coffee and dark chocolate with a very modest touch of fruitiness among the light smoke. The finish is a lasting smooth bitterness that is manifested in a dark chocolate sensibility. Very cool beer, and quite delicious but I think it may be a bit more toward the porter end of the style for my liking. Still very yummy though. It's also pretty cool to see Rogue grow all their own ingredients and I'm eager to see what else will come of this!","cdpike","Feb 02, 2010"

Smells chocolatey and slightly roasty, with some citrusy hop aromas and a bit of creaminess. Quite bold and rich in flavor with a nice combination of creaminess, vibrant citrusy hop presence, some light roastiness, and a bit of sour graininess.
