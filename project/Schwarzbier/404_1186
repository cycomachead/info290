3.61,7.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Pours clear and on the lighter side for the style. Deep amber. Brilliant with clarity and a fat head of tan creamy foam that lasts a surprisingly long time and leaves lace.  Nose is rich with toasty malt. Nothing burnt, nothing roasted. No coffee, or chocolate. There is a luscious caramel and a bit of brown sugar.  Faintly on the nose is a tad, and I do mean just a tad of green apple.  It's perfect for the style and that hint of apple really adds brightness. There is also the modest whiff of noble hops but nothing really to  even talk about.  The taste is surprisingly sweet.  There is a richness and depth to the malt that is very pleasant. Bready with a bit of the crust, deep and complex sweetness. Caramel and brown sugar.  The green apple is so faint in the drink but provides a bit of crispness. The hops lean on to the palate a bit in the finish with a low amount of bitterness. This finishes with a little residual sweetness. My only complaint about this beer is that it finished with brown sugar and caramel to the point of being a bit too sweet, rather than the breadier , toastier sweetness to linger.","utopiajane","Nov 10, 2014"

The aroma is very nice with roasted malts, caramel and toffee with brown sugar sweetness. The taste is actually pretty smooth with the above flavors mixing well together then followed by the brown sugar sweetness finish. Perfect carbonation.

This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was smooth and not too filling, but the taste didn't do a good job at holding my attention and I think one would be enough for me, I have no urge to drink another one in a row. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel and appearance, they weren't the greatest but they still wound up being the highlights of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was how off it was for the style, this beer doesn't even compare to the last two Schwarzbier's I had and I don't think I would guess the correct style if I tried it blindly. I wouldn't buy this beer again and I wouldn't recommend it as a good Schwarzbier since I don't feel like it does a good job representing the style. All in all I wasn't impressed with this beer and it didn't make for a good first impression for Dixie Brewing company, it was pretty a forgettable especially for the style. Better luck next time guys, this beer need some major work. Of the the three Schwarzbier's I've tried this week this one was the worst and it wasn't even close.","StoutHunter","Nov 14, 2013"

The drinkability is very good. Overall, this is a very good beer. This is one of the first craft beers I ever tried and it helped get me started down the road towards better beer.

I could drink these all day and if this style is your thing (obviously, it's not really mine), this would make a pretty great session beer.","billyzoom666","Feb 09, 2010"

Smell was somewhat caramel like with some faint malt overtones. Taste is straightforward and rather one dementional. Flavors of slighty smoked malt and some dark chocolate towards the finish. Nothing amazing. Mediocre mouthfeel was a bit on the watery and weak side. this brew is miles beyond most macros and has a place in the beer world.

Weak, thin appearance with a dainty white head that falls quickly. Overcarbonated and everso sligh malty sweet scent. No hops in the nose and less toasty or caramel aromas than desired. Taste is too subtle to be appreciated. Thin and watery to the palate. Hopped only to offset sweetness. Minor sweetness remains for only seconds into the aftertaste.

It has a good little head to it that lasts for a little while. The taste is thick and rich of malty chocolate. Has a little bite in the beginning, but goes down easy and smooth. You have got to try it! Long live Dixie... brewing company!","JISurfer","Dec 13, 2002"
3.45,2.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"The color on the pour a pleasing ruby red and the head modest in size with a frothy texture and the lace sufficient to coat the glass as required, at least by me. Largely malt aromas with hints of sweet caramel, clean and pleasant enough. Start is sweet, the top skinny, and the finish passably hopped and meaningful in its acidity, dry aftertaste and a drinkable average beer.","Gusler","Dec 01, 2002"
3.63,7.7,4.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"pours a lovely dark cranberry color, with some ruby hues. frothy, tan and cherry colored head...leaves a nice lace. nose of honey, black liqorice, prunes, raisins, with some roasted chocolate notes. medium body, crisp on the tongue. i don't think i've tasted a dark lager with any similar flavors before. as it warms a bit, it gets a bit harsh. drink it cold and enjoy the flavor profile. an interesting lager to say the least.","budgood1","Nov 23, 2002"
3.5,3.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a very dark brownish amber color with a medium-foamy and sticky off-white head. Nose is dark chocolate and caramel with some floral notes. Roasted malts really come through in the flavor with notes of coffee and vanilla. Fairly light in the mouth and a bit of a dry finish.","Morris729","Oct 08, 2002"

3.58,6.2,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Pours a dark ruby-brown color with a tan head, and nice lace that goes all the way down the glass. Floral hop aroma with some malt and a slight roast smell. Medium body and a light mouthfeel. Rich malt flavor with hints of fruit, toast, and caramel. Hops are not nearly as present in taste as they are in aroma. Very drinkable.","Lupe","0"
3.95,17.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Nice dark ruby color that had moderate, long-lasting head with nice lacing.  The smell was big hops, which smelled nice, but overpowered the malt.  The flavor was fairly simple---roasted/coffee like.  The malt was almost non-existent and the hops were not as prominent as they were in the aroma, but still there.  So, the taste was good, but the mouthfeel was a bit thin, yet the flavor lingered.  A not outstanding beer, but a welcome change from the macros and very drinkable due to the lightness and good flavor.","ryanocerus","Aug 09, 2002"
3.83,13.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Very dark brownish in color with brilliant ruby highlights and a creamy tan head that drops quickly but leaves a very good lace. The aroma is surprisingly hoppy (quite floral) with some light, toasty maltiness beneath. The body is medium, and the carbonation level is moderate. The mouthfeel is lightly zesty. The flavor is fairly rich with some limited dark fruitiness and a toasty, and gently caramel maltiness; however, the hop flavor is much more limited than the aroma suggests. It finishes quick and dry. Towards the end of the glass it develops a slight bittersweet chocolate quality. An interesting beer that is well worth trying. IMHO, Dixie's best beer. It would also make a great crossover beer at summer BBQ's or holiday get togethers!","NeroFiddled","Aug 08, 2002"
3.16,-6.2,4,3,3,3,3.5,"Dark and malty, but very carbonated. It didn't exaclty fit with the look and flavor of the beer. Being a fan of dark beers, it was kind of a letdown. As a Schwarzbier however it had a nice flavor.","Dogbrick","Jul 26, 2002"

1.95,-42.1,3,3,1.5,1.5,1.5,"Deep blackish color, nice, almost-hoppy aroma. Tastes awful, it has a chemical taste like when you've been at the cleaners too long.  Oily, clinging flavor that is not a pleasant hops-oil, but more of a sticky bad taste that just will not go away. As it warms up, it does not get any better.  Pass it by.","jackndan","Jun 17, 2002"
3.53,4.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured a very dark amber color.  It formed a light tan head that left some lace.  The aroma was of herb and malt.  The flavor was of malt and some herb.  The overall finish was a touch bitter.  I found the body to be a bit weak.  Really not a lot that impressed me with this one.","Wildman","May 27, 2002"
3.35,-0.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Dark deep brown and clear, off white head lasts for a decnet time. Small lace traces down the glass. Smells lightly roasted with a hint of spice. Tasts somewhat sweet and rich, chewey almost. Slight smoke flavor contradicts the clove/cinamon spice.  Hard to make this a session beer, but worth a try.","psugrad98","May 23, 2002"
3.69,9.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,4,"A clear deep amber, head is about 1/2 of an inch but pretty fleeting.  Sweet aroma, a little like honey.  Flavor is very sweet, too sweet, phenolic with some notes of vanilla.  Hops seem to impart a cinnamon-like zest, but not enough to balance the brew.  Finishes light.  Interesting, but not a favorite of mine.","ADR","May 01, 2002"
3.75,11.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Head is initially average sized, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing. Body is dark brown, but when light hits it the color turns into an interesting dark ruby color. Pleasant on the nose with aromas containing moderate notes caramel, toasted light bread, herbs, and notes of vanilla. Flavor is moderately sweet, vanilla and caramel tones, a little acidic. Overall this was very interesting, and an enjoyable brew","WilliamPhilaPa","Apr 29, 2002"
3.92,16.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The attractive tan head tops a deep garnet and very clear brew. An attractive lace is left down the glass.  There's a sweet caramel malt as well as mild coffee - like chocolate malt in aroma, but there's a mild herbal hop nose as well.  It's definitely got a more complex aroma compared to other examples of the style.  The smooth, easy - going mouthfeel and light body provide for good drinkability.  Flavorwise, this is more assertive than the typical boring American Dark Lager.  Hop bitterness is above the norm and roasted grain flavors are mellow, but aren't hidden. Although not a particularly complex brew, this is much better than average for style.  Pretty tasty.","marc77","Jan 07, 2002"
3.23,-4.2,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"I'd say it was ink colored but it's not that bad.  ;-)  It has a good toaster mollases taste to it but a bit thin. I had it in New Orleans during a nice hot day. It was served overly cold which probably took away from my enjoyment of the beer but helped me through the day. It smells like a hersey bar.","packetknife","Aug 10, 2001"
2.96,-12.2,4,3,3,2,3,"A light bodied dark lager. Probably has more of a "cult" following rather than being sustained on it's own merit. Attractive color, however it's lack of depth is a bit misleading.","John","Beers"
3.66,8.6,4,3,4,3,4,"A black beer which is lighter in taste than color.  Mildly hopped with caramel notes.  Despite its color, this lager is actually fairly light and pretty good as a hot weather beer.","Brent","0"
