3.9,10.2,4,4,3.75,4,4,"Overall, at first taste this beer seemed subdued, but as the ale warmed the flavor greatly expanded... great smoke presence and good malt balance. The malt flavors are neutralized by the smoke but the flavors compliment. Another very nice Maine beer.","mvanaskie13","Apr 29, 2014"

3.63,2.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,"The taste is a lot like Smoked Cheddar cheese. The smokiness does not meld as well with the malts but instead it has a kind of buttery flavor and a lightly mild bitterness at the end. Smoked beers are high on my style list and this one has some good points but not quite to the level I would have hoped.","puboflyons","Aug 05, 2013"
3.67,3.7,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a dark mahogany brown with a one finger off-white head with good retention and lacing. Light aroma of caramel malt and campfire smoke. Flavor of charred malt, light caramel malt, smokehouse, faint dark fruit that is hard to detect under the smokiness. Light bodied with peppery active carbonation. An interesting rauchbier, but has a fairly light malt bill and little flavor other than the smokiness. The smoke is nice and tastes natural, but could use some other interesting flavors to support it in the background. The carbonation in this bottle was a little overachieving and distracted from the light flavors. Glad I tried it, but probably would not repeat.","LiquidAmber","Jul 27, 2013"

3.73,5.4,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall though, this is a pretty darn good example of the style. Can't think of too many other American made Rauchs that are this good or close to the German textbook greatness producers (Schlenkerla). I could have this anytime, worth drinking again.","smakawhat","Sep 22, 2012"

3.72,5.1,4,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Smoky, smoky, smoky. Beautiful dark color and woodsmoke aroma. This is an intense beer. It tastes like your clothes smell after a campfire. That's part good, and part bad. For uniqueness I give it a 5, but for drinkability, I give it a 2. I split a bomber with 2 other people, and that was plenty to get the full flavor of this old German style beer. It's a beer I will be talking about for awhile, but I don't know how often I will drink it...","GuyIncognito","Sep 17, 2012"
3.27,-7.6,3,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,"Solid delivery of smoked malt flavors but lacks depth. The mouthfeel leaves me asking for more.","cbutova","Aug 08, 2012"
3.09,-12.7,2.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Decent. Kind of interesting flavor profile, some smokiness there but felt a little weak overall.","Chico1985","Jun 02, 2012"
3.37,-4.8,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Will pour a five+ finger cream head that fades slowly, leaving a good lace. Cloudy dirty amber color. Strong carbonation and medium bodied. Smoky nose and flavor is sweet smoke and caramel. $6.70 for a 22oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me.","jdhilt","Apr 25, 2012"
3.88,9.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a ruby-auburn coloring with a beige head that quickly settles into a filmy ring. Aroma is rich and meaty, with a solid charcoal smoke character. The flavors are roasted, with a nutty and caramel sweet backbone. Carbonation keeps the body lighter than most Rauchbiers. The aftertaste is smokey, with a dark, nutty sweetness underlying. Smooth finish seals up a solid brew.","GarthDanielson","Beers"
