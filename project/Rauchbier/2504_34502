3.99,9.3,3.75,4,4,4,4,"I suspect this beer is homage to Roger Baylor’s well-known love of smoked Franconian rauchbiers. I find this to be a well-balanced and easily drinkable smoked beer. It is so drinkable that it would be easy to gloss over the subtle, yet present, layers of this enjoyable beer. I am confident this would pair well with anything from your grill or smoker this summer.","Cresant","May 22, 2014"

4.27,17,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"When the bottle foamed out of the top just a wee little bit and it was über foam on the pour, I was concerned. Apparently without warrant. This is an outstanding rauch. Mild smoked tones keep things at what I want to say is a perfect tone. This can so easily go obnoxious. This is a real pleasure to drink. Don't want to write about it; just want to enjoy drinking it.","RblWthACoz","Dec 09, 2012"
3.8,4.1,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall it's not bad. I appreciate the highish ABV, but could do without the watery feel. Really an attractive looking and smelling beer, just loses it a bit after that.","RickS95","Nov 24, 2012"

3.5,-4.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Really cool name for a beer. The beer is black with a small brown head. The aroma brings some lager scents, roast, smoke. The flavor lacks cohesion. I love the idea of combining the attributes of a black lager and a smoke beer, but this marriage just doesn't make it. Slightly sweet, with some chocolate and smoke notes. Medium bodied with adequate carbonation. Overall, this was ok.","Huhzubendah","Sep 19, 2012"

4.12,12.9,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Black body with not even a finger of medium brown head even with an extra aggressive pour. Nose has a tad of campfire smoke, brown sugar, toasty malts, chocolate and some sweeter caramel/marshmallow qualities. Tate has more chocolate and smokey sweetness, mild roast and a sweet malt quality well into the finish. Smoke as an accent there really. Medium heavy feel, low carbonation which although I thought would've been detrimental to the mouthfeel actually aided the beer. Smokey and on the sweeter side, something I definitely dig.","liamt07","Jul 01, 2012"

3.99,9.3,3.5,4.5,4,3,4,"22 ounce bottle. Served in a mug, the beer pours a very dark brown with a huge carbonated dark tan head. Once the head settled down some, a slow pour helped keep the carbonation down some when pouring the rest of the bottle into the glass. Head retention is good, and there's also a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is very nice, it smells like smoked malts (and meats), roasted/charred malt, bittersweet chocolate, caramel and coffee. It tastes like smoked malt/meat, roasted/charred malt, coffee and some bittersweet chocolate. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy, but has way too much carbonation. Even though the carbonation did settle down some while I was drinking it, it was still a bit too much for me in the end. Overall I thought this was a good brew, I'll try this again in the future and hope that the carbonation in the next bottle isn't as strong as this one was. $7.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Apr 19, 2012"

4.17,14.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Bonfire of the Valkyries pours a medium bodied, smooth and creamy black in color looking all the part of a Schwarzbier. It has a nice beige lacing around the glass. The nose is slightly smoky with some ham and salt before finishes smooth, chocolaty, and creamy. The smoke isn't nearly as strong as I imagined it would be, but that's a good thing. There isn't much smoke in the flavors either, but it's there. It's smooth and creamy dark chocolate with a light hammy finish. It's like a slightly smoked version of Sprecher's Black Bavarian. The body is near identical, light and very, very smooth and creamy. Overall this was a really nice beer. I'd definitely say it's a schwarzbier that's slightly smoked, and not necessarily a rauchbier. It's a nice alternative if you don't want to get smoked out by Aecht Schlenkerla.","aasher","Apr 10, 2012"

It's not the best rauchbier I've ever had, but it is interesting and quite drinkable. I still think New Albanian's strength lies in their strong ales, but I wouldn't mind picking this lager up again.","mrfrancis","Feb 02, 2011"
4.17,14.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"O – Much better than I expected, and very easy to drink. I am glad the smoke was not overpowering. Quite drinkable and I might go back and get a bomber of this brew.

4.52,23.8,4,4.5,5,4,4,"D- This beer was mighty drinkable. I personally enjoy heavy smoked beers which this one leaned more toward being heavy in the smoke taste. The ABV makes this one enjoyable while drinking. I had many glasses of this but I know some of the other guys didn't like this one very much.","alleykatking","Beers"
3.9,6.8,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Pours a dark brown/black with a finger of tan head.  Smells roasty, a little smoky and a hint of sweet malt.  Tastes some roasted malts, hints of chocolate, some smokyness and coffee, but really balanced.  Slightly drying finish, but a good mouthfeel and drinkable. One of the better beers I've had in this style.","Lukafer","0"
3.97,8.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Solid schwarzbier. It's pitch black in appearance and smells of roast coffee and chocolate. The foam lacing doesn't stick for too long. The taste is very similar to the smell. Black malt must have been a key ingredient. Some vanilla lingers in the back with a possibility of liquid smoke! easy to drink, not too sticky.","bgreg3","Dec 16, 2010"

4.32,18.4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Served at the Tomlinson Tap Room in Indy. Appearance was totally black, with not much carbonation and very little, tan colored head. Aroma is not very strong, but smells of roasted malt primarily with some sweetness and a faint hint of smoke. The flavor is great, with smooth maltiness, roasted coffee and chocolate lightly blending with a touch of smoke. Very smooth and drinkable. Medium to full bodied. A very nice beer.","AaronHomoya","Dec 30, 2006"
3.67,0.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"D - Not my fave of the ales offered at NABC, but still drinkable and better than average IMO. A big smokey ale that can get to be a bit much if you have more than a pint of smoked ale. I consider this quaffable and would be a nice complement to and smoked cheese or meat assortment","Slatetank","Beers"
4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"On tap at Rich-O's Publick House as part of the Saturnalia Fest. Bonfire arrived dark and opaque in the glass, topped by a small, but creamy, light brown head. Sheet lacing is left behind on the glass as it empties. Aroma is wood smoke, minimal spicy hops, and cocoa and espresso notes. Creamy medium body. Taste is smoky, but not overdone. Nice edge of bitter hops to compliment the slightly roasty tones of mild coffee and light milk chocolate. A very enjoyable version of the style.","merlin48","0"
