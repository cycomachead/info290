3.24,-15.8,4,3.75,3,3,3,"500ml bottle served in a stange. Pours the color and clarity of cola with a fizzy, one inch, tan-colored head. Head eventually settles into a 1/8th inch cap with some residual strands of lacing left in the wake of the receding brew. Nose suggests chocolate malt, roast and a hint of coffee. Taste is roasty with a metallic quality in the forefront. Chocolate character is almost non-existent and the overall flavor profile comes off a bit watered down. Finish is slightly bitter and lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light and a bit watery with a prickly carbonation. Overall, I have to say that I'm a bit disappointed by this one. Definitely not getting a rauchbier vibe either - not sure if it is classified correctly.","Jwale73","Jan 31, 2014"

If I had an issue with this really fine beer, it would be that it verges on being out of balance, although the combination of pronounced flavors don't obscure its lager basis. Although cold this evening, the weather isn't quite bad enough to warrant drinking this hefty and delicious black lager. Flakes may be necessary.","BeerIsland","Nov 14, 2013"

Pours nice and dark, smell of roasted coffee and faint smoke. About a finger head, and that was from a pretty vigorous pour. No retention to speak of, no lacing either. Taste is awesome, roasted coffee up front, mild smoke (not nearly as much as i would like, but this isn't targeted to a rauchhead like me.)

Poured a massively dark red-brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, powdered chocolate, roasted malt, cream, and coffee. The flavor was of sweet malt, cream, coffee, milk chocolate, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. Based on the other brews from Jack’s Abby that I’ve had, they have the aroma aspect of beers absolutely nailed. Nice notes of sweetness and roastiness from the coffee going on kept this one really well balanced and enjoyable to the nose. The flavor had some of the same notes, but it just wasn’t as robust and well balanced as the aroma going on. Still definitely worth your time trying if you get the chance.","thagr81us","Dec 25, 2012"

3.97,3.1,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"What an interesting beer. I like the idea, coffee with the S&D makes perfect sense, but I almost wish it was bigger. The coffee doesn’t overpower, but the lager really doesn’t give it enough backbone. You almost need a double or imperial S&D to give it some more girth. Otherwise the clean lagered body with the coffee just makes it taste like watered down coffee. Great coffee, but watered down. It’s still a really great beer though, despite what might read like my negative review. Kudos to JA for pushing the envelope. Who makes a coffee rauchbier?","taez555","0"
