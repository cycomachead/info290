Looks alright, while the aroma and flavour are intensely smoky and woody. Hints of smoked meat/fish and fruitiness can be discerned. Decent body. Lingers long on the palate. Tasty; if you're a fan of rauchbiers then this is certainly worth sampling.","jazzyjeff13","Oct 14, 2013"

4.31,14,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Poured into a glass mug. The beer pours dark caramel brown with a thin off-white head and some yeast sediment. The head lingers for a long time. The beer is wonderfully smoky with hints of caramel and chocolate. There's some of that breadiness from the smoked malt as well. The flavor is malty, slightly sweet, and smoky. The smokiness lingers in the mouth along with some mild back end bitterness. I get some of those chocolate notes as well, but they're faint. The body is medium to full with low carbonation. The beer coats the mouth, allowing for a smoky aftertaste to linger. The beer is pretty easy to drink. This is an excellent beer. It's not quite up there with the German rauchbiers, but it's not far off.","acevenom","Jan 22, 2013"

Smell is of smoked malt, campfire, and smoked meats and cheeses. Taste is much the same with a slight adhesive bandage flavor and a very smokey aftertaste. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some nice aromas and flavors for the style.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 22, 2012"

Taste is also a good mix between some smoke notes with some medium sweet caramelized malt backbone. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Nice balance between smoke notes and caramelized sugar with provides a great drinking experience.","Phyl21ca","Mar 12, 2012"

Aroma of smoked meat and mild malt. Flavor is a very pleasant, rich malt and smoke with light fruit flavors fleetingly present. Finish is smooth smoke and sweet malt. Creamy medium to heavy bodied, nice. This is a very distinctive and flavorful rauchbier. Very well integrated with a very interesting flavor progression. I'm very impressed and will buy this again.","LiquidAmber","Jan 06, 2012"

There's some nuttiness and caramel with hints of toffee on the finish. Much more intense than the aroma. The feel has a quite creamy feel, medium bodied. Overall, this is quite nice.

3.97,5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Dots of white lace stick to the glass of this amber brown colored beer. The nose brings out a modest smoke note and cured meat, also some sweet malt. For those afraid of a really smokey beer, you don't need to be afraid this Dutch brew. The smoke is modest, but a sweet smoke. It's almost like candied bacon. More commonly found is the marzen-like maltiness and sweetness. Fairly smooth and light medium bodied, which helps make this a pleasant beer for anytime.","DoubleJ","Aug 30, 2011"
3.8,0.5,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Poured an almost brown amber body w/ one finger offwhite head that died slow on top of a strong, roasted malt aroma w/ some smokiness but a rather mild smokey aroma; not overpowering or "beef jerkyish". For a rauchbier this brew tones down the dry, roasted malts in favor of a slightly smoother, creamier version. Don't get me wrong, the smoke is there and it is good and I like the sweet notes and a touch of minor grassy hops on the finish for a slight prick on the tongue, but when I think of rauchbiers I tend to think of real dry and smokey.","clayrock81","Jun 24, 2011"

Served from bottle into a Mother Earth strange. Poured red-orange with a one and a half finger off-white head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, smoke, and ham. The flavor was of sweet malt, smoke, ham, and pulled pork. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty tasty brew. Massive amounts of smoked meat flavors going on in this one. Honestly tasted like I was at a BBQ and has made me one to plan one for this summer now! Reason being is that I wish I had some to go with this brew. It will definitely be present when I have a BBQ next time. Great aroma and flavor going on in this one. A very nice example of the style and a must try in my opinion!","thagr81us","Apr 15, 2011"

3.53,-6.6,3.5,3,4,3,3.5,"pours a hazy, thick mud brown with clear shades of a nut-brown, too. Smells of sweet, bock-like malt with some kind of smokish notes. Pleasant and pretty clean, but too much like a doppel bock. The smoked malt comes through a lot more in the flavor. It does come through as strong as Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier, but perhaps the difference is what makes this one nice, but not as good. I'd say this one tastes more like 'smoke' that meat that has been smoked. It's not a strong bacon or smoked salmon flavor that makes the other classic examples good, but not extremely drinkable in high frequency.","100floods","Jan 31, 2011"

The taste and mouthfeel was on the money. A nice amount fo smokiness, which means a subtle amount. It was there and noticable, but mostly towards the end of the palate. A perfect amount to compliment a smokey food, or to contrast with something less robust. Very creamy motuhfeel. Excellent.","TheDoorman","Nov 07, 2010"
4.2,11.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"a rather exceptional beer when it comes to food accompaniment with a excellenct balance of smoked malt, and dark fruit qualities. pour is cloudy dark orange/amber with about two fingers of nearly white head. nose is plum, black berry and smokey camp fire. palate is first off smokey as expected. but a dryness that is equal to the citrus notes of the hops... palate has a meaty black currant to it, plum and blackberries like in the nose but with a quality of subtle cherry yogurt. this beer has not in any way gone bad. its very subtle and it may be because i have it with liver, shallots and kale in balsamic vinegar but it brought out some fantastic potential in the range.","rtepiak","Sep 13, 2010"

Smells of sweet malt, smoke, slight roasted malt, hint of alcohol, and an odd bacon grease aroma that is amazing. Fits the style of a Rauchbier. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of smoke, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, hops, hint of citrus, and a hint of yeast.

3.98,5.3,4,3.5,4,5,4,"Pours a cloudy chestnut brown with a big thick frothy head that is still around at the very last sip. I got subdued aromas of woody smoke, bbq pork and a bit of dark fruit. Flavors are much of the same, not as smokey as I like it but I really like the smoke flavor. Thought that I got more wood and well seasoned meat, salty Chinese bbq pork ribs is what I am thinking. In fairness I should mention that I am drinking this with a nicely seasoned Rib Eye for dinner. Extremely smooth and really perfect on the palette, Excellent! I would drink this all night but honestly not as flavorful as the Schlenkerla Urbier or Marzen, but very nice still and it is it's own beer. Over all very nice and would get again.","thepeter","Aug 20, 2010"
3.9,3.2,4,4,3.5,4,4.5,"VDubb hearkens back to his family's roots with his selection, a continuation of the Leaving Falls Church uber-bender. This conspirator pours a clear russet topped by a finger or so of creamy ecru foam. The nose is definitely dominated by charred smoke, though some honey-drizzled ham sits savoringly in the clear-aired background. There's a vague sweetness in there as well. The taste focuses more on the ham to begin with, a slice of pineapple laying on top; the smoke comes in near the end, diminished in strength since the smell. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda crisp finish. Overall, this is a pretty decent rauch, though a bit light on the smoke for me. Still, it is very smooth and seems to go down insanely easily.","TMoney2591","Jul 27, 2010"
