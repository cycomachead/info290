4.38,6.1,5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"500 ml bottle into pine glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly cloudy deep reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of huge wood smoke, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, oak, light chocolate, light char, herbal, and oak/smokey earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, smoke, and earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big wood smoke, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, oak, light chocolate, light char, herbal, and toast/smokey earthiness. Light herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of wood smoke, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, oak, light chocolate, light char, and herbal/smoke earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of dark/bready malt and smoke flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavors as well with zero estery notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible rauchbier style. All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, smoke, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 23, 2015"

I can understand how it would be a turn off, but for me it worked. The taste was surprisingly malty and sweet. However, the finish has a bitter, dry and smoky finish which lingers in your taste buds. A very robust, full bodied and filling beer; one is quite enough. Overall, I would have this one once in a while and with a hearty meaty meal. I'm glad I tried it and I hope to get to know more of this style.","Gajo74","Jan 10, 2015"

Even more intensive and sweeter than the "Schlenkerla MÃ¤rzen", but all in all quite similar, which is, in this case, not a bad thing. Smoked maltiness lingers on the tongue for a while, but not too intensive. Carbonation is well in balance with the overall medium-body, not too notable, adding up to a slightly too sweet and otherwise smooth mouthfeel.","aleigator","Nov 04, 2014"
4.61,11.6,4,4.75,4.75,4.25,4.5,"Pours a lovely dark amber with a distinct dark ruby cast that is slightly darker than their Marzen variant . Good head, lacing and retention. Outstanding nose of meaty bacon like smoke against an underlying dark fruit (plum, fig) note over a slightly sweet base. Medium body with a creamy slick texture.  Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish.  Compared to their Marzen variant, Urbock has slightly less head characteristics, slightly more carbonation and more body and texture.  The superb flavor profile is even more outstanding in that it obtains a higher degree of balance by being slightly sweeter and coats the tongue with a slick layer of bacon like smoke.  The flavor profile is a masterpiece of intensity, balance and complexity. The delicious smoke character is always present, but never overpowering. It begins with a campfire bacon like smoke over a moderately sweet background that has dark fruit characteristics. The middle allows the hops to impart a low level bitterness that has a citric note as it effervesces. The finish is less dry than the Marzen, somewhat crisp, slightly sweet and leaves you with a touch of dark fruit and a lingering smokiness as if you've sitting around a campfire. World Class and ever so slightly better than the Marzen variant.","tillmac62","Nov 03, 2014"

Deep smokiness in the nose, which corresponds to the flavor. Like delicious slow-smoked pork, with just a hint of malty sweetness. A bit effervescent on the tongue, almost overwhelming the taste profile. But overall, very very good.","QueerBeer","May 09, 2014"

Rather than the smoke being overpowering or playing second fiddle to a sweet Bock beer, both flavor elements combined in a truly masterful brew. The ABV on this one isn't too high at only 6.6%, but if you LIKE a Rauchbier, this one will really sneak up on you since it is so smooth and easy to drink. A must try.","Beric","Apr 17, 2014"

4.7,13.8,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"What's especially impressive about Urbock is that, despite its dominant smoke flavors, it doesn't send me into "smokey bacon and barbecued meats" land. Sure, those flavors are present, but there's a sophistication in this beer's flavor profile that is absent from any of the other smoked beers I've tasted in this style. I think that the malty backbone of the duppelbock style deserves some of the credit. But most of it goes to the brewers at Aecht Schlenkerla, who have produced something special here.","GMB","Feb 10, 2014"

Aroma is alder smoke big time over a mild beery underpinning. Smooth going down, the adler smoke is not as evident in the taste as the aroma but very very nice indeed mixed perfectly with a caramelly malt and tiny grassy hop flavor. Eminently drinkable. The 16.9 oz is disappearing quickly! Spectacular with pork.","atomicbeer","Feb 07, 2014"

Head is half an inch, loose and cream-colored and dissipates into a sudsy slick that coalesces around the edges. Nose reveals smoked meat and a suggestion of raisins or prunes in the background. Taste is much more rounded and pleasantly subdued than suggested by the nose, with the smokey quality not so tied to the meat character.

Nose is intensely smoky...so much so that I can smell the smoke emanating from the glass 1&1/2 feet away from me as I jot down the tasting notes! The taste is wonderfully smoky, sweet & pungent with excellent mouthfeel, not much in the way of hoppiness here, but when there's this much flavor packed into a beer like this it's hardly missed! Finishes long with huge notes of smokiness with sweet malts coming in behind. Just a fantastic example of the Brewers art here! For the novice: try it, if you don't like it...try it again. It may take 3 or 4 bottles, but once you acquire the taste it's nothing short of one of the greatest drinking experiences you'll ever have!","beerluvr","Jun 07, 2013"

Pairs extremely well with dutch cheeses, the flavor is so satisfying that I could sip on this all day. Will be buying this whenever I see it. This has moved into my top 10, and perhaps into my top 5 after a few more tastings. As a huge fan of Hefeweizens and KÃ¶lsch beer from Germany, there is a similar taste down to the yeast, and this takes all the smoothness and craftsmanship and adds a whole new level of flavor. Please, do yourself a favor and buy a bag of your favorite beef jerky and one or two of these and make an evening of it.","Roman5150","Apr 04, 2013"

Smooth milk chocolate and caramel set off this urbock. If you search, the smoothness may even tell your brain that vanilla is present. With the smoke as its backbone, it creates an interesting mix. A smokey caramel taste continues into the aftertaste which lingers because of a mildly thick mouthfeel. Smoke beers are not for everybody, but there is little doubt who makes the best.

Thin clumps and streaks of lace cling to the glass on the drink down. Smell is all about the smoke but in a more subtle was than the Marzen: smoked meat, smoked cheese, campfire, etc. I am getting a slight whiff of malt if I search for it. Taste is also of the aforementioned smoked items with a nice sweet malt that supports everything. The smoke flavors aren't as powerful in the aftertaste compared to the Marzen, leaving more of a sweet and subtle roast flavor. This beer has a nice mouthfeel with a solid body and a crisp amount of carbonation. Overall, this is a very good rauchbier and hands down my favorite of the Schlenkerla beers I have tried thus far.","UCLABrewN84","Dec 22, 2011"

The taste is similar to the aroma, it's mainly smoked meats/malt, but there's also some wood, caramel malt and a bit of sweet dark fruit noticeable, too.

The beer poured out as a dark brown with a generous amount of head on it. The head settled leaving a touch of lacing on the glass. The smell reminded me of bacon, it's had the smokiness of fresh cooked bacon and that was about all on the nose. The taste of the beer was also smokey and even what I found to be a little salty. The mouthfeel was smooth but the flavors kept the drinkability to a minimum for me. Overall I have to say that for a smoked beer it really has those elements all over it. It's not really my favorite style all that much. It is good for those who like them.","Knapp85","Jul 12, 2011"

It smells of smoked ham, wood chips, and oak. It's full on ham and is close to Krebs Smoked Porter and the Alaskan Smoked Porter in terms of the nose. The flavor is a little subdued compared to the aromas. It has good flavor and is very heavy on the ham, but subdued compared to other smoked beers that I've had. I do enjoy this one however. It's the lightest smoked beer that I can say that I really like. This is like hog light in a bottle.

The nose comprises smoked bacon, toffee, and clean cedar. The taste puts a bit more char into the smoke and a touch more cedar into everything. The toffee is toned down a decent amount, allowing the slightly maple-y smoke to run as wild as it wants.

Good amount of active carbonation. Intense smoke aroma; meaty and earthy. Rich, robust malts create a slightly sweet odor. The flavor is not quite as smoky; instead of overpowering, the smoke complements a sweet and complex malt profile. Slight floral hop flavor with a nice balancing bitterness. Light to medium in body with a substantial yet airy mouthfeel.

The taste was immensely smokey at first, with a malty dissolve, and a slight coffee finish, with a smoke aftertaste. Thicker yet more carbonated than expected, which eased the intake commensurately. Truly an excellent specimen of the style, if not the bellwether.","donniecuffs","Jul 16, 2010"

3.56,-13.8,4,3,3.5,4,4,"This one has a nice cherry-stained wood appearance, clear, with some tan rocky head that leaves a little lacing. Pretty color, better head than the marzen. Smell is ok, some smokiness and some nuttiness, though it is quite muted. Taste is pretty good, some nice charred smoke flavors with some nuttiness and a bit of maltiness in there. My only complaint is that the smoke flavors aren't quite as rich and flavorful as some other rauchbiers I've had--this one flirts with the ashy side of smoke, which I do not like. It doesn't go quite as far on the ashiness as Weyerbacher's Fireside Ale, but it's not perfect. I'm looking for flavors of roasted pork, BBQ, etc. Medium mouthfeel, clean and light on the palate, without moving too fast to get any flavor. Decent drinkability, though the ashiness came out as the bottle came along, making it a bit tougher toward the end.","LordAdmNelson","Jun 17, 2010"

It retains the phenomenal, meaty, charred scent characteristic of Aecht's brews, but with a slightly richer flavor that's more in line with what one would expect of such a well-presented beverage. Mouthfeel, again, is slightly more watery than I'd hope, but still drinkable, and the taste lingers pleasantly in the mouth for a while. Would probably buy again.","ufotofuturo","Jun 08, 2010"

The only problem is though I'd like to drink more than one of these, after a while the taste buds become used to the smokiness and smoked meat that it offers and it becomes less potent and mind blowing as I near the end of the bottle. The palate becomes accumulated to it. However this is prolly the fourth or fifth bottle I've had in the span of two months. For a single beer that costs about six dollars thats pretty regular.

The smoky, bitter and prune like sweet fruity flavors of the smooth, creamy and slightly greasy fluid correspond to the aromas. Excellent, without any harsh, burnt or charred flavors. This brew brings a sensation of small cooking chambers blackened from smoke & soot that were in use in ancient times and can still be seen in preserved rustic farm houses.

Flavor's the same with a little malt and dark ripe fruit sweetness. Body is decent and so is carbonation. Finish is pretty much smoke. And then there's the smokiness. Don't notice the alcohol much.

When I want to have a rauchbier this one will jump to front of mind for sure. Rotation - not avail in TX so got as an extra. If avail here, I'd have every couple months. As-is, keep trading for it.

Aroma of sweet smoke, faint milk chocolate and blackstrap molasses.

Wow that's a little much huh? Finishes with a nice clean crisp bitterness that leaves the palate clear and ready for another sip.

The flavor is good and smoky without being completely dominated by meat or smoke. The malt is a bit lighter and simpler than expected, but there's more hops and bitterness. It's warm with notes of fruit (berries), sweet coffee and citrus. The mouthfeel is a tad thin but not too bad.

At first it's about all you taste...bottled campfire, but it's not as heavy on the smokiness as the Marzen. The emphasis on the malts, mostly caramel come through much more as the beer warms a bit, woody taste and a touch of I think maple is in here. There is definitely a sweeter finish too it that linger on the tongue. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, a bit of an oily feel to it. This is a great beer.

Strong odor of campfire and beef jerky. The taste complements the smell very well. Acrid jerky, ham, and burnt log taste. Sounds unappealing but is very common for this style of beer.

There are seared meat and jerky aromas, charcoal, wood, anything that resembles a grill or campfire. A big smoke and meat flavor punches upfront but the Urbock has a malt backbone that punches back, unlike their other offerings. Nice char flavor, along with wood and peat, and rounded out with a lightly roasted malt. This is what I imagine an old, old, old, old school beer tasting like. The feel is still fairly light for such a strong flavored brew. It has soft carbonation with a sweet (and savory) finish. I feel that I should be eating a leg of cow or something. The pinnacle of smoked brews, can't get more smokey, except for the other brews in their lineup. This one is tops due to a nice malt presence. Can't drink a lot of these but look forward to having one by my fire pit come colder weather.","Gmann","Aug 30, 2008"

This is a great example of the style, and should be sought out if you have never had a smoked beer. It is quite strong tasting with a medium to heavy body.

The taste is different from what the nose would indicate. There is a sweet malt flavor upfront with some almost molasses like tastes to it. The smokiness is still there with a more meaty flavor but balances well with the beer overall. A light roasty finish only accentuates the meaty presence.

As for taste and mouthfeel, this was my first smokebeer, so I was taken aback by the flavors a bit. If you can get past the intense burnt wood smell, you will notice that the beer itself is rather smooth, malty, and quite crisp. Very light on the tongue yet chewy at the same time if you can believe that. As for drinkability, this is definitely not a session beer, and it should definitely be paired with something grilled on the backyard BBQ. The smokiness would go well with steaks and ribs; its crispness and levity would go well with chicken and pork.

On the palate, the smoke is there and up front, but the initial taste of this beer is quite sweet, with bock-y malts (molasses, big time) showing through. The smoke mixes well with those malts in the mid-palate, while the finish switches with a snap over to pure smoke. The finish holds on for a while. Pretty smooth mouthfeel, owing to the huge malt component, but drinkability, without a food to match this with, is pretty low.

The taste is more of the same delivered on a wave of startlingly strong carbonation. An intense smokiness...let's call it bacon.

Aroma is very smoke-like, as can be expected. Also noted were elements of rich, roasted malts and an earthy overtone. One can tell that this is a serious brew, for the true beer lover. Flavor is badass, with tones of smoke, herbs, and a slight sweetness. Nearly perfectly balanced. Finished with an almost tangy note of smoke that seemed slighly salty. A truely amazing beer.

The smoke is so big, it is hard to get the nuances of the beer underneat the smoke. I really like it. Wow. The feel is a light moderate with a light carbonation.

A couple of floaties where seen doing what they do bestÂfloating around. I was skeptical about the ability for a beer to really smell like smoke. I was expecting some heavily toasted malt flavor, but low and behold this really does smell like smoke. There is quite a distinct hickory and oak wood smoke to this and reminds me of some of the local barbeque pits I have around home. Additionally there is a quite recognizable sweet malt aroma which is highlighted by some dark fruit essences. The taste is quite unique and immediately biting on the tongue which covers up some of the initial flavors. Regardless of that I detect essences of the ripe dark fruit which was in the aroma and only some subtle flavors of backwoods campfire. The smoke flavor doesnÂt come through in the main body of this beer but towards the finish after the biting sensation has all but passed. Good flavor overall but I was expecting a bit more in the smoke in the flavor department. Mouthfeel is very heavy and it definitely feels that way in my stomach. The extremely heavy mouthfeel brings the drinkability down a bit. This is definitely a beer to try due to its uniqueness.","blitz134","Apr 04, 2005"

There is sweet caramel maltiness, charcoal smokiness, and and nice dose of salty bacon fat to finish things off. Very big on taste here.

4.52,9.4,4,4.5,5,4,4,"Appearance: Murky mahogany brown with a nice sized tan cream head leaves fine evenly dispersed lacing, not bad. Aroma: Smoked pork you choose variety sausage, bacon, etc. However, this one seems to be much more complex then the Marzen and Weizen from Aecht Schlenkerla. A huge undertow of malt here the bock presence along with alder wood smoking process equals appetizing. Taste: Doesn't destroy or ruin your palate with the smoked meat varieties it opens a whole new realm of balanced flavor between the herbal German hops and bock variety malts with underlying fruit notes masked with the smokiness just tastes incredible. Smoked meats still flow along your palate yet it's not overdone within the Urbock, but definitely a beer you have to be in the mood for. Mouthfeel: Medium body smoked malts give it a heavier tone carbonation is smooth going down. Drinkability: Pure flavorfulness of the malts makes this a slow sipper, however it can still become an addicted oddity of the beer world. The heavily smoked malts start to call out to you and the cravings come for this flavor and then all of a sudden many American micro versions of a rauchbier can never be smokey enough.

4.33,4.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The color of this brew is a deep mahogany, creating a .25 inch mocha colored head after pouring, that dissipates from the center of the glass after 5 minutes, although remains around the edges through the experience. The nose has a moderate malty - smokiness that is similar to a tea called Lapsang Souchong, a tea that is prepared over smoldering pine needles. This particular brew's malt is smoked over smoldering beechwood logs to impart its smoky nose and flavor. The smoky flavor is pronounced and forward, much more so than the nose would suggest. The aftertaste lasts upwards of 1 minute+ The structure of this beer is akin to a brown ale, but an underlying acidity brightens the taste and allows the flavors to emerge from its smoky / peaty confines. The mouth feel is lacking a bit of weight and roundness, but its composition does allow for spirited and effortless consumption, surprisingly so for a brew that has such profound and intense flavors. I would robustly recommend this brew based on the premise of its pure, unadulterated and unusual style. A perfect accompaniment to winter stews and well seasoned meat dishes. This is one of the few Rauchbier's (Smoke Beers), which are prepared and brewed in house start to finish. A superb example of the style!","barknee","Oct 09, 2004"

Medium-bodied with a very smoky character, as a matter of fact it dominates everything else in the beer. The finish is more of the same.

The aroma is that of an intensely smoky grill sprinkled with sugar. The sweet and acrid smell hit me at an armÂs length and nearly put me into a higher orbit with its intensity every time the glass touched my lips. The taste was just as good as the smell with a caramelized sweet maltyness and a smoky bitterness. There were some mildly grassy hop presence, but that was only a secondary pleasure.

The smell of the smoke quickly filled the room leaving not much else the way of smell besides a faint trace of smoked meat I believe was bacon. Following in suit was thee smokiness that dominated the flavor. I started to detect slightly sweet dark fruity malt notes as well as a bit of caramel as this warmed and some of the smoke died down. A bit of a smoky aftertaste lingers around after each sip. This was about lighter medium bodied and hard good carbonation and a smoky coating feel to it. Pretty drinkable stuff once the smoke mellowed out, definitely a beer I would have to be in the mood for. Overall an excellent beer that delivers on the rauchbier experience.

The taste wasn't what I was expected as I have heard only bad about this stuff. I thought the taste was fantastic.

Oh, simply heaven. The mouthfeel is just about right - not too thin, not too thick, delightfully in the middle. Smoky without being astringent, just a enough sweetness to balance it all out.

The initial flavor is of a nonsweet malt like barley but there is a sweetness behind the initial malt base akin to a chocolate/caramel mixture. I notice a oak like flavor in the base of this beer. The finish is more smoky and it lingers. The balance of smokiness to sweetness is very good. I could see this pairing amazingly with any smoked meat.

ItÂs intensely meaty and feels like a meal in itself, very expressive and one that you can smell from far. In this ragard, this can do wonders as a welcome home beer or a barbecue apetizer. It remains rather sweet too with its maple suggestions, peppery and salty, thereÂs even leather and woody flavours in there. This is pretty complex with tons of character. The oldest sharp smoked cheddar youÂll come across. Body is medium-thick, fulfilling with a bit above average carbonation. Mild bitterness in the finish balances from the rather sweet malts. Fantastic. Probably the smokiest beer on the planet and it will never get on your nerves.

The smoke really kicks in at the finish, leaving a dry, almost salty feel in the mouth. Full bodied and *very* full-flavored. This is truly a beer to be experienced!

The smoke flavor is perfect, meaty and not in any way mediciny or like fake smoke in a bottle taste like a lot of smoked beers sadly taste like. For those who don't like beers this smokey...i bet it would be great for marinating...this would make beer brauts even tastier...Still I enjoyed drinking this one....it probably will put hair on your chest...","hollicetales","Feb 02, 2004"
4.1,-0.7,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"This beer is one that you will either love or hate. I loved it. The beer is a mysterious dark brown/black that pours with a slight head. The nose is full of smokiness, and the taste is one of smoked ham/bacon with a big malty underpinning. The smoke becomes less shocking as I made my way through the beer, or perhaps my palette was just overwhelmed. I don't know if I could have more than one of these beers at a sitting, but I wouldn't need to - it really is a meal in itself.","ColForbin","Jan 10, 2004"

3.55,-14,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Clearish dark reddish brown color with a small beige foamy head that fades out quickly leaving some good sticky sheets and strings of lace. Aroma is quite unique with a smokey twinge rendering some hints of bacon, bar-b-que sweetness, and wet ashes. Not much else really comes through but the smokened senses which isn't all that bad but would have liked to seen some more complexity within the aroma with some malts or something. Taste is sweet and tangy with a smokey character that adds subdued salty meats, touches of bar-b-que or mustard sauces, charcoal, and jerky. Overall its not really coming across as anything else but smoke for character, which is fine, but I'd like to see an already good beer then add touches of smoke then take a subpar beer and add lots of smoke to cover up the fact that its really not all that good to begin with. And thats what I'm perceiving with this. Feel is lightly creamy with tangyness and quite smooth and close to medium bodied but has some slight watery notions late in the finish. An OK beer to have an occasion but more or less I think I'll use it to marinate and cook up some porkchops or steak with. I think it'll work very well in that department.","tavernjef","Dec 30, 2003"
4,-3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Let me start off by saying that I never really loved smoked beers before. Well, this one almost changed my mind. This is a murky dark brown liquid with a short-lived tan head of bubbles. The aromas are pure smoke, caramel and chocolate malts, and other roasty bock-like notes. The taste is smoky, but remains very bock-like and malty with a lot of complexities in the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is creamy, but a bit too chewy and the drinkability is good as well. This is a good beer all across the beer, and now I can appreciate smoked beers more. They are still not my favorite, but this one was damn good.","francisweizen","Dec 22, 2003"
4,-3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Definitely a unique beer. This is like drinking pureed beef jerky; now I love jerky (though my beer habit kills my funds for jerky), so this is a definite treat. Quite good, and I'd certainly have this one with barbeque or other such smoked meat.","beergeek279","Dec 21, 2003"

Rather malty tasting despite the big smoky nose. Rather crisp and refreshing. Nice malty bock base in this beer, I'd expect that even if it wasn't smoked, it'd be a world class bock on its own. I could think of a thousand food items that would accompany this beer beautifully. Effervescent and clean. I'd seek this one out again (with some smoked venison jerky and gouda next time though :))","crookedhalo","Nov 16, 2003"

4.32,4.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This pours a rich dark teak color, and despite a rather hard pour, the mostly large bubbly head dissipates, forming a thin beige ring with very little lace. A wonderful smoky malt and slight hop and faint alcohol aroma lasts a fair amount of time, eventually giving way to a pleasant morning after campfire smell. Full bodied and lightly sweet and amply hopped. Robust Maltiness blends well with citrus and spicy hop bitterness. This is an acquired taste that I've acquired while tasting and rating this fantastic brew!","BeerResearcher","Aug 06, 2003"
4.27,3.4,4.5,5,4,4,4,"Great aroma! Smoky molasses malts, barbecue, smoked sausage, oily. Ruby brown clear beer with small off-white head. Considering the aroma, the smoky taste was quite subdued - nice malty sweetness, like a bock. Light sweet finish and tinge of smokiness that I thought was less pronouced than in the maerzen. Mild-medium carb and light oily body. Very nice rauchbier, but not as smoky as the maerzen. Went great with smoked sausages and ham for dinner.","ChicoraBoy","Aug 04, 2003"
3.77,-8.7,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Sweet malt aromas with some smoke, not nearly as much as their marzen which is much more the way I prefer it. Brown in color with some red highlights a small amount of creamy head. Bacon does come through in the flavor but not enough and is quickly overcome by the sweet malt. Pretty nicely complex. If you have to decide between this and the marzen, my word of advice would be to stick with this if you like more malt and less meat and go with the marzen for more meat and less malt.","jreitman","Jul 05, 2003"
4.57,10.7,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"This is probably my new favorite beer. I tried this at my local beer store at a tasteing. The smell is sooooo magnificent. If you wanna know what it smells like, go to a deli or cook something on the grill. The taste is just as good. The biggest suprise of this beer, was it's magnetism at a sorority party I went to last night. Seemed like every 5 seconds, some chick was asking me if they could "taste my smoke beer". I let a few have it and they were hooked. Maybe this could be the next beer at the college parties? Maybe not. You can get a 12pack of natty for $5 and this stuff is $3 a bottle.

4.02,-2.7,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Originally sampled on 26 June 2002. This beer has the beautiful aroma of the best deli you've ever been in. It's the perfect accompanyment to sausages & smoked meat.

4.2,1.7,4,4,4,4,5,"Dark brown color. Medium white foamy head. Aroma is smoked gouda. It sort of like drinking a liquid glass of smoked gouda wrapped around a rasher of bacon. The initial smokiness is somewhat overwhelming, but after the first few sips it settles down into a smoky malty beer. The smokiness is well balanced by the maltyness. Nice beer, if you don't like smoke, don;t bother with this beer, but if you do try this one. World class. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is smoky and slightly bitter.","beerguy101","Jun 10, 2003"

3.6,-12.8,4,4,3.5,4,3,"16 oz. bottle. Murky brown color, tannish bubbly head. Dense, foamy head didn't stay long. Charcoal and smoky aromas ease into your nose. Not overwhelming at all. Smooth smoked wood smell just like the Marzen from this style. Taste is more harsh and acidic, not as smooth. The sourness is more pronounced. Big smoky presence all the way through. Slight stirring of the glass revives the head, and releases some smoked wood smells again. Smoky taste lingers more in this one. Hot aftertaste and burbs that could melt butter from this one. A decent beer once a year or so, the other one was much more smooth. Not a beer to guzzle.","StevieW","Jan 31, 2003"

4.57,10.7,4,4.5,5,4.5,4,"This beer was poured into the glass a simple medium brown color until it was held to the light, then the ruby red showed through. The head was brown/beige in color, and the lace slid down the glass almost the whole way to the finish. The aroma was of leather and smoke, like a smoked ham or salmon, that is it. The taste was nice, it had flavors of smoke, charcoal and some slight fruit all the way through it. Some malt caramel did take place in my mouth but was overshadowed by the smoke. At the end the only flavor I said to a guy next to me at the bar was âbeef jerkyâ It tasted like a good/great beef jerky. I liked it, it was a good finish to a nice session of drinking fine beer. The flavor lasted in my mouth till I got to my car. Not an everyday beer, but worth getting when available.","Jarod","Jan 13, 2003"
4.32,4.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"The pour a murky garnet to almost brown color, the head dinosauric in size, the texture frothy and as it decays, leaves behind large sheets of fine lace. "Smoky to the MAX!" and I like it, hints of malt and caramel sweet, a real treat to the nose as well as the palate. Start is ambrosial, the top middling in its feel. Perkily acidic and the hops masterful and pleasant in their bite, very dry and somewhat sweet aftertaste, if you like ÂSmokedÂ beers, this is a must try.","Gusler","Jan 02, 2003"
4.25,2.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"A very complex beer. Intense smokiness, at times the flavor inspires me, but sometimes it is just too smoky, I am a newcomer to this style, and it is a big sort of flavor, the smokiness dominates the smell, and aftertaste. Perhaps I am reviewing this too hastilly. It is a great beer, but I am not completely used to the intensity of this smokiness and at times it crowds my ability to taste other flavors. I will re-evaluate this beer on a periodic basis as I become accustomed to the style.","jtw5877","Dec 13, 2002"
4.25,2.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"1 pint, 9 fl. oz. bottle.  Ruby to brown colored in appearance.  Before I even drink the beer, the aroma is smoke filled.  It reminds me of smoked salmon or smoked cheese. First sip - wow!  Smoked gouda definitely, charcoal.  Some sweetness present, roasted flavor.  A slight bitter aftertaste.  You would have a tough time chug-a-lugging this beer.  Hard to rate because it so unique.  Choose when you're looking for a change and want something different.  I just checked out the website they list on the bottle and saw that they sell 5 liter party kegs of this stuff in Germany.","mjohn27603","Nov 02, 2002"
4.6,11.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"The body appears clear through a very deep mahogany-brown color. The creamy ivory head holds quite well and leaves some nice lace. The aroma is of rich Beechwood smoke. The body is full with a gentle carbonation, giving it a very creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is richly malty upfront with a lot of sweet caramel and toffee (and even a touch of chocolate?), then backed by a good dose of bitterness as it heads towards the swallow. It finishes dry with a solid bitterness and a lingering smoke character. Unlike some of the other Schlenkerla beers, the Urbock can build on the palate with its big malt, dense bitterness, and intense smoky character. Still, the smoke is so well balanced against the rich malt & hop that it never really takes center stage. This is not a quaffing beer, rather, it should be enjoyed leisurely. Absolutely worth trying.

It had a real nice flavor, smokey of course, with a medium malty body and a nice hoppy bite. It was fuller in flavor than the wheat version, and probably would have stood alone even without the smoke. The smoke made the brew taste a bit salty. If I were to picture the flavors in my mouth (this sounds really strange but hang in there) the smoke would be on top, the malt on the sides, and the hops down the middle. I am proud to say that this beer turned my girlfriend onto smoke beers! Right now I feel like buying more wood for my smoker and smoking myself some turkey or ribs!

Huge smokiness that almost reminds me of smoked bacon with a bit of caramel sweetness mixed in.  Sweet caramel and a touch of chocolate before the smoke took over command of this brew.  In the smokiness I definitely get a smoked bacon flavor or just smoked pork in general and it is definitely giving me a craving for some right now.  Mouthfeel on this one is a bit thinner than I would like it to be and that brings down the drinkability of this one a bit but it is an otherwise nice brew and could be fabulous with some smoked eats.","Murph","Aug 22, 2002"

I love this aroma. Great smoke characteristics. Almost like smelling a campfire from a distance. Woody and dry. This is a nice tasting brew. Not for the weak however. I don't think the smokiness here is quite as strong as say a Batch 5000, but it is nice. A little more subdued. Quite a bit of sweetness coming through too. Probably from the bock style backbone of this rauchbier. (Maybe that is why I prefered the Batch 5000 a little more than this. Less sweet from what I remember.) The body of this is medium to full. Maybe a little syrupy sweetness coming through. Beer conosieurs do need to give this a try.","Bighuge","Jul 09, 2002"

But once you get whiff, you know this is a smoked beer and is like smelling your clothes after a weekend of camping and sitting around the fire. The big malty bock backbone and the strongish alcohol flavor match very well with the smoked flavor. Easier to drink than the Marzen.

4.64,12.3,4,5,5,4,4,"Dark ruby in color, with a thin head.  The clarity is excellent and is indicative of ample lagering. As with their Marzen, the powerful smoked beechwood aroma dominates. A rich, decocted melanoidin aroma can be discerned beyond the heavily smoked malt.  It's quite full bodied, and although the aroma would indicate liquid smoke sausage, pronounced Munich malt flavors manage to balance the smoke flavor.  Although hop flavor is negligable, hop bitterness does a good job to balance the fairly complex malt flavors and is actually fairly high for a bock.  The finish is clean and surpisingly dry. This is a tremendously flavorful brew.  I would love to make a spicy chili using this beer as a base.","marc77","Apr 06, 2002"
