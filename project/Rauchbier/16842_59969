3.49,-7.4,3.5,4.5,3,3,3.5,"Poured on-tap at Three Tides, the beer was served in a pint glass. The beer pours a honey-brown color, with a vibrant, yellow-hued highlight. There is a thin ring of fluffy, white head. The smokey nose is similar to applewood bacon and oak chips. The beer's flavors are a bit watery and light, especially after the heavy aromas. Mostly nutty sweet, with a steady smoked background. The aftertaste is very light, with a balance of smoke and sweet malt. The beer does have a smooth, clean finish.","GarthDanielson","May 07, 2011"
3.83,1.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured a thick, dark brown with a nice finger of well-retaining head. Roasted malts and nuts in the aroma with an obvious smoke presence. More roasted malts in the taste, with smoked wood and mesquite happening, but not overly smokey compared to other rauchbiers. A bit of sweetness coming through on the finish. Medium bodied and pretty drinkable if you're a fan of the style.","Rifugium","Jul 21, 2010"
4.17,10.6,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Poured from the growler, not too much carbonation so no need to be careful with your pour. This beer is definitely not for everyone, the main characteristic is certainly smokey, almost reminiscent of bacon, which I don't mind at all. Underlying sweetness rounds out the taste. Definitely will try this one again.","facedogg","Jul 09, 2010"

1.65,-56.2,2,2,1.5,1.5,1.5,"Had this in a pint glass on tap at Novare Res. The pour was decent. The bartender said it would take a bit to settle and after a couple pours then settles I had a clear brown beer with a small white head. No visible carbonation and my ability to see right through this beer really surprised me. I was expecting something a little more heavy. After looking at it for a while I stuck my nose right in. Deep Purple gives a faint smell of a smokehouse flavor. As if I where smoking bacon. Not much else to the nose. It's really dominated by smoke. Not much to taste in this one. A little bit of the smokey bacon flavor I was expecting from the aroma, but there wasn't enough of anything. This was really watery and had zero carbonation. I really felt like I was drinking dirty smoked water. The lack of carbonation and extremely light body give this beer an off putting mouth feel. This would be easier to drink if the flavors where more there, I just feel like there wasn't enough of anything. I'm really hoping my next Marshall Wharf endeavor is better. I ended up only drinking about a third of this before just calling it a night.","Bendurgin","0"
