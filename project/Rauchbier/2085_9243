The taste has modest levels of malt and a bit of chocolate here and there. A pretty decent smoked beer and certainly sweet. Good with a cheese and sausage platter.","stoutman","Jan 29, 2012"

Flavor of salty, smoked meats although it gets sweeter as you progress through the glass. A pretty decent smoked but certainly on the sweet side.","LilBeerDoctor","Sep 27, 2008"

4.25,15.2,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"D-Nice stuff. A well done rauchbier. Smokiness is done just to a level that it is present and dominant but not overpowering. Good malty sweetness comes in to balance the smoke flavours.","Deuane","Dec 26, 2006"
3.21,-13,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Thin and a bit watery but nice flavors with solid balance. Much more chocolate than anticipated. Scoops of fresh vanilla bean. Smoke is present and very nicely integrated. Could have used more carbonation as there was nearly none at all.","mcallister","Jan 24, 2006"
3.73,1.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Enjoyed at the brewpub. Clear, dark chestnut beer with a light brown head. Some fine lacing. The aroma is almost all smoke and peat with little room for anything else. There's a lot more going on in the flavour, which is a little nutty, some chocolate, and mildly acidic, but there's still some smokiness. Very dry, medium bodied with lowish carbonation. Fairly enjoyable, especially for a style I'm not partial to. It's probably the maltiness that I find most appealing.","DrJay","Aug 16, 2004"

3.65,-1.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"i asked the bartender for something different, that i have never had. Their smoked beer is what i recieved. He described it was "liquid sausage". reddish brown in color with a tan head that sat atop the brew, but not for long. aroma was of roasted malts and a faint whif of that "liquid sausage". Taste was of lightly roasted coffeebeans, toffee, but not a whole lot of the smoked flavor i was expecting. it was there, it just wasnt the dominant flavoring. Mouthfeel was somehwere between medium and thick. A good beer, a different beer, but not what i expected. ill have to try other samples of smoked beer before i say this was an inadequete example. Enjoyed the experience.","jayb","Beers"
3.26,-11.7,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Made with 10% smoked barley? Could have fooled me! I agree with trbeer that this beer is ok, it's just not a rauchbier....it's not even remotely close. The brewers either 1) Have never had Kaiserdom Rauchbier before, or 2) Don't want to lose money on a beer that most people would consider undrinkable. With that in mind....This brew looked nice: clear, chestnut to mahogany in color with auburn accents, forming a light beige head atop small bubbles, but with poor retention and lacing. Aroma is predominantly butterscotch and toffee. Not even a hint of smoke here, folks. Thin, fizzy mouthfeel with a light body. Taste is earthy amber malts with earthy bittering hops and that's about it.","Mitchster","0"
