4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured from tap into nonic pint at Standard Tap, Philly. Pours a golden brown...more brown than golden, a bit of head and lacing. The aroma really shines here...lots of subtle smoke and sweet maltiness - not crazy, but deff present. Again, the flavor is on the more aggressive side of subtle with the smoke; perfect amount for me, with a nice sweet malt balance. Easy easy easy drinker and very pleasant. I have been drinking some really nice rauch's lately...a lot with the subtleness of smoke and bacon - which I really prefer, and this one really hits the mark for me. Overall, a great rauchbier for this who like the subtle smoke without the bacon...","DrinkSlurm","Jan 14, 2013"

3.23,-18.6,3,3.75,3.25,2.5,3,"This poured out as a clear looking copper color with a white head on top that faded pretty fast. There wasn't any retention or lacing on this one. The smell of the beer is definitely smoked, it's not overwhelming but you can tell what style they're going for here. The taste of the beer is smokey as well with a bit of caramel in the finish. The mouthfeel of the beer is light to medium bodied with a light carbonation. Overall this beer was average to me.","Knapp85","Dec 08, 2012"

3.75,-5.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Medium bodied with a good balance of smokey and sweet malt notes. Like the nose, the flavor of this beer consisted mostly of the sweeter characteristics until it warmed up. After about ten minutes the smoked malt flavors began to appear with hints of charcoal, BBQ, bacon and burnt toast. This is nicely balanced by hints of caramel, toffee, hazelnut, rye and a touch of dry, earthy hops. Complex but not overly smokey making it relatively easy to drink. A good introdction to the style.","corby112","May 04, 2009"

4.4,10.8,4,4,4.5,4,5,"D-I had this beer before it won the 2008 GABF gold and I stated, this is without question the best non-German rauchbier I have ever had....glad to see the judges agreed with me! For me, a smoked beer geek, this is about as good as it gets. No wonder I had something like four in a row!","Deuane","Jul 25, 2008"

4.01,1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"The Sly Fox Rauchbier delivers a deep copper body beneath a short but creamy head of ivory froth. The retention is fairly good and it leaves some nice lace about the glass. The body is medium; and combines with a fine-bubbled, median carbonation to give it a lightly crisp and then somewhat creamy mouthfeel. There's little smoke in the nose, but much more in the flavor. The maltiness is rich and round as well; lightly sweet and velvety on the tongue. It's very much like a vienna lager done with smoked malt. The gently sweet and lightly toasty malts combine seamlessly with the smokiness; and it's backed by a firm bitterness. Unlike many examples of the style, I think this one really nails the smoke level properly, lending it enough character to keep it interesting without letting the smoke building on the palate. Very well balanced!","NeroFiddled","Sep 11, 2005"

4.67,17.6,4.5,5,5,4,4,"This had a medium, off-white head with decent, if not great, retention. The color was a clear, deep amber with a hugely smoky nose. The beginning struck me as imparting a slight honey taste, which gave way to a sausage-like flavor on the palate. The mouthfeel was full, not quite creamy. The finish was more towards pork/bacon, if one is capable of making that kind of subtle distinction. I was so taken with this that I put my $ where my mouth and pen were and sprung for a growler. This will be part of an upcoming Smoke 'Em If You Got 'Em dinner at my uncle's place. Absolutely yummy, but a steady diet of it might put me off, so no 5 for drinkability.","woodychandler","0"
