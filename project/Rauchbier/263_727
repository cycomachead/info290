The smell is of smoked ham and treacle, roasted malt and caramel. The flavor reflects the aromas in perfect harmony. Moderate carbonation and silken mouth feel round out this classic Marzen based rauchsbier. A very enjoyable experience to be repeated before too long, especially with Surly Smoke now on the shelves.","mnredsoxfan69","Mar 22, 2015"

I love it - I like smoky things,  and whilst I have beers with smoky elements to the flavour profile (think stouts and so forth) none are as 'complete' as this. It's very much malt (and smoke) driven, so there's nothing much for the hop-heads but even so, it's different enough to be worth a try for anyone.","interzen","Mar 02, 2015"

The flavor isn't as intense, and I am appreciative. The peat, campfire and smoky bacon give way to some slight malt and general beer flavor. The body feels fuller because of the scent and flavor intensity. Not much of a Rauchbier lover. This one falls right in line with the rest of them for me. Hey, at least this brewery go full bore and christens you with smokey meat and peat. Don't love it but I suppose I respect it.","VelvetExtract","Feb 05, 2015"

Finally settles down to just along the sides of the glass after a good 30 minutes. Some spotty sticky lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is of smoked roasted malts for the most part. The taste is pretty much the same with a very light hint of caramel malts in the mix also. The smoke is not over done though but it is there. Really no bitter or harsh aftertaste to speak of. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation. Overall it was different but OK.","BeerWithMike","Jan 22, 2015"

Outstanding nose of meaty bacon like smoke against an underlying dark fruit (plum, fig) note.  Light medium body with a somewhat slick texture. Slightly below normal carbonation with just a touch of effervescence on the finish.  The flavor profile is a masterpiece of intensity, balance and complexity.  The delicious smoke character is always present, but never overpowering.  It begins with campfire bacon like smoke over a slightly sweet background that has dark fruit characteristics.  The middle allows the hops to impart a low level bitterness that has a citric note.  The almost dry finish is somewhat crisp and leaves you with a touch of biscuit like sweetness and a lingering smokiness as if you've sitting around a campfire.

It's not subtle but it's not overpowering either. Actually quite drinkable and highly enjoyable. Drink this one with some smoked meats or while sitting around a campfire. A really well crafted brew that harnesses the smoke flavor instead of letting it go wild. Do not fear the rauchbier. Embrace the rauchbier.","Jacobob10","Oct 24, 2014"

Very faint malt aroma with no esters and no hop aromas. APPEARANCE: dark ruby color and translucid. rich and creamy tanned head with medium-low retention. TASTE: smoky flavour balanced with a slight sweet malty background. clean lager profile. very low bitterness. finishes medium-dry. PALATE: medium-low body with low carbonation.

4.22,4.2,,,,,,"Overall - Really pleasantly surprised with this one. I wouldn't say it's "sessionable" unless you really love smoke, as swigging a smoked liquid is pretty odd to me. One was good, maybe I'd do 2, but I don't think I'd want to knock 3-4 of these back. However, it's actually quite light feeling and the smoke never gets overwhelming. This is a masterfully crafted, delicious beer; I truly enjoyed it.","Redneckwine","Sep 17, 2014"

Mouthfeel is medium/light and makes for an easy drink, the smokey waves mellow as it warms and some hops begin to show through with a slight bitterness.

Taste is malty with a lingering flavor like bark and grain. Mild bitterness finishes very dry. Mouthfeel is light and watery with medium-low carbonation. An interesting beer. The quality seems fine, but it may take a few of these to develop my palate for them. My first one was not that enjoyable and I have tried most styles.","chickenflea","Apr 25, 2014"

4.02,-0.7,3.75,4.25,4,3.75,4,"ASR poured an attractive chestnut brown colour with a large, slightly off-white head that lasted for several minutes before fading to a 1/8" cap of foam, leaving some modest lacing and spotting down the glass. Its aroma was strong and made up of wood smoke and back bacon. The beer's flavour was distinct but somewhat more subtle than its aroma, beginning, continuing and ending with wood smoke, with a mild bitterness noticeable at the finish. Both the smokiness and slight bitterness continued as a long lasting aftertaste. I found the carbonation to be quite moderate but well suited to the beer, and would describe ASR as medium bodied. Though I was a bit nervous at the start due to past experience with a couple of overpowering smoky beers, this was a refreshing change of pace. Not a style that I would drink every week, but a bit of a flashback to a bygone age when all malt for brewing in Germany was dried over a wood fire, and quite reasonably priced at $3.15 per bottle.","BuckyBeerBeaver","Apr 13, 2014"

This beer had pretty good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, fairly crisp, not filling, and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I thought the smoke would start to wear on me, but it doesn't and I think I could drink a couple pints of this but that may be my limit. For some reason I think this would be a nice fall time beer, maybe because of the smokey aspect. What I liked the most about this beer was the balance in the taste, the smoke really showed up, but it wasn't too overpowering and it let some of the nice Marzen flavors come through. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I can of think that would improve this beer, it's good just the way it is. I would buy this beer again when I'm in the mood for the style and I would recommend it to anyone who likes smoked beers. I like the style but in my experience some of them wear on me quickly with the harsher smoke flavor, but this beer kept all aspects pretty balanced and it was more drinkable than i thought it would. This beer made a good first impression for Aecht Schlenkerla, I'll be looking for more of their beer and so far this is my favorite traditional German Rauchbier, Nice job guys, this is one tasty and drinkable Rauchbier, keep up the good work.","StoutHunter","Feb 10, 2014"

There is more than a smokey meat flavor and smell but it will take further "investigation" for this beginners palate to unravel the intricacies of this beer. Given its history, it is at very least a MUST TRY for any beer lover. It is easy to see how one of these could be enough for a beer drinker, but it is equally easy to see how one could become slave to the uniqueness of this style of beer.

3.24,-20,4,3,3,3.75,3.5,"Look, this is the my first of the style, and if this beer is supposedly as good as others say it is, it will be my last. It pours a nice color with a medium head and very good lacing. The smell is all smoke--so much so that I can barely taste the "bacon" and "meat" that others rave about. But then again, if I wanted to smell meat, I would buy meat. The taste, in my [maybe naïve and unsophisticated}opinion is drowned out by smokiness. Some reviewers have congratulated this beer for its complexity and for the smoke flavor for being nuanced, but what I find is smokiness that has gotten out of control. I love a beer with some character, and there's nothing more attractive than a beer that compliments both a campfire and a steak at the same time. But this just seems to go too far and in the process loses the complexity that some are convinced that it has.","DeFaz","Sep 27, 2013"

Nose is smokey - wood smoke initially, followed by roasted/smoked meat. Taste starts off roasty, with the smoke settling in shortly thereafter; however, there is also a touch of malty sweetness and a slight buttery quality that is nicely integrated into the flavor profile.

On the nose, the beer smells of big bacon and smoked pork, mixed with notes of smoked hickory. On the tongue, the beer tastes of savory smoky malt, faint bitters from the roasted malt, and slight sweet malt. Flavors begin with smoky malts that move quickly into bacon and smoked salmon with a touch of smoky wood. As it warms, some slight dark fruit notes can be detected in the malts. The finish moves into notes of canned cat food mixed with more notes of big bacon. The aftertaste is light salty bacon on the tongue. In the mouth, the beer feels medium to heavy in body, with a smooth carbonation the slips over the tongue, leaving the mouth a little thick with a dry bacon feel with some slight saliva running from the tongue from acidity. Overall, I like this beer. It is a classic rauchbier and fills all the requirements of the style. It does leave a slight cat food flavor in the mouth, which is a little odd as I notice it more and more, but it is still tasty and displays the smoked malts well.","Maxwell","Apr 14, 2013"

I remember loving the thick and creamy body of the Urbock, and the flavors popped a bit more. This one might have a better nose, though.

The taste again is filled with smoke and bacon. There was also a hint of malt in this brew. The one thing that really shocked me on the beer was how thin it was and how mild the carbonation was. A beer with big flavors likes this should really be a little thicker, in my opinion. But, that’s my only complaint. This was also a nice session brew that was really drinkable and unique.

Smoky with a light bitter malt start, somewhat dry light malt middle and smoky with a hint of hop finish. Light to medium bodied. Side-by-side with the urboch. The marzen does not show much of its malt body, smokiness is dominant throughout. I like the urbock better because it is more complex.

The smoky profile continues taste-wise, more smoky wood than ashtray, fairly sweet in the middle, typical Marzen profile except for the smoke, faint floral hops on backend. Mouthfeel is medium, good effervescence. Not something I could drink all the time, nor finish the entire bottle by myself.Only downside is this beer absolutely trashes your palate, tried to refresh with a DIPA and I still tasted the smoke until halfway through that beer!

The taste brings some even darker smoke, but beyond that keeps things pretty steady. Smoky indeed! The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a pretty dry finish.

I love Marzen and this is an interesting twist. On the other hand the smokiness sort of drowns out some of the traditional Marzen traits. It has a dark brown body with a bit of orange hue. The aroma is not as Marzen like; this is the main thing that takes a backseat to the smokiness in the beer. It has that old smokehouse scent just like all their beers. The taste is meaty and there is subtle sweet roasted malt flavor before the smoke sets in. The body is medium and this is a great heavy meal beer.","MTNboy","Oct 10, 2011"

It doesn’t drop out nor does it overpower, rather the notes are there and remain present as it warms much like a mild-tasting Scotch.

It is impossible to appreciate the smoke character when paired with smoked foods. I was at the American Royal in KC last year and decided to bring both the Aecht Urbock and Marzen to taste with some smoked pork shoulder a buddy of mine was entering.

Smells of smoked meats, campfire, and band-aids. Taste is of smoked sausages, liquid smoke, band-aids, and roasted malts on the finish. The bitter smoke flavors fade quickly after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very interesting beer.

Aroma of most delicious bbq meat and smoke, obviously from the beechwood smoked malts. A lush caramel underbody is a great palate for the smoke to dance on. Malty, roasty, smokey, fantastic. Kind of tastes like how a dying fire smells. There is a subtle malt sweetness that works with the smoke. Malt comes off roasted, a seperate flavor from the smoke. Hops are lightly bitter, but barely percievable until the finish. There is a lingering smoked meat flavor that sticks with you as it sticks to the beer.

It's smoky like that. There's a subtle nutty, malt aroma in the back. That smokiness carries over abundantly into the taste. There's a bit of a spicy, bready note in there, and after the smoke clears, theres a rich maltiness in the back fighting for stage presence. The lesser side of this is the feel...bit to far on the light end of things. Overall though, solid Rauchbier, though probably my least favorite so far of the Aecht Schlenkerla Rauch's.","EgadBananas","Jun 11, 2011"

The mouthfeel was pretty smooth though and was drinkable enough to finish my glass. The beer overall isn't really my favorite style. I think sometimes the smoke is too much and it hinders the brew.

4.07,0.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"( 38/50, 5.1% alc/vol, Home) Beautiful red with a slight hue of brownish orange at the bottom. Deep and somewhat clouded by suspended sediment. Traces of yeast still in the glass. Head is sticky, brown and laces nicely. No carbonation to be seen though. For a beer that has been sitting in my fridge for a year, it smells awesome. No trace of the dreaded cardboard oxydation. Then again, it smells so powerfully of smoked ham, riverbed rocks, some oak and firewood that even age cannot surely harm it. The flavours of firewood last forever. You drink this and immediately remember those camping nights, the hot rock stoves of scandinavian baths and the warm plates of bavarian ham. Smoked flavours, oak, finesse. The age has served this beer extremely well. Taken down a notch, this smoked beer is actually very easy to drink. Not too complex, but still very nuanced. Cold, somewhat inactive drink. Not too sure about this one as a winter beer. Glides very well and does not linger too long. Apart, of course, of the burnt firewood, ashes on rock texture that lingers forever. Medium to thick ashen body. Mostly lifeless though. As far as rauchbier goes, this aged version of schlenkerla's marzen is impossibly beautiful, fine, nuanced and full of rock-smokey firewood. Not too harsh nor lasting, it dies nicely, and timely due to age. Not meant to be this soft, but I love it even more this way.","iguenard","May 07, 2011"

It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. Definitely had a great smoked meat flavor aspect going on in this one. I really needed to have BBQ with this brew. It would have made me appreciate it soooo much more. Seems like all of the Rauchbiers I've had lately make me want BBQ. Maybe it is a sign...

In reality, it was malty and smokey, and the taste was much the same. Smoke is the dominant thing here, people. If you somehow came upon this brew and were unaware that this was a large component of the beer, you would completely thrown, I think. To be honest, several hours afterward, I would "taste" the smoke smell in the back of my throat. It has a smooth mouthfeel, but due to the unusual experience with the overwhelming smoke-quality, I'd say it's not an easy beer to drink.

I just figured, "sure it's maybe a hint of bacon." But no, this is more of a dominant characteristic of the beer. As much as I enjoyed this, I can't say this will be a frequented beer by me. This might be something saved for special occasions during the winter time. Overall, I highly recommend trying this one.","Mancer","Nov 13, 2010"

The smell is fantastic, predominated by smoke-cured meats, caramel and a faint hint of graininess. The taste is very good. Smoke-cured meats predominates but is not overpowering. Also present are caramel and toasted grains with a hint of sweet maltiness. This is a very well crafted rauchbier. The mouthfeel is spot-on, but drinkability, well, it "is what it is".

The marzen, like all other beers from this brewery, is rank with smoke from top to bottom, from beginning to end. And let us not leave out the salted ham, the salami, the tobacco, the prosciutto... the entire pig, smoked on a rod, slowly, without the apple in its mouth (which I find so silly, anyhow...). If you're careful you'll detect some light hops at the end which adds just a nip to the beer. On the whole it's softer and loftier than the urbock, but not as light as the lager (both worth your $6).

More subtle in flavor than it looks: ham, meats, smokiness, slight tobacco towards the finish, bacon, hops without the bitterness towards the finish as well.

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't incredible either. The aftertaste is what turned me off. It really left a taste of smoke in my mouth that I couldn't help but associate with a tailgate.

It's not like most American smoke beers, however, that drink like liquid bacon (not that that's a bad thing). This flavor is rich with smoked wood flavor more in line with what you get in home-made jerkey - it's a big, but smooth roasted taste that reminds you of a fireplace. The malt provide sweet, crust and caramel background, but mostly just props up the smoked beechwood. The body, despite the strong flavor, is very drinkable.

Mild caramel sweetness is present. The palate opens smoky in a way that reminds me of smoking wet wood, with an earthy hop character. The hops work very well with the smoke, enhancing the experience. Smoky and meaty, this stuff is great. Light in body, and the carbonation is a touch higher than it needs to be. The finish is solid - dry and smoky - but could use a little bit more character.

Well actually it smells more like the smoke than the brisket. I strain and maybe think I find some caramel or toffee underneath, but the smoke is powerful and hides anything else that is in there. I now understand why some people say smoked smells like bacon. The taste is rich malty and creamy with a heavy hand of smoke. There are some sweet malts in there; caramel, toffee, and maybe some brown sugar in the taste. Lightly carbonated, medium body. I would have to say this must be an acquired taste. I can appreciate it for what it is, but I can't imagine myself enjoying many of these. I think its very well done, but not for me.","johnnnniee","Sep 15, 2009"

4.37,7.9,4.5,5,4.5,4,3.5,"Pours a very dark amber with 2 finger head of barely off-white foam. Leaves quite a bit of lacing on the glass. As soon as you crack this beast open you know you are dealing with something a little different. You don't even have to breath through your nose and you can easily pick up on the smokiness in the nose. I can't fight my way through it, all I smell is delicious smokey... nay very smokey bacon. Taking a sip, I am immediately thinking of a delicous roast beef dinner with gravy. What the hell is this, dinner in a bottle? Finish is a little bitter but the smoke remains in your mouth long after you have taken a sip. Another noticable feature is a bit of a metallic taste. The bottle is labled as a marzen but you could easily lie to me and tell me it is something else. I guess if you took away the smokey flavor it might taste like a marzen but I am too caught up in the beefy taste to tell what it is. About all this beer has to offer that is like a marzen is the color, and even that looks like it has been set on fire and burnt a little.","stakem","Sep 03, 2009"

However, these smoke flavors don't entirely crowd out the solid malt backbone. Heller-Trum does an excellent job controlling the meaty potential of the beer. The flavor is similarly good and affords some interesting insight into the historical practices of brewing. It's good that German brewers maintain these older styles. The malt is sweet and lush with a crisp touch of bitterness in the finish. The beer has a pleasing mouthfeel, smooth and round.

The pour is a slightly cloudy brown with a tremendous amount of foamy tan head that bubbles until the end and never really goes away. The aroma is spectacular like nothing else I have smelled. It is like smoked cheddar cheese. Malts and hops play second fiddle to the amazing smoky aroma. The mouthfeel is medoium to bold and kind of creamy. The taste is an intricate balance of smoked malts and wheat. This is probably the best wheat beer I have ever had.","puboflyons","Apr 27, 2009"

These beers are international treasures and should be appreciated for what they are. Pours a slightly reddish dark brown with a very loosely beaded head that fades to a ring. Absolutely scrumptious aroma of ethereal woodsmoke and tangy malt. The taste has plenty of that same woodsmoke as well as a slightly sour graininess and a long bitter, almost tannic finish. At mid taste the malts are smooth and creamy. Quite lovely, and very firm. Great by itself, but a wonderful food beer. Try it with somke roast pork and potatos or with some sharp cheddar cheese.","Georgiabeer","Apr 22, 2009"

It would be interesting having another rauchbier and compare the two, but unfortunately, this is the only one available in my area, atleast for the time being.

Dark brown to mahogany red in hue, close to full transparency, though, very consistent hue. Like, duh, the nose is very smoky, like a dry kindling fire, crispy bacon, touch of molasses like slow roast pulled pork, some pine resin as well, toasty sourdough, solid nuttiness too, some grape to cherry fruit scents, no citrus really. Light to medium-bodied but that smokiness is so bodacious it just fills the mouth. Bacon, beef jerky, saltlick quite obvious. It's interesting to taste a liquid so woody yet with no hint of oak barrel treatment. There's a light bitterness which teases out a moment of white grapefruit. Conversely, not without sweet notes of molasses, honey and caramelized brown sugar. Green raisin to fig fruit in minute portions. The finish swirls with persistent smokiness, it doesn't leave until you intentionally put something else in your mouth to tame it.","farrago","Apr 18, 2009"

Looks about how I'd expect. Smell is definitely is smoked, very smoked, but this one is more woody than the first I tried, and much less meaty, still some burnt pork, like BBQ, but with a distinct malt sweetness underneath. Again, a good smell for a rauchbeir, though its hard to look past the fresh wood smoke smell, like ashes. The taste comes across first with the woody smoke, like eating smoked meat, without the meat underneath. Definitely a very interesting taste, but I think this one is much more palatable for me than other rauchbiers, and I think this one is what thay're all shooting for. I really only get wood smoke though, sometimes like cooked meat, sometimes like raw wood pulp, there's a light malty finish with a bit of sweetness, but nothing impressive. The smoke is king here, and its pleasant. The carbonation is nice, makes it more interesting for me, otherwise this is kind of like liquid smoke. It's in a nice place between thick and thin, good body though. The drink is nice, I suppose very good for a smoked beer and the alcohol doesn't get you, but in the overall scheme of beers, this just isn't easy to drink. I'm interested in the flavors, though I think that lasts briefly, and the one-dimensionality will force me to slow down and lose interest.

Many brews in Europe and abroad have tried to replicate this recipe, but it's quite exceptional. The color is mostly brown with some reddish-brown elements and a rather large head. The smell is immediately the first thing to truly reach your senses and smells like bacon or pork. It goes down smooth and has exceptional taste, but beware it definitely leaves a strong reminder in your mouth long after consumption. I highly recommend drinking this beer with a traditional German pork dish, such as Schweinebraten, Wuerstchen or Haxe. The beer can also be used to flavor foods when cooking. This beer is truly one of a kind.","germanbeer1","Nov 23, 2008"

It is real smooth and creamy, almost full-bodied, yet there is this smokey, dry, almost processed meat taste to it (and I mean that in a good way). THere are hints of sweet and roasted malts and dark fruits, but the smokiness really comes through on this beer but it is reasonable; the backbite is dry but not overly dry and your pallete is killed like this is a DIPA or anything.

A very smooth feel, with a mild crispness, and is very silky along the palate. This is an incredible beer, there are styles that you have to taste from the source, this beer is it.

After it's warmed I'm not sure if I've found a bit of hops in the finish of it it's just the smoke. it's has a medium intensity and I notice it more as I breath out.

Is this going to taste like dear old Grandma Abigail's ashes?" It was nothing like that at all! I slowly poured the rich tawny brew into a pilsener stlye glass (I had never heard of rauchbeir before then so I had no idea what vessel to enjoy it in.) I put my nostril up to the rim and inhaled deeply. Fresh smokey hardwood wafted into my nose. It reminded me of a summer barbeque with weiners on the grill. I took a swig and swished it around my pallet. What a symphony of smoked meat flavoring and faint oak. It was absolutely delectable! I had never experienced anything close to it. Now I live in Gainesville and I am totally craving the Jimmy Dean goodness that is rauchbeir. I have already ordered a case for the liquor store I work at.","Portertime","Apr 08, 2008"

I found it extremely enticing and the taste was not a letdown either. The base of the beer itself was smooth, perfectly malty and sweet with a touch of lingering smokiness and light bitterness in the finish. It was very full flavored, not overdone and perfectly crisp from the carbonation, and I was shocked at how drinkable this stuff was.

I'm getting hints of that smokey bacon flavour on the front palate and a bit of toastiness. The back palate (which is disappointingly short) is where the hops lie, and it would be quite underwhelming in flavour if not for the fact that the back palate is where the aroma comes blundering in.

It was disconcerting until I thought of the smokiness I'd expect from a nice single-malt Islay scotch or a smoked, dry-aged Schwarzwalder ham. With that in mind, the smokiness is a nice rich flavorful smoke that complements the marzen remarkably well. Unlike some other flavored beers, this one does not skimp on the base beer. The melanoidin maltiness comes through the cloud of hardwood campfirey smoke and smooths the edges of the smoke and light hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is typical marzen, and while it would otherwise be a dangerously drinkable beer, the smoke flavor would wear out its welcome.","MillRat","Dec 25, 2007"

This beer does an excellent job of being what it's supposed to be.The beer has a nice dark reddish/gold appearance with thick off-white/dark yellow head and lots of lacing. It almost tastes just like my jerky as well minus the spicyness. But there's also a sweet kind of malt flavor as well. Maybe a little nutty, too? Not too thick, nor weak. Just right. This seems to be to be a special kind of beer that you only have one of as a treat while watching Family Guy and eating sharp cheddar cheese before you go to bed.

Very smoky, and all I can think about is how much I love smoked salmon. This beer brings back memories that have nothing to do with beer. I like that. There is some definite hop bitterness in the middle, and I don't get any sweetness until the very end. Very interesting brew. Love the smoke, but there is something in the aftertaste that I wish would just leave me alone. Something in there just doesn't belong, imo. There is also a slight abrasiveness on the tongue. But this is still a very good beer, and I'd definitely purchase it again if my smoke-tooth starts harassing me again.

Clear dark russet with a lumpy cloud of khaki foam. Smells unmistakably like a toasted sandwich with shaved smoked ham and melty smoked gouda (God, I bet that sandwich would pair superbly with this beer). Deeper whiffs reveal a bit of a worty malt scent, but really the only aroma that matters here is the smell of meaty smoke. This smoked pork flavor powerfully introduces the taste and lingers throughout the middle of the sip, at which point the faint hops and bready malt flavor of the Maerzen beer comes through briefly. Then a rather strong mineral taste seeps in, lasts through the finish, and then disappears in a cloudy, smoky aftertaste that lasts about half a minute. Sticky webs of lacing hang about. After a bit, the smoke flavor takes on more of a "been breathing through my mouth at a campfire" character. Medium body, slightly chewy, overall dry mouthfeel. This is really unlike any other beer I've ever tasted. I've had smoked porters before, but they ain't got nothin' on the smokiness of this specimen. It's truly fascinating. It strikes me as something I'd only crave from time to time, and only on certain occasions.

Taste starts out with a sweet maltiness that quickly bows to a smokiness that is full and rich but not overly assertive, especially for this style. Dry in the finish, with a pleasant crispness. The mouthfeel is nicely balanced for such an "unbalanced" beer--not too chewy or clingy but not too crisp to betray the malty foundation of the style.

It poured about the same colour, a brownish - red bronze with a slight chill haze and off white head that dissolved in a few seconds leaving a lovely looking blanket of frost about the surface. Smell was camp fire smoke, bacon, and sweet malts such as one would expect from a good Oktoberfest bier such as Paulaner. Taste was more smoke and a bit drier than the Ur-Bock, with less sweet of a finish than the Ur-Bock, as well. I think I prefer this to the Ur-Bock, which unfortunately, I have easier access to than this. Mouthfeel is very smooth with a great weight to be a Märzen, even with the smoke.

Thin and watery on the tongue, moderate carbonation - the smoke flavor picks up immediately before youve even had a chance to swallow. Tastes almost entirely of smoky, roasted malt - almost no hop presence whatsoever (nor any trace of meat flavoring, thank Whomever). Altogether extremely smoky, but not in a "burnt" sort of way.

Anyway, from a big German bottle into a German mug, it pours a rich, deep copper with very active carbonation and an inch of khaki head that consists mostly of small bubbles and retains a quarter inch throughout, leaving some nice patches/rings of lace. The aroma is very smoky from the beginning - I can smell the wood they used, and the aroma reminds me of a good smoked meat or cheese. By the end there are notes of faint hops and clean malts, and the smoke seems to be sweeter, if that makes sense. The first sip kickstarts my bacon craving, which by end becomes a smoked salmon craving. The taste is highly smoky at the start with notes of spices, but I soon find notes of faint coffee and green, almost citric hops with a mild to medium bitterness that intensifies as I progress, as does a tobacco flavor which leaves the taste of chaw in my mouth. The mouthfeel is medium to full, and incredibly smooth and creamy for a lager, leaving a long finish that makes me want another bottle. It is surprisingly drinkable, as I was a bit hesitant of the style, but it is a wonderful beer that is totally unique to my palate. I must try their other offerings. A great deal at under $4 a bottle.","mmmbeer","Mar 30, 2006"

I reckon with a side of eggs and some strong coffee we'll be able to hunt moose and fish walleye all day. Amazingly strong smoked meat aromas. Faint caramel malt in there, but the smoke covers all else. Luckily, I like smoked meats. Smoked prosciutto flavors greet the mouth, alongside caramelized carrots and faint malt sweetness.

The smokiness is not as pronounced as in the aroma (or as in the Rauchbier Urbock): it's more in the background. Nice toasted malt notes, with some pine hops, then the smoke is in the aftertaste.

This would go so so well with a side of summer sausage. carbonation is just right and delivers the aromas just perfectly.

I think the smoked flavor overwhelms the other elements slightly in this one- there's probably a better balance in the urbock version- but I guess that's the point. The carbonation acts well with the high-medium texture to make it an enjoyable treat in moderation.

The carbonation seemed nice. I'm not a fan of high carbed brews like Saisons. Then came the nose. Wow! I've thrown wet newspapers on a fire that had a better smell. A cross between Kipper snacks and smoked oysters. While I love both of those, that kind of smoke flavor doesn't work here. The taste, the same, that same nauceous smoke is on the tongue now. The mouth was extremely light. I had a hard time with this one so, needless to say, drinkability didn't impress me at all.

Smoky  unique flavors that leave you scratching  bacon, ham-like flavorings and even some caramel flavorings. The body becomes a bit spicy and sweeter towards the bottom of the pint glass.

Smells like something well-smoked off the grill, which is cool, since it's always nice to get what the name advertises. Taste is surprisingly of sweet malts initially, and then the smoke aroma/taste comes on in. A pleasant turn of events, there's more to this one than meets the eye, err, nose. The main observation I am presented with is "watery". Mouthfeel and drinkability are both great for the style, which can sometimes take things a bit too far, and forget the whole idea is a drinkable end product.

Strong flavor of smoke, with earthy overtones, with the nuances of bacon. Yum. When they say smoked beer, they mean it.

4.3,6.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Dark brown with heavy ruby influences, when held to a light it keeps its depth of color in the middle but it became shiny-ruby around the edges. The head was foamy and bubbly; at the apex it was a modest finger in height. The head retention was decent; it faded to a soapy collar, foamy in the middle with naked pockets, thicker on the outside. This collar lasted a very long time but the subsequent lacing was nonexistent. The first time I took a sniff of a Rauchbier I thought it was awful. Now, my mouth waters and I find the smoky aromas so damn inviting. The Marzen has some potent smells of smoked ham and bacon, charred fat, beechwood campfire smoke. Damn it is lovely, the complexities all fall into some general categories but it is undeniably complex. I swear at the very back is a suggestion of malt. Inviting. While the nose is loud, the palate is quit the conversationalist! The beer is perfectly balanced and so wonderfully constructed that it is a sin. The true smoky qualities are really only found in the aftertaste, it is like exhaling a fine cigar. Upfront is some ample maltiness, juicy. In the middle come the bacon, ham, and fatty flavors. I dont think they are quite as bold as they are in their Urbock, still if youre not use to the style it will still be a bit much for you, IMO. Somewhere after the meat and before the smoke is a fleeting moment of true Marzen maltiness. I am impressed with the bitterness in the finish, it seems more than just astringency from the roast maybe there are some hops (but most likely not). Regardless the palate is damn yummy. The mouthfeel is okay, I wish there was a little more bulk on the tongue and some more carbonation. Still with a medium body and moderately low carbonation I am not complaining. I purchased a bottle in Burnsville, MN. I will buy more in Iowa City or KC as I have learned to love the style. Wonderful. Bring on the BBQ!","bditty187","Aug 06, 2004"

First sip tastes like roasted pork. Second sip, and it tastes like a beer. A beer smoked inside a meathouse beside salmon and whole ham. Almost a meal drink. Aftertaste is a bit hoppy, with more smoked salmon than ham. Odd, but nice. I can understand why people would hate this beer. Hey, some people don't want roasted swine in their beer.

The first gulp the smoke overpowers your senses..all go blotto on the smoke signals...but after you have a sip or two or you finish a couple of pieces of cheese or oysters, the smoke power wanes and you get the mellow character of this delicate marzen lager...and it is delicate... with lots of subtle complexity (well made) you just dont get there on the first couple of gulps because it's cloaked by the smoke. All in all this is a toughie of a beer to slot...great german beer but perhaps too damn strong on smoke for some to be useful for anything else than a drink with similar strong tasting foods to off set them....like Jalapeno-infused anything or a strong tasting fish meal....I really like this beer and I drink it on its own in a session with out food but then I'm a marzen junke and Bamburg smoked marzen is a real treat for me....I had smoke taste up my nostrils and on the palate the next day...and loved it!","pootz","Jun 11, 2004"

4.09,1,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a medium brown ( it was hard to tell as the beer was poured into a krug) with a nice foamy tan head.. The nose is of sweet smoked meat. In the words of Homer Simpson mmmm bacon beer. Taste is quite nice with a bit of sweet malt at the beginning, then the wonderfully done smoked malt charging to the fore, it ends with just enough hops to dry out and cut the smoke. This went wonderfuly with the schnitzel I had, but to have it with some grilled meats or nice sausages would be heavenly. Mouthfeel was almost oily, but the carbonation provided enough so that the smoke didnt linger like a dirty ash tray. Drinkability is good. I wouldnt pound these all night, but a couple with food is a no-brainer. I will definately seek this out and order it again.","TinusTime","Mar 22, 2004"

Poured a hazy muddy brown color with a little bit of a grey head. Smelled of nothing but smoke. The kind of smoke that clings to your clothes after sitting around a campfire for a couple nights. Deep woody flavors and a bit of smoked salmos as well. Taste had more of that huge herby smokiness, but the finish was almost cracker like in its toastiness. very interesting blend of tastes. I would say that you should definitely try this beer even if you don't like smoked anything. it will be worth it.","GreatPondBrewer","Mar 16, 2004"

Smoke any seafood, I would guess, and you've got the aroma of this deep chestnut brown ale that arrived from the tap with virtually no head at all. The taste matched the smell; it started off with a tart, vinegar-like initial blast, heavily salted, all of which fortunately mellowed as the schlenkurla malts rose up and insinuated themselves towards the finish, at which point I was able to appreciate the underlying complexity of this ale. There's some forest foundation, like an old campfire, but also some subtle sweetness (a sweet and sour seafood dish, heavy on the sour, and cooked outside over an open fire--that's the best I can do)","longpondbeerman","Mar 16, 2004"

Beer is a chestnut brown color with great clarity and a few swift streamers. Transparent and bright when held to light, with slightly orangish highlights. Aroma is of smoke--not tobacco, but food smoke. There's also a subtle salinity, suggesting smoked seafood (especially oysters) and further back, the heat of freshly sawn wood (cedar). Taste is more smoke but stunningly light upon the roof of the mouth, along with what I originally thought was cedar, until I read that the wood for the fire is beechwood--yes, beechwood is more accurate. Beef or venison jerky, liquid smoke, and very salty. I am new to the style, but I just don't see much diversity here and presently I got tired of the flavor. Mouthfeel is light and wet with a minerally finish and really not much aftertaste. As far as drinkability, I'm sure this goes great with smoked food, sharp cheese, etc. but on its own? I don't need another.","NearerMyBeerToMe","Mar 10, 2004"

Based on the smell, I thought the taste would be WAY too smokey, but suprisingly, it's not. It's got an absolutely perfect amount of smoked malt. It's not too subtle, but definately not overpowering. A hint of caramel in there, and just the slightest touch of hops on the finish. The mouthfeel is just a little light and oily. The drinkability is superb for a smoked beer. A really good offering.

Surprising aroma, definitely a new class for me, meaty with bacon and ham, salty sausages. The flavors developments are quite unrivaled. Let me explain.. first that intense smokiness (long dry smoky/bitter finish)is kind of a guardian over the journey that tasting this beer is. It's also one of the not so typical beers that holds the 4 basic flavors. Mouth entrance is very malty and moderatly sweet with the body being medium to full. Then, those smoked malts develop into a salty (bacon is salty after all) taste. Slightly tart at the same time. The finish is intense and bitter, woody, earthy, peaty.

With some maltyness and perhaps a hint of bitterness at the end, no carbonation at all, the biggest trait of this beer is, actually, its meaty (hammy in this case) sort of taste, very strongly perceivable and pleasant to the palate.

The nose smelled a bit like smoked salty fish - not an unpleasant thing, but a bit odd for a beer. The mouth was heavy and mildly carbonated, with a definite charcoal undercurrent. The taste is smokey, but reasonably mild. It has little in common with other Märzens, but is pretty darn enjoyable, as the malt contends with the smoke leaving a pleasant aftertaste generated from the mixture. No hops taste.

Taste: It's so strange drinking a mildly sweet liquid that has a big kick of smoked meat in the flavor doesn't seem like it should be drinkable or even blend together but it does. Mouthfeel: Medium body decent carbonation not a bad brew at all, definitely a new definition of smoked bier.

Aroma consisted of a chalky mesquite smoke, reminded me of smoked salmon. Taste was really something else. The smoke flavors were immense, the same smoked fish, with a sweetness like smoked sausage.

Smooth full smoky mouthfeel. Halfway through the glass I had some smoked cheese and sausage, and this beer went with them perfectly. Eating some smoked foods actually brought out more of the sweet flavors in the beer. Goes down very easy. I'd go back to this beer again and again. An amazing style.","chaduvel","Sep 26, 2003"

This is a beer to drink with a big slab of meat. The smokey flavor is very intense and is better accompanying something rather than by itself.

4.42,9.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Brewed soley from smoked malt! It pours a clear, reddish-copper body topped by a creamy ivory head which holds well and leaves some nice lace. The aroma is of intense Beechwood smoke over a gentle maltiness. The body is medium; and combines with a fine-bubbled, median carbonation to give it a lightly crisp and then somewhat creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is drenched in Beechwood smokiness throughout, but starts malty upfront with a touch of toastiness/toffee, followed by a good dose of bitterness as it heads towards the swallow. It finishes long and dry with a solid bitterness and a lingering smoke character. Although its smokiness will surely build on the palate after a few servings (diminishing its drinkability), it's still satisfying from start to finish within the first glass. Very nice!

From first whiff to last drop, smokehouse flavors ease into your nose. Not harsh at all, but very pleasant. Taste is equally striking at first. Reminded me of smoked beef jerkey or perfectly smoked bbq ribs. Creamy sweet malt is also noticed. As you drink, the shock of the smoke wears out a bit, and more full rich malty beer flavors emerge. Toasted toffee sweetness. Nothing really lingers. Medium bodied, rich creamy feel. A striking and unique beer, would get a 5 for originality.

A different beer, and something worth the try, for you "Dark" lovers.","Gusler","Nov 28, 2002"
3.81,-5.9,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Rauchbier is truely an acquired taste... and I'm not sure that I have, as of yet, acquired the taste. That said, this was a very interesting beer... had it with some Jagerschnitzel at a local German restaurant. Brownish amber with a dense foam. Aroma of smoked meat and just a touch of sweetness (although you have to be looking for it, or you won't find it.) First sip, and whoa... smoked salmon in a bottle... but after a few sips (and as the beer started to warm) the smokiness mellowed and some of the marzen characterisitcs started coming through. The sweetness matched the smoky flavor pretty well. The body and carbonation are in the medium range. If you like smoked beer... you should love this beer... if you haven't had it, you owe it to yourself to try it.","zerk","Nov 24, 2002"

4.08,0.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Between this beer, their Urbock, and Weizen, I prefer this second to the Weizen. This was a very nicely balanced Marzen underneath the smoke. However, the complexity of the smoke layered on top of the wheat makes the Weizen that much more interesting.","yen157","Nov 10, 2002"
4.44,9.6,4,5,4.5,4,4,"In my opinion, Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen is probably the better out of the bunch. Pairs nicely with any grilled or cured meats.","Todd","Oct 27, 2002"

4.45,9.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"What a wonderful smokey aroma this beer has. Seems to fit in well in this fall season. I've been yearning for a smoke beer for quite some time now and am very glad this one didn't disappoint me. This beer definatly sets the tone for future Rauchbier tastings in the future.","sinistersteve","Oct 14, 2002"
4.62,14.1,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This would be all the better paired with a nice, hearty meal.  For some reason, rauchbiers always have me scrambling for the food (munchies from the smoke??).  A selection of cheeses paired delightfully with this tonight.","cokes","Sep 30, 2002"

2.46,-39.3,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,"Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier A very smoked German marzen.  I had a small sample of this on tap, and thank god, because there was no way I could have finished a pint.  Heavily smoked flavor and aroma.  Do not think a roaring fire in your fireplace smoked, think great Chicago fire smoked.  Just a hint of molasses taste, but to me it way to much smoke. Not for the faint of heart.  I tweaked the numbers up, a little because this is clearly a well made beer, but It reminded me off dgging through my friends apartment after it had been burnt to the ground.","jackndan","Sep 17, 2002"
4.47,10.4,4.5,5,4.5,4,4,"This is a beer that you warm up to...much like an Islay Single-Malt Scotch like Laphroiag: "There is a fine line between love and hate: about halfway through the bottle....."","brakspear","Sep 16, 2002"
3.92,-3.2,4,4.5,4,4,3,"Dark amber color, good head, delicious smoky aroma. This beer is very refined, with the smoke almost entirely in the attack, and a smooth malty finish. It does not have the animal fat taste in some smoked products, which is good, but also lacks the delectable, peaty, greeny qualities that can be found in scotch whisky, for example. Perhaps best with food, in my case, chicken sausages and Jarlsberg - which I think were a little too delicate since the smoke is quite robust. The smokiness mellows out as it sits in the glass, and also as your palate adjusts to it. It is a fine beer, even if the actual beer lying under the smoke flavors is a bit mild. Some coffee and liquorice hints. Low drinkability but that is symptomatic of the style in my opinion. It really does grow on you.","Thrasher","Jun 09, 2002"
4.21,4,3.5,5,4,4,4,"the aroma is spine tingling, especially if you live in an area that appreciates smoked meats/fish and uses wood burning stoves in the fall and winter. the smoked taste aroma/taste dominates this fine brew. i should be drinking this in late october/november with some dried venison with my hunting buddies.  dark garnet hue but no lasting head at all.  nice caramel malt body and lingering smoke aftertaste.  a true unique german classic.  a brew i WILL revisit this fall to really soak in the seasonal atmosphere.","budgood1","Jun 09, 2002"
4.2,3.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Wow. Liquid smoke in a bottle. What a different experience this was. So much so, that I had to go out and get another bottle of it!  Very good. Drink this while eating something heavy, like a pot roast or venison. Very good.","proc","Apr 25, 2002"
5,23.5,5,5,5,5,5,"From the time I first tried this beer I was totally impressed. So unique and so rewarding. Very complex. Taste is a great toasted malt flavor and with the mixture of the smoke flavor, you have an exceptional beer. This is great alone or with very robust meal such as beef stew. The first thing that hits you is the instant smell of smoke. God I would love to tour this brewery!!!!!","Jdiddy","Apr 08, 2002"
4.24,4.7,4,5,4.5,3,3.5,"Beautiful crystal clear garnet hue. A touch darker than the norm for a Marzen. Thin head, w/ fairly low carbonation for style. Huge beechwood smoked malt aroma dominates. Secondary to that raisiny, decocted malanoidin malty aromas are noticeable, but the rauchmalt dominates. Roasty & toasty malt flavors are prominent and are accompanied by a surprisingly assertive hop bitterness for style. All of this is combined with a rich, tasty rauchmalt smokey base. Medium bodied w/ a nice toasted malt and slight hop bitterness in the finish. Very complex beer with an assertive but well balanced rauchmalt flavor. That being said, you won't like this beer if you don't like smoked beers.","marc77","Mar 12, 2002"
4.22,4.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Dark brown-black clear lager with a white bubbly head on top. Smells very smoky, but with the familiar sweet and clean german malt coming through, no hop odor in the smell (perhaps I couldn't smell it due to the smoke). Smooth, clean, and malty taste, with an unstoppable smoked character throughout. Looking past this, I taste a well crafted, and very clean German Lager. Very quaffable with some good old bbq spare ribs and pulled pork, it practically drank itself.","hooligan","Mar 02, 2002"
4.3,6.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Very interesting beer, actually tastes like smoked salami or something, although that might sound digusting, it actually works well.","rastaman","Feb 17, 2002"
3.44,-15.1,4,2.5,3.5,4,4,"I do not like the smell from start, it smells like smoked kielbasa. I like kielbasa but this smell burned my nose hairs. I love Marzen beer but the smoked effect is not my style. I still recognize this beer is a clasic for the smoked type, that's why I gave it a curved score. It is smooth and goes down easy and the finish is also good, but that smell get's to me.","WilliamPhilaPa","Feb 02, 2002"
