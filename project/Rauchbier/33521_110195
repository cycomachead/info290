The brewer absolutely nailed this one. and at 4.7% abv, I could see myself drink a lot of this in the possible future.","smakawhat","Jan 20, 2014"

The light body can't quite stand up to the four-alarm smoke. Needs more of a malt backbone to firm this one up and give it some ballast. Props for creativity though.","jjdc","0"
