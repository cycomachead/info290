3.25,-5.8,,,,,,"You know it's a solid birthday when you spend it at a beer distributor's trade show, right?  Here at the Cisco table, we've got Sankaty Light.  It pours a clear straw topped by a finger or so of lightly off-white foam.  The nose comprises light white bread, mild flowers, mild grass, and a kiss of what seems to me to be tangelo rind.  The taste brings in more of the same, the lightness in the name and the smell underlined here on my tongue.  In addition, the bread from earlier appears to have taken on a slight sweetness, though it's not much to speak of.  The body is appropriately light, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda watery feel.  Overall, this isn't a bad beer by any stretch, especially considering how overwhelmingly underwhelming the light lager style has become over the years, but it's overt mildness borders far too much on boring for its own good.  I could see myself drinking another at some point in the future, but it's unlikely I'll have paid for it.","TMoney2591","Sep 06, 2014"

My ratings are in comparison to other light lagers, not beers in general (I think that this is how most reviews on this site are supposed to be, but it's easy to compare lagers to other lagers when you've had a bunch of different varieties, as opposed to comparing something like milk stouts where maybe you've only had a handful). I think this is one of the few light lagers that I actually enjoy drinking. Very refreshing and not too heavy, crisp and fruity, excellent on a summer day.

Not watered-down in the least, and easily the most full-flavored Light Beer I've had (edging Sam Adams only slightly).

Nose smelled like all-malt (no adjuncts) and grassy hops and my heart began to go pitty-pat. I CANnot tell you the pain that I have endured at times in this madness, and especially from this style, AALs and AMLs. This actually smelled like real beer, even in a Light Lager version. Mouthfeel was actually pretty big, very foamy with big bubbles and the taste was of light malt and light grassy hops. Zounds! Finish was semi-dry and I was ready for another sip. I CANnot remember the last time that I thought that way of a beer of this style. Now, all of that said, I am not going to pack the cooler full of such CANs, however. I do not care how good it may be, I am not into Light beers. I probably could stand to lose some weight, but not by cutting back on flavorful beer.

If you like this style then go for a Budweiser or another beer that you can find in a 7-11 or any gas station across America. This may seem like a harsh review, but it based on principal more than flavor. Perhaps this is helping Cisco fund it’s other beers as that’s the only reason I can think of for producing this drink.","CHickman","Apr 07, 2012"

Pours a heavily opalescent pale gold, straw inflected, with rocky white head above. Flavor has three nice movements, first a bubbly fresh plain, clean malt, mingled with some Cascade hops and general resin and sugar. Then a faint whiff of bready yeast, doughy and creamy. Good middle body. Finishes off with a long, unexpected draw of hops, in good tones of Cascade and other west coasters. All around I was impressed by the body, drinkability and flavor of this beer. The hops are very enjoyable, the yeast character desirable and helping and the smack and body full and refreshing. Good stuff!","CharlesDarwin","Nov 20, 2011"

3.8,10.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"I received a biker pour, so only ended up with a thin skim of whitish bubbles topping my pale gold beer. It had a bit of haze and the head left some fine, spotty lacing on the glass. It had a grainy, cereal flavour, fairly sweet, with mild bitterness and a hint of toasted malts. It was also slightly fruity and there was slight citrus to the flavour and aroma. The nose had a grassy, fruity quality with fresh grain character and hints of spice. Light bodied, but not thin, medium to high carbonation, off-dry, decent texture. This was decent for a light beer, much more flavour than you get from a typical BMC light beer. It may have helped that this tasted really fresh as well.","DrJay","May 03, 2011"

Still, though, the only thing light about the beer is the feel, which is fine, but the flavor is quite strong and maybe too bitter for such a light feel. Strong taste of salt air and steamed clams, and I'm actually not just saying that because it's brewed in Nantucket. It really tastes that way.

Four inch bright white, volcanic head that formed lots of jagged peaks and crags as the eruption slowly subsided. Lots of sticky lacing on this one. Brew is a translucent golden-yellow. Nose is clean and mild; only a faint wheat scent is detectable. Taste is also clean; more light wheat with a nice well-rounded balance of citrus and hops with a slight bitterness at the finish.

3.7,7.2,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"A cloudy golden-straw color with an agreeable, frothy head describes the appearance of this brew. Theres a rustic, malt and yeast smell thats framed by a mild floral hoppiness. Also present is a faint citric, grapefruit aroma. In all, the smells pretty agreeable, its just a little faint. The taste is pretty sweet, with a nice malt foundation. Hops take over by the finish, though, which is solidly bitter and dry. Despite being a light-bodied brew, this one has a creamy texture to the mouthfeel. It doesnt have the clean taste that I expected, given the style description, but its a very agreeable beer.

It goes down slow, because of it's bitterness and finishes dry and a bit earthy. I like the use of hops, but I think this is a little too much. The mouthfeel is decent.

Has a very faint taste, a bit fruity, with a tad of a bitter afterataste. I'm not a huge fan of the "lighter" beers, so this beer was just ok to medicore.
