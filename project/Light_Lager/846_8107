Sweet and light, just as expected. It is not off-putting by any means. In fact, it has a pleasant sweet and lightly bitter taste, very clean finish, and drinks very much like water.

A brilliantly clear beer fails to hold onto any head, retention, or carbonation because of light protiens and maltiness. Aroma and flavor show a part-grain, part-malt flavor and feel that ultimately falls on the wettened grain side of the fence. Light malt flavor and body makes the beer a bit astringent and begins to show vegital and sulfer notes as the beer warms, creating a harsh environment for light beers.

It's yellow, it's fizzy, and it tastes pretty average. But, it goes down pretty smooth.

2.79,-1.1,1.5,2.5,3,3,3,"D-As far as light beers go, at least this one had some taste and it wasnt that bad either. It is hot sticky and humid in PR so a 10oz can or bottle of this hits the spot.","sleazo","Jun 19, 2007"

3.13,11,3,2.5,3,3.5,4,"The mouth is well carbonated and a trifle slick. This is an easy enough drinker. It seems well matched to the locale. Its light enough to drink in the heat, but has much more substance than Bud or Miller Lite.","Redrover","Aug 30, 2005"
2.7,-4.3,2,2,3,3,3,"Drank from the can and on tap, but thought it tasted better out of the can. Had it while on vacation in Rio Grande, PR. Pours a standard macro light lager yellow with a small white head. Taste was similar to a Miller Lite, with corn and rice malt flavors and absolutely no hop presence. For what it is, it tastes pretty good, and it is refreshing in the hot and humid weather. Definitely prefer this to a Coors Light and high above a Bud Light, about the same as a Miller Lite for me. Worth a try if you are in Puerto Rico, but certainly don't go searching for it. Drinkability is good because you can't get enough cold beverages when it is that hot out.","pbr85","Feb 17, 2005"
2.08,-26.2,2.5,2,2,1.5,2.5,"This is a clean beer, with extremely low bitterness. A little corny, but not in a bad way. (relative here, please).Tastes just like Coors Light IMO.","yen157","May 24, 2004"

3,6.4,3,3,3,3,3,"While in PR, do what the locals do, drink Medalla Light. The color was the standard light straw yellow with very little foam when poured. The taste was just OK, nothing to write home about. A standard lager light. A possible quincher on hot days to cool yourself off. Can't find anything of interest to write about this beer, just that if your visiting Puerto Rico, try it!","BeerManDan","Beers"
3.26,15.6,4,3,3,3,4,"This is the standard local beer in Puerto Rico. It comes in 10 oz. cans but this review is for the 12 oz. bottles. Bottle says it's a little over 3 carbos per bottle, which makes it a pretty low-card brew. It must be drunk very cold to avoid off tastes, and is pretty tasty if done so. It is in the US Light Lager category--not a favorite of mine, but acceptable in hot weather. Also pretty cheap, around $1 each in bars outside of the pricy areas of PR.","jermar","0"
