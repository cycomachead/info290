I poured it out and it was a light yellow color with a medium head. The smell is of malt and some wheat. The taste is pretty watery to me. It has a little bit of malt and thats really it. The mouthfeel is pretty average. It is pretty crisp and a bot of carbonation. Overall this beer is not that good.

2.85,-5.9,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,4,"This review is short and sweet. This is a typical light beer with some more flavor. If you don't like lights don't drink this one it's no different. Nice look with a puffy white head. Smell is sort of malty and sweet. Mild malt flavor kind of like corn. Decent carbonation and very, very smooth and drinkable. Low ABV and the $ of Shiner(especially the variety pack) make for a good choice for macro drinkers to jump into the world of craft brewing. Most of Shiner beers are not too over the top and this is no exception. Good beer Spoetzl Brewery","midwestbrewers","Dec 20, 2010"
3.73,23.1,3.5,3,4,4,4,"Probably one of the better "Light" beers I've had. Pours a plae amber color with a decent head as the slight scent of malts tickle your nose. Upon drinking there is complex malt taste which leaves the beer weaker in taste but still has a rather indepth texture to it that finishes rather smooth. Something better to try than the ol' Miller Lite and Bud Light.","Lemke10","Nov 29, 2010"

3,-1,3,3,3,3,3,"Poured from a bottle in a mixed six pack into my favorite pint glass. The light straw color and one inch head was pretty nice for a light brew.

Fits the style of a Light Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, yeast, hops, and slight wheat. Overall, this is one of the best Light Lagers I've ever had. Good flavor, nice blend, and easy drinkability.","Tone","Jun 02, 2009"
2.61,-13.9,3,2,2,3.5,4,"Verdict: This is still a step, albeit not a massive one, up from Bud/Miller/Coors Light. Despite being pretty bland and boring, I still think this beer still serves it's purpose. Texans used to the normal light beers aren't going to be scared off by this, and hopefully they'll start exploring the rest of the Shiner line and beyond.","BeanBone","May 25, 2009"
3.93,29.7,5,2,4.5,3.5,5,"Drinkability: This gets a five for being a great light beer. It's drinkable and refreshing enough to pass for a light lager, but doesn't compromise too much on flavor. This is a beer that shouldn't be ignored simply because it says "Light" on the label and is well worth a shot.","Mosstrooper","May 23, 2009"
3.2,5.6,2.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,4,"Pours a crystal clear golden color with a fluffy white head. Lots of carbonation bubbles in the glass. The smell isn't too appealing, some very sweet honey malt aromas, but it resembles a stale beer on a bar room floor type smell. Taste is ok, it starts off with a good sweet malt flavor and then finishes with some earthy hop flavors. Very simple flavors and well balanced. I kept getting some metallic tang tastes, not on every sip, so it might just be me. Carbonation is a little too high, sound like pop rocks are going off if you hold a sip in your mouth. Drinkability is good.","Kromes","May 18, 2009"
3.53,16.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The taste falls somewhere in between that caramel corn that comes in those big-ass tins at christmas time and some burnt white bread toast. It is actually a pretty flavorful light lager with nice carbonation. Refreshing and crisp. Not that I reach for a light lager very often, but this is not a bad choice for the style.","twiggamortis420","Beers"
3.22,6.3,4,2,3.5,3,4,"D- Definitely drinkable. I may even like this one better than the standard shiner bock. While I think it has less flavor, it's cleaner and more drinkable, which is usually what I'm looking for anyway when I turn to Shiner.","zdk9","0"
3.49,15.2,4.5,3,3.5,3,4,"Pours a deep gold color. Looks really good of a light lager. Big rocky white head that dissipated quickly. Leaves way more lace than I would have thought. Smells faintly of grain and pale malt. I can taste some pale malt notes barely, maybe some hops? Since this is a light lager I didn't expect much, and I didn't get too much flavorwise. Still, this beer has more character than Shiner Blonde (oddly). Probably the best "lite" beer I've had.","drunkboxer1","Apr 21, 2009"

Light aroma, typical aroma of a light lager, not very appealing. Nutty taste, nutty carbonated aftertaste. Light mouthfeel, somewhat creamy body. Pretty clean aftertaste.

The aroma was pretty much a light version of standard macro lager smells. The flavors were very washed out, dry grains, pale malt and lager malt, all bleached away. The body was medium. The mouthfeel average and the carbonation a little prickly. Sadly, the way it looked was the best part.","thekevlarkid","Aug 25, 2006"
3,-1,3,3,3,3,3,"This is basically your average macro light lager nothing special at all about it. It smells a lot like a bud light with grainy malt scents.

I would rather drink this than a Coors light though durring the summer.","armock","Jun 10, 2006"
3.95,30.4,4,4,4,3.5,4,"This is a very good light beer. It pours a very nice looking clear, amber color. The smell is lightly hoppy. The taste is not heavy and there is a slight crisp malt that is balanced with a slight bite of the hops. No real special flavors. Natually, if you are looking for a beer that has a lot of flavor, this would not be your brew. But, if you are in the mood for something refreshing that also has some taste, this is a very good choice. Further, the beer goes very well with food, such as pizza, as it has just enough flavor to do so. Since the beer is fairly light, this would be an ideal brew for a hot day (which is most days here in central Texas) out by the pool or just hanging around.","AustinBeerLvr","May 05, 2006"

3.18,5,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Not a bad light lager, just lacking depth. Pours out to a rich yellow color, with a foamy head that quickly calms to about 1/16th of an inch. Some lacing. Aromas are weak; kind of smelled like wet cardboard mixed with malt and some hops. Taste was fair, but unremarkable; maltiness, bread, hints of hops and dried sugar cane. Mouthfeel was zesty and refreshing. Drinkability is north of average. A touch more on the flavor, with some more complexity, and this would be fantastic. Nonetheless, it's not bad. Special thanks goes out to assurbanipaul for the sample.","Frozensoul327","Nov 07, 2005"
4.03,33,4.5,4,4,3,4.5,"Overall this is quite the treat, i am very suprised with this. Very tasty and i would get it again, matches with my favorite lights, abita and sam adams. good stuff. for its style, i think its the best this brewery makes.","acrawf6","Sep 19, 2005"
3.33,9.9,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Even then this is summertime, fetch me a cold one, beer. It does have a tinge of malt standing out but that doesnt make it a must try.","beerdiablo","Jul 14, 2005"
3.71,22.4,4,3,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Wow, I was impressed by this one, for what it is. Pours a brilliant gold color, with a decent head retention. Not much aroma going on here. Faint tastes of bread dough in this beer, not much else, a touch of hops here and there, but that's about it. Mouthfeel is wonderful for a light beer, it's acutally kinda thick, not thin watery crap. Very drinkable, especially on a hot Texas summer day.","deejaydan","Feb 08, 2005"
2.91,-4,2.5,4,2.5,2,3,"Pours to a quickly disappearing head. Color is pale copper color with a dirty brown tinge. Aroma is weak but nicely malty. Flavor is watery and dry with a little fresh Munich malt shining (no pun) through. Hoppiness is there for balance only. Finishes clean. Looks dismal, smells nice, tastes weak and finishes like a regular Shiner Bock.","EagleTalon","Feb 06, 2005"
3.63,19.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"12 oz. brown bottle, a beer from the texas sampler from assurbanipaul. Noticably darker than many light beers, make than almost any light beer i have had. not much head, just a little layer of foam. Grassy malt dominates the scent, which is not very profound. For a light lager, this is very flavorful and malty. If this was available here (I haven't seen it anywhere, except here) I would see me making this my extended session beer.","TastyTaste","Dec 31, 2004"

3.15,4,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Another beer that I'd call a "premium light beer". Color is light amber with average head. Smell is lightly malty, but nothing to get excited about. Taste is nice and malty. Basically this is Shiner Bock light. Very full for something labled as "light". Drinkability is very good. All in all this isn't spectacular, but very good for a light beer. I'd drink it again without complaint.","Gagnonsux","0"
2.91,-4,3.5,2.5,2.5,2,4.5,"12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a very light copper color with one finger of head. There is a little bit of lacing. The smell is a little malty and grassy, but not too much going on there. The taste is a little sweet with some caramel flavors, not much hops or anything else going on. The mouthfeel is light and watery. The drinkability is good though. It's just there.","SheepNutz","May 19, 2004"
3.63,19.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"When i don't wanna get that 'full' feeling on a hot summer day, i'll grab for the Shiner Light, otherwise, i'll take the original or just something else.","rockdick","Jan 16, 2004"
2.93,-3.3,5,2,2.5,2.5,4.5,"Mouthfeel is rather watery but palatable, indeed, very drinkable. Not my favorite style but better than any other light beer I've tried. If you are to judge beers strictly within the style, this has to receive high marks.","assurbanipaul","Nov 21, 2003"
3.25,7.3,3,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Shiner Light comes with a medium-sized, white, noisy, coarse head and a clear, orangey/amber body. Dusty, tangy nose is just a little grainsy, just a little sourish. The front is a touch fruity, thinning through the somewhat watery middle to a surprising finish: some evident hops and grains. Just a little metal. This is not bad. Actually, it's not too far off Shiner Bock. A decent, fairly tasty, light beer.","kbub6f","Nov 01, 2003"
3.4,12.2,3,3,3.5,3,4,"Mouthfeel was strictly average. Like most light beers, it was HIGHLY drinkable. If you are tired of the usual light beer parade and want to try something a little different, this a good one to pour. It's only available in Texas right now, but I would imagine that Shiner will expand distribution if this beer becomes popular. My guess is that it will be.","Dubblebock","Beers"
2.88,-5,3,2.5,3,3,3,"Pours a very clear pale golden amber color with a short white head that quickly dissipates into a thin and wispy lace. Nose is rather clean with some notes of grain and some underlying semi-floral aromas. Very light and crisp in texture with a moderate amount of active carbonation. Taste begins with a sweet grain flavor that begins to turn bitter as notes of grain husks begin to express themselves. There is also a bit of a steely metallic flavor that becomes more pronounced towards the end of the taste that eventually gives way to a light lemony hop bite. Nothing special, though for a light beer, this is a step up from the macros.","Morris729","0"
