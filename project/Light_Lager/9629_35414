Not a beer that I would pick up when looking for a unique sensory experience.","MBbeerking14","Apr 27, 2014"

3.58,7.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 6/19/2013. Pours lightly hazy pale golden straw color with a small fairly dense white head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of cracker, bread, pear, apple, grape, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, yeast, and light hops; with solid strength. Taste of pear, apple, grape, cracker, bread, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, cracker, bread, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice and pleasant balance of malt and yeast ester flavors; with solid robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light bodied; with a very smooth and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very solid craft brewed light lager. Nice balance of flavors with solid robustness; and very smooth to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering.","superspak","0"

3.68,10.2,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall I thought this was an ok beer and very good example of the style, it was very true to style and it had all the aspects that I look for in the style, so far I would say there's hasn't been a Light Lager that I enjoy drinking more than this one. This beer had great drinkability, it was very smooth, clean, not filling, but the flavors didn't do the best job at holding my attention, but this style never does and as a session and all day drinking beer goes this is a good example of it and I think drinking a six pack through out the day wouldn't be a problem. What I liked the most about this beer was the how true to style it was, Short's didn't do anything crazy with this one, it's just a quality Light Lager the way it should be. What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, I thought it was a little hazy for the style. I would buy this beer again when in the mood for the style and if I had a choice between this and all the other popular Light Lagers I would take this one for sure. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the style and it might make for a good brew to ease someone into to the Short's lineup. All in all I was happy with this beer, I love good craft beer as much as the next person but there's always a time and a place for a Light Lager and if I'm going to drink one I would prefer a quality one and that's exactly what this beer is. Good Job Shorts.","StoutHunter","Aug 13, 2013"
