3.1,29.7,4,3.25,3,2.75,3,"Michelob Ultra Fruit Lime Cactus  brewed by Anheuser-Busch, with an ABV of 4.2%  This brew pours out a nice light amber color with a small white head.  The smell is crisp with lime and citrus. You pick up on minor grans in this brew. Now for the taste; it is lime with little to no grains at the end.  Michelob Ultra Fruit Lime Cactus puts you in the mind of 7 up. The mouthfeel is light with some lime.  Overall I'm giving this brew a 3 out of 5.  Not the worst brew I've had but not the best. There is not much to this brew.","nicholas2121","Sep 05, 2014"

The beer is a wheat yellow type of color, and is very carbonated (has a huge head if you pour it into a glass). I personally enjoy the carbonated beer. It has an intense lime flavor, and IMO a MUCH better tasting beer than bud lite lime or any other lime beers out there. Has a crisp finish with little after taste. I call this beer a "candy" beer among my friends because it is so light and tasty. Lots of you beer purists will laugh at me for even rating this beer. I'm not a purist by any stretch of the imagination, I'm just a sucker for citrus tasting things and was fortunate to stumble upon the beer when I was in college. Thank the Lord that I did. Great beer to drink during the warm months of the year. Would recommend this to anyone who likes citrus tasting beer. Cheers!","Svyturys30","Apr 29, 2014"

Tastes of watered down lime punch, artificial flavor; kind of like a couple of lime Jolly Ranchers dissolved in a glass of water (I think I’m sensing a theme here). Faint astringent note, with a slightly dry, mildly alcoholic finish. Of the three “flavored” Mich Ultras I tried, the Lime Cactus was the only one that had any kind of alcohol flavor whatsoever. Mouth is fizzy and wet, and wholly underwhelming. Overall, it’s inoffensive, not overly sweet, and quenching. It’s the least offensive of the 4-flavor Mich Ultra multipack.","jettjon","Jun 06, 2011"

Keeping with the theme of simplicity and American pride, the bottle is twist-off which makes it even easier to quaff post-ride. My hands are sensitive and tender after a long excursion on the bicycle; I'm told Michelob's caps are tightened to a precise 2.8n/m which makes them easy to twist off, but ensures maximum oxygen barrier capacity. No detail is ignored. Step back and take a good look: From the light blocking clear bottles to the Neuvo-Americano label design, the true treasure is all around -- not just in the brew.

Malternatives came around. A-B introduced Tequiza. It laid dormant for a while, and now Miller's introduced "Chill". Now comes Ultra Lime Cactus, but I have to say, except for jamming a wedge of lime in a bottle of cerveza Mexicana, I like this one the best. It's delicately sweet, it's delicately tart; it's got flavors of lime and a bit of cactus (I'm not really sure what that is); and it's light and easy to drink. It may not offer enough to bring you back for more than one or two, but isn't that the Michelob Ultra drinker anyway? And it's not overly sweet like Mike's Hard Mike-Arita, or overdone with agave like Tequiza, or too salty like Miller Chill. Nope, this one's perfectly balanced. It's just light beer with a touch of sweetish lime to soften and smooth it up. I'd never pass up a crisp pils for this, but during a hot day on the greens, or while slaving over the coals at the family 4th of July party, I'd gladly knock back one - maybe two.","NeroFiddled","May 13, 2007"

2.57,7.5,2.5,3,2.5,2,2.5,"Anheuser Busch / Michelob is trying this new experiment with their Ultra light beers. Apparently trying to give them some flavor without adding calories. The lable reads, "Pilsner Beer with Natural Flavor). The series include a Tuscan Orange Grapefruit, Raspberry Pommegranite, and this Lime Cactus beers. All exhibit the poor beer malt / hop characters as the Ultra, but with contributing flavors that undoubtedly improve the flavors, but by no means, make them better beers. I was afraid the Lime Cactus was the formation of Tequiza Light, but gladly, I was wrong. The beer shows a distict lime flavor that dominates the nose, but adds no depth, body, or meaningful character. Like the others, it's likable, but certainly not beer.","BEERchitect","0"
