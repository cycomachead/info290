2.25,1.4,,,,,,"Brew pours a pale straw-yellow in color with a very thin white head. Nothing really to mention for any lacing. The aroma is on the 'skunky' side (seems like MOST beers in a green bottle is like this for some reason) with some grains. Pretty much the same is said for the taste also with a metallic tasting soda water style flavor that is very watered down.. Nothing special here at all and won't try it again. Light bodied with high carbonation.","BeerWithMike","Nov 28, 2014"

The smell is grain/barley and pilsner hops. The taste is sharp, pilsner hops strike first, then a slight balance of malt, the aftertaste is bitter. The mouthfeel is lacking because of the very light body, which is good if it is a hot afternoon. Overall it is a better than bud light...average beer.","WoodBrew","Oct 29, 2011"

Bud 55 is awful and MGD 64 is meh....Miller Lite clocks in at 96 cals and is probably your best bang for your light buck, but if you truly are counting cals then pop open a Becks Light. I've been on a health kick lately and still enjoy the real stuff, but if cutting cals from your diet while still being able to drink some beer, pick this over Bud Light, Coors Light, Amstel Light, Miller Light, Sam Light, Whatever Light.","haggis","Mar 23, 2011"

What I could pick up was maybe a hay, or wheat smell. Again very very faint, and hardly there at all. The taste was very light and non descript, but that is about what one would expect from a light lager. A light grain, just enough of a taste to know I was not drinking water would be the best way to describe it. Decent feel, again just the cold well carbonated.

A tad bit lighter than Beck's with a little more Stella-like carbonation. The smell was surprisingly good and un-skunked. I give it to the European light beer makers; they keep the light versions of their beers un-skunked somehow. The taste? Along with Heineken light, one of the best light beers I've ever encountered. I'm amazed that its 65 calories too. Thats about four of these for one 16 oz bottle of Coca-Cola calorie wise, and thats damn impressive! The mouthfeel is thin as expected, but hey, what do you want when you're buying this beer? Reminds like a lot like a Stella for how this beer drinks. Goes well with uncomplicated snacking food.

The taste is mild and boring, but theres offensive in there. Well, not until you get to the husky finish. It has a thin body, crisp & dry texture, and moderate carbonation.

It does taste very watered down, but I'm trying this beer immediatly after a normal Beck's, which might impair my judgment a little. I suppose not having that intense skunk flavor is a good thing. It doesnt taste bad, but it hardly tastes like much at all. Overall, not a bad beer, but just too watery for my liking.

I don't usually go for light beers, and wouldn't have gotten it at it's usual $22 retail price--regular and dark Beck's are both better and are the same retail price--but at the sale price, it was competing with the likes of Busch and Keystone, and at this level it competes well, and you need make no apologies for making the purchase. Tastes similar to regular Beck's but lighter, thinner, and grainier. It even has some of that familiar astringent kick towards the end, but of course a much weaker version. It's drinkable and has a clean finish. Really clear and light colored. As with any green or clear bottled beer, don't get the open six-packs; stick with the 12 packs and cases, hence avoiding the frequently mentioned skunkiness (and are in any event a better buy).","Rumpole","Feb 18, 2005"

Not all that much flavor, amazingly overpriced as well. Oddly this was less skunky than regular Beck's, who knew? Amstel Light is a much more flavorful light lager for the price, if you don't want to pay much stick with American light beers if it's your style over this overpriced import.","TheDeuce","Jan 31, 2005"

Aroma is that usual "seems skunky" scent that Beck's and Heineken seem to have, although perhaps even more so. Taste is almost non-existant, seeming more like slightly smoothed water, with a small bitter kick at the end. I know it's a light beer, but come on.

2.6,17.1,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Im not really overly impressed about this beer in any way, but as a Beck's fan from way back (i was weaned on the stuff by my older bro), I will say this does taste the way a Beck's light should taste if I had to imagine it. The color is that of a cheap pinot grigio, though there is a decent head on this thing, and a modest stick as well as lace. Aroma is all beck's skunk! Need i say more? The mouthfeel is just a step above water, with a mildly crisp snap of refreshment. Flavors are typical Beck's skunk-o-rama, sweet malty, grainy and a tad cloying, but mildly quenching. This stuff goes well with frozen pizza-i tried one with a pie that i stipped off all the crappy topping and added my own (delicious?) Broccoli and returned the cheese-a light delight. Though sick to say, this stuff is mildly drinkable in my book.","moulefrite","Jun 04, 2004"

1.71,-23,2.5,1.5,1.5,2,2,"Whatever they are charging for this stuff, it is not worth the import price. At the very most, this beer is boring. Cheap tasting and skunky, I will stay away from this one.","Beastdog75","Jul 03, 2003"
2.61,17.6,3,2,2.5,3.5,3,"Green = Skunky. Damn, this could be a half decent light beer, were it not produced in green. When will they learn? Straw colored with a nice foamy white rapidly dissipating head. A thin spider web lace trails along. The skunk-like aroma hides a fragrant malt and floral hop. The thin herbal malt is completely dominated by sharp metallic and underlying citrus bitterness. Still one of the better light beers around. Might even give Sam Adam's Light a run for their money...in dark brown bottles.","BeerResearcher","Apr 19, 2003"

2.43,9.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,"I bought this out of curiosity, being something of a German beer lover. It pours like regular Beck's, looks like regular Beck's, but it isn't Beck's. The taste is very watered down, disappointingly so. I can't really tell much more, other than I hated it. I actually got sick to my stomach drinking this stuff. Sorry, I wanted to like it.","Rifrafboy","Feb 17, 2003"
2.26,1.8,3,2,2,2,3,"As a rule, I would not touch a beer labeled Light, but Becks makes some drinkable beers. On the pour a light clear gold, the head a bright white, the lace decent. Nose is malt, a tad sweet, clean and crisp. Front is malt, the top thin, the finish is dry, highly acidic, lightly hopped, and as I expected, something that does not appeal to me, not that it is bad, just not my style of beer, but would appeal to the occasional beer or light beer drinker.","Gusler","Jan 04, 2003"
2.02,-9,2,2.5,2,2,1.5,"Packaged in a clear glass bottle, which in my opinion does nothing for the longevity of this beer. Not that this should be saved really. Poured a clear golden color with a white head that disappeared quickly. Aroma consisted of hops, slight fruitiness, alcohol and lemon. Mouthfeel was watery with a crisp tingling from the carbonation. Not much as far as taste goes. The first thing apparent was the alcohol with a hop finish. Beer had a skunkiness to it both in smell and taste. I would not purchase this again if I were in the mood for a light beer.","Winter","Nov 25, 2002"

Man...no wonder it was 50-cents a bottle...doesn't taste skunked...light straw color...mild graininess on the nose..taste is very light but there is some OK graininess emerging...body is thin, but not obscene..Compared to some of the other lights this is OK...I'm not a big fan of Beck's and would never buy this again...It is much worse than S.A Light but ok when compared to Coors Light etc...","ZAP","Oct 31, 2002"
2,-9.9,2,2,2,2,2,"Okay, I am still waiting for the major brewies to get a light beer right.  The Europeans still do a better job than us with things like this and Amstel, but they still don't touch what the smaller makers are doing.","Wildman","Jun 01, 2002"

If I want light beer, not that I ever do, I’ll just stick to domestic light beer. Don’t waste your time on this one. Has a similarity to Amstel Light though the head is better in this beer.","Jason","Apr 30, 2002"

2.12,-4.5,2,2.5,2,2,2,"Pale, pale, greenish yellow, "champagne-like" head that lasts for 20 seconds and then is completely gone.  Skunky aroma, "Beck's-like" in first impression but very fleeting.  The skunk/crisp combo makes is seem mildly "German import-like" but the taste finishes with a distinct distilled water taste.  Anyone want the rest of the six pack?","ADR","Mar 11, 2002"
