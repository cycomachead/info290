That's probably why it was so cheap.  Easy to drink a bunch of these ice cold.  Miller Lite gets the job done with low calories and a low price.  The flavor and overall experience are just OK.

I you had miller lite, colors light and bud light next to each other in a blind taste test you would definitely be able to tell a noticeable difference.  Why you would want to do a light beer taste test I'm not sure :)  My favorite beers are Heady and Dinner but I also love Miller Lite and I'm not afraid to say it!

To do so is shameful and you should be whipped with wheat and corn shucks. Maybe even a branch or two. For what it is, "a fine pilsner" it is not, however a "decent light pilsner" would be more appropriate. This has more flavor than the ever popular Bud Light, but BL has the jump on smell and drinkability. Keystone/Coors Light has the jump on drinkability, it is the king of smooth in the light category.  Now what Miller has is the flavor. The flavor, baby. That's the only thing saving it. So if you want a "dash" more flavor in your light beer and don't mind chucking the nose and mouthfeel out the window, you may have found your (light) white buffalo.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Sep 03, 2014"

4.75,119.9,,,,,,"Amongst macro light beers, this is one of the very few (if not only) that somehow manages to squeeze in a pinch of pilsener/helles-like flavor. Since I appear to alone in rating ML based on the fact that it is light, I proudly recommend this as one of the best in the category.  While I've had an occasional micro light lager that surpasses Miller, these have been rare and hard to come by. Obviously, this is not a style commonly braved by craft brewers. Personally, I think this is a pity, as there remains so much unexplored potential... That's right, believe it or not, light beer can actually be good and I challenge any brewers reading this to see if they.have what it takes to manifest such a brew! As it stands, this is pretty much as good as light lagers get. Minus .25 for ad execs spelling like Toys-R-Us kids.","Silvertrees","Aug 21, 2014"

This light beer tastes better than most other light beers such as Coors Light, Bud Light, etc.. because it has a thicker taste and tastes more like regular beer. However the label lies saying its a Fine Pilsner Beer and its anything but fine. For light beer its drinkable but not something I would prefer to drink or enjoy drinking. Great for parties or events to bring beer to share since its pretty cheap.","snitsky","Aug 11, 2014"

If I wrapped my hand around the glass and then looked in then it looked golden, but that is a lot of help. No smell to speak of, but nothing off-putting. Then the taste, I was disappointed. Nothing bad but nothing good either. I went back and forth in the range of 2.5 to 3 but then thought, I would rather drink water then use of liver function on this.

Now, first off, they can't even spell Light right, so you all know how this is going to turn out. Pours out a Light Amber Color. The Smell is that of an american style light beer. The taste is nothing special it is light almost like water. Nothing bad, but nothing good. Overall, I give this a 3- not good ,but not bad.

That being said, it has more color than a bud or coors and many others, and has more flavor and a stronger smell than many lite beers. Whether one likes it or not is subjective. Yeah, it probably does taste like water after you've had a few. That's usually the case with ANY light beer. You don't drink a lite beer like wine and sip it for an hour. Most people I know who drink any light beer aren't looking for spectacular taste or want to sit and analyze the flavor sip by sip. They want cold, refreshing alcohol that won't fill them up, and usually its only the first sip of a light beer that I've ever heard, " damn that's good". This is basically that, drink it before it gets warm, don't expect a lot of impressive flavor. It's a straight up beer. Few people crave salads, they don't offer excessive and awesome flavor, but its something to eat. Few people crave light beer, but its a beer to drink.","Maximot","Dec 18, 2013"

The appearance is bland and sickly at best, the nose is non-existent and the coldness of serving temperature way overpowers any possible flavor you might get out of this. The mouthfeel was somewhat redeeming, since it made the beer very spritzy- almost like a soda, though with a flavor as bland as this, I think I would have preferred to be drinking that!","Beric","Aug 28, 2013"

I don't mind the mouthfeel, which is well carbonated and maybe a little meatier than some of its peers, but the taste is so minimal and bad. old malt, out of place sweetness, generic yeast, it just isn't very good. I guess for a late night games of kings cup or something it is passable, but at that point there are better options for less money. sometimes the commercials are comical, but that's about all I can really say for miller lite. hope to not encounter this again, but what are the odds of that.","StonedTrippin","Jun 17, 2013"

It's main issue is that it's just another run of the mill American lager. It's got only a slight spicy hop note, but that's about all that makes it different from Bud or Coors Light.

I must say that although appearance and aroma is somewhat lacking compared to bud light, the flavor is much cleaner and the mouthfeel benefits from an added dryness. This beer does a better job of hiding that it is based on cheap adjuncts and beats out Bud Light in my opinion. Overall, a middle-of-the-road Light American Lager.","Bockrules","Apr 03, 2013"

The smell is a very weak one and you can smell the corn and rice they use to brew it. The color is pale golden and it just looks watered down. Tastes very coppery,like I'm drinking the can and not the beer.

Pours a Light golden straw color with a decent head that slowly dissipates to a cap on top leaving lots of lace on the way down. Pilsner malt, and a light nondescript spiciness provides balance. There's not a whole lot going on in the aroma here. The taste is lightly bready with a crisp almost tart spiciness that does well to balance any malt that might show up. Thin body with a thin watery mouthfeel and an ample amount of carbonation. There's certainly nothing overly offensive here, but at the same time there's nothing exciting here either. This might make an ok lawnmower beer, but I can think of many with some flavor that I would pick over this.","johnnnniee","Jun 11, 2012"

At 96 calories, Lite is a good option for people on a diet, much like Michelob Ultra, at 95 calories. In fact, Miller Lite could certainly advertise as a diet beer like Ultra does.

Smells of sweet grains, probably from the corn being used in the brewing, but not that strong. Almost no taste at all. Mainly water, but has a slight taste of beer. Goes down smooth, but again, it is like carbonated water with a little beer taste, but definitely drinkable for long periods.

I guess I'm just looking at the bright side of things, since I've been enduring some pretty bad adjunct lagers recently. I want to give this some point on the smell for smelling what I would call less offensive, but really, less smell, and less taste in any beer is not a rewardable thing. I mean....I'm really confused here, because I enjoy drinking it, it's not a bad thing to drink, but that's because it has absolutely no flavor, it might as well be sparkling water, seriously. I dunno, I can't give it 1.5 in every category, and since BA got rid of the drinkability tab, I guess I have to give it a 2 on taste. I mean if I was just rating it as a beverage I would give it a 3, but as a beer it gets a 1.5, maybe 2 because it has absolutely no flavor.

The head is gone almost immediately, other than a thin ring around the edge of the glass. Impressed with the clarity of the brew and nothing else. Smells of corn, and maybe a bit a wheat.

This is advertised as 'triple hops brewed', but there is no hop presence. The tiniest hint of sweetness lingers behind and then fades. The mouthfeel is very light and thin, but aggressively carbonated. Almost abrasive, like a diet soda.

Not a cornucopia of beer goodness, but more like cracking a can of corn while the wife is removing nail polish in the next room....but I don't care. The taste is so minimal and faint it is hard to say it is there...a dash of "triple hops" and some sweet malt; some club sodium taste from the carbonation. This hardly counts as flavor. The beer looks extremely carbonated when I first poured in my glass, and is not smooth but kinda prickly on the tongue. I would say it is overcarbonated and MORE FILLING, with less taste that is not that great either, and overall just not that drinkable.

The aroma was comprised of malt and wheat. The flavor was of water, wheat, and malt. It was light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this brew is not that great unless you want to play the mass consumption game. So Miller, where are the hops you promised me in the commercials?

Don't see alot of carb action though.

Anyways, about twice as yellow, piss looking as a Heineken, yet actually produces a decent mouthful.

Reminds me of the dry beers of a few years ago. Somewhat of a grainy/corn flavor. No real body whatsoever. At least BUD has some "umph" to it but theres nothing here. Ok overall for what it is trying to be. I think you have to try these beers with an open mind as to what theyre are meant to be. (Check my review of BUD-as a macro I think its great). This really has little if any flavor or body. If I wanted to slam a beer after mowing the lawn or have somewhat of a beer flavor with a plate of spicy food ok it might work.

Always a problematic beer for bartenders because there's no body to hold the carbonation in, thus quite a bit of foaming. The carbonation doesn't help to give any mouthfeel, leaving it "watery" (no joking). The flavor is extremely light with just a swirl of malt and no hop. There's no real finish, just a light coating in the mouth. I'm not sure about "tastes great", but it's definitely "less filling". Very drinkable because each mouthfull leaves you empty.

2.47,14.4,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"A very watery beer.  This is the beer that started the light beer craze back in the 70s and well, things haven't been quite the same since have they?  My father drinks this and only this.  It doesn't have alot of taste, and of course, its watery, but its not horrible.  On a hot day, it will quench your thirst.  If you are going for flavor then this isn't what you want to drink.","proc","Mar 22, 2002"
2.14,-0.9,3,1.5,2,2,3,"darker than most bright lagers, but does that count for anything?  a swill beer that can be drank endlessly without fear of getting sick.  i hate that adjunct taste and smell and it's so fizzy and metallic! ugh!  a true pilsener?  WHAT???  ok that all said...when you're stuck in the desert and you have to choose between this and coors light....you pick this.","budgood1","Mar 20, 2002"
2.05,-5.1,1.5,1.5,2,2,3,"Again, no idea of the color as I never saw it on the way from the can to my piehole. Definitely more "beerlike" than tha Bullet, with less of an off-grainy taste - I'll agree with a previous reviewer about a nuttiness to the flavor.  May have briefly detected a hop in there somewhere as well. Not a bad pull if you're at a party with a big ol' cooler full of mixed cans of heavily advertised beer.","sponberg","Mar 17, 2002"
2,-7.4,1.5,1.5,2,2.5,2.5,"As far as mass produced american lagers go this one is probably a little better than the others.  It is almost transparent, smells of nothing, tastes of nothing with a slight hop taste that last for about 1 second (this is it's edge), the mouthfeel is ok but the beer is too carbonated to be very drinkable.  Good to get a keg of for all your friends who don't like beer when you have a party.","Murph","Mar 12, 2002"
1,-53.7,1,1,1,1,1,"Watered down look and watered down skunk taste.  OK, here we go...I wasn't going to do this, but I can't help it.  This is what Miller's R&D team manager said at the last meeting before they produced Miller Lite.  "Let's get some bad tasting water and really screw it up, put it in a can, market the mess out of it (because we know this works...see Coors Light), and we'll sell it and tell people they like it, then by the time they figure out this isn't really beer at all, we'll all be rich!"  Enough said.","BeerAngel","Dec 22, 2001"
2.36,9.3,3,2,2,3,3,"This the usual light brewski, same as the rest ... one of the better light beers out there for sure if you are a stickiler to styles. Light bodied, thin lace and minimal head retention. Lots of corn in the aroma and flavor, finishes pretty damn dry. More or less a sad excuse for beer.","Jason","Aug 21, 2001"
