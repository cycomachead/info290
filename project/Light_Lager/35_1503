So many light beers taste like corn or nothing. This one has malt character and faint hop. I'm not going all the way to say it's the best beer in the world, but it just may be the best tasting light lager I've tried yet.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Oct 16, 2014"

I was looking for a low alcohol session beer and thought to give SA Light a try again. This time around I was disappointed. It looks great with its amber color and thick head. To me it leaves a hard water dry aftertaste. That is all I seem to get from its flavor profile. For what I got and for what I paid ($9.19 a six-pack) I won't be purchasing this beer again. This is the first SA beer that I can say I did not care for.","nota","Mar 15, 2014"

If you're looking for a session beer, or just don't want a beer that's so heavy, you really can't go wrong with this one.","DeFaz","Jul 15, 2013"

I personally believe that light beers are beers for people who care more about their appearance than they do their beer and/or don’t like the flavor of beer and therefore drink the light beers because they have practically no flavor. That being said, Samuel Adams’ Light beer was pretty good. It had some beer flavor, not as much as I think that it should, but some, and it sure as hell didn’t look like a glass of urine like all of the other major light beers do.","Jeffreysan","Jul 10, 2013"

I was turned on to it by a friend who told me that SA uses it to train their beer tasters and it is used in to train beer judges for competitions. It is a very neutral tasting beer and additions can be made to it to help judges or tasters identify off tastes or maltiness or hoppiness. Plus for me it was a gateway beer to widen my wife's taste for beer. She is an AB Budweiser girl all the way and she really likes this beer. She started drinking Grolsch this week. The recovery is going slow but soon she will drink real beer! So for those of you looking to introduce a hardened BMC drinker into the wonderful world of craft beer this is a good beer to start with. And hey it's definitely a drinkable session beer that's relatively low in calories and cheap and if you are down to your last beer you can grab one from your girl and not have to choke down a bud lite or (shudders) Natty Light from a can.","tekn0ph1sh","Feb 02, 2013"

Flavors are clean and crisp with caramel malts but there is a earthy and toasted flavor that tastes more like a bad macro brewed beer. Light to medium body and moderate to high carbonation. Actually this is a pretty bad light beer. I would rather have a coors light than this one. The flavor is sour and not very palatable. Wouldn't have this again.","kylehay2004","Dec 30, 2012"

3.38,3.7,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"The beer pours a very clear and clean amber with a slight rose tint. The body is superbly clean and translucent, as it should be for the style, with lots of nice carbonation bubbles, and a light scrim head of eggshell white bubbles that sit at the top of the beer. Lacing is slick and thin, running right back to the beer and not waiting around for awhile on the glass. On the nose, the beer smells of sweet caramel malts with a light grassy touch stepping through from the Noble hops. Cereal grain scents can be detected in the sweet caramel, but the smell is very clean and light, as a light lager should be. It’s actually quite nice to smell in comparison with other light beers. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet clean and light. The beer begins with the sweet caramel malts from the smell and a water-neutral taste that sits separate from the malt, but slowly the taste opens into to grainy cereal and biscuit notes with light grassy side notes. The finish has this weird minty medicinal flavor in it that seems to have been there throughout the sip, but is more prevalent in the aftertaste, although there are also light grain notes. On the mouth this beer is properly thin and watery, with a nice little trundle of carbonation greeting the tongue. The mouth is left supremely clean with only a slight hint of saliva to ask for more beer. The beer is actually quite quenching of thirst. Overall this is a good beer for what it is; in fact it may be the best beer in its style. It is highly drinkable and has some noticeable and interesting flavors with minimal complexity. I could drink a lot of these easily. My only complaint is the weird minty-medicinal taste that seems to be hiding behind everything else. Overall, this beer is a success for what the Boston Beer Company was trying to do with it. If you want a light lager, drink this.","Maxwell","Dec 29, 2012"

Beer does not look very lively. Taste is balanced, but bland. Dry body with light carbonation. Bit of a buttery aftertaste. Is drinkable and smooth but certainly not impressive. May have to try again, almost suspicious that I got a subpar batch. Bottle says it's fresh but I've come to expect more from Sam Adams even for a light beer.","Braz","Dec 23, 2012"

It's got a watery mouthfeel, but it has more flavor than nearly every american adjunct full-bodied beer. My father in law drinks Budweiser, and I had him try a sip of Sam Adams Light. He said it was too strong for him. That's how flavorful this beer is. It's probably the best light beer you can buy, but it's essentially just good beer with extra water added. it's sold at the same price as the good stuff.","eric222222","Dec 15, 2012"

The drinkiability is high because it is easy to drink. Overall, this is a good beer for the style, but as a beer it is merely above average. Thus, the price for this beer is not justified.

Pours out a standard transparent amber in color with a sticky two fingered head with a mild level of lacing left behind. Smells of toasted malts and raw cereal grains, tastes of light toasted malts as well combined with actual grainy flavor in a light beer makes me one happy camper! Texture is light but flows well in the mouth without being too watery, finishes crisply. Much better than other light beers I have tried.","WastingFreetime","Feb 16, 2012"

3.92,20.2,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall, and keeping in mind that this is a light beer, it's surprisingly good. It certainly wouldn't keep up with, say, a Dogfish Head, but it wasn't intended to. Sam Adams set out to provide the world with a flavorful light beer, and they did succeed; it's certainly in the top five of the light beers I've tried, and is leagues beyond any Anheuser-Busch light beer. This is not to say that the beer is without its flaws, for it does move too far in the direction of bread and grain flavors, and could use a bit more fruit and sugar (which, yes, would probably add calories) to help soften the flavor profile. But for a light beer, it's delicious: exactly the sort of fare I'd want with lunch after working outside on a hot day.","jondeelee","Dec 03, 2011"

From what other Sam Adams beers that I have had, their Octoberfest and Latitude 48, I have been pretty impressed. But I found Sam Adams Light quite disheartening. While their was a discernibly more malty taste to it as compared to other light lagers, it was not a pleasant maltiness. The taste comes off as a glass of tonic water with a little bit of "quality beer" poured in to top it off. While you can taste that Sam Adams used good ingredients in this offering, it just doesn't transfer to a good experience. When it comes to light lagers I would much rather have a generic BMC.","Shinypoptart","Nov 23, 2011"

I find myself taking huge gulps of it just to taste anything at all. I give it extra points for being a light beer, which probably means I'm giving it a better review than the full flavored Sam Adams. But as it has the same calories as a Guinness Draft, I'll stick with the Guinness.","anglagard1","Aug 24, 2011"

Light bodies with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet watery mouthfeel. This is definitely not my favorite style, but if I had to drink it this would be the one I would choose.

The taste starts out with a sweet caramel taste followed by some grains and a very weak watered down floral and citrus hops to finish off the taste. A lot of the taste reminds me of Boston Lager, but the flavor is so watered down that it ruins the taste of it.

The taste of the beer was light in body, it had a sweet malt flavor and a ever so slight hint of caramel and citrus.

More of the same in the taste: pale malts, lightly toasted, very subdued hoppiness, though it's still present, light caramel.

Not a lot but enough to make it much more enjoyable than bud light. Mouthfeel is surprisingly flat. Finish is brief and clean. Roasted malt lingers for just a second with some sweetness and then vanishes. Nothing fancy.

You can definitely tell its a light beer from the first sip but by no means a Coors, Budweiser or Miller. The slight spicy hop is the very first thing that you taste then with a bready sweet malt ending with a flash of citrus from the hops. You can also taste the yeast mixing quite nicely with the malt and fruitiness from the hops. Extremely well crafted you can tell they put a lot of time into making this a flavorful light beer and making sure all the flavors meld together amazingly. I always notice the yeast taste more in light beers. Whats funny is that this is more flavorful then not the light version of the Big 3 but the full flavored versions of Bud Miller and Coors.... and this is a light beer! Their light beers compared to this are pure water. This is kind of watered down in the body which makes it extremely easy to drink but the flavors hit you and are impossible not to notice.

Moderate level of carbonation and a slightly noticable alcohol character in the back of the throat for only 4%.

Based on the appearance alone you can't tell it's a light beer. The smell was ok, smells much less "cheap" than the average light beer. Has a bit of a grainy smell and a little bit of yeast type aroma, not strong though. You can taste the malt with slight bitter aftertaste, again not too string. I wasn't a big fan of the mouthfeel, I found the carbination bite a bit strong for my liking, not quite as strong as a tonic, but it doesn't last long.

Although this is not technically a lighter version of the Boston Lager, it sure tastes like it! A little less fruity, weaker palate. But certainly the best light beer I've ever had and it is so close to the SABL that they're practically interchangeable.

The malty nose wasn't bad either, but nothing to write home about. Had a much better, more refined taste than pretty much every other pale light lager I've ever tasted.

A touch of quiet malt. Maybe a real subtle hop hint. Not a lot going on here, especially from a usually solid brewer. Carbonation is busy on a slightly thin body. Overall, I'm not impressed. I'll give it a bit of a break cause it's a light lager, and it's honestly probably one of the best I've had.

The retention was decent and the lacing moderate. The aroma was a little macro for my preference but still a good mix of clean lager malt and hoppy bitterness. The flavors were well balanced too, just enough of everything with hints of sweetness and a crisp finish. The aftertaste, however, was a little metallic. But for a light beer the flavors are surprisingly full and malty. The carbonation was a little high obviously being used to "fill in" the beer but the mouthfeel was still relatively smooth. The body was light and a bit watery but again, that's the style so I have to forgive it. Generally, this is a good beer, which is impressive for a Light so I have to give it high marks.

However, it has all of the calories (and taste, plus more) of a normal American style lager, which I think puts it outside of the realm of light beers. This would be a great alternative to regular Budweiser and other domestic macro lagers because of the sheer fact that it actually has taste, and is very very drinkable... even for the "only-drink-to-get-get-drunk" crowd.

The only thing that makes this brew similar to other light beers is the fairly low ABV. After that, all similarities to any other light American beer stop there. All of that being said, I am normally not a light beer drinker, but this one is actually something that is fairly enjoyable. For the style, I would say it's nearly the perfect brew. On a hot day, the thinner mouthfeel and milder flavors of this brew are actually very good.","AustinBeerLvr","Jun 16, 2007"

Some graininess pops up as well. Flavor is metallic, grainy and with too much caramel. Like drinking a popcorn ball. Has a Sweet 'n' Low feel to the sweetness. Mouthfeel is extremely light, seemingly lighter than most light beers as the carbonation is so meek. I'll finish this, I guess.

This was coupled with a slight caramel flavor, and if its really looked for, there is a slight bitterness to the finish. In the mouth, this beer is light-bodied and has high carbonation.

The taste however is not as full as the smell. It is a little watery but you do get the taste of hops that far surpasses other light beers.

A thin body holds a palate of some subtle roasted malt, just the beginning of a floral hop profile, and not much else. I'll say this - you could drink it all day long.

The beer is dark for a "light" beer--almost on the coppery side of golden. Aroma reminded me of keg parties that serve cheap beer, meaning it smelled slightly corny--just like any other light beer. No hops were discernable in the taste or smell, but there was a nice malt flavor with a tiny bit of caramel. It went well with the nuts and made for a nice post-exercise snack.

Light watery brown malts are on display here on the sip. Some light hops pop through as well, but nothing to note really. Sweet caramel and fruit comes through as well for a nice crisp refreshing flavor, and a grainy finish. Lots of carbonation takes this one over with a very watery finish. Overall, it doesn't sound like it, but I like this light brew.

To sum this beer up; There is nothing complex to this beer. It taste very clean. Sam Adams seems to use quality ingredients for the beer. Hence, the two-row malts and noble hops.

Not much of a head, even when getting aggressive with the pour. The small one that does appear fades rapidly into a thin film on top. Suprisingly (it being a light beer and all) I catch a whiff of a nice aroma with the glass still several feet away from my head. Closer inspection of the nose reveals the malts with aromas of dry toast and hints of toffee with a nice little bitter hop crusting. The taste is initially husky, with a slight allusion to toffee, I think I detect a small unfortunate trace of veggie. It finishes very slick and clean with a somewhat robust, yet vague bitterness. The mouthfeel is very light, which would be appealing to some people and is not misplaced. I will say for its style this is probably among the cream of the crop, and is more flavorful than the full-bodied version of some brewers product.

Taste is pretty typical of the style - overcarbonated, riddled with adjunct off-flavors, and not particularly good. However, to compare this against others in the style, it is actually a bright point. The slightly higher than average score I've awarded this offering is to mark that it is slightly better than the average BMC Light. That said, this is definitely in the same class as a BMC Light... Mouthfeel is thin and overcarbonated. Drinkability is comparable with that of other offerings in the style. This is not a beer I consider "good" in any way, but when compared against other offerings in the style, its not terrible.

Albiet, we never would has guessed it to be a light beer. Most of us thought it to be a flavorful, malty session brew-I though it to be a Goose Island Product, flavorful, lighter in style and priced right. It was kind of marzen/Vienna in style-a simple yet well made malt driven brew. Much suprise when we removed the bag! All of us had to admit that this was an above average "light beer."

It is not a 3.5 beer vs. others out of this style. As they say lite beers are like making love in a canoe - f***ing close to water. The two from the Winter Classics variety pack will be it for me.

Unexpectedly big aroma for a light, sharply sweet malt with a little hop character. As for the flavor, more big yet soft malty sweetness. A pretty big dose of it for a light beer, but still far from powerful. It's got a metallic sweetness to it as well, which I don't like. Hops appear in a lingering tingly bitterness that roams about the tongue. More sweet grain in the finish. As expected, it's pretty much a watered-down version of Boston Lager, but it is a bit different, the malt is much sweeter, and just too metallic. It almost has a corn sweetness, but I don't really want to get into that territory, I'm not saying they used adjuncts. Definitely good for a light beer, but the key phrase there is "for a light beer". I'd much rather have a Boston Lager.

Not a great appearance, but at least the head didn't immediately disappear like a Coors Light. The aroma offers a lightly sweet caramel maltiness and very subdued hops. The body is surprisingly firm for a light beer - medium/light - and it's not watery at all. It starts off with a fairly crisp carbonation but loses quite a bit as the beer warms. Fortunately, that allows some more of the flavor to come through, displaying a surprising amount of sweet caramel maltiness. The bitterness and hop flavor are understandably well-heeled. It finishes lightly sweet at first, but quickly dries out with a light touch of hop - similar to many other lights, and even somewhat reminiscent of a non-alcoholic beer. Much better than I'd expected! My new favorite light beer.","NeroFiddled","Nov 10, 2002"

Decent maltiness and noble hop aroma on the nose.  The mouthfeel is almost too carbonated for me to give it a good rating in the drinkablility category.  Pretty big body for a light beer though.  Maybe a little better than medium.  The taste is a notch above most macro brewed light beers.  But it's not that much better.  The noble hops make their presence known only with a slight spiciness.

I was hoping for the former, but looks like we got the latter.  Not to say that this was as bad as most lights, but I expected more.  Light golden color, some sweet grain in the nose.  Flavor was a little course with grain flavors, and the hopping, while I could tell it was Sammy's, was too light to punch up this beer, leaving it weak and flaccid.

Unfortunately, flavorwise this brew falls prey to the typical dearth in flavor of a typical light, and is both thin in body and malt character.  Sweetness is caramel malt derived, and hints of dry, toasty malt provide character a bit above the norm for a light.  Hop bitterness is above the norm and provides a crisp, quenching feel.  Paltry Mittelfruh hop flavor eeks its way in, but isn't assertive enough to prevent overall blandness.  Very well attenuated and dry overall, w/ a slightly watery mouthfeel.  Finishes dry, w/ trace biscuity malt briefly lingering.  SA Light tastes like a Boston Lager diluted with Seltzer water.
