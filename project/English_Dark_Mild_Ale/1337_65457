4,4.4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Mouthfeel was crisp and smooth, with a bit of stickiness at the ends from the malts. Roasty bitterness is advantageous here and the aftertaste was almost non-existent in a good way. Drinkability was great, and I had trouble pacing myself with this - each sip goes down without any fuss while being satisfying each time.","veinless","Beers"
