3.22,-1.5,3.5,3.25,3.25,2.75,3.25,"Overall: not a bad beer - it certainly has a nice flavour profile - but too flat in feel and too limited in flavour for my liking. I will admit that I feel the same way about most English mild ales. Reasonable price at around AU$48 a case or so, but I really would rather pay an extra $10 and just get Coopers' Best Extra Stout.","SmashPants","Aug 09, 2014"
