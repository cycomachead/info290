3.73,-0.3,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"like liquid and slightly watered down bread pudding this one is, caramel and toffee and butter and all of it come from the malts here, no attempts to be dry, with an english ale yeast character and a high degree of residual sugar. bittering hops balance it well though, so the beer is robustly flavored. its darker in color, pushing deep copper, with a tall white lasting head in a big mug at the pub next door to the brewery. it goes down pretty easy for how sweet it is, largely attributable i think to the light body, almost too light for the flavors in this beer, it needs a little more texture. carbonation is fine though, and the beer still comes across pretty rich. a nice hearty take on the style, one of the better and more complete beers i have had from these guys.","StonedTrippin","Oct 14, 2013"

3.73,-0.3,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"A very nice dark amber ale with a smooth finish after the bread, caramel and slightly roasted dark malt flavors. Medium body and easy drinking. Good mouth feel, nice color and smell with the appropriate head for a 4 oz. sampler glass. Would be a nice session beer at 4.6% abv and 20 IBU.","DuncanSimmons","Aug 27, 2009"

3.83,2.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Wow, what an amber. Fuller than most, it's got a lot of really great malt flavor to it. It's not overly sweet, there are some slight hops in there balancing it all out. My favorite part is the appearance, it's a bit dark than I would stereotype. Carbonation is good, and I like the drinkability. Not too shabby.","aggiearcher13","Dec 11, 2004"
