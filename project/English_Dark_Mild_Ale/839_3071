3.9,18.5,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,4,"Overall: this is definitely one of my favourite 'every day' dark beers, along with Carlton Black. They are both an Australian take on the traditional English styles - similar characteristics, but with a lighter body and higher carbonation to make them easier to drink in a session, and more refreshing in the Australian heat. I really would consider them more an excellent version of a dark lager than an English Dark Mild. Decent price too at AU$45 a case of 24 x 375mL. One of my favourite pub beers is a Tooheys Old / Tooheys New black-and-tan. I will say I do prefer Old on tap rather than in the bottle, but good nonetheless.","SmashPants","Oct 15, 2014"

It poured into the glass with a lovely mahogany dark color and the head was thick for a beer on CO2. The nose had hints of coffee and dark chocolate which translated nicely to the taste where I found more dark chocolate notes. The flavour is very nicely balanced. Sweet enough for me while still a bit bitter on the finish to balance it off. A great session brew. Actually, my BA avatar is a photo of this beer at Bondi Icebergs. I highly recomend the pub and the beer. As you can see the view is quite nice. Cheers mates.","sterstar1","Jan 26, 2008"

Tastes nice; mild roast flavors and slight sweet carmel touch, without being the slightest bit "in your face." Is a bit on the thin side, and personally, I like my roast malts a little more standoffish. However, the light touch with the roast malts and smooth mouthfeel make it easy to drop a few back.","amicar","Aug 14, 2004"

1.19,-63.8,2.5,1,1,2,1,"Since the alcohol % taxing debacle in Australia, Tooheys have reduced the percentages of most of their beers. This includes changing the recipe. For Old, it was a big mistake. It used to be a refreshing porter at 4.5% and is now a strange soapy dishwater ale at 4.3% or something like that. I don't know if it was ever 4.8% but I don't have one of the old ones here to compare with - I think it was always 4.5%. Anyway, they changed the label, as Carlton did with VB, and as other beers have too. My advice - if you can buy any of the old ones with the black label, get them while they're still good (they keep for a long time in the fridge) but really avoid the red label, newer ones (practically everywhere now). They are very soapy. This review is in fact for the on-tap kind - I had one on tap at the NSW Leagues club near Hyde Park Barracks a few weeks ago, and since a nice cold Old is what I really felt like, I was so disappointed when I got the nasty-smelling and -tasting crap that they have produced for some months now. I will never have another Old until they change the recipe, or unless I'm really stinging for one and I'm out in the bush somewhere where someone has bought a case and there's nothing else to drink for miles. Other than that, NEVER. I'm disappointed - it used to be my favourite session beer (and indeed one of the only regularly available session porters in NSW). Too bad.","Weizenmensch","Beers"

Its more of a black ale, similar to a belgian black ale or a german schwarzbier. Mouthfeel is a tad thin, but nothing bad. Flavor is rich and inviting, with a nice hop bite after the chocolate.

4,21.6,4,4,4,4,4,"as with monteiths black, its a dark beer you can have a session on. and for a brewer that is known for brewing particularly dismal beers (even compared to carlton) its a real standout. at least tooheys have shown with this beer, and by subsidising the james squire brewery, that they have some slight interest in brewing a quality beer. they get points for that alone. but hey, this is one of the beer hunters favorite aussie beers. its hard to argue with that assessment. i certainly dont.","diablo14","Dec 13, 2002"
