3.9,18.5,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,4,"Overall: this is definitely one of my favourite 'every day' dark beers, along with Carlton Black. They are both an Australian take on the traditional English styles - similar characteristics, but with a lighter body and higher carbonation to make them easier to drink in a session, and more refreshing in the Australian heat. I really would consider them more an excellent version of a dark lager than an English Dark Mild. Decent price too at AU$45 a case of 24 x 375mL. One of my favourite pub beers is a Tooheys Old / Tooheys New black-and-tan. I will say I do prefer Old on tap rather than in the bottle, but good nonetheless.","SmashPants","Sep 21, 2014"

There's enough flavour to make a go of it, if moderation and sessionability are your goals for the night, but for a singular experience, this just doesn't have the legs.","biboergosum","May 21, 2013"
