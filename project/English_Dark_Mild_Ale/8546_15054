3.35,1.2,4.5,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Drinkable but rather average. It looks superb with a towering head, however it's all downhill from there. The aroma and flavour are dull and lacklustre, with weak malt character and little else going on. Body is OK but not amazing. If a mild is judged by it's maltiness then this one is below par. Goes down easily enough but nothing special - no need to seek it out.","jazzyjeff13","Feb 16, 2013"

2.48,-25.1,3,2.5,2,4,2.5,"O. A Dark beer that is probably for people who are looking to get into this type of stout/dark beer style, defiantly not for the connoisseur. Very underwhelming","FinalFantasyBrewing","Jun 26, 2009"
3.7,11.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Thin and light even by mild standards. It does hold a few surprises, though, especially the dose of roast, which snuffs any fruit. Not sure I get the Fuggles-EKG combo at full strength. On the whole, I'd prefer Very Nutty.","StJamesGate","Apr 12, 2009"

3.85,16.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Nice dark ruby (edging into black) body with a thin but dense tan head. The scent is of mellow roasted malts, pleasant fruity hops, and light sugar. Sweet, brown sugar-y malts in the taste. Low hops in the taste, and a creamy, light chocolate taste. Smooth, but light body. Low, but still noticeable carbonation. Pleasant taste, and a low ABV makes this a nice session beer.","BDTyre","Jun 10, 2007"
3.2,-3.3,3,3,3,3,4,"Pours deep brown with tan smooth head, weak smell of roasted malt, taste is like a kvass, watery and unexpressive, tones of roasted malt and tints of chocolate, almost no mouthfeel, very light & drinkable. My first mild and I'm in doubt of this.","Dentist666",
