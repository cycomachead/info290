3.2,-16.9,3,3,3.5,3,3,"O- Well past it's prime imo. That's my fault, not the brewery. It's been sitting in the fridge far too long.","korguy123","May 31, 2011"
3.78,-1.8,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Deep brown, near black, light ring of off white head, good retention. Smell is malty and nutty, lightly roasted, fruity and lightly lactic. taste is roasty, light butter notes that are quite pleasant and work well, nutty, molasses, fig and some darker fruits, lightly smokey with a bitter finish and aftertaste. Light to med carbonation, light to medium feel, medium body. Quite nice sessionable and enjoyable, another solid effort from Grand River.","peensteen","May 02, 2011"
3.83,-0.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Taste - light roasted malt flavour, some nuttyness, plum. Finishes moderately bitter and dry.","","Apr 30, 2011"
3.95,2.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a dark brown with some dark red and mahogany highlights. A few fingers of tan head are formed, that's slightly creamy and moderately thick. Some lacing and moderate retention. Nose has light chocolate notes, some roast qualities, nuts, hints of caramel and dark fruits. Taste has roasty and mild coffee qualities, nuts are still mildly present themselves as well. Touch of caramel as well. Mouthfeel is a light medium, slightly watery in texture. Carbonation is medium low, and gets there only with some swirling down. Very easy to drink, I can only imagine this being more fantastic with cask treatment.","liamt07","Jan 14, 2011"
3.65,-5.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"O: A very nice, low ABV, session beer. Much more flavor than anything I have had lower than 4% so far.","mdaschaf","Nov 08, 2010"

3.63,-5.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The beer pours a dark amber color with a tan head. The aroma is very malty with a lot of toffee and some caramel mixed in. The flavor is similar. I get a ton of toffee, caramel, cocoa and some nuttyness. For such a low alcohol beer, there is a lot of flavor. Thin to medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice.","Mora2000","Jul 27, 2010"

4.1,6.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"D: For 3.5% ABV, this is an amazing accomplishment. Real flavour and truly "sessionable".","mrnobody",
