5,28.9,5,5,5,5,5,"This mild greets you with a deep rich color that lets you know exactly what you are getting in for. Dry flavor with hearty caramel and toffee overtones. The perfect complement to a salty or smoky dish. Great example of a little explored style.","Czequershuus","Nov 06, 2014"
3.61,-7,3.75,3.25,3.75,4,3.5,"Replicates a true British session ale style. Pure malt based brown/caramel hued ale. Some english toffee notes, with minimally noticed aroma. Medium-light mouthfeel, absolutely a beer to take down midweek.","Barnoloid","Oct 07, 2014"
