The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a thickly fluid feel. Overall, a nice little mild.

The flavor really nails it: it really toes the line between roasty and flavorful and being sessionable and refreshing - just how a dark mild should taste.

The aroma is of milk chocolate, and burnt malt. The taste is a nice balance of chocolate, burnt malt, and roasted malt with a dry finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a smooth texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a nice example of the mild style.

Not sure why I thought this was going to have a lighter look to it. The aroma is more pungent than I would have expected with a light roast coffee and chocolate nose. Medium/Light mouthfeel.

I stop in at Stub and Herb's, specifically for this beer, and was told before it was even poured that Mild is now being brewed with coffee. I hadn't heard this, but took the bartender's word for it. Pours a dark amber color, nearly brown in the middle, with a small off-white head. Aroma is, well, mild with a touch of coffee, some toffee, and caramel sweetness. Taste follows suit. I was surprised with the coffee flavor in the background. Light caramel, some breadiness, and no bitterness. Medium mouthfeel, light carbonation. Again, I was really surprised by the coffee presence in this beer. It was almost like a watered down coffee bender without any of the dark/roasted maltiness in there.

3.53,-9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Mouthfeel is quite light and highly carbonated; fitting for the style, but not my personal preference. Drinkability is excellent, this is a true session beer in the original English sense of the word.","kajerm","Jan 23, 2008"
4,3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a clear mahogany brown with a nice little off-white head, stays foamy with some decent lacing. After warming a bit, the aroma comes out more, malts are prominent in caramel, bready and biscuity tones, some faint herbal hop hints, still fairly faint, but nice. The taste is a little more broad, but still fairly modest, biscuit and caramel malts, Earl Gray tea, a sense of hops but nothing finite, just flirting impressions. The mouth is very smooth, a very subtle carbonation, a slightly dry finish, a session beer if there ever was one. I downed two of these in rather short time (encouraged by the release of Two), and could imagine doing so often. Also, I would love, LOVE, to see this on cask. That would truly be fantastic. As it stands, i fine brew, out of the blue, for the Surly crew.","objectivemonkey","Jan 21, 2008"
3.95,1.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Tasted this new beer from Surly at the release party at the Happy Gnome. Amber/Red in color with a little foam and touch of lacing. Very light on the tongue. Nice gentle balance of malt and hops with neither taking presidence. Not too carbonated. Great flavor and, as a session, perfect for enjoying more then two.","Maerzen","Beers"
3.8,-2.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall, this is a little over carbonated. Not much aroma but a good beer. Very drinkable, but let it rest it gets better with time in the glass.","mnstorm99","0"
3.63,-6.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Went over to the Gnome to try Surly's latest. I've never had a mild before (since FFF's Pride and Joy isn't really a mild), so this was a new experience. It was pretty good, and I definitely could have had several if I didn't have other things to do. I've heard milds are even better on cask, that would be interesting to have with this beer.","Mdog","Beers"
