4.03,5.8,4,4,4,3.75,4.25,"O: This beer is very easy to drink, is enjoyable, and as a result of the low ABV definitely a session beer. I really enjoy this style and there are just not too many options in it, especially made in the US - glad I found this one since I started doing full reviews (I previously "Had" it at a cask festival in late 2011).","dbrauneis","Jan 10, 2013"
