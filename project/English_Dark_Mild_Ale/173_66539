3.56,-9,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Dark brown with a dense, beige head with excellent retention and lacing. The nose is grainy, toasty, mildly smoky and has a touch of licorice. Not much hop character is present. Complex but not particularly compelling. The palate has the complexity of the nose, but the lightness and wateriness thanks to this being a second runnings beer is a little distracting. The English yeast adds some nice fruitiness and a little bit of a body, but not quite enough. Light in body, medium-high in carbonation, drying, smoky on the finish, this is solid stuff.","DefenCorps","Nov 25, 2011"
