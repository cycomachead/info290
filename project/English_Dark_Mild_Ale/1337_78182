3.54,-5.1,3.25,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a clear dark copper with a foamy tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, roasted malt, and caramel. Taste is much the same with a caramel flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is flavorful and mild.","UCLABrewN84","Mar 12, 2012"

3.74,0.3,4.5,3,4,3.5,4,"On tap at La Sirena in South Laguna Beach. Marked at 4.3% ABV. $6 for a 15 oz "pint" glass. They called it a Brown Ale, but clearly more in the English tradition.","mactrail","Feb 05, 2012"
