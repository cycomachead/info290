3.54,-5.1,3.25,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a clear dark copper with a foamy tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, roasted malt, and caramel. Taste is much the same with a caramel flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is flavorful and mild.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 13, 2012"

4,7.2,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a mahogany color with a small khaki colored head. Rather nutty with plenty of toffee and a mild cocoa note. Might even be a touch of coffee. Lots of toasted malts, too. Strong nut and toffee flavors. This beer is really driven by the sweet malt character. A little bit of toast and some mild cocoa. This one really surprised me.","womencantsail","Beers"
