4.15,9.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Sweet coffee notes yet dry and satisfying. A dark rich brew with hints of toffee and espresso. A good late night brew to cap things off or to enjoy with some good chocolate cake or truffles. Darker and richer than your usual English Bitters. IPA is BS. Save the Hops and Boycott IPA!","SlingerBKLYN","Jun 28, 2013"

3.82,0.8,4.25,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Taste: Low ABV, relatively low flavor and mouthfeel. That ashy flavor comes through pretty considerably in the flavor as well, but it's not overwhelming... nothing about this is. As mild as it may be, that's probably how it SHOULD be, given the style name and the ABV. The feel is pretty watery thin, but this is an excellent sessionable dark beer, without a doubt. I know this is classified as an English Dark Mild Ale, but this really tastes like a porter to me -- which is not at all a bad thing. I heard that this tasted like "black water", and I don't think that's too far off, even if it's under-explained. If I wanted to have a session at the brewery, this would likely be in the line-up. Not just that, but it's a reasonable price as well at $4.50 a pint. Try it out.","Alextricity","May 29, 2013"

3.93,3.7,4.5,4,3.75,4,4,"D - A nice lower ABV beer that is quite flavorful and easy to drink. Nice to see Kuhnhenn doing something that isn't in the double digit ABV range, although I'm assuming this is the second runnings of something like 4D or the barleywine base. I've had a pint of this before at HopCat, and I'd certainly have it again if it showed up wherever I was drinking.","MasterSki","Mar 10, 2012"
3.73,-1.6,4.25,3.75,3.75,3.25,3.75,"Very well balanced and certainly easy to drink. The flavor leaves a little something to be desired, however this is still a nice choice to throw back when you're looking to drink for longer periods of time.","tectactoe","Nov 22, 2011"
