3.76,-0.8,4,3.5,3.75,3.75,4,"Dark woody brown color, deep to the point of being nearly opaque, capped off with a small tan head that receded to a ringlet; minimal lacing. Light aroma, nutty, sweet bready malts, mild earthy hops. Taste was about spot-on for the style, slightly roasty malts, nutty, pumpernickel, grassy and earthy hoppiness, for a gentle, woody bitterness. Medium body, simple, quite drinkable, and very sessionable [to use a cliche expression for a lower ABV beer]. Perhaps not the most popular style of beer, but I do get in the mood for a good dark mild every once in a while, so this was nice.","Rifugium","Nov 30, 2012"
