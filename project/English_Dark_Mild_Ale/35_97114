2.84,-16.7,3,2.75,2.75,3,3,"Straight from the bottle at a friend’s party. Couldn’t assess appearance. Minimal insight into aroma. Toasted bread, caramel, late earthy flavor. Also, some fruit undertones. Active carbonation, medium-light body, creamy texture. I enjoyed this more than I expected to. Not overly interesting, but a fair sessionable brew.","SierraFlight","Feb 15, 2015"

Anyway, I thought the mild taste of ale would be something appealing to me but it wasn't as much as I thought. It wasn't bad, mind you, it just didn't tingle my toes.

Between the darker fruit up front and the lighter finish to this, there's just enough to hold anyone's attention in this beer.

It's perfect for someone who is into a lighter body beer, but wants a malt flavor. I'm not to into hoppy IPA's like everyone else, so I look for good solid beers without bitter qualities.","jmanero","Aug 18, 2013"

It comes as part of the twelve pack of October beers, and I don't think most people are going to be as eager to try this one. There are better session beers out there, and Sam Adams I know can do better.","DeFaz","Aug 17, 2013"

3.61,5.9,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Nice change of pace from Sam Adams with this Mild. Pours a gorgeous dark amber/red with off-white head - very enticing to look at this ale. Nose is on the lighter side with some toasty/biscuit notes and a caramel quality. On the palate I'm getting a nice malty to biscuit sweetness with some balancing hops, very easy drinking & thirst quenching, and very subdued alcohol for such a high % for a mild. Looking forward to cheese pairings with this one.","yemenmocha","Aug 14, 2013"
3.01,-11.7,3.5,3,3,2.75,3,"Gotta love it when you see an American brewery come out with a mild and it weighs in at over 5%... Regardless, this stuff pours a clear rusty bronze topped by a finger of short-lived off-white foam. The nose comprises sweet flowers, light walnut, and a twinge of lightly-toasted biscuit. The taste brings in more of the same, with a bit more biscuit (now buttery for your Southern pleasure) and a twang of vague sweetness for good measure. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a crisp-ish finish that epitomizes how the flavors completely fall off of a cliff near the end. Overall, this was a pretty disappointing brew. It's weak, it's overcarbed, it's slightly muddled, and it's in no way "mild". Let's just say: I'm not impressed.","TMoney2591","Aug 14, 2013"

Taste is slightly harsh, not real balanced leaving a salinic bitter in the end. Mouthfeel is medium light with good carbonation. Probably one I won't try again.","Bookseeb","Aug 11, 2013"
4.03,18.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"I am rating this highly, because it is a smoother, well balanced, very drinkable version of their red. I like their Irish red, and I would pay 25-50% per six more to have this available year round in place of that. Every facet is slightly better tasting and smoother than that already good beer.","TheFunGuy","Aug 11, 2013"

Looks like Sam adams is kick starting it this year with their fall mixer which was purchased July 24 in my neck of woods. First up is ruby mild. Never had a mild so can't judge off of style. Good solid beer. No head retention. Solid malt backbone with little to no hops. Reminds me of bells amber without the subtle hops. Maybe that us how the style is intended. Good overall beer.","Jekyll","Aug 02, 2013"
