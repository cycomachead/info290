2.84,-16.7,3,2.75,2.75,3,3,"Straight from the bottle at a friend’s party. Couldn’t assess appearance. Minimal insight into aroma. Toasted bread, caramel, late earthy flavor. Also, some fruit undertones. Active carbonation, medium-light body, creamy texture. I enjoyed this more than I expected to. Not overly interesting, but a fair sessionable brew.","SierraFlight","Dec 17, 2014"
