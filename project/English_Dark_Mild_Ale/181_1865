3.03,-21.7,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Bottle conditioned, a dusty 500 ml bottle at Plan B, Copenhagen, august 2005 - "best before" date was Oct. 2004! Tasted definitely a bit "off". Black colour, low head. Weak roasty aroma and flavour. Sourish and thin. Very disappointing, as my expectations were high. Will need to rerate a fresh bottle or cask.","Sigmund","Jun 06, 2006"
3.95,2.1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a very nice dark brown, approacking black with a tan head. Looks almost like a stout. Aromas of cocoa and some bright fruit, perhaps raspberry, a touch of treacle, and a round maltiness. Very nice taste. Fruitier than expected, with more hints of chocolate raspberry and quite a bit spritzier than expected as well. This settles a bit and the long fruity, chocolatey malt finish lingers. The slightest bitt chalky at the end. Quite full flavored and nice to see it in a low abv offering. Smooth and spritzy in the mouth Glad I picked this up.","Georgiabeer","May 17, 2006"
3.73,-3.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"A terrific example of what can be done at less than 5%. Chocolatey, smooth drinking. Active carbonation that tingle in the finish, and lots of lace. Dark brown with dark malt aroma.Some barrelled raspberries in the finish. This would be a staple if sold locally.","Sammy","Mar 06, 2006"
4.27,10.3,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"What a terrific beer. For those of you who think you know what a good Mild tastes like, you may want to bring your taste buds with you to this session. They've packed a ton of flavor into a this lower bodied brew. Initial aroma impresses with an abundance of juicy raisons, dates, molassas malts, and toastiness. Flavors continue what the aromas started, still emphasizing the raisons, figs, and plumbs. All backed up with a rich bready, yeasty flavors that emphasizes freshness. The body remains light, allowing the beer to flow easily down the gullet. Cleans up nicely in the finish with a hint of lingering plumbs and figs. Good Dark Milds are difficult to find, great ones, such as this, are greatly impossible.","BEERchitect","Feb 10, 2006"
3.6,-7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Explodes out of bottle and pours a five+ finger brown head that fades to a thin layer leaving some lace. Almost black color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Port nose. Starts with a dry fermented fruity flavor, some malty sweetness, finish is sour grapes. Pricey at $2.99 for a 11oz bottle from Lina's Beverages Painesville, OH.","jdhilt","Jan 15, 2006"
4.82,24.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"This made quite an impression on me. It poured much darker that I thought it was going to. In fact, it nearly poured black as ink, pouring a very dark brown. It had a caramel coloured foamy head that actually hung around for 3 minutes or so. Quite impressive indeed. The smell of this ale is absolutely amazing. Very sweet and chocolatey with a good bit of coffee and roasted malt. Perhaps some fruit and berries, as well. The taste was equally incredible. Loads of sweet malt present and nearly devoid of hops, although they are, of course, present in small quantities. I am simply blown away by this ale. It is entirely different from what I was expecting. The mouthfeel is smooth and easy to drink with a pleasant level of carbonation. I will definately buy this again in the future.","SilentSabre","Jul 26, 2005"
3.85,-0.5,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"D - high, a sweet easy down, only the alcohol flavor knocks it down a little","sinstaineddemon","Mar 11, 2005"
3,-22.5,3,3,3,3,3,"Aroma is full of blueberries and dark fruits. Black in color with a bunch of tan streaks and bubbles pretending to be a head. Fore is dry black licorice, raisins and some prune notes. A bit of bitterness in the finish, but it is a fruity bitterness more citric than hoppy. Increibly still beer with virtually no carbonation.","Jredner","Mar 08, 2005"
3.9,0.8,4,4,4,3,4,"Drinkability: Not at all what I was expecting in a Mild, particularly in the mouthfeel area, I nevertheless really enjoyed this complex and unusual beer","brentk56","Dec 14, 2004"
3.7,-4.4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"M&D: the mouthfeel is soft but constantly fed by lovely creamy bubbles. The body is pretty light, true to the standards of a mild, and the flavour is also mild, to my surprise actually. Overall this bottle-conditioned version is not a bad attempt at all, but I fear the more colourful fruitiness and richer maltiness as in the cask version are not packed in the bottle. The end result is a softer and cleaner mild, though. Still quite drinkable.","wl0307","Oct 17, 2004"
2.98,-23,4,3.5,2.5,3,3,"16.9 ounce bottle. No freshness dating.","GCBrewingCo","Oct 13, 2004"
3.68,-4.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This one pours a very dark color with a tall head that has nice retention and leaves lots of lacing on the glass. As kmpitz2 said, the aroma is just like fresh raisins. Weird. The flavor is mostly comprised of that fresh raisin thing. Tasty, in a weird way. I wouldn't really call this a mild, but it's still good. Body is moderate and the drinkability is ok.","clvand0","Jul 21, 2004"
3.98,2.8,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"This beer pours a black (I think it is a super dark amber) color with a 4 finger head that falls rather slowly. The nose is interesting. Its almost like ground up raisins, right out of the little red box. The flavor is nice, with quite a bit of raisin flavor along with a kind of pulpy fruityness on the end. Interesting. The feel is a light moderate, with a moderate carbonation. I like it. Overall, this is very refreshing and fruity. I'm not sure if it fits the style, as I have had very few of them, I do like it.","kmpitz2","Jan 22, 2004"
4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability  Theres no modesty here. This is a big un to say the least. They ought to add a new style from Mild Ale to Wild Ale.","RoyalT","Nov 29, 2003"
3.77,-2.6,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Gale's Festival Mild is a better than average English dark mild that has flavor to spare. Its whole isn't quite equal to the sum of its parts however; it could stand to be more tightly knit on the palate. I did enjoy this little 11 oz. bottle though and will probably buy it again if I see it on the shelves. I'm betting that it's much better on-cask.","BuckeyeNation","Sep 29, 2003"
1.53,-60.5,4,1,1.5,1.5,1.5,"I paid 4.50 for a 500 ml bottle. What a burn!","gentlebubbles","Sep 15, 2003"
4.11,6.2,4,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I think that this is a splendid ale of a (at least outside the UK) unusual style.. It is quite expensive (approx US$4 for 50 cl), but well worth the money.","bark","Aug 31, 2003"
2.68,-30.7,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Taste: hops bite first, then back away, malt is prevalent, carbonation high fizz aplenty. Too aplenty. It's like a soda pop up in here. Tart, too. Nothing but fizz and sour, not terribly pleasant. I'm going to sit with this for a bit, to find something to enjoy in it...ain't happening...eh! ...not liking it! Spent $5.49 before taxes for a 500ml bottle of mild ale that's not the tiniest bit mild...not worth it...a bit of a vinous character peeps up toward the end, but it's too late...this was a waste..nothing to get "festive" about, or anything, for I did nothing but wince and grimace. Ugh. Skip. Skip Gales altogether, if you're wise. Wiser than I. Let my sacrifice not be in vain.","feloniousmonk","May 12, 2003"
4.1,5.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Deep mahogany with very little carbonation. Never really forms a true head but the dark color is quite attractive in this mild ale. Nose features notes of chocolate, toffee, coffee and hops. The complex flavor profile exhibits mild chocolate malt, raisins, toffee, roasted coffee beans, and some balancing, relatively citric, bitter hops on the finish. Somewhat vinous and very well rounded. Smooth, almost non-carbonated mouthfeel, just like what one might find in a cask-conditioned pint of mild. Super drinkable -- low abv, huge flavor -- a pleasure to drink.","Jon","May 12, 2003"
4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"With the designation "mild ale" I expected something very low key and conservative. This beer surprised me at the first sip - a citric tartness followed by a bright caramel/toffee malt. Some apple flavors drifting about. Sharply carbonated. Finished a little dry and clean. Quite the lively beer with a lot of personality. Love to try this with some beef stew.","Brent",
