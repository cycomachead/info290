4.1,22.4,4,4.5,4,3.75,4,"Poured out of can into an English pub glass. I got a nice, thick, two-finger head. The color was a nice dark red. The smell was sweet, malty, and slight pumpkin spice. Overall this was a nice beer. I loved the malty taste with the sweet finish. Tastes like a more flavorful version of Guinness draught (though it's not a nitro beer).","Bigalduncan64","Feb 13, 2015"

3.75,11.9,4,2.75,4,4.5,4,"Has malt bready spice aroma. Dark almost black and ruby colored body. Has a thick two fingered foamy head that lingers for a while. Much like the Guinness Draught in taste but has a maltier presence and thinner feel. Mild spiciness. Leaves a smooth creamy feeling.","rjplumer","Feb 09, 2015"
