3.42,1.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Final Grade: 3.42, a B-. Ghettoblaster is a passable English-style dark ale, but I'll add an asterisk to that because I have a feeling this bottle is getting a little old. This is the sort of beer that both craft beer fans and those who have never tried anything fancier than Guinness Draught should be able to enjoy, or at least tolerate. I will need to try this on tap some time to see if that adjusts my perspective at all, but for now I'd say this one is worth a look.","thehyperduck","Oct 05, 2014"
