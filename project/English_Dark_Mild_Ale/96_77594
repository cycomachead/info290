The taste upfront has nice maltness then on the back of the tonuge after it has warmed up a little bit then comes some chocolate and roasted malt flavors with a nice hop presence but not over powering. The mouthfeel is good and overall a pretty good beer.","chefhatt","Oct 06, 2012"
3.45,2.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured dark brown, two shades shy of being black. Little foam, very fizzy, settles out. Funky nutty smell. Taste is sweet, nutty, and cola flavored. Earthy? (from notes, but in hindsight not really). A little like flat soda. Or a funkier nut brown. Mild understates it. Hard to fully describe.","KTCamm","Sep 29, 2012"

If I didn't have any previous knowledge that this was a beer, I'd think I was drinking flat fountain Dr. pepper mixed with cola, A & W root beer, and Sprite. This is really just a watery mess. I picked the right beer to have before leaving for work. I was worried about finishing one in time, but I've drank 3/4 of it in the time it took to write this short review. Insanely drinkable, but that's not a good thing in this case. Sorry Magic Hat, but you continue to underwhelm my taste buds. At least I can finish it and it's not a drain pour.","Jesse13713","Jul 06, 2012"

3.78,11.8,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Magic Hat +/- is a clear, very lively copper beer with a thick, elastic, off white foam. There's a little sweet, dark malt in the nose with a touch of herbal, medicinal hops. It has a smooth, medium body. The finish is a little gritty. There's not a ton of flavor up front. Upon the finish, a resiny, botanical bitterness rolls in with the sweetness of cake or bread. It lingers for a while. This is kind of like a lightened-up brown ale. It's mild enough to be inoffensive and it's pretty unique.","yesyouam","May 25, 2012"

On the nose is a subtle profile of sweet malts and light hops and a little nutty. The body is in the medium range but smooth. The taste is sweet up front and then mildly bitter. It is a drinkable session beer.","puboflyons","Apr 06, 2012"

3.94,16.6,3,4,4,4,4,"Hey, this'll be my first Dark Mild review. I've partaken in several pints of Cigar City's El Lector, but never in an environment conductive to reviewing. It pours out a deep red with some brown tinges to it. A centimeter of head steadily crowns the brew. The aroma is primarily nutty, with chocolate, roastiness, and just a touch of hops. The taste is good, it's got a nice complexity to it, with the nuttiness, roastiness, chocolate, and a touch of dark fruits all intertwining. The finish is earthy and hoppy before leaving a nice clean, dry feeling on the palate. The drinkability is, as to be expected, very good. Overall, it's a good Mild. I'd really like to find a honest Dark Mild from England to compare this to.","shand","Apr 02, 2012"

2.92,-13.6,2.5,3,3,2.5,3,"Pours a dark chestnut color under a slim, frothy ring of a head that dissolves to nothing. Nutty malt, cereal grain, and some dark - slightly tart - fruitiness. A little too clean, which seems to be an issue with Magic Hat beers over the last several years. Dark, dry malt and cocoa flavor, but somewhat watery. Faint toast and fruit, finishing dry. Medium-light body with too much carbonation at first. Too sterile and bland to be all that enjoyable. Not terrible, just not good.","wedge","Apr 01, 2012"

Smells sweet and maybe even a touch sour. Nut, chocolate, and roast dominate the flavor. Light to medium in body with ample carbonation. While the aroma is a bit off-putting, the flavor is great. Spot-on for the style, and that's not easy to come by.","MrHurmateeowish","Mar 30, 2012"
3.5,3.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O: A dumbed-down version of a classic style. Can't say that too many times about American brewers when they brew classic English styles, but it certainly applies here. Still worth a try, though","BEERMILER12","Mar 30, 2012"

3.41,0.9,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a pale dark copper color with a light beige head forming thick and dwindling slow, visually I'm all about this beer the smell leaves a bit to be desired with light dark roasts. That's about it light fruity accents generic tart cherry with cereal toasted grains. Flavor is light but has a creamy, dark roasted malts with fruit notes. Pretty mild ale, that shows me one thing Magic Hat has been going toward the mainstream. This beer tastes like a pseudo craft from a mislabeled ABI brew. Mouthfeel is light moderate carbonation slightly soft textures going on, easy to drink. A no brainer ale with enough flavor to help you get through it however it doesn't really push the envelope or do anything for beer.","WVbeergeek","Feb 14, 2012"
