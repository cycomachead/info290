This made me realize that there was something other than amber ales or Guiness if I wanted a beer with flavour. I still always have a can or two in my fridge.","kwjd","Jan 29, 2010"
4.17,15.8,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Served from an attractive 473ml Tallboy, with a freshness date stamped on it. Poured into a trusty Guinness tulip pint glass stolen from the Winters in Newtownards, NI. Moderate head which dissapates into a ring of bubbles pretty quickly. Dark mahogeny brown with a hint of red, and a good carbonation. The aroma is heavily grainy, with a little hit of yeast; it reminds me of a baker's shop. Maybe a touch of an earthy hop, but the malt is forefront in the aroma. The taste is full and grainy, barley and maybe even a bit of rye? Some dark malts to be sure. Bready and wonderful, not too sweet, still like being in a baker's shop. The hop is still a bit earthy, but acts much more as a balance to the malts, and to provide a nice clean dry finish. Mouthfeel is smooth with a nice carbonation, but it's not over the top. I could drink this beer all night (or day, which is a more fitting description of the current time). I had forgotten just how much I like this beer.","bendale","Jan 27, 2010"

Loads of sweet malt on the nose, roasted, chocolate, a little lactose, caramel, slight diacetyl, stewed prunes, and a little herbal licorice. Malt forward a little floral nobel hop presences. Balanced for what it should be. The flavour is of a vanilla spiked chocolate, some caramel sugars, a little astringent in it's mildly dry finish. Currents and prunes, with licorice, roast, malt sweetness and herbs. Very rich coffee spiked with honey and rich cream. A little bready from the yeast. The mouthfeel is full, grainy, creamy, full and indeed rich. The carbonation is moderate- medium, and just beautifully attenuated. Subtle dryness with a touch of residual sugars.

I smelled a lot of burnt toast here, almost smoky. The taste seemed a bit uneven with a sweet molasses backdrop that didn't seem to blend well with burnt malt and mild bitterness. Mouthfeel was dry, adding to what seemed to me to be a lack of balance. The more I tasted it, the more I got a sense that there were layers of grainy malt here, most of it toasty, some of it burnt ... but all of it a bit out of synch.

This is ruined somewhat by the finish, which shows a harsh alcohol taste despite the standard abv. Fortunately, this became muted as the drink warmed up.

There is a bit of a coffee like finish to it although its derived from the malt as the ingredients would tell you no such ingredient exists.

Tapped a dark red-brown smallish off white head reduces to a full lace. Not much in the nose departement....very subtle..light wiffs of caramel, grains light fuggles hopping. Had a medium body with nice chewy sweet malt texture fairly rich right to the finish where the citrus from the hops are evident...a very nice well balanced draft brown ale","pootz","Jun 16, 2004"
3.18,-11.7,3.5,3,3.5,2.5,3,"Good name. Poured an very clear and flat looking amber. The nose was mild and subtle for the most part, light malts. The taste was somewhat interesting but yet bland. Only small hints of roasted malt. Some lighty woody notes and a definite fruitiness of dark plum and semi sweet pears. Overall the body was extremely light if not watery. Flavours fade quickly and leave for a below average experience.","Popsinc","Beers"
3.15,-12.5,3,3,3.5,2.5,3,"This beer has a great name and excellent marketing -- the tap handle looks like an oil can. With an obvious oil theme, I was expecting something with a lot more body and flavour, and was somewhat disappointed. The beer is a deep reddish brown and had a thin cream head. The aroma was quite mild, with delicate floral hops and a faint nuttiness. Nuttiness carried through into the flavour and was replaced by strong bitterness at the finish. It was surprisingly light bodied, with nothing lingering on the palate.","DrJay","0"
