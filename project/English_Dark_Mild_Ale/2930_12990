3.89,7.5,4,3.75,3.75,3.5,4.5,"American Craft Brewers embrace this style as you have porter. This could be a great gateway into cask ale for Americans Brewers. It also could be a great american craft keg beer. Some experimentation is required. On another note, let's hope the Cain's Brewery of Liverpool survives and grows.","rtrasr","Jun 10, 2013"
3.4,-6.1,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.5,"An awful lot of cases of canned dark mild, straight from Merry Ol'. Right on. This stuff pours a clear russet topped by a finger of off-cream foam. The nose comprises mild walnuts, light rye bread, toffee, and a hint of tea. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a slight bit of blunt fruit in the background, possibly the byproduct of some tea or coffee acridness. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a nice little mild, if nothing all that outstanding for the style. I could see drinking plenty of this, though the price may have me questioning that plan.","TMoney2591","Jun 08, 2013"
2.96,-18.2,3.75,3.25,2.75,3,2.75,"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, very mild kick, decent representation of style, there are definitely better beers in the style that I would choose before this one.","TheManiacalOne","May 29, 2013"
3.75,3.6,4,4,3.75,3.5,3.5,"Overall not bad, it is a decent drinking beer, but more like a light milk stout or creamy brown than a mild, at least what I've seen, but I'm not very familiar with the history of British milds. It really seems to have nitro carbonation which is a bit of a turn off for me for most beers, esp something like a mild where it seems to overpower many of the other flavors. still a pretty decent beer.","jlindros","May 23, 2013"

2.93,-19.1,3,2.5,3,3.5,3,"Beer is medium-light to light in body, with carbonation levels of medium intensity. The resulting mouthfeel is slightly fizzy at first, quickly setting to a smooth, softly flowing and slightly foamy sensation. Closes semi-dry, with small amounts of lingering stickiness on the palate.","falloutsnow","Mar 23, 2013"
