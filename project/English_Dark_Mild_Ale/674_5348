However, things might get dull if one actually tried a full session and the sweetness would probably get overbearing. Seems bulkier than your average mild.","CalgaryFMC","May 22, 2014"

I've tried several 6-packs of bottles over the last year but, overall, I don't particularly care for it. It seems to leave me with an oily feeling after I finish a bottle. It isn't a bad beer, but there is better out there.","maclean25",
