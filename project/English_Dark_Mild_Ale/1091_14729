There is not much scent to this beer....subtle hints of sweet malt...that is about it. The taste is a very even balanced beer....the malt provides a sweet back drop and there is enough bittering hops to balance the sweetness to make it very pleasant. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall this is a decent beer.","WoodBrew","Jul 09, 2013"

A delightful change to your regular beer or a viable option if you are looking for a new daily drinker. Don't be surprised if you are throwing POWs after just a couple. Definitely a thumbs up.","rustycrayfish","Jul 08, 2013"
