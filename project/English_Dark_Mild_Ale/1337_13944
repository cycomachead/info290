3.85,2.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a slightly murky copper with a khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small chunks of lace form randomly around the glass on the drink down. Smell is very malty and nutty. Taste is of roasty malt and toasted nuts. There is a nice roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good low ABV beer with some nice roasty and nutty aromas and flavors.","UCLABrewN84","Nov 16, 2011"

3.73,-0.8,3.5,3,4,4,4,"Quaffable, light-weight thirst quencher. Pleasant watery mouthfeel. Dark brown in the pint glass at Pizza Port in Ocean Beach. Roasted malt comes through the modest flavors. Touch of crispness but only a kiss of hops. Wee touch of burnt malt. Well carbonated-- wouldn't be mistaken for an English dark mild, but that's the general idea. One of the better American mild style browns.","mactrail",
