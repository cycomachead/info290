3.95,11.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"It's red, and maybe London (England) influenced, but my, there is something else going here as well - hopped up just south of the proverbial nuts, yet in the Continental way - earthy, floral, but still bitter. Whatever, this a hell of a session bitter, and I'd love to be able to prove it right now.","biboergosum","Aug 29, 2009"

3.99,13,3,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Color is amber, very dark (some reddish notes) and clear. Practically no head. The aroma is caramel malts, not much hops. Maybe some fruits in the aroma, cherry? not sure... The aroma intensity is medium but for a light beer, it is intense. Taste shows caramel with a very subtly bitterness. Very tasty for a light beer. Thirst quenching too. Thin-bodied.","ZorPrime","May 13, 2009"
