4.19,13.9,3.75,4,4.25,5,4,"O:  relatively tame overall with everything in its place, Brawler might be the ultimate session beer ... it's full of good grain and malt flavor without getting too sweet, and it's crisp and so very easy to drink.  the malt presence does, in fact, have a good English ale feel.  several American-made amber ales come close to hitting these notes, but they don't hit as well as this one -- we need more beers like this!  4.2% ABV, loads of flavor, beautiful clarity, crisp and clean ... a brew Philadelphia and PA is lucky to have.","Premo88","Feb 06, 2015"
