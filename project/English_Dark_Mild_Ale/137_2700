2.99,-16.2,3.25,3,3,2.75,3,"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a light, clear, brown coloring with only a thin, filmy, clingy white surface coating. Aromas of very sweet nut and toffee, with a slight roasting. Flavors are a bit watery, with a roasty, nutty sweet backbone and a touch of chocolate on the tail end. Sweet, light aftertaste with a slightly cloying finish.","GarthDanielson","Jun 05, 2012"
