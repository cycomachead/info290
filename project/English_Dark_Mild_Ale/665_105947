3.57,8.2,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Overall: I expected this to be identical to the Generous Ale that came in the same Guinness Christmas pack. Thankfully it wasn't; more flavor and generally sturdier overall. I might not rush back to it, but it's a nice offering.","illpass78","Jan 02, 2015"

2.53,-23.3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Its ok, tastes like an off the shelf at the grocery store kinda beer, bud-wiser or some other college frat party yellow piss beer. large hit of nearly flavorless but stinging carbonation and hopes in the beginning mild hint of beer taste in the middle and slightly a mild random grocery store beer taste at the end.","wedge6128","Dec 31, 2014"

3.25,-1.5,4,2.75,3.25,3.5,3.5,"Dark brown in color.  The beer has a nice head and a clarity when held to the light.  The smell is faint...distant malt.  The taste is mostly malt, with an underlying sweetness.  Slim body...thinner than it could be.  This is an average, uninteresting brew.","Suds","Dec 22, 2014"

3.57,8.2,3.75,3,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall - Not the worst thing I have ever tasted this beer is actually well balanced and has some pretty good hop character and a nice enough mouth feel it is even one of the better and more balanced beers to be produced by Smithwick's","BeerDrinkersWorldTour",
