4,-3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a dark brown color, decent cap of foam. Aroma of nutty malts, caramel, and light floral hops. In the flavor, alittle roasted malt, caramel, nutty maltyness. Somewhat bready, balanced, light coffee, very clean finish. Lighter bodied, super smooth, and quite easy to drink. Milds are underrated, and this one I could easily make a staple session beer. Mild in every sense of the word, but not a bad thing.","Stinkypuss","Mar 06, 2011"
4.18,1.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"How wonderful this beer that flows out from the brewery this one time and into my glass. Dark amber the hue, the carbonation rises slowly and naturally from the depths of the glass to form a head that Guiness would be jealous of. A little sweet and bready aroma with some very light chocolate. A light hop bitterness and slight ping of citrus accompany the delicate chocolate and sweet malt. Dark but light. Light but not thin. Nice body, really easy drinking, very tasty. A brilliant piece of work..","dragonWhale","Feb 19, 2011"
4.23,2.4,4.5,4,4,5,4.5,"O - This has awesome drinkability. It just so creamy and goes down so easily. This is an awesome session beer, no doubt. I think this is an awesome anytime beer, especially since the low ABV. I wish I could get this regularly.","JizackFH","Jan 19, 2011"
4.39,6.3,5,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,"I have drank many English style beers recently, bitters and ESBs and the like, and found I didn't like them nearly as much as I used to. I thought that my tastes had changed, as I was more into imperial stouts, but this beer shows that my tastes merely demanded more flavor, which this beer delivers.","timobkg","Nov 01, 2004"
3.98,-3.6,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Clear dark brown with reddish highlights, there's a dense light brown head that caps the beer. Retention and lacing are excellent. The nose is great, brown sugar, toffee, a little nutty with some green fuggles hops. A little coffee is also present. Some toasted wheat bread is also present. The palate opens light but with a nice body. Brown sugar, toffee and a nice nutty flavor, along with a mild bitterness, earthy and a little leafy. A little molasses, even? In some ways, this is a cross between a more traditional dark mild and an English brown ale. Drying on the finish with a toasty, mildly fruity yeast character, this is expertly conditioned and a joy to drink","DefenCorps","Oct 25, 2004"
3.68,-10.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Had this on cask at Victory. A ruby colored beer with a nice foam head that clings to the glass. I get mostly a light roasty-like taste and smell. Some toasty notes. Hops aren't evident to me in aroma or taste but their bittering influence is definitely there to balance any sweetness from the malts. Was expecting a little more malt character. Nice mouthfeel as it's creamy in texture and light drinking. Easily, a very decent session beer.","jwhancher","Aug 05, 2004"
3.9,-5.6,4,4,3.5,4,4.5,"Had a pint at the Grey Lodge Pub. It has a rich cocoa and hazelnut though the flavor is considerably, uh, milder. It's slightly acidic with a hint of oxidation (expected in a cask beer) with gentle roast and nutty flavor. Very drinkable and light bodied. If there weren't other beers here I wanted to try, I'd have had more.","tempest","Jul 08, 2004"
3.93,-4.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Well I for one am glad that they took this one out of retirement. It's a little more hop forward than I would have expected for an English Mild but I didn't mind one bit, as the extra crispness helped counteract the thinness of the cask feel. Really tasty and HUGELY drinkable stuff! I'd love to see this become a fixture on the hand pumps here.","Kegatron","May 07, 2003"
4,-3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"On-Cask at the brewpub. This is a dark amber/near brown brew with a small cask-like head of foam that dies rather quickly and leaves a minute amount of lacing. The aromas are all spicy/citrusy hops and light biscuity malts. This brew taste very authentic. Citrus hops up front with bready malts in the middle and a clean hoppy finish. The mouthfeel is thin, but perfect for the style and the drinkability is very good as well. This is a very authentic Dark Mild and Victory has done a very good job with it. Wow, Dark Milds are rare in the UK, what a treat to have one on cask in PA!","francisweizen","May 01, 2003"
3.89,-5.8,4.5,3,4,4,4.5,"The mouthfeel was smooth at the start with a mildly crisp finish. Some malt lingers on the tongue after swallowing. This is a decent session brew, as the flavors are mellow and it is perfect for an afternoon of quaffing beers without overloading your tastebuds.","Gavage","Apr 26, 2003"
4.06,-1.7,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,5,"First sip reveals a thin yet not watery brew, very light carbonation as cask ale should. Light caramel start to the flavor which rolls to a bitter pine hop presence that lingers for a few seconds and then gradually fades. Very Very easy to drink., Excellent session beer!","sulldaddy","Apr 25, 2003"
4.1,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4.5," Overall a really nice drinkable mild.","bmills1608","Apr 06, 2003"
3.58,-13.3,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Dark amber color served with a perpetual off-white head. Spicey, pine-laced hop aroma. Light, malty taste with a decent hop note. A bit of a soapy hop taste with an attractive bitter finish. Light mouthfeel and a good drinkability. A very good session beer, and a surprise from victory. After my other Victory experiences that are sort of "in your face" flavorful, this one can be better appreciated for the subtle nuances behind the hoppiness.","aaronh","Mar 04, 2003"
4.13,0,4,3.5,4,4.5,5,"Found this Victory session gem on cask at the Sharp Edge Creekhouse. Just let me say this is a very mild, but one very nicely brewed delicate brew. It appears a pale amber gold with a creamy textured tannish foam head with a healthy amount of trickled lace surrounding my glass. The aroma is a wonderful but tame floral hop character with underlying malt tones. Very nicely done and on the forefront of the flavor there is a slight creamy caramelly mix of light hops and sweet malt. Texture is very frothy and inviting one drinkable session beer from the Victory brewing company.","WVbeergeek","Feb 17, 2003"
4,-3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Beer comes out a nice brown color. Very little head on it, but it managed to stay around for awhile. The first thing that you notice when you pick up the glass is that the beer is"warm". Not really warm, but served at proper cellar temperature for this type of beer, not cold. Very full flavored and malty. An excellent version of an English Mild.","Boto",
