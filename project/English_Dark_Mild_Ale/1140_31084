3.33,-3.8,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"It's got a slight bitterness that I didn't expect from the smell. The peat reappears and there's a sense of tobacco. Not too bad, but could be more drinkable as it has a bit of a mineral mouthfeel to it that really dries it out...and I'm not just talking about the finish. In this style I want a little bit of sweetness in it. I am impressed that with the body. Many brewpubs make English browns too watery.","Naugros","Feb 18, 2010"
3.25,-6.1,4,4,3,2.5,3,"Overall this is wet with a decent aroma that doesn't deliver. Texture and taste is just completely lacking, even for a mild. Truly tastes like peasants beer.","smakawhat","Jan 07, 2010"
3.18,-8.1,4,3.5,3,3,3,"o - Overall a pretty average English mild ale. I thought it was overcarbonated and a bit bland in the taste. With many good beers out there by Oliver's, this isn't one to really seek out.","mdfb79","Jan 05, 2010"
2.93,-15.3,4.5,4,2.5,3,2,"I had this on-cask at ChurchKey in DC. It had a dark red/amber colour with large bubbles and a good head. The smell was sweet and sugary with a hint of caramel. It had a damp and musty flavour with a hint of honey. It was also very yeasty. The finish was like bitter hop water. I didn't really like it.","vandemonian","Oct 11, 2009"
2.99,-13.6,4,2.5,3,3.5,3,"The flavor is an improvement on the nose but is a bit boring and there's still a bit of butter in there. Some light roast and coffee plus a touch of toffee. The feel is quite light with low levels of carbonation, even considering the serving method. Unfortunately, not one of the better beers I've had from Pratt Street.","Thorpe429","Jun 07, 2007"
3.04,-12.1,3.5,2,3,3.5,4,"A dark amber color out of a cask and I expected something big here. I was disappointed. I didn't pick up much on the smell side besides a slight malty, chocolate. I identified some roasted malts on the first sip and drank this one pretty fast as the mouth feel was smooth and refreshing.","NNY2DC","Jun 12, 2006"
4.1,18.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Overall I'm always a bit happier when a good mild is on-tap somewhere and so needless to say I was happy at Pratt St. Worth a shot.","glid02",
