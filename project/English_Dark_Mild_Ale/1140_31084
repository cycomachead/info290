3.33,-3.8,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"It's got a slight bitterness that I didn't expect from the smell. The peat reappears and there's a sense of tobacco. Not too bad, but could be more drinkable as it has a bit of a mineral mouthfeel to it that really dries it out...and I'm not just talking about the finish. In this style I want a little bit of sweetness in it. I am impressed that with the body. Many brewpubs make English browns too watery.","Naugros","Apr 02, 2011"
3.25,-6.1,4,4,3,2.5,3,"Overall this is wet with a decent aroma that doesn't deliver. Texture and taste is just completely lacking, even for a mild. Truly tastes like peasants beer.","smakawhat","Jan 20, 2011"
3.18,-8.1,4,3.5,3,3,3,"o - Overall a pretty average English mild ale. I thought it was overcarbonated and a bit bland in the taste. With many good beers out there by Oliver's, this isn't one to really seek out.","mdfb79","Nov 18, 2010"
2.93,-15.3,4.5,4,2.5,3,2,"I had this on-cask at ChurchKey in DC. It had a dark red/amber colour with large bubbles and a good head. The smell was sweet and sugary with a hint of caramel. It had a damp and musty flavour with a hint of honey. It was also very yeasty. The finish was like bitter hop water. I didn't really like it.","vandemonian","Feb 18, 2010"
2.99,-13.6,4,2.5,3,3.5,3,"The flavor is an improvement on the nose but is a bit boring and there's still a bit of butter in there. Some light roast and coffee plus a touch of toffee. The feel is quite light with low levels of carbonation, even considering the serving method. Unfortunately, not one of the better beers I've had from Pratt Street.","Thorpe429","Jan 06, 2010"
3.04,-12.1,3.5,2,3,3.5,4,"A dark amber color out of a cask and I expected something big here. I was disappointed. I didn't pick up much on the smell side besides a slight malty, chocolate. I identified some roasted malts on the first sip and drank this one pretty fast as the mouth feel was smooth and refreshing.","NNY2DC","Jan 05, 2010"
4.1,18.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Overall I'm always a bit happier when a good mild is on-tap somewhere and so needless to say I was happy at Pratt St. Worth a shot.","glid02","Oct 11, 2009"
3.26,-5.8,4,3,3,3,4,"Low body bordering on medium. There is a slight roast character at the back of the palate but its kind of watery up front. I don't have a lot of experience with English mild ales but this is about what I expected. Drinkability is high, there really isn't anything to stand in your way, so to speak. Mouthfeel is OK. The watery feeling in the front is completely disconnected with the back, a unifying flavor or more carbonation could do this beer wonders. Maybe its better on draft than on cask. It was fine.","drabmuh","Jun 07, 2007"
4.1,18.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Pours a rich, dark brown with reddish highlights. Nice full off-white head with nice retention and lacing. Smell is of roasted malts, roastd nuts, faint coffee, chocolate and carmel notes. Exceptional flavor follows scent -roasted malts, roasted nuts, mild roasted coffee, carmel sweetness present. Medium bodied, appropriate carbonation. Another excellent real ale from Oliver. This mild is has bigger flavor and bigger body than any similar brew.","rfgetz","Jun 12, 2006"
