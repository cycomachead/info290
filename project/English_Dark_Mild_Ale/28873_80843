Not much aroma here...some slight sweet malt and bitter hop with a bit of roastedness. Taste is really nice. Almost coffee roasted malts and sweet malts nicely balanced with some hop bitterness. Really smooth and definitely a session brew. Nice job and a good representation of the style...especially for being this far from England and in the desert.","DrinkSlurm","Jun 16, 2012"
