3.25,-15.6,3,3,3.5,3.5,3,"O/D - Seems to much like mom added too much nutmeg to the cookies or something. I applaud the effort, but there would be no reason to drink more than half a bottle of this. Even that was a bit tough. Seemed like they did what they intended to, just wasn't up my alley.","tbeckett","Jun 08, 2013"

4.2,9.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Bold but still approachable, complex but easy to comprehend. A thinking beer as each sip peels back another layer. The use of Trappist ale yeast brings that much more to the palate. Nothing short of amazing here.","Jason","Sep 22, 2011"
3.3,-14.3,3.5,3.5,3,4.5,3,"Came to the table a deep dark brown, opaque with some flashes of some burgundy at the edges. Dusty and dirty mocha head, with little retention and no lace. Nose is an earthy mocha, dark chocolate, herbal and organic notes abound. Taste is somewhat similar, with a real earthy chocolate, herbal and even more 'organic' than the nose. Some cocoa, light wheat and banana notes, even some mild menthol? Light roast coffee in the periphery as well. Quite a decent mouthfeel, creamy and quite good cask feel to it. Somewhat interesting overall, but it lacks focus and feels all over the place. Interesting, but just OK.","liamt07","Feb 27, 2011"

3.95,2.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours nearly black, brown with amber highlights are exposed in the light, small off white soapy head with light lacing on the glass. Smell is medicinal with traces of chocolate, floral notes and something similar to fresh bread, herby with anise/licorice notes as well. Taste is slightly sweet, earthy and notes of tea are detected slightly creamy I think thats largely the effect of the cask. Pretty thin body that was slightly watery, but overall enjoyable. Very interesting brew, unique, ABV unnoticeable, could not make this an everyday brew but this is a solid one off for sure.","peensteen","Feb 08, 2011"
3.88,0.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Very unique, and a great experiment. Not an every day drinker, but a pleasant beer as an occasional one-off. I like how they eschewed hops and still managed to pull this off. It seems like a very Dogfish Head style beer, and I couldn't see Sam doing it any different. Beau's continue to be one of the most exciting and innovative breweries in the province. Well done!","bobsy","Feb 05, 2011"
3.85,0,4,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Bottle at Volo. This is an imperial vegetable herb beer, with stated inclusion of myrtle branches, ginseng, some extra oats. I am getting creamed oats, chocolate, dry stout, chamomille and bananna in the finish, cocoa cola/root beer. Nothing at all like the bog water/chocolate stout aroma. black with a ring of head. Smooth drinker,though bit thin mouthfeel, medicine for what "ales" you.","Sammy","Jan 25, 2011"
