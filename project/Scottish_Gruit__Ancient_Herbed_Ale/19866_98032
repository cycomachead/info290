4,-9.1,,,,,,"Pour is golden amber, light haze, with a tight off white head.  Nose is sweet, white grapes and golden fruits combine with a boozy note and a moderate spice to it.  Taste is much brighter and more integrated.  Strong peach notes come through, the booze is integrated rather than another contrasting flavor.  Strong herbal flowery spice throughout the finish.  Light body, enough carbonation, and a fairly dry finish.","cpetrone84","Nov 18, 2014"

4.26,-3.2,4,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,"The beer pours a slightly hazy yellow-orange with no head or sediment. The nose is subtle and herbal - predominantly highlights the lemongrass, but also has notes of gin, yeast, and oak. The taste has a mild herbal quality, modest lemony tartness, and a slight bite from the peppercorns in the finish. This beer is light and refreshing with approachable herbal qualities, easy drinkability that's perfect for summer (despite its relatively complex flavor profile), and a citrusy tart, slightly bitter, and semi-dry finish. This beer has a tremendous amount of interesting flavors, but is pulled off very well and is definitely a beer I'd enjoy again in the future.","ThePorterSorter","May 07, 2014"

Taste is much the same with sour and tart fruit and herbal flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a great sour and herbal flavor that makes this one quite easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","Oct 22, 2013"
