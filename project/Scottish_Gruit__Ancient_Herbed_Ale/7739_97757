3.45,5.8,3.25,3.75,3.25,3.5,3.5,"O- Plaid to the Bone is a pleasant Ale that is a refreshing change from the heavily hopped brews I usually consume. It's got loads of pleasant sweetness without the hop-bomb to go with it. Although I can't say this will be a regular for me, it is a good brew and I could certainly see this as a summer refresher.","PorterPro125","Aug 10, 2014"

3.16,-3.1,3,3.25,3.25,3,3,"Plaid to the Bone is pretty much just all skin and bone. It has a pale, frail, and plain profile that does no justice to its special ingredient nor the fantastic brewery that made it; hopefully Picaroons comes up with a different recipe for 2014 because they are capable of much better than this. This may be the first and only Picaroons beer I didn't truly enjoy.","biegaman","Sep 27, 2013"

4.05,24.2,3.75,4.25,4,4,4,"500ml bottle poured into pint glass. Very clear and pale with a lot of carbonation. Nice aromatic bouquet on the nose with a lot of herbs coming trough. Really pleasant flavor, well balanced and different because of the lack of hops. Really nice summer beer","schnarr84","0"
