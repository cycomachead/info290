1.39,-48.7,3.5,2,1,1,1,"As mentioned by others, the appearance is quite nice. Things go south pretty quickly from there. The smell is not completely terrible; some nice nutty/earthy notes. However, once it enters your mouth those same notes are intensified to levels that just aren't very palatable.","ebin6","Mar 02, 2010"

3.61,33.2,3,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,"It's amber in color, not a whole lot of head or retention. I wasn't expecting it to smell it did. The beer is brewed with two oddball spcies, but thyme and sage are what they smell like (yes, I know those aren't the exact spcies, but that's what it smells like to me). It smells like good, spicy pizza sauce that my local pizzaria makes. A hopless beer. I don't taste much malt, as the spice is well presented in this beer. An interesting taste, just like the aroma...it justs smells better than it tastes. One serving was fine for me. Could be a great beer to pair with food.","DoubleJ","Oct 08, 2009"

3.48,28.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,3,"This is probably the most unique review I have done. I have tried a few of Brian's non-hopped beers before and found this to be my least favorite. I really see this used better as a cooking ingredient than a beverage. I gave it 3.5 for smell and taste because I found them both to be very interesting.","mjl21","Beers"
4.2,55,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The taste is similar, but much lighter. The herbal-woody character is clearly present, but much more muted and blending with the rest to add some complexity and an intriguing character without actually tasting so obviously herbal as it smells. It has a nice, faintly fruity-toasty maltiness along with it, light sweetness, very light bitterness, and good balance overall. It has a good, solid, yet lively feel and character, and is easy to drink depsite the strong uniqueness. One of the more successful experimental beers from Moonlight in my book, this gets big points for being both very unusual and characterful, yet enjoyable and easy to drink.","Offa","0"
