4,9.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Served on tap at the Crab Shack in Newport News, VA.  Pours a nice amber color with a frothy white head and decent lacing.  The aroma is distinctly floral with fruity accents and the taste is well balanced, hoppy, but not overpowering.  Mouthfeel is solid with a good bitter aftertaste, again not overpowering.  Overall this is a solid IPA.","Doctor_Bogenbroom","Dec 10, 2014"

3.25,-11.2,,,,,,"Decent beer with a clear gold color and great head. first thing I smell id=s malt. Taste  hits you first with malty sweetness, than moves into the bitterness of hops and citrus, more citrus than hops. Finish is bitter and nice, and ends crisp with a touch of hop bitterness at the end. Overall, ok but expected a little more kick of the hops","hophugger","Jul 04, 2014"
