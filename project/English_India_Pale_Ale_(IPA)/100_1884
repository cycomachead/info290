4.75,29.8,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,"You know The Bros' Rankings are sometimes quite high on beers that don't overwhelm the denizens of BA. However, I think that they just nail a lot of them. They are not afraid to give high marks to stuff that is (in my experience) just plain good, without the hype. I'm in no way saying that all of BA is a bunch of hype helpers, but this is one case where it's like, wow, this is a really unique beer for many reasons and the Bros score is right in line with mine. Though, mine of course, is just an opinion and I will say that there are many , man, many more qualified raters than I. However, it's really all opinion in a sense. Blathering, but just loved this and like a very adept review  that is below mine, was blown away by the beer after I had seen such mediocre ratings. Sometimes you wonder how much thought is being out into the ratings. It's always like there is this regression to the mediocre mean...how many beers rank from 81-86...a huge majority I would believe. And many of us call this mediocre...well in this case you're missing out if you don't try it. Besides, it's got a dead horse on the bottle...what better to do than beat it, which is what I seem to be doing.","31Sam13","Dec 30, 2014"

I was pleasently suprised by the strong malt and delicious hops of this English Style IPA.  Very clean profile, very different than most IPA's now a days.  Do yourself a favor and try it.","djnickelb","Dec 30, 2014"
