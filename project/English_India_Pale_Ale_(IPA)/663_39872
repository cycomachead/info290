3,7.1,3,3,3,3,3,"This was just one month old but the hops were not suitably strong enough to warrant calling this an IPA. I get a mixture of lemon and a light herbal note that compliments a sweet caramel body. Some rose petal and a ribbon of floral perfume coasts through. This is weak and cheap, but at $1 a bottle that's to be expected. I found this off style but with enough flavor to warrant a try.","KYGunner","Jan 11, 2015"

2.49,-11.1,4.25,2,2.5,2,2.75,"This cheap IPA gets a almost 3 overall rating only because it connects to a Pabst skunkiness that I have a weak spot for.  nostalgia aside, the carmel color and drinkability of this decently heavy IPA is a good cheap option.","ZErhardt","Jan 05, 2015"

2.92,4.3,3.25,3,2.75,3,3,"The FDA should have a rule that a label cannot say IPA unless hops have actually touched liquid. Glad I bought one bottle instead of a whole 6-pack at Trader Joes. Possibly the recipe changed? ABV is 5.7% and color is closer to brown than to "bronze" or "copper" in previous reviews. No trace of Federal Jack on the label, and it says brewed in Portland ME not Kennebunkport. Definitely not worth $6 a six-pack when Mission Street IPA is the same price.","CAcreeks","Dec 13, 2014"

3,7.1,3,3,3,3,3,"With my limited experience judging beer, I have a hard time understanding some of the reviews here. Folks go into a lot of detail about things that I don't make out – like caramel and malty taste factors, and grassy hop smell. I can tell that there are hops in this brew and that it has a crisp refreshing taste; and someone said that the finish is dry – I agree. The head is light, and lacing is minimal, but when all is said and done there's still a wee bit left. Torpedo blows this brew out of the water, but it's a good beer, and as of this review will be my standard of comparison for a good average brew (3 points across the board). I'm reporting on a 12 oz. bottle from Trader Jose's with a freshness date of June 2015.","Redog","Oct 23, 2014"
