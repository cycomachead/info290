The only thing unique about their line of IPA's is that their is an apple, pear quality in some of them that hits the right note sometimes. Very, very, very subtle...my mind making up for better days with the brew? Not bad, but not going to grab except in a pinch.","31Sam13","Jan 15, 2015"

Very refreshing for an ipa if you've been drinking a lot of hopper beers due to how it carries the hops. Triceratops love this shot.","brontosaurus","Dec 08, 2014"
