3.15,-14.2,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"So yeah, it isn't that hop-forward compared to most American IPAs. It also has the same distinct wang as the Chocolate and Oatmeal stouts (which is not a bad thing - I find Unibroue to have the same theme). However, this is a solid beer. Not a great one, but certainly not a bad one. Would I buy again? Probably not - I like my IPAs like I like my sports - AMERICAN","CIBoy10","Mar 25, 2015"
