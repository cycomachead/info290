It also has the same distinct wang as the Chocolate and Oatmeal stouts (which is not a bad thing - I find Unibroue to have the same theme). However, this is a solid beer. Not a great one, but certainly not a bad one. Would I buy again? Probably not - I like my IPAs like I like my sports - AMERICAN","CIBoy10","Apr 02, 2015"

3.95,7.6,4.5,3.25,4.25,4,4,"As an encore to their Oatmeal Stout in the variety pack, I went with this English style IPA next. Poured in to their signature Samuel Smith pint glass, the beer puts forth a rising head of spongy off white foam. 3 fingers of froth rests atop a tangerine-orange brew of notable clarity. Tons of lacing hangs around as the foam dissipates. Beautiful appearance. The aroma gives off biscuit malts and only traces of hops. Certainly not nearly as aromatic as its American brethren. Despite the lack of a pronounced hop bouquet, it is still hop-forward in the flavor department. But of the tame citrus variety, with minimal bitterness. They definitely put a leash on it. A touch of toffee and some metallic accents that zing your tongue.There's some orange sweetness, light pine, and fruity esters to round out the flavors. The pleasant and slightly dry aftertaste conjures thoughts of herbal tea, and there's a good mix of malt and hops. The beer is effervescent with a juicy feel. A pretty solid body given its relative lack of weight. Overall, I think we Americans have been spoiled with mega-IPA's that obliterate your senses. This is a refreshing and easy alternative with a historic pedigree and distinguished character. Hopheads may find this leaving them a little wanting, but if you can appreciate it for what it is, it's great. Balanced, refined. A true classic.","JohnnyI","Feb 02, 2015"

Nose of light caramel, light herbal and bittering hops, and light bread.  Flavors are a medium caramel malts backbone with a light bready flavor that gives way to the bittering hops in the background.  High carbonation, almost seltzer water like, gives it a crisp mouth feel that finishes bracingly bitter without being over the top.  A solid example of a good British IPA.","Brutaltruth","Jan 04, 2015"

A true beauty of a beer, one of the best looking IPAs I have ever seen. Scents of abundant floral and herbal hops with notes of jasmine and lavender. An earthy hop presence is also discernible alongside hints of honey and crystal malt. Very faint traces of fruit. An excellent aroma profile that is rich, floral, earthy and pleasant. Excellently done. Flavor begins with a nice hit of floral and herbal hops, with a slightly medicinal flavor to them and faint honey-like notes and toasted malt in the background. The level of bitterness is lower than in American IPAs but pleasant and true to style. These flavors continue throughout the sip and are joined in the middle by a nice earthy, hoppy character and moderate-high bitterness. Finish is dry with notes of floral, herbal and earthy hops and a faint hint of honey. Aftertaste is dry with floral, herbal and earthy notes, toasted malt and the tiniest hint of honey. An excellent, complex, hoppy, yet not overbearing flavor profile that is true to style and quite pleasant on the palette. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with moderate carbonation and a slightly dry character. Wonderfully done, pleasant to drink and very true to style. Overall this is an excellent English IPA that captures the aroma, flavor, mouthfeel and spirit of the style perfectly. Well worth having.","Auraan","Jun 14, 2014"

3.69,0.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured from the bottle into an English pub glass. Notably light in color, a gold yellow with a formidable dull white head that holds its shape. Aroma is floral and fruity, reminiscent of black tea, dried apricots, perhaps some unlit tobacco, faint citrus rind. Some classic English hop aroma but overall the smell is restrained. Palate features a similarly downplayed malt backbone that manifests as caramel and popcorn with the odd toasty protuberance, a hint of treacle, a fruity floral bubble gum element (or perhaps grape popsicle?), and the black tea/dried fruit notes from the nose. Gentle on the mouth despite the aggressive head and carbonation, smooth and featuring the unusual Samuel Smith diacetyl caress that works so well in their brews. Body on the thin side. Finishes semi-dry, including a lingering sweetness as well as a mineral bite. Some forest floor type hop effects. Overall, my impression is favorable. Some unique hop and yeast-derived flavors which grew on me as I made my way through an initially mellow and murky pint in which I struggled to pinpoint the specific flavors.","CalgaryFMC","Mar 08, 2014"

I think overtime it could win me over for the sheer fact that the English invented IPA so they could ship beer to India without spoilage. The hop flavors are not as pronounced as an AIPA, yet the bitterness is much more distinct. The flavor is nice, but does not stand out. Though, I would like to try this again paired against some spicy Indian or Thai fare to see how it holds up; with the bitterness, I suspect it will perform quite well. Will definitely try this again.","Badger6","Jan 30, 2014"

The well-integrated hops are present as you savor, not afterward. The malt and a little balanced sweetness are what stays with you. This gets solid points for being an extremely drinkable beer - not epically brilliant, but really fantastic for a session. I will get this again without question.","angusdegraosta","Jan 18, 2014"

Then you get the hop crispness.  English style IPAs are so nice a variety they need to be visited much more often after having so many of the American hopped varieties.

Reminds me strongly of Wells IPA, except with a much more appealing aroma and complex hop bill - this brew provides plenty of leafy English hop bitterness, which may or may not appeal to fans of the American style.

This beer is not hop-focused and in fact it seems that certain special malts (and perhaps a yeast strain) have been chosen for their ability to mask -or, perhaps, better match-- the large number of hops used in this brew. This is a malty, biscuity, somewhat dry brew, but it is very refreshing and would be excellent with food. Certainly worth a try for any of my fellow "Continental" hop-heads, but taste it with an education about what you are drinking. This is not an American IPA and that is not a bad thing.","BeerDocT","Aug 29, 2013"

Aromas of orange zest, pear, apple, caramel, toffee, toast, bread, floral, grass, honey, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of fruity/floral hop and yeast notes with good malt balance; and solid strength. Taste of orange zest, pear, apple, caramel, toffee, floral, light pine, toast, bread, grass, honey, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of earthy floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of orange, light fruits, caramel, toffee, floral, light pine, toast, bread, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of moderate hop flavors; with a very balanced malt backbone and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good English IPA style. Very nice balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 29, 2013"

I also had this after a couple of pretty mean American india pale ales, so perhaps my palate didn't do justice to this beer as it otherwise might have.

3.68,0.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Overall - This being my first experience with the English IPA, I must say that it is certainly not for me. Although I think American brewers sometimes get out of hand with their hoppy character, this English counterpart has almost no hop presence. I would absolutely recommend trying this beer once, just to get the feel for the English version of the IPA, but it must be explained that the English take on the IPA is very different from the American. A drinker going into a bottle of Samuel Smiths expecting something even close to a Stone product (for example) is in for a rude awakening.","TheCondor","Jul 29, 2012"

Aroma of sweet caramel malt and a light fruit component. Reminiscent of a doppelbock. Flavor is more muted. Starts with neutral malt with a peppery hop bite, dry malt middle and hop bitterness in the finish. The malts are not distinctive. The spicy hop start is interesting, but the ale overall is rather low key. Light to medium body. Like a watered down, somewhat hoppy old ale.

The smell to me was one of caramel with a hint of the underlying alcohol. For an IPA, it is significantly less bitter than some other IPA's. If you're looking for a hop bomb, look elsewhere. The taste of hops is in the undertone and what is apparent is the delicious taste of malts. Mouthfeel is silky and pleasant. The carbonation is prefect. Overall a great IPA and very drinkable.

Turns out I needn't have avoided this one either. Unlike the pale ale, however, I don't think I'll get this one again, which is a first for me with Samuel Smith's brews. Not that I dislike it - it's perfectly sessionable and refreshing. But like the pale ale it lacks something on the back end, lacks robustness. The pale ale skates by just on the edge of watery. This one seems to cross the line and I want more flavor and richness in a beer. One possible factor, I got this from my grocery store's build-your-own-sixpack rack.

If you can get the West coast IPA out of your head this is a truly tasty beer. Impeccably balanced with a wonderful malt profile. I can't say I'll be getting it again, but thats more because there are too many damn good beers out there I haven't tried.

2.95,-19.6,4.5,2,3,4,3,"Overall I thought that this was a pretty average English IPA, I admit I don't have that much experience with English IPA's and this is my first traditional one brewed in England, but this IPA just didn't do it for me, there wasn't enough hop flavors to balance out the overly sweet malts. The lack of flavor and the sweeter then normal malts makes this beer not that drinkable a whole bottle is a little too much, I lost interest after the first 8 ounces. What I liked most about this beer was the look and mouthfeel, it looked pretty good in the Samuel Smith pint glass, and the mouthfeel was on par for an English IPA. What I liked least about this beer was the aroma and taste, the aroma was pretty close to their Nut Brown Ale with those overly sweet malts that smell more like a mixture of sherry and apple juice then they smell like a beer, and the taste wasn't too balanced with the overly sweet malts taking over putting the hops on the back burner. I won't be buying this beer again, and I would have to be pretty desperate for a beer to drink this again. I don't recommend this beer, the malt base is too sweet and it doesn't let enough hop flavors come through. So far I am 0 for 2 with the Samuel Smith Holiday pack, this beer wasn't as bad as the Nut Brown Ale, but it still wasn't good either. I don't know if these beers are old or if I just don't like the sweet malt profile of their beers. Bridge Brew Work's IPA is still my favorite IPA, I would gladly take that or this beer any day. I hope their Oatmeal Stout is much better because so far I am unimpressed with this English Brewery.","StoutHunter","Dec 05, 2011"

It's not massively bitter, but it's a decent beer that helps the drinker get a feel for how the style started. With American IPAs averaging in the 7% range these days to move product by attracting consumers to the high alcohol content, this English ale is a refreshing change of pace, at 5% alcohol and American pale ale level IBUs.

A good bready malt stands up nicely to the slight tang found from the grapefruit hops, but doesn't get in the way of a nice little bitter hop bite in the end. A slightly bitter finish lingers for a little bit, also leaving that tanginess. Its slightly undercarbonated, leading to a watery mouthfeel that doesn't complement the flavors as well as it could. It feels slightly vinous, which doesn't seem to work in this one. All around though its not a bad beer.

Malts start up the aroma along with a candied butterscotch element. Hops are slight. The medium body maintains its texture. The taste is up front malty and slightly bitter on the end thanks to the laid back hops. Much more subtle than the modern day IPA and I have to wonder if this was the way IPA's were meant to be brewed way back when. The hops were more of a preservative and I expect brewers did not want to lose the character of their beer when it took the long trip to India.

4.09,11.4,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Appearance is darker than your typical IPA; more of a dark cooper to light brown color. A moderate white head lasts about halfway through, with little lacing. Upon opening the bottle, you are greeted with a wonderful floral/fruity scent; smells almost like apple to me. The taste is wonderful too - hops are prominent but well balanced with malt. The earthy pear bitterness is backed by a slight butterscotch. Looking forward to enjoying another one of these.","DeltaGolfSierra","Apr 06, 2011"

The nose is very metallic at first. Strong, smell of pennies that mellows after a while and becomes much more fruity and pleasant with hints of perfume. The taste is very well balanced. Nice sweet caramel malt base offset nicely with a bitter, tangy hop bite. Earthy, spicy and toasty all at once with hints of tea, citrus, pennies and toffee. Super smooth, dry, bitter finish makes this a great session beer. Another great beer from Samuel Smith's!","beerdrifter","Apr 01, 2011"
3.38,-7.9,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"This pours dark orange with nice chunky head. I hate to sound non-specific, but it has that European nuttiness in the smell, possibly yeast. The taste is fairly hollow on the first impression. It isn't sweet or particularly malty. I don't pick up on an abundance of hops. I think it smells like a Guinness, and it has the same cereal maltiness in the taste. I will say that this has decent drinkability and a good, medium mouthfeel. It is nice and bitter and has a pleasant bite. "Old world beer" is what I keep thinking in my mind. There is a metallic flavor that I don't care for. This just does not have to fruitiness or hoppiness that I crave in an IPA. For me, this is more like a brown ale or an ESB...or an English Bitter for that matter. This beer makes me want to eat cheese.","beerdown77","Mar 31, 2011"

The beer has a lot in common with New England style IPAs: Harpoon, Long Trail, Shipyard--milder, herb-like fuggles and goldings hops. With the biscuit and toffee malts dominating the smell and taste, it shares much of the profile of barlewine, except for the much lighter alcohol content. The magic is in brewing a 5% beer with this much flavor! So happy to track down a 4pack of 12-oz bottles.","salvo","Mar 19, 2011"

Very malt forward beer, with a dulling hop presence that makes it's way onto the palate, providing a touch of bitterness and very little flavor. Some faint dark ripened fruits appear with the first malty sip. Mouthfeel is moderate to light, but slightly watery and creamy. Very little carbonation in this bottle.

What's left is a rich estery scent - cherries and apples - and a mellow malt sweetness. Much of the same in the taste - very fruity - it's the most dominant element here. The least dominant element is the bitterness - there, but a whimper. The malt impact and body is moderately light and the drinking is sweet and softly smooth.

Golden amber in color with a fluffy thick head of about an inch and a half, extending well out of the boundries of the glass. Heavy malt and hop aroma, can definatly pick out British hops. Malty and fruity in flavor, some lingering bitterness from hops, but not at all as hoppy as the American versions. Actually pretty balanced between the carmally malt flavor and hop bitterness. Carbonation and body appropriate for the style.","ccbrewer138","Nov 06, 2010"

It's designed so that just one pint is enough to satiate... but several would be all the better.","biegaman","Nov 06, 2010"

This is not necessarily a bad thing in general, as the ale doesn't slip into saccharine sweetness. That being said, the dominant aroma here is honey and malts, not hops, and while it has a dry finish, I wouldn't say that I particularly notice an abundance of hops bitterness. Drinkable, but if it's hot out and you're hoping for a powder keg of hops to cool you off, I recommend you stick with an American IPA you know and trust.","TheNapkin","Oct 20, 2009"

The hop flavors are weak and the finish is bland to average with regard to the hoppiness. The body is okay tending towards syrupy and leaving an unpleasant film on the pallet.

The attack is smooth and easy with the hops casually presentint itself in the flavor. The beer dries in the mouth as it finishes. There is a somewhat bitter aftertaste.

Has some subtle floral aroma along with some malt notes. Less citrus and more floral and earthy in the flavor from the hops. Solid biscuit malt flavor gives a solid fondation. Finishes with a subtle sweet citrus flavor. Bitterness is on the low side. The body is nothing special. In fact it feels thin but the carbonation is gentle and lends a good texture.

There was a solid malt backbone to the beer which rounded out the bitterness. The finish was sweet and hoppy. The yeast flavor was generally clean and smooth.

Medium-bodied, buoyed by broad carbonation, floats in the mouth as much as hugs the tongue.

It has a lot of hoppy and yeasty flavour, but the hop bitterness is restrained to the poitn of just dominating the light sweetness, giving a lightly bitter finish. It's highly quenching, with a juicy-yeasty tarness similar to other English IPAs (like Ridgeway) and exceedingly drinkable.","Offa","Dec 02, 2008"

There is a traditional hoppy character to the beer, some herbal tea like hops, but also traditionally balanced and slightly bittering in all the right spots.

You can smell sweet malts and a hint of lemony hops. It's not a knock you over your head hops. I like this taste. Extremely well balanced. Smooth piney hops start out the journey followed by some sweet caramel malts. Throughout the experience, hops tickle the tongue. It has a medium mouthfeel that is well carbonated for the experience. This is a highly drinkable ale for any occasion. I would gladly buy this ale again.","wardough","Dec 27, 2007"

Very biscuity flavor with this one with a touch of fruit and hard water mineral like character as well.

Aroma is surprising, I was expecting a mild malty aroma, but this one had some type of spiciness I couldn't place. The answer was in the taste. In addition to the malt backbone, this beer has a strong hint of astringency, kind of like a hefe. An unusual combination of malt, fruit and astringency makes this one a bit more complex than I was expecting. Very smooth, rich enough mouthfeel and highly drinkable.

In the mouth it's smooth with a medium body and restrained, fine-bubbled carbonation.

Poured to a nice orange color with thick off-white head that lasted the entire glass, and excellent lacing. Aroma was mildly hoppy, but scent in particualr. Likewise with the flavor, tasty, but nothing special. Like most SS beers Ive rated, the body is thin and watery, and the palate metallic. Hard to give a good rating with a bad finish.","kimcgolf","Oct 28, 2006"
2.23,-39.2,4.5,1.5,1.5,2,4,"Pours a hazy, deep gold with a dense two and a half finger head. Great retention and excellent spotty lacing. Spicy alcohol and cinnamon in the nose, mild enlgish hops and a hint of toasted pale malt. Initially sweet with toasty base malt and a hint of crystal. Next, vague dextrins and a soft diacetyl come through to couple with a quasi-phenolic fruitiness and a dry but not very bitter aftertaste. Some oily enlgish hops give an herbal, tea-like flavor -but the hop charcter is very limited and quite unbalanced for the style. Medium in body and light-ish carbonation-this is just crisp enough to fight off any slickness. Finishes dry and fruity; very drinkable with interesting malt and yeast attributes, but grossy lacking an identity similiar to the classic English IPA.","PBRstreetgang","Oct 26, 2006"

Lively carbonated body with good balance of smooth creaminess. Flavor is dominated by leafy hops, balanced with biscuit malts, and shot through with mineral water hardness and a definite (but not overwhelming) diacetyl presence. Finishes with hoppy citrus dryness. Quite drinkable and superbly balanced.","dgallina","Oct 15, 2006"
4.28,16.6,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Pours a light copper with a thin, creamy head that leaves very raised and ornate lacing. Moderate carbonation. Malt smells are very sweet, nutty, and bready. I pick up a little date in there as well. The Tadcaster yeast is evident as well. Faint noble hop, which I would have expected to me more pronounced. Taste is rather bitter through and through, walking alongside the fruity esters, bready malt, and floral hop flavors. Bitterness continues on throughout the aftertaste along with some nuttiness and yeastiness. Mouthfeel is moderate and a little bubbly. A great drinker, and a nice change from American IPAs and all their NW hops. Another great Sam Smith.","goochpunch","Oct 14, 2006"

3.86,5.2,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"It pours a clear light-auburn with two-finger foamy pale white head. On closer inspection it reveals a surprisingly strong malt nose, with a touch of citrus and alcohol. The citrus turns out to be a robust hoppy flavor and the alcohol flavor follows all the way through to the finish. While the initial burst is mild citrus and pleasant hops, the carbonation carries the first flavors away and the taste soon fades to sweet malty, bread-like finish. The finish doesn't stick around long, and is soon replaced by a metallic/alcohol like flavor that begs for another sip, even if only to get rid of the metallic flavor. This beer begs to be drank and the reasonably priced bottle goes quickly. A thoroughly enjoyable beer that is great for summer evenings and fall afternoons.","jglazer75","Oct 05, 2006"

Taste is toffee and butter maltiness, nicely balanced by the classic English hop character that comes through in the finish. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, and drinkability is very good.

Hop flavor here isn't as strong as expected, it mainly provides a dry, herbal aspect to the dominate malt flavors.

3.7,0.8,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle (amber glass for a Samuel Smith beer -- hell yeah!). Pours clear amber with sticky light onionskin colored head. Moderate carbonation. Hoppy aroma is of course somewhat subdued as this is an English IPA. Fruity esters of orange marmelade, canned pineapple, and a sweetish, almost banana-like scent. Interesting to say the least! On the taste, hops are floral and earthy, almost but not quite pine-inflected. Strangely, lowish alcohol content (5% abv) is not very well masked. Malts come through in mid-sip as a caramelly side note before a lovely mineral/bitter hop finish. Earthy bitter hop burps finish sour. Medium body and slightly astringent, juicy/chewy mouthfeel. This IPA is a fine choice, however, more often than not I find other choices I prefer more without the high price of Samuel Smith beers (the only justafiably priced one, IMO, is their Russian Imperial Stout).","orfeu","Apr 17, 2006"

The m/f is light and I don't really think the sweet malt and the hop bitterness is well balanced together.

The taste is metallic then sweet for just a second before going very dry with a big bitterness and a dry, clean finish. Mouthfeel is on the thicker side with some stinging carbination. While there isn't really anything wrong with this beer, there is nothing terribly interesting about it either. I'd sooner take some of its American counterparts, especially for the price. Not Sam Smith's best beer by a long shot. Interestingly, I've had this beer past it's prime (like almost a year old probably) and thought it was very good.

There might be a touch of cardboard but I don't think it's an old beer. It has a body that is medium and smooth, coating the mouth well and leaving you wanting another sip.

However, the hops are present to balance it out fairly well. It doesn't have the bite I was expecting before I poured the bottle, but I was reassured that the hops were present after my initial smell. This is a little too malt heavy than my liking, but a different experience all together for the style. It coats the tongue well. Flavors are ever present throughout the mouth and the tongue.

A strong yeasty precense dries out the sweetness and adds that unique Sam Smith flavor. The finish is strong on the hops with a tea like quality to them.

Strong malty aroma packed with bready and caramely toffee notes. Hops are floral, fairly estery with a bit of an herbal quality. Hops are assertive and spirited in their bitter presence. Plenty of grapefruit and a little puckering astringincy. Malts are present from the beginning to end providing some good toasty bread character. Finish is dry, but not overly so, with hops providing some pine and herbal grassiness which blend with the quite toasty malts.

The taste is the same way, very understated and taking some time for the full flavor to come about. When you hold it in your mouth a fruity taste takes hold, then when you swallow it the traditional IPA taste emerges, but its mixed with the same potpourri of fruit. Unlike many of the Samuel Smiths, I feel as though I could have a couple of these and not get tired of the taste.

Pretty smooth for an IPA, none of the characteristic bitterness that I enjoy. Smooth and a bit oily in the mouth, with ample carbonation. A bit of pepperyness, but not enough in my opinion.

As it warmed, it smelled more and more fruity and malty with notes of honey. It was surprisingly sweet smelling and lacking in the typical hop smells for an Indian Ale (but perhaps I'm too used to drinking American IPAs). It tasted like it smelled, sweet and fruity with some tangy notes and a strong bitter finish, which tended to linger heavily. It's body was medium to light, leaning more towards the light side and very smooth. This is a weird beer for me... it just seems really too sweet to be an Indian Ale but I'm no expert.

This highly hopped ale displays a sharp grapefruit bitterness with a mild lemony sour taste. The light metallic tang provides some back of the throat edginess.

In the middle there is a little kick of citrus, and at the end a good bitter hop finish. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and strong. The drinkability is also pretty good. Truely a classic original IPA.

Nice medium-full mouthfeel that is smooth and slick feeling. The malt and hops seem very well balanced throughout. Nice subdued caramel malts towards the start, and a bit of a mild hop bite towards the finish. The hops linger into the aftertaste and are slightly citric.

It is OK for an IPA to have significant maltiness, in my opinion. This is just a good English pale ale with an extra helping of hops. Never mind the IBU (bitterness) pissing contest of American brewers. Here are the particulars: Pours a nice thick head that subsided to 1/2 inch (more like 1 cm), deep golden-amber color, low to moderate carbonation. aroma is predominantly sweet, biscuity malt and earthy spicy hops in the background. Flavor is a nice intermingling of malt and strong hops. Very balanced and luxurous in the mouth. Fnished easy and leaves a pleasant malty/alcohol/hoppy aftertaste.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied and is has a nice creamy finish. I have read several reviews stating that this beer is not as intense as some IPAs, however this is my first and I can not draw the same conclusions. Ultimately, high intensity is not necessarily what makes a beer rate high in my book. S.

The India had a very fruity nose with an abbundence of rose petal like malts and not anything in the way of hops. Same could be said for the taste. It was thin and sweet almost like a cider with lots of caramel malts. I am not entirely sure what to think of it. I liked it, but was it a IPA or some other strange beer?

The hops are more understated than American IPA's, which is a good thing IMO. It pours an amber/copper color...dark for the style, the head isn't big but lasts. You know from the aroma alone that its well balanced, because the malt and hops both come through. Mouthfeel is smooth as silk. I can't put my fingers on all the tastes, but there is some toasted malts, a buttery toffee, and a bitterness in the dry finish. I (reluctantly) handed the glass to my wife and asked if she could think of any way to improve this brew.

The taste is butterscotch malt profile brought on by the open fermentation that this and other Sam Smith beers under go. The nice rolling hop profile is a creamy buttery combo.

Finish is tart, bitter, and long, with the bitterness coating the tongue long after you've swallowed. The heavier hops in this one deliver a cleanness and bite throughout, though of course nowhere near the intense hops we see so often in American IPAs. This is a very balanced brew, English in its fruitiness and maltiness with bitterness mostly weighing in in the finish. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both solid.","Riggo","Apr 09, 2003"
4.15,13.1,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Pours a hazy copper color with a thick, sticky, off-white head, which has good retention. Aroma is mildly sweet, possibly caramel, with a fair amount of spicy hops. Taste is very well balanced, the hops and malt complementing each other very well finished off by a caramel-like sweetness. Mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and very smooth. This beer isnt as hoppy as most IPAs, but its still a great beer.","Scooter77","Mar 31, 2003"
3.87,5.4,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Poured a dark amber color with little to no head,mine had been onthe shelf for awhile and developed a winey smell to it but it held up well.The malt in this IPA was very evident upfront with a good hpsmack in the end.A very well made IPA even sitting on shelf for almost a year u could taste the flavors of a very good well-made ale.","oberon","Mar 23, 2003"
3.54,-3.5,3,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Not a bad brew, but nothing special. The sweetness was a tad much for me. I am glad to see Sam Smith using a brown bottle for this beer.","Quaffer","Mar 23, 2003"

3.43,-6.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"This beer poured a dark amer color with a white head that crested at three fingers then reduced down to about a quarter inch. The lacing was minimal. There wasn't much aroma happening here, but there was a little bit of a fruity smell. I guess you could add hops to that because they were noticeable as well. It just wasn't very strong. The taste was hoppy and a bit fruity. There just wasn't anything that jumped out in the taste besides the hops. The finish was slightly bitter but not enough for this style. This brew seemed to have a lot of carbonation, maybe a little too much. I wasn't real impressed with this brew, although I would drink it again.","Bruiser81","Mar 12, 2003"
4.3,17.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A terrifically well-rounded brew, and very drinkable. Finish is simple, sweet, and ever-lasting. Another excellent Smith offering.","feloniousmonk","Mar 05, 2003"
3.45,-6,3.5,3.5,3,4,4,"Pours out copper amber with a nice white head. Good malt/hop balance. A bit of a tea thing going on here too I think, but that may just be the "English" in it. Very easy to drink. Interesting flavor, but far from being a favorite IPA. I guess I was hoping for a bigger brew.","scottum","Feb 26, 2003"
3.97,8.2,3.5,4,4,4,4,"It is very smooth with a low level of carbonation. The hops are not a real kick in the pants. I enjoy a good lashing of hops, but with this beer, it is just not necessary. They blend in very well with a smooth rich flavor caramel and grain. The aftertaste brings the hops back and is just a delite. I do not think I will ever go wrong with Samuel Smith. This is certainly not the best IPA I have had, but it is clearly what I had expected out of the Tadcaster Brewery, their own unique interpretation of the style.","ElGuapo","Feb 14, 2003"
4.62,25.9,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Seems like this is what a true IPA should taste like, although I still love the american inerpretation of the style. Great brew!!!!","avylover","Feb 13, 2003"
4.3,17.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Taste = you go thru stages with this beer, malty sweet and bitter in good balance as you take a drink, as you swallow the sweet leaves and only the bitter remains. A long, long finish. Plenty o' hops. Yummy.","texascarl","Feb 08, 2003"
4.12,12.3,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"The beer pours a translucent deep copper or mahogany if you prefer. Head is Bunyanesque, with a frothy texture, and light tan in color, as it dematerializes, it leaves behind a thick and clinging lace upon the glass. The aroma of sweet ripe apples, a hint of the hop flowers, and a nice malt underpinning to cap off this exquisite nose. The start is malt and quite sweet, the top middling in its feel to the palate, the finish hop spicy, but not overpowering, the acidity moderate, and the aftertaste dry. A quite decent beer, just the right amount of hops and malt, with a crisp bite, that I find appealing.","Gusler","Jan 28, 2003"

4,9,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a clear copper color with a thick and creamy off-white colored head that eventually dissipates into a nice heavy lace. Nose is floral and spicy hops. Taste is a really nice balance of sweet malts and bitter hops. Very smooth with a nice semi-bitter finish. This is an interesting IPA and one Ill gladly try again.","Morris729","Jan 13, 2003"
3.25,-11.4,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Pours a hazy amber color, nice thick and creamy lasting head, thin body and a little watery, floral mild hop aroma, not as much hop bitterness as I would expect from an IPA. Nice balanced flavors, crisp clean finish, great english IPA, always a drinkable brew.","maxpower","Jan 06, 2003"
4.2,14.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"What a balanced IPA. This brewery has yet to disappoint me. What quality beer they produce. Pours out to a dark, golden amber with a slight head. Nose is hops and malt, which is rather unique to get that malt profile/aroma from an IPA. Taste is that of a wonderfully balanced beer. Yes, there are hops here as there should be with an IPA, but the malt presence is undeniable and delicious. A true session IPA if there ever was one.","proc","Dec 29, 2002"
3.83,4.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Nearly clear amber gold appearance with bulky head of off-white foam. Hoppy crispness comes through in the nose, but the smell of this beer is weaker than expected. What meets expectations is the hopped-up taste--somewhat dry and even a bit sweet. Flavors are quite uniform and balanced throughout. Lingers in the mouth a bit, but drinkability is quite strong.","BitteBier","Dec 21, 2002"
3.68,0.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Nice orange copper color, off-white head, spicy hops and sweet malt nose, spicy hops flavor with subdued sweet malt in the background. The hops are quite nice throughout the drink, however the hops are not as pungent as expected in an IPA. Overall this is a well balanced, easy to drink, satisfying IPA with good flavor.","ThreePistols","Nov 28, 2002"
4.05,10.4,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a glowing copper hue with a frothy, sticky, off-white head which retains fairly well. Steady carbonation is present. Aroma is diverse with notes of spicy hops and sweet caramel malt. Taste is very well balanced, with the hops and malt complementing each other quite well. Although the hop flavor is dominant, this could probably use some more hops. Regardless, it's still pretty solid. Mouthfeel is just a touch carbonated and very smooth. Quite refreshing and drinkable, this is a classy British IPA.","Jon","Nov 08, 2002"
3.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Light copper in color with a small head that didn't last. The smell isn't very powerful.  Light and refreshing and very well balanced.  Not much like the IPA's of today but still tasty.  I have only had a couple Sam Smith's beer and have beer very impressed each time.","CharlesRiver","Nov 06, 2002"

3.78,3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Pours a nice copper color with a foamy head.  The aroma is like that of other Samuel Smith ales with just a hint of bitter spice.  The flavor is of mellow malt with grassy undertones and an unaggressive bitterness.  Not nearly as hoppy as I had hoped for, but very drinkable.  This would be a good way to introduce a tentative real-beer drinker to the world of hop flavors. Not aggressive, but not absent either.","beernut7","Oct 11, 2002"
4.35,18.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The color of Vernors. Aromas are a mixture of butterscotch, lemon zest and brine. Creamy, rich texture supports flavors of seasoned oak, caramel, fried nuts, fig seeds and twiggy hops. Like most other Old Brewery Tadcaster products, this is a cerebral beer. Close your eyes. Drink it warm. Turn the TV off. And contemplate. Don't fight the images of fish n chips vendors, hussies and waifs running through the streets of York... Tobacconists... Spice shops... Sea air... Boardwalk...","putnam","Oct 11, 2002"
4.03,9.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Samuel Smith’s IPA:  Deep amber/copper color.  Full rich head, with staying power.  Very nice hops aroma.  Full hops in the taste, with some mellow caramel malt taste to balance out the hops.  Fairly low in alcohol for an IPA, but with a very classic IPA taste.  A very nice introduction to IPA, and I thought a very agreeable beer.","jackndan","Sep 22, 2002"
3.76,2.5,4,3,4,4,4,"Not bad!  Pours a clear amber/orange color with a 3 finger off white head.  It leaves a lace all the way down the glass.  It smells slightly sweet and tangy.  The taste is initially hop bitterness with just a slight bit of caramel flavoring and finishing with a dry hop bitterness at the end that is stronger than at the beginning.  The mouthfeel is light to medium and goes down rather nicely.  I could definitely drink more than one of these.  Cheers!","BeerAngel","Aug 24, 2002"
4.12,12.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Another fine brew from Old Brewery Tadcaster.  Pours light amber, with a fluffy head that trails down the entire glass.  Smell is dominated by hops, as an IPA should be.  Taste is also predominatley hoppy, with some carmel or butterscotch malt notes. I found this IPA to be very refreshing, and drinkable.","zerk","Jul 31, 2002"
4.2,14.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Another Samuel Smith, and I certainly was not disappointed. Pours a golden amber with a nice thick fluffy white head, sticks all the way down. Very flavorful and slightly sweet, but not much hop flavor. Extremely smooth. Another delicious India ale and yet another kick-ass Samuel Smith brew.","IrishRedRock","Jul 26, 2002"
4.23,15.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Okay, as usual, the Samuel Smith's are great, good or at least descent.  This beer poured a cooper gold color with an off white head that left little lace.  The aroma was of hops, malt and caramel.  The taste was of hops, malt, caramel and butterscotch.  The finish was of hops and caramel, but slightly bitter.  A good beer, but I think I prefer my IPAs(personally)to be a little less sweet.","Wildman","Jul 23, 2002"
4.35,18.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Nice orange color, poured with a lovely head. This was a great post-golf, picnic ale. Lighter than my usual ale choice, with enough hops to draw me in for more.  It must have been the day - drinking down into this it became more citrusy, less bitter. Lower in alcohol too. A definite keeper.","MTMugs","Jul 21, 2002"
4.18,13.9,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Smooth, this I.P is just that. No long lasting bitter mouthfeel but a very easy drink. Amber-orange in color, slight cloud through the glass, off white head and slight lace. A lower abv at 5.0 but still hopped and malted enough to taiste makes this a gentlemens IPA. I was impressed.","chilidog","Jul 06, 2002"
3.86,5.2,4,3,4,4,4.5,"I'm going to start by saying this beer would have received a upper echelon rating but It wasn't a fresh bottle.  It had the similar cardboard taste that I recognized in a bottle of Young's Ram Rod that was past it's best before date. This beer looked very nice, a clear amber with a thin head that left very little lace.  I guess that was the first clue. The aroma was just a tad off, and the taste was a bit old.  My drinkability rating comes from the fact that I remember this beer being so great. It went down pretty nicely despite being off, so I know it would be better.  I'm going to buy another bottle from a different location and re-review.","Mark","Jun 25, 2002"
3.65,-0.5,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Got this one on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. Hoppy, malty, satisfying ale. Big creamy head and decent lacing, although a little on the weak side.","Dogbrick","Jun 25, 2002"
4.1,11.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Clearish amber color, good 1/4 inch head that sticks to itself well.  Hoppy aroma.  Flavorful caramelly malts and pretty nice floral hop assertion.  Slightly hoppier than Fuller's, malts not quite as flavorful.  Nice balance and extremely drinkable.  Reserved, in the English style.  Nice bittering at the swallow, but subtle.","ADR","Jun 10, 2002"
3.66,-0.3,4,3,4,4,3.5,"A very polite IPA.  A somewhat mellow tan color with a billowing rocky head.  The beer has a shy, flirting hop aroma...the first time I had this brew, I expected a powerful "face-full of hops" aroma that just isn't there.  Nice, solid taste, however.  Pleasing bitterness.  Worth having every now and again.","Suds","Apr 26, 2002"
3.66,-0.3,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Huge, creamy, billowy well retained head.  Copper hued w/ excellent clarity.  It almost looks filtered.  Semi - pungent floral and grassy Kent Goldings nose... It must be dry hopped.  Yeast fruitiness, although perceptible, is masked by the relatively strong hop nose.  It's clean and well balanced in taste-- the hop bitterness is moderate for an IPA, but since the malt profile is not the centerstage of this brew, the hops dominate.  Certainly a clean and drinkable brew.  I used to dislike Sam's India Ale before I acquired a taste for British hops.  If you're not used to a rustic, grassy, earthy hop flavor you won't like this brew.  Stylistically speaking it's weak for an IPA, but it tastes like a good English pale.","marc77","Apr 15, 2002"
4,9,4,4,4,4,4,"Well...really not what I expected....but still a good laid back IPA. Starts by pouring a bronze hazy color, off-white / light tan foamy head that lasts for a long while. There is a very nice floral hop aroma. The taste is a pretty good for a IPA, a little shortage of hops but not all that bad, very light citrus notes, a very nice smooth creamy mouth feel and dry middle with a long, clean finish. I had to get to the middle of this one to really enjoy it. Overall enjoyable and worth a try, pretty good stuff! But then again, there are many other great IPA's out there.....","WilliamPhilaPa","Apr 12, 2002"
3.97,8.2,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Hazy copper-orange color, nice chunky head.  I liked the aroma for an IPA-  sweet bread-like malt and floraly hops.  Unlike most American IPA's, the initial taste impression is a sweet fruity maltiness, but finishes nice and bitter.  Drank a lot bigger than its advertised 5% ABV.  A nice change-up IPA.","pbrian","Apr 03, 2002"
3.6,-1.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Notes: A decent ale ... though small in comparison to other modern day IPAs both British and especially American. Oddly enough this brew is not any bit stronger than the Pale Ale in alcohol ... the body and hops are only a notch higher in comparison. Not a bad ale ... at least the English characteristics make this brew an interesting ale.","Jason","Mar 14, 2002"
