3.9,18.5,3.75,3,4.25,4,4.25,"Coppery Amber color. Mild flowery nose. Nice sweet malt taste with the hop bitterness in the background. Not a typical west coast IPA but still quite interesting. Not sure what the point of the organic certification means to most beer drinkers but it means nothing but a marketing ploy to me. Still, good and reasonably priced ($7.50 for a 6-pack).","Lard_City","Feb 02, 2015"

Despite decent looks and feel, the heart and soul of any decent beer is taste and aroma. This beer is sadly deficit in those areas.","beergoot","Aug 14, 2014"
