3.56,1.1,3,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,"The flavor profile falls just short of outstanding.  It is intense, but falls short in balance and complexity.  It has a nice hop flavor focus (herbal, citric and rind) over a mild bitterness in the middle.  Caramel and biscuit sweetness appear in the finish, but are overwhelmed by rind and pine hop flavor.  This hop flavor lingers.","tillmac62","Jan 20, 2015"
