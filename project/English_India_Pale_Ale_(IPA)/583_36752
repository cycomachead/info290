I definitely don't think it's in the same league as some of Schlafly's other IPAs (namely, their wonderful TIPA), but after sipping it for a while, it grows on me slightly. Slightly. Quash some of the acidic qualities, and this would become a genuinely good English IPA. Try it if you can get a single, I guess.","ThisWangsChung","0"

The nose is very subtle in bitterness with some herbal notes but it has more barley and bran grain notes. The flavor is very barleyesque, heavy on dry grain malt, bran flakes and a bitter herb tone. The feel is very dry, crisp, and a bit heavy on carbonation. I understand the style and like heavy malts but this seemed to rely heavily on a dry bran like flavor that just wasn't my favorite.","KYGunner","Jul 07, 2014"

I think a cask pour would do wonders for this, but as it stands its sort of unimpressive, a beer ive had before and forgotten or something, just not distinct on its own. too bog to pair well with a meal, its sort of an oddball in the taproom lineup.","StonedTrippin","Jun 19, 2013"

The aroma was a faint grapefruit aroma, leaning more toward earthy notes. The initial taste was a sour, unrippened grapefruit. Big hops were present, but the hops were more tongue bruising than tasty. In some ways, the hops were almost medicine-like. Did somebody put Nyquil in my IPA? There was no real sense of sweetness or citrus as part of the hops, making the taste one-sided. On close observation, one might detect the malts and a certain biscuity quality that allow the taste to linger. In the aftertaste, the acidity of the hops becomes more harsh. While this has the texture of an IPA, it hardly has any of the taste characteristics.","JohnnyHopps","Aug 18, 2012"

It reminded more of macro domestic beers than any IPA I've ever smelled. It had a stronger malt character than I would expect from an IPA. The taste was off too. Strong malt and baked bread.

It tastes like herbal and citrusy (grapefruit) hops, along with some apricots, caramel and bready malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and smooth with moderate carbonation. I think this is a good overall brew, I'd buy a 6 pack of this the next time I come across it. It's a nice English IPA that I enjoyed.

Unappealing to me, but I know it doesn't bother some. Aroma is sweet, fruity, floral hops, toasted grain, and caramel malt. Tastes are similar to the aroma with some pine, apricot, and mango to boot; maybe a bit more bready.

Full bodied and coating on the tongue. Nice depth of flavors, plenty of sweet and then a soft yet quite drying finish. Full bodied and nicely flavorful.

Then it all blends to a grassy, citrus, and pine flavors that take over and lingers for several minutes. A medium bodied feel, staying consistent all the way through, never thinning out.

Overall drinkability is good for the most part; its light, smooth, and easy to drink. I dislike the lingering bitterness, but that fades as beer gets to the bottom.

That one really hits hard, right away. Nice strong malt flavor as well. Not dry at all. For an IPA, this has a pretty substantial malty flavor. Great texture on the tongue as well.

I smelled pine needles and a bit of hop initially, but I should have let it warm a bit before pouring. It was bitter tasting at first, with a touch of caramel, but it opened up quite a bit as it as the drink went on. I could taste the hop and a touch of citrus.

Taste is also dominated by the big citrus hops with mainly grapefruit in the taste, definitely bitter and hoppy in very nice way. The malt background balances everything nicely.

It is smooth in the mouth with some carbonation felt on the tongue. The bitterness is pleasant and lasts through the finish, but doesn't really linger after that. For an 8% ABV beer, the alcohol is not really noticeable, just a bit of warmth at the finish. The beer is tasty and well balanced.

Evocative hop aroma featuring some earthy English style notes and some elements, such as the tropical fruits, that seem derived from American hops. Juicy malts come up first on the palate. They are joined by juicy fruits of multiple sources: citrus, tropical, stone fruits. Bitterness grows at the mid-palate but crescendoes quickly, leading to a smooth, tea-bitterness-and-nutty-malts finish. That finish is long and active. Mouthfeel is pretty much perfect -- rounded, juicy, and brisk, but not over the top in any way.

Ample carbonation. Mouth feel is medium-light and comes across as light enough on the palate. A very nice beer - maltier than an American style IPA, yet not as malty as a typical English style.

Tons of small bubbles of carbonation were noticed, quickly rising up from the bottom of the glass. Smell: Strong aromas of grapefruit, orange peel, lemon zest, a nice bready yeast, and nice thick malt. Maybe a little bit peppery and spicy in the nose. I really enjoyed the nose more than the flavors but not too bad. Sweet malts, semi bitter hops, some citrus noted. A strong, almost overpowering grainy flavor in the finish.

Some excellent lacing was left behind. The aroma is fairly laid back for an IPA with this high of an alcohol content. Some citrus hop notes are present along with a bit of caramel. The flavor is lead by sweet malts, then some light hop bitterness. A touch of alcohol is noticable, but not overwhelming. The mouthfeel is slightly resiny with a good dose of carbonation.
