With the best before date April 16th, I don't think freshness is an issue. Perhaps I set the bar in my mind too high with the CAMRA award on the label. I wouldn't pick this up again but to each their own.","ludachris","Dec 12, 2014"

Yeah, the hoppiness here is more acrid and disjointed, instead of integrated and tantalizingly bitter, so I'm hardly emboldened to seek this out on cask, or any other format, really.","biboergosum","Dec 01, 2014"
