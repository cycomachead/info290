2.94,-24.2,3.75,2.75,2.75,3.5,3,"I havent had it in a few years and I was generally offended by almost any pale ale or IPA then so I decided to revisit. Still a drain pour. First one in a long time, but this was just completely undrinkable to me. Seriously wondering if something was wrong with it. Although I have only had 3 English IPAs and the highest rating is 3.5, so I may not be judging to style very well. It had a May best by date. Aroma is just awful. It smells and tastes like an old, bad lager. Overly sweet. Like artificial sweetner. No hops at all. Just, bad. The only good thing I can say about it besides it looked good is that it is now gone forever. Soemthing had to be wrong with this bottle, or me. GL couldn't make a beer that bad. Afraid to try again. Good Lord, someone get me a Burning River quick.","WesMantooth","Mar 25, 2015"
