4,11.7,3.25,3.75,4.25,4,4,"O: I would consider this on the milder side of an IPA.  Not too strong in hops, and very minimal on the malt. The look is not that appealing to me but I gave it leeway since it is unfiltered.  I would drink this again in spring and summer, specifically for the orangey/citrusy flavor.","lguy29","Feb 14, 2015"

3.53,-1.4,3.5,3,3.75,4,3.5,"Overall: it's not too great but not too bad. It's easily session able but lacks some ipa flavors I look for. It's a little empty in flavor and the smell is really nothing to get excited about. Maybe more of an apa than an ipa. Good for people trying to get into an ipa or those that don't like resiny hop flavors","PGD120","Jan 18, 2015"

3.97,10.9,3,4,4.25,3.75,3.75,"Not too hoppy for a hop-phobic. This relatively weak (for my latest taste standards) beer was a wonderful treat to alternate with Long Trail's much harsher "Double Bag". It offered a nice aroma and full flavor, and was even bearable un-chilled. Wish it was stronger, but I reccomend it just the same.","mmg4dance","Jan 13, 2015"
