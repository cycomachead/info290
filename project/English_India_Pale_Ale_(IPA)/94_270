3.78,5.6,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"sort of shocked i havent reviewed this one before, but real cool they are doing it in cans now. a twelver of these is a nice buy anytime, and maybe the beer is even better in this format. they call it an english style, but its definitely not over balanced by grain, and it definitely doesnt have a ton of english yeast character to it. for me its a nice fluffy bodied juicy hopped ipa, with tons of hops but only minimal bitterness. the kind of hoppy beer you want to drink on a hoppy beer hangover. that sounds bad, but its true, so cold and refreshing right from the can, a beer that is appealing anytime, and i think the world needs more of those. the hops are west coasty in nature, not overly oily, but prominently pine forward, with a fresh squeezed character to them. clean in the finish though, maybe the most refreshing english style ipa on the planet. good for long trail for making this one in a twelve pack of cans, it could be the best beer in that medium going right now. if i lived back home i would be crushing these this winter.","StonedTrippin","Dec 08, 2014"

3.5,-2.2,,,,,,"Once again, somebody filled a craft CAN to the brim, giving me a little spritz on the Crack! I went with an inverted Glug, especially since it is unfiltered and may need some rousing. This is precisely what #TheOldLady hates, but it did not say to pour gently. It settled into two-plus fingers of dense, eggshell-white head with great retention. What a difference from the earlier Saisons! Color was a cloudy Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 - 5). Nose smelled like the pine trees along The Long Trail! This really acted more like a bridge beetween an EIPA and an AIPA, but if you think that I am CANplaining, your are mistaken. Mouthfeel was medium. As it turns out, those were mostly aroma hops, so that the taste, while on the upper end of bitterness for an EIPA, was still more malty than hoppy. This made a nice segue from the Saisons and other Belgian-style beers earlier today into the hopped up beers that are on-deck. Finish was semi-dry with the hops ultimately winning out over the malts, but not by much. At 48 IBUs, this was not going to wreck anybody's palate.","woodychandler","Aug 19, 2014"

Smells of bread citrus and light caramel with a hint of fruity esters. Flavor is quite malty for an IPA with huge bread and caramel notes offset with just enough earthy hops to keep it from being too sweet. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet somewhat chalky mouthfeel. Middle of the road, old school, English inspired pale ale.","johnnnniee","May 10, 2014"

I bought a single bottle of it today and I will be putting this IPA on my "yes" list. When you first get a whiff of its aroma, you get a strong scent of pine and a lesser scent of fruit. I was quite leery of it upon smell, but quickly changed my mind after taking the first sip. It is not overpowering in the hoppy sense, but is nicely juxtaposed with an ever-so-light touch of citrus. This will become a favorite of mine, and will entice those generally opposed to IPAs to think differently and perhaps become a fan.","Leeshka410","Sep 26, 2013"

The beer is malty but the high ibu's and the pineniness give it a distinctive dry character that is great with Stilton cheese.

Aromas of cut grass, a subtle bitterness, and a light citrus blend. The nose is mild, overall. Flavors are a bit on the roasted side initially, but then the cedar themed hops come through, with some pepper and oregano spicing on the lateral tongue. Resiny and bitter, there is a hint of citrus blending that highlights throughout. The aftertaste is more of the bitter, resiny, oily hops, with a very green feel overall. Surprisingly quick finish, with a sharp charring and slightly drying feel. Bitter linger in the back of the throat. Decent brew, and light on the ABV compared to most IPAs, so this one won't get you in trouble as fast.","GarthDanielson","Apr 05, 2012"

Taste is not overly hopped but very bitter aftertaste lingers for a long (trail) time. As the beer warms is has a medicinal, cherry like flavor reminiscent of Shipyard IPA. I remember liking this a lot more in the past. It was always a great bargain at ten bucks a twelve pack. Obviously batch control is an issue and I would be hard pressed to purchase this again with so many better local IPA's to choose from.","Ilovesuds","Mar 24, 2012"

It has decent head retention, and there is some scattered lace left behind on the glass. The nose has some caramel maltiness and a nice hop presence. There are some aromas of tropical fruit and citrus here as well. The taste pretty much follows the nose. It starts off with some caramel malt and a nice citrusy and piney hop bite. There are some tropical fruit flavors that come through as well. The finish leaves some lingering sweetness and hop bitterness behind on the palate. This has a lighter medium body and average carbonation. It goes down easy and has a pretty good feel to it. There is some sweetness, and the hop bitterness is there, but a little on the lower side. This has good drinkability. It has nice flavor and goes down smooth. It is a little light on the hoppy side of things, but it is a pretty nice IPA overall.

The mouthfeel is saved by it being unfiltered cause it kinda has a thin body to it.

Very light bitterness, and also shows some yeasty character. Medium-bodied and carbed, I enjoyed a few of these while in Burlington for the weekend, but not sure I would actively seek this out.

The aroma had a stronger malt note than hops but it was also a bit skunky. The look and smell reminded me more of a macro pale lager. The taste was a tick better with a more malty sensation but little in the way of hops. Long Trail usually satisfies my beer thirst but based on the other reviews I have read I had to have had a bad bottle because this really had no IPA feel to it at all.

Not as much head as most IPAs, but still acceptable. Faint smell of hops and slightly fruity though no smells are particularly potent. So far so good. Unfortunately, the taste is where this starts to fall apart. Again, weak on the hops although oddly still bitter despite this. Perhaps there is not enough balancing with malts going on, but it's hard to tell. It does feel nice swirling around though. Overall, I wouldn't say this is very drinkable for me as the beer seems to be only bitter with not much else going on. What impresses me about many IPAs is the ability to pound you over the head with hops while balancing it out in some way so that it's not unpleasant. This is unpleasant with no balancing and not even that much hop flavor.","Blanco","Jul 21, 2010"

There was some sediment at the bottom of the bottle which I mistakenly poured into the glass, which made the beer mostly opaque. It has a straw color and a thick white head that leaves lace on the sides of the glass as it recedes to a skim of bubbles on the top of the beer. There is a mild hoppy aroma. The taste has a medium hoppy character, with some hop bitterness in the finish. There is mild to heavy carbonation and a light body that leaves your mouth feeling wet (as opposed to a dry finish). Overall, there doesn't seem to be much to this beer (especially compared to Long Trail's DIPA); I've had much better IPAs.

To my surprise Long Trail brews are now available in the Pittsburg market, and now my decision was split between the Harvest Brown Ale, IPA bottle on 8/4/08, their award winning hefe, or the elusive double bag strong ale. I was feeling hops and I'm glad I side with this one at just under 30 bucks that is quite a value. Pours a light bright slightly clouded orange hue. Head forms nice and thick depending on how vigorous you land it in the glass. Anyway a great collar of foam forms thick at the upper edge of my chalice while even lacing streaks a formed with each sip after. Aromatics provided herbal citrus and earthy notes. Upfront however is some grapfruit peel with soothing tea like edges, I love Nugget hops. Sweetness comes through as well, but no with the typical cloud of caramel this one has a much more clean biscuit light sweetness going on with some sugar coated hop action very nice. Flavor is mellow with hop bitterness but hop flavors like citrus peel and earthy herbal qualities flow throughout each sip. Moderate amount of dry bitterness finish is typical with really no malt sweetness in the end just citrus peel quality of the Nuggets. Balanced and more English/East Coast but it's so damn enjoyable who cares if it doesn't take a layer of enamel off of my teeth. Mouthfeel is solid crisp bitter hops and sweetness with a dry hop finish sticking around followed by welcoming hop burps. Drinkability, this brew is definitely case worthy I'm glad I decided to pick up a case blindly without thinking it's only rated a B on Beeradvocate. Damn good and a nice introduction to what I'm sure is a quality craft brewing company.","WVbeergeek","Aug 25, 2008"

Also seems like it has a lower ABV then advertised as it nothing to drink multiple LT IPA's. Lately been drinking Smuttynose IPA, possibly I contribute the somewhat bland flavor of the LT IPA and over all weak feeling ABV due to my overexposure to Smutty.

This is a fairly clear, light amber color, maybe a little off-yellow. It is medium bodied with some head, retention and lacing. The smell is the high point with a nice hoppy pine smell and oily esters. The taste does not live up to the very aromatic smell in that there is a malty sweetness and a weak hoppiness for an IPA. There really isn't enough going on in this beer to draw much interest, but the aftertaste is mild and the mouthfeel is inoffensive. Other than the relative hoppiness, which came as a nice change up, in comparison with the other beers in the variety pack, this one is decent but uneventful.","albern","Aug 30, 2007"

Good balance of maltiness and hoppiness. The flavor of the malt, in addition to the lack of an over-the-top hop aroma, lets me know this is an English IPA as opposed to an American one. Lately I've been in the mood for English style IPAs, so this one is a welcome addition to my current "go-to" beers. I find it pleasant and quite drinkable.","Calico","Jul 29, 2007"

Theres a decent malt backbone here but the hops, predominantly floral, run the show from start to finish. The malts do make a valiant attempt to come to the forefront at the finish but are stubborny turned back by the hops. Mouthfeel is pretty good. Nice medium body with a moderate amount of carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good. At this abv and with this balance I can confidently call this a good session brew.

Oily hops dominate the aroma, with some apple rind as well as a slight mustyness in the background. A good dosage of fruit hits the palate first, followed by the hops, which seemed a bit more accentuated in the smell, but still nowhere near being weak. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, making it a very nice session brew. I don't get a chance to try nearly enough English IPA's, so im definitely glad i picked this one up.

I found it to leave the mouth feeling refreshed and quenched. It was highly drinkable. The only reason it was not a "5" was that the yeast flavor became a bit strong as the drink neared the end, but that was to be expected because it was not filtered.

The head is sticky frothy with giant bubbles throughout. The nose of this brew is suttle faint grape, grassy essence, followed by a hint of morning dew and flowers after a heavy rain. The taste is average, it starts bitter on the palate then moves to a slight watery sweetness like the juice of a melon and finishes with a lemon rind bitterness. Overall decent brew, I guess on tap from the brewery is far superior so I'll have to try and update my review. I paired this beer with a grilled sirlion, baked then grilled sweet potatoe and sweet peas....the earthy flavors in the IPA paired nicely with steak and the rustic flavors in the sweet potatoe.","Franchise","Mar 05, 2006"

As I was soon to find out, the lace trail left behind was fantastic. The nose is out of this world, the freshness of it can just drive you crazy. The hoppiness is pronounced, but its the unbelievable freshness of those hops that's undescribable. While it displays a medium body, the hop explosion on the palate is unavoidable. Grapefruit and citrus notes blend well with the bread-like freshness (there's that word again!). The "straight out of the brew kettle" feel that it gives you is literally tangible. The finish is puckering and slightly dry, but not overwhelmingly. There's just enough of a lemon kick to remind you who's boss. Outstanding!","Hhawk06","Feb 17, 2006"

Taste is reasonably well-balanced, the scale tipped lightly towards the sedate hopping, as one might expect from an English-style IPA. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean, and drinkability is very nice.

A few earthy hop tones but nothing pronounced and much less robust than I expect from an IPA. The taste went along with the smell, nothing jumped out. Not malty but also almost no hop flavor. This beer seems more of a standard English Bitter than an IPA. Light hop notes and not sweet, but in no way an IPA. The mouthfeel was average as was the drinkability.

The hops do not realy come out until the aftertaste. Mouth feel is medium bodied and is generously carbonated. It goes down easy, as this is not an in your face IPA.

Very interesting in how this happens. When looking at specs, Pale ale and IPA have an overlap between high and low of the IBU's. This beer sits in that range, which appeals to me as a Pale Ale fan.
