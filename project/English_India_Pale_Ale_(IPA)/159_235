I would get this again and I imagine it would be really nice served as a proper pint at the pub.","dbrauneis","Jun 11, 2013"

2.07,-42,2.75,2.5,1.5,3,2,"Immediately upon first sip there is something wrong. No hops actually you fall in debt to the hop municipal credit union...negative acceptable amounts of hops despite hops being the foundation of IPA. Sweet flower no bitter despite the decent 7.5 abv you wouldn't know. Don't buy despite one of the coolest bottles ever.","JLapadura","Mar 28, 2013"
