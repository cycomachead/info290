It pours a clear amber colour and white head that quickly dissipates. The bottle I poured it from (into glass of course) had a spider Web effect of bubbles inside that I don't see to often so I expected some lacing on the mug. Very hoppy aroma had me assuming that it would taste like a U.S. west coast IPA but I was surprised that the hoppiness didn't come across strong in the taste. Earthy, grassy, slighty citrus has me loving this beer. Goes down smooth, real nice.","vikinggary28","Feb 07, 2015"

3.55,-3.3,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.25,"Overall, this was a nicely authentic English IPA.  We haven’t had one in a while, but still felt it a little light in flavoring.  It was hard to separate brewer’s intent and drive for authenticity from presentation at this particular establishment.  We never found it to be skunky, per se, but it did have that dingy English pub vibe through and through.  The hopping was there, and surprisingly piney, while the malts were washed and simplistic, but clean in their body.  This was enjoyed in the company of new friends who we had been meeting here, and it served its purpose as a nicely sociable, approachable beverage, without becoming overwhelming time-consuming or attention-diverting.","TheBrewo","Jan 24, 2015"
