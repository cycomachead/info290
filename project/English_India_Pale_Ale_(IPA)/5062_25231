Flavor is well meshed subdued hop bitterness with complex malt base orange fruit acidity from the alpha acids complement each other so well. Perfect hybrid aggressive hop flavors with complex malts still quite English in nature this is a must try IPA from across the pond.

This IPA is not bad, but it is somewhat harsh, overly brash, and aggressive. It is definitely not the most drinkable example of the style.

4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"one of the odd examples of an English ipa that tastes more like an American ipa, usually its the other way around, but this one is hop heavy without all the caramel malt sweetness. the pour has a nice reddish color to it, fairly hazy, with a few fingers of lasting khaki foam. the nose is big bold woody oily American hops, centennial maybe, maybe something else high alpha, but this has a real hop forwardness to it. the malts aren't really sweet at all, just biscuity in a supporting role. the flavor agrees with the smell, hops all the way. there is a nice citrus element to it, orange peel and a lot of bitterness in the finish. the alcohol is well hidden in taste, but you can certainly feel a big bottle of this. the yeast imparts an almost Belgian brightness to the mouthfeel. its effervescently carbonated, which is nice in a big ipa for once, and the body is fuller than medium but not filling or weighty. overall this is an exemplary beer, a whole lot better than meantimes coffee porter, and one that's actually pretty fairly priced at under 13 bucks for a 750ml. its worth all of that, a real treat where I honestly least expected it.","StonedTrippin","Mar 21, 2013"

Aromas of orange, grape, pear, caramel, biscuit, herbal, floral, honey, toast, and earth. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of orange zest, grapefruit, pear, caramel, grape, herbal, floral, biscuit, toast, honey, and light earthiness. Light amount of earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, light fruit, caramel, herbal, floral, biscuit, toast, and light earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor balance and complexity; with a great bitterness/sweetness balance as well. No cloying sweetness at all after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy, lightly slick, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish.

Thick ever so just off white two inch head with some decent beading. Light, clean and lightish yet persistent with an understated melon to martini like bitterness which makes for a very satisfying mouthfeel. Very classy. Doesn't drink anything like a 7.4% ABV beer. Probably the most sophisticated IPA I have ever had. Could imagine splitting a bottle of this poolside with Cary Grant. While chatting up Grace Kelly.","Zimbo","Jan 26, 2012"
4.05,4.1,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Picked this up at Bert's Bierhuis in Utrect, The Netherlands. Slightly hazy amber-yellow pour with two finger head with nice retention and lacing. The nose is pretty much dominated with sweet caramel malt that plays well with the fruitiness. With that said, it's not your typical West Coast citrus bomb, but more mangoes, apricots, and tangerines with hints of bread and grass and just a touch of pine. The malt dominates the taste initially with tons of sweet caramel and toffee. But as it warms, the bitter hop bite comes into play to balance this one out to perfection. Hints of orange zest, biscuit, tea, and toast with just a touch of pine. The mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and sweet to start, but yields to a subtle tangy, bitter finish. At 7.5%, it's a little stronger than the typical English IPA, but you don't notice it and this is oh so drinkable. A really nice example of the style and my first, but not last, taste of Meantime!","beerdrifter","Jan 24, 2012"

But this beer redeems itself in flavor. Nicely balanced between citrus, floral, and herbal hop elements and soothing bready malt. Bitterness is appropriate for the style. Finishes with a little herbal aftertaste. Nice body but I would like to see a little more substance especially when the ABV is at 7.5%. Nicely carbonated. Too expensive to be a regular in my lineup.

There is all the makings of a sweetish Belgian beer, with its sweet florals and syrupy texture, then you get some hop acerbicness and some drying notes, maybe some hop leaf notes, and then you get the syrupy ABV presence in the mouth and throat.

Warm glow to the fat sunset orange color, as much light brown mixed in as yellow, moderate transparency. Excellent clarity to the nose with spacing among the pine oil, grapefruit and orange citrus, daisies and other wildflowers, green apple and pear fruit, golden honey and sweet tea scents. Close to full-bodied, here it is more compact and woven into a unified whole. The carbonation level is excellent and carries the flavors while allowing the palate to enjoy the array of textures. On the sweet side of the spectrum, emphasizing pink grapefruit, tangerine, lime citrus, honey and flaky pastry dough. The malt flavor is there, smoothing influence too, but it does not reach the level of chocolate or caramel found in other beers. Light clove and cinnamon spice break through near the end as well as dried oat cereal. Very clean finish with tempting aftertaste and weight echoes across the tongue.","farrago","Feb 02, 2009"

Nice aroma, fruity esters, caramel malts, and floral/grassy hops with notes of citrus. Good flavour too, with oranges and biscuity malts up front, grassy and herbal hops, balanced bitterness, and a bit of alcohol in the finish. More caramel appeared in the malt profile as it warmed, along with orange peel and cake. Medium bodied, seemed like the attenuation was on the low side due to a bit of a sugary mouthfeel, well integrated carbonation, light alcohol warmth and spiciness. This stuff is quite tasty and very easy to drink, plus the balance is great. Definitely something I'd grab again.","DrJay","Jul 31, 2008"

Sweet caramel taste, some tangerine, a hint of pine, a hint of the alcohol creeps in, but it's nice. Creamy, active little bubbles, very slight lingering hoppy bitterness...it's there, and you know you've been drinking an IPA, but definitely this is a nice change of pace from the hoppier beers I'm so fond of.

The aroma is sweet malt and citrusy hops, a lot fainter than what I expected from an IPA. The taste has to be one of the sweetest IPAs I have tasted, almost a honey like sweetness with some hops in the finish. I am not a huge fan of this beer because of the high amount of sweetness. If it was a little less sweet, I think it would be a great brew, I think the hop profile is pretty solid.","cjgator3","0"

This is supposed to be made true tot he original style which was loaded with hops but I didn't think it was that hoppy. Some orangey hoppiness seemed to be the main flavor, a flavor I have detected in some other IPA's but I expected a bit more sharp hops here.

Tastes citrusy (grapefruit, orange), grassy, sweet, with some caramel. Full, rich body, though not viscous by any means. Moderate carbonation, enough to leave a semi-clean finish. Wow, very tasty and dangerously drinkable. Far and away the very best example of the style (English IPA) that I have ever encountered. One of the best IPAs of any kind I've had.

I was not so impress with the taste or mouthfeel. Medium body with a toffee sweet beginning that faded out quicky, leaving a light alcoholic and soft carbonation feel.

Kind of strange, and reminds me more of a cross between a belgian and an american style IPA. Very interesting beer and very very refreshing. good beer from meantime.

The beer pours a golden copper, very hazy with a thick foamy head that lingers. The label warms of a slight haze, and I am certainly not disappointed. The aroma is sharp resiny, piney and herbal hops with a light background of pale malts. Malt sweetness and hop flavor, mostly citrus and pine, appear in the flavor up front. This is followed by a strong, assertive bitterness. I think the beer could use just a bit more malt sweetness to balance the bitterness. I'm curious how true this beer is to 1820's IPA's.

Malty and sweet upfront moving towards a grassy, herbal hop bite mid-palate and finishing lightly bitter with some lingering fruitiness akin to fuzzy-skinned fruits like apricot and peach. Carbonation is pretty subtle, but ample. Mouthfeel is about average with a good amount of malt to give it a good body. Very drinkable and fresh tasting.

This is an interesting interpretation of style, fitting neither the American nor British stereotypes.

The taste starts with that malt flavor, that gradually gives to grapefruit bitterness of the hops that lingers on the palate. a heavier fell than what one would expect, the feel of skim milk, maybe a bad example, but it does have some weight.

It is medium and smooth on the palate with flavors of perfumy/citric hops, soap, the same tart melon rind character, yeast, and a good bitterness that is there to let you know it's an IPA without ruining your palate.

Having a wire cage and cork added to the overall refinement of the packaging. As the beer relinquished the confinement to the appointed Imperial Pint glass, the color looked golden amber, the body slightly hazy, carbonation ample, and head well proportioned at two-finger thick. The appearance was pretty spot on for an IPA from either side of the Atlantic, while the smell was that of signature English hops. The restrained spiciness, and full on earthiness of the hops could not be mistaken for anything but Fuggles & Golding. The taste indicated that the hops had been added in amounts typically absent from the beers brewed over there. It wasnt overly bitter, but it was certainly spicy and snappy. There was also a good deal of citric acidity that makes the American versions of the style so quaffable. The very cohesive flavor profile set off fireworks in my mouth with each sip. The body was medium thick and carbonation soft and creamy, i.e., the typical IPA mouthfeel that makes me long for the next sip. Aftertaste was long drawn out and citric.

Taste is also cask-like to my tastebuds, with sedate grains giving way to ample lightly fruity hoppiness, more than what the style classification would lead you to expect.

4.2,8,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4," The mouthfeel is slightly carbonated, and very smooth. The drinkability is good, owing to the low ABV and balanced, mild flavor. I would buy this again if it were cheaper.","Sephiroth","Aug 30, 2005"
