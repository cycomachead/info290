3.47,2.7,4,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark bronze color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of light hops, some floral notes. Taste is lightly hopped, a strong malt backbone, some mild citrus. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a bit light on hops for the style, but highly drinkable and enjoyable.","tone77","May 29, 2014"
