3.87,9,4,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"Probably not a good way to start, but I bought this beer on clearance. $0.98 per bottle a couple months after Christmas.  Going to stock up after tasting it.  Bad Elf pours a very interesting orange color and smell and taste are both bright and floral.  I appreciate this IPA for being less hop and citrus and more spice and rose.  I found it quite interesting and fun to drink.  Perhaps it's the season getting ready to change, but the beer speaks more of springtime than Christmas to me, although I suppose the spice may come through nicely during the Holidays.  Overall a unique an easy drinking brew, loved it.","Foxybrau","Jan 20, 2015"

3.7,4.2,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.25,3.75,"Overall / Drinkability:  Not an amazing beer, but definitely one that works to be drank in a full pint.  Any less and I think I would have missed something.  Works very nicely with food (cabbage and noodles).  I would not mind another small serving but I don't think I would want another full bottle.","damndirtyape","Dec 25, 2014"
