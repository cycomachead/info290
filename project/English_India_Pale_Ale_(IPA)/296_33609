3.73,10.7,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"o: A good British-style IPA which probably was not as fresh as it could be, thus little in the way of hop bite.  The slight sharp tartness is assumed to be from age.","scotorum","Jan 31, 2015"

3,-11,,,,,,"O: I get the feeling this bottle's probably seen some shit, green bottle not helping things, but still, it's pretty rough overall. Neither the hops nor the malt give the impression that even in peak condition this would be much better. Not a fan of this one.","RyanK252","Oct 06, 2014"

4.25,26.1,,,,,,"O: Drinks more like a double IPA, albeit without the American hops, and only 5.5%. Very nice. I'm yet to have a bad one from this brewery. It's like a lighter version of Yorkshire Stingo. I think some of the other reviewers have been drinking old bottles.","Hoppsbabo","Sep 21, 2014"

3.25,-3.6,,,,,,"Fine, but surprisingly uninteresting beer from this top-grade brewer. Lacks sharpness and intrigue of more floral/American hops. Tastes like standard pub draught fare.","mick_cooper",
