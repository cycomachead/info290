2.81,-4.1,2.25,2.5,3,2.75,3,"O: A lot of lager qualities in this one, light, crisp, etc.  Sort of like a lager gone slightly ipa-ish.  It does have some interesting fruity and hop qualities, just very light on them even for the style.  Found and drank in Bangkok, March 1st, 2015.","patre_tim","Apr 08, 2014"
