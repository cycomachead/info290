IPAs are one of my favorite styles and this has got to be the worst one I've had. This had a dark brown body, a little heavy, with a fairy thick head and a decent amount of lace. The color looks nothing like an IPA. Hops? Hardly any. Are they sure they put the right label on this? Wow. Somewhat smooth, but not a fan of the flavor at all. A scotchy malt flavor is the best way I can describe it. Or a mild version of their Scotch Ale, which I found disgusting.

No hop aroma at all, which is surprising for even an english IPA. Flavor is lots of british malts and some caramel in the background. Very little hop bitterness.

Darker and richer in malts than expect, but it works well. Barely hopped for balance though. Almost misses even a pale ale mark with it's lack of hops. The hop character never offers much stand-alone character, and contributes only a slight earthy, woodsy flavor. Slightly over weighted in the body than I prefer and with a sweeter / maltier finish than expected. Good beer, but not a classic IPA.","BEERchitect","Jul 14, 2006"

I was a little disappointed since this IPA doesn't really taste like an IPA (and because I'm a poor college student, the cost of $10.34 hurt). I can barely taste any hops yet it is a surprisingly dark red amber. It is a bit watery and thin for the style as well, but it is not without its character. Practically no lacing, but at least some head remains on the top till the end. Smell is so-so.. (certainly not bad) but it just smells malty. Tastes somewhat undercarbonated but mouthfeel is still fair. Probably the highest element of this beer is that it is very drinkable; it is an overall pleasant beer that doesn't fill you up as much even when compared to some other IPAs. It was NOT what I expected but it is still worth a shot.","Bigjay1584","Mar 02, 2006"

If reviewed as to style, the marks would be low, but I've decided to rate it on its own merits, even though it is not an IPA. I think this is a fairly drinkable beer, it tastes fairly good. I don't think I'd search for this one, but I don't mind it one bit. Definitely worth a try as long as you don't care that it isn't to style.","Drew966","Feb 25, 2006"

Definitly does not taste like an india pale ale at all. Reminds more of Newcastle or Tanner's Jack. Sweet roasted malts and nutty flavors. It does taste decent, just way off track.

Its not an intense aroma, and certainly nothing like an American IPA. Moderate sweetness and roasted malt flavors up front.

Completely lacking in the typical sharp hoppiness of an IPA, this resembles more of a red ale. Mellow malt flavor is tempered by a light fruity character from the hops.

3.43,17.1,3.5,3,3.5,3,4,"This is a nice beer to drink when your sitting around with your buds. Sure, it's not as good as the Scotch Ale by McEwans, but it has it's highlights. First off, it's not a too heavy beer. Tastes like a very light coffee. It's got just the right amount of bitterness to it, but that's not too much. The taste finishes off smooth and goes down easy. Give it a shot, you'll be glad you did.","JISurfer","Jan 10, 2003"
2.88,-1.7,3,2.5,2.5,3,4,"Drinkability & Notes: Quite drinkable, it actually goes down real easy like a light ale would. Sad thing is this is not labeled as a light ale, labeled as an IPA makes this beer somewhat of a sham. I have had pale ales that are bigger than this! At $9 a six-pack don’t waste your dough.","Jason","Nov 25, 2002"
2.26,-22.9,3,2,2,3,2.5,"I'm sorry but this is not an IPA as they claim on the bottle.....Maybe an English Mild or sweeter ESB but not an IPA...The aroma is malty with no hops evident...the taste is biscuity and bready...no hop's evident except for a dryish finish...It's not a bad beer, but for an IPA it's way below average...","ZAP","Nov 19, 2002"
2.95,0.7,3,3,3,2.5,3,"The beer pours crystal clear deep amber to burnished copper color, the head minimal, the lace in spindly sheets, and they both disappear much to quickly for my liking. Nose is all malt, light hints of caramel, clean and fresh at any rate. Front is sweet and malt laden the top skinny, the finish has a big acidic bite, the hops are light, and under stated as are most non-American IPAs. Please dont misunderstand, as this is not meant to be a criticism, as I like the complex flavors and bodies in these IPAs and ales for that matter. Overall, this beer is a bit bland and watery, at least for me.","Gusler","Nov 17, 2002"
3.03,3.4,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Deep clear copper color.  Very little head.  Just a collaring.  More malt than hops on the nose.  The malt flavors are caramel and biscuit like.  The hop profile is primarily perfumey, but also slightly herbal.  Bitterness factor is very low, which drops my taste rating significantly.  There's a dry woody aspect that I usually don't encounter in IPAs.  This is a good tasting beer, but it doesn't seem like an IPA to me.  More like a PA or Bitter.","Bighuge","Nov 11, 2002"
3,2.4,3,3,3,3,3,"Pours a clear light brown with a little amber and a modest white head that dissipates fairly quickly, yet leaves a lace down the glass.  The smell is not nearly as pronounced as other IPA's that I've had, nor did the look go with it either.  The smell is that of a musty bitter with not much else.  Tasting this, I know this is not an IPA at all.  It doesn't taste bad, but doesn't fit the label.  Very mild and kind of bland (maybe because I was expecting an IPA), slightly malty taste with a hint of roast and a moderate hoppy bitterness.  It has an almost watery mouthfeel and finishes semi-dry.  Like I say, not bad, but NOT an IPA.  Average across the board...if you take the IPA off of it.  Cheers!","BeerAngel","Oct 11, 2002"
3.55,21.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"McEwan's shouldn't really be labeled an IPA, but more of an English mild. It pours a pretty deep amber with a short-lived head that at least looks good when it's there. The smell is rather biscuity, with almost no hop profile present. The taste features more of that biscuity profile with some caramel malt making itself known, as well. This a pretty smooth drinker, and would make a decent session beer. It's not really worth overanalyzing, but it's a keeper in its own regard.","Jon","Sep 28, 2002"
3.3,12.6,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"certainly not an IPA....dark copper in color with a minmal head and no lacing.  light toasted malt aroma, a hint of hops.  smooth and creamy moutfeel, albeit a little thin.  nice bready caramel malt taste...very drinkable.  nothing special and could be considered and average to slightly above average ale.  to pass it off as an IPA is wrong though.  would be a nice session brew as there isn't too much to offend.","budgood1","Aug 25, 2002"
2.06,-29.7,3,2,2,2,2,"IMO this is far from an IPA, where are the hops??  About the only way it resembles an IPA is the appearance.  I was very dissapointed in this beer and recommend it to Bud drinkers becasue it is that bad...........CHEERS","tigerpaws","Aug 14, 2002"
3.64,24.2,3,4,3.5,3,4,"Amber in color, with an off-dry malty nose, this beer has a short, dry malt aftertaste with some sweetness at the end. Not very typical for your average IPA.","stoutman","May 22, 2002"
2.5,-14.7,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Buttery, oily, caramelly, malty and sweet, not bitter, just sweet, therefore it doesn't really resemble an IPA, and doesn't appeal with my tatses, needs bitterness.","rastaman","May 21, 2002"
3.66,24.9,4,3,4,4,3.5,"Dark and clear amber.  Very little smell.  Head is thin and dissappears into large bubbles at the edge. Mouthfeel is pretty dense for an I.P.A., hops are assertive but not at all explosive -- mildly peppery/clovey.  Malt taste is definitely there and helps add to the body and impression.  Pretty good but very different from an American I.P.A.... I, personally, like a little more hops.","ADR","Mar 28, 2002"
5,70.6,5,5,5,5,5,"The first time I drank this I was shocked - I expected a hoppy - rip your face off - IPA.  It isn't anything like that - smooth, mellow and is the best IPA I have found anywhere.  The ABV is 4.5%.","jdhilt","Mar 15, 2002"
3.4,16,3,3,4,3,3,"This beer was formerly known as McEwan's Export Ale. Only the name has been changed to protect the ignorant.","John","Oct 19, 2001"
2.45,-16.4,3.5,3.5,2,2,2,"Notes: An unusual IPA. First, it's Scottish. Second, it taste nothing like a traditional IPA and holds none of the characteristics that you might expect (big malts and big hops to balance). I'll pass on this one. Not to style and a rather bland brew.","Todd","Jul 06, 2001"
