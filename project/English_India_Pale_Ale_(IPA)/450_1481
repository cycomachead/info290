2.99,-20.5,2.75,3,3,3,3,"Poured into a standard pint glass. Clear golden/bronze color. Less than a finger of head that disappears and has some light lacing. Smells hoppy and almost a little soapy. Taste is Bol and hoppy. A little sour but in a good way. Some grapefruit rind and maybe a little coriander. Dry after taste but very hoppy finish, almost too hoppy. The after taste is a bit too assertive. Medium mouthfeel, good carbonation. Solid beer, doesn't move the needle too much though.","MTLDOG","Feb 05, 2015"

3.47,-7.7,3.25,3,3.75,3.5,3.5,"This was served to me on tap in a standard pint glass.  Poured a very dark copper with nearly no head and minimal lacing.  faint hops aroma with s gentle, mildly hoppy taste.  Mouthfeel was adequate, and that's overall what I consider this IPA to be: an adequate, drinkable beer, about on par with Sam Adams Rebel.","Doctor_Bogenbroom","Jan 18, 2015"
