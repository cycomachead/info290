At least that almost allows me another can of Deuchars, which I am just about ready for. Let me go on record as saying this: this beer is better in bottle, and it must be a dream on cask, but it is so good that (unlike most other UK offerings) even the dreaded pasteurized, preservative ridden can can't ruin it.","biegaman","Jul 15, 2009"
3.42,-10,3,3.5,3,4,4,"At first glance, this beer doesn't seem like much of an IPA. Neither the 4.4% ABV or pale golden colour are giving me much confidence in the beer, though I haven't had many IPAs from the UK. The smell definitely gave of a nice presence of light hops. The first sips showed some solid promise... I picked out some light floral/citrus hops and a bit of malt to balance things out. I found soon after though that while the flavour is good, there just wasn't enough of it. Given the lower alcohol, this brew had a pretty nice flavour but it was too light and not quite what I'm looking for in an IPA, though it would make a fine session beer. Having mostly been exposed to American IPAs, I would like to try a few more British ones to see how they compare.","notdan","Jul 11, 2009"
3.72,-2.1,3,3.5,4,4,3.5,"From Scotland. Pours a bit flat. I'm drinking this a bit below room temperature. Has a pleasant smell of butterscotch, vanilla and an ever so ghostly waft of strawberry.

I quite like it nonetheless and is perfect for this crisp October afternoon.","shamus","Jul 09, 2009"

Very enticing citrus and floral nose, with the emphasis on carantion. The mouth is mildly carbonated and surprisingly light. The taste brings a great deal to the table, including a minty note along with the flowers and the fruit.

4.12,8.4,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a deep, clear golden with a perfect fluffy head at nearly room temperature. Aroma is just the right combination of mild toffee malt and tangy woody hops, and it carries over into the flavour. Mouthfeel is just great, and accentuates the balanced, oily hop flavour of this IPA. Very little aftertaste compared to other IPAs and, as others have said, you could drink this all day long. A great cask session ale.","crwills","Jul 01, 2007"
2.53,-33.4,3,2.5,2,2.5,3.5,"Maybe Ive been having too many Imperial IPAs lately, but this IPA struck me as more of a pale ale or even a bitter than anything else. It has a golden ale color, and a moderate head with a soapy appearance. The aroma is very lightly hoppy and a little herby. The body is thin, and the taste reminds me of a mild bitter with some subtle pepper notes. Not much malt character to this one at all. A refreshment beer much more so than a sipping beer, and its only a so-so one at that.","Flyer","Jun 04, 2007"
4.13,8.7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"D - Extremenly drinkable and due to fairly common availability in Glasgow one of my beers of choice when drinking in pubs.

4.17,9.7,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"This is a must find. I drink it whenever I have a chance. It is a great example of a session beer. You can enjoy this beer all afternoon and evening long. I occassionally spot this on cask in the Midlands and in London, but it was terrible at the William Wallace in London. They obvously were taking care of their beers. Find this in a good pub though and you will enjoy a great beer. As they say...You are Due a Deuchars!","cichief","Feb 18, 2007"

This is highly drinkable and is a good all night beer as it is a very reasonable 4.4% abv, (in Scotland it is anyway, maybe the exported stuff is different). A very good beer, in fact most drinks from the Caledonian brewery are worth a try.","kmacphail","Sep 07, 2006"

4.21,10.8,5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"M&D: this beer on draught is distinctive from the bottled version, with a less aromatic profile, and somewhat less malty, but the lively and delicately bitter texture makes it an incredibly drinkable bitter-hoppy ale... Fresh and subtle on the mouthfeel, as a true real ale on form should be, superbly balanced... In fact, it's more like a cup of good quality Taiwanese high-mountain green tea if I may~~","wl0307","Jun 26, 2006"

Taste started a bit malty with a citrus hop finish. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and had a very nice smooth finish. At 4.4 abv this brew was extremely sessionable and pretty smackable to boot.

4.23,11.3,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5," Moderate hop bitterness by American IPA standards, but eminently more balanced in my opinion. I don't generally like IPAs and avoided this brew for most of the time I was in Scotland in favor of the wealth of Scottish style ales, but once I actually tried this ale I loved it. It would probably be considered a Pale Ale by our hop-crazed standards. The room temp serving brings out the hop flavor complexity, which is quite nice without over the top bitterness. In fact it is supremely well balanced with a wide variety of hop characteristics working together with a flavor malt backbone that is still detectable. Scotlands ubiquitous cask ale (even the airport, where I got my final fix).","Shovelbum","Mar 14, 2006"

In fact, such is its popularity that the Caledonian Deuchars IPA is now a regular beer at the Grove Inn, Leeds it seems. When on form, this really does take some beating from the Cask.","TheLongBeachBum","May 22, 2005"

3.73,-1.8,3.5,3,4,4,4,"I am still new at this and was suprised that pouring this beer resulted in a pale, gold beer with a milky white head. I thought IPAs were darker, this looked more like a pils to me. The head left excellent lacing. Aroma was mildly hoppy and the taste is quite nice, balanced between the malty body and hop finish. A very good session brew I am sure.","SaunaKing","Oct 30, 2004"

Aromas of floral hopping over sweet bready malts. Front is delicate with creamy sweet malts in balance with grassy-floral hops...light body, very smooth and mellow...finish is clean with a drying by the hops. A very refreshing light IPA...a very pleasnt way to slack a thirst on a warm day. I would recommend this IPA to both dry ale fanciers and light ale fanciers alike.","pootz","Sep 16, 2004"

The taste had a fruity characterisic, definitly grapefruit, at the start with agood sharp hop bite and a clean crisp finish. Previous tastes of English IPA's (Imported in bottles to the USA) led me to belive the the British did'nt like to use hops for amoma or flavor (not just bitterness). This ale proved me wrong. Hopefully if I get to try the bottled import I will not be disappointed.","ybnorml","Jun 27, 2004"
3.88,2.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This IPA poured a slightly hazy golden color with thin white foam. The smell was modest: malty with a touch of hops. The taste was malty with a very low hoppiness. This has to be one of the least hoppy IPAs that I have tasted (it is listed as 36 IBU, but I find that hard to believe). The finish was slightly bitter and hoppy. The mouthfeel was clean and smooth with medium-light body and low carbonation. The light bitterness lingered a bit. A decent brew, though quite low in hops.","UncleJimbo","May 16, 2004"
4.29,12.9,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Sunrise golden orange color, mild haze and a thin lace to boot. Tons of delicate hop oil aroma and flavor, suggestions of ripe pear and golden raisin come to mind. Light dough malt in the back with a mild bitterness to balance ... there seems to be more hop flavor than bitterness is provides a perfect base for such a tasty brew. Certainly not an IPA by any means ... regardless this is a great cask ale.","Jason","Apr 29, 2004"
3.6,-5.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Hand-pulled cask at Prince of Wales in London. Dark golden orange color with a minimal off-white head and almost no lacing. Aroma of toned down hops along with some fruit.

Pretty good offering from Caledonian.","Dogbrick","Apr 15, 2004"

The aromas are of FRESH, juciy hops, and floral light malts. The taste is lovely. It's quite hoppy and a bit malty, but I would not call this an IPA, i'd call it a regular pale ale.

Taste is very hoppy, citrus zest and puckering bitterness at the end. Very lightly toasted malt flavors lie way underneath. Hop bitterness is present but not overwhelming like an American IPA. Moderate carbonation and crisp hop bitterness make it very refreshing and easy to drink. Very crisp and dry, cleansing the palate with every gulp. I had this one with citrus stuffed mini chickens (cornish game hens) and it went very well. This version of an IPA was more subtle, very drinkable, and very refreshing. Worth a try.","StevieW","Sep 23, 2003"

Slight skunk scent at first but fresh, grassy British hop aromas take over. Clean, light malt flavor with some fruity apple notes. Body is light, and quickly loses balance as the hops take charge and flood the mouth with great piney, earthy flavors and chewy finish. Not quite enough malt body ( or alcohol) to balance the hoppy presence for an IPA IMHO but a very tasty session beer for the hop lover.","Shiredave","Mar 01, 2003"
