3.84,8.5,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"This very unfiltered beer ends up quite hazy in the glass with a dull copper color and an off white head that laces nicely.  The smell is dominated by light floral and grassy hop notes with a base of crystal and biscuit malt.  While on the tip of the tongue, caramels and biscuity malt shine through but are quickly replaced by a strong bitter character that doesn't come with much in the way of hop flavor other than perhaps some floral spice.  At the finish this is quite puckeringly bitter which lingers nicely inviting the next sip.  Moderate to high carbonation and the lack of an overly sweet malt character make this lively in the mouth.  Overall this is a pretty good English IPA, quite different from the more common American style that we've all grown so accustomed to.  It is nice to get a taste of something a little different like this every once in a while to remind you how IPAs started out.","fank2788","Dec 12, 2014"
