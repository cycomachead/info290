3.59,-10.7,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Bottle. Golden, clear with nice thick, medium, white head. Good lacing. Average lasting. Starts with nice malty character, nice medium citrus zesty aroma, touch of tropical fruits. Light to medium bitter, orange peel, grapefruit, light resing flavours. Almost medium bodied, smooth, lively carbonation semi-dry. Finish is bittersweet. Very refreshing beer. Nice, well balanced, refreshing an very drinkable IPA. Solid.","BlazerT","Dec 31, 2014"
