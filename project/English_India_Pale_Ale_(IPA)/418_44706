4,12,4,4,4,4,4,"Another solid offering from Left Hand, who is quickly moving up the ladder for me.  This is an IPA, but it's a bit maltier and less bitter than traditional ones, so that's why I liked it more than anticipated.  I'm not sure if others may have gotten a bad batch, because I really didn't get the sour or bitter taste or the foul aroma that some reviews have described.  I've never had this issue with Left Hand, so I'm definitely surprised that some have reviewed this beer so harshly.","dcscientist","Mar 27, 2015"
