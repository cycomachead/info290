3.74,5.4,4,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Look- nice, golden brown IPA.. Solid head that dissipates after a bit.. Lacing covers throughout, good looking. Smell- nice, pine, a bit typical for the style. Taste- good, you pick up the floral notes.. More bitter than my favorite IPAs.. Strangely, comes off a tiny bit watered down toward the end of the glass. Feel- a bit of a dry finish. A good, not great IPA.","Antc2382","Jan 27, 2015"
