3.75,-1.3,,,,,,"I've tried to love this beer for many years just because it was one of my first local beers.  I had the cask conditioned version last night at Clark's ale house and my mind hasn't changed, this is just a run of the mill IPA.  The Late Knight DIPA is amazing and I wish they would change the recipe and kick this single IPA up a bit.  There are so many good IPAs available in the CNY area now and its hard to pick this on a menu","Dwkasper","Aug 25, 2014"
