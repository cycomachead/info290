3.02,-20.3,3,3.5,2.75,3,3,"12oz bottle poured into nonic. Hazy orange liquid with a a pillowy head that settles to a finger of foam. The aroma is packed with cedar wood and white pepper then there’s malt, bread, grass, and doughy yeast. Flavor is perfumed bitterness from the cedar, tea and white pepper, followed by citrus hop and caramel malts. Medium body, slightly thick but sadly without a resinous/sticky IPA character, lively carbonation, and a bitter, nearly astringent finish.","SierraFlight","Jan 27, 2015"

I think it wasn’t intended to be an ipa, and if its thought of outside that box its really unique, labeled ‘Japanese Classic Ale’ for a reason.  Got on Wishbeer, don’t regret it as I’ve never seen it in stores. Drank in Kunming, Jan 26th, 2015.","patre_tim","Dec 13, 2014"

3.84,1.3,4,3.75,3.75,4,4,"Single bottle poured into a tulip. A cloudy orange-red with two fingers of creamy beige foam. Aroma is a compelling mix of brittle toffee, orchard fruit (peach and pear), earthy/slightly woody forest floor hops, nuts and pretzels ... Palate is similarly unique. Does come across as an English IPA but with a moderate degree of plum fruitiness, a rich toffee maltiness, unexpected almond and pecan notes, and more expected cedar or sandalwood aromatics. Some diacetyl apparent. A stark contrast between the dry woodiness and the rich sweet malts, somehow it works. Body on the thick side for the style, moderate carbonation and a malt-forward finish seasoned with a dash of woody spice. Unique brew like many of this brewery's other offerings. Not well-integrated yet one can switch between the dry floral fruitiness, the woody spice, and the sweet dessert backbone and not get the least bit bored.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 13, 2014"

3.25,-14.2,,,,,,"A nicely balanced pale ale. Wouldn't consider it a big enough brew to be labeled as 'IPA'. Nice and crisp, easy drinking. I tasted pear and mild vegetal qualities.","MLichtwardt",
