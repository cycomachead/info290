2.7,-27.4,4,1.5,3,4,2.5,"Beer poured a nice light clear orange color with a white head the quickly disappeared. The bottle clamed "Aromatic" however I found there to be little aroma. A nice balance of malt and citrus notes, just really had to search for them. Taste was nice with a touch of sweetness from caramel malts balanced by a good dose of bitterness. Some citrus notes at the back of the palate. Medium body that finished a little bit o the dry side making the beer very refreshing. Overall a very sessionable, balanced beer.","CStang67","Jan 03, 2015"

3.8,2.2,3,3.5,4,3.75,4,"Pours a slightly hazy amber, similar to a brown oak leaf.  Normal head, lacing and retention. Nice nose of light sweet citrus (pear with lemon notes) over biscuit with a mild caramel note.  Light medium body with a hint of slick texture.  Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish.  The taste profile, while nice, is average in intensity, very well balanced and above average in complexity.  Where it excels, is in the flavor profile that surrounds the bitterness, especially for a low 4.2% alcohol content.  It begins with a flood of hop flavor (citric, rind and Noble) over light biscuit.  Mild bitterness follows in the middle from the classic English Bitter profile coupled with a citric rind twist.  As the bitterness diminishes, biscuit with caramel notes come forward.  The finish has just a hint of dryness that leaves you with a light grapefruit rind bitterness that lingers and leaves the tongue tart with a distinct mineral note.","tillmac62","Oct 15, 2014"
