It tastes robust, refreshing, chocolate, with a nice not too carbonated mouth feel.  I didn't look at the alcohol %, not a supermarket lager for sure, but the alcohol taste can't taste it for the rich flavor. This is yummy. I will stick with IPA's, but this is a wonderful change of pace.","ColoradoPhil","Jan 31, 2015"

4.1,6.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 2/28/2013. Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, brown sugar, toasted oats, raisin, light licorice, light smoke/char, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt and light-moderate dark fruit notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, brown sugar, toasted oats, raisin, light licorice, light smoke/char, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, brown sugar, toasted oats, raisin, light licorice, light smoke/char, and herbal/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and light-moderate dark fruit flavors; with a great roasted malt bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Russian imperial stout. All around great complexity and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and light-moderate dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 12, 2014"

Has a woodiness, which could be hop bitterness. There are softer flavors underneath, like creamed coffee and bourbon vanilla. Really unique. That nitro gas gives great feel. I wish the body wasn't lightened as much. Still close to rich. Leaning toward traditional English approach. Great beer.","thecheapies","May 27, 2014"

Pours with the cascading bubbles, which pretty much makes me want to keep cracking them open and pouring, just for the hell of it. Seriously, it's just fun to turn that bottle upside down and dump the sucker into your glass, mesmerized when it stops just shy of the lip and doesn't foam over. The beer itself is super creamy, but not too rich. Not rich at all actually - outside of the creaminess from the nitrogen, it's actually lighter for the style. It is a bit boozy, but I suppose at over 10%, that should be expected. Still, it is noticeable and serves as a good reminder to have some water handy before bed.","thezach","Mar 14, 2014"

Carbonation keeps things lively in the mouth and helps to create a thick and chewy mouthfeel. Overall, I am pleased with this one. What WUD lacks in strong flavors, it makes up in balancing the flavors it does have very well without the watered down characteristics of many a brewery’s attempt at this style of beer. Not overly expensive and pretty available in my experience, coughing up a few bucks for a bomber won’t hurt.","ThomasAWilson2","Feb 16, 2013"

Very slightly bitter up front on the tip of the tongue, mellowed out to a sweet almost milk stout, but finished up bitter and slightly burnt. Felt great in the mouth, coated very nicely.

What I liked most about this beer was the flavor, it had good balance between roasted malts and dark fruits and the alcohol wasn't that noticeable. What I liked least about this beer was the appearance and the lack of carbonation, it was just too light for the style and it needs a little more carbonation to it. I don't think I would buy this beer again, but it was a pretty good value for what it was, and I would only recommend this to people that like a big dark fruit aspect to their Imperial Stouts. This beer was ok for what it was but as a whole I thought it was pretty middle of road and it couldn't hold it's own against some of the best in the style. Left Hand is a pretty solid brewery but this beer fell short of being a great beer, but I still wouldn't mind trying the barrel aged version.

The taste is also a combination of dark malts, bitterness, and coffee. No chocolate of note. There are better Imperial Stouts out there but this has its attributes.","puboflyons","0"
