It tastes robust, refreshing, chocolate, with a nice not too carbonated mouth feel.  I didn't look at the alcohol %, not a supermarket lager for sure, but the alcohol taste can't taste it for the rich flavor. This is yummy. I will stick with IPA's, but this is a wonderful change of pace.","ColoradoPhil","Jan 26, 2015"
