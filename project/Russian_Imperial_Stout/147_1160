4.47,3,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.5,"Poured very dark black, with a two finger bubbly brown head that receded to a quarter inch thick foam, great lacing. Aroma was coffee, dark roast malt and booze. The dark roast malts really stood forward in the flavor, with some coffee, dark fruits, and of course the alcohol. The mouthfeel was thick and creamy smooth  - very nice. Overall, Stone hardly ever disappoints, and this beer is no exception.","timontheroad","Sunday at 03:48 AM"

3.71,-14.5,4.25,3.75,3.5,4,3.75,"Pours an amazing black with brown head but quickly downhill from there.  Smells of burnt malts and boozy alcohol that carries through the taste and finish.  Mouthful is a plus but overall seems like maybe some age is a good idea.  The burnt flavor and smell is all too powerful and dampers what seems like an otherwise pleasurable experience.","FaradayUncaged","Friday at 12:05 AM"
