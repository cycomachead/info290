4.65,12.6,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Overall: As stouts go, this one is an absolute killer - fantastic smell, massive flavour profile and a well-disguised ABV. I suspect this would benefit from some aging but as it comes it's absolutely stunning. The first beer I've had from Nøgne Ø and it certainly won't be the last - this should be on the shopping list of any stout enthusiast.","interzen","Mar 07, 2015"

3,-27.4,3,3,3,3,3,"A solid, straight forward RIS. I think the execution was on-point, and the lack of evident flaws is commendable. But, for me, it was a little too much char and a little too one-dimensional.","spoonhawk","Dec 24, 2014"
