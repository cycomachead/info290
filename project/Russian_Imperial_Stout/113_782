4.58,9.8,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"DATE TASTED: April 7, 2015... GLASSWARE: Duvel snifter.. OCCASION: celebrating the O’s opening day win while watching the NCAA finals... APPEARANCE: ominous black body that allows a swiftly simmering brown head to halo at the glass ... AROMA: powerful rum, vinous port, strong Spaltz and chocolate make for an inviting complexity--not to mention the roasted malts that provide a wicked balance... PALATE: smooth, slick, a bit dry, yet full-bodied--a paradox resolved only through a beautifully lingering aftertaste... TASTE: chocolate, roasted cracker, slight alcohol in a whiskey-like allure; the components make for a rich, dark, strong stout that is sweet and rewarding; some nut, raisin and cask wood further the experience...OVERALL: Once more, another brewery that does so little wrong--this beer commands the taste buds with strength and subtlety, rewarding the drinker with a sweet, powerful sip...","dacrza1","Monday at 08:18 PM"

4.67,12,3.75,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Overall: This stout has the typical hallmarks of imperial stouts - sweet roasty chocolatey maltiness and a dark fruity acidity with a moderate bitterness.  What is most different from american imperial stouts I've had is that it's not as thick and sweet. Also, accounting for the lower ABV, it is less boozy. The flavor balance is really remarkable - proof that you don't need a crazy high ABV to achieve an exceptional imperial stout.","maedhros09","Mar 22, 2015"

The head's color is even more intriguing; a frothy and bubbly tan head retains well as a sticky lace that reminds me of cappuccino foam. The aroma is unbelievable! Espresso, chocolate, banana or raisin bread and roasted malty sweetness. Taste has elements of sweet roasted malts, creamy coffee, and balanced by a slightly dry and very subtle bitter finish. Carbonation is lively on the tongue and settles as drink,gets warm. A full bodied drink; excellent to warm up to in cold weather and to eat with chocolates. I have been equally impressed with all of Samuel Smith's products, and this one might be my favorite thus far.","Gajo74","Dec 06, 2014"

4.25,1.9,,,,,,"Pours a pitch black in color with a good 3-finger beige head that settles finally down to a 2mm head after about 20 mins of sipping on it. A good amount of sticky lacing is seen that clings all the way up the sides of the glass. The aroma is of roasted malts, dark fruit (plums?) with a hint of bittersweet chocolate. The taste has even more going on that starts out with the roasted malts at first, with a slight sweet raisin-like taste than ends with a hint of semi-sweet chocolate. Actually very smooth and goes down easy. Medium+ bodied but a tad below average for carbonation that is good for this style of brew. One of the best Russian Imperial Stouts I have tasted.","BeerWithMike","Oct 08, 2014"

It has a good look, but the smell and taste is overwhelmingly choclately, with little of the hoppy roastiness that typical RIS boasts. Some of this may be the result of the unusually low ABV of 7%. It is still a very good beer, but anyone looking to buy this would be well-advised to purchase a single first if he can. I bought an entire 4-pack for $10 at Total Wine, and it just hasn't really panned out for me.","DanielMB","Jul 10, 2014"

Smell is impressive: chocolate is predominant, but there's caramel, dark fruits, port wine, vanilla, liquorice, and ome coffee. Taste is more or less the same, chocolate everywhere, with coffeemore noticeable than in the nose, caramel, dark fruits and vanilla. The only that doesn´t do it justice, IMO is the medium body and thin palate. Anyway, a great beer.","janubio","Jun 03, 2014"

The taste comes out best at warmer temperatures: the full roasted flavor can overpower the palate if swilled. When sipped and tasted first from the tip of the tongue, you get the full effect. The hops balance the roasted fruit flavor. Very pleasant feel. The drinking experience matches the beer's reputation as a classic - love it.","angusdegraosta","Jan 18, 2014"

4.24,1.7,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Poured from a classic Samuel Smith's bottle into a goblet. I am a major advocate of this brewery, appreciating the unique yeast and diacetyl character of their brews as well as the malt complexity. This is probably one of the top Russian imperial stouts in the world, providing a supreme balance of deep, rich malt flavors, sweetness, and perhaps surprisingly prominent hop flavors, hitting all these targets without going out of balance. Pours a Stygian opaque black with a few reddish highlights here and there, with ample rich tan foam. Releases an assertive admixture of buttery, chocolate, coffee, roast barley, and toasty aroma notes, roughly in that order. Tastes of chocolate brownie, caramel sauce, freeze-dried coffee crystals, plums, smoked corn husk, light rum, wood, Samuel Smith house yeast and earthy, grassy hops with maybe a hint of citrus rind. Incredible complexity of flavor with the expected heavy, thick body and low to moderate carbonation. The alcohol burn is there but less harsh and astringent than some American examples of the style. I appreciate the refined and measured approach to a "big beer" and this epitomizes that ideal.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 09, 2014"

I have no complaints other than a slightly underwhelming carbonation presence and it getting a little watery as it warms, but that's me being annoying. one of the best sam smith beers, which is definitely saying something.","StonedTrippin","May 01, 2013"

Lots of roasted malts, bakers chocolate, and cappuccino. Just a touch of brown sugar sweetness. My only real qualm is is a bit light and watery for an Imperial, and has almost no head. Overall very good, and a nice reprieve from the usual diabetes bombs that are most imperial stouts.","Samuel906","Apr 05, 2013"

3.66,-12.2,4,3,4,4,3.5,"550 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 5/10/2012. Pours fairly pitch black color with a nice 1-2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big apple, raisin, dark chocolate, brown sugar, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light coffee, light char, and herbal earthiness. Decent aromas with some good complexity; but the fruity aromas are a bit too overpowering, something went wrong with this bottle. Taste of dark chocolate, roasted malt, toast, toffee, brown sugar, dark bread, coffee, light char, raisin, and earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, toast, brown sugar, dark bread, coffee, toffee, light char, raisin, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance, robustness, and complexity of roasted malt flavors; with a good amount of balanced fruity complexity; and hardly any cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy, lightly slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice imperial stout style. Good balance and robustness of roasted flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering; despite the obvious flaws with this particular bottle.","superspak","Feb 15, 2013"

4.21,1,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass. Great looking motor oil black pour with an inviting 1+ finger of mocca head. Retention was nice and decent lacing . Smell was true to RIS form. Deep/dark fruits (raisins, figs, molasses) with a bit of chocolate and coffee on the end. Not very strong on the nose, but adequate. Taste was very smooth with the blend of the fruits that faded into the coffee characters. A little burnt wood, earthy note to close out. Nice subtle hop aftertaste to keep you coming back for more. Feel was a bit light for a RIS. A bit on the watery side, but this improved as the beer warmed. Overall- I had heard great things about Samuel Smith and it didn't disappoint. I found this to be a very spot on RIS. Loved the combination of big dark fruits and hints of coffee and chocolate. Complex and tasty. A definite must try and perfect for a cold December evening-","TheDinger","Dec 22, 2012"

The mouthfeel is full, smooth, thick, but not viscous, and compliments the beer very nicely. Flavors of honey and banana up front. Sorghum appears second and never dissipates. Rather, it bitters with the expression of the hop alpha acid. Some sweetness still occurs as the beer cascades down the sides of the tongue.

In the end, however, we couldn’t escape the standard souring malty twinge of any classic Sam Smith beer, which made it seem a little generic.

The aroma is of dark roasted barley malt, chocolate, coffee, and some dark fruits. The taste follows the nose and is very rich. There are flavors of dark roasted barley malts, bitter chocolate, coffee, molasses, anise, and dark fruits. It has a mild sweetness that is not too cloying. The alcohol is well hidden in the taste. The body is medium to full with adequate carbonation. It is smooth and creamy. The drinkability is very high for a style that lends it self more to sipping. Overall, this is an excellent beer and a classic example of a RIS. With the wide availability of this beer, you shouldn't have problems finding this in bottle shops.","acevenom","May 23, 2012"

Drying, creamy and great mouthfeel for the style - real bang on for what I dig. Low carbonation. An excellent imperial stout. My only point of contention?

The aroma is fruitier than one might expect - plum and raisin can be detected, and in the background, a touch of coffee and roasted malt. Seems sharp and crisp. After a sip the actual taste is revealed to be just as interesting and complex as the nose. The initial splash of flavor is the fruit/raisin followed by, a roasted, smoked touch and a dry finish. Very crisp on the tongue. As I drink the head sticks tightly to the glass - this is a nice frothy brew. This has a relatively light mouth feel and I can hardly put the glass down even for a second.

Smells like rich roasted malt and a hint of vanilla and cream and fruity notes. Taste is rich but restrained roasted malt and a little minerally (spot on, I totally see the well water) no hops/chocolate/coffee to speak of, finishing with a bit of bitterness. Medium body and carbonation which is not particularly smooth. Overall, the light touch of roasted malt makes this pretty drinkable.

I would drink it again, particularly since the price is relatively low, but its not something I’d go out of my way to have again. I prefer the bolder American RIS’s. However, I do think it is much better than the Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout, and certainly worth a try if you've never had it.

World class, and one of the less alc % ones out there, so it's one of the best ones to get if you arent used to this style of stout. It's also great tasting to those who are.

Nearly pitch black, maybe a touch of ruby color. Tan head diminished to a wisp of foam here and there. Roasty smell, quite inviting actually. The taste was smooth and balanced. Roasted coffee, chocolate, molasses, etc. Malt and hops in balance. Mouthfeel was actually thinner than I expected but nice nonetheless.

Overall, the aroma is a bit on the tart, fruity side... maybe a slight hint of chocolate and roasted malts in there, but predominantly black licorice. The taste is similar to the aroma: starts out with fruit and black licorice, then finishes a little more smokey and chocolatey. Malts and alcohol are also in the mix. A pretty complex beer, let it warm up a bit and the notes are easier to distinguish. Beautiful pour and very thick on the tongue; it’s a pretty heavy brew, but still quite drinkable.

Nose was rich with coffee, dark chocolate, dried dark fruits, smoke and even some alcohol heat. Whew! Mouthfeel was a little thin for the style, but still bigger and chewier than many other beers. The taste was very bitter, coffee-like, which was perfect since I was having this with and for breakfast. Take that, Catherine the Great! Finish was smoky, bitter, dry, a big Wow!, but without the often overpowering alcohol of its modern American iterations. Nice, plus it is accessible year-'round without having to stand in line to score some.","woodychandler","Jun 26, 2011"

The beer pours a dark, deep brown nearly opaque, and has a slight head at one finger, that dissipates quickly and laces slightly. Smell is generally coffee malts with some chocolate and a slight bit of hops, primarily floral in nature, mostly for bitterness. Taste is very much chocolate-coffee in nature, with little hop flavoring. Maybe a hair of floral hops. Anyway, feel is smooth, with a slight carbonation, some oiliness, and a generally full body. Overall, Samuel Smith's has done a great one with a style that they probably have been doing for nearly a century. I enjoyed it and will have it again.","jacobseyb","Jun 03, 2011"

The taste starts out with some molasses, followed by hints of coffee, raisins, plums and has a sweet taste in the background. Finishes off with some chocolate and even though I don't notice it so much when drinking it that in the aftertaste I get the floral and citrus taste from the hops.

The head is tiny and its a brown color, it fades very fast. The aroma is of burnt sugar and malts, also heavily roasted. The flavor of this beer is reflective of the aromas.

Off the charts for the style. My snifter disappeared in 20 minutes, which is crazy for a RIS. This might be helped by the lower ABV than is typical for the style, but this is quite drinkable no matter what you call it.

Drinkability is great, as this beer doesn't assault you with flavors, but rather allows them to come out softly of their own accord. Amount of flavor for the 7% abv is admirable as well considering the style. Finish could be a little bit better, as it is only kind of bitter and a tad watery, while I'd prefer it to be either neutral or heavily bitter, but it is good nonetheless.

Medium to full in body with medium carbonation. One sip definitely invites another. Roasty and fairly dry. A bit of a sipper though one sip invites another. Wow. Another slam-dunk for Samuel Smiths. A malt-forward traditional example of the style. Awesome.","MrHurmateeowish","Mar 02, 2011"

There is a lingering roasty taste on the tongue after each sip. Good carbonation and rich mouthfeel. Not too thick or thin.

Bitter burnt grain taste, strong char with the bite of molasses, chicory and licorice on top of bitter chocolate, dark fruit faint hints of soy, very little sweetness.

Oddly enough, the first aroma that hits the nose is of bacon fat. It has slight smoked notes that are driving me nuts. At this point in the evening, I'm totally digging it. Aside from that you get some roasted and dark malts with a subtle sweetness. The flavors are pretty solid too. It begins with silky smooth chocolate before going into light coffee and roasted malts. It's an excellent mix! Everything is blended so well together. I can't believe I waited so long to finally try this one. It drinks medium bodied and is very smooth going down. The mouthfeel is on point. It's perfect. I honestly cannot believe I'm enjoying this so much. I never expected a beer of this caliber from Sam Smith. This is one of the most drinkable RIS around.

This beer smells absolutely beatiful. Lots of fruit in the aroma, which surprised me for a stout, but it almost smelled like wine. Also smells of malt, chocolate and coffee. Palate is full, thick and velvety smooth as a stout should be. The flavor is coffee, malt, chocolate with a fruity tang. Has a bit of a winey alcohol flavor as it warms.

The flavors were excellently blended and well balanced. The vanilla aspect was also a pretty nice touch as well. The aroma was pretty good too with lots of nice notes shining through.

Aftertaste is smooth and bitter in a creamy way, reminds me of quality dark chocolate, not sweet at all. A little bit of alcohol is present when one slurps the beer from the glass, instead of pouring it in the mouth, pretty damn good to say the least. The mouthfeel is loose yet thick and creamy, really complex, one could probably write a poem about it. This is an almost perfect beer and the lower alcohol content makes it more drinkable than of others of this style. Slightly heavy with a roasted malt bitterness in the aftertaste, complex yet strong and makes it less drinkable, but only by a bit. Who wants a beer that is drinkable like water any way though?

Big time banana, bubblegum in the nose, sweet without needing much from the caramel, café au lait, raisin bread, bread pudding or plum to cherry fruit scents, very low on the roast, quite unusual and unexpected, satisfying at face value. Full-bodied, fairly smooth and fluid without too much weight. Much more roast here in the coffee, dark chocolate, this along with a mineral water aspect gives it cut and definition. Still, no lack of coconut, banana, toffee to join the plum, apricot, cherry flavors. The carbonation not light, more subtle, if no less effective.

You definitely taste the peppery notes of the beer, a complex flavour almost like the offspring of coffee and banana. There are definitely bitter chocolates mixed into this mix.

There's also a slight cola taste, which is really just caramel that seems to pick up towards the end. Over all the texture on this is very thick and authentic feeling. I can see how this inspired what American brewers are doing with stouts and to compare it to those ImpStoudts would be unfair as it helped give birth to the idea of bigger and bolder stouts.

The aroma i inhale is strong roast malt, coffee, and az it warms slightly, raisin. I raise the glass to lips in anticipation, and down the hatch.. cold coffee, bitter chocolate throughout, hops, dark fruit-prune/raisin. Medium-full body almost oily, feels lighter than its appearance might have you believe, with small/close, almost 'biting' bubbles on the tongue. Not a 'beginner' stout if there is such a thing, however very drinkable and enjoyable. Very tasty, a slight warmth is felt gradually with this 7% brew.

Powerful notes of roasted barley in the nose. Maybe the most roasted barley I have seen in a beer since the Dogfish head WWS. This is also very fruity for the style. Sweet molasses to back up the barley presence, plum and prunes in the aroma as well. The taste is complex to say the least, molasses, birch syrup, jammy plums and blackberry preserves, nice rich toffee notes, fig, dark sour cherries and a raisin wine richness. Like a complex, fine port wine-a true treat, I'm so happy it can be found regularly in my parts. Mouthfeel is heavy, creamy and silky on the tongue.

Smell: You can smell this one from a few feet away, but it's not really what I want in an RIS. Buttery, earthy, burnt sugar, sweet. Taste: lightly roasted, hops are mostly earthy and a tad leafy, diacetyl, toffee. A mineral-ly, hard water thing going on, but fairly smooth and active carbonation.

No lacing at all but it might be my glass. Smells of roasted malts and a metallic scent, not liking this metal thing at all. Also some dark sweet fruits in the nose. The taste is out of whack to me. It has nice roasted malts but also has a huge metallic taste, more than any beer I can think of. It kind of throws the balance off and ruins it. After reading other reviews I definitely get soy sauce, yuck. The extremely sweet fruity taste in this beer also does not belong in an imperial stout. Some hops compliment the finish but the sweetness of this beer is way too overwhelming. Also some cocoa behind the metallic sweetness. Mouthfeel is pretty good. Nice and creamy with good carbonation and a coat of that sweetness. No warming really at all. The drinkability here is not good, the sweet/metallic taste is hardly tolerable. The roasted malts save it but I can hardly finish the bottle. The price was very good but I will only try this one again if I really, really don't trust this bottle.

It is oily coal black with a deep tan head that yields neither for man nor beast. Smells of fruit soaked in rum in a barrel. With a cocoa powder sprinkled on top. Yes, I filled a barrel with fruit, rum, and cocoa just to confirm that so you can believe me. Taste starts with prunes, then moves to a surpisingly mellow coffee/dark chocolate mix that melts to a pleasantly dry chalkiness. WOW! This is the subtlest stout I've ever had and it is just off the charts. Mouthfeel is soft if a bit undercarbonated but its English so it comes by it honestly. Drinkability is fantastic for a stout. Not bitter or over-roasted at all. Not what I expected, the style is not my favorite but this is just phenol-menal, if you'll forgive me.

Aroma is complex balance of dark fruits and toffee/caramel malts. This almost smells like a red wine at first. Full bodied with light carbonation results in a very creamy, soft feel on the tongue. Flavors are similar to the aroma, body is initially fruity sweet, before the malt and chocolate flavors take over with a slight hop bitterness in the finish.

The taste is more rich dried fruit, with a taste like good African coffee smells but rarely delivers, passing into some lemon-rind astringency and a pleasant mineral, charcoal-smoke finish.

Pours an apparent black - when held up to the light, it's actually a very dark nut brown. Just a small amount of blown foam quickly recedes away, leaving no lace and just a bit of residual froth. The usual imperial stout scent is obvious from the bottle, and also from the glass - I'd put it at a little sweeter than most with a certain fruity character to the aroma. The mouthfeel is smooth and syrupy - I notice that even before the flavor, which is quite mild for the type. I taste nuts and maple syrup, with the alcohol becoming more assertive in the aftertaste. More carbonation than you can see in the small head. 7% ABV isn't extreme for the style, but given the smoothness this could be extraordinarily dangerous - I find myself going through this a lot faster than other imperial stouts. Quite good, in keeping with what Samuel Smith's usually puts out.

Unfortunately, however, I must do exactly that, and in my opinion this beer is no where near the level of Stone's IRS, North Coast's Old Rasputin, Founder's RIS, or countless other Russian Imperial Stouts. For a category of beer that is absolutely bursting forth with quality, Samuel Smith's version just isn't quite what I'm looking for. Judging by the other ratings for this beer it's possible that I got a bad bottle, but it's more likely that this beer just isn't quite up to snuff.

Not very dry or hoppy like some of the bigger imperials I have had recently, but more juicy and sweet. Definately a good offering from samuel smiths, which I never try, even though I see it all the time. (I might start after this one.)the mouthfeel and drinkability are both excellent, I'm not used to such a smooth and drinkable imperial stout.

I was really expecting more from Samuel Smith with this one. The Taddy Porter knocked my socks off and their other beers are generally, at least, excellent values. This offering is basically RIS light. It lacks the depth and complexity of flavor that is nearly commonplace amongst its competition. The feel is somewhat watery and really fails to bring the required breadth. That said, it's not bad, at all. This beer's rating is very much a product of its place relative to some truly great competition, and with Old Rasputin sharing its shelf space, it's not even a very good value in this neck of the woods (I imagine other areas have better Imp Stouts and RIS's as well). At any rate, the beer pours opaquely black with good lacing from a nice beige-mocha head. There are notes of toasted malt and English, minerally hops. The flavors just aren't big and strong enough. Also, while I usually like a thick, viscous feel on my Imperial Stouts, this one manages it while still being too watery, which turns out to be not altogether pleasant.

A change of pace as far as stouts go, and not altogether bad. However, I felt like it was missing something, whether its that extra kick of alcohol, or some hops, but I was left with a feeling like this was a very good beer that was missing something that would make it great.","olegv40","Dec 08, 2008"

I pick up some gin-like qualities in the mild alcohol presence. As it warms I pick up more of a chocolate malt in the sweetness. It's quite drinkable for this style, midland body feel. Boy this goes good with cheese and hot pepper rings. I don't know that much more description is necessary, it's very solid, and not exactly like every other stout out there.

There are waves of flavor coming over the palate. There is a strong mocha, cocoa chocolatey flavor first. There are liqueur flavors popping through, lots of warming alchol, raisin and raspberry in the deep recesses. There are sweet malts, caramels, molasses flavors, and some spices. The mouthfeel is very creamy but subtantial. The aftertaste has warming alcohol notes, and leaves a dark cherry chocolate residue. There is just a touch more ABV in the finish than I would have perferred. But, this beer is truly amazing. Its complexity is a pleasure to experience, and I may never speak ill of a RIS again.

The dryness also keys into the light chocolate overtones, with a light nuttyness and an even less noticeable 7% ABV. The subtlety of the characteristics of this beer prompts the question - must a beer with a stronger ABV render the alcohol a prominent taste component of the beer?

It starts off with some roasted chocolately sweet malts that cut by some slight coffee bitterness that hits at about the same time as some slightly-floral hops. Towards the end there is some prune and almost rum flavor that gives way to some smokiness in the end that almost reminds me of smoking a cigar. A very complex and enjoyable brew. The mouthfeel is pleasantly thick and almost creamy, with enough carbonation to keep it light.

The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and possibly too thin for this Imperial. But then again, the abv is only 7% so there is really nothing to hide. Overall, very smooth.

Cocoa character dominates the taste, followed by toffee; however, sweetness revealed in the nose is cut slightly and dark fruit is present closer to the finish. Body does not quite approach medium.

Taste is first of coffee and dark chocolate, with hops in the background. Hop flavor becomes somewhat more pronounced later in the taste before giving over to a finish of sweet cream. Alcohol is rather light for an imperial stout, and flavors are perhaps less pronounced than in other examples of the style. However, the end result is a serious stout with interesting and enjoyable complexities that complement one another instead of battling to dominate your palate.

This brew is a monster but balanced all at once, more molasses with coffee and bittersweet chocolate mingles with strong but flirting herbal hop tinges. Sweet malts blend with plums, raisins, and prunes. Slight leather note that finishes to a round sweet malt note that fades to a slight soy sauce and then back to herbal hops and yet again back to sweet malts. MAN, what a finish on this beer.

Not much in the way of sweetness, but what there is is demerara sugar mixed with a dark fruity note. This is a very well balanced Impy stout, mannered but very flavourful. Not overwhelming, just a great sipper. Carbonation is medium-low, and the palate dries well with the bitterness and acidity, begging for another sip. Drinkable as the 7% lets you finish a big bottle and not feel too bad.","trevorwideman","Jun 18, 2008"

Lightly bitter cocoa/coffee in the aftertaste, although pleasingly balanced with some sweet brewer's licorice. Combine it with the full, yet smooth and creamy mouthfeel, and this has got to be one of the most beautifully crafted stouts I've ever tried, Imperial or otherwise. I can easily see how Catherine The Great and her court (or cohorts) could have fallen in love with something akin to this as well and kept a steady supply ordered and imported from England, Yum!

This brew is for all purposes black but when held up to the light you can make out some brown color. The head stuck around for a long time. The aroma is sweet and fruit-like with the presence of alcohol. At first sip it is confusing but afterwards the flavors come out. This sweet brew is rich in awesome bitter dark chocolate and coffee flavors. The feel is surprisingly thin but smooth and slick. Towards the end of the pint my mouth is fairly dry.

Mouthfeel is quite smooth and creamy but is a bit thinner than most in this style. Drinkability is quite good.

Very round mouthfeel... complex flavors are quite overwhelming. Fruit tones and toffee/roast character present as well. Sweetness helps round the mouthfeel out yet isn't overbearing and is reminiscent of molasses or sorghum. Brew lingers on the palate with complex series of flavors. Abundant strong flavors supported with good hop bitterness. Decent quaffibility considering style, although it is quite filling.

It has a very deep roasted malt base followed by nice chocolatey and caramel flavors and then a bit of rasiny taste and then a short but perfect hoppy bitterness that rounds out the ber very well.

There's some roasted characeter as well in the form of sweet malt. Alcohol is a little heavier than expectations, which makes things a little fruity. There's some chocolate fudge cake that appears briefly before being knocked down.

An earthy start slowly shifts to a mild bitterness after a half minute or so. The smell is a bit too caramelly, and reminds me a bit of the over the top smell and taste of the Saranac Caramel Porter, but nowhere near as cloyingly sweet. While I generally am one to not reach for a stout or porter first, I find that this is consistently one I have around the house. (When a store in town actually stocks it or most often when I specifically order it.) This is a beer that makes me want to attempt to brew an Imperial Stout!

4.38,5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I bought this from Cracked Kettle and man do I love the bottle itself. The bottle itself is a nice slim and tall design with the top nicely wrapped in gold foil and a unique looking label. This beer yields a jet black pour with a nicely creamy looking tan head that moderately settles to a thin layer and finally a nice clingy lacing. On the nose I pick up roasted malts, chocolates, coffee and subtle dashes of dark fruits; some lactic milkiness also peaks out of the creamy head. The smell was not very strong and the various elements in the smell were nicely balanced out. The taste starts off with an immediately suggestion of coffee followed by roasted malts and light notes of chocolates here and there with a nice smooth milky backing. There were also dashes of dark fruits towards the finish and a good amount of roasted malts on the nose. Sweetness was probably very very subtle on this one and a slighty below moderate level of bitterness can be detected towards and during the finish. Taste was fairly rich though not very rich and it was very well balanced; without too much of anything. 7 ABV makes it a really light drink as well and it practically feels below 5. The lingering after taste had coffee, roasted malts and subtle dark fruits and a light bitterness. The mouthfeel is close to full bodied and is smooth and creamy with low carbonation and goes down very smooth. This is my first imperial stout and I feel that it is highly drinkable. I was expecting something pretty heavy. I prefer the Guinness Special Export Stout to this but the strength of this one is a nice, well balanced blend of many different flavours but not overly rich and yet very enjoyable and drinkable.","basica","Jan 04, 2008"

4.01,-3.8,4.5,3.5,4,3,5,"This beer pours blacker than a witches cat on a moonless night. The head is a strong light tan foam with good lace. The nose is kind of strange. It has typical roasted malt and chocolate/coffee bean hints, yet also has a bit of scotch ale smell (very slight). The taste starts out very malty with the chocolate, burnt coffee bean, and small vanilla taste. Through the middle I realize that what i thought was scotch ale on the nose was actually the sammy smith yeastish malt funk(good funk) that you can find in almost all of their brews. There is slight hop flavor and bite here as well, just before the finish. The finish falls back into the more familiar imperial flavors. The mouthfeel is where this beer struggles. it is very thin for an imperial stout, but goes down smooth. I suspect that this can be closely linked to the brews weak 7% abv. Drinkability is very high. still a good brew overall and a great beginners imperial stout. A good buy, and another great sammy smiths beer.","AKBelgianBeast","Dec 28, 2007"

Nice and strong. One can detect dark fruits, roasted coffee, caramel, and brown sugar. Very sweet smelling. Taste was a little fainter than the smell indicated, though still complex and still delicious. The darker fruits make themselves a little more known as it warms.

Maybe the smell I picked up was just a variety of malts. Poured out with a thing head, and looked a bit lighter in terms of density compared to other stouts. Tasted of the coffee and chocolate that most stouts had, but had incredibly earthy hints, possibly of nuts or some spices.

As it warmed it took on a slightly coffee-like smell. Taste was incredible, the first smell wasnt too impressive but boy was the taste. Very creamy and smooth texture to the drink. I can taste chocolate, coffee, raisin, a bit of the "typical" stout tastes (for me at least) but something about this one was incredible. I like the fact that it is lower in alcohol, that made it a little more drinkable and enjoyable in my book. Overall a great beer and seems worthy of its high reviews.","bunnyhustle","Oct 31, 2007"

The taste and mouthfeel is quite heavy and complex, but that's kind of the idea with a stout. One might even feel compelled to refer to this as a "manly brew," which it most certainly is. The taste is hard to describe in layman's terms, but there are strong malt, licorice and coffee notes (I think a coffee drinker that dabbles into beer would especially like this). There's a good amount of sweetness to it as well, but nothing that overpowers the flavor of the beer. The term "well-balanced" is a good way to describe this one.","Karyyk","Sep 15, 2007"

Overall, I wasnt really impressed with this stout. I've tried a few other RIS, but this one just didnt measure up.

The taste is smokier than most imps I've tasted, but production of this is too high for it to be barrel-aged; it must be the malts.

The taste on this stout is excellent. very sweet early and as it moves further back on the tongue the malts really start to show, then it recedes to a sweet finish that leaves a nice bitter coffee aftertaste, that lingers.

The appearance was a dark brown hue with a 4 inch frothy mocha head. The head fully lasted and left a great amount of lacing. The scent of roasted malt, caramel and mild coffee added to its complexity. Found it to start moderately sweet with a coffee and chocolate aftertaste that was right on. The medium to full body added a creamy yet slightly syrupy feel on the palate. The soft carbonation and light alcohol feel rounded out the taste and feel just perfectly. Overall, she would drink a six pack easily, although I think they come in a four pack. I do have to admit that I got a few sips in, but that was it.

Flavor is very complex some bitter coffee with a subtle yet enduring sweetness, rich coffee, chocolate finish not cloying, some sherried raisins and fruit. Slightly milky and oily, flavor all around, not too thick tasty stout to be savored.

The lacing manages to be pretty thick and entrenched. The body is truly opaque. I'd allow less head retention, if the ABV were comparable to most impys. The aroma is filled with an intense burnt caramel and molasses scent, accompanied by a blast of sweetness. The fruity vinousness is reminiscent slightly of shiraz, but also of the flavors found in chocolate over 70 percent. The taste, which I didn't get to until the glass spent some time warming, is vinous, molasses-filled, very roasted, and excellent. Sweet in the start, but leaves a coffee aftertaste, very dry.

The nose is somewhat deceptive, as it's just fairly mild roasted malt. The palate, however, is much bolder than the nose. It's not a complex beer, with predominantly heavily roasted malt and a touch of bitter coffee shining through. The very definition of an Imperial Stout. The mouthfeel is suitably thick to match it's opaque appearance. No beer this black could be as thin as a lager. Thankfully, all the best parts of the flavor stick around as a result. It's quite an exceptional stout. Flavorful, yet no one aspect overpowers the brew. If only it weren't so filling, it would easily be a session beer based on the merits of it's flavor.

Poured into a glass I found at the thrift store, wide hollow stemmed wine glass type thing, 3 inches of dark brown head, subsided to about a half inch. Taste to me is incredibly complex. Red wine depths, with chocolate and coffee overtones. Little bit of hops at the back. This one is a bit syrupy for me, though, I imagine a draft might smooth her out a bit.

Smell is a bit light, with chocolate and dark fruits apparent, but a bit of an off note too, likely due to the clear bottle. How a brewery of Samuel Smith's tradition and repute could even think about clear glass is beyond me, but I digress. Taste gets back on track. Rich and full, with a heavy fruitiness containing notes of cherry, plum, and raisin coming alongside burnt chocolate and a lovely hint of brandy and port wine. The roasted bitterness in the finish goes on forever, thanks in great measure to the thick, rounded body. Drinkability is great. Top notch, without a doubt.","Mandrake","Jul 21, 2006"

Fruity up front with that pluminess, then it becomes more of a sweet, slightly roasted chocolate taste, followed by ... uh oh .... that peaty sourness that i dont like and i alwasys get from S.Smith. This kind of gets lost late as the drinking progresses, but its hard to ignore at first. Mouthfeel is a little thin for this type of beer i thought too.

Molasses and roasted malts up front with a very firm bitterness below. Whiff of vanilla as well. Really, really flavorful but not for the weak-hearted!

Recently revisiting this brew makes me wonder why I have been away for so long. The stout has a very bold roasted quality with a light bitterness due to the black malts and light hopping. Has a layered cocoa, coffee, and milk flavors for added complexity. The beer, though bold and strong, is never intimidating, domineering, or aggressive. Moderately sweet with a rich and complex robustness. Properly brewed and well aged. Full and rich to the texture with a silky, creamy flow.

This beer is quite rich and complex for only 7% abv and it exhibits many of the qualities of much stronger Imperial Stouts. I believe this was the first RIS to be imported to the U.S. and it has always been one of my favorites. The character of this brew is still the same as when I first tried it back in the early 90's. The only criticism I've got is those damn clear bottles that Sam Smith uses. If you're going to cellar this beer, make sure you keep it away from any light source.","rodrot","Feb 08, 2006"
4.55,9.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Im really enjoying drinking this beer. Theres no carbonation to speak of and no head either but thats not getting me down. Im smelling rich bourbon, which I usually detest in beers, but this scent is laced with blackberries, plums, and vinous currants. Im loving it. Bitter chocolate then fills out the rich, sweet dark fruits nicely. The mouthfeel is as chewy as the color is opaqued plum. A long lingering oak barrel bitterness rounds out the thick beer nicely along with hits of chocolate and roasted, no burnt currants. Great beer and very complex. Im going to have to drink a few more bottles to search this one for all of its elements.","DaPeculierDane","Feb 06, 2006"

Taste is a complex blend of dark fruit ,roasty malt flavors of coffee , a little smokey chocolate , and some nice light hoppy notes in the finish. Very , very good! Mouthfeel is light and slick.

Aroma is an awesome blend of coffee and dark chocolate, after a couple swirls of the glass to remove a slight skunkiness (damn clear bottles). Taste is dark roast coffee, with some very dark chocolate and some sour fruit as well. Just a great blending of flavors. Off-dry finish with hoppy bitterness evident, but nowhere near the hop level of some new-school versions. Mouthfeel is heavy and slick but carbonation is still evident. Very drinkable, and the fact that this beer is only 7% makes it reasonable to have a couple. Just a great, classic beer.","ColForbin","Jan 29, 2006"

Having said that, the alcohol is not hidden well at all. At "only" 7-percentalcohol, it tastes awfully harsh. I can think of a few 7+ percent stouts that hide the alcohol much better.

Dark fruit flavors mix in nicely along with a bit of alcohol flavor. A slight butteriness is noted, especially near the finish. The sweet finish is especially long-lasting. Without a doubt this beer has a excellent mix of flavors that are layered nicely, but when compared to the bigger American imperial stouts, this falls a little short of exceptional. Still, this is highly recommended.","Gagnonsux","Dec 10, 2005"

It had a lasting chocolate/coffee bean aftertaste which was pleasant, but left something ot be desired. It had a bitter and watery mouthfeel.

Slightly buttery but mostly spicy bitter finish. Mineral aftertaste. Not bad at all. As it warms, the flavors balance out more. Definitely a standard-bearer of taste, but not quite the heaven in a bottle I was expecting. Incredible mouthfeel, however: tingly, slick and oily and an eminently downable medium-to-thin body.

Burnt chocolate nose, some alcohol vapors present, and background hops. Huge roasted flavor, nicely blended with bakers chocolate, and a mild vinous character. The bitter and sweet flavors are prduced by the malt, and there is some residual sweeteness, but the drying hop aftertaste helps keep the taste somewhat balanced.

Taste has big chocolate and roasted flavors, with some coffee, cream, plum, floral hops, blackstrap molasses and some alcohol notes. The hops really help to balance out the sweetness and help make this stout very drinkable. Mouthfeel is smooth with a medium body and a lightly bitter, astringent finish.

As for this huge beer, there is still supreme drinkability, and even if Imperial Stouts are not on your menu- this is a must try.

A little bit of dark rbuy red edging when held to light. Smells cherry sour, roast, and underlying caramel. Tastes delicious...oh my! Chocolate, roast, sour, caramel, currant, raisin, blueberry, prune. Imagine a dense chocolate raisin rum cake, the weight of which has a buttery brown sugar syrup almost tearing out the sides, but nothing quite collects on the plate. Some beers flash a certain flavor before it bows and leaves the stage for some other flavor to shine in the spotlight. Not this beer...this beer holds each flavor throughout the taste. Each rising and mixing with other flavors and never quite going away before merging with some other flavor. A delight to pull each draw and ponder each aftertaste. No gulp is a repeat of a previous..there's alot going on and I seem to focus on different wonderful qualities during each taste. Plus, a wonderfully thick smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is mild and tinkers the thick hanging on my tongue. I think this helps some flavors remain fruity and pleasant so that the beer isn't overly heavy. Lacing on the inside of the glass defines the level the liquid sat after each gulp. There is still a thinlayer of head on top of the beer. What an amazing selection.","mentor","Jul 31, 2005"

Sammy Smith has been that brewery recently, along with Fantome. Both great in different ways. This is one of the beers (among several) in their lineup that will now be a permanent part of my "beer rotation." Appears a staunch black color, letting in no light. Smells and tastes are super complex. Lots of different angles coming at me here. First there's a dark fruity component, dried cherries and currants. There's also a nice roasted malt in there and actually a bit of spicy hops that I can definately taste. More odd stuff: milky tones, dust, and a leathery character, like sticking your face in a baseball glove that's been sitting in the sun all day. This beer is almost "funky" in the way that a farmhouse ale might be described, though with out the sour. Really amazing tastes here, very complex once again.

Taste is also quite a treat with the chocolate hitting first (without too much sweetness) and followed by the roasted malt and coffee to finish the whole thing.

Theres an "ink" flavor that I find in some imperials and just love-this is full of that. Good body-not as full as some of the others but it plays well considering the overall flavor and texture of the beer. A highly drinkable brew-at an easy going 7% this could go on all night.

Smells of roasted malt, bitter chocolate, coffee beans, lactose sweetness, and dark fruits. Taste is roasty and bittersweet. First sip is burnt malt, bitter chocolate and bitter hops. Then, after awhile, it mellows out to a nice sweet flavour. Bread, milk, tobacco and fruits, with an almost smokey aftertaste. Mouthfeel is almost syrupy. I like it. I'll be buying this again.

Little to no lacing left behind. The aroma is that of extremely sweet honey and/or molasses, roasted barley, and hints of chocolate and coffee. Also present is the smell of warming alcohol. The flavors mimic the scents as expected: sweet malts and syrups with a nice warming alcohol kick. On top of this, there is a slight carbonation that thins the mix just enough for easy consumption. An easy bitterness finishes off all the sweetness leaving a semi-dry finish. Overall, very well balanced. Mouthfeel is exactly what you would expect from the style: thick and full bodied.

But a '57 Bel-Aire with a 502 c.i. crate motor, six-speed, disc brakes and a 1200-watt sound sytem is a HELL of a lot more fun to drive.

Smell is quite potent, very malty and quite attractive. Taste is good. Very deep, burnt flavor dominates here, much more so than most American imperial stouts. Almost coffee-like, but with a sharp sweet and sour flavor backing it up, the beer is surprisingly tangy. A good try, and I will certainly buy this again if I am in the mood for it, but I would almost NEED to be in the mood for this to drink it. Unusual to say the least.","RocketWidget","Oct 10, 2004"

The taste is incredibly rich and complex. The coffee flavors are so well defined. There is a diversity of chocolatey flavors. The hops very evident. Theres also a smokey faintly acidity (from the roasted barley?). The carbonation is light in this thick brew making for a creamy mouthfeel. This beer is eminently drinkable because it is so well balanced and alcohol flavors are completely concealed behind a wall of richness. An excellent Imperial Stout.","CAMRAhardliner","Aug 28, 2004"

So seeing how it is right behind on of my favorites in Stone Russian imperial stout I had to pick it up to review it. Pours out used oil black that looked a little thinner than other RIS I have had but great nonetheless. A full dark tan head formed atop the oily liquid and left no much in the way of lace as it faded away. There seems to be a strong smell of chocolate liquor coming from this with fruits and a bit of alcohol as well. Sweet chocolate covered fruit came to mind when I first sipped this. Chocolate and a touch of coffee were also present as well as a bittersweet finish. There was an odd sour taste that hit me a few times that was very unpleasant, not sure what this is from. Mouthfeel was good but not as thick as other Imperial Stouts but creamy still. Drinkability was lower than I would have though with that odd taste really putting me off.

Full bodied beer that contains flavors of caramel, roasted malts, and coffee, but it has a touch of sweetness to it. Very creamy mouthfeel.

This beer does not have the inky black look of other imperial stouts. The head was coffee-colored and formed at about 1½ inches thick initially, but then quickly dissipated to a thin layer of foam and some decent lace. The aroma was roasted coffer and dark chocolate goodness, with a dollop of dark skinned fruits thrown in the mix. The taste was a delightfully intense balance between the sweet flavors of raisins, figs, toffee, and apples; and bitter notes of old coffee and unsweetened chocolate. The alcohol warmth was pretty tepid for an imperial stout, and is clearly not the draw in this beer. The mouthfeel was also quite a bit lighter that the big boys, but was satisfying nonetheless. An easy drinking stout that is clearly a step above the ordinary, but remains very approachable still. A sessionable imperial stout if you will.","rajendra82","Aug 03, 2004"

4.41,5.8,4.5,3.5,5,4,4.5,"Black as night. So dark, it makes it impossible to tell whether the bottle is, in fact, clear or not until you pour (it is). A nice thick, creamy, dark tan head forms, making for an impressive looking beer sitting in my goblet. A beautiful sweet dark malt aroma tantalizes your nose, waiting for the promise of the taste. There is definitely some dark chocolate in the background of the aroma. The taste is simply wonderful! The smoothest imperial stout I've ever had the privilege to drink. Dark chocolate, plums, and even a nutty presence all make themselve known. All riding a great malt background. Truly a great tasting stout! I get none of the typical off flavors common to stouts. The mouthfeel is thick and full, as an imperial stout should be. It is dangerously drinkable due to the smoothness. The 7% ABV is hidden. It goes down very easily! I love this beer and wish it could be had more readily to me. Another great stout from Samuel Smith.","Hagbard","Jun 07, 2004"
4.7,12.7,5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"In particular the beauty of this beer (and one of the greatest things about all imperial stouts) is the great mouthfeel. As this thick syrup slides down my throat and sticks to the sides of my mouth I can hardly believe that this substance can even be called by the same name as what most people gulp down by the can all over this country, I really feel the calling to spread the word to the ends of the earth that a veil has been drawn over the eyes of the public and this dark slosh is just the substance to wash away ignorance and replace it with a knowledge of thick, full, roasted goodness!!!","aaronbeach69","Jun 07, 2004"

4,-4.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Very dark brown body with a finely laced beige head, short-lasting. Aroma is very malty, full of dark chocolate, very roasty with coffee notes. A good hops mariage complement it all. I don't get much fruitiness in the aroma, but in mouth, there's plenty of them, lots of blackberries and plums. Mouthfeel is full, more carbonation than most. This possesses one of the most balanced roastiness I've met in the dry, almost smokey finish. Alcohol appears more and more as it warms, I'd have thought this is higher than 7%, I guess they sure didn't want to make it weak, it worked. Very full-flavoured and pleasant. Refined and less acid than most american renditions. Cheers to Matta for sending this a few decades ago!","Rastacouere","Apr 23, 2004"

Surprisingly any roast malt character is pretty subdued. This beer has a light creamy mouthfeel, with a finish of roast malts. The taste is reminiscent of malt balls, with molasses notes up front. The finish is sweet but it is balanced by a burnt acidity, the combination of the two is quite good. I also get notes of espresso and burnt raisins. This is pretty good, I haven't had one of these in years, and hopefully I will revisit this one sooner rather than later.","Gueuzedude","Apr 20, 2004"

The aroma is an experience unto itself: Roasted barley, toasted malts, caramel, coffee, chocolate, ethanol, caramelizing sugar, and ripe plums. Its simply a phenomenal smell!! Taste is solidly roasted barley with a heavy hoppiness and syrupy sweetness. Coffee-like bitterness, considerable heft (and almost chewy-ness), low carbonation contribute to the character of the beer. Bitterness and sweetness are very well balanced. Alcohol is mildly present in the aroma, but not predominant in the taste. This ones a classic.","Suds","Apr 04, 2004"

4.48,7.4,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The appearance of this Imperial was exceptional in my opinion. Not only was it an opaque opal color, but, it also had a nice 2 finger dark tan head that just lingered. It looked so darn good. Even when the head did start to go down it left a curtain of lace that would then form perfect rings around my glass. This was a visual 5, no doubt about it. The smell was excellent as well. A caramel nuttiness, with plenty of roasted malts and coffee notes. To me it's a similar smell to the Taddy Porter. The taste was of burned caramel, roasted espresso beans and roasted sweet malts. It also had the sweetness of burned fruits, raisons, and dates. The mouthfeel, although very good, was a bit thinner than I expected. Again, not bad at all, but from the richness of the rest of the experience I expected a bit more body. Very drinkable, the exceptional taste of this Imperial makes you wish winter would last a bit longer so you could squeeze a few more sessions in around the fire place.","Ieatlambfries","Mar 07, 2004"

The aromas are of a bit of bitter chocolate, strong coffee and a bit of brandied dried fruits. Taste is echoed.. Nice espresso roasted coffee notes in the taste with the chocolate and dried fruits adding some depth. This is one tasty treat. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with only a bit of the alcohol showing through. Drinkability is high for a stout of this stature and magnitude. One of the best you can find.

4.05,-2.9,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Samuel Smiths Imperial Stout was served from a 550 ml clear bottle. When the beer was poured into an imperial pint glass, a thick and rich rocky tan head formed, then settled after a minute into a thinner but darker brown blanket, leaving thick lacing. The beer itself was impervious to light, except at the thinner bottom, where some deep ruby was seen to shine through. The nose was loaded with notes of ripe plantain, dark chocolate, sweet banana, and molasses... an intersting contrast to the nose of many of the top American imperial stouts. The taste was highly influenced by the nose. A mellow roasted malt base holds up flavors of molasses and dark chocolate, with subtle suggestions of banana coming through in the lingering semi-dry and well-bittered finish. The body was a little thin for an imperial stout, but wasnt too detrimental to the overall experience. As this was a toned down imperial stout, not in flavor but in body and alcohol content, it was very drinkable. Overall a solid and fine tuned piece of work, sure to please most stout lovers, but may dissapoint junkies of Expedition, Speedway, or Storm King Stout.","HiroProtagonist","Feb 01, 2004"

One of the more truly balanced Imperial Stouts, it's big, but not humongous; full, but not bloated; dense, but far from over-complicated. The rather moderate ABV and fetching features make this emminently drinkable and enjoyable. It's a fine taste of England, and if it's even better on that side of the pond, then maybe I should be buying a plane ticket first thing.","Foxman","Jan 28, 2004"

It reminds me of Victory's Storm King and Sam Adam's Cream Stout put together. It's got that creamy aftertaste which makes it complex. And at 7.0%ABV, you wouldn't even know it's that much (the taste that is), although it does warm your throat and stomach which is a nice feel. Truly one of the best beers money can buy.

The taste is definately spicy meats and coffee, with lots of toasted malts, and a slight burnt flavor. The head gives its own very spicy taste.

The rich maltiness was consistent from start to finish and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this beer didn't have that after bite that a lot of stronger beers I tried tend to have.

4.33,3.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Appearance: Great same massive sized head as most Samuel Smith's brews out there, but this one has a deep brown amber black dark chocolate hue to it allows minimal light to pass through with a streak of prune hue purple deepness, lacing nice thickets of tan lacing clinging to my imperial pint. Aroma: Once again deep chocolate and coffee tones are present with fruit edges there fermented prunes or figs with chocolate sauce englazoned uone them how wonderful every dark roasted stout should smell this magnifcant. Minimal hopping in the aroma for the fruit and deep flavoful roasts mean to steal the show. Tase: Alcohol infused deep roasted malts with fruit remaninsce leaving their mark upon this heavenly dark ale, I really think this is one of the best imperial stouts on the market maybe not extreme or over the top but most flavorful and consistent the Sam Smith's reportoire get's the gold. Mouhfeel: A bit fuller than most Sammy Smith's this one packs quite the body keeping each sip not only flavorful but chewy. Drinkability: Is incredible for the amount of alcohol and flavor coming through I can't believe they allow this type of beer out there in this semi prohibitional state this country sometimes seems to be stuck in.","WVbeergeek","Oct 01, 2003"

4.16,-0.2,5,4,4,4,4.5,"There's a little deception with the bottle with the gold foil over the top so you're tricked into thinking you have a dark brown bottle, but as you pour it the bottle empties and it becomes a clear bottle. It pours out blubbing from its longer, thinner neck to a super thick dark brown used motor oil color, much like that of what it looks like in the bottle, a finger high head of cocoa brown, very dense whipped cream froth appears with a momentary rocky top then settles slowly down to a thin haze and the lace is in thick sticky sheets with some moth holes in it. Smell has a bunch of licorice and a touch of cherry with notes of sweet chocolate, dark toffee, and french silk pie, sweet tangy roastyness is there but modestly soft. Taste is a mild mellow mix of sweet chocolate, soft tangy roasted malts, and some fruit cake or breads, cherry mostly with some raisin and fig notions. Smooth and lasting medium body feel with some light coffeeish like drying and muffled, dulled fruity roasted tangyness in the finish which lingers for a shortened minute. Goes down easy with some carbonation that lends a somewhat flat soda pop. I just wonder if the light getting through the clear bottle is doing something to it? A solid well balanced Imperial Stout but not all that intriguing or complex really. The nose got a bit more lively as it warmed which was nice, as for the taste the warmth only brought out a flatter roastyness and lost the fruity notions that I did like at first. A great start for any would-be beer lover that wishes to aspire to better beer.","tavernjef","Sep 19, 2003"

Rich in malt sweetness and a creamy roast character with a phenomenal balance of hop bitterness and flavor. It is so refreshing and clean that i can easily drink large gulps of this and never have to worry about a bitter aftertaste. Medium bodied yet filling and definetly a bit alcoholic.

The only real downside to the brew was a fairly light to medium body which seemed out of character for the style out of a bottle. Still it has a great finish which is good because you probably wouldn't too many of these in a session.

The nose on this beer has a rare and enticing blend of smoky caramel and robust alcohol, it makes me want to dive right in. The expected taste, however, does not fully portray it's smell. It is a surprisingly easy beer to drink, with complexities of mild yet rich maltiness with a perfect mix of subtle carbonation. The mouthfeel is like silk on the tongue, and it lingers there for a great duration before exiting with a desirable sweetness. It is simply outstanding. I have to sample other quality Imperial's before I move this one into the 5.0 range, but right now, I am feeling a bit guilty that I haven't already done so.","beernuts4u","Jul 29, 2003"

Poured nice and smooth and appeared jet black in the glass like most good imperials. Very little head on this one. Smelled of coffee and perhaps a hint of chocolate, though neither was overwhelming. Perfect milky smooth mouthfeel, I wanted to 'swish' it around in my mouth before drinking! A lot of flavor and very, very smooth. That Samuel Smith smoothness that I love only complimented the imperial style 'bite' that comes with some of the stronger imperials. I had to go with a 5 on the drinkability on this one, and I rarely give 5s. I did not want to put this one down. Did I mention that it was smooth??!!

A real treat to drink.It poured jet black except the very bottem where there was a thin sliver of scarlet light. There was a thin, tan, rocky head pearched on top and the lace clung to the sides. Upon smelling my nose immediatly picked up huge, roasty malts and extreme smoked bitterness. The Imperial Stout slunk down my throat coating it with an abundance of flavors. The tip of my tongue was tickled by hop bitterness, which rolled into a heavy dose of sweet chocolate malts balanced with caramel. The taste was rounded out at the end with a chalky, dry aftertaste and a warming alcohol feeling in the back of my throat. The mouthfeel was not extremely heavy as I would have expected and had a tiny bubble carbonation, which delighted my tongue. One question though, why the clear bottle?","GreatPondBrewer","May 29, 2003"

The dark tan head lofts it way upwards tantalizingly and then recedes deliberately into a fine buckskin blanket over the insides of the entire glass. The smell is slightly sweet, molasses and dark cherry balancing the mossy darkness of the stout. But the mouthfeel--it's like a down comforter on a cold, crisp night. And a taste to match--smoked toffee from start to finish with the subtle sweetness emerging from time to time as I savour every sip.","longpondbeerman","May 29, 2003"

I get some dark fruits coming through as well, but vanilla stuck out the most. I love it! Super-smooth creaminess is the mouthfeel of this medium to full bodied brew. Strong flavors of burnt coffee and chocolate treat your palate, and then some hops come by for a quick stay in the finish.

4.65,11.5,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"An opaque black body is capped by a foamy tan head that holds exceptionally well. It eventually drops, but maintains a creamy collar & thin surface covering throughout the glass. Some very nice Brussel's lace adds to the appearance. The aroma expresses dark fruit (currant, plum), dark chocolate, roastiness, and molasses. The medium/full body combines with a fine and moderate carbonation to give a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. The exceptionally rich, sweet malt expresses chocolate, toffee, roast, and coffee that's backed by a firm hop bitterness. It starts fruity (raisin, prune), developing sweetness and chocolate, but most of the flavors appear after the swallow when the tastebuds are no longer being overwhelmed. Fruit bursts forth followed by chocolate and rich caramel/molasses, then some floral hop flavor, and finally its roastiness appears - coffee-like and still somewhat chocolatey - with a borderline smokiness. The long and complex finish is what makes this beer... it's meant to be savored! It may at first seem more restrained than other examples of the style (and essentially it is), but a closer look reveals an immensely drinkable and exceptionally complex stout. Quite well done and well worth seeking out.","NeroFiddled","Feb 07, 2003"

Carbonation is mild to moderate with small bubbles. Aroma is raisins, prunes, toffee, semisweet chocolate, and dark maple syrup. Despite the clear bottle, there are no noticeable off aromas...smells great. Mouthfeel is slick and chewy. Taste is initially black licorice, dark molasses, prunes, dates and figs, fading into a somewhat unpleasant metallic tinge, followed by wine-ish notes, ending in a long, pleasant caramelized sugar sweetness. Hops are restrained, letting the complexities of the malts shine through. An enjoyable brew...incredibly easy to drink for an imperial stout (easy to put 3-4 of these away in one sitting), and a good source of calories when shoveling the snow out of your driveway on a windy winter night.","Mitchster","Feb 04, 2003"

3.86,-7.4,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This stout is very dark brown (almost black, with there are hints of red if held to the light). It pours to give very little foam head. There is only a trace of an aroma (not unusual for a stout). The taste was full with the flavors of bitter chocolate and coffee coming through the dark malt. Not much hop character. The mouthfeel is sweet and smooth, and the body is medium. The drinkability is good for this strong stout.","UncleJimbo","Jan 21, 2003"

I believe that it is one of the best balanced beers of the style (that I have tried). Goes down quite easy for a thick-bodied, 7% alcohol beer. Not too hoppy or malty. Pours extremely dark, good- sized head, some remains throughout. Notes of chocolate (but not overly so), and not too dry (as are some of the other highly regarded imperials). Most times I've had this beer, I've enjoyed it completely, however it may be adversely affected by the clear bottle.","JohnnyDuvel","Jan 07, 2003"
4.6,10.3,5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"The jet-black typical stout color is so pleasant a site sitting in its chalice, with the portly head perched atop the black beauty. Creamy in its texture, chocolate brown in color and as it evaporates, leaves a magnificent sheet of lace to smother the glass. The aromas of a truly great Imperial Stout are unmistakable, rich roasted grain, bittersweet chocolate, fresh roasted coffee beans, lightly sweet, and an absolute treat to the senses. Ambrosial malt start, the top thick and creamy rich the finish has a nice crisp acidic bite, hops purposeful in their spiciness. Aftertaste is chocolate malt dry, and quite long lasting, and in my opinion, still one of the best "Stouts" on the "Beer market" today, as it was yesterday and as it will be tomorrow. This is one brewery that still loves its beer and the drinkers who buy their products.","Gusler","Jan 01, 2003"

The smell is malt with some caramel sweet tones. The taste is just average, nothing complex or interesting and even a little watery in my mind. This is my favorite style (so far) but this beer lacked the in your face flavor and complexities of other Imperials that I love (Rogue, Storm King). I do like the color and the mouthfeel was good, but as far as taste (the most important factor in my book) it just didn't pack it.","doho95fu","Dec 29, 2002"

Jet black with a nice tan head, this is possibly the smoothest of imperial stouts. Rich and malty with roasted chocolate and coffee like flavor, it also reminded me of port, with sort of plum flavors. This beer is so smooth, with a velt texture, it just goes down easily.

The taste is where this beer really shines. Molasses, toffee, coffee, caramel and plums are present. The 7% ABV is hidden well with little alcohol presence.

Bubbly, small drops of hop oil, dance on top. Great smell of roasted plums, raisans and other fruit. Molasses. Taste is silky smooth, roasted plums, subtle bitter chocolate malt. Quick hint of port wine. Bitter snap starts, then sweet slippery port finish. Great beer, and well worth the praise it receives.","StevieW","Dec 13, 2002"

This beer is soooo good and complex. Right now I'm having a bit of a crisis because I think I might like this better than the SS Oatmeal Stout. This one is definitely more complex, but I'd need an O-Stout here for comparison before I make such a big decision. I wanted to try this so bad that I paid 5 bucks for a single bottle. I know I got totally ripped off, but in Lancaster PA, my only alternative was driving to Philly or Maryland, or spending fifty bucks for a case. Had I known I'd like it this much, I might have gotten a case. Well, at least it was a kick-ass beer. Do yourself a favor and check it out.","HossMcGraw","Dec 04, 2002"

The body of this beer is a little light for an Imperial Stout in my opinion (as is the a/v which is a mere 7%).  The body is medium at best.  However, this lends to a very easily drinkable Imperial Stout.  There are no hints of alcohol in the taste.  And the taste is very pleasant.  Nice chocolate tones.  Nice bittersweet tones.  Nice subdued burnt malt flavor.  And some bitterness to boot.  Dark fruits surface halfway through and molasses seems to be mixing things up a bit too.

Sweet, highly caramelized malt, vanilla notes, and sugary milk- chocolate hit the nose at first. They are followed by delectable smooth roasted unmalted barley coffee notes, mellow diacetyl butterscotch, and a hint of pruneish esters. The flavor is a superlative balance of roasted barley bitterness, perfectly calculated hop bitterness, chocolate malt, and malt deeply caramelized, anise laced sweetness from both the dark lovibond crystal malt and residual unfermented sugars. The body is dextrinous and full, but not overly rich. Finishes robustly bittersweet with lingering but pleasant diacetyl. I've forgotten how great this brew is.

This is the denser, thicker, more lustrous of the two, and the more alcoholic which is definitely noticeable right off the bat. In fact, it dispenses with the fruity, creamy, sweet character of the milder Taddy Porter for a spicier, more solid, and ultimately more satisfying experience.
