3.9,-6,4.25,3.5,4,4,4,"This is a decent beer. The chocolate taste is nice. I would have liked a more complex smell and taste. And perhaps a tiny bit more carbonation. Otherwise, a good Russian Imperial Stout.","mchegash","Mar 20, 2015"
4.41,6.3,4.75,5,4,4.75,4.25,"Pours a perfect black with a light brown/dark khaki head. 1 finger, some lacing. The nose is dark chocolate. Not pure cocoa but rather strong 75-80% dark chocolate because there is a sweetness in there. Some coffee notes but I can only really describe that as a Vienna roasted burnt coffee. It tastes very assertive at first but really smooths out as you go. At first it seemed a bit boozy but I was drinking it a bit too cold. As it warmed the complexity of this beer really came out. Creamy mouthfeel, perfect gentle carbonation. Finishes a bit sweet and malty and not roasted and bitter enough for my taste of Russian imperial stouts. This was a very good beer and it has some potency too at 10% abv.","MTLDOG",
