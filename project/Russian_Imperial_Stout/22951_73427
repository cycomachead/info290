3.62,-11.3,4.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Deep black in color. Poured with huge, dense, dark beige foam with excellent retention. Dark roasted malts, dark chocolate and dark fig and prune aromas with a definitive booziness. Light medicinal phenolics toward the end. Medium-full bodied with medium light carbonation and a lightly boozy heatness. Roasted malts and chocolate flavors with phenolic notes and astringency that push the drinkability limits. Lots of better RISs out there.","IronLover","Mar 26, 2015"

Taste: rich, fruity, espresso, fruity, some faint tobacco, alcohol on the finish  Some dark chocolate notes and the bitterness is more dark bitter chocolate than roast.  Mouthfeel: very creamy, chewy, medium low carbonation","pat61","Mar 19, 2015"
