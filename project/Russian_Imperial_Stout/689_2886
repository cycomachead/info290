3.3,-13.2,4,3.25,3.25,3.25,3.25,"Poured pitch black into a stemless wine glass (shoot me, my snifter was dirty), clean division between body and the cocoa-tinged head. Looks were the best quality unfortunately. Didn't live up to the IS moniker to me... slight roastiness and bitterness on the nose, with a weird smoky note too. Bit smoky and pleasantly bitter on the palate, actually the smokiness would be perfect if this was supposed to be a smoked beer)... lacked some of the bigger coffee and chocolate flavors I expect, and came off a bit thin on the mouthfeel. Upside is that the wife really liked it, and that has to be taken into account, I suppose. Wouldn't search this out, unless I was in the mood for a smoked porter.","Mikus","Feb 19, 2015"
3.85,1.3,4,4,3.75,4,3.75,"A bit too far on the sweet side, which is fine for half a glass but drinkability suffers.  A bit drier and I'd like this a whole lot more.  Solid, but falls short of great.","jds16","Feb 18, 2015"
