4.74,2.8,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,"Better than 2014 (in my opinion). 2014 was very bourbon-y, too much so, with not enough carbonation and less lacing. 2015 seems to be perfectly balanced, super heavy bourbon nose, but could not be more balanced upon tasting. Just a wonderful beer, and oh so glad I have more. Will be interesting to taste side by side with the 2013 and 2014 that has had some time to settle in.","MtnSoup",
