3.96,-3.2,5,4,4,3,4,"An opaque, muddy body is crowned by a beautiful mocha head leaving the mug awash in picturesque lacing. The aromas are of cocoa nibs, dark chocolate, and a definite sting of black coffee. Nice, slightly sticky mouthfeel, with a definite swing towards bitter coffee grounds on the taste, rather than the chocolate of some other stouts Iâ€™ve experienced. I give it a slight ding, for a mild, hard to detect metallic finish, but it is there and keeping this one from scoring a 9. Would I drink it again? You know it.","BeerWatcher","Mar 30, 2015"

It looks like I'm harsh in my numerical review - but I'm still giving the beer more than it deserves. Makes me wonder if I the keg was bad, actually. The worst part is how thin the beer is - a big imperial should have some viscosity.","Mantooth","Mar 22, 2015"

3.54,-13.4,5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"O: [3.50] This is really tasty beer.  It looks amazing in the glass.  The nose was a bit misleading for me (it had a great scent but it was different than the taste).  The taste is roasty malts and chocolate.  The alcohol is present and can be tasted - but isn't detracting on the taste.  The alcohol gives a bit of a dry finish.  Overall this is a good beer.  I think I would prefer to go with a Smuttynose Robust porter which has kick butt flavor at a much lower price and ABV.","fscottkey","Mar 16, 2015"
