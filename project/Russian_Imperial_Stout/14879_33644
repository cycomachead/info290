Lots of roasted malts, some coffee and some chocolate.  Light carbonation. The only turn off for me is the amount of alcohol that I'm sometimes picking up on the front.  It masks all of the things that I love about imperials.  I'm going to let one sit for a while and see if it softens.","RobPete","Feb 26, 2015"

It is slightly bitter but mostly sweet, with an emphasis on a cream flavor, I'm assuming because of the oatmeal.  It''s not super oily but has a decent thickness to it.  The bitterness is the first flavor to hit you, and has a mixture of coffee, cocoa, and malts.  This quickly morphs into a sweet creamy stout though and you can really taste the oatmeal.  Excellent beer, buy it if you come across it.","Pourharddrinkslow","Nov 23, 2014"

3.79,-10.4,4,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Pours black as a starless night.  Very good head, especially for 9.4% alcohol.  Retention is slightly below normal, as is lacing.  The nose is rather subdued, chocolate and coffee are noted over a light alcohol base.  As it warms, chocolate comes more forward as does vanilla, dark fruit and roast.  Light full body with a creamy texture.  Slightly above normal carbonation with effervescence in the middle and finish.  The flavor profile is intense, complex, but is not well balanced.  The alcohol is not hidden well enough.  It begins with a rush of coffee that quickly yields to a rich dark chocolate with notes of vanilla.  A bit of effervescence in the middle brings out the mild roast and hop bitterness.  The bitterness is citric in nature and fades into light dark fruit, mostly fig, notes with a bit of char and smoke.  Throughout alcohol is in the background, but as the flavors fade in the finish, it predominates.  Take the alcohol content down a bit, and this becomes outstanding.  As is, it's very good.","tillmac62","Nov 10, 2014"

I could not have asked for a much better one. It's thick, bold, and velvety; Everything you'd want in a RIS. The only thing I can nit pick about is the presence of alcohol which takes away from the aroma and taste a little bit. But on a cold winter day that could be complimenting. I could see this aging beautifully. Reminds me a lot of Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. Went perfectly with my Sarris chocolate bar. Not the best RIS I've had, but not too far behind either. A sipper of a beer. I'm looking forward to having this come winter. Holds its own next to the likes of Founders and Expedition. Highly recommended. Cheers!","Bone53","Jul 04, 2014"

Smells of heavy, chocolaty malt upfront with some dark fruity esters tagging along. Roasted malt and some nutty coffee joins a soft molasses and burnt sugar sweetness. Bold roasted malt flavor, semi-sweet chocolate, a little vanilla, and oats. The overall richness is kept in check, which is a good thing. Some coffee and fig. Mmmm...tastiness. Super creamy, plush mouthfeel, heavy, and chewy. I look forward to trying a fresher bottle sometime, as this one has been around a couple years, and I'm definitely interested in the variants as well.","wedge","Feb 13, 2014"

Aroma is deeply chocolatey at first, then opens up with some vanilla, caramel drizzle, soft alcohol, prunes, very faint candy orange, oatmeal cookies, and again very chocolatey. Taste is big. A lot of flavor in one sip... Chocolate liquor, oatmeal, molasses, charcoal comes to mind, figs, caramel, more chocolate. So much going on, harmoniously though. This is a sipper. Body is super heavy, thick and blankety. Smooth, broken up only by some piney bitterness. Carbonation is mellow underneath. A big beer with a lot of pleasant qualities, meant for slow absorption.","tastybeer","Feb 13, 2014"

Jet black pour with some mocha head that dissipates quick leaving thin ring around the glass but has nice sticking power with spotty legs after sips that maintains hold all along the side of the glass. Has a nice smell but a distinct dark fruit/vanilla aroma that slightly over powers the roasted dark chocolate. Can't put my finger on it but reminds me of prune. Taste amazingly roast and chocolatey in a non-sweet form that has a creamy feel","alaimoa","Jan 14, 2014"

IKEA black-brown, very slight orange-bronze head when poured, ... really, this looks like motor oil. Under several different conditions and settings, I could not detect any light shining through. But, it tastes like pure, unfiltered and uncompromised heaven. This is an outstanding stout. Balanced, smooth, almost chewy as it slides down your throat. I chilled this one too much. As a result, the nose was closed and the taste was like a shout without the nuances and subtleties you find in normal speech. After 20 minutes of exposure to room temperature (68 degrees), the aromas burst from this extraordinarily well made beer, and the complexities in the taste became apparent. Caramel, subtle molasses, caramel again. Subtle, nothing overwhelming, nothing dominates the flavor or the aroma. A perfectly balanced stout to warm your insides on a delightfully crisp autumn evening in Cincinnati.","rhamning","Oct 26, 2013"

If you are new to craft beer, this might be a nice "bridge" beer to bring you to the darker and heavier side of the stout world. At the same time, seasoned veterans of stout drinking should find this spot on for full-flavor enjoyment. Beautiful by itself but might breathe fresh life into cheesecake or pannacotta.","Zraly","Aug 25, 2013"

The mouthfeel is pretty velvety from the oats, so it really makes this beer mouth coating. Some fudge, cola and dark chocolate come in to play before a finish of burnt raisin, heavily roasted malt, and some slightly acidic dark roasted coffee. Maybe just a hint of earthy hops in the finish as well. Glad I finally got to try this one. Maybe I'm getting spoiled by all the monster stouts I've been drinking lately, but this one just didn't feel big enough for me. If they had beefed this up another 2-3%, I think it would have been perfect. As is, it's still one of the better versions of the style I've had and a really great beer.","notchucknorris","Jul 09, 2013"

Pours very dense pitch black color with a small fairly dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lacing cap that lingers. Slight spotty soapy lacing clings to the glass, with a nice amount of alcohol legs. Aromas of big dark chocolate, oatmeal, roasted malt, toast, coffee, toffee, molasses, vanilla, light char, dark bread, and light earthy hop spiciness. Fantastic aromas with huge complexity and balance of roasted malty notes. Taste of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, oatmeal, caramel, toast, coffee, toffee, molasses, vanilla, dark bread, light char, and light earthy hop spiciness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, toffee, molasses, vanilla, dark bread, light char, earth, and light earthy spiciness on the finish for a while. Fantastic flavor complexity and balance of roasted flavors; with a nice malt/roasted bitterness balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a thick, creamy, and slick mouthfeel that is excellent. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an incredible Russian imperial stout! Huge complexity and balance of highly robust roasted flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on. An incredibly enjoyable offering; one of the best RIS I have had for sure.","superspak","Jan 24, 2013"

The roastiness is there, but smooth, absolutely no bitterness. Finishes with underlying warming alcohol. Creamy and velvetly full-bodied, exceptional mouthfeel. Excellent variation on an RIS. A perfect example of how a "big beer" can subtlely deliver a very high level of complexity.","chanokokoro","Jan 23, 2013"

Big flavor with a really big blast of alcohol heat in the finish. Mouthfeel is disappointing; not only is it somewhat thin for the style, but I’m not getting any of the creamy/silkiness you normally get when oats are added to the mash. I was really looking forward to that component of the beer. Those complaints aside, the flavor was still good and I enjoyed the beer.

With the intense mix of booze, vanilla, creaminess, char, and fruit, one might surmise, by smell alone, that this was a barrel-aged beer. The depth is certainly there, and the nose is extraordinary with the buttery, creamy, milky sweetness to it. The taste and feel follow nicely, but this thin up slightly towards the end. The taste remained solid throughout, but tended to stray from the aroma in all of its saltiness, and general robustness and uniqueness. Still, this was a delicious beverage, making us even more excited for the real barrel-aged version, as well as the beastly D.O.R.I.S.","TheBrewo","Nov 10, 2012"

The flavor is sharp as a knife and gets more and more pungent as the tasting goes on. Surprisingly, the sweetness of the oatmeal is not used to cut the alcohol which instead makes the flavor profile come off as a very harsh raisin. It looks just beautiful however, which was the most impressive part of this stout. Frankly this beer is better for just a tasting as the flavors tire out the palate towards the end making it not nearly as enjoyable as it was towards the start. BORIS is necessary to try due to the creativity displayed, and I am sure I will have it again no matter the finish.","RussBecker1","Oct 23, 2012"

Flavor follows suit; a very sweet but rich oatmeal stout. A nice thick hit of sweet and bitter chocolate alongside some roastiness and mild coffee notes with a hit of alcohol showing itself. A thick, creamy mouthfeel that is quite awesome. Overall, a bit too sweet an oatmeal stout for my personal tastes.

I’m not into the harshness of a lot of Russian Imperials, so the “Imperial Oatmeal” idea really speaks to me, but I think there are better examples out there.

3.87,-8.5,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"O- One of the better imperial oatmeals out there. Complex and robust. This bad boy has later after layer of flavor and they almost all hit the mark. That said, it needs to be dialed in just a notch and it would give beers like FBS a good run for their money. If the hop bite was toned down a bit, body tuned up, this could be one of the best imperial stouts period. The more I drink the more I feel like this beer wants to be great, it just can't quite get there.","sentomaster","Feb 18, 2012"

Flavor beings with unsweetened chocolate, before moving to sweeter marshmallow and vanilla notes. Toasted cereal, molasses and mocha follow before a roasty finish. Silky smooth. Very cohesive flavor.

Smells roasty and sweet. Tastes great, definitely not too overbearing and I can probably finish a bomber without feeling too heavy or burdened with a sugar overload. This is a good buy for the quantity, quality, taste and ABV (10 bills). I actually prefer it over the barrel aged version.

There was almost no head when poured; it retains a trace amount of foam and lacing. The smell is faint- at first it smells only slightly of dark malt but I noticed a hint of oatmeal after a few seconds. It tastes of dark malt and molasses up front and then the slight bitterness of coffee towards the end. Only as an aftertaste did I notice any sign of the 9.4 percent abv.

Like most American craft breweries these days, Hoppin' Frog seems to have forgotten that not all ales need to be heavily hopped. The high hop bitterness of this beer distracts from the great roasted malt and oatmeal flavors it initially displays, making it seem a bit muddled and off-kilter. If the hops had been reigned in a bit, this would be a fantastic imperial stout, but as is, it's merely okay.","mrfrancis","Nov 30, 2011"

Bomber of beer made 1 state away is $9.99 locally and the much tastier, higher ABV, Duck Rabbit Rabid Duck Imperial Stout made in North Carolina is $1 more for a 6 pack of bottles. This is not a bad beer, just an overpriced one. Color is as any Imperial should be. Head is almost non existant. No lacing noted. Sweet chocolate, dark fruit and coffee are the overriding flavors. Does not do a good job of hiding the alcohol. This is its weakness and makes it much less drinkable than others. Average American Imperial.","beercar","Nov 23, 2011"

Halfway through the bottle as the glass warmed, the hops came through more and cut into some of the sweetness, preventing palate fatigue.

Slowly rolling out the bottle I found a thick dark flow, topped eloquently by a creamy, chocolate crown. Gorgeous. Head lingered a while to boot. Right up front on the nose there is a good mass of chocolate and booze, then behind, the oat and grain. In the mouth it warms, clinging with effervesence, coating the orafice with dark chocolates and fresh oats. The alcohol hides well in the flavor, but is apparent. Good hints of coffee compliment the warm nature. Nice voluptuous body makes this a wonderful beverage. Excellent tick. Competes strongly with the d.o.r.I.s. the destroyer.","SDDanC","Sep 24, 2011"

Overall, a barebones RIS but maybe I expected too much given friends recommendations and the rating on this site. The flavors are balanced nicely and complement each other minus the finish, which I don't think matched up to the rest of the present flavors.

B.O.R.I.S. has a dark, malty whallop, a thick body, a bass-line of hop bitterness, and the high alcohol content is very well-concealed. It's definitely not a brew that one would necessarily want to drink all night, but neither are its best bretheren from other breweries. I know the Dark Lords of the world must be great and all (I'm still trying to get my hands on one), but how much better can it get than this??? We're definitely splitting hairs at some point.

3.91,-7.6,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"O- A really good IRS. I didn't get all that much of the oatmeal quality as expected. Perhaps some age would help bring that out and also reduce some of the alcohol burn felt. At $10.50 a bomber a bit on the steeper side for the quality.","busterthecat","May 31, 2011"

4.2,-0.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours an opaque black with a 1 inch dark tan head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Tiny spots of lacing dot the glass on the drink down. Smells strongly of dark fruits with some milder dark chocolate and toasted oat aromas. A slight hint of soy sauce comes about as the beer warms. Taste is more stout forward than the smell. Rich dark chocolate, toasted oats, with a cookie dough aftertaste. Very nice. Low carbonation with a thick and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good RIS with some nice oat qualities.

I recalled really liking this beer last time I had it, and we inserted this as a "control stout" into our tasting of mostly well hyped imperial stouts. Going in, we thought we might end up ranking this one very high in the group. Found that I was a bit let down and it didn't hold up to my memories.

I know I don't dislike hops in Stouts, I just hadn't found a hoppy stout I liked yet, now I have. I just love the citrus hops in the background to balance things out and add a little depth, with the astringency kept to a minimum. There's absolutely none of the "chewying on grass root" finish in this I've grown to dislike in some hoppy stouts.

The beer has a smooth start of subtle chocolate notes followed quickly by a bitter blast of coffee. Slightly malty and syrupy finish with smooth and coffee flavored aftertaste, and a boozy highlight.

Slightly alcoholic aroma and usual suspects of deep, rich malt roast and mix of floral/grassy hops. Creamy, sweet oatmeal-raisin cookie with even some prune/plum tones. Alcohol is definitely there but well-blended with sugar and nice chicory finish. This coats well and takes balance of all in excess - natural sweetness, hop bitterness and solid chocolatey, coffee malt.

Poured pitch black with a minimal brown head that subsided to no head to speak of slowly. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, sweet malt, chocolate, and dark fruit. The flavor was of roasted malt, sweet malt, chocolate, dark fruit, and cream. It had a heavy feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a complete transformation of the regular brew. It has been in my cellar for a little over a year and there is no clue how long it was in storage before I bought it, but this thing was nice. As Mike stated, the alcohol burn was completely gone which allowed the dark fruits to open up in all their beauty that I had never experienced on this brew before. Definitely became a more complex and tasty brew with time. This brew really shocked me. An absolute MUST try if you can find the version to save yourself some time, or you can just throw a few in your own cellar and wait. Trust me, it is worth it!","thagr81us","Jan 17, 2011"

Smells like chocolate up front, some vanilla and oak in the back, minimal coffee, slight anise, but mostly chocolate. Taste is more complex; sweet malt up front that quickly changes to chocolate and coffee with a nice bitterness that cuts the sweet. Dark stone fruits covered in chocolate, dates, and dark bread. Mouthfeel is spot on for me, not cloyingly sweet and thick, but just about right- it could be a tad thicker.

Nice burnt coffee and dark chocolate in the nose. Taste is just the right balance of coffee notes, chocolate notes, and roasted malt notes, plus a wee bit of hop presence in the back. A little boozy, but I didn't mind that while watching Sunday football. It actually made me yell at the TV less, which rarely happens. This is a great all-around stout.

The palate was also softer and more appealing. A year of age has certainly done this brew well. Unlike the young bottle, I had no problem finishing this one by myself. A more persistent head would help the scores on this one, but that doesn't detract from the experience whatsoever.

Finger or so of head settles to an extremely thin layer with a collar. Aroma is of vanilla, molasses, roasted maltiness and a whiff of booze. Taste is fairly similar, leading with some roasty and boozy mouth and becomes an intricate mix of chocolate, molasses, a touch of coffee and alcohol that glides slickly over the tongue. Maybe a touch of dark fruits in the finish here, ends slightly dry also. This mouthfeel is unreal, like velvet on the tongue.

The taste is full of roasted coffee & oats, smoky malts, dark chocolate, toasted oats some dark fruit and an ever-so-slight alcohol burn.

While this beer is very viscous, I am not tasting a corresponding amount of intense flavor to back it up... a bit too boozy for my preference. This is by no means bad, just a little unbalanced.

The most negative thing that I can say about this beer is that there's almost no head. You can swirl one up - it's very dark even for a stout, a medium brown - but it dissipates quickly. The aroma is rich with roast and chocolate. There's just a ton of malt packed into this one. Vanilla bean, caramel and molasses round things out. This beer would be a great base for a beer float. The taste is also quite good. It's sweet with a warming finish. Roasty notes persist in the aftertaste. The feel is smooth and soft as a dog's ear. I like the low carbonation and it's definitely worth the lack of a head. It's a very easy beer to drink; my bomber is going fast.

The nose comprises dark coffee (complete with a light hint of olfactory bitterness), roasted and toasted malts, and charred wheat. Something seems off here, but I can't put my finger on it. Are the malts too blackened? I dunno, but it's something like that. The taste holds notes of dark chocolate syrup, coffee, blackened oats, and a slightly bitter aftertaste. A step above the nose, fer sure. The body is pretty thick 'n' chewy, but not too, with a moderate carbonation (higher than I expected, but, again, not too much so) and a decent oral coating.

The aroma is a welcoming blend of earthy sweetness and roasted malt. The flavor seems to be predominantly dark chocolate, though. And not "dark chocolate" in the sense of what Hershey's considers dark chocolate to be, either. Straight-up gourmet, 70% pure cocoa, who-pays-this-much-for-a-candy-bar dark chocolate.

The aroma is very roasty but also has a nice malty sweetness to it, and a tinge of citrus hops. Very intense nose on this one with bittersweet chocolate, licorice and coffee notes in there as well. The flavor is similar with a nice deep roasty stout flavor balanced with plenty of sweetness from dark malts. Dark dried fruits, burnt sugar, chocolate and licorice flavors are evident, as are some piney hop notes and a bit of booziness. This also has a bit of that black patent astringency thing going on. This is a big chewy stout with a full mouthfeel to be sure, but not as full or chewy as the best in the class. The finish is a nice balance between sweet and dry that leaves a pleasant lingering taste on my tongue. If I have one complaint about this beer, it is that for being an oatmeal stout, it seemed to be lacking that silky smoothness. Still a great beer and a nicely drinkable RIS.","zoso1967","Apr 25, 2010"

The aroma is unbelievably delightful with strong scents of oatmeal & coffee with the slightest scent of vanilla, almost as if it had been aged in a bourbon barrel. The taste is just as delicious as the aroma. A pleasantly smooth bitterness of oatmeal, chocolate, & a hint of coffee, balanced well by a slight vanilla undertone. The mouthfeel is almost as orgasmic as the taste. INCREDIBLY SMOOTH & creamy with just the right amount of carbonation to contribute some bite to the brew. This brew drinks unbelievably well, especially considering its 9.4%. Overall a magnificent brew. No question its in my top 5 easily.

Into a pint glass it pours pitch black with a small dark tan head. The head fades to almost nothing but it slightly there. No lacing to be found. The smell right off is really chocolatey followed by some roasted malts. There is also a small hint of coffee buried underneath as well. For the taste it's mainly chocolate, roasted malts, and coffee followed by alcohol. There is another underlying taste I can't quiet put my finger on, maybe it's the oats. A nice thick creamy mouthfeel. A bit higher ABV on this one which usually isn't noticeable to me but on this one it is though it still isn't a problem at least it's nice on this cold night.

Not really getting a lot of oatmeal, more winelike with pretty notable alcohol but not bad. Seems to go very well with cheese but I wouldn't call this a classic session brew.

Decent retention and some lacing left behind after dwindling down to a ring of a fine bubbles around the edge of the glass. Aromas of dark fruits (prunes, figs, raisin) mesh with earthy and herbal tobacco leaves. Layers of roastiness and chocolate liqueur also waft up. The taste brings the same load of succulent dark fruits up front, plus some concord grapes. Some of the herbal and tobacco notes add complexity on the midpalate before the finish brings out a bittersweet cocoa, cookies and biscuits, and some warming and herbal liqueur. Full bodied, slick, with a moderate yet fine carbonation. The taste both intense and outstanding, with remarkable drinkability for such a full flavored brew.

Smell is roasty and sweet with malt and oats, chocolate and toasted coconut. A superb light banana like fruitiness. Taste is full of mocha and mild chocolate. Coffee bitterness fuses with roasted oats to form a rich luxurious bed for the sweeter flavors to play out. Caramel and burnt sugar flow gently underneath. That faint banana again. Finish is smooth and mellow with a firm hop bittering that moves into a delicious dark bready malt lingering. It keeps the coffee and oats on the palate.

Nice resiny piney hop flavor in the back end. Slightly noticeable booze. Would have enjoyed a more robust malt presence, or tuned down fruit and herbalness.

The sweetness is excessive and overwhelming and really sticks on the palate in an unpleasant way. The flavor itself is nice, but lacks in roast character or even chocolate, instead relying on fruity caramel notes that are, admittedly, fairly enjoyable, if a bit out of character. I hate to complain about a beer being out of style, since nitpicking style guidelines really misses the point of enjoying beer, but for what it is worth this strikes me as closer to a Baltic porter than an Imperial Stout. Whatever you want to call it, this is cloyingly sweet and hard to drink and it doesn't quite have the complexity to make up for what it lacks in drinkability. It is a good beer, but it certainly doesn't live up to the hype. Worth a try, but I probably won't be coming back to it in the future.","nickfl","Sep 18, 2009"

Flavors are very strong in this brew again with the Coffee, chocolate and I would have to say mollasses.

Full-bodied is not quite adequate, it's a damn brick in the mouth, you almost feel like you have to spoon it into your mouth and then swallow hard to get it down. Heavy roast to the coffee, chocolate flavors, caramel and brown sugar too, still too heavy to truly be as sweet as it should be. Grape, cherry, plum fruit flavors only flirt with dried fruit characteristics. The carbonation is near unnoticeable. The licorice comes out at the finish along with a bit of floral mist and mint.

The smell seems to be overpowered with alcohol, with a bid of roastiness. Kind of like bad coffee, mixed in with the smell of black patent malt. Not a bad smell, but seems a bit harsh for an oatmeal stout. I kind of expected to smell more sweetness. The taste is much better than the smell suggests. There's immediately the oatmeal taste, I mean not like a bowl of oatmeal, but like beer oatmeal, if you know the taste. The taste kind of has the old, low quality coffee taste from the smell, which I guess comes from a low dose of roasted barley. I would like to taste a bit more. I can also notice this oiliness, which I think comes from black patent malt, which is pleasant in low doses. I can also get this chocolate taste, kind of toned down, but I think its at the right level with the oatmeal added. If I could make any suggestions, it would be to substitute some roast barley for the black patent, and I'll hold off a higher rating for that. The mouthfeel, as you would expect from an oatmeal stout, is spot on. So smooth and creamy. with just the right amount of sweetness. This doesn't even need carbonation, but its delightful.

4.6,8.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Aged 18 months in biegaman's cellar, thanks for sharing. Opaque shiny black with short tan head leaving a ring and wispy, large bubbles on the side surface. Held in a bright light, there are miniscule bubbles shooting up the side of the glass almost invisible to the naked eye in the jet black beer. There is a distinct chocolate smell along with sweet, candied dark fruit and more chocolate, a bit of fresh leather aroma. Taste is rich and nicely blended, ABV hardly noticed, layers of chocolate like a tiramisu dessert with a gentle bitterness and a long lingering, satisfying finish. I imagine that the hops have settled with time and the overall balance is remarkably satisfying, this conjures up memories of the Founders Breakfast Stout I enjoyed a bit over a year ago. Nicely done, an oatmeal imperial stout to savour, thanks again, Jan.","ThatWineGuy","Feb 16, 2009"
4.45,5.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"	I knew I was pretty much up a creek when I bought this bad boy tonight...I picked a bomber off the shelf and asked the clerk if he would recommend it. "You taking a lunch break" was his response. When I got it home I popped open the cap and dumped about half of it into my standard tasting glass; a 22 oz. crystal snifter. The head that was created was rich and creamy, like the froth from a freshly stirred glass of chocolate milk. Over the next few minutes it slowly dissipated, but left a thin film of carbonation across the top of the beverage. The color was jet black, the negative of light, absolute darkness. No life was able to penetrate its absolute darkness. The aroma was heavy, loaded with dark roasted malts, coffee, dark chocolate, and very few hops. Ditto's for the taste. There is such a malty sweetness in the beer that almost all of the hops are cancelled out. I've had very malty beers that were brewed with lager yeast and malty beers brewed with ale yeast, and I can say that I love the ale yeast. It's something about the yeast characteristic that draws me to this ale. Very robust and assertive, unlike a bock which has a like yeast profile and uber malts to back it up. Communism does suck the Almighty Big One, but this beer is truly a grand gift from the Czars.","steelcutoats","Feb 14, 2009"

A big whiff reveals sweet hops and the slightest hint of alcohol that just gets me more interested. This beer has absolutely fantastic body to it. Just chewy enough without becoming cloying and "heavy", slick and smooth as all hell. The taste is explosive as well. Big blast of chocolate and a pleasant and welcomed nutty-ness begins it right upfront, then some creamy coffee notes and ripe fruits invade next, followed by a slight hop bite and its subtle bitterness balanced by a bready, pie crust like, finish. Wonderful after taste of ripe cherries, smoke and sweet chocolate malts. Fantastic, without a doubt a well made beer. This beer was everything i hoped it would be and more. A 22oz bomber is an ideal serving size for a beer as tasty as this. Dont let the 9.4% ABV scare you this ones a paper tiger when it comes to an alcohol burn. Well done.

Quarter-inch mocha-colored head dissipated into a thin slick of tiny effervescing bubbles; lacing was almost non-existent during the tasting. Very sweet nose consisting of brown sugar, chocolate, toffee. Taste consistent with nose, with the addition of some dark fruit detectable as the brew warmed and a pronounced hops bitterness indicated at the finish. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and slightly viscous with a subtle carbonation to add some additional character. Alcohol was fairly well-hidden, but presented slightly as it warmed.

This is the last of the good number of Hoppin' Frog brews I grabbed on a trip to Philadelphia a couple months back. Ohio's Hoppin' Frog beers are rating pretty high for me at this point, their one misstep being the "Golden Fraug" I reviewed a little while back. The BORIS, which is a gigantic beer in a Brew Dog style session beer's clothing is not one to be taken lightly. This is a straight up mind eraser of a beer that has a good amount of bitterness to balance out the insanity of the normal pantheon of "dark" flavors - coffee, smoke, chocolate, and the kinds of fruits you find in dried form in a typical geriatric kitchen cupboard. The body is very nice and it pours black as ink with a chocolatey looking head, not unlike another Brew Dog favorite, Oskar's Ten Fiddy, and it has the right amount of carbonation, which is key to this style.

Nutty flavors along with the light caramels, toffees, and a hint of cherries woven late into the alcohol warmth give the beer its charm without muddling. Very rich, viscous, and downright chewy textured, but smoothed to a velvety touch by more than just a little bit of oats. These round the beer out perfectly.

Finish is bitter and roasty with lots of coffee expression as well as a touch of citrus hops. Thick and full bodied, smooth and creamy with low carbonation. A good balance and a great transition from sweet to bitter, not overly crazy with different flavors popping out at inappropriate times.

This beer is the one to impress said beer geek. There are many solid RIS on the market, this is right up there with the elite. Pours a deep, deep brown with a light brown head that began thick and full and disippated into a nice tan 1/8" layer, but with no real lacing to speak of. Aroma is strong with dark chocolate and roasted malts, with a little burnt sugar smell in the background. The flavor is HUGE! It has a serious dark chocolate thing going on, bittersweet, with a sweetish creamy undertone. The balance between the creamy sweetness and roasty bitterness is outstanding. The mouthfeel is tremendous. I have had too many stouts of late that have great flavor with a mouthfeel that is too thin. Not so with B.O.R.I.S., huge, huge, huge, so thick and full.

The nose smells of good hops and oats. taste follows with great roasty malt flavors, good solid oatmeal presence and a wonderful hop character on this finish. The hop character in this one is about perfect, similar to TenFidy in that way. Not too bitter and not overmalty either. Mouthfeel is a touch thin on this one, but still quite good. Drinkability gets highest marks here as the abv is completely hidden. If it wasn't for the intensity of the flavors here you would never think this was imperial.

Taste was also fantastic, very nice roasty character with oatmeal creaminess and chewiness making an obvious presence. Very full mouthfeel, and on the sweeter side of an imperial stout, which I tend to like. I got a big marshmallow like character in the taste as well and overall this was an amazing beer.

The taste was again very sweet with more of a creamy milk chocolate rather than mild dark chocolate. There were hints of coffee and vanilla as well as some licorice and lactose. This was a very well balanced imperial stout that had a good creamy mouthfeel and just the right carbonation.

Now enters Hoppin' Frog and all is right in the world. Appears pitch black motor oil that absolutely absorbs every band of the visible light spectrum where everything fades to black. Head is a dark brown mocha hue, forms thick. With my first gulp of the brew head is left evenly all around my Southern Tier pint glass. Aromatics bring out deep roasted malts with coffee and dark chocolate and the oatmeal adds that layer of cereal grain softness to the mix, while herbal hops flow as well. Sweet decadent creamy burnt marshmallows with singe of alcohol tickling the ol' nares. Flavor a rolling wave of oatmeal and roasted malt sweet and roasted malt bitterness. Creamy sweet syrup added to a bowl of plain oatmeal, with cocoa powder and flame roasted marshmallow added to the mix that's what this beer tastes like. After your first few sips you think where's the hops because in flavor only minimal herbal balancing hop flavor survives the malt trip, but by the third or fourth sip the hop burps arrive and you realize where those sixty international bitterness units are hiding. Huge yet perfectly balanced beer sweet and creamy yet roasty and hoppy, the ying and yang of all dark beers. Mouthfeel is huge creamy borderline custard at times, carbonation rolls sluggishly trying to move that high gravity around, you can tell when you watch the pour. It takes awhile for the head to form even after a vigorous pour. Drinkability is effortless even after 22oz I could have another glass. I learned this after having it on tap before it arrive in Pittsburgh. I made a beer run up to Boardman, OH to visit Ron Bush at his Diamond Bar where Boris was flowing. A couple glasses later had me owned by this brew, my second meeting with this fine brew came at Smokin' Joe's in the South Side after a Pirate's game, needles to say I tried to make this brew a session beer....I know I know...respect beer.

I get an almost syrupy dark chocolate over a vanilla-cherry alcohol that reminds me of an oak treated product. At the bottom of that chocolaty goodness is the roast oat aroma. Lightly carbonated, a tang of alcohol, the mouth feel is medium light, but what i am really drawn to is the 'coating' effect that is unforgettable; like my favorite Double Stouts. Full flavored, the oat chocolate oak treated-like taste is outside the box. There is a wonderful complexity to the flavor combinations that lingers appropriately and invoke involuntary lip smacking reflexes.

3.65,-13.7,4,4,4,3.5,2.5,"Pours very dark, very thick and with little to no foam, no matter how high I poured the bottle from to try and create some. The aroma is just like a well crafted RIS should smell like: roasted and chocolate malts, coffee and vanilla notes, very clean and intense. Time to taste this bad boy. Its a deceptive beer Ill say. Deceptive in the way that it shows hardly any carbonation and yet once you take a sip of this your mouth tingles from it. Its a BIG beer. The coffee is intense and also the chocolate and roasted malts, but the only drawback is that the alcohol is noticeable enough to worry me if Ill be able to finish this bomber while Im getting sleepy. As the beer warms up the alcohol seems to overpower in the aroma. The mouthfeel is rich and velvety only a bit too much carbonation. The more I sip it the more I get the alcohol in the taste and aroma which reminds me more and more of liquor, which I find that hard to tolerate now. The biggest drawback of this beer, for my taste is the strong alcohol presence. This beer is just not for me, but at least I got to try it.","seaoflament","Aug 26, 2007"

4.38,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A pitch black color, with a dark brown colored head forming, about an inch thick. Visually this beer looks thick, almost like oil. The scent of sweet malt, with chocolate and coffee fragrances, plus the sweet fragrance of oatmeal. That is followed by a dried fruit, mostly currants and raisons, there is the slightest twinge of alchol at the end. The malt and oatmeal starts at the front, then a coffee bitterness hits midway, then it has a bit of a citrus twange at the back of the palate. The oil look is deceiving, when it hits the mouth it is a lighter feel at the front and rolls to the back, gain weight to its texture along the way. There is a bit of warming feel of alchol at the end. This a very, very good beer, the usual suspects one would find in imperial stout, but the edition of oatmeal makes it sweeter and smoother. This just beckons one to drink this beer, a great sipping beer.","cameraman","Aug 12, 2007"

Stickiness is amazing, all over the sides of the glass. Smell, now this is how an Imperial Stout should smell. Sweet toasted oat is what mostly dominates the nose followed by a milk chocolate mixed with brown sugar. A nice roasted nut smell and a tiny hint of alcohol seem to tingle the nose as well. Taste is a bit of a shock. Lots of smokey, pitch black french roast coffee off the tongue first thing followed by a very woody/caramel malt. Finish and aftertaste is a bit sweeter, luckily, with a nice oatmeal and sugar flavor. I really didn't expect the taste of this one to be so smokey. Mouthfeel is creamy and full bodied with minimal carbonation. Big warming sensation while it slides down the throat. Warming comes from the alcohol but it isn't overwhelming by any means.

Roasty coffee aroma, rich maltiness, caramel, nuts, chocolate, vinous fruit, and mild alcohol - quite nice. Relatively low bitterness when balanced against the huge caramel character. Roasted coffee flavours sat on the back of the palate, and notes of sour cherry and dark chocolate filled out the middle. Kind of doughy with mild alcohol flavour throughout.

Feel is silky smooth, full body, slightly dry finish. Good drinkability despite girth and high abv.

I think that the oatmeal provides for a creaminess that you usually don't get from this style of beer. This is now my favorite big stout that I can get in these parts.","SAAZbrewer","Dec 30, 2006"
