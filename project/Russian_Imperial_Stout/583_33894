4,-1.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured too cold from a 750ml bottle.  Less than a finger of head.  Dissipated quickly.  Pours a deep purplish black like a deep BlackBerry.  Dark chocolate, roasted malts, vanilla and bourbon in the nostrils.  Dark fruit but can't place it.  Raisins?  Guessing straight KY bourbon but it does over power the aforementioned flavors.  However, I like the taste of bourbon so this isn't bad to me.  Too thin in the mouth unfortunately.  Bourbon down followed by dark chocolate, vanilla, hops and roasted malts but bourbon aftertaste.  If it was creamier, I'd love it.  Letting it warm up.  Improves the flavors in the nose and mouth.  Not bitter.  A good effort.  No idea what the abv is but I'm guessing high.","uvachief","Jan 17, 2015"

4.09,0.5,4.25,4.5,4,3.5,4,"O. A good BA stout. The are better and certainly worse. I like the way the hops mesh with the other variables to create a bitter coffee character. I dig the smell but the taste and feel fall short from the booze on the end. It's not as hot as others, but enough to influence the overall scores.","macher0","Dec 31, 2014"
