4.5,4.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall: This bad boy is $20 a bomber around me, so its nice to try this 9oz i got on tap for $5. It offers a lot in what you would expect in a great BA stout. I could use a little more body but thats nitpicking. It really opens up as it warms and is another beast all together.  Highly recommend this offering","Bone53","Feb 25, 2015"

4.12,-4.2,4.25,4,4.25,4,4,"I get the faint smell of whiskey right off the bat. The pour looks like a nice dark stout but not too thick. Thin layer of tan head with darker brown gathering on the outsides, especially after a drink...nice color balance. Mouthfeel is a stout on the thin side which is welcome after having overly thick imperial stouts. Taste has nice full "earthy" flavor combining wood, nuts, and coffee with a finish of just a touch of whiskey. Easy to drink and very enjoyable.","ctjoumas","Feb 10, 2015"
