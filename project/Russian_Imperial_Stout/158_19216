Serious chocolate notes came through immediately, nice roasty flavor. I didn't get any sense of the barrel aging, not sure if there are supposed to be hints of bourbon or anything but if there is I certainly did not pick up on it. Tasted like a big stout with strong hints of chocolate. Made my wife scrunch up her face in disgust when she tasted, I savored every pull.","Jwburns75","Mar 28, 2015"

Notes of chocolate and vanilla, mild oak, bitterness (go Yeti), and a hint of smoke/tobacco on the nose. Flavors really came through will all of the above mentioned players (aromas)  at the party on my tongue. Especially dominant were the chocolate and bitterness, and overall nice balance prevailed. Will have to try this again, I feel like I scarfed it a bit quickly because it was so good! Imagine that more flavors might have emerged... man was this tasty. Medium to hearty mouthfeel as expected. This was a 'NAILED IT' type of beer. Not to mention half-price on Mondays so it put me back about $3. Cheers. Find this.","Mikus","Dec 23, 2014"

I had the same beer about six months ago and I'm not sure but it may have been younger than this beer and i remember it had a lot more bitterness to it. This beer is perfectly balanced, it has warmed to almost room temp now and is getting better as I drink it.

This beer is instantly my favorite stout to date and a contender for the best beer I've had. Looks picture perfect, awesome balance with both flavors and aromas, and smooth as silk. Much better than the chocolate oak aged yeti, and my favorite in the series so far. I've always said that the perfect beer has big, bold American flavors and viscosity with English balance and smoothness, which i think I found here. HIGHLY recommended!!","Bone53","Jun 30, 2014"

4.4,3.3,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 11/14/2011. Pours dense pitch black color with a 2 finger dense dark brown head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, caramel, toast, molasses, char, light smoke, oak, light clove, vanilla, herbal, and oak/roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, oak, and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, caramel, toast, char, molasses, light smoke, oak, light clove, vanilla, herbal, and oak/roasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy herbal/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roast, caramel, toast, char, molasses, light smoke, oak, vanilla, and oak/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of big dark/roasted malt and moderate oak flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, silky, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is incredible. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible oak aged imperial stout. All around fantastic complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and moderate oak flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 10, 2014"

Also, mild compared to the bourbon barreled aged beers so you can have more than one of these and walk straight (although not many more than one). Poured pitch black on tap into a full 16oz pint glass. The top 10% of the pour was brown lacing. Very malty taste on the tongue, mild bitterness very drinkable beer. Not overpowering with the alcohol content although it is around 10%abv. Left rings on the glass after each sip like an exceptional wine.Excellent beer by an excellent brewery.

The smell features a surprising floral hop presence along with toasted malts, caramel, chocolate, coffee, wood, and vanilla. It lets you know you are about to taste an unbelievable, massive stout. Tasting it, at the beginning I get a chocolate and toasted malt flavor which is soon met with a charred wood characteristic and an herbal hop bite that leaves a moderately bitter aftertaste. The alcohol is definitely noticeable but the beer is quite drinkable, with a medium body and a creamy mouthfeel. After one glass, I'm ready to list it among my favorites.","itsscience","Nov 07, 2013"

Less smoky and charry. But who knows, aging does weird things and palates do weird things over the years too. It's still quite good but I think the regular and chocolate oak aged yetis stand above its fellow variants still. Depends on what you're looking for I guess. Having said that, with three years on this one it goes down like silk and the flavors are very well integrated. Very tasty and drinkable.","Dope","Jul 08, 2013"

A year earlier and it probably would have been a non-factor. A year later and it might be too much. Glad to have finally had this one; I'll have to try another one fresh to see how things have changed. My least favorite of the Yeti series so far, but still a good beer when all is said and done.","tectactoe","Jul 01, 2013"

Robust aroma of bakers chocolate, toasted oak, fusel alcohol, and loads of roasted malt. Huge dark chocolate, dried black cherries, toasty oak, hint of molasses. The finish brings bitter espresso bean accents combined with bold hops and pleasant toasted oak with dark chocolate tones. Big, creamy, smooth full body. Gentle, perfect carbonation. Another exceptional variation of the original Yeti.","chanokokoro","Mar 24, 2013"

I now taste the vanilla that was to be imparted but I feel that it is at the cost of too much oak. It really should show some more fruit complexities i.e. raisins and cherry. It is a little too blunt. However, it is a really good beer with one bad element. As it starts to thin out and warm up, the flavor subsides and the alcohol livens.","artoolemomo","Mar 20, 2013"

This makes a great sipper with plenty of character that won’t bludgeon you to death, but stands up to the style easily.","fmccormi","Jan 28, 2013"

The oak flavor comes out and mixes in the vanilla well into an already great beer. I do not know whether or not its an upgrade, its different and really good but I don't know if its better as I really like the the original roasted coffee flavor that is somewhat muted. Regardless I really wanna try the expresso version and am now even willing to try the belgian version if I see it around.","Pinknuggets","Dec 07, 2012"

4.06,-4.7,5,4,4,4,4,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the gorgeous appearance, and the rich aroma translating well into flavoring. The pour puts up an insanely dark, robustly colored beer, with a massive foam tower for a head. Once you can finally get your sniffer close enough for an assessment, the aromatics blossom with an wide array and deep complexity. The flavors seems most of these through, and the feel keeps up nicely as well. This is a well-rounded beverage, and one to certainly seek out. As this is a fresh 2012, we will be looking forward more, but with a little age on its belt.","TheBrewo","Dec 03, 2012"

Smell is a cup of the best roasted coffee you have ever had. Perfectly balanced notes of roasted grains and sweet molasses and caramel. Coffee and chocolate hit the nose at the same time with each synergistically highlighting the other. Taste is out of the park. the best latte you ever had does not come close to this. Huge coffee front yields to a sweet molasses and caramel body. Notes of vanilla and light oak and wood in the back. Finish is dry and clean with a touch of coffee bitterness. Hops are well integrated and of the earth variety. Feel is lush and satisfying. Just enough lightness to make it supremely drinkable and at the same time demanding of respect.

3.88,-8.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The flavors are more layered, as bitter-sweet chocolate gives way to earthy tones of tea-like hop-oil and a woody undertone. Notes of carob, vanilla, tobacco and meaty smoke poke through. Hop astringency works to dry the palate, keeping it somewhat refreshed between sips. Not as chewy as some of its barrel-aged brethren, allowing for easy parsing of flavors. Ends with a long, bitter-sweet finish, chocolate notes lingering.","rand","Aug 29, 2012"

4.65,9.2,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Great Divide Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout, 22 oz. bomber: I have had a few outstanding stouts lately, which sets the bar pretty high, but the Oak Aged Yeti cleared the bar easily to join the outstanding club. The Yeti pours like a moonless night, with a dark tan head on top, and offers a big aroma for those inclined to get a nose into the glass. A huge flavor coat the palate and sticks. Chocolate, mocha, espresso all swirl about. The flavor lasts and keeps changing long after the sip. The Yeti has one of the most enduring and nuanced aftertastes I have experienced. Very much in the running for top Imperial Stout. And when I think of the competition: Oskar Blues Ten Fidy, Stone Russian Imperial Stout, Northwest Brewing Old Rasputin, my mouth is watering at the memory of them! High praise for the Yeti to join these ranks.","iSip","May 16, 2012"

Settles into a thin layer of bubbles after 5 minutes. Smell dark chocolate, roasted coffee, molasses, and some carmel. Taste is really balanced with dark chocolate and carmel, then gives way to bitter roasted coffee and some oak in the nose and the taste. Body is on the larger side, nice life for the ABV, on the dry side, and surprisingly drinkable, no real alcohol in the profile, bit feels bigger than its ABV says.

If I have to nitpick, I would say that despite the complexity of the flavor, the aforementioned slight vegetative bitterness gave the beer a faint astringency that did not complement the style well. For that reason alone, I wouldn't rate this RIS as highly as a few other RISs I have tried (e.g., Founders Imperial Stout), but it is still excellent and fans of the style should seek it out. Stouts simply don't get much better than this one and there's a lot to like about it. I think what I like best is that I have 2 more bottles of it down in my cellar!","deadonhisfeet","Jan 21, 2012"

4.27,0.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a solid black hole of color with a smallish coffee head that slowly dissipates and sticks much lace. Smells of coffee, chocolate, roast, licorice, vanilla, oak, smoke, earthy hops, a hint of ethanol. Now this is more like it. Taste is roasted grains, bitter dark chocolate, creamy espresso, licorice smoke, earthy herbal hop flavor, a bit of vanillin. There's a lot going on here, and its all good. Finishes with a long lingering mocha, alcohol, and hop bite. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a smooth oily/creamy mouthfeel. This is a great stout, one that I really should indulge with more often.","johnnnniee","Jan 07, 2012"

Medium bodied, and slowly sippable. The oak doesn't dominate, if anything the hops and roast combine forces to pull a hefty 1-2 punch of bitterness that sticks with you long into the aftertaste.

The bottle in review here is barley over a month since bottling and already the cap has rust both on the outside and inside, to the extent that I felt uncomfortable pouring the beer without first having to wipe as much rust as I could from the bottle's lip.

At any rate, poured from a bomber into a 5 oz. snifter. Pours an ominous black with a thin, quickly dissipating espresso like foam. Light lacing clings to the glass as the beer recedes down the sides as it's drunk. The nose is loaded with chocolate, vanilla, and a touch of coffee and toffee. Perhaps some spiced fruit in there too. The taste is outright sublime. This is the good stuff right here. Top notch. A perfect blend of the aforementioned smells, along with a hint of booziness, and the presence of the oak. You can definitely detect the woodiness imparted by the barrel in this, and it's subtle and refined. The mouthfeel is very good too. There's a bit of an alcoholic overtone to it, but the finish is smooth nonetheless. This isn't the thickest nor the thinnest stout I've had. Right about in the middle. Overall, this is extremely enjoyable, and I'd definitely have this again.","Retail1LO","Nov 30, 2011"

It also had a nice balance of bitter and sweet. Definitely not a session beer though, at 9.5% a bomber of this had me sitting with a dumb and pleased smile on my face. Drink this beer... It's a wonderful cold weather beer.","ccarney2","Nov 28, 2011"

3.7,-13.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a thick impenetrable black with a dense finger of dark brown foam sitting atop. Decent retention, and pretty good lacing which takes on a strange pattern of dots on the glass wall. Smell is in-your-face roasted malt and dry oak, medium roast coffee, and a little dark chocolate. Unfortunately, the beer seems to pick up the flavor of oak without any of the vanillin or spice notes. Taste is again pretty oaky and a lot of roasted malt, some cream, and some dark fruit as it warms (plum, blackcurrant). I didn't notice alcohol per se. The body is quite thick and chewy, and carbonation is light. Overall, this is a really big stout, pretty good flavors. The beer is very dry, so I think it would pair quite well with a rich dessert.","pmarlowe","Nov 02, 2011"
3.95,-7.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Shared with MsRif, I thought this was actually quite comparable to the Chocolate Oak-Aged Yeti. Poured into a pint glass a deep dark black color, thick, with a nice two fingers of chocolate mousse for a head. This sank down a bit during the session, and left a little lacing behind. Aroma of roasted dark malts, cocoa, and hints of oak. Rich taste of dark malts and cocoa, oaked vanilla provided some woodiness up front, but it mellowed out quite a bit. Slightly bitter finish with a touch of earthiness. Medium mouthfeel, not quite as rich and full as its chocolaty brother, but still very good, and quite drinkable.","Rifugium","Nov 02, 2011"

4.35,2.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I have yet to have a beer in the Yeti series that I haven't enjoyed but this is my fav, so far (haven't had the chocolate, BA, yet). Pours thick and dark with a 1/2" nice mocha head. The smell is all oak with some bitter chocolate and roast backing it up. The taste is oak and bakers chocolate. This thing will do a number on the back edges of your tongue. It's a bitter ride but smooth and with layers of flavor poking through. The mouthfeel is smooth and thick like a Double Stout should be. I generally like my doubles to have a bit more sweetness (just personal prefernce) but this one doesn't have much of that but the ballance of the brew doesn't make me miss it much. Like I said at the beginning, I like this better than regular Yeti (which I think is a great value year-round double stout) or the Espresso Oak Yeti (coffee was a bit too oxidized tasting for me). This is a wonderful, not light, but a kick in the kisser stout. If you like GI Nightstalker this a definate must-try.","plumcrazyfx","Jun 29, 2011"

Smells of cocoa powder, roasted dark malt, and some vanilla/oak aromas.. Taste is very woody at first. The oak chips that the beer was aged on are the prominent taste followed by cocoa powder and dark malts. There is a very earthy dirt/wood aftertaste on the palate after each sip. Mouthfeel is very thick and creamy. A very rich beer indeed. Overall, this is probably my least favorite of the Yeti beers I have tried so far (I only need the barrel aged one to complete the entire series) but still a very good stout in its own right.","UCLABrewN84","May 23, 2011"

This Yeti, aged on oak chips, is less of a narcissist than some of the others, but it does all that is expected of it with some finesse. The wood has a smoothing effect and it lends its own distinct sensory qualities, but it tends to blur the focused roasted malt character of the original.","beagle75","May 03, 2011"

The beer is a very intricate blend of sweetness, including chocolate and molasses, with bitter coffee and oak essences. The flavors are extremely well balanced, and ride in on a smooth, creamy, and boozey body. This beer leaves a chocolatey lacing all over your glass, and the same consistency of the head that lingers all the while you are drinking. The aftertaste is a bit booze and a bit dark chocolate and all delicious. The finish lingers a bit, but mostly booze flavors after a while. Very tasty, and intoxicating at the same time.

Chocolate, vanilla, and coffee dominate while the back palate carries a little bit of an earthy hop bite. Mouthfeel is heavy, but not as heavy as you would think judging by the color and how this beer pours. Just the right amount of carbonation helps carry this beer.

Taste- Wow. This is one of those beers that is perfectly balanced and all the smells come through in the taste. A taste bomb for sure. The flavor lingers for a while afterwards, which is nice. VERY smooth, and I don't really taste the alcohol even though it's a whopping 9.5%. The drinkability of this big Imperial Stout is off the charts.

The lacing doesn't quite live up though, keeping the look from being quite perfect. The nose is had a solid balance of dark chocolate and roasty grains. There's also a strong citrus hop presence. Hoppy stouts aren't really my bag, so we'll see how this goes. The great dark chocolate aroma fades a little on my palate, replaced by that general roastiness. Coffee makes itself known, but just barely. Even more than the nose the citrus hops really come through too much here. I prefer my imperial stouts to be malt driven, so this oneis a litle bit of a miss for me. Further accenting the the relative lack of maltiness, is that the body is incredibly light for a 9.5% imperial stout. I'd really like to see a bit more heft behind it. Desipte the light body, the carbonation is just barely there. I suppose it's passable, but just so. Any less and the beer would end up being a bit too syrupy. I can see how some people would like Oak Aged Yeti, but hoppy stouts aren't a favorite of mine, and the oak aging does little to smooth it out.","axeman9182","Feb 01, 2011"

A light amount of hoppiness and espresso in the nose as well. Great smelling beer! Taste is initially a bit hoppy with some bitter chocolate and espresso bean flavors. It's immediately followed by some smooth oak flavors with subtle vanilla (not as much as the nose implied). Finishes with a bit more bitter chocolate for a nice clean finish.

Taste is really subdued compared to a fresh version, really amping up the drinkability. Flavors have really melded together, making for one long flavor, as opposed to getting different hints from start to finish like normal. Vanilla is still a key component and is in good balance; it has neither intensified nor diminished. Body feels thinner and the carbonation is lower.

Thick, oily mouthfeel with more carbonation than most RIS examples I've tried, with a bitter and bold aftertaste.

More smells with chocolate and cocco, light black coffee, alot of roasted malt, some molasses and faint vanilla. A small amount of hops reminding me of a light storm king. Taste is in one word balanced and very well so. Chocolate sweet, not overly bitter, roasted malt, vanilla, oak, semi wood, light coffee,very well done. The body is big and smooth and textured.

Has the slightest of slight dark brown edges when the liquid gets a little thin. It pours with a dark creamy head almost a reddish dark brown color, maybe caramel. The smell is great, much like chocolate, dark roasted coffee and hops, wonderfully balanced. Is there such a thing as chocolate hops? That's something I think of in both the taste and the smell. The taste starts of sweet from the chocolate, it's probably semisweet, not really bitter sweet. There is certainly a bitter finish, I'd say from the hops and the coffee flavor together. A pretty hoppy Russian Imperial Stout, not as much as Old Rasputin, but it's still very hoppy for this style. Not too hoppy, again well balanced. The mouthfeel is good, full bodied and incredibly smooth. Drinkable in general, especially for a Russian Imperial Stout. All in all I'm a big fan of this beer.

It has a roasty aroma, like mocha, oak and smoke. It's full bodied, very soft and very smooth with a pretty clean finish. It tastes like oak, oak, and oak. Besides the oak, there's some coffee and salmiakki and smoke. This would be fun to cook with, like in a mushroom gravy, because it's so food-like. The flavor lasts a long time. This is one those all-night beers, because you can take a sip and enjoy it for a quarter hour then take another sip. The other flavors get to compete with the oak once it warms up.

As it warms it becomes more bitter. The body is not as full as the flavor dictated, but a slight oilyness is present. A lingering bitter aftertaste slouds things up a touch.

I drank this one relatively fresh (Bottled 10-30-09), and I think it could use some age. I've loved the fresh Yeti that I've had, and honestly, I feel that the oak aging here steals away some of the complexity in regular Yeti. Still a fantastic beer, just a bit one-dimensional as the oak again drowns out the other flavors. MF is big creamy and oily like regular Yeti, and is near perfect. In spite of the robust flavors, high ABV, and big body, this is a damn drinkable beer as well. Loved Yeti and Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti, and this is up there too. Definitely worth seeking out for the RIS lover.","LordAdmNelson","Jan 17, 2010"

The aroma was sweet and malty but also had some hoppy bitterness in it that balanced it out. The aroma was present but not aggressive or particularly pungent. Had it been a little more present I would have given it a full 5 because what is there is definitely complex. The taste has a sweetness that I normally wouldn't care for, but it balances out the flavor extremely well. A very subtle beer that is well-balanced between bitter and sweet which creates a sophistication and complexity within the flavor. The mouthfeel is smooth and slightly creamy.

The retention is pretty nice and the glass is coated with lacing as I drink it down. Random clouds of coffee brown are left on the top of the beer once the head dies down. The smell is pretty standard for a Russian Imperial Stout. I get a lot of toasty malts, chocolate malt and some coffee notes, probably from some of the malt. The oak becomes more present as it warms up, nice. There are a fair amount of hops in the nose in this one. I dont get any alcohol on the nose, fairly impressive for an RIS. The taste on this one is awesome. Huge notes of roasted malts. Coffee and cocoa are in the background to balance this one out perfectly. The huge hops help add a nice element to the huge malty taste. The taste really gets good when you add the oak into this. This beer is something that every RIS fan should try, also a great way to figure out what oak can be used for. No alcohol in the taste either. The mouthfeel is right on par for a beer of this caliber. The body is thick and oily, the carbonation is medium (I wouldn't mind a bit less). The alcohol warming is pretty nice here, not overpowering. There is a massive coat of oak and cocoa left on the tongue. Drinkability is great. The taste pretty much tells the DB here. The price is not bad for a beer of this quality, the alcohol or any of the tastes are not overpowering. I will buy this one again and age it when it comes back to my area.","cbutova","Dec 31, 2009"

The head slowly reduces but sticks around for almost the entire thing, leaving a decent amount of lacing on the glass. Smell for me was chocolate right of the bat, it was pretty strong and at first it was all i was getting. After a bit I was able to get some coffee aromas as well, pretty much reminded me of the regular Yeti. Taste was chocolate and coffee. Mainly the chocolate was there with a hint of coffee in the aftertaste. Though, once this one warmed up a bit some vanilla became quite apparent in the taste from the oak. I'd say let this one warm up just a little before drinking it if not quite a bit as it really shines once it warms up. Drinkability is great as this one is very tasty and the alcohol is pretty well hidden. I think I had one sip where I could get a faint taste of alcohol but it wasn't bad at all. Overall this one is great. I love the regular Yeti and have been dying to try the others and finally opened one up tonight.

It was slightly thicker than fresh, too. Overall this was a magnificent beer. It's already changed character over the past year, with less oak and more sweetness and maltiness.

The mouthfeel is very impressive, Like i said, it coats the mouth and is a pretty thick beer, which really works. Very good and drinkable for such a beast.

Oozing forth from a 22 oz. bottle, the head was somewhat slow to develop - as though the bubbles couldn't escape the thick liquid - then gradually over-topped the tulip with thick, light-brown foam. You'd better think twice about drinking this one - it packs the wollup of a six-pack or more of typical beer in one bottle. Nearly put my lights out. Surprisingly easy to drink for such a large beer. I could distinquish mocha, vanilla, and a hoppiness that nicely balanced (if a imperial stout can be considered "balanced")what must be a huge amount of malt.

Hops balance this beer is nicely, with over 9.5% ABV the alcohol is less notable than you would think it just slides through in the middle of the pull.

Smooth chocolate mousse with whip cream on top, creamy and decadent to the point where I don't want to drink it and make it disappear. Vivid in taste, chocolate cream pouring from oak bark, touches of sweet vanilla that gives way to slight hop finish which creates a fantastic transition of flavors. This brew has a bourbon feel to it from the oak with a thick but smooth body.

Oak hits, and heavy dark oak, grandpa whiskey style. So mature, more subtely complex then expected. Reserved flavors that have settled and softened their edges.

As imposing as the color is the head is a bit more imposing. 3 inches of massive dark beige head that leaves really heavy lacing for a big stout. The aroma is reminiscent of a really strong mocha. Big espresso notes, bitter chocolate, cream, and what has to be the 2nd hoppiest nose I can remember in a RIS. The one thing that I have to note on the aroma is that the oak really doesn't come through all that much. The flavor is like eating a bite off of a block of bakers chocolate.

Not as much chocolate or coffee as I usually like in my stouts, but this has its own flavor which is really great. Its woody, probably since it was oak aged (perhaps).

It's funny how you can sometimes get thrown for a loop when things aren't quite what you're expecting. I usually think the term "oak aged" is over-used and over-rated for the most part and I had also derived from hearsay and readings that not only was this beer not a good one to age, but that it was also not as good as the regular non-oak-aged Yeti. Well, contrary to what I was expecting to find, I liked this beer better than regular Yeti, nor do I find that the effects of almost a year of aging detract from this beer at all. I'm not so sure I would want to age it long-term, because it doesn't seem like it would gain too much, but it certainly hasn't lost anything.

The taste follows the smell and its great for it, as it warms up the oak really asserts its self, which is amazing in this brew. The label claims 75 IBUs which barely registers. Smooth as glass, and warm in my belly, this is one damn fine ale. Im going to have to go back and buy several more to see how they age.","Fatduck","Nov 07, 2008"

It finishes with some bitter hops and a lot of bold black coffee which can be tasted in the aftertaste for a long time. A bit dry and warming. There isn't necessarily an alcoholic rush but the flavors are bold, bitter and complex and it is evident that this beer is high in abv. I loved sampling this beer.

Some grassiness from the hops. Dang, for the hops to penetrate through this intensity of malt, they must have use a metric ass-load. Super-thick in the mouth and on the tongue, but light in the throat and upper palate due to a rising alcohol that cleans things off.

The taste does justice to the nose, and actually has a little bit of a background of acid to make the beer feel lively. Very creamy, silky bakers yeast of darkbreaded cinnamon cupcakes. I'm sure theres quite a bit of hops in this beer to really make a good effort to balance the dark roasted style of this lively oaked beer. The only thing is the notes of oak are very elusive, only the slighest hint of vanilla prevails on the background of the yeast. A great beer, very drinkable with a balance of hops to the malt.

That alcohol mixed in with the barrel aging spiciness with keep you warm on any night that you are feeling cold and alone.

4.35,2.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"My first sample from Great Divide Brewing Company, and I am tremendously impressed with the depth and chracter of this beer... Their Oak-Aged Yeti Imperial Stout definitely lives up to the hype surrounding this great brew... high-quality, top-notch stuff, and I would venture to say that this is probably one of the best stouts I have ever sampled, period... Marvelous opaque, jet-black, ebony hue with a dark, tan, slightly reddish head and nice lacing... aroma is thick, strong, and full of depth with deep, dark espresso smells and a strong nose of dark, burnt chocolate... the taste is certainly up there with the aroma, loaded with coffee, espresso, cocoa, and dark latte flavors... Nutty, toffee, roasted malt flavor and an immense taste with the oak-essence certainly noticeable and providing a tinge of vanilla to the classic stout flavor... Hands down, one of the best depictions of the style and one of the best American brews... Excellent stuff... Mouthfeel was thick, rich, and creamy, and the drinkability was effortless, went down like dark-coffee, and very hard to detect the 9.5% ABV... 22 oz bomber copped for about $8.99 from Total Wine and More in Union... Definitely recommended...","dsa7783","Jan 27, 2008"
3.6,-15.5,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"The taste was heavy on the alcohol flavor, vanilla with a sharp bite on finish. At first I could taste the hops, then coffee. In the mouth it was pretty thin for a stout and it has a finish of Kentucky Whiskey from the oak barrels I am sure. Overall a good drink but I prefer the standard Yeti much better.","cswhitehorse","Jan 26, 2008"

Nice and chocolatey with dark fruit sweetness and vanilla undertones along with a slightly woody finish. Big C hops add a nice of touch of bitterness. Alcohol is well hidden for 9.5%. I believe the age of this beer really mellowed out the oak. I've had fresh oaked Yeti and thought the wood dominated the flavor profile. A beer to sip for sure.

Taste is like a smack in the face - very strong. Lots of chocolate, but almost moreso, vanilla. The hops seem to have died, but there is an overall bitterness left on the tongue and in the aftertaste. Up front though, it's all about the malt. Mouthfeel is nice and full. Drinkability suffers not from the alchohol, but from the sweetness. Really quite intense, definately a sipper.","Onibubba","Jan 02, 2008"
4.97,16.7,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Poured a lustrious black color with a dark brown head on it. Strong aroma, with a great nose of hops and chocolate. Really strong flavors, especially the hops, but they were balanced so well that it tasted very smooth to me. Even though its 9.5% ABV, I didn't find that part to be overpowering and provided a fantastic kick to the flavors present. The effects of the aging process using the oak chips described by the brewery really adds another level of taste to an already very good Imperial Russian Stout. Highly recommend it if you've never had it.","bigremy","Jan 01, 2008"
4.13,-3.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Poured a thick lightless black/brown with a frothy caramel colored head. Good lace, some sticks around on top. Rich caramel smells and malt are noticeable even from a distance. Other dark smells, chocolate, prune, molasses. Taste is strikingly bitter, then filling out with rich cocoa, dark malts, grains, and coffee. Softer vanilla and oak tannins add to a more complex taste. Nice bitter burnt aftertaste, very full and not too sweet. Drinks somewhat heavily, with a full sticky mouth. Alcohol warms but is not overwhelming. For its heavy consistency and flavor, it is not overly syrupy, making it quite drinkable.","lightindarkness","Jan 01, 2008"

Nose is heavy on a sweet side with a somewhat alcohol tone that is masterfully masked I think. Also a bit of an aged Taste is smooth and rich. So many levels here. Thick like almost a coffee or chocolate bean oil. Just when you start to think it is too syrupy, the heavy flavor kicks in. And just when you think you are about to get too much alcohol on the mouth, it takes another turn. Just a bottle of sheer complexity, style, and grace. Unbelievably good. Mouthfeel is smooth and thick. I love how it stays on your tongue for so long. I at first gave it a 5...and then thought...nahh...just give it a 4.5. But I cannot say it is anything less than exceptional. Definitely drinkable. Might be too heavy for some, but I cant sip this one. I want a mouthful and all the flavor that comes with it. If you havent tried this one, what the hell are you waiting for?","RblWthACoz","Dec 29, 2007"
4,-6.1,4,4,4.5,4,3,"Pours a near black color with an average brown colored head; left some spotty lacing as it dissipated. The smell is of vanilla and oak; a very nice malty nose. The taste is quite complex as all the flavors kind of hit right away. The brew starts off with a rich, chocolate like malt which is quickly paired with vanilla & woody characteristics. This is quickly followed by a good resiny hop blast. I must say this is probably the first stout that I can recall where the hops are quite noticable. After all of this flavor explosion, you get a slight fusel alcohol burn. The feel is well bodied with soft carbonation, finishes as expected...malty bitterness. Great complex brew, great flavor profile but definitely a sipper.","Gmann","Dec 29, 2007"
4.15,-2.6,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours oily black with a medium lasting brown head. Smell is big roasty malt, some hops and a lot of woody, oak as well. Taste is rich, and roasty with tons of oak. Very balanced overall base beer with slightly too much oak character incorporated into it. That's really my only complaint and its not too big of one either. At least you really get what is stated. Drinkability is good and it has a nice thick mouthfeel and a nice level of light to medium carbonation. Very well made.","JDV","Dec 26, 2007"
4.05,-4.9,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Was an opaque black color with a dark brown head that became mild froth that was kind of clumpy. Smell was pretty faint, though complex. I noticed mostly alcohol, with notes of chocolate, coffee, fruit, and caramel. Taste was very interesting. Much hoppier than I expected. Took a little getting used to, but I eventually got used to it. Hints of vanilla, unsweetened chocolate, coffee beans all made their appearences. Also charcoal was present. Great taste, though I was distracted by the overabundance of hops and alcohol. The aftertaste stuck around for quite a while and was actually more pleasent than the initial taste. Mouthfeel was a little thin as far as stouts go, though it still worked pretty well. This one is definitely one to take your time with, given the ABV. Drink it slowly and enjoy it. I got another one to age. Perhaps this will be more enjoyable once the hops are tamed a bit more. Still, this is a great one to have during the winter season. Not my favorite imperial stout (Rogue probably will forever have that), but well worth having.","atrus138","Dec 25, 2007"
4.03,-5.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Did I enjoy it? - of course, it's bold and powerful. For me, the hops are slightly too prominent compared to the roasted malt components. For a hoppy stout, I prefer something like Bear Republic Big Black Bear where the hops are evident but more in balance. I'll certainly drink Oak Yeti again though and also try the non-oak version.","buzzworthy","Dec 23, 2007"
4.25,-0.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pitch black body with a dark tan head and matching lacing. The aroma is rich with clean, fresh oak and sweet chocolate and roasted grains. The flavor is a nice mix of black grains, espresso, unsweetened cocoa with a tinge of citrus rind from the hops. I also really like how the bitterness just slightly overmatches the malt here. Makes for, as usual, a great combination with the dry, heavily roasted malts. A top notch imperial stout, fairly drinkable for it's size and tasty to the end.","tempest","Dec 20, 2007"

The nose is goopy and kind of dissapointing. there is a little bit of a tarrish nose. This however is not reflected in the taste. The maltiness strikes early, but smoother and less hoppy than its non oaked brother. the 75 ibus show up in the finish but the abv is well hidden.

Drinkability is a little bit of a puzzler. This beer is excellent and everytime it hits the palate, you want more. But as a very full bodied, 9.50% beer, it may not feel so well once your palate (and the rest of your body) hits the floor. So good drinkability (great sipper) but this one is not a session brew.","NCSUdo","Dec 09, 2007"

A tan head rises and falls and leaves a ring with some lacing. Extremely small bubble carbonation. There is vanilla on the nose, hop smell with coffee, burnt toast. There is a wonderfully smooth textured mouthfeel despite lively hop presence, taste of roast coffee, dark chocolate, some coffee-liquer heat and pronounced bitterness. This is a rich tasting, nicely balanced blend of flavour with a gentle finish, never overpowering. As it warmed, a hint of astringency in the lingering finish, a reminder of high alcohol that was othewise well hidden. This was savoured with white and dark chocolate and miniature brownies, a nice way to end an evening, highly recommended.","ThatWineGuy","Nov 26, 2007"

The taste is an explosion of coffee, bitter chocolate and vanilla and it has a heavy,viscous mouth feel. This is not a session beer.

Aroma is that of rich dark chocolate, well balanced char, and a fruity alcohol note. The flavor is so mellow that it's incredibly easy to drink. The oak aging must chill this 9.5'er out immensely. It starts with a chewy burst of rich malty flavor that is followed by a charcoal taste that introduces the hop profile. From there it begins to dry out and leaves a residual sweetness and a smooth-as-silk finish that indicates nothing of the amount of alcohol in this drink. As it warms the malt up front begins to open into a maple syrup taste with a ton of balanced sugary-sweet flavor. A lot of really bold and strong RIS's give me instant heartburn, but this one is like sipping 10 year old scotch: it's smoother than you would ever expect. A definite must try. Well done great divide.","Rudgers73","Nov 18, 2007"

It's a picturesque stout: pours a completely opaque, oily black with a rich, mocha head. Thick and viscous. Good retention - I've got rings of lace around the glass. Smells of dark chocolate, dark roasted coffee, vanilla, alcohol, licorice. Nice touch of a cocoa bitterness. Dark fruit like raisins or cherries. Heavy taste of the chocolate, and the cocoa on the back of the palette. Tastes of the dark fruit as it warms, especially raisins. Bitter finish. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous. Little bit of fizzy carbonation on the back of the tongue, but that's it.

I had a hard time picking out certain aspects but the hops came through pretty well and it was balanced out nicely by the malts and sweetness. The mouthfeel is also a great experience as it is thick, oily and it coats going down.

The taste is very different from a Belgian - no candy sugar, just a rich malty taste with dark fruits, bitter chocolate and some alcohol taste (seemed like a rich port wine). I know some of these flavors don't seem to go together, but this beer is beautifully blended and complex. Mouthfeel is the best part, very rich and smooth, some hops oiliness, but I wouldn't call this a hoppy beer by any stretch. Drinkability is very good for a high alcohol beer, The taste remains inviting throughout...I am enjoying all 22 oz tonight. I will try to get more of these for the winter. A great sipper!!!","JayQue","Sep 19, 2007"

Stickiness is insanely good, holds on all over the sides of the glass. Smell is big caramel malt, roasted barley, and a hint of vanilla. A hint of booze is also detected in the nose, but doesn't seem to distract. Taste starts off with a sweet chocolate malt that is quickly taken over by a vodka-like flavor. Some coffee on the tongue, but the alcohol flavor seems to linger and distract. Aftertaste is a vanilla vodka like tingle, way too much alcohol flavor for a 9.5% beer. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a mild amount of carbonation. Drinkability suffers because of the big alcohol flavor throughout. Wasn't really impressed by this one.","BeerTruth","Sep 13, 2007"

A nice bitterness in the aftertaste as well. The mouthfeel is very thick and chewy, definitely feels like a meal. A good warming effect from the alcohol, not too much but enough to notice.

After a vigorous pour, the light brown head swelled and held at around an inch and a half and left rings of lacing as I drank. The head was darker than many beers are themselves and at least some of the dense, rich cap stayed for the whole session. Smell is of dark chocolate and vanilla and not very strong. The taste is a nice balance of roasted dark malt bitterness and woody, vanilla notes. Slight hop profile in the finish. Subtly smoky oak flavor masks the alcohol nicely. The body is full and chewy with a pleasant creaminess. This is delicious beer from Great Divide and I was very happy when my local Whole Foods started carrying it.

Raisins, roasted coffee, some bitter chocolate; all of which over a nice hop backbone. The taste is more of the same, though with a vanilla edge as well. The hops seem more alcohol in nature in the mouth and warm me. As the beer warms some of the alcohol bite leaves, none the less at 9.5% ABV its better suited for slow consumption.

Nose is strong on coffee, roasted malt, raisins, and some slight breadiness. Taste is incredible - interesting and complex. In no particular order, coffee, chocolate, dried fruit, breadiness, and prunes. Hoppiness shows up in the aftertaste, along with a touch of alcohol that actually suits the beer fairly well.

Sweet chocolate and coffee flavors gave way to the little bit of bite from the oak. Hops didn't play more than a supporting role.

It's sweet and bitter at the same time, and has a small alcohol taste in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium/full, it's a bit creamy and slick but not as creamy as I expected.

It is very very black in color with no other hints of any other colors, even under a bright light. It has a good bit of lacing. The smell is a mix of mainly hops, but also roast and very little smell of alcohol. The alcohol comes through on the taste, but only in the very end. There's a different taste up front - maybe it is vanilla? - and then it's dominated by the roast before the alcohol/hops bitterness kicks in. Lotsa hops for an RI stout.","kdoc8","Mar 16, 2007"

Lots and lots of wood flavor in this. Almost too much. I did not think this was very well balanced and was VERY over oaked. There are malt and hop flavors in there, but are over powered by the wood.

Smells is complex and enticing, excellent mix of subtlety and character in the aroma. There is an intoxicating rich dark chocolate character mixed wonderfully with hints of oaky earthiness, vanilla, and a supple smokiness that is making me tear up. The hops are there but tamed so beautifully by age. The taste is so fucking good; I am having the damnedest time concentrating on the review. Starts with a wonderful rich, dark chocolate mouse character balanced by sweet and mild bitterness and an amazingly satisfying richness on the swallow. Alcohol is not present in the smell or taste, but is there with comforting warmth. I love the moughtfeel on this its so fun to play with it on my tongue before a big swallow that makes you want to die. Nothing in this, not one molecule is overdone or under attended to, an exquisite balance I am so pleasantly surprised. My dog knocked over the last couple of drops of my first glass, for this she will never be forgiven. This is undeniably my favorite Russian Imperial stout and I will be purchasing at least half a dozen more tomorrow. If you like RIS and you havent had this for crap sake get it together, youll never be the same.

2.98,-30,4,3.5,2.5,4,2.5,"I really wanted to like this beer, but I think it is seriously overoaked and what is normally a very nice stout has become a mess. Pours black with a thick tan head. Smell is roasty, sour, and with hints of vanilla. Both the sourness and vanilla come in large part from the wood. The taste is all wrong. There are roasty notes, malt, and chocolate struggling to make themselves known, but they are obliterated by the heavy oak flavors. It tastes like there is a shot of anejo tequila in this beer. Heavy vanilla, wood sourness, and cherry flavors from the wood as well as a woody aftertaste make this less than enjoyable for me. Give me the non oak-aged Yeti any day over this. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy, but still there is that tannic wood in the background cutting against it. Not very drinkable at all, like a beautiful cabernet that someone has oaked all to hell. More restraint on the wood would have added subtle touches of wood and vanilla sweetness and would have been welcome.

Slick and oily mouthfeel and easily the thickest beer I've had to date. Drinkability-wise I don't know why all the ratings for this have been so high; I've liked others of this style so much more.

The nose was so rich and deep I think I couuld probably OD and legally die if I inhaled too much of it. There were heavy notes of chocolate, molassass, brown sugar, some salty flavors mixed in. The first blush revealed a sharp hop bitterness that slid into a smooth full bodied malt attack replete with more notes of chocolate and slight rum and fruit overtures before morphing back towards the bitterness of the hops. The alcohol produced a comforting warming sensation, but in no way overpowered the flavors.

Very complex, to say the least, and quite nice. Nice woody sweet taste. It hits up front with the sweetness - some cocoa and coffee notes here too - and finishes with the oak. What a solid beer. I love Great Divide for a lot of reasons. They have a great staff and they really take beer seriously. I was able to visit the brewery this year when I was in town for the GABF and they were extremely hospitable; good people. Even better that they brew excellent beers.

Do yourself a favor and indulge in this one more than once. You will thank yourself in the end.","BeerSox","Oct 19, 2006"

4.03,-5.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Solid cauldron black. Thick, cascading head of small, creamy, deeply tanned caramel bubbles. Settles at a slow pace to a thick skim coat, leaving thick glass-coating sheets of lace. Vanilla, brown sugar, toasted oak and juicy pine-centric hop aromas are full and inviting as well as a bit boozy and sweet. An initial dose of barrel-derived oak and vanilla as well as spikey alcohol greets the palate. Rich roasted flavors come to the front as well as some brown sugar sweetness. The vanilla, oak, and bourbon-esque heat begins to overtake the flavors into the finish and a lingering warmth of alcohol remains. There is an undercurrent of piney and a touch of citrus rind hops that also compliment the finish. With additional warmth, the boozy sweetness becomes more pronounced. Full body with a rich silk smooth mouthfeel that also has a rough cut bite. For a big beer, this is surprisingly drinkable. The oak-vanilla-booze flavors are not out of hand and compliment the underlying Yeti.","hopsaplenty","Oct 13, 2006"

Still rooted with dark chocolate and high bitterness the hop flavor as been subdued a bit all blended well with aging very extraordinary brew. Mouthfeel full bodied coats the palate nice thick and chewy with mellow slow bubbling carbonation, quite an experience.

The brew pours a very thick, solidly black color. The head is a richly deep brown color, with a lot of intricacy, producing attractive lace. The smell is amazingsmoky and very roasty. Theres a very intense alcohol aroma, mingled with dark-roast coffee, burnt grain, and licorice. Theres also a notable oak quality in the aroma, along with some chocolate and vanilla. What I most enjoyed about the aroma, aside from the complexity, is the powerful intensity of the smell. It really jumps out of the glass and seeks out your nose. The taste is equally as pushyintensely bitterboth a roasted/burnt bitterness and a solid-dosing of hops bitterness. Its also layered with a tremendous alcohol flavor and warming, roast barley, choloclate, and espresso. Wow. Very nice. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, and quite creamy.

The hops are in there in the aroma, but seem to be over powered by the wood and alchol aromas. The flavor brings in the aromas on the palate with the hops being more prevalent in the taste. The oak wood flavor becomes stronger after every sip. In the mouth it feels a little thinner than the non aged Yeti, alot like skim milk, with some evidence of carbonation, but not alot.

They just resonate on the back of your palate for minutes after each blast of pine and tamarack bark. This is so spicy my nose is going nuts and my taste buds are getting fried. I love it.

Pears, chocolate and coffee blend nicely and you can clearly make out the scent of fresh hops. Taste is pretty amazing, coffee and chocolate followed by some slightly sweet raison, fig and vanilla flavors. There is a nice and suprising belgian-like spiciness in the middle followed by some bourbon and vanilla tastes that really shine through as the brew warms. Lots of nice oily hops coat the tongue and linger bitterly in the aftertaste...didn't see that coming from a stout. Alcohol is hidden quite deceptively in the taste. Just a big, complex beast. Mouthfeel is silky smooth and perfect in my opinion. Drinkability is hindered slightly because of the abv and richness but I could easily polish off two bombers of this in a night.

Midway the malt takes on a more burnt taste and the flavor turns slightly bitter from the hoppiness. Strong expresso roast and piney hop bitterness towards the back.

A strong pungent hop comes in midway through a sip and collides with the vanilla. Alcohol flavor is noted in the finish. Overall, Oaked Yeti has plenty of flavor going for it, but at times the flavors don't work too well together. Also the oaky vanilla was a little too strong for my tastes.

It is soft on the nose but quite aromatic, and it smells good enough to be a milkshake flavor. The body is very thick and smooth but could coat the mouth better.

Hops are there but are pretty much drowned with the oak and malts. Finishes with a good oak flavor. Mouthfeel was medium with good carbonation.

4.38,2.8,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"2005 vintage, 22oz bomber bottle presented with a cap and silver foil cover. Pours a deep coffee black and makes a short, thick tan head. Laces my glass nicely. The complex aroma is rich roasted malts, chocolate, vanilla and coffee. Flavor opens with spicy bittering and unsweetened chocolate which melds into a mix of burnt caramel and dark roast espresso. There's an unusual hint of soured milk. The oak tannins are strong and provide a familiar vanilla flavoring which does a nice job of masking the alcohol. Very little sweetness makes the palate more on the medium side, has a creamy texture and finishes rather dry. Overall, this is a pretty nice imperial stout. I like what the oak adds, gives this beer a nice complexity that it's non oaked sibling is somewhat lacking. I would drink this again and would like to try it with some age under it's belt.","kmcnair","Dec 26, 2005"

Dark black, completely opaque, two fibngers of a thick brown head with nice retention and good lacing, this is a great looking beer. The oak comes through in a big way in the aroma melding with the big hop aroma, with a slight vanilla and espresso note as well. Taste is where this one really becomes radically different from the normal Yeti--instead of the hops absolutely dominating the flavor, this one really has a bourbon and oak flavor underlying everything, the hops are still there and still strong and resinous, but with rich chocolate, vanilla, caramel, and coffee notes infused throughout. Full bodied with a thick creamy mouthfeel. This is really a completely different beast from the normal Yeti, the oak really does change the taste incredibly much, but I really loved both and for now I've rated them the same. I will have to revisit, hopefully side by side, to determine which is the better brew.","cubedbee","Dec 22, 2005"

Notes of cherry cordials. Taste is of mellow, bourbon-laced chocolates. Sturdy hop presence through the middle (more so as the beer warms). Velvety chocolate-covered esspresso bean finish.

Let's get the appearence out of the way. It's black, perhaps a glimpse of ruby light at the very bottom, with an excellent portion of brown foamy head, the non shrinking kind. I first smelled this beer and thought, wait, is this the Hercules? It honestly smells very floral and hoppy with a slight alcohol burn. Also, a sarcastic amount of malty character coming through. But, for once, in a stout, and I'll say it again folks, I ain't no hophead, but they're in full effect here. I love malt in an IPA and I love hops in a stout, and that's what holds this beer together. Excellent grassy, fruity notes, an excellent compliment to the hearty, chocolaty roasty malts which are truly the backbone of this beer. Oh man, the fact that this beer is citrusy and chocolaty and burnt and coffee-ish and very hoppy and malty at the same time kind of makes me want to freak out. But I won't. I'd also like to comment on the fact that this beer is barrel aged and adds a lot of nice mellow (I'd like to say mellow once more) alcohol characteristics on top of all the crazy activeness.

The taste is rich with cocoa and chocolate upfront with a mildly bitter finish that evolves into a dry, sweet aftertaste. In my opinion, this is a bigger beer than many beers I've tried within a similar style (Russian Imperial Stout). This beer is complex with varying levels of flavor poping up at different times; a truly terrific beer.

Chocolate, coffee, nuts, esters, lightly woodsy, vanilla, cherry, and a hint of nutmeg and earth. The taste is strong and chocolaty, with alcohol, light dough, and a slightly medicinal taste. The finish is long, warming and lightly bitter with oak and chocolate refusing to leave. The mouthfeel is marvelous, again especially for a bottle. Full body, silky texture, very low carbonation.

Again it starts with roastiness, but this time it's taken on an oaky, bourbon quality. Then the cherry sweetness emerges, but is a bit muted compared to the original and more wooden, vanilla like. Then it dries out into the finish with a lasting roasted oaky hop infused presence. It lingers eternal The hops are subdued in this version and supplanted by the oak character. Less aggressive hop bitterness for the oak, yet less cloying too. Perhaps better? I'd give this a 4.75 for taste if it were possible. Mouthfeel is very full, and drinkability is quite good.

The flavor begins with some nice vanilla and oak notes, followed by a lightly sweet dark chocolate, some expresso, dark fruits, light floral and citrus hops and a roasty finish. The oaked version really tones down the bitterness and hops of the original, in favor of more subdued and subtle flavors.

With a little less ABV than the 11% of Goose Islands American Double Stout - Yeti is a smoother brew that offers similar aroma vanilla, some more chocolate, and faint coconut. Taste is more fruity and the full body and thick mouthfeel are nearly perfect. Both of these Am Doubles are awesome in their own right. With a little less complexity however the Yeti offers a better session possibility.

There is no doubt that this brew smells different than it did before it was aged. They both smell great, however, aged or not. As for taste, this aged version tastes wonderful. However, I feel that it is a little less complex than the unaged version. Or, rather that its complexity is hidden beneath the more alcohol like flavor the oak imposed on it. Some chocolate flavors can still be tasted, but others are hidden. It doesn't engulf your mouth with chocolate the same way the unaged version does.

Taste starts with some coffee bitterness, segues into dark fruitiness for a moment, smooths into some dark malt sweetness, and then closes with another shot of bitter and some nice alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is ok, but a bit harsh for what I would expect from a barrel-aged brew, and drinkability is about the same. A nice double stout, but the barrel seems to have had minimal input here, for my palate.","ppoitras","Jul 19, 2005"

Thick rings of chunky lace coat the glass as does the oily liquid after each sip before oozing back down to the body. Simply a picture perfect Imperial Stout. Surprisingly strong hoppy nose with floral and piney notes. A bit too hoppy in my opinion as it didnt let much else shine through until nearly the end of the 22oz. Lighter chocolate and roasty notes peak through at times. Big hoppy flavor as expected with a good strength chocolate malt trying to battle back the hops. It seemed the hops died out after awhile and let some oak come through but not much. Mouthfeel is damn thick and pretty slick going down. Very nice. Pretty good drinkability but the hoppiness drowning out the other flavors drops this a bit for me.

During the first pour, I could smell the malt from across the bar. Plenty of malt and roasted in the aroma, also a bit vinous, ripe fruits and a soft bit of alcohol. But the real player here was the vanilla aromas from the oak. Very prominent. Even before noticing the flavours, the mouthfeel was overwhelming. Chewy and creamy with a heavy body. The carbonation was incorporated very well and contributed to the thick, viscous texture. Vanilla was very strong in the flavour as well, but a little more balanced. Alcohol was apparent as well, lending to a whiskey or liquor-like quality. Still, there's a lot of roasted malt and coffee, ripe fruits and chocolate, especially as it warms. Finishes dry with alcohol warmth, malt and vanilla. The aftermath on the palate is similar to a shot of quality whiskey. This is a big, complex beer.

The aftertaste was indescribable, exactly like the aftertaste of a very fine oaked chardonnay, just amazing. The mouthfeel was nice and thick, perfect consistency, not overly thick and just right, very smooth and tasty.

This brew finished with a nice dry smoky character and some residual coffee tinge, quite pleasant. Mouthfeel is big and chewy. Alcohol content makes it's presence known, but is well integrated into the taste. Not too intrusive, although the taste lingers for quite a while. A very tasty Imperial Stout.

The taste is very roasty. The dark malts are reminiscent of baking chocolate and slight coffee. There is some definite dark fruity sweet tones to this brew. There seems to be a lot of sugars left in this beer that makes the body so sweet and full. Some definite subtle oaky notes are in the flavor and emerge more once the brew warms.

The oak aging adds some smoothness, I gather, but not a lot to the actual taste. But this is pretty damn good nonetheless. The only thing a little lacking is the mouthfeel.

Strong extremely dry aroma which managed to dissimulate the oak much more than Id have anticipated, I wouldnt notice it at all blind I assume. Ashes like, roasty dryness (which I like to describe as pencil shavings) backed by more dark bread overtones and woody counterparts. Bitter black chocolate dominates the palate, but it doesnt hide the coffee nuances and vegetal and citrusy hops. Very hoppy in fact which contributes to the high level of dryness that lingers on and lingers on. Smooth medium body, a bit chalky or phosphoric towards the finish. I sincerly expected more, but I cant say Im disappointed not to have just yet another barrel dominated freak show. It just didnt feel even as good as what I remember from the regular richer, chocolatey Maverick/yeti imperial Ive had a year or so ago and I could understand it has a fine markup on it..","Rastacouere","Apr 21, 2005"

Aroma is different in construction than regular Yeti, seems more rounded in nature with hints of wild berries and confectioner's sugar. A little light in body for an Imperial style in my opinion. Flavor seems much the same, where this beer hides its 75 IBUs I still can't figure out. Hops are still there, but the jelly doughnut and coffee-like malts seem like a blanket from start to finish -- it covers the mouth but reveals the hop shape underneath.

The beer is a pitch black color that allows no light to come through. The aroma is interesting, there is a note that is a interesting mix of wood and roasted malts. I get notes of rich espresso, chocolate, vanilla, and an actual woody note. The taste is sweet up front with a subtle yet rich vanilla note that moves to a soft creamy note of rich chocolate. This beer is so creamy and smooth in the mouth, it is very reminiscent of a chocolate shake. Wow I am quite impressed here, this beer is quite a bit more interesting and flavorful than the regular version, which was perhaps a tad too bit simplistic. The oak adds a whole other dimension here that really brings this beer to a new level. As the beer warms up the oak starts to kick in a bit more, the finish becomes a bit more astringent with a solid tannic note.

I love hops, but not at the expense of the characters I love in an oak aged beer, especially stout. The flavor was right there with the nose, big citrusy and piney hops sitting over a very distant roasted chocolate and coffee. No real oak character plays in this. Damnit all to hell. I'm a hop head, but show me some of the malt and wood character in this beer. The feel was thick, but not syrupy like the Goose Island BCS. I actually found this to be a better beer than the original Yeti, but at what expense? The oak and stout characters really had no say because the hops were just too damn loud.
