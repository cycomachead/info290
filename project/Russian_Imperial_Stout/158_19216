Serious chocolate notes came through immediately, nice roasty flavor. I didn't get any sense of the barrel aging, not sure if there are supposed to be hints of bourbon or anything but if there is I certainly did not pick up on it. Tasted like a big stout with strong hints of chocolate. Made my wife scrunch up her face in disgust when she tasted, I savored every pull.","Jwburns75","Mar 26, 2015"
