4.28,0.7,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,"the few beers i have had from these guys have been amazing. thebrewo is owed a huge debt of gratitude for hooking these up. this is my favorite i think from them. its one of the more dry, but more whiskey flavored imperial stouts i have had, you get the wood as much as the booze, and that oak hit really makes this one for me. ominous looking in the glass, not a ton of head, but its real shiny and dense. aromas of vanilla and cocoa powder, lots of dark chocolate on this, and a ton of roast, rich and dense, almost nutty. the flavor is nutty too, and only sweet in flashes of bourbon, but dry on the whole. mature musty wood profile on it, plenty of body, and warming alcohol short of the fusel range, but pretty intense just the same. this seems far more refined to me than others, dialed in to a rare degree. its an art form, a bottle to share, and a special treat. different enough to stand out, but an excellent example of why this style has become so popular and sought after. this should serve as an example to brewers who want to see one done right. top tier in this category for sure.","StonedTrippin","Mar 15, 2015"
