4.12,8.4,5,4.25,4,4,4,"Pours a pure pitch black in color with about a one-finger foamy/creamy beige head that hangs along for a while. A good amount of thick lacing is seen with each sip that sticks to the glass. The aroma is mostly of dark roasted malts, toffee and coffee. The taste is bold with lots of flavor of the above ingredients. A slightly dry and very light bitter finish is noted but doesn't take away much from this brew. Medium+ bodied with perfect carbonation for this brew style. The brew actually tasted better when warmed up as this is more of 'sipping brew' than drinking it down in a few minutes. Kick back and enjoy this one during the cooler months. Another tasty brew from the Sam Adam's folks. Cheers!","BeerWithMike","Dec 15, 2014"
