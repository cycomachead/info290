4.01,2,4,4.25,4,3.5,4,"Poured very dark, almost black, opaque.  Nice half-inch head. Aroma has touches of chocolate, vanilla and just a hint coffee and alcohol. Flavor was lots of dark roast malt, vanilla, and some dark fruit. Mouthfeel was somewhat thin from what I had expected from an Imperial Stout. Overall, pretty tasty, but not outstanding. Very drinkable.","timontheroad","Mar 21, 2015"
