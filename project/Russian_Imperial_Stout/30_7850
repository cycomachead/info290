The taste was great but I would like a deeper, thicker body. Maby the older versions of the beer is better on that matter. Still very good though!","craftbeersweden","Mar 16, 2015"

3.89,-1.3,4.5,3.5,4,3.75,4,"Black (40+) pour into my SAPP with thick, tight dark khaki foam; great lacing. Not much nose at first, but ripe fruit, toffee and licorice as it warms. Chocolate malt base, stone fruit, subtle candy/toffee flavors, with hint of licorice on the finish. Medium lite mouthfeel, velvety tongue coating. Easy to drink and alcohol well hidden. Another winner in the Dictator series.","DoctorZombies","Mar 11, 2015"
