3.64,-13.5,4.5,4.25,3.25,3.5,3.5,"Though I had high expectations, this beer did not deliver. The taste was not really what I was looking for. A beer this dark should have more roastiness/etc to it. But that's not really what I got here. The beer looked and smelled great, but besides that it was just average. I would say skip this beer and just pick up some Edmund Fitzgeralds.","mchegash","Mar 18, 2015"

Some dark berry / burnt fruitcake is also present, and it finishes with a lingering toasted malt.  Intriguing, but not exactly in my personal wheelhouse.","ajm5108","Mar 17, 2015"
