Strong coffee/roast notes, much lacing, became more enjoyable as it warmed.  A bit of a hop presence if I'm not mistaken.  A solid beer, but there are more enjoyable options out there IMHO.","Jwburns75","Friday at 08:49 PM"

Subtle hints of sour fruit are in there somewhere. A very nuanced stout. Feels just like it looks: full-bodied and viscous with a mere touch of astringency.

It's like a lightly carbonated mudslide. I give a 4 instead of 5 on taste because I feel it's a tad too bitter. I like bitter but with the chocolate creaminess my tongue goes looking for sweetness, which makes the bitterness come as a shock.

Lacing is some of the most amazing I have seen, it is thick and glues itself to the sides of the glass!!. Aroma is of malt, roasted coffee, spice and a hint of chocolate. Taste is bold, with burnt malt/coffee being predominant. Could have used with a little more roast and less burnt. Alcohol is pretty well hidden for a 9% ABV. The undertones of coffee, spice and light chocolate would have been better if it wasn't for the overwhelming burnt bitterness. Ok, I guess it wants to be more, and I am trying, once I get the bitterness off my palate..","hophugger","Jan 09, 2015"

4.83,12.3,5,4.5,5,5,4.75,"First taste was poured from draft (nitro) a couple weeks ago, and while it was very good I just don't prefer the flat feeling of a nitro beer so I held off on rating until I could try the original version. I enjoy the feel of carbonation. I later found it again, regular draft, and it was absolutely delicious. I would go so far as to say it's of the best year-round Russian Imperial Stouts I've had to date. A must try if you have not already.","LouZ","Dec 31, 2014"

At first I felt I picked up almost a marshmallow/caramel aroma on the nose but that dissipated; It's a nice chocolate/coffee with only a hint of smoke. Everything is relatively subtle for a big beer like this; not overly sweet or smokey or boozy. Pretty much spot on for what you want in a impy stout.","Johnquisssssssy","Dec 29, 2014"

Though I did detect some dark fruit in the nose, possibly fig or plums, cocoa and coffee dominated on the palate, which worked well with the mouthfeel, if I tasted this blindly, I could easily believe it to be an oatmeal stout, all in all an exceptional stout, highly recommended.","taters21","Dec 27, 2014"

The retention and lacing are excellent.  The aroma is delicious - coffee and cocoa with floral hops adding complexity.  The flavor lives up the nose.   It's an explosion of coffee and cocoa malts with a great hop presence that balances the sweet malt.  It finishes with a mild bitterness of coffee and floral hops.  Really complex flavors.  The body is  medium-full with a real smooth creaminess on nitro.  I'm a huge fan of this beer.","mr-jj","Nov 03, 2014"

4.5,4.7,,,,,,"Pours almost jet black, with the slightest dark brown hue.  The head rises quickly, frothing into a dark tan.  The aromas are overwhelming in a great way: cocoa, roasted malts, and coffee come through the strongest.  The malts smoothly hit the palate first, followed by the balanced hops and malts.  An oaky finish has a tinge of a tobacco taste, followed briefly by notes of espresso and dark chocolate.  Truly an exceptional beer!  Although it sounds counter intuitive with the coffee/espresso flavors, this is a great bedtime brew.  The best RIS out there, IMHO.","ColdBassHonkey","Oct 27, 2014"

4.75,10.5,,,,,,"The brothers say, "not for the faint of heart", but for this style, remarkably easy drinking, as all the wood, chocolate, coffee, etc is mitigated by an overall delicate refinement, belied by the chunky head clearly visible through the dark bottle.  Really, the overriding aftertaste is something of fruit, though the bitterness is pronounced as well, the hops probably preserving the taste, as it tastes like it was bottled yesterday.  But the bitterness as with everything is perfectly calibrated, not too much, not too little.  So much more refined and unobtrusive, than say Guinness,  but ironically more intense than Guinness (how does that work).  Hard to fathom how something this perfectly calibrated originated in America.","Slamms","Oct 01, 2014"

It tends to be easy to find, and it is also usually one of the cheaper options among the legitimate stouts. I often find myself reaching for a pack of Old Rasputin to pair with traditional meat and potatoes type meals, and I will continue to do so as long as they keep brewing this excellent Russian Imperial Stout.","Nostradrunkus","Oct 01, 2014"

4.7,9.3,,,,,,"Bottle poured into glass.  The best lacing I have ever seen.  Completely surrounds the glass and retained throughout.  The head is super thick and creamy, it is a brown color.  The beer itself is black. The aroma knocks you back with strong roasted malt, burnt, coffee.  The taste is fantastic from start to finish.  Powerful roasted malt, coffee, molasses, caramel.  Creamy and chewy in the mouth.  Full bodied, complex but balanced sweetness and bitterness.  One of the best beers I have ever had, and possibly the best Russian Imperial Stout.","mthomp081","Aug 31, 2014"

Otherwise, it's all quite solid. It pours pitch black with a small tan head that sticks around for quite a long time. It smells mostly like chocolate. The taste is similar. The overwhelming flavor in this beer is of chocolate. The mouthfeel is a little sticky and smooth, very pleasant. Overall, this is a world-class RIS that I would highly recommend to anyone.","DanielMB","Aug 23, 2014"

Poured into a nonic pint glass, giving me a deep midnight black color with a lovely, two finger, tan-colored head that lasted until the beer was about halfway gone. Had quite a prevalent espresso aroma and taste with some very light hints of hazelnut and licorice. Being a 9%, the alcohol was present in the taste, but definitely not overwhelming, giving it a pleasant, warming feel down the throat. Definitely a highly respectable, top-ranking beer.","KyleSweetsema","Aug 13, 2014"

The body is black as night and the head is beautiful and creamy, with a tint of dark red/purple. That tint in the foam is one of the most telling signs for me. Loved this beer: dark, creamy, malty, and delicious. One of my top five beers currently. Highly recommended for any and all stout lovers.","sheeley","Aug 05, 2014"

While I have been underwhelmed by the rest of North Coast's offerings, this beer is truly excellent. Deep, dark colors and an appropriate bloom and lacing. Notes of chocolate, raisins, and prune are present but not overwhelming. Definite notes of iron, but pleasantly used. I have had it on tap and in the bottle several times.

The smell is of a heavy roast from the malt, a touch of chocolate, some dark fruits, and a bit of char. You get all this chocolate, the heavy roast switches to blackened charred and smoked meats, raisins, and ends with a sweet wash almost like maple syrup or brown sugar. Great super medium mouthfeel.

The beer is night-black with an off-white head of about two-finger widths. It leaves a nice lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is robust, full of chocolate and roasted barely. The taste is equally robust. At first sip, the overwhelming taste was of dark chocolate, but as I drank it, roasted coffee came to the forefront. There is just a hint of alcohol, but nothing that would suggest the 9% abv. There was also a certain sweetness that I lingered on the tongue along with a mild hop bitterness. The mouthfeel was rich and creamy with a modest carbonation. Overall, this beer is outstanding on every level.","thomda11","Jul 21, 2014"

The flavors are well balanced and it's not gonna wreck your palate, but having two in a short time period will definitely knock you off your donkey. Not exactly a beer you'd have at a party, but it's good sipping during a movie or reading a book (it will take half the movie to finish).","enjambed","Jul 14, 2014"

4.2,-2.3,4.75,4,4.25,4,4.25,"Pours pitch black with a magnificent head. Lacing and retention are also outstanding. The nose is sweet dark chocolate, roast and hints of dark fruit and smoke. Almost full bodied with a very smooth, almost creamy, texture. Borderline normal carbonation level with just a touch of effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is well balanced and a bit complex, but not as complex as FIS or Wulver. It begins with sweet dark chocolate which flows into a roast and hop bitterness. The middle has a molasses note. The finish is smooth and leaves you with an alcoholic burn at the back of the throat that lingers quite long. Less hops would allow the dark fruit flavor to materialize and add to complexity.","tillmac62","Jul 11, 2014"

My first experience with Imperial Stout was not a pleasant one. It was harsh and bitter. I shied away from such things until I discovered Old Rasputin. It's not harsh at all. I fills the pallet with all the flavors and notes I enjoy. It's not a beginners beer by any means. You have to really love the fullness and complexity that comes with such brews. It's not something I could drink one after the other for extended periods, but prefer to alternate between this and 90 Minute Imperial IPA from Dogfish Head.","LoveThyBier","May 24, 2014"

This one pours a deep near black mahogany with a large and thick tan head that gives way to a nice film and substantial lacing. The nose is lighter than expected with the expected notes of coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, and dark caramel. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy but lighter than the pour and nose make one expect. It is medium bodied and coats the mouth in a most enjoyable and satisfying way without being thick and sticky. The flavor is a wonderful blend of dark cacao, roasted coffee, and sweet caramely malts. This is a damn well crafted beer and it is very understandable why it is one of the benchmarks of the style. This is the first of my four way tasting that I feel is perfect now and doesn't need any age on it.","lochef81","Apr 08, 2014"

The Old Rasputin Stout reminded me more of a stout mixed with a nice Belgian Ale. It's still tasty, and the high alcohol content will give you a nice buzz. But I just didn't care for the fruit / raisin notes.","iheartmyTHO","Mar 28, 2014"

I loved the coffee notes and the dryness, perfectly hopped with what I assume to be KEG (something english for sure). My only negative is that it was a little boozy for 9%, where I have tasted smoother stouts with a higher ABV. Regardless, that's just a personal preference and this is an absolutely amazing representation of the RIS style.","aqualung23","Mar 06, 2014"

The aroma is of roasted malt, raw cocoa, oat, vanilla, and some campfire smoke. There are hints of cane sugar and plum. It tastes of roasted marshmallow (emphasis on the roast), chocolate, oat, vanilla, smoked malt, and some vanilla. The finish seems to be a subtle battle between sugar and grain notes. Mouthfeel is superb; thick and roasty with a palate-coating viscosity. A rich, moist finish.

It doesn't compare to the world-class RIS's that I've had the pleasure of drinking, but I would drink this any day of the week with a smile on my face, and save some time and money while I was at it.

It isn't too intense, but just right. One of my favorite RIS. I get it every year around my birthday to cellar so i can do a nice vertical on my bday.

The bitterness is very obvious but not unpleasant, and as you sip you can taste more coffee and dark bread flavors. Mouthfeel is not too thick, good for the taste. Definitely recommended.","James773","Jan 21, 2014"

He came back with my growler telling me it was Old Rasputin. Apparently being a a Russian Imperial Stout to my dismay. I was SOOOO wrong. This beer was so complex. It had a wonderfully aromatic head, leaving a fine dotted lacing along the sides of my glass. The taste was dark espresso, milk chocolate, and almost burnt tasting malt. By burnt i mean a smokey taste. I found myself entranced by the the beer settling back through the head after a sip. You could watch the almost black liquid fall through the caramel head making fine swirls. Being 9% ABV was defiantly a plus as well. I don't like a beer unless it knocks me on my ass. Well, overall i will defiantly be getting this again, and maybe changing my opinion on stouts as a whole.","propel692000","Dec 12, 2013"

This is so creamy and smooth for the strength, no perceptible alcohol just a rich full bodied stout, light creamy carbonation and lots of rich roasty flavor. Keeps a creamy head till the end. Not much bad to say about this beer, tons of rich balanced flavor, great character. Would definitely have again.","mick303","Nov 26, 2013"

5,16.3,5,5,5,5,5,"Looking at this beer, for what it is (an imperial stout) - I have had no better example of the type. The alcohol is noticable, and gives quite the kick to the balls on the initial sip- but the flavor of it is rounded out with complexity, showing malts (perfectly balanced in the beer), spices, and chocolate. The flavor is SO complex and dense I am at a loss for descriptions trying to do it justice. Add to this the silky, creamy goodness that makes you want to keep sipping. The creaminess on this beer is so remarkable, that I can't think of anything I have ever had that compares. The only detraction might be that its heavy in notcing the alcohol in the flavor- but its an imperial stout, so this beer ends up being everything it should be.","-MK-","Nov 21, 2013"

Aroma is smoked wood, roasted coffee, vanilla, chocolate, burnt sugar--and maybe I'm just fantasizing here, in a Rasputin trance, but I pick up a faint, savory aroma that reminds me of bacon in the oven. Thick and syrupy with an acidic bite at the end that whispers "sip some more, sip some more!" Smokey, sweet, burnt, complex, chocolate, wood, hints of spice even (nutmeg & cinnamon). This has been and continues to be my go-to Imperial Stout. Others might be stronger but none hit me the way Old Rasputin does, even after all these years.

Foamier than most RIS. No strong scent - just mild hints of caramel and coffee. These two flavors are distinct in the taste though. Serve this puppy pretty warm - cold it tastes boozy but at 50-55 degrees that goes away and the beer is silky smooth. I do like a few other RIS's more but this is the best year-round version.

Aboslutely way to bitter for me. I try and finish every beer, even if I don't like it, because I want to be sure I don't like it.

Arresting aromas of coffee, chocolate, and baking spice; it trends a bit on the sweet side and maybe could use a little more roasted malt in the background but that's gilding the lily. The aromas carry through to the palate with more malt presence there, which gives some grip to this and prevents it from being flabby or cloying. Nice effervescence and somehow an easy to handle medium bodied mouth feel despite the intense aroma and flavor. Delicious.","malloyca","Aug 28, 2013"

This stood out because of the name, the artwork and it was $3 less for 4-pack (almost an aberration in MA). I'm much more than $3 richer for it now. This is about as close to a 5 as a regular beer gets (the only distraction is a somewhat boozy nose, and not because of the vessel). I keep going back to the well after that serendipitous moment and it tastes better every time.","VictorWisc","Jun 14, 2013"

Excellent retention that you would expect from a stout and beautiful thick, sticky lace. Nose is genuine stout with roasted coffee some dark fruits and a good measure of alcohol.A bit of chocolate to tempt you. Smoky and inviting. Taste is heavenly. Chocolate, coffee malt, roasted, smoky, hints of vanilla and a delightful bitter. Not too thin, and drinks creamy and smooth. The alcohol is on the palate but it’s welcome. It’s a little boozy and who would mind with a flavor like this. Grand, with an aftertaste that boasts of it’s malt character and strength. Sweet and smoky like a fire on a cold night, burnt a little and some dark chocolate too. Fine and excellent.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

Not much on the nose but the taste was of chocolate and mild coffee hints. Easily one of, if not the thickest stouts I'v ever had.

The mouthfeel is creamy but balanced. Roasty yet clean. The taste was malty.. chocolate notes.. coffee notes.. strong but pleasant. Easily one of the most drinkable imperials i have had. Perfection.

The lace was beautiful and formed a nice latticework all the way down until the last sip. The nose was oaky and burnt with some undertones of some kind of nut, I couldn't quite tell. The flavor was dark,dark chocolaty with strong notes of coffee. MF was thick but very smooth. This is the best stout I've ever had, and definitely in the top 2 beers I've ever had in my entire life. An overall blissful experience from the appearance all the way to the last sip. I enjoyed it at a little less than room temp (60 degrees F).","Jacurdy60","Jan 26, 2013"

Thick prominent head that fades very slowly and leaves a light covering and lots of lace. The nose is light coffee, bigger chocolate but not quite as big as I expected. Still this is one good smelling brew with the chocolate taking me to a shop that has just opened its wares. Taste is somewhat the reverse with more coffee than chocolate. Hops are a star in this show and they will not take a back seat to anyone. Rich and smooth latte flows into an herbal and dry citrusy bittering. Finish is rather clean and quite dry. Chocolate malt notes underpin the charcoal infused java flavors. While clean the finish leaves some grapefruit and bitter black coffee. Feel is somewhat crisp with a tingly carbonation and rather chewy construction and heft. A great brew period and always welcome.","scootny","Jan 02, 2013"

Coffee, roasted malts, chocolate and brown sugar come through, caramel and butter aromas are hidden and the smell is masked by a general scent of mild sweetness. Crisp when it hits your tongue, it’s bitter over all and has a medium-to-heavy mouth feel. The roasted malts are well evident in the aftertaste and on the side of your mouth; mild chocolate flavors are present throughout, not a bad stout at all. The aftertaste lingers on for a while, this is when you can taste the alcohol, it’s not bad. More flavors start coming out as it warms up, mild prunes, raisins; the malts now take a back seat.","vickersspitfire","Dec 28, 2012"

Pours a deep dark red with some mild khaki color head. Smell is great, but a tad benign compared to other heavy stouts. Malt, chocolate syrup, and vanilla. Huge toasted flavor, with lots of malt and milk chocolate. Good balance of sweet and bitter. Just a hint of alcohol. Little thinner in the mouth that one may expect, but also means it's not overly sticky. Overall, a great beer that's widely available. One of my favorites.","Samuel906","Nov 02, 2012"

I’m used to the imperial stout having that nice chocolate/coffee flavor going on, and even a little bit of hops like with the yeti imperial stout, but the hops in this compliment the beer in such an incredible way owing to their sheer overwhelming presence. But it works. Inexplicably it totally works, and the flavors come together and play off of one another to make one of the best beers out there. I’ve been told it’s North Coast’s best beer. Well I haven’t tried all of them yet but I’m inclined to agree. It’d be tough to beat this.","KKB","Oct 22, 2012"

Smell is mainly coffee and chocolate. Mouthfeel is a satisying fullness without being thick. Taste is robust.

It's quite interesting - the alcohol is noticeable and there is a touch of hops in there as well, but the foamy head and rich body come closer to a Young's stout than, say, the Stone Imperial Stout. And indeed, there is a chocolate profile which makes for a tasty, tasty beer. The only downside for me was the lack of strength of smell. I got some whiffs of malt and chocolate, but it didn't knock me back. I'll blame it on the glassware choice of the bar (regular pint glass) and not dock too much for it.","TheRealBigC","Jul 30, 2012"

Nose is dark, substantial, sweet, aged with moderate alcohol presence and roasted malt (need I tell?). Taste is strong, cooked, char-like coffee, dark chocolate, some dried fruit and plum-like flavors, and ethanol prominence, but well balanced with a bitterness that is decidedly not really a hoppy kind of bitterness after all. Taste profile does not modulate considerably over time. Mouth-feel is meal-like, substantive and filling.

4.01,-6.7,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"O - first off Old Rasputin is a damn good beer and really good RIS. One of the older players in this heavily BA category, it still holds itself well against the young bucks. It is very solid for the style if fairly unremarkable. Dont mistake this as average, of which it certainly isnt. Old Rasputin just doesnt knock your socks off in any particular way. But, considering its large distribution area, year round availability, relatively cheap price point and is considerably better than MOST breweries RIS, you could do far far worse.","Momar42","Jun 12, 2012"

Plenty of sticky lacing is left on the side of the glass as the head dissipates. Dark roasted barley malt, bitter chocolate, anise, dark fruits, dark coffee, some hops, and some alcohol round out the flavors. It has a nice, dark roasted flavor overall. The flavors are bold and well balanced. There is a bitter aftertaste. It should be noted that the alcohol taste is not strong despite this beer being 9% ABV. The body is full with adequate carbonation. This beer is smooth and the drinkability is high. This is an excellent beer and remains one of my favorite examples of this style. I've enjoyed this many times in the past and will continue to do so.","acevenom","Jun 12, 2012"

No light can escape this black hole of a beer. It leaves reams of thick creamy head on the glass with some light lacing as well. The nitro gives this beer a more evened out nose but also pulls away from some of the aromatics. It still smells great with a smoky coffee and fresh baked chocolate chip cookie. There is a hint of alcohol on the nose but not overwhelming. The taste is very nice. I love what a nitro does to a good stout. The beer is slightly sweet with some bitter malt flavor melding well with some well placed hop bitterness that takes a slightly woody taste. The mouthfeel is creamy and full bodied. Very slight alcohol burn. I really like this beer and I think the nitro is a different experience for an already world class beer.","estlinska","May 22, 2012"

Aroma is very present; a bountiful blend of chocolate, alchol, and hops. Roasted malt and bitter hops are at the forefront flavor-wise, with some chocolate and coffee playing more of a complementary role. Alcoholic warmth comes through in the finish, along with lingering bitterness. This is actually a little hoppier than I prefer a stout to be, but not surprising for a west coast offering. Either way, the bitterness is not outrageous, and it still leaves enough room for the lovely roasted malt to be appreciated. There's also a good amount of carbonation that lends a velvety texture to the brew. The thickness here is about right for a RIS, and the lingering stickiness gets my stamp of approval as well. Old Rasputin is certainly a tasty beer, though the slightly excessive bitterness keeps it from quite living up to the gorgeous presentation.","MaximalC","May 12, 2012"

4.36,1.4,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled 6/3/2011. Been a while since I first rated this one(9/2010). Pours almost pitch black color with some brown around the edges with an impressive 2 finger dense tan head with incredible retention that reduces to a thick cap that lasts. Some very nice soapy lacing on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, pine, herbal hop, caramel, biscuit, molasses, and slight dark fruit. Nice and well balanced aromas with good complexity and strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, pine, biscuit, caramel, coffee, molasses, toffee, herbal hop, charred malt, and slight citrus. Nice sized spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, charred malt, pine, herbal hops, and caramel and the finish for a while. Nice balance of hop flavors with roasted malt flavors. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Quite smooth to drink, but is still definitely a sipper. Alcohol is well hidden with only a warming after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Russian imperial stout, and an absolute classic in the style. Very robust and smooth; and extremely enjoyable to sip on.","superspak","Apr 14, 2012"

There's nothing fancy about this one, and sip after sip becomes a bit of a menacing chore, though a chore that's enjoyable in a masochistic sense. It's a beer that feels stronger than the 9% label would have you believe. I consider Old Rasputin to be the standard by which all RIS's should be judged.","TheSixthRing","Mar 11, 2012"

Body of the beer is black, though I think a deep brown would be a better descriptor, as it's not truly a jet black. Aroma is of dark sweet malts, roasted malts, chocolate, caramel. When I sip the beer I get flavors of dark chocolate, roasted notes, bitterness, malt sweetness. Body is not as thick as expected considering the smell and the high ABV.

No surprise that it is pitch black with a thin near brown head. There is a good aroma to this stout with molasses and bready notes. If you try this beer be ready for an intense experience. The flavor is big and brawny. Get ready for hints (or hits) of coffee grinds, unsweetened bakers chocolate, blackstrap molasses and toasted black bread. The aftertaste is long with some bitter coming through. This is not your starter stout, and I would recommend for those not familiar with stouts to work your way up to the Old Rasputin with some more mellow offerings. This is an overwhelming beer!","iSip","Feb 03, 2012"

It had that nifty rich head, which is a walnut color and it sat thick and tidy on top of the brew. The color was as black as night and very smooth feeling for something I was expecting to be heavy and syrupy. The powerful coffee opener was magical, there was NO BITTER BITE at the tail end. I was entranced. I broke out some organic white chocolate bark from Baltimore with almonds and blueberries it. The pairing was incredible. I don't get this excited about beers. I can't wait to carry it at the bar!!!","Windigo","Dec 08, 2011"

4.83,12.3,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"One of my all-time favorites. Poured into a pint glass, I had no trouble making a ridiculous perfectly foamy tan head that sat upon the black sea of liquid. Lacing is great and you have a sudsy film floating around the whole time your drinking, which might not be as long as you might expect with a strong brew like this. It has a very strong, roasted character. It smells almost woodsy or yeasty. There is coffee in there somewhere, perhaps even espresso? It has a decent hop bite too. Alcohol is present but not overwhelming for me. Definitely a sipper, it's just overwhelming with flavor and so damn heavy. It really stays on the tongue too. By far my favorite I've had by this brewery. I am going to try my hand at brewing a clone of this later this week. Looking at the grain bill, I can see why it is such an intense beer.","Whadawookie","Nov 07, 2011"

4.18,-2.8,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"I'm not usually one for Nitro beers, but I was feeling adventurous and decided to give an old classic a try. Pours black with a typically thick, dense, stable slab of a head on top that leaves much lacing on the glass. Nearly no aroma at first, but then a semi-sweet chocolate aroma emerges with an increased dark fruitiness as it warms. Tasty from the start...I think maybe a bigger stout like this is what I need from a nitro tap. Lots of chocolaty roast and a gentle creamy sweetness. Feels a little less than full bodied this way, but still obviously very smooth and floaty in the mouth. Whereas most nitro I come across is rather mild and bland, this is not...it works! It also reminds me that I need to revisit this widely available, great stout more often.","wedge","Nov 01, 2011"
4.35,1.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Addendum: This tastes very similar to Deschutes Black Butte porter (which is also very good) with more booze. Similar hop profile. Booze booze and more booze, and some licorice. Not very complex. Where's the beef? Give me control of the brewery and I could produce one hell of an inviting stout. Why can't these guys do the same?","gregb13","Oct 31, 2011"
4.35,1.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a motor oil black, with a weak looking 1 finger head, lots of slime and sticky bubbles. Big hops on the nose, followed by bitter coffee bean, bitter dark chocolate, vanilla milk chocolate, toasted malts. Chocolatety mayhem in my mouth right now, coffee/espresso, nice alcohol warming bitter coffee bean finish . Full bodied, creamy, smooth. Overall this beer was great, this beer aged well and tasted less like a coffee milk shake (as i thought it did fresh) and more like a great RIS. Very complex, rich and inviting.","gabedivision","Oct 31, 2011"
4.33,0.7,5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"O: Make no mistake, this is a RIS. Some stouts/porters can be a bit lighter or a bit sweeter...this is neither.

4.03,-6.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall: This is a sipper for sure with the higher ABV. I'm glad I tried it but my "go-to" RIS is still Brooklyn Black Chocolate. I would still say it's a "must try" for fans of the RIS style but I prefer my Imperial Stouts with a little less hop bite.","cmq103","Oct 30, 2011"
4.33,0.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured into a 16 oz snifter. Pours a slick black, with a 3 inch sticky mocha head, tons of lacing. Smell coffee, chocolate, some pine, and a hint of alcohol. Taste is all that, more piney hops than the smell would lead on. Body isn't the biggest, but nice. Perfect amount of life, helps it's dribkability. Temperature is so important to allow this beers flavors to completely shine, close to 55 is best. Lives up to the hype, most reviews I have ever noticed for this style.","SawDog505","Oct 29, 2011"

4.2,-2.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"-Overall 4.0: Excellent stout. These "Imperial" or "Russian Imperial" stouts all have a relatively high alcohol content, but this is balanced by a depth of flavor and a drinkability not common in other high-alcohol brews. Really, these could be viewed as "dark triples," due to the amount of ingredients that go into each beer. "Old Rasputin" is highly recommended. If you can find this beer, it is worth the monetary investment.","BeerDocT","Oct 19, 2011"
4.29,-0.2,5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours black and thick. Substantial tan head that forms of a billion tiny bubbles then morphs into a very slow fading creamy foam. Paints the inside of the glass as it recedes. Smells of roasted malts, some chocolate, hint of licorice. Mouthful is rich and thick - a real milkshake of a beer. Carbonation really hits just right for this beer. Tastes of chocolate, coffee, espresso beans, and dry baking chocolate. Finishes a little sweet w a kick of black licorice and some alcohol. Packs a wallop as far as stouts go - meaning a lot of the classic imperial stout flavors are here in strong showing. Really a well made beer. I know my home brew attempts at imperial stouts just can not get to this level.","mcslain","Oct 17, 2011"

4.43,3,4.5,4,5,4,4,"Pours a dark black with a large lasting head. Smells roasted with hints of chocolate and maybe some coffee. Tastes great, not my favorite RIS, but certainly amazing for the price. The flavor really blends well together in the mouthful and there’s a small alcohol taste that comes in during the mouthful but doesn’t affect the taste that much. Not the best RIS I’ve had but a very solid beer that is easy to pick up and relatively affordable. Certainly work keeping around.","codysjb","Oct 14, 2011"

4.27,-0.7,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Near jet black, ring of tan head, no lace to speak of. Smell is of big roasty malts, coffee, bakers chocolate, molasses, light dark sugary sweetness. Taste is of big roasted malts, coffee, bittersweet chocolate, long roasted finish, coffee grinds in aftertaste, light alcohol at points. Med-high carbonation, smooth and creamy, rich feel, would be perfect if the carbonation was toned down a bit. Really solid and hard to find faults in this, solid RIS.","peensteen","Oct 10, 2011"

4.3,0,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Thick as molasses as it pours, fills the glass as a deep black ruby with a thick tan 3 finger head, very good retention and lacing throughout. Surprised to at how hop forward the aroma is. Floral, blackberry, chocolate, oaky, earthy, boozy, caramel maltiness. Bitter hop bite up front, chocolate, roasted caramel, molasses, brown sugar, boozy, woody, chalky, smokey on the tongue. Very smooth finish for all the flavor, good full body, but does not overload the palate. Light warming down the hatch.

4.33,0.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"O- A shining example of a good Russian Imperial Stout. This is a real treat and a shame that my local wholesaler doesnt carry it. Very well-priced, as I can get this CA beer here in singles here in PA for about $3 a bottle.","BeerFiend2002","Oct 09, 2011"
4.38,1.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: A big beer that does not disappoint. I can certainly see how this beer has gained it's cult status. I would recommend this to anyone who's into big stouts and would buy it again.","setexascustoms","Oct 09, 2011"

4.28,-0.5,5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Sampled on October 8, 2011. The pour is remarkably black with a decent, silky tan head. The aroma is mildly malted and pleasantly hopped with a bit of licorice and a scent that makes me think of a wooden barrel. The body is medium to bold. The flavor has a mellower than usual malty taste for a Russian Imperial with a vibrant bitter but dry hopped ending. All the good things that people say about this one are true.","puboflyons","Oct 08, 2011"

Poured into a snifter from a bottle, beautiful black body with a stunning imperial stout head. First sip..boom lots of carbination almost too much almost burned my mouth, I didnt like that so I let it sit for a few minutes to warm up and still too much carbination which I did not enjoy at all kind of killed it for me. Good beer just too much carb definitely a lot of other Imperials out there that are better. Check out Moylans Imperial its a lot more satisfying.","Rangerator","Sep 26, 2011"
2.99,-30.5,4,2.5,3,3.5,3,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. I started drinking this fairly soon after it came out of the fridge. I started rating it and it really wasn't doing much for me, and the scores reflected it. I started to wonder how much of that was a result of it being too cold. So I've been letting it warm up, and giving it little nips every few minutes. It's starting to come around. I think I might take the rest of the six pack out of the fridge and just keep it at room temp. This had a nice, luscious, two finger crown at the top. The head seemed more fizzy than creamy. The nose is pretty faint. I all but inhaled beer through my nose trying to extract some kinda discernible characteristic, but I couldn't. It doesn't smell bad, so much as it just doesn't smell. The first thing I notice with the taste is the booze. The 9% is in your face, and not even remotely hidden. Some slight coffee notes, but mostly just...booze. When it was cold, the mouthfeel was very carbonated and really unpleasant. As it's warmed, it's gotten much creamier and coats the mouth with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Over all, I just don't get the fuss. I have three bottles left with which to form a different opinion, however. If it changes, I'll be back to edit..but right now, this just really isn't my thing.","Retail1LO","Sep 25, 2011"

3.83,-10.9,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"O: I had some high hopes for this one, but I believe I'm glad I only picked up a single of this one rather than a 4 pack. The beer itself is pretty good, the smell, and look of it are good, but I dont like the fact that it hangs with you after the fact.

Taste is slightly chocolate, espresso, roasty malt, dark fruit and subtle vanilla. Very well balanced with a hoppy bitterness that matches the sweet elements. Creamy carbonation and a medium heavy body is very nice for the style. The ABV comes through at the end. It's warming. Also a subtle bitterness is re-established.

As the head diminishes thick lacing coats the sides of the glass. Smell notes of dark chocolate, caramel, toffee, and coffee. Taste chocolate, light coffee, a warm touch of alcohol.

The pour was done well as the bartender gave it a litle rest prior to filling the pint to the top. The foam appeared and dissipated in about a minute. Color was quite dark. Flavors of coffee and chocolate. Well balanced. More importantly - the aroma and taste was consistent with the last time I've had it.

I've been converted to the cult of Rasputin. Old Rasputin RIS will always have a special place in my fridge or in my collection. It is a beer-drinkers treasure and every drop should be savored. I believe that I could session this beer. Not because I'm going to be drinking more than 3-4 pints of it, but because it demands respect and that you cherish its company while it is there. This isn't your one night stand; wham, bam, thank you mam-- this is a beer that deserves to be cherished and treated like the gem that it is. This brew and I have a long life together.

In some ways it lived up to the hype surrounding it, but in others it was a bit disappointing. It has more hops than most beers of this style, but that isn't really a detraction for me. I disliked the fact that too much alcohol was showing through and producing that medicinal or cough syrup effect.

I can imagine Old Rasputin is what happens when the flavor of Guinness Foreign Extra meets the feel of Guinness Draught. But that's way to simple. Old Rasputin has an amazing full-bodied thick and creamy mouth that just isn't present in any other stout I've ever encountered. Somehow, the best of many worlds is what you get with Old Rasputin. Nevertheless, the taste packed an unpleasant bitterness on the swallow that I judged to be an imperfection and I was also disappointed with the alcohol, not that it was present, but rather its location on the palate. These of course are personal peculiarities that others may in fact love. I'd like to try this beer again however, exceptionally paired.","mjw06","Jul 11, 2011"

There is a grape or fig taste lingering in the background, with a surge of bitterness in the finish. Not quite what I was expecting. Mouthfeel is full-bodied.

As far as imperial stout beer is concerned, however, this one is certainly lacking some of the patented flavors that define the style.

As it stands now this has to be one of the better RIS's I have had but Founder's Imperial Stout remains my favorite of this style, but Old Rasputin came pretty close. Everything was pretty spot on for it's style and the only thing I would have changed would be a little milder bitterness but I am sure six months to one year in the cellar could take care of that. This may become one of my go to RIS's, it is just so much more available then Founders Imperial Stout. If you are a fan of stouts then this is a must try, it sets a nice standard for RIS's. This beer made for a good first impression from North Coast and I now see why this beer gets so many high regards, combined with price and availability it makes for one damn fine brew, can't wait to see what else North Coast is working with.","StoutHunter","Jun 25, 2011"

The color matches a 38 on the SRM beer color chart. Looks black until you hold it up to a strong light, then the reddish, dark brown color appears. Smell is a jack hammer of thick intense fragrances of dark chocolate, French brewed coffee, maple syrup, toffee, caramel, lime, and malt. The taste is very complex, with flavors of malt, dark chocolate, molasses, toffee, caramel, plum, and brown sugar. Mouthfeel is smooth and thick, with a creamy sensation, and a prickly texture of carbonation. A great beer for a one time drinking session. I would like to have another at a latter date.","beerprovedwright","Jun 18, 2011"

Taste was much like the aroma, being dominated by chocolate and coffee with some nice hops up front. This brew masked the 9% very well. Medium-bodied and very smooth from start to finish. I typically am a hop-bomb IPA drinker and haven't experienced too many RIS but I was pleasantly surprised with this brew. Definitely will keep me coming back for more in the future.

The smell has some pine on the nose with a deep roasted aroma following after. The taste is explosive, it's hoppy and has a masterful chocolate taste.

This beer also has a deep bitter component with a rich character.

I remember the first time I tried it during Winter 2001-2002--when craft beer meant Sierra Nevada pale ale, Alaskan amber, Widmer wheat, or whatever stout I could get at the local brewpubs--and it was shocking to the senses. I may have thought that no beer should taste as this does. Now the beer endures, and it offers an honest look at how my palate has changed in a decade. Now (and especially on nitro-tap) it is a mellow and even old-fashioned take on the style, with a drinkability that is off the charts compared to its contemporaries. While some strong members of the porter-styles seem to struggle to separate roasty from smoky qualities, this is all roast and no smoke. It is chocolatey at the front-end, with a small finish that leaves room for that dessert such a beer is expected to accompany so well.","beagle75","May 24, 2011"

Ended up with about 2 fingers of creamy head. It fell back fairly quickly leaving a sticky lacking on the glass. The aroma was heavy with roasted malt, with hints of coffee and chocolate. Didn't catch any alcohol though from the 9% abv. Very smooth and creamy, with a nice balance of sweetness and chocolate, with bitterness from coffee and strong roasted malt flavors. Finishes cleanly with a slight lingering sweetness. While I didn't catch any in the nose, there is definitely a slightly warming alcohol present as you drink. Nothing overpowering or unpleasant though. Fairly light carbonation fits nicely with the rich full bodied beer. Overall I am impressed. One of the first true stouts I've tried and the introduction was well done. Might be setting the bar pretty high for the style","mjhorn","May 24, 2011"
4.3,0,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A very good stout, along the lines of Guinness' extra. Plus Rasputin is on the bottle. Pours a dark brown-black with a finger of tan head that recedes to a fine layer of lace. Heavy dark malt aroma, chocolate and coffee notes. Roasty taste of dark malts, coffee, dark chocolate, with hints of licorice, tobacco, raisins, and brown sugar. A bite of bitterness and alcohol in the finish. Smooth, strong, and a very tasty drink.","Rifugium","May 22, 2011"

3.76,-12.6,4,3,4,4,4,"Looks good, smells fine but taste is where this one really shines. The best way I can describe it is Abyss Light. Licorice, molasses, a roasted quality that isn't over the top.

I will always go back to this brew.","Huhzubendah","May 16, 2011"

Lacing is pretty good despite the gentle pour. Breathing in the scent, one knows what imperial stouts should be. Strong malt and coffee/caramel aromas that the tastes match. A bit on the heavy side, but it IS an imperial stout and it should be. It lingers on the tongue and in the mouth with a hearty feel.

The malt isn't overbearing, allowing dark chocolate flavors to play on the palate and become more pronounced in the finish. Very easy to drink for 9% abv. The mouthfeel and palate are very well rounded so you don't feel super weighed down. Still, its obvious why they only sell it in 4-packs. Its a big brew meant for moderation and special occasions.

FIS offers considerably more in complexity and flavor. The best quality for Raspy is in the smell; I'm really enjoying that milk chocolate aroma.

The stout has an average amount of lacing. The stout has an aroma of burnt malt, chocolate, and expresso. The aroma is outstanding! The taste is complex you get the malty burnt taste which gives way to chocolate and expresso. This beer tastes exactly like it smells! Great! There is also a nice afterthought of bitter hops and has a nice warm finish. The warming effects of the 9% alcohol cap off each sip. Awesome beer, Simply Awesome!

Can't get a read on the carbonation that may be going on in the near blackness. Aroma is a rich, thick smell of roasted, toasty malt. There is a hint of coffee and smoke, and it's a pleasantly sweet aroma. 1st sip is a thick, rich, creamy shot of dark unsweetened chocolate, black unsweetened coffee, smoky peat, bitter hops, and alcohol! There's a lot for the tastebuds to process here! Mouthfeel is also thick, rich, & creamy. This beer is stout in every sense of the word! As for drinkability, these are so potent I think 2, maybe 3 is all I could do in one sitting, but that's not meant to be a negative. This ain't some weak-ass lager for playing quarters with!

All I can discern is roasted malts with a slight licorice edge. The flavor is somewhat muted with burnt malt, chocolate, and a slight metallic flavor. The nitrogen thins out what would normally be a substantial body. I usually feel that what is lost in putting a beer on nitro is made up for with the creaminess that is imparted.

Dark as a moonless night, and a decent aroma of coffee (albeit somewhat old coffee) and chocolate with a peculiar scent of lavender, which seems totally out of place but added a nice tilt to the beer. The bitterness is, relatively speaking, rather low but still elbows the malt and chocolate to the side. And then there's the ginormous head that never really goes away and is so puffy and thick that it made me want to lay my head into it and take a nap.

4.3,0,4,4,5,4,3.5,"Each sip is extremely creamy; the body explodes and releases in the mouth. Initially, the flavors are those of sweet but dark coffee malts and raisins. Later, the body settles and shows its massive roasted malt content with some buttering hops along for the ride. Around this time you notice that the beer packs quite an alcoholic punch, but definitely takes a back seat to the grain content. This dark, malty rush gives way to the yeast-laden dark chocolate from the aroma which lingers before the bitterness of the roasted malts returns to the tongue. Fortunately, sweet mocha accompanies the finish, making this an intense but drinkable beer. Of course, if you are new to stouts, you might want to try something less devious instead.","HarrisonDean","Feb 18, 2011"

The taste is full of roasted malt, a bit of mocha sweetness with a slight amount of hop bitterness at the end. Full bodied flavor with medium carbonation. Watch out the 9% abv will sneak up and hit you in the ass! This beer is not for everyone. It has very strong and bold flavors.

4.28,-0.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a very dark brown, almost black but with a ruby tint. Massive, foamy brown head that leaves lots of sticky lacing on the glass. A very elegant yet supple-looking beer. Aroma is rich with roasted malts, dark fruits and chocolate. Taste is similar, but also with a slight burnt or smoky taste to it, but not too bitter. Good balance of hops and malt, has a nice sweetness that isn't overpowering. Has an average level of carbonation and healthy medium-thick mouthfeel. The 9% abv is more noticeable to me as the beer warms, leaving a lingering alcohol warmth in the aftertaste. Still despite being a sipping beer for me, I think other BA's could go through two or three with no problem, it's a delicious beer that would go well with a dessert or hearty meat dish. This is better than Storm King, IMO because it isn't too bitter or burnt-tasting, focusing on rich malt flavor. I would like to try this again, perhaps with a fresher bottle or on-tap. Highly recommended!","Sudsy89","Feb 08, 2011"

The aroma is of dark roast coffee, chocolate, hint of anise, smoke. It is smooth and rich in the mouth. The taste is sublime, without being overwhelming, and although it's a stout, care was taken to preserve a hop finish.

4.05,-5.8,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Poured from a bottle, out of a 4-pack. The stout produces a significant 1/4-1/2" head, thin but prominent. Very opaque and dark beer to go along with creamy-tan head. Initial smell yields aromas of oak/nutty undertones, with a kind of musty coffee and chocolate theme. There was minimal forward taste, and the beer has a quick, sharp aftertaste. There is a smooth coffee flavor, that has a balanced bitterness throughout the beer, but the flavor is short-lived. It truly seems to skip from the initial flavor straight to aftertaste. It does leave a strong, thick residue on the glass, which goes well with the strength of a stout. Overall, a very drinkable beer.","GarthDanielson","Nov 19, 2010"

4.95,15.1,5,5,5,4.5,5,"Old Rasputin will make a man out of you (Rip Van Winkle, for one). Always pours with an explosive, swelling head, big and busty, and the perfect shade of ash and gravel. Scummy, sparkling lacing. The liquid is impenetrably black - a charred void. Black death. The aroma hits you instantaneously, even from a foot or more away. More of a Baltic Porter scent than a bitter, dry stout. What I get is dark chocolate cake dipped in dark chocolate, mellow espresso, grain just lightly singed, and wafting among these scents, a faint grassy/piney hop presence. Oh, and a clean, vodka-like alcohol aroma, more and more as it warms. Flavor-wise, I'm not sure what you can improve upon, considering the style and imagery conjured up by the namesake of the beer. Cold and black. A sultry bitterness - by way of hops, dark chocolate, and dark malt. Velvety smooth feel and vague molasses character, with surprisingly potent fruitiness and almost citrus hop flavors as it warms. While this doesn't need to warm up much to express its fabulous complexities, the alcohol makes itself quite apparent in the aftertaste and feel past a certain degree. Once in awhile, this can be somewhat off-putting. For the most part, you really want this though. Carbonation, at its levels, is ideal and maintains excitement on the tongue - never any cloying sweetness or heavy feeling. That, and the warm prick of ethyl, round out an expertly crafted brew. So difficult to put this into perspective...when you've had 2 or 3.","Bouleboubier","Nov 18, 2010"

The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a somewhat thick and chewy feel.

Strong tasting brew, kicking you off with coffe, roasted malts, the cocoa beans finishing off with a dry and bitter aftertaste. Good drinkability but due to the abv% it should't be taken lightly.

The aromas were the traditional cocoa nibs and coffee with a hint of sweet caramel and bourbon in the back. The taste was most definitely of the sweet caramel and a bit slighter on the bourbon flavor. The chocolate comes through on the aftertaste and the coffee is hiding in there somewhere amongst the roasted flavors.

Taste includes a mixture of alcohol, roasty grain and slightly citrusy hop bitterness upfront that blends through a medium creamy smooth body with more flavors of dark grainy sweetness. The roasted grains suggest black coffee, dark chocolate and dark skinned fruits much like the aroma indicated. There is a pleasant lingering bitterness from the darkly roasted grain coupled with the flavor and warmth of alcohol.

As I sip my opinion of the beer improves, the dark coffee flavor is still most prevalent while dark chocolate makes a little more noise than in the nose and there's also a slight warming sensation from the alcohol. Great mouthfeel on this beer as the body is nice and big and chewy, while the carbonation is suitably low.

Deep chocolate notes, some slightly metallic notes, some other stuff I can't rightly place. Maybe a touch of bourbon. Flavor is dramatic. Nothing hits you immediately, but quickly a blast of flavor attacks. Complex, somewhat bitter but not too bitter. Somewhat sweet, but not too sweet. It's kinda like a Charleston Chew that's been frozen and dipped in espresso flavored syrup. This is incredible beer. The bitterness is sharp, but dissipates into a long, wonderful hop finish. Clearly one of the World's finest ales, without a doubt. Excellently priced, too. This was $1.69/12oz. bottle.

It's great for one drink but probably too heavy for two in one sitting, not to mention 9% ABV","hangh","Jul 10, 2010"
4.33,0.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours black as night with a light brown, two-finger head which leaves a nice frothy lacing. Pleasant creamy chocolate/coffee aroma with a little dark fruit and citrus/pine hops as well. Big roasted flavor. Sweet chocolate and roasted, bitter coffee up front. Pretty hopped up RIS with some pine and sweeter citrus rind. More roasted, dry, somewhat burnt malts on the finish. A very abrupt halt to the flavors after finish. Kind of like a really big Irish dry stout, but with the flavor amped up 10-fold. Creamy, thick mouthfeel.","uustal","Jul 10, 2010"

4.88,13.5,5,4.5,5,5,5,"Pours a solid black with a thick, ultra creamy tan-brown head of about 2 inches. The head is persistent and settles in at 1.5 inches. The initial nose suggest dark roast, coffee, chocolate and chicory. The body is medium-full to full. The initial taste expounds on the coffee and chocolate notes with added sweet notes that suggest a confection. The middle notes are full, creamy and rich followed by a smooth lingering. The rich, sweet, roasted notes moderate the bitter hops which are noticeable but not overpowering. This is a multi-layered, rich, ale. The alcohol is evident and provides warmth in the finish. This is not a session beer despite the moreish tendencies. Nice, broad Belgian lace forms. Yes, I will return to it.","carlborch","Jul 06, 2010"

Pours jet black with a decent level of carbonation and a big creamy tan head that shows good retention. The aroma is hugely dark and heavy with intense notes of chocolate, coffee and dark forest fruits. The taste is dark and bitter from the start with flavours of the highest quality cocoa, strong bitter espresso and a earthy smokey peat. After a few sips it is really the coffee flavours that come through the strongest, providing a massively rich imperial stout. The feel is full bodied and silky smooth, with just the right amount of carbonation. This is a superb imperial stout, one of the best i have tasted.

I love it when the heads are creamy, almost ice cream like. As part of them falls away to reveal the delicate insides of tasty cloud. The taste is more effervescent than I thought and man a lot going on. Well you have the fruity flavours from the malt. Deep roasty and a mix of more flavours than I can identify. Almost a plum, slight strawberry, bit of cherry and ten other things that I can't begin to emote. Leaves a taste of slightly overcooked toast and those lovely fruit flavours.

Quite a bit of alcohol on the nose and a fair amount of dark roasted coffee with some smoky hops. Very chocolaty flavor with a fair amount of burnt coffee beans. The alcohol is very noticeable. Body is full and creamy with more notable alcohol warming. As this one warmed up more I'm finding the body and the malts a tad bit thin for an Imperial Stout. I would almost compare this more to a good Baltic Porter. I know I'm nitpicking on that issue, but I couldn't think of any other way to make note of my observation.","punkrkr27","Apr 13, 2010"

The aroma is likewise a terrific example of what an imperial stout should smell like, with notes of dark bittersweet chocolate and heavily roasted malts. The flavor is also packed with dark chocolate, malts that are roasted to the point of charring, and a dark caramel sweetness. The body is a bit thin, but it is smooth and warming.

Pretty much the classic American RIS with no barrels or adjuncts needed. Based on aging experiments, I'd say this beer is probably best enjoyed on the fresher side, but 4-packs are pretty inexpensive, so if you're into cellaring I say go for it.

However, after taking home some Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout, I was pleasantly surprised by this North Coast Brew. It had a very nutty and dark smell with very low carbonation. I really enjoyed drinking this beer and after finishing all of them, I quickly realized why they only come in a four pack. As an NC native, I drink a lot of Duck Rabbit Milk Stout and I found Old Rasputin to be kind of a heavier thicker version of duck rabbit.

4.67,8.6,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Now I'm a fledgling beer reviewer, so don't be too hard on me. I judge a beer mostly on taste and that's why Old Rasputin gets so many high marks from me. The smell of this stuff is great too. I can't resist taking a wiff when I crack open a bottle. The taste is complex, full, chocolatey, hint of strong black coffee. Finish a tad dry, but the suggestion of sweet in the beginning more than compensates for this. Mouthfeel wonderful, might be the high APV that gives it a wee bit of listerine intensity. I can drink these all day long. As an enjoyer of stouts, this beer strikes me as highly drinkable though not everyone will share this opinion. It is worth note that after about three or four bottles you can look at the label and almost see Rasputin working his wicked magics upon you. All and all this is a stellar beer, one of my personal faves that no fan of stouts should pass up without giving it a try. High APV always a plus in my book too. 9% Hot diggity!

4.85,12.8,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"This RI stout is fantastic. The drinkability is probably higher than almost any RIS or IS or IPA I've had, or should I say any beer of 8.1%+. I like the bitterness and tang which separates it from most RI's, there is a crisper finish to me and a hint of welcome metallic tones. It almost seems like someone added a few tablespoons of Newcastle to this one. Additionally, there's a bit of sweetness which comes in the form of distinctive carmel. The texture in the mouth is a bit less viscous than the Stone, my permanent reference point, but also a bit less round and unified. Again one could say mouthfeel is heading towards Newcastle or even Guiness ever so slightly (and just slight enough). Besides that rare nutty-metallic tang, Rasputin has lovely dark malty flavors with the coffee/chocolate/toffee somewhere and just enough herbal notes to round it off. It's rare that a beer can avoid overdoing the hoppy and floral tones to my liking while still including them, and this one does it to perfection. If you're a fan of floral tones, I've noticed those flavors are more pronounced as you approach room temperature, where the beer seems more oily and chewy.","willPS21","Feb 11, 2010"

4.42,2.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured into a Duvel tulip glass. This beer pours black in color, only slight highlights of dark brown while pouring it. There is a tan colored head, similar to a cola head just less fizzy. It goes away only after a few minutes. I didn't expect to see much lacing to it, but it has a different sort of stick to it. It's almost like a syrupy consistency that every so slowly slides back down to the liquid on each sip you take. The aroma has quite a bit going on and in my opinion is much better from the bottle than on tap. As most RIS's there is a great deal of chocolate in the smell as well as the roasted malts and some roasted coffee too. The hops really stand out in the smell however, and are probably the most dominant feature. It took me several sips before I noticed how strong the hop taste was. Initially you taste the dark chocolate and roasted coffee. It's well malted too, but overpowered by the coffee and chocolate. After the 3rd sip or so, the hops again become a more dominant feature of the flavor. It's still a very tasty beer, a great combination of all the ingredients. The mouthfeel was good, but after awhile, the hops leave your moth just the slightest bit too dry. Its still full bodied while at the same time being a little silky, but it's still certainly more dry than it needs to be. This is still a very drinkable RIS, or beer in general.

I would say it has medium retention and creaminess. Leaves nice thick lacing on my glass. Smells of nice dark roasted malts, coffee and chocolate with a nice sweetness (oatmeal?) overlapping it all. The alcohol bite to the nose only adds to this great balance of smell, a nice strong one too. Tastes mainly of dark roasted malts, sweets and chocolate. There is an alcohol bite here that grows enormously as the beer warms up. It started out balanced in but becomes a tiny bit off-balance over time. This does not ruin the taste at all, still a great dose of roasted malts in here. Mouthfeel here is nice and thick, creamy with perfect carbonation for the taste. The alcohol warming does not really take over this beer. Very nice mouthfeel. Drinkability is great here, good taste, great price for an RIS, the alcohol might get to be a bit too much after a while but I will continue to buy this and it is so worth it for the quality of this beer.","cbutova","Oct 30, 2009"

The nose is of sweet toffee, roasty malt, and cocoa powder. The flavor is more fo the same, with a nice touch of espresso, a raisiny sweetness, followed by a bitter cocoa/espresso finish, there is also a hint of earth in there somewhere. The mouthfeel is superb, very creamy, nice and thick but not syrupy, very smooth.

Mouthfeel was just shy of medium-bodied, but a bit too much carbonation for the style - I like my RIS's lightly carbonated and oily/viscous.

Nose is obviously well-hopped, with citrus and fruit notes hovering over the menacingly dark chocolate. Treacle and plum sit in the mix as well, fabulously complex and alluring. Taste is a minor step back, as the hops step forward and the vinous character takes a distinct back seat to the slam of coffee and chocolate. Still there is a nice note of tobacco in the mix, which keeps it lively and interesting. Mouthfeel is nice and thick, not overpowering though, and drinkability is solid.

The head is about 1 inch thick that is tan in color. The aroma is chocolate and coffee. Roast malt with a fresh baked preztle hint to it. The flavor is a delicious blend of coffee and chocolate. Hints of bready malt shine through as well. A moderate hop bite sneaks in at the end. I feel it has a medium body to full body that never feels heavy considering the style. This is one of the most drinkable RIS I've ever had. It's not cloyingly sweet or thick and syrupy like this style tends to lean towards. I could see downing a few of these.

The beer had a high enough viscosity to cling to the sides of the glass when swirled a bit. The initial taste had hints of sweet fruitiness, but was quickly replaced with a nice strong bitter taste of malt. There was a hint of an aftertaste that I could do without.

Easily reaches blackness in color, no real change in hue to be found, opaque, like duh. Bitter chocolate and coffee bean, nuts and cherry, plum fruit fill up the nose, has a distinct mineral and grass element to it which gives it an erect bearing, overall roasted feel gives it lift and an agreeable verve. Medium to full-bodied, prickly carbonation disperses the weight nicely. Black licorice, dark chocolate, coffee bean and brazil nuts give it some breadth. The hops give it a sour twist and slight grain, straw flavoring, floral at turns. Carbonation also brings out a little minerally edge. Has more of a cleansing feel than you'll find in most RIPs.

The head is kind of thin (<1cm) and dense, which leaves bits of lacing down as I drink. The smell is filled with sweetness, but deep in there are dried fruits (maybe from some esters or the black patent), the roasted barley - coffee type smell, and a light nose of chocolate. I can imagine a better smell, in terms of complexity, this one is about normal, but because its so intense, the smell is very much more inviting. The taste is very complex, and includes all of the usual suspects. The first sip has this dark, overripe plum taste, almost a hint of slick dark tartness, but with a pleasant sweetness. Then comes the coffee flavor, just flavor - no bitterness, and the sweetness still lingers, up until the last bite of chocolate. A roastiness fills as it goes down, again with the dried fruits, but overall pleasant. The mouthfeel is nice, pretty full, but kind of slick, this one fits the bill in terms out mouthfeel, but isn't a standout. An easy drinker for sure, I mean, you have to sip, but easy, good for the style. Recommended for an easily accessible RIS.","taylorhamrick","Apr 29, 2009"

By chance a liquor store near me that has a paltry craft beer selection happens to carry this. The appearance is "none more black" even held up to the light BLACK! There is a medium tan head which quickly goes away. It smells mostly of coffee and dark chocolate, maybe a little burnt caramel and oak. The taste is everything in the smell, add a little dried fruit and hop bite. Mouth feel is silky and a little sticky with enough hops to balance it out to not be "sticky sweet" I could pretty much drink this beer until the high alcohol knocked me out, it is not difficult to drink at all.","littlekidlover","Apr 22, 2009"

3.82,-11.2,4,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"The latest in my foray into Russian Imerpial Stouts, trying to discover why they so dominate the "best beers in the world" lists. It pours pitch black with a medium tan head that is dense and creamy and leaves one of the densest lacings I've seen. Smell is musty wood, leather, raisins, and oranges. The taste is surprisingly sweet, and not at all acrid or burnt as so many others I have tried. It tastes of coffee, soft malt, leather, and a pleasant chalkiness. The mouthfeel is a good balance of carbonation and chewiness. The drinkability is limited by the bitter finish. This fades nicely through the aftertaste, but it is a bit intense for a while. Probably the best of the style I've tried, but I suppose I'm just not a true believer.","roblowther","Apr 14, 2009"

Was quite a bit more drinkable than I anticipated, with roasted black malt dominating the pallate, with some caramel/toffe notes swiming around and lingering on my tounge. Mouthfeel was rich & creamy, enticing another drink. Not quite as hoppy as Storm King, but somehow slightly creamier similar to, but not nearly as sweet as a Cream Stout. The alcoholic flavors were not present as in some beers of this magnitude.

The flavor is of freshly ground coffee beans, roasted chocolate, some smoke/burnt wood, vanilla and rum notes, and bad vodka?. The feel is a bit harsh for my liking. The body is nice and chewy and there is a nice smoothness to it but there is also a raw booziness that I am not fond of. Not a red wine booziness but hard alcohol booziness. Like I mentioned before, kind of reminds me of bad vodka out of a plastic jug.

4.5,4.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"(Bottle) The" pop" sound from the bottle cap is very inviting and calming; there is carbonation! Some haze rising from the bottleneck seconds after. The pour is dark brown with some mahogany notes as well as a dark reddish hint. In the glass, the beer looks darn black. On top of everything, you get a one finger high, medium brown head. The first thing that hits you ones you sniff the beer is a massive, 50/50 blend of dark caramel and deluxe-ish, dark creamy chocolate. Higher, more burned tones of blackcurrant/tar-like liquorice, bitter cocoa, deep caramelized brown sugar and black coffee beans/aromatic espresso. The hop profile in this beer is becoming more extreme for every year. I have stored this beer for more then one year and the aroma hops is still full of citric/grapefruity and resiny notes. The alcohol is also impressive; not too sharp nor too aggressive, it just adds more elegance to the nose. A light dark fruitiness is lurking in the background. The roast is dry and the caramel is sweet - just perfect. The flavour is a mix of elegant roasted and burned malts with tones of dark chocolate, dark caramel, black coffee/espresso, liquorice, tar and asphalt. The hops bring obvious notes of citrus and resin, but there is also some room for earth and grass. The mouthfeel is round, smooth and light silky with a soft, easy carbonation. A dark fruity touch of prunes and dry raisins. The aftertaste is noting less the stellar with a touch of citrus, dry coffee/cocoa roast and a light sweet port hint. Medium to full bodied. This beer is has a perfect malt profile. The hops a bit too tart, still fantastic!","Blursimarsi","Nov 22, 2008"

The first taste is intense roasted flavors followed by a intense bitterness of hops.Neither one of the intense flavors in this beer are all that appealing to me. As I drink this beer the drinkability of this beer is decreasing with each sip. The beer is increadibly roasty at first then it transitions into a very bitter flavor from the hops and then it finishes with alcohol. The beer is intense in the mouth it is increadibly rough with the bittering hops. Overall the beer is a good night cap beer that is ggod to drink once in awhile. Compared to other RIPS it is slightly better than average. Worth trying and would buy again. I live in Portland Maine and buy this beer off tap at Novre Res and have to say off tp this beer is increadible. The flavors are subdued a lot and there is more of a balanced flavor.

Mouthfeel is slick, chewy, coats the tongue, with good carbonation, good balance between medium-heavy body and medium carbonation. Taste is roasted grain up front, with coffee, vanilla, dark chocolate, cocoa, charred oak, and a dry finish.

I get no hint of alcohol at this point - maybe some will poke out as it warms. The taste mirrors the smell with plenty of chocolate and coffee followed by a long, bitter finish that invites you back for more. The beer is very full bodied and somewhat sweet - making it more of a sipper than a quaffer. My only other RIS reference point is Sprecher's, which I find unbalanced and plodding on the palate.

It's a dark, dark brown and has a head that's a bit lighter than ideal, but it still looks good. The nose is full of chocolate with some coffee, malt and other complexity. Chocolate comes through strongly in the flavor. There's really a lot going on, more than I'm able to describe accurately, anyway. There is some sweetness, a lot of malt, some coffee and some hoppiness. It's a good RIS, which puts it beyond my relatively undeveloped descriptive capabilities. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth with good carbonation. The drinkability is high, and the beer has a nice dry finish to complement its complex flavors.

Some unsweetened chocolate appears as the brew warms and the 9% ALC becomes more apparent. Very smooth on the palate with a perfectly balanced malt/hop ratio and low carbonation helping to give this one a high drinkability.

Great lacing on the beer as well; the nose is pretty much loaded with dark chocolate malts. There is a great bittering chocolate taste and hints of coffee initially, while the beer ends with a bitterness from the hops and coffee. The bitterness is simply addicting, and is making me want to drink it. The alcohol is completely covered up! The beer is thick and slightly creamy, solid for a RIS. There is a lot of flavours in the beer, and it's definitely drinkable.","swizzlenuts","Jul 31, 2008"

4.38,1.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"My motto is the darker the better, and this time I have met my match. I have heard about Ol' Rasputin and as soon as I stumbled across this fine brew I purchased a couple. Drawn to the great name and label I was intrigued in the high alcohol content. Pours easily with a thin head. This beer is very aromatic and has a thick consistency. The flavor is wonderfully complex to say the least. I was very surprised to discover that the overall flavor hides the strong alcohol content really well. To date this is the best stout I have ever enjoyed. I Will definately keep a few of these in stock for my personal enjoyment. \Additional rating on 12-10-07 of (2) cellared bottles, exact age is uncertain. Opaque, rich brown pour with a 1" thick lasting dark tan head and amazing lacing. Aromas of dark bitter chocolate, chilled coffee, and sharp hops. Alcohol is detectable to the nose. This beer is very full bodied and bitter-sweet. Thick and creamy with a light alcohol burn and smooth finish. Rich flavors of coffee, fudge, burnt and nutty malts. Large chocolate presence and a firm bitterness, the hop flavor really breaks through once the beer warms up some. One of the the first imperial stouts I sampled, and after a couple years it still remains high on the list.","kinger","Jul 29, 2008"

Smells roasty, with strong baker's chocolate, caramel, and a tinge of citrussy hops. Tastes very roasty with dark chocolate, hints of caramel and toffee, and just enough grassy/citrussy hop flavor and bitterness to balance the malt. Hints of alcohol in both the mouthfeel and flavor.

Aroma of coffee, a bit of chocorama, and some nice hop bitter character which was a pleasant surprise coming to the nose of such a dark ale.

Head holds nicely, leaving thick tracings of lace across the glass. Smell is dark chocolate, cherry syrup, buscuit, a bit of piney floral hop still coming through and some alcohol. Taste is cocoa powder, espresso, chocolate cake, a bit of grainy earth finish (this is most likely the death of the hops) with a hint of alcohol across the back of the throat. Fantastic!

It had tons of bittersweet/dark chocolate flavor with a bit of hops in the aftertaste. The alcohol wasn't too apparent, and there actually wasn't much coffee in the flavor either.

Tastes of caramel and toffee at the forefront followed by a slight hop bitterness that fits in perfectly. Being a neophyte, the complexity of the smell and taste is more than I can tackle description wise. Mouth-feel is sinewy, creamy and smooth. Probably the tastiest stout I've ever had.

The nose is mostly roasted malts and coffee with a bit of hops. The flavor is more of the same, but with greater intensity. The hops really come out in the aftertaste. I'd say this is one of the hoppier Imperial Russian Stouts that I've had. Surprisingly, at 9% ABV, there's no aroma or taste of alcohol. It's completely overwhelmed by the malt and hops. The mouthfeel isn't as thick as most Imperial Russian Stouts, which is neither a good or a bad thing. It just is.

The taste was even more delicious. I have had this beer before on tap, and I love it. But the nitro makes it that much more smoother and silky. Tastes like a chocolate imperial stout milkshake.

But the finish isn't off-putting; in fact, it has a fairly assertive bitterness still. It's leaving thick lace curtains! Getting good chocolate and coffee flavor throughout.

Body is heavy, but not too heavy, carbonation is zippy, and finish is dry and satisfying. This is a drinkable stout, is small quantites of course, but it goes down pretty well.

Taste - it's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's rich and tasty. Huge flavor. Chocolate mostly, as the smell made quite clear. A meal in itself. Great, thick beer with enough carbonation to keep it lively. A great beer to sip and contemplate, read, or enjoy a chat with a close friend. Don't have too many of these.

The taste is amazing for those who like dark beers. You have layers of flavor, malt and hops, even some chocolate hints. Very complex flavor and surprisingly lighter then it looks. The most interesting thing to me is that the flavor out weighs the bitterness in your mouth. All that dark goodness coats your mouth and blends very well. A big, complex beer with a lot going on.

The head is dirty brown. The smell is thick, oily, molasses, cherry overtones, dark roasted coffee, and sweet malts. This beer is full bodied, strong, bitter, and not for the faint at heart. Perhaps I'm the faint at heart because I couldn't imagine drinking more than one. I can appreciate the style to a point, but then it is just a strong espresso, molasses, bitter and biting roasted malt brew that just stings in the mid section. On the very tail end, some sweet malts and cherry like flavors emerge, but not until I've been hit over the head by the mid section and beyond of just bitter and strong flavors. As the beer settles a bit, the more warming alcohol notes and the sweeter malts present themselves sooner. The aftertaste is a bit over the top for me as well.

I usually drink one or two of these in a sitting and enjoy them alongside a good cigar and then finishing with my favorite dark chocolate. This is one of my favorite beers of all time and definitely my favorite Russian Imperial Stout. I recently spent painstaking hours translating the Cyrillic writing on the label and found that СЕРДЕЧНЫЙ ДРУГ НЕ РОДИТСЯ ВДРУГ means HEART FRIEND IS NOT BORNE SUDDENLY. I feel that this means that a dear friend is not made overnight, so I recommend that you never drink this beer alone but always try to share one with a friend in honor of the Old Man which had many enemies who tried killing him on several occasions and finally succeeded but not before he had his fill of women and brew.

Very rich smell with hints of coffee, burnt malts, toffee - very complex. Rich chocolatey taste with a great creamy mouthfeel and a nice bit of alcoholic burn.

I know that's what makes it "Imperial" (what with the not freezing on the way to the czar), but maybe somehow it could be incorporated better into the flavors? I don't know -- sometimes I'm drinking this and wonder if someone dropped a shot of Everclear in it without telling me.

Complex aromas of roasted barley, chocolate malts, left-coasted hops, blackberry, and some bakers' chocolate. Full-on roastiness with hints of salty soy sauce and espresso. Some sweetness creeps in as it warms. High alpha hops provide a dry and bitey finish. Alcohol is completely hidden. Carbonation is at a good level to cut the thickness.

Very thick and creamy, low carbonation and strong coffee (cant pinpoint what kind as I'm not a coffee drinker) and nice taste of chocolate at the end, little bit of alcohol taste but its hidden beneath everything else.

Starts with a touch of burnt malt, some nice underlying sweetness throughout. Hops make their presence felt in the finish. It just feels like everything is big and balanced in this beer- everything in perfect proportion. It manages to be huge, delicous, and nuanced without being totally overpowering. Nice full mouthfeel. I think this is exceptionally drinkable for the style. Perhaps my favorite imperial stout.","burnstar","Jun 13, 2007"

4.38,1.9,5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Short stubby brown 12oz bottle with Rasputin in grainy black and white waving a protection spell at the drinker. Let us hope it's not a hex spell. The first time I grabbed this was 1992 when I was in my "I'll buy that because it's something I've never tried" phase. I'm still in that phase it seems. Appearance is a perfect black brew with a little bit of light sneaking in at the edges and a beautiful tan head with lots of sticky retention. This is probably my favorite smelling imperial stout; mocha, malted milk and dark chocolate aromas dominate. Tastes are these same flavors but with an alcohol warmth and a hoppy balance. Old rasputin is creamier than most imperial stouts and has a thick mouthfeel. Drinkability is high for the style but this is still a sipping beer. One of my favorite west coast breweries, North Coast set the standard on imperial stouts with this now classic brew. I've never gotten a bad or skunked bottle in 15 years so if you see it here on the east coast it is a must try.","mshallah","May 30, 2007"

A bit of hops gives it a nice quick bitter finish. Lingering tastes of coffee and chocolate. Full bodied. Maybe a little bit too much carbonation for my tastes. Overall, this is a very well done beer. Maybe not the best of the imperial stouts, but definately worthy of a try.","mdm46410","May 28, 2007"

Its a great looking stout to be sure, but its seriously aligned toward the bitter end of the spectrum, which to me overwhelms the underlying flavor complexity. Definitely allow this one to warm up for maximum viscosity and mellowness. Certainly worth a try; Im just not certain that it lives up to its reputation.

Tastes of chocolate and coffee, with a nice little bit of heat at the end, warms the belly nicely. Overall, a very nice beer.

Very good retention - left rings around the glass. Smells and tastes of all sorts of dark wonderfulness: cherries, dark roast coffee, some dark chocolate, raisins, red grapes. At times the aromas reminded me of a great red wine - a tad woody, smoky, and spicy. Lots of complexity all around, and the flavors and aromas changed as it warmed up in my hand. Thick, heavy mouthfeel - not too creamy - it fits the character well. Overall, a very drinkable beer - highly recommended. A wonderful, complex drink.","ndekke39","May 20, 2007"

The nose was roasted, slightly smokey, a little burnt. The mouthfeel wasnt as creamy as some stouts--but not thin or watery at all. This stout was not dry, rather a bit sticky and syrupy. The moderately strong alcohol (8.9%) was not noticeable at all. The taste was very nice.

Alcohol is not detectible, suprisingly being 9%. Mouthfeel is thick and extremely smooth. No harsh finish associated with other RIS. Drinkability is high, except for the abv.

Finishes extremely dry, leaving an aftertaste of strong whisky and woody, earthy flavors. Haven't had anything like this before- certainly a sipping brew if there ever was one.

The aroma is roasted malt, chocolate and coffee. It tastes like coffee, roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate. The beer also has a good lingering bitter hoppy finish, with nice balance. Mouthfeel is medium/full, and it's creamy and has just the right amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's nice and smooth. Alcohol is noticeable, but not bad.

The beer is nearly black. I can tell from the foam on my hand that it is a very sticky brew. The smell is really fresh. I don't know how else to explain it. Green, not as in 'green beer', but floral with chlorophyll aromas. Well roasted malts with a touch of piny hops. The flavor is great. Bold, rich, smooth, and burnt. It tastes similar to storm king stout, but it has a much more creamy and smooth body. Very well balanced overall. I like the little bite at the end that comes out at the same time as the hops.

The smells of coffee and chocolate hits you right away. The taste is a lively, for sure. Though the taste of alcohol is noticeable, but not detremental. Taste of rich malts that have a heavy accent of chocolate and oats. Mouthfeel is very pleasent for 9% ABV. Appearance is very dark, but with some very deep amber. This is a sipping beer, not for dinner and one to savor (it lingers in very good way). Something to relax with on cold winter nights.

It's got 8.9% ABV, but don't worry, you'll sober up when you see the picture of Rasputin on the label. Man, he is one creepy bastard. Look at Rasputin, and then turn the bottle one way or the other, and I swear, the eyes follow you...Not even John Ashcroft gives me the paranoid willies like this label (begin Tommy Chong-like rant against the government in 3, 2, 1...).","Newglarusguy","Feb 14, 2007"

The outstanding quality of this ale is in its taste. The best comparison I can make is that it is like drinking a loaf of fresh rye bread. The rye really comes through, but with a smooth velvety texture. Any harsh bitterness of rye hops has been balanced away. You really need to sit and enjoy this one slowly. Its smoothness and balance provide a great mouthfeel. I selected a slightly lower grade for drinkability, because it is a heavy ale. Great wintertime drink.","bjoyce12","Feb 12, 2007"

4.64,7.9,4,5,4.5,5,4.5,"The artful blending of flavors makes reviewing it kind of a chore because it is difficult to dissect exactly what you taste, and it is so smooth you just want to gulp it down. In fact if I have one complaint of this brew, it is that for an Imperial Stout it is almost a little too smooth, lacking a certain "oomph" factor on the palate. All this combined with creamy, silky-smooth mouthfeel make this a dangerously drinkable Imp. Stout, and it would be all to easy to end up smashed, knocking these back like nothing.","JudgeRoughneck","Dec 03, 2006"

I'll most likely buy this brew again. It is great to warm up with after coming in out of the cold and being pounded by the elements. Not something that I could sit around and drink all day, and it shouldn't be. I don't think that any RIS is meant to be that way. Definitely something to slowly savor. However, I also know that there are other RIS's that represent the style differently and I would definitely love to try those before I came back to this one, but I would not be adverse to another go-round with this brew.","becktone","Dec 01, 2006"
4,-7,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured out a dark brown with a red hue. Tan head that was large, left lacing. Aroma of chocolate, roast, coffee, malt. Flavors chocolate, smoke, roast, a twinge of metallic, with alcohol warming seem to mule kick you in the senses. Mouth feel is a creamy, frothy, medium/high bodied with a moderate carbonation level. Definitely worth a keg, or case. Nice on a cold winter night like this one.","amatuerbeerguy","Nov 29, 2006"

The head was gorgeous, like every nitro-tapped stout should have and the black color was quite nice. The smell was standard stoutish, but gave off more of a sweet coffee flavor than a bitter coffee flavor and that was rather enticing. The taste really developed the sweetness to bring a very nice balance to the beer. The mouthfeel was better than average, but probably because it was a nitro tap and added to the smoothness. It was drinkable in all respects, and I will keep getting it on occasion, but have a hard time going through a few pints in a sitting.","dbalsock","Nov 29, 2006"

4.6,7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours pitch black with a nice 2, maybe 3, finger brown head and lacing that lasts until the end. When held to the light there are mere hints of ruby at the edges. Smells first of a hint of hops then strongly of sweet chocolately roasted malts. Great taste with lots of flavors. The sweet roasted malts dominate but as with the smell I am able to detect a hint of hop bitterness. I am able to pick out some coffee, bitter dark chocolate, and some dried fruits. A pleasantly bitter dark chocolate flavor lingers in the finish. Despite clocking in at 9% ABV the alcohol is masked quite well. Mouthfeel is great. Good, solid body that is thick without being chewy. This brew is also creamy and somewhat dry, very nice. Drinkability is excellent. This is a great interpretation of the style. Great taste with fairly complex flavors make this a treat.","mnj21655","Nov 26, 2006"

Aroma was very malty roasted nuts, with hints of chocolate, dark fruit and toffee. Maybe I was just hungry, but later in the drink, I swear I could also smell grilled, smoked steak. Taste was more of what was found in the aroma (less the steak), and the 9%alcohol blended in nicely to be a perfect complement to the malty sweetness, as the beer warmed . This all combined to leave a very tasty, pleasant, warming finish. This was all it was touted to be.","kimcgolf","Nov 26, 2006"

Exceptionally creamy and smooth taste with the chocolate again and more roasts, but not with an overpowering, burnt taste like many in this genre. A very nice mouthfeel with just the right touch of carbonation. Incredibly drinkable especially considering the alcohol and the fact that it is a strong, Russian Imperial Stout. Fantastic beer, I'll have to have more.","Neehan","Nov 19, 2006"

Specifically, what really stood out to me as I sipped it after a big steak was a really nice burnt malt flavor followed by a smooth dark chocolate linger. Unlike some in this class, there was really no strong sense of alcohol for its high ABV.

Rich and viscous, it covers the inside of the glass with an unctuous coating. Essences of roasted chicory and hazelnuts soar from the glass. Well-roasted malts and vanillin are in attendance as well, as there are hints of some oak also; a nose reminiscent of Weyerbachers "Prophesy". The taste is creamy, soft and unctuous in the mouth. Profound flavors of roasted carob and coffee offset by slightly bittersweet chocolate round out the package here. Amazingly drinkable for a brew of such concentration and depth, the medium body, light bitterness, and very soft acids make this a brew to engorge one self with.

3.95,-8.1,4,4,4,4.5,3.5,"I looked forward to trying this beer. It poured black with only a small head that went down to mostly a ring around the glass. I held it up to a lamp and could not see any light coming through at all. It had a roasted smell similar to coffee beans. The taste started bitter and then turned to coffee and some bitter, dark chocolate. There is some alcohol in the aftertaste and it lasted a long time. The mouthfeel is the most interesting thing about this beer. It is smooth, oily and thick and coats the inside of your mouth. This is a slow sipper. It went down easier as it warmed up (and maybe as it warmed me up). Overall, this is an intense beer. The bitterness, heaviness and ABV keeps me from having too many. I'd like to try one that has aged to see if it smooths out a bit.","uconnalum2","Aug 26, 2006"

Maybe I'm not ready for a real beer, or the other beers I had earlier in the day maxed out my consumption for the day. I'll start with this next time because it was just beautiful beer. Darkest I've ever seen with a head that filled a hefe glass with just a 12 oz bottle. Suprised that the lacing wasn't that heavy. Very well done on the appearance, but drinkability? Horrid.

Tastes of dark chocolate, coffee, malty sweetness, with a light hop dryness hitting you in the middle, ending off with an alcohol warming and lots of hop bitterness. The coffee/chocolate overtones staying with your palate long after each sip. Mouthfeel was pretty oily and thick, but not sludge like thick as would be expected from the appearance. Very pleasant creaminess and not too much carbonation. I've tried many Imperial Stouts as it is a favorite genre of mine, and Old Rasputin blows many out of the water.

Hints of smoked almonds and a bit of coco. You can definately taste the alcohol in the background. Moutfeel is not bad at all either. I prefer Stone Russian Stout by just a hair because the Russian Stout has just a tiny but more alcohol bite which I prefer. But don't get me wrong I would drink either happily. The drinkability is a tiny bit better with Old Rasputin but some of that might be because it comes in smaller bottles so its a little more cold then having a 22 of Stone sitting there getting warm.","TheBeerWolf","Jul 09, 2006"

The head is a dark khaki tan that laces the glass nicely. The smell is really complex roasted and chocolate malts dominate. The first couple of sips present a bitterness that seems almost overwhelming but this soon mellows out once you become used to it and then you can really taste the chocolate malt flavors. Despite the high alcohol content the alcohol isn't that noticable but the beer does have a nice warming quality.

3.91,-9.1,5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Looks delicious, dark black with a red-brown hue peeking out from the bottom of the glass, with a massive, bubly and creamy head that is comparable to the color of, say, wheat bread, for lack of a better comparative. Smells like an american variation on the grassy english ale aroma--more piney and resinous--but the aroma is rather gentle for an imperial stout. Hmm. More like a straght ahead stout. The taste is malty and focused, with a charred finish that tastes, again, mostly like a standard stout. This may have some time on it, in which case, considering style, this is how it would taste after reaching Russia. The expectedly intense hops have mellowed out I think, comparing it to when I had it fresh on tap months prior. The hops again are american, piney, and slightly floral even. Mouthfeel is medium and well- or possibly over- carbonated. Stout like in feel, not as heavy as anticipated, but not light either. Overall, I am not a fan of the hop profile here. Nor do I love the less than smooth, charred malts that acompany it in the finish. This is a very good beer, but it is not the best of style. Tastes more like an american stout than an imperial stout, but it somehow hides the 8% well. I love the label and russian phrases. North Coast is consistently good, despite brewing beers that don't personally appeal to my palate enough to be my pick as favorites given their style. Drinking this left me dreaming of Storm King, which I find delicious both on tap and in the bottle, while this was absolutely better on tap.","Liquids","Jun 16, 2006"

It pours almost black with a quarter-inch of light brown head that reduces to a collar and doesn't leave much lacing. It smells of big, dark roasted malts, cocoa, chocolate, blackberry, and chocolate-covered cherries. It tastes like coffee, dark, unsweet chocolate, and lots of hops (green, piney, leafy, oily, maybe citric) that contribute a big bitterness.

It's almost like eating mouthfulls of grapefruit and chocolate pieces together and washing them down with coffee. Not exactly my idea of a tasty treat. So, what I have planned, is to rate this aged about 6 months, and then again in a year. So far, tonights session shows that Rasputin does, with time, improve. The 6 month old example poured the same colour as a fresh one, obviously. The smell, however, seemed noticeably sweeter. Lots of stewed fruit and loads of chocolate and caramel. The taste, while improved, still has that hop bitterness that I am trying to age away. Mouthfeel was nice and smooth and drinkability was a bit better than a fresh example.

Mouthfeel is right where it should be for a stout. The only thing really holding this brew back is it's drinkability. With an alcohol content of 9%, I can't see myself drinking more than 2 a night. Overall, one of my favorites. Even at 7 dollars a 4 pack, it's worth it.","irishtimepiece","Apr 19, 2006"

This is offset by a bit of molasses and some tartness. The tartness seems a bit out of place. Mouthfeel is near perfect with light carbonation to welcome the liquid to the tongue.

It ends with a slight coffee bitterness, with a touch of hops. In the mouth it is rich and full bodied, it has the texture of two percent milk and seemingly coats the tongue, which allows the the flavor to linger.

The taste is of moderately sweet roasted (slightly burnt) malts supported by alcohol and some light herbal hops. More chocolate and more coffee than in the nose. The slightly astringent finish combined with the warming alcohol give your cheeks and tongue a bit of a tingle. It has a full body, slick texture and soft, low carbonation.

I enjoy these heavier beers with a bit less. Anyway, flavors are particularly drying and hoppy towards the end with the carbonation and alcohol both making quite a sting.

Spicy pinecone hops mixed with an acidic vinous quality overtake during the middle. Bitter coffee finish, but hops ride it on through to the sour mineral aftertaste. Alcohol warms down the throat. Moderate body, a bit thin for the style, actually, and somewhat slick. Seems as if it could be dry, if the sour finish didn't get in the way. This acidity mellows somewhat at about mid-bottle.

It has a thick chocolate malt taste with a few shots of espresso to boot. After I swallowed I noticed a bit of a sweet dull fruit finish to it, not overly hoppy for sure.

Chocolate, coffee, i detected some hazelnut but that could just be my imagination running wild with how much i love this beer. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy. Full bodied with lost of flavor and it leaves a long lasting malt flavor in your mouth, most prominently on the back of your tongue.

A very good beer to sink your teeth into, real chewy.

A hint of coffee to top off the complex aroma; but not much in the way of hops or roasted notes. The roasted barley becomes very evident in the initial taste, with a slight black patent twang. Unsweetened chocolate and faint spicy hop aftertaste mellow out the strong sweet flavor. Dark fruity alcohol is apperent in the finish, but there is enough residual sweet to hide the fusels and retain a silky mouthfeel.

Aroma is beautiful. I don't usually find aromas that wonderful, but this is quite remarkable. Roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, licorice and alocohol, perhaps a trace of brown sugar. Taste is just as great, with a complex mixture of the same hints from aroma, a potent blast of roasted malts and espresso-like aftertaste, finishes moderately thick, smooth and creamy.

Rasputin had a bit of a gamey taste to it, like uncooked rabbit and veal. It was a pleasure to drink this beer on tap, i like watching the bartender do the double pour. Bartender also told me this beer goes well as a half and half or black and tan mixer.

Rich aroma of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, a touch of bitter hops, and a bit of a vinous character. Palate is deeply complex and somewhat earthy. Truly, it tastes as black as it looks: a huge malty backbone is met towards the finish with a good complement of bittering hops for a touch of balance. Notes of milk chocolate, oak, espresso, and a touch of molasses. Body is rich, velvety, and creamy, with very little of the oiliness that seems to permeate many Russian stouts. The alcohol packs a punch, for sure, but this is most certainly a beer to be savored (preferably with a Five Star chocolate-hazelnut bar). Once you start, you're in for the long haul. Enjoy.","ElGordo","Dec 14, 2005"
4.22,-1.9,4,4.5,4.5,3,4,"Pours out a rich black with ruby hues with a thin tan head that slowly dissipated to a thin layer of bubbles. Aromas are of roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee, toasty malts, slight smoke, and marashino cherries. Taste is of sweet, dark chocolate chased with some strong, black coffee. There is some toasted malt in there as well as cherry candy and dried fruits. Finishes a bit smoky with pleasent astringent bitterness and a bit of a lactic acid twang. I detect a bit of citrus and pine in the hops very faintly, although these hops come out more in the burps. This beer really needs to sit a while before the mouthfeel is anywhere near decent. When its freshly poured and a bit too cool, it's thin and prickly, but just letting it sit a while and come closer to room temp., it becomes a bit fuller and mellows out a bit. Still, it could be better. Really drinkable RIS that has tons of flavor and a decent mouthfeel, once it warms up.","goochpunch","Dec 14, 2005"

I like them meatier and full of roasted flavors. This is an interesting taste. As far as matching what I expect it is not. It is sweeter...almost milky. Very tasty, but lacks a lot of the rich roasted complexities I enjoy. It tastes like hops might overshadow the malts too much. It is a very full bodied beer. Almost a cake like texture to it. Alcohol just lightly warms the stomach and mouth. Excellent mouthfeel. This is a very drinkable beer. I would feel good sharing it with just about anyone.","cracgor","Dec 09, 2005"

The feel is appropriately heavy and quite smooth, even creamy. I will definately be back for more. I had a serious thirst for a RIS this summer and the store I went to only had this in stock. I have now enjoyed the first 3 from the 4pack and I think I'll set the other one down for a while. I'd like to see if the cherry aroma will show in the taste as it ages.","claytri","Dec 08, 2005"

Taste is excellent, a very nice roasted expresso, rich bittersweet chocolate, a roasted malt base, and a finish with a slight taste of alcohol. Very rich and luscious.

The beer is the thick blackness of the empty theatres I had left behind at work: hiding and betraying no secrets, forever comlex. The aroma was thick was and heavy on roasted malts with a little alcohol peaking through. I took a sip, a big sip to be honest, of the syrupy, full bodied brew and allowed it to wash over my tongue. The flavor seemed to attack and hold my senses at bay: strong coffee flavors, with well roasted malts, and a alcohol finish. Old Rasputin and I sat around the family room and finished the evening in style. After finishing the beer, fully enjoyed, I wanted nothing less than another of the same exact beer and scolded myself for not purchasing more than a single bottle of this brew.

Now that I can buy this beer in NC, the anticipation of cracking this one open is exhilerating. The beer pours black, nearly opaque, with a 1 inch light brown head. I can detect a whiff of coffee, dark malt and hops. The initial taste is of chocolate,coffee, plums, dark fruit and hops. As the beer warms, the alcohol taste comes out more, but does not take anything away from the drinkability of this beer. I could easily drink several of these in one night. This beer is just as good as I remember it. Excellent.","rodrot","Sep 28, 2005"

Aroma is pretty nice, some dark espresso roastiness and bitter chocolate, with a slight touch of hops. Taste is fantastic. Very roasty, fairly dry (for an impy). Starts of full of roastiness, espresso and bitter chocolate, some slight fruit midway, then the hops emerge through the finish coupled with a slight alcoholic spicyness. It doesn't suffer from being too sweet like some impy's i've had do. It's very nice. Perhaps that's why the body is a bit thinner than expected, but that's a tradeoff I can make.

4.42,2.8,4,4.5,4.5,5,4,"Pours a nice toffee brown/ black with a bit of seriously brown head. The smell is a bit of a surprise- almost floral in addition to the usual caramel/ roast/ soy stuff. The taste is heavy on the acrid/ roasty/ burnt side with a hint of chocolate and italian roast coffee- flirts with being too much, but never really goes too far. Mouthfeel really stands out in this one- less body than some other impy stouts that lean towards the thick syrupy side- but that's perfect in this beer; nice to have one that doesn't feel immensley sticky. Alcohol's nicely balanced, too. The intense roastiness limits the drinkability somewhat, but I could certainly have at least one more...","amicar","Sep 19, 2005"

Aromas similar to whisky were first noted, as were indications of chocolate and coffee. Flavor was full and rich, with notes of molassas, cocoa and coffee, with some smokey elements to it as well. The big drawback for me with this beer was the alcohol. Way too present, as it almost overpowered the other flavors. Very hard to ignore.

The Mad Monk is a deep and evil black that's basically headless--something the Romanovs probably should have considered. It smells like roasted malts, caramel, and chocolate. Taste is deliciously bitter, like coffee grounds, with some chocolate and toastedness. The kind of big beer I like, lacking in the grossly sweet prune/raisin character that I dislike.

The taste is of roasted nuts, oak, chocolate mocha and the bitterness of hops with whipped cream. The mouthfeel is light and smooth but warms up at the end because of the alcohol.

It is deep, dark and mysterious--perhaps much like the ellusive Rasputin himself. I love the smell of this beer. It mixes roasted coffee aromas, with the sweeter remnants of chocolate, caramel and toffee. Sweetness epitomized! There is also a nice, bold noticeable tinge of hops to the overall inhalation. It tastes like carmalized coffee with malt and a slight hops kick at the end of each swallow. Alcohol is noticeable, but barely. In the mouth, this beer is amazingly bold and full. It holds well, with low carbonation. There is also a nice biting aftertaste, allowing its overall substance to be reckoned with. On the whole this well documented Russian Imperial Stout does not disappoint. Not normally my favorite style, but this one is a keeper. It is a candied/coffied delight for the palate.

Very rich smelling bouquet. Taste follows suit and is quite fruity, in a deep roasted kind of way, with some sweet maltiness, some hop bitterness, and alcohol at the end. You can tell this is 9%, but it's not to the point of being hard to drink by any means. I could easily put back another, but would definitely start to feel it by then.

Not in my face alcohol, it's a gentle stingy alcohol that supports the other scents. Tastes thick dark sweet. Chocolate is strong and over the nice rich roasty. Like a chocolate coffee desert. The potent chocolate is almost like a syrupy chocolate, like you would pour over vanilla ice cream, but it's not a cheap chocolate. It's a really rich chocolate, like you would get from a reputable foreign producer The alcohol plays with it nicely to make a rummy taste that has raisin and plum characteristics. In later sips, as the beer warmed, a strong toffee made itself evident. The creamy thick mouthfeel really adds to the character of this beer. Carbonation is mild, but forms an interesting acrid sting that negotiates with the rich sweet and reinforces the tinge of alcohol burn.","mentor","Jun 21, 2005"

It is just a roasted heavy body, mostly from the alcohol, stout that can't be called creamy, it is very acidic. It lacks the smoothness of a better stout and the fruitness that can hide in the beers is also not present.

It's slightly vinous with some yeasty fruitiness coming through the maltiness, followed by a touch of dark chocolate, espresso, and a waft of hops. It's quite slick, and a touch creamy, across the palate with a full body and a restrained, natural carbonation. The yeasty fruitiness carries through into the flavor with notes of prunes, plums, and berries; all backed by a massive assult of malt that offers espresso, burnt black coffee, dark caramel, and the suggestion of molasses as well as a pinch of brown sugar. It finishes with some resinous hops and a drip of black licorice before fading into a long, very dry finish. Quite nice!","NeroFiddled","Apr 21, 2005"

The aroma kicks off with big sniffs of cocoa and prunes that get pulled by a tarry woodiness into a bitterness of coffee-and-lemon. Here's an American-made Imperial Stout that recognizes that when it comes to hops, modesty can be a virtue. Baking-soda nosefeel is powdery and dry. Over a base of mellowly toasted cedar can be detected light--not burnt--fruit flavors of orange peel and melon rinds dipped in dark chocolate. Black coffee takes over, with black peppercorns rounding out the finish. The tastes distribute widely and fluidly through a dryish, clean, and softly carbonated mouthfeel that carries the bitterness all the way to the back of the throat.

Rich, roasted malt flavors up front meld with some sweetish, overripe dark fuits. Light chocolate coffee notes pick up right before a big rush of bitter hops.

The high alcohol content is not as evident as it was in the nose; I could not even discern the slightest alcohol flavor.

All became bigger yet softened. What was initially a hoppy finish with a high squeal followed by a dry note with a metal element transformed. I found Rasputin to be balanced from nose to finish. The appropriate temp made for a most boastful review. This was a good brew.","yoko","Feb 28, 2005"

I catch hints of the malt from a good 2 ft away. It has espresso, and black cherry notes throughout the aroma. The flavor has a plesant hop bite up front. The malt kicks in immediately after. Coffee, chocolate. I dont catch the black cherry in the flavor. The level of bitterness and the alcohol give this an almost spicy character. Very bright, smooth mouth feel. A little too much alcohol to give it a high drinakbility, None the less a great beer.","carln26","Feb 26, 2005"

Had a frothy dark tan head that was slow to break down leaving a nice amount of lacing through the first half of the brew. The aromas are of dark malts, coffee or espresso, dark fruit, chocolate and a few other things that seem to be hard to pinpoint. The taste is very warming as you do notice a nice slight alcohol flavor that goes perfect with the tastes of chocolate and coffee and has the right amount of hop at the end. This is a very good brew one to be enjoyed during the cold winter. Now with the accolades for this brew here is a little take away, I do feel that I have had better Imperial Stouts in the past but this is right up there!","Stimack","Feb 21, 2005"

The alcohol comes through, but so do the big roasted malts, and the aftertaste is full of chocolaty goodness. There's a hint of citrus rind on the tongue that rounds things out nicely.

It was also just delevered to the beer store that day, not sure how much that goes towards quality control, but at least it was not on a shelf for the past 9 months. The beer poured into the glass a midnight black in color. Light was not even making it around the edges of the beer. A finger-width head formed on top of the beer, then dissipated to ring the glass. Stringy lace would form in small amounts around the glass as well. The aroma is of malts and burnt toffee. Also, just a touch of smoke. The taste is chocolate, old coffee, and malt. Hops come through in the aftertaste. Alcohol is just slightly present in the mouthfeel, but not in such a bad way. The only problem I foresee with drinking this beer is that it is kind of overwhelming and you will lose your taste buds after too long.","MuddyFeet","Jan 26, 2005"

Smell is overwhelmingly 'chocolate' like with a slight coffee aroma. My first impression when sipping it is hops and lots of hops. I prefer my imperial stouts with a strong hop backbone to support the loads of roasted malts otherwise the alcohol presence is overwhelming and they tend to be on the 'sweet side'. In this case there is a great balance and the alcohol isn't as noticeable. Overall is very similar to Storm King Stout by Victory Brewing.

Rich body with a great balance of sweet malt and caramel, along with coffee and sneaky hops that poke through periodically. The alcohol is well-hidden too but you can tell it is there.

This beer to me seems very complex...if you take just a small sip, the sweetness is very evident and somewhat single layered. With a larger sip, more layers seem to expose themselves and the high ABV becomes increasingly evident. In a sense, I would have to say that reviewing this intensely flavored stout could vary greatly by your drinking style.

3.7,-14,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Old Raspy was served from a stubby 12 oz. bottle. In a pint glass, the beer was black (deep ruby edge accents with backlighting), and was topped by a thin but persistant light brown head. The nose yielded deep-roasted-choco-molasses aromas that were accompanied by enticing though subtle notes of sasparilla, vanilla, and toasted sesame oil. Little sign of esters in the nose. The taste consisted of a rich dark-roasted cocoa-chocolate malt profile that was joined by some nice sharp dark cherry and plum notes that helped cut through initial roastiness. A robust smokey cocoa-bitter dark chocolate flavor dominates the subtle fruitiness in the finish, which left some rather flat lingering dark chocolate notes. The flavors are tasty and rich as expected, but I was dissapointed in the lack of complexity and interesting accents. I thought the finish was a bit too "smoky" as well. The body was appropriately smooth and full for the style. Old Rasputin is a full-flavored and robust Russian imperial stout, but for me lacks some of the important details found in many other examples of the style.","HiroProtagonist","Aug 06, 2004"

The tan thick mocha head is amazing, by far the best head I have seen in sometime, the lacing coats the glass, almost feels like it becomes the glass. The smell is amazing, mocha caramel and hints of dark ghiradelli chocolates. Picked up cinnamon and toasted marshmellow characters as well. The taste was very dry and weak, the roasted malts were bland and dry, alcohol was easy to pick up on, the bitterness outweighed the sweetness a little to much. A full bodied stout and very dry. Nice to look at and warming on those chilly days, but a true stout will make you crave it all times of the year, this was not one of them.","beertaster13","Jun 26, 2004"

Aroma is brimming with dark chocolate and coffee flavors with a bit of sweetness in there as well. The flavor is a bit mild with chocolate and coffee being at the forefront and a bit of hop bitterness as well. The alcohol defiantly comes out the more this one warms. This has a full-bodied mouthfeel with light carbonation. Overall a good imperial stout but there are plenty out there that I would prefer.","meathookjones","Jun 14, 2004"

Big tan head that sticks to the sides of my glass in a cobweb pattern. Smells of bittersweet chocolate, espresso, raisins, and a tinge of alcohol. Flavor is just a kick to the teeth. Like drinking an extra strong cup of coffee, with a good amount of alcohol and hops bitterness thrown in for good measure. Very big beer, the best Imperial Stout I have had, tastes more like a stout than Sammy Smith's. I like this one, and would recommend it to any stout fan.","TastyTaste","Jun 13, 2004"
3.51,-18.4,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured into a small goblet with minimal foaming. Opaque in color. Aroma of espresso. Starts with intense coffee and chocolate flavors, then more chocolate, almost burnt chocolate until a long bitter finish laced with alcohol. Mouthfeel and body are almost similar to a fuller bodied wine such as a cabernet. The most memorable character of this beer is its profound bitterness in the finish. I've had this on tap before and I think I enjoyed more off a tap than out of the bottle. It went especially well with some Mississippi Mudcake. On its own, and out of the bottle, it comes across as a bitter strong stout and bit brash. Still, a damn fine stout.","marcobrau","Jun 09, 2004"

The smell is chocolatey spice, but it is also very alcoholic too. Very little hops or malts are evident. The taste is actually very sweet, and it actually tastes like a less tasteful stout with a shot of whisky in it, adding a heavy alcoholic and sweet taste to it. Besides that there are some fruity tones to it, but I really cant get by that initial sweet alcoholicness. The mouthfeel is medium body with plenty of carbonation, which is fine. However, I find this beer tasting way too alcoholic to me.","FranklinPCombs","May 15, 2004"
3.84,-10.7,5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Poured out of a stubby bottle with a picture of the Russian mystic on the label (I am assuming this is Rasputin, as I have never seen other pictures of him). When poured into my trusty goblet, the dark brown body is nearly completely opaque, but displays red highlights at the edges when held up against the light. The head is brown in color, massive in size (at least three inches), and has the consistency to stand up on its own above the rim of the glassware. This is one impressive looking beer indeed. The aroma is a mixture of medicinal alcohol, and powdered cocoa, and is relatively mild. The taste is like roasted cracked grain, bitter coffee, unsweetened dark chocolate, dark skinned dried fruits, and charred wood. Very pronounced hop bitterness and a very dry aftertaste are also present, as is the noticeable warming effect of the significant alcohol content. Mouthfeel is soft and soothing, but a bit thinner than what I anticipated. Very good representation of the style, but a bit less in your face than others like Victory Storm King Stout.","rajendra82","May 03, 2004"

Hop bitterness is strong and crisp. Finish is relatively dry. Soft and full mouthfeel. This is a very drinkable and complex beer. Theres a lot of interactive, well-balanced flavors in this beer. Its a pure treat.","Suds","Apr 25, 2004"

The wife who poured the 1st one commented that she had to hit the bottom of the bottle to get everything out a la catsup. Smells of toasted malts and coffee. The taste complexity is interesting as it starts of smooth but quickly is taken over by the toasted malts finishing with a seemingly higher than usual (for a stout) hop somewhat sweet finish. Nice full mouthfeel. A very enjoyable brew which I plan on enjoying again.","arizcards","Apr 24, 2004"

Sweet malty chocolate roastiness and dark espresso was the combination in the aroma. Taste was similar chocolate, roasted malt, plums and espresso/really dark coffee. Very good stuff had a sweet flavor but not overly sweet, as it warmed it smoothed out and the flavors came out a little more. Easy drinking brew very little carbonation and a medium to full bodied texture. This is all good here.","Running4beer","Apr 12, 2004"
4.27,-0.7,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Almost pitch-black in hue, when I held the glass to the light I could notice hints of ruby around the edges. The beige head reached a lifeless finger in height before swiftly fading to a sparse soapy collar. The subsequent lacing was very minimal and hardly noteworthy. The appearance is average and thus disappointing. The potency of the nose is small, it is too calm for a beer this big and far too quiet for how warm I allowed it to get before I poured it, anyway, the bouquet does have lovely aromas of chocolate, dates, raisins, a slight hint of coffee beans but more so espresso, and a kiss of vinous liquor. I found the detectable aromas to be very pleasant and quite welcoming. I am impressed with the flavors on the palate, upfront is a roasted malt bitterness, coffee beans, espresso, and bark. In the middle these flavors wane and allow a softer, more rounded chocolate covered dark-fruit to surface; the brandy/sherry-like alcohol swallow these flavors. As the finish begins the piney, slightly citrusy hops emerge; the aftertaste is roasted and hoppy. This is a very nice beverage; the mad monk is damn tasty! It does seem a little sugary as it sits on my tongue but this seems to be more of a mouthfeel concern than a taste issue. Medium-full in body, low but natural carbonation, I like the mouthfeel, it is nothing special but full enough for the style. The big alcohol content is scarcely noticeable; it provides more flavor than anything else. This is a very good Imperial Stout, I know this is a broken record, but I wish this was available locally. If it were, Id drink it regularly. As is, I will sip and savor my lonely 12-ounce bottle that I purchased in Loveland. Good stuff.","bditty187","Apr 12, 2004"

Fruity palate with watermelon, pepper. This is a complex beer with a sweet side that I love, but I just can't get myself to appreciate this astringent, chalky and roasty sour hoppiness and very obvious alcohol.

Hints of dark chocolate and toasted nuts. You can smell some of the roasted bitterness for sure, though this is clearly not the hop monster many imperials are these days. Snappy bitterness is present throughout. But overtones of chocolate and vinous flavor swirl around atop the bitterness. The bitterness, of course, re-emerges at the finish supplemented by hops. I think this feels a bit thinner than it actually is for some reason. Quite easy and fun to drink for an imperial.","marburg","Mar 12, 2004"

Topped off with a finger's worth of chocolate milk-like froth that reduces quickly to a thin but persistent and clingy layer of bronzy beige. Despite the ominous darkness, the smell is remarkably complex and pleasant. Roasted notes are lighter than expected and complemented very nicely by the scent of milk chocolate. Some bitterness up front followed by a creamy mouthfeel that succumbs again to the bitterness. A blast of alcohol warmth shows up and fades very slowly. As mentioned above, the mouthfeel is creamy, but it also maintains an astringency rather than the clingy fullness one might expect or desire from a potent stout. Roasted grains and chocolate are there as well, but again are balanced nicely by the assertive hops.

Aroma is all roasted malts and a slight alcholic tang. Notes of licorice and chicory are fleeting but round out the smell nicely. Taste is sublime, especially at cellar temperature. A bitter roastiness makes a quick entrance and sticks to the mouth throughout. There are interesting notes of strong, real maple syrup, horehound and something almost camphoracious. The finish is sweet and smooooth. A lovely hop bitterness with some mineral notes lingers. Mouthfeel is akin to cooled-down hot chocolate. Certainly not refreshing, but one hell of a smooth Imperial stout. A true "meal-in-a-bottle" beer. Drinkability is fantastic one one hand, because of the unique flavors and smooth feel.

The smell is potent and prepares the drinker for the flavor to come. This is definitely a well crafted beer that is full of flavor. However, I marked it down in some areas mainly because of personal tastes. I found it somewhat difficult to drink because of the strong almost burning presence of the alcohol.

There is some fruitiness in there all the while just trying to make things even more interesting. Decent carbonation that gives way to a nice slick mouthfeel, with a quite sticky aftertaste.

Quite thick, though not overly so. Strong malt presence, definite roast malt character as well. This beer is like chewing on a roast malt kernel, it has the same after taste and everything. Even though thick and malty the roast character lets this beer finish like it is quite dry. There is a bit of oiliness in this beer. The beer is very smooth, yet still carbonated.

It has all of the flavor and is smoother. Perhaps the Storm King is a beer better sampled after aging (I have some from last year for comparison), while this is ready to go now. The lighter body and slight sweetness remind me of Perkuno's Hammer. I’d love to try some of the Millennium Edition, as it is described as being very thick.

Aroma: Deep cocoa, espresso infused, undertones of alcohol infused fruit along with a great bready sweet malt tone this is one awesome imperial stout in my opinion it sets the bar. Taste: Wow complex swirling spiral of flavor alcohol infused fruit, doses of hardcore strong coffee notes, and dark chocolate playing the tie the flavors together predominantly bitter from the dark roasts there are some hops evident in the flavor. Creamy balanced mix of so many flavors works so well, gotta love the Ol' Raspy. Mouthfeel: Full bodied syrupy goodness of massive flavors this is one extraordinary beer, a must try. Drinkability: No questions as to it's placement on the top 50 beer list, this one does it so well remaining amazingly drinkable and flavorful is the key for an Imperial stout not cloying in anyway and you yearn for another one the glass is empty that's what it's all about.","WVbeergeek","Oct 19, 2003"

The old picture of the monk himself teases, just teases you to try and dare consume this liquid concoction. The beer pours a very dark black. The only thing blacker than this liquid is my ex girlfriend's heart. When held too the light, this beer shows a shimmer of blood ruby. Only problem in presentation? Next to no head. Just a little film of bubbles, which does last throughout drinking. Scent, oh the scent. The nostrils are kicked in the sinuses with roasted malts, dark chocolate, arabica coffee beans, bitter hops, raisins, plums, prunes, red grapes, and various spices from around the world. One could write an essay on the olfactory pleasure of this beer. Taste is very damn similar too smell, though hops were stronger in the tongue than on the nose. This is actually very hoppy tasting. Like an IPA turned stout. But that roast malt is still their, ever so powering, ever so warm. Coffee and chocolate entwine together in this erotic dance that would leave any man's scrotum with a case of rigomortis. The fruits act as a sweet song, which the coffee and chocolate dance too. Spices are the final touch, the decorations on the ballroom walls. Just beautiful, damn beautiful. The mouthfeel is hard too explain. It's strong, but neither thick nor syrupy. Though this is not flattering to the brew at all, it's like gasoline. Gasoline is like oil, both are fuel, but oil is thick and gasoline is not. I shall definitely be drinking this again, if I can find it again. A beer meant to be enjoyed like an old port or hand crafted cigar. Any more than one at a sitting is simply too much of a good thing.","slitherySOB","Sep 15, 2003"

It left a lace behind that was sheety and lacey in different spots of the inside of the glass. The aromas that came from the glass were fairly complex, changing with each degree of temperature. I nosed coffee, dark and roasted malts, caramel, chocolates, slight fruits, some burnt chocolate, wood ash and alcohol. All smells seemed to couple up with each other and accent each other very well. The tastes were just as complex as the aromas and seemed to get only better as it warmed. I tasted bitter hops, burnt and regular coffees, roasted malts, caramel (slight), chocolates, alcohols, flowers, wood ash and some slight dark fruits. The first sip had some bitter hops to it, then an explosion of flavors all through the middle and then ended the same way it started. This is one complex beer.

Very good head considering the abv, with nice lacing almost to the end. Really nice red/mahogany color when held to the light. Nice complex flavor and aroma that leans toward caramel as much, if not more than, roasted malt. It's the heavy fruitness that moves towards excessive sweetness that I struggle with, but I'm working on appreciating it. Very well hopped leaving a very long dry finish.

Light chocolate and butterscotch, w/ mild roasted barley and nuttiness. Subdued vinous alcohol soaked dark fruit. Not as delectable in aroma compared to other imperials. Sharp roasted barley bitterness hits the palate initially, then is ensued by a wave of milk chocolate sweetness and prune like fruitiness. Mild sherry notes and black licorice emerge mid palate then are rendered abrupt by assertive hop bitterness. Hop flavor, although overshadowed by the malt profile, combines w/ the fruitiness to leave a pleasant citrus rind undertone. Fairly light in body for an imperial, but the dextrinous mouthfeel does not reflect that. Finishes w/ a slightly smoky, lingering bittersweet chocolate flavor. Old Rasputin is delicious, but falls a bit short aromawise. The rich malt character isn't represented in aroma.

I savored each sip of each beer, spending almost an hour with each. The alcohol is noticable, but not overpowering.  But I wouldn't choose Old Rasputin for a night of drinking.

There's a thin burnt bitterness and citrus peel flavor (although sharper like lemon or grapefruit than fuller orange peel flavor).

4.25,-1.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a black color, with a cardboard colored head. There is raisin, malt and alcohol aromas on the nose. All of the same on the palateheavy alcohol through out, raisins, bit of chocolate, and rum maybe. Very nice mouth feelOverall a very good imperial, balanced well.","WilliamPhilaPa","May 16, 2002"
4.85,12.8,5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"(12oz. bottle) Awesome black opaque liquid. Rocky tan head. A truly remarkable appearance.  A thin creamy layer of foam lasts, leaving residual lace. Huge aroma of chocolate, burnt molasses, ripe prunes and alcohol.  Perfect balance of bitterness and sweetness...doesn't possess that sticky sort of sweetness. Just of multitude of flavors happening here; chocolate malt, prunes/raisins, coffee with a welcome alcohol warming sensation in the belly. A delicious, outstanding treat.","John","Apr 15, 2002"
4.6,7,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"This beer grew on me. Pours deep dark black with maybe a hint of purple shade ? Nice big tan foamy head, faded into a thin head but fell down the glass nicely. Smells of roasted malt, toffee, coffee. Big roasted coffee taste, strong bitter finish that stays on your tongue.The taste expanded as the beer warmed, don't let the first sip, get you down.  The alcohol makes it taste thinner than other stouts. Cool bottle and label. I bought this based on other beer advocates reviews. It is very good.","StevieW","Apr 11, 2002"
4.92,14.4,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Pours jet black.  Medium brown head that dissipates quickly.  Beautiful roasty aroma.  Also get a bit of smoke on the nose.  There's some burnt malt tastes.  Very strong bitterness.  I love that in an Imperial.  The IBU must be approaching 100 in this brew.  Incredible malt load balances nicely with the hops.  A bit of alcohol dangles on the tongue nicely.  This is everything I look for in an Imperial Stout.  Not as viscous as Bell's Expedition, but tremendous in its own right.  One of my all time favorites.  This is in the elite category of microbrewed Imperials that I have tried (along with Bell's Expedition and Rogue).","Bighuge","Mar 22, 2002"
4.41,2.6,4.5,3.5,4.5,5,5,"Man, I really love Imperial Stouts and this is a real good one.  It is real dark with only the slightest hint of light getting through but kind of a thinish head.  For some reason I couldn't get a whole lot of aroma.  What I do get is dark chocolate and roasted malts with a slight hop undertone.  A different taste for an imperial stout but not one that I am necessarily against.  Huge amounts or dark chocolate and roasted malts start on the tongue.  This is then followed a nice cascade hop flavor.  The bitterness of the hops is nicely balanced with the sweetness of the chocolate and a faint dark fruit presence.  I can't find even the slightest hint of alcohol.  The mouthfeel is creamy and a bit tangy which leaves me wanting more of it.  I would have to say that the hops balance to the huge body of this beer makes it exceptionally drinkable.  This is one kick ass beer.  One of these days I am going to have to make a pilgrimage to California to see all these amazing breweries in person.","Murph","Mar 13, 2002"

4.8,11.6,5,5,4.5,5,5,"This is a top-notch beer in my book, and damn near perfect. A very close second to Victory's Storm King, which is perfect.","mophie","Feb 09, 2002"
5,16.3,5,5,5,5,5,"Pitch black, thick dark tan head.  Extremely rich roasted malt and alchohal aromatics.  Thick roasted malts, burnt chocolate, coffee flavors penetrate deeply on the palate.  Creamy and rich mouthfeel.  Complex and complete.  Probably should give a 2 or 3 for drinkability because it's so strong, but like Stone's Arrogant Bastard, I refuse.  This beer is one of a kind.","Jordan","Jan 15, 2002"
4.74,10.2,4,5,5,5,4,"Said a prayer to St. Stephen to ward off Rasputin.  Spicy malt/hop aroma, wonderful roasted malt flavor, sweet malt aftertaste with alcohol on the finish.  Worth $2.50 a bottle and I'm a cheapskate.","John1985","Dec 26, 2001"
4.4,2.3,4,4,5,4,4,"This was a very pleasant surprise.  My wife (who can't drink beer) picked this up for me while out shopping.  The first few drinks seemed somewhat bitter and strongly alcoholic.  However, I stuck with it and really grew to like it.  A bit of sweetness came through after a few sips.  If it doesn't speak to you at first, give it a few minutes.","mickeymac","Dec 09, 2001"

4.9,14,5,5,5,4,5,"Now this is a stout.  Black as night with a firm brown head.  Flavors abound -- rum, raisins and a strong hit of alcohol.  A perfect nightcap in a brandy snifter.","BKotch","Nov 09, 2001"
4.84,12.6,4,5,5,4,5,"One hell of a good beer.  This is a top of the line imperial stout - it has plenty of kick and a deep full flavor.","mmthompson33","Nov 08, 2001"
4.84,12.6,4,5,5,4,5,"I had this on tap at their brewpub.  Alcohol was just the first thing you notice.  I could sit back all night and drink this, of course then I would never get up","AaronRed","Oct 03, 2001"
4.9,14,5,5,5,4,5,"For a Russian imperial, this stout was actually a little more mild than I expected.  Lots of chocolate, and a hint of vanilla in the finsih.  Tremendous depth of flavor.  The mouthfeel was surprisingly light for the heft of the beer.","Brent","Sep 30, 2001"
5,16.3,5,5,5,5,5,"This is a wonderful beer, the mouth is flooded with so much flavor that you almost trip off line.  This is great on a winters night by a soft fire, some fine chocolate and the one you love.  One special brew, a true masterpiece.","gwfrankpsu","Sep 28, 2001"

4.53,5.3,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Very complex, and true to its style. Well worth the $3.00 (+/-) paid for the single bottle, and I'd definitely buy it again. Not a beer for the faint of heart, but rather barley wine lovers and chocolate fanatics.","Todd","Jan 18, 2001"
