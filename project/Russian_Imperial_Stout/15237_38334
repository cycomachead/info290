4.46,4.9,5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Pours out a ruby black body with a humongous, rocky mocha head that recedes to a bubbly thin cap like a freshly served espresso. Smells strongly of chocolate and lightly of roasted malts. I get a lot of Belgian quad-like yeast qualities, bringing forth dried fruits, plums, and leather. Flavor is of raisins, chocolate, earthy bitterness, coffee/chocolate ice cream, light acidity in the finish. Alcohol is noted, but very well hidden. Bitterness is not as pronounced as the 100+ IBUs insinuate. Mouthfeel is creamy, full, and rich. One of the greats. I wish more US breweries made bigger stouts of this caliber and finesse.","goochpunch","Mar 26, 2014"

Dark fruit, cacao, and black coffee pretty early on, but not too bitter A hint of alc., but super well hidden consisdering. Can't really put my finger on everything else I'm getting; I just keep thinking berries and fruit or something. Hint of bitterness shows up on the end, and a very slight ashy roasted aftertaste pop in for a second, but disappears quickly. Awesome beer.","Mikeluzzjr","Mar 24, 2014"

4.09,-3.8,4.25,4,4,4.75,4,"This is a great example of a Russian Imperial Stout. It's appropriately thick and creamy, with a strong presence of malts and hops. The alcohol never becomes hot, and it drinks well for its strength. Well designed in my opinion. The Belgian take on this style is great, and a wonderful departure from the usual stuff from America. I like the Belgian yeast and what it does here.","MusicaleMike","Mar 18, 2014"

Pours dense and murky pitch black color with a 2 finger dense dark brown head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, light char, toast, raisin, prune, dark bread, molasses, herbal, light pepper, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, char, toast, dark bread, raisin, prune, molasses, herbal, light pepper, and roasted earthiness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, light char, toast, dark bread, molasses, raisin, prune, herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of big dark/roasted malt and moderate yeast ester flavors; with big flavor robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian imperial stout. All around great complexity and balance of big dark/roasted malt and moderate yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 20, 2014"

Very sweet aroma, molasses and vanilla, some malts, and you can smell a hint of the booze. A little less smell than you'd expect. Strong roasted flavor with lots of cocoa, but surprisingly not super sweet. Some fruits and cloves too. Flavor starts relatively benign and explodes at the end. The roasted malts really linger and rise up into your nose. Very rich, and not super boozy but you get some nice warmth. Thick, rich and creamy, a touch sticky. Overall a great example of a RIS and one of the best overall I've had. Highly recommended.","Samuel906","Apr 10, 2013"

Again a ton of dark fruit, black cherries joined by chewy prunes and raisins. Robust roasted malt joins in; finishes with slightly bitter dark chocolate and plenty of warming alcohol.

Smells like a big RIS, heavy boozy malts with notes of molasses. bourbon vanilla. Initial taste is big smoky, heavily roasted malt with an alcohol kick. As it warms I get a hint of that estery Belgian yeast but it is dominated by the wealth of malts. Dark fruity character as it warms, lower in bitterness than most. A rich heavy body but not sticky or oily. Low carbonation. This high alcohol content volatilizes the beer through your nose very noticeably. This is a big fucking beer. A beer to sip and contemplate.

Huge aromas of dried fruit of the prune and currant type with lots of velvety smooth cream, chocolate, and espresso. A touch of biscuit starts off the palate and quickly becomes the aforementioned fruit and finishes with the burnt toast and espresso. Huge and rich body with subtle carbonation. When compared with Kabert, I think this beer is more expressive for sure. A lot more of the dark fruit flavor here than I expected and certainly more fruit flavor than Kabert, which was also a surprise. Delicious.","DmanGTR","Jan 27, 2013"

The flavors are very rich and very well balanced. It features a nice, nearly perfect amount of roast without resembling coffee at all. It has a great chocolate aspect that merges the flavors of both dark and milk chocolates. While not the most inquest descriptors this beer nails them. You can tell that this beer is big but don't get any of the 13% alcohol that this beer boasts. It's really pretty remarkable, especially this bottle is fresh. I can see this one aging gracefully.

Split between myself and the wife, I poured my half into an Ebenezer's snifter, and her half into a Pinocchio's tulip glass. The beer poured out a thick, oily black, with a pinky finger of chocolatey brown head that receded to a mere ringlet, leaving a few trails of lacing behind. Smell was booze-heavy, with notes of cocoa and dark fruits. Taste improved as the temperature rose, with a blend of dark roasted malts, molasses, rum-soaked dark fruits, charcoal, and hints of dark chocolate. Pretty complex, but still a bit more thin than I'd expect overall, so I felt the full range of flavors didn't completely come out like it should have. Medium body, and pretty drinkable, but not as good as say, a DFH World Wide Stout...not that many things are.","Rifugium","Nov 20, 2011"

Taste was a little sweeter than i like for a RIS, but in no way unpleasant. The mouthfeel was the weirdest part of this beer. I hold all RIS to CCB Zhukov standards, black albert was just very thin feeling, almost felt more like a brown ale. Just didn't blow me away this one.

Taste is pretty complex, chocolate, a wee bit of chocolate, burnt sugar/caramelish sweetness, if anything the hops are fairly floral at this point. The resiny hops became noticeable once the beer got close to room temperature. Mouthfeel is well on the full side of medium, like chomping down on a good brownie, slick, pretty sticky finish. Wow.

There was a pretty good lacing along the glass and some oily brown tinge on there too. The smell of the beer is heavily roasted and had a pretty strong booze aroma too. The taste of the beer is rich with dark chocolate and roasted malts. The other flavors are a little sweetness that fades into a burnt bitterness in the end.

Dark roasted malts, cocoa powder, and dark fruits coming through on the finish. There is a slight soy sauce flavor that comes out as the beer warms. Very mild roast/cocoa bitterness on the palate quickly fades after each sip. Good level of carbonation with a silky and smooth mouthfeel.

Smells sweet with a little bit of coffee, but not much roast. The taste is very sweet with a lot of licorice and molasses. The alcohol is pretty strong as well. Not much else. The sweetness tends to dominate everything. Light bitterness on the finish. Medium body. It does manage to not be syrupy for how sweet it is. Low carbonation.

Such profound alcohol and coffee flavors, blended nicely with chocolate, dark fruits, and vanilla. The mouthfeel is where this beer shines the most...oh so creamy and full-bodied. Just magnificent.

Just like a good Belgian ale, the retention was superior and lacing was great. Smells like dried plums and raisins with molasses and vanilla. Burnt caramel, bitter chocolate, and earthy aromas round out the nose. The taste is largely the sweet sugary fruits at first, followed by the acidic cocoa and coffee flavors expected in a stout like this. Interesting characteristics from the Belgian yeast strain used, somewhat spicy. Very clean and balanced flavor profile, but rich and complex with bold flavors. Feel is about as thick and heavy as I'd expect in a RIS, but carbonated like a dubbel or tripel, which lightened the body a bit.

Poured into a tulip glass a dark brown/black color with a very large, fluffy tan head that is rather slow to dwindle down. As the head settles out enough for me to stick my nose in it, I get whiffs of dark fruit, dark bitter chocolate, and in the end some notes of booze. The head finally dies down, leaving an abundance of sticky lace on the glass. The one concern I have with this is that both in the nose and the taste there is an almost mild sour apple smell and taste, but really no other indication of infection so I think this is how it is suppose to be (?). The flavors are really blended quite well though and this is pretty smooth for a 13% beer. Starts of with dark fruit and slightly sour apple flavor that smoothly transition to a mild roasty flavor. Ends with some lingering bitterness. Overall, this is rather enjoyable even with the strange apple smell/taste. Medium mouthfeel.","kbutler1","Feb 04, 2011"

4,-5.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured from 330ml bottle (batch #14) into tulip glass. The enormous light brown head makes this beer hard to pour. Underneath this mattress, a fully sedimented almost black liquid. Its aroma strikes as immediately vinous, fruity and sugary with its molasses, fig, licorace, anise, vanilla and sharp alcohol tones. So, fruity and vinous. While there's a fair dose of hops, they mostly serve a balancing purpose, never really becoming major in the global character. Instead, its dark malts impart a powdery chocolate feel that reminds of mocha and the malts are sweet to boot. Its vinous side includes a fair bit of acidity, but the roastiness remains restrained enough for any clash to be encountered. Beautiful lacing. A complex, very sweet, medium-full bodied, heady offering that is a sipper indeed, but to me not quite a top offering even among Struise's product line.","CuriousMonk","Jan 31, 2011"

Gorgeous three finger coffee colored head and excellent lacing. Earthy, roasty malt and booze dominate the nose. I'm also getting some coffee, chocolate and a hint of dark fruit. The taste is much the same. The roasted malt and alcohol are dominant again, with lots of cocoa and dark fruit. The hops are overpowered by the sweetness of the malt, which hurts the balance for me and imparts too little bitterness. The mouthfeel is decent, but leans towards being a little syrupy. The sweetness hurts the drinkability for me. That coupled with the booziness makes this just an average beer.

It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. Was it infected or not? Maybe a little bit, but to be honest it didn't really kill any of the flavors in the brew and also helped to cut down on the booziness quite nicely.

The mouthfeel mis a bit dusty, and then opens up and becomes more vinous. Smooth and slightly viscous. I enjoyed this, but probably not quite as much as the hype machine would have me do so.","Georgiabeer","Sep 08, 2010"

The nose was quite nice consisting of chocolate malts, roastiness, lacto notes, dark fruits, slight spice, and underlying coffe notes as well. Upfront the chocolate and lacto characteristics jump out first alongside roastiness, dark fruits, slight coffee, and spice accents, the brew was full bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation which had a sweet, roasty, and creamy finish. It drank really good considering the ABV but its not one of the beast RIS that I've had either. Overall it a good beer and worth trying for sure.","Gobzilla","Sep 06, 2010"

As the head slowly fades, strong high percentage cacao dark chocolate notes come out. There is a slight metallic, noble hope tinge in there too. It's all very soft and mellow though. The flavor is much more powerful than the aroma but still with all the complexity. The dominant flavor is strong, spicy, bitter dark chocolate. Lots of espresso also blends with caramelized sugars, raisin, dates, and molasses. Generous hop bittering and some notable alcohol finish it off. The body id full and oily with lots of tingly carbonation and alcohol warming.","punkrkr27","Sep 06, 2010"

Flavor is an interesting mish-mash, more roasted malt than in the nose, of course that smooth Belgian yeast, and some bittering influences rising up in the finish. Bitter coffee perhaps even some hop oils rising up there. Pretty nice, kind of zesty and bright, but the flavors aren't focused as they could be, so while tasty, it's kind of unfocused.","JAXSON","Sep 06, 2010"

It must have a ton of malt to cover its 100 IBU, not bitter at all. It has a pleasant lingering chocolate loaded finish. A full bodied beer that is dangerously smooth, given its 13% ABV.

Once this has faded, a nice halo lingers at the surface. The nose comprises raisins, figs, molasses, chocolate syrup, sugar cane, and chocolate-covered strawberries. Pretty nice so far. The taste holds a stark combination of bitterness and fruitiness up front and dark sugar, coffee, and bitter chocolate in back. I've gotta say, the whole taste experience here did not go well. The bitterness and fruit up front knocked what could have been a very dark and tasty stout down a peg. It seems as though a stout was blended with a BSDA, resulting in a genetically inferior bastard child. It wasn't entirely objectionable, but not great, either. The body is a heavy medium, with an active carbonation and a surprisingly dry finish. Overall, the odd flavor combination and bubbly nature hold down what could have been something special. A bit of a let-down here.","TMoney2591","Jun 23, 2010"

The nose is of dark chocolate, dark fruits, and a definitely perceptible alcohol hotness that has me a little bit concerned. The first sip catches me off guard, as Black Albert leads off with a shotgun blast of hop bitterness, with some appreciable citrus notes at the end. This is followed by the dark chocolate and fruits from the nose, but thankfully no alcohol, and the result is a very tasty beer. The mouthfeel could be said to be a little thin, but it's not a big issue, but the beer is definitely too carbonated for the style. Lackluster mouthfeel aside, this beer drinks nowhere near 13%. It's quite remarkable that each sip brings no alcohol flavors whatsoever (which makes me noticing some in the nose even more odd).

This stout smells of dark fruits, vanilla, chocolate, sugar, alcohol and roasted grains with the dark fruit smell blending with the chocolate smell to give this ale a desert like sweet smell. The off putting smell is a bit of oxidation and metallic flavor that seems out of place with the rest of the aromas. The taste is much of the same with tastes of dried fruits and chocolate roasted grains dominating out front. The bittersweet chocolate is a little much and and takes away from the drinkability the mouthfeel is medium and what I would expect from a Belgian Stout. Black Albert is a very good stout and the 13% ABV is hidden very nicely in the flavor. Side by side I perfer the Cuvee Delphine a little more because the Cuvee is a much more interesting ale.

The first scent is the strong fragrance of alcohol hits the nose that is followed by a rich chocolaty fragrance. There is the light spicy scent of Belgian yeast and fruity esters. The taste of dark bread, malt, and chocolate come out at the front. Then a dried fruit flavor comes out, mostly of raisons. That is followed by the yeast spiciness and finishing with a mild grassy bitterness. The texture is thinner at the front than one would expect, the expectation was one of a more syrupy feel. It gains weight as it crosses the palate to have a heavier feel. A unique take on a style with a Belgian twist, the color and aroma are strong and inviting. Each taste brings robust and complex flavors, the only let down would be the mouthfeel. The feel was thinner than I expected, it but takes nothing from this beer. This I must try beer, not because of its limited availability, but its unique and fantastic characteristics.","cameraman","Dec 20, 2009"

I suppose that there are a shitload of hop present also, considering it's rated at 100 IBU's. The black malts and alcohol warmth go a long way in hiding it well. The taste is sublime! It's incredibly smooth with a fantastic malt character; warm and toasty. The black and chocolate malts work in harmony to create a true masterpiece. The hops are more obvious in the taste. It's quite a bitter brew which only adds to it's complexity. Lastly is the yeast character. What a tremendous finish. Warmth, malts, hops, and a killer yeast character to boot. The mouthfeel is fine.

There is a subtle coffee undertone which has a mellow undertone followed by an strong alcohol finish. The strength of this beer is nowhere near present as you drink it. The mellow flavor of the beer masks the very high ABV and this could make the beer very dangerous if you were to drink more than one or two.

Carbonation makes the mouthfeel a bit foamy, but not nearly as bad as some other Belgian Stouts, which frankly I have not cared for. This one thankfully, is much better.

The smell was like molter chocolate and very intoxicating. The taste was like dried berries soaked in coffee. There was a up front hint of sourness which gave way to roasted grain astringency. The beer felt simple at first, but after realizing the amount of alcohol hidden under there, I became of the opinion that the seeming simplicity was actually due to the extremely elegant balance that felt so natural.

Almost like a beer float, hints of vanilla, anise. Some dark fruit to it,some quad-like notes buried in there. Not a lot of huge roastyness or zomghops, but damn tasty for a big Belgianized stout. Tastes like velvet on my palate. I can see why this is a bit expensive, one of the most easydrinking big beers I've had, and there is no trace of the 13% ABV. Fantastic.","damienblack","Aug 06, 2009"

Huge alcohol, almost indiscernible at every angle, balance with the subtleties of flavor and complexity that seem almost unparalleled to me in most other beers. This is definitely worth the $10-ish price tag, especially if you're looking for something worth that price, because more and more often I'm finding I'm not displeased as much as maybe very slightly disappointed with the price to quality ratio these days.

The aroma is roasted malt, and graham cracker. For a beer that clams to be 13% ABV this is a very weak aroma. I would actually expect more aroma from a 5% ABV oatmeal stout. The taste is more of the same, but with a harsh alcohol presence. A hint of alcohol is something I would except from a beer with so much alcohol in it, but here it seems to be a major part of the flavor instead of something in the background. Again, this taste is weak. The mouthfeel is full bodied with appropriately low carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a huge disappointment. This beer is simply poorly crafted. Good beers with high alcohol content have the high alcohol content so they can have stronger aromas, and stronger tastes. This beer seems to be strong in alcohol simply to be strong in alcohol. I can't see myself ever being in the mood where I what to drink something strong and flavorless.

There is a tan head that settled to a thin coating that lasted until all the beer was gone. It has a roasted malt smell that I rather enjoyed. The first thing that I noticed about the taste was a chocolaty sweetness, followed by roasted malts (of course, this could be more from the aroma than the taste) and a bit of caramel. The beer is 13% alcohol and you can taste it and feel it's warmth, but it isn't overpowering or distracting; in fact, it's quite nice. The beer has a heavy body, but is very drinkable. You don't want to consume this one too quickly, even though it is tempting. This exceptional beer should be enjoyed slowly.

Overall this had an interesting smell and flavor. It tasted very clean and masked the alcohol disturbingly well. It had good body too, but not as full as desired. The prune/grape character really threw me off and kept me from loving this, and there wasn't much depth or complexity beyond that.

The aroma was mainly a sweet chocolate and dark fruits. The thickness of the brew was actually decernable from the aroma. The taste was a very thick stout that was a welcome surprise. Again I expected something totally different and was pleasantly surprised. The taste came threw with allot of chocolate and dark fruits in the background.

It's not the best beer I've had, certainly in that ballpark though, but I am just amazed that this beer even exists, because it seems to contradict style while transcending it altogether. At a glance, this is just a real handsome stout. Robust blackness and a healthy brown head of foam. But the norms end there... The aromas coming from this beer are pretty out of this world, roasty, ripe, delicious. And something reminiscent of a can of paint. Some common stouty flavors of licorice, dark roasted chocolate malt, and coffee, combine with a ripe tangy pungency of the Belgian yeast. It sounds like almost too many flavors, too complex, but it all blends together in quite a sophisticated way. It is amazing how light on the palate this beer is considering the intense flavor achieved. If I did not know it to be true, you would have a damned hard time convincing me that this beer is even close to 13% ABV. Every sip I am saying in my head, "how did they do that?" ...

Creamy, rich/dense dark mocha head, unrelenting retention and plenty of sheeting/lace. The nose is intensly and impresivly of dark chocolate, and double expesso.

4.43,4.2,4.5,4,5,4,4,"The beer yielded a beautiful, frothy two-finger head with an amber/butterscotch hue; the lacing held for a while and made the sides of the glass appeared frosted and shimmery. True to its name, Black Albert remains black in appearance even when held to light, making for an appealing contrast to the colorful head. The smell was sweet with a smoky aroma and scents roasted malt and coffee that manifest also in the flavor. Tasting was a delight; not only was the mouth feel thick and velvety, but all flavors seemed to compliment each other very well. The balance was superb, and at 13% ABV the alcohol is relatively hidden amongst the other flavors. One can tell immediately that this is a big beer, but "booziness" does not permeate (not to say that this isn't sometimes enjoyable in other heavy beers) the other flavors. I could drink a lot of these; they're delicious! However, at ~nine bucks per 12oz. bottle, this beer is a bit out of my sessionable price range. I would buy again for a special occasion, hands down.

The lacing was pretty good, nothing spectacular, but consistent and thorough. The aroma was of roasted malt, wood, nuts, light alcohol (similar to dark rum), and some malty sweetness. The flavors were complex and rich, hiding the 13% surprisingly well. I tasted lots of roasted and toasted malt with some hints of smoke (almost like smoked meat in its depth) along with some spiciness (black pepper in particular), wood, black walnuts, molasses, coffee and espresso, baking cocoa, tobacco and hints of yeast. Complex and concentrated. As it warmed up the dry, malty finish became more clear, and rather clean. An impressive and challenging offering, and deceptive in its finesse. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium/full but not too heavy actually and the carbonation spot-on. I admit it, I'm impressed.","thekevlarkid","Mar 23, 2009"

Aroma is a lovely mixture between Belgian yeast, dark fruits, chocolate, dark honey, light coffee, rum, booze, and molasses. The chocolate aroma from this beer is amazingly good smelling. Alcohol really comes out as it warms. Taste is very interesting, and not quite what a normal RIS tastes like, as this is a "Belgian Royal Stout." Chocolate covered roasted beans makes up a bulk of the flavor profile, followed by a light cocoa sweetness, a bit of sourness and funky yeast, and dry baker's chocolate on the finish. Alcohol is definitely noticeable, but it's pretty well integrated as a whole for being 13%. I think this brew can benefit from a few years of aging to really round out the flavors. Mouthfeel is thick, creamy , viscous, chewy, all the good things I look for in a big stout. This is a very interesting beer. I like the mix of roasted barley and Belgian yeast. It's a combo that works for me, and I enjoyed sipping on this brew over the course of an hour. Good stuff. I'll definitely being buying a few more to cellar.","KeefD","Mar 18, 2009"

The only real problems I have with it are the slightly high carbonation and the sour flavor that's been incorporated. Less carbonation and sourness would improve it a good bit. As it stands, they don't have an overly substantial negative effect, but they do enough to prevent it from reaching its potential. Just my opinion.

Aromas of rich, dark fruit and roasted malts are very noticeable with every sniff. There's no hiding what this is about! Sweet, roasted malts approach the taste buds first, followed by notes of espresso, dark chocolate and dark fruits. Big, full flavor with a little more sweetness than usual for this style. It's not as boozy as I expected; the alcohol is a bit subdued, although at 13% I suspect one should take it easy! I sipped on this for nearly an hour while reading. The mouthfeel is a tad lighter than most RIS's., which accounts for the higher-than-usual drinkability. Enjoy one of these when you can afford it.

The head is a light tan colour, and substantial, leaving a thick wallpaper of lace as it slowly recedes. It smells of fermenting black fruit - prunes, cherries, raisins - molasses, and alcohol warming. The taste is bitter, even sour at first, burnt malt, giving off essences of coffee, chocolate, and port wine. No hops are really evident, the sourness kind of masks that part of my tongue. The carbonation is quite mild, and the sour fruit mellows significantly as it warms, and the finish is actually quite clean, a little boozy malt lingering. The alcohol is very well managed, no direct heat, just that nice stewed fruitiness effect.

3.96,-6.8,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Bought at Bruisin' Ales for $10. I let the bottle warm up a bit before opening it. The aroma isn't that great. It's actually fairly mild for an impy stout. I get a little roastiness, but a fruity character takes the lead. I've smelled that same thing in some Belgian quads. The taste is a mix of sweetness and roastiness. To me, it tastes like what I would imagine a mixture of something like Expedition stout and Gouden Carolus Carolus D'Or (CuvÃ©e Van De Keizer) or heck...how about Expedition and Pannepot would taste. The 13% alcohol content is well hidden. It has a Belgian character, but a mild one, and not something which is sour, funky, brett-ish, etc. Again, the mild, Belgian-style, sweetish, fruitiness is the main character I'm getting in this brew. It's sort of a dark, stewed fruit character. If I had been blindfolded and had been given this beer, I doubt I would have guessed it was an imperial stout. Whatever the case, it's a nice, drinkable, dark-Belgian brew. Is it worth $10 to me? No, but it was fun to try once.","ohmybock","Feb 04, 2009"

It is a very malty beer with smoky chocolate and caramel flavors running roughshod all over the place. This beer might be able to garner a perfect flavor score with a bit of age on it. I envy anyone with vintage bottles. To be fair, I have no idea if Black Albert iis old or new, so that could be impossible. The feel is slightly sticky but very good.

Then there's a hint of the black malt and chocolate sweetness. The tastes are all sort of muddled, maybe from the yeast. I kind of wish it were more bold and assertive -not harsh - but I think the yeast made it hard to really distinguisg flavors. But I enjoyed it, if not for the rarity. For the style and the ABV, this one was surprisingly drinkable. Maybe I only wanted more because I only got half of a 11.2 oz bottle.

The smell on the other hand was dull and acrid, not overly phenolic, more like like flat pepsi. Flip Flop again. Taste is full of flavors that easily come to life. "Caramel Sundae Syrup" at the tip and back of my tongue intertwined with sour cherries and raisins. Aftertaste is much like a Flanders Red. Black Albert does noy give his ABV away in the mouth.

Alternating notes of mellow rubbing alcohol, chocolate, figs, and prunes. Bitterness was in the background, giving way to significant malt sweetness and alcohol. Roastiness stayed soft and had a cherry edge to it, while malt alternated between milk and dark chocolate. Higher alcohols added depth without contributing heat and dried fruits tied the sweetness together. Dry cocoa appeared towards the end, along with some toffee, particularly as it warmed.

4.31,1.4,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"330 ml bottle with a big thanks to presario. Best by April 2013. Pours out a dark black color with a large, creamy light brown head and lots of sticky lacing. A nice aroma of rich roasted malts, sweet chocolates and milk coffee, sweeter sugars and the all powerful Belgian yeast. The aroma suggests a Belgian Strong Ale, but mixed with darker roasted notes. The taste is very nice; initially full of roasted, almost sour flavors, some sweet burnt toffee and caramel. Roasted coffee beans contribute to this near-sourness. Later, this beer gets much sweeter; sweet milky flavors, bittersweet chocolates, cocoa, a very nice, though not huge dark fruitiness. Very drinkable and a silky smooth body. The yeast really stands out, and for me, this really shows the core of a good Belgian beer, and how flexible it can be. A hybrid for sure, and an excellent on at that. Great.","Douglas88","Nov 26, 2008"

There's also a couple other things in the aroma I can't recognize. Very nice. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like roasted malt, yeast, candy sugar, brandy, rum, licorice and chocolate.

First, I don't even know if this should be in the same class with other Imperial Stouts; it has its own distinctive style. The appearance of this brew has to be one of the darkest stouts I have ever seen. The head was so thick and velvety brown head that it looked like a shot of espresso...superb! It had a magnificent scent of sweet chocolate, dark roasted coffee beans and molasses along with roasted malt. The taste is just out of this world. Started off with a blitz of dark chocolate, espresso, and roasted malts; followed by light vanilla hoppy presence and fruit flavors with a touch of bitterness. The mouthfeel wasn't too thick along with soft carbonation keeping the brew from tasting too syrupy. The complexity of this brew is such that 13% ABV is totally absent until the glass is almost empty and then you begin to say Wow, this is one hell of a beer! For me this was like drinking a fine Port that I could have sipped all night. I can't say enough about the brews that are being produced at the Struise camp, but I do know that the rating of number one brewer in the world is without doubt; justified! This brew has taken Stouts to a whole new level!!!","ygtbsm94","Sep 18, 2008"

Nose is actually on the softer side with some black anise, burnt molases and zesty carmalized malt, very unique even for a stout. Layers of dark cherries, molases, bitter chocolate, black licorice and burnt malt really paint the mouth. Some dark soured fruit comes through on the back of the palate. This is a very deeply complex beer. Mouthfeel is amazingly smooth and creamy and the more you drink the more you love and get out of it. I could drink this beer all night but at some point I would be thankful it is only 330ml. Delecious.

Decent wall of stick left on the sides of the glass, nice looking brew for sure. Damn this is a strong smelling beer. Lots of dark fruits; fig, cherries, blueberries, dates, raisins, and blackberries just to name a few. Along with the dark fruits is a huge boozy aroma, almost medicinal. Underneath all that is a bit of dark chocolate, yeast, and freshly roasted coffee. Taste starts off pretty smokey and roasted with a good amount of black coffee and bitter chocolate. The dark fruits come through midway with sweet molasses and hearty wheat bread. An interesting sting left in the mouth towards the end lingering into the toasted marshmallow aftertaste. Very silky soft feel with a medium to full body. Carbonation is steady and noticable, but doesn't take away from the beer. The bite it leaves in the mouth though is something I've never really experienced, unique for sure. For the 13% this is pretty drinkable, still a sipper, but the abv is quite hidden. After all the recognition this beer received, I'm a bit let down. One of a kind beer, but there are plenty out there I prefer over Black Albert. Maybe it's better on tap, I dunno?

The taste is full of rich, bready malt, rum-soaked raisins and other dark fruits, very much like an English barleywine.

2.88,-32.2,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,3,"Drinkability is pretty poor, heavy sweetness makes it a sipper, but doesn't actually taste good. Judged in a blind tasting, beer wasn't revealed until notes were done on all eight RIS's, but this one was an easy guess.","BattleRoadBrewer","Jun 30, 2008"
4.48,5.4,5,4.5,4.5,5,4,"D: This is an exceptionally complex beer and truly unique.

4.06,-4.5,5,4,4,4,4,"Poured the 1/3L bottle into a goblet. Absolutely beautiful beer- jet black with a perfect tan head. Smellso of dark chocolate and alcohol. Strong alcohol. Taste is very different than expected. I taste the chocolate and some espresso notes, but get a thin biting flavor of alcohol and maybe hops? Very thin mouthfeel for a RIS. Effervescent mouthfeel. Lots of fizziness, but plenty of flavor. Very well crafted beer, and different, which is always nice.","DrDogbeer","Jun 27, 2008"
4.43,4.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Overall this was an Excellent stout, above excellent actually, but it did not anywhere near live up to the hype surrounding it. Had I just stumbled upon it I would have thought this was great, and I still do, but it was made out to be so much better then everything else, and while I do have to admit it was one of the smoothest beers I have ever seen, it was by no means the best. Still though its one you need to try at least once as it is highly worth it.","mikesgroove","Jun 26, 2008"

4.18,-1.6,4.5,4,4,3.5,5,"Pours a deep impenetrable black with a nice fluffy light tan ice cream head, ok lacing. Smell is an interesting mix of deep dark malts and belgian yeast. Alcohol is aparent in the nose and a touch of spice. Taste is deep dark malts with some very belgian like qualities. slight coffee and a little hint of cocao like sugar. A nice sweetness, but there is a plasticy hint I dont like alot that was also in the nose (slightly), but it doesn't ruin it. Mouthfeel is dissapiointingly thin, but still good. Drinkability is extremely high for a 13% brew. Overall I like this one alot, but I defenitey do not think it lives up to the hype. A very good beer, and a fine imperial stout I would visit again, but a tad expensive. Highly recommended, but to quote jim carrey "I've had better"","AKBelgianBeast","Jun 25, 2008"

4.97,16.9,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Pours a dark brown/black with a tan head that sticks around for a bit. The aroma is amazing. Chocolates, vanilla, dried fruit, spicy citrusy hops, a bit of alcohol too. Taste is smooth chocolate, followed by some roasted grains, then a lingering coffee and hoppy aftertaste. Does have a bit of an alcohol hotness, but that melds into the whole experience quite well. Very Creamy mouthfeel. Ample carbonation, thick bodied. Excellent brew all around, makes me want to pay eBay prices for some bottles.","johnnnniee","Jun 22, 2008"
4.68,10.1,4.5,4,5,4.5,5,"D:Damn. This is up there with choklat in terms of dumb amounts of drinkability. No hint of the 13% at all. This really is a great beer that in most ways lived up to the hype.

Would definitely have again if it didn't involve selling organs.","aerozeppl","Jun 16, 2008"

4.85,14.1,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Aside from the high ABV this one is just stellar. One of the best of beers I have had and definitely not easily classified into a style. As others have said this is one that is definitely worth the hype and one that you should seek out. The first and last thing that came to mind with this beer was the just "wow." Thanks again to bgramer for the chance to try this one.","thickerfreakness","Jun 15, 2008"
4.35,2.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a dark cola brown to black in color with an average sized medium tan head that fades to a ring. Sweet and fruity aroma, grapes and aged pruniness. Chocolate, a strong belgian yeast, tangy alcohol, and a breadiness in the aroma as well. Taste follows with the chocolate and fruity sweet maltiness mixing together very nicely, grapiness comes thru well, a decent tanginess leads into a slightly dry finish that shows a little of the alcohol. Mouthfeel is fairly full and sugary, a hint of pepper on the tongue, a bit of drying and warmth in the finish. A very tasty beer, definitely does not fit into the ris category. I had read some of the belgian stout posts before trying this so expected it to fall outside those lines and it definitely does. Would fit better in the belgian strong dark imo. Alcohol is very well balanced for its strength and it seems that this is a great candidate for some longer cellaring, look forward to trying it again after a year or two.","hoppymeal","Jun 15, 2008"

4.88,14.8,5,4.5,5,5,5,"Had this one a while ago, on tap at Erasmus in Brugge in early March 2008. I agree with some earlier reviewers that this is not as heavy as some imperial stouts I've had. I remember that there was tremendous head retention. Coffee notes in the aroma and the taste. Great satin mouthfeel. The alcohol level was not overly (negatively) noticeable. I can't wait until I can get more of this back at home.","milwaukeeclassic","Jun 03, 2008"
4.95,16.5,5,5,5,4.5,5,"The beer started off a bit cold from the tap but as it warmed in my hands the taste and aroma intensify.

5,17.6,5,5,5,5,5,"By coincidence, I had just held a Stout tasting event the night before. Among the beers we sampled were some of the best: BellÂ’s Â“ExpeditionÂ”, BellÂ’s Â“Double CreamÂ”, BellÂ’s Â“JavaÂ”, and MoylanÂ’s Â“Ryan OÂ’SullivanÂ’s Imperial StoutÂ”. As great as these beers are, Â“Black AlbertÂ” was even better. It is the most complex stout that I have ever tried. The color is black with a light-brown, lacy head (about 1 finger). The initial smell is malty, with notes of coffee & fruits. The taste is smooth & rich (but not too creamy)Â…there is an initial taste of coffee, which dissipates, and later returns. The taste lingersÂ…and changesÂ…for a long while. While sharing this amazing beer with a few others, I heard the comment Â“I died and went to heavenÂ”. I could not agree more with this. Â“Black AlbertÂ” was as religious of an experience, as you could ever hope (or pray) to have!","WoodyOBeer","Jan 09, 2008"
5,17.6,5,5,5,5,5,"First off this was the darkest stout i have ever seen. I took my glass out to the sun porch to try and see if any light would penetrate. Well the sun did not stand a chance, I have no idea what the srm was but it had to be 60+. It had a thick, creamy brown head that was long lasting. The aroma consisted of chocolate and roasted malt with a slight touch of port in the back ground. The flavor was very rich and warming. Started off with a fresh roasted coffee taste. Vanilla beans and nobel hops in the middle and finished with an amazing chocolate aftertaste. The alcohol was perfectly balanced with the malt and the bitterness. It was warming but never hot and slightly sweet but not cloying. Urbain said the final gravity was 1.030 so he was able to achieve really good attenuation for a 100% malt bill. No sugar or adjuncts in Black Albert. The mouthfeel was very full and smooth. It is the best stout RIS or BIS I have ever tried hands down.","granite","Nov 24, 2007"
