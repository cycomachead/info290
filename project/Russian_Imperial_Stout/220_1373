3.8,0.5,4,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Pours a very dark brown with some ruby highlights. Cocoa dominates the aroma but mixes with a  bit cedar. Tastes of cocoa and molasses with a curious caramel sweetness. Finishes somewhat dry, but sticky chocolate/burnt marshmallow sweetness coats the tongue but the bitter dark grains and hops seem to keep the beer from being too sweet. It's dryness makes it a dangerously drinkable imperial stout.","marcobrau","Mar 27, 2015"

I would not get this beer again nor recommend it to anyone. There are some beers that you would not buy again, but are glad you tried it once. This is not one of those beers. I regret buying it.","mchegash","Mar 21, 2015"

4.33,14.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Nice blend of flavors. Mildly boozy, mildly chocolaty, and a subtle touch of coffee. All about those roasted malts. Almost no hop profile at all. Also kinda sweet at times. Caramel and toffee?","founddrama",
