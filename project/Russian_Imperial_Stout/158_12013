Exactly what you want a stout to look like.  You pick up the roast, there is a chocolate and some coffee.  You do not get the coffee and the roast in the taste but there is limited sweet malt and a touch of lingering bitter, but by no means to much.  Maybe, maybe, slightly out of balance but that is picking.  Age it and I bet that it is perfect.  Feel is a little light for a stout, I prefer them to be a little more chewy.  Overall this is an outstanding beer that I would gladly have any day.","JamieDuncan","Jan 16, 2015"

Lingered for a bit.  Decent lacing throughout.  Smells of dark chocolate, coffee and sugar..maybe molasses?  First taste is really good.  I do think it is molasses. Roasted malts, dark chocolate and coffee.  Really smooth and tasty.  Hides the abv well. Aftertaste is much the same. Outstanding beer.  Definitely buying more of this.","uvachief","Jan 15, 2015"

The Yeti exudes a regal, ancient quality, one that really evokes the halls of czarist Russia that gave the style its name. The generous allotment of American hops counteracts the overpowering sweetness that so many Impy Stouts have, and what results is a complex, sophisticated offering perfectly represents the style while pushing it in a new, more evolved direction.","EOsborne","Dec 13, 2014"

There is enough to enjoy that it must be said that it is undeniably good, but the roastiness and the sweetness seem to be in so much competition (there is a general sense of tasting a burnt espresso with too much added sugar), that they both end up becoming a tad annoying. More harmony is needed in this concoction. And as an Imperial Stout, it would be acceptable, and in this case advisable, to let the fruit and spice shine through a bit more.","BethanyB","Dec 13, 2014"

This one is like Larry Holmes trying to follow Muhammed Ali, while this one is very good in its own right it has a ridiculously hard act to follow in the shape of last weeks Bourbon County Stout. Despite this one not being quite in the same league as the bottle of Bourbon County that I tried last week this one is still an excellent beer & one that I'd consider picking up again were it a little more reasonably priced. The taste was definitely a good one, perhaps a little heavy on the alcohol with this one surprisingly seeming stronger than the 15% Bourbon County. I enjoyed this one & I'm anxious to get my hands on a bottle of the Oak Aged version at some point to see how it compares  to this one","flyingpig","Dec 09, 2014"

I wish I had tried this two years ago when I was on an imperial stout kick. For some reason I haven't been impressed with the style lately and I really no longer have the desire to try new beers in the style. I guess my palette has changed as Brooklyn Black Chocolate was once my favorite beer. I now have no desire to drink it. I'd rather have a good porter in the 5-7% range. Although I've maintained the desire to drink a good, strong barley wine the rich, bold flavors of imperial stouts are a bit much for my palette at this time...I suppose it could change though as I used to like IPA's and DIPA's but about a year ago I really couldn't take the happiness for about a whole year, now, recently I've been drinking a lot of IPA's. I guess I have an ever-changing palette!","mitch3114","Nov 29, 2014"

Body is full, creamy and smooth.  Taste is of nutty, roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, brown sugar, dark fruit and herbal hops.  Finish is long and bitter. Great RIS.","mikeg67","Nov 03, 2014"

The taste is fantanstic. Thick,  creamy,  sweet. It has a burnt flavor like roasted marshmallows that I enjoy very much. Maybe too much hop flavor, but that's the only flaw, and really not that bad of a thing. I might want to age it to mellow out the alcohol flavor and the hop presence.","BenwayPHD","Oct 19, 2014"

Rich nose of dark chocolate, very little roast character, over a nice citrus hop background with only a hint of coffee.  As it warms, light vanilla notes are noticed.  Rich full body with a creamy texture.  Below normal carbonation with no effervescence on the finish.  The flavor profile is complex, but the alcohol is not well hidden.  It begins with rich dark chocolate that flows into notes of coffee coupled with vanilla over a rich malt sweetness.  Roast is noted in the middle over a citric hop flavor and mild bitterness.  The smooth finish is dominated by alcohol and leaves a warm back of throat burn and a burnt sugar lingering aftertaste.  Dial the alcohol back a bit and this one becomes outstanding.","tillmac62","Sep 16, 2014"

There is just enough bitterness and alcohol to clean up the malty body. It has notes of coffee and chocolate and is very well balanced, but lacks significant amounts of specialized textures and flavors that you might find in another imperial stout. It's very good, easy to drink and is consistent with its flavors throughout its temperature range. Solid A.","jsausley","Jul 31, 2014"

It's incredibly smooth, balanced and delicious, but it lacks that kick-in-the-teeth depth of flavor and bitterness that makes Impys so damn delicious. In summary: if you like smooth, well-balanced stouts, you can't go wrong with this one. If you like 'em rough and punchy and you're looking for a fight tonight, move along.","TheSixthRing","Mar 27, 2014"

Some dark chocolate and black molasses provide a bit of balancing, but this is mostly just a big, malty beer. Taste is again big roasted malt, though a firm undercurrent of hops provides some bitterness, along with slight molasses and chocolate on the end, with a long finish featuring more hoppy bitterness. Full bodied, medium carbonation, slick on the tongue. This is tasty but a bit one-dimensional, and my personal preference is against roasty/hoppy RISs.","pmarlowe","Feb 26, 2014"

Not much retention or lacing. On the nose, chocolate/vanilla/bourbon scents are evident. Smells more boozy than it tastes. On the palate, dark chocolate and coffee roast are strong. Malt and alcohol are subdued. Mouthfeel is ample, more full and lingering than most. Alcohol burn becomes more evident on the backside. My hunch is that this would benefit greatly from some aging -- would soften the bite, smooth out the flavor profile, and allow sweeter chocolates to emerge. Will definitely revisit this one after some time.","JohnParadee","Jan 26, 2014"

Flavors are huge, with cocoa nibs, coffee, and booze all over the palate, with earthy highlights. Rich, heavy, velvety body, with a bitter, smoked, roasted aftertaste.

The aroma is a pretty strong consisting of hops and coffee, and very little chocolate. The taste matches the scent pretty well as this is a hoppier stout with a tiny bit of citrus in the taste. The chocolate presence is very low, but at the same time this isnt a strong coffee brew. The mouthfeel isnt too thick or syrupy which lends to a nice drinkability. Overall this is a well balanced and unique beer. One of the most pleasant surprises is the lack of an alcohol presence, which is something that I had seen in reviews was present. At only two months old there was only a slight bit of alcohol when cold, but when warm there was no trace. Definitely a top tier beer that demands at least a try. (93/100)","CTbrew32","Dec 24, 2013"

Lovely finger and a half tan head, then beautiful lacing. Held up to an intense xenon kitchen track light--pure black, no light penetrates. Aroma is thick and sank--coffee, a bit of molasses, and I think dome alfalfa hay from the barn--a unique and intriguing aroma. Flavor is coffe, toffee, a bit of molasses, a bit of fruit, and the hops bitterness comes afterward and wafts up into your nose. Mouthfeel is very thick and chewy. Overall this is an outstanding stout, one of my favorites.","Dsimenson","Dec 08, 2013"

4.46,5.9,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"There is a lot of hype surrounding the Great Divide Yeti Imperial Stout and now I know why. In full disclosure, my sample had aged for about 18 months. The Yeti poured a deep opaque brown with minimal dark tan head. The aroma was straight up semi-sweet chocolate, just like the Nestle morsels. The initial tastes were a bit bitter as it was still cold, but as it warmed the Yeti turned into a deep semi-sweet chocolate wonderland. This brew definitely benefited from a warming drinking temperature. Underneath the chocolate notes were hints of a roasted coffee and a smokey nuttiness that finished with a caramel and toffee sweetness. I believe the hype! The Yeti is an incredible stout and a fantastic drinking experience.","brurevu","Dec 02, 2013"

Now I know this carries spectacular ratings and I wanted to give this some time before I dissed it. I felt when young, this was very chalky and way too bitter. Exactly one year has passed and this still has enough hop strength carrying over to balance with the malt sweetness to make just short of a perfect Imperial Stout. I have an Oak Aged raring to go on one year also. This is a brew for me that keeps it interesting and teaches me not to be too judgmental when it comes to Imperial Stouts. Bottom line, age this, experiment, and enjoy! Chewy enough to say 'Bon Appetite'!","joeseppy","Jul 30, 2013"

Earthy hop aroma with wades of cocoa. Starts off sweet with waves of chocolate, roast, some vanilla, and some light oak like flavors. Feels luscious with creamy feel and ample bitterness. One of my favorite brews. I love the other Yeti brews to a T. This one is great. Just seems a little substandard compared with the the specialty Yeti beers.","jwhancher","Jun 02, 2013"

Great mouthfeel, nice and smooth while still having a small bite at the end (for an RIS). I actually almost prefer this more than the Espresso Oak aged version which I tried side by side with this for the first time. This really is an awesome beer, but not my favorite of the style. It's really good, but it didn't WOW me (I was expecting it to be good anyway.) Due to the fact that it's impossible to get in my area I probably wont be going out of my way to seek this out again seeing as though there are just so many other things I want to try out there. All in all good beer though.","Zachtheporter","May 19, 2013"

The aroma draws comparisons to bakers chocolate, new leather, port wine, and creamy milk. To my delight, the flavor is very chocolatey, along with some earthy wood and tobacco notes. Surprisingly a fair amount of hops are included in the mixture. The finish is tart and bitter. I appreciate the heavy, velvety mouthfeel, and the warming sensation of the high ABV.

I'd recommend this beer to anyone who has not tried this style and is looking for a jumping off point. Yeti Imperial Stout is a good example of an Imperial Stout can be great without any extra bells and whistles. Have it with or without a meal as it can serve as one on its own. Would I drink it again? Yes, cellaring a few to see how it ages.","JamesMN","Apr 11, 2013"

For me, the hop presence in this Yeti adds balance, if a little bit of bitterness, to a nice malt profile. Extra points here for style as this is a great looking beer. I enjoyed drinking this on a cold (it is 13 friggin degrees outside) April night and will certainly drink this brew again.","spoony","Apr 09, 2013"

Flavor follows aroma, with well integrated dark toasted malt, chocolate and light brown sugar and dark dried fruit. Finishes with toasted malt and a perfect hop kick. Medium bodied with creaminess.

I look forward to many, many more of these.","KKB","Nov 20, 2012"

4.27,1.4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the nose. The aromatics were bold, sweet, warming, and inviting all in one. The froth and stickiness to the mouth was equally as pleasant, adding to the tactile portion of the experience. It is easy to see why this is the base for such a fantastic Russian Imperial series, as the flavors follow nicely. It does lean towards the bitter side, but completely within the stylistic guidelines, making for a tasty, winter treat.","TheBrewo","Nov 10, 2012"
4.38,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D - In some ways this stout is simple and straightforward, without a great deal of complexity or depth to the profile (although given the style it's naturally quite complex still). But it's the unique resinous earthy flavor that still sets this apart from most other stouts, which to me fits perfectly with the concept behind the brew (Yeti) and the geographic location of the brewery. Altogether this makes for a superb stout that I hope to seek out again.","Converge","Nov 09, 2012"

More of the same in the taste, roast, sweet malts, coffee and bakers' chocolate, caramel, resinous hop notes contributing a lasting bitterness, with a somewhat mineral aftertaste. Body is on the fuller side of medium. It's not an out-of-this-world stout, but it's a solid brew and quite drinkable overall.

A light amount of ABV booziness is present but it doesn't detract so much as it amplifies the dark fruits that are present. As it warms up, the hopping does become a tiny bit detracting from the coffee and char malts, but it's not a very big issue on my account. Also, the tobacco elements amplify with temperature gain in a linear fashion that helps to keep the sweetness levels in check.","WastingFreetime","Sep 26, 2012"

4.58,8.8,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Thanks are due to EgadBananas for providing this bottle. This was bottled on February 21, 2012, so this is still very young. Poured into a pint glass. Pours black with a two-finger length dark brown head that retains well. The head dissipates very slowly. Lacing is left down the glass as the head dissipates. There are big aromas of dark roasted barley malt and chocolate. It has a bready and slightly earthy smell. I can't detect the alcohol in the aroma, which is a plus for such a high ABV beer. The flavor follows the nose. The roasted malt flavor is very prominent and there is creamy chocolate in there as well. There's bitterness on the back end as well as roastiness. It's mildly sweet as well. I can pick up some of the alcohol, but it's masked very well. The body is full with adequate carbonation. It is creamy and smooth. The drinkability is very high. Overall, this is an excellent beer and yet another great RIS. For someone just getting into this style, this is one that should be recommended.","acevenom","Jun 07, 2012"

However, upon tasting this thing, you realize that it’s not like most other imperial stouts. There’s a tremendous amount of hop bitterness for the style. After thinking about it, those plums and raisins that I caught in the aroma may have actually been fruity and floral hop aromas. Normally, I’m a total hop head, but it just doesn’t seem to fit here. This is a still a good stout that looks great and has a great mouthfeel. Definitely worth a try. I’ll have to get around to trying all of the variations of this beer that Great Divide puts out.","BlackBelt5112203","May 09, 2012"

A rich aroma of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, roasted barley, and a touch of alcohol hiding in there. Flavor wise, off the bat you get the roasted barley paired with some sweetness from some liquorice, chocolate, coffee and some dark fruit, towards the end a nice healthy hit of hoppy bitterness introduces itself and carries though into the finish. The alcohol hides itself pretty well but not completely. Medium bodied to this with a creamy feel though not the most impressive mouthfeel for the style. Overall, this is a big beer and a sipper. It's definitely the best beer I have tried from Great Divide. I'm going to have to give their Oak Aged Yeti a 2nd shot after this, I liked the Oaked when I initially tried it but I am sure a second go of it will be even better.

Aromas are rich and sweet with dark chocolate, espresso, caramel, and somewhat boozy. Tastes are also rich and bold with notes of rich dark chocolate and creamed dark coffee, while finishing peppery with a load of piny, bitter hops. Mouth-feel is medium-to-full bodied, while being creamy yet oily on the palate. The real treat in this one is when it warms to room temperature; fruity esters reveal flavors of dark fruits, plum, and cherry. Balance is extraordinary as all the complexities battle on the palate. Alcohol is warming. Overall, great example of the style and definitely recommendable.","barnzy78","Mar 31, 2012"

It pours black as a moonless night with loads of fluffy, mocha head that slowly simmers down but never disappears totally. Chocolate malts and coffee take center stage with the aroma as well as a bit of yeast and a drip of forest green pine hops. The body is bold yet also very smooth. The taste is much like the aroma with a notable chocolate presence but an incredibly bitter and dry hop finale. Nicely balanced.","puboflyons","Feb 29, 2012"

4.12,-2.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Picked up a bottle from world market. Pours a deep dark black color with a mocha head. No light whatsoever gets through this one, and that is what I expect from an imperial stout. The smell is amazing, a nice milk chocolate character, some nice resinous hops in the aroma, and also a slight nuttiness. The taste is assertively bitter with a mix of chocolately roasted malts and piny hops, there is a nice thick body to this beer which I enjoy. But Cigar City Marshal Zhukov's still has one up on this beer in my opinion. Still a very solid imperial stout for those who like there stouts with some hop bitterness.","Waltherpk380","Jan 29, 2012"

At first glance I thought that it was going to be a little fatter than I was ready for, but it grows on you quick. This drink pours thick, dark and heavy, and foams like a science experiment gone awry. It smells heady and rich – a cocoa, toffee, coffee. Initially, upon appearance, I thought that this beverage would be too malty and cloying. And while a mouthful is dense and lingering it is not overpowering or intrusive. It’s a good example of a full, well balanced Russian Imperial Stout, and with a 9.5% alcohol it’ll warm you up on a cold winter’s night.","beerbellydaddy","Jan 29, 2012"

Worst I can say is that it's not particularly easy to digest its qualities (as it should be) and that the smell isn't amazing. Otherwise, this is a devastating combination of boldness and refinement that puts it high on the list of my favorite beers ever. Would I have it often? No, I'd have to be in the right mood to enjoy this. But those 3 or 4 times a year where I am in said mood? I'll be all over this like a fat kid on a Hershey bar.","ThisWangsChung","Dec 30, 2011"

The favor is big, but smooth and complex: toffee, vanilla and lots of fruity hops.  I have found other stouts abrasive, but not here.  The Yeti Imperial Stout is a milestone achievement in brewing.  Not for the faint of heart, but if you have some experience with stouts, this the Yeti is at the next level.","iSip","Dec 30, 2011"

4.43,5.2,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Creamy smooth chocolate hits hard first, followed by a big note of coffee, definitely mocha-like. Coffee or hop bitterness balances it all out with ease, making sure that the chocolate doesn't ever become cloying. A taste of vanilla sneaks in to help with the process of keeping a seriously smooth beer. Where's that 9.5% alcohol? Hidden almost completely behind that same balancing bitterness perfectly. There is a breath of alcohol in the very end, but nothing that ever becomes distracting. The texture is creamy as well, creating a very smooth mouthfeel and setting the tone for the whole bottle. And the whole bottle is delicious through and through. Some how every sip seems to be just as good, if not better than the last one. One of the best RIS's I've had and I will definitely buy more, as well as all the other cool variations. Great beer.","chodinheaven","Oct 16, 2011"

Really nice aroma! Really full-bodied, softly carbonated and has a fantastic creamy and oily mouthfeeling. Sweet but still quite bitter on the flavors. Oaky and there is much stronger roasted flavors then the aroma would suggest. Burned toast and some nice sweet alcohol that’s leaving a lava-like warming sensation.","EseLocoSS","Sep 18, 2011"
4.15,-1.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"O: Overall, a very good RIS. I think it could really be fantastic if it was allowed to cellar for awhile to let some of the hop bitterness subdue. I will say that this, it is much better than the Oak Aged Yeti that I tried a couple months ago, which was just completely dominated by an alcohol presence that masked all the other flavors (although now I'm thinking I may have just got a bad batch). Because of that I have been shying away from trying the regular Yeti, but this turned out to be a pleasant surprise and a damn good RIS.","zac16125","Sep 16, 2011"

A inch worth, with plenty of lacing. Smell is huge chocolate, coffee, with some tobacco & smoke. A little booze. Taste all those, with a nice herbal hops finish.

3.97,-5.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Creamy mouthfeel, slightly burnt taste, nice hoppiness that compliments the burnt aroma, maybe too much, if this were my homebrew, I would probably drop the roastiness and see what happened. Very pleasant, a nice strong-tasting, thick stout to write this research journal article over. I like this...but I think Old Rasputin is better, more widely available, and cheaper.","smulkowski","Jul 26, 2011"
4.79,13.8,3.5,4.5,5,5,5,"O - The superb integration of all elements is a key to my appreciation here; this is a great beer. Overall, this is one of the better aged stouts I've had.

4.33,2.9,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,"Nose mature large. No oxidation. Mocha, chocolate and pure arabica coffee black nose. Drink very smooth and heavy body. In the mouth, a mixture of pure chocolate Black invade the palace comes to bitterness and to the saturation of the cacao beans on the tongue. The power is amazing and there are many flavors in the drink. In addition, it offers a balance between simply amazing sweet creamy bitterness and roasting. A beer that wears its name perfectly.","ThaCreep","Jul 17, 2011"

4.45,5.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"O - Overall I really enjoyed this beer. I liked the extra hop kick, and how it didn't over power the rich malty profile. An almost balanced beer I'd say. I think the price is too high but it is a really delicious brew. Definitely give this beer a try, if your into RIS, it's got me wanting to try the Espresso aged one and the Chocolate aged one!

4,-5,4,4,4,4,4,"I had a 2011 bottle of this and it pours a very dark black with a dark brown finger's worth of foam into a tulip glass. The smell is of chocolate and coffee, but leans more towards the chocolate side with little to no hop presence notable. Alcohol is well hidden, and the taste is thick, and has more of a bitter/roasted malt taste than the chocolate aroma would make you expect. Overall I liked this, but prefer Founders Imperial for a 'regular' RIS.","tripelhops","May 31, 2011"
4.45,5.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"O- Unlike a lot of Russian Imp Stouts. This has high drinkability. Due to the perfect amount of hop bite, it has a nice clean finish for this style. No real lingering residue left on the tongue. Although still a sipper, the bomber didn't last long. If it wasnt for that pesky rule againstbeginning at work, I could drink this instead of my morning coffee.","Kayn169","May 31, 2011"
3.83,-9,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Had this one a while ago, it poured out very thick black with a dark brown head. The lacing was good here. The smell is a deep roasted chocolate malts with a rich nose of toast and coffee. The taste is rather complex going some a semi sweet to a dry burnt bitterness. The mouthfeel is thick making this one a sipper. I'd like to re-visit this one again one day. I feel it's worthy.","Knapp85","May 30, 2011"
4.58,8.8,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"This beer pours very black, glugs from the bottle like motor oil. The head on this beer is an incredible dark espresso color. This beer just looks awesome. The smell is very much like a dessert. German chocolate cake comes to mind, truffles, creme brulee, roasted nuts, and a nice rich espresso note. The aroma is world class. The taste does not fall short. Big rich creamy chocolate notes up front, cake like flavors, I also get a creamy like flavor that does remind me of creme brulee. This beer is just great, one of my favorite stouts, seriously good stuff.","habanosdarklord","May 28, 2011"

4.35,3.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours black, reasonably thick, with a small dissipating head which recedes to leave just a ring around the glass. Nose is full of dark fruit and roasted malts, nice. Taste is complex... this has aged nicely. Well integrated roast, chocolate, raisin. Not overly sweet, a decent bitterness... pretty well balanced for a big stout. Mouthfeel is thick with moderate carbonation, almost spot on. Overall, I've had this beer a number of times from fresh to this 2 year old version. Both are good, but I think a year to two years in the cellar turns this beer from good to great. Not quite as good as its Oak'd brethren, but still very nice.","khumbard","May 18, 2011"
4.42,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"O: There may be a lot of hard to get, seasonal stouts out there that get rave reviews.

This is a first rate Imperial Stout and I love the price.","fox227","May 17, 2011"
4.05,-3.8,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall: Yeti is such a solid Imperial stout without anytime spent in a barrel! Just a well made beer with a great mouthfeel and great example of the style.

4.36,3.6,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Black as the abyss with a dark sticky head. The smell is roasty and a lot hoppier than I had anticipated. The taste is huge and complex like an Imperial Stout should be! Bittersweet chocolate, caramel and toffee, then finally a big, musty, dry, woody finish. It doesn't have that currant flavor that a lot of RISs do. Velvety texture and so drinkable you need to be careful that the Yeti's 9.5% ABV doesn't unleash your untamed side. Superior lacing, as well. Every sip is a little different. The hops are more noticeable as it warms.","McNealc31","May 06, 2011"

Nice thick globs and rings on lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malts, cocoa powder, subdued coffee, and citrus zest. Slight alcohol notes as the beer warms. Taste is of dark malts, roasted coffee beans, bittersweet chocolate, and slight soy sauce. There is a mild hop/coffee/chocolate bitterness on the palate after each sip. Low carbonation with a very thick and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer. It's nice to try the base for all the other Yeti beers in it's original form. I am glad this is available year-round where I live.","UCLABrewN84","May 03, 2011"

4.42,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"O: A fantastic stout. This one is a bit smokier than most stouts are, despite it not being oak aged or espresso oak aged, but I still really like Great Divide's stouts. It's bold, complex, and truly an enjoyable brew.","Krakistophales","May 02, 2011"

3.48,-17.3,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"O- A good RIS overall. Nothing really stands out other then the intense bittersweet choc qualities. Solid, but many others have it beat. Maybe some age would help to intensify the subdued choc notes past the bittersweet domination. Quite easy to drink quickly considering the semi-rough bitterness.","busterthecat","May 01, 2011"

The taste has a chocolate and molasses backbone. In the middle is a big bitter hop nite presence. The hops are earthy. The malts don't completely balance out the bitterness. On the back end the is a coffee and dark fruit taste. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with a slight alcohol burn.

4.28,1.7,5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Overall: I can only chalk me liking this beer up to it having a year on it. Any of these that I have had from under a year old I simply do not like and my rating would likely fall in the B- range. However, this beer really surprised me today and it is a lot better than I remember. No fusel alcohol flavors.

4.02,-4.5,4,4.5,4,3,4,"A really big, delicious, and interesting stout from Great Divide. It does some things exceptionally well. The aroma is particularly special and picking out individual flavors is a fun exercise, as there's tons to find!

4.08,-3.1,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"O: A well done Imperial Stout in my books that strikes a great balance between big flavors and ease of drinking.

4.3,2.1,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"The beer pours like oil, it's black with a thick frothy brown head that hugged the glass. I smell aromas of roasted chocolate and toffee with some dark fruit. The taste is bitter with dark chocolate, molasses, maybe a hint of bourbon and a bitter black coffee flavor, the aftertaste is of piney hops. The beer is heavy with perfect carbontaion and a long, dry and bitter finish. This is an excellent imperial stout, it is an explosion of flavor.","JMad","Apr 16, 2011"
4.15,-1.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall: An excellent RIS that is well worth picking up and trying. I can't wait for the next 12 months to roll by to see how it continues to develop -- I feel there is still a lot of potential in this one.

Aroma is roast, dark caramel, milk chocolate, smoke, mild coffee, nutty toffee, light pine and surprising floral hops. Flavor is roast, sweet chocolate, sweet toffee, toasted pine nuts, dark caramel, earth, leather, espresso and a nice array of pine, citrus and floral hops to the finish. Odd lingering aftertaste of smoked meat, char and licorice, not bad, but seems to last forever.

The taste brings in more of the same, though the spotlight is definitely on the roasted malts, the coffee (slightly more intense), and the (now dark) chocolate.

It is a little too sweet for my liking. The mouthfeel is the best aspect. Like a lot of Great Divide's beers, this one has a thick, soapy mouthfeel to it that coats the mouth.

The nose is impressive, with coffee grounds, dark chocolate, licorise, and some noticeable underlying hoppy bitterness. As a result, there's a very impressive sweet and bitter aroma profile going on. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this complex beer, though I thought it was dominated by flavors of licorise, dark chocolate and cherry vanilla. Still, what's really striking is the underlying hoppy bitterness in this beer, which counters the considerable sweetness in this beer rather well. Mouthfeel is full bodied, with a long sweet and bitter finish. Drinkability isn't bad, though the obvious high alcohol, sweetness and licorise detract just a bit. Still, while this beer is very much a sipper, it's nevertheless quite impressive and delicious.... a very easy to appreciate and enjoy beer from Great Divide. Excellent!","John_M","Jan 17, 2011"

4.18,-0.7,5,4.5,4,4,4,"This beer is called Yeti because it is a beast! It's black color is only matched by the abyss of space and the dark cocoa head on the surface makes me want to lick it off the top. The smell is extraordinarily interesting. There are the normal RIS smells: the caramel, cocoa, coffee, malt, and booze. There is a hop note that is just as potent as the others which is a floral citrusy pine note from the hops used to make this beer. The hops do also carry on into the taste of the beer. The beer tastes of dark roast whether it be by the darkest of chocolate or some rich roasted coffee, but only the pine flavor comes through. The hop flavor is however weaker in the taste than it is on the nose. The mouthfeel has roast that has a bitterness that cuts through the what would normally be a smooth mouthfeel, and the alcohol doesn't help it strive to perfection either. This is a pretty delicious beer overall and I wouldn't mind having more of it.","Vdubb86","Jan 12, 2011"

The taste follows the nose, delicious. The sweetness isn't too overbearing and is perfectly balanced with the hops, just enough bitterness to notice but not in your face.

On my initial taste of this beer, I noticed heavy roasted coffee flavors and some slight chocolate with a slight alcohol burn. The heavy coffee put me off at first, but by my third taste it had grown on me. The carbonation was just about right for this beer and as a result it was rather easy to drink for 9.5%.

The hop profile is not as strong as I thought it would be either (probably due to being almost 10 months old). This is sweeter than a lot of IRSs I've had in the past.

I was surprised at how much bitterness the 2010 bottle actually had. Also the coffee acidity had died down.

Once again, the fruity characters run amok but only n the background, like little Oompa Loompas. Mouthfeel is thick but not viscous.

Very tough to pick up on the other nuances of the beer when all I can think about is how much I hate soy sauce. If it wasn't in there, then this could be much higher in taste and in drinkability.

Odd for the style, but the first scent I noticed was hops. Then alcohol, chocolate, and espresso. The taste is phenomenal. Bitter chocolate, alcohol, ashes, espresso, piney hops, molasses, and plum. Pretty good viscosity, but I'd like it to be a hair thicker if I had to get nitpicky. I'm not a big stout fan, but this is the best tasting stout I've had. I liked it better than the highly regarded KBS I recently had. Fantastic.","alkemy","Apr 17, 2010"

4.09,-2.9,5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Bomber courtesy daknole, thanks dude. According to the label this was bottled exactly 13 months ago. Appears black in the glass but you can clearly see through to its brownness while it's pouring. Nice thick creamy head, pretty dark too. Like hot cocoa-colored almost. Frothy lacing all over the place. Aroma is chocolatey but also very bready, which I wasn't expecting really. Like smelling a loaf of dark wheat bread. Maybe a teensy little bit of orangey hops. Flavor is less bready with a lot more of the standard coffee/chocolate dynamic going on. I was expecting more hoppiness in the aroma but it comes through in the taste. Hops lend a piney, almost minty character that marries nicely with the chocolate. Finishes dry but a little too astringent. Solid hoppy bitterness on the back of the tongue, the 75 IBUs boasted on the label seems just about right. Chewy full body and very drinkable. Better than the oaked one if you ask me.","illidurit","Feb 27, 2010"

3.93,-6.7,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Rich, dark, black with a cap of stiff brown foam. Good retention & lacing. Smell of dark roasted malts, molasses, tar, dark dried fruit. Taste begins with a molasses and tar like quality, mellowing out to reveal an underlying brown sugar and dried fruit sweetness. Hints of black licorice, chicory, cocoa, italian coffee, earth and pine round out the finish. Full bodied, smooth, but slight grainy and chalky finnish. Very nice tasting beer with a great ingredient profile. A little bolder than a stout, but not as fruity and boozy as other RIS's.","rfgetz","Feb 22, 2010"

4.92,16.9,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Poured from a bottle dated July 2007. This beast of a stout has been sitting, waiting for its consumption for 2 and 1 half years. And oh is it ripe! The appearance is spectacular. The bubbles are so tight it looks more like coffee whipped-cream than a typical head. The froth is rebellious in its submittal to gravity, finally giving its way to a highly decorated, multiple ring of lace. When tilted from side to side the cascading effects are that of a marching band; every member hitting its own note to cause a harmony unparalleled. I smell dark caramel chocolate, vanilla, Godiva liquor and raisin plum with hints of dated pear and a touch of tobacco. The taste is nothing short of perfection. It has bourbon and a wood backbone. Lots of vanilla caramel chocolate, also dates with the slightest alcohol finish. The feel is smooth. Not thick or thin but perfect for this beer. The feel is satin on the palate not demanding too much and going down smooth. I have paramount beer in my cellar: Abyss, Life and Limb, Peche Mortel and others. This is the beer I want most right now.","JosephLondon","Feb 02, 2010"

It is also the most hoppy imperial stout I have had by far which surprised me due to it being roughly a year old. I can't imagine what it was like when first released.

Had an excellent taste. Tasted smooth chocolate and some coffee taste followed by some roasted malts. Fairly sweet followed by a slight taste of alcohol at the end, not very strong though.

Pours pretty thick and pours black with an ok sized dark tan/brown head. The head fairly quickly reduces to almost nothing, leaves little to no lacing down the glass. Smell is pretty good but wasn't incredibly strong or anything. Typical smells were there, roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee. Not much else there or at least I didn't pick much else up, I guess this one might be hoppier than most stouts but it's not overpowering. Taste is similar. Chocolate mainly at first followed by coffee. I though the aftertaste was very coffee like. Really good stuff. Mouthfeel was thick, just as I would want and expect from this style. A pretty high ABV but not noticeable at all, the glass was done pretty quickly and went down so easily. A great beer. I think this one is up there for sure for this style. I've got some more I'm gonna put some age on but in the mean time I'm picking up some more just to drink while I wait.","dismal","Jul 10, 2009"

The taste begins with the citrusy, piney hops and transitions into the burnt malty flavors and has a little alcohol bite. The finish is rather smooth and leaves a nice combo of the hops and roasted malt on the palate and just a hint of alcohol burn.

The feel continues to be smooth and coating. A great beer. I followed the 1.5 year old Yeti with a 1 year old Old Rasputin and there was no comparison -- GD Yeti is substantially more complex and flavorful.

Smooth, creamy, full-bodied and slightly bready, this beer passes over the tongue easily with a balance of roasted and coffee malts that have a drying sensation and also residual sticky sweetness from cocoa, caramel and something akin to molasses/maple syrup. The dryness is helped by a good ol' helping of hop bitterness on the backend, although the hops don't really have much of their own taste; they are overpowered.

I love that the hops stay the hell out of the way in the flavour dept, preferring to make their presence felt in the aroma and finish, yet still integrating with the roasted malt. A couple hoppy imperial stouts I have tried seem to tone down the roast too much, which makes me think I'm drinking an Imperial Porter moreso than an Imperial Stout, but this mistake has not been repeated in the Yeti.

But the two most prevalent aspects are an absolutely huge presence of dark burnt malt, and a prominent bitterness at the end from hops. I prefer my Imp Stouts to be on the sweeter side rather than being more burnt, and this is a little overly hopped for me. It's still very good, but that just makes it more of a sipper for me than something I can quaff endlessly (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). Decent mouthfeel, a little less carbonated by the end than it seems. Coffee and roastiness just sits on the palate, tantalizing you. I might actually need to take some water halfway through this alone just to get a fresh cleanse. It does a decent job at hiding the ABV, but it still tastes a little boozey. Overall, not a bad impression of a RIS. It's plenty flavorful, just not quite as accessible as I like, nor as focused on the coffee & chocolate flavors.

Brew poured to a pitch black color with a thick frothy dark tan head that head great retention and left chinky lacing down the side of the glass, nice looking brew. The aroma really showed of the hops, I was expecting this based on some research but it was a little more than I even expected. The other aromas where roasted to burn malt (charcoal?) , coffee (slight expresso like), and alcohol. The flavor follows the aromas as the big hop flavor really seems to dominate for me. Also in the background the malt comes out that seems astringent and that mixed with the hops seems a little to much for me. Also expresso/coffee favors really show. As it warms the alcohol comes out more and more giving a slightly burning feel. The feel of the brew is good, thick with a slight slick feel, creamy. For me the hopping of this brew is a little to much, I am not a hop head and would love to see what this brew would be like with that hop presence muted a bit.

In the nose the coffee and chocolate actually more restrained than you'd think by looking at it, strong blackberry, plum, raisin cake notes, molasses, the lower malt roast allows more hops to surface and refresh, never unloads on you as you expect. Full-bodied, here you get the full onslaught with Kahlua and cream infused coffee, bitter dark chocolate, molasses, a strong bitter roast and some curry spice keeps it agile on the tongue. Good carbonation but hard to register with a beer of this density. Less fruity here but there are discernible mixed black fruits.

The smell was my favorite part. You get loads of roasted malts first. Then there's a bit of alcohol backed by this molasses sweetness. It really makes me exited to taste the beer. I've ad this twice, once fresh, and one was kept for a few months before consuming. I remember the fresh one being very harsh. The other was decent, but nothing to rave about. There were really two main flavors for me - A bit of fruity alcohol and quite a bit of the roasted barley taste. You could describe both of them in different ways, but that's mainly what you're hitting on. I didn't notice much sweetness, and I don't prefer these to be overly sweet, but naturally it seems that having loads of malt, particularly darker malts, is going to lend plenty of unfermentable sugar. As you drink it, you get a decent amount of carbonation, and there's a bit of harshness that mellows after the first taste. This one, in terms of drinkability is about average for an imperial stout, it was a long, long drink for me, and I would recommend it to someone looking for something new, but I probably won't buy this again (though I may try to oak aged one, I don't know how much different it will be).","taylorhamrick","Jan 01, 2009"

You know a stout is going to be good when the head is so thick and creamy is looks like it could fit on top of a meringue pie! Sticking my nose into the glass I got a rich dose of hops plus a dark, roasty, raisiny aroma from the malts. This is a beer that bulges out of its seams on both ends. Not only does it have all the richness you would expect from such a heavy roast on the malts, but it also delivers a HUGE hop wallop. Nothing faint here. This one gives it to ya straight up. Body is huge! - as full as full gets. Flavor is packed with tons of dark-roasted malt, with dried black fruit, bittersweet chocolate, anise, tobacco, and burnt sugar. The noble dose of hops balances out the big malt attack, leaving you completely and utterly satiated. If this beer doesn't satisfy even the biggest of beer cravings, I don't know what would.

Mouthfeel is well blended and exceptionally smooth, just the right burn from the abv to round out another top score. Awesome flavor, I believe that this has been sitting for at least a couple of years. Incredibly mellow and well blended.

Dark and milk chocolate meet quite nicely in the flavor, with a breath of hops, and acrid bitter finish. Very robust in body, one to sip for sure. For some reason this one has always given me a very heavy buzz that other Imperial Stouts have not. That being said, this is one to be wary of as far as strength.

Pours a super dark ebony with dark head. Smells and tastes very, very roasted. Lots of roasted malt and some dark chocolate, but with a nice presence of hops as well that is particularly detecable in the back of themouth and aftertaste. Again in reference to the oak aged, this ones drinkability ranks a little lower as it seems a lot thicker and more syrupy with real weight and gravity to it. It makes the prospect of having another beer after it questionable. But I'm sure a lot of people would see that as a reason to rank it higher.

Bitter roasted chocolate malts and hops mix to give the taste buds the gift of marshmellowy, vanilla-ey, brownies. The finish is a bitter cream and heavily milked coffee.

4.23,0.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"12 ounce bottle, bottled January 2008. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours very dark brown/black with an inch and a half frothy brown head. Head retention and lacing is excellent. Aroma is roasted malt, coffee and dark/bittersweet chocolate. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's licorice noticable and also a lot of citrusy and pine hops in the finish. The hoppiness overpowers the roasted malt character of the beer somewhat. It's still good, but I prefer more malt than hops in my stouts. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's viscous, creamy and smooth. Drinkability is good too, it is pretty easy to drink. I think it's a good stout, but I prefer the oak aged version. I'll age a couple bottles of this and see if it improves with time.","bluejacket74","Mar 21, 2008"

Lots of dried fruit, chocolate and caramel malt. Taste was similar, although crazy strong. Tons of dried fruit, chocolate, and roasted malt. A good bit of citrus spice too, that shows up as the hop profile kicks in at the end of the beer. Very mild alcohol presence, although its not biting at all. Feel is creamy and thick and very full. Perfect mild carbonation. Thought this one was incredible, although I'm not sure if it's quite as good as the Oak-Aged version (although I really can't remember what I rated that one, so who knows).

I detected lime, pine, a nutty toasty smell, grain, and a little bit of chocolate and maple syrup. The taste and feel are both heavenly. This medium boddied brew goes down cream smooth with just a faint hint of carbonation and alcohol. The intial flavor is heavly sweet and over the long duration finishes ever so slightly bitter.

The initial smell that you get is a mixture of malt, coffee, and a little of the alcohol hits the nose almost like a wine. In the taste you get more malt, good amount of hops for an imperial, and the sweetness of chocolate/caramel. It coats the inside of the mouth very nicely with a sweet aftertaste and the alcohol warming, but doesn't linger too long which is key.

Lots of roast malts, coffee, chocolate, nutty lots of alcohol warming. Bittering is very minimal. I can tell there are some hops characteristics, but I can't pick them out. Heavy mouthfeel, very minimal carbonation and an added lightness from high alcohol. Yeti follows the style of stout, but is absolutely immense, it feels big even for a sipper.

Beautiful jet black pour into the trusty Duvel leaves a mountainous 2 inch frothy dark beige head. Smell is all chocolate and roasted coffee - appropriate as I am watching "O Lucky Man" while I enjoy this wonderful beer. Taste - bye bye hops. If you were ever in there, the smooth chocolate and roasted malts have sent you packing. But then, after several long sips, the funniest thing happened. There, in the aftertaste, at the base of my tongue, some bitterness vainly hung on, a nice counter to the sweet onslaught. Very nice. This has held up wonderfully. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Alcohol is not noticeable. Drinkability? I killed this in under 30 minutes without even trying.","Onibubba","Oct 27, 2007"

Very little lacing adhered to the glass during the sampling. Smell of malt and roasted coffee. Strong taste of coffee and chocolate with a subtle taste of toffee (it took me a few minutes to detect the flavor). Smooth milky consistency with a slight tingle of carbonation and alcohol on the tongue. Taste of coffee and chocolate lingers on the back of the tongue at the finish.

Pours out a thick, inky black with a full burnt sugar head that sticks to the glass, leaving chunky and raised lacing. Aroma is chocolate ganache, medium roast coffee, orange/grapefruit oils, and subtle alcohol. Flavor starts off with intense roasted character that carries on throughout, along with a sweet underlying chocolate. Through the middle, there appears an out-of-place fruitiness from hops and the yeast. Some piney notes come out too and just don't sit well with me. Big bitterness from hops and highly-kilned malts in the finish in conjunction with lactic acid. There are some good things going on in the flavor, but it's all over the place and is something of a mess. Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, and viscous, but I'd really like the carbonation to be a touch more subdued. With some wild-ass flavors and super thick mouthfeel, drinkability is a little rough. I'd really like to try this with a few years on it. I'd take the oak aged version over this any day, even considering the price.","goochpunch","Oct 05, 2007"

Small brown head on it. A few bits of lacing. Aromas of dark roast coffee, hoppy bitterness, chocolate. Taste begins with a fizzy alcohol at the front of the mouth. Mellows a bit in the middle - strong flavors there of very dark chocolate. Very appealling. Ends with bitter notes. We sipped this as the beer returned to room temperature, which brought out an oaty, dark malty taste. Very interesting to see how the flavor transforms through the temperature change.

You get the solid flavor of the roasted malt with a toffee undertone. It leaves the palate similar to after swallowing a piece of dark chocolate. The Yeti Stout is definitely imperial.

On the palate, rather tight and winey compared to the aroma; there's also a green hop taste throughout the palate. Rather hot alcohol note crops up at the mid-palate and lasts through the finish, which is a touch thin.

If it was in fact 9.5% then it was the smoothest Imperial Stout I've tasted, but lacked any real character. A little hop finish was nice and I'm not criticizing the overal flavor.

Mouthfeel is good nice and full low levels of carbonation however it is noticable the finish is fairly dry but there is a somewhat strong bitter aftertaste with some warming from the alcohol.

Absolutely no hint of alcohol here, which can be good or bad, depending on who you are. For this beer, however, it definately works. The mouthfeel is the epitome of "velvety", as an amazingly smooth, thick body coats the tongue and inside of the mouth. Semi-sweet bitterness kisses the back of the throat on the finish. Even though I love most brews from Great Divide, I hadn't yet found a RIS that truly hit the spot. Consider the position filled.

Tastes pretty much like a stout too - in fact, somewhat surprisingly so. Lots of roasted malts and some hints of coffee. There are some hops in the aftertaste, but it's not as substantially different from some other stouts as I was expecting.

The taste is wonderful. A perfect blend of roasty flavors, creamy mouthfeel, and chocolate and dark fruit with brandyish overtones. Wonderful flavors very well balanced, and with a big finish.

Smells of roasted malts with hints of vanilla/chocolate. Taste is not bad and has some character but not balance. Nice roasted malts, some chocolate and vanilla. More hops that I expected in the taste, moreso than Storm King even. Alcohol was very noticeable towards the end. Medium to full mouthfeel but overly bitter, still not bad. Drinkability is average, it's a RIS. They're high in alcohol but it's also easier to pick up the alcohol here, so I don't know what to say. Great Divide is great...this one, though, more average.","ncvbc","Mar 14, 2007"

Smell is of roast and chocolate malts with a nice hoppy porfile in the background. Certainly smelled like an Imperial Stout. Had a rather strong alcohol tone throughout. Taste was of roasted malts with a nice flavor of hop bitterness. It was pretty smooth and enjoyable. Masive hop flavor for an Imperial Stout. Had a rather nice full body with massive roasted and chocolate flavor balance out with the hop profile. Overall a good tasting beer I would certainly drink it again.

The smell was roasted throughout: coffee, chocolate, malts, with a bit of a burnt character. The taste was exceptionally rich with a light burn on the finish as the roasted nuttiness fills the mouth. Very thick and creamy in the mouth as if a generous portion of whipped cream was added to the mix. Warms the body as it goes down.

Left an excellent amount of sticky lacing an the glass. The aroma was harsh, roasted almost burnt malt, strong coffee witn a hint of vanilla. The flavor was intense but a tab harsh. Started of the way it ended, strong long bitter chocolate and dark coffee, that left a tart residue on my lips. Was surprise by the mouthfeel, medium to full body, softly carbonated with a small bite of alcohol and watery. The appearance led to to believe that this would be a thick even syrupy brew. One think I did notice was the hops shined through when consumed cold as oppose to warm when the harsh elements came out. Overall, I like this brew. Although, I enjoyed the Oaked Yeti more. Yeti has alot to offer in boldness and complexity.","GimpyCane","Mar 04, 2007"

Flavour backs up the aroma- chocolate, some licorice, sweet toffee, finished off by a hoppy dry finish. Thick and luxurious. Less hoppy than expected, although I have been sitting on this bottle for over six months. The roasted malts were actually subdued. I enjoyed the oak aged version slightly more as it has more complexity and I enjoy the vanilla notes in it.

Smell was complex, albeit not as strong as I would have liked, but Chocolate, caramel, and coffee all were able to come through for me. Hint of alchol, which is to be expected at over 9%abv. The taste was ...yummy! Totally coffee and chocolate duking it out to predominate this one. Alcohol definatly there s well, but not bad at all, just enough to let you know to watch out. Hint of chocolate came through as it warmed, big dry hoppy finish, very nice! This is a very thick drink, like a chocolate milkshake, very warming a it goes down, very creamy and great late at night before bed! Overall I really enjoyed this and it is a toss up between this and the oaked yeti, I love them both, but definatly distinct and I could see why they chose to experiment with it, though it can definatly hold its own with any Imperial Stout!","mikesgroove","Feb 16, 2007"

Blacker than my ex-fiance's heart. (Not to sound jaded, I actually called the wedding off), with a dark brown head and nice residual lacing. S: Too much to note: toffee, carob bean, dark roast coffee, dark chocolate. Very complex. T: Sweet out of the blocks with a strong, hearty, malted presence that transitions into an alcohol soaked hoppy bitterness. In a word: Delicious. M: Substantial, thick, viscous and chewy. Perfect for the style. D: Given the cold temps I find sessionability limted due only to knowing the ABV, but for sheer enjoyment, I could drink this all night.

Smells surpassingly of hoppy fruit, up against a toasted malt, black patent, dry roasted coffee beans, chocolate and yeast. Taste is medium bittersweet roast, balanced through out with a dark chocolate style bitterness. Some fruit comes out toward the mid section and on the swallow there is a battle between the fruitiness and the toasted coffee character. This is a tasty RIS, but it is strange to me, because of the their hop choice, not that it is bad by any means it is just very different than I am used to in RIS. I except all the toasted stuff, coffee and dark chocolate bitterness, but not so much the fruity hop stuff.

Truck loads of Americn hop aroma. Grapefruit, and evergreen to be precise. Burnt sugar, carmel, dried fruits are apparent. Each drink is bliss. The hop character starts with shock and awe type attack, then a big slap of rich dark chocolate takes the middle, and finishes like a bitter cup of gas station joe with chocolate flavoring.

Deep carmel, toffee and chocolate smell tastes exactly that til the strong taste of hops and alcohol finishes with some cigar and chocolate. This brew is very rich with oily mouth feel which I like. The alcohol is strong but seems to be separate from the overall taste which reduces my "taste" score somewhat. The lacing and carbonation have not changed in the 20 minutes I have tasted.

Its hidden behind walls of malty goodness. Mouthfeel is also big and full. But low carbonation helps it go down smooth. Its hard to find fault in this brew. Perhaps the only downside is the bigness and chewyness of this beer and the fact that its 9.5% will kick you in the ass.","DaveFL1976","Aug 20, 2006"

The high alcohol was notable but not overpowering. Overall, it felt creamy, had a somewhat lingering bitter aftertaste, and went down relatively easy.

The smell is quite complex with roasted malt, chocolate, and a sweet maltiness. The taste is very similar to the smell though in reversed order. The first thing noticed is the sweetness of the malt, followed by chocolate and then a coffee like bitterness from the roasted malt in the finish. I may even be picking up on a hint of hop bitterness as well, but that may just be the coffee like bitterness from the roasted malt. The mouthfeel is quite thick and sticky.

Taste is big, bitter hops up front, with a heavy malty middle. Finish leaves powerful dry chocolate malt with a touch of coffee beans in your mouth. Fantastic!!

I definitely think this beer is better in its style those beers are in theirs and I can taste the same signature that I did in the other two.

Aroma is of very pungent hop atop a very rich malt smell. Chocolate is the most noted of the malt aromas. Taste is similar to the aroma: very rich and very hoppy. A thick, oily hop flavor combines piney and citrussy elements nicely and is first noted in a sip. Bitterness is high. Dark, rich malt flavors soon roll in with flavors of espresso, chocolate, and roast. An overall creamy sweetness is noted as well. Throughout a sip strong hop flavors compete with and usually beat out the malts for domination. The layers of flavor are amazing. Finish is sweet and creamy with a touch of alcohol.

The taste is huge... chocolate, coffee, nuts, both sweet and sour flavors. I'm smiling and puckering at the same time. Good strong hop flavors also. This one is amazingly bitter. This beer feels as thick as whole milk, and is pretty darn chewy. With its rich fullness and intense taste it's like a delicacy so drink it slow and enjoy...","bennetj17","Jan 18, 2006"

Giant maltiness in the aroma, with lots of caramel, molasses, and a bit of roast. Hop character was quite restrained. The bitterness was quite high and there was a lot of grapefruit hop flavour mixed with a bit of pine resin to start. Sweetness kicked in at the mid, followed by a lingering roasted bitterness and lower levels of hop flavour. Full, thick body with a smooth texture and a bit of slickness from the residual sugar. Pretty good balance for such a big beer. Great flavour and aroma. Thanks Zithal!","DrJay","Dec 26, 2005"

Pours an opaque oil black with two fingers of dense brown head, good retention, nice thick lacing---this is one good looking stout. Smell is pretty big floral hops over a nice chocolaty espresso and some brown sugar sweetness. Taste is awesome, a big roasty chocolate caramel coffee burst of dark goodness followed by an explosion of green leafy floral hops. Reminds me of the Black Sun by Three Flloyd's I just had although the hops are less dominating and the wonderful stout flavors come through better. Fulll bodied with a somewhat oily feel due to the hops, this is a fairly easy drinker for it's strength. This is a really suberb double stout, I'm glad I can finally get my hands on it, looking forward to trying the oak-aged one in my fridge.","cubedbee","Dec 19, 2005"

Initial flavor was moderately sweet with a similar, long finish. Medium to full body with a syrupy texture. There was a heavy alcohol finish.

Tastes of dark chocolate and coffee up front followed by roasted malt. Some nice oily hopiness rounds it out to complete the taste. Alcohol not as prevelent as I thought it would be, which is a nice surprise. Overall one hell of an Impy Stout. One of the best I've had.

Everything is there for you to taste and experience, should you care to take note, or you can simply sip it slow and bask in its glory. The ABV is a potent creature, and it will lay you open if you let it, but never once does it get out of sync with the rest of the beer. There's no taming this one, but that feral but sublime nature is what makes it as good as it is, so sit back, relax, and immerse yourself.

The head is very heavy, short and somewhat mottled, with lighter creamy and cocoa colored spots. It stains the glass like none other. The smell is incredibly complex. Chocolate malt, hops, dark fruits, alcohol, and a few I can't quite put a finger on. The taste is not as heavy as I expected, but still quite weighty. Lots of chocolate flavors up front, some quite bitter hops, a little coffee mixed in with the hop flavors, other malty flavors, floral and herbal hops, and a little rubbing alcohol. It has an extremely complex and long lasting in flavor and aftertaste. The mouth feel is really thick, like somewhere between eggnog, motor oil, and hot cocoa. There is not much carbonation to offset this, but it is not terribly cloying. I do recommend a square or two of chocolate to finish the last third of the bottle, just to give the palate a break. This is surprisingly drinkable, and highly recommended.","zjungleist","Nov 19, 2005"

Aroma is full of chocolate and coffee tones brought out by the dark roasts along with a boozy fruit brandy esque note and loads of floral hop character. Flavor is big very on chocolate and alcohol especially as it warms the hop bitterness isn't standing out entirely b/c of the massive loads of dark malt flavor here as well, not balanced at all in your face with loads of flavor.

It is very malty. I can taste the alcohol clearly. The hop bitterness is also more noticable than in most other Imperial Stouts I have had. This beer has an aggressive flavor. It is a little more carbonated that usual, but it is still very good. It leaves a malty, chocolate like aftertaste. I think that this beer might not be the best session beer because it is high in alcohol, and the taste is very aggressive.

Starts with a jab of dark roastiness, then powerful cherry sweetness that melds into bitter, hoppy roastiness lingering on and on. Tremendous flavor, sweet but never cloying and alcohol only shows in the throat warming. Loads of hop bitterness in the finish, it dries out quite nicely, but not exactly in a delicate fashion.

I have been continually impressed by great divide's "big beers" and this is no exception, complex, drinkable and delicious.

Hops rise towards the end and provide a nice evergreen bite. It actually brings out the sweet flavors of the malt even more. Malt has lots of toasted grains and nice coffee bursts.

There is an interesting flavor throughout, kind of an earthy/woody character that really adds another dimension. Soft, smooth mouthfeel that borders on creamy. I've been impressed with the other Great Divide bombers I've had. They're all unique takes on popular styles.

It was topped by a thick, rich tan colored head that retained nicely, and left a delicate tracing of lace on the side of the glass as it receded. The nose has many layers of character. Light roasted malt comes to the front, followed by black cherry, espresso, and a hint of milk chocolate. On the finish there is just a touch of citrus, and yeast. The flavor was just as complex. The cherry and chocolate come to the front, the hops are a bit more pronounced bringing citrus and a subtle bitterness. The roasted malt and espresso are on the finish in the flavor. The mouth feel is very smooth, full and rich. There is little alcohol in the flavor or feel, and this adds to a high drinakbility. I had the oak-aged version of this a few weeks ago, and normally I prefer the subtleties that oak lends to a beer, but I agree with the earlier reviews. This is a superior beer. The oak seems to mask some of the layers of flavor. Left alone, this beer is a wonderfully complex experience.","carln26","May 01, 2005"

Smooth texture, light pin prick carbonation that accents the early onset of the IBUs of the beer. Malts come across as very favorable, coffee and a distinct port-infused tobacco, toffee-like background. Interesting combination of semi sweet chocolate and a more resiny hoppiness than is noticed early shows up in the finish and aftertaste. A very nice beer, not as fruity as some or as oily and hoppy as others -- but an interesting combination of flavors going on here, and many are subtle for the Double Stout style.","ADR","Apr 17, 2005"

Nicely spicy in the middle. Finish was nicely bitter and drying. Also lots of fruitiness. Not a lot of the harsh burnt character one might expect. Malts seem to be roasted to perfection. Right off the bat, the higher ABV is felt on the insides. Mouth was big but not as syrupy as one might expect from its appearance. Tons of tiny bubbles make it really chewy.

Could be a bit more powerful in the aroma department, but good none the less. Mmmthe taste is quite amazing and very complex. Initially there is a toasted malt flavor which quickly transitions over to a mild chocolate and finishes with a coffee aftertaste. This flavor profile covers all that I expect in an impy stout.

Peppery, roasty, nutty mid palate, slightly hot alcoholic finish, and a lingering vinous bitter aftertaste. The citric hops were more evident than typical for the style. Body was chewy and stiff, and the myriad of flavors felt a bit disjointed. This is pretty good now, but likely will become most exceptional after some additional aging in my opinion.

Mildly citric after it's all said and done. Taste brings about more of these intense flavors. A super strong roasted black strap molasses flavor off the bat. Unsweetened chocolate comes next. A shot of espresso hits me in the middle. The hops are there the whole time but a huge hop strike gets me after the espresso. Very piney and somewhat bittering.

The nose is ripe with damp, dark berry esters, charred malt, coffee and bitter chocolate. Berries and bitter chocolate up front on my palate, all the great flavors of a good Imperial Stout are here espresso, charred malt. One thing that set this apart from other Imp Stouts to me though is the fresh green hop presence, almost immediately I started tasting citrus/pine hop flavors and they just became more prevalent into the finish. Bravo!, this may be the hoppiest stout Ive had to date. The mouthfeel is a tad lacking, not too shabby anyway.

Booming flavors of coffee and alcohol immediately greet you, and then finishes with a titanic portion of hops.

Smells strongly of grapefruit and asphalt from the bottle alone. From the glass: very strong, grapefruity hops; sappy pine cones and tar. Finishes like gin (?) as in juniper... and baking chocolate with... yuck, an ammonia-like chemical bite. The biggest problem with the smell, though, is the same as with the flavor--the burning. Initial sips suggest a burnt raisiny sweetness, before being pummeled away by raw grapefruit and carbon. I'm not talking tasty burnt toast/popcorn or the charred fruit tastes of a good Imperial Stout; this is like sucking on a stick of charcoal, or at best, a 50/50 shot of espresso and unsweetened grapefruit juice. Sound good? Aftertaste suggests chocolate-covered coffee beans... why couldn't this have been the flavor of the beer while I was actually drinking it?? Mouthfeel is heavy, sticky, and tingling from bitterness alone; not what you'd call smooth. If a beer's to be "drinkable" it needs to be balanced first, folks. I admit I came in with high expectations for this beer, but for me at least, this is a huge disappointment.","NearerMyBeerToMe","Dec 09, 2004"

The nose is a lot of fig initially, with dark chocolate covered espresso beans coming through. The flavor is really interesting. The initial taste is a blast of dark fruits with a lot of alcohol in there. This moves to a really potent bitter coffee, finishing with a sweet and bitter dancing on my tongue. The finish is almos a bit much for me. Really complex in my opinion. The feel is thick and syrupy, totally coating my mouth. can't get much better than that. The drinkability is okay.

Roasted caramelized malt flavors are present up front along with flavors of unsweetened chocolate followed by notes of smoky charcoal and bitter grapefruity raw hop leaves leading to a rather dry finish.

Aroma is reminiscent of Storm King, huge roasted malt notes with a wallop of hops, chocolate, and booze. Comparing it to Storm King, I think this leans more towards the roastier malts while the King has a hoppier flavor profile. This is equally impressive, and somehow has a stronger, richer, more bitter flavor (though not necessarily better...I love hops!). Mouthfeel is oil slick with just the slightest inkling of carbonation. Finishes bitter and extremely roasty. Gonna get me some more of this puppy for the cold months, it's a warmer for sure, and one that deserves a spot very close to the top of my Imperial Stout heap.","IrishRedRock","Oct 05, 2004"

It seems to take a back seat to the hops and in an Imperial stout, it really should be the other way around.

I would give this a 4 to 4.5 on drinkability but only if you truly appreciate this style; a 3.5 at best if you don't (which I guess applies to most styles of beer).

Suggestions of rum splashed grapefruit along with rich, milk chocolate coated crushed coffee bean upfront in aroma. Swirling releases stately wafts of anise and fermented prune. Incipient in flavor is an agreeably brash suggestion of bitter espresso and quinine, softened only slightly by a backdrop of sweet fudge. Bitterness subsides promptly though, allowing notes of chocolate covered candied orange peel and dark toffee to arise and provide contrast. Becomes more raisin like in fruit character as it breathes, with orange hints fleeting. Underbaked gooey brownie hints surface as well, but sweetness never becomes overbearing, as it held in check by stalwart bitterness, both roasted barley and hop derived. Moderate in body, but aptly dextrinous to support the malt profile. Thins a bit late, with light mocha hints supplanting the fudge presence. Finishes with transient snap of black currant yielding to lingering bitter and smokey roasted grains. A delicious imperial with a tingling, firm bitterness offset by an enveloping, velvety cocoa tone. This could age incredibly, but I'd never have the willpower.

Turns really tangy well above 70F. Nice. Smoky alcohol aftertaste has some veggie. This is a strong, rich, bitter, chocolatey alcoholic brew.

Very big sweetened fruit, with roasty, burned edges. Meaty, whiskeyish alcohol edge. But then a wave of hops knocks all that out of the yeti cage. Hops are big and the bitterness is lasting, well into the finish that still manages to sport some residual syrupy sweet roastiness. Big mouthfeel, but not too cloying.

Bold flavored with chocolate, coffee, roasted and almost burned grain, and an unusual, slightly salty hint of something both caramel and almost soy sauce, but not at all disconcerting.

The nose features an array of scents, notably freshly ground espresso, road tar, roasted malt, tobacco, and minor bittering hops. Once again, quite impressive. The taste department delivers a variety of flavors. Roasted malt, fresh coffee beans, cocoa, and almost citric hops appear at first. As the beer settles for a while, a caramel/toffee flavor becomes evident, and it's very nicely done.
