4.52,6.4,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Overall:  Nothing traditional here.  At last, something not too sweet.  People in the US are addicted to sugar.  This is not what to expect from what is currently going around the US as a Russian Imperial Stout.  This is down to earth and not overly built.  It tastes raw, like something made in the 1800s.  I dig it.","mabermud","Feb 27, 2015"

4.67,9.9,4,5,4.75,4.25,4.5,"Bottle. Brewed May 2011.  Started at 54 degrees.  Poured like a dark brown espresso, not much head, could have been my fault.  Smelled terrific.  Nice blend of malt, coffee and chocolate.  There was no one dominant flavor for me.  I thought it came together nicely with malt and coffee more present, a hint of chocolate.  I didn't get fruit, but something was managing the bitterness very well.  Medium body.  Would have preferred a little more creaminess, but still a great beer.","marieli","Feb 20, 2015"
