4.13,-2.6,4.25,4.25,4.25,4,3.75,"12oz bottle poured into a brandy snifter.The aroma is initially a tart cherry and cherry pie aroma with some burnt toast, dark chocolate, and oak with late caramel. Beautifully opaque, brown-black, with rich, dark brown head that fades fast, but a very thin layer is present throughout drink with a dense, soap-bubble medium thin ring and a few specks of lace. The taste is heavily sweet with a medium heavy, chocolate coffee bitter, and a touch of umami to it. It’s a viscous, chewy mouth feel with light carbonation. The body is full with notes of chocolate, tart cherries, coffee, and a nice, smooth alcohol warmth to the finish. As it warms up more caramel notes come through with a burnt quality to the finish. The aftertaste is that of dark chocolate and cherries with a bit of a smokiness.","ARoman","Friday at 06:26 PM"

As per the description on the bottle and brewery website, I wish I had more so that I could age it and compare the differences it would make. Having said that, 6 months in, and this was nice.","kitch","Mar 31, 2015"

3.31,-21.9,3,3.75,3,3.75,3.25,"Bottle date 8/22/13. After pour there is very little head, pretty dark color. Smell is coffee dominant. Good mouthfeel. Taste is primarily molasses and licorice, not as coffee forward as I expected, with a little bit of alcohol heat. While letting it warm up reduces some of its harsher characteristics, have to say i'm disappointed in this one given its reputation. I would put stone ris, narwhal, and old rasputin far ahead of this one overall.","Steffano","Mar 28, 2015"

4.51,6.4,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,"Dark black color, with about a quarter inch head, even after an agressive pour. Aroma was very much dark cohocolate, light coffee and some dark fruit notes. The flavor had lots of dark fruity flavors, lighter chocolate than the smell, coffee, molasses, some roasty malt flavors and just a tinge of alcohol. Mouthfeel was pretty thick and chewy, just as a good RIS should be. Overall, this is an outstanding RIS, one of the best non-Barrel Aged stouts out there. Superb!","timontheroad",
