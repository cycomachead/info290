The nose is prune to plum with coffee and a hint of chocolate in the background. The beer is clean and the bubbles are so fine that they suggest a nitro beer. A very effervescent, creamy palate starts malty with a dark, nutty biscuit background coupled with big grain flavors seasoned with chocolate and coffee finishing with a dry bitter chocolate astringency joined with grain on the finish. Big body with very fine, soft carbonation.","pat61","Jan 05, 2015"

Deep, rich flavors of darkly kilned malt, not to roasty or bitter, but very flavorful, with notes of dark chocolate, espresso, licorice, root beer, and charred bark. Subtle hop flavors and bitterness balance it well.  Full mouthfeel, a bit tingly.  Nice beer.","far333","Dec 27, 2014"

Taste is similar but there's are much bolder hop presence than you expect with a Russian Imperial Stout. Somewhat medium-bodied for an RIS and more carbonated as well. A different take on the style.

A thin, tight, dark tan head caps it, leaving a fetching, persistent coating on the glass as it recedes in succeeding circles with each sip. The taste is surprisingly free of cloying sweetness: full-bodied, but almost sprightly compared with what I was expecting. Further analysis reveals a backbone of bitter baking chocolate, moderated by dark bread notes. A mature, subtly bitter aftertaste rounds it out. Pillowy mouthfeel. A delight.","Altrurian","0"

3.91,-2.7,3.75,4,4,3.75,3.75,"enjoyed 2011 and 2013 vintages side by side. this drinks better fresh than aged, with the older one losing a lot of its body and pop. deep dense brown color, not as viscous as some big stouts, but not by any means thin. it doesn't hold on to its inch of mocha foam very long either, but it looks tasty enough. nose of burnt barley, milk chocolate, and English style hops. not as dark as some, but the booze is well disguised, at least in the nose, and a residual sweetness abounds. the flavor starts with the heavy roasted barley and moves into a coffee and hop bitterness complex, before finally being rounded out by a little candy sweetness as it finishes. I like this, but ill bet the bourbon barrel addition has a few more layers that make it amazing. as this one stands, it could use a little more body, maybe some oatmeal or something. also, nothing about it really says Christmas to me, no spice or anything, so its hard to judge it in that context. heck of a buzz on it too, better to share this than drink it solo.","StonedTrippin","Dec 11, 2013"

Big, roasted malt character with mild acridity (pleasantly so, lending a nice acidity), there's cocoa, cream and a pleasant coffee grounds character. Mildly hoppy with an earthy and faintly herbal note, this really is a very nicely done straight up RIS. On the palate, the blend of roasted malt, burnt toast, black patent bitterness and acidity dominate, enhancing the unsweetened cocoa character that's present. Faintly creamy, this really is all about dark malts without any unnecessary sweetness. Medium-full in body with moderate, creamy carbonation, this beer finishes long, dry and roasty with more than a modest grainy bitterness. Enjoyable, recommended.","DefenCorps","Beers"

Pours dense pitch black color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy tan head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, toast, brown sugar, char, candi sugar, raisin, light coffee, and earthy hop spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt notes with moderate hop balance. Taste of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, pine, char, caramel, toast, brown sugar, coffee, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, char, toast, brown sugar, coffee, pine, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of roasted flavors, dark malt sweetness, and piney/spicy hops; with no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very excellent Russian imperial stout. All around nice complexity and balance of roasted/dark malt flavors with moderate piney/spicy hop balance; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 02, 2013"

4.68,16.4,5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Port Brewing Santa's Little Helper is a pitch black ale with a thick, lumpy, waxy light brown head that has eternal retention. The aroma is very roasty and perhaps ashy. There is a note of licorice and something fruity-- maybe cherry. More smells come out as it sits, like mint and vanilla. It's quite full bodied, very soft and smooth. The finish is clean and delicate. Wow, this is a really smooth flavor. There's no sweetness in play here. It's roasty but without any coffee flavor. There's a touch of licorice and caramel. The aftertaste is kind of like toffee... but without the sweetness. The flavors are really melded to make a single, simple taste. It's moderately bitter and the bitterness hangs around for a while after the swallow. This is along the lines of a Pennsylvania style imperial stout. It's very full flavored, but it can be just guzzled at room temperature. Thanks to Josh and Lisa (and ask4jenny) for this one.","yesyouam","Jan 17, 2012"

Surprisingly the body of the beer is lighter than expected however it does leave a light coating on the tongue.

Sweet, roasted malt with essences of dark chocolate and even a little bit of hoppy vibrancy to round it out. Mouthfeel is not a rich as you might expect. Carbonation is nice but maybe a touch too much for this style. There is a lot going on on the palate. I'm a hops guy and this definitely delivers there but this beer might be going a little too far with them. The hops kind of drown out the roasted, chocolatey flavors. On the plus side, they seem to give the malt a lighter, toffee-like sweetness that is great and makes it easier to drink. The finish is moderately resiny and where you get most of the dark chocolate and some coffee flavors. This is my first time having this one and I am a fan.

The mouthfeel is rather astringent due to the higher ABV and this beer's drinkability suffers due to that. I've had some cheaper whiskey's that are smoother to drink than this, but it does go with the style, and honestly it's not that bad of a beer, just not one of my favorite RISs.

Clouds of dark tan stay around to coat the beer. No lacing but the suds drop very slowly on the side of the glass. Smell is hugely sweet roasty malts, cocoa and a bit of coffee. Very roasty and imperial stout-like but nothing special sticks out to me. Some earthy hops come into play under the roast. The taste is hugely roasty and cocoa once again. Some coffee notes in there but the sweetness is way too high on this. It distracts me and makes me grimace sometimes upon sipping. The nice imperial stout flavors are there but the sweets are masking it. Some earthy hoppiness and towards the end I get a licorice, molasses flavor. Mouthfeel is good. Thick and creamy body with medium carbonation and a huge coat of roasty malts. Tiny alcohol warmth. Drinkability is decent. The price and flavor are alright but I probably wont have this again.

Hopped with Phoenix, Challenger and East Kent Goldings, and fermented with WLP001 and their house strain. It settles to a jet-black body, with a thin khaki head that dissipates with time and leaves no real lacing. Alcohol, chocolate and licorice lead off in the nose, followed by molasses, coffee, leather?, tobacco?, and some dark fruits. The boozy character fades with time, but doesn't disappear. On the palate, the loads of dark malts lend an acidic tone to the brew, along with a dose of chocolate. There's also some green hoppy flavors, a pretty good bitterness, a sweet backdrop and some late esters. Warming and drying, with a long finish, but a little thinner than I would like. This is too young for full enjoyment - it needs time for the alcohol to mellow and the flavors to marry. Perhaps a year or two in the cellar would do the trick.","mmmbeer","Nov 24, 2009"

More chocolate too. Very low carbonation, sort of heavy, pretty smooth, some astringency from the dark malts, and warmth. Even slightly out of season, this is a pleasant winter warmer.

The malts don't have an aggressive presents and mixes well with the sweeter aspects. This isn't very sugary in feel, and doesn't have an oily residue like I was expecting.

4.15,3.2,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Flavor is quite delicious right before it reaches room temperature. After that, Santa gets a bit too boozy & hot. Dark, bitter chocolates galore give way to some wooden, bourbon-y notes in the middle. Both yield to a boozy, dark fruit finish that's dry and bittersweet. Mouthfeel is warm and inviting, especially around the back of the neck and stomach. The body gets a bit acrid after a while, but it's fun to chew on and nicely carbonated. Port Brewing rarely disappoints; although Santa's Little Helper is a sipper, it's no exception to the aforementioned rule. This beer (at nearly 3/4 of a year old) could use another year or two to fully mellow out and loose some of its hottness, but I certainly wouldn't mind getting one of these in my X-mas stocking.","wagenvolks","Aug 14, 2008"

The taste profile holds very true to the nose with that same rich coco feel, dark rich fruit and a very dry but hot alchol feel. The alchol hotness really overtakes the taste of this beer. I really think it could use a year or two in the cellar. Does give a hint of actual bourbon whiskey in the flavor from the alchol harshness. Mouthfeel is also sharply alcholic.

Lightly carbonated, with a solid but not overwhelming sparkle from the alcohol, the mouth feel is light-medium bodied with a smooth oily texture. The chocolate flavor up front is sweet but more subtle than nose and mouth feel. Finished with a warming dark fruit idea that lingered nicely.

Poured a deep thick black that had deep ruby highlights when held up to the light. Beer was topped off with a rich, creamy tan head that had great retention. Plenty of thick sticky lace was left behind on the glass. Excellant nose on this brew. Nose was a thick roasty/toasty chocolatey aroma. Notes of wood, smoke, and just a bit of bitter coffee. The smell is almost like a fresh baked chocolate cookie. Taste was a little different than the smell. Tons of semi-sweet chocolate, some bitter espresso like flavors, and a little more smoke that was noticed in the nose. Finished quite smooth with quite a bit of alcohol heat, and some tingly carbonation in the back of the throat. Mouth was pretty much silky smooth untill the burn starts. Nice full rich mouthfeel. Better than average drinkability, but definitely a sipper in my opinion. A very well made Russian Imperial Stout. Good and strong like it should be.","jaxon53","Dec 10, 2007"

Pours out jet black with a pillowy cocoa head that sticks around for awhile. Sheets of tan lace along the sides of the glass. Smells of dark chocolate, some dark fruit, a smidge of vanilla and coffee. Taste starts big on chocolate and bakers chocolate, gives way to a little dark fruit then finishes with a bitter hazelnut coffee finish. Lots of layers and nothing overpowers, I think the age has done this wonders. Velvet in the mouth with an insane drinkability with no ABV noticed. Early Christmas for my tastebuds.","franksnbeans","Nov 29, 2007"

4.05,0.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours an absolute onyx black with an unimpressive one finger brown head after an aggressive pour. Stickiness is very good, almost a complete blanket on the sides. Smell is of licorice and fresh french roast coffee. Big caramel malt and molasses apprears in the nose as well. Taste is pretty damn smokey but not all that strong. Santa must like his brew with a good charcoal burn to it. Starts off with a charred wood flavor and a nice espresso-like sting. A toast flavor then emerges with some caramel malt on the tongue as well. Pretty slick across the tongue with a lighter than expected mouthfeel, but I really like it. Very solid brew in a tough style of beers. Definitely a must try.","BeerTruth","Jul 13, 2007"

Smells very sweet and somewhat charred, with hints of cherries, molasses, dark chocolate, and coffee. Taste is very bitter from the start, but with enough sweetness from cherries and the molasses flavors to give it a nice balance. Very thick in body and hides the alcohol content wonderfully. A beer I will definitely be seeking out again when it's released later this year.

Pour of dark, deep brown, with a ruby glint and a rim of tan. Flavor continues in a boldly cherry and bright red fruit line, again holding an amalgamation of chocolate and cherries, all in a sweet, and tart, and dry way. The dryness of the pits combos with the light roastiness to yield character. The sweetness creates delicious sippable boddy. Well rounded and excellently balanced.","CharlesDarwin","Mar 18, 2006"

4.48,11.4,5,4.5,4.5,5,4,"Bottle # 411. It has a definately Belgian aspect in the head, flavor and aroma. The color is black with a very large, frothy and creamy head of light tan foam. The aroma has a definate winey fruitiness along with hints of chocolate, coffee, roast and brown sugar. The flavor again has a Belgian aspect to it with an extreme amount of dark fruitiness, candy sugar and possibly a Belgian strain. Notes of chocolate and roasted malts. Silky, full body and mouthfeel. This is such an unorthodox way of approaching the style but it straight up rocks and there is no denying it.","Crosling","Dec 04, 2005"
4.45,10.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a very deep brown to blak color. No light comes through, but when pouring it looked brown to me. A finger of tan head falls to a fairly solid yet patchy coating over top. Nose really works for me. I'm getting a good dose of chocolate and incredible dark fruits. There is a very slight puff of alcohol, but not big. Flavor is very nice as it progresses from sip to finish. I first get a blast of sweet chocolate and a light touch of soy sauce twang and figgy fruityness, but this moves very quickly to a nice dark roasted maltyness, not quite coffee, but very nice and roasted. This hangs on to the finish leaving a dark chocolate flavor as things dissipate. I'm really enjoying the flavor here. Lots of complexity from the start to the finish. Mouthfeel is thick with a light to moderate carbonation. Its almost a touch slick and syrupy, but it works well with the beer. Really no hint of the 10% in this beer other than a light puff in the nose. I think this is a very well built beer. Best part is the development of flavors from start to finish. Tasty beer.","kmpitz2","Nov 23, 2005"
2.95,-26.6,3,3,3,2.5,3,"Pour a nice dark body with a slight tan head, no real lacing noticed. Smells winey and alcoholic with some roasty bits of malt. Taste is very winey, more like a sweet barely wine laced with alcohol and a roastedness more like a regular stout than an Impy. The hops are really not there and I wish it was a bad bottle or something but it does not taste oxidized at all or anyhting else that would constitute a bad bottle. The body was thin and wel carbonated. A sipper for sure but not something worth seeking out.","Higravity","Oct 09, 2005"

Thanks to OstrungT for the bottle and three BAs for sharing it at a BA gathering organized by crosling. Pours a one-finger brown head over a pitch black liquid. No edging when held to light. Smells chocolate and toffee with a hint of alcohol sting. Coffee upon further examination. Tastes sour tart black patent, but also sweet caramel and toffee. Coffee is understated compared to the other flavors and I picked up either some falling apart grassy hops or some developing cardboard (ie; oxidation). Dry coffee roasty aftertaste.

This beer pours jet black with a dark brown head. When held to the light, no light shines through the thick tar like liquid. The head is very thick. It fades very slowly leaving very thick laces. This beer smells very strongly of coffee. Also, I detect a very strong chocolate aroma. The alcohol is also very present in the aroma. It smells slightly of caramel. It smells sweet. That beer tastes very strongly of coffee. The alcohol warms my throat as it goes down. It has a chocolate flavor. Also, is tastes slightly of caramel. The malty sweetness is also present. I dont detect much in the way of hops, but that is probably because the strong malty flavors are so present. This beer is still carbonated well despite the 10 months of ageing. It goes down smooth leaving a warm, coffee flavor on my palate. I dont think this beer would make a very good session beer because it is very aggressive, and the alcohol content is high. But this beer is wonderful. It is great in small doses. This is one of the best Imperial Stouts I have ever had.","OStrungT","Jul 08, 2005"
