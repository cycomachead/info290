4.33,0,,,,,,"Pour is beautiful, even for a plastic cup, haha. Dark translucent mahogany with an initially massive, dense tan colored head. Remains a finger thick throughout and also completely covers the cup in sheets of lacing. Aroma is much richer and stronger than the eis maibock. Toasted malt, dark fruit, chocolate, raisins, etc dominate the nose. Body is well carbonated and medium thick with a lingering chewy, malty nuttiness. Flavor has much better managed alcohol than the eis maibock and is a rich blend of initially sweet dark fruits, complex crystal malts before a mild coffee and nuttiness takes over. My favorite eisbock of the day and a nice variant of the regular Instigator.","yourefragile","Beers"
3.98,0,,,,,,"D- A very full flavored beer and well concealed alcohol for the style. The malt is smooth and makes for a drinkable Eisbock, which I didn't really expect. A big lager with plenty of umph and still drinkable","Slatetank","0"
