4.35,11.5,3,4.25,4.5,5,4.25,"Overall: Not my favorite eisbock, as the Aventinus eisbock is a tough act to follow. However, it is pretty darned tasty, loaded with a depth that cool temperatures can mask. I'd repeat this beer, were I to stumble upon it on tap anywhere, or find it on a shelf in a place where the Aventinus were not available.","UrbanCaveman","Jan 28, 2015"
3.99,2.3,4.5,4.25,3.75,4,4,"Hofstetten Granitbock Ice pours clean, brilliant chestnut with a thin film for a head that dissipates to nothing. Raisins, alcohol and rich sweet malts dominate the nose.  It has rich dark bread malt flavors and traces of fruit but it tastes a little metallic – like when you are doing carpentry and are holding nails in your mouth, there is a dash of salt in the finish and the alcohol is a touch too hot. It has a full body and the carbonation is below average.","pat61","Jan 18, 2015"

3.99,2.3,3,4,4.25,4,3.75,"Beer is heavy-bodied, with carbonation of low intensity, resulting in a smooth (9/10) and just slightly foamy (1/10) mouthfeel that's perfect for a heavy, high-ethanol beer of such intense sweetness. Ethanol felt lightly as warmth in the nostrils and a light burn on the throat and tongue: ethanol generally well-hidden. Good for the style Closes dry, with heavy stickiness clinging to the palate and lips.","falloutsnow","Dec 05, 2013"

This didnt quite live up to that high bar, but it is still a good brew that is worth trying inside the style.","alex_hart","Apr 13, 2013"
3.75,-3.8,2.5,3.75,4,3.5,3.75,"Straight up pour gives a one finger light brown head that vanishes instantly, leaving no lace. Murky brown color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Bourbon nose, flavor is alcohol flavored molasses, some dark fruit with a dry finish. $8.99 for a 330ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, MA.","jdhilt","Apr 01, 2013"

4.03,3.3,4,4,4,4.25,4,"Poured a brownish body with one finger offwhite head and some lace on top of an aroma that was strong, almost like a sticky sweet smell if that makes sense, barley malt aplenty, yeast pokes out and some dark/sweet fruit. The brew is creamy, smooth, the yeast makes it fluffy on the tongue and easy to pass, with a balance of caramel and toffee sweetness and good malts that border on roasted and some fruit flavors that border sweet fruit and dark fruit but I can't really pinpoint them. There are not really any citric type fruits like orange that sometimes poke out with a good amount of yeast in a beer, but the finish is a little crisp and these bitter citric hops poke out on the finish, overpowering the sweet malts and dryer malts. A very good beer that has a great balance of hearty maltiness and sweetness.","clayrock81","Feb 04, 2013"

Overall, it is a good brew, but a more traditional version with more sweetness in the finish would have been better.","nickfl","Aug 10, 2012"
