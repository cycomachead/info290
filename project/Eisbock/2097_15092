Kuhnhenn has a habit of making special (and rare) beers but Winter Wonder Lager continues to be one of my favourites in their portfolio. There's as few beers like this one as there are places to buy it; if you're ever in the Detroit area and happen to spot a bottle, don't pass on it!","biegaman","Dec 20, 2013"

4.3,11.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, 2012 winter solstice bottling. Pours hazy deep ruby red color with a 1 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big raisin, cherry, apple, pear, apple skin, molasses, pepper, clove, coriander, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, herbal, and earthy yeast spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of huge sweet raisin, plum, cherry, pear, apple, molasses, caramel, toffee, pepper, clove, herbal, toast, brown sugar, light chocolate, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark and light fruits, caramel, toffee, molasses, toast, clove, herbal, light chocolate, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, balance, and robustness of malt and yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish surprisingly. Medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and syrupy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Doppelbock style! Huge complexity, balance, and robustness of flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 13, 2013"

4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Big thanks goes out to the GBX Crew (beeruser & funkydelic) for sharing this one during a recent tasting! 2009 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller oversized wine glass. Poured a brownish orange with a very minimal off-white head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, sugar, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, sweet alcohol, sugar, and wood. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I really was surprised by this one upon inspection with both the flavor and aroma. The sweet alcohol aspect on this one is really what sealed the deal for me on this one. It added a nice level of complexity. Definitely worth trying if you get the chance to do so.","thagr81us","May 15, 2012"

Some fruit - dried apples, raisins and prunes - as well as a little leather, are present. The alcohol is present and potent, though not as prominent as I'd expect. Apart from a little caramel, though, this does start to fall off on the palate. Bitter (almond skins) on the finish with brown sugar, a little licorice and some prunes, this beer is full in body, lightly carbonated. Decent, enjoyable even, in 2-4oz servings, but 12oz is a bit of a chore.","DefenCorps","Mar 07, 2012"

4.5,16.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Tons of rich toffee and caramel initially on the nose, once it warms up though it becomes one of the most complex aromas I have ever encountered. Light alcohol notes, hints of dark cherries and fruit, light chocolate and almost a root beer like touch as it really comes up near room temperature. To say the aroma was inviting would be an understatement, this was intense. Smooth, full, thick body on this one really let the flavor just coat your tongue, and again this was an expierence all its own. A malt monster, caramel and light molasses notes led the charge until a soothing, candy like chocolate and toffee notes come in. But it was the fruit like cherry notes and rich cola flavor that set it apart","mikesgroove","Apr 17, 2011"

3.2,-17.1,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Pours a moderate brown color with some amber coloring in there as well. Very thin off-white head and a few legs down the side of the glass. Slight collar. Nose is loaded with dark fruits and some alcohol. Slightly spicy as well. Taste is a bit oxidized and really quite warm. Warm as in lots of booze, even for an eisbock. Low carbonation. Decent but probably way too young. Normally Kuhnhenn hides alcohol better than this.","Thorpe429","Jan 31, 2011"

4.1,6.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Bottle. 2007 vintage. Poured into a CCB snifter. Pours an opaque rusty mahagony color with zero head, only a razor thin collar around the glass. The aroma is intriguing with notes of dark fruit like cherry, plum, and raisin. The booze is pretty evident upon the first sip of this brew, not in a bad way, but in a "let's just sip on this" way. Sweet and malty with a heavy mouthfeel this beer starts sweet with dark fruit notes that transitions to a long drawn out finish with some bitterness. Big and chewy. Alcohol warms you as you drink. Pretty nice although the lingering bitterness is not that pleasing.","kbutler1","Jul 03, 2010"

1.18,-69.4,2,1.5,1,1,1,"Thanks, Barry. 09 vintage. Murky rusty copper body with a thin cap. Ridiculously sweet bubblegum aroma. Booze, caramel and spice make up the rest of the smell.

4.14,7.3,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Drinkability: An odd, complex, and unique beer. It's definitely an eisbock - that is, it's a malty brew with Belgian yeasty overtones - but this one has a lot going on in places. Typical of Kuhnhenn - the brewery that seems like it's done in some guy's basement, rough edges, high abv%'s, small batches and all - to produce something like this. The 13% (or 15%, or 12%, or 18%, or whatever this year's batch is - also very Kuhnhenn-esque!) is definitely feelable, if not noticeable in the taste or aroma. A potent lager win for Kuhnhenn, even if the alcohol retardation is occasionally noticeable and the sweetness is rather formidable.","CrellMoset","Feb 06, 2010"
3.7,-4.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"A 12 ounce bottle thanks to DrJay. Bottle states - 2007 vintage, 15.5%. Uncapped and poured into my Ithaca shaker glass. The lager appears the color of murky iced tea with a good inch or so of quickly fading, light tan head. Nose and flavors consist of sherry, brown sugar, molasses, plums, sweet cherries, fermenting over ripe apples, alcohol (although it wasn't as hot as I was expecting), sweet caramel, a peppery spiciness, overall, quite sweet and a bit boozy. Medium to full bodied with ample carbonation levels. A noticeable alcohol burn in the throat after each sip. The sweetness gets to you after a bit and that hurts the drinkability.

This brew is nicely sweet with overly ripe apple tones and a malty spice based pofile. Maybe some creamy dark toffee notes come through on the back end of the palate.

A sipper, at 15.5% covers the alcohol extremely well, this fucker sneaks up and smacks you good and hard. Thanks a lot Russ!!","Viggo","Feb 12, 2007"

3.85,-0.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"2004 vintage. Pours amber to golden in color and clear, an aggressive pour shows only a faint gathering of cream foam that quickly recedes. Aroma is sweet and malty, some appley sweetness, sprite like smell and some port like alcohol wafts up. Taste shows an apple and ginger like sweetness, a strong bready and caramel character, and a good size warming and dry alcohol finish. Fairly light in body for its strength, a nice spiciness hits the tongue from the alcohol, there is a faint tart apple quality that lingers. An enjoyable nightcap, I think this 04 has already peaked and will not go too much longer. Still, a nice after dinner treat.","hoppymeal","May 07, 2006"
3.83,-0.8,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Not that I would ever be classy enough to do this, but this would make the perfect beer for a reduction into a marinade for some red meat. I'm imagining venison stewed in a couple bottles of this for a couple days, and wishing I had the kind of money to drop on a meal like that.","UnionMade","Dec 30, 2005"
4.67,21,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"The most interesting aspect of this beer was the nose. A weird yet interesting mix of aromas, especially the bleu cheese notes. That reminded me that I have a small chunk of Bleu d' Auvergne in the fridge and oddly enough, the pairing works quite well. A dangerously drinkable beer. Tough to find outside of the brewery when they have it. If you find it, buy all that is available. I did.","ypsifly","Dec 24, 2005"
4.57,18.4,4,4.5,5,4.5,4,"On tap at the brewpub, listed as 15.5%. This beer was a hazy, deep amber colour with a bit of a reddish hue. The short, off-white head showed great retention and left sheets of fine lace on the glass. Complex aroma with a mixture of bubblegum, orange, banana, and floral hops. Alcohol became evident as it warmed. The huge sweetness assaults the palate, but other flavours help bring this into perspective. The bubblegum, orange, and banana character appeared again, but this was supplemented by pineapple and lots of citrus at the mid-point. This created an intensely complex fruit character. Low bitterness overall, with mild alcohol and a lingering sweet finish. Heavy body that was on the syrupy side, but didn't become overbearing. The carbonation was well-integrated and refined. I was surprised at how well the alcohol content was masked in the flavour, but this stuff really messes you up fast. An exceptional winter beer, I highly recommend it.","DrJay","Aug 20, 2005"
4.33,12.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured amber with a tan colored head that give way to nice lacing. Smells of alcohol and fruit. Apples, grapes, and bubblegum with an alcohol finish flood my mouth. Mouthfeel is very thick and warming. Halfway through the glass and I feel my face getting a little flush. Very drinkable, not sure I'd get another growler to myself though.","TheBlackMallard","Jul 29, 2005"
4.65,20.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1/4" beige head over the glowing burnished copper brew. Head fades quickly to an uneven layer of bubbles, not unexpected for the style, and average lacing for this abv is actually impressive. Aroma is bubblegum fruitiness, with warming alcohol, even in the nose. Flavor is sweet maltiness upfront, with the bubblegum carrying in here as well. A vinous tart close, and subtle warming is the only indication of alcohol here. For the style, the mouthfeel and drinkability are stupid good. Wow. Check this out if you can.","ppoitras","Mar 29, 2005"
4.62,19.7,4,4.5,4.5,5,5,"12ozer bottled in 2004 and picked up at the brewpub. Pours out thick deep reddish brown with a good sized off white head. No lace and the head quickly drops down into the murky body. Big dark ripe fruity notes come out as soon as this is poured. There is a touch of alcohol peaking though but nothing to hint at 15%. More sweet fruit notes are released as this warmed. Some notes of toffee and light maple syrup are noted as well. The flavor is equally big in fruits mainly of the dark variety. Some molasses and caramel. Very rich malty flavor that hides the alcohol extremely well. The sweetness manages to keep from being cloying as well. This stuff is very thick with a big warming quality to it. Right after the first sip you know this was strong stuff with the way the warming is. Pretty damn drinkable too in my opinion. I would have liked more than one bottle even though it took me awhile to finish. This is just an ideal beer to be sipping on in the cold months or anytime for that matter.","meathookjones","Mar 01, 2005"
4.08,5.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"12oz bottle. 2004 bottling. Fiery crimson with russet edges. Small head of thin off-white big bubbled foam fades quickly leaving no lacing patterns. Bubbles stay and form a halo ring though. Pretty stuff. Aromas are intense. Brash, alcoholic, phenolic, yeasty, fruity, suede-like, and leathery are some terms i'd use to describe the aroma of this brew. There are also some uniquely fruity (pear) notes tucked into this complex and elbaorate spectacle of aromas. The first sip is intense in flavor as well. Fruity pear notes with some leather in the mix as well. Also some German hop notes, and a biscuty o-fest malt character as well. It's very interesting to see such subtle flavors come through in such a big beer. Mouthfeel is thick, viscous, and coating a warming sensation is evident in the sip and swallow of this concoction as well. Drinkability is good for this interesting concoction but not amazing. This is some damn fine nectar on it's first birthday but I can only assume that it was all too brash in its youth. Not a world class champion like the raspberry eisbock, but a good German styled double-strength eisbock all the same. However, I must say that Southamptons version simply demolishes this one. Another Kuhnhenn master piece, but not my favorite from these truly talented brothers.","francisweizen","Feb 22, 2005"

The flavor is candy-like...sweet and semi-fruity. It is a pretty easy drinking brew for the 15.5% alcohol level. A tasty digestive brew, after StuBob's stir fry.","BeerBuilder","Beers"
