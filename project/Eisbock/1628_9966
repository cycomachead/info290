3.63,-9.7,3.5,3,3.75,4,4,"As an Eisbock, this is a very good interpretation of the style. However, as an enjoyable beer, this doesn't quite cut it. Certainly worth trying since there are so few pure eisbocks around. Expect an experience... just not necessarily a great one.","SpeedwayJim","Feb 10, 2014"

4,-0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Beer is thick, like syrup, dry on the finish, very dry, malty and slightly oxidized, a little plums and stone fruits with some raisins and figs. Interesting, very nice beers but the older one is probably over the hill at this point.","drabmuh","Jan 12, 2012"

3.65,-9.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O: I was expecting this to just be disgustingly boozy, but it was actually nicely hidden (especially for 18%). A nice beer to try, but not amazing.","womencantsail","Apr 14, 2011"
3.63,-9.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"O - Well, for something this high in alcohol, it is pretty easy to drink, although there is not tons of flavor on it. A nice sipper that you can relax with. I used to drink a lot of scotch, I could have this at night instead.","AgentZero","Apr 10, 2011"
3.83,-4.7,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"D - The alcohol is impressively disguised, and 7oz is actually a fairly appropriate serving size - I think I'd be done if I tried to tackle a 12oz (or larger) on my own. Drinks more like a spirit than beer, but quite enjoyable as a nightcap. I'd really like to try this again with more age on it, as I can imagine it being quite special at the 4-5 year mark.","MasterSki","Feb 21, 2011"
4.3,7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"O - I liked this one. Similar to a mead, which I love. The sweetness and booze make this a sipper, not to mention it would put you on the floor at 18%. Recommend!","Sean9689","Jan 16, 2011"

3.55,-11.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,"The taste isn't quite as fruity and is more toward sugar overkill. It's balanced out by a good dose of booze, but I'm not sure these are really the two things I'd like to have balancing one another out. Medium body with low levels of carbonation. Sugar and alcohol just end up making up too much of this beer and I wasn't terribly impressed, though I did quite enjoy the nose.","Thorpe429","Beers"

4.37,8.7,3.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"D-Only not a 5 due to the 18%....this one WILL kick you in the ass for sure if one does not respect it. Absolutely unreal smoothness! This one is all caramel and alcohol....a liquefied, adult version of a Werther's Original!","Deuane","Mar 06, 2010"

3.98,-1,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Thanks very much to Thirstybird for sharing this - I know he had to wait in the cold for a while to score this. Bottle #65/70 served in a tulip. Poured a translucent copper - no head, just some bubbles. Nose is very subtle - malty, some caramel and a hops character reminiscent of a German pils. Taste consistent with nose. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and slightly viscous with a little heat up-front, that gradually dissipates at the back. I am pretty shocked that this is an 18% beer. Good thing it comes in small bottles because it is deceivingly light and easy to quaff.","Jwale73","Dec 12, 2009"
3.67,-8.7,4,2,4,4.5,4.5,"Overall: Ummm... Hello??? Alcohol? Are you there? This drinks like a non-alcoholic beverage and thats what makes this beer crazy. Even half a pour and I'm buzzed so its definitely there, you just won't notice it until the end. Unfortunately for me the beer has some faults in the way of harsh bitterness and graininess that needs to be mellowed out more. For everyone holding onto those icebocks, they definitely be aged to get more complexity out of them.","phattysbox","Apr 02, 2009"
4.5,11.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This was a rare treat. It drinks somewhere between a spirit and a beer. It doesn't hide its alcohol, but I found it complex and very enjoyable.","HopHead84","Nov 04, 2008"
4.55,13.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"This was in my top five beers to try list forever until Mike shared his wealth, have not had many beers of this strength but this one took me for quite a journey, like nothing I had before, wish this was not as rare and I could revisit and experiment with aging this for different periods of time, this is 187 milliliters of complexity, there is a reason why this won gold at GABF in 2000, feel honored to trying something that says not for distribution or sale on the side of the label, would love to drink again and especially an older vintage, highly recommended","Floydster","Sep 04, 2006"

4.1,2,4,4,4,5,4,"Initially a bit sparse and husky and fairly underwhelming until the mid-palate. After that, creamy, buttery, caramel and fruit filled malt roam about, combined with a rich and luscious, huge and succulant body, especially after the mid-palate. Overall, it could be a bit more concentrated and richer up front, the finish could be longer and it could be a little sweeter as well. Overall, this is not as good as other extreme Eisbocks I have had, particularly Broken Keg Eisbock, from the old PP Carlsbad brewer.","Crosling","Aug 08, 2005"

4.59,14.2,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured a dark golden color with a small, off white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of caramel and toffee malts, light dried fruits, and alcohol. Taste of caramel malts, wood, nuts, sweet caramel and honey. Alcohol was present, but balanced well, a really nice eisbock, thanks EDA!","egajdzis","Jan 17, 2005"
4.38,9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"at my favorite brewery (Kuhnhenns) with wohlfs. flemdawg, hoppybunny, and eyedrink ale. thankyou eyedrinkale for bringing this in. bottle #35. poured copper, with no head. aroma 1st smell got a sour aroma than the alcohol, fruity, like apricots, maybe pears, honey, vanilla, and malts. flavor, peaches, honey, caramel, hints of malts and the alcohol came out just right and for being 18% was not to strong at all and a nice dryness.","walleye","Beers"
4.87,21.1,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"A big apology for my first review that referenced a joke (as I saw it), that was, in fact a very bad judgement call on my part. I'm sorry everyone, and very thankful for my chance to try this magnificent brew! Phil is brewing wonderful beers and I am very impressed each time I make it out to the village of Southampton.","francisweizen","0"
