3.75,2.2,,,,,,"Pours a reddish brown with a two finger caramel colored head. Smells very bready and slightly nutty with mild toffee sweetness. The flavor is divided.  It's half sweet bread and half alcohol. I like it,  but I feel I might grow tired of it.","BenwayPHD","Oct 20, 2014"

This is not going to do the job. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Bine & Vine in San Diego.","mactrail","May 13, 2013"
