4.07,-7.3,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a beautiful ruby color with no head or lacing to speak of.  It just looks syrupy.  The smell is concentrated raspberry puree with a hint of chocolate.  Almost port like.  The taste is pretty incredible for a 15.5% beer fresh.  Just bursting with fresh raspberry flavor with a bit more chocolate on the finish.  Not much alcohol bite.  Mouthfeel is rather syrupy but to be expected.  Overall this beer is a pretty amazing achievement.  The bottle was split between four people and the 3-4 oz taster was all I needed as it was quite sweet and almost became slightly medicinal the more I sipped on it but it is some pretty incredible liquid and I am excited to see what a few years of age does to one of these.","adapt313","Mar 11, 2015"

Pours bright and dark red with no head at all even with a vigorous pour. Huge sweet raspberry and booze aroma, some caramel or toffee, lots of sweet syrupy sugar smell. So much sweet berry. Flavor is sweet straight raspberry jam/preserves, and then some toffee like malts tingling the tongue with plenty of booze in the background. This is very sweet with a thick nearly syrupy mouthfeel but balanced with some light carbonation as to make it more drinkable. Huge flavors in this brew for sure. Made for the raspberry lover. Very nice and a bit hot. An awesome treat as an after dinner drink, just make sure to pour yourself a small glass around 4 oz. Tough to drink much more than that.","BMMillsy","Feb 13, 2014"

The nose comprises deep raspberry jam, a twinge of what seems like vanilla bean in the background, and a slight sense of vinyl. The taste brings in more of the same, with the raspberries shining, some mild booze creeping in, and the vinyl coming through as a stronger pall of plastic. This plastic-ness doesn't fade. The body is a light hefty, with a relatively light carbonation and a thickly fluid feel. Overall, a nice enough fruited eisbock, but that plastic character is in no way endearing and kind of leaves a bad taste in my mouth (in both manners).","TMoney2591","Sep 27, 2013"

Full mouthfeel along with an oily/sticky texture, and the carbonation was flat throughout. Overall, quite tasty beer with some underlying raspberry-like booze to finish off.

4.41,0.5,3.75,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"a really one of a kind bottle of beer here. all the thanks in the world to thebrewo for hooking this one up for me via trade. the pour is the least impressive feature, with brown and red meeting in the middle in terms of color, and only paltry carbonation resulting in almost no head. it looks more like a glass of wine, which is okay in this context. the nose hits like a freight train, super fresh raspberries abound. not like, genetically modified grocery store berries, but fresh picked off the pricker bush, middle of august berry. there is also some bitter cocoa in there too, giving the scent of chocolate covered fruit. the alcohol does have an aroma, but it isn't nearly as biting as one would expect in a beer over 15% abv. the flavor is a glorious combination of raspberries and chocolate and wood. I get so much organic fruit, not syrups or extracts, but straight up farmers market. the chocolate creeps in slowly, and is more like bakers chocolate than anything else. there is some sweetness from the berries as well as from the middle of the road malt profile. the alcohol isn't tasted until the very finish, but then becomes quite hot. as the beer warms, the alcohol becomes even more potent, but the beer still finishes with a drying feeling. carbonation is underwhelming, but that's indicative of the style more than anything, and the body is plenty big. its certainly a bottle to share, but one of the more enjoyable fruit beers I can ever remember drinking. thanks again to thebrewo for making this experience possible. its a trip in a glass.","StonedTrippin","May 06, 2013"

It smells like chocolate- covered raspberry explosion. The taste is a fruit bomb like no other I have ever experienced. Extreme thickness and depth here. THe fruit is layered in a way that is so precious. An elite bottle of beer, and more of an experience than a beverage. Wow. So good its silly. Cherish every sip.

Don't go in thinking this is a sour or anything - this is a combination of a strong lager with a raspberry liqueur first and foremost. And yet, there's a candied flavor and grassy, rustic nature that makes this really interesting in the long run. It's definitely sweet, but it has these funky aromas and juicy character found in doppelbocks and sweetened Lambics that makes it unlike anything I've had. Definitely an alcoholic monster, though, so watch how you handle it. Absolutely worth a try.","magictacosinus","Apr 29, 2013"

This all blends to make a highly drinkable brew given that abv. Honestly, through and through this is not very complex swill, but it remains true to what is advertised, just on a bigger scale than you might have prepared for. With warmth the booze certainly blossoms, but otherwise is well hidden through the nose and the palate. This beer is undeniably huge, and takes courage to tackle, but if you’ve got the patience, and the friends to share with, it is a rare, true treat.","TheBrewo","Apr 18, 2013"

Its the Blueberry Eisbock that wins by a mile! No contest...just not even close. I really cant complain because I got the chance to try Raspberry Eisbock, but its just not near as good as the Blueberry Eisbock. I would like to try an older vintage of Raspberry Eisbock for a second perspective, but I was left a little dissapointed in comparison to Blueberry Eisbock. Raspberry Eisbock was a little one demensional in aroma and flavor profile compared to Blueberry. Raspberry Eisbock looked better and had better carbonation level than the Blueberry Eisbock, but the Blueberry Eisbock was wayyy smoother...not even close really. I think that age will benefit Raspberry Eisbock, but I dont have another bottle, so I probably wont get to test this theory. Age will help to even out the rough spots in the Raspberry Eisbock. Kuhnhenn Blueberry Eisbock is a much more elegant brew and sophisticated beer.","4DAloveofSTOUT","Mar 28, 2013"

The nose has a bit of dark chocolate, raspberry liqueur, dates, dried cherries, and very dark caramel. The flavor has bold, tart raspberry and cherry notes, leather, and cocoa powder. The sweetness up front is replaced with a dry tartness on the back end. Very rich and full bodied with a lasting finish. This one definitely expanded my thoughts about what beer can do.

Similarly to the aroma, there is still a surprising amount of juicy raspberry and other dark fruit notes. Faint tartness with some cranberry before being countered by hits of chocolate cake, caramel and toffee. Slightly syrupy but this doesn't hurt the mouthfeel much. A nice boozy warmth in the finish but the high ABV is excellently masked with only little heat. This beer is dangerously drinkable at this stage so 6.3oz is a perfect serving. Complex with a good amount of raspberry still in there. The perfect drink for after a huge holiday meal.","corby112","Dec 24, 2011"

Taste was a shocker for me. Not what I was expecting. I thought it would be sweet like in the smell. Instead it was overripe berry with a lot of salt. The saving grace was the noticeable raspberry taste that was left in the back of your throat. Very pleasant aftertaste. Alcohol is very well hidden in this brew. The beer went down very fast in all.

4.27,-2.7,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Raspberry Eisbock pours a deep fusion of amber and plum, with surprising clarity. A thin bone colored head briefly sits atop the beer, but quickly vanishes to nothing. The nose is entirely one note, but incredibly alluring.The beer smells like fresh raspberries soaked in a very small amount of brandy. The flavor doesn't add much, but nonetheless, the result works so well that I can't help but dig it. Those same brandy soaked raspberries come through from the start, and dominate most of the beer. Right when I think the flavor is going to be as one dimensional as the aroma though, a fantastic swirl of rich milk chocolate comes in to close things out. Imagine a liquified raspberry truffle, and you'll get a very good idea of what this beer tastes like. Had the chocolate showed up a little bit earlier in the flavor profile, this beer would be just about perfect, but it comes in just a tad late to really nail it. The body is surprisingly middling for such a high ABV beer, but it works (in conjunction with the mildly subdued carbonation) to prevent the beer from presenting as cloying in any way. Raspberry Eisbock wasn't quite as impressive as Kuhnhenn's other hyped beer (Bourbon Barrel 4th Dementia), but still showed why it's deserving of a spot on BA's Top 100 beers.","axeman9182","Apr 30, 2011"

Now were this brew starts to shine is the aroma chocolate raspberry tart was the first word I hear to describe it, and it stuck in my head.

Certainly unique. Raspberry jam soaked in sherry with a honey cookie kind of aroma. Lots of sweetness in this one. The taste is a bit less sweet than the aroma. Tart raspberries to begin with the sweetness in the finish. Mostly tart fruit in this one and just bit of caramel flavor in the finish with the raspberry sweetness.

Orange-brown muddy river inside the glass, fully opaque yellowed rims, curiously you can see the carbonation steadily rises to the surface where it breaks into nothing. The nose is heady stuff, a dessert of raspberry preserves, melted dark chocolate, caramel, orange infusion, coconut flakes, texturally full and expansive while actually nowhere sweet enough to annoy, mild whiskey notes but no burn. Medium-bodied, the carbonation works hard to lift the flavors off the tongue while here adds an underlying sourness which restrains more of the sugary side. The raspberry fresh and natural with supplementary sour cherry accents. The German chocolate cake element marches on, caramel and coconut with a cream cheese brush as well. A touch grainy as it warms. The orange, lemon citrus brings bite to the finish, helps refresh palate for the next sip. More muscular than many Belgian framboise lambics, which boosts drinkability.

4.54,3.4,4,5,4.5,5,4,"A vigorous pour produces a short lived and spotty cream/light mocha colored head that quickly fades to a ring of bubbles with quickly fading lacing. Liquid is a murky thick, turbid ruby brown. Not exceptional, but about what you'd expect for this style. Aroma is amazingly rich, complex and... decadent (I guess that works here). Smells unlike any other beer I've tried, alternating abundant malty chocolate, toffee and caramel notes, with earthy and seedy, slightly tart raspberry. Silky smooth thick bodied with a perfect amount of light carbonation and a ridiculously long lasting, balanced tart and sweet aftertaste. Flavor is an overwhelming menagerie of chocolate, toffee, brown sugar, vanilla, tart raspberry, earthy raspberry seeds, lemon, rum like alcohol, figs, raisins, sour fruits, etc. There is a slight medicinal quality to the flavor that keeps me from giving the flavor a perfect 5 (but that's a result of my own issues with Robitussin growing up, haha).

The aroma is musty with an underlying damp mold quality. Also raspberries, of course, caramel, and some alcohol. The age shows in the aroma and makes me worry 3 years has not been kind to this little guy. Tastes much more tart than the smell suggested. Raspberries, caramel, chocolate, and bitter citrus rind. It's like raspberry cheesecake with caramel drizzle and maybe some chocolate in the form of an oreo cookie crust. Like one of my buddies said, not a dessert beer but dessert itself. This would be hugely satisfying just by itself after a great meal, forget about pairing it. It's real syrupy and lightly carbonated.

The base malts in this remind me somewhat of a lighter base version of the darklord. Taste is what I expected. Flavors of chocolate raspberries, caramel, and dark chocolate come together perfectly. Overall this is what a fruit beer should be. Next time I'm in Michigan I am going to have to stop by the brewery to check out what else they have.","fiver29","Aug 21, 2009"

Smell was booze dominated, with faint (real) raspberries in the background. Taste was similar, very booze dominated with some raspberry, caramel, and chocolate. Thick and sweet, this would probably benefit with a few more years under its belt to calm down the alcohol some more. It was a vintage 2007, but based on my small bottle I would probably let the next one have at least 4 years under its belt before I cracked it open.

Full bodied and sticky. Very drinkable, though I don't think I would want more than just this little bottle at a time. The finish is just a little bit fading sour fruit.

Closer to the beverage the aromas are more complex..dark fruit, maple syrup and bread dough. A real sipper, the 13.5% ABV is integrated well into the mouth, followed by a warming sensation on the way down. The mouth is interesting also...like plowing through an unfiltered fruit drink with tiny bits of berries throughout. Lightly carbonated and tangy the mouth feel is medium-full bodied. The experience lingers lightly for a good long while. The taste is wonderful, as fruity raspberry and fig... and as bready as the nose. Really enjoying this one.","jjayjaye","Apr 02, 2009"

4.17,-5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"2007 vintage, poured from a 6oz bottle. It pours a dark brown with reddish highlights, and a light layer of foam on top that fades to the center. Smell is of chocolate covered raspberries. Rich and sweet. Taste follows suit, with an intense raspberry flavor dominating, mixed with some chocolate, caramel, and sugary sweetness. This is definitely a dessert drink. Mouthfeel is thick and rich, almost no carbonation whatsoever. As I'm not a huge fan of raspberry, this brew doesn't do a lot for me, but I do have to say it's incredibly well done for a raspberry brew. It's definitely a sipper, and would be a fitting dessert. It's almost drinks like a port would. Quite enjoyable overall.","YonderWanderer","Apr 09, 2008"
4.15,-5.5,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a minimal beige head over clear burgundy brew. What head there was quickly fades into a swirly, uneven layer of small bubbles, and lacing is bubbly and prevalent, considering the head or lack thereof, although it should be noted that the style and abv isn't particularly conducive to head. Aroma is earthy raspberries and chocolate over alcohol. Flavor is incredible, it really does taste like raspberry chocolate sauce, without being cloying at all. Alcohol is well-hidden. Mouthfeel and drinkability are incredible for what the brew is. Amazing. Almost makes one wonder if with a little reduction this would make a great dessert sauce. But experimenting with such an exemplary brew would almost be heresy...","ppoitras","Mar 31, 2008"

Head stays put for the duration and becomes creamier, which is nice. Smells of thick raspberries, notes of chocolate, alcohol obvious but not off-putting. Huge sour raspberry taste, but offset by an equally huge chocolate malt presence that balances it perfectly. Alcohol lends a touch of bitterness to the raspberry. Finish is a nice bitter chocolate with hints of fruit. Thick and sticky, full bodied and decadent. Drinks great, though becomes slightly cloying towards the end of it. I think the bottle size is appropriate, even for splitting between two people.","aforbes10","Mar 31, 2008"

I could sit here and smell this beauty forever, but that's not what beer is for ;) Flavor is raspberries and creamy caramel, go figure. A very nice blueberry sweetness compliments perfectly. Maple and chocolate syrup combine for even more amazing tastes. The alcohol stings slightly as it flows down the throat, but it's 11.9% people, what did you expect?

Tones of chocolate raspberry bon bons, fresh soft toffee and maple poured over Belgian waffles, wow this is amazing. Now to taste. Enters the mouth rich and warming with bold balance of raspberry and coco. An even toffee like richness carries the body of this beer throughout the palate. This beer is like eating the well made masterpiece of a skilled chocolatier. The alchol is listed at 13.5% but it is hard to believe based on how well it is hidden.

Not so much that it ruins the experience, but enough to notice. I kind of take it like it is one step below being too much. If it was pushed any further, it wouldn't work.

Buttery caramel, fresh baked cake like aroma, and chocolate as well as a good amt of soy sauce and hints of leather. Taste follows with a nice chocolate covered raspberry flavor before the soy sauced oxidized flavors interrupt. Hints of leather and wood in the flavor as well. Finish is nice and slightly drying with a raspberry flavor that verges on being tart. Fairly light medium body for what one might expect, some tingle on the tongue up front with a nice woody dryness in the finish and hints of alcohol. The oxidation is starting to overpower other flavors in this nice sipper of a beer, but it is still drinking fairly well, although I wouldn't recommend ageing any further.

I usually have a hard time with beers brewed with fruit, but this is well done and dosen't give me heartburn, which helps. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, sticky as hell.

Not being a big fan of tootsie rolls, I love good chocolate, but dont classify tootsie roll as such.

Impressive, though. Smells of brandy-soaked raspberries and chocolate with a hint of carmelized sugar. Thick and syrupy on the tongue - this is a beer that slides rather than washes down. Tastes like it smells, but not over the top on the raspberries. Very balanced and not hot with alcohol. My first thought is how amazing this eisbock would taste drizzled over pancakes. Its sweet molasses, chocolate and fruit flavors would be a show-stopper. Overall, a very unique, well-crafted and tasty dessert beer/apertif.

Raspberry is first to greet my tongue, it's quickly followed by flavors of port, chocolate dipped dark fruit, and very sweet caramel.

Imagine combining chocolate covered cherries, a tootsie pop and beer. It's really remarkable. Mouthfeel is oily, rather heavy and warming. Drinkability is ok, but it's not 'beer-drinkable.'

Strong and sweet with a hint of dark fruit to the nose also. The taste is quite delectable, a brilliant mix of caramel, raisin and chocolate malt flavors followed by a lingering tangy fruit spice. Nice dryness, and a solid finish which actually doesn't seem that strong in alcohol. Medium body with a slight viscosity. Soft tingly carbonation. Somewhat a sipper, but only for the amazing richness of flavors. It's very enjoyable, especially for a style I am not that fond of.

I truly wish I could drink this all the time, each time spending forever figuring out exactly what these fleeting tastes I am experiencing are.

I also get a faint scent of nuts. With a lighter body than I was expecting, the taste is quite unique. I feel like I just bit into a slice of chocolate cake topped with raspberry ganache.

Scraping off the wax was rather easy with a knife. The beer came out dark red in color, with very fizzy carbonation head like a soda pop. The smell was a blend of chocolate and raspberry, and reminded me very much of gourmet dark chocolate truffles that I sample around Christmas. Taste was very much like reminiscent of those truffles as well, with melted dark chocolate blended with raspberry syrup. Rum, maple syrup, and vanilla, and coffee were some of the other flavors that came to mind while sipping the beer. Alcohol was medicinal, and hops herbal in nature. Aftertaste was peppery sharp, and prevented the beer from getting too sweet. Smooth and slick mouthfeel also advanced the impression of richness. A very unique beer that has little to do with flavors typically associated with other beers, and is closer in flavor profile to a pudding or a cake. Viva le difference!","rajendra82","Jan 27, 2006"

The beer is a clear, ruby-chestnut colour, a nice combination of red and brown hues. It even looks thick in the glass and there's a bit of sediment at the bottom of the bottle. It smells and tastes exactly like a fruit-centered chocolate. Chocolate and toffee combine masterfully with the tart raspberry character. Quite thick and completely coats the palate. Fruit and toffee all the way. The acidity level provides enough tartness to balance out the sweetness and there seems to be a complete lack of hop bitterness or flavour. Caramel is more evident towards the end. It also has a lingering finish with the tartness coming forward, but the sweet toffee never disappears. Just a bit of alcohol warmth in the finish.

Smells like a fresh raspberry harvest, as if you were stomping around in a vat of raspberries and the aroma were permeating your senses. Tastes like a red velvet raspberry cake with chocolate truffles, or perhaps like one of those Jacques Torres chocolates filled with raspberry puree. In fact, put this inside of chocolates, and they'd sell like hotcakes, I bet. I found the taste to be a bit too much like a raspberry cordial, and not enough like a beer, but unique nonetheless. The mouthfeel is quite remarkable -- "pillowy" is the first word that came to mind. Just so soft in the mouth, almost makes you think you're eating a piece of cake. An after-dinner sipper to be sure, not drinkable by any means. If you had any more than the small bottle of this at a sitting, I predict a big headache for you.

The raspberries are a big part of the taste, but not overpowering. There is an initial mild sweetness, that is followed by somewhat sour aftertaste. There is also a bit of a thickness and silkiness to the palate. The are also flavors of caramel and toffee in the mix. Absolutely no taste of alcohol, which is suprising given the 18% ABV.

Funky yeast notes emanate in the form of an hairspray concentrate. Welcoming chocolate and vegetal tones wouldnt fit together in any other beer, but the acid character, the woody nature and the truffle richness appear like they all came from the same tree. Plenty of raspberries underlying flavors, but the alcohol is the big loser, nowhere to be seen which is most impressive. Slight oiliness on the palate, medium bodied, moderately carbonated. Strong presence in mouth, less fruity, possibly less acid than expected, a nice acetic backbone remains subtle, woody, though you have the impression that the tartness grows from sip to sip.

This is one highly concentrated beer. The taste is very good and incorporates plums, raisins, caramel, and obviously fruit. There is a tartness to it that isn't overwhelming, nor is too light.

Taste of dominant chocolate, caramel malt, some earthiness, lots of tart raspberries, and roasted java, with a touch of alcohol in the finish. Thanks Mike!","egajdzis","Aug 05, 2005"

4.75,8.2,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Definitely a special occasion beer, and after-dinner dessert brew, only for revelling and toasting, something to mellow the mood and usher in an unheard of feeling among all in company...not an any-old-day beer, by any means.","feloniousmonk","Jun 11, 2005"
3.95,-10,4,4,4,4.5,3.5,"500 ml bottle shared with feloniousmonk on 6/4/05. Thanks to a different BA (who has asked to remain anonymous) for picking this one up for me. Pours a thin light-tan head that quickly fades, like a carbonation released from a soda. The beer itself is copper orange and is nearly clear. Smells like raspberry sorbet or ice-cream. Smells alot like a raspberry Lifesavers Creamsaver. There's a metallic hint in the berry and a mild refined alcohol. In short, this smells like a fine liquor...brandy. The taste starts wet sweet with some gentle cream flavor. The middle rises to a tart fruity, not a clear raspberry, definitely berry and fruity. Fruit flavors I get are tangerine, raspberry, white grapes, cherry, pumpkin, and strawberry. These flavors persist a long time, just slowly fading away as the aftertaste. A mild alcohol burn comes in with the fruits is disapates with almost a flat grassy blah characteristic. Although the alcohol is not strong in the flavor, this beer definitely has belly warming qualities. Add to this a super-thick mouthfeel and mild carbonation. This is unique beer...I've never had anything like this before, but not one I'll ever seek out again. I was disappointed at the lack of that caramelly bock malty character. I would recommend serving this beer with an vanilla-based ice cream deseert.","mentor","Jun 08, 2005"
4.27,-2.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability: This is a good after dinner drink. It's very sweet making it very much like port. I have to say that the flavor does seem to be one-dimensional. It's not complex. It's good, but not complex. It tastes like raspberries and is just what you would expect.","BrewMaster","Jun 07, 2005"
4.74,8,3.5,4.5,5,4.5,5," Absolutely an amazing beer. I really had my doubts about this one. The name itself almost sounds like something that would be hard to deliver. Really quite the stellar effort. Get some,horde some-and SEND ME MORE!!! Thanks to eyedrinkale for the sample.","lackenhauser","Jun 05, 2005"
5,13.9,5,5,5,5,5,"I have wanted to try this for as long as I can remember. Having a small sample when I was at the brewery a few months ago really made me anticipate its release with super high expectations. After finally getting some 6.3 oz bottles and opening them, I knew at first sniff this would exceed my expectations. Opaque reddish brown with an inch of light tan head that left scatterings of lace around the glass. Aroma packs quite a punch with sweet molasses and tons of raspberry goodness that is definitely the real deal not artificial. Alcohol is there but is not noticeable over the huge fruit scents. Light sweetness and burnt sugar notes were there as well. The taste was even more impressive than the aroma, with a huge raspberry flavor that blended well with the sweet caramel and light chocolate notes. The alcohol is there and is warming as hell but never interferes with the flavor. Some other light fruit notes I think were peaking through as well other subtleties that I couldnt recognize. Simply amazing stuff. Mouthfeel was insanely thick and syrupy that just coated your tongue with even the most minute sip. Drinkability? I could sip a on a growler of this all day if I ever got the chance. Well worth the price of admission here, though I wish it was cheaper so I could get more. 750s next time please.","meathookjones","Jun 03, 2005"

If so, then it was my pleasure to consume the last of the humble, label-less bottles from '04. Thank you TikkiGodxxx for a remarkable experience.","BuckeyeNation","May 04, 2005"
4.82,9.8,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Mouthfeel is big and has a syrupy consistency to it. Goes down damn smooth for such a big brew with nice small bubbly carbonation. Very nice! This is an extremely drinkable brew for the alcohol content. Simply an awesome expertly crafted eisbock / fruit beer. I hope I will get a chance to try this one again some day.","orbitalr0x","Mar 18, 2005"
4.87,10.9,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"Wow. I don't know what I did to deserve trying this beer, but thanks to marburg and orbitalr0x for the pleasure of trying it. The beer pours a dark murkey ever-so slightly rubied brown color with a complete lack of head. The nose is incredible. Dark fruity and chocolate tones ride below a very intense, but not fake raspberry. Wow. Intense. DAMN. The flavors are huge. Syrupy raspberry sweetness and tartness hit upfront, assaulting my tastebuds. This moves to a slight chocolate and fig, but the raspberry is so big, its harder to find the subtleties. The mouthfeel is huge and thick and syrupy. Wow. Overall, this beer is in a league of its own. For one, the alcohol is nowhere to be found in the flavor or the aroma. Its not even overly warming after drinking it. The flavors are big and lingering, leaving me craving the next sip. I have to pause between sips, but it keeps me craving more. This is an experience I will not forget. Everything about this beer is intense, minus the alcohol presence. Very, very good.","kmpitz2","Mar 18, 2005"

5,13.9,5,5,5,5,5,"This was the beer that I was definitely hoping to get my hands on in Michigan, and thanks to kindness beyond the call of duty from Brett and Eric Kuhnhenn, I was able to go back and split a bottle with my brother, and I was sure glad that I did. For this is truly a world-class beer...just sooo good, so thick and chocolatey and raspberry, and believe me somehow they meld together into such goodness. This may well truly have been my favorite beer in the world, and I would do anything to have this one again.","beergeek279","Sep 02, 2004"
4.77,8.7,4.5,5,5,4,4.5,"Oh yes, it made me smile. I consider myself quite lucky to have tried this lovely fruity brew.. It's a dark black coffee colour with a brownish head, smells wonderful- raspberries dominate, with coffee, chocolate, brown sugar even. Very sweet and roasty. The taste was excellent as well, again, lots of raspberry flavour swimming around in my mouth, fruity and quite tart actually, and a big roasty toasty undercurrent kind of helping the berries along around my tongue, through my teeth, and down my throat. This is also very thick, almost too thick, but it's not bad because of the tartness of the raspberries. It cuts it a little. Drinkability, yes. I'd love to have another. However, because of the thick sweetness I wouldn't want too many in one sitting... All in all a great beer.","erica","Apr 22, 2004"
4.87,10.9,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"this pours out like used motor oil (seriously), it settles to be a dark brown/black liquid with dark bloody edges and a deep, yet small, head of tan-brown foam. The aromas are simply out of this world, as they assault your senses right when the crown is popped off of the bottle. The aromas I get are: Raspberry syrup, chocolate (syrup?), espresso, deep roasted malts, doughy/bready malts, light light medicinal/herbal hops, and more! The taste is absolutely amazing. This stuff tastes like fresh raspberries were thrown into a vat of Cote D'or chocolate, and than blended into some weird sort of starbucks frappicino drink. Simply phenomenal, perhaps the best use of fruit that I have seen in a beer (traditional lambics aside). The mouthfeel is thick and syrup like, but this stuff goes down with ease. This would probably soothe a sore throat quite well. Perhaps they should be prescribing this stuff for the flu? Wow, definately a sipper and one to savor. An excellent winter brew, or nightcap for sure. I bet this would pair well with some cheesecake (or another rich dessert) and a cigar. Wow, this is truly some amazing stuff! 13.5%ABV but you would never reall know it!","francisweizen","Apr 20, 2004"
4.87,10.9,4.5,5,5,4,5,"Talk about a beer pouring like motor oil...Barely a skimming of a head is created from pour. But alas, the beer is 13.5% a/v, so not much was expected in this department. The beer is dark. Barely a ray of light penetrates to the other side. Dark crimson colored edging. The aroma is unbelievable. What concoction of sweet raspberry, brown sugar, malty goodness, bread pudding, rum, raisin...damn! One of the best smelling beers I've had the pleasure of sniffing. Upon tasting, I can hardly believe this beer has an octane rating of 13.5% a/v. If not careful, I could literally drain this beer in under 5 minutes. The mouthfeel is syrupy and lightly carbonated. Body, full. Flavor: Out of This World. It follows suit very nicely with the nose... sweet raspberry, deep malts, rum soaked raisins, dark brown sugar... whew. I'm speechless.","Bighuge","Mar 16, 2004"
4.72,7.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,4,"This is the first fruit beer that really wowed me. It is worth every bit of the hype that led up to my tasting it. On an evening full of great new beers this one stole the show. Dark and opaque with minimal head and a slightly red glow at the edges the beer looks quite imposing. The aroma is incredible. Dark chocolate and fresh rasberries smell so real if you closed your eyes you you would swear the dessert cart was rolled out as your coffee was being poured. The taste is every bit the equal of the aroma. Sweet without becoming cloying, a perfect balance of the chocolate and coffee bitterness and the sweetness of the rasberry and malt. Thick mouthfeel, but it is perfect for this beer. Very drinkable considering that everything about this beer is so rich. I was a bit surprised when I learned just how strong this beer is. Alcohol is very well hidden.","Sixpack595","Dec 10, 2003"
4.87,10.9,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"On the palate it was thick with delicate fizz and syrupy, chewy, melting bitter chocolate and berry preserves. Well-balanced with just enough sugar to support the weight of the flavors. Secondary images of glazed ham, charred molasses and sweet spice appear as well. Most comparable to Rodenbach's Alexander, only blackberry/raspberry flavored. One might also credibly draw comparisons between this and a Dashe Late Harvest Zin, a Turley, Ridge or Rosenblum field blend, or one of the ancient-vines Grenache/Shirazes from Aussie wineries such as Torbreck or Clarendon Hills. Quite an accomplishment!","putnam","Nov 02, 2003"
