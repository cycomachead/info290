Nobody appreciates a beer that's only 4.8% ABV anymore.  It's not "extreme" enough.  Phooey.  This is a beautiful beer.  I'll have another please.  And then maybe another after that.","Trombone69","Mar 27, 2015"
3.76,2.7,3.5,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"I enjoyed this one overall. It poured a straw yellow. The aroma was floral and almost soapy. Nice clean, smooth and refreshing taste and feel. Not the most flavorful beer, but something that would hit the spot for wetting the palate, a hot summer day and/or session brew. I did not like it as much as reissdorf kolsch, but will still get it again.","Gajo74","Mar 26, 2015"

Poured with a fizzy bright, white foam with low retentioin that quickly dissipated. Light to medium body with crisp, medium carbonation through the middle and a slight puckering sensation near the finish. Pilsner malt flavor is dominant with light noble hop bitterness near the finish that provides a pleasant balance. Crisp dry finish with light pilsner and bready aftertaste.

Nothing bad, but nothing exceptional. If you haven't had Kolsch before, I'd recommend this one, but it's a bit lackluster for a more dedicated craft enthusiast.","TheHammer","Nov 20, 2014"

APPEARANCE: pale, straw-colored body that actively bubbles; sudsy white head simmers but holds at a half-finger; spotty clouds of lacing... AROMA: soft, fruity esters ease the nostrils; some apple, pear and floral scents all suggest a lightly hopped brew.. PALATE: wondrously soft (!), reasonably effervescent mouthfeel; leaves a slightly palatable aftertaste of malt; mega-drinkable... TASTE: slight biscuit is earliest impression; next up, bubblegum and aromatic lilac or currants; biscuit becomes more prominent as the glass drains ...OVERALL: refreshment is the key word here,, as this kolsch slams like a fruity pilsner, with enough bitterness to suggest hopping and enough weight to suggest malt...a nice pairing with a late summer night and its sweltering humidity--a wonderful combination of drinkability and complexity...","dacrza1","Sep 04, 2014"

Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. The first smell that is honestly overpowering is skunk and this isn't even a green bottle so that is weird. Eventually this fades away and I get some malt/grain, grass/hay, and some light fruity aromas. Taste is much the same (thankfully no skunk flavors) and is fairly sweet. There is a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.

This is not hugely different from Bavarian lagers, with the exception of a slight fruitiness, maybe apple or grape, I can't even say. It's brewed like an ale, then lagered, from what I'm reading. So there are slight differences between Kölsch and lager, which makes it a nice drinking experience. This is the kind of light, dry, grainy malt and hop combination that has me saying, "Hey, I like this. Let me have another." Session material here. Reissdorf is next. If your pour straight down the center, you'll get a good head and nice aroma.","angusdegraosta","Dec 25, 2011"

Don't compare to an American ale or Belgian beer loaded with all sorts of bold flavors. For fans of German Pils.

It pours a clear, pale golden straw with a head of thick white froth. The nose is composed of hoppy pine, florals, grapefruit, and what seems like a very subtle caramel way the hell in the back. The taste is somewhat similar, led by the familiar florals, though the fruitiness is replaced by a watered-down bit o' white grape. What is most disappointing is a clear influx of chalk, bringing down what would have been a nice citrus-y flavor. The body is quite light, with a lightly moderate carbonation and refreshing watery feel.

I perceive the lager yeast much more than the ale yeast in this one: in a blind tasting I would not have been able to pick it out as a kolsch, but then again I have little experience with the style.

Overall drinkability this would get boring if it were your only beer option but it's a nice mix up from the typical American micro brew.","WVbeergeek","May 11, 2008"

I'm watching TV through it as I consider this. Steady, quick rising carbonation. A head that falls a little short. Smell is just uneventful. Not much going on here. Grains, not so clean though. Kind of an ashy skunky smell that reminds me of Stella or something. Sweet malt and light hop presence. Taste is much of the same. Near overwhelming sweetness up front, almost puckering. Very crisp feel, kind of snappy on the tongue. Gets more dry from what I feel to be a very bready finish, almost absorbing on the tongue. It's decent. Funny how a couple of the American versions I've tried seem much more interesting and comlex while this is pretty bland. This sixer wasn't cheap, either.","ncvbc","Apr 16, 2008"

The head dies quick and there is minimal carbonation. Aroma is of skunky type hops with a little grain in the background, and that's about it here. Very clean tasting. The carbonation, soft mouthfeel and german hops all meld together to make a very refreshing brew. GReat mouthfeel and drinkability.","avylover","Dec 29, 2004"

3.97,8.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a pale yellow color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is clean and crisp with a pale malts and a fruity yeast scent. The taste is good. It has a smooth pale malt flavor that goes down easy with a slight bitterness and a clean finish. There is a bit of fruitiness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a damn fine Kolsch. It holds true to style and drinks brilliantly.","WesWes","Oct 03, 2004"
4.52,23.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Gaffel Kolsch comes right out of the town of Koln (which guarantees its authenticity); and also happens to be one of the best examples available in the U.S. right now. It pours a crystal clear yellow-gold body beneath a massive head of fluffy bright-white foam that slowly receeds to a thin collar and whispy surface covering. Some initial splashes of lace are left at the start of the glass, but there's not much beyond that. Still, it's quite attractive. The nose delivers a beautiful combination of grainy malt and herbal, floral, and spicy hops as well as a splash of yeasty fruitiness. The body is decidedly medium and it's very fine, moderate carbonation lends a gentle zest to the tongue. The flavor delivers pretty much exactly what the nose promises with a beautifully balanced symphony of very lightly sweet but distinctly grainy malt woven throughout with threads of floral, spicy and herbal hops. A solid bitterness balances it superbly; and it finishes with a swirl of hop flavor and a drying bitterness that leaves you ready for another sip. It's an incredibly drinkable beer that balances a "lighter" quality with a good amount of complexity; and when teamed with the fact that it has a relatively subdued alcohol content of 4.8%, it's a most impressive session ale. One of the best! And if you want to understand what the Kolsch style is all about, this is the one to try!","NeroFiddled","Aug 26, 2004"
3.88,6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Interesting beer. Clear and golden, the white head left quickly. Aroma is low, and almost apple cidery-like. Taste comes with several components: intially you get a crisp, German pils like taste. What follows next is more medium mouthfeel, again, apples being the predominant taste. The beer finishes with a traditional malty/breadyness. Easy to drink, would make a good session beer.","PatandDavid","Aug 23, 2004"
4.1,12,4,4,4,4,4.5,"4,8%. Clear pale straw colored with white fluffy head that dies down to a thin layer of foam in a couple minutes. Bready and spicy with a yeasty nose. Bottlecap opened with a pop, indicating good carbonation which gives it a clean and crisp taste, yet maintaining a light feel. Once you have a couple of sips, it gets a bit astringent in the finish, like hops but not. Earthy. Very light and easily drinkable. I hate to cliche it as a lawnmower beer, but it is one and it's good one.","crookedhalo","Aug 05, 2004"

3.29,-10.1,4.5,3,3,4,3.5,"Pours a brilliantly clear pale straw color. It is topped by a fluffy off-white head that is kept afloat by a medium level of carbonation. Spicy aroma with grainy malt notes, and perhaps a hint of lemon. Nice clean profile, and finishes with a bit more biting bitterness than I was expecting. Light and refreshing, and is spot on for a Kolsch. Not really my cup of tea though, just a bit too simple and clean to hold my interest for long.","Gueuzedude","Beers"
3.46,-5.5,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Yet another authentic Kölsch makes its way to America. This is almost straw-colored and pours with a head that falls flat. The aroma is neutral to slightly malty; none of the minerally aroma of Reissdorf is present. A very light and delicate ale which makes it very appropriate for summer. As the beer warms up I catch a slight toasted, yet juicy malt flavor. The finish is dry and bitter enough for the style. Overall, a nice light ale for summer quaffing, but not as complex as other examples.","marcobrau","0"
3.6,-1.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured out a clear yellow/gold color with some nice carbonation visible, also stayed with you for a while. Smell consisted of light hops, a little musty at times as well, and some grassy notes. Taste was alright. Bready, malty at times, and some hops show their muscle as well in this beer. Hops have a little bite to them at the end which almost makes you think this is a German Pils, but not quite so. It's crisp and somewhat clean as well. This could make for an ideal session beer.","necoadam","Jul 19, 2004"
3.38,-7.7,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured a light golden color with a lot of carbonation, forming a large head. There was little aroma except for a slightly grainy malt smell. The taste is a slightly hoppy, malty taste that tastes very different but okay.The mouthfeel is bubbly and clean. For my first try of this style, it wasn't bad. Not great, but okay.","rdrummer","Jul 08, 2004"
3.38,-7.7,3.5,3,3,3.5,4.5,"I had this on tap at Cogans Instant Art Bar in Norfolk Virginia. Presented in a tulip glass this beer was a light golden color with a good-sized white head. The head stuck around for a while and left a decent lacing as this was consumed. The aroma was focused around grains with a slight citrus lemon scent and a mild spice as well. The Flavor was bready with mild earthy hop notes. A clean crisp taste that is refreshing is what you got here. Mouthfeel was light with good carbonation and this is very drinkable. Overall a decent beer that would be ideal for warm weather.","meathookjones","Jul 07, 2004"
3.8,3.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours with a fluffy, billowing white head over clear light golden yellow liquid. Grassy lightly malty nose with some delicate hop presence. Light bodied maltiness and crisp and somewhat sharp hoppiness...that's about all there is as far as taste components. Finishes light, spritzy and dry. A very good hot weather beater due to it's low alcohol/lightness of body. Well done.","beerluvr","May 25, 2004"

3.88,6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Ultra pale and yellowy gold in color. Looks very clean and clear and has a soft carbonation. The aroma yields some lemony sourness and crisp and grassy grains. Also has a touch of stale breadiness. The taste is dry and pretty clean. Light in body but has some character to it. Finishes light and crisp with a pleasant sour tang. This is an easy drinking, light and golden German Ale. Not much bad to say about this beer. Just nice overall.","pezoids","Mar 23, 2004"
4.06,10.9,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Bright golden in color with brilliant, foamy, white head that leaves a creamy layer after the head drops. The nose is a nice mix of pale, dry malt and grassy hops that are ever-so-slightly floral. Hop bitterness is mainly right up front followed by a clean dry breadiness. A very light fruitiness comes out on the otherwise dry finish. Nearly perfect carbonation and body for the style. Great mouth feel!","yen157","Mar 21, 2004"
4.1,12,4,4,4,4,4.5,"It pours a very clear pale straw color with a good white head. The aroma is slightly fruity. The body id firm, but light with some nuttiness to it. It finishes crisp and dry with flowery hop tastes. A nice refreshing beer that I could drink all day long.","ark57","Feb 21, 2004"

2.67,-27,2,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,"It has an appearance that greatly resembles Miller High Life. The head quickly fizzles away, not a good Kölsch characteristic. Though no adjucts are used one cant help from expecting an on-rush of corn and sugar like flavors at first sip. Surprisngly that doesnt happen. In fact, not much happens to your tongue. Its flavorless except for a light hop note. As it's not very flavorful it gets boring fast. A few words of advice--If you are in Köln and see a sign for Gaffel, move on, theres alot better out there.","allboutbierge","Aug 04, 2002"
4.1,12,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Gaffel is as fine an example of the Kölch style around. By all appearances it looks to be a thin and weak beer, but it has a surprisingly ample body and is fantastically gulpable. The hoppy aroma dissipates rapidly so catch it early. There's an abundance of hops which balance nicely with the malt about halfway through the glass. Nice white head doesn't last too long (could have been that I drank it from a pint glass instead of something like a Pilsner glass).","BeerResearcher","Jun 13, 2002"

And what better choice than the local Kölsch bier? A lovely, crisp, light, refreshing treat it was. I love the dedicated glassware for serving beer in many places in Europe. It really adds to the experience. Crystal clear straw color, light biscuity malt, mildly spicey hop aroma and flavor. The perfect brew to accompany a meal, plenty good enough to stand on its own.","John","0"
