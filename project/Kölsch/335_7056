Aromas of lemon, pear, herbal, floral, cracker, bread, grass, earth, and light pepper. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good strength; spot on for a kolsch. Taste of lemon, grass, pear, pepper, herbal, biscuit, floral, earth, and light toast. Lingering notes of light fruits, grass, herbal, biscuit, earth, and light pepper on the finish for a short bit. Great flavor balance and good complexity; with a nice amount of flavor for being under 5%. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming noticed at all. Overall this is an excellent kolsch! Nice amount of flavor and great balance; extremely smooth and easy to drink as expected. Very well done, and spot on to style. Great choice for a session beer, plus it is year round.","superspak","Aug 04, 2012"

3.9,9.2,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer, it was a nice and unique Kolsch, I don't have a ton of experience with this style so I really don't know how true to the style this beer is but the bottom line is that that beer was light but still had a good amount of flavor to it that made for a pretty nice beer to drink with a meal. This beer had great drinkability, it was very smooth and seems like this would be a nice refreshing beer to have on a hot summer day, this could make for a good session beer and I wouldn't rule out taking out a six pack throughout the day. What I liked most about this beer was that is was smooth and light but it still had a good amount of nice flavors going on that I really enjoyed, and the combination of biscuit malts, hay, and grassy hops really worked well in the flavor of this beer. There wasn't really anything that I didn't like about this beer, it could have had better head retention but that isn't that big of a deal and it doesn't warrant a drop in points. I would for sure buy this beer again, especially in the summer, it would go nice along with Oberon for a good refreshing beer to quench my thirst and cool me down in the summer. I recommend this beer for someone looking for a light beer that still retains a good amount of flavor and if Kolsch's are your thing then this beer should hit the spot. This beer was just as good as I remembered it, I tend to overlook this style when there are so many other interesting styles on the shelf but I think I should give this style more attention, it is simple, clean, light, and great tasting. New Holland did a great job with this beer and I see why this is one of their main beers, you don't have to have in your face flavors to be a great beer and this beer does a great job in proving that.","StoutHunter","Jan 02, 2012"

Bready with a little saltiness too but not like a pretzel, maybe peppery at times, then a hard caramel candy sweetness breezes through, no real presence of citrus nor fruit, light apricot or pear perhaps, it's not that it's absent in your nostrils, more that it's "not there." Medium-bodied, smooth and evenly balanced, no bumps in the road. But this could be attributable to the cleanliness of the hops, no bite nor grass, yeast or citric verve. The carbonation is consistent, more prickle than foam, lends itself to an airy feel. Rye bread comes through nicely.

The aroma is slightly grainy, with fruity esters giving away notes of ripe apples and sweet berries. Just a hint of floral hops comes through in the tail of the aroma. The flavor is just as straight forward as the nose. A slight grainy appeal comes through up front with strawberries (weird I know) and apples, a bit of grass and just a wee bit of yeasty biscuits.

It smells nice an clean, slightest bit of mixed spices: coriander, heather and cinnamon are the most apparent, then comes the grainy bready goodness. Not really any hop character from what I can tell, though this changes slightly after the first few sips. Beer opens fresh and clean with a crisp, pale malt edging its way across my pallet, then the beer begins to open up, a nice complexity begins to develop. Noble hop bitterness tickles the tongue ever so slightly and leaves a strong vinious finsish that lasts until the next sip of beer washes it gently away. I think that this beer could be a little more filled out, has a bit of buttery apple taste that I could do without, but otherwise is a very drinkable beer, not to mention tasty, and could be enjoyed at any time of the year, not just in summer or on thanksgiving as it happens to be today.","bluemoonswoon","Oct 22, 2008"

Six inches of rocky off-white head climb my glass and streak the sides with broken panes of lace. Aroma is an almost wrenching waft of sickly sour malt and aged grains. Hay and lemons left in the bottom of corona bottles are elicted. On the tongue, a surprising whack of heavy sweetness and certain sourness, but staying within the lager spectrum. I have to give them points for providing flavor in a beer this shade and style. Honestly, this is reminiscent of a Berliner Weisse, somehow. The Sour Patch kid tang draws a breath of lemon and light grain. There are no infected tones, or off-flavors. Just a potent sweet-sour attack. Hops are too laid back, this should have a gentle hopping bite to balance. All thats left on my tongue is a distant green apple skin. Okay, in some level of retrospect, theres definately some errant Brett in here.","CharlesDarwin","Sep 20, 2006"

The head resembled more of something you'd see from a ginger ale float. This was from a sampler pack but every one of the Full Circle's poured this way. Having this massive foamy head of course yielded some unbelievable lacing (eventually). There was lots of carbonation also, so maybe there was too much which caused the excessive head. Anyways, the color was a medium yellow color and just a tad cloudy. Aroma of wet wood, light grassy hops, yeast and that common pilsener smell. Taste was dominantly hoppy with sweet malts coming through half way and ending with a bitter aftertaste that lingers and somewhat floral. Mouthfeel was as you could guess foamy.

Soft and flowery with a touch of honey. A honey flavored sweet and clean malt flavor carries throughout and is, at times, over-run with a mild hop bitter. I get some canteloupe (actually, I think it's called muskmelon...you know, the melon with orange flesh). The hops are a bit rough at times with some metalic hints in the aftertaste. An interesting play with the mild and fine carbonation that forms on the tongue and the light body. Some lacing has stuck to the side of the glass and a noticable layer of pristine fine head remains.

3.95,10.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"New Holland's Full Circle Single Malt Beer (is it an ale or a lager?) appears to be a moderate to low-gravity golden lager (ale?) with a decent splash of leafy and floral hops thrown in for ballast. Its clear golden body and thin white head are not particularly distinguishable from any American lager or European pilsner; nor is its aroma. It offers a generic "beer" aroma with a clean combination of grainy malt and sublime hops - no yeasty esters are found. It's crisp in the mouth with a light bordering on medium body and fine-bubbled, median carbonation. The flavor reveals that there IS some malt present, and apparently little to no adjunct. And hops are represented as well. Delicately spicy and mildly leafy/herbal in taste, the hops balance the malt exquisitely; and even replicate the flavor of some very decent European pilsners. I'm not sure why they went with the "single malt" branding, because it seems to be coinfusing. This is a very well done European-style beer. It's really well balanced with a good malt character and solid hop backbone. And again, New Holland delivers an excellent session beer!","NeroFiddled","Aug 08, 2004"

4.13,15.7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Thanks to trbeer for the sample. Well, certainly not one that lacks carbonation...took several pours to pour into the pint glass. Still, a good quality pilsner, comparable to Penn, and one that I'd have again.","beergeek279","Feb 18, 2004"

4.22,18.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"This brewery had irritated me in the paste with some pretty cocky labels. Some of their beers live up to their labels but others don't. This one lives up to billing. I have yet to have a Pilsener style beer that has near the depth of this one. It has the spicy hoppiness that Victory's Prima Pils does, but it really has a much better maltiness to it. I highly recommend.","Jables","Feb 08, 2004"

3.95,10.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured blond with a long lasting white head. Nice spicy noble hop aroma and slightly sweet husky malts. Crisp, bitter beginning, well-rounded middle as the "malt" kicks in, falls a little thin at the end. Overall, though, it remeinded me of why I sought after Saaz-type beers before the "doulbe-this" and "extreme-that"s started hitting the shelf.","pbrian","Aug 09, 2003"

2.18,-38.9,3,2.5,2,2,2,"This is heralded as a single malt beer like that's something special. It sounded like a novel idea. But now I know why more breweries don't do this. This beer was flat out not that good. Very simple taste with a light body. Malt is too weak but so are the hops and they're not that good either. Finsihes with an oily sickness. Slightly better than macro lagers, but only slightly.","granger10","Feb 25, 2003"
3.38,-5.3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Full Circle: A single malt beer. Apparently they used one single malt: Busy SOB (snort). Anyhow, a hazy golden color, under a white head that turns to skim fairly quickly. Sticky lace. Fruity/hop flavor, fruits first, hop later. Considerable hop profile in this beer, actually more than I had anticipated. Several sips do not overturn my initial taste. Oily, slick hop aftertaste. Hop heads, buy it.","jackndan","Nov 10, 2002"
4.05,13.4,4,4,4,4.5,4,"01-23-05 (re-review): This time it pours out to a slightly hazy light golden, forming a rocky white head with excellent retention and lacing. The aroma now doesn't have the kiwi note, and is absolutely true to the Pilsner style with freshly mown hay and delicate Saaz hops. The mouthfeel is fresh and crisp with a light body. The taste is soft with pale malts nicely balanced with Saaz bitterness and floral notes in the finish. Cleanly fermented. Much better than the previous Full Circle I've had.","Mitchster","Beers"
3.97,11.2,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Fruit salad bouquet of lemons, oranges, strawberries, and kiwi on a wafer thin slice of pound cake. Subdued malt spine works hard to keep up with a sharp spread of citric hops. A nice golden, effervescent session brew when the mood calls. Always a pleasure to taste a blonde with a little character.","inebrius","0"
