Very faint, weak smell- somewhat grassy. The flavor was a sweet, grassy malt, but seemed surfacey- it could use a little more depth. It was very light and easy to drink. A good beer for a summer barbecue. Wasn't bad at all.","boogieman","Jun 14, 2014"

The taste pretty much continues that theme: sweet, grainy malt, no hint of hops except in the faintest of senses. Yeast is lightly fruity. Bland and inoffensive is the best you can say.","allengarvin","Jun 05, 2014"

The aroma is of rye and some mixed hops, just like the bottle says. The taste is more complex actually. The taste of rye hits your tongue first then followed up with some grains & hops. Actually pretty smooth and goes down easy. No bitter aftertaste or or 'hoppy' bitter finish.","BeerWithMike","Mar 19, 2014"

Palate: smooth,, light and refreshing--appropriate to its genre and probably weds well with an afternoon on a lawn tractor... Taste: oof--a rather nondescript flavor of fizziness slaps the tongue and throat; this almost tastes like every Leinenkugel's I've had minus whatever additive was on the label (apparently canoe paddles have no flavor themselves)...

This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, refreshing, not filling, and the flavors did a decent job at holding my attention, I can see myself drinking a few of these while outside this summer, it's a nice summer session beer. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel and the added complexity from the rye, they were both good and the highlights of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, a little more head retention and lacing would have been nice. I would buy this beer again when I'm in the mood for a sessionalbe summer beer, the price is right and it's appropriate for the season, I recommend this beer to just about anyone, it a nice and easy drinking beer.

Clean, some corn, some rice, some grain, a touch of sweetness early on is countered with a decent bitterness and a cheap finish. Thin with hi carb and a dry finish. This is okay. I'd drink again.","harrymel","Feb 20, 2013"

2,-36.7,3,3,1.5,1,2,"The first bottle I opened had what I call a "snot pellicle". The first swallow was slimy and reminiscent of snot. Second bottle was the same way, but not as bad. This comes from improperly brewing with Rye (beta glucan rest??). This is odd since I couldn't taste any rye. Quite frankly this beer tastes like liquid cardboard with hops and a dash of kolsch and a hint of slime. I'm extremely dissappointed in this beer. I'm a big fan of Leine and a huge fan of the kolsch style.","jusware","Feb 16, 2013"

Canoe Paddler will undoubtedly find a permanent place in my summer cooler.","BeerFMAndy","Feb 15, 2013"

That said, I would reach for this over a budweiser any day. The body actually holds pretty well and it is not as thin as first perceived. Meh...I won’t have any trouble finishing the sixer that I bought, but SA Lawnmower beats this hands down as a readily available kolsch.","twiggamortis420","Feb 07, 2013"

2.97,-6,3.5,2.75,3,3,3,"Paddlin' the school canoe? Oh, you'd better believe that's a paddlin'... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear pale brass topped by a finger of relatively short-lived off-white foam. The nose comprises banana, light wheat, toast, very light lemon zest, and funky water. The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger lemon and wheat component. The body is a hefty light, with a moderate carbonation and a dry, crisp finish. Overall, an okay kolsch, but one that doesn't seem to utilize the rye very well, and one that misses the style's mark just a bit regardless.","TMoney2591","Feb 04, 2013"

Subdued maltiness throughout leads to a pleasantly refreshing tang in the finish. To the untrained taster easily mistaken for a light lager, a somewhat subtle Pilsner, or perhaps a blonde ale.","badkarma79","Jan 29, 2013"

A Macro-lager flavor takes over after a few minutes and stops everything dead in its tracks. Salvation comes only well-chilled on a hot summer day. (or so I would imagine) Not for the flavor-seeker.","hosehead83","Jan 26, 2013"

I was expecting a tasty rye brew but unfortunately with this beer there is no depth to the flavor. It has a very generic taste like some of the bigger brew name "Lite" beer options. If you are after a lite tasting beer, it might be for you, but unfortunately this is one Leinenkugel I would not purchase again.","ebrose","Jan 18, 2013"
