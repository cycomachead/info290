It's great that a brewery as big as G-B is able to deliver solid offerings that are well-intended takes on many of the different regional styles of beer throughout Germany. I could definitely have this again, although I'd want it fresher next time. Good stuff through and through - always a welcome treat after plummeting through lots of strong beers or a after a bad day at work.","magictacosinus","Aug 26, 2013"

3.5,2.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a nice clean/clear pale yellow color, nice carbonation, with a fizzy white head, not much sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hop notes, slight citrus note. The taste is malty, with some grapefruit notes, slightly hoppy/bitter. Medium body. Overall, a good thirst quencher, but I would not buy again.","Wasatch","Jul 29, 2013"

3.88,13.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"On tap from the Myrtle Beach location. Poured a clear, light gold/honey color with a small but lingering white head. Citrus notes like lemon and grapefruit. A slight bread note. Tasted of bread, citrus fruit, and a little herb/pine on the finish. Light bodied. Didn't finish as dry as I thought it would for the style. Very drinkable and probably one of the better ones I had on my visit.","clemtiger8202","Sep 13, 2012"

2.64,-22.6,3.5,2,2.5,3.5,3,"Pours a hazy light yellow with a 1/2 inch off-white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Decent thin rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grains and mustard seeds. This is very weird. Taste is of toasty grains, citrus zest hops, and a bitter metallic flavor. There is a medicinal bitterness that lingers after each sip. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer with a weird mustard/metal thing going on. I am not a fan of this beer.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 27, 2011"

4.23,24,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a very appetizing color of golden/honey with white head. Lots of light here. Nose is soft with some bready notes, and floral/herbal complexity. On the palate there's a big kolsch character that is delightful with plenty of herbal hop qualities, minerals, and light malt. Finish is overall deliciously herbal through the aftertaste. Medium bodied. Incredibly drinkable, yet also flavorful. Too bad most folks don't appreciate Kolsch.","yemenmocha","Jul 17, 2011"
2.91,-14.7,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"Poured from a tap into a pilsner? glass. Color was dark gold. Had an inch and a half of foam that remained there for awhile. Smell was a slight hint of honey but not a strong odor elsewhere. Very carbonated. Lots of flavors, but honey stood out. Golden honey would be a better way to describe it. Good summmer beer and was refreshing.","BucannonXC5","Jul 17, 2011"

4,17.3,4,4,4,4,4,"With its brilliant golden color and superb lacing, this is a beautiful beer to look at. This beer has a fresh grain aroma with a hint of yeast, and is slightly floral from the hops. Its crispness is spot-on and holds the light- to-medium body together. Malty, bready, grassy and faint biscuity flavors paint a broad stroke on the palate. Moderate hopping gives a balanced bitterness and a long trail of herbal flavor. This beer is a little nutty in the dry finish. Super drinkable and loaded with flavor, this brew is an amazing example of its style.","BeerAdvocate","Jan 10, 2011"

3.58,5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a golden body with minimal but frothy head with great lace on a light fruity body with pils malt smell. Light-bodied, dry pils malt taste yet a slightly sweet fruit taste that has some sugariness to it and is balanced with a sour apple/pear fruit taste. Not a bad summer beer.","clayrock81","Aug 09, 2010"
4.5,32,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The ale was served in a variation of the traditional Stange. This brew had a clear effervescent body with a whipped egg white head. The aroma was of malt and floral aroma hops. The sweetness of the malt is well balanced with the hop bitterness. This beer is a great example of the Kolsch style. Very similar to Reissdorf Kolsch. I highly recommend this as an alternative to the BMC brews for your NON-BA friends.","SpencerT","Aug 07, 2010"
3.6,5.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall, this is a clean, crisp, and refreshing beer. Pleasant certainly, and perfect for summer. Not a style I normally gravitate to, but worth checking out for something different.","briman","Jul 25, 2010"

3.23,-5.3,3.5,3,3,4,3.5,"This just started popping up around here recently, by recently I mean within the last 6 months. Pours to a clear yellow. It is rather crisp and refreshing and has a consistency like some kind of soda. It is slightly bitter with a citrus note. It is a good brew for summer. It's got that fresh kind of feeling to it.","whtguitarguy","Dec 24, 2009"
3.81,11.7,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Well obviously it a little dated, but this beer is pretty darn good on a damp, chilly early autumn day as well.Poured a clear straw color with a very tight formed one finger bone white head that has great lasting power.Aromas are toasty with light floral notes,crisp and clean on the palate with toasted cereal grain and a decent smack of leafy hoppiness in the finish.To me this is a great kolsch it stays delicate but has flavor,this was bottled back in April and it held up well,nice job GB on this one.","oberon","Oct 06, 2009"

3.7,8.5,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours to a thin white head and golden clear color. Good lacing. Aroma is sweet malt and noble hops typical for the style. Flavor is a stark juxtaposition of malt sweetness and graniness and hop bitterness. Finishes dry and crisp. Easy to drink for a summer brew.","EagleTalon","Jul 11, 2009"
3.88,13.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a clear golden yellow color with a thin fizzy head. The aroma is grain, hay and a touch of spicy hops. The taste follows the aroma with a clean dry finish and a nice kiss of hops. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Overall, not a bad beer and definitely a good beer to enjoy during the warm summer months!","cjgator3","May 28, 2009"
3.88,13.8,4,3.5,4,3,4.5,"A very nice summer beer that is very drinkable in the hot Virginia weather. A beautiful clear golden color with a decent head greets you when it's brought to your table. A modest smell of malt and a crisp refreshing taste almost reminiscent of a helles beer, but with mild hoppiness. This is a really nice session beer that helps to while away those long sultry weekend days with good company.","jushoppy2beer","Aug 05, 2008"
4.43,29.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"This had a foamy, bone-white marshmallow-like head upon arrival with good retention. The color was a pale yellow with NE-quality clarity. The nose had a sort of a lemony/citrus scent underlain with a yeasty mustiness. The mouthfeel was medium with a powerful lemon/citrus tang on the tongue. Finish was fantastically dry and intensely refreshing. Hefe for the summer? Hell, no! I'm having more of this! There was good lacing throughout.","woodychandler","Jun 12, 2008"
3,-12,3,3,3,3,3,"Some lacing on a light yellow pour. Very easy to drink and light bodied and flavored. Low carbonated and almost seemed a bit flat, at the Gordon Biersch Brewery. Nothing special really, and perhaps one of my least favorite Kolsches I've had. I liked Saint Arnold Lawnmower better, and also also Pyramid's Curveball kolsches better than this, I think.","JDV","Jan 31, 2008"
3.08,-9.7,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"This kolsch pours a typical clear yellowish gold. Aroma is hoppy and not strong. Flavor is fairly hoppy, pleasing although not complex - a typical summertime brew, light and refreshing, with just a touch of fruity sweetness. Finish has more sweet in it than the initial taste.","Cyberkedi","Jul 21, 2007"
