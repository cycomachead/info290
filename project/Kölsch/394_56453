3.8,0.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.75,"Nice straw color with hints of light amber. Thin head that disappears rather quickly leaving no lacing patterns. Aroma of dried grass and apples with a touch of bannana and plum (possibly vanilla). More apple and grass with the taste and something along the lines of tomato and herbs. Fairly heavy body with medium carbonation that fades quickly. This is the first Kolsch I've had in awhile and it makes me want to go after a few more.","Phigg1102","Jul 18, 2014"

4.71,24.6,4,4.25,5,5,4.75,"An extremely transluscent pale straw color brew serves prelude to the light and crisp flavors of tart granny smith apple, sun-roasted grass, spicy hops, thyme and wild herb presence, honey, and pear sweetness. Spicy and bitter on the nose with citric acidity. Comes together nicely, well-attenuated and reminds me of the new wave of hoppier, drier ciders. Chewier than ciders with a notable maltiness lending a comforting caramel aspect compliments a relatively high bitterness.","orcrist_cleaver","Jun 24, 2014"

Earthy dry grain, bready and lightly toasted malt and light herbal floral hop aromas. Medium bodied with an oily feel on the tongue surrounded by crisp, drying carbonation throughout. A nice balance of bready malt and herbal hop flavors throughout. Finished crisp and bone dry with light herbal hop aftertaste. A superb, crisp, refreshing summertime ale.","IronLover","May 28, 2014"

3.9,3.2,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 8/15/2012. Pours hazy golden straw color with a nice 1-2 finger dense bright white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of lemon zest, orange zest, herbal, earth, grass, wheat, biscuit, and nuttiness. Very nice aromas with nice balance and complexity. Taste of lemon zest, herbal, wheat, grass, biscuit, and peppery spiciness. Lingering notes of citrus rind, pepper, grass, wheat, and biscuit on the finish for a bit. Nice balance for flavors; with no cloying at all after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very crisp and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Almost zero alcohol presence after the finish as expected for 4.8%. Overall this is a very nice kolsch style. Nice amount of flavor with good balance and complexity; very smooth and crisp to drink.

The mouth feel was great, nice and smooth and very tasty, good one to drink when it is warm out.","chefhatt","Mar 08, 2012"

3.8,0.5,4,4,3.5,4,4,"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has everything a good pilsner has to offer; pilsner malts and Czech hops, except this beer has some mild Kolsch yeast esters. The taste is much the same. It's a little more bitter than most Kolschs' I've had in the past. It seems like it's modeled after a traditional Czech pilsner, but substituting the yeast strains. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an easy drinking beer. It would be a hit with both ale and lager drinkers alike.","WesWes","May 18, 2011"

3.42,-9.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours from the 12 oz. bottle a macro-like pale straw yellow with a foamy one finger head that settles into a collar of medium thickness. Carbonation is very active...there's a ton of bubbles rising. Aroma is slightly citrusy...there's a hint of lemon going on. 1st sip is light, crisp, and tart with more of the lemon peel thing going on. There is a bitterness on the background which comes more from the lemon than any hops notes. Mouthfeel is light & lager-like. Overall, this is an OK beer, but nothing that rocks my world. Would go nice with something off the grill on a hot summer weekend afternoon, but not something i'd put on my "must have" list.","CJfromPhilly","May 02, 2011"
3,-20.6,3,3,3,3,3,"Poured a clear, light golden color, with a frothy white head that dissipated rather quickly to a thin layer. Aroma of light malts and hay. Similar taste, with lightly toasted malts, hay, grass, earth, just a hint of hops, and a slightly bitter aftertaste. Very light profile, crisp, refreshing, and quite drinkable for a summer beer. I'm not a big fan of the style, but this was okay.","Rifugium","Apr 24, 2011"

1.9,-49.7,4,1.5,1.5,3,2,"Anyone who's brewed with a Kolsch yeast has undoubtedly noted the terrible smell given off during primary fermentation. Only with aging at near-lagering temps and perhaps a finning agent or two can you get rid of that and let the more delicate notes shine. My impression of Karnival Kolsch was that it was rushed through production and filtered for clarity.","timuel","Apr 14, 2011"

3.83,1.3,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"I think I'm a fan. Nothing amazing, but surely a beer I need to work into my rotation somehow in the future. Cleans up and delivers a good amount of flavor without being overbearing. Truly easy to drink like it should be. I want to say Kolsch but it seems too simple to be that... the Stange and then it to be kolsch screams too easy to guess. Ahh, hell. I don't know for sure. Pilsner?! Nah...","Khazadum","Mar 20, 2011"
4.1,8.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"In general it's on the mid-upper range of the style, but if they'd gone any lighter I'd imagine today's consumers would grumble, thinking it too light (don't let them know it has less alcohol than Bud). A touch more carbonation might help to give it a little more refreshing crispness, but it's still quite good as it is. Overall, they've done a very good job with a very specifically defined style (keeping it from becoming a Blonde ale or a fruity Euro "lager"). Best of all, it's probably fresh! Prost!","NeroFiddled","Mar 20, 2011"
3.1,-18,3,3,3,3,3.5,"The aroma was rather light, touches of caramel malts, light bready tones and a hint of banana were all that were readily noticeable, not bad really, would have liked a bit more of a pop in it though if I am being honest. The flavor was very nice though. Rich notes of biscuit and bready malts, layered on top of a light fruity spike of flavor. Some nice touches of grain coming through mid palate before dropping back into a smooth, and subtle feel. Crisp and clean finish left only the lightest bit of caramel flavor on the tongue before fading into the back and leaving me ready for the next sip. Nice, smooth, easy carbonation was an ease to drink, and I would have no issue with putting down multiples of this one.","mikesgroove","Mar 18, 2011"

Grassy and slightly citric hops are there the whole way through. Mouthfeel is clean and light. Overall, a nice kolsch brewed to style.

4.47,18.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bought a sixer of this stuff, definitely buy a sixer. The first glass is gone before you know it, designed for drinking in number under 5%. Forget strict definitions of a session beer, taste this it's a session beer. Pours a pale bright golden color beautiful appearance, bright thick white head dwindles down with large bubbles leaves behind a nice collar of lacing. Aroma is semi fruity, pale cereal malts light biscuit tones. Mineral water with herbal/grassy hop additions highlighted very close to a German Kolsch, probably better than half of the versions we get just due to the fact that this is so fresh. Best by 7/19/11 on the neck label it has to have been brewed recently. Flavor semi fruity notes amongst the cereal/grains herbal hops. Nothing complex but simplicity can rock your world especially in this type of style, I can't wait for Victory to bottle their Kolsch. These PA breweries do German styles so well. I gave a bottle to my cousin for helping me out with the little ones, I guess next time my local beer store opens up I'm going to have to grab another sixer. They only got one case in. If worse comes to worse I'll got to Vecenie's and grab a case of it at wholesale pricing. Mouthfeel is light bodied ample sturdy carbonation dead on nails the style. My kind of drinking beer, it gives you hop burps and feels as like it was brewed in Koln at a small local brewery.","WVbeergeek","Jan 06, 2011"
3.63,-4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a clear yellow-gold with a two-finger white head appearing after a few good swirls. A bit of lacing, though not too much. The nose was a bit of light pilsner grain plus some very mild fruit. A touch of floral hops as well. The taste was along the same lines. Nothing too complex, though no clear flaws either. I don't think anything will ever live up to the COAST 32/50, the beer by which I will measure all beers in this style (at least until I finally make it to Germany). Light and refreshing, this was crisp and I downed my glass pretty easily.","Thorpe429","Dec 23, 2010"

Taste consistent with nose with a Noble hops presence coming out towards the back and expressing itself as a light, lingering earthy bitterness between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-bodied with a slightly prickly carbonation. I'm not a huge kolsch fan, but this is probably one of the better, style-consistent domestic offerings out there.","Jwale73","May 15, 2010"
3.95,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"This was very good for the style, and while it maybe lacked some of the vinous and yeasty fruit character that I normally like in the nose, it more than made up for it with a surprisingly complex flavor profile and super easy drinkibility. Just really quaffable and tasty stuff here, just in time for the summer season.","Kegatron","May 15, 2010"

3.73,-1.3,3.5,3,4,4,4,"Pours clear straw color with a wispy white head that left some clingy lacing on the glass. The aroma is light. I pick up some grains and that is about it. The taste is sweet from the malt, some cereal flavors. Kind of has a pilsner malt flavor. There is a very light peppery and grassy hop bitterness in the end to balance out the brew. The feel is light with tingly carbonation; lightly sweet on the palate. An easy drinking brew for sure. Nice and refreshing and not very bitter. Good alternative for those who don't like pilsners or adjunct lagers.","Gmann","May 08, 2010"
3.96,4.8,3.5,2.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Surprisingly chewy, full body with a nice crisp earthy hop presence up front along with some peppery spice that flows into a creamy mid palate with hints of grass, straw, light fruit notes and bready yeast. The dry hops linger throughout over the bready yeast, subtle malt and apple, banana and pear fruit notes into a dry finish. Much more complex and flavorful than expected. Quite a nice surprise. Recommended!","corby112","May 08, 2010"

A pleasant scent of that is floral, grassy, a bit of soap, clean, spicy hop aroma. Light and clean yet flavorful: slight hops, grassy, wheat, grains, a hint of lemon, slight hop spice toward the finish. Light in body, crisp taste, refreshing to drink, a sudsy mouthfeel that is just right. This is an enjoyable beer for an enjoyable weekend. Bring the kids.","JRed","May 06, 2010"

Plenty of flavour without an heavy feel makes it easy to drink. A really good beer to have in your frig for the summer to have when you want "a beer" or to offer that knuckle dragging BMC drinking neighbor or brother-in-law when they ask you for a beer!

In general, not my favorite style (pilsners also in that mix of styles I am not a big fan of) But both the kolsch style and pilsner style are normally considered highly sessionable brews. For me, this one doesn't fit in there.","irishking1977","Apr 21, 2010"

4.1,8.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"In the mouth this is definitely true. Carbonation makes it's presence felt immediately, producing a soft roll on the tongue. Some lemon tartness emerges and zips quickly into high notes of bready malt and lower notes of sweet berries. It arcs then finishes with a quick turn, allowing a floral, piny hop to emerge. The finish is still full and not as dry as some other examples I've tried (unfortunately), but IMO it is a solid representation of the style and a great addition to the local beer scene this Spring. Overall the beer moves soft and quickly while still hitting high and low notes - telling a nice refreshing story for the drinker to imbibe.","Philabeerphia","Apr 18, 2010"

It tasted like floral hops with sour grassy and lemony hops, and some bready yeast and earthy malt. It was watery with some carbonation, and had a sour aftertaste. Overall this was a decent beer that seemed like a good example of the style, but was too sour for my tastes. If I want a sour beer, I prefer a wild ale that's more bold.

3.88,2.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"On-tap at J. Ryan's in Syracuse. Appeared a brilliant gold color with a tall white head. This was a dry and hoppy Kolsch. As in there was less malt and ester than most Germans, but it was still within reason for the style and it was quite tasty. The hops were earthy and spicy like, good Euro hops, while there was a light bready malt undercurrant. No, it's not the best or most complex Kolsch (Summit's comes to mind), but it's a great hop-centric take on the style. Check it out.","tempest","Apr 02, 2010"
