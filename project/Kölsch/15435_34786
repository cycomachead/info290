Beau's Lug Tread is a perfect example of a kölsch, that unique beer from Cologne. Although the appearance isn't anything too exciting, the flavour is. It has a hoppiness that definitely tells you it's there but the bitterness is toned down a bit. The lacing is excellent and the head quickly dissipates. All in all this is an excellent beer to drink year round.","stpatty","Jun 03, 2014"

Again a very clean, crisp, and refreshing beer that I would definitely drink again, I kind of had a feeling I should have picked up some of the 650mL 4-packs when I had the chance, but thanks to the OCB summer discovery pack I finally got to try this one.","Roke87","Jul 02, 2011"

Lager tickles from the brisk carbonation, though the body stands like an ale. Malt bomb of the pale shade with lots of bread and biscuity flavors. Ripe pears in the middle. Clean bite of hops is there to balance and flavor with an herbal spicy edge. Kiss of grain husk and more herbal hop in the dry finish.

Taste is actually much better than expected...More malt profile in the flavour and balanced quite well with the yeast. Some bitterness lingers, but mainly grassy taste remains. A lighter mouthfeel that is dry. One bottle will suffice, perhaps a step up from any macro lager but otherwise I wouldn't reach for another.

The biscuit flavour dominates the taste at first but quickly leads into a delicious fruity apple-like sweetness with just enough herbal/spicy hops to balance things out.

3.8,2.4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"I've passed it up a few times at the LCBO, but I think I'll be back for a sampling of that next time I'm 'round. Good, highly drinkable stuff.","JohnnyBarman","Apr 26, 2010"

4.3,15.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This is one of those great beers that should appeal to both craft and macro drinkers - perhaps something akin to a Boston Lager. Its not too far removed from what macro drinkers would expect in a beer, but its done with such a deft hand that it will introduce them to what even an easy drinking beer can be capable of. I'm glad they went this route rather than beginning with some crappy lager or pale ale.","bobsy","Apr 14, 2010"
3.85,3.8,4,4,3.5,4.5,4,"Personally I would enjoy a little less malt sweetness on the tongue an. Could use a touch more acidity to get me stoked on the style.","bartle","Apr 08, 2010"
4.01,8.1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"You could easily pound pints of this in the summer on the patio, at the beach, BBQing... perfect light summer beer.","ritzkiss","Apr 07, 2010"
3.68,-0.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Overall: This is a hard style to review for me as it is not the most flavorful of beer styles (for me anyways). Regardless, i enjoyed it and would have it again.","papat444","Apr 05, 2010"
3.81,2.7,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"I love the new 4 packs of 600mL bottles that are in the LCBO. I think this is a great beer for the macro crowd, while still being interesting enough for the beer geeks.","kwjd","Mar 31, 2010"
3.93,5.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"This is very drinkable. Would make a great session beer. Nice flavourful, simple brew. I would definitely order this again.","eat","Mar 23, 2010"
3.68,-0.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"600ml bottle from the Cooper Street LCBO in Toronto, Ontario. Pours into the stange a golden straw yellow with a ring of white head that persists for the duration of the beer. Aroma and flavour are yeast, sweet and grainy malts, honey, a bit of funk, lemon grass, soapy and herbal hops, and a parched, wheat cereal aftertaste. Mouthfeel is crisp and medium bodied with a spicy, peppery bite and dry finish. Very clean and refreshing. One of the best session beers in the province, great for quaffing on a sunny afternoon!","cratez","Mar 21, 2010"
3.85,3.8,3,3,4,4.5,4.5,"overall nice and crisp, a perfect option on a nice spring/summer afternoon","MattyV","Mar 19, 2010"
3.73,0.5,3.5,3,4,4,4,"D: Extremely easy to drink; a great beer to start the evening with, or to have on a hot day. An encouraging flagship brew that only makes me want to try more from Beau's.","berley31","Mar 04, 2010"
3.62,-2.4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"An interesting enough 'lagered ale', but not enough to have another, or drop a MacD on one of those big bottles at the LCBO.","biboergosum","Feb 07, 2010"
2.57,-30.7,2.5,3,2,4,2.5,"A golden coloured ale with a fingers worth of fizzy white head. The head is poorly retained and leaves no lace behind. Smells like pils malt, grass, and hay with a faint hint of lemon. Very mild aroma. The flavour shows bread malt and tangy lemon with a grassy finish. Finishes dry with medium bitterness. I have to dock it for the cooked vegetable note that comes forward as it warms. It's bad enough to completely ruin an otherwise fairly tasty beer. It reminds me of the vegetative flavour in the Nickel Brook Organic Lager. Light bodied with medium carbonation, feels crisp. Drinks easy. It's alright, but I don't know if I would buy it again at eight dollars per 750mL bottle.","mintjellie","Jan 23, 2010"
3.88,4.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"D: Wether you are getting this for the style, the beer, or the bottle. It's worth the cost. It's economical, but it doesn't quite comply with my tastes. Good beer none the less.","Long813","Jan 09, 2010"
3.77,1.6,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"A decent Kolsch, hoppier than I expected, worth a try.","CAMRAhardliner","Jan 03, 2010"
3.88,4.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The carbonation was balanced and felt nice, which matched the chewiness of the beer.","kjyost","Jan 01, 2010"
3.44,-7.3,4,2.5,3.5,4,4,"Nice mouthfeel and pretty drinkable, something has to be done about this plastic taste though.","GodOfBeer","Sep 27, 2009"
3.76,1.3,4,3,4,4,4,"At almost $8 a 750ml bottle it's hard to justify drinking this regularly.","decimator","Sep 19, 2009"

3.85,3.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability: A very simple beer, perfect for that hot summer night of relaxing on the porch. I will be keeping an eye out for more on my travels.","krisandajt","Jun 25, 2009"
3.9,5.1,4,4,4,3,4,"A fantastically moreish drinker, very light but satisfying at the same time. It has a aura of a macro taste about it, but at the same time it reeks of quality. A very smart choice for a flagship beer in this market as I think those who are used to macro lagers and order this because it's local will be pleasantly surprised enough to make the switch.","MeisterBurger","Jun 07, 2009"
4.1,10.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"As someone stated earlier, this would make a great session beer. Now I just need to find out where I can return the bottles!","Ralphus","Oct 24, 2008"
3.73,0.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"This is a well-done version of a style I find boring. I'm unlikely to order it again, but it will be successful and rightly so. It's well-made craft beer.","KaiMiller","Sep 23, 2008"
4.03,8.6,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"D - Easy drinking, light, but with plenty of character. Would be nice to session (also the bottle is cool).","allergictomacros","Apr 01, 2008"
3.03,-18.3,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Bottle: Poured a deep clear golden color Kölsch with a big foamy head with average retention and no lacing. Aroma of unrefined grain and weird dry ester is not overly pleasant. Taste is a mix between rich medium sweet grains with again some dry ester. Full body with good carbonation is pleasant. I have to admit that this is not a style that I am overly knowledgeable about or that I appreciated a whole lot but I thought this was acceptable.","Phyl21ca","Mar 19, 2008"
3.89,4.9,3,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a golden lager colour. The scent and taste remind of some pilsners I have. This has lot's of character. I like the after taste a lot - grassy and classy. i've had this on draft before but surprisingly I'm enjoying this more out of the bottle. It tastes a lot fresher. The ceramic bottle with the rubber sealed stopper is a keeper too. Very nice.","shamus","Mar 08, 2008"
4.24,14.3,3,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Mouthfeel was spot on, not overboard on carbonation. This was a great smooth drink. A session beer with flavour that stays true to it's continental roots. Good stuff.","CanuckRover","Oct 04, 2007"
4.17,12.4,3.5,4,4,4,5,"Impression: A very well made and subtly complex Kolsch-styled ale with soft flavourful character and great drinkability.","pootz","Sep 30, 2007"
2.48,-33.2,3.5,3,2,2.5,2.5,"On tap at the Clock Tower in Ottawa as a guest tap. Fresh. Pale yellow with a good head.Significant candy sugar aroma. Watery. A faint bitterness offsetting the taste of sugar and water. Drinkable on a hot summer day, maybe the formula has been altered as it should have more hops.","Sammy","Aug 23, 2007"
4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a slightly hazy golden/yellow, thick white head, nice lacing, looks good. Smell is sweet, very clean, malty, some yeast, citrus, refreshing. Taste is nice and malty, some sweetness, wheat, very grainy, citrus, with a dry finish, kind of lemony. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, low carbonation. I understand they've had some consistency problems with this one, but a decent drink and an underrepresented style.","Viggo","Jan 15, 2007"
