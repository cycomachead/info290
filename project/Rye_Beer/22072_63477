More of a smoke beer with rye elements to me, but still a nice variation on several styles with good use of all the ingredients involved that made for a complex and flavorful brew.","CHickman","Mar 22, 2014"

4.04,2.8,5,4,4,3.75,4,"Poured into nonic pint glass; jet black with a big fluffy creamy tan head that fades after a bit leaving awesome rings of lacing. Smell is roasted malt, slight coffee, sweet chocolate, soft rye grain. Taste is sweet chocolate, bitter coffee roasted malt, and a hint of spicy grainy rye mixed in with it all. The rye grain adds an extra dimension to the mouthfeel, which is on the thinner side for a stout but the carbonation makes up for it.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Jul 30, 2013"

3.95,0.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"I'll admit my wariness going into this, what with the incredible sadness caused by things bearing the name "Repo Man" (eg the Genetic Opera, Repo Men, etc). Still giving it a whirl, though: It pours a deep black-brown topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises coffee, roasted malts, and a bit of molasses. Somehow, it just smells sorta dry... The taste holds notes of toasted rye bread, roasted malts, a touch of sourdough, and, once again, that little hint of molasses. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a very nice stout, though it comes off just a notch too thin for my preference. Beyond that, though, good times...","TMoney2591","Sep 03, 2012"

4.35,10.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D= Really the best thing I have had at Revolution, and that is saying something. Many rye beers just don't get it right, but this one does. Complex, spicy and delicious.","spointon","Jul 02, 2011"
4.18,6.4,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"D - Gets a touch bitter and fatiguing after a pint or so, but otherwise thoroughly enjoyable. Is this the base beer for Bad Man? If so, I think I prefer it before it hits the barrels. Another fine offering from Revolution in any case.","MasterSki","Dec 02, 2010"

4,1.8,4,4,4.5,4,3,"A few weeks before sitting down and enjoying a pint of this beer, I tried a flight of Revolution beers. This beer stood out to me for one reason: the finish. The first couple drinks finish almost totally clean like a good, dry red wine. There is a heavy roast and rye taste (the beer is 20% rye) but it does not bog the flavor or your taste buds down. About half way through to the last leg of the beer, you find that a roasty taste has built up in your mouth. If the glass was any bigger, you might find that the taste becomes too much but they have built the beer just right that you finish before you throw the towel in. This beer is a perfect first-beer-of-the-night because while it still has flavor and style, your palate washes clean with a glass of water.","lmorgent","Nov 12, 2010"
4.77,21.4,4.5,5,5,4,4.5,"Beg borrow or steal to get some if you can. This is a beer worthy of seeking out.","cadaugherty","Beers"
4.37,11.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"I had this both on tap and on cask at the brewpub...Pours a very dark brown with blood red highlights. A light tan head, poor lacing ok retention...The aroma is really sweet figs and rye, complex and intriguing...The taste is noting short of awesome and insanely awesome, malty caramel and dark fruits then out of nowhere awesome chocolate, roasted coffee and nuts, unreal...Thick and lasting feel, so easy to drink. By far the best beer Cibak has done to date, coming it coming.","jrallen34","0"
