However, the underlying, deep flavors added a complex and likeable beer. The malt came through and added some sweetness. The finish was somewhat bitter (which I like) and left no lingering after taste. I would not make this my every day drink but I will be happy to have this in my refrigerator in the autumn.","Jvermont","Oct 13, 2013"

2.65,-27.6,2.5,3,2.5,2.75,2.5,"Overall this beer lacks definition. I can't say it is off style because it's merely a unique take on the general fall-beer theme. But it does seem muddled and confused. And some ingredients that are supposed to be in this beer are not distinguishable. It doesn't taste bad and I will finish the 6 pack, but I sure wont buy it again. I say its best to drink this with a hearty meal, rather than on its own.","jbertsch","Aug 30, 2013"
4,9.3,4,4,4,4,4,"This brew shows a murky haze of rusty brown with a stout tan-ish head and goodly gobs of lacing. The aroma offers a malty mulled apple with hints of light lemon hop. It definitely sets the stage for those October days. The flavor brings more bright yeasty bread over the same cider malt with woodsy-leafy characteristics and a dry grass finish. I get some ideas of nutmeg and tea and hints of orange clove. It's medium bodied with delicate but purposeful carbonation that provides a good bit of tongue tingle and refreshment for those football afternoons and brisk autumn winds. Very woodsy, crisp and flavorful. Nice job Baxter!","Durge","Aug 23, 2013"

But still more of an average craft beer, and very light nose, spices orish could have cut in more, maybe mix up the malts a bit, something to at least bring a specific character out rather than a mundane American red ale with hints if something that could have made it more unique.","jlindros","Beers"

3.6,-1.6,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured from a can into a tumbler pint, the beer is a deep, dark, almost opaque ruby-copper coloring with a tall, frothy, dense, off-white head that starts around an inch and a half and slowly settles into a half an inch that remains for the duration of the brew. Slightly hazed body gives the appearance of opaqueness. Aromas of a malt-bomb. Rich, roasty caramel and nut, with a subtle grainy underlying character. Smells pretty good. Flavors are hop forward, surprisingly, with a resiny and bitter backbone that supports the grainy and malty profile. Tangy and sweet caramel with a roasting characteristic, blended with some pepper spices from the hops. The malt profile is a bit restrained compared to the nose, providing a little more breathing room for the hops presence. Resiny and peppery aftertaste, with a touch of sweetness at the very end. Slick, rich finish, with a clean, slightly drying feel. The body is a bit lighter/watery compared to what I was expecting on the pour, but the flavors are interesting and tasty. Easy to drink.","GarthDanielson","Nov 11, 2012"

The can says it has all these spices in it, plus it's aged on oak. I didn't get any of that. All I tasted was a hoppy amber ale that tasted like all their other beers. Mouthfeel was sharp and crisp, which was on par for a rye beer. It's not a bad beer, but it was just kind of a letdown because I wanted more flavor.","morebeergood","Oct 24, 2012"
