The only sour flavor here is a bit of sweet sparkling white wine next to some apple cider. The simplicity and earthiness of this beer are what shine. Relatively inexpensive on tap, so that's a plus. If you like earthy brews, this is for you.","Jack_Malts","Oct 24, 2014"

4.1,5.7,,,,,,"As the characterful ale finishes, it moves from the medium weight of Biere de Garde early and to the mid-light body of Belgian pale ale late. Its peppery, peaty and citrus pith finish is arid with carbonic bite and piney bitterness while sweaty brine and barnyard return in waves of aftertaste. With each sip, the memory of Goose Island Matilda and Orval Trappist Ale come to mind in comparison.","BEERchitect","Sep 30, 2014"

4.24,9.3,4.5,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"I love the pun on this—it’s a play on the Kal-Haven Trail that runs across southwest Michigan. The beer is a light tan amber with light foam. I get a earthy funk from the aroma. It’s light but present, like a light onion sliced in the adjoining room… which is the only way I could think of describing it. Nice malt body with a delicate brett note that emerges as it warms. Not bad, but I’d like to see what could happen with some more time on this one. It shows promise and plenty of potential.","elNopalero","Jan 08, 2013"
4.47,15.2,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.5,"Overall: a bells tap only that is easy to miss but great if you find it. Great balance between tropical, juicy fruit and earthy funky yeast. Certainly one of the more interesting beers I have had","SportsandJorts","Dec 30, 2012"

Well, it's pretty good. The tartness gets weaker as the beer goes on and the funky rye flavors get more powerful. Still not sure if I like that or not. I'd like to try this beer again a few months from now. Probably wont be able to find it, though.","tectactoe","Nov 30, 2012"

4.22,8.8,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a mix of light bronze and hazy amber with bits of dark yellow. The head was an inch of loose off white suds that look die off into nothing. Small spots of lace. Smells like a lot of great bretted up homebrew I've had. Brett and some funk and a lot of barnyard IMO. Some rye is under all the wild. Some caramel and grain. The taste is pretty marvelous. Bretty up front with hay and grass and other earth, barnyard. Not overly funky, kinda tart. I like the low level of rye in this. Some rye bread and grain towards the end. Feel is below medium with a nice carb punch from the tap. Crisp and evervesant, easy going down, if brett's your thing. It's mine so this is insanely drinkable. Good job.","BARFLYB","Jun 07, 2010"
3.88,0,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a dusty copper color with orange highlights, decent cap of off-white head and good lacing. Scent is mellow - funk, earth, clay with dry, spicey grain. Taste is a little more aggressive, spicy rye with a mild funkyness to it. Medium bodied, active carbonation, dry and lingering. A decent beer which combines ingredients from different styles nicely.","rfgetz","Sep 05, 2009"
4.18,7.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Chewy medium body that is slightly spicy with lots of sweet caramel malt and rye along with a slightly puckering dry bretty efervescence. The tart Brett presence is mos prominent up frogt and slowly fades throught the palate as the malts and rye counter it. Very well balanced and quaffable with a sweet dry finish.","corby112","Beers"
4.07,4.9,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"D= I liked this beer a lot and between the two Bell's sour beers I have had (this and Wild One) I think I prefer this one. The rye gives it a very nice balance and makes it interesting AND easy to drink.","spointon","0"
