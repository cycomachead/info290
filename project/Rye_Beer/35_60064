3.65,3.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall it’s another pleasant brew from Boston Beer Company. I know most people in the craft beer community seem to knock Sam Adams, but I end up having some type of Sam Adams in my beer fridge year-round. Regardless of the stigma that has slowly evolved, I have found most Sam Adams offerings to be extremely drinkable, and still maintain the general characteristics of whatever style they were shooting for. This was an OK beer. I will certainly pick it up again.","CraftBeerTastic","Jul 09, 2011"

3.33,-5.4,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured a walnut brown with a thin white head. Bready aroma, with scents of caramel and light spice. Toasty malts in the taste, bready, light sensation of dried fruits, and a touch of spice. Bitter hops follow, for a fairly dry finish, and a bitter aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel, and fairly drinkable.","Rifugium","Jun 17, 2011"

3.67,4.3,4.5,2.5,4,4,4,"I kinda like this beer, it is a good transitionary winter to spring beer...as the lable boasts. I like the red/amber start followed by a subtle (very subtle) piney finish. The beer poured into the glass quite nice, nice amber/red color with foamy white head. Nice carbonation as well. I did not smell to much, so rated it low in that category. The taste is what was described above andit is very easy on the pallete. Another strong beer from Sammy A!","WoodBrew","May 21, 2011"
3.29,-6.5,4.5,3,3,4,3.5,"D/O: This pale ale is not the most representative of rye-inclusive beers, but it drinks easily enough. It has some appealing herbaceous qualities, but one has to wonder if those were the features really intended to stand out. In the end it is unremarkable but inoffensive.","beagle75","May 21, 2011"
3.75,6.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"O- Tasty and somewhat smooth. A good sam adams beer and a good rye ale. A nice summer beer.","Dodo2step","May 21, 2011"
2.69,-23.6,4,2.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,"The nose features rye and sweet malt in roughly equal strength. Toasty, too. Pleasant but mild. Surprising amount of bitterness given the relative lack of hop flavor; the rye kind of fills in the gaps here. Moderately sweet malts. Bitterness, rye, and that's about it, not too interesting.","PDXHops","May 19, 2011"
3.7,5.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall: This strikes me as the Boston Lager with a touch of rye. I like BL and could have several cause of this. That said, this is a typical Sam Adams beer with a small twist--of adding the rye. Drink up if you want a different take on you SABL.","tigg924","May 19, 2011"
3.85,9.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"D/O- I must say, the ABV to flavor ratio is wonderful. The result is great drinkability. The bready/grainy qualities mixed with said flavor would bring a BMC drinker to his or her knees. Best of the BBC Spring sampler pack, keep it around Jim!","Duff27","May 18, 2011"

I bought another seasonal 12-pack just to get 2 more of these but it's getting ridiculous since I give away most of the other beers.","therica","May 12, 2011"
4,13.6,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer has a nice dark amber body with a light fizzy 2 finger heat that lays down quickly to a nice sticky lace. The smell is very sweet and malty. The taste is sweet to start off but it finishes with a hop flavor (almost like a strong ipa flavor). The mouth feel is a little thick but smooth. Overall i think it is a good beer.","chefhatt","May 11, 2011"
3.33,-5.4,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a big two finger head, slightly off white and pretty foamy, it's sticking around very well, but I don't know what kind of lacing I'll get out of it. The body is a dark amber color and has medium-large amounts of carbonation, the body is slightly see through, but for the most part it's too dark to see through. Overall it looks very nice, the head has stuck around for quite a while and is giving good lacing. This beer smells like a scotch ale to me, it's got a big malt flavor to it and a very sweet, molasses/maple syrup smell to it. Not much hop aroma at all on the smell. Overall it smells ok, but frankly I think it will be way too sweet. The taste is very interesting, pretty unique. First thing I taste is that molasses/maple syrup taste, and it's not nearly as overpowering as I thought it would be. There is then a taste that I can't quite identify, it might be the rye, but I've had rye beers before and I usually don't get a taste like this, it's kind of like an alcohol-y, plant like taste, it's really weird. Is it a terrible taste? No, but it's very strange. In the finish you get a little bit of a metallicy taste, which is strange because this is out of a bottle. Overall the taste is a little watered down and in the flavors that I do get it's only ok. Part of me wants to give this beer a 3.5 on taste because it's not a bad taste and it's yummy in some areas, but what it comes down to is that it doesn't have enough flavor and it's not too amazing of a flavor, it really wouldn't be fare to all the good beers I've given 3.5. The drinkability is ok, not amazing, but decent. The mouthfeel is pretty good, it's got decent carbonation and it's big enough for the style. Overall it's an ok beer, a little complex, but it lacks the flavor.","MaltsOfGlory","May 10, 2011"

3.39,-3.7,3.5,4.5,3,3,3,"Pours a bright reddish hue, clear, with a thin head, some lacing. Smell is very impressive, sweet honey, whole grain, earthy scent. Taste is not as impressive as scent. Hops is there, rye? Not so much. Has some nice nice qualities but has a bad aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thin, even a bit watery. Overall, not my favorite.","gskitt","May 09, 2011"
3.16,-10.2,4,3,3,3,3.5,"Overall: A simple and forgettable rye beer. Nothing really pops out here and the rye seems too toned town to make an impact on the flavour. This is too bland for my tastes.","JohnnyChicago","May 09, 2011"
3.86,9.7,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Taste: Sweet malty flavor with a little bitterness to balance the sweetness. There is a little bit of an alcohol taste in the background.","ruckus232","May 08, 2011"
3.38,-4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Eh. It's not that bad, at least it's crisp and rather refreshing, but it doesn't have a lot to offer in terms of complexity or uniqueness.","lacqueredmouse","May 08, 2011"
3.8,8,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Samuel Adams Revolutionary Rye Ale is a very clear and very sparkling amber ale with a foamy, yellowish, off white head that has excellent retention and lacing. It has an aroma of rye, lemon, grapefruit and grass. It has a smooth, lively, medium-light body with a crisp, dry finish. It's a simple, well balanced flavor that's pretty dry with rye flavor throughout. It seems like there are American hops complementing the rye, but there's also something pretty grassy going on in there. It's amply bitter and it leaves me thirsty enough to need another sip. This is really easy to drink. I could have a few of these and not blow my palate.","yesyouam","May 06, 2011"

Respectable two finger head that lasted quite a while, with some fine clinging lace. Color is a 11 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is mostly of hops, lots of them, with a little wheat, and a touch of rye. Flavor leans to the hop side with flavors of grapefruit and lime, with a wheat bread taste next, and a faint hint of rye. I thought I would taste much more rye. Good full feeling in my mouth, smooth like cream with cling, and just about the right amount of zing. I was hoping for a little more rye flavor, but what I got from this beer was good, but not quite what I was hoping.

In and of itself, the taste is solid and enjoyable, but once again, I had hoped for a more significant rye flavor. The rye is realy only to be found in a pleasant but not overpowering sour aftertaste. Mouthfeel is typically SA, which is to say moderatley full-bodied with a nice level of carbonation.

The rye doesn't add much in the way of flavor maybe a bit of contrast to the hops but not much beyond that. Body is medium along with average carbonation and dry finish make the mouthfeel pretty good. Overall I'm not entirely impressed with this beer. I've had limited exposure to rye beers mainly in the form of homebrewed examples where the rye was a much more predominate player in the taste profile.

I see no compelling reason why I would want to pick up a six pack of this (if it were available) and other than the taste of rye, nothing about this stands out.

The taste really runs with the spice idea, bringing in a bunch o' black pepper, nutmeg, and clove. Some rye and sourdough bready up the works a bit, only to have some toasted toffee rush in and take everything over. Things are a bit too disjointed for my liking, with the various strong flavors all vying for my tongue's attention without any semblance of cooperation.

It does have some rye bite but fails to be big winner. I purchased a 12 pack with 6 different kinds of Samuel Adams, but so far not a lot of winners other than the two I already like, the fine Noble Pils and the decent Boston Lager.

Pours a translucent copper with a half inch, loose, cream-colored head that quick;y sizzles and dissipates into a thin slick and a frothy band. Specks of lacing clustered on the glass during the tasting and exhibited good adherence. Not much happening in the nose - light malt with some sweet and fruity notes and a slightly metallic aroma. Taste follows nose; however a little less fruity. There's also a light, bittering hops that comes out towards the middle but dissipates towards the finish.

Spicy rye assertive bready malt character with hints of caramel malt, pine and citrus hops bursts but doesn't kill with bitterness just a nice complementary hop/rye combo, not overdone in anyway. Medium bodied ale, a bit of extra girth from the rye additions, carbonation was mellow and smooth on the palate.

There are also some piney notes with spices and caramel malt. Taste is exactly how it smells...Very interesting tasting beer. It tastes like a pale ale with a German backbone. The rye flavors and bready notes are definitely there with some strong malt and gentle hops. It ends with slightly bitter and very sweet/spicy flavors that aren't very appealing...not digging the finishing flavors. Mouthfeel is quite light with very clean, crisp finish. Drinkability is fairly high, despite the unattractive finish.","DovaliHops","Jan 27, 2011"
3.43,-2.6,4,3.5,2.5,4.5,4.5,"D/M: Very crisp and drink able. Not too overpowering. It really is a decently drinkable beer but the rye aspect is not very evident. It appears to be too watered down. I wanted more of a rich bite to the beer.","pzrhsau","Jan 26, 2011"

3.63,3.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I'll first say that I'm not a fan of rye and most beers with rye in it - so me finding this as drinkable as I did was rather surprising. But really, the flavor and aroma just aren't very interesting. Worth a try from the sampler pack, though, I suppose.","mithrascruor","Jan 25, 2011"
3.1,-11.9,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"D: Not exactly as assertive as I was hoping for. Emboldening all the flavors would do this beer some good, especially bringing the rye to a more prominent position and adding more spiciness.","phantomwyse","Jan 25, 2011"
3.68,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Poured into a slender pint glass (Yazoo Brewing Co). Deep copper color with a two finger white head. The aroma is the rye and spicy hops. The flavor is much the same as the aroma. The tang of the rye shows throughout the brew. medium carbonation and the body is medium as well. Would be a nice session beer.","phishgator","Jan 24, 2011"
3.83,8.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"The beer has nice carbonation and a dark red/orange color. It smells like rye, I guess. The taste is nicely malty, with a hop finish.

Yes.","DrStiffington","Jan 23, 2011"

4,13.6,4,4,4,4,4,"12oz bottle purchased as part of the spring seasonal mix-pack at Shaw's in Windham. Pours a crystal-clear amber-red body with nearly an inch of off-white head. Citrus grassy hops and rye notes make up the aroma. Lemon, grass, rye, caramel, and grapefruit round out the flavor. Medium in both body and carbonation. Very drinkable. I liked it better than I thought I would. One of the better rye beers I've had.","MrHurmateeowish","Jan 20, 2011"

4,13.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, Revolutionary Rye Ale is a redish-amber color with a cream colored, creamy looking head. Nose is mainly of rye with some piney, resinous hops. The flavor is also dominated by rye with a bitter hoppiness and slight caramel malt background. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a light yet creamy carbonation. Overall beer is to style, takes some getting used to but is not a bad beer.","gmfessen","Jan 18, 2011"
3.73,6,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"D - Quite drinkable. The aroma is very pleasant and the flavor more or less reflects it. The spicy rye works quite well with the pine hop character and the rich, toasty malt provides a solid background for this relationship to play out upon. A pretty nice rye pale ale, though not quite as good as Terrapin.","nickfl","Jan 17, 2011"
3.36,-4.5,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Crystalline copper with a tall, persistent, dense rocky head. Mild spicy malt aroma, biscuity/bready with a touch of hops. Slightly sweet and spicy flavor with a certain "Sam Adams-ness" to it. Nothing exciting, but nothing terrible. Creamy, oily texture with some rye bite. Crisp and medium bodied. Simple, but I could drink a few.","wedge","Jan 15, 2011"

4,13.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Beer pours out a deep copper color with a very creamy looking white head. There is already some lacing on my glass. Smells very piney (cascades?) and some herbal hop notes, perhaps a tad sweet maltiness settled in the base aromas. Tastes somewhat crisp and a little dry, and has a nice citrus palate cleansing aftertaste. This beer has a nice balance between the malts and the hops. Rye is somewhat faint but in the background gives a spicey taste. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Overall this a good interpretation of the style and would be a welcome addition to their regular offering.","Star80","Jan 14, 2011"

4.41,25.3,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Flavorful yet drinkable, what a great beer! Pours simply gorgeous with deep amber color and rich, creamy head. Beautiful. Nose has a mixture of herbal components and light caramel, with a clean toasty grain aroma that is pleasing. On the palate the rye is apparent but also blends nicely with the toasty caramelly sweetness, smooth mouthfeel, and exceptional drinkability. Yet another successful craft beer from this amazing brewery.","yemenmocha","Jan 13, 2011"

3.46,-1.7,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"D- A very malty medium to heavy bodied Rye. The sweetness is a bit much, and I would consider this beer to be a malt bomb. I think that a bit more of a smokey note would have been nice in the beer, but hey it won the contest to be the next SA beer. I tried this after having the Belgian IPA that came in second in the taste off. Not sure how this beer won out, but hey I wish it all the best. Stay thirsty my friends!","birddogg66","Dec 02, 2010"

Not really too much hops in the nose, if any, there is a touch of fruit like hops. Medium mouthfeel. The taste is rather ho-hum. Starts of with some mild sweetness and biscuit like qualities that then transitions to a dry like finish with just a touch of hop bitterness. Yeah, I hope they don't make Sample B. Minimal lace. No real alcohol notes.","kbutler1","Nov 03, 2010"
3.75,6.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a hazy, deep amber to copper with a light tan head. In the aroma, sweet rye maltiness and light fruitiness. In the taste, dry rye and a small hint of fruit.

3.55,0.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5," The taste is much like the boston ale with same noble hop profile and yeast flavor w/ slight elelent of toasted rye grain in the malt and light herbal hop quality. there is a mild vegetal tinge from the hops w/ light tang from the house S.A. yeast. A mild grainy note w/ a pretty good overall balance from hops/malt in the finish which is relatively clean. This was a good beer, not a great one. I enjoyed it for what it is a pretty drinkable ale. I would probably drink this if available, but not go out of my way for it, not my first choice in the challenge between it and the Belgian IPA, but it is ok for the style.","Slatetank","Sep 05, 2010"

I picked this one because the belgian seemed a bit weak for the style and was slightly less flavorful. It did have the rye taste to it but it seemed much more likeable that other ryes I've had. The body was good with a bit of a bunch when it hit the taste buds. It went down with a bit fo a sting but was enjoyable. It was good to place this booth near the entrance so I didn't have many other beers lingering on my tongue.","DesMoinesMike","Jul 19, 2010"
3.18,-9.7,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Sampled this one at Sam's Quick Shop alongside Sample A. Poured a crisp copper orange with barely any head. Aroma was sweet malts, spicy rye and a trace of hops. The taste is not much more than a standard Amber Ale with just a slight kick of rye, some caramel malts, slight rye spice and mild hops. The beer is crisp and smooth with decent carbonation. I have always been a fan of rye beers, but this one proved to be nothing special at all, it didn't come close to its Belgian IPA competition.","atsprings","Jul 16, 2010"
