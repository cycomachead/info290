Beer is light bodied and nicely carbonated and nice finish. Overall a very good beer.","cyclonece09","Mar 11, 2015"

4.63,14.9,4.5,4,5,5,4.5,"I know that I constantly contradict myself, but I am much more of a fan of AIPAs than APAs (generally), but second only to hops is rye, IMHO. I really dig what rye does for beer and rye whiskey is my Achilles Heel. I considered biting off the cap just to expedite matters, but then I sobered up, however briefly. I began with a very heavy-handed pour, resulting in over three fingers of dense, tawny head following a pseudo-cascade. Color was a coppery-amber (SRM = > 9, < 13) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled of peppermint, black pepper and caramel. I was ready to swoon! The peppermint and some of the black pepper were directly attributable to the use of rye while the sweetness was from the malt. Mouthfeel was full and creamy. The taste was minty, peppery, slightly sweet, but not by much. The finish was breathtakingly dry with the cool mintiness simply lingering following the swallow. This was a perfect example of why I love rye in my beer!","woodychandler","Jul 05, 2014"

3.81,-5.5,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,3.75," The taste is both fruity yeast with moderately bitter hop flavor almost grassy taste with light astringency from a citrus dominant hop profile. The taste of rye is pleasant but supports the hops mostly with a light sweetness in the taste. The alcohol is noticeable slightly in the taste but only as it increases in temperature with a mild tangerine taste of the hops combined with yeast. Overall this is an interesting beer it filled th glass with foam so I had to back off as I poured but intense with hops and a little warm for the strength. I consider this a decent rye beer as it is pretty quaffable and straddles the line of RYE pale and IPA.","Slatetank","Mar 23, 2014"
