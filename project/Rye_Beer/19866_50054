3.53,-9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"a very rye heavy saison that also happens to be brutally hopped and dark red in color with an inch or so of lasting white head with fine ring lacing as it drinks down. the nose here is spicy from the rye, rich from the darker roast on it, and drying weirdly. i get some caramel malt sweetness in there too though, and finally a huge blast of hops from the pine family with plenty of bitterness. the flavor is a lot like the nose, the rye is dominant and aggressive, almost clumsily so, overcoming whatever interesting saison yeast might be in this beer, its a straight up rye bomb. lots of hops too, which is strange in a saison like this. i don't taste red malt but i can feel its sweetness trying to fight the bitter of the hops, but it can't contend. the is a robustly flavored brew that could perhaps be toned down a bit, especially for it to show any signs of being a saison. apparently upright does open fermentation, which is cool of course, but ti does very little for this overzealous brew. fuller bodied, spicy, and bitter, a strange swallow and mouthfeel. bubbly enough. i respect it, but i won't buy it again.","StonedTrippin","Jan 19, 2014"

Thick mouth feel, crisp and dry finish after a sweet explosion of flavor--cherries, cinnamon, vanilla, smoke, spice. Ridiculously easy-drinking for such a complex beer. Finishes acidic, not sour but noticeably tart. I order this every time I can, at the brewery or elsewhere around town, and it never gets old. Amazing with almost any food, especially fatty meats / burgers. One of those beers that is just as good on a snowy day as it is on 80f and sunny days.

Chocolate, toasted malt, and slight tartness are in the forefront, but are followed by a long, dry aftertaste that is reminiscent of match heads and sulfur- oddly enough, this is not unpleasant. Complex, many flavor notes, but the mineral aftertaste is perhaps the most distinctive. Hop bitterness is noticeable underneath rich flavors of dark fruits, coffee and caramel.

Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a burnt orange/brown color with a couple inch light tan head that actually kept growing slowly for a few minutes after the initial pour. It took a while for the head to settle down before I could start drinking it. There's also a lot of lacing. Aroma is yeasty and fruity, it smells like pears, rye/dark bread, herbs, cloves, and apples. The brew tastes like dark bread/rye, pears, apples, cloves, caramel malt, and some dark fruit. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and is well carbonated. The carbonation is soft which helps make it easy to drink.

I am able to get the three other saisons from Upright, and I can’t wait to purchase them and try them as well.

Aromas of caramel, mango, cherry, biscuit, toffee, molasses, orange zest, pineapple, toast, and rye spiciness. Very nice and unique aromas with good balance, complexity, and strength. Taste of caramel, toast, molasses, biscuit, pepper, pineapple, chocolate, clove, earth, cherry, citrus, and rye spiciness. Light spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, molasses, cherry, chocolate, pepper, earth, toast, and rye spiciness on the finish for a bit. Great balance of flavors with nice complexity; fairly dry on the finish. High carbonation and medium body; with a fairly crisp, slick, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent rye saison! Great flavor complexity and balance; and very smooth a crisp to sip on.

3.62,-6.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear dark amber with a foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, rye, caramel, and some slight herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable but smells better than it tastes in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 01, 2012"
3.88,0,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Hmmm. A rye beer? This doesn't really strike me as such, in an American sense of the definition. The first thing I thought when looking at it and catching the fragrance was it seems like a dark Belgian ale. Upon tasting it, I'd have to say it seems to follow that suit. I'll judge this one on the quality of the beer, but as a rye, it falls short to me. Still very nice to drink.","RblWthACoz","Jul 19, 2012"

I later get notes of rye spiciness, chocolate, a slight sourness/funk. It finishes with a bit of lingering roasty/chocolate flavor and a nice sweetness. The flavor profile is very smooth with a bit of funk for a saison lover like me.

Wow, the flavor is a fun, unique trip melding a funky french style saison with a dark, malty rye ale. The front of the palate is coated by dark fruits and chocolately malt while the back is gripped by funk and yeast with spicy rye bread notes. Medium thick with light carbonation producing a creamy smooth body with a mild alcohol burn in the finish.

The house yeast is pretty prevalent in the nose, caramel malts, floral hops. The rye is very nuanced, taste is of raisins, light brown sugar, a bit of spice, with a dab of funk. Nicely carbonated mouthfeel with a sweet, dry finish. Not a heavy beer, but one shared bottle is enough for one night, not really a sessionable style.
