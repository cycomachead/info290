Flavor is spot on, like drinking a loaf of rye bread. Toasty hearty grain notes, spicy finish, long lasting bitterness.

It was lively on the tongue & there was no telltale "skunking in the brew. Toasted malt is what comes through under the nose & is solidified (or liquified) on the tongue to a very pleasent end. The labeling laudes rye as the star but I beg to differ. The brewers are first rate & withot their deft touch this could never have happened. I'm a traditionalist & this has opened up a new path for me. In the long run the flavor tires the taste buds, so perhaps a smaller can may beneifit the consumer, but don't let that stop you. Chill it, open it & enjoy it.","seedyone","Jul 30, 2014"

4.18,5.6,4,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Poured into an English pint it produced a one-finger head of moderately thick foam that came down to a fairly solid surface froth with very solid lacing. Color is clear dark amber with hints of dark honey and toffee and an appearance of solid carbonation. Aroma is a nice mix of malty, hop pine, and spice. It’s interesting to note that when I first drank this beer, I was unaware of the rye component to the brew, however, after reading up on the background of the beer, it actually comes across quite clear on the nose. Sometimes beer and liquor descriptions cause you to perceive things that are described in writing but aren't quite there in the glass, and sometimes they cause you to suddenly notice something that was there all the time. So, caramel and crystal malts seem to be there helping to produce a strong toffee aroma; the rye brings in an herbally, grassy, peppery-spice note; and the hops contribute a very, very light floral pine quality. All in all a sweet and appealing nose. Sip is sweet and malty up front with caramel, toffee, and mild hints of butterscotch alongside some grassy notes from the rye. Mid-palate sees the bitter notes come on strong - bitter hops, mild white pepper hints, and bitter cocoa. Back of the tongue and swallow see a strong bitterness matched with sweet cola, roasted pear, and toffee sensations. Finish is short and somewhat unimpressive, dominated by a generalized bitter dryness subtlety under-girded with rye notes. The balance is towards the bitter in this ale, and yet this is nonetheless a solidly constructed beer with enough smooth malt backbone to keep it from becoming a tannin bomb - in fact, it’s dangerously drinkable. Carbonation is a bit strong, but works perfectly in this case by breaking up some of the malt-y sweetness in spots. If I had to credit one thing that makes this such a superior beer it would be what a smooth and velvety mouthfeel it has, specifically in terms of the malty side of the equation. All-in-all, this is one terrific, subtlety complex, and dangerously drinkable brew. Furthermore, it's really interesting to see a brewery go in a different direction than super-hoppy IPAs with a rye beer.","8stringfan","Mar 02, 2014"

It begins with a warm, sweet lemony flavour similar to Jack D'or brewed by Pretty Things before a more leafy hop flavour takes over backed by a rather savoury biscuitiness (I guess that'll be the rye). It leaves a pleasant oily residue on the tongue, meaning the big hops really linger. It was a pity I only had time for a half pint (particularly at £1.79 per pint).","charlatan","Jan 23, 2014"

Lovely smells and tastes- lots of gently spicy rye and toasty malt that lends the beer a nice sweetness. Slight hints of chocolate that you get in rye sometimes. Not an uber rye like the founders, more restrained, and a bit sweeter and softer, but oh so balanced. Delicious.","Georgiabeer","Aug 24, 2013"

The hop qualities keep the palate interested and the gently sweet malt keeps it satisfied. The rye makes this beer. It is so well done and really shines with it's touch of sour alongside a perfect citrus tartness. Bold refreshing and brawny.","utopiajane","Aug 05, 2013"

Medium-bodied with great balance, the rye makes this beer slick and easy to drink. The hop flavors are minimal but they get the job done and there is some sweetness from the caramel as well.

In any case, this stuff pours a clear garnet topped by a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises lightly-toasted rye bread, light mint, light pine needles, and a tiny touch of mild cocoa. The taste brings in more of the same, with the emphasis placed squarely on the rye (unsurprising here). The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly creamy feel. Overall, a nice little rye beer, one that maintains a healthy hoppiness without allowing the hops to overcome all else. Not bad.","TMoney2591","Nov 17, 2012"

Earthy rye malt and citrus hops aromas compete for dominance, but there is no clear winner here. Medium bodied with assertive carbonation.

3.86,-2.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Found at Pies & Pints in Middlebury, CT this rye ale shows a pretty murky dark brown color with a sturdy near Guinness like head that is vaguely light tan colored. Lacing trails in a healthy cascade. The nose offers tangy rye-wheat and peppery citrus grain. Relatively mild but okay. The flavor brings on a much hoppier profile with tangy citrus/orange and buckwheat grain. There’s an interesting malt cream idea coupled with a crisp hop and rye grain medley. Feel is brisk with a energetic wave of carbonation, and body is a solid light-plus. Very refreshing and an adequate hop quotient worthy of a try.","Durge","Sep 14, 2012"

We found the nose to be a little weak in strength, and were expecting a more pronounced hops character. The taste followed the nose, and was also a bit dull. Here we were hoping for a more robust strength to the rye itself, rather than the rest of the malt bill, which we found to be on the adjuncty side. Otherwise this guy is refreshing, and decent for the style.","TheBrewo","Aug 17, 2012"

The aroma was a little odd for a rye beer, being slightly fruity and slightly indescribable. Taking the dive, the initial taste was orange with a mild flavor of rye drawing the attention of the side of the tongue. A hint of tea is also present. This might be an odd point of comparison, but I can't be the only person the chews on popsicle sticks after eating the popsicle. That said, something about the taste reminds me of chewing on the stick of a orange dreamsicle. There is a synthetic orange and a little woodiness. A smooth drinker, the aftertaste fades into a mild citric and hoppy taste. It lingers in the back of the throat, but does not make an overwhelming impression.","JohnnyHopps","Mar 22, 2012"

The brew smells like spicy rye, floral and citrusy (orange peel, grapefruit) hops, along with some caramel malt. It tastes like rye, floral and citrusy hops, and some earthy and caramel malt. There's also a nice lingering bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and has moderate carbonation. It's also easy to drink.

Only down side if the best buy date is on the can, this is good. Except that the can is in a closed package so you don't know the date until you get it home! Not sure why they would do it like this, but I understand they will put date on outside of package soon.

Taste is of malt, rye spice flavors, and some herbal/citrus zest hops. Very mild bitterness quickly fades from the palate. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly flat mouthfeel.

3.7,-6.6,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"16oz. can served in a Spiegelau nonic. Pours a deep caramel hue with a semi-hazy clarity and a half inch, creamy, loose, off-white head. Head eventually settles into a solid, quarter inch cap with thick swaths of lacing present during the tasting. Nose expresses rye, herbal aromas, citrus zest and some faint fruity esters. Taste is a bit on the acrid side - lots of bitter rind, more earthy rye and a trace of the light fruit suggested by the nose expresses itself towards the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a pleasant, crisp carbonation and a little bit of acidity. I haven't had too many rye beers, so can't really determine if this beer is to style or not - that said, my review is generally more to personal preference than style. As such, I generally found this beer to be decent, but not really my thing. The earthy bitterness is interesting, but quickly loses its appeal for me.","Jwale73","Aug 30, 2011"

4.15,4.8,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Body is a deep mahogany crimson red with a large biillowing creamy of white head, fine speckled lacing left behind forms quite nicely. An enjoyable drinking experience just visually, if that makes any sense. Aroma is full of spicy earthy rye notes with a back end citric pine hop nose. Looks like this clocks in at 57 IBUs, did I mention I'm really enjoying the pounder can format. Flavor is quaffingly bitter full of hops and spicy rye notes this is an in your face hopped up rye ale, the only better counterparts I've had are from Founders Red's Rye and Brew Kettle Red Eye RyePA. Each sip tastes better and better especially if you like rye and bitter pine cone hops, a bit of citrus pith but really crushing spruce tip bitterness with just hops and rye interplaying pretty awesome. Just enough sweetness to make it drinkable but really a dry finish for most of each sip. Mouthfeel is medium bodied slightly resinous with some hop oils making it through in texture, carbonation is smooth and not overdone really a nice drinking rye. I'm kind of sad only four came in my variety pack. Overall to reiterate what I've already said, kick ass spicy rye ale hopped up with pseudo spurce tips aka dank hops.","WVbeergeek","Aug 26, 2011"

You know there's Rye in there when you pour and see the beautiful red color, and the aroma supports the Belgian yeast with an aroma of dense malt and the smell of fall. The taste is rich malt with a big yeast profile and a nice hop taste and balanced bitterness.

3.35,-15.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Into the glass, Rye poured out a straight brown becoming a browwnish with hint of dark red in the liquid. It's dark enough. A stealth pour yielded only some minor cream colored bubbles that became nothing, no stick. Smell is deep on the roasted malt with a small whiff of rye. Hops are present although earthy smelling with a light dry hop appeal. Some caramel and that's about all. Taste is between a brown ale with Rye, which is probably what this is. A mix of roasted malt and tootsie roll with a small spicy rye in the middle with some bittering dry hops on the end. Grassy, earthy tasting. All of this comes and goes pretty quick with an earthy aftertaste. Feel is kinda bland, not watery, the body is a sturdy step from medium but it needs more bubbles. Comes off as dying yet not dead. I got through it but won't reach for it again.","BARFLYB","Aug 10, 2011"

A touch spicy and earthy. Fairly bitter on the palate, nice hop progression. Starts grainy, earthy, and bitter, ends long, hops focusing on tropical fruits and grapefruit rind. Very nice stuff, pleasant surprise pouring something so good out of a can.","JAXSON","Jul 27, 2011"

Aromas of caramel, chocolate, roasted malt, spicy rye, pine, and citrus. A lot of interesting aromas going on here, great stuff. Taste of caramel, rye, chocolate, pine, bread, nuttiness, and some citrus. Mostly malty sweetness on the front with a decent amount of bitterness on the finish that lingers for a bit with caramel, chocolate, bread, and pine. Medium-full bodied with medium carbonation. No alcohol noticed in the taste or finish. Decent amount of creaminess in the mouthfeel as well. Nice balance as well between sweetness and bitterness, with the sweetness being slightly stronger.

4.08,3,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Sixpoint distributing its four-packs of cans into NJ has been a Godsend. I've enjoyed all of them so far and this one is no exception. The dark ruddy amber and the cream-colored head that leaves excellent lacing makes for a great presentation. The smell and the taste are identical and the smack of pine coupled with the rye sour and spice make for a nicely crafted brew. Do not read that "sour" as the sour you get from lactobacillus...it's entirely different. So please no beer messages. The grains and the the hops are in great balance and the rye gives of a feel of the grain spirit, making this sometimes seem like it has more heat than it does. This beer can cut through even the spiciest of food and I've been enjoying it with a SPAM, rice and cheese concoction that I make with a bhut jolokia (ghost pepper) hot sauce. If it can stand up to all this grain, dairy and capsaicin then it can cut through anything.","Naugros","Jul 14, 2011"

The nose brings some light resinous pine hops and a bit of a citrus character as well. Good rye spice and a bit of caramel and toasted bread. The flavor is nice and hoppy with a good balance between it and the malt. Reminds me of a hoppy amber with a bit of rye spice. Nice pine throughout. Great balance between semi-sweet malt, rye spice, and hops in the mouthfeel. Medium body and slightly chewy with a bitter finish. Very, very solid offering.

4.32,9.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Oh wow, that's good. The subtlety of the rye in the aroma is more than made up for as the grains coat the palate with a hefty bite of spicy rye goodness. Hops do more than balance the malt, and coat the back of the tongue with bitter pine resin and tropical fruit flavors. A hint of medicinal-like, tangy booziness (despite the low ABV) is all that keeps Righteous Ale from a perfect 5.0 in the flavor department. Mouthfeel is crisp and sharp, with a well carbonated medium body. Overall, a fantastic Rye Beer...very much looking forward to the rest of the 4pack.","wagenvolks","Jul 04, 2011"

Nutty and bready, grapefruit and tangerine, slight hop spiciness, slight toffee. Drying texture, medium bodied with moderate carbonation, leaning towards creamy. Overall, very enjoyable.

4.95,25,5,5,5,4.5,5,"The Crack & Glug came off without a hitch and soon I had two foamy fingers of tawny head sitting there in defiance. This was a righteous beer! Color was 19 SRM, or how so many Lovibond, I have no idea. I would have said 14 or 15, max. Does anyone know what I am talking about? Probably not, which is one of my problems with putting TMI on labels. Color is very subjective and hard to calibrate, but there is a scale for beer color and this one weighs in at a measured 19 SRM. On the Woody Scale, it was a very deep-copper, approaching ruby with NE-quality clarity. BUPGOO, in its most righteous form! Nose was full-on black pepper and I will never forget nor stop thanking the most righteous Sopor for turning me on to Rye beers. He was also way ahead of the curve. The taxation of rye was what sparked The Whiskey Rebellion here in the US and if you really want a treat, try some Rye Whiskey. Smoooth! And so was this beer. It was like it was evaporating from my glass in terms of its smoothness. And the lacing ... thick, dense, requiring a jackhammer to remove. Finish was minty and peppery, but not pepperminty. Rye has its own bite, unlike any hops CAN impart. These guys really let the Rye Flag fly. Cooler? F**k no! I'm keeping it all in my fridge for those days when I come home from teaching and want to die. This will make me feel better.","woodychandler","Jun 16, 2011"

3.93,-0.8,4.5,4,4,3,4,"Righteous Ale pours a nice, clear mahogany color, and there are a few red-orange freckles shining through. The cream colored head comes up to almost three fingers in height, very nice in a smaller glass. Retention is above average, and the glass is absolutely coated in lacing. The nose is fairly solid, though the malty aspect of the beer doesn't really shine through. Instead the aromas of spicy, earthy rye and resinous, piney american hops commingle en route to my nose. The flavor gains balance and complexity relative to the nose, but at the expense of vibrancy of flavor. There's a definite dose of caramel up front before the rye and hops from the nose come in for the second half of the beer. Those flavors just don't seem as powerful as they did in the nose though. The mouthfeel is a bit off for me. The body is too big and rich and is paired with not enough carbonation. The result is a mouthfeel that doesn't have close to the levity that I like in a rye beer. Despite the lackluster mouthfeel, Righeous Ale is a fairly to very good rye beer, I'll be glad to have this one available in cans on a regular basis.","axeman9182","0"
4.12,4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall this is a solid rye. A quality hoppy presence and a clean malt bill allow the rye to add its qualities to the brew nicely. This is definitely my favorite in the style.","ColForbinBC","Jun 14, 2011"

The aroma has familiar Sixpoint yeast qualities as well as spicy rye notes and a nice blast of zesty hops. Tastes earthy and zesty, smokey from the rye. Really nice rye presence. With the addition of a fair amount of hops which are herbacious and zesty this beer has a nice taste balance. The mouthfeel is clean with a slight lingering bitter aftertaste.

It was delivered with a thin layer of creamy bone-white froth over the hazy copper body below. Clear notes of rye appeared in the nose, along with notes of malty-sweet dark caramel. Hops appeared, grassy, floral, and even piney...? or was that the influence of the rye crossing over?

We were at Dek's American, which had a pin sitting on the bar, and we were drawing healthy pints for the crowd. This amber-gold ale really had an interesting taste that I felt was a vast improvement over the regular tap version. Bearing the marks of a Sixpoint ale with the floral hops in the aroma, there was a slight cream taste matched by the twang of the rye malt.

Nice murky russet color, and an excellent foamy head that sticks around and leaves some rings of lacing. This is an awesomely complex beer. Super spicy, full of rye character and peppery notes. Also some sweet cinnamon and nutmeg, or maybe even clove. I never thought I'd say this about any beer but I was sort of reminded of a Fantome saison because of the sweet/spicy characteristics. A lot like the spicing in their Hiver or Printemps or something. Excellent. Also, it's got a really bitter hop kick towards the end with a great bone dry, yet somehow smooth and creamy mouthfeel.
