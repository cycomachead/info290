He's a good guy though, so I can't give him too much grief. Shows potential of what could have been, but unfortunately it's just too far gone. A certain candidate for re-review, but I doubt that will be anytime soon. PULL YOUR OUTDATED BREWS OFF THE SHELVES, DAMN IT!","TheSixthRing","Jan 13, 2015"

3.51,-7.1,,,,,,"Overall this was an okay beer. The bottles says "Rye lends spiciness to the caramel-malt base". I would have liked to feel more spiciness from this beer, as it was minimal. Also, I wish they brought out the caramel malt flavors more. I still don't think it would make this beer awesome, but I think it would be better if they did those things. Also, I don't know if I would have used piney hops. I would use other kinds of hops that are less piney for this beer. Again, I have been disappointed by yet another Hatter beer. I love New Holland, but don't think I've ever really liked any of their Hatters.","mchegash","Nov 06, 2014"

The taste is rye and light malt in the forefront. The piny hops kick in and the back of the palate and then it is rye and light malt in the finish. The mouth is slightly sticky and the hops and rye gently tickle the tastebuds. Not my favorite rye IPA,but still worth checking out.","Franziskaner","Jul 12, 2014"

4.02,6.3,4.25,4,4,4,4,"I had this on tap last year and loved it couldn't wait to try it again. This rye ale pours a slightly hazy copper red hue with a billowing and long lasting off white head that leaves a lot of lacing. The aroma is spicy and bitter. Notes of floral and citrus hops are accented by peppery and herbacious aromas. There is also a nice underlying malt sweetness that balances the entire nose. The mouthfeel is on the full bodied side of medium. Smoith but coating. The flavor is more bitter than the nose but still all the perceived aromas are present on the tongue. I can't quite put my finger on what citrus is present but its definitely there along with the spice, floral, and some pine. This is good, real good, and quite complex. There is almost a Belgian-y quality to it with all the spiciness and yet sweet and bitter flavors. Well done New Holland. Aside from the Imperial Hatter this may be my favorite of the Hatter series.","lochef81","Mar 21, 2014"

Aromas of grapefruit, orange zest, tangerine, floral, pine, spicy rye, caramel, grass, and floral earthiness. Very nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus hops with moderate rye/caramel malt balance; and good strength. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, tangerine, caramel, floral, pine, spicy rye, grass, and floral earthiness. Decent amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, caramel, spicy rye, floral, pine, grass, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of citrus hops with rye/caramel malts; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Rye pale ale! All around nice balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. Really enjoyed this one.","superspak","Jul 09, 2013"

3.68,-2.6,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Overall I thought this was an ok beer and an above average example of the style, it's not the best rye IPA, but it certainly isn't the worst. This beer had good drinkability, it was pretty smooth and the flavors held my attention, one bomber would be just the right amount. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and taste, they were both good and the hi light of this beer. What I liked least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was going in the right direction but when it got to the body it was just to thin, just like Mad Hatter. I don;t think I would buy this beer again, I can think of a couple of Rye IPA's that I would rather have, but I would still recommend giving it a try. All in all this beer was better then I expected, I don't like Mad Hatter so I didn't think I would like this one, but it wasn't bad, but it did suffer from the same thing that Mad Hatter had with a thin body that doesn't work well with this beer, but it was good enough to get people that don't like IPA's to drink it so I have to give it credit. This was a decent beer, but nothing too memorable, I might just have to check out the rest of the series to see if there's anymore surprises.","StoutHunter","0"

4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"22oz bottle, poured into my New Holland 20oz glass. Ale is hazy copper with a tall, frothy off-white head tat holds great retention and leaves lots of chunky lacing on the glass. Aromas are citrus, grapefruit, caramel, fresh pine, floral hop, lemon zest, faint rye in the background. Tastes are complex and juicy with earthy, spicy, peppery rye on the forefront, followed by caramel, toasted grain, pine, and grapefruit. Some faint acetylsalicylic acid on the finish also. Mouth-feel is medium bodied, and the piny hop resins coat the palate and linger on the finish. Overall, I am now satisfied with this beer, and glad I didn't write it off. I love rye beers and was very disappointed after last year's run. This was good, and exactly what I was expecting from New Holland.","barnzy78","Jun 14, 2012"

A light nose of citrus hopping on top of gentle rye spiciness, standard caramel malt, all things presented in nose are exactly what I get in the taste as well. Finish resembles the standard bittering taper down of a typical APA. The only nitpick I have is that the sweetness of the malt seems about 10% too low to be in perfect balance with the hops and rye sting. Other than that, a nice refreshing effort, just a bit more subdued than I had expected.","WastingFreetime","Aug 24, 2011"

An initial flavor of toasted malt, contributing very little-to-no sweetness, is quickly washed away by bracingly resinous, citrusy hops. Bitterness is quite high.

Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is a bit weak but still OK, the brew smells like pine, citrusy and spicy hops, along with a bit of bready malt. Luckily it tastes stronger than the aroma. It tastes like spicy, pine and citrusy (lemon peel) hops, and some caramel and bready malt. The rye gives this brew a nice kick of spice. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and is well carbonated. Easy enough to drink, too. I think this is a decent enough brew, it's better overall than the Oak Aged Mad Hatter I tried right before this.

4.07,7.7,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Part of the new "Hatter" series.Poured into an imperial nonic a dull slightly hazed burnt orange tinged copper with a large fluffy two finger slight off white head atop.Love the aromas,bold spicy rye mixed with sharp citric hops,its no holds barred aroma wise.Sharp and a little tingly in the mouth and on the lighter side,a good mix of citric hops and spicy rye,there is a bit of toastiness in there.A solid American style rye beer,loaded with citric hops and full on spicy rye.","oberon","Jun 07, 2011"
