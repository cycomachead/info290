3.68,4.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a nice 2-3 finger dense off white head with fantastic retention that reduces to a thick cap. Some decent lacing on the glass. There was a slow cascade of carbonation as I poured this. Aromas of big pine, rye spiciness, biscuit, herbal, caramel, and citrus. Some nice and well balanced aromas. Taste of big rye spiciness, caramel, biscuit, herbal, grapefruit, pine, and earthiness. Strong bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of rye spiciness, biscuit, caramel, and citrus for a bit. Good balance of flavors. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slightly thick mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is a nice and very enjoyable rye offering. Apparently this bottle was a bit old, but it held up nicely!","superspak","Jan 17, 2012"

3.83,8.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. It tasted more like an IPA to me.

Just my opinion","king75","Oct 11, 2011"

3.15,-10.8,4,1.5,4,3.5,3,"Overall, if this beer could do anything about the aroma, it would be the easiest way to improve the brew. I found it took the whole experience down with it. The beer is pretty decent, but every sip introduces itself with a foul smell. I would have no problem having a few more of these if they did something to change it.","BBP","Oct 07, 2011"

4,13.3,4,4,4,4,4,"M: Very chewy, a malt explosion. The late hop infusion doesn't change the rye-centric nature. If you like rye, you should enjoy this one; the rye gets center stage.","akorsak","Sep 20, 2011"
3.57,1.1,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Good introduction for those unfamiliar with ryes. It has the allure and familiarity of a pale but allows you to enjoy the rye flavors as the sips taper off. Sad I only got to enjoy a single bottle.","TheStove","Sep 11, 2011"

3.46,-2,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Medium bodied with a strong earthy hop presence up front that provides dry bitterness that lingers over the malt backbone into a slightly dry finish.  Floral and earthy with some pine and soil notes.  Vegetal with a funky farmhouse feel countered by a sweet malt backbone which is a touch too strong.  Hints of rye, caramel toffee and biscuit.  An interesting experiment but it's somewhere in between a hoppy golden ake, rye pa and a farmhouse ale.  Abv well masked and easy to drink but a strange combo of flavors.  ","corby112","0"
2.48,-29.7,3.5,3,2,2.5,2.5,"Pours a hazy honey orange with a 2 inch puffy bone colored head that settles to a small cap. Foamy rings of lace stick to the sides of the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus zest, malt, and some rye aromas but all very subdued. Taste is mainly of watery grains and a medicinal bitterness. Pretty gross in my opinion. The bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation and is somewhat flat. Overall, this is not a very good beer as the bitterness is very bracing and medicinal in nature.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 07, 2011"
3.41,-3.4,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O: Not so sure about this beer. The flavor and aroma profiles are quite limited, but what is present is very bold and assertive. Not bad, but I think I'd pass on having another.","Florida9","Jul 30, 2011"

3.62,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall- I really wanted to like this one, but unfortunately apart from the rye and slight hoppy flavours there was not a whole lot going on here. The aromas were a bit more promising but the tastes just didn’t come through the same, maybe people who love their rye beers would really appreciate this one but I just couldn’t find too much out of it other than the rye and slight hoppy aromas. Would not go out of my way to get this one again and definitely not a top offering from a great brewery like Short’s in my opinion.","Roke87","Jul 12, 2011"
3.16,-10.5,4,3,3,3,3.5,"O: This could have been much better if the bitterness as not so harsh. Lots of bitter without a lot of taste or aroma. I love Rye-IPAs but this one was a let down for me.","jmich24","Jul 01, 2011"

3.94,11.6,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"The appearance clear golden color with thin white head. The nose is dominated by pine. The taste is quite unique the rye seems to be fighting the hops as to who will win the pallete cling....in the end the bitter grapefruit taste lingers. The mouthfeel is good....but it is an explosion of flavor. Definitely worth a try!!!","WoodBrew","Jun 19, 2011"

4.12,16.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"O- It's another bold offering from Short's (experimental even?). It's not a beer I'm going to drink in quantity, but it certainly fits the "super hopped golden rye beer" to a "t." As a big fan of rye bread (pastrami or ruebens anyone?), I really like this brew.","GRPunk","Jun 18, 2011"
2.92,-17.3,3.5,4,2.5,3.5,2,"Overall I thought this was a pretty lack luster beer. I knew going in to this that it was a Rye beer, I just wasn't expecting the rye to be that bold and dominating, I didn't hate all that rye but it could have been toned down a little. The hops imparted lots of nice aromas but when it came to the flavor all it did was add a really heavy Imperial Pilsner like bitterness to it that I thought was way too much for this beer. I don't think I would purchase this beer again it just really didn't do it for me. If you are a die hard rye fan you may want to seek this out but other then that it doesn't have much going for it. I wasn't all that impressed with this beer and out of all the different short's beers I have tried this is my least favorite to date, I guess you can't win em all Short's.","StoutHunter","Jun 15, 2011"
3.03,-14.2,4.5,4,2.5,3,2.5,"Overall this beer was a big disappointment. Perhaps people that are die hard rye beer lovers would enjoy it, but for me it seemed like it was really heavy handed. Personally, I will chock this one up to being a poor beer from an excellent brewery.","zoso1967","Jun 10, 2011"

I would definitely like to give this one a shot on draft sometime though to see how it compares.","Kegatron","0"
3.3,-6.5,4,4,3,4,2.5,"2.5 D: I wouldn't recommend this for anyone other than a seasoned IPA drinker and even then it's still a bit tough to get all the way through. Mouth destroyingly bitter. Good hop flavor, but much of the rest is covered up by hops.","DavoleBomb","Sep 10, 2010"
3.37,-4.5,3.5,4,3,4,3,"Amber color with one finger of head that quickly settled to a thin cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the the glass. The aroma is a combination of rye malt and piney hops. Sort of has a Pine-Sol aroma. I do not know what happened to the flavor. Has an astrigent flavor that is hard to get past. The rye and hops do not work that well together. Maybe not the best combination of ingredients. The other malt does not show up. Medium body with a nice carbonation. Good texture. The flavor falls short. I would not buy this again.","morimech","Aug 30, 2010"

3.35,-5.1,4,4,3,3.5,3,"The beer tastes kind of bland to me. There's definitely a lot of peppery rye but it's missing balance as there are no sweet flavors from the malts or fruitiness from the hops. Kind of a dud taste-wise. The body's a little heavier than anticipated too, odd at such a low ABV with so little sweetness. Worth a try but only once.","TurdFurgison","Aug 06, 2010"
3.55,0.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Good stuff. I enjoyed Rich's Rye, but it seems like the bar for hoppy beers is raised higher and higher everyday and as such I can't give it too great a rating. Still, I'm glad its occupying my glass and I would gladly drink it again.","BradLikesBrew","Aug 04, 2010"

3.48,-1.4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a fairly standard and non-descript amber/brownish color with a small amount of head that leaves minimal lacing.

3.8,7.6,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Overall a good ale that still tastes & feels like a amped-up pale ale. The texture of this beer is very interesting because on one hand it feels flat, but on the other it's very airy & soft. There's a little hop burn on the inside of my cheeks that lingers for quite a while. Maybe it's the inherent spiciness from the rye malt, (I bet?). I bet the IBUs on this are very high too. Leave it to Short's to make you ponder after you've consumed one of their offerings. Good work on a very unique beer.","malty","Jun 29, 2010"
