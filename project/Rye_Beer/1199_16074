Nice maroon color and head that creates a nice lacing.  Avoid if you don't like rye.  But if that is good for you, it is a great alternative to super hoppy west coast ipas.","BigH75","Mar 20, 2015"

Aroma is grapefruit, herbal hop, rye spice, and caramel malt. Taste is light malty sweetness all the way through, piney and floral bitterness, spicy rye bite, and some citrus fruit. Medium body, creamy texture, moderate carbonation, and a bitter spicy finish.","SierraFlight","Feb 24, 2015"

Taste is bittering hops up front and on the sides mingling with the rye giving it that zing of white pepper and an even body. Malt sweetness on the back makes it nicely rounded with bittering hops coming through on the aftertaste. Many love this brew, I personally love rye brews, yet the hops are a bit strong to my liking. Hop heads dream.","Brutaltruth","Jul 10, 2014"

Once you taste this beer you can taste the hops as well as some slight citrus flavors. This also has a good amount of hops, but does have a very strong aftertaste.","phartman133","Apr 21, 2014"

My pour had a fairly small white head. Smell as happy with some grapefruit and a little lemony. Taste was similar to that as it was flavorful and happy with a citrus kick but decently balanced. This was my first time having this beer and I was very happy with it. When available on tap, I will definitely get again. Solid brew from founders","eepound2","Apr 20, 2014"

Red's Rye IPA is a hop-and-rye forward beer that doesn't focus directly on one ingredient or the other but melds the two in harmony as grapefruit, earthy, and floral attributes blend with the spicy rye over biscuity, bready malt for a superb balance considering it's listed IBUs. At a fair 6.6%, this full-flavored beer packs a wallop without walloping the imbiber; one hell of a combination!","BeerFMAndy","Feb 10, 2014"

3.84,-8.1,4,3.75,3.75,4,4,"This ale pours a deep mahogany color with a very small Head that lasts just a minute or so. The aroma is all rye, malt, and spice. There is little to no hint of hops or of the ipa qualities of this beer. It's Sips dry and a little rough with a bit of alcohol bite on the tail end. The body is a bit thin for this type of ale. The flavor is definitely rye and a lot of malt. Almost more like a porter than an ipa. There is virtually no hoppiness at all. Overall this is a very good beer (still rarely disappointed by Founders). It's just not what I expect from a rye ipa. Hits on the rye notes but not on the ipa ones.","lochef81","Jan 14, 2014"

The rye flavor tends to be overpowered by the hops, assuming a more background presence in the flavor profile. A bit less hops would improve the balance and bring the rye more forward. Slight, but pleasant, hop bitterness as an aftertaste while the rye becomes more pronounced. Another excellent Founder’s product.","tillmac62","Oct 11, 2013"

The Rye just adds a little something, a little breadyness, a little something different...but still really good. It has all the aromas you expect from a great IPA, Grapefruit, Mango, Pine. The malt bill seems much higher than a typical IPA so you get a really good malt sweetness to counter the bitter hops. Dry finish only leaves you wanting another sip. If you haven't had it, try it.","ausch30","Oct 04, 2013"

The heartless bastards at Founders have made it a seasonal brew for some unknown an obviously insufficient reason. Had it on tap at Founders brew pub which was a slice of heaven, but by the bottle it is extremely close to fresh tap taste. Founders is awesome and I highly recommend this heavenly brew to just about anyone as the maltiness and hop finish are sublimely and superbly blended to achieve party in your mouth status...it is just about perfect for beer lovers of most types.

I love the spiciness imparted by the rye, as well as the earthiness, rather than excessive sweetness, on part of the predominant malts. Would love to try this fresh, but it seems to be good any time.

Since I'm only an hour or so away from the Founders' Brewhaus, breaking and entering doesn't seem half bad.","ShreddedThumb","May 12, 2013"

Tastes of bitter citrus hops, pine and grain. Citrus hops are grapefruit and orange peel. Malt flavors are light, but some creaminess comes through bitterness. Subtle notes of grass, ginger, cinnamon, apple. Grains are earthy but with some nut meat. Overall a superbly bitter IPA with much more grain and earthy tones than your average IPA. Also more pine notes and strength in the hops than your average IPA, but what drastically sets this IPA apart from the pack is the grains.","SeamusDoyle","Jan 20, 2013"

The hops is masked a bit too much at first sip; however I did pick up the customary IPA bitterness at the end. There was a tad too much rye on the front end and not a sufficient amount of hop bitterness for my taste. I enjoy all the other Founders brews, but have to put this one at the back of the bus. Having said that, while I would never go out of the way to pick up a six pack or growler, I would certainly order it at one of our Atlanta area beer bars if the other draught offerings were sub-par.","Hopprof","Jan 12, 2013"

The Michigan hop-head aesthetic is in full bloom here. Bell's Brewery has been setting the pace on these over-blown hop styles. The problem with this Rye PA is that the hops get masked by the rye grain charateristic. Sort of a train-wreck. Malty sweetness isn't evidenced by intent, but the result of this combination is sort of a sharp mush of bitterness. Over many beers this would escalate with growing fatigue on the palate. I've tried this on two occasions- once in the tap room at Founders and once at a bar in Ann Arbor. I did not finish either pint. Exceptionally poor label art too for Founders on this as well.","monkbrewed","Jan 09, 2013"

4.12,-1.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Dark amber orange with an off white head that is relatively thin but throws a lot of lace. The smell makes it immediately clear that this is an IPA. Intense hop aroma mainly of the citrus and pine variety are dominant with caramel maltiness and rye spiciness providing the base. The taste too is upfront hop bitterness and flavor with the citrus really packing a punch. Next the malt comes in with a bit of caramel and rye balancing the hops. Balancing may be a bit of an overstatement because this one remains on the bitter end of the spectrum throughout, even the finish is tinglingly bitter. The body of this beer is medium with low to medium carbonation. There is a bit of a stickiness to this but it's definitely not sweet because again the hop character sticks around throughout leaving a dry tingle at the finish. Overall I'm very satisfied with this beer. Maybe not exactly sessionable but I'm having a hard time putting the glass down.","fank2788","Nov 10, 2012"

3.68,-12,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Red's Rye Pale Ale arrives ruby red in the glass, with a bit of clarity and some lighter red highlights. Almost two fingers of foam crowns the beer, and while it fades quickly at first, the last third or so hangs on for a while. There's definitely some lacing left clinging to the glass, but I'd classify it as spotty. The nose is disappointingly mild, but a bit of caramel plays off spicy grapefruit notes as aromas from the hops and rye meld together. The beer's a little more robust once it hits my palate. A prominent caramel note greets me, before a mild bitterness segues nicely into the spicy touch from the rye. The hoppy finish has some citrus, but also a more dank, pine-y aspect to it. The body is just too chewy for my taste, and as a result the carbonation struggles to cut through it all and make an impression. Red's Rye PA is a decent offering, but doesn't quite measure up to the quality of most Founders brews.","axeman9182","Nov 06, 2012"

Aromas are great with notes of floral, citric, piny hops, rye malt, and carameley sweetness. Tastes of peppery rye hit the palate up-front followed by strong piny astringency and bitterness from the hops. Notes of pungent grapefruit rind, caramel, aspirin, and peppery spiciness battle in the mouth, while being crisp yet finishing dry. Overall, always a favorite of mine, and one of the best rye beers out there.","barnzy78","Mar 24, 2012"

Flavor follows with big up front bitter, but quickly runs smooth on the palate into a spicy rye accented by toffee and biscuit malts. The pine comes back into play as it goes down the gullet. Medium mouthfeel, a bit dry on the finish. Plenty of carbonation. This beer is pretty awesome.","BMMillsy","Feb 15, 2012"

4.33,3.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Rye beer seems to be on the rise, and this one is at the top of the small but growing heap that I've tried lately. It's a good alternative to the amber/altbiers that are everywhere these days, and this one is especially worth hunting down. The aroma is stiff with hops, but this sharp edge is filed down nicely in the taste by the rye. The finish is pleasantly dry, in that IPA-dry manner, but it won't have you crawling across the floor, gasping for air as you reach for your humidifier. Nice.","gfreed","Feb 10, 2012"

It didtnt produce a strong aroma like I expected but you get nice hoppy/tropical fruits. It has a nice smooth mouth feel that is mildly hoppy upfront, but you get a spice from the rye towards the end that highlights the hops. Im not a big fan of rye beers but I love this beer.

Rye, while a component of the malt bill, successfully joins an ensemble whose range includes toasty, caramel, and even slightly roasty qualities. Hops are companionable to other flavors, joining with English yeast metabolites especially well. This is an ale in the truest sense; an ale for all seasons and occasions.","beagle75","Nov 27, 2011"

4.23,1.2,4.25,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a pretty damn good example of the style, sometimes rye can be a little overpowering but Founders kept that in check nicely with a good amount of tasty citrus hops and that worked out pretty well. This beer had good drinkability, it was pretty smooth and the flavors did a good job at holding my attention, I can drink around three of these but that seems to be my limit for this beer, it's a good beer for just about any season. What I liked the most about this beer was how balanced it was, it had a good amount of rye and hops in it, but neither of them were too overpowering and that made for a really nice beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it wasn't bad at all, but the creaminess did through me off a little. I would buy this beer again, I don't buy it often, but when I feel like a Rye Beer it makes for a pretty good and affordable choice, I recommend this to just about anyone and it's a must try if your a fan of Rye Beers. All in all I was happy with this beer, it's pretty damn solid and that's what I have come to expect from this brewery. It sucks that Founders decided to make this a seasonal, I will miss being able to buy it year around, but I often forgot about it which won't be happening when it turns to a seasonal, but Founders has to make tough decisions sometimes and I respect that, but it still sucks. Good job guys, it's nice to have a world class brewery like Founders in Michigan, they make some damn good beer.","StoutHunter","Nov 26, 2011"

4.17,-0.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours a rust, burnt orange, red color with a light khaki-colored head. About two centimeters of foamy bubbles form during the pour, and large strands/patches of sticky lacing cling to the glass as the level subsides. The ruby hues in this one are gorgeous. The aroma is of rye, ample caramel malt, grapefruit, orange, and some faint herbal notes. The caramel really shines through in the nose, reminiscent of a malty amber. The taste is similar, but with an added emphasis on the citrus, especially at the end. The rye is balanced well with the caramel flavors, and some muddled herbal undertones round it out nicely. Mouthfeel is exceptional; smooth going down, crisp on the tongue, and a finish that leaves you wondering if you really did just take a drink. Certainly one that keeps you coming back, and just a great beer overall.","eclipse54","Oct 18, 2011"
4.45,6.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours an inviting tawny red color, & the beer retains a carbonated head quite well. The aroma is incredible - bright fruity hops, creamy caramel, malt sugar, and a savory undertone. The taste is very complex - it thrilled my tastebuds! The flavor begins sweet and spicy all at once. It's fresh towards the middle and fades to a dry and pleasant bitterness - leaves one wanting more. Light mouthfeel. Compares very favorably to other Rye beers.","Neorebel","Oct 17, 2011"

4.42,5.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a nice dark amber, not cloudy but definitely opaque. Off white head that lasts and lasts. Nose is really nice, lots of citrus and a touch of pine. A hint of rye spiciness and a surprisingly strong malt backbone. As it opens up I get a touch of earthiness, it actually reminds me of a McDonald's hashbrown. Taste is strongly bitter but not overpowering. It is balanced with spice and a small amount of caramelly malt. Mouthfeel is perfect for the style, good carbonation.

4.3,2.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A cloudy deep orange brown colored brew with a healthy big bubbled off-white head and modest lacing. The aroma says cat piss hops, a little grassy citrus bite and a little caramel malt sweetness. The flavor brings sharp hop bite, lemon and grapefruit over what I find to be a proper rye bread touch. It’s finely but prominently carbonated in a medium-light bodied brew. Awesome!","Durge","Sep 24, 2011"
4.17,-0.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Really nice beer, and big when it comes to flavour. Plenty of complexity to make it interesting, and nicely balanced.

4.15,-0.7,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"O- While it's no Nugget Nectar, I can easily say that this is the second best Rye beer I've had to date. It has just enough citrus notes to break the mold of the malty rye style and I prefer it to any of the Founders IPAs. Great beer.","jm1229","Sep 10, 2011"

4.17,-0.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer were the extremely bold hop components. The floral, and citrus came together nicely here to yield a brew both earthy and refreshing. Where this one lost points was in the diminished “red rye” components. It instead seemed more like a unique IPA or DIPA, with the hop components really taking the front seat here, and the grain and spice taking the back seat.","TheBrewo","Aug 18, 2011"

Reminds me of a freshly squeezed grapefruit balanced with malt sweetness and a touch of rye. The taste of hoppy grapefruit is balanced by a spicy rye kick and ends with a bitterness turned sweet. Just a touch of chewiness and a drizzle of honey to round out this engaging, interesting, complex brew. A real treat.","elNopalero","Aug 17, 2011"

However, a strong hop presence really seems like it would dominate the beer in any form. Currently, the hop serves more as a preservative than a flavor ingredient.

It’s that kind of ale.","JTSbeerislife","Aug 15, 2011"

This beer works well on many levels. It has visual appeal with a deep red/amber color with a great off-white head that laced well. The nose is nice and hoppy with some malt and rye bleeding through. Palate is outstanding from start to finish. Spicy rye and bitter piney hops blast the taste buds and are complimented nicely by the flavorful caramel malts. Finish is semi-dry and very bitter.

3.65,-12.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - A pretty standard hoppy red ale. The aroma is very nice with lots of green, pungent hops and enough malt to to hint at the thick sugary character of the flavor profile. The caramel and toffee that dominate the malt character work nicely with the pine and grapefruit hops but never become excessive. My only complaint is the way the bitterness becomes sharp and almost overwhelming in the finish, to the point that some soapy notes linger on the palate after everything else fades away. This last impression kind of ruins the drinkability of an otherwise very nice beer.","nickfl","Jun 17, 2011"

3.61,-13.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"I am excited to try this since I haven't had a rye since Mild Winter. Pours a rich copper/amber with specks and a sizable tan head that leaves great lacing. The smell is strong on the hops, grapefruity, mingled with a sweet malt aroma, with a soft wave of rye following. Nice and bitter but I have a hard time detecting the rye amongst the very strong hopping. Smooth body amongst crisp carbonation, refreshing in it's own. This beer is great, can satisfy many a hophead, but I want more rye.","wcintula","May 10, 2011"

4.23,1.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Taste, pleasantly surprised just how much rye went into this. Hopped well, but not trying to be an ipa either. Well, a little bit. Reminiscient of nugget nectar, not as bitter, but less in the appearance of a red as well. Great interplay between the rye flavor, caramel and the amarillo hops, ample bitterness is swallowed by the rye I suspect, all in all, it flows well together.","Beerandraiderfan","May 04, 2011"
3.92,-6.2,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours dark copper with a whitish head that sticks around. Very hoppy nose with floral and citrus notes - a touch of pine. The mouth is a little thin for my tastes. You definitely get the rye character with a nice robust hop profile. Finishes relatively clean. A nice example of a solid rye ale - not life changing - but definitely worth a sample.","raszputini","May 02, 2011"

4.25,1.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Served from bottle into a Grolsch Pilsner. Poured red-orange with a half finger off-white head that remained throughout. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, subtle grain, and subtle citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, and slight grain. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. If I am honest this might have been the best Rye Beer offering I have had to-date. Very nicely balanced and enjoyable. The citrus aspect really blended well with the grain aspect going on here. The aroma was very nice as well on this one.

Nose has grapefruit pith upfront along with pine resin, light malt sweetness to go along with some spicy grain. The taste has some a nice malty richness to go along with rye bread, citrus and pine forest. Finishes with a touch of resin and pretty dry and bitter on the finish compared to the malt upfront. Pretty straightforward beer, definitely good but not really that special.","Trilogy31","Apr 26, 2011"

4.25,1.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Had this on tap at Shark Club in Howell. Pours a deep amber-brown colour with thick off-white head. Tons of lacing down the glass.

Nice tannish head and decent lacing iny tasting glass. The smell is awesome. Herbal delight of malts and citrus. The taste is great too. O don't always pick up on subtleties but this is a complex brew. Nice bitterness of hops and citrus a sweetness and cooked malt combination. Well worth rhecweek waiting for delivery.

4.45,6.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured into a mug a nice dark semi cloudy copper with red tints, good amount of off white foamy head. Nose is dominated by sharp citrus hops, floral auroma with a great balance of spicy notes and sweet malt. Taste follows the nose, nice rye blend that is subtle and replaced with sharp hops that are bitter at first and mellow leaving a dry finish. Has a resemblance to an Imperial Amber flavour, packs alot of flavour. Great tasting beer! Chewy and dry mouthfeel, medium bodied. I love the label of this beer. Overall, nice drinkability / abv. that rounds out a very quality beer from the makers of Founders. The rye is subtle enough to keep it an interesting flavour profile and the hops bring the brew to another level.","heebes","Mar 30, 2011"

Based on the aromas this beer gives off, if I didn't know any better I'd guess this was an IPA and not a PA. It begins bitter before ending sweet and malty. It has excellent flavor which tends to be more on the malty side. The hops aren't as big of a characteristic as they could be. It is sweet and has a "different" accent to it as well, I'm guessing that's the rye. It drinks very crisp and has good carbonation. It's between light and medium in body and drinks well. It's very good for the style and an exceptional brew.","aasher","Feb 01, 2011"

I might be a bit partial, seeing this beer comes from my hometown, (I did not know it until I tasted it and got curious about where it was brewed), but that withstanding, this is a good, unique beer. This is about to be my favorite style. This brew gave me about a one finger head of light brown suds and finally faded after about two minutes, the color is a rich dark amber-red rating a 26 on the SRM chart. The smell of apple, grapefruit, currant, rye, caramel, sweet malt, and raspberry are the strongest smells, with a hint of clover. This is a wonderful flavor far from your run of the mill brew. This beer has the flavor of grapefruit, berries, apple, malt, and finishes with a great bitter flavor of hops. The more I drink of this the better I like it. I am so glad I have access to this in the south. Feels like cream in my mouth, nice tingle and buzz as it passes over my tongue and down my throat. I only bought one bottle of this, but it sure won't be my last, and next time it will be in bigger quantities.

Pours a deep translucent, unfiltered, reddish copper color, with a thick frothy head. The beer didn't quite smack me with the smell of fresh hops I was suspecting when I cracked it, and I think this beer is fairly fresh, and I can smell a sweet malty backbone. The taste is of grapefruity hops, you can tell it was dry hopped, has that extra-deep pungent layer of hops in there you get from the process, that extra pucker at the end in the aftertaste. But I don't pick up much rye in there, yet there is a maltiness to round out the hoppiness going on here. The label mentions rye, and belgium malts, but honestly, and it could all be due to a slight lack of freshness (please start date stamping these!?), I am a little disappointed with the lack of complexity in the taste of this brew. I love Amarillo hops too! I think it was fresh cause I bought it from a decent store with good turnaround, etc. I know what hoppy beers taste like when they fade....but overall, this is a pretty good beer that I found pretty darn drinkable, despite my complaints. But where is the rye (hell, even always watery Goose Island Mild Winter has way more rye than this)? Oh wait, I taste it, hmm, or did I...and those belgian malts, really?","Star80","Sep 11, 2010"

Nice big earthy, herbal nose with hints of toffee, caramel, citrus and rye. The taste is very unique and has a lot going on. The bitterness of the hops hits you first, but is nicely offset by a solid roasty, caramel malt backbone. Hints of tea, pine, grass, resin, toffee, and of course rye. The rye really comes to the forefront as it warms. Great chewy and resiny mouthfeel makes this quite drinkable for me. The spicy rye bitterness is there from start to finish.

Tasted pretty darn amazing as well--a beer crafted for me it seems as I love rye beers and all their spiciness, and yet I crave the hop assault of the DIPA. This was both, and yet strangely drinkable. I wouldn't want to drink them all night, but I'd like to have two or three a night pretty much every night of the week! Hops hops hops and rye (obviously) with just enough countering malt character to go down real smooth. Nice carbonation. Give me more! Love this one even more than the Centennial, and you can't compare it at all to the Breakfast Stout (the other Founders' I've tried), but everything I've had from them is phenomenal. Tastes a lot like Bear Republic's Hop Rod Rye, which is a great thing and each are one of my favorite brews. Wish there were more "RyePA"s out there as good as these ones.

Head exhibits good retention with thick swaths and strands of lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses sweet citrus notes on a toasted malt backbone with the merest suggestion of caramel. Taste is somewhat consistent with nose; however, sweetness is somewhat muted and an even bitterness comes out. Malt profile is a little more flat and earthy (the rye definitely makes itself known here) and finishes with a light, lingering bitterness.

The taste was overall fantastic, it had a very nice combition of malts, and hops, and maybe a pine flavor as well. It had a very strong taste that lasted much after you finished this beer, and it was easy to drink too. Overall another fantastic beer from a fantastic brewer, would love to have this one again.","vette2006c5r","Jul 29, 2010"

Lots of citrus in the nose from the Amarillo hops with a good mix of caramel malts. Lots of doughy rye malts ride the palate with a nice spicyness at the end. Very full mouthfeel with a smooth chewy texture. This is a very good overall beer that I will have to get more of next time.","ballz50401","Jul 15, 2010"
3.93,-6,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Poured this into my tulip. Pours a nice ruby color with patches of visible carbonation that look great. A rocky off white head sits atop this beer at about two inches! Huge! Sticky lacing all along. The nose is full of citrus with a the hint of rye. The front-runner on this is a big sweet pink grapefruit smell. Great citrus flavor with a bit of hop bittering for the finish. A little bit spicy though. I immagine that is due to the rye. Overall though this taste great. A really nice mouth feel to this one. Good carbonation and a medium body. Not bad to drink but I think it is a bit spicy so that brings it down for me a bit.","Bendurgin","Jul 13, 2010"
4.03,-3.6,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Who's Red? Probably some filthy Commie... This beer pours a clear ruby-amber topped by nearly two fingers of ecru froth. The nose comprises pine needles, tangelos, creamy caramel, and a touch of peppery rye. The taste kicks up the rye a great deal, though it is still not allowed to take any position of preeminence. Instead, it shares the spotlight in a vigorous tango with hop elements that themselves gracefully combine the talents of pine and ruby red grapefruit. It's quite a dance, particularly set against the backdrop of sweet caramel. The body is a fluffy medium, with a light carbonation and a very creamy feel. This beer begs to be continually consumed and returned to. Thankfully I've got the rest of this growler to help me with that...","TMoney2591","Jul 11, 2010"

Smells like a spicy IPA with some nice caramel malt undertones and spicy piney hops. Great floral aroma as well. Taste is on point with typical founders hops. Nice spicy character, would pair well with bbq ribs and burgers. rustic rye component gives a nice earthy undertone. Nice carbonation and coats the palate well with a great aftertaste that lingers.

4.3,2.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a pretty amber brown color with a pillowy tan head that slowly settles leaving a sheet of lacing on the glass. The aroma is quite hoppy, with grapefruit and pine standing out. There is a touch of pepper and candied fruit. The taste is of a solid bready malt with some light caramel notes. This is followed by a grapefruit forward hop profile which also has notes of pepper and candied tropical fruit. There is some nice balance between the malt and hops; everything comes together for a nice spicy profile. Red's Rye is moderate to full bodied with tingly carbonation; finishes with a hoppy bitterness and dry. A hoppy rye brew that is supported by bready malt. Nothing is over the top but there are some big flavors. Very well made.","Gmann","Jun 24, 2010"

The aroma has fresh and juicy hop notes upfront, along with rye, caramel, citrus, toasted bread and a little alcohol. The flavor is similar to the aroma with piney and citrusy hop notes initially, along with some caramel, rye bread, brown sugar, and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is smooth and velvety, and drinkability is pretty good.

It's just that if this beer would just be marketed as an IPA or a regular Pale Ale- I would give this beer a bit of a higher score. It is only because it is called a Rye beer and I'm just not getting any rye is due to a lower score. Like I said, this is a great beer, but doesn't give me what it tells me it should...","TheGordianKnot","Jun 03, 2010"
3.92,-6.2,4,4.5,4,4,3,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into an English pint glass at slightly warmer than fridge temperature. The beer pours a nice, white head that falls fairly soon to a thin film. Slight lacing. The beer itself is dark amber, showing fine suspended particles and moderate to heavy carbonation. The nose is pungent hops, spice and perhaps apple skin. The flavor is very hops forward, with sour fruit and a tartness that can only come from rye. There's a definite astringency to the finish, and a dryness on the back of the tongue. It presents as a full-bodied beer. Drinking several in a row might be a bit of a challenge, in large part due to the astringency of the finish. Overall, though, a very good beer and different from the norm.","MCDuhamel","Jun 02, 2010"

4.38,4.8,5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"A ruby amber color, brilliant hue, catches the light and uses it to illuminate itself from within. Moves like a light syrup, licking the sides of the glass, decent head. Sweet malty scents with hops coming over the top, more subtle on top of the sweet. Smell of freshly mowed lawn, zest of pine, leaves, maple syrup. An almost toasty flavor on the first sip, malt and rye, beautiful together. The rye is crisp and refreshing, lingers on the tongue. The bitter and the sweet rejoice in this beer.

The body is medium and the palate is immediately hit by a wallop of bittering hops that cleanses and lingers very nicely. Thick, distinct lace forms. Nice malt notes, however, the rye is evident and produces a very clean, delicious spiciness. The carbonation is delicate. Should try this ale with my next Reuben or Pastrami on rye.

Ah, that's what it is, the rye is evident at first sip. Taste starts out creamy with a good malt profile. Finish is dry and bitter. Rye makes it's presence known throughout. Very tasty! Feel is creamy, with appropriate carbonation. Very drinkable IPA. Another solid offering from Founders! I enjoyed this beer and would have it again!","Sideswipe","Feb 27, 2010"
4.2,0.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours dark red with small off-white head. Dusty sediment visible. Not getting much rye in the smell, getting mostly caramel, sweetness and hops. Hmm, interesting taste. I am definitely getting a subtle rye taste which I like alot. A lot less hops than I expected, maybe I have an old bottle? Tastes of pine and wood work great here as well. Still getting a bit of caramel sweetness too which balances out the more dense previously mentioned tastes. No alcohol taste present here and the tastes aren't overpowering, I would not session it though mostly because of it's slight heaviness. Another excellent and complex offering from Founders.","Chico1985","Feb 27, 2010"

It also makes a fantastic six pack to bring home and unwind with.","StoneTSR","Feb 27, 2010"
4.52,8.1,4,4.5,5,4,4,"Pours a rich reddish mahogany brown with subdued carbonation, a smallish parchment head and moderate lacing. Aroma is quite nice with plenty of grapefruit, some caramel sweetness and a rye seed twinge in the background. Flavor is quite nice. Extremely well balanced, complex yet nuanced. Plenty of grapefruit from the hops, solid caramel and bready malt backbone and a rye toast presence that compliments, rather than dominates as in some other rye beers. This beer has a firm bitterness that once again, seems to meld with the other flavor aspects. Very tasty. Medium bodied with a wonderful surprisingly smooth mouthfeel and great semi-dry finish. Oh, and this finish is miles long. I take a break to type and the rye lingers on my tounge. I am not the world's biggest rye fanboy, but this one is well executed and extremely drinkable. Strongly recommended by a friend from Founder's home of Grand Rapids, back in my native mitten. I have to agree that this is a top notch offering from one of the Midwest's premier brewers.","zoso1967","Feb 25, 2010"

Although they're sometimes excellent, many other well known American brews that use rye are essentially American IPA's with rye thrown in to up the complexity. While not quite as hop forward as something like Hop Rod Rye, the way the rye is so skillfully showcased really makes this a special beverage. This would definitely be a regular in the fridge if I could find it locally.","berkey","Feb 24, 2010"

4.25,1.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Overall, this is a very nice beer and my favorite rye beer to date, although it's very hard to pick out a whole lot of the rye because of the dominating hops. I look forward to getting my hands on a fresher bottle because this is a very tasty and very drinkable beer that would be great for lounging around in the late summer or fall.

4.5,7.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A stunning beer. Beautiful pour, rich red-amber color. Smell of honey/vanilla/pine. The flavor is exceptionally good: rich, rewarding, balanced - a real knockout. The peppery punch of the rye is offset wonderfully by the IPA hop kick. Flavors of honey and dry, clean hops are dominant, but not overbearing. This brew is your master, but it is kind and benevolent. Washes down like silk and the aftertaste really blooms the flavors nicely. Hops are very pronounced, but not straight pine or citrus, something else that is much better. Founders wins again.","MNJR","Feb 19, 2010"

I Let the beer sit while I ironed a shirt, when I came back to it, there was still some head left with a good amount of thick lacing. The smell is strong of rye but at the same time crisp and almost citrusy. The taste is exactly what I expected. It's an IPA with a good malt backbone, but with a powerful rye taste to it. Didn't know if these two flavors would blend well, but the taste is exceptional. I get a bit of caramel in the taste too, a lot of complexity. The mouthfeel it thick with a bit of sediment that you can sense. Substantial but smooth. I could only see me drinking a couple of these because they are thick and filling.","pdoran10","Feb 19, 2010"

4.55,8.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Pours out a very dark red, almost brown with a two finger head that is very foamy/creamy with amazing retention. The head doesn't wanna go away and leaves off-white, thick lacing behind. The lacing itself comes off the glass about a millimeter or two! By my standards this is pretty much as good as it gets for apperance. Smell is of great, fresh hops and some pale malts with a hint of caramel. The malts remind me of homebrewing. The hops come through with earthy, fruity and herbal notes. The strength of the nose is good and the hop aroma stays throughout the whole experience. The hop aroma of this bad boy could rival almost any IPA I have had. Taste is like the nose but does not fade. The hops are great in flavor and bitterness. Piney and earthy hops dominate and the fruity ones take a back seat. The malts are very pleasant and the rye likewise. Malts are have some caramel hints and balance the hops very nicely. The rye creates a flavor I am not used to but I enjoy, I am not very familiar with rye beer. Overall the flavor is great and well balanced. Mouthfeel is nice for this beer. The body is moderate. The carbonation is right where I want it and medium in strength. The only thing I would want is a bit more creaminess. There is a huge warmth which I did not expect but it adds to the experience since I cannot taste the alcohol creating this feeling. Drinkability... I have been searching for a sessionable Founders beer that is great. This is it. The price is on the higher end for a session beer but it is worth it. After a six pack of these I would be in a perfect place. This is now my go to beer due to the great hop aroma and balanced flavor. What a nice surprise.","cbutova","Feb 03, 2010"

Big bubbles, small bubbles.... bubbles o plenty. An off white head rests proudly atop a beautiful hazy red ale. The laser etched bottom sends lanes of carbonation racing to meet up with the rest of the trapped bubbles at the bottom of what seems to be a never dying pile of head. The lacing shows evidence of the beer levels before i took my last few quaffs. The sweet grain and rye spiciness combine with the citrus minty hops witch are coating my tongue as I type.

Lots of hops, again more floral than pine, and the citrus is just a hint. To me, this is definitely better than Hop Rod Rye. Then again, Hop Rod is considered an IPA and has less rye. This is superb, I could see this as a regular if it were more readily available. Oddly enough, I've rated a couple other offerings from Founders higher, but if I had to pick one of their beers to sit and drink all night this would be the one.","alkemy","Nov 27, 2009"

In the finish, the generous amount of malted rye used gives it a spicy crisp finish. This is better a little warmer, flavor bursts when around 46 deg. It's not a cloying rye, and the body is lighter than I though it would be...and not in a bad way. Drinkable, maybe not quite a session beer but I think I'll have another.","beergod1","Nov 22, 2009"

This one is easy to drink and I can see myself going after another sixer of this easily and in the near future. Body is medium-light helped by carbonation which gives it a lighter feel than what it actually has. Finishes clean and semi-dry. Bitterness lingers.

At first I thought of describing it as muted, but that isn't correct. It comes through clearly, but is heavy and "hangs low" if that makes any sense. Good balance. Nice malt presence and pleasantly hoppy. The hops must be chinook as its very similar to the "Rye PA" I had at Great Waters in Saint Paul and the chinook hops was the "unique" quality I am almost certain of it. The mouthfeel is a little thicker than many ales. The sweet presence of the chinook (if I am indeed correct) works well to enhance the malt flavor.

A lightly caramel a dn grainy backbone barely making its presence known. Tastewise, wow this is good. Huge hops right off the bat like the nose. Lots of citrus and some pine. A little spicy as the caramel starts to show. A mouth-watering finish that turns floral as it slowly fades. It has a medium body, dry texture, moderate carbonation, and a light hoppy-spicy sting to it. This a very enjoyable beer. Big hops presence without being a big beer. Every sip leaves me wanting more.

The red rye color and finish are really noteworthy, as the creamy head lasted until I finished the beer and washed away the graininess in the finish. The hop structure was clean and the carbonation soft (not too dry). Likely used a very acidic, soft water to break down the rye as well as they did.","TLove","Sep 21, 2009"
4,-4.3,4,4,4,4,4,"The punchy bitterness is a surprise at first, but it melds nicely with the spicy rye, light caramel sweetness and herbal hop flavor. This has the bitterness of an IPA, but the flavor comes more from the earthy, spicy, slightly sour rye malt than it does from the hops. I get a bit of tropical fruit mid-palate, mango and pineapple. The finish is dry, bitter and lingering, almost excessively so, but it's not an astringent bitterness. Enjoyable stuff.","largadeer","Sep 21, 2009"
4.58,9.6,4.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a beautiful deep amber with red highlights capped by a couple of fingers of cream colored head. Tiny bubbles of carbonation dance up to the surface. The aroma is a blend of citrus, grains, and caramel. In the flavor is where these are presented more interestingly, with hops and malts striking a fine balance, featuring said citrus and caramel. The rye is allowed to shine here with nutty, spicy, and earthy twang. Some hints of honey, especially in the coating mouthfeel.

The rye aroma was very inviting, and even more intriguing coming from this red brew. The floral and citrus hops gave the nose a distinctive IPA bouquet. The taste was an incredible combination of base and adjunct malts up front with a robust hop finish. The malts approach with a rich sweetness and the distinct taste of rye. As the malt mellows the hops take over with floral notes on the tongue and a touch of spiciness toward the back of the throat. The aftertaste is hoppy but nice. This beer finishes clean and does not leave the mouth sticky making it very drinkable, but beware of the 6.6% ABV. This drinkable beer can add up fast! Red's Rye PA is a fantastic new take on the classic IPA; rye beers are so few as it is, so coupling the unique taste of rye with the punch of an IPA makes for a unique, enjoyable, beer experience.

I love this beer. First time in a bottle. I have enjoyed pitchers of this sweet nectar at Chumley's in Broad Ripple with Royce Peacock, but never in a bottle. It's good, and damn good.","JohnWaynes44","Jul 17, 2009"

The hop bitterness helps to create a clean finish, and then lingers quite nicely. "Red's Rye" has a very nice mouthfeel that is at the same time smooth and a bit prickly from the carbonation.

Overall this was surprisingly a hop bomb without as much rye as expected. Nice flavor, albeit very bitter and not as unique as I hoped.

I also appreciate roasted characteristics, and my old friend Mr. Grapefruit, who becomes more talkative as he warms up to you (do you see what I did there?) The citrus hops and the spicy rye make a great combination. The mouthfeel is medium thick with moderate amounts of carbonation.

Overall, this is a pretty darn good rye beer and definitely worth a try.","Tone","Mar 23, 2009"

4.68,12,5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"A great looking poor. Dark golden red with a head that leaves lacing all the way down the glass. The smell is hoppy and you think you are getting another hop bomb of an IPA (not that this would be a horrible event by any means) but then you taste it and the rye comes out and mingles with the hops and it is fantastic. As it warms the rye starts to dominate and the beer changes a bit, but in a interesting way. Good at the beginning, good at the end, it is a tremendous brew. I'm getting a little tired of Founders just showing up with beer after beer and kicking butt and taking names. Seriously Founders, let some other breweries get a shot at the top of my ratings, it is embarassing. I feel like such a fan boy.","SwiftyMcBeer","Mar 21, 2009"

Founders is beginning to seem like one of my most wished for breweries to expand their distribution to California. I realize that craft beer is still a relatively small market, and, perhaps, any one are can only sustain a certain number of breweries, but, damn it, it's still frustrating. I need a job that let's me travel into other distribution areas. Ok, that's enough digression. This beer is a red amber liquid with a nice head. It's relatively clear and glows when backlit. Good looking beer, but this beer does a lot of things right. The smell is a lot hoppier than I was expecting. There are some big pine and citrus hop aromas on this one with an underlying spiciness. The flavor is not the overwhelming rye-ness that I was expecting. The slightly sour rye notes are there, but they don't dominate. There's wonderful sweet malt and bitter hops. Everything works in balance and in a complementary fashion. The feel is refreshing yet full, but the rye just pushes the whole package over the edge from great to exceptional. Red's Rye is a very, very well-crafted beer.","popery","Mar 11, 2009"

Smell is pretty mild but a balance of citrus hop smell and biscuitlike smell, I can't tell which is more dominant. Taste is instant rye/wheat flavor immediatly followed by smooth Amarillo hops and malt. Taste is strong but not overpowering. Medium bodied mouthfeel that coats the tongue with rye flavored goodness. Very drinkable, I session this beer at my favorite beer bar often. This has been my go-to beer lately on draft but have had this bottle in my fridge to review and they taste very similar. This is my second favorite beer to eat spicy foods with(second only to alpha king) and truly a treat when you want a flavorful beer that doesn't destroy your pallate.

Sort of a malty sour smell, but not in a bad way. Taste was quite good. Dull piney/floral hops. Good malt profile. A little on the bready, dry side, but it didn't run the drinkability or the overall mouthfeel. Overall, not that complex of a brew. Simple but well done. Had I not known any better, I would've classified it as an amber, just on color and malt tastes. Give this a try if you see it, and I get the feeling this is one of those beers that is much, much better on tap.

Palate is a toasted rye malt complimented by the persistent hops. Slightly medicinal and herbal. Light, smooth and oily with an astringent finish. A really very nice brew. My only critique is that the hops could be a touch more balanced between the aroma and the taste. The hop blast up front is not matched in the palate. But this is a really really good beer, a nice uniqueness to it with the rye spice, and well rounded in every respect.","TheDoorman","Feb 27, 2009"

Dark burnt orange-red in color, slight haziness deepens the hue further, retains depth along the rims. Nose smells as caramelized as burnt, develops scents of brown sugar, white grapefruit pith, pine oil, apricot pit, flower water, on the whole never gets in your face, that grapefruit the most obvious element, more about keeping it all on the same page. In the mouth it's medium to full-bodied with a steady stream of carbonated pop and sizzle, very active presence. Spicy with a crisp graininess, the citrus a blend of white grapefruit, pink grapefruit and mandarin orange. The malt dimension leaner here, some brown sugar to toffee, appears to act more as a salve for the palate than source of flavor. Nicely floral with a credible level of apricot, peach fruit. Manages to create a unified, consistent presence without ever appearing to attract attention to itself. The finish is long, yet tactful. Never bitter but comes close in the name of refreshment.

The aroma is definitly more like a DIPA then anything. There is a good bit of grassy hops mixed with just an inkling of rye spiciness. The flavor is a spectacular example of what rye can do for a the flavor profile of a beer. The rye adds a glorious spiciness to what I would consider a good DIPA. With the rye, this mutates into a spectacular tasting beer. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a light carbonation.

4.23,1.2,5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"I was at Arcadia just a few hours before strolling into the back country forest preserve party that is the Founders Brewing Company brewpub. And Arcadia's rye might have just been the perfect primer for the Founders Rye, a beer I've had a few firkins of by the bottle and tap, but never one so close to the source. What amazes me still about the Founders Red's Rye is its insistence on freshness. Though a beer absolutely consumed by peppery, anisette hops, it verges on being a drinkable barleywine because the rye is so intense. This beer would only taste better with a corned beef shooter. Which is to say, you never see this much balance in what really amounts to a double IPA. But the graininess here provides great liquid-Jell-O-like texture and body, not to mention flavor, that makes the hops all the more interesting. It's as bitter as all get out, but maybe closer to Rogue's Old Crustacean than to something like 3F's Dreadnaught. I love that. I love that a beer can be this hoppy and still let the malt shine. Not more than five brewers in the world can balance the extremes this well, and none do it better than Founders.","ngandhi","Dec 30, 2008"

The nose smells very hoppy and sweet,with big grapefruit and pine sap notes. Some banana and malty bread crust on the tail. This is hoppy but not as hoppy on the pallet as the nose leads on,don't get me wrong there are plenty of hops. The rye adds just a touch of sourness and helps strengthen the malty bread crust undercurrent. A spiciness presents itself subtly and in the form of RYE which is awesome and lingering.

Taste is relatively straight forward, its pretty much just rye and bitterness with some thrown in for good measure in the finish. Mouthfeel is ok, medium body and moderate carbonation.

However, Nitro-tap makes it much smoother and creamier than I've had it before and definitely let the flavors blend more. As I said above, this was not a smack you in the face with hops beer, followed by a rye aftertaste. Instead they blended and grew as I enjoyed it.

This beer has a nice hoppy finish that doesn't overpower the grains, but definitely balances out the semisweet malts. I first had this at Bukowski's in Boston and then got some to review.

The taste is magnificently balanced and proof that non-extreme beers can be astoundingly good. Very nice blend of rounded malt, slightly spicy rye, citrusy/piney hops, and some fruity/bubblegum like esters. No one flavor components dominate, they just form a harmonious quartet.

A citrusy hoppy frgrance, with touches of malty sweetness, followed by a hint of spiciness from the rye. The taste blends well starting the sweet malt, then the rye takes over, then it layers to grapefruit and grassy flavors. The rye and the hops linger on the palate for sometime. A even balanced medium bodied feel, it glides across the palate leaving a slight arid feeling. This is a very good beer and is quickly becoming a favorite.

The flavor was very robust with a good amount of malt showing up right away, then finishing with a lasting piney bitterness.

A very dark resin slips out of the bottle if held long enough. One of the best looking brews I have had, honestly. Smell is of strong hops with a very sweet citrus twang. Very tempting. This is an excellent, full bodied, complex brew. Rye malt is powerful, so are the hopps. There is citrus here and something else that I can't pinpoint within the hopps that make this hop heavy beer extremely well balanced, smooth and enjoyable. The ABV of 6.8% is easily disguised by the complex flavors. This is a home run by Founders. A must try for all that appreciate great a great brew.","gotweid","Aug 05, 2007"

It is indeed a red ale, with a wonderful candied orange hop nose (at least at first) mixed a touch of pine. Later on, this beer starts smelling like a bit like a wood shop (think: sawdust). It is very mellow at first, before the caramel malt flavors get coated with spicy hops and a touch of roastiness. The bitterness is very assertive and almost overcomes the palate, crowding out the other flavors. I would call this a Rye IPA for sure and one that is all about the hops. I couldn't detect the flavor of rye at first (too much hop flavor got in the way), but as this ale warmed up I was able to pick up a definite rye spiciness. The mouthfeel is smooth, but the body is a bit thin. (This actually makes the beer dangerously quaffable.)

The taste was hoppy which was odd since not much hop aroma. Didn't really like it after the 1st couple drinks but then it hit its stride and grew on me. Need to try again when I know it's fresh but I could see drinking this one every once in a while (if avail here which it's not).

I am guessing that it was dry-hopped as it has that nice floral piney hop aroma that I crave. Taste is well balanced with a good malt backbone to follow up the hoppiness.

A very nice citrus/grapefruit hop blast as well. Mild coffee malt seems to balance this one out quite well. Taste was quite a surprise. So much smoother than I had anticipated. The powerful hop odor doesn't dominate the taste at all, and I love it, but the citrus is still there. Definite malt towards the end, so balanced.

As the hops or pushed aside (very difficult), I'm able to smell some tropical fruits like mango, kiwi with a little bit of faint baking spice coming through, perhaps a sign of the rye. The hops are a lot more subdued in the taste, with a creamy smooth mouthfull of malt with a very dry finish. I'm not too familiar with rye beers, but I'm curious is the very dry finish is characteristic as its a detraction for me; I'm looking for a little sweetness to balance.

Toward the swallow a little bit of sweetness emerges and the finish is then dominated by a lingering hop flavor and bitterness. The finish is crisp, but I cant really pick out the rye between the immense hop presence and seemingly fair amount of crystal malt. Overall this is a tasty brew, I would put it into the IPA realm, similar in some ways to SN Celebration Ale. The aroma and hop flavor are my favorite very fresh and inviting.

Bitterness felt throughout entire mouth, possibly one of the most bitter hoppy beers I've ever had. Medium bodied with prickly carbonation felt on tongue.

This is a medium bodied beer with a moderate amount of carbonation. The taste is strongly hoppish with a sweet grain. You can taste the oils and embers of the hops and it is very pleasant. The only downside is that the after taste is a bit too strong, too much of a bite, and the middle and end aren't that distinguishable.

It is very good and very drinkable but certianly balanced toward the bitter quite well. I was hoping for the belgian crystal malt to shine thorugh a bit more as the malt character is rather muted. Aside from that, it has the ability to encourage the next quaff. The rye does lend a spicy character that blends well with the hop bitterness.

4.65,11.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"This is yet another beer that just gets better and better with each sitdown with it. The first few bottles poured with a really huge head to the point where I had to wai ten minutes before I could drink the red liquid at the bottom. After I switched glasses, it poured much more smoothly, with less head, and a pleasing clear red. Lots of sediment lingered toward the bottom of the glass, which might turn off some people, but didn't seem to play a huge part in the overall experience. The first whiffs were of overwhelming cocoa and caramel, which was completely the opposite of what I was expecting. With some warming and spinning, I noticed a much more bitter smell, almost as if the initial sweetness was never really there. Taste was divine, with some crisp green apple tastes at the beginning, and some strong hops and rye towards the end, leaving a bitter taste on the palate. The hop/rye marriage gave it a really nice spicyness as well. Body was medium, and gained complexity as it swishes around in the mouth. As with nearly all Founders beers, theres a near perfect balance that has to be experienced to truly understand. Drinkability...I am pouring another one right now in the middle of this....it is very easy to drink. In a previous review of the Black Rye, I asked myself which one I liked better. Now I have to say that this one gets my vote as the better of the two (though the Black Rye is matvelous as well). This is another example of why IMO Founders is one of the best breweries in the United States. Now if only I could get my hands on some Breakfast Stout during it's always brief stint on liquor store shelves in this state. Cheers","jamie2dope","Dec 13, 2006"

Pleasant, moderate aromas of pine needles, caramel , lemon rind, spices and rye toast meld together nicely. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a spritzy carbonation. Initial flavor seems dominated by the malts revealing a subdued caramel, toffee sweetness. This quickly transcends into a hefty hop and rye flavor profile showing off assertive notes of grapefruit, pine, rye seeds and spicy black pepper. Finish is a mouth-puckering combination of a chalky-like mineral dryness and hoppy bitterness which hangs on nicely. In the end a great balance of the malts, hops and rye to create a pleasurable, unique style.","macster","Sep 15, 2006"

Malty sweetness, hoppy bitterness and a peppery bite, all on the palate. The finish had that characteristic bite of rye, making it the lingering, prevalent taste.

The flavor is somewhat like a smooth barleywine...very dry with dark fruity base and nicely hopped. There is however a definite rye flavor in the back of this one that gives it a character all it's own. A distinct flavor....like I have had it before....but I have not had "it" before.

Served in a tankard, just because this is what I always drink Red's with, I like the open top to smell all of the gopodness. Appearence is amazing. mix crimson with burnt umber and you have this beers color. Not a cloudy beer. Head is a light latte color. Aroma is citusy-hoppy. Most likely due to centennial hops, which I believe is used in a lot of Founder's brews. Taste is to die for. Citrusy-hoppy just as the aroma forshadowed. very slight tinge of drynedd that you can only notice if you really look for it. Taste is dominated by hops, but the flavors of rye and toasted malt (?) are present too. Thick and chewy mouthfeel which is very enjoyable. Drinkability is through the roof. I've purchased countless six packs of this beer, and will probably keep buying it untill I die, or untill Founder's goes under, whichever comes first (hopefully me dieing is first because it would be a sad life in MI without Founder's) I suggest going out and getting this beer as soon as possible, not just as single, I'm talking like a kegs worth.","Avagadro","Jun 16, 2006"

The smell was of balanced floral, pine bitterness with solid underlying fruits (apricot, peach, grapefruit). There was some sort of different malt smell too which i guess i can attribute to the rye. The taste was great. It was came as a nice hop explosion up front then simmered into its separate fruit flavors, a slight kick of spice, and then ended with a lingering, semisour hop presence. I can only describe the mouthfeel as very coating. This beer doesn't let you miss much. After a short time this beer was gone and if i had more than one i would have had another. A great beer by founders. I can see why people like them so much","mattpetti","May 07, 2006"

Don't get me wrong, this is a real good beer. Almost like a hopped up, double American red, is how it tasted to me. Nice rye, grainy taste, I did enjoy that and some sweet malty caramel and juicy, juicy fruits, were a joy. Just a little unbalanced for a Founder's.","bigdeuce","May 06, 2006"

Lace just clump on the side of my glass as I drink. The hops are mainly the focus in the body. Citrus and spicy. Not sure if the spicy part is the hops or the rye but the mouth feel is medium.

The taste is hoppy as all get out in typical founders style, I do find them a bit one dimensional in their hop profiles just like FFF, but with beers this good...who cares! The rye is their too and it swirls together with a nice light caramel-like malt flavor. This one is pretty resiny as well providing the end user with nice hop burps.

This is definitely hop dominated, but there is a malt character here, which, through its caramel notes, helps to accentuate the fruity citrus character of the hops. As the beer warms up it begins to pick up some minty menthol like notes in the finish. I can't say that the rye is really noticeable here; perhaps it adds a bit to the body of the beer and it seems to make it have a head with more staying power. As with many of the so called "rye" beers this is a hop bomb; don't get me wrong, I definitely am enjoying this beer, but I am curious as to what the rye is really adding.","Gueuzedude","Nov 30, 2005"

Bready flavor with citric sizzle and solid bitterness that ends with that "twang" of rye. Cocoa too. Medium body is nice and soft on the tongue. Dry finish makes for easy drinking, easier than I usually find this combo of flavors to be. This is a nice beer, but this damn combo of fruity hops and toasted malt just does not work! Two great flavors that just don't belong together. Good beer, but not all that special. The rye doesn't make as much difference as all us beer geeks would like to believe.","waughbrew","Nov 02, 2005"

Initially a citrusy orange and lemon feel, moving into a less gentle grapefruity finish. The hopping is quite bold, especially for a red ale. Malt flavor is somewhat blurred and lost beneath the hop attack, but maintains a mild caramelized sweetness. A bit of yeasty doughiness. Some flowery bitters, especially in the aftertaste. Fairly full bodied, with a modest carbonation level. Goes down damn smooth. The alcohol is a bit higher than I'd like for a "drinkin' beer", but it's a good brew for a short, hoppy session.

Cracker like biscuit flavors add to the dry mouthfeel, and herbal seedy rye bread is detectable as well. One of the few rye beers I've had that balances the rye malt and hops so nicely.

I like it. Spicy hops, spicy rye smell. Taste is just perfect with the rye. Like a nice well balanced, though hoppy red ale, but with the added complexity of rye. I can't get enough of that rye taste in beers, and I really think every brewery should release a beer in this classic style. There really aren't that many that I can think of. It really adds a lot, though it's so simple, to what would otherwise be your average ale.

There is also some malty sweetness with a crisp alcohol finish. Moderate carbonation and full body. This is a very drinkable beer. I should have bought the lot.

4.13,-1.2,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This beer poured a somewhat murky reddish-copper color, with a light head. Not totally opaque, and the carbonation to glass bottom is easily observed. It has a deep malty aroma, with heavy hints of citrus--almost like grapefruit. Also present is a tinge of caramel or chocolate. Tastewise, it has a malty, full-bodied flavor with a bit of a rye kick for a pleasant aftertaste. There are definite citrus flavors as well. Red's Rye is full, but smooth, and surprisingly easy to swallow, despite its being so sharp going down. Overall, I would say that this is a beer that is eminently enjoyable, but only when sipped slowly in order to understand its true complexity. Definitely worth drinking again and again....","macpapi","Jul 12, 2005"

Malty sweet smell with some caramel overtones followed by a citrus-like hops aroma. This medium bodied ale's flavor profile is dominated by a citrus hops flavor and bitterness, but with enough of a caramel-like malt sweetness to back up all that hops. Also some spicy notes probably from the use of rye as well as from the hops. Not typical of a lot of rye beers, but quite refreshing and enjoyable.","blackthistle","Jul 10, 2005"

Quit a hoppy nose with citric and some floral hops jumping out with a nice crisp rye undertone. Light sweet caramel maltiness is there as well. Hops and rye are quite an appetizing combination. Flavor is similar with a nice hop bite to start is off. Plenty of rye and malt to balance out the bitterness. Light caramel, grapefruit and a bit of pine hops all blend together nicely over the rye. Bitter hoppy rye finish. Damn this is some tasty and smooth stuff. Really creamy medium body. Goes down oh so smooth with a light prickliness from the hops.

There was definate citrusy notes in the nose. The taste was supremely balanced with a bitter beginning and a dryness in the finish. The rye seemed to have add it's two cents in the finish with the grainy dryness. The bitterness was exceptionally present, but was not as heavy as a IIPA.

A straight line of caramel, rye spiciness, then hop balance. Has the pepper but not quite the oiliness and calvados-like notes that rye can impart. The brick of caramel also tames the rye as well as the purported 60 IBU's.

The bitterness is sharp, yet clean. And there's a dulled spiciness present that is a contribution from the rye rather than alcohol I believe. Another solid offering from Founder's.

I'm getting alarmed about the three bottles of Devil Dancer I bought the same day as this rye ale. This one pours a cloudy, copper body with a small beige head that quickly falls into ring and film. Nice spiderweb lacing is left on the glass. Aroma has a ton of hops, a strong note of spicy rye, and a hint of caramel malt. Hops are pine, grapefruit, and hemp. Mouthfeel has a medium body, moderate carbonation and a coating of pine resin hops. Taste is lots of hops and a hint of rye. Caramel malt is difficult to appreciate underneath the massive hopping. This one goes down really easy, and the aftertaste is not as biting as I feared. I am very fond of rye malt in beers, and this one is no exception. The hops are allowed to romp around all over the malts here, but I just happen to be in a hoppy mood as I finish this one off. Not quite ready for their Devil Dancer, though.
