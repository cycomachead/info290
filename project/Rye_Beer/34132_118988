Smells strong of bitter hops, pine, resin and earth tones.  Taste is quite flavorful of pine, earth, hops, and rye.  Pretty smooth and medium bodied with a pleasant mouthfeel and not too bitter of an aftertaste.  Overall, a very fantastic rye ale that I will seek out again.","dpgoblejr","Mar 16, 2015"

I'd like to give them another try.","MLaVioletteJr","Feb 15, 2015"

4.05,-3.1,3.75,4.25,4,4,4,"This is an interesting take on a rye ale, and I like it. Rye can be quite a big flavor, and some rye beers attempt to combat this with bigger malt profiles. Here, the rye is very subtle and the malt profile is actually pretty average, balanced with some nice hoppiness. Stoneface apparently really knows what they are doing.","angrybabboon","Jan 26, 2015"
