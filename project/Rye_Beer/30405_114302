3.85,1.3,4,4,3.75,4,3.75,"Poured a copper body with solid head and lace ring down glass.  Aroma is citric, floral hops and a hearty malt base, some of it being the rye (I think).  This is a really smooth IPA with the rye helping smooth things out and having a noticeable presence.  Beer is balanced as it has citric hop dryness and a little bit of malty sweetness.  Not the most flavorful rye beer but the sour and dry, grainy aspects are minimal and that's how I prefer a rye beer. I had this in draft, not can , so apparently I missed out.","clayrock81","Mar 09, 2015"

Aroma is dank, hoppy, piney with some grapefruit and assorted citrus. Taste is very hoppy, with plenty of piney hops and grapefruit. Carbonation is a touch lighter than I would have wanted, but overall, this beer feels good and the 7% ABV is hidden very well !!!","hophugger","Beers"

I went with a heavy-handed pour, instead, and still got two-plus fingers of tawny head with moderate retention. The head fell as I was typing and cuing up some accompanying music, but loads of lacing remained in its wake. Color was Amber to Deep Amber/Light Copper (SRM = > 9, ","woodychandler","Dec 20, 2014"
