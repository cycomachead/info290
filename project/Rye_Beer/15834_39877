4.08,3.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"D: This was my favorite beer of the night it was so balanced and fresh tasting that my tastebuds were pleased with each sip. One of the best beers I have had from Dock Street. Get it when in Philly!","scottbrew4u","Nov 28, 2010"
4.09,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Found at the Jet Bar on Terminal D at Philadelphia Airport this shows a yellow brown color, a cloudy iced tea appearance with a whispy off-white head and decent lacing. The nose detects crisp citrus hops, lemon-orange and bready caramel sweetness in the background. Quite tempting. The flavor comes on with a sturdy woodsy grain mixed well with the citrus bite. Carbonation is modest but arguably adequate with a supple, near chewy feel in a solidly mid-body brew. This is not highly rye flavored by my definition of rye (as in bread) but it is a bready/grainy IPA and is very agreeable and equally drinkable. This has some flavor balls, with plenty of bitterness but an unusually strong grain character. Is it rye? A bit. I'd like more of a rye definition in this but no real complaints here. It's a fairly unique, quality IPA with a rye idea. Good job Dock Street.","Durge","Nov 22, 2010"

4.12,4.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Had this on tap at the brewery. Dark brownish amber, clear with frothy cream colored head. Good retention and great lacing. Smell of bready malts, clean/earthy hops and lots of rye. Taste chewy malts up front then the rye hits hard. Almost overpowering rye, not as balanced as Hop Rod Rye or Red's Rye, but still quite good. Definitely worth a try.","stingrayvr6","Oct 03, 2010"
4.42,11.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability: I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Sipping led to more sipping and I was ready to order another when it was finished. I will revisit this one again next time I have the chance. It would be easy to drink a few of these.","drtth","Aug 26, 2010"
4.33,9.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Rye IPA is by far my favorite beer from Dock Street. The hops in this IPA really sings, piney, citrusy and hearty. The rye adds an acuity and acidity that perfectly accentuates the grapefruit and resinous hops, the mouthfeel is chewy and carbonation is very pleasant","Soonami","Jul 29, 2010"
4.08,3.3,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Huge hoppy bitter spicy mouthfeel with great drinkability.","RustyDiamond","Beers"
4,1.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a hazed dark copper with small cap of frothy white head, diminishing quickly but decent lacing. Scent is of bright tropical and citrus fruits with a touch of floral hops as well, a nice backbone of sweet and only mildy spice. Taste brings the tropical and floral hops with touches of citrus and pine, bitter at first but cut by a grahm crackery sweet background. The rye doesnt contribute much spice but instead gives some body and grainyness to the medium bodied brew. A decent IPA, malt forward.","rfgetz","0"

4.08,3.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"A nice amber-chestnut color with a frothy white one finger head. Aroma of pine, rye (of course!), and malt...a little sweet; slight flavor of honey, although not sticky. The malt adds a bit of chewiness to the beer. Not overpoweringly hoppy, fairly well balanced.","Atricapilla","Mar 30, 2010"

3.6,-8.9,4,4,3.5,4,3,"Not a bad IPA by any means, but the rye should have given it just a bit more bite. Overall, the general impression was a bit darker than ususal mid-range IPA. The level of hopping was nicely done and did not overwhelm the malt - but I was looking for just a bit more distinction. Enjoyable but not particulary memorable.","Brent","Sep 18, 2009"
4.41,11.6,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Slightly chewy medium body that is on the fuller end of the spectrum. Pretty hop forward with a decent amount of dry earthy piny hops, subtle citrus peel presence, sweet caramel malt and prominent rye flavor. This beer is excellently balanced and although the malt backbone and rye are prominent they don't overpower the hops, allowing the sweet citrus and dry pine notes to shine through. The sweetness from the caramel malt and rye actually enhance these flavors and the balance makes this beer very quaffable. was pleasantly surprised by this one. Highly recommended if fresh.","corby112","Jun 09, 2009"

4,1.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours hazy, opaque copper with sticky head. Aroma is fresh and hoppy, thick with simcoe hops. Flavor is carmelly and sweet, citrusy, heavy with what seem to be simcoe hops. Mouthfeel is viscous and clingy.","Seanibus","May 25, 2009"

3.98,0.8,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"first taste - WOW. you get a great taste of the rye, it sort of disappears quickly after it hits your mouth with a fresh train of hops coming right behind it. in the end it balances extremely well. it has a light to medium body. as you drink more it becomes a bit creamier. nice beer.","Hophead101","Jan 30, 2009"

3.8,-3.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Drinkability is not bad, but this is really more of just a plain rye beer then a rye IPA by my (albeit incredibly jaded) Portland standards. Still, a sturdy beer that goes down with ease, assume you like the spiciness of rye.","ccrida","Sep 25, 2008"
