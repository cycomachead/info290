To explain, the rye/grain is noticable up front, then it gives way to a citrusy hoppiness and finishes very sweet and smooth without much bitterness at all.  This may be one of the best rye IPAs I've had to date.  Excellent.","bubseymour","Mar 22, 2015"

Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, orange rind, apricot, floral, grass, rye, biscuit, light caramel, light pine, and floral/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with balanced hop and malt notes; with decent strength. Taste of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, apricot, orange rind, pine, floral, grass, biscuit, rye, light caramel, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of grassy/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, apricot, floral, grass, light pine, biscuit, rye, light caramel, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity of citrus hops and balanced malt flavors; with a crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and fairly sticky/crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice rye IPA. Good balance and complexity of citrus hop and rye/bready malt flavors; and smooth and crisp to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 05, 2014"

Nice aroma of citrus and floral hops, citrus and light stone fruit and caramel malt. Flavor follows aroma with a nice bready malt body, citrus hops with light herbal and piney elements, light sourness from the rye. Well balanced. Finishes with a grapefruit rind citrus hop finish and lingering hop bitterness. Great creamy body and the head is so thick and substancial it was was like whipped cream. A very nice rye IPA that leans more towards the citrus IPA end of the taste spectrum, with the rye adding nice spicy, tart notes. I liked this quite a bit and if Smuttynose was available here, I'd get this again in a heartbeat.

The liquid itself is a paler orange to yellow gold, has a sort of metallic sheen to it, fully transparent and shiny with extra tiny bubbles rising quickly within. The nose comes on first with tangy white grapefruit to mandarin orange notes, followed closely by dried grass and hay and then veers into cocoa powder and flowers, minimal breadiness but what’s there is country style, very light pineapple, peach to nectarine fruit scents. Medium-bodied, the carbonation seems creamier through the mouth entry but afterwards tends to prickle in support of the bitter herbaceousness and hoppiness. Peppery with some saltiness too, any pine or flowers come across as dried in nature. That said, there’s juice in the sour orange to lemon citrus. The rye clearer here and helps fill the blank spaces left by the spotty mixed white fruit component. Minor maltiness peeks out by the end, cocoa and caramel. No alcoholic heat but it is fairly intensely bitter which can create a similar impression. Just seems attenuated and lacking in volume and palate weight, especially at the end.","farrago","Nov 18, 2013"

Fresh citrus grapefruit and spicy rye aromas, fresh pine in the background and a pleasant sweet maltiness beneath. Medium bodied with aggressive, but soft carbonation, and a tangy feel from the middle to the end. Citrus hoppiness up front followed by spicy rye malt through the middle that transitions to light pine hop bitterness to the finish. Citrus hop flavors up front that are quickly subdues by spicy rye maltiness. Rye flavors are strong through the middle until light pine hop bitterness takes a bite at the finish.

Aroma is sweet, flowery, fruity and peppery. Lemon, tropical something, decaying pine needles, rye aromas and grains. Flavors match. Complimentary rye and hop bitterness that lingers. Pine resin crystals....and earthy too. Mouthfeel is pretty spectacularly tingly. Fluid and foamy. The bitterness continues to push on through. Perhaps a little tooo bitter but overall, yay Smuttynose!","tastybeer","Nov 09, 2013"
3.54,-9.7,4.25,3.25,3.5,4,3.5,"Solid golden orange with a bit of haze with a thick, lumpy white head that sticks to the glass. Fairly subtle floral, soapy, and oily citrus aromas. More spiciness as it warms up. Citrus pulp, some piney resin, yeast, and a pleasant addition of spicy grain in the finish. Medium-fullish body with a nice creaminess before a dry bitterness wraps it up. Some sweet toasted, almost biscuity notes, but the bitterness all but buries it. Pretty good, not sure how old the bottle is. Lots of bitter, spicy qualities, but I'd love a little more diversity in hop flavors and less plain old aggressiveness.","wedge","Nov 09, 2013"

I get some high alpha varietals, but I also get some more subtle English stuff, it really works. light and delicate for a rye beer, because of the grain. it drinks easy, and the higher alcohol is well disguised. nice in the early fall, smuttynose continues to impress me. rye beer is boom or bust most of the time, and this falls on the right side of that for sure.","StonedTrippin","Sep 21, 2013"

The rye is very prominent with a nice spicy, zesty flavor that nicely compliments the dry, earthy bitterness of the hops. Hop profile is a bit one dimensional but still has nice flavor. The malt backbone is huge, much stronger than I prefer. Lots of caramel, biscuit and toffee. Good for balance and blends well with the rye but it takes away from the hop flavor a bit too much for my preference. Still, this beer is very dry and bitter with spicy, grassy hops and dank pine needle character. Overall a decent tasting beer but I don't think I would seek it out again.","corby112","Sep 17, 2013"
