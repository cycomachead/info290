3.61,-5.7,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"16oz can, pours ruby/chestnut in color with a foamy tan head that holds great retention and leaves thick, chunky lacing on the glass - impressive. Aromas are malty caramel, peppery rye, citric hop. Tastes seem to be muddled, very earthy, rye, herbal, fresh dank hops, resinous citrus & evergreen. Full bodied, creamy and smooth, rather chewy, yet oily and resinous. Alcohol is very well concealed for 9%. Overall, like I said earlier: I want to like this more. I feel like the hops could be brighter and stand out more. It just seems to be too one note for me. It's not bad at all, but just seems to be missing something.","barnzy78","Jun 04, 2012"

3.78,-1.3,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Overall- This beer is different. The herbal quality and the sweetness do go hand in hand to make a unique palate of flavors. I feel this beer would be hit or miss with most people. If you want to try a hoppy pale, why not Hop A Potamus?","Pintofbrown","May 15, 2012"

3.69,-3.7,3,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Great river brewery hopapotamus - pours a very dark, clear, chestnut brown with red edges and a bubbly light brown head. The nose is interesting, it's a bit light but there is some notes of chocolate and roasted malts. There is a nice rye spice between the malt and hop transition as oily, resinous, citric hop. The taste has the pronounced rye with chocolate malts accompanying. Fairly roasted with a lighter hop presence than the nose. Basically just a light citrus and faint bitterness. A bit thick and syrupy with a lighter carb but soft feel. Pretty enjoyable balance here.","cpetrone84","May 01, 2012"

3.76,-1.8,4.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"O: Labeled correctly as a rye beer instead of an IPA/DIPA; the hops, though they mix well with the spicy malts, aren't really at the forefront on my palate. Nice beer anyways.","Scotchboy","Apr 26, 2012"

3.87,1,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a copper red with a healthy cap of tan head. Slow, steady beading and good lacing. The nose is earthy with layers of citrus, like fresh squeezed tangerine all smothered in caramel. There's quite a pine bite on the tongue that transitions through rye and toasted grains. Drawn out, bitter afterburn. Overall, this beer isn't perfect but it's complex enough to keep things exciting.","yamar68","Apr 18, 2012"

3.78,-1.3,4,3.5,4,3,4,"massive three finger tan head sits atop a reddish brown body. retention and lacing are slightly better than average. smell is mostly rye. hop flavors come out on the tongue. wanna say citrus and pine in there, but taste is dominated by spice from the rye. mouthfeel is kinda thin and almost watery, which is weird with the amount of carbonation in this can. a little oily and a dry spice finish. overall this is a decent rye beer that i will probably buy again.","match1112","Apr 16, 2012"
4.2,9.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall - I was impressed. Such a complex meld of flavors gave me a very pleasant experience! I will definitely be getting more if possible. If you love hops.. Try this! Something unique!","Tuey13","Beers"
3.15,-17.8,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Pours a clear brown with a foamy tan head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, rye, and spice notes. Taste is the same with some herbal and medicinal hop flavors. There is a medium amount of bitterness with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer with a very muddled and somewhat dirty taste.","UCLABrewN84","0"

Came out of the blue and I picked it up on a whim because the can looked cool and the unusual sticker over a plain can feel. Works very nicely and I hope to be able to find some more of this sometime.","jjanega08","Apr 14, 2012"
3.88,1.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"From the name I was expecting a pure hop monster, but instead this is a malt attack with a big hop balance. I like that it's hefty without being too sweet, although it still could be a bit more refined. Not sure the price on this thing since my buddy sent it to me, but I imagine it's a good bang for your buck. Actually, thinking about it more this beer reminds me alot of Arrogant Bastard. If you like that then you will probably like this.","bennetj17","Apr 13, 2012"
4.35,13.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is a very impressive beer. It fits nicely into the Rye IPA field (or in this case Rye IIPA) and it's drinkability is terrific. There is not possible way I would have guessed this was 9%. Drinks more like a 6-7% beer. Both of the beers I have had from this brewery have been outstanding. They are putting out some very impressive things and I look forward to trying more.","jera1350","Apr 13, 2012"
4.42,15.4,3.5,4,5,3.5,4.5,"Drinkability: The can says Hop•A•Potamus will charge if provoked. Frankly, I think that is more of a recommendation than a warning. This is definitely a beer you want to provoke.","TheQuietMan22","Apr 13, 2012"
