4.18,6.9,4,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"This beer poured a murky dark brown with a thin loose head of foam that fell before I even picked up the glass. Nose is lovely. Mellow and spicy rye. Deep but not too bold. A light airy wood and a modest sweet whiskey. Dry dark fruit like raisins, nuts and a touch of expansive malt sweetness like toffee and caramel. A fragrant bit of vanilla and I can't wait to taste this. Taste is lovely. Spicy rye that has become modest with a bit of age and from the oak barrel. Deep and tall rye flavor that is not unbounded like most rye ales but rather proper and containing all it's loveliness so that you can have it but so that it does not overrun the other flavors. A touch of smooth vanilla and airy wood. A surprise in some brilliant tart cherry. The cherry really enlivens the palate and lets you taste all the malt sweetness by contrast. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light with some tiny prickly bubbles in the finish. A small warming form the alcohol Smooth and very mellow. This one awesome beer.","utopiajane","Mar 25, 2014"

Warming brings out some touches of dark fig like fruit notes but nothing like that warm rye touch that really adds to it. As I take the first sip a really wave of caramel and light peppery rye hit the tongue. Light notes of chocolate that come over it wave after wave.

Slight oaky tannis comes through toward the end of the palate with a nice whiskey presence that isn't too overwhelming. It's a nice change of pace to drink a barrel aged beer that isn't dominated by hot booze. Subtlety can be a good thing sometimes. The finish is slightly dry with a bit of peppery zest.

It has been sitting for several minutes and there is barely any reduction in the head. Needless to say it is leaving crazy chunk lacing all over the glass. The aroma has a big oak sourness with hints of whiskey and vanilla. The taste is of oak and vanilla. The oaky sourness is not as big in the taste and the whiskey is noticable but not overpowering. There is also some red wine, caramel, chocolate and a lightly roasted malt flavors. The rye takes a distant backseat to the bolder oak and whiskey but does add a light spicy sour characteristic. Moderate body with fairly soft carbonation, the feel is a bit sticky and at times the abv can seem hot. The malt body does a good job supporting the strong flavors of this brew and helps keep everything in check. This is a very tastey barrel ages brew. The oak and whiskey do not blast you over your head but work very well with its supporting cast.","Gmann","Oct 05, 2009"

This is one of those "Whoa" brews for me, where the complexity, the drinkability, and the experience just click, left and right and up and down and everywhere. I haven't had an experience like this with a beer since Cuvee de Tomme, which makes me realize that Ithaca needs to 1) Keep doing what they're doing, 2) Get their beers to keep moving across the country, and 3) Keep making beers in this series. It's been about three hours now since I've been sipping on this, and I have a hard time believing that this isn't worth more than what I paid for it, which I believe was somewhere in the 11$-$13 range.

4.58,17.1,4.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Old Habit hits the palate running with a huge burst of oaken woodiness, followed immediately by notes of spicy rye and sugary, toffee malts. Prune and fig chime in from the yeastiness, making for a wholly delicious, complex rye beer--perhaps the best one I've ever had. Mouthfeel is smooth and juicy, with a nicely carbonated medium body that finishes with a kiss of rye and hops. Dee-lish. Incredible beer. [Insert additional generic rave]. Will definitely be seeking this one out again.","wagenvolks","Mar 22, 2009"

4.5,15.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This was released June 07 and is bottle #1905. Poured into sturdy chalice. Poured with minimal carbonation and no head or lacing. Poured a very deep, rich brown with a slight reddish tinge. A strong, deep, raisiny aroma with a slight spice note. A strong alcohol presence in the first sip that's not as noticeable on the following tastes. The earthy, fruitish taste followed the aroma closely. The sharp taste I usually find in rye beers is subdued, perhaps due to the age? Body is very full and pleasing, substantial without being overpowering. Very drinkable, but with 9% ABV you probably won't be drinking several in a row. I find myself wishing I had tried this fresher and saved a bottle for now, I think it would make for an interesting vertical tasting.","beertunes","Jan 11, 2009"

Smell of floral hops, cherries, vanilla, and maybe some rye, though I don't know if that's just because I know they used rye. In the taste I get cherries, caramel, floral hops, toffe, and oak. Body is somewhat light and has light carbonation. A decent beer. Thanks to iowaherkeye for sharing.","badbeer","Dec 20, 2008"

The whiskey on this one is pleasant, well-balanced, well-integrated, smooth and complex. Everything else - though definitely taking a backseat to the whiskey barrels - provides a solid foundation, as well. And though the abv% is up there - 9.0% is nothing to sneeze at - there's something about the taste of whiskey being accompanied by less than a burn that makes 9.0% taste like child's play.","CrellMoset","Dec 06, 2008"

4.35,11.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a very dark brown that when held to light shows a dark, but perfectly clear ruby. Nose is extremely clean. But not in a bland or boring kind of way. If this were a porter or a stout, I'd say this has a lot of malt qualities. Carries a pretty thick and robust character. Flavor is extremely hearty. Just a mass of robust qualities. It is hard to judge this one as I have not had any rye beers to this point, but it seems extremely well made. Feel has a great carbonation to it and a thick enough liquid feel. This one is extremely drinkable. Even though this is my first sample at this particular style, I feel as though I can firmly say that this is an excellent example of the style and overall a beautiful beer in general. If you see it....don't hesitate. If you did...you'd be robbing yourself of an experience. Beautiful. One of my most amazing experiences with beer in very recent memory.

4.32,10.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Much more robust and flavorful than imagined. The beer opens with a surprisingly dark brown color, yet quite clear. A demanding head retention holds firm throughout. Quite sturdy and characterful from the offset. Aromas of strong malts hinge on sweet / and nutty, earthy scents, followed by earthy / pungent hops. Quite Scottish Ale in nature, without so much of the campfire-smoke character. Flavors confirm the nose, with a hearty malt base that does not wholly depend on sweetness. Yes, it's toffee-like and richly malty, but has a strong backbone of nuts, dirtyness, earthyness, and a hit of musk that cannot be denied. Takes on pumpernickle bread flavors and spices at times. Remaining sharply bready well into the body, and never waivering. A lingering of toffee, roasted bread, and pungent hops ride well into the aftertaste. Very good beer, when a deviation from most Scottish Ales is in order. Thanks Nathan!","BEERchitect","Jul 14, 2007"

4.15,6.1,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a tremendous rye malt scent along with the "black cherry" aroma the bottle speaks of. The whiskey presence is there in the nose. The taste is good. It has a spicy rye flavor that goes down light and finishes warm and oakey with a nice whiskey-ish feel. It's a lot lighter than it looks. It's medium/full bodied with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. It's lighter than a barleywine, but packs as big a punch.","WesWes","Jun 06, 2007"

4.32,10.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This beauty pours a dark rich ruby with a very generous two finger khaki colored head that slowly dies down to a thin layer. Very sticky, all over the glass and won't let go. Very complex smell of wood, mild french vanilla, and crisp rye. Odor is very much like an American barleywine. Taste is complex as well. Starts off with a nice bite from the grassy rye, tingles the mouth. Then the vanilla flavors along with the whiskey smooths it out as it finishes. Aftertaste is a malty one, with toasted nuts and coffee like flavors blended with dark fruits such as cherries, dates, and raisins. Wow, alot of flavor in this one. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. Dinkability is pretty good, but the alcohol is somewhat present. Such a unique beer, highly recommend this to anyone who appreciates a quality brew.
