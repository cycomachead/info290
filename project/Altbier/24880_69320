2.9,-17.6,4,2.75,2.75,3,3,"Pour is a burgundy, oxblood color.  Aroma is a bit weak, malty and non descript.  Taste is pretty clean with notes of chocolate, slight toffee and roasted malt.  Mouthfeel is thin, but enjoyable for an easy drinking brown.  Overall, not the best brown I've had but easy drinking.","BrownAleBollocks","Nov 22, 2014"
