3.26,-7.4,4,3,3.5,3,3,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled 9/25/2012. Pours hazy reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, apple, bread, grass, light chocolate, light citrus, light nuttiness, and herbal hops. Decent aromas with good strength and decent balance; too fruity. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, bread, grass, light chocolate, roasted grain, light citrus, and herbal hops. Light herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, bread, grass, light chocolate, roasted grain, light citrus, and herbal hops on the finish for a short bit. Good flavor balance, but the flavor robustness is definitely lacking; zero cloying flavors are present on the finish, and quite dry on the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a slightly creamy, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is ok. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a decent brown ale. Very drinkable with solid flavor balance; but definitely could use more robustness of flavors, and a finish that is not as dry. A fairly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 05, 2013"
