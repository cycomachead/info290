Nice and bready with a mild, herbal hop flavor. Clean and lager-like. Too filtered and refined. Needs more edge.

So as my standard for Altbier it is a perfect blend of lagering and hops. It presents a pretty opaque color, for Deutschland, and has a nice but mild hop aftertaste.","BavariaYeti","Jun 24, 2011"

3.13,-17.8,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Not bad, nothing special either. Poured with a nice, foamy, frothy, light tan head that shortly fades to almost nothing and a tiny bit of lace. Color is a clear dark amber with light red highlights. Aroma is malt, roast, and a bit of metal. Flavor is quite mild - malt, roast, dark bread dough. Body is ok and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor and has about medium length. Very easy drinking and a session if you don't have much better and like a very mild dark beer.","drpimento","Sep 22, 2010"

3.1,-18.6,3,3,3,3,3.5,"0.5l bottle. Pours a completely clear brownish-amber color with a large frothy off-white head. Aroma is pale and caramel malts, bread, and grassy hops.

4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"M&D: in a sense this is a well-balanced Altbier that benefits from the hops and fruitiness as much as from the wood-ageing process. There's no WOW factor to the drink, but just like a good honest English Bitter I just can't resist another sip of it~~","wl0307","Oct 21, 2008"

3.43,-10,3.5,3,3.5,3,4,"Pours a clear deep copper hue under a one finger off-white head that fades quickly to film and collar, leaving only a couple of lace strings behind. The nose is mild, with just a hint of grain. The mouth is light and very prickly. The taste is mild at first, with just a bit of dark bread and no caramel. Then the hops kick in, crisp and spicey, leaving a nice dry bitterness in the mouth. Espresso notes linger well into the aftertaste, begging for another sip to relieve the parched palate. This is not a great or exciting beer, but it is contagious. Must have another...","Globetrotter","Feb 03, 2007"
3.41,-10.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Tall pale-cream colored head holds strong. After several minutes it left a few specs of lace as it morphed into a scattered film. Not much in the aroma, just some musty/grainy malt. Not much flavor, just a slight pale malt sweetness, nothing from the darker malts, and hardly any hops. It tastes more like a Pils. I really like Altbiers and I know there aren't a whole lot out there, but you can do better.","HappyHourHero","Jan 05, 2007"

3.53,-7.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured with good head, a nice colour - like a burnt amber, mahogony highlights. Awesome chalky, mineraly nose. Some amber/caramalyzed malt comes through first. Heavy in the mouth, but a somewhat dry finish leaves it more light-medium bodied. Fairly malty overall, but not over the top. More restrained than say a bock, but certainly a lovely, bold touch of malt. Falls apart a little too quickly than I'd like. Leaves an odd mineral feel in the mouthfeel (but void in the taste) Plenty more caramel as it warms. Some brown malt maybe? This was nice, but seemed to me it could be something more...","biegaman","Jun 28, 2006"
4.32,13.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Dark and misterious it pours out of the bottle to form a modest cappuccino crown over a dark-ruby liquid. Aroma is toffeish, with flowery-hoppy tones in the background. Carbonation is low. The taste is outstanding, reminiscent of English Ales with a perfect balance of nuts and malts vs. hops and fruit. Aftertaste is complex, bittersweet and crying for more. Great Germanic ale!","ernie","Jun 08, 2006"

3.8,-0.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Bottled: puts a copper-brown ale in your galss. 2 finger creamy cap with good retention and lacing. Mild aromas..woodsy, grassy, grainy. Mouthfeel is smooth and mellow good balance between toasty cerial malts and herbal-tobacco like hops dry clean finish. Overal impression is of a lilting dryness that travels just above an ample malt spine....a good alt for a large brewer.","pootz","Feb 07, 2006"
3.66,-3.9,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"330 ml bottle, bought in Germany. ABV is 4.9%. Beautiful reddish brown colour, large and lingering greyish light tan head. Moderate malty aroma with some caramel and spices, some flowery aromatic hops too. Flavour is moderately malty and herbal with moderate hops, a little burnt caramel too. Easy drinking, but not one of the Seven Wonders of the World.","Sigmund","Nov 10, 2005"
3.3,-13.4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Poured a rich amber-brown ale with a white head that started about an inch or so thick and subsided to a 1/4 inch and left a little lace. The aroma is of toasted malts with a touch of sweetness. The flavor is very dry and begins with a rush of carbonic bite and a dry toasted malt that reminds me of black tea. There is a bit of hops in the bitterness and it is sort of floral but it seems not present enough for me to be able to describe it well. The bitterness lingers into the finish and lends a further crispness to this ale. The mouthfeel is very dry and the carbonic bite is a bit out of balance and takes away from the maltiness. This is a great and flavorful session beer though my favorite in the style is still Zum Ueridge.","RenoZymurgist","Sep 08, 2005"
4.13,8.4,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Opinion: I really love Alt beers since I lived in Dusseldorf for a while, they taste like home. This one wasn't my favorite while I was over there, but since I haven't had it in quite some time, it tastes mighty good now. I know this is because I miss the flavor...and no other style is nearly this drinkable with this much flavor. If you have never tried an Altbier, definitely give this one a shot because it is an experience. If you are in Dusseldorf...stick to the Altstadt!","SkeeterHawk","Sep 02, 2005"
3.98,4.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Beautiful brown color with great clarity. Malts dominate and slight raisin and nut taste. In my 3 years in germany this was my old standby and got me through many cold nights. My British freinds liked it a lot. Since I lived in Rheiland Pfalz this was my stable when I ran out out biers from my filed trips up to dusseldorf or Bavaria. Drank hundreds & was always very consistent. Slightly better on draft....prost!","russpowell","Aug 12, 2005"

3.8,-0.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Taste is very strong maltaromatic and like smell tasting as greenmalt. Good and not overdone sweetness and a low dosed bitterness and phenolic. Mouthfeel is ok with good carbonation annd a nice a full beer without edges. Easy drinkable and IMO one of the better Altbeers though no competition to Uerige or Gleumes.","paterlodie","Jul 11, 2005"
3.23,-15.2,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"Overall Impression: My first Alt beer, so I really dont have much to compare it to. Its pretty good, rich taste, nice appearance, and a clean finish.

It's one of the better examples of the style, just be cautious of the bottles.","dpend","Nov 11, 2003"
3.09,-18.9,4,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Nice head forms upon pouring and takes quite awhile to subside. Aroma is a little stale and perhaps metallic. Flavor is slightly metallic with a nice malt and hop balance and a toasted finish that lasts and lasts. The malt and hop balance is really nice and impressive and the bitterness is well done. The drinkability is very good with the only real flaw being that metallic aroma and flavor at the beginning.","GCBrewingCo","Nov 05, 2003"
3.24,-15,4,2.5,3,4,4,"A light brown version of Altbier that pour with a burst of foam that settles to a thin collar. Starts with mostly caramel malt flavors. The hops become more noticeable later on and ending with a dry finish. There's some bits of toffee, and some buttery notes, but not much complexity. Fairly light-bodied with a smooth mouthfeel. A very quaffable Altbier. A beer that I believe would appeal to many beer drinkers looking to try a German beer other than a Spaten or Paulaner, something a wee bit more interesting.","marcobrau","Oct 18, 2003"
3.15,-17.3,3.5,3.5,3,4,2.5,"Color ís almost that of pine bark and head is off white and short lived. Scent is powerful and quickly brings a resemblance to molasses to mind. Flavor can best be sumed up into rye bread meets molasses meets brown sugar. Its a flavorful beer, the flavors however seem out of place. Its interesting at first but by the time I got to the bottom of the glass this beer's individuality had gotten on my nerves and I was already looking for something different. As I have had very little experience with Alt beers this may be typical for the style. German brewers are not known for their wild and unique creations like some American micros are. Mouthfeel was pleasant--silky, full, and satisfying.","allboutbierge","Oct 17, 2003"

3.58,-6,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This dark alt beer poured almost a clear brown with a nice off white head that stayed around for some time. The aroma was subtle but left a little malt in the nose. The bitterness jumps out and grabs the tongue, but lets the sweetness creap back in. The beer finishes with a light chocolate taste. The mouthfeel borders on creamy and is medium bodied. This beer is quite drinkable and is what I am hoping the alt in my keg that is fermenting now will taste like.","LarryKemp","Mar 13, 2003"
3.63,-4.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a clear deep brownish amber color with a thick and creamy off-white colored head that fades into a nice lace. Nose is sweet roasted malts and a bit of toffee. Smooth and quite slick mouthfeel but is a bit thin. Taste is sweet malts and molasses up front followed by some bready notes and a touch of a raisin-like flavor. Finish is dry. A nice brew, but nothing special.","Morris729","Feb 06, 2003"
4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"Thick and creamy off-white cloudtop head, lots of lace. Crystal clear dark copper color with slight carbonation. Toasty malt aroma with dark bread notes.

2.92,-23.4,2,2.5,3,3,3.5,"Quite easy to drink and quite a clean taste. Even though it lacked a lot of flavour, i couldn't find to much wrong with it,  probably a bit boring, but a nice session beer.
