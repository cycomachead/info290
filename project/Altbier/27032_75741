3.9,9.6,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly cloudy ruby red color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, plum, apple, light nuttiness, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, light chocolate, light nuttiness, plum, apple, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, light nuttiness, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and complexity of dark/bready malt. earthy hops, and light-moderate yeast fester flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and moderately creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice altbier. All around good robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/bready malt, earthy hop, and light-moderate yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 07, 2014"
