3.87,2.9,4.75,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Great looking beer. Glowing dark brown with a creamy off-white head. A decent Winter seasonal, but MUCH stronger and hoppier than a real Alt. Considering the seasonal competition, I wouldn't get it again though.","mobrado","Jan 05, 2015"

4.26,13.3,3.75,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,"Pours a deep, dark nut-brown with a thin lacy head. Tasted just plain awesome, with thick, sweet notes of molasses and malt with a refreshing evergreen hop bite. Went down smooth and easy despite the ABV. I didn't get to try a whole lot of it for myself, but I'm glad I didn't give it all away!","Sirwootalot","Dec 30, 2014"

3.9,3.7,4,4,4,3.5,3.75,"To me this drinks more like a strong ale than an alt. Really enjoyable and the malty sweetness and slight hoppiness paired very well with the halibut I had it with. I've gotten out of the habit of buying Ninkasi, but this was leftover from a six pack that my son in law had bought, so I'm glad he left it! I'd definitely buy this once in a while during the winter season.","PayDay",
