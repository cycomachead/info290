3.47,2.7,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.75,"Pours a deep amber color with a tan head that fades to some lacing. Aroma of malt caramel, dark fruit and hint of alcohol. Taste of malt, caramel sweetness, bit of dark fruit and spice. Mild bitterness with a dry but slightly sticky finish. Fairly medium body, smooth and malty with a definite feel of the alcohol. Enjoyable beer, reminds me of an Altbier but with a extra splash of alcohol.","soju6","Sep 27, 2013"
