3.9,3.2,,,,,,"Quite a tasty alt and quite drinkable, pronounced yeasty character that coats the palate toward the finish. Perhaps the start could be lightened a bit as the caramel gets a bit heavy, otherwise a flavourful session ale, but far short of my favourite from this brewery, still quite tasty and impressive.","mick303","Aug 15, 2014"
