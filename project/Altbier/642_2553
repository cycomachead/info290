3.77,2.4,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"This 'Altbier' (German for 'old style') style brew pours a pretty copper-amber in color with close to a finger of a off-white foamy head. Some 'ring-like' lacing is seen when sipped that sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of mostly nutty roasted malts. Pretty much is said for the taste as well with good very light bitter finish that doesn't last too long. Medium-bodied with good carbonation. Overall a tasty brew.","BeerWithMike","Jan 17, 2015"
