3.65,-0.3,,,,,,"Its been a long time I wanted to try this one. Finally got my hands on one. Clear beer. Effervescent too. Amber color. Nice creamy head thrones on top of it. Malty and some burnt caramel in the nose. Tastewise, the beer is more roasted malts than anything else. Very refreshing. Effervescent too but still sweet in the mouth. Light body to medium. Refreshing and delicious. A good summer beer with lots of taste! Cheers!","ZorPrime","Aug 09, 2014"

4.04,10.4,4.5,3.5,4.25,3.75,4.25,"Final Grade: 4.04, an impressive A-. Beau's Festivale is a fine session amber, offering an interesting harmony between the sweet, biscuity sweet malts and its grassy noble hop bill. This is probably one of my favourite offerings from this brewery - this is the second bottle I've purchased, and I could certainly see myself picking up a few more before it's out of season. Highly recommended to any fan of balanced, quaffable amber ales.","thehyperduck","Jan 15, 2014"
