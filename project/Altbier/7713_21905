I drank the hell out of all the Alts I could find when I was going to school in Germany in the late ‘90s, and wish I could find more of the real thing (yeah, I’m glaring at you, Alaskan Amber). Not terribly expensive, and seemingly no worse for wear despite being nearly 5 months past it’s best-by, I might take a chance on this again.","woemad","Jul 04, 2014"
