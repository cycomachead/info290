3.84,4.3,,,,,,"On-tap. Pours a lighter brown color. Tan head. Smells malty and Germanic. Flavor is yeasty with dark grain, dark bread and caramel. I enjoy the Altbier style and this one seems to fit right in line, although my experience with the style is mild at best. I loved its light body. One of the first craft beers I have ever tried but had it again and it sparked some nostalgia.","VelvetExtract","Oct 15, 2014"
