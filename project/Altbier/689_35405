The only thing I am sitting here wondering about is if Victor's Memoriale is really an Altbier, why did I get so much yeast flocculated in the dregs of the bottle? Enough nitpicking though, this beer is delicious and deceptively strong...really creeps up on you with that last sip.","smmeier819","Mar 02, 2013"

4.18,2.7,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Overall: Two Brothers does it again…this is a great ale…the flavor is dynamic and well rounded…I know that there’s a bit higher ABV here, but it’s not overly dominate like some in this range…malts and hops balance so nicely…this beer is absolutely perfect while watching Tom Brady do his thing versus, well, anybody…great beer, hope I find another before it’s gone…(4/5)","SerialHiker","Dec 17, 2012"
