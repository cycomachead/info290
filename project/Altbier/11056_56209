3.63,-5.7,4,4,3.5,3.25,3.5,"This rusty brew is intense and imposing, with organoleptics of toffee, butter, caramel and yeast layered around a minty pine-y center. Some citric hints sneak through on the tongue, to unfortunate effects as it clashes with the darker flavors. Furthermore the palate is flabby and coarse  with a premature finish. Extremely unfocused with some questionable choices made regarding the hops.","endovelico","Aug 06, 2014"

3.78,-1.8,4.25,4.25,3.5,4,3.5,"O: I expected a bit of a sweeter beer but this one is herbal, earthy and dry. I think I was expecting something more like a sticke doppelbock. This thing is seriously herbal and bread crusty. Not bad but a little too one-note at points.","Dope","Apr 16, 2014"

3.84,-0.3,4.25,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"O: my first experience with the style, I did not know what to expect. I am not sure whether I would purchase another bottle, but I am not unhappy with this beer. I think I need to enjoy more beers in the style for a better feel.","polloenfuego","Apr 03, 2014"
4.12,7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"375ml bottle. Stange glass. Deep amber color, foggy appearance. Yellowish off-white froth creates a close, foamy & lasting crown leaving lacing on sides. Caramel, Munich malt & fudge chocolate intense aromas. As expected from aromas, sweet toasted upfront yields to chocolate flavors. Full body. Soft carbonation. Viscous palate. Hints of toasted biscuit & bread, herbal notes & dried nut touch. Long & smooth sweet/bitter finish. Nuts are back on the aftertaste. Solid malty backbone holds hoppiness in well balance, despite its high IBU profile. Nice spot of the Sticke Style: hoppier - but bitterness remains clean- & more caramelish maltiness -but no cloying at all- than a regular Alt & finally a well integrated ABV. Flavorful & delicious!! A masterpiece.","GONZALOYANNA","Jan 26, 2014"

2.92,-24.2,4.5,2.5,2.75,4,2.75,"Beer is medium to meidum-light in body, with carbonation of medium to medium-low intensity, leading to a mouthfeel that is lightly foamy (1/3) and otherwise smooth (2/3). Generally soft and smooth, this manages to fit well with the profile of the beer and the style. Closes very dry, with heavy stickiness clinging to the palate and lips.","falloutsnow","Aug 25, 2013"
