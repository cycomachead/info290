4.29,7.8,4.25,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Beginning is very soft on the palate, with lots of earth and whole-grain bread, while a subtle biscuit touch adds sweeter hints to it. Malt body then turns particular bitter for an Alt, still accompanying the malts. Finishes with slightly sour, soft yeasty hints, while a dry, bitter hop note becomes more present. Inconvenient bitter, very complex, with a distinct flowery, dry hop note amongst a bready malt body.","aleigator","Sep 17, 2014"
