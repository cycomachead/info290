Tiny chunks of sediment are seen floating around in the beer after the pour. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, and biscuit aromas. Taste is much the same with caramel and herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip.

Taste follows nose - the perfect balance of malt and hops with just a kiss of earthiness at the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-light in consistency with a smooth body and a slight bite at the finish.

There are some visible bubbles rising in the beer, but not many. Lacing is left down the side of the glass during consumption. The aroma is nice and malty (caramel with some brown bread) with some woody and grassy notes from the hops. The rich, yet delicate maltiness of this beer is up front with the hops providing some of that woody and grassy flavor from the hops. The malt character of this beer is bready with some mild caramel sweetness. Like a previous reviewer, I would agree there is more hop bitterness than you would expect from the aroma, but it is well-balanced with the malt backbone. There's a lot of flavor in this sub-5.0% ABV beer. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. This beer has high drinkability and a dry finish. This is an excellent beer.","acevenom","Jan 09, 2013"

Grassy and distinct Noble hops notes in the finish, with a big herbal and earthy quality. Mouthfeel is medium light, with a medium low carbonation and substantial hop character in the finish. Quite nice all around, and having a greater fruit character than most altbiers I've had before.

So with that said, I had this wonderful beer at the Brickstore Pub in Decatur GA yesterday. It was served to me in proper glassware a .2L glass with the breweries name printed on it. Small was of sweet malt which is something I normally don't like. I would also say that I was almost put off cause it had a hint of skunkyness to it. Once I tasted it thought the thought of that was quickly gone. It had a very nice caramel taste with just enough bitterness to round it out. The aftertaste was something I can't put my finger on, some kind of warm fruit that's just not distinguishable to me. Overall a wonderful beer that I will be wanting again soon.

Nicely appetizing dark copper color with some ruby-amber highlights. The nose is wonderfully fresh with spicy hops and crackery malts. Some fermentation-derived notes, like a bit of fruity bubblegum pops up in the midst of the honeyed complexity. On the palate, firm-but-mild tea like bitterness starts things off and moves further back on the tongue, gaining in power, through the palate. The malts start to round out at the mid-palate, displaying some nice chewiness and depth, before the finish dries out in hoppy glory. Mouthfeel is pretty heavy on carbonation, but its soft carbonation that feels pretty natural. Good weight for sessioning, in spite of the slightly high ABV. Overall, this is a fantastic beer.

Bitterness is easily an equal to sweetness and the hop flavour starts of herbal and builds almost to the point of being medicinal before the finish, where is switches to lingering mint. Very distinctive and quite tasty. Dried fruit provides some additional sweetness in the middle. Refined, well-integrated carbonation with a good body that dries out by the finish.

The aroma of this beer is rather sweet, that of caramel type malt and maybe a sherry aroma, judging by this and the bottle date, the beer may be a bit over the hill, well see. I cannot detect much of any hop aroma. The taste of this beer is quite complex. There are elements of malty sweetness, that of fruit, and bready notes. The hop bitterness is moderate and balances the sweetness of the beer nicely. After the swallow, the beer leaves my mouth rather dry with a moderate-low hop taste present, definitely wanting another sip. The beer is medium in body and rather highly carbonated, yet is incredibly smooth. Overall I truly enjoyed this one, not as much as the Uerige Sticke, but this was very good. I like the flavor of the beer best, along with the aftertaste, it really leaves you perfectly, not too sweet, not too bitter and not too dry, but rather the perfect mix of the three.

Poured into the closest thing I have to a traditional Altbier glass (a 14-ounce plum jam jar), Uerige Altbier Classic pours beautifully -- slightly hazy caramel-brown with a dense, meringue-like, light tan head. Aggressive carbonation. The nose is very modest, nearly absent: wispy aromas of oranges with doughy malts and some indeterminate spice (coriander seed? allspice?). The taste is far more forward, with flavors of toasted bread, orange pith, bergamot-infused tea, coriander, and a slight maple sweetness. Very complex. Great thick rings of foam lace the inside of the glass. Light in body, mellow carbonation on the palate. Dry finish -- with as complex a flavor profile as this beer has, it's got a remarkably clean mouthfeel. Altbier was the first style I truly fell in love with back when I first frequented the local brewpub in Lincoln, NE.

I'm surprised to find it so thirst-quenching and quaffable.

Nose is full of cookie dough malts and molasses backed by a spicy, kind of vegetal twang that balances nicely. Doughy sweet malt flavors flash up front, but quickly give way to toasted grain and spicy, bitter, dry hops. The most bitter alt I've had and probably the driest finishing. Nice.

The latter surprises me some since I thought alts were kind of well-aged and smoother. I also get some nice dark German-style malts, some caramel, and some graininess. All-in-all they blend nicely. The flavor is killer, in my opinion - its smooth, yes, but also complex with nice bitterness in the end and an easy maltiness as well that attacks your tongue and blends with some hop flavor notes too.

The cylindrical glass is perfect for capturing the nose and then quafffing a swallow. Tasty. Mouthfeel is thin to medium with a body to match. This is a fun drinking beer. I probably wouldn't suggest more than 3 or 4 in a setting. I might use it as a balancing beer between a malty brew and one that is predominately hoppy.","pentathlete","Jun 26, 2005"

The nose is mild, with sweet malt the overriding characteristic. The mouth is mildly carbonated and fairly light. The flavor follows suit at first, with lots of sweet, slightly caramel malt up front, backed by very little hops character at all. The bitterness builds steadily, though, rather like Ravel's Bolero. The hops are flowery in essence, with a twinge of carnation into the finish. The crescendo comes in the aftertaste, as a wave of good strong espresso flavor rolls across the tongue and down the throat some 10-15 seconds after the liquid is gone.

Anyway the color was red/copper and sealed on top with a one or two inch white bubbly head. A quiet fruit aroma - dark fruit, like passion fruit or a plum followed by a very small yeast aroma. The taste was above average. The hops and malt played well together. Very balanced portion of the plum, hops, and slight caramel. A well to do Alt, color, smell, taste and a clean velevety finish make this a heck of an above average brew. $4.50 a bottle harms this beers likeability though, I could spend $3.00 and get 6 Great Lakes or Rogue.","Ahhdball","Sep 26, 2004"

There was a small earth toned hop presence that added to the scent to the scent as well. Taste was of sweet caramel malt backed with more doughy malt. Hops gave it a slightly bitter after taste. The taste was very clean and dry which left you wanted more each time you took a sip. Pretty impressive taste for the size of the beer. Mouthfeel was medium with a nicely carbonated feel to it.

These hops are not bitter at all but really, really flavorful. They have a floral taste and a piney flavor. Honey sweetness lures behind the hops. A hazelnut base flavor comes from the yeast. Finish is dry and crisp but leaves just enough hoppiness for me to want more. To me, this is the ultimate session beer. The hops are very flavorful but not overly so.

I get hints of pine, flowers, and candied orange. The taste is a bit more washed out than the nose suggests. Though when tasted on draft at the source this is a completely different beer. It has a nice clean bitterness in the finish. The bitterness is preceded by a somewhat muted hop flavor that adds a bit of fruitiness to this beer, which shows what this beer could be like if sampled fresh at the brewery. Does have a nice level of maltiness here that is reminiscent of biscuits with a bit of caramel in it. It almost unfortunate that this is imported, this beer loses so much by leaving its home pub.

3.46,-13.1,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"The bottle came with a caveat from the vendor (Belmont Station): to be drunk very cold, not to let it warm up. This seemed strange to me, and perhaps the first warning sign that this sample was not all it could be. The beer pours a shadowy waxy amber with a substantial head that melts away and leaves a small amount of intricate lace on the glass. Nearly invisible musty aroma, which had all the fleeting substance of a disremembered dream. Some caramel malts up front, tempered with a winey roundness, a gentle nutty flavor, and a light apple quality. A deep-down roastiness reveals itself reluctantly, but adds a twinge of smoke and perhaps coffee. The taste, in itself, actually seems a bit hollow, with a rolling grassy bitterness in the finish that makes up a large part of the flavor. I found this to be an intriguing, enveloping beer, and was impressed by many of its complexities, but it wasn't as likeable as I hoped it would be. This bottle is the second time I've tried the beer; the first was a disastrously sour cask served at the Horse Brass. Based on the elusiveness of this bottled sample, I can only conclude that the beer is best when absolutely fresh, and travelling across both the Atlantic Ocean and the continental U.S. has done this beer absolutely no favors.","Thrasher","Jul 31, 2004"

A wonderful hops taste that remains on the edges of the tongue. Not a bitter hops taste but a green taste. I had a local version of Alt beer and it was much more watery and thin with little hops flavor. This has a little more depth and something going on with the hops. When I take a bit more of a bigger sip and swish it around I get a malty taste that is present but goes away much more quickly.

It definitely came across as stronger than the 6% listed here by the taste, but not sure about the effect. Hops were slightly noticeable but they were woven around a fruity flavor, but not particularly sweet. Bit of a bite. The alcohol flavor seemed to prevail over all else.

Taste is light malts upfront, with hops dominating the latter portion of the flavor. Expected a bit deeper malt character, but what do I know? (Note - As it warmed, a nutty characteristic became more pronounced, nice.) Mouthfeel excellent, and drinkability is endless.
