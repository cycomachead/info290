3.79,-3.3,3.75,3.5,4,3.75,3.75,"Enjoyed a few pints on tap at the Irish Times pub in Victoria, BC. A clear red-bronze amber beer with an inch or so of white head. Nose is quite fruity, almost evokes some banana along with mealy apples or pears, light molasses, vanilla, soap, and a characteristic noble hop floral note. The aroma was a tad estery for the style but pleasing enough. The style guidelines do translate quite well on the palate. This is a crisp, dry, bitter ale with some citrus, toasted caramel, and mineral notes. Very quenching and tart, with rather minimal sweetness (although I do get a hint of molasses kiss candy or perhaps saltwater taffy). Sourish crab apple, bitter orange peel, herbal bitters, and gooseberry flit in and out, is that some American hop in the form of faint grapefruit and pine? Fairly high carbonation and thin, well-attenuated body that reminds one of a lager. Finishes quite clean, with a refined bitterness and echoes of citrus and chalk. Really quite a wonderful alt even if the nose threw me off for a moment. Classic session brew that drinks well but manages to hold one's attention over the course of several pints.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 05, 2013"
