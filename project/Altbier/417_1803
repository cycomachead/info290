4.24,13.7,4.5,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"This 'Altbier' (Old beer) style brew pours a very deep reddish-mahogany in color with a good 2-3 finger off-white foamy and creamy head that finally settled down to a good 3mm or so after a good bit. A good amount of ring-like lacing is seen as well as some sheets when sipped. The aroma is of dark malts with some hints of caramel, cocoa and biscuit. Bit more going on with the taste as there is some dark fruits (figs, cherries, plums) with some brown sugar also. Very tasty and smooth. A very light dry hoppy finish is noted but is very slight which actually added some character. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation. Overall another very tasty brew from this brewery.","BeerWithMike","Sep 13, 2014"
