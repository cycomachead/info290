3.63,3.1,4,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,"The color is dark amber with translucent clarity and thick beige head with fine bead and some lace with good retention. The smell has a slight fruity yeast aroma with subtle sweet malt scent and gentle hop note with hint of fruity yeast ester as it warms with light alcohol. The feel has medium high carbonation with  slight spice and light sweetness and gentle toasted aspect with mostly dry bitter finish with mild alcohol influence on the palate. The feel leads to a mix of malt with toasted flavor and spicy/herbal hop with gentle malt backing and slightly bitter hops with a malt emphasis on toasted grain flavor and finish is spicy bitter and mostly dry. This is a decent alt but more emphasis on hops than is necessary for the style could use more malt to fit even though it is still very drinkable and yeast seems to be a proper alt strain based on aroma and flavor","Slatetank","Jan 15, 2015"

3.04,-13.6,3.5,2.5,3,3.75,3.25,"Overall:  This is a pretty tasty beer.  Good notes of toasted malt and brown sugar-like sweetness balanced well with some good hops.  It is a highly quaffable beer.  Definitely worth a try.","Jeffreysan","Dec 18, 2014"
