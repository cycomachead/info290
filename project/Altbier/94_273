2.87,-25.8,4,2.5,2.75,3.25,3,"Poured a light amber color with a little head that leaves some lacing behind. Smells of malts, some hops, but mostly an ether type smell. Taste has a good balance at the presentation till the end where it starts tasting like it smells. Feel is overall pretty smooth. It's a pretty average beer with a different taste.","Mrbseward","Mar 19, 2015"

Maybe my pallet has just been destroyed by the extremeness of the modern beer scene, or maybe this was just an off batch.  Either way, I was let down.","mynie","Mar 12, 2015"
