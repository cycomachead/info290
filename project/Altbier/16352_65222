3.6,-0.6,,,,,,"Review according to BJCP2008 guidelines (style 7C). AROMA: predominant malt aroma. almost absent hop aroma and absent esters. APPEARANCE: Orange copper color, clear, ivory persistent and creamy head. TASTE: well balanced flavour between moderate bitterness and complex malt. dry finish. very low esters, no diacetyl. Finishes dry. very low hop flavours. PALATE: medium to light body and very smooth. no astringency. OVERALL: a very well balanced, bitter and malty ale. requires a bit more hop aromas and flavours.","titvs","Aug 07, 2014"
