3.21,-7,3.75,3.25,3.25,3,3,"Pours a dark copper amber with a large lasting creamy beige head. Aroma and taste is of toasted caramel malt and grains, some grass notes, mildly fruity with a bitter finish on the end. Palate is a medium body with good carbonation. The finish is the same as taste with a good sweet toasted caramel malt and nutty flavor and a bitter ending for balance. Nothing really standout but overall a good drinking brew.","Samp01","Aug 03, 2014"
