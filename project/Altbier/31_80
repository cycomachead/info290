Floral aromas join light fruit and grain on the nose. The palate starts with a hint of sweetness and finishes dry with a little fruity tartness. Light grains form the backbone. Medium body and medium low carbonation. Very easy to drink and very refreshing.","pat61","Dec 06, 2014"

3.98,9.9,4,4,4,3.75,4,"Pours a pale golden amber with a copious quantity of puffy white foam floating on top. Aroma is sweet grains and some bubble gum and cherry fruity notes, along with another earthy or perhaps musty element. Bready and quite sweet on the palate, with some breakfast cereal, popcorn and toast, classy floral hops and an emergent citrus note, orange I would say.  Pleasantly assertive but not overpowering hops. Rather fruity. Light thin body and moderate carbonation. For some reason I am surprised that this is so appealing. More sweet and gentle than my conceptualization of the alt style but a great session brew, with enough complexity to hold one's attention.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 13, 2014"
