3.65,2.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A sweet, slightly crisp, slightly bitter, appropriately malt-dominant Alt.  There's really not much to say about this somewhat turbid, orange-brown beer: it's a very solid, very conventional alt.  It doesn't have a lot of depth, in terms of character or flavor, and it's even a bit thin in the mouth, but it basically subscribes to the general premise of Alts.  It's drinkable, if a little malt-dry—mostly toasted biscuit, and a bit of nut—and its hop-bitterness wavers in the wrong direction just a tad—not cleansing as much as it should; lingering more than it should—but it's an altogether competent, drinkable brew.","OrestesMethuon","Nov 11, 2014"
