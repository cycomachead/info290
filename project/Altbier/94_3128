3.31,-6.8,3.75,2.75,3.5,3.25,3.5,"O: Overall I would say this is an easy beer to drink.  If i was introducing one of my 40 oz or Bud friends to something else this would be a great pick.  Personally I like a little more presence and bite, but this is a good well crafted easy on the mouth independently brewed beer.  The ABV was @ 5% and if I was to guess I would imagine this was the beer they brewed to introduce the masses to their line as it's a great spot on beer for just that.","ravisingh","Feb 10, 2015"
