3.25,-21.1,4,4,2.75,3.5,3,"Hard to review this beer. It smells fantastic; all the rich malty notes from quality dark european beers like toffee, raisin, molasses, etc. The taste follows the aroma but it's just too sweet for me to drink the whole bottle. Mouthfeel is full, a little syrupy. Sweetness lingers after the swallow. So although I couldnt finish the bottle because the sweetness was a bit cloying, I can tell its well made, and is what it is, really. I can others enjoying it if you have a sweet tooth. I imagine it would go well with game meat.","jbertsch","Jan 11, 2015"

Wonderfully balanced, quirky beer with a complex mix of flavours - caramel, raisins, prunes, lots of malt - not overly sweet. Shares some characteristics with Doppelbocks, but the alcohol is much better disguised. Really hope to track this down again.","His_Royal_Hoppiness","Nov 19, 2014"
