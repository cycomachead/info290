3.78,4.7,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Got in a BIF from ZebraCakez. 22 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled in 11/2014. Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of toast, biscuit, nuttiness, light caramel, light pear/apple, herbal, floral, grass, light pine, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of bready malt, earthy hops, and light-moderate yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of toast, biscuit, nuttiness, light caramel, light pear/apple, herbal, floral, grass, light pine, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Light amount herbal/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of toast, biscuit, nuttiness, light caramel, floral, grass, light pine, light pear/apple, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of bready malt, earthy hops, and light yeast ester flavors; with a good bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 5%. Overall this is a very good altbier style. All around good robustness and balance of bready malt, earthy hops, and light yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. This is hoppy for an altbier, but the flavors were very much what I expected for the style. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 20, 2014"

3.5,-3,,,,,,"Overall this is a great offering from Buzzards Bay Brewing. I like that it isn't one of their more hop forward, less malty, beers. It does have a great caramel malty taste, and it is very clean and easy drinking. Bring this beer to your next fall gathering and pair it with some sausages!","ThomasMetal75","Aug 25, 2014"
