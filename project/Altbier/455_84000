Its aroma was pleasant enough and consisted of sweet toasted malts. The flavour began with a sweet, rich roasted maltiness which gave way in the finish to a mild, slightly earthy bitterness. These flavours were nicely balanced and all lingered on as a pleasant aftertaste. Relatively light bodied for a beer this dark and with a fine carbonation, I found the mouthfeel to be a bit thin for my personal taste. Overall though, this fairly uncommon style of beer is probably the best of Creemoreâ€™s offerings, and certainly worth a try at $2.85 per can.","BuckyBeerBeaver","Feb 04, 2014"

3.74,4.5,4,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Clear and coppery with a short cap of fine bubbles. Solid sheets of lace covered the glass. Floral hop aroma, toffee and biscuit malt, slight lemon, a hint of smoke. Same character in the flavour, but with moderate bitterness. Nicely balanced with lingering lemon. Light bodied, average carbonation, decent texture. Pretty good, pleasant to drink.","DrJay","Dec 03, 2013"
