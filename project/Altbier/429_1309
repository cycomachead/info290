A little high on the carbonation, a little above medium carbonation.  I like medium carbonation, would have been a higher rating if the carbonation was lighter.","bottomfisher","Sep 13, 2014"

3.5,-3.6,,,,,,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was a nice example of an Altbier, it had all the aspects that I would expect from the style and it had some nice balance with no off flavors.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, fairly clean, crisp, not filling and the taste did decent job of holding my attention, I could see myself drinking a few of these, especially in the fall.  What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style it was, it was a straight up true example of an Altbier.  What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything about this beer that I disliked or would change.  I would buy this beer again when in the  mood for the style and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Altbiers or malty beers in general.  All in all I was happy with this beer, it was just what I expect from a good Altbier and nothing else.  So far this is my favorite beer from this brewery and I think it's close to being one of the better Altbiers out there.  Good job guys, this was a nice tasting Altbier, keep up the solid work.","StoutHunter","Sep 09, 2014"

I'm not sure if Alaskan considers themselves to be a "craft" beer, but as of now from what I've tried, I'd rate them only slightly better than Shock Top...","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Sep 06, 2014"

3.9,7.4,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 10/21/2014. Pours slightly hazy deep orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, raisin, plum, apple, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, raisin, plum, apple, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, raisin, plum, apple, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and light earthy hop flavors; with great robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and fairly creamy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice altbier style. All around good balance and robustness of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 15, 2014"

Smell is malt, biscuit, molasses, and a little yeast. Taste is different than I expected, I thought this would be more of a Newcastle type brown ale, but it's not. Taste is more sweet than expected. Malt, molasses and brown sugar with a bit of a sour finish. Guess it's more an altbier than anything. Pretty decent brew.","kwc017","Jan 16, 2014"

Nose is mainly nutty before the maltiness takes ovee, with the taste strictly following the nose's lead. The taste initially bares a nuttiness that ever so briefly presents a faint banana essence before the malts overwhelm all else. Finish is "blech" with a cloying sweetness. Pretty high level of carbonation here as wwll. Overall, this is fairly average.","gopens44","Jun 27, 2013"

Scents of sweet malt, bubblegum and slight banana. Pleasant, matches well with the flavor, but again, nothing too special. Flavors of sweet malt, a little bit of toffee and a slight nutty flavor on the finish. Pretty nice, similar to a brown ale, but with a slightly more German flavor profile. Hop character is low, but is present, balancing the sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Good for a session beer. Overall I'd say it's a pretty good beer. I can see this being a good session ale.","Auraan","Jun 13, 2013"

I can never get much head on it like they have in the picture, but I’m guessing that was poured on tap. It’s too sweet for my liking, so in that way I think it’s more of an Amber than and Alt, but it definitely has some Alt characteristics.

Plenty of malt and caramel smells eminating, with nice sweet fruity tones to complement. A small amount of acidity in the nose, but not overly so. Tastes much like the smell, big malt, fruit, some acidity, and a slight bitter aftertaste. The aftertaste is my biggest complaint on this beer, as I found this fuzzy, bitter/sour flavor that I didn't much enjoy. The carbonation also carries this same flavor to the front of the profile. Body is hearty and appropriate to style (and very enjoyable). A nice representation of Altbier, drinkable and warming, but needs some work around the edges.","mwbeerman","Dec 08, 2011"

3.53,-2.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Clear dark amber or copper colored with one finger of head that had good retention. The head settles to a thin cap with just a light speckling of lace. I smell caramel from the malt and some grassy hops. A bit weak in the aroma department. In the flavor the malt gives a little bit of toasted quality that I did not pick up in the aroma. Otherwise caramel and slightly medicinal flavor from the hops. Pretty well balanced. The body is a little thin. Otherwise had nice carbonation. An easy enough beer to drink but lacks excitement so I rate just better than average.","morimech","May 08, 2011"

This is a traditional Alt style beer and has much in common flavor wise with a German Pils or Czech Lager. The color is medium copper with a thin head that quickly dissipates to an average lace. The nose is faint but appealing with notes of apple and a slight hint of spice, maybe cinnamon. The palate is all lager as far as I am concerned. (Remember Altbier was made before Lager and despite being top fermented, they share much in common with Lagers are far as flavors). The traditional Lager character, that kind of old bubble gum flavor is present but it nudges out any other discernable flavors. The texture is light and doesn't suit the beer all that much. It is very smooth and drinkable though I could probably only top off two since it is rather boring.

Nose is sweet malt, hints of caramel and maybe brown sugar, delightful at any rate, start is mildly sweet, the grain presence ideal and the top light to medium in feel.

Good flavor though i like my Alts a little more hoppy like Zum Ueridge and as this is an american example it is ok in it's own right.

It's present in the nose, and then again in the flavor... big time! It's very nicely balanced as well, leaving it sweetish and nutty, but not sweet. The emphasis is, however, clearly on the malt, and not the hops. The hops that are present are floral, slightly grassy, and just a touch spicy; but they lay low, giiving only a waft of character to the nose, and an accent of "spice" to the flavor. And that is what gives this beer its incredible roundness and balance. It's rich without being cloying, and oh-so-delicately balanced by its restrained hop flavors and bitterness. It finishes almost without notice, leaving just a smear of nutty, toasty and biscuity malt to linger on the palate; and lending greatly to its drinkability by beckoning you to partake again.

3.89,7.2,3,4,4,3.5,4,"Largely clear, coppery-amber in hue with a slight golden influence, the color is pleasant. The head formed poorly, only a small cap of bubbles topped the liquid and these bubbles fizzled away to an insignificant collar in a moment, before leaving completely. This does nothing but hurt the appearance. There was no subsequent lacing. Honestly the appearance from top to bottom is too average to be noteworthy. The nose said, Alt on the first sniff. I like that. Sweet, grainy malts with a biscuity caramel underscore. In the middle is a lovely array of fruity aromas, peaches and strawberries. The finish offers a soft smattering of earthy, grassy hops. The nose is perfectly articulate, the potency of these aromas is moderate but I understand what it is saying. Inviting. Ive had more dud Alts then good ones. Surprisingly this falls into the latter category. I havent been impressed with Alaskan Brewery (aside from the AK Smoked Porter). I was expecting this offering to be lifeless and limp. It wasnt. Upfront is a blast of malty sweetness with undercurrents of grainy, biscuty qualities and this says nothing of the caramel influences. This maltiness lingers awhile. In the middle is a kiss of astringency and most of the fruity tastes (berries, peaches, and oranges). In the finish, like the nose, are the hops, earthy, grassy with a mild bitterness that does manage to balance the beer nicely. The palate is well crafted, I am impressed, and I find this Alt to be quite tasty. This beer would be great for a crossover beverage; I can see no reason why this beer couldnt supplant Fat Tire as the reigning western amber ale. I guess Alaskan needs to get a catchy name for this beer and find a wider distribution area. Details. Around medium in body, the carbonation level is on the low side of moderate but it feels natural. The mouthfeel is a bit slick but appropriate. Pleasant. This beer is very drinkable. Give me six full bottles and Ill return you six empty bottles... in no time flat! There isnt anything special about this beer but not every beer needs to be mind blowing. Sometimes simple tasty quaffable is all a beer needs to be. I say, well done with this one. I purchased a 12-ounce bottle on-line from Liquid Solutions.","bditty187","Feb 19, 2005"

There are no real hops that I can pick out. Its not a bad beer. The feel is thin to moderate, with a bit too much carbonation for me. Drinkability is just okay.

Head dissipated rather quickly. Nose of light caramel and a distinct nuttiness. Seems fairly well balanced, easy to drink. Nuttiness comes through in the mouth, I am wondering if it should have labled Nut Brown Ale instead. As i resampled this after about 10 minutes in the glass, it body had develped, and the finish pleasantly lengthened.

3.25,-10.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"The beer pours an amber color with a thin off-white lace head. The aroma is decent. It has a weak malt scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts and a grainy finish. The taste is slightly above average. It has a light feel with a bit of sweet malts and a dry finish. It is a little weak for my taste, plus the recipe is quite basic. The mouthfeel is average as well. It is a medium bodied beer with not enough carbonation. This beer was a disappointment. It had little character and horrible mouthfeel.

Once again the beer had a deep amber body, head retention was poor as was lacing. Caramel malt aroma, some sweetness, and grain. Taste profile was much better than before. Much more malty than hoppy, a bit of a roasted note here and there. Very very smooth. Says it's an Alt beer, tastes more dark lager than ale like. Good mouthfeel and highly drinkable when in the mood for some thing smooth and mellow. This beer is becoming a staple in my fridge. Heck, even my parents loved it!! Had this beer on tap at a local pub and it is much better than the bottle. Bottled version has poor lacing, sometimes none at all. On tap it was sheeting the glass.","Mark","May 23, 2004"

4.39,20.9,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Another in a long list of classic brews that I've taken too long to review. Pours a deep mahogany in color, with pleasingly ample carbonation and a thinnish, cream-colored head. The aroma is quite tempting -- toasty, slightly nutty malt with a bit of difficult-to-place fruitiness. Rich and hearty smelling for those cold Alaska nights, days, afternoons, etc. The flavor starts sweet up front, developing a rich, deep, malt body that lingers at the back of the throat. Finishes off with a toasty turn to the malt, and a pleasant but restrained hop bitterness. Very well balanced, though leaning a bit toward the sweet side. Medium-full in body, and damn drinkable.","mzwolinski","Feb 11, 2004"

I poured it into a pint glass taking note of the clarity of the amber color which retained very little, if any head. But it did retain carbonation, which is more than I can say about some beers I've had in the past (you know who you are). The taste was weak by my standards, but then I'm a porter, ipa man.

4.3,18.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Thanks to Genaro for bringing me my first Alaskan beer! This Alt pours a deep, dark amber. The off-white head fades rather fast into a very thin coating. The aroma is mostly of sweet caramel, honey and light fruity notes. The malt is creamy and sweet, and just a bit smoky. Again, caramel and honey comes to mind in the flavor department. A light citrus bitterness and mild spicy taste make for a subdued and balanced brew. I could drink quite a few of these babies.
