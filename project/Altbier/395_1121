3.7,6,,,,,,"Hazy amber/brownish color with a tan head that gives way to decent lacing.  Both the smell and tastes are a good combination of malt and floral hops.  Very refreshing.  The finish is neither dry nor sweet.  The mouthfeel is good as is the carbonation level.  Overall this is a great beer to have with hot wings (which I did) and with the lower ABV it is an excellent session beer.","Retroman40","Apr 26, 2014"
