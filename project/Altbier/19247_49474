4.23,4.2,4.25,3.75,4.5,4.25,4.25,"BOD 10/29/14.   Pours a clear medium amber with a rich garnet cast.  Normal head volume, exceptional lacing and normal retention.  Light nose of biscuit with a bready background over a light caramel.  As it warms, earthy noble hop notes are present. Heavy light body with a bit of creaminess and oiliness that produces a very smooth texture.  I've never encountered so much texture in a body this light - exceptional job.  Well carbonated with effervescence from the middle on.  The World Class flavor profile is reasonably intense, superbly balanced and a bit complex.  It begins with bready biscuit that flows into a very mild bitterness.  As the bitterness fades, a slightly sweet caramel base is noted along with a hint of nuts.  The finish is fairly clean and here is where the hop flavor comes forward, which I believe is Hallertau Mittlefruh. An outstanding Altbier.","tillmac62","Dec 27, 2014"
