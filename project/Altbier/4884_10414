2.99,-18.1,2.5,3.5,3,3,2.5,"Nothing special here. Maybe this bottle is a bit past its prime (expires in two months), but I don't see this being much better fresh.","dasenebler","Dec 26, 2008"
3.2,-12.3,3,3,3.5,3,3,"This beer poured out as a reddish brown color with a tan colored head that was pretty thin. The aromas were of a lot of grains and malt. There isn't a whole lot of hops on the nose or much else. Perhaps a little spice but that's about it. The taste is mostly dry malt, some fresh leaves some other flavors of nature in there. The mouthfeel is medium, It's drinkable and worth trying again. I was better than I expected.","Knapp85","Dec 25, 2008"
3.57,-2.2,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"A dark but clear rosey mahogany color with an off-white/grey whimpy head that fades to a ring with modest lacing. The aroma is a malty-root, brown sugar and sour mash. The flavor is sour malt and weak wheat grain goodness. But it's quite thin and watery, minimal carbonation, a bit tingly. Drinkable but not desirable particularly. I can't really pick up any other qualities, just kind of non-descript, not one I will revisit.","Durge","Dec 05, 2008"
3.53,-3.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"this was my first alt beer that i remember. i've had others since, but i figured i'd review this one first.","beerorRIP","Nov 17, 2008"

3.48,-4.7,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Medium body at best, with a rather astringent mouthfeel. An easy drinker with the mild alcohol not really noticeable, except in the nose. Worth a try for the style and a nice re-useable bottle.","scottoale","Oct 14, 2008"
3.26,-10.7,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Poured a dark copper with a medium tan head. Lots of caramel and bread in the aroma. Flavor was dense with caramel and malt, with a bitter end. No hops, mostly sour apple. Some fruitiness, with a heavier than expected mouthfeel. Its okay, but not worth doing again.","magictrokini","Oct 01, 2008"
4.33,18.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Appearance is crystal clear, deep chocolate brown with ruby red highlights and a rocky off-white head that lingers for only a moment or two to settle in a thin layer. Aroma has bready malts with notes of milk chocolate and bread dough along with some faint flowery noble hops. The taste is very complex and it took me nearly the whole glass to nail down all the flavors. Up front I'm hit with sweet chocolate and bread dough. Through the middle I taste those flowery noble hops and hazelnut. Then in the finish is a distinct sherry-like note. Medium to medium low mouthfeel makes this highly drinkable and the restrained carbonation compared to most other German lagers I think really helped bring out the robust flavors. I really enjoyed this beer a lot and I'm upset I didn't pick up more bottles. Oh well, I guess I'll have to buy more!","beerkittycat","Sep 06, 2008"
3.89,6.6,3,4,4,3.5,4,"D: Overall a good drinking and hoppy alt with rich ripe fruit makes this and enjoyable experience that was rich and fruity and smooth going down.","beerthulhu","May 04, 2008"
3.46,-5.2,4,3,3.5,3,4,"I bought this in a 0.5 liter bottle that had a resealable top, like grolsch. It pours with very little head, which went away quickly, with no lacing. Very dark brown. It has a nutty smell with hints of sweetness. And the taste is similar, with malt. Medium carbonation. This is my first try with an altbier, so I have no others to compare it to. I do like it, even though it is a little on the light side for my taste.","junkman203","Mar 21, 2008"
4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability: Works for me. Not too heavy, not too much alcohol content, good taste. Not much can go wrong with a couple of these.","kshankar","Mar 11, 2008"
4.1,12.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This is a pretty delicate beer, with light flavors and aromas, but it's pretty good. There is something to be appreciated about that. Very recommended.","BeerSox","Mar 06, 2008"
3.71,1.6,4,3,4,3.5,4,"Appearance is deceiving. It looks a lot heavier than it really is. The color of cherry coke, with a thin white head that slowly dissipates into an even lacing. It has a very subtle aroma, similar to that of a traditional Scottish Amber but with more of a sweetness. It's a full-bodied taste that goes down incredibly smooth. Has a relatively mild bitterness in the aftertaste and a watery mouthfeel. Not quite enough "uumph" for my personal preference, but I certainly can't put it down. This is a genuine beer-drinkers' beer.","jmscott","Feb 01, 2008"
3.71,1.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,4.5,"Light in body and fairly thin on the tongue. Smooth and lightly carbonated. Lacks a bit in flavor, but enjoyable and very drinkable. Good session beer that won't get in the way.","Lupe","Jan 07, 2008"
4.03,10.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability: very good, great smooth taste and easy to drink. Would make a great session beer.","sbe1","Jan 05, 2008"
3.4,-6.8,4,4,3,3,3.5,"Drinkability: I'm on the fence with this one. It started off nice with the appearance and unique aroma, but it finished off rather weak. It wasn't all that hoppy and it wasn't all that unique.","AltBock","Jan 02, 2008"
3.23,-11.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Drinkability- Worth a try, but it ain't great.","theopholis","Dec 06, 2007"
4.77,30.7,4.5,5,5,4,4.5,"Pours a dark brownish amber color with a nice lace of head. Smell has fruity and malty aromas. Taste is fruity but very complex also. It's lightly carbonated and goes down extra smooth with a slight bitterness towards the end. The hops and malts are perfectly balance. The is one fine brew and I can't imagine and Altbier getting much better than this.","DrainBamage",
