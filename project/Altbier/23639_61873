3,-18.9,,,,,,"Drank straight from the bottle while walking to the drug store to buy trash bags. Beer has this bizarre mineral taste I can't place. Burton water salts? Heard that a large portion of Munich malt may contribute this flavor too. Would prob taste better paired with food. On it's own a little weak, but not bad for walking around the hood on a mission. Bet it'd be real good in chili or used to steam sausages.","GurgglyBurgglers",
