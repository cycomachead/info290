3.7,-7.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"From notes at the brewery: Pours a slightly hazy copper orange with a spotty-lacing off-white head. Aroma of lightly sweet caramel malt and Bavarian yeast with a touch of lemon and banana esters. Starts with average fullness and mild toasty malt and rye sweetness with a hint of clove toward a dry crisp finish. A pretty unique and drinkable brew with good authenticity. Enjoyed the cheeseburgers here!","CuriousMonk","May 17, 2009"
3.98,-0.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Beer is medium body (a little heavier than expected), nice wheat like character (or is that the rye). I was expecting some more rye spice to this beer but I didn't get it. There is some banana ester flavors in the back mouth / aftertaste, not unpleasant. Good drinkability, good mouthfeel. Overall a good beer.","drabmuh","Oct 04, 2008"
