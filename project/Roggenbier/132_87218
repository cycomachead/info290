Aroma does evoke weizen yeast spice and dark sweet malts with a whiff of smoke and fruit. The beer starts with some caramel and biscuit malts and a vanilla bourbon-like rounded sweetness that is really quite nice. The smoke is subdued in my view; do not be deterred by this. The weizen yeast flavors are also subtle, at least to my palate. I don't get much banana but there is some plum on the finish. Peppery spice makes an appearance but once more is mellow. The malts add coffee flavors and the rye adds a grainy spicy bite but overall the beer is smooth and balanced. Think brown porter with weizen yeast rather than a dunkelweizen.","CalgaryFMC","Aug 30, 2013"

Aroma is caramel malt with slightly sour, spicy rye and light grassy hops. Flavor is a very well melded caramel and biscuit malt, rye and slight nuttiness that is somewhat subdued, but so nicely integrated that it is quite satisfying. An unexpectedly nice medium creamy body with excellent mouth feel. A nice, understated roggenbier that seems a bit bland at first, but won me over with a very satisfying balance and flavor. A nice roggenbier that I will buy again.","LiquidAmber","Aug 25, 2013"

3.78,8.6,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"22 ounce bottle into signature pint glass; no bottle date, but a late 2012 release.

Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big spicy rye, caramel, toast, brown bread, smoke, light roast, pepper, clove, light citrus, floral, and roasted earthiness. Nice, pleasant, and unique aromas with good balance and complexity of malt notes with moderate hops; with solid strength. Taste of spicy rye, toast, brown bread, caramel, smoke, light roast, light clove, pepper, floral, pine, light citrus, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of rye, caramel, toast, brown bread, light roast, pepper, floral, pine, light citrus, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of flavors with good malt complexity and robustness; nice hop/malt flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth and lightly creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good Roggenbier! Nice balance and complexity of malt flavors with moderate hops; and very smooth to drink.

The dominant flavor is an interesting mix of the spicy rye character and smokiness. There's some brown bread and earthiness. The body is medium with moderate carbonation.

Based on what I've read though, it does sound like it stays true to the style. That said, I doubt I'd buy this beer again. It's fair, but this isn't a style I can see myself getting into and, based on the lack breweries producing it, I think a lot of people feel the same way.","TheSixthRing","Feb 05, 2013"

The nose comprises rye bread, light black pepper, and a vague sense of some sort of orange character. The taste keeps some of the spiciness and breadiness and adds a decent helping of soap. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly chewy-ish feel. Overall, this beer just didn't sit right with me. There's no real sense of weizen-yeast character, the rye doesn't meld well with anything else, and the flavors just fall flat.","TMoney2591","Jan 31, 2013"

More rye than most beers and whiskies alike, so points abounding there, I suppose, but there's not much more worthy here beyond that pithy foreign reference.","biboergosum","Jan 26, 2013"

But this beer is also the CDA of rye beers, judging from color and aromatic profile. And a good CDA at that.","hreb","Dec 24, 2012"
