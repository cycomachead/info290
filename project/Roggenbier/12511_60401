3.04,-12.1,3.25,3,3,3.25,3,"Overall: I was very excited about this one but felt a bit let down, which probably led to the relatively low grade. Was hoping for a finnish rye bread and wheat sweetness but ended up with a rather strange, flowery and perfume-ish beer. It's drinkable though.","humulus","Apr 05, 2013"

3.83,10.7,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Not overly complex but a decent balance of banana/yeast/wheatness with caramel maltyness. Malt flavor is more honey caramel as opposed to much darker/roasted flavors. Some spicyness in there, not nearly as much as american rye beers though. Different, i guess its not a typical roggenbier in that its wheat based.","BigCheese","Sep 19, 2010"

4.4,27.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"However, when I was state side, I managed to have a fresh glass of the Bruery's Rugbrod on tap at the Ginger Man in NYc, and I remember a slightly more spiced character, but this is every bit as good, and unlike Rugbrod, not so strong, so a glass doesnt overwhelm you tastes. I would award 5 on smell and taste, but I havent tried all Rye beers in the world to try, so maybe a edit in the future, but for now, a strong contender for the best! Cheers, heres to a good discovery.","czfreeman","Aug 01, 2010"
