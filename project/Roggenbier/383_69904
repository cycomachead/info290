3.97,0.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"O: Overall, I really enjoyed this. It seems I may have gotten an infected batch, as my experience with the flavor and aroma was quite different than all the other reviews I see, and it has a significant tart character. However, I enjoyed that aspect of it. I'd like to try this again sometime, to see if it taste at all the same as this one.","zac16125","Aug 31, 2012"

3.91,-1.3,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The aroma was rich, Lots of caramel mixed in as well. providing a slightly sweet balance to it. The only downside would have to be the lightness of the aroma, needed a little more kick. The flavor was very well rounded. Started with a nice punch of caramel, with a decent roasted malt, and smoked quality coming through in the middle. Light grain and bready nature with a decidedly sweet finish to it that rolled off the tongue with a subtle tone. There was a very nice feel on this one, coating would be a good word as it rolled through the mouth and stuck to every surface available","mikesgroove","Aug 25, 2011"
4.13,4.3,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"on draught, poured with absolutely no head/foam. Very very thin layer, like a lace of lacing. A cloudy light molasses color, like amber honey. unfiltered? Not picking up a whole lot on the nose. But the taste! Wow! The rye bursts through. Such a great taste, such a great rye profile. There’s a smoothness to this beer that is met with the rye spiciness, and a clean finish. It could go wrong in so many ways but doesn’t. (if it was chewy I don’t think id enjoy it as much. And its not overly sweet either.) great mouthfeel, the rye dominates & it shines. Another beer I wish was bottled or made its way to San Anto. I’ve never tasted such a rye forward beer before. Usually they seem to be blends, like a ryePA.","elNopalero","Aug 22, 2011"
3.53,-10.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall, an interesting beer but it just didn't have as much aroma or flavor as I'd expected. Refreshing but can't say I'd be searching it out. Would like to try again just to make sure I got a good sample of it [resample]","TexIndy","Aug 07, 2011"
4.34,9.6,3,4,5,4,4,"Very mild hop profile; really showcases the rye. Highly drinkable and delicious. I guess you need a real live German to brew a good Roggenbier. It takes a guy who loves pumpernickel! Heh.","rcfunk","Jul 02, 2011"
4.23,6.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"O. Full disclosure - I'm something of a novice with this style so I can only go by what my taste buds are telling me and what I've read about it. The message I'm getting is that I'd like some more of it, and at 4.8% I may well sit on this one all evening. It's a good accompaniment to the hot weather.","omnigrits","Jul 01, 2011"
3.53,-10.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a moderate brown color with a copper hue. Medium off-white head with a bit of retention and some spotty lacing. The nose carries quite a bit of rye, and not nearly as much yeast character as I would prefer. Malt and yeast heavy. The flavor falls along the same lines. A bit of German yeast, but other than that, lots of rye and accompanying light spice. Bready malt in the background. Light to medium body with good carbonation. Pretty drinkable, though not quite as good as the other Live Oak beers that I've had.","Thorpe429","Jun 24, 2011"
3.85,-2.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The flavor of Live Oak's Roggenbier is quite lively, with that signature rye 'spice' coating the entire palate from start to finish. Slightly fruity and floral, with enough bitterness from the hops to balance the rye maltiness. Mouthfeel is chewy and creamy, but strangely thin enough in body to make for an easy sipper...the <5% ABV doesn't hurt, either. Overall, a tasty take on a style that American brewers are just starting to catch on to. Live Oak rarely disappoints with their German interpretations, and the Roggenbier is no exception.","wagenvolks","Jun 22, 2011"
4.83,22,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Overall very refreshing and enjoyable… Light enough to drink a few but complex enough to keep you interested... 'quaffable'. It’s easy to see why LOBC chose this for their summer seasonal and I definitely hope to have it again next summer.","Biermaedchen","Jun 19, 2011"

3.55,-10.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Cracked this bad boy during taiyed's graduation party (congrats on the Master's, Alex!). It pours a cloudy amber-/auburn- tawn topped by a couple fingers of cream foam. The nose comprises wheat, lemon zest, lemon peel, black pepper, and orange peel. The taste holds notes of wheat, grass, light clove, very light black pepper, flowers, dark greens, and more wheat. I don't get all that much rye character here, oddly enough. The body straddles the line between hefty light and light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a lightly grainy feel. Overall, a decent roggen, but lacking in much rye character and nearly boring beyond that. Very easy to drink, though, and in no way objectionable.","TMoney2591","Jun 14, 2011"
4.45,12.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"I love this. There is an excellent bready rye character that is pretty much perfect for the style. I had several pints of this, and could have easily had more. Awesome, and highly recommended.","champ103","Jun 09, 2011"
