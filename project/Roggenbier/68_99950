4.5,16.9,,,,,,"10/23/13 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Just right spices here. It's not quite winter but the warmth in the flavors hit the spot. Hints of caramel, coffee & vanilla combined with the maltiness are spot on. When the temperature starts to slip into the 50's, here is a welcome comfort.","seedyone","Mar 11, 2014"

3.71,-3.6,4,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall (3.75/5): Flying Dog Roggen is a spicy beer that I think pairs really well with food. While a bit one-noted, it is a flavorful, bold beer that seems, at least to me, to punch above its weight in terms of flavor to ABV ratio. I enjoyed it well enough, though two in a row–because of the rye centric flavor–might be a little too difficult to pull off.","hagbergl","0"
