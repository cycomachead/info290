3.81,1.3,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Old-school beer from a completely different world, essentially a staple beverage from Eastern Europe that is brewed with bread, fruit and other flavorings. A low-alcohol beer that is generally no more than 2-percent ABV. Beaver Brewing is perhaps one of the only US breweries that produces this style year-round. An amazing brew for what it is.","BeerAdvocate","Nov 27, 2013"

4.23,12.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"The world of kvass is littered with a whole mess of utterly atrocious (mostly Russian produced) garbage out there. So, frankly, it wouldn't be too hard to show them up. Regardless, this is a really nice production. Bready tones are clearly evident. (surprise!) And there is somewhat of a sweet tone that comes across. Mmm. I just got a nice hit of grain on there. Seems like wheat, which reminds me that this looks like a wit or hefe at first sight. The overall verdict is that this is pretty nice. Seems a bit heavy on my stomach, but I am guessing that is because this is a fresh beer and there is all that bread involved. Hey...I wonder what kind of bread he used for this...","RblWthACoz","Aug 19, 2012"

3.12,-17,3,3.5,3,3,3,"overall I had no idea what to expect here and still not sure I do. it grows on you a bit but still nothing to seek out.","sliverX","Sep 25, 2011"
3.16,-16,4.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"The nose brings forward a bit of light straw malt and bread plus a mild raisin character. Almost a bit wheaty. The flavor takes more of the wheat character and everything is distinctively bready. There's some mild sweetness. The mouthfeel takes the flavor over, as it's oddly dry and bitter. Very strange, as it's not a hop-like bitterness. Not bad, though not something I would return to.","Thorpe429","Jul 18, 2011"
3.68,-2.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. This is my third kvass, and my favorite so far. This kvass was remarkably different than the previous two. It seems that this style has a broad interpretation. A fun and interesting experience. I would definitely have this again.","Huhzubendah","Jul 18, 2011"
3.36,-10.6,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Beer is thin and bright on the palate, easy drinking overall. The lead off is mildly sweet, the midpalate is yeasty and the finish is dry and oddly bitter. There seems to be a disconnect in the Kvas "style". Some go toward the sweet, some go toward the dry. This one falls more on the dry side but that odd bitterness that I interpret at fusel is just a little too off-putting for me to recommend it as a "good" example. I don't think I'd have it again but I think I'm going to take a break from the Kvas style for a while.","drabmuh","Jul 17, 2011"

4.33,15.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This pours a very pale yellow, almost like real lemonade in color. There is very little hop aroma, owning up to its ability to be served to younger children in its origins. The smell matched up to the paleness but offered slight hints of its bread core. It has a citrus finish and a drinkability ranking up with cold lemonade on a summer day. To that point, I may have to try that. Glad I was able to add this to my palate.","mmopt","Jun 07, 2011"
4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer is a winner. Refreshing and low alcohol, this would be a great one to drink all day while doing things out in the sun. Grab this beer if you get a chance.","Hojaminbag","Jun 06, 2011"
3.17,-15.7,3,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Overall I would say this is moreso a fun and interesting beverage than it is a beer. A unique style for sure. Good on a summer day or if you like to expirement with new styles.","kbuzz","May 14, 2011"
2.6,-30.9,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,"O: not a big fan at all, definitely an interesting style of beer, but I must say that I can see why many breweries stay away from this style","homebrew311","May 06, 2011"
2.87,-23.7,4,2,3,3.5,3,"This beer pours an translucent saffron color with a thick frothy head on the surface. The appearance wasn't what made it unappetizing to me. The sulfurous aroma however was absolutely what I would consider the worst aspect of this beer. There was a lot of bread yeast aroma behind the sulfur as well. The taste was rather bland. I would say it tasted like water with bread yeast in it. Like yeast in luke warm water that you are trying to prep to make homemade bread. The mouthfeel is thin but fine. Overall, I don't think I could ever get into this beer. I'm not sure what everyone was tasting with it, but it sure as heck didn't taste all that great to me.","Vdubb86","Apr 29, 2011"
3.75,-0.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"What better way for the Original Kvass Kick to continue chuggin' along than to revisit the roots of the style? None, say I. Allegedly, the boys at Beaver brewed this in the traditional manner, including leaving it out on the windowsill. Nice. It pours a cloudy sallow topped by about a finger or so of stark white foam. Off-hand, I wouldn't think this was even a kvass, given the general darkness of nearly every other example presented to me. The nose comprises soapy chive, rye bread, rosemary, sage, and coriander. What a slightly odd, though mostly pleasant, spice cabinet odor. The taste is pretty mild, with notes of wheat, light onion, light chive, light fennel, and some very light coriander. A pinch of pepper may or may not have been thrown in for good measure. Honestly, given the description of the ingredients and the process, I expected more of a robust flavor SOMEwhere in here, but it's still pretty nice, if overtly inoffensive. The body is a weirdly hefty-feeling light, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda watery feel. Overall, a pretty damn nice traditional kvass, a welcome alternative to the sadder, more soda-like varieties that seem to pop up much more often. We need more of these more old-school types 'round here, dammit!","TMoney2591","Apr 18, 2011"
4.49,19.4,4,5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"The strangest part about this beer is that it tastes nothing like the East End kvass. Not even a little bit. Both are excellently tasty and indeed I don't think I could choose one if forced to. I would need to have them both.","DavoleBomb","Apr 05, 2011"
4.28,13.8,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a hazy straw like color with a tight skim head and a little bit of lace. The aroma is of breadiness and some sweetness. The taste has a nice sourdough breadiness to it, with a hint of sweetness and a bit of grainess. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall very solid, true to the style and a very easy very enjoyable drink.","goblue3509","Apr 03, 2011"

4.23,12.5,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: I did not know what to expect from the brew, but I must say, I enjoyed it a lot. It is very easy to drink. Would enjoy this on a hot humid day. After reading the style notes, I think this is pretty spot on!","IronCitySteve","Apr 02, 2011"
