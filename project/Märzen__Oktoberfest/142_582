Medium-light body, high carbonation. Overall a very drinkable beer, wouldn't take an effort to down these in liters in an octoberfest tent.

Not much of a head, decent lacing.  Light amber in color.  Hops with just a bit of citrus on the nose.  Not real complicated.  Hops on the palate with an ever so slightly astringent finish.  Almost too easy to drink.  I could easily knock back too many of these in one sitting.  Makes me quite affectionate for this time of year.","louisianajones","Sep 16, 2014"

However, it is heavier, and a bit sweeter - not my liking. I made a session out of this brew, trying to study it from all angles, and since it is a marzen, meaning it is brewed between the months of September through April, I was reminded of how its German heritage really gave it a good quality taste but a head that faints quickly after pour. I was astonished to see the words malt liquor on the label of this beer, and was thoroughly disappointed by this description. It is definitely worthier than the Malt Liquors out there, but hey we can't all be skeptics all the time. Would I try this beer again, maybe, if it was free - There are plenty of German brews to be imbibed, and therefore, I will be seeking a better session than Spaten. Overall ok, but nothing to really implore you to try again.","knowledge","May 25, 2014"

Perhaps my expectations were too high. Caveats: this was a green bottle with no bottling date. I would love to be able to try this beer fresh in Germany and then render another review. I just felt the beer lacked what I normally enjoy in this style (a malty, caramel dominance), instead the hops seemed to dominate.","Foyle","Apr 26, 2014"

The taste is of sweet malts, biscuit (yeast) with some spice. Very tasty and goes down easy. A very light dry finish is noted. Overall, really like this one and not a big fan of Oktoberfest brews for the most part but this one is the exception for sure.","BeerWithMike","Apr 13, 2014"

I really like it dispite the fact it was a bit light on carbonation concerning the mouthfeel. Malty taste with a hint of orange I was getting. Descent Oktoberfest beer.","Ryanm1","Nov 04, 2013"

The faste was an obvious malt forward profile with caramel malt and some nutty roastiness as well. There was a slight spicy bitterness on the finish that keeps your attention. While I’ll admit there is nothing over the top spectacular about this lager, it hits my taste buds in all the right spots. It’s easy to drink with enough flavor to distinguish itself from a league of lagers and keeps me looking forward to Oktoberfest every year.","brurevu","Nov 04, 2013"

I honestly didn't care for it a whole lot, disjointed and sloppy, even for an original, in my humble opinion. better in a bottle, but not by a lot.","StonedTrippin","Sep 25, 2013"

3.88,7.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 7/4/2012. Pours lightly cloudy orange copper color with a nice 2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, pear, apple, biscuit, toast, floral, light pepper, and herbal earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt and fruity notes. Taste of caramel, pear, apple, biscuit, toast, floral, light pepper, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, biscuit, toast, floral, light pepper, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Very nice balance of malt and fruity ester flavors; with good complexity and robustness of all flavors; and zero cloying sweetness present on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Oktoberfest style. Very well balanced between malt and fruity flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 03, 2013"

Nose expresses classic German sour-mash lager aromas - nothing too out of the ordinary. Taste follows nose; however, there is also a bit of caramel and a trace of dark fruit intermingled. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a bright carbonation and a slight, residual burn at the back of the throat. All and all, a pretty drinkable Marzen - not my favorite, but it goes down easy and is not at all cloying like some examples of the style I've had the opportunity to try.","Jwale73","Sep 21, 2011"

The taste is a cleaner version of the smell, complete with sweeter caramel, slightly spicier rye, and richer orange. It's not a leap, really, but definitely a step up.

The beers flavor follows that of it’s aroma: the toasted malts and caramel really shine up front, followed by the sweet, honey flavor, some hops and just a tinge of alcohol. The mouthfeel of the beer is rather watery, but it helps to make the beer refreshing and drinkable.

Some grainy notes with caramel malt and other malt profiles. I also get some bread characteristics with a bit of skunk (which can be expected from such an old bottle). Mouthfeel is light and crisp...not the most flavorful beer either. Drinkability is high, as this could be very sessionable on a hot day.

Pours a copper-amber with a huge off-white head that lasts a long time and leaves good lace. The aroma is caramelly malty grain, cooked rice, dry grass, hints of pine and herb. The taste is caramlyl malty grain, strong and full but still light and tingly in feel, with an active palate, clear herbal and nutty bitterness, more bitter than usual for the style and just enough to make it more interesting.","CuriousMonk","Jan 27, 2011"

The head pours full and high, bumpy and craggy, and the carbonation throughout maintains a refreshing zip. Laced like a champ: creamy. Color, an average shade of copper. The aroma is pungently spicy and malt-liquor-like, perhaps bordering on the good side of cheap and offensive. Flavor is much of the same, with the malt backbone and feel being obscured/over-matched by the funky spiciness. Funk is felt strong in the extra-dry finish - sucks the moisture out. Having painted some grim pictures on the "flaws" with this beer, it's certainly not the worst of the lot. With the spice toned down, you got yourself a respectable example of the style.","Bouleboubier","Nov 25, 2010"

2.32,-35.6,4,2,2,3,2.5,"We were excited about the legitimacy of a real Marzen from a real Germany. The look was promising, typical Oktoberfest, light amber and clear. Not much head or carbonation. The residual did not cling to the glass like an ex-girlfriend (BA-ZING!). The basic smell-malty. A woodshop memory also sprang into our minds. However, the inability of the smell to resonate brought the first disappointment of this beer. Upon first taste, I was convinced that there might have been a Munich, Ohio. This Oktoberfest is a very malty beer, and only if you let the flavors linger will you taste a hoppiness. The beer itself was not very carbonated, and did not sit on the palate at all (much like how the smell didn't resonate). Justin was very disappointed due to his travels and beerperiences in Germany. Despite the shortcomings, this beer would not disappoint an experienced Oktoberfest-er. Though it is not a special beer, it is a solid, basic beer, that is not at all bad tasting. It has a light body, and a pleasant smell, albeit fleeting. Taking that into consideration, we rate this beer drinkable. We expected more from a Munich Oktooberfest, as this beer was more of a late August/early September-fest. Much too basic, but a good general idea. A little more editing and this beer could be something amazing. Better luck next time.","AleBlager","Nov 21, 2010"

Not too much stick to the glass, but the lace kind of slide down to the liquid after each time you took a drink. There really wasn't much to the smell, I was a bit disappointed. It had a little bit of a malty/metallic smell, but it was pretty weak. The taste saves it a bit. I found it pretty malty and sweet. Certainly picked up on some caramelized malts. Nothing about the taste was overly strong though, I actually found it quite on the lighter side. The mouthfeel was good, extremely light though. This was one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had, I couldn't believe how fast I drank it. I just remember looking at the glass and it was already just about gone.

Its deep ruddy brown color is pleasing to the eyes, more so when looking at it down the barrel of a huge 32 oz mug. The smell speaks of the experience behind Spaten's brewing, these guys know how to make a friggin' beer. The first sip betrays hints of sassafras and mint that stay with you to the bottom of the glass. It is a little creamier than other oktoberfestbiers, but I like that, it serves to make a rich and foamy head. If you find it on tap, call a friend to drive you home because you're going to want to drink as much of it as your can. Remember in the movie Beerfest when the guys find that secret beer recipe hidden in the doll and they're all talking about how they want to ice skate on it or are simply moved to tears by how delicious it is?

There's no off note that can creep into lighter German imports. There's a touch of apples and grapes detectable, as well. The flavor comes through more strongly vinous with a light but fruity malt. It gets just a bit too sweet in the finish, but I'm sure that I'd lose sight of that quickly if I were drinking it any quantity.

Malty with cocoa powder and maple syrup alongside corn, wheat and flour accents, mild raisin, grape and apricot scents, comes with a vague metallic edge as well. Medium-bodied, for its weight the carbonation gets things a little too fluffy. While it keeps the maple, milk chocolate and general malty sweetness through the attack, it dries up considerably thereafter with cornhusks, grass, unprocessed grains and rye bread albeit without any excess bitterness.

It makes all other Oktoberfests pale in comparison, clearly showing everything else is an imitation. Sweet, malty taste, it really embodies the fall in my mind.

Perhaps a bit unbalanced for the style -more akin to a "lighter" Bock Bier.

No dates on the package that I can find. Open the bottle, ok it's not skunky, that's half the battle. Mouthfeel is very thin, but that's not the end of the world with lagers or this style.

Medium somewhat creamy body with a fair bit of carbonation. I am impressed. My expectations were not high but this is one of the better octoberfestbiers I've had.

Mouthfeel is foamy and substantial, without being heavy in the least. Drinkability? I drank nine liters of it in ONE DAY. It's good enough to warrant sipping and better than most anything available to me at home, but I'm at Oktoberfest and it lets itself be gulped down so easily, so why the hell not.

Also detected is some macroness. I knoe there is no rice or corn present, but it sure does tase like it. It just has that euro macro flavor.

The head of foam had good retention leaving behind white rings and some spotty white lace around the glass. It had a nice above average aroma of toasted malt, juicy fruits, and a wet hops background. I thought the taste was dry with subtle flavors of bitter hops, a touch of juicy fruits, and a small taste of toasted malt in the background. The mouthfeel was kind of light and dry with an aftertaste of very subtle bitter hops. I could see why they drink big liters of this style of beer at Oktoberfest because it's somewhat light, there isn't too much flavor to it and it can be refreshing.

The white head eventually fades leaving nice lacing down the mug. The aroma is very malty with a nice nutty, bready aspect to it. Seems sweet but not overbearingly so. The taste begins witha touch of malty sweetness. The breadiness comes in along with a mild spiciness, which is probably the hops (what little hops there are). It finishes with a mild sweetness that never becomes overbearing. The carbonation level is right on, giving the beer some body. Drinkability is high if you like the style; the flavors are all subdued and inoffensive enough that you could kill a lot of this in a night.

3.68,2.2,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"Thought I would start the season a bit early this year when I saw it on tap at the Sunset Grill. Poured a rich and vibrant brown in color. Very clear and with no head on it at all. Nose was very simple and only mild malts were noticeable, and they were slightly browned at that. Flavor is slight sweet but mellowed but a significant biscuit flavor. Hops are extremely mild and provided just a hint of bitterness around the edges of this beer. Mouthfeel was crisp but heavier than other O'fests I have had in the past. The alcohol is brilliantly hidden and it is a very simple and quite enjoyable beer.","MuddyFeet","Aug 22, 2005"
3.3,-8.3,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"This one is not as light in color as the other German Oktos we tried, and it comes a lot closer to what we accept as the style.

Forms a 1/2" head that lasts throughout and laced well quite. Smells cleanly of malt, yeast and mild noble hops. Tastes quite malty, bready, and a little like lightly fruity. A bit earthy and grainy from the flavors and into the body and then the finish. Otherwise clean finish with light drying. Sweet alcohol flavors play on the toung and palate. An easy drinking beer. A classic, paired with brats and sauerkraut.","BEERchitect","Jul 31, 2005"

Flavors give off a very german malty flavor that is sorta nutty but more toasted and caramel like. There is a decent sweetness to this brew throughout with a slighty snappy hop finish.

Pours a nice light tan color with a well proportioned fizzy white head. Smell is not too good though. There's a skunkiness in it, an off yeast byproduct scent. Taste is on the dry side to me. There's a toasted caramel flavor but it has more of a bready, yeasty base that is the main flavor. Finish is slightly weak. Maybe the yeast was old or something along that line because there was something not completely right in this beer. I had two and noticed the same in both, if it's different to me in the future I might change it. Still, not a terrible beer, just could be much better.","granger10","Nov 28, 2004"

As the beer warmed a bit, the finsh was smoother,sweeter. Mouthfeel was middle of the road- pleasant carbonation up front. I gave it more for drinkabiliy as I reached the end.

The smell is very weak, but smells somewhat of honey and pumpernickel bread, with a tiny hint of malt. The taste of this beer is again of honey and bread, with a hint of plum. A little too sweet for my taste.. Lacks the hoppyness that creates the bitterness that I enjoy. Mouthfeel is smooth and a wee bit creamy, but this beer does not have enough carbonation for my taste, or the spicyness that a lot of other Oktoberfests boast.

The head retains itself somewhat and does cling to the glass in sparse patterns of lace. The first time I purchased this it was really fresh tasting and smelling, this time the green bottle yielded before the devilish UV rays and created that gross skunky aroma, however it does fade a bit the longer it is out of the bottle. The nose is caramelly sweet and biscuity malts, subtle yet inviting. I find this beer quite pleasant tasting. Smooth and sweet, same caramel and biscuit aspects I detected in the aroma balanced out by a delicate European hop. The mouthfeel is perfect, goes down clean but theres something that gives it a soft velvety body. Nice and quenching, I say this ones a winner and is perfect for the season.","FormatKid","Oct 29, 2004"

The aroma features a clean, almost nutty maltiness along with a slightly sickly-sweet worty aroma in the back - almost fruity, but not an estery fruitiness, more a grapish type aroma. The flavor starts with sweet malt followed by a more robust toastiness and a tea-like flavor, then follows with a clean bitterness at the end - frankly more bitterness than I expected and maybe a little too much.

The primary taste was very smoothly sweet and bready malt with a refreshing lemony acidity, mild clove spiciness, and a low level of hop bitterness. I could also detect some notes of bananas and orange peel in the taste. The mouthfeel was creamy and full but displayed a dry aftertaste.

There are good Oktoberfest and other seasonal type beers out there, this is not one of them.","beertaster13","Feb 20, 2004"

The aroma is malty and skunked (green bottle issue?). Medium-bodied with a yin and yang of sweetness and skunkiness throughout, this ended up being a drain pour. The malt and caramel flavors simply could not compete with the unpleasant skunkiness. The finish kept with the theme. I will have to try to seek a fresher bottle out for a re-taste.","Dogbrick","Feb 09, 2004"

Pretty strong carbonation makes the beer feel light on the tongue. What little flavor there is lies in the aftertaste. Best I can do is a smidgen of malt and a hint of bitterness.

Taste has a nice mellow toasted maltyness thats lightly sweet and bready, pretty easy and calm flavors, nothing overwhelming, notes of light nuttyness comes through in the finish with a favorable light drying. Sure its a bit plain, but nice enough to keep it interesting. Feel is medium bodied, pretty smooth the whole way through, easy little bitterness and a light drying finish.

A very smooth, easy drinking beer. Perfect carbonation. Sure, a GLBC Eliot Ness it is not, but still I dunno what it is about it.... I like it, and that's all that matters.

The head was very wimpy and since the waiter came back with the beer very quickly, I don't think it was just because of natural dissipation. This was a much maltier beer than the Warsteiner Oktoberfest I had just prior to this, but this also had less hops.

Some hop spiciness in the aroma and a little sourdough bread malt, but not much. As for the flavors... where's the malt? (Read that using the old lady's voice from that 70's Wendy's commercial). Lots of carbonation and some spicy hops, but not much of that nice O-fest malt. There is some there, but it seems to struggle to keep up with the rest.

When, oh when, will the scourge of green and clear bottles be banished from all breweries?!? The brew pours a light brownish amber with a scant off-white head. The skunkiness ruins the aroma and attempts to block out some sweet malt. Luckily, the skunk is not quite so pervasive in the taste, just a nuisance in the background marring the otherwise pleasant light caramel maltiness. This brew seems more one dimensional than the other big name import O-fests, Paulaner and Hacker-Pschorr, which have a bready and nutty quality to the malt along with the caramel. Too bad, this one would be an adequate session beer if it was not skunked.","johnrobe","Oct 06, 2003"

On the palate it is outright voluptuous, with broad, creamy, egg bread crust topped with baked apples texture punctuated with abundant fine gas. There is a moment of hesitation on the finish when an iron grip of tannic, dusty, brushed steel-flavored bitterness completely overwhelms this beer's considerable flesh. It literally dries up and fuses parts of my mouth together. Eventually the flavors evacuate, leaving a ringing, high-pitched hop bitterness that is not flawed, yet might be better if/when it integrates with the fruit.

Pours a light or medium copper colour, not excessive carbonation or head itslelf. and the smell, clearly perceivable, gives off much of its maltyness and slightly some hops. The taste follows up after, a sweet malty combination at a 'just right' point with the bitterness of the hops which provides for a bittersweet flavour that is very attractive. Rather more exotic than other Oktoberfest beers. nice buy.","Andreji","Jul 20, 2003"

The malt and hop balance was just right. I have a carboy full of Oktoberfest in my lagering freezer and I would be thrilled if it tasted close to this.

3.07,-14.7,4,2,3.5,2.5,3.5,"This O-Fest looks impeccable, coppery-brown, clear & shiny.  The thick, white head had adequate retention and fair lace (so far so good).  The nose is unremarkable.  It took a great effort to notice the malt and spice.  The aromas of O-Fests are critical to the overall enjoyment of them and, frankly, this one lacks.  The flavors on the palate are standard and enjoyable (malty, spice, and some hops).  The more I quaffed it, the more a nutty flavor emerged.  The mouthfeel was thin and not all that satisfying.  While this beer does nothing to distinguish itself from a fine crop of O-Fests it does have enough good qualities to drink it again.  Would I recommend it?  Depends, there are far better versions.  Give it a shot if youd like.","bditty187","Nov 01, 2002"

Nice amber color with little head.  The aroma was sweet malt, with very faint hops.  The flavor was a sweet, fruity malt that kept me going back for more.

Anyway, the beer poured OK, dark golden with a white lace head, but that was about all that was decent.  Smelled of old cabbage.  Tasted like old cabbage.  I could sense some nice malty flavor underneath- but it was really hard to keep the bad qualities at bay.  I couldn't finish it, which left me reaching for a Brooklyn Octoberfest, which was far superior","AaronRed","Oct 20, 2002"

The flavor is what I think an Octoberfest should taste like.  This was the third I tried this year, and it was by far the best.  It had a fun taste that showed hops but it wasn't overpowering.  There was an aftertaste of nuts.  Drinkable and enjoyable.","doho95fu","Oct 14, 2002"

The aroma is of rich, toasty Munich malt (possibly Vienna?) with a very light hop note. The body is medium with a moderate carbonation level and a lightly creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is of a very nice, round maltiness that is somewhat bready and lightly toasty with a soft, light fruitiness and a well balanced bitterness.

Medium in body.  Slightly sweet in flavor w/ toasty malt flavors.  The decoction mashing produced complex and almost fruity (prune - like?) melanoidins that are highly enjoyable.  Hops are minimal in presence, but do balance the sweetness sufficiently and prevent it from becoming cloying.  finishes a bit sweet w/ a biscuity malt flavor on the tongue.
