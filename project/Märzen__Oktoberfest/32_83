3.1,-8.6,,,,,,"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and I thought this was a average at best example of a Oktoberfest, it was going in the right direction, but when it came to the taste and aroma there were a few off aspects that held this beer back from being on par with the style.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, a little clean, crisp, not filling at all, but the taste didn't the best job at holding my attention and I think one is enough for me, any more than that and I know I would start to get bored with it and the off aspects would start to wear on me.  What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel and appearance, there were both nice and they seemed to be the aspects that were the truest to style.  What I liked the least about this beer were the off flavors and aromas, this beer would be much better if it didn't have those stale grain, skunky and apple cider like aspects to it.  I wouldn't buy this beer again, I'm glad I gave it a chance, but it's pretty easy to find a much better traditional example of the style and I can't say I would recommend, but it might be wroth a try if your already a Becks Fan.  All in all I wasn't impressed with this beer, I could only looks past some many off aspects till it started to wear on me and I realized that I'm just not into this beer.  I've only had the regular becks and I liked it just about as much as I liked this beer so I can say how it ranks for this brewery, but it's for sure not one of the better Marzens I've had.  I appreciate the effort, but this one could use a little cleaning up, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Aug 27, 2014"

This beer smells sweet with caramel notes, toffee, wheat bread. I don't really care for the feel on this one. There is a great amount of bubbles rising through this one, that really gives this a spritzy feel. I think this detracts from enjoying the flavors quite a bit. The flavor profile is pretty average to the style: sweet caramel, mild bitterness, metallic ting on the back end. This beer had some some things I liked about it, but overall nothing really worked together. With so many better options available to me at this time of year, I don't see myself reaching for this one again.","Onenote81","Oct 15, 2012"

The nose comprises buttery biscuits slathered in buttery toffee. Nothing more, nothing less. The taste doesn't change much, but it does toast the biscuits pretty thoroughly and adds a touch of mandarin orange flesh for good measure. Well, it was a nice thought, anyway...

I did get a quick whiff of skunk when I first opened the bottle. Taste is of malt, caramel, and some herbal flavors on the finish. There is a surprisingly strong hop bitterness on each sip that lingers on the palate. A nice carbonation level with a crisp and clean mouthfeel.

Aroma is average, mostly sweet malts, bit of caramel in the taste. As an Oktoberfest, it is heavier on the malt side, not very bitter at all, it's quite tasty but nothing special. I would definitely choose this over Beck's lager, as it is more flavorful and although you can taste that it is a macro brew it is still decently drinkable and inoffensive to my palate, lacking harsh or astringent adjunct or "skunk" taste. A good German macro beer, probably not as tasty as a fresher American-brewed version but still a good intro to the style.","Sudsy89","Mar 10, 2011"

Aroma is full of nice grainy malts, a little caramel, some toast, and what smells like adjunct corn. Flavor is not terrible but falls a little flat and weak, grainy, a little caramel, faint toast, metalic off malt notes, more of the corny hints and some planty hops. Finish has a toast quality a good helping of metal and some bitter hops. The body is pretty thin and well carbonated.","CuriousMonk","Jan 27, 2011"
4.07,20.1,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Deep amber, quite clear. A big, fluffy, white head that diminished rather quickly and left some streaks of lace. Caramel is most prominent in the aroma, followed by a touch of very light biscuit and almost a toffee like tone. Flavors are mild, yet balanced and articulated. Definite caramelized malt going on. Light on the bitterness. In fact, it's only there in the background to balance out the caramel. Soft finish that accentuates the sweetness. Well carbonated, maybe even a touch over what I want, as it gives my palate a hearty prickle. But not overdone at all. This is a well made, classic example of the style. A great anytime beer.","DmanGTR","Jan 11, 2011"
4.35,28.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Beck's Oktoberfest pours a dark amber color with a weak scent of spices and heavier scent of malts.

A look just like you'd like - deep, dark auburn body and a big, healthy off-white head that expands effortlessly from the pour, however, doesn't cling too well to the glass. Once again, a simple, straight-forward, uber-clean, thick malt aroma, where hops nor yeast influence what is a textbook Oktoberfestbier smell. Drinks clean and smooth with a moderate malt backbone that features a fairly musky, not spicy, tone to it. The balance of sweet and dry is stellar as well. In other words, the taste is not too sweet and the finish is only slightly dry. A pleasure to drink.","Bouleboubier","Nov 27, 2010"

There's a big roasted caramel and toffee taste up front, but then the character fades to a watery basic bready pilsner taste. While it's a bit odd for an opening flavor, it's decent, I'll admit, but then fades to a bland lager with a bitter herbal finish.

The beer looks fabulous, dark copper with a mushy white head that leaves a decent lacing. The taste... jesus, skunk ruined this beer. There is some decent caramel sweetness and some bready malt, but it's completely overshadowed by nasty skunkiness and what I think is some weak corn flavor. Palate is actually very good, fuzzy carbonation with a bit of a bitter aftertaste and a grainy, sticky texture. Overall though, this was a waste of time, I'm frustrated that I didn't pick up the Hofbrau instead.

The smell is a nutty, chemically, lousy malt smell, and the taste is worse. There is a slight chestnut or almond malt taste to this beer, but it isn't particularly good. This is a pretty bad beer, and I don't know which is worse, the fact that this is German and should be better, or that anyone would actually pay money for this stuff given the 100s of great local beers out there, not to mention imports. If you want bad beer, drink a Budweiser on the cheap, why pay imported prices for something so poor. The mouthfeel is a little bit creamy, mostly watery, and largely inoffensive.

The malt character is a bit more toasty, but the grain qualities deter from the overall taste. The hop flavor is ligher than the scent is in the aroma, but does offset the sweetness, barely. Low on esters or any common sulfers. The beer feels light on the creaminess, allowing the grain husk astringency to come through more and more as the beer warms.

The initial taste is quite malty, mainly sweet with some hints of toasted grains giving it a slightly spicy edge not as much bready like the aroma. The hop bitterness is moderate, providing a good balance; the beer is not overly sweet, which I usually do not care for. I also enjoyed a detectable hop flavor and this was appreciated. The beer is delivered on a moderate carbonation, with a medium body giving it very good drinkability for an Oktoberfest. Overall I enjoyed this Oktoberfest.

Also, unlike many Oktoberfest styles that are very malty right up front, this one has a very nice balance, with a gentle hops bite in both the nose and the taste buds. There is a subtle sweetness and a very slight carmel taste, but an extremely favorable (if subtle) bitterness or tartness in the aftertaste that leaves the taste buds begging for more.

It has a dry finish and goes down smooth. The beer is easy to drink, and I wouldn't be opposed to buying a sixer of this next time I see it. It is definitley a great beer to drink in the fall.

A lighet shade of amber with a 1/2" head of fuzzy white foam. Aromas of munich malts and slightly floral German hops. Balanced nicely. The taste is balanced and sweet with the malts and the hops working together nicely to serve as a refreshing beverage. Mouthfeel is a bit light for an o-fest, and drinkability is good.

To be honest not what I would have thought for this type of beer. I even sent it back saying that it was not what I ordered and it must have been Bud, but I watched her pour and it was. The aroma was rather weak, some malt and spices and some citrus hops, but all real faint. The flavors were not much more then the aromas, some malts, alitttle crisp but not much as far as depth for this style of beer. From beginning to end average at best and weak for the style.

The smell was less caramel like than I would have expected and had a pronounced hop nose; an off characteristic for this beer style. The taste was very bitter with an earthy tone to it. THere was little malt character to this beverage and was carried on the back of the hop additions. The mouthfeel for such a robust beer proved to be on the light side for this Oktoberfest.

The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This would be better with a little more body and a little less carbonation.

It's medium body is creamy and smooth in the mouth with a very fine and moderate carbonation that lends just enough bite to get things started. Spicy and grassy hops start the flavor with some zest before the malts start to warm, and carry all the way through to the finish.

The mouthfeel is of a medium weight (if that makes any sense, that's the only way I know how to describe it.) Seems to me to have a smooth but almost heavy finish.

I overheard one of the local Germans comment on the beer. He basically said that you can't expect a northern German Brewery to make a great Oktoberfest. Perhaps he's right. Still, this may be the best of the Becks beers. It is easy to drink and really not that bad . Thin mouthfeel and decent drinkabilty round out the beer.","Redrover","Sep 06, 2003"

Lots of caramel, butter and nut extracts rise up ...conspicuously absent is any trace of aromatic hops. On the palate it is rich with powdery, bittering hop crispness that keeps the flavors in focus. Sauteed banana and apple survive briefly before the peppery hop resins and chunky gas arrive to clean it all up. Authentic.","putnam","Aug 29, 2003"

Poured a clear amber with a 1/4 inch head that retreated in seconds. Aroma consisted of sweet caramel, malt and hops. The qualities of the taste and smell of this Oktoberfest are vaguely similar to that of an original Becks. The finish was skunky and rather bitter. I was looking forward to this one, but it was a letdown. I would probably try to seek this out on tap to see if it was any better tasting than what was offered in the bottle.","Winter","Nov 17, 2002"

Thick full head, amber-orange color and clear.  Light to medium malt flavor with hard water quality.  Has a refreshing quench to it as well.  Shorter than average finish, for style, with some dryness.  Mouthfeel is medium and doesn't have any softness.  Not a bad Oktoberfest.  I do prefer this to the other Beck offerings.","garymuchow","Nov 15, 2002"

It has a sweet caramel aroma once poured into a glass (being from clear bottles, I was afraid it would be a bit skunky, but fortunately, that was not the case).  The flavor was not that impressivesimilar to regular Becks but with more of a roasted malt and nutty flavor.  There are definitely better Oktoberfests to be had.","Morris729","Nov 10, 2002"

Light-medium body, and a smooth mouthfeel. Taste was of bready maltiness with hints of carmel, ending with a bit of hops to balance. Very easy to drink, especially compared to regular Beck's, which is a fight for me to swallow. A bit thin but better than expected.","Lupe","Oct 27, 2002"

The taste is a little lacking.  It has some malt, but just not exciting and malty like most oktoberfests.  The finish leaves a bitter aftertaste.  Overall, this is not a very drinkable beer.

3.11,-8.3,4,3,3,2.5,3.5,"Beck's presents a mild mannered, drinkable Oktoberfest.  The color is probably the most unique characteristic of this lager...the subtle but rather sensual tint of this beverage is a beautiful copper.  The initial scent was a bit skunky accompanied with a light citrus note.  Overall, it is a light-medium bodied beer that finishes a bit weak on the palate.  Drinkable, yes.  The best, no.","Zraly","Oct 12, 2002"

It looked just fine, but c’mon, its just bad.  It had the underlying taste of beck’s, bad and skunked, with a very limited level of O-fest malts thrown in the mix.  Worst O-fest ever.","jackndan","Oct 06, 2002"

Lacks much of a hop counterpoint, could use more.  Lighter bodied.  Pretty OK Fest and drinkable entry from the king of German exports.","ADR","Sep 25, 2002"
2.36,-30.4,3,2,2,3,3,"Not a Beck's fan to begin with, although this is probably their best beer. They brilliantly decided to use clear bottles this year (with a faint green tinge) but are selling them in enclosed 12 packs. Skunky aroma which fortunately vacated when dumped into mug. Some good head & coloration but a bit too artificially fizzy to be truly handsome. Very cold, this beer had some good caramel sweetness in the attack but everything else is a wash. As the beer warmed to the appropriate temperature, the bad flavors became more obvious. Too much regular Beck's flavor, which I find disgusting. Also an offensive metallic aftertaste, much the same effect as sucking on a quarter that you picked up off the street. Will have to recruit some friends to finish this 12 pack for me. Should have known what to expect from Beck's.","Thrasher","Sep 24, 2002"
3.28,-3.2,3.5,3,3,3.5,4,"Everything about Becks Oktoberfest seemed a tad too subdued.  Aside from the great looking coppery-cinnamon color and the off-white head, nothing jumped out and said wow!  The nose was of faint malt, spice, and caramel.  The taste matched up with the aroma (add in a little floral too). I think I could smell and taste a faint note of skunk. It got a little sweet at the end.  But overall this is a very drinkable beer and by no means is there anything wrong with it.  Ill gladly drink another.","bditty187","Sep 22, 2002"

Taste is great, a bold maltiness followed by a flowery fresh hoppiness and some light roasted malt tones. The finish is wonderfully balanced between the malt sweetness and the bitterness of the hops. A great example of a well-made German O-Fest...everything is turned up to 10 on this one.","beerluvr","Sep 22, 2002"

Taste stays pretty solid all the way through, a malty, toasty foundation with some lighter hop profile floating on the surface that makes for an excellently balanced brew and a surprisingly nice Ofest.  The brew is a little thin for the style but that is about the only detraction of this very drinkable bier.","Murph","Sep 14, 2002"

The aroma had a slight skunk along with some caramel maltiness and hop notes.  The taste is not malty enough for the style and the body is too thin.
