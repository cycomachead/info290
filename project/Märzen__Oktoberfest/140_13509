Also, this: "Everyone loves a great party, and there are few quite as famous as Germany's Oktoberfest. Inspired by that rollicking celebration, we bring you our variation on that classic festival beer. Oktoberfest is medium-bodied and rich with malt flavor, but maintains a crisp finish marked by floral hops."","feloniousmonk","Mar 25, 2015"

Crazy drinkable, this is the perfect Octoberfest for when the weather hasn't gotten to cold yet.  Perfect beer for the type of weather when you're in the back yard in jeans and a tshirt and think to yourself, "I might need to put on a sweatshirt pretty soon" type weather.

4.1,8.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 7/1/2014. Pours slightly hazy deep copper color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, nuttiness, light roast, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of and complexity of dark/bready malt and earthy/spicy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, nuttiness, light roast, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, nuttiness, light roast, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice robustness and complexity of dark/bready malt and earthy/spicy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean on flavors as well. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Oktoberfest style! All around great complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt and earthy/spicy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 26, 2014"

This is very enjoyable and better than some American Oktoberfests that have been made for many years.  The malt flavor is very complex and develops interestingly.  Theres a hop bitterness but it balances very well and is most evident in the balanced finish.  Theres a good toasted flavor that doesn't get too strong and turn into flavors of a brown ale or porter.  Good job SNBC.","Tuck_leepulin","0"

A bit thin in the nose with only a touch of fresh caramel malts coming through perhaps followed by some aromatic hops.  After a sip the malt comes out and is highlighted by some of the darker caramels and roasted barley.  Floral hoppiness is there, perhaps more than is normal for the style and there is a little less sweetness than you would find in many of the other popular O-fest beers.  The body is medium and the finish is just a touch dry with the hops leaving some bitterness behind.  Overall I'm quite pleased by this, while I find that it is a little less sweet and smooth than some other Octoberfest beers it is an interesting variation and typical of Sierra Nevada.","fank2788","Sep 21, 2014"

3.66,-3.2,,,,,,"-Bottle- Yeah, it's still 90 out but it's Oktoberfest time in my gullet. Pours pretty like all other Sierra Nevada brews. Clean, clear, dark amber. Thick tan head that subsides to a thin ring. Lots of lace. Aroma is mild. Smells very festy. Caramel, yeast, toast. A light hiccup of hops. Flavor is of toffee and caramel and toast. More bitter than many of the style. Medium bodied with peppy carbonation. A pretty good Oktoberfest. I should probably wait until it gets a bit cooler to drink the rest of these.","VelvetExtract","Sep 05, 2014"

This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, fairly clean, a little crisp, slightly creamy, not too filling and the taste did a very nice job at holding my attention, I could drink more than a few of these especially around the Bonfire on a cool fall evening.  What I liked the most about this beer was the taste and mouthfeel, I thought they were both very nice and they were the highlights of this beer to me.  What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I would change and there's nothing that I disliked about this beer.  I would buy this beer again and I would for sure get a six pack of this during the fall if Sierra Nevada ever decided to release this on it's own and while it works good in this fall variety pack I think it could hold up to being released on it own.  I would recommend this to just about anyone especially if your a Oktoberfest fan.  All in all I was a little impressed with this beer, I was expecting this beer to be nice, but I didn't think it would be as flavorful as it was and that toffee aspect was really a nice touch.  It isn't my favorite beer from Sierra Nevada, but I have to say I think it's one of the better American example of an Oktoberfest that I have had so far.  Great job guys, this was really nice beer and I enjoyed drinking it, keep up the hard work.","StoutHunter","Aug 25, 2014"

Got this in the fall pack, which is a great variety pack overall, but this is probably the standout (though the Vienna lager was a nice surprise...and the Tumbler's in there too). Pours a deep reddish amber, leaves a collar after a fleeting head, and appears fairly inactive until you drink it. Super malt, caramel and toast aromas, with some cherry and spice. This has some big malt to it and a molasses flavor, barely any bitterness, just earthy and malty. I really like this beer, and I think SN really made it their own. Will get again. Very soon. Hope they do it in sixers in years to come.","BeerWizard","Aug 17, 2014"

The smell is malt-dominant as expected from the style, but this one is far from being one-sided. Caramel and light bread are accompanied by a pleasant citrus and herbal hops presence. The taste is a nice balance of malt sweetness and hop bitterness, with the hops dominating the palate only late on the finish. Some nice flavors in there, caramel, nuts, orange and some kind of herbal flavors. It has a medium boy, dry texture, and lively carbonation. This beer was much more hoppy than I expected, but once I got used to it I really enjoyed it.

3.84,1.6,5,3.5,4,3,4,"Kinda like their brown ale, it's not really great for the style, but it's a nice beer unto itself. Fits the bill for either a malty or a hoppy brew. Even handed in it's boldness. A nice little change of pace for the season, as I tire quickly of oktoberfest-style beers these days.","UnionMade","Oct 20, 2004"

3.71,-1.9,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"The beer came off the tap a ruby amber color, with a finger of head that had a little staying power. The nose was dominated by caramel sweetness, maybe a little brown sugar in there as well. The taste was not really what I expect in the style. It was very sweet and caramel, not much of the spicey flavor I expect in an O-fest. The mouthfeel was moderately thick, with a carbonation that balanced well. Drinkability was good as well. I enjoyed my pint, but would go for many other O-fest beers over this one. Try it if you find it.","kmpitz2","Sep 15, 2004"
4.18,10.6,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"On tap poured into a sample glass. It pours a deep cola color with one finger of slightly tan head. There is good lacing left on the glass. The smell is malty, with some caramel sweetness coming through. The taste is also sweet and malty. Lots of caramel and toffee. A little bit of hops on the finish. Great balance. The mouthfeel is good, and the drinkability is fantastic. Another nice Sierra Nevada draft treat.","SheepNutz","Aug 17, 2004"
3.42,-9.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Appearance: Dark ruby body with a caramel toned creamy tan head leaves specks of lacing behind. Aroma: Mild caramel and nut tones from the toasted malts slight hop profile a bit edgier than the usual O-fest. Taste: A sugary caramelly tone with a nutty edge and herbal hops, not horrible but left much to be desired. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied pretty smooth drinking easy going carbonation. Drinkability: Decent Oktoberfest style that I was excited to see considering not many Sierra Nevada seasonals make it out to the Burgh.","WVbeergeek","Oct 25, 2003"

3.1,-18,3,3,3,3,3.5,"Color aside, this is very much an easy drinking oktoberfest. Nice sweet malty flavor with some bitterness at the backend.","jcalabre","Beers"
3.43,-9.3,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"I'm not a big fan of the O'fest style but had to give Sierra Nevada's offering a try, given the time of year. It's a decent attempt at the style but I'll stick with their pale ale, porter, and stout.","Boilermaker88","0"
