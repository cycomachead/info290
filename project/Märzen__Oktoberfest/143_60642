3.01,-9.3,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,3.25,"Look is pleasantly...well...Octoberish. Fairly clear. Enjoyed in a stein with octagonal bottom. Head retention wasn't great, but it laced well. On the nose, it's little different than a Miller High Life, for example. As beer-smelling as beer can get. Sweet tasting, but as it lingers, more bread-like. Slightly bitter and bready aftertaste. Gently warms mouth long after swallowed. Moderately carbonated, not too thin, quite refreshing. I'm not generally a huge fan of Märzens or Bocks, but I can make exceptions.","Libeertarian","Mar 10, 2015"

This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was smooth, a little clean, crisp, not filling, but the taste didn't do a good job at holding my attention and one is enough for me, any more than that and I think the off aspects would really start to wear on me.  What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance to me that was the aspect that was the truest to style.  What I liked the least about this beer was the taste, it just had some off aspects that hurt it and made it not too enjoyable.  I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's not hard to find better American made Oktoberfest and I can't say I would recommend it for the same reason.  All in all this beer just wasn't for me, that metallic flavor was a pretty big deal breaker for me.  It's now one of my least favorite American made Marzens and it's also now my least favorite beer from Shiner.  Better luck next time guys, this one needs some work.","StoutHunter","Sep 03, 2014"

Aromas of big pear, apple, caramel, apricot, toast, bread, light pepper, and light herbal. Nice and pleasant aromas with solid strength and balance. Taste of caramel, pear, apple, toast, biscuit, toffee, light nuttiness, and light earthy herbal spiciness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, and earthy herbal on the finish for a bit. Some pretty nice flavor balance and robustness; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a good Oktoberfest style. Very solid flavor balance and robustness; and very smooth to drink. I enjoyed this quite a bit.","superspak","Dec 08, 2012"

It's pretty mellow compared to most American interpretations of the style, but it's really nice. The mouthfeel is light and velvety, and the drinkability is good.

Popping the top, I get a dry hoppy smell with a hint of metallic clove. Pours to a light bronze color with a pillowy, clingy and robust tan colored head. The taste is consistent with the smell, sweet up front with a slightly bitter metallic bitterness that lingers to a fading bitter finish. Mouthfeel has a moment where it is watery in the middle but overall it is a non-factor. Head has excellent staying power. I usually steer away from Oktoberfests due to being overly sweet, but Spoetzel has put enough bitter hopping in this beer to make it tasty. I would drink again.","mooseisloose","Nov 16, 2012"

A trace amount of skunkiness may be present as well, but not obnoxiously so. Flavor is noticeably milder than the aroma, and the aroma wasn't especially bold to begin with. I would assume I'm tasting some caramel malt and mild hops, but it's so vague that it would be hard to surmise without having seen and smelled it before drinking. A decent amount of lacing clings to the glass as the beer recedes, which is respectable. Carbonation lends a creamy mouthfeel and would be just right if only there were a bit more substance to offset it. As is, it feels slightly too thin and watery. This beer might really have something going for it if only it had more flavor and body. Without, it remains a safe, sessionable beer with naught to write home about.","MaximalC","Nov 06, 2012"

This is a tribute to the brewmaster. He or she nailed it. This is, at heart, a restrained beer. But at heart, this is a restrained style.

It pours a clear amber-straw topped by a finger of cream-white foam. The nose comprises red apple skin, light grapefruit, light mandarin orange, greens, and toffee. The taste holds notes of mixed greens, light caramel, very light mandarin orange syrup, grass, and flowers. The body is a rather light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a fairly slick feel. Overall, a kinda sad O-Fest, one that shuns malt in favor of fruitiness and whatnot.

It's very bready with a hint of caramel maltiness, but doesn't begin to explore the darker notes that are the reasons I seek out Oktoberfests in the first place.

At first it seems as if it's much too light bodied and watery to be considered an Oktoberest, but then the toasted malts come into play and the beer ends up actually having a pretty nice finish. It may be a bit of a boring brew, but it's so unoffensive and goes down so easy that it's hard to down right loathe it.

The taste is the only area of the beer I really have any grip, it is over sweet and not enough balance to all the big malt flavor.

Aroma is all malt, with a hint of toasted malt. No hop aroma. Complex malt flavors, again with a toasty character. No hop flavor. Medium bodied. Finishes dry. Has more hop bite than I would expect for this style. I'm impressed that this beer came from Shiner.

Not much in the aroma department, just a faint whiff of sweet malt. Taste was not anything to get excited about either, more of the same faint maltiness with a touch of mild hop bitterness. A drinkable beer for sure, but their are much better Oktoberfests out there. The label describes it as a Marzen style ale. Mmmm, I thought Marzens were lagers. Go figure.","clemtig76","Oct 18, 2005"

The sweetness factor is a little high for the style, but doesn't cloy. Noble hop flavor is present, but mainly serves as a balance. The finish is a little weak. After my first couple of sips, I didn't really find this to be a very good beer, but by the time my mug warmed up, the flavors had really opened up.
