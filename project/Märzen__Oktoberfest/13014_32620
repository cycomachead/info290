Nonetheless, it is close in some intriguing ways, and it delivers on the rye, which is always appreciated.  In the right mood and on the right day, I find this beer to be awesome.  Other days, its an oddball, but one I appreciate.  This year like every year, its gone too soon.","Taybeh","Oct 22, 2014"

Nose features biscuity malt up front with that trademark marzen character that I can only describe as the smell of fall or freshly raked wet leaves.   The nose also has a noteable hop presence which I'm not used to for the style, but I must say that it is welcome.  The taste is malt forward with notes of biscuit, honey, and bread.  This is followed up by slight herbal hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel is light with appropriate carbonation.  Overall, one of the more enjoyable oktoberfest beers that I have had.","homebrew311","Oct 07, 2014"

5,23.8,5,5,5,5,5,"Surly's take on the Octoberfest brew.  Sometimes a brewery produces an Octoberfest just because... However, Surly rarely does anything "just because."  Surly Fest is made with the same gusto as Abrasive, Furious, Darkness, and pretty much every other brew they make.  Fest tastes like no other Octoberfest out there.  It is unmistakeably hoppy, yet not too much so it takes away from what it is.  I'd hate to call it an IPA-esque Octoberfest, but that's a fairly accurate description.  Very attractive red-bronze color and a fairly thick head, agreeable aroma, and a smooth mouthfeel with a pleasant hint of carbonation.  Of the dozens of Octoberfests I've had, this one is by far the best.  If you have a chance to get it, do so.  Your taste buds will appreciate it.","BeerSnobRobinson","Sep 21, 2014"

I do wonder what yeast strain they used because it comes across very well in this beer, and the rye addition with restrained American hops (don't know which one, also curious about this) create a very drinkable and tasty beer.

Aroma is a combination of sweet bubble gum, citrus, caramel malts and spicy rye. Taste is milder with the citrus and fruit working off of the caramel and spiced rye bread perfectly. A little lingering hop bitterness. Mouth feel is full and coating for a lager. This is a really interesting beer. It's really delicious and kind of perfect for the colder weather.","davey101","Sep 24, 2013"

4.01,-0.7,3.75,4,4,4.25,4,"apparently surly makes only interesting and top quality brews. I love this one. its like a Oktoberfest, but is spiked with rye malt, and has a unique vanilla character im not used to in the style. the pour is more bronze than orange, mostly clear, with an inch or so of lasting white head. the nose is german malty, but with that familiar peppery rye kick and a finish of fresh vanilla beans cut open and scraped clean. yum! the flavor is a little less dramatic on the vanilla, and its more toward the front than the finish, but its still there. the malt balances out into a nice german traditional marzen style. this has characteristics of both an ale and a lager, its crispness is remarkable for its complexity, and its super sessionable. strong carbonation lightens up a fuller medium body, and the 6% abv is just right for me in thus style. overall a very strong offering from surly, I really love the vanilla twist here.","StonedTrippin","Mar 16, 2013"

A mostly clear, darker amber pour, with a small, foamy, white head that sank to a collar and left a few streaks of lacing on the glass. Aroma was sweet with malts, bready, toasty, herbal hops. The taste reflected the scent, sweet malts, bready, toasty rye--not too distinctive, but still apparent--light herbal hops. Crisp, clean mouthfeel, medium body, maybe light-medium, quite drinkable overall. A nice and unexpected treat.","Rifugium","Mar 01, 2013"

It essentially smells like your average marzen with a little something extra. The flavor is where this beer really shines, it has that great caramel malt flavor of a marzen but adds in some awesome spicy rye and a bit of hops. It's incredibly full-flavored but has a nice clean finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with some heavy carbonation. This is a pretty great beer and one of my favorite lagers ever made. I wish it wasn't just a seasonal, as this would be a fantastic beer to drink year-round.","starrdogg","Nov 21, 2012"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, spices, bread, fruit, and subtle bitter hops. The flavor was of sweet malt, spices, bread, subtle fruit, and bitter hops. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall was a pretty good brew. All of the components you would expect from this style were there with the spiciness, but it also threw in a Marzen twist to keep you guessing on top of that.

Excellent clarity. No lace. (3) S: Hops up front, nice earthy and herbal hops. Then some sweetness from the munich style malt additions. To be honest the hops dominate and while I like the nose, it’s far from an appropriate marzen. (3.5) T: Sweet bready and slightly oxidized malts come together in a true oktoberfest profile. Again, the hops are strong and belie the tradition of marzens. Nice beer, not a good marzen (3.5) M: Thin with hi carb, semi dry finish and some nice lasting aromatics.

It pours a light bodied and creamy light hazelnut brown in color, very translucent, with a creamy beige head that laces my snifter. It looks like a creamy marzen. The aromas are very hoppy, featuring the traditional Surly hop profile, despite being dry hopped I get more fresh wet hops from the nose with light German malt and an interesting yeast strain. The flavors are a near perfect mix of fresh hops and malt. The rye is subtle and it does drink like a light lager. The hop presence is really nice. It is VERY complex period, and especially for the style. Like most of their beers, this one was built for a can and has a perfect mouthfeel. It is overly sessionable and really surprised me. The complexity is unheard of for the style. I'd say this is a must try, and a nice upgrade over traditional "festbier" that you'll find this time of year.","aasher","Oct 23, 2011"

4,-1,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall this is one of the top 5 lagers I have ever had by far. The malt profile is so complex with the spicy rye and the toasted breadiness but the the ample hop profile and dry hopping also plays a huge part in making this a great beer. Once again Surly knows how to make a great beer; really drinkable, balanced and sessionable during this fall season but could be consumed year round although you would want it fresh to appreciate the fresh dry hop aromas and flavors. Highly recommended and should be on every beer geeks "bucket list" in my opinion; glad I was able to check it off.","claspada","Oct 19, 2011"
4.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"O - *Very* happy to try this at last. Another fantastic brew from Surly. Not enough lagers in the craft brew world, so it's always nice to come across a fabulous example. Cheers to Todd and Omar,","SummitVA","Beers"

3.6,-10.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Overall - Solid beer, if a bit unconventional for an Oktoberfest style. I think this would fly better as a marzen with a rye kick rather than a rye beer on a marzen base.","Alieniloquium","Oct 14, 2011"
4.18,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Overall a well done o-fest/rye beer...however you want to classify it. I'd say it leans a little more toward marzen as the rye is not as prevalent as in say, a Red's Rye or Cane & Ebel but definitely noticeable. Gives this lager a nice complexity to it, along with the the nice hoppiness it has. Will definitely seek this beer out again and would honestly probably buy a case of it if I lived in Minnesota.","cetherid","Oct 13, 2011"

Lacing does not last long on the inside of the glass. Very nice smell. Mellow, citrusy, and richness. I tasted the single hop, Sterling, evenly throughout with rich maltiness that has a bite to it (the rye).

Taste has an initial impression of malt/grain, light sweetness and spicy rye characteristics, which are swept away with a light washing of citric hop that leaves only a trace of malt/grain for mostly clean, dryish, slightly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy and very nicely carbonated for the style, imparting a creamy yet crisp backbone. Overall, a nice hopped-up twist on the Oktoberfest style.","JackieTH","Sep 14, 2011"

The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish. Overall, a nice brew, though I think the rye goes somewhat overlooked/underused.

There is a malt backer in the aroma along with some sourness from the rye itself. The taste is a slightly bitter sour rye flavor along with some spice that would be associated with it as well. It isn't overwhelming in those regards, there is also flavors of some nice earthy hops. I'm never really a fan of any bitterness, but this beer isn't bad at all.

Mouthfeel was medium with a light sweetness on the tongue accompanied by a grassiness. in the mouth. Dang, I wish that they had not mentioned pretzels because I could really go for one right about now.

This is difficult to rate against any given style, a dry-hopped rye helles lager. The beer is copper colored and a little hazy, with a thick rocky 3-finger foam that recedes into a thin wet frothy film. The first smell that hits me is rye spice, followed by bready and malty "helles lager" aromas straight outta Munchen. Exceptional, and the taste is even better if only because helles lagers seem stronger in flavor than aroma (at least to me). Delicious biscuit, malty sweet, with distinctive rye bite and a sharp after-taste that lingers. The body is creamy and filling, this is as drinkable as any beer I've had before.

Color is a hazy dark orange, with a half finger of white head. Aroma has some dry grainy husks, bit of caramel sweetness, traces of fruit here and there, slightly musty as well. Taste brings on more of the same, but more subdued overall. Taste also clues you in that this is a Lager and not an Ale in the way that all of its conponents intermingle. Good carbonation, and a pleasant hoppy bitterness lend itself well to the drinkability of this beer. At the same time, one is good enough for me. A good beer from Surly, and much more refined than their other brews. Again, like all of their other products, I wish I had access to them here.

Smells like a well balanced, slightly bready beer with a note of hops but not too overwhelming. I was expecting a Terrapin Rye Pale type taste and that may have clouded my judgement here. It did resemble Terrapin in the rye factor but the hops are a little more laid down which is totally fine. I was just expecting more of a sharpness to it. Not a bad beer in any sense.

I was thinking I might not really "get" the rye in this beer (having had precious few rye beers), but it's there in abundance. Really spicy kick, peppery, and nicely balanced with the sweet malt flavor. Medium-bodied, some faint, yet long-lasting lingering bitter flavors.

Aroma has some citrus hops and bready malt, neither too strong, with the hops dominating. Initially, the flavors had me scratching my head for sometime because I thought I was drinking an Americanized Oktoberfest so I was relieved to see the heading here as a rye beer. I tasted restrained citrus hop flavor with the bready malt but the malt flavors danced on my tounge for only a moment and was whisked away in a fairly dry finish, which is explained by the rye malt and normally tends to be a palate cleanser when added to beer leaving a pretty dry finish. Mouthfeel was right in the middle making this beer very drinkable. This is unlike any beer I've tried before because it does remind you of Oktoberfest but you've got interesting twists with the American hops and rye malt. Oh, and of course it's absolutely delicious.","beerkittycat","Oct 02, 2008"

Full body with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very refreshing beer but also very filling which mean I wouldn't have that much in a session.

Mouthfeel is nice, very smooth with a creamy carbonation that matches the head seen when poured. When very cold the feel is light and dry with some bite that moderates by the end of the glass. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and found it very drinkable, especially being a rye lager, this is probably due to the IPAish character that it seemed to have.

Smell is hoppy, yet apples and sweet malt as well. Amazing for a style I usually find pretty average. Taste is nice, and mildish aside from a decent dose of grassy hopping and a nice bitterness level. Easy on the malt, and not a sweet or tart oktoberfest like I'm used to but more mildly sharp and zesty, perhaps from the Crystal Rye. A touch on the thin side palatewise, although the carbonation is spot on. A great, unique oktoberfest although I would actually like a hint more sweetness here.

Smells quite hoppy for an Oktoberfest with amarillo hops taking a commanding presence, as well as some honey, lemon, and caramel. Taste is also way different than I would expect, with rye jumping right out at you followed by some honey sweetness and a touch of lemon citrusiness. A nice sweet toffee backbone with a big ole piney hop finish. Medium in body, smooth and creamy with a dry finish.

Wow, what a perfect blend of hops and malt on the tongue. Sweet grapefruit hops balance with a creamy caramel malt. The crisp rye gives a fresh zing in the mouth. A spicy pepper sting finds it's way in the mouth as well. Aftertaste is an interesting combination of toasted nut and pine hops, niiice. Fluffy light to medium body with a full carbonation. This doesn't exactly fit into the "traditional" fest beers, but that's why I like it. Definitely a nice change of pace during the Oktoberfest season, especially for hop lovers.

Its hard to tell if I'm picking up a metallic smell or if it is the rye grains that I am not used to, either way it doesn't distract from the overall sensation. The taste has a great complexity.

Flash of caramel and spicy (rye?) cookie dough with cooked veggie undertones. Herbal, noble, resinous hop bitterness comes on strong in the finish and lasts a delicious while.

4,-1,4,4,4,4,4,"The grassy hop character seems to grow a bit as the beer warms up a bit, coupled with a sort of pine / menthol note (but not in the typical American hop way), this becomes the dominant, though not quite defining, characteristic of this brew. If you hadn't guessed this really is quite hoppy, definitely a hop dominated brew; sort of like a cross between an IPA and a malty Oktoberfest. Quite tasty, a really enjoyable brew and I am glad they did not brew another typical Oktoberfest (while I do enjoy a well crafted traditional one, truly great ones are few and far between). Perhaps my only complaint is that the hops get in the way of really noticing the rye character.","Gueuzedude","Dec 19, 2007"

4,-1,4,4,4,4,4,"This is a much more hopped up version of this style which was quite enjoyable considering most of of the time you get the same old thing from an Oktoberfest. Non-traditional but recommended to those who like hop flavor...","bennetj17","Nov 13, 2007"
4.43,9.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Drinkability- Im not sure how to say it but this is about as drinkable as they come. Its so crisp and clean and goes down so easy. The alcohol isnt staggering high so it would make a great session brew for those long Oktoberfest nights. Thanks again to mnstorm99 for the opportunity!","younger35","Nov 11, 2007"
4.12,2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"D-I know there are mixed opinions on this beer. I am rating it as a beer and not an ofest. As a beer it is outstanding. Its the kind of beer I wouldn't mind packing my fridge with and reaching for every day. I love the hop flavor of this and the spicy maltiness complements it perfectly....I like Furious and that has its place too but I feel this is a better beer overall. I'm extremely impressed.","ZAP","Nov 05, 2007"

4.17,3.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"My favorite Surly offering? No. But this is yet another very solid beer from the guys in Brooklyn Center. I love the incorporation of rye and could care less what style this is supposed to fit into. Well worth seeking a couple cans out.","WeisGuy","Nov 02, 2007"

4.43,9.7,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Pours a very nice dark copper color with a finely grained head. It may look like a typical Oktoberfest, but it's anything but. The nose clean and hoppy with plenty of citrus, but with a nice malty body in the background to balance the hops. This beer is exceptionally drinkable and downright delicious; And the mouthfeel is pure velvet. Awesome!","CBorg","Oct 20, 2007"

4.72,16.8,4,4.5,5,4,5,"D: Very tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style while taking the style to the next level. This is definitely one of those beers that I could drink several of throughout a whole evening and not have the urge to drink anything else. I know that the fact that I like this beer more than any other O-fest I’ve had simply because of the hoppiness means I’m a Hophead, but I’m calling like I taste it. This is an excellent beer.","TheManiacalOne","Oct 14, 2007"
4.52,11.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"The mouthfeel is pretty good, light carbonation, medium body. The drinkability is high on this one. I can't get enough of it. It's too bad all my local stores are out of it, I was hoping to snag at least another pack. The flavors are in great balance and everything about the beer screams "drink me."","dogger6253","Oct 14, 2007"

4.34,7.4,4,5,4,4,4.5,"What to say. Just like the others of the Surly line I've sampled an overall solid, impeccably drinkable beer that satisfies. Not immensly complex but it is a lager after all. Thick with caramel and toasty cereal grain. The allspice I thought was in the nose is no longer prevelant. Creamy with complimentary carbonation. Good hop flavor and bitterness. And again nice and spicey with a nougat type finish yet dry. Maybe this is more complex than I notice. All I can say is another top notch beer from a top notch brewery.","mcallister","Oct 04, 2007"
3.92,-3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"D: This is a very interesting and unique take on an Oktoberfest, and one I would certainly love to come back to if they sold it in MA. You could easily throw down a few of these in a session. Nicely done Surly.","YonderWanderer","Oct 04, 2007"

4.72,16.8,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Poured into a Stuttgarter Hofbrau stein as per the instructions on the can. This brew pours a clear copper color. The head is massive, firm, and recedes slowly into thick lacing. The aroma is explosive. Spice rye, and noble hops, a hint of green apple and pear, with a soft biscuity undertone. The taste is more malty than the aroma. Biscuits appear then quicky fade as a hint of caramel comes through, then that fades and a nice lively spiciness shines, then some firm bitterness arrives in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with perfect carbonation, and a creamy texture. Overall, this is one of my favorite Surly beers. It seems to walk the line between being an extreme beer and being a tradintional beer. Whatever it was intended to be it is wonderful.","KarlHungus","Sep 23, 2007"
4.62,14.4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a deep burned orange with 2 fingers of soapy white head that dies slowly. I know this is a marzen but I know its a Surly marzen which makes alll the difference. Smells of piney hops, citrus, rye and malty. Ooooh yeah. Tastes of juicy, piney hops, malty balance and delicious rye. This is the brilliant nectar named Furious but tamed down with more flavors. If I could make a perfect octoberfest beer to suit my hophead tastes, it would be almost as good as this. Medium in the mouth with the perfect tickle of carbonation. Drinkability? If I had a case of this I would drink non stop and end up in a hospital and it would be so worth it.","franksnbeans","Sep 22, 2007"
4,-1,4,4,4,4,4,"I had this once last year on tap, this year's version seems to have much more rye flavor than last year's, which I seem to recall as more grassy and pilsner-like. This is still a good beer and it's great to have another Surly in cans.","Mdog","Beers"

4.32,6.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This beer kicks butt. A nice copper/amber hue with a small off white head and minimal lacing. The smell definitely shows its dry hopping, it smells like rye, barley malt, piney green hops, spices, unidentified citrus, and earth. The taste really showcases the hops, with all sorts of great flavors ricocheting around my mouth. Salty pretzel flavors, rye bread, barley malt, bracing hops, herbs and spices. Very nice. Mouthfeel is full and good, and the drinkability is downright sessionable.","sacrelicio","Sep 12, 2007"

4.21,4.2,4.5,3.5,4.5,3,5,"Dark orange color with a quickly dissolving head, but decent lacing throughout. I didn't get much from the aroma in the way of hops and a mild malt smell. Taste was very good nice and grainy without being too sweet, good balance of piney hops on this one. felt a little weak in the mouth, not much texture. I could drink this beer all night long, great flavor, and very sessionable.","mnstorm99","Oct 31, 2006"
4.72,16.8,4,4.5,5,4,5,"Now, normally I'm not a huge fan of fest beer, but this... the malts are sweet, lovely, hop hit bang... ya, really, like all other Surly beer, it defies description, and is just... simply... fantastic. The mouth is smooth and crisp, if not a little too lean perhaps... an utterly fantastic beer to drink.","objectivemonkey","Oct 13, 2006"
4.72,16.8,4,4.5,5,4,5,"This beer was so easy to drink. I really feel like this is the best lager beer I have ever tried. I like a good pils, I like the high end doppelbocks, there are some good marzens out there, but this was hands down my favorite lager.","dfried","Oct 09, 2006"
4.05,0.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,"This pours an opaque dark amber color, whith a thick white head and ample lacing on the glass. The smell is of hops. The taste has a rich maltiness typical of Octoberfests. What makes this different than any Octoberfest I have ever tasted before is the huge hop flavor, both citrussy and piney-I believe they dry hopped it. While it stretches(and I think exceeds)the boundaries of the Octoberfest style, one cannot deny that this is a very tasty beer. It is(like all Surly beers)rich and full bodied. This is a fine beer. I just wish they would call it something other than an Octoberfest.","edbeered","Sep 27, 2006"

4.83,19.6,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"The unassuming and standard looking body do not harbinger the different but fantastic beer that is SurlyFest. The smell gives it away at first. Mangos, pineapple, strawberry, passionfruit. All very malty but rich and fruity as well. The taste backs this up. A rich malty beer with many fruit notes, also carmel malts, with a better-than-average-for-the-style hop finish. I think Surly could've stuck with what may be assumed is the Surly formula (hops up the wazoo), but this beer is so much more, it is delicious, unique, and should be tried by all. A standout Oktoberfest.","TastyTaste","Beers"
4.32,6.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This might be my favorite Octoberfest, mostly because Surly's effort is not to style which is fine by me. Starts with nice creamy tan head, thin, but might have been the bartender's pour more than the beer. Copper colored beer with gold highlights. Strong citrus aroma, hop and malt strong. Very aromatic, almost like a fresh hop. Not sure what it is, but smell like American hops. The hop character is strong on top of a lot of caramel taste in the malt. Very fun to drink and will make a point of getting another before it runs out.","FightingEntropy","0"
