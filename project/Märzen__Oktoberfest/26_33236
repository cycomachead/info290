Cracked a bottle open tonight and the beer pours a very nice clear amber (I left a heal in the bottle to avoid sediment). The head is thin and white and is leaving some lace. The scent is fairly faint....there are subtle bittering hops and slight burnt malt. The taste is a well balanced Marzen style and probably one of my favorites of this style. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall an excellent offering.","WoodBrew","Nov 11, 2013"

3.94,4.2,3,4,4,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into pint glass; no bottle dating, but it is from the 2012 release. Pours very hazy orange copper color with a fairly dense 2 finger off white head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers for a bit. Minimal lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of pear, apple, grape, caramel, brown bread, toasted grain, brown sugar, light pepper, floral, slight nuttiness, and herbal earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and strength of fruity and malty notes with light hops. Taste of pear, apple, grape, caramel, brown bread, brown sugar, toasted grain, light pepper, floral, light nuttiness, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, caramel, brown bread, brown sugar, toasted grain, floral, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of fruity and malty flavors; solid complexity with good robustness; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Oktoberfest style. Nice balance and robustness of fruity and malty flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 10, 2013"

Bubbles constantly migrate from the bottom of the glass. Mouthfeel is slick and wet, with very little carbonation. So little, that I wonder if this bottle is old. Not much going on on the nose. The obligatory toffee, but on the very light side. Some notes of dark red fruit. Flavor is pretty lacking. Not bad, just not 3F.

The flavor follows suit mostly but has a somewhat higher citrus peel accent and a touch of nuttiness on the finish with a bit of earthy hopping. It's serviceable, but there are more exciting marzens out there on the market than this. Surprising mostly for how 'normal' this beer plays out for a brewery with the slogan of "it's not normal."

I expected a lot more from 3F, although both of the lager beers I've had from them were the only real two 3F beers I was quite unimpressed with.

4.14,9.5,3,4,4.5,4,4,"O -- Other than the pretty wimpy head-retention, this is a pretty good take on the style. It's interesting that the noble hops are utilized in a way that gives them up-front prominence in such a balanced beer -- most traditional Oktos' hop character is back of the malt. The dryness could become fatiguing to some palates, but I think the bready malts save the day. A respectable offering of the style.","steveh","Oct 04, 2011"

4.07,7.7,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"I read on the label once that this was brewed according to the Reinheitsgebot and then did a double-take as I struggled with the thought of the Floyds brewing something so ordinary-sounding and historically "pure" (for lack of a better word). Figured I'd have to try it out. It pours a lightly hazy bronze-straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises grass, cracked wheat, buttery biscuits,, light nutmeg, honey, light caramel, and a few scraps of grapefruit rind. The taste primarily follows the grainy path made from the elements above, but with a nice twinge of orange and grapefruit zests. The honey and caramel also pop in at various points, so as to ensure that everything isn't all grassy malt and whatnot. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and an appropriately grainy feel. Overall, a very nice O-Fest-like brew, nicely balanced and surprisingly refreshing. Right on.","TMoney2591","Sep 18, 2011"

Pours a deep orange/amber color, light haze to it, with a foamy white head that quickly disspates. Aroma has a very sweet profile as a whole with a good amount of grainy malt nose, very strong noble hops profile with a combination of sweet grassy and spicy notes and finishes with a light soured malt note. Flavor starts off with a strong hay and light toasted malt note early (cereal) with noble hops grassy finish. Body is very light, which I suspect, is from the low carbonation present in the brew. Texture is kinda watery. Overall, a big disappointment as the nose is unimpressive and the texture of the brew really doesn't help the lackluster flavor. There are better Oktoberfest brews out there.","CuriousMonk","Jan 26, 2011"

The beer pours a slightly cloudy orangish amber color with fleeting coarse bubbles. Everything but the cloudiness is typical to the style. The smell has the hints of malts and orange zest that is typical to the style, but I detect hints of banana and clove which I must say is unexpected for the style. The wheat aroma is also confusing, particularly why it is there. The taste comes on with an unreal smoothness but quickly punches you in the face with it's bitter undercurrents. The bitterness almost seems to come from a roasted malt flavor rather than the expected bitterness from hops. The mouthfeel takes some getting used to, smooth and bitter is a not often seen combo.

The smell isn't anything too special. It's definitely malty and has a light coffee, spicy aroma to it. The taste definitely makes up for the lack of aromas. It's a little sweet and definitely has that fall-time flavor. It's a little spicy and appealingly so. It makes me wish it were autumn already. The mouthfeel is light and smooth. The age on the bottle definitely killed the carbonation but gave it the mouthfeel similar to an aged DFH 750ml. This beer may now be one of my top three Oktoberfests.

3.93,4,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Three Floyds is proud of the 'it's not normal' nature of their beer (as they should be). For this German-style offering, they've amended their tagline to read 'es ist nicht normal'. Munsterfest is probably the most normal thing they brew, but it's still a damn fine example of the style and shows that these guys aren't just hop fanatics. What this beer has shown me is that 3F can be successful at whatever they set their minds to.","BuckeyeNation","Jan 23, 2007"

3.5,-7.4,3,3,4,3,3.5,"Finally gave in and grabbed a Munsterfest off the shelf of the liquor store in town. The beer poured out of the 22 oz. bottle to a hazy orangish brown in my mug. Decent carbonation, but little head retention. Sweet earthy malt smell. Nothing that over powers though. Taste is the same with a bit of bitter hops in there. The hop bite starts and the sweet malt finishes as I swallow, which I enjoyed. Feels a bit thick and chewy, not over bearing in those regards. I put this on the same drinkability as Sam Adams Octoberfest. I could polish of a few bombers if I so desired.","crayphish","Jan 17, 2007"
3.3,-12.7,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"A very simple American oktoberfest. A bit more of a hop bitterness than normal, but overall a very nice simple drinkable marzen.","taez555","Dec 24, 2006"
3.55,-6.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured from a 22oz bomber. Poured a dark amber with a short fluffy white head that disappears very quickly. Smells of lager yeast, honey, and apricots as well as light malt. The taste is a little dissappointing. It is more reminiscent of an imperial pilsner or craft malt liquor than it is an Oktoberfest. Its very malty, very little hops in the front, fairly sweet in the middle as well as some apricot. The mouthfeel is nice and full and creamy, and very smooth. Very restrained carbonation. Not a bad beer, just a little bit odd interpretation of the style.","Georgiabeer","Dec 22, 2006"
4,5.8,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a minimal layer of beige bubbles over the cloudy dark amber brew. Head is down to a swirly film quickly, with average to good lacing. Aroma is lightly of nutty malt and fruitiness. Taste follows along with a nutty grain husk flavor upfront, and hopping to balance for the rest of the experience, with maybe a touch of fruitiness. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both very nice, and even if they say it's "not normal", I'd be happy with this as my fest beverage...","ppoitras","Dec 17, 2006"
3.65,-3.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Clear orange/reddish amber, but still fairly light, topped by an off-white head of fine bubbles. Some spotty lace. Sweet malt aroma with grassy and floral notes. Mild bitterness with some caramel, mild toastiness and light floral hops. Moderate carbonation, medium/light body, quite smooth with some dryness in the finish. Quite easy drinking. Thanks for sharing Viggo!","DrJay","Dec 17, 2006"

3.82,1.1,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Easy to drink as all Three Floyds beers are. This doesn't really taste like an Oktoberfest but it does taste good. Flavor-wise this would be a real good schwartzbier but it isn't dark enough. Tasty but not to style.","Zorro","Dec 02, 2006"
3.8,0.5,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours a clear orange, big off white head forms, settles down to a thin layer, some lace spots, decent retention. Smell is sweet and malty, some citrus, bread and yeast, bit of funk, smells okay. Taste is sweet and malty, yeast, orange/citrus, little bit of sourness and some zest, bit of jasmine, weak finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, very smooth. Never thought I'd see an Oktoberfest from 3F. Not bad, not up to their quality, but a decent brew.","Viggo","Beers"

4.1,8.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"D: This is a very drinkable Oktoberfest. Not my favorite style but I could see myself drinking a lot of this. All the flavors meld very well. It's malty without being too sweet and there's just enough hops to keep the malt in line. If only FFF would do a dry-hopped version of this!","GbVDave","Nov 16, 2006"
3.76,-0.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Pors that simple yet clear grainy amber that is spot on with the real deal oktoberfest beers. Thick yet snappy head that leaves a small foam throughout the whole mug of beer (22oz). Smell of some syrupy straight up malty sweetness. Authentic. The taste is like sweeter pretzel bread fresh from the oven. Leaves a little aftertaste. Goiod on the drinkability for its clear sweetness, but tastes a little like runny syrup.","scruffwhor","Nov 14, 2006"
4.33,14.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D- This beer has good malt depth with a very nice balance of malt and hops. I think this is the first Oktoberfest beer that I could drink by the liter and not get tired of drinking. Of course, I have never been to O-fest in German. With the soft malt and hops I will have to find this on cask and I think it must be consumed fresh.","rhoadsrage","Nov 13, 2006"
3.9,3.2,4,4,3.5,4,4.5,"Interesting new brew. Pours a clear copper red/brown with a big off-white head. Excellent lacing. Nose is mildly hoppy with a good bit of spiciness comign through. Nice. Taste is mild sweet grains and lingering sweet hops. Not a real strong flavor, but well done. Mouthfeel is above average, and drinkability is high.","shivtim","Nov 13, 2006"
3.9,3.2,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"22 oz bomber. The beer is a golden orange color with a very small and patchy head. Clarity is poor and there is a moderate carbonation apparent. The aroma of the brew is mildly doughy, with a sugary caramel sweetness. A little bland to my nose. The flavor is very bready, with a peppery noble hop spiceyness, with a mild caramel sweetness. As it warms a little, there are some more toasty notes along with a mild graineyness as well. That definately makes it start to work more for me. It finishes with a mild but pleasant bitterness. The flavor is also a little distant as well. Mouthfeel is moderate with a light to moderate carbonation. It sits nicely on my palate. This one is nice and easy drinking. I think that this one is definitely better as it comes towards cool in temperature. The grainy and toasty notes seem to come to life after it warms. This is a nice brew. Definitely a drinkable one.","kmpitz2","Nov 11, 2006"

3.88,2.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Saw this on the "new bottles" menu at the Map Room and i got it despite the price because i'd never seen it before (later i saw it at Sam's too). poured red with a bit of brown and translucent...massive white head. crisp, lightly malty and all-spice odor. some sour apples on the nose too. taste is very smooth, nicely hoppy. some slight apple and cinnamon tastes, small amount of hops. It's a very nice lager...not really an octoberfest but i always keep in mind that "it's not normal". High marks for this guy overall...reminds me a bit of Brooklyn Lager with less hops, which is weird because it's not at all the same style. highly drinkable and very refreshing. way to go map room.","aforbes10","Oct 18, 2002"
