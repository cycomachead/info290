A great storytelling around the fire pit beer and a nice crisp refresher on a crisp night (I imagine - nights are still hot here). Not a whole lot wrong to say about this beer, other than it finishes a little more piney-bitter than I'd like. It's definitely captured the essence of harvest and brings in that seasonal flavor! Would I buy it again? For a special event. I'm convinced there are some smoother pumpkin beers out there, so I'm still looking for "that one". Don't think I'd personally grab a sixer unless I was having company.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Aug 22, 2014"

Taste follows the nose at whatever temp profile it happens to be at... tempered with a faint earthen hop finish.

Pours a bright caramel amber hue with a large bright white head forms fine speckled lacing down the sides of my glass. Aroma brings out some nice caramel and bready biscuit malt tones a bit of spicy hops but not much. Flavor brings on sweet caramel notes very bright sugary tones without enough hop balance, but it's a drinkable tasty offering just lacks the deliver or finesse of the great German style brewers out there. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied but sugars can become a bit cloying in number with this version of an Oktoberfest, something that should never become an issue with this style. Drinkability was still alright but not a by the case type of beer it was worth a try and I can appreciate it but give me a Paulaner, Hacker Pschorr or Penn version by the case.","WVbeergeek","Dec 27, 2009"

As far as Oktoberfests go the bar gets a lot lower than this.

Perfect bready-toasty malt balancing wonderfully with noble hop flavor and bitterness. What I love about this O-fest is that it's medium mouthfeel finishes very crisp and a bit dry which makes it extremely thirst quenching. It's so good I find myself pounding back a few wtih ease. This is my favorite O-fest of all time even over the German examples because of it's freshness.

Poured a dark amber colour with a dense white head. Aroma was mild and biscuity. The flavour leens toward the malt. This beer had a biscuit malt character with a touch of caramel flavour and a smooth balancing bitterness. Aroma and flavour hops were very subdued. Probably due to the fact that it was served from a cask. Although it is not a very hoppy beer otherwise. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy.

Slightly metallic, but this has always been a hallmark of August Schell  some of us like to put it down to the old copper brew kettle : ) Bright copper in color, and rather clear, but not fully brilliant. Biscuity malt from the outset, with small, round notes of pale malt and a slight metallic tang taking up the rear. Low bitterness. Moderately carbonated . . .this may speak to the somewhat thin feeling I get (see below). Malt profile lingers here, with some of the fruity-pineapple notes becoming apparent. Not a strong or big offering at all, but theres a pleasant hint of alcohol here. Definitely malt-driven, but in no way sweet let alone cloying, this is caramel malt with a fine gloss on a bright sunny day . . . very much a highlight to this beer. There are a couple of other regional brewers that brew an Oktoberfest that I really love, and each of these brews tends to have a fuller mouthfeel: here its crisp, light and refreshing but never feels heavy.

The aroma of the beer is high malty sweetness aroma with some toastiness also evident and even a little hop aroma. The beer has an initial rush of malty sweetness with a solid backbone of moderate bitterness; even a moderate-low hop flavor is evident. The beer has moderate carbonation and a medium body, leading to a rather smooth swallow and good drinkability. Overall, I really enjoyed this one. The color struck me first and I really appreciate the hop bitterness providing a solid balance to all the malt going on. In fact the hop bitterness is on the high end of the style (at least as perceived be me), something I see becoming a trend with me and how much I like any given Oktoberfest.

3.83,6.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"I got this one on tap and found is to be enjoyable a little mediocre but good non the less. It poured a tan hazy color with some small lacing. It was very malts and sweet in fact almost to malty however there were hints of some nice hoppy flavor. I would defiantly give this one another shot since I usually enjoy most beers from schells.","ryantupy","Dec 30, 2004"
3.33,-7.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Drinkability: Nothing wowed me here. Not bad though, definitely drinkable, highly sessionable. I just think there are far better octoberfests out there.","ski271","Dec 04, 2004"
3.6,0,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Medium-copper with bronze edges. Thick, creamy, light-sand head. Smells of sweet, sugary fruits and toasted toffee malt, amidst a spicy, vegetal hop backing. Starts off with mildly sweet candied vegetables and a caramelly biscuit backbone. Spicy, bitter hops come in and take over into the finish. Finish stays bitter with a pronounced vegetal flavor. Medium-bodied, slightly over-carbonated, bubbly feel. Sticky finish. Not bad.","alexgash","Nov 01, 2004"
3.45,-4.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Schell Octoberfest is passable, but not much more than that. It seems to be missing something, but I can't quite figure out what. This is one case where my local (Millstream Oktoberfest) is clearly the superior beer.","BuckeyeNation","Oct 31, 2004"
2.74,-23.9,4,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Pours an amber color with a small head that dies off fast. The aroma is pretty skunky. Lager stank. Also some caramel malts in there, but there was way too much funk. Might have a spoiled bottle. The flavor was a bit thin and uninteresting. Some caramel malts and a grainy/straw flavor. Didn't like it much. Reminds me of dirt, not that I know what dirt tastes like, but still. I didn't care much for this one.","clvand0","Oct 14, 2004"
2.81,-21.9,4,3,2.5,2.5,3,"This one pours a nice golden amber color with a finger of head that falls to ring the beer. The nose is caramel, deep caramel with a lager funk. The flavor is kind of dirty tasting, probably from a hop that I don't like. Ther caramel is subdued and the lager funk is huge. The feel is thinish. Drinkability is not really good. I don't really like this beer. The nasties stay with me after tasting the beer. Not a good one.","kmpitz2","Oct 07, 2004"
3.25,-9.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,"A rather good Oktoberfest brew. Much better than Sam Adams or other brewers attempts at a seasonal brew for the fall months. Medium colour of copper and gold, a mix of the two. Flavors of straw, hops, barley, and a touch a sweetness. This is a recommended beer for those who are looking for something a bit heavier than most beers, but not to the extent of a Guinness or Dark Beer.","Frozensoul327","Sep 26, 2004"

4.22,17.2,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"This brew has a clear copper colored body, big bubbly tan head as a result of my aggresive pour. The scent is a sweet, clean malt scent. Touch of flower hops. The taste is very sweet, very grainy, crisp and clean. Hints of flower hops give this beer the finishing touches. The way this brew is blended is very appealing to me, and this may be one of my favorite american style oktobers.","Tballz420","0"
3.83,6.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Hazy deep orange-copper color, nice tan foamy head. Has a light bready, malty caramel aromas, sweet, nutty, caramel and butterscotch flavors, medium body, nice rounded and soft mouthfeel, finishes sweet. This one surprised me, a pretty good oktoberfest here.","maxpower","Dec 28, 2003"
3.58,-0.6,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4.5,"This was an impulse buy. Something new in the liquor store. It is a great session beer (sitting and drinking all day) hence my 4.5 on drinkability. The mouthfeel is light crisp and would be a great beer to drink on those hot Indian Summer days. The taste is only little above average, you can get this taste from many other lagers.","ctrlfreak","Dec 11, 2003"
4.13,14.7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Medium body, good caramel malt taste, very smooth, good carbonation...medium dry hop finish but not real bitter. Works great, perfect balance.","jwilli7122","Oct 30, 2003"
3.9,8.3,4,4,3.5,4,4.5,"It's a very light color for an Octoberfest. Sort of a light copper color. Nice thick head on top. Smells of a good amount of hops. Tastes a little muted. A little malt and sweetness, with a nice hops finish. Tastes slick and full on the way down. Another solid offering from Schell's.","TastyTaste","Oct 23, 2003"
4.02,11.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Its clear, deep copper body is capped by a short head of creamy off-white foam that dissipates into a wide collar and cottony surface covering but leaves only spotty lace. The nose exhibits rich, clean, grainy, toasty, and lightly sweet malt. The body is medium and it's crisp in the mouth before warming to become slightly creamy. All that the nose suggests is carried through in the flavor along with a subtle fruitiness and a firm bitterness that leads into a dry finish. Perfectly balanced with just the right amount of malt to give it a nice sweetness that never becomes cloying. Very well done. Quite enjoyable!","NeroFiddled","Sep 26, 2003"

3.8,5.6,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Aroma is great once it warms up some with a nice little toastyness playing over a subdued malty sweetness, some dried wood and ripened dull fruity notes. Taste is very subdued, lightly sweet and partially toasty malts with some very light factions of herbal hops, finishing crisp and clean with a small bite and lingering creamy sweetness that lightfully sticks around awhile. Feel is a bit on the lighter side, quite close to medium, smooth and moderately creamy, and very drinkable; a decent O'fest but could use more toastyness in the flavor dept in my book.","tavernjef","Feb 18, 2003"

4.05,12.5,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Poured a cloudy orange/amber with a thick, foamy head. The taste of slight hops and sweet malts are present throughout, with somewhat of a cinammon feel left on the palate. This is a very drinkable beer, a great O-fest brew, drinkable on nearly any setting.","GeoffRizzo","Sep 16, 2002"
3.78,5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"pours out a clear, dark copper colour; a fine light and tight tan head appears and leaves bits of lace. the first aroma to hit the nose is the flowery, earthy hops...followed by a hints of toasted maltiness. a medium mouthfeel brings some more biscuity and toasted malts to the palate, followed by an above average hop prescence for an o-fest. the finish is pretty dry, and some light hoppiness lingers on the tongue in the aftertaste. this is a fine, tasty and easy drinking o-fest. a very solid beer for the fall season in the northland. worth seeking out.","budgood1","Sep 12, 2002"

4,11.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Nice clear copper color.  Carbonation is evident from the  appearance of gas bubbles surfacing rapidly.  This beer has a very nice caramel malt presence on the nose. And some flowery hop tones.  The main player on the buds is grainy and toasty malt.  Some slight biscuit tones enter the picture fairly quickly also.  What really appeals to me in this O-fest is the hop character.  There's a nice little flowery, bitter, dry contribution from the hops that makes you want to get another sip quickly.  This is really a solid Oktoberfest.  One of Schell's better beers.","Bighuge","Aug 31, 2002"
2.96,-17.8,4.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Attractive -- clear reddish amber, nice darker yellow head of 1/2 inch.  Aroma of yeast and slight spice.  Malt is a little off, it warbles in first impression, first, full but flavorless, then, a little candy but quick to assume a watery and slightly vinegary quality.  Some hops at the finish.  This brew is hurt by the up front profile and could use a little more body.","ADR","Beers"
4.35,20.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Due to circumstances which may have influenced last year's review, I've decided to review a fresh bottle from the 2002 batch.  Pleasant fresh malt aroma with slight roast quality.  Very clear, with nice amber color.  Medium but firm head.  Nice malt flavor right from the start through to the finish.  Good mild roast taste, with just a hint of caramel.  Middle and finish has some dryness with some astringent quality.  Medium mouthfeel and, of course, the Schell richness.  Closer to a sense of robustness that I like in a Marzen, yet can go down quickly and smoothly, if need be.","garymuchow","0"
