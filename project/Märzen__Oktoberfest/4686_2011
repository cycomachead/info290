4.09,18.9,4.25,4,4.25,3.75,4,"Speaking of tapping, I had not had a 5-L mini-keg (CAN) for a while and this was only my third or fourth, so venting was initially problematic as I twisted it more than a quarter-turn, which was too far. When I realized my mistake, I backed it down and got a momentary spray of beer until it pressurized. I pulled out the spigot and readied my glass before twisting the spigot to the left. Beer began flowing unabated! This produced two fingers of fluffy, bone-white head with good retention. Color was Pale-Yellow (SRM = 1 - 2) with NE-plus quality clarity. Nose had a biscuity maltiness. Mouthfeel was medium. Taste was malty, but not cloying as many beers in the style are. Instead, it had a bready, nutty flavor that was a pleasant surprise. Finish was semi-dry, not very sweet at all. Everyone who got a taste agreed that it was less sweet than expected, so whether a result of inadvertent aging or by design, I feel like it was quite worthwhile.","woodychandler","Jan 05, 2015"

3.46,0.6,3.5,3.75,3.25,3.5,3.5,"Pint on tap at Beer Revolution in Calgary. A golden straw color with a light film of white bubbles on top and a pleasing enough aroma, notably floral hops with an unexpected whiff of tropical fruit (lychee?), grapes, corn flake, and rather bready malts. Unfortunately, the taste was more pedestrian, subdued, and dare I say "macro" ... An understated graininess, maybe a very light pear fruitiness, crisp and dry with aggressive carbonation, thin body, and vaguely grassy noble finish. I agree that it is not really anyone's place to claim that this beer somehow fails to capture style guidelines. There are lighter Oktoberfests. However, to my palate this compares unfavorably with other German examples such as Ayinger. I'd prefer the flavors to pop more after the tease on the nose.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 30, 2014"

Taste is very light, some malts, some light grassiness, more pilsner like than oktoberfest in flavor profile. Feels light in the mouth and overall, while a drinkable and decent beer, there are way to many better examples of this style to recommend this one.","tone77","Sep 12, 2014"

4,16.3,,,,,,"Just a general comment and observation on some of the reviews of the German Oktoberfest on here.  To say Spaten-Franziskaner, Paulaner, Warsteiner, Hofbrau, etc "are not good representations of the style" is an erroneous and quite snobbish, ignorant American view.  Although all large breweries, those companies ARE Oktoberfest and are all that's served in the Munich beer tents.  Far, far before American micro-breweries, craft brewers, and snobbish beer geeks, these styles epitomized what not only an Oktoberfest brew is, but their main line epitomized what German beer is.  Before Papa Joe's IPA shack was sold all over the place, going to a German restaurant and having a Spaten on draft was beyond a treat.  Now that we're all so spoiled, and 5000 beers in a store still isn't enough, we've cast off some of these larger European breweries to the curb and put them in the same class as a Miller.  These companies ARE "the style".  Some backyard hipsters operating in a 1000 sqft facility craft brewing are not "the experts" and leading what an Oktoberfest is.  In fact no American brewery is.  There's a huge difference between the German style and the American version.  I look for authentic beers, and when it comes to Oktoberfest, the ONLY beers to drink are from Munich.  The American versions are drain-pour.  Sometimes it's just about the drinkability and being able to pound liter after liter and have fun. Not jack up the ABV to heightened levels, sell it for a premium, and make every bottle some ride on the wild side.  Tis the Gemütlichkeit - ein prosit!","sobuf","Aug 20, 2014"

This is an example of that, but it still ends up being enjoyable. Due to the strict brewing regulation that goes on during the summer months in Germany, these older beers have been lagering sur lie for a longer period of time, and the booze is expected. Also, due to the inordinate amount of people that attend the festival, they have to get them off of the seats somehow!

A lighter version of the style but still over 6% , this is a easy drinking clean marzen that a pleasant bready finish. While not as malty as I like for the style this is typical of the OK fest beers being served these days in Munich, lighter in colour and taste. I will buy more of this but other German Pils at around $2 a tall can present a better value.","canucklehead","Sep 28, 2013"

Taste of apple, pear, caramel, toasted grain, bread, grass, floral, pepper, herbal, earthy spiciness, and light skunkiness. Lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, toasted grain, bread, pepper, herbal, floral, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a bit. Ok flavor balance and complexity; with a good balance of malt and peppery spiciness from the hops; a fair amount of cloying astringency is present on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is decent. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a mediocre Oktoberfest. Skunked flavors and aromas; with flavor astringency on the finish make this much less enjoyable. Quite easy to drink, though.","superspak","Nov 17, 2012"

Carbonation bubbles are readily visible as they make their continuous migration toward the surface. The aroma has an appreciable skunkiness that masks earthy hops and trace amounts of malt sweetness. The exceedingly thin and light appearance would lead one to believe the flavor would match, but that is not the case at all. The flavor is surprisingly robust, with some caramel, brown sugar, and a distinctive nuttiness that I would never have suspected. Just enough hops are present to balance the malt sweetness, and the carbonation is spot-on, lending a creamy mouthfeel that complements the flavor profile well. I think I'm detecting trace amounts of apple peel near the back end as well. The sticky malt residue lingers on the lips, denoting a body belied by the thin visage. As far as criticisms are concerned, the hops overstay their welcome a bit in the finish, and the sweetness comes off a tad artificial, but there's no denying this is highly sessionable brew with more robustness than I'd expect to find in an oktoberfest. One of the more intriguing festbiers I've tried.","MaximalC","Nov 12, 2012"

It's still a refreshing, reliable brew in its own right - unfortunately, it's one that this Euro Lager fan merely likes, rather than loves. One thing I will say is that this is a perfect pairing for the first week of genuinely cold weather we've had all year here - it's light enough to be session-worthy, but hot enough to warm you a little as the night goes on.

Notes of light caramel mix with a large bouquet of hay and grass with light biscuit touches on the edges of the smell. The beer tastes light and highly drinkable. Heavy notes of creamy caramel mingle with notes of hay and earthy hops. The sip begins as light sweet caramel bordering on sweet apples, but then opens into heavy hay-like flavoring that reminds me of a traditional saison a hell of a lot more than an Oktoberfest. From there it slides into more spicy and earthy hop notes, and then lingers in the mouth as a mix of pilsner-like hops and hay. Mouthfeel is thin and highly drinkable, which is wonderful for the style. Carbonation is light, and the beer practically slides off the tongue lightly and leaves the mouth slightly dry with some saliva on the edges. Overall this is a mediocre almost-session ale, but it does not taste like a Oktoberfest by my measure. The heavy hay-funk notes make me think that this beer might have an infection or something, but I actually like them and found them refreshingly palatable. An enjoyable chugger, but nothing like what you would expect from the style.","Maxwell","Oct 10, 2012"

The flavor follows suit, but has a garnish twist of apple esters at the back end with some light amount of boozy heat. It's not a bold or amazing beer by any stretch of the imagination, but it suffers badly from style mismatch to the expected marzen standard. (Where are the toasted nutty qualities?) And the green glass bottle certainly doesn't help in terms of skunkiness. I can't really recommend this one, sadly. It might have been better than average when it began it's journey across the Atlantic, but it certainly didn't stay that way.","WastingFreetime","Beers"

Taste is caramel malt, mildly sweet with a good toasted breadiness. Clean hop bitterness in the finish has muted Sazz notes and light peppery zing. Alcohol is hidden at first but as it warms it gives notice. Feel is medium light crisp and refreshing. A decent thirst quencher. This goes down well and drinks like a session lager when cold but the abv is a little high so be careful.

The smell is citric and bready and with that dishrag whiff this kind of beer should have. The taste is bitter, fruity and with a lot of bread. There is a slight sweetness and a some alcohol too.

I could see this being my go-to drink for say, several games of beer pong, for example.

Odor was slightly skunky, but that is not unusual for the style. Malt, watery sweetness and some light cooked hops were present. Taste was very nice. Quite palatable. Flavors of malt, grass, and hops were present, as was a slightly bitter character. Finished smooth, with a note of bitterness and some dryness. This could be a easy pick for a session oktoberfest.

Some what sweet after the bitterness subsides. Body medium to high, somewhat creamy, moderate carbonation. The head retention (being the two finger size or what ever the standard pour is) is low but it keeps a skim of head throughout the remainer of the session.

Smells like an unpleasant pilsner at first (mass produced, yuck). At this point I am very disappointed in Hofbrau. However, as it warms, there is some citrus and even a little spice on the nose (cloves?), so I am pleased that there is something interesting going on. Tastes better than it smells, with the smooth citrus, cloves, and at the end, honey. Mouthfeel is quite pleasant, smooth, easy. However, I can't get into this as an oktoberfest.

The smell is of... well, the main odor is that scent which most macro drinkers describe as "beer-like." I can pick out some corn odor in there - that's fine when eating, say corn on the cob, but its not welcome emanating from my beverage! The taste is similarly macro-pilsnerish. Very thin mouthfeel.

The nose is clean and enjoyable but not impressive for the style with just some light grainy malt and a hint of alcohol. The body is medium falling towards light with a gently crisp carbonation. The flavor offers a clean, grainy malt that's nice but doesn't offer the richness of Vienna and/or Munich malts that the darker versions do; and it's well-balanced with a firm bitterness and spicy character (alcohol, hops, or both?) but the alcohol is a bit noticeable which is odd for a beer of just 6%abv.

There's some of that skunky taste.  And after cutting through that, it tastes more like a light lager than an Ofest.
