3.31,-9.8,3.75,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.25,"There's really not much that is truly remarkable about this beer. A very safe Sam Adams interpretation of the style. The semi-opaque, copper colored liquid does bring a whisper of Autumn and the changing of the leaves. Beyond that, it's a decidedly average beer. Quite sessionable actually, with a nice mix of pleasant, yet tame qualities. Oddly though, there is a metallic twang to this beer that I can't quite explain. In that respect, it's reminiscent of an adjunct lager drank straight from a can (which I occasionally find enjoyable). However, the buttery diacetyl flavor, tangy bite and mild amber malt characteristics give this beer much more character than your average BMC. The light spices that poke through on the finish are a nice touch that keep you coming back for more. Quite an interesting beer. It simultaneously manages to be innocuous and common, yet has just enough character and style to keep you going back for more. I guess that's why Sam is among the kings of craft. They have found a way to make subtle flavor and artistry appeal to the masses.","JohnnyI","Dec 23, 2014"

There are a good number of richer and arguably more flavorful Oktoberfests out there, but at 5.3%, what do you expect? This would be a good idea to pick up as a 12 pack for a football tailgate or something along those lines since many people would find this beer agreeable and nonoffensive. While I would definitely drink this again if someone offered it, I probably would not buy it for myself.","enjambed","Oct 20, 2014"

Aroma of rich toasty malts and fresh green grapes, almost whiskey-like, sweet toffee with a light whiff of yeast. Classic o-fest, really. Body is on the thin side and the carbonation is intense, but in getting past these aspects one can find some toasted bread crust, sultana, light molasses, apples, pears, and even some faint citrus. Weighted towards the crisp, dry, and toasty, not particularly sweet, particularly in the finish. This may not have as much of the classic German malt character you get in some old world examples, but there is a solid noble hop flavor and the rich, deep flavors edge out some of the European examples in my view. Apparently it is not cool to rate this beer highly? Screw that noise. Quality is quality.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 05, 2014"

4,9,,,,,,"Yeah, yeah, I know: "Sam Adams isn't even a craft brewery, anymore! They're too COMMERCIAL! They just crank out any old thing and slap a label on it!" TRANSLATION: "They're not the new hot thing." Stipulated. And most "serious craft beer fans" would rather give up a body part than be caught actually LIKING something like this Octoberfest. But, as I'm too old and cranky to give a shit about what anyone else thinks, here it is: Sam Adams Octoberfest is a really FINE example of this style. It's got that hallmark Marzen heartiness, great caramel and citrus notes, and subtle but nicely resiny hops. It, like all great Octoberfest beers, is amazingly easy to drink...which is probably why the roving packs of wet-nosed craft geeks don't like it. But if you're a mature, thoughtful beer connoisseur, you'll like this a LOT. Walk right past the craft "experts" and pick this up for a taste of how a great American brewery does German.","DJMonroe","Sep 27, 2014"

I don't know what the hype is about it, its very gross. Very mawkish and distasteful. Try some other Oktoberfests, you'll be glad you did. This is like the Bud Light of Oktoberfests. Just skip it.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Sep 11, 2014"

The aroma for the most part is of sweet caramel malts. The taste is pretty close with a hint of burnt brown sugar in theere also. Medium bodied. No bitter or harsh aftertaste at all.

4,9,4,4,4,4,4,"Samuel Adams Octoberfest Brewed by Boston Beer Company with an ABV of 5.3% This brew pours out a light brown color with a small white head. The smell is rich with grains and some sweetness. There is not much to the smell of this brew. The taste is smooth and rich with spices. This brew has a nice balance to it, there is nothing over powering . The mouthfeel is nice and pleasent and crisp. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out of 5. Samuel Adams Octoberfest was better than what I expecting. I would get this brew again.","nicholas2121","Aug 02, 2014"

4.21,14.7,5,4,4.25,4,4.25,"My personal favorite beer. Wonderfully balanced warm aroma that gently whiffs of the hop character. Beautiful slightly browned head, and a lovely amber color. The warmth of the malt followed by a smoothly bitter hop bite comes on nicely, and leaves only a slight aftertaste making you want more. Not too heavy, but definitely nowhere near what you'd call light. Perfect compliment to a meal, or to be consumed on it's own.","thefullmontiii","Apr 25, 2014"

Some snap in the taste, but not enough. Yeah, way too thin for this style. I do believe I'll have to follow this up with a Summit Oktoberfest to assure me of how good it could get. This version just falls too short.","feloniousmonk","Oct 21, 2013"

Poured smooth but the head was smaller than I remembered in the past. The taste was better than most Octoberfest-type beers I've tried, though not the best. Good, but not the best. HOWEVER ... I happened to try this particular offering last Sunday for the 1st time this year. The wife prepared some pork chops with baked sweet potatoes. OMG. This Octoberfest paired with that meal, especially the sweet potatoes, was pure Nirvana. We immediately planned to have friends over in a few weeks just so we can entertain this Samuel Adams Octoberfest with the pork and sweet potato. It is Slap-Yo-Mama Good. Overall, the beer itself is good but what makes a beer is, IMHO, the meal it compliments. The point is the beer is good, but with the right meal, on the right day, THAT is what makes the experience. Look, the beer is above average. Enjoy it.","RyanH","Sep 27, 2013"

I sometimes really want the Boston Ale. However, when September rolls around my German side (25%) overpowers all that and insists that I glug down as much of the Octoberfest (spelled wrong, it's got a 'K' people!) as I can get. I'm not a big fan of the characteristic Sam Adams carbonation scheme so I'm knocking it on mouthfeel. However, I love the color and the taste is solid, particularly on tap. It doesn't hold up to real German Oktoberfests but I still respect Sam Adams and love this beer.","EmpiricalBill","Sep 25, 2013"

Has a nice toasted quality but not much sweetness and the spice stays faint even though it does present a bit more on the nose an don the palate as the beer warms. My criticism of the taste is that buttery quality. I don't like it on the palate or in the mouthfeel. It has a sour little under taste and together with the buttery flavor is just not what I want. It sits heavy in the stomach even though it drinks pretty light. This is my first octoberfest beer.","utopiajane","Sep 17, 2013"

Tastes like sweet caramel, bread, and roasted malts with no hop profile. It has a very thin body and low to moderate carbonation. Nothing impressive, but it's got a good solid sweet roasted malt backbone. It was good paired with sausage, but left me wanting more in the mouthfeel.","ExaltedNecrosis","Aug 31, 2013"

The "burnt wood" taste is gone and sweet maltiness came to the forefront instead. Just to be sure, tried it in some other glassware combinations and confirmed the acrid burnt wood flavor in all but tall ice tea glass and can. Not something I would have expected. Tall glass also brings back the bock character that I initially expected and reduces the booziness. Upgraded the scores accordingly.","VictorWisc","Aug 21, 2013"

It has plenty of malt flavor, and the malt provides sweetness that is only half checked by the hop bitterness that comes in later. Typical autumn flavors of caramel, toffee, and maybe pumpkin as well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with some astringency biting the tongue. Overall, I like the fact that it is easily available, but with Great Lakes Oktoberfest hitting the shelves this week, I'm going to have to go with that one instead this season.","DeFaz","Aug 18, 2013"

Poured a nice copper color, produced a tan head, nice retention and it left a nice amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma of this Oktoberfest consisted of toasted malt, sweet caramel and some herbal hops. Medium bodied, full of malted grains, (5 different malts according to the bottle), suggestions of fresh baked bread, and a nice helping of herbal hops. Well balanced, somewhat sweet. Overall, very nice example of the style- Great session beer and well balanced. This is one of Samuel Adam's most popular offerings, probably should have tried this years ago.

Pours fairly crystal clear orange amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of pear, apple, caramel, toast, bread, light toffee, and herbal hops. Pretty nice aromas with decent balance; a bit too fruity. Taste of caramel, pear, apple, toast, bread, light toffee, and light herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of light fruits, caramel, toast, bread, light toffee, and light herbal spiciness on the finish for a short bit. Pretty good flavor balance; quite a bit watery feeling on the finish; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is decent. Seriously lacking the creamy and slick mouthfeel this style usually shows. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a decent Oktoberfest. Needs less fruitiness and more bready/caramel flavors; but this is still very drinkable. Fairly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 11, 2012"

When fall rolls around, and it's the Octoberfest, I'm thankful there's been at least this much breakthrough. It's reliable. It's tasty and refreshing for what it is. Many have done worse, and most of the taps around it prove it. Yes, it's pretty simple and two-dimensional, but it's consistently well-executed, and it's a relief to find available so I don't have to settle for Yuengling or that green bottle. Would be great to take to a party of BMC drinkers for a Saturday afternoon of football watching and grilled brats and turn them on to something they can actually taste. In a good bottle shop, it's not even a consideration. But when out for a burger and a beer, it's a friendly port in a storm of swill.","BuckeyeSlim","Oct 13, 2012"

It's biscuity, got some sweet booziness to it, and plenty of malty goodness, but it's as easy to chug down all night as it is to sip slowly. It's also got barely enough hops to balance out the flavour, which I think is great for the style. It's only problems is that maybe it's a little too sweet and sticky and got a little bit of a weird aftertaste.

Not outstanding, complex or especially memorable, but a solid brew in its own right - something that would go nicely with a hearty meal as well as on its own. In a pinch I'd probably just stick with their Boston Lager, but if I were in the mood for a heftier, slightly more warming lager for the fall months, I'd consider picking this one up again next year. Certainly worth a try.","thehyperduck","Oct 07, 2012"

Aroma of sweet and bready malt with a hint of toasted malt and hops. Flavor is a pleasant lightly toasted, somewhat biscuity malt with slight light fruit and caramel. Solid biscuit malt finish with light hops. Medium bodied. A nice take on an Octoberfest, not complex, but with the expected solid malt body and finish.","LiquidAmber","Oct 07, 2012"

Lingering tangy toffee and mild sweetness are the closest things we have to lasting impressions here. Appropriately mild bitterness with modest leafy hop flavor and carbonation.

Decent head, even if it is gone too quickly and good lacing on the glass. The dry notes in the back are a perfect counter to the malt taste in the front and the spice in the middle. Aroma is mild but not to the point of non-existence, and the bouquet of fall season comes out the more the beer is sloshed around in the glass. A wonderful flowery note on the top of the aroma. The carbonation is high, but the beer is pretty full bodied so it doesn't make the beer too soda-y. I have had a ton of Octoberfests over the last few years, and yet every year this is the one that defines the season for me. A wonderful, wonderful beer.","chrisjduncan","Sep 11, 2012"

The nose of this beer is somewhat malty but fairly plain and uninspiring, its like a very toned down part of the taste which is the weak part of the beer. The taste of this beer is what you would expect out of an Oktoberfest. Its quite malty. There is a lot of crystal and Munich malt flavors and has a lot of notes of toffee. This is an easy drinking beer with plenty of flavor and a nice feel. This beer would compliment just about anything perfectly. It is my go to Oktoberfest and one of SA's best offerings.","TwelveOunces","Aug 27, 2012"

Some lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. There's a strong roasted barley malt aroma in the nose. I also detect some mild sweetness and grassy hops. The beer is very bready up front. There is some mild sweetness and the hops bring some balance on the back end. The aftertaste is also pretty malty. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is dry. The drinkability is high. This is a very good beer. I still look forward to this one every year.","acevenom","Aug 17, 2012"

3.85,4.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"2012--Pours a clear golden copper with a 1/4", quickly dissipating, caramel-colored head. The nose is characterized by brown sugar, caramel, cinnamon, and banana. The mouthfeel is so soft, thick, and wet, with just a hint of carbonation on the back of the tongue. Very, very pleasant. A nearly perfect balance of brown sugar, ripe date, and cinnamon comprise the flavor. There's no overdone, gimmicky pumpkin or cinnamon. It's a very classy Oktoberfest. And, thank God, there is not that usual, off-putting hop presence that is so often prominent in Sam Adams beers. This year is a huge improvement over last year. Thank you Boston Beer Co! Overall: 4.0; up from 3.75 from last year.","DocJitsu","Apr 24, 2012"

Perhaps next to Anchor Bock in an historical sense. It doesn't keep up with the flashy beers around, or the new beers on the block, or even some of the other Octoberfest beers available. But it's solid and drinkable. Higher overall score for its place in the pantheon of craft beer.","macrosmatic","Apr 09, 2012"

4.12,12.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"O - Despite having an Octoberfest in February, I can safely say that Im enjoying it. A cold night beer. I was expecting a heavier taste and mouthfeel but it has a nice balance of both to make it enjoyable. The foamy head was kinda dissapointing but the flavor really makes up for it and Im relieved when I get closer to the bottom of the glass...It could be old to which that might be why the head looses its body early but that really doesnt matter at this point. Overall, I like it and will having more in the near future, regardless of month.","TheGarvenator","Feb 20, 2012"

3.47,-5.4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz "pint" glass. Pours a nice dark amber color with a tiny head that dissipates and disappears very quickly. Smells of nice carimaly malts, but not overly strongly. The taste is dominated by the malt, which is a bit darker, but not that strong toward any specific flavor. Definitely tastes like an Octoberfest, but nothing too special. Carbonation seems right, and it does go down well. Overall, a slightly above average beer. One that is a beer worth drinking, but not one to seek out.","cyclonece09","Feb 07, 2012"

3.68,0.3,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Poured a nice amber with a stiff ivory head that took its time diminishing and clung somewhat. Smells bready sweet, bordering on pretzel. Taste is sweet without being sickening. Very rich malt is perfectly balanced by hop bitterness. Starts sweet and ends right in the middle. The little bit of alcohol that reveals itself when enjoyed with mustard, crackers and cheese was pretty nice. Body is not too heavy. Carbonation is adequate and goes from sharp to creamy as you reach the end of the glass. Haven't had too many Octoberfests... that being said this is the best one I've had. I will definitely get a 6-er next fall. Try it, you won't be disipointed.","Justin23060","Dec 22, 2011"

Time takes the subtile edge off of these mass market/craft beers, particularly the aromatics and finish. I've had very good ones and poor ones. It is Beer O'Clock on Friday and my draft Octoberfest's appearance is deep and rich in its plain 20oz glass. It has a subdued head, as the draft seems well chilled. It has a smooth and pleasant caramel sweetness that turns slightly tannic bitter in the finish that does not linger. It is not dry. I find it a tad over hopped for the style, a tendency with Sam Adams. The taste flourishes at a cool temperature. Like most Sam Adams I find it to be a solid representation of the style and certainly worth drinking.","amightywind","Nov 02, 2011"

It had some of the basic octoberfest characteristics, basically tasting like an average medium lager. I had a high quality of ingredient traits, but it just didn't seem like the ingredient portfolio was very diverse. Just kind of small for a craft ocotberfest in my opinion.","LBHops62","Oct 28, 2011"

Now this particular brew, the Octoberfest, is a very lush amber colour with a decent head that disappears a bit quickly. carbonation is slight but that works with the flavour heavy style.

I don't ever recall having an orange in an Oktoberfest beer so I told her that was alright with me. The beer looked a good fall amber color with a one and a half finger head that lasted quite a while and left some good lacing. I could not detect any distinct smell and the taste was more malt that hops. The carbonation level was moderate (the special glass would have made more bubbles and perhaps more flavor).

It was not cloyingly sweet, but more toasty sweet, if that makes any sense. I liked it simply because I do not like overly sweet anything. The finish was semi-sweet and very pleasant.

Lots of carbonation on the pour, with a healthy, thick, dense two inch head that quickly settles down into a film covering. Aromas of rich caramel and smokey malt fill the nose, with some light nutty highlights. Flavors are light and crisp in mouth, with a rich malt character strongly profiled, and highlighted by some light spicing and a smokey background. The aftertaste is very sweet, but not overpowering, and the beer has a clean and crisp finish, with a slight drying at the end. Very decent, and very light and crisp for the style.","GarthDanielson","Aug 28, 2011"

The first thing I notice about this beer is it's fantastic color- it's a beautiful coppery orange. The smell is sweet and malty.

Medium body and carbonation with a slick sweet mouthfeel. Decent beer, but their are certainly better beers in the style.

Even though I'm not a huge fan of Märzens (or Sam Adams for that matter), this is a solid brew that nails the style. It's also very versatile: mild enough to drink all night, but enough flavor to have with dinner. It is actually great with milder meals like rice & beans or a grilled chicken sandwich.

It's a clear and clean looking with a nice looking head on it that leaves a touch of lacing. The smell of the beer has a good balance of autumn aromas, malts and hops. The taste of the beer is a little sweet upfront before the spices kick in. The flavors of some cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg come together and leave your taste buds tingling with a light hops bitterness on the end. The mouthfeel is a medium bodied and very drinkable in my opinion. If you can get, it try it!","Knapp85","May 24, 2011"

The overall has a rather prune taste, just a tad sour and not sugary, and ever so slightly moldey. Very subtle hops at the end, hardly bitter at all.

Sweet, dense, smooth malty base with some strong shortbread/butter cookie overtones and a spicy/zesty orange peel nip to it. Nice level of carbonation carries the malt feel and flavor quite well.

The initial head is stupendous - really thick, whipped foam. It gives way fairly soon, but the lacing is dense and even. The color is rich copper, mostly clear with about a 10% haze. I smell cocoa or chocolate milk immediately, with not a lot else Underpinning this is malt, but again little else. The flavor is chewy, sweet, caramel, prune, medium spice and chocolaty malts finishing it off. Mainly true to the style, but the cocoa is a new twist. The mouthfeel suffers from stickiness and tongue goop which repeated sips do not wash down. Drinkability is low. I wouldn't have more than one. Even though it is not bad in any serious way, it just doesn't merit another purchase. I mostly enjoyed it for a one-off taste test.","MNJR","Nov 20, 2010"

The mouthfeel was a disappointment, as I found it be be thin and slightly watery. Drinkability was decent, as it's smooth and easy going down.

Those malts really work well together, giving a bready, just barely sweet full flavor, followed up by a firm bitterness. For me, a good O'fest has to be drinkable by the liter.

The flavor is also malty, with a little bitterness in the finish. I feel as though it conforms well to the style. There are some good caramel flavors. The beer has a medium body.

The taste is better than the smell actually with a really rich malt taste and an amazing body feel for the lower alcohol content it has. The hops are subtle just to add to the malt.

There is also some hop bitterness in there, but it is just the right amount. It has a medium body with mild carbonation. Overall a great beer that I really enjoyed. Much more accessible than other marzens, such as Paulaner, Hofbrau or Ayinger, but still a great brew. I am almost always impressed by Jim Koch and Sam Adams.

This one's a malt bomb, with very little hop character to balance it out. Caramel, bread, and some syrupy sweetness characterize this one. MF is medium, adequate, although not mind-blowing.

Irreverent lacing and not particularly noticeable in character in the smell, the beer does have a nice herbal, piney malt smell with some mint and rye grains in the mouth. Typical of the style.

Question is...is this lack of quality control at certain brewing sites? I believe they are brewing in the Lehigh Valley now at the old Rolling Rock place but not sure.

Nice glow to the red amber color, thins into a zinc orange around the rims. The nose is gently spiced with clove, nutmeg and allspice, followed on by cereal, mixed white citrus and oregano and bay leaf herbs, neither that malty nor that fruity. In the mouth it's medium-bodied, the carbonation arguably a bit much for the primary material and does not allow the flavors time to soak in. More of that raw spice mixed in with herbs and a light metallic accent. Hard to shake that dilute feeling, no fruit or citrus to fill in the blanks and the malts not very sweet, some dark chocolate dust. The graininess milled down and powdery.

The taste is of caramel malt at first and that gives way to a smooth not too bitter finish(actually the finish is a little bit sweet also). The hop flavors become apparent in the finish and aftertaste. Mouthfeel is just about right. A light feel that goes down easy with a little bit of carbonation. Very drinkable beer. I would have no problem drinking this in mass quantities.","Kromes","Oct 02, 2009"
3.2,-12.8,3,3,3,3,4,"As a die hard IPA user maybe my taste buds are warped. IMO this is a session beer with very little distinction. Obviously a very safe drinkable lager, and not bad by any means. There is just nothing to excite you drinking this beer, Not much of a head, little on the nose. Where are the hops? I know it's not an IPA, but still a little hops showing thru is what makes the European lager shine. Drinks like a BMC in my opinion, and in comparison an expensive one at that. Nice to try but Spaten Oct Fest is much better.","nc41","Oct 01, 2009"

Very basic, and not a lot of hop characteristics to balance it out, but it was still good and really drinkable/refreshing. A nice, medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.

Taste is of caramel malts, witha touch of honey up front, hints of roasted malts are present and a slight touch of floral hops. Nothing really truly jumps out about the taste.

The taste is pretty similar with an initial burst of firm malt followed by a seltzery fizziness and some late nuttiness. Kind of amazing how much this falls off.

Depending on how carefully you pour it you can get a very thick frothy head with multiple sized bubbles or if your careful like you'll get a just an about 1 fingered head that goes away in about a minute or two. Either way you'll get a light caramel colored head with better than average lacing. The smell is very good, roasted malts take up the bulk of the smell. To me it smells like fall. Taste is very good too. More malty than hoppy like most Octoberfests, not quite as well balanced as the traditional Boston Lager but still fairly well balanced and a good brew. Mouthfeel is good, I'd consider it a slight step above a medium bodied beer with excellent drinkability, I could drink this all day. A usual standby for me every fall until I get sick of drinking it.

They are experts in lagers and the Marzen is likely their best lagered offering.

Very sweet and therefore not highly drinkable, and much different than the draft version, but still a highly individualistic interpretation of the style and a wonderful way to complete the sixteen days of Oktoberfest.","superdedooperboy","Oct 05, 2008"
4,9,4,4,4,4,4,"12oz. bottle served in my Harpoon Octoberfest mug. Best by February notched on the label. Poured a translucent copper with a one inch off-white cap dimpled with tiny bubbles. Head eventually dissipated into a soapy swirl. Some lacing, but weak legs. Nose is caramel malt and cereal grains. Taste follows nose with a little hops in the mix. Finish is not as sweet, and much dryer than most Oktoberfests. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied and evenly carbonated. Easy drinking and one of my personal favorites for the style.","Jwale73","Oct 05, 2008"

The Octoberfest I had on tap last night did not display the same characteristics. In fact it was quite enjoyable. It pours a nice dark copper, the head had dissapated by the time the beer was brought to my table. The taste is very grainy, but enjoyable.

Taste is like the nose, a touch of clove, wood, vanilla, and a very weak attempt at spice. Aftertaste smacks of alcohol and a very mild hop character.

I often dislike Oktoberfests, so maybe I just have odd taste. I did use it to swallow a vitamin (I imagine my mother shuddered for no apparent reason when that happened), but that wasn't until three quarters through the glass. The carbonation is pleasant and the beer has a good dryness, but I'm put off by the off note. That sounded a bit repetitive. With the help of BA, I'm seriously cutting my teeth as a beer snob.

The blending of the malts and hops is really excellent and has a sort of sweet and bitter aftertaste that makes me always want a second glass.

This beer has a strong roasted malt scent, which highlights caramel and toasted aromas. The taste of this brew is very good which makes it easy drinking. While others will feel that this brew is unexciting, I find it to be a good version of a Marzen beer with is consistence and flavors. The taste is very malty which gives it a bread/dough like flavor mixed with a toasted like flavor. I do not pick up much of a clear hop presence meaning that I think things are fairly balanced out for this beer. The brew finishes relatively dry while having a fairly creamy feel through out.

There is some carbonation mixing in which impacts the mild bite in the finish to a certain degree. Not an overly malty flavor. The mouthfeel is carbonated, moderately bitter in the finish, quick and slippery in that it doesn't leave any lasting impression after the swallow.

The palate is precisely what the nose tells you - malt goodness, followed by drying, floral hops. Nice. Mouth feel is on the acidic side with more than ample carbonation. Finish is dry and leaves a lingering herbal and malt combination in the mouth. I'd estimate this to be a pretty decent American Oktoberfest beer.

It appears SAs went overboard with specialty malts as this beer is way out of balance. I'd also like to know if they used North American or European 2-row barely. This beer is way too sweet and bready and lacks the subtlety of a true Oktoberfest beer. This is a surprise as SA makes a very nice, well balanced Scotish Ale.

Hops were there but played a secondary role as accent and highlights. Finish and into the aftertaste was a drying sweetness. Mouthfeel was smooth and buttery with low apparent carbonation.

The taste is quite balanced, with of course a focus on the caramelly breadiness of the malt. There's a hint of bitterness in its lingering finish.

The initial taste of the beer is moderate-high sweet maltiness with a gentle toasted background and hop bitterness is low, but is there enough to create good balance. There is no detectable hop flavor or aroma. The beer is exceptionally smooth and the sweetness is balanced nicely by the background of toasted malt. Carbonation is moderate with a medium-full body yet still decent drinkability. Overall I really enjoyed this Octoberfest. The beer is on the sweeter end of Octoberfests Ive had recently, but still has enough balance in large part due to the toasted grains. The one thing that really stands out with this Fest is its remarkable smoothness, definitely the smoothest Octoberfest Ive had.

Flavors are off and not what I expect when I open a bottle of what I think to be an oktoberfest. It has a malty sweetness, yes, but that is far overdone. Lacks any depth to the malt flavors.

Aroma is rich with a huge maltiness, sweet caramel and toffee notes dominating, light hoppy undertones round out the nose. Taste is very malty, much more than from the bottle, light grassy hop bitterness halfway balances between the superb malt character this beer offers. Mouthfeel is smoother and seemingly less carbonated than that of the bottle, a welcome change as the balance of the light to medium body pairs well with the lower levels of carbonation.

I found this beer to be a very average beer and was left wondering why there was so many forum posts lauding this as the best Oktoberfest beer. Other then the color of the beer, nothing else about it would make me believe this was an Oktoberfest style beer, and I would be more apt to call it a generic dark beer. Color was a medium to dark brown with a thin head. I found the beer to seem somewhat watery and very light in terms of mouthfeel. Aroma had mild hops, and the flavor was much the same. All in all, a pretty average brew that doesn't live up to the hype. I regret to say, this was the worst beer I had at the Oktoberfest but was the one I was really looking forward to trying.

I then poured it into a Samuel Adams glass that I own. The color was a deep amber copper. I liked that. The taste was a mild toffe and caramel with a smooth finish.

There was a nice sheety lace left behind that lasted to the end of the glass. The aromas were not as strong as I would have thought and liked, but noticable and pleasing, I nosed lots of rich and sweet malts, spices and some light hops. The tastes were more pronounced, ton of mixing malts and spices, from sweet malts to rich malts and defined spices, caramels, and some notes of dark fruit (as it warmed), hints of hops (mostly a spicey hop, but slight floral became noticable as it warmed) swirled in and out near the middle and end of the swallow and turned to a dry hop flavor as a last taste down the throat.

3.2,-12.8,3,3,3.5,3,3,"Opinion: Well...its not contaminated or anything. This is not what I would call an Octoberfest beer. It is more of a cross between a Northern Pilsner (Hop presence in flavor), and a mild Munich Dunkel (Light bittering hops for finish). Its not a bad tasting beer, but it is rather uneventful and disappointing in the malt aspects. The hops are too aggressive to, I guess, try and make up for the lack of malt. Its OK...just not to style.","SkeeterHawk","Nov 07, 2005"

It pours a crystal clear orange-red with a slightly tan head that is fairly large and fluffy at first, but quickly fades to a thin coating on top of the beer. Aroma is malt sweetness, with some caramel notes and a twinge of spicy hops. Flavor is very malty and sweet, a bit too sweet for my liking, with some nutty flavors as well. Slightly cloying sweetness in the finish, with a bit of hops. All in all, a solid fall seasonal and a good session beer.","ColForbin","Nov 06, 2005"

Though for some, the malt flavor may be a drawback after a couple of beers. After a few, it may come across as fairly heavy. Nevertheless, it is one of the better Octoberfests for the price in my opinion, granted I got this bottle from a buddy of mine.

The slightest of hops is there, very gentle, wafting through the dominant malts. The flavor follows through, and I believe the best desription is tha flavors of King's Hawaiian Bread. And that's a compliment- I love that bread! It's moderately dense, sweet, and chewy- the bread that is. But it's also a pretty good description of this beer.

For me, the smell was a little too sweet but also has more of a malty backing instead of grainy, which is a plus. The taste is strong and bitey but not overpowering. A quality hop count is present and accounted for as well. Mouthfeel is very smooth and a little creamy. This is a pretty impressive specimen.

The smell is malt-dominant and sweet with aromas of caramel, toffee, grass and a light fruitiness. The taste follows suit with the malts taking centre stage. Hrm. It starts out with a nice chewy malt flavor supported by a light herbal bitterness, but it turns a bit thin in the middle. A little honey and savory show up briefly. The slightly bitter finish is below average, with very little appealing flavors lingering. I wasnt impressed by this one. Its not bad, but Ive had several better this year.

This beer tastes better than the Fest and does not leave the metallic aftertaste I noticed with the Fest. Light beer...good taste...good mouthfeel...no unusual after-taste.

3.78,3,5,4.5,3.5,4,3,"Bottle obtained from Meridian Wine & Spirits (Lafayette, Colorado) and consumed later that same evening. Pours a 1.5 finger dirty tan head that hangs like Tom Dooley. The beer is rich orange-rust and crystal clear. Smells reich caramel sweet malty during the pour. To the nose, crisp rich grains. Sugar, careml, and some munich malt. Tin hops...maybe Saaz? Toasted grains, smells yummy and looks yummy. Tastes caramel, toasty grains, with some apricot (that's a flavor that doesn't belong) sweet, and a hint of sour grains. Sweet in the mouth, but a dry finish. I don't care for the high carbonation it makes the beer leave the tongue too soon. After swirling to release carb, the head, which, had disappeared, returns in its full glory. The beer tastes much better now. A sweet, yet sour, grain hangs like a thick dark cloud near my tonsils. Yeah, it keeps some of the toasty beer flavor around. Hmmm. I wonder if that flavor could be some floral from hops? yes, now I think it might be. Not Saaz, though...Tettnanger? Maybe. Hallertauer..I think not. Smooth slick mouthfeel, thank goodness I got rid of the carbonation. Drinkability is so, so. The dry gets to me by the end and the toasty becomes a bit too tannic or phenolic. Very enjoyable with many qualities that remond me of the beers I had in Germany last year.","mentor","Sep 21, 2005"

Malty aromas and perhaps a hint of hops as well. Good strong hoppy start in taste. This yields to a bready malt which spreads over the tongue leaving a gingerbread aftertaste.

The beer is well made and retains its flavor well, being as drinkable on the cold first sip as it is on the moderately warmed final sip.

There were hops in the background but oddly it kinda balanced everything out. The downfall is that the flavor just tastes watered down. The mouthfeel, is ok.

Very easy going flavor and spot on as far as typical of style, a good brown sugar approach with a backbone of toastiness that integrates well with the body. Slight fade as the beer transitions through front to back, just a slight uptick in a sense of straw and hay at the close.

Aroma is also up to par with Vienna toasted nut malt tones in the aroma and residual caramel notes arising one warming treat just a lil early in mid August in this heat, just not fall yet. Flavors blend well with a great toasted nuts flavoring from the specialty malts used and spiced up goodness to go around bringing not only a solid representation but maybe a lil uniqueness from the BBC.

3.36,-8.4,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"This is a very "safe" offering from the Boston Beer Company. Very average and unexciting compared to other Oktoberfestbiers. Worth trying if it's all you can get, but worth passing on if you can find better. I also swear that the recipe is being dumbed down every year ...","Todd","Sep 19, 2002"
3.19,-13.1,4,2.5,3,3.5,4,"Well lagered crystal clear dark copper in hue, covered by an ivory white, thick persistant head that leaves rough lace. The aroma is comprised of a spicy / herbal noble hop nose accompanied by lightly toasty Munich and caramel malt.  Fruity melanoidins are present as a trace. Fairly tame aromawise.  Bready, biscuity sweetness upfront yields to caramel malt and dark fruitiness, with mild hop bitterness providing a lightly bittersweet character mid palate.  Lightly bodied and crisp in mouthfeel, lending an oddly refreshing nature to this brew.  Finishes w/ trace notes of butter.  This is not a particularly good Octoberfest due to its thin malt backbone and overall lack of complexity.  Sam's Ofest is flavorful and clean enough for good drinkability, however.  It's better than average, for sure.","marc77","Sep 19, 2002"
3.2,-12.8,3,3,3.5,3,3,"Not really bad, but the standard Boston Lager is more complex and inviting.","shirfan","Sep 16, 2002"
3.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"I agree with what "beerluvr" said about this beer being different in the past.It seems to be more malty and syrupy than that of previous years.The carbonation appeared to be off as well(not as sticky).I did drink this as soon as it was released as opposed to drinking last years after it had aged a bit.Some guys at my work had questioned the difference too, so I knew I wasn't crazy.All in all a good beer, but not a favorite and I will hesitate next year.","dpend","Sep 10, 2002"
3.63,-1.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This seasonal offering pours a reddish-copper color with a huge, pillowy head that leaves considerable lace. The head is rather overwhelming and holds up well. The smell, on the other hand, is lacking. I smell a somewhat nutty malty aroma, but it's subdued. The taste is rather sweet and malty with some fruity undertones. Mouthfeel is a bit watery and lightly carbonated, but it does bring the drinkability up a bit. This is one of the better domestic Octoberfest offerings and is worth seeking out.","Jon","Sep 08, 2002"
3.23,-12,3.5,3,3,3,4,"Pours golden amber in the glass. Nice sticky off-white head, doesn't hang around too long though. Sweet malt in the nose, light mouthfeel with more maltiness as the dominant feature here. Very light bitterness,with a slightly dry finish. Not as full-bodied/malty as I was expecting...I'm a bit underwhelmed with this, I remember it being a bit "bigger" in years past.","beerluvr","Sep 07, 2002"
4.15,13.1,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a deep orange color with a slightly foamy head and decent lace. Malt, fruit, spice, hops, and alcohol all in the nose and taste. Nicely balanced, very smooth, and highly drinkable. Very good, what you would expect from Sam Adams.","Lupe","Sep 06, 2002"
3.23,-12,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Pours a deep orange / amber color with a slightly foamy and sticky off-white head. On the nose the aroma of the noble hops comes through, hints of fruit and spice. Mouthfeel is slightly grainy, a bit sharp at first but settles down. On the palate the flavors consist of mild fruit, caramel, toasted malts, slight hop bitterness. Tastes a bit like a very, very light SA dobble bocknot really a good o'fest though, to many better ones out there. Still drinkable though.","WilliamPhilaPa","Sep 06, 2002"
2.16,-41.1,3,2,2,3,2,"My least favorite o-fest to date.  Actually, one of the least favorite beers I have had in a while.","cokes","Sep 06, 2002"
3.33,-9.3,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Reddish to light copper coloring, minimal white head. A balance of citrus-like hops and malty aromas in the nose. This balance remains evident in the taste, as neither hops nor malts takes the lead. I have to say that it's not quite as flavorful as the smell and appearance might lead you to believe, but nonetheless it's easy to drink and it did keep my interest (at least for one pint).","doerickson","Sep 04, 2002"
3.9,6.3,4,4,3.5,4,4.5,"2002 release. Orange-amber color and a white head with many large bubbles. Head stays well for a bit, but eventually goes down to a thin lace. Apparently this one needs a good hard pour to retain a head. Malty smell with some hop character and fruitiness. Lots of toasted malt flavor that is typical of Sam Adams beers. Sweet hop flavor that has just the right amount of bitterness, which seems to increase as you drink more. Lots of flavor here, but not quite as much as I would expect from a Sam Adams beer. Still a good brew in my opinion, and definitely worth trying.","hyuga","Sep 04, 2002"
3.86,5.2,4,3,4,4,4.5,"To my mind, this seems mellower than recent years. I find this a boon because I seem to remember my palate growing tired after one or two bottles from the previous batches. Perhaps something has been sacrificed, but overall I think it's a plus, at least in the drinkability department. Cushy head atop a crystal clear amber liquid, slight musty aroma. Tangy malts with just the right trace of spices to let you know you've got a Fest beer grasped tightly in your mitt. The taste profile goes through its cycle quickly, ending up with a photo finish containing faint echoes of the flavor, nice and gummy. Even though Sam has been troubled recently in the PR department, I'm enjoying their specialty beers (read: anything other than Boston Lager and Light) more than ever. Think I'll have a Cream Stout a little later on.","Thrasher","Sep 03, 2002"
4,9,4,4,4,4,4,"This is a fairly decent beer, and an OK way to celebrate the season, IMO. Rich copper/orange color with a creamy tan head. Subtle noble hop aromas, slightly spicy, with a little caramel and brown sugar. Taste is dominated by malt, but the hop presence is there to keep things balanced. A bit juicy. Slight alcohol spiciness in the finish. I'll have another, thank you.","mophie","Sep 03, 2002"
3.61,-1.6,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Moderate carbonation and frothy head that doesn't last too long but leaves some lace. Copper/orange color and more malt than hops in fact the hops are barely noticable. Nose has some fruitiness but it is barely noticeable. Finish is smooth with some sweetness but not cloying.","jdhilt","Sep 02, 2002"
3.68,0.3,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"This beer has grown on me year after year.  Medium head that quickly fades.  Burnt golden color.  Aroma could be more pronounced.  Malty, sweet, and satisfying.  Good balance with a soft, creamy finish.  Subtle bittering hops emerge at the end of a lingering aftertaste.  Good beer.","Suds","Aug 31, 2002"
3.35,-8.7,4,4,3,3.5,3,"This beer has a very nice deep clear copper hue.  A decent white head that is well retained.  Nice toasted malt aroma. Creamy mouthfeel with a body of about medium.  Taste is pretty average.   Subtle toasted tones.  Some maltiness.  Minimal bitterness.  Nothing really stands out with this one, but by no means will I be dumping this down the drain.","Bighuge","Aug 29, 2002"
4.15,13.1,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Sam Adams Octoberfest (2002): As deep orange a beer as you’ll ever see, with an off-white head with good retention and stickiness.   This beer has an aroma of pumpkin pie spices, and fresh bread.  Very pronounced malt flavor, with great spiciness.  The beer has a hint of alcohol warmth, and it carries through to the aftertaste. This beer has always meant fall to me, and this was very fresh.  But I’ve found through long experience that this beer ages very well.  Buy it now because it’ll be gone in October, but it’ll last till June.  Prosit!","jackndan","Aug 22, 2002"

3.76,2.5,4,3,4,4,4,"2001.  Very malty, as it should be.  The malt flavors are up front, sweetish, ripe and fruity, with an alcoholic flavor as well that leads into the firm hop bitterness.  Hops are present only towards the end, lacking any flowery flavors in the nose, but definately accomplish what they're in there for: cutting through the slightly syrupy body for a decent finish.  Nice for those early fall cool spells.","bcm119","Sep 25, 2001"
