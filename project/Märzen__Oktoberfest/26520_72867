Very bright gold, not sure I'd qualify it as copper. Nice head though. Importantly, the basics have been attended to. Malted Munich dominates a sweet aroma; no nuttiness, no pine, just malt.  Crisp and soft body. Emphasis on the aged and thrashed flavor of wheat. Smells much much sweeter than actual taste, which is given balance by some Noble hops, herbal, and medicinal flavors.","orcrist_cleaver","Sep 19, 2014"

3.93,5.4,3.75,3.75,4,4,4,"The beer pours a fiery caramel color, moving between amber and red tones. It pours with a lovely head of medium sized, lightly yellowed, slightly rocky bubbles that sit at a half fingerâs width and slowly fizzle away. The head leaves a negligible lacing on the sides of the glass. In body the beer is lager-clean but darker, with a lazy stream of bubbles working to the top of the beer, and no particles present (just as there shouldnât be in this style). On the nose, the beer smells spicy with a beautiful caramel malt blanket on the back of the smell. The caramel is layered and sweet, gracing the nose with just a touch of maple syrup and biscuit notes, and the hops are properly noble with a strong spice character, alongside fresh cut grass notes. The malt is the bigger player in the nose, however. On the tongue, the beer tastes mellow, with light bitters and sweetness which give way to a nice dry finish and only the slightest hint of acidity. In flavor, the beer tastes remarkably similar to several ESBâs Iâve had. The flavor begins as sweet caramel malt with a touch of apple juice, this moves into sweet bread, and then quickly to stale bread, and then bitter, herbal hops with just a touch of residual sweetness from the malt. Toffee notes also dance across the middle of the palate. The finish is dry, but is a nice blend of the malt and hops. In the mouth the beer feels medium in body, with a light, syrupy mouthfeel and softer carbonation that gives a quick bite and then caresses the tongue with velvet. The mouth is left dry except for a very faint trail of saliva, though it is by no means bone-dry. Overall this is a great beer to drink a lot of, itâs not too sweet, itâs not too bitter, and sits on the palate nicely with enough flavor to make you want another sip, but not enough to fill you up, etcâ¦ This is a good drinking beer, and would work very well in an Oktoberfest environment.","Maxwell","Aug 27, 2013"

4.25,13.9,4.5,3.75,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Nicely rounded, pleasant representative of the style, but a bit short on malt and spice, compared to the original. Tastes clean, fresh and dry--and, given the blend of ingredients, likely to hold up under moderate aging. Stunning color, even for beers that are normally copper/orange/dark amber, immediately evoking the season (despite the fact that's it's still virtually middle of summer). Pleasant, sessionable beer that may win over more than a few cross-over drinkers, although the price is clearly a deterrent (the 4-pack costs nearly as much as a Samuel Adams 12-pack). Would drink more of it, budget permitting--and share with as many people as I can. Not as heavy or as flavorful as some other Marzen, but will do nicely for any Oktoberfest gathering.","VictorWisc","Aug 23, 2013"

4.18,12.1,4,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Pouring it into the mug, it appears as an earthy orange with a humongous frothy head, light cream in color. Huge maltiness on the nose â pie crust and barley soup. Taste is reminiscent of burnt crackers, bread crust and porridge. This is a terrific showcase of the malts used. Itâs rich, earthy and tastes of iron. The mouthfeel is wonderfully crisp. Jackâs Abby knows lagers. The depth is not huge, but the flavors that are there are wonderfully tied together and makes for a great Oktoberfest beer.","greenmtn1111","Aug 16, 2013"

The taste delivers every bit of the sweetness that the nose promised with notes of fruit and maple. This is countered by earthy grains and dry lager yeast.

4.5,20.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: I'm very picky when it comes to Octoberfest lagers, especially American-made ones. Many brewers just use them as a token seasonal offering and don't even bother to stay true to style. They just brew some crappy, half-baked amber beer, often using an ale yeast to keep things more economical. The result is a market flooded with a whole lot of half-assed "Octoberfest" beers lacking character and substance. I'm happy to report that this is not one of those beers. Jack's Abby brews lagers exclusively, and boy did they nail this one. Copper Legend has to be the most authentic tasting American-made Octoberfest lager I've ever had. Ridiculously good, and highly quaffable. Give me some radishes and bratwurst and I'm in heaven. Jack's Abby. So hot right now.","ryan1788a5","Sep 15, 2012"

I expected Jack's Abby to get this style right, of all styles, because after all, German beers are their focus. And they did get it right. This is a great beer.

Head eventually settles into a fairly consistent skim; some spots of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose is somewhat subdued - light malts and perhaps a trace of diacetyl. Taste follows nose - definitely has festbier qualities in the flavor profile, but nothing really dominates. Some toasted notes, a hint of caramel sweetness a little skunk and a fairly clean finish.
