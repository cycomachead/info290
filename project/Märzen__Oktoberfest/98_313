AROMA: toasted malts compliment the cold rain outside; some bread, but the flowery hops round the malts to a more balanced fest than expected... PALATE: reasonably smooth and pleasant to drink; a bit chewy for a fest--an attribute of differentiation ...TASTE: malts are more sugary than what the aroma suggests; a bit of caramel and oats late; hops are balancing and lightly floral...OVERALL: stands out from other fests by performing a pleasant balancing act...","dacrza1","Sep 20, 2014"

3.66,-0.3,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.75,"The Crack revealed a brimful CAN and the inverted Glug almost overflowed my special CAN-shaped glass until I backed off and let it settle. Color was a deep-copper (SRM = > 22, < 27) with button-bright clarity. The head settled into two fingers of dense, rocky, tawny foam with good retention. Nose had a caramel maltiness which struck me as being a bit sweeter than I like. Some nice, sticky lacing began to appear as I patiently waited. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, approaching a creaminess on the tongue. The taste seemed kind of odd for the style - slightly minty with an underlying nuttiness. It was not bad, per se, but kind of unexpected. Finish was semi-sweet and nothing like I remember most oktoberfests/marzens, but not bad.","woodychandler","Dec 04, 2013"

Popping the top I get a very sweet waft of malts and grape-like olfactory inputs. The brew pours to a bright orange color with a nice large bubble head that has a creamy top. On the taste this brew is as sweet as it smells but not overly so. Typical of its style, there is not much if any bitterness present. The taste is consistent throughout with a solid syrupy mouthfeel and a very slight dry chalkiness in the the finish, that cleanses the palate of the bold sweetness. A very good beer, great for the style and quite sessionable.","mooseisloose","Oct 27, 2013"

3.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 12/19/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear orange copper color with a small 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of caramel, pear, apple, toast, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, molasses, and herbal hops. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity; fits the style very well. Taste of caramel, toast, brown sugar, toffee, pear, apple, biscuit, light nuttiness, floral, and herbal hops. Minimal bitterness on the finish as expected; with lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, toast, biscuit, toffee, light nuttiness, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Pretty nice flavor balance and complexity, but it was not as robust feeling as I was hoping from the aromas; zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with pretty much zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good Oktoberfest style. Nice flavor balance and complexity; and very smooth to drink as expected. Could have used a bit fuller flavor, but this was still a very good style representation. Definitely enjoyed this one.","superspak","Dec 08, 2012"

Better to pour: there's a slight metallic taste that goes away as the beers fizzes a little. Looks lovely in the glass - a golden amber, less deep in color than other examples of the style. It also has more hop character than is typical... pleasant though, backed well by the malt and just a little caramel. Nice feel. I recommend it.","angusdegraosta","Oct 07, 2012"

This beer didn't have good drinkability, it wasn't that smooth, and the thin flavors didn't do a good job at holding my attention, one is enough for me, I feel no need to have another one, What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance, it didn't look that bad and it was pretty true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the flavor it was pretty flat with some unneeded flavors and bitterness. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it really didn't have any redeeming quailitys and I wouldn't recommend this beer to anyone. All in all this was another beer I didn't like from Harpoon Brewery, so far they might be my least favorite Microbrewery and I don't know if I will give them another chance, this Marzen fell pretty short and it just wasn't a good example of the style.","StoutHunter","Oct 04, 2012"

The nose comprises light buttery biscuit, light orange zest, and a few drops of honey. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some light grass. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, this is the epitome of an average O-Fest.

Aromas are rich and malty, with nut and toffee highlights, and very light roast and cinnamon hints. Flavor is rich, with a roast and slightly bitter hops undertone. The rich malt characteristics of toffee and nut are creamy and smooth, with the sharp bitter and roast character helping to balance and cut the feel in the mouth. The afteratste is a bit of a tangy sweet, with a green spice flavor that cleans off the palate. The finish has a slight linger, but only the spicing really lasts for any time. Good flavors and decent balance throughout.","GarthDanielson","Oct 30, 2011"

The taste is pretty spot-on with the toasty, malty nuttiness, with just a bit of a hop kick. However, there's a lingering sweetness that I don't really welcome at all. The mouthfeel is about average, and the drinkability is impacted by the over-sweetened finish. Overall, not really worth buying over the slew of better Oktoberfests, both domestic and imported.","shand","Oct 03, 2011"

I personally like Hacker Pschorr the best, and I have a case sitting on the floor in my office right now. All this said, the Harpoon version is obviously intended to be an Oktoberfest, but it is falling short on the mouthfeel especially. It seems like their technique is close, but the water may need to be filtered and the grain bill tweaked to get them in. They would need to back off on the crystal and use more Munich malt for toasty notes and the color. Adding about 25% distilled water may be all they need too, to put this beer right in there. Regardless, this is a pretty decent attempt at an O-Fest.","SkeeterHawk","Oct 02, 2011"

3.48,-5.2,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"O: Harpoon has produced an Octoberfest beer which keeps in mind German tradition but also includes American tastes. It is a beauty to look at in the glass, and it certainly has a nice bit of malt. Though the beer is not over-hopped, it does have a bit more hop kick than might be necessary for a marzen style beer. While a slight hop edge does help balance, the star of a marzen style is supposed to be the malt. This is a nice beer, but if you are in search of the more malt dominated marzen style, you may be disappointed by the hop level in this one.","ianjsullivan","Sep 25, 2011"

Not sure why but it was kind of gross after mid bottle. Not sure how this can happen, perhaps a bad bottle... Either way it was a bit of a disappointment to me.

Nice brownish copper color to accentuate the dying colors of fall. Liquid is pretty opaque and doesn't produce much head or leave much of a trail. Taste is a bitter sweet. Mostly seems like pine hops and some roasted malts to give it a smoked maple syrup flavor.

The first whiff smells of toasted malt. Sweet malt and more layers of toasted barley are what this aroma is packing. The first sip reveals a "heavy" medium body. All that toasted malt from the aroma still comes through in the flavor.

The smell is mainly of sweet malt and a nice clean grain, with a bit of fleeting floral hops and citrus rind. The taste is of grain, some rye bread and a touch of herb and spice. The flavor is a bit hard to pinpoint, with mostly grain and bread flavors with some light caramel malt coming through and being followed up by some light pleasant hop flavor. It has a nice full mouthfeel as a result of the malt presence. One thing I noticed as the beer warmed was a bit of an off flavor, a bit of soap and some unpleasant pepper. The former could have been a result of a bad bottle. Overall it is a nice beer, excluding the off taste. It was a successful attempt at the traditional German style in terms of color and aroma, but the taste was a little lacking in my opinion. It is a sessionable beer, has some good fall taste like a very subtle pumpkin ale, but it needs to make up its mind about what style it is and stick to it.","Lldeegan","Nov 27, 2009"

The flavor follows with a much more earthy, peppery grain malt that bites the tongue with quite a bit of grassy hop and a hint of dry alcohol. Quite refreshing and drinkable leaving behind a little more of that raisin/prune kiss over caramel wheat and it's hard to lose that interesting banana touch. It's on the thin crisp side but appropriately for the style I think. This is pretty neat.

This tastes more like an ale or even an IPA than an oktoberfest brew. I expected roasted malt and little hops and got the complete opposite.

The apperance is a dark brown with a slight white, foamy head that stays pretty consistent throughout, leaving slight traces of lacing. The smell is sweet & malty. The taste is also predominantly of malts with a nice little kick to it. You can also sense a touch of barley and cinammon. This is a very easy to drink beer. I think it would be a good choice for those who don't love darker beers, but want to try something different for the fall/winter season.

Poured in to a Samuel Smith pint glass a copper color, with a large rocky white head. Smells Included chocolate malt, honey, cinnamon, toasted bread, and caramel. Taste had lots of chocolate and caramel, and also maintained that lager flavor in the background. Mouthfeel was on the heavy side, although for this style, was lighter than some of the others I have tasted. With that being said, that might be the reason that this is a pretty drinkable octoberfest. I am a little surprised that the site calls it a red ale, in that it tastes very much like a lager to me. Anyway, this is one of the best seasonal releases from Harpoon in my opinion. I will make a point of getting more of this brew once the weather gets a tad bit colder.

Yeah, I'm recommending that you let your SA Oct expire and sit a year before drinking!

In fact, it's as if this beer has taken on characteristics of different styles one after another. Crisp and airy with a light body like a kolsch with a fruity center and a clear taste of alcohol like a maibock with the roasted/sweet flavors and slightly chewy texture of an amber or brown ale.

Nice bready, caramelly aromas with a touch of hop spiciness. Intial flavors start off reaffirming what the nose held, but quickly disolves into a water brew, allowing a serious grainy bite to control.

Never saw a fall beer like this...categorzied as a red ale but a bit spicier than a typical red and darker and more pronounced than an amber. Mouthfeel could be a bit deeper and less watery, but this is not a bad Octoberfest by any stretch of the imagination. It's fairly typical, solid, and worth a shot. The Flying Fish Octoberfish has more of an identity to it, but this is a textbook example of what an Octoberfest should be.

Poured a dirty brown in color and was really thin looking. Flat without any head. Clean malty smell, but not much else going on. Flavor was slightly toasted malts but the flavor was really thin and watery. More of a lackluster ale than an O'fest. Heavy ale feeling and not crisp or the slight dry feeling of most O'fests. Even for its actual style the malts were kind of dull and spread thin.

The aroma was not all that spectacular, aromas of dark fruits, dark malt, some light hops were noticeable, an earthy presence, roasted malts seemed to dominate, but for some reason at the end of the nose it had a sweet perfumey feel to it. The tastes that flowed over my tongue were of light dark fruits, dark-rich malts, sharp hops, autumn leafs, bready yeast, and a touch of cocoa powder. It finished with an ashy-leafy feel on the pallet. The aftertaste that stayed in my mouth was rather light, it was split with roasted malts and some hops. It was light to medium in body. Not as thick as I would have thought. It was creamy and decent when it came to its blend of flavors.

On the nose the aroma of sweet toasted malts, grains, caramel, and a mild hop bitterness. Medium to full bodied; with decent carbonation and the mouth feel is mostly smooth. In the flavor the taste of caramel & toasted malts, grains, hints of some fruitiness, and a nice mild hop bitterness; well balanced. Overall a tasty brew, and enjoyable","WilliamPhilaPa","Feb 16, 2003"
4.07,10.9,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Clear, deep copper/russet in color with a firm bone-white head that drops shortly but maintains a decent collar and light surface covering throughout the glass. The aroma is fairly rich with gently sweet and lightly toasted malts (Vienna & Munich) and a mild hoppiness. Very nice. The body is medium with a fine, median carbonation that's gently zesty and lightly creamy in the mouth. The flavor is malty upfront (bready and toasty), reveals some fruitiness, and then some hop flavor (grassy, resiny) and a brisk hop bitterness that lingers in a long dry finish. Well-balanced with the rich maltiness giving way to an increasing perception of hop bitterness (and flavor) throughout the glass, giving it an exceptional drinkability. Two to three of these could easily be enjoyed in one evening. Very well done with a strong nod to the Vienna-style; but also very American in it's hoppiness.","NeroFiddled","Nov 10, 2002"
4.13,12.5,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"A good session beer (but not really to style as an Octoberfest).","RBorsato","Oct 25, 2002"
3.88,5.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Nice amber color- looks very malty, and it is.  I could definetely smell the sweetness upfront.  A well- balanced brew- obviously on the sweeter side, but with some bitterenss to keep it refreshing on the palate.  A little bit of a chewy mouthfeel, nice body.  Not a distinguishing Octoberfest, but very nice indeed.  (Also, the discription of the beer up on BA, says the style is a red ale- I believe this beer is really a lager?)","AaronRed","Oct 14, 2002"
3.5,-4.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear dark amber with decent tan head tha subsides quickly and leaves some minimal lace down the glass.  Biscuity maltiness in the nose with some slight caramel tones as well as a light hoppiness that is barely detectable.  Smooth maltiness opens the brew up but is then followed by a rough transition into a tangy, grapefruity hoppiness that doesn't seem to fit in well in the other flavors flavors of the brew.  Smooth and slightly cloying which brings down the mouthfeel.  The medium body of the brew and decent biscuity malt flavors make it fairly drinkable but I would rather go with some of the german ofests or the Brooklyn.","Murph","Oct 10, 2002"
3.73,1.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours with a beautiful rocky off-white head over rich deep amber liquid with some red highlights. There's lots of inviting sweet maltiness in the nose, along with toasted grain notes also. Taste is a nice bittersweet balance on the palate. Finishes up malty-sweet, drying slightly. A nice aftertaste lingers in the mouth. Hats off to Harpoon for this very easy to drink take on the O-Fest style.","beerluvr","Oct 06, 2002"
4,9,4,4,4,4,4,"A copper/red body is topped by a big beige head of micro-bubbles. Strong fruity nose with a straight malt chaser. Malty taste well balanced by a nice but not overpowering hop presence. Not too sweet, not too bitter.  Not a traditional marzen, but as a Oktoberfest inspired ale, quite pleasing.","RonfromJersey","Sep 30, 2002"

3.97,8.2,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Very smooth & malty, with just a bit of hop bitterness and a very good finishing hop spiciness. A tasty interpretation. The finish is a good malt/hop balance with a slight, pleasing lingering bitterness. A nice Fall seasonal, would be great to kick back on a Sunday with a twelve pack of these and toss a football around at halftime.","sponberg","Sep 28, 2002"
4.12,12.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Although not a Marzen, this is a very good fall beer, somewhere in the realm of red/pale ale. Well-retained head, red color, strong hop presence in aroma. Sweet malts veer towards Oktoberfest style but this is a bit different. Good hop presence (mildly spicy, floral attack) gives indication towards a pale ale style. Watery, smooth mouthfeel indicative of Irish red. A nice beer, refreshing and autumnal, almost smoky finish. No fest, but a fine fall seasonal. Harpoon's best beer even if it ain't what it says it is.","Thrasher","Sep 22, 2002"
3.65,-0.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Beautiful deep copper color.  Malty, hops present but not overpowering.  Thin mouthfeel.  Not a bad beer, but nothing special. After finishing a 12 pack, it's unlikely I'd buy it again since I was already getting bored with it.  Just nothing special about it.","LarryV","Sep 04, 2002"

2.91,-20.7,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"odd beer being an oktoberfest style ale. it has an awful lot of hops for and oktober, but it is not too much. i would just have to say that this is a very unique beer. the flavor and carbonation are intense following after the harpoon ipa i have sampled. strange and not something i would get again, but an alright beer","ElGuapo","Aug 30, 2002"
3.55,-3.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Brewed in the ale style with a lot of malty goodness to make it passable as an Oktoberfest. Harpoon typical hops are noticeable but not overpowering - a good thing. Not the easiest to drink since the sweetness kind of takes over, but still better than Sammy.","Longstaff","Aug 26, 2002"
4,9,4,4,4,4,4,"Having this in a proper Harpoon dimpled litre stein glass at the brewery is a real treat ... One of my favourite local Octoberfest beers on draught. Although, this is not a lager, thus not a true Marzen/Oktoberfest. It's a nice Amber Ale for a festive occassion.","Todd","Oct 12, 2001"

3.42,-6.8,5,3,3,4,4,"Looks great with its chunky head and deep orange color.  Nice clarity of its slightly sweet, grainy malt flavors, with a pretty clean mouthfeel.  It has some alcohol towards the finish, but the aftertaste is nice and toasty.  Hops give a slight herbal quality that blends in well with the grainy flavors.","bcm119","Oct 10, 2001"
