3.87,7.2,3.5,3.25,4.25,3.75,4,"Pours a deep brown with garnet red accents. 2 fingers of cream colored foam settled with no lacing in to a thin layer and attractive collar. There's a little bit of nutty aroma with some faint smoky accents. Some toasted bread. Not a lot happening in the nose. The taste brings some sweet toffee malts with a little buttery diacetyl. Traces of pecan nuttiness and a little bit of mineral water flourish in the flavor. Scant bitterness with a slightly drying finish and touch of roast. The flavors are all pretty subtle, but artfully constructed. The mouthfeel is medium-full with mild carbonation. This entire beer exhibits great balance. With the moderate ABV and pleasant yet gentle flavors, this would make a spectacular session beer. I am typically not a fan of the brown ales that I've sampled from throughout the United States, but this one got my attention. Simple, tasty and uncontroversial. Many American browns have gone too far with the hops, and in my humble opinion, it takes away from what makes them delicious. It's good to see another East Coast brewery that puts the Carolinas on the map.","JohnnyI","Dec 28, 2014"
