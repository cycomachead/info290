3.79,5.6,3.75,3.5,4,3.75,3.75,"Enjoyed from the 12 oz bottle in a snifter, this excellent example of a brown ale pours a clear perfect reddish brown with a thick creamy off white head and moderate lacing.  Nose o roasted malts and a dash of herbal hops.  Flavors are nutty malt goodness, sweet caramel malts, light toffee, and a dash of light herbal hops on the back that makes this a rather easily quaffable brew.  Moderate carbonation, and a solid improvement with warmth.  Not overly sweet, this is a solid example and an excellent brew to pair with a spicy meal.  Very nice.","Brutaltruth","Jan 03, 2015"

Taste is light, with malt, light almond and a considerable amount of sweetness. Overall, a light brown ale with not a lot of bold flavors or components...","hophugger","Dec 15, 2014"

2.75,-23.4,,,,,,"I prefer browns less sweet than this one by Bluegrass. It was difficult to detect nuttiness apart from slightly resembling a marzen's character; and although carbonation held, I couldn't keep from wondering what it would be like to find sweetness in the aftertaste, not at the front.  Like the M&M standby "melt in your mouth -- not in your hand!" I wanted the sweetness to find me not smack me at the onset practically before I'd raised my hand-held beverage to sip!","A_Frayed_Knot","Nov 02, 2014"

3.46,-3.6,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,"This is just a nice brown ale.  Color is a murky brown with decent enough head retention.  Both the smell and taste are what you'd expect - very mild with caramel malt dominating.  Very low bitterness.  Smooth on the palate with a very sweet finish.  If you're looking for a nice brown ale this one is worth a try.","Retroman40","Sep 19, 2014"
