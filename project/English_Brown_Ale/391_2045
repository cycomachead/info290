The more I think about it, I'm positive that is the case. I'm reviewing this based on my most recent tasting (during the intermission of the Best of Banff Film Festival), along with distinct palate memory. Trad is far from the best brown ale you can buy. It pours nicely, smells like yeast and malt, and has a lovely Caramilk and walnut flavour to it. It's the granddaddy of Alberta craft beer and still a solid choice, 30 years later.","Bunman3","Dec 02, 2014"
