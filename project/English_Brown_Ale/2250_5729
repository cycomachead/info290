4,11.7,4,4,4,4,4,"It's a nicely balanced beer that's not complicated, but still interesting enough; and which offers enough richness to leave it satisfying without becoming 'too much'. Given the price ($1.17 single bottle) it's hard to beat as an occasional semi-sweet dark ale.","NeroFiddled","Dec 28, 2014"

3.5,-2.2,,,,,,"Dark brown, with relatively small head. Caramely malt smell. Taste and mouthfeel is smooth (albeit not as smooth as a Velvet Merlin) but also roasty. Has kind of a "rusty" quality to it. Pleasant, but I'd opt for a Velvet Merlin, if it's at the local Trader Joe's, instead, for an extra couple of dollars per six-pack.","shleepy","Oct 19, 2014"
3.7,3.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.75,"O: enjoyable and economical dark ale that straddles the brown ale / light porter categories.  Improved with warming.","chinchill","Oct 14, 2014"

3.52,-1.7,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O: Easy to drink and enjoyable, kind of a hybrid between an English Brown Ale and an English Porter but one that I found to be mostly successful. Could easily have a couple of these in a session.","dbrauneis","Oct 04, 2014"
