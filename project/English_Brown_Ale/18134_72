2.71,-21.7,3,3.25,2.25,2.5,3,"Clear brown with an orange/reddish hue and a thin skim of a cap -- mostly just a collar around the glass. Sweet aroma, nutty and brown sugar, bread and biscuit. The flavour was thin, bitterness was higher and more aggressive than the malt could balance. Notes of grass and mint. Light bodied, moderate carbonation, a bit coarse. Not something I'll go in search of, but not all bad.","DrJay","Sep 28, 2013"
