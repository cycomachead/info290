3.25,-13.3,3.75,3,3,4,3.5,"Bought from Table & Vine in West Springfield, MA. From the Goose Island Flight Pack. Served in a glass goblet. The beer poured with a dark brown appearance, a light-colored brown head, and with minimal lacing. A good breath of air gives you the smell of malts mixed with caramel with an almost herb-like hint near the end. The drink had a toasted nuts, coffee, and cocoa taste with a bitter flavor at the end of each sip. The beer was slightly creamy with a medium carbonation making it surprisingly refreshing. Overall, not too bad.","fitzy84","Feb 07, 2015"

4.22,12.5,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 4/12/2012. Pours slightly hazy reddish brown color with a nice 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, chocolate, toast, toffee, nuttiness, dark bread, brown sugar, floral, and slight dark fruitiness. Excellent aromas with great complexity and balance of dark malt notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, chocolate, toffee, brown bread, nuttiness, toast, brown sugar, floral, and slight dark fruits. Lingering notes of caramel, chocolate, toffee, brown bread, nuttiness, brown sugar, toast, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and robustness of dark malt flavors; with good complexity and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent brown ale! Great balance and robustness of dark malt flavors; with a great mouthfeel and smooth drinking. A highly enjoyable offering; one of the best brown ales I have had.","superspak","Apr 02, 2013"

Taste of toasted grains, light caramel, cocoa powder, earth, leading to an uncomfortable metallic twinge that turned to chalk in my mouth. Not bad at first, but just really turned bland and almost sour quickly. It's no secret that I'm not a fan of brown ales, and this one wasn't among the better I've had.

The beer is a very good but brown, but what keeps it from being great is its thickness. It is smooth enough, but when I think nut brown ale, I want that stick to your mouth thickness and this is a little thin in that regard. However the flavor, aromas, and color of this ale are dead on and it's a very very good brew without question. A brew every brown ale fanatic should have.

Clear brown colored liquid, soft orange tint and then yellow further towards the rims, good amount of active tiny bubbles which are widely dispersed. Extremely sweet nose of caramel, chocolate, toffee and creamed coffee, notes of candied nuts, there are some cereal grains and scone in there but nothing offered which could stiffen the feel and counterbalance the sugary aspects. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is finely grained so to speak but does stir things about the mouth. Here you get more bread, yeast, nuts and anise to temper the excesses of the chocolate, caramel, coffee. Hint of orange peel, does not produce any metallic nor roasted notes nor anything remotely herbaceous. While the mouthfeel is soft there is a general cleanliness to it, minimal residue at the end. In many regards simple, but better put as pure of purpose. Nothing more needs be said.","farrago","Jul 20, 2012"

A nice inch of loosely coiled tan foam goes up and than down leaving small spots. Smell has a weird hay scent to it on first sniffs, but more investigation I pick out light melted chocolate, nutty appeal, some caramel scent with some earthy hops. Light yet to the point. Taste is well balanced with the malt mixing in with light nuts minus the salt. Some cocco powder taste along with light tootsie roll and faint roast. Nicely rounded again. Feel is very smooth with low carb and no bitterness, body is less than medium and easy sipper. All in all, it's a simple style without nuts and bolts, and this is a good representation of it.

Imagine the taste of a light molasses mixed with a bit milk chocolate and roasted grain, and you've got a good idea of what this Nut Brown Ale is all about. I wouldn't describe the mouthfeel as being particularly watery, but it's far from being creamy either. There exists a good balance here. It's a good beer. It's a brown ale that will not disappoint.

There are also some aromas of caramel, toffee, and there is just a little bit of hop presence poking through. The taste starts off with a nice toasted malt and hazelnut flavor. There are some caramel and toffee flavors present as well. Also, there is a little bit of hop flavor coming through, not much, but it's there. The finish leaves some lingering nutty flavors on the palate. This has medium body, that is a little on the light side, and good carbonation. It goes down easy and has a really creamy feel to it. There is some sweetness here, not much else. This has good drinkability. It is really easy to drink, and has a low ABV and creamy feel.

This beer is full for a brown (ie no wateriness that is usually an unfortunate staple of the style) yet still simple and drinkable. Crisp and bubbly mouthfeel and easily drinkable.

There are plenty of dark malts, roasted notes, some nutty flavors but nothing too assertive in that department, very sweet chocolate, and a honeyed sweetness, probably from dextrin added. Things tighten up a bit in the finish, but overall this is a too sweet nut brown ale, with some nice caramel and toffee notes, but not enough nutty flavors, and too much of the cloying sweetness.

Poured into standard pint glasses. Dark brown color with just a hint of ruby red towards the center. Very nice sized white head. Not a lot of lacing. Smell reminded me of slightly burnt coffee beans. Taste was very pleasing. Very malty, with a hint of vanilla and honey in the background. Slight chocolate aftertaste. The mouthfeel is what I have been craving from other brown ales. Some heartiness is exactly what I like to have in this type of beer, and GI delivers. Borderline almost as thick as a porter.

It was a dark amber brown color that looked great in the pint glass. The smell wasnt strong, but what there was there was a nice roasted malt smell and strong nut flavor. I picked up a little spice too with what seemed like was almost a hint of orange. The taste was a fresh nutty flavor with a nice finish of toasted malts. It went down smooth with plenty of carbonation, but seemed a bit little too thin. It was a great beer to drink overall, perfect for a cold winter day.

The Pale and the IPA were great, so I figured the brown (one of my favorite styles) would be a winner. I was right. Easily one of the best of the style I've ever had--at least in a bottle. Gorgeous, deep brown in the glass with ruby highlights; a thick tan head that nearly flowed over the top and laced nicely all the way down. Roasted malt in the nose and the same in the initial taste, coupled with a touch of sweet and a hint of coffee. Dry in the finish (though not bitter, as I expected) and really very drinkable.

I think some one who doesn't necessarily like beer would have to enjoy this. I would say this is a nice beer to look forward to in a multi-pack but I wouldn't actually go out and by a six-pack of it.

It poured out brown with slightly red highlights. What little head there was quickly fizzled away. It smelled mostly of nutty malt with underlying caramel. As it warmed the caramel moved forward and swirling it brought out a hint of dates and other dark fruit. The flavor matched with nuts, caramel, and malt - though not with any great complexity.

This brings the drinkability down a hair. Very English interpretation of the style, right down to the estery yeast. This would make a great candidate for the hand pump.

Slight drying in the aftertaste, english hop bitterness is assertve but fairly balanced. The medium body and carbonation give it a smooth, malty mouthfeel that is devoid of diacetyl but not overly dry; and is properly dried by a fresh hop presence.

Immediately I notice a smell of chocolate and perhaps hazelnut. Tastes pretty good, slightly too heavy to drink too much of, but definately a nice beer to drink to enjoy the taste rather than the effects of the alcohol.

The head held fast for some time as I examined the properties of appearance. The nose was not overly aromatic, but it held some subtle and pleasant scents of chocolate and musty nuttiness. The taste was very mild and soothing as I find most brown ales to be. Chocolate and caramel tones were notable as proclaimed on the label. Soft hints of brown sugar and overtones of graininess filled the air as well. There was also an oily nut character that combined well with the other flavours. The mouthfeel was fluffy and creamy with just the right amount of carbonation and oily slickness. Very drinkable. A great beer.","SupaCelt","Dec 06, 2005"

Aromas were light and hard to detect, but traces of caramel and sweet malts were detected. Taste was better than mass produced brown ales (New Castle), but lacked character and depth; flavors of lightly roasted nuts, medium bodied malts and mild herbs and watery coffee seemed to be the extent of what I could make out.

But when I wasn't looking it hit me with the flavor of a very creamy choco-mochachino ice cream. The mouthfeel was very slick and creamy. Light on the pallette with little carbination.

This then transitions into a really pleasing malty sweet chocolate. Some molasses. Im not picking up on any hop bitter or floral qualities. Also, no alcohol to taste either.

Interestingly enough this beer is not nearly as roasty in character as the aroma suggested, it has a bit of lightly toasted graininess to it, and a hint of roasted grain husks, but these are far from being dominant characteristics of this beer.

Laces in a spotty fashion as the beer was consumed. The potency of the nose is very modest, a little too much so in my opinion, hard whiffs invokes toasty malts and toasty caramel notes and grain, hints of chocolate. The aromas are indicative of a Brown Ale yet I am not pressed to drink it. The palate doesnt have much going on, this is said as a fan of both Brown Ales and Goose Island. Frankly Hex Nut is a bit of a disappointment. The maltiness is small, there isnt a richness in the taste, some disjointed sweetness, the toastiness is faint and there is little in the way of caramel influences, traces of nuts conclude this portion of the beverage. The hops are modest, appropriately so but the flavor they impart are ordinary. Pleasantly dry throughout. This is easy drinking but I can do better when I have the urge to drink a Brown Ale, like Third Stone for instance. Medium in body, low, modest carbonation, maybe a little too much so, the mouthfeel is a touch slick and it is lacking in substance. The aftertaste is lightly nutty and sweet.

It was fairly balanced, it wasn't overwhelmingly hoppy, malty, or sweet. It was what a brown ale should taste like. It was clear, maybe a bit light in color. I liked it. It's low abv makes it an easy drink.","Reneejane","Jan 18, 2004"
2.99,-20.3,3.5,2,3,3,4,"Here's a decent brown ale from Goose Island. Good dark caramel/red color, no head to speak of, no lacing. Nice refreshing taste, not overbearing at all. Much of what you'd expect from a brown ale. It's like Newcastle but not as spicy. I'd give it a shot, but don't expect to be blown away. You could easily drink this all night.","benmiliron","Jan 06, 2004"
3.29,-12.3,3,4,3,2.5,3.5,"This one poured a watery copper color with a nice sized white head. The smell was a nice combination of nuts, caramel, and toastiness. But the flavor was weak. It tasted watered down and too shallow in complexity for my liking. Water was the main flavor here followed by slight malt which included caramel and other weak flavors. This does go down easy but I feel they made this to suffice the public when they could have stepped it up a notch if they wanted to. That's fine, but I just feel it had to potential of being better.","granger10","Jan 03, 2004"

4.77,27.2,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"This is the best american brown ale I have ever had. And the reason I think it is so good is that it is very similar to an altbier. Nice tannish head on a dark brownish black body. Nutty aromas mix in with flowery hop aromas. Sweet malt is nutty in flavor and slick in mouthfeel and the hops are bitter enough to balance and give it a quick dry ending. This is more of an altbier than their sticke altbier. I could drink this all night long without changing to another style.","Longstaff","Oct 20, 2003"

3.8,1.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Just like the label says, this one is brown and really rather nutty. Good patchwork of retained lace throughout. The beer is alll about nuttiness as is picked up immediately on the nose. In the mouth a pronounced sweet, oily, and even a tad savory roasted peanut flavor chimes in. The sensation is like that of eating a Resess peanut butter cup-sweet, then chocolatey, then salty, then roasted aftertaste sensations. Another session styled offering from goose, and a decent nut to bust for cool weather season here in the city.","moulefrite","Oct 16, 2003"
4.14,10.4,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Deep brown and very clear. A slight malty aroma is basked in the glow of bittersweet chocolate. Light to medium-bodied brew but a bit thin and lacking in depth. Bready, cookie-like malt flavor and feel. A roasted presence on the tongue becomes the outstanding feature through the carmelized and burnt sugar finish. Minus its roasty, chocolatey character, this brew is a bit "normal." As it is, it's a highly drinkable ale with a little bit of unique character.","marburg","Oct 07, 2003"

It pours a cloudy brown color with a small, but thick head and leaves a tiny bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma was very sweet and nutty. The flavor was very much the same with a nice maltiness to finish it up. The malty/nuttiness sticks with you in the aftertaste for a great finish. I would have this one again.","clvand0","Aug 13, 2003"
3.68,-1.9,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"Goose Island brews represent some of the best values in microbrews today. They are rarely exceptional, but pretty solid overall and not expensive. This brew pours a dark, tawny brown with virtually no head. The aroma doesn't leap out at you but there's some definite maltiness and faint roasted grain. The taste is malt dominated with toffee, a bit of cafe latte and a finish of roasted grain/barley flavor. A good, easy-drinking food-friendly brew, although it seems a bit thin and watery.","johnrobe","Jul 11, 2003"
3.98,6.1,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a dark brown with copper highlights, topped by a tan head that is relatively thick and fades to a malty film of foam. Nice caramel and a slightly nutty aroma, perhaps a hint of choclate along with the light hoppiness. The taste is nice and malty, with a very nice nutty finish. The light sweetness is balanced well by the bitter hops on the finish. Chocolate covered caramel flavors intertwine with the nut and slightly roasted malt flavors. This is a well balanced and slightly complex beer, which makes it enjoyable. The mouthfeel is smooth with enough carbonation to lighten the presence on the palate. Drinakbility is very good, as this would be a great session beer. Finishes almost neutral, with just a slight lingering hops and nut aftertaste. This has got to be one of the better browns available. None better come to mind at the moment. (maybe Avery's Ellie's Brown). For $6 a sixer, this will be hard to beat. I will buy a bit more on my next trip towards the heartland.","aaronh","Jul 05, 2003"
4,6.7,4,4,4,4,4,"The epitome of a 4.0 beer. In every category it is above average, just not much above average. THe appearance is dark amber with a malty, nutty aroma. The flavor is typical of a brown ale, light nutty and better when not too cold. The only hoppy flavors come out when this is just colder than room temp. I recommend decanting and leaving for at least a half hour. Then the flavor is nutty and warming to the throat. very enjoyable with good drinkability. For the money, this is a tough beer to beat.","Jables","Jun 10, 2003"
3.92,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Hex Nut Brown Ale is dark reddish brown in appearance with minimal head and lacing. Moderately sweet and earthy in flavor at first, with a slightly astringent, medium bodied mouthfeel and then somewhat bitter finish. Hoppy aroma and delicious flavor, but not exactly what I expected from a nut brown ale. In my opinion Hex Nut Brown Ale is more like a stout in many ways. It's far roastier and hoppier than say Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale. To me Hex Nut Brown Ale seems a little unusual for the style, but it's still very good. I hope to try more offerings from Goose Island soon.","bobinverted","Jun 07, 2003"

3.92,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"A really deep dark mahogany brew that is just great in initial appearance. Nice tan head that fades far too quickly and leaves only faint traces of lace. Strong nose has delicate malt notes and, perhaps, just a hint of hops. The body is medium to light and a bit watery. Flavors come across as a sweet start with a mildly bitter ending in the front that lingers for an instant then disappears leaving behind a very dry finish. Very drinkable ale.","AtLagerHeads","Apr 28, 2003"

Aroma city with this stuff, excellent coffee tone with a strong nut and caramel roastyness. The smell of this stuff was sooo gooood. Tastes just as wonderful as it smells echoing all the aromas with superb balance of sweet caramel malt, hazelnut, some chestnut & pecan maybe, with cocoa and vanilla like notes. Smooth medium body and solid nutty hold on the tongue and mouth. Drinkable, you bet! Very drinkable, very good, very flavored. Great googlymoogly Goose Island has done a great job on this brew.","tavernjef","Mar 17, 2003"
4,6.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Clear mohagony hue. Thin, creamy light brown head recedes to a collar in about a minute. Lacing is spotty at best. Nice little roasted nut/vanilla bean/coffee nose. The taste is very pleasant. Some underlying cocoa accentuates the roasted qualities nicely. Mix in a little hop bitterness and flavor, and this is not too bad. One of my favorite brown ales. The carbonation is just right to provide a creamy mouthfeel. Body is medium full and the overall drinkability of this brew lends itself to a nice session beer.","Bighuge","Feb 25, 2003"

Darker than I had anticipated. Smelled of rich malt with some toastiness. The finest and bare minimum of lacing, surrendering everywhere but the very edges of my pint glass. Taste has the nutty quality, but also an equally partnering chocolate-malt/light roast tang - a bit unique. Nice craft brew.","Hobbz","Feb 14, 2003"

Lightly bodied, w/ an agreeable mouthfeel that adds to the drinkability.  Slight chocolate and biscuit malt flavors are most noticeable, since hop bitterness and flavor is quite mild. Very clean overall, with nothing outstanding or offensive in taste.  Finishes with slight caramel sweetness.  Hex Nut is innocuous, drinkable, but perhaps a bit bland.
