4.25,12.1,,,,,,"Light chocolate, caramel, toast and a hint of plum on the nose. Pours brilliant brown under a 1‚Äù off-white foam cap with a slight brown tint. The palate follows the nose with traces of nuts and chocolate over lightly toasted grain and bright fruit. A semi-sweet beginning leads to a drying finish. Very creamy with slightly above average carbonation and a medium body.","pat61","Sep 02, 2014"
