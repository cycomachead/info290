3.34,-4,4,3,3.5,2.75,3.5,"Dark brown pour with thin tan head, color is excellent. Smell is mild malt and slightly nutty. Taste is also a bit underwhelming with a sweetness that quickly fades to a clean nut finish. Only real nit is it seems a bit overcarbonated. Otherwise very drinkable in quantity!","tekstr1der","Dec 11, 2014"
