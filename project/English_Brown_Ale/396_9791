4.31,8.3,4,4.25,4.5,4,4.25,"This beer really surprised me.  I rarely drink a nut brown ale so I had this beer as part of a flight of 4 ounce tasters.  It looks spot on for an English Ale and has a good nutty smell.  The taste was the best I've ever had for the style.  It was nutty and malty in perfect balance.  A nice smooth finish and goes down really easily.","ELS","Mar 16, 2015"

3.72,-6.5,4.25,4,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Dark mahogany with large tan head. Nutty, bready malt aroma. Light and slightly creamy with the same nutty malt taste you'd expect from the smell.  Could use a little more bite in the aftertaste, but very nice overall.","thebeers","Jan 18, 2015"

Let it warm and you'll find that the smooth cocoa is perfectly integrated into the beer.  Mouth was creamy and smooth. Not the best brown ale I've ever had but up there. It's available and decently cheap. Homerun.","pjkelley82","Jan 08, 2015"
