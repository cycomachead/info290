4.13,9.3,4,4,4.25,3.75,4.25,"Overall, we are thankful to have this recommended to us by Benjamin at The Brick Oven Bistro in Sandusky, Ohio.  We had the pleasure of speaking to him a week or so back, and he was able to offer us some of the premier beverages available in central to western Ohio.  This was among the top on his list, and we are very happy to have tried it.  The nose is incredibly sweet and rich, akin to the liking of Southern Tier’s Crème Brule, but to a slightly more subdued extent.  The flavoring, on the other hand, showed a much more bittered, and even smoky approach, allowing for a serious side to this brown ale that was otherwise not yet appreciated.  This is an exciting beer for a small brewery, and it leaves us wishing they had wider distribution to keep us warm through the winter months.","TheBrewo","Sep 21, 2014"

4.62,22.2,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.25,"Hoo hah! The Crack! awoke Kong King Chomolungma with its loudness, setting off an avalanche in which we hid in the same crevasse to escape its wrath. Ol' Boy was looking at me with all four of his eyes until I inverted him and began a heavy-handed Glug. It didn't help matter that he was another craft brimful CAN, but I got him upturned all the same. The pseudo-cascade was quick to subside, creating a dense finger of light-tan head as its result. Color was a deep, dark-brown (SRM = 44), allowing only minimal light penetration at the edges. Nose smelled of dark chocolate, roasted peanuts, fudge. It reminded me of my late-Pops' favorite ice cream - Rocky Road! Mouthfeel was big, full, and creamy and the flavors melded together so nicely that it could have been Rocky Road or a liquified Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, but either way, it was totally evocative of my late Old Man. He really got sent by the chocolate/peanut butter combo and went for Tastykake Peanut Butter TandyTakes as well. Chomolungma was not really happy with the way I was describing him, so I began to back away and make my way up and out of the crevasse. The finish left me with notes of leather, smoke and more of that choco-nut flavor that had been its trademark throughout. No wonder Jackie O's has the solid, stellar rep that they do, if this is indicative of their beers. I am a self-avowed hophead and yet, I REALLY want more of this one, especially on Saturday, 01 Feb, for the annual Hula in the Coola Day!","woodychandler","Jan 27, 2014"

Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, chocolate, toast, toffee, brown bread, honey, nuttiness, raisin, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and honey notes with light hops; and good strength. Taste of big chocolate, caramel, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, toast, honey, nuttiness, light roast, raisin, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, toast, honey, nuttiness, raisin, light roast, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt and honey flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming present after the finish.

4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Jackie O's nails this brown ale, it hits the brown ale right in every direction not typically huge on brown ales this however is excellence in a can. Beautiful nearly black but it let's enough light to create a crimson mahogany, light tan head velvet textured fine even lacing. Aroma explodes when you open the can, toasted nuts with creamy chocolate notes, hint of honey and cereal grains it's good enough to put your nose in the glass. Flavor wise so smooth, perfect cohesion no clash of off flavors, this is complex brown ale at it's best with a nutty caramelized sugar from the toasted malts, the wildflower honey is full fermented out no residual sweetness you find in most honey beers, this is a flagship beer for a reason. It goes great with a Romeo y Julieta Reserva I'm smokin' adding cedar and spicy Republica de Domincana tobacco to the mix. I can't help but enjoy every sip, earthy hops finish the taste leaving a balanced brown ale on the table. Smooth even keeled carbonation cleanses the palate, medium bodied brown with enough abv too give it more complexity on the palate at 6.5%. Overall an anytime beer, that I'm proud to buy local in Steubenville Ohio at Valley Wine Cellar beer drinkers keep this stuff moving off the shelves maybe we will catch an expansion of their brewing operations to see some of their sours move into mainstream distribution, I'm still planning on a pilgrimage to the brewery maybe next weekend...there is a bottle release.","WVbeergeek","Aug 11, 2013"
3.74,-1.1,4,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"The feel is balanced in a medium body verging light as a tea-like note tames it down. It's got crispness and creaminess in moderation, a little thin and herbal in the end.","Brenden","Beers"
3.85,1.9,4.5,3.25,4,4,4,"Overall - Nice light brown ale. Not overly strong flavors, but smooth, balanced and easy to drink. Nice hop flavor at the finish, works well with the nutty malts and caramels. Worth a drink for brown ale fans.","wvsabbath","0"

Aroma is nice and nutty, the brew also smells like toasted malt, bittersweet chocolate and honey. It tastes like nuts, toasted malt, wood, honey, coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and a bit of dark fruit. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and smooth with a good amount of carbonation. It's one of the better brown ales I've had, glad I bought a sixer of this! $8.99 a 6-pack.","bluejacket74","Jun 19, 2013"

This isn't to say it was bad, it seemed more smooth or velvety than other brown ales I've had. The taste was great, probably the best brown ale I've had so far.
