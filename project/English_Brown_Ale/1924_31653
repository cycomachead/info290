4.45,25.4,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.5,"Pours much darker than I expected. Beautiful reddish highlights when held up to light. Very smooth mouth feel with  tastes of toffee, carmel and nuts. Dries to a very light hops finish. Very easy to drink and one of the great brown ales.","MarkLinton1","Feb 20, 2015"
3.94,11,4,3.75,4,4,4,"Poured an amber brown with a thick light brown, creamy head that lasts a while and leaves no lacing. Smells warm and of toffee, malt and some roasted nuts. Taste is great with the toffee coming through at first then the roasted nuts and some hint of hops to a finish that doesn't linger. Very smooth and light feel. Overall great beer.","Mrbseward","Feb 17, 2015"
3.93,10.7,3.75,3.75,4,4,4,"Even for those who normally avoid dark beers, I think they might still find this accessible. It's remarkably easy to drink, and for those who are looking for a little more flavor in their beer, it's still here. Nicely done.","NeroFiddled","Feb 09, 2015"
