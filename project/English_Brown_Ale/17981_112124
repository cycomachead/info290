3.79,-2.3,3.25,3.5,4,4,3.75,"Final Thoughts: The drier aspects of this beer, really lend it towards fish or moist rich chocolate deserts. I think the picture on this beer really speaks volumes to what it is. I would want to drink it at the same that I would want to have a cigar, typically in the twilight hours after dinner, or during a hot day by the pool. I've been so far pleased with everything Cigar City has offered.","TheHammer",
