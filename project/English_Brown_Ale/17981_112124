3.9,0.5,3.25,4.5,4,2.75,3.75,"On sight, Cigar City Brewing Maduro pours a bright mahogany that’s relatively clear with a tannish head.  The head dissipates relatively quickly, but the brew gives off a deep scent of caramel, toffee, nuts, and brown sugar with a hint of spice.  The scent is deep, complex, and adds notes of woodsy elements, molasses, espresso, and cigar wrapper.  Being able to draw something off the top isn’t a stretch, but it is wonderful in it’s complexity.  On the palate, it starts out a little light,  and maintains a slightly thin body.  The flavors are balanced between nutty flavors and the more sugary malt notes, like brown sugar, caramel, and molasses.  There’s an underlying bitterness that’s vaguely coffee inspired.  On the end it finishes quickly with just touches of caramel and cigar wrapper.","TastyFoodAndDrink","Dec 06, 2014"

Intense caramel & toasted malt, toffee aromas, notes of herbal infusion & fresh black tobacco. Caramelish upfront rounded by hints of licorice & coffee infusion. Light to medium body. Moderate carbonation. Dried & velvety mouthfeel. Candy & sweet roasted flavors touched by smoked malt hues resolve in a sweet malty finish. Strong flavors of bitter chocolate infusion on the aftertaste. Complex & flavorful!!","GONZALOYANNA","Mar 10, 2014"
