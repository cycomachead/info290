Looks alright, while the aroma and flavour have a rich malt presence accompanied by a considerable hop bitterness. Subtle roasty and fruity notes mingle on the palate. Mouthfeel is OK but could be slightly more substantial. Well-crafted and traditional; shame it's filtered as I imagine live yeast would add an extra dimension to the character. Doubtless a cracker on cask. Worth sampling if you come across it.","jazzyjeff13","Jan 01, 2014"

It has depth in the feel, too, with dryness underneath a sweeter overtone and a certain richness to it. Crispness is light but firm and consistent from first hitting the tongue to the back of the throat in every sip, while it goes creamy smooth for the duration.","Brenden","Nov 07, 2013"
