4.91,24.9,4.5,4.75,5,5,5,"Poured into a glass from a bomber.  This beer was extremely dark for a brown ale and very heavy.  Nutty and malty with hints of chocolate in the aftertaste.  Also a tad woody and finishes clean with a dash of bitterness.  Had this beer awhile ago and hope to see it on the shelves again.","barfootbandit","Jan 12, 2015"
