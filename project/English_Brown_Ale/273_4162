Didn't cry over it but If I could have got the last of the keg for free I would have been fantastic! It was a very lite and smooth for a dark beer. I could drink a few different then a heavy stout!","Beerma","Feb 19, 2015"

3.5,-2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Interesting take on a brown here, more of a caramel toasty base than a nutty chocolate roast one, making it a lighter and more easy drinking, but equally flavorful example of the style. Nice frothing head on it with decent retention, an amber hue, and a nose of sweet medium crystal malt. The yeast is nondescript, unlike other English style browns out there, but u don't miss it as the beer is dry enough for me in the finish and not seemingly missing anything. Medium bodied with average carbonation, this beer isn't going to change the world, but it's a plenty serviceable warm weather brown, and that's all good in my book.","StonedTrippin","Jan 31, 2015"
