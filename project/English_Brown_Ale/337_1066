4.25,18.4,,,,,,"Overall:  This feels a bit of a hybrid of an English pale ale and a brown ale.  There is a nice balance of floral hop bitterness upfront and finished with a good roasted character.  This is a pleasant beer thats sort of a catch-all.  This could work in a wide variety of situations whether you wanted something bitter or malty and this could pair with a lot of different foods.","Tuck_leepulin","Aug 14, 2014"

3.2,-10.9,3,3,3.5,3,3,"Poured from the bottle, the beer was a murky brown color with a slightly off-white head. The aroma was a slightly tinny, malty scent. In others words, it smelled kind of like the inside of a brewery. The initial taste was a smooth malty sweetness with note of chocolate and toasted nuts. The aftertaste was a slightly sour wheat with a medine-like quality at times, that stays nicely on the back of the throat. The moderate thickness and low carbonation aided the staying power that was even equipped with a slight warming sensations. Overall, this is a pretty middle-of-the-road brown ale. Nothing is spectacular about it, yet it is very drinkable.","JohnnyHopps","Jul 23, 2012"

3.7,3.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall: A very light brown ale that can only be fully appreciated when you understand the region it comes from. Houston is damn hot, and most of the year it is really hard to drink a heavy beer. So this is a brown ale that is not very heavy, and actually very refreshing. You could sit out by the lake on a 90 degree summers evening and knock back a few. There are very few other beers with this kind of taste that can be enjoyed like that. So, well done Saint Arnolds, you made a damn good brown ale.","Siriusfisherman","Jun 06, 2011"
3.76,4.7,4,3,4,4,4,"Figured this would be a good brew to accompany the inaugural episode of the new season of Breaking Bad. Dunno why. It pours a clear garnet-russet topped by a finger or so of light cream-white foam. The nose is pretty weak, barely comprising light maple syrup and brown sugar. This is a bit of a disappointment. The taste amps up the aforementioned maple syrup and brown sugar and adds a light touch of cocoa, light molasses, green apple, toffee, and a hint of roasted malts. Things have definitely improved from the smell. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a pretty smooth feel. Overall, a very nice brown, something I wouldn't mind sipping on regularly if given the chance.","TMoney2591","Apr 27, 2011"
3.43,-4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Saint Anrold brown ale poured a ruddy brown in my tulip glass, the body of the beer is visually dense, so I could not see any carbonation. The head was about 2/3 inch tall and off white. The smell is of toasty and nutty malts. As I taste it I first get that roasted flavor followed by some nuttiness, the finish includes a good bit of earthy hops. The mouthfeel is medium, and carbonation was present but not aggressive.","gkunkle","Apr 22, 2011"
3.43,-4.5,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall-Saint Arnolds seems to be doing big things. DR11 was great, DR9 is becoming a fall seasonal in a bomber, and their adding a hefeweizen.

Sweet malt with notes of lightly roasted nut and the sugared candyesque backbone I've found common with other Saint Arnold beers fills the nose here. With regards to taste, this carries the roasted malt character of a brown ale but has a distinguishing sweetness that separates it from others I've sampled. Perhaps that's characteristic to the brewery's yeast of choice...All in all, this is a quite tasty and drinkable bright flavored treat with a malt sweet finish. Cheers!","albertjr21","Nov 29, 2010"

I spent a few days in Houston, and the beer scene in TX seems pretty lackluster. Despite the fact I loved the Divine Reserve #5, I think that the warm TX whether tends to "lighten" the popular craft beers produced there. That thought neatly explains this particular beer. It looks and smells a lot like a lager, but does have some dark roastiness that tastes like caramel and molasses and brings it into line with other brown ales I've had. Mouthfeel is a little light and watery.","BeerBelcher","Feb 18, 2010"

Honestly this tastes like a really fruity ESB with a little added chocolate malt and a halt put on the hops. Finishes dry but then feels cloying in the aftertaste. Weird.

It is a little lighter than I prefer and Im not too crazy about the traces of diacetyl flavor. Take these two small flaws away and you would have a world class product.

Mouthfeel is a bit thin but has a nice smoothness to it. Like a summer silk, really. Or not really, but who's counting? Drinkability is very good.

Bready, grainy malt and biscuit initially in flavor is ceded by medium lovibond caramel malt sweetness and understated hints of semisweet chocolate. Mellow, earthy hop flavor emerges late simultaneously with subtle butterscotch diacetyl. Mild hop bitterness helps lend a persistent sweetness, both caramel malt and residual dextrin derived. Light in bodied, w/ a passable mouthfeel. Finishes clean and a touch watery, with a fading impression of peppered biscuit. Certainly not rich in character, but well balanced overall for good quaffability. A good session beer, but only a couple notches above the norm for the typically insipid brown.

3.5,-2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a brownish amber color with a fizzy and bubbly off-white head that quickly dissipated. Nose is dominated by roasted malts with hints of chocolate. The roasted malt and hops clearly come through in the taste along with notes of coffee, caramel, and dark chocolate. An average to nice brown ale.","Morris729","Jun 19, 2002"
3.63,1.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a dark amber tea color with a small tan head with staying power and leaves a lace down the glass.  It has a sweet bread smell with a hint of spice.  The taste is burnt malt with a trace of chocolate and finishes thin with a bread after-taste in this light-bodied brew.  One of the better ones from Saint Arnold.  Cheers from Texas!","BeerAngel","Apr 24, 2002"
3,-16.4,3,3,3,3,3,"Pours a dark mahogony brown with a full tan head that all too soon vanishes, well carbonated with decent lace.  Strong aroma of roasted malt and hops, hints of bitter chocolate.  The flavor begins with some maltiness, less than I expected, followed by coffee and bitter cocoa flavors and a strong hop finish.  Also a bit watery.  Not as good as some other brown ales that I have had, so I was a bit disappointed.  This is not a bad beer, but there are better examples of the style to be had.","Pegasus","Beers"
3.04,-15.3,2.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"This was a disapointing beer from the get-go with a thin fizzy head and big-bubble carbonation like a soda. The aroma wasn't too bad with a nice citrusy hop presence. A grapefruit-like hop presence shows up first in the flavor, but then is followed by a watery thinness that leaves you wishing there was more to the beer. Would have been better as a lightly hopped pale ale instead of a brown. Browns need more body than this.","aracauna","0"
