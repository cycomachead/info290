APPEARANCE: intimidatingly dark mahogany body; swiftly descending off-white head; flat, inconsistent up top... AROMA: thick, intense, sweet syrupy punch that encompasses a beautifully smoky embrace; hickory also mates with flattened hops to approximate a brown ale/porter mash-up ... PALATE: weighty, rather flat cola mouthfeel; teeth must withstand some energy, but the warmth sits idly on the tongue--heavy.....TASTE: sweet and malty with the syrup  and smoke mitigating a rather uneventful flavor; a bit of biscuit late, but not what the aroma promises... OVERALL: Autumnal, yes--but the allure of its scent doesn't measure up when sipped; low alcohol content makes it sessionable--with toffee and gritty malts, good for (a couple of) night caps....","dacrza1","Oct 14, 2014"

The aroma is malt-oriented, with some nice light dark fruit, a nice nutty quality. The taste is great, especially for a low ABV beer. It has a robust malt profile, with the nutty quality dominating, supported by some nice roasted undertones and a good earthy hops quality. The body has a nice weight a little carbonation. A great fall session ale.","delta490","Oct 05, 2014"

3.93,7.7,3.75,3.75,4,4,4,"I love this beer. one of my favorite fall releases. brown ale brewed with maple syrup, just right for a chilly Adirondack evening. deep brown to red on the pour, a faint caramel glow in the light, and an inch of khaki colored head with decent retention that produces ring lacing each sip. nose is caramel malt based, with a hint of dry cocoa and an unmistakable maple sweetness. the sugar contrasts with the almost bitter malt really well in the flavor, as the rich grains drive the flavor until the finish, where a warm maple vanilla complex gently rounds out the taste. its not overly sweet, and as such a real drinkable. a sixer of this is no problem. medium bodied for a brown, and carbonated just enough. this is a patient beer through too, and improves as it warms a little. probably my favorite beer from long trail, and its beers like this that make fall my favorite season to be a beer lover.","StonedTrippin","Sep 15, 2013"

4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. It comes out a nice brown color with a beige or off-white colored head. When held up to the light it turns out to be more of an amber red color. It has good clarity to it, well filtered. The head goes away after a few sips and leaves a ring with a little layer of foam over the middle, small random patches of lacing that seem to try to work it's way down to the liquid. The smell is very good, it smells very well hopped, pine and floral notes. There's a lot going on in the taste department. Much sweeter than anticipated, can clearly taste some roasted caramelized malts. There are also a slight chocolate taste to it, more like coco, very interesting. Only a slight hop aftertaste, it doesn't taste anything like the smell that's for sure. There's also a smokey taste to it, probably some roasted/burned malts involved with the flavor. It's a very complex taste, but quite good. The mouthfeel is good, despite the complex flavor I'd still call it a medium bodied beer and closer to the lighter side. This is an incredibly drinkable beer, and another solid brew by Long Trail. Still haven't decided whether or not I'm going to pick up another six pack this season because there are so many seasonals I like this time of year. If not than I have something to look forward to next year.

Speaking of which, the website said this is based on an English brown style, but it looks like an American amber. What's the deal? I don't mind crossover styles, but when the brewery tells you it's one thing, then goes on and on about all the malt varieties and organic local ingredients, it gets kind of confusing.

Has some hearty and earthy aspects, but that zing just overpowers it too much I say. Good feel, but a bit thin. Overall this is decent at best I have to say. Well made, yes.

Well-balanced aroma with caramel malts and mild hops character. Taste follows the nose, with a little less depth of malt character than I expected. Mouthfeel is good, and drinkability is great. A nice seasonal from the guys at Long Trail, worth getting if you see it.","ppoitras","Oct 16, 2004"
4.12,12.9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a nice amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has a very sweet and fruity smelling malt aroma that refreshes. The taste is good. It has a sweet, yet slightly dry malty flavor that boasts of pale and crystal malts. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine harvest brew. It has good flavor and aroma; a good drinker.","WesWes","Oct 15, 2004"
3.88,6.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Freshly imported from Vermont, this ale pours a nice dark amber color with a nice thick head with nice lacing. The smell was nothing spectacular but the intial sip left a nice smokey taste. The flavor is very subtle and not overpowering in anyway. This ale is quite smooth and very drinkable.","biernuss","Sep 14, 2004"
4.3,17.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours out a deep copper color with a shade of gold in there. Light carbonation can be seen with turns into lacing afterwards. Smell was nice. Toasted malts, caramel, nutty aromas, and some light hops are in the background to balance it out. Taste was good. Pretty much the same as the nose but with a little more hop bitterness comes up in the end. Some nice toffee and toasted flavors show up in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was light to medium. Mouthfeel got a little ding because it was a little bit watery in the aftertaste. But other than that, a top 3 fall seasonal for me. Just goes down too fast.","necoadam","Sep 08, 2004"
3.71,1.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Using all of the malt and hops from their other beers is kind of a gimmick, but they pull it off.","ColForbin","Aug 29, 2004"
4.42,21.1,4,4.5,4.5,5,4,"I must say I was shocked by this beer, didn't expect much. Poured brownish auburn with a big thick lasting head. I loved the smell, had hints of honey. The mouthfeel was wonderfully fluid and mouth coating. The blend of flavors is quite impressive (honey, woodsy, roasty). Very drinkable and quenching brew. Highly recommended!","Hhawk06","Jan 20, 2004"

3.82,4.7,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,"Nice offering from Long Trail. Dark amber in color with decent head, receding slowly. Coming right at me are the spices and the hops. I want to open the window to let the October New England night air in here. I will drink this again as it is available all around here.","BigPapaLager","Oct 21, 2003"
3.92,7.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer cascades from the bottle in the form of a limpid dark copper color, the head is modest in size, bubbly in texture, and a light tan color, the lace is a covering sheet. Nice malt nose, caramel and fresh, sweet start with a rather thin top. Finish is crisply acidic; hops are resplendent in their spiciness, quite dry aftertaste, and a decent drinking beer.","Gusler","Oct 21, 2003"
3.48,-4.7,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Very similar to the bottled version, with a touch less diacetyl through the flavor. The butterscotch isn't so overwhelming. Pleasant toasty caramel maltiness, with mild herbal hopping in the finish. The beer still retains that signature Long Trail coarseness and grainy finish, but it's a bit better on tap.","UnionMade","Oct 17, 2003"
4.03,10.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Taste is bitter hops up front, followed by big rich malt and followed again by a big hoppy bitterness. Lots going on here. Nutty and thick feeling, like syrup. Sticky. A bit unbalanced with the hops overpowering the malt at the end but otherwise is nicely conceived. Very nice fall brew for chilly New England falls.","ViveLaChouffe","Oct 16, 2003"
3.83,4.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours out a deep amber brown with a light head. The varity of malts and hops in this brew is vast and it shows in flavor for it. Tastes bold and beautiful. Very well balanced, but not as smooth as I would have liked. Certainly a very drinkable brew. A worthy substitute if the store is sold out of Jinx.","scottum","Oct 16, 2003"
3.69,1.1,3,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Reddish amber with a thin disappearing head. The smell is interesting with a touch of maple and fresh bread. Interesting. A chewy caramel flavor runs throughout the profile with flashing hints of dark malts, crystal, and either Special B or a touch of chocolate. Slight hops but only in flavor, not in bitterness or aroma. Nicely balanced. The finish is sweet. An interesting beer that is very smooth and drinkable. The commercial version of a "kitchen sink" beer that home brewers do with leftover grains and much better. There is a flavor I cant identify still that adds a bit of mystery to the brew, causing me to have another.","UncleFrank","Oct 07, 2003"
3.43,-6,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Dark copper color with an off-white frothy head that sinks quickly. Low aroma of sweet malt and flowers, a little buttery. Flavor is light and sweet, mild malt, also a bit flowery with some notes of popcorn. Low hop presence. Smooth mouthfeel, carbonation a bit on the low side. Flavor is a bit too mild for me.","far333","Sep 27, 2003"
3.04,-16.7,4,2.5,3,3,3.5,"The taste was a bit of a letdown. Very flat across the malt profile, thinish mouthfeel, and very little hop character that was enjoyable. I'm really suprised how much I didn't like this beer after reading previous reviews. Thought it would be my kind of brown.","yankeeheel","Sep 20, 2003"
4.09,12.1,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured a deep brown color with a medium head with low retention. The nose was awesome, a mix of caramel notes and piney hops. The flavor was very bitter, balanced by a bit of sweet malts and finishing with an astingent sourness. It was very smooth drinking and plenty refreshing. So far one of my favorite Fall seasonals. Though I wonder how this is categorized as a PA.","nixhecks","Sep 19, 2003"
4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a clear auburn amber with a small tan head that sticks around and leaves good lacing. Aroma is all over the place with the maltiness - bready, caramel, and lots of nuttiness. Flavor, again, is dominated with maltiness - nuttiness up front, some caramel and bread, and a bit of chocolate show up in there. Hops flavor and aroma are at a minimum here, but the flavor is still pretty large and diverse. Body is medium-full, and it goes down dangerously easy.","goz","Sep 18, 2003"
4.03,10.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured a beautiful chocolate creamy head. Smell was nice and malty. Taste had a hint of tartness embedded in a nice malt base. Mouthfeel was light to medium bodied, but had enough kick at the end to let you know it wasn't that light. A nice "sit down" beer well worth sipping through and leaves you with a nice aftertaste.","edchicma","Sep 16, 2003"
4.27,17,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Notes: I truly wish this weren't so carbonated, but it's still the beast fall seasonal I've had. Certainly my favorite of Long Trail's offerings. You won't be disappointed with this one, although the greenness might stand for some mellowing.","rabidawg","Sep 09, 2003"
4.09,12.1,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"This is a terrifically tasty brew.  Pours a deep amber, almost reddish color, with a thin, clingy head.  The head falls quickly, but the wisps that remain leave decent lace.  The smell is fantastic:  toasted malts and a background of floral hops.  Medium body, great malt character, and a slightly bitter finish.  It's one of those beers that I can keep sniffing and sipping all night.","Suds","Oct 19, 2002"
4.32,18.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"i love this beer. it was at the latest sampling session, and it was just marvelous. smooth creamy malts just melt into you as you throw it back. not that alcoholic malty taste, but a nice clean sweet maltiness that just makes you tingle","ElGuapo","Oct 16, 2002"
4.18,14.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Smooooooooooooooooooooth. Creamy amber beer that goes down like butta. Lots of malt flavor, and comes out with some serious sweetness, but not sugary-sweet. Definitely a winner with me. Did I mention the maltiness?","IrishRedRock","Oct 16, 2002"
4.3,17.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Aroma is malty - almost like toasted whole wheat bread with hints of hop & sweetness. A nicely complex brew - flavors of cocoa, toast, nuts, some fruitiness, and a decent amount of hop bitterness combine to keep your entire mouth interested. A beer that's perfectly suited to its release - you can practically taste & smell fallen leaves on a Vermont lane. Stupidly poetic, yes, but that's the image the flavor of this one conjures up. A fall favorite, and one of Long Trail's better efforts.","sponberg","Oct 15, 2002"
4.47,22.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Gotta give props to pbrian for sending this one my way.","Bighuge","Oct 15, 2002"
4.35,19.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"While probably inspired by an Octoberfest, that is just a starting point. This brew forges it's own path. Probably my favorite Long Trail.","RonfromJersey","Oct 10, 2002"
4.07,11.5,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"A clear russet body is topped by a creamy, light tan head that drops fairly quickly but holds an exceptional collar and light surface coating, and leaves some nice lace as well. The aroma is gently fruity, lightly chocolatey and somewhat nutty. The body is light with a very fine & gentle carbonation that leaves it quite smooth and creamy in the mouth. The flavor starts with some fruitiness (summer berries, very light cherry), mellows into a toasty & nutty maltiness, and then turns lightly cocoa-ish character. It finishes with a softly fluttering bitterness and lingering biscuity & nutty character. Light, and far from rich, but full of character that keeps it interesting. Exceptionally drinkable.","NeroFiddled","Oct 10, 2002"
4.13,13.2,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a great bright amber color with a nice light tan head that sinks but never disappears and laces the glass very nicely.  Very nice toasty malt aroma with a nice citric hoppiness of grapefruits and some other hoppy fruitiness.  Nice toasty maltiness that carries all the way through the beer and holds it up nicely.  The chewy resinny hops come through about half way through and have a nice piney/citrus character that is almost chewy.  The smoothness of the malt balances nicely with a crisp quality that the hops provide and make this one excellently drinkable brew.  Yet another big winner from Long Trail, excellent beer.  A big thanks to pbrian for the brew.","Murph","Sep 28, 2002"
4.38,20,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Ahh, my first fall beer of the season.  Life is good.  Looks beautiful in the glass - clear reddish amber with thick sticky head.  Toasty, nutty aromas with small amounts of flowery hops.  Malt profile is deep and complex, toasted and biscuity with some nuttiness.  Drier overall but a little sweetness coats the mouth.  Nice beer.","pbrian","Aug 22, 2002"
4.77,30.7,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"By far, my favorite in the Long Trail family.  Let this one sit for a while after taking it out of the fridge, or else you're depriving yourself of the true greatness of this beer.  Flavors/aromas galore.  A great seasonal and a great ale overall.","SixpointJMH","Jul 28, 2002"
4.18,14.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Notes: A fall seasonal sure to please the hard core ale drinkers. Serve at cellar temp and it is to die for. A smorgasbord for the senses to make for a truly great brew.","Jason","Apr 05, 2002"
