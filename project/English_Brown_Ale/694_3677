4.56,22.6,3.75,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,"On tap at the Troegs Brewery, bit too dark for a brown ale, but still a nice brown, and not amber, color, wonderful silky white foam, very tasty, and with pleasing lacing to the bottom of the pint. The flavor profile was robust, a good smooth blend of grain flavors, with a nice hop kick. The word was that the batch had been more highly hopped than in the past for Rugged Trail. It was posted as 5.2% ABV and 50 IBU. This is a very drinkable and satisfying brown. It's too bad brown ales aren't the American Beer du Jour these days.","ravenwork","Nov 24, 2014"
