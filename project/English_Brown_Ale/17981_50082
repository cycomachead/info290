As it's a brown ale, I figured it would be like comparing apples and smaller, weak tasting, less flavorful apples. I've been pleasantly surprised. The roast aroma is rich and rounded, and becomes more so as it warms, if there's cocoa or vanilla in there, it's either so subtle as to elude taste, or it's balanced perfectly with the espresso, complementing and enhancing the coffee's roast, rather than overpowering it. There's some toffee on the back end, but the major player here is wonderfully well-made coffee with a touch of sweetness. I feel the mouthfeel would benefit from a bit more richness, or perhaps a little less carbonation. But then again, this seems to be the norm for brown ales. All in all, I'd have this again. Not right now, but tomorrow. Good stuff.","thezach","May 25, 2014"

Had it for the first time a little over three years ago, loved it then, didn’t have it again until a few days ago, and still love it. This is, at its heart, a clean, simple, and relatively dry American Brown that pulls in an extremely tasteful coffee component, integrates it flawlessly, and becomes that much better for it. Seek it out, it’s worth it. Plus, at 5.5% ABV, you can have a couple without a problem.","fmccormi","Feb 11, 2014"

Deep, rich coffee aroma, with sweet malt and a rich earthiness. The taste is heavy on the coffee/toffee front with a back sweetness from the malt. It almost has the superb mouth feel of Maduro, where I think there might be some rolled oats to increase the creaminess, but I get much less oat than I do in Maduro. Really enjoy this beer when it comes out. Finally got around to reviewing it instead of just crushing the 4 pack in a few days.","mverity","Jul 25, 2013"

Huge mocha foam head forms instantly over flowing the glass, cools down into one fingers worth. The smell is surprisingly still coffee heavy. Cold pressed espresso with some metallic notes. The taste is much better with faded espresso beans and some lightly roasted malts. A bitter coffee bean aftertaste. Somewhat creamy mouth feel. I hate reviewing a coffee beer with two years on it, but its not as terrible as I thought it would be. The coffee is still hanging on.","davey101","May 04, 2013"

4.57,11.2,4,5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"The beer pours a light roast coffee-brown, slightly like synthetic pancake syrup, and it sits in the glass as a very dark syrupy brown. It pours with about a quarter’s finger width of very slightly tanning head that fades from the middle of the beer but stays consistent on the sides. The beer leaves a slight lacing of dry splotchy bubble sheets. The beer’s body is dark and slightly hazy, but seems clean of particles. On the nose, the beer smells phenomenally of thick bitter chocolaty espresso. It has that sort-of stale coffee bean scent that is really quite inviting. It has a grainy yet slightly milked coffee bean smell to it that I am just loving the superb slight creamy chocolate nuances. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet and then builds into a lovely coffee bitter. The flavor begins as sweet cacao chocolate flavors that slowly roast in the mouth and become sweet creamy espresso with a touch of bitter instant coffee. The finish is beautiful mocha espresso flavors. The aftertaste is of slight bitter coffee. In the mouth, the beer feels on the thinner side of medium with a creamy, latte-foam feel to the carbonation. The mouth is left feeling slightly dry from the encroaching roast of the coffee beans and some slight acid-neutralizing spittle, presumably also from the coffee beans. Overall, I really like this beer. This is a superb coffee beer, and a superb coffee brown ale. I love the creaminess of the beer, and I absolutely love the balance between the bitter coffee and the creamy, sweet vanilla and chocolate flavors. This beer thrives on superb balance, and is fully worth sampling. This is probably the best none-stout coffee beer I’ve ever tried. Try this beer!","Maxwell","Apr 14, 2013"

4.44,8,4,5,4.5,4,4,"The bottle has been cooling down for most of the day and I cannot resist any longer! My pour created a dense finger of deep-tan head with moderate retention. Color was a deep brown with limited light penetration and only amber highlights at the edges. Nose took me back to La Maddalena, Sicily, c. 1985 and Sunday late mornings/afternoons, learning how to play Bocce from the natives. You can call it Cuban-style all you want, but espresso is espresso the world over and I readily recognize the scent. Giuseppe Guillermo was the name of the old man who took me under his wing, put a cuppa in my left (non-throwing) hand, a pallino in my right hand and a Parodi in my mouth. Mouthfeel was big, full and tasted like cold coffee. You had best brace yourself for the flavor of tobacco, charcoal and simple roastiness if you plan to indulge in this gem. I no longer smoke (anything), due to adult-onset asthma, but this made me want to light up. For you cigar aficionados, I recommend a maduro, if you catch my drift. The finish left me feeling like I had just finished a Bocce match - my mouth was dry and laden with a taste of charcoal smoke and my heart was racing. Good times, brothers, good times. Say, did I just remember there is another bottle awaiting my attention?!?","woodychandler","Aug 02, 2011"

This beer pours a medium bodied rich mahogany in color with ruby highlights and a one finger beige colored head. It looks a little lighter than I remember Maduro. It smells like Big Sound, of all things, mixed with a shot of espresso. It gives aromas of chocolate, sweet malt, cream, with a light coffee bitterness. The flavors presented are dark roasted malt with a touch of bitter coffee. The chocolate doesn't come in as well as it did in the nose and the overly appealing scotch esque malt isn't present either. The flavor is also short lived and not as strong as it could or should be. It drinks a little thin, and thinner than Maduro and just doesn't feature the same complexity as the base beer. Overall it's a solid beer, but Maduro is far superior in my opinion.","aasher","Aug 01, 2011"

The aroma consists of coffee beans, tobacco, smoke, roast, leather, and some mustiness. Jeff nailed it - "This beer smells like John Wayne." The flavor is more coffee forward than the nose would indicate, with less intricacies than were presented to the olfactory senses. The base beer is still distinguishable, and not overrun by the often dominating coffee scents. The feel is somewhat thin, with moderate carbonation. A decent brew, and quite interesting.

The nose hits you with straightforward creamy espresso, chicory along with the slightest note of sour funk and toasty chocolate notes.

A deep, dark brown color with ruby highlights and a light, thin, foamy head. Smells like I dove into a double espresso. Smelling this made the hair on my chest stand up. Bravo! Flavor is very heavy in the coffee, and tastes like I am eating coffee beans. Slight sweetness helps balance the bitterness from the liquid Juan Valdez.

4.22,2.7,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Had this one on tap in the tasting room in Tampa. This is a modified version of Cigar City's Maduro Brown Ale to which they've added (you guessed it) coffee! The appearance is a medium brown with some red hues coming through, bubbly white head. Great aroma: the coffee really comes through. I forgot to ask exactly what the method for adding the coffee was when I was on the tour (grinds vs. brewed, etc) but the aroma is very full and roasty. The taste finds a nice balance between sweet and bitter from the roasted malts/coffee. A little lighter bodied than I had expected, but this actually makes it much more drinkable. I only wish we could buy Cigar City in Buffalo, as a six pack of this beer would make a winter day much more bearable.","amc2341","Dec 24, 2010"

I don't know why, but I went into this not expecting coffee to go with a brown ale, but the base is the oatmeal brown ale and the thickness of the oatmeal gives the brown ale what it is missing for me overall...and this one has a touch of a stout thing with the espresso. Well worth the try if you can come by this one...would love to get my hands on some more, but like the non-espresso brew, a bit on the heavy side.","cosmicevan","Dec 20, 2010"

It had a medium-heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this brew was quite excellent. Since I personally don't drink coffee, I could see this as being a damn fine substitute.

4.12,0.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Reviewed from my notes. Sampled from a fresh growler I split with BlessedBeBeer. This beer is mostly opaque brown, but it appears translucent at the bottom of the glass (I'm drinking this out a Maine Beer Co. flute). It has a tan soapy head. As I consume the beer, it leaves behind some good lacework and film. It has a huge coffee aroma, almost as if someone dumped some coffee into the growler before sealing it. All kinds of roasted malts will greet your nose when you take the aroma in. I can taste a bit of sweetness up front; it reminds me of granular sugar (maybe because that is what I would put in coffee to sweeten it up). The coffee flavors come in at the finish and last a long time. There is a lot of coffee bitterness. In effect, it's like drinking an alcoholic cup of coffee. It has a lighter body and low carbonation. There is almost no coating left behind in terms of texture, but there is a lot of flavor that remains in my mouth after I swallow. This is a pretty drinkable beer, but there is a lot of coffee flavor, probably more than in any other beer I've tried. The 32oz growler that Cigar City offers is perfect for this beer. Any more of it and you'll want some friends to share with.","ToasterChef","Aug 01, 2010"

Dare I say it actually is reminescent of a cigar? Taste includes coffee blended with the cigar/tobacco flavors previously indicted by the nose. This tobacco flavor lingers in the mouth.

Medium to lighter in body but the carbonation matches it, low and mellow, enhancing the complex but mild flavors.

4,-2.7,4,4,4,4,4,"D - Quite a tasty brown ale overall and certainly not too heavy-handed with the coffee character. The addition of chocolate, vanilla and hop bitterness kept this brew from becoming too one-dimensional. Enjoyable but not mind-blowing.","ffejherb","Mar 09, 2010"
4.67,13.6,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Ok this is another one of those I think I might accidentally attempt to order this beer at Starbucks instead of at a bar. Straight coffee on this one, although it is very refreshing and light bodied. Unlike the Wake N' Bake from Terrapin this beer is smooth, light, and not very filling. There is a hint of brown sugar and cinnamon lingering around the taste of the beer. This bee is pretty dangerous.","DosBeerigos","Mar 08, 2010"
4.2,2.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"D - Smooth with lots of complex coffee and caramel character. The coffee is assertive but well balanced by the malt and doesn't overwhelm the palate. This is a very nicely made beer, the coffee highlights the best qualities of the base beer without overwhelming it.","nickfl","Feb 27, 2010"
4.27,3.9,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Overall this is another tasty iteration of the Maduro series - well worth a shot and I look forward to trying others.","glid02","Feb 21, 2010"

4.46,8.5,3.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"This was a uniquely delicious beer. I almost always associate intense coffee flavors and aromas with dark, roasty, smoky stouts. This brew was quite different however.

3.77,-8.3,4,4.5,3.5,2.5,4,"A little light in body and mouthfeel, lacking depth of complexity however extremely quaffable. Sweet dark malts with espresso on the finish. Some light nutty character. Good roastiness on the finish as well that must be from the coffee. Nice beer but was expecting more from the what the aroma suggested.","mcallister","Jan 29, 2010"
4.08,-0.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Definitely a coffee-forward aroma, but it's not a really oily french roast or anything, it's more of a hazelnut blend type of thing going on. A little brown sugar and some grainy malt in the background. Taste mirrors this, and the brown ale base is a bit more evident with some lightly toasted nuts and toffee, good amount of malt sweetness. Really nice creamy mouthfeel which is definitely thick as far as brown ales go, but works well for this beer. Really drinkable and I wish that I had gotten more than a 16oz growler. Looking forward to trying more of CCB's brown ales and I wouldn't hesitate to order this one on tap if I come across it again.","Ineedabeerhere","Dec 26, 2009"
4.33,5.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Growler pour from Decicco's, Ardsley, NY. Pours darkest of browns, light black, dark tan head, plentiful and thicker sheeting and bands of elegent lace. Coffee grounds come to mind upon the sniff. Flavorful Brown, some light chocolate, gets overtaken by waves of more coffee. Not overpowering, just flavorful and coffealicious in its approach. Well crafted and enjoyable in all its facets...looking forward to more Cigar City brews in the NYC/CT/NJ/NY suburbs...and cant wait to check em out whenever I'm lucky enough to get back down to Tampa, F.L.A.","Billolick","Dec 23, 2009"

4.17,1.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours a clear almost ruby brown color with a tight clingy head that left a sheet of lacing as it dissipated. The aroma is of a big bready malt, nice earthy chocolate and coffee notes, and cocoa powder. The taste is of milk chocolate, cocoa powder, very light coffee flavor, grassy hops and a lemon sourness towards the end. The brew has a very earth quality to it which is nice in brown ales. The feel is surprisingly thin with fairly soft carbonation; finishes slightly bitter. Another very tastey brew from Cigar City. Solid brown ale base with oatmeal to make the ale very smooth. Nice powedery chocolate flavor gives this an appealing earthy quality. I appreciate the 5.5%ABV.","Gmann","Nov 21, 2009"

4.62,12.4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a Unibroue tulip. Nice beige head sticks around for just a moment. Aroma is strong of dark, toasted malts and coffee, coffee and more coffee. Taste follows suit, with some mild sweetness somewhere in the background. Great balance upon tasting, not too over the top on the coffee and just a great balanced brown with a twist along with the typical Cigar City complexity. The Cuban espresso treatment is delicious and wonderful. I'm still waiting for Cigar City to make a less than world class beer. It may never happen.","KickbacksSteve","Aug 06, 2009"

4.27,3.9,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"As a coffee lover this one hit the spot. I'm definitely torn between this one and the original which I loved. The espresso is so dominant in this one that it may take away slightly from the complexity and balance of the underlying Maduro. That said, it's still head and shoulders above most brown ales out there and astoundingly robust for the low ABV. Another winner from CCB.","gford217","Jul 07, 2009"
4.64,12.9,4,5,4.5,5,4.5,"32 ounce growler from tpd975, thanks again for our first trade Greg, poured into an oversized vanilla version, shared with Ben, Bob, and Danny last night, color is medium brown with dark red edges, one inch beige head that is rather creamy, decent retention, some lacing at first, aroma consists of heavily roasted espresso beans, chicory, roasted malts, cream, dark chocolate, burned almonds, toasted caramel, and maybe a little vanilla, starts off very dry with a huge coffee component, unlike any coffee beer I have had as far as the consistency and feel, it almost felt like there was actual grounds in the beer, finish has more coffee and a good amount of charred nuttiness, there are not many brews out there other than weasel that make coffee work this well in beer, such a different taste with the freshest and most roasted taste imaginable, super dry, very roasted, and almost chewy mouthfeel, medium bodied, moderate carbonation that allowed this beer to feel absolutely perfect on the senses, taste lingers for a very very long time, could have drank this and another growler,amazing drinkability for a coffee infused beer, very light, would like some with my breakfast in the morning, smooth and crisp, this was hands down my favorite of the Maduros and if this stuff becomes widely available, this brewery is going to make an even bigger name for myself, this stuff is awesome, highly recommended","Floydster","Jun 29, 2009"
4.33,5.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a clear dark orange/brown, some reddish hints, thin light tan head forms, settles down to a thick ring, good lacing, looks about the same as the original. Smell is nice, very malty, caramel, nuts, bread and biscuits, nice espresso roast character, touch more chocolate, pretty nice. Taste is good too, big roast up front, fresh espresso, caramel sweetness, nuts, raisins, earthy, dry biscuits, very malty, nice roasty finish. Mouthfeel is the same, medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. This one is nice, the espresso character is pretty enjoyable! Thanks again Russ!","Viggo","Jun 23, 2009"

Non-coffee lovers will disagree given the sheer amount of espresso beans in this one. Overall, this is another great beer by Wayne and Joey over at CCB. So smooth and at 5.5%, breakfast is a great spot for this one. As far as the American Brown Ales I have tried, this one ranks right at the top! Great! Skal.","Gtreid","Jun 16, 2009"

4.53,10.2,3,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"As I sip, my mouth is filled with everything I like about a good morning meal. Huge coffee presence that warms and soothes. Following this is a mild breadiness that finishes sweet and satisfying. There's definite bitterness in here that is pleasant, but the sweetness and the coffee are kings. This is an excellent brown. I realize that it is limited in its release, but get some if you can.","Onenote81","Jun 09, 2009"
4.12,0.2,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours an amber brown in color, fairly clear with a good sized light tan head that slowly recedes with a little lacing left behind. Aroma is a nice fresh ground coffee aroma, nice and roasty, a little earthy, and a bit of chocolate as well. Some cola-like and light caramel sweetness in the nose blend with the coffee qualities. Taste follows the aroma fairly well, some nice espresso characteristics, slightly bitter and dry, but balanced by a sweeter, cola and nutty maltiness. Mouthfeel is light to medium in body, some malty creaminess mid taste and dry and bitter in the finish. I love a good brown and this definitely fits that description, very drinkable, delicious brown, great for a session, and the coffee notes work very well with it, very natural and proportionate.
