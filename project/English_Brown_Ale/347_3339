3.31,-10.8,,,,,,"This beer is above average.  Molasses  rules the day for me, a taste not usually associated with a brown.  Head was HUGE - 4 fingers on the pour.  Too much carbonation.  The head settles to a .5 finger head of thicker foam that lasts.  The finish of this beer is not great.","gonzo000","Aug 20, 2014"
