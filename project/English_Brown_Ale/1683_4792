3.64,6.4,4,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Pours to a permanent head that laces well. Aroma is brown, crystal and chocolate malts with nutty, roasty notes. Flavor is more of the same with a nice balancing low-impact hop bitterness that is distinctly English. Dry, crisp, nutty finish. Mouthfeel is medium and CO2 is on the high side for style. Overall a pleasing Brown.","EagleTalon","Aug 17, 2014"
3.58,4.7,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A fair though unexciting brown ale. The flavors and mouthfeel appear on the weak side of things and lacks a certain 'oomph' as far as overall impact. The beer doesn't fail as far as coming across as a brown ale, just lacks depth and distinction.","beergoot","Aug 15, 2014"
