Pours lightly hazy deep ruby brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of raisin, plum, prune, fig, caramel, toast, molasses, biscuit, brown bread, herbal, light chocolate, and toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of raisin, plum, prune, apple, caramel, toast, biscuit, brown bread, molasses, light nuttiness, light chocolate, herbal, and toasted earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, prune, apple, caramel, molasses, toast, biscuit, brown bread, herbal, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; with great robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice english brown ale. Good balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 13, 2014"

3.21,-6.4,2.5,4,3,3,3,"Close to no head, just a think layer of light brownish tan across the surface, swiftly gone, virtually zero lacing as well. The liquid is murky enough to achieve opacity, otherwise some brightness to the reddish brown color, some lighter orange tones further out, only the merest trace of bubbles. The nose emphasizes soft sweetness in the form of caramel, molasses, brown sugar, roasted nuts and soda bread, some carob and cinnamon like spices too, no real fruit or citrus presence, you get more oats and general grains as it warms. In the mouth it’s full-bodied, somewhat bottom heavy, paucity of carbonation does not help this situation, just sort of lays there until it suddenly loses weight through the finish, ends short. More bitter dark chocolate and cocoa here, hints at a sort of burnt quality. There are softening vanilla, hazelnut, caramel, toffee, nutmeg, creamed coffee and some cola bean notes as well as that soft baked dessert goods quality. Given the general sweetness of the flavors curious how texturally dry it is. Nothing which meaningfully bespeaks the presence of hops. Flavorful, can’t say there’s anything wrong with it per se but you forget you’re even holding a half full glass, not a good sign.","farrago","Dec 09, 2012"

3.3,-3.8,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Medium bodied with a balance of roasted malt, peppery spice and dark fruit. There's a slight syrupy medicinal presence along with some dark cherry and plum. The spice adds a slight dryness that balances the sweetness and compliments the subtle roasted chocolate malt character. Decent but kind of pedestrian.","corby112","Dec 04, 2011"

Dark roasted malt is present in this beer, but it is a bit thin for a winter warmer.
