3.32,-5.9,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.25,3.5,"Bottle. Pours brown! Thin, tan head. Smell is mild. Some sweetness and bread. Brown malt. Smells like a Brown Ale smells. No frills, nothing new. Flavor is also particularly restrained. It lacks richness and the flavors seem thin. Bread, meager chocolate, caramel, toast and the like. Body is rather light and also thin. Medium carbonation. Wasn't good, wasn't horrible.","VelvetExtract","Feb 21, 2015"
3.78,7.1,4.25,3.75,3.5,4.25,4,"Enjoyed a 4 oz pour at Homegrown Brewhouse in Summerville, SC. Even in the sample glass it pours with a nice frothy 2 finger head. The transparent, light brown brew demonstrates a nice degree of clarity. The cream colored head has just a hint of brown color, and it lingers throughout. Great head retention. After every sip, residual soapy lacing also clings to the little glass. The smell of pecan nuttiness & toasted grain greets the nose. A hint of malt sweetness and a biscuit like backdrop round out the aroma. The flavor is mildly sweet and nutty, with an earthy toasted character. It finishes pretty clean. Perhaps the best element of this beer is the texture. It's incredibly smooth, creamy and easy on the palate. The understated carbonation enhances the mouthfeel. While there's nothing exceptionally remarkable about this one, it's a great example of the style. Very sessionable. Very accessible. Experienced or intermediate drinkers can enjoy this with equal measure. Years ago, prior to reviewing beers, I'd tried another brown ale offering from RJ Rockers. Bald Eagle Brown. Not sure if this is the same stuff, re-branded with a more clever name, but I seem to enjoy this iteration more than the other.","JohnnyI","Feb 14, 2015"
3.76,6.5,3.25,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"A short head forms on the pour, and even that drops to a thin lacing on top. Below is a beer that is darker than mahogany. The aroma captures my attention with a sweet nuttiness, toffee, dates, and overall joy. It's a malty beer, no question about that, with a maltiness which doesn't tip the balance. For this afternoon, Brown Eyed Squirrel hits the mark.","DoubleJ","Feb 06, 2015"

3.55,0.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Served from bottle into a shaker. Pours a dark brown with a minimal off-white head. Maintained good lacing thoughout. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt and nutty notes. The flavor followed the nose with light roasted malt and nutty characters. It was light on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was not a bad brew. However, the flavors of this one were quite muted for some odd reason, as it warmed up they came out a little more but were still not pronounced. Still a nice brown ale that is worth trying.","thagr81us","Sep 12, 2010"

2.92,-17.3,2.5,3,3,2.5,3,"Fairly aggressive pour only gets you half a finger of off-white foam, gone in a flash with zero lacing left behind. Filminess deepens the mahogany brown color, stronger orange tones come out around the edges along with more clarity. The nose has a light touch, caramel, maple evidence of the malts yet there's also a somewhat bitter grassiness to it, almost a saline quality too, blanched almonds, whiff of mixed white citrus, that's about it. Light-bodied, the light carbonation not doing much to activate what's there. Again, starts off with caramel, toffee, chocolate powder and maple syrup, here the grapefruit, lemon citrus component more pronounced. The roastiness is generalized, more feel than flavor. The leafy hops keep it clearly on the dry side of things. A few notes of cherry or blackberry fruit. Mild clenching through the finish. Not horrible by any means, just not something I'd be interested in tasting again.","farrago","Feb 14, 2010"

Instead of being full-flavored yet drinkable, it's a little thick and not very tasty.

Nice dry toasty aroma with some nuttiness. Quite dry. Similar in taste, with a nice nutty dryness, some nice moderate toastiness and a touch of coppey metal in the finish. Quite nice.
