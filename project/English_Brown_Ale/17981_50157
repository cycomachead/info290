4.19,2.9,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4,"the vanilla adds a real nice touch to this already exceptional brown ale, and to have it from the nitro tap was awesome. cool little taphouse in stuart, florida called the crafted keg. its so creamy looking, darker than i remember it from the can, and holding its luxurious milky head leaving rings at every sip in the pint glass. it smells vanilla heavy, but not artificial at all, but some of the roast seems tamed by the sweetness it brings. the flavor holds true to that, and while the vanilla brings an awesome new flavor wrinkle, some of what made the original base beer special is lost to it just a bit. still, its a great base beer for vanilla, and i think the dosage is appropriate, except the sweetness that it brings lingers on the palate, maybe aided by the nitro feel less aggressive bubbles to wash the mouth clean. fuller bodied like a porter more than a brown ale as we know them. its not a negative, it just limits how much of this is desirable to drink, couple of pints tops for me, where regular maduro i was good for a sixer no problem. cool tweak, less nutty, more sweet, equally delicious.","StonedTrippin","Feb 08, 2015"

It is smooth tasting and you can even get the vanilla taste without it being overwhelming. Goes down nice and no weird after taste.","Pete_Ale-man","Dec 23, 2014"
