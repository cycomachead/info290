4.12,5.1,4.75,4.5,3.75,4,4.25,"Pours a very dark brown with a finger width head. Head quickly dissipates. Smell is a very nice expresso, coffee, and cocoa. Taste is also nice, but flavors of expresso and chocolate are less pronounced. Finish is smooth with a lot of carbonation and hints of nuttiness. One of the better brown ales I have experienced.","TBCE","Mar 26, 2015"
3.83,-2.3,4,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Brown with a nice tan head.  A little thin in my opinion, but then I like chewy beers.  A little heavy on the carbonation too, but then that might be another way of saying I like heavy, chewy beers.  Definite coffee, caramel, and malt, with maybe some raisins or prunes in the background.  Another one in the "plus" column for Cigar City!","dbl_delta","Mar 23, 2015"

Overall this is a really nice brown ale that I will buy many times and recommend to anyone who likes this style.  A little high in alcohol for a session beer but a couple won't knock you out either.","Retroman40","Jan 03, 2015"

4,2,,,,,,"Solid brown at 5.50 a can not a bad markup considering it's typically not available in Pittsburgh.  This pours dark almost black when held toward the light I get a deep mahogany hue with light beige head, fine speckled lacing lines the sides of my glass.  Aroma dark fruit, hints of cocoa, a touch of iced coffee, and roasted nuts.  Flavor light tobacco earthy dank quality, tea leaves, dark chocolate dryness more like cocoa powder, and a hint of nutty coffee.  Mouthfeel medium bodied dry finish nearly perfect brown ale, perfect level of natural dark roasted malt sweetness dark malts and low IBU level dry out the finish with tannic tea and tobacco notes.  Overall highly impressive flagship beer from the folks at Cigar City!","WVbeergeek","Nov 08, 2014"

Aroma is a very fragrant malt, nutmeats, cocoa, toffee, bit of roast. Flavor's like nose and very we'll balanced. The off tartness vanishes with a little time. Body/carbonation are about perfect. Finish is like flavor, has a few medicinal qualities that linger, and is overall very drinkable.","drpimento","Dec 19, 2013"

Flavor is similar to the nose, with a big mouthful of dark chocolate, a hint of espresso, tobacco leaves, very earthy and enjoyable. No hops in the mix what so ever. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium-bodied, not complaining, but I wouldn't be bummed if they beefed up the mouthfeel a bit. Carbonation is light and perfect for the style. Overall, I was totally blown away by this one - not expecting much (especially after the underwhelming appearance) and it was one of the better brown ales i've ever had. So earthy and sweet, just like a fine cigar.","DeanMoriarty","Oct 25, 2013"

I have enough experience with Maduro-wrapped cigars to say that this beer doesn't particularly remind me of one; however, I imagine it would pair quite well with a good, dark cigar (or dessert and/or dinner, for that matter).","Roguer","Oct 22, 2013"

I like it, don't get me wrong, but this didn't blow my doors off. maybe ill have to try it a little closer to the source, not sure how well this traveled to Colorado... not quite enough carbonation, a little thin on the body, and not as drinkable or unique as i imagined. maybe a victim of my own expectations on this one.","StonedTrippin","Oct 03, 2013"

4.66,18.9,4.5,4.75,4.5,5,4.75,"Goodness, after enjoying this beer for over a year, I'm finally reviewing it. Sipping from the can at the moment; however, I know this beer has a fantastic hazy brown color. It smells heavily of toffee and chocolate , with a good amount of caramel and coffee. The taste is mainly the toffee, closely followed by coffee and then the roasted malts. What really makes this beer for me is the mouthfeel. Superbly creamy. I can't recall if they actually employ oats in the brewing process, but it certainly feels like it. Maduro coats the tongue and mouth, and I love that about it. No homo.","mverity","May 15, 2013"

3.85,-1.8,4,4,3.75,4,3.75,"Poured a brownish body with two finger offwhite head that stuck around and left some lace. Aroma hit several minor notes of caramel, bitter chocolate, toffee, coffee, some roasted malts, touchs of other sugar sweetness and a tad of grainy hops or breadiness (something akin to those) but nothing spectacular. Taste of the beer is more of the same. While it is medium bodied and easy to drink and has a drying sensation on the finish, there is nothing spectacular about the beer. There is a balance of sweet malts and dry, roasted malts as well as a touch of hops but I really can't say this beer is too sweet or has a peculiar dryness/breadiness/hopiness to it to classify it as something else. A good beer but one, that for me at least, is just slightly under par with some other, better, brown ales/oatmeal stouts (which I really didn't get any taste or feel of oats although it would explain the smoothness of the beer).","clayrock81","Mar 28, 2013"

Nice roasted malts on the nose, taste is sweet caramel and toffee malts on the front palate with espresso, tobacco, earthy hops on the middle, and very toasted peanuts or burnt bread at the back end. Moderate body, mod-low carbonation a bit thin/wet mouthfeel. A fantastic brown, has great drink-ability.","williamjbauer","Dec 07, 2012"

Smell is not quite what I'd expect from a brown ale, it's got that sweet caramel malt presence, but also a good amount of dark fruit like a Belgian dark ale, but not quite as well-integrated. Flavor incorporates that fruitiness from the aroma in a mellow way and combines it with some nuttiness and roasted malt - it's unique and fairly easy to drink. It's sweeter and less bitter than most brown ales. Mouthfeel is thin-medium bodied with nice carbonation, but a little too thin for the sytle. Overall, this is an interesting take on a brown ale that works fairly well. It's not a great beer, but it's certainly a good one.","starrdogg","Nov 26, 2012"

Not bad, I need a Cubano sandwich to fully enjoy this. Would be interested in trying the more complex versions of this base beer.","jdense","Apr 30, 2012"

I usually find the aroma of browns to be lacking but found the oat component really gave some substance to this one's smell. Flavor is expectedly on the sweet side as well with some caremalized brown sugar, molasses, nutty, some oatiness and the slightest touch of roastiness. Medium mouthfeel with some slight carbonation.

I get some distinct green apple and melon aromas with a hint of vanilla. Very malty, and a little funky at the same time. Taste is...yep..I'm thinkin I understand the strange aroma. I'm thinkin this beer is a bit infected. Initially I get a slightly funky/tart green apple flavor immediately followed by some earthy hops. Then I get some very nice malt flavors with just a hint of chocolate and vanilla. Melon and tropical flavors with just a bit of nutty and coffee flavors at the end. If this beer is infected, I think it should stay this way. Very tasty. Mouthfeel is a bit overly carbonated...kinda like club soda. Drinkability is high. Overall, American brown ales are not really my thing, but this is definitely one of the better one's I've had. Possible infection could be key to me liking this one so much.","DovaliHops","Dec 03, 2011"

4.2,7.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I'm a huge fan of brown ales in general ever since having my first Newcastle Brown Ale years ago. For the record, this blows Newcastle out of the English Channel waters! Pours a very clear medium brown with a light airy head that dissipates quickly leaving respectable lacing. Aromas of roasted malts and slight coffee up front. The back notes are exceptional, employing the typical, brown ale roasted nuttiness perfect for anytime of...well...anytime. This also goes great with a fine cigar(go figure) and a poker table rounded with the best of friends. I will recommend this to people who don't like the bitterness of really hoppy brews, but would like to drink something smooth and flavorful.","RashyGrillCook","Apr 28, 2011"

Poured with a decent off-white head that reduced to a wispy cap and decent lacings on the glass. Sweet roasted malt and floral hop aromas with a hint of nuts. The hop aroma is subdued enough to allow the roasted malt to shine through. Medium bodied with lively carbonation. Roasted malt and toffee flavors in the beginning. Floral hop bitterness shows through the middle along with a hint of lightly roasted coffee. Finishes with a bit of roasted malt flavor and a more pronounced bitter hop character. Nice flavor complexity for a usually predictable style.","IronLover","0"

It tastes of dark malts, sweet and bitter chocolates, light roasted coffee, hazelnut, and oak. I'm in love with it really. The thing that may make it the most appealing is how drinkable it is.

A quarter inch, cream-colored, bubbly head disperses into a thin skim and a sudsy mass. Nose is malty, spicy and slightly medicinal - there's also perhaps a trace of burnt sugar and anise. Taste expresses dried dark fruit (figs/prunes), oatmeal cookie and anise. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an even carbonation that falls just short of crisp and a slightly dry finish.

This beer has a fair amount of alcohol flavor and effect for a 5.5 ABV brew, it warms the throat and chest better than many of the so called winter warmers I've tried.

To say the light tan colored cap is able to gather itself to two fingers in height would be stretching the truth, and there's barely any lacing left behind to speak of. Nose is solid, predominantly , with some nuttiness showing up as well and a hint of fruity esters. Those esters get lost on my palate though, and I can't find much of anything in the flavor outside the one two punch of biscuits and toasted nuts. It's not bad, but I find myself wishing there was just a little more to it (especially after finding some fruits in the aroma). Body is appropriately mild for a brown ale of this size, with that added bit of smoothness I expect to find in a beer that features oats. The understated carbonation plays up to that as well, resulting in a pretty silky mouthfeel.

These aromas work unusually well with the dry maltiness of a brown ale. More earthy and tobacco notes in the taste, but here they are mild and combine with a creaminess that tempers everything and provides some balance.

The roastyness is the first thing that is hitting my tongue, though it quickly subsides and the sweet toffee and brown sugar notes mingle together with a little bit of herbal hop character and a touch of smokiness. This beer is on the heavier side of medium bodied with a nice smooth (no doubt the oats) finish that is drier than I expected.

Some nice tobacco flavor as well. Damn, this is like NYC during the winter with the roasted chestnut vendors. There is a nice toasted malt, brown sugar, light honey, grape, lemon and metal; basically a good base for the chestnut flavors. A moderate body with fizzy carbonation, this is coupled with a tobacco like malt which adds a nice earthy quality. This is one tasty ass brown ale. Cigar City makes a mean brown ale.

By the way, this mini growler might be the coolest looking bottle of beer I have run in to in quite a long time. Anyway, a rigorous pour produces a lovely dark rosewood colored beer, with large, ample white heading. It almost looked black when I poured, but was proven wrong when placing it under the light. Smell is light and delicate, but opens op more as it warms. Chocolate, caramel, smoke, wood, coffee and oatmeal all end up on the table. Taste has exactly the same elements, with the oatmeal and wood characters coming through the most. The mouthfeel is truly extraordinary. The dark malts along with the oatmeal characters meld perfectly. Hop presence is barely there, but that did not bother me. This is about as smooth a beer as you are going to get. I recommend sipping this one, but I must admit that it is a challenge considering how damn good it is.

CCB does an excellent job combining a number of aromas and tastes in their beers, this is no exception. A blend of that sweet malt, both caramel and chocolate comes through in the taste, and just enough hop bitterness at the end to balance the flavor. A much fuller body than many brown ales, in fact, I have not been a big brown ale fan, but this brings a lot more to the table. A bit dense, which I like, but a very enjoyable beer.

4.17,6.4,3.5,4,4,4,5,"Had this poured for me at the brewery while still in the fermentor. Was an awesome experience especially to have it taste so wonderful even at 68 degrees. Its natural carbonation tickles the nose with a slight biscuity aroma. Color was that of a dark candy orange. Palate was very malty with I will be damned a peanut aftertaste. Cant wait to try it when its ready to be served.","Tettonka","0"
