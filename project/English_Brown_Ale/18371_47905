A bit of that continues in the taste, but the addition of caramel is what stands out, as well as some stale hop bitterness that I found a little off-putting.  Surprisingly light bodied compared to the strong aroma.  It's good, but I would have liked a bit more in the body to match the amazing aroma.","thebeers","Dec 15, 2014"

Definetely picking out the chocolate malt in the flavor and black malt in aroma, and perhaps the sugar additions gives it that molasses flavor. A little surpised at the light booziness. Pretty sure it's there but perhaps just my palate tonight.","mclaughlindw4","Nov 08, 2014"
